1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,050
Five,
four,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,790
three,
two,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,280
one.
Gentlemen,

4
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:10,290
thank you very much for being here.
Really appreciate it.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,230
Dr Khan,
uh,

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,270
before we get started,
why don't you tell everybody what your 

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:17,270
background is.
Uh,

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,250
you will be representing the Vegan 
portion of this discussion.

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,260
Tell people about yourself a little bit.

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,410
Thank you.
I feel like the head Broccoli in the 

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:27,410
United States today,
but I am from motown,

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,440
motor city,
bad ass,

13
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,790
uh,
born and raised,

14
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,530
University of Michigan School of 
Medicine,

15
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,830
summa cum laude,
internal medicine training,

16
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,020
cardiology training in Dallas,
Texas.

17
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:42,021
Very hard to be Vegan in Dallas,
but I did it in the eighties because 

18
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,240
I've been doing this 42 year Vegan 42 
years and that's impressive.

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,280
Age Eighteen and then a Kansas City,
Missouri and another tough town to eat 

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,970
plants and only the steakhouse kc 
masterpiece.

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,270
Did a training and stenting.
I was blasting open heart attacks from 

22
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,840
1990 on,
came back to Michigan.

23
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:00,510
Very active cath lab,
heart attack.

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,600
You're dead.
I bring you back practice 24 hours a day

25
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,530
with great partners.
And about three to four years ago,

26
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:10,530
I used all these decades of plant based 
medicine.

27
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:14,400
I've been basically bringing my family 
up with and teaching patients,

28
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:19,401
but it opened a completely preventive 
cardiology practice and along the way 

29
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:21,330
with my wife and son,
we now own three plant based restaurants

30
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:21,960
too,
in Detroit.

31
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,520
One in Austin,
Texas,

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,050
right books.
Do TV,

33
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,700
write blogs,
teach,

34
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:27,330
teach,
teach,

35
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:32,331
and that can stop them.
One hundred 50 because there's a lot of 

36
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:32,331
erectile dysfunction.
The stamp out.

37
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:34,800
That's my passion that.
Oh my God.

38
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,840
What else?
What better purpose in life?

39
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,370
Um,
well we can,

40
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:44,371
we can get to that.
Heart disease is somewhere in that mix 

41
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:44,800
too.
And uh,

42
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,190
if people want to read more about you 
website is.

43
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Yeah,
Dr j o e l k a h n Dr Joel Kahn and 

44
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,060
you've written a ton of books,
right?

45
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,520
A bunch of medical papers,
a whole lot of blogs.

46
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,990
Awesome.
And Chris?

47
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,090
Yeah,
Chris Kresser,

48
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:02,920
demand

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,040
or Grad at uc Berkeley and then got a 
master's of science and I'm co director 

50
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:12,030
of the California Center for Functional 
Medicine,

51
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:17,031
which is a functional medicine clinic 
and in here in California up in 

52
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:18,000
Berkeley.
And,

53
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,060
uh,
I came to this from my own experience 

54
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,060
with chronic illness.
I as,

55
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,240
as you know,
Joe got really sick,

56
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,660
uh,
back in my early twenties when I was 

57
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,000
traveling around the world and uh,
you know,

58
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,210
conventional medicine didn't have much 
to offer for me.

59
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:38,211
And so that led me on a path of trying 
to figure out the best approach from a 

60
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:42,591
diet and behavior and lifestyle 
perspective to heal from my own chronic 

61
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:47,001
illness.
And then that evolved into me starting 

62
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:47,170
to write,
you know,

63
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:49,530
it started a blog and a website and 
then,

64
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,000
um,
wrote a couple of books and now have a,

65
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,170
an organization that trains 
practitioners in functional medicine and

66
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,040
also trains health.

67
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,800
And you add one point in time.
We're Vegan.

68
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,150
I was a macrobiotic Vegan.
I was apprenticing with a macrobiotic,

69
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,940
a chef.
So what's the difference?

70
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:14,941
Eating macrobiotic Vegan for folks and 
irregular Vegan and macrobiotic is a 

71
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:19,921
particular philosophy.
It's a particular approach that came 

72
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:22,150
from Japan and um,
it's Vegan,

73
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,110
but it's,
it's,

74
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,380
you know,
it's heavily influenced by Japanese 

75
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,110
tradition and cuisine and it has some 
kind of different beliefs than us.

76
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,910
A typical vegan approach,
so I was uh,

77
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,550
when I was originally studying Chinese 
medicine,

78
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:41,350
I was working in an apprenticing with a 
macrobiotic Vegan chef and we were going

79
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:43,390
around cooking for people who are really
ill,

80
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,420
often people with cancer who were 
following a macrobiotic diet.

81
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,860
And before that I had been a vegetarian 
for quite a while as well.

82
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:55,861
What,
when I was traveling around the world 

83
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:55,861
and got sick.
Actually I was,

84
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:55,861
I was vegetarian at that point too.

85
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,510
And you discovered through your own 
personal.

86
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,950
We do it over there,
buddy.

87
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,270
You discovered over there through your 
own personal practice that you,

88
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,990
your body worked better and your 
illnesses went away when you changed 

89
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,970
your diet away from macrobiotic?
Yeah.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
For me personally,
I'm vegetarian diet and particularly 

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,220
Vegan diet was a disaster,
but I'm just one person.

92
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:29,221
I don't put a lot of stock into a single
person's experience one way or the 

93
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:33,061
other,
but certainly that did lead me down the 

94
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:35,791
path of questioning some of my earlier 
beliefs that I had about vegetarianism 

95
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:39,751
and veganism and it led me to make some 
different choices and that is important 

96
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:43,450
to discuss here that everybody's body 
really is different,

97
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,730
different people's bodies and 
lifestyles.

98
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,490
They're going to have different 
requirements.

99
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,030
Absolutely.
I mean,

100
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,250
I,
I would say,

101
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,510
just to start off this whole discussion,
if we're trying to answer the question,

102
00:04:55,511 --> 00:05:00,511
what's the optimal diet for everyone?
I think that's a terrible question and 

103
00:05:00,511 --> 00:05:02,220
it's an unanswerable question,
uh,

104
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,690
where we share a lot in common as human 
beings,

105
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:06,550
but we have a lot of important 
differences to.

106
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:09,850
And from the beginning I've always 
argued that there's no one size fits all

107
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,580
approach when it comes to diet.
Um,

108
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,770
but I think there are some common themes
and we can.

109
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,290
I'm sure we'll get to those later.
Yeah,

110
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,760
I think that's really important,
right?

111
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:23,761
It's really,
it's really important to discuss that 

112
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:23,761
people really do have different 
requirements.

113
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:23,890
Yeah.
And I mean,

114
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,850
we'll get into the mud a little bit as 
we need to,

115
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:28,100
but we also,
Chris and I share a lot in common.

116
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:28,550
I mean,
one,

117
00:05:28,551 --> 00:05:33,551
if we ate together,
it would probably be 90 percent the 

118
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:34,280
same.
We both are really respectful of what we

119
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:36,310
call functional medicine,
root cause medicine.

120
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,660
I don't write scripts without thinking 
about the patient.

121
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,810
He certainly doesn't do that without 
thinking about the entire patient is 

122
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,231
pretty unusual.
And we are going to represent a very 

123
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:47,231
small section.
I,

124
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:47,231
I honor what he's doing with his new 
book,

125
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:47,970
unconventional medicine.
The rest.

126
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,100
Yeah.
That is what is happening throughout 

127
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,100
medicine.
Um,

128
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,790
and it's necessary because it just,
we're just running out of dollars in and

129
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,130
health when we're just pushing and not 
even

130
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,930
asking the person what they eat,
how they sleep,

131
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,370
you know,
the whole thing,

132
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:02,570
you know,
we're real people.

133
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,290
Yeah.
We know that.

134
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,550
We don't agree on this,
but it's still rare jewel.

135
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:08,260
I mean this is to have,
you know,

136
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,330
this is pretty rare segment.
I don't know that two percent of the 

137
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,881
people in America will have a patient 
leaves the office and actually ask what 

138
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:15,881
they

139
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:15,881
today,
you know?

140
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:15,881
Yeah.
I mean,

141
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,020
it doesn't happen.
Let me say one more thing about this 

142
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,311
though,
because I think you hit on a really 

143
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:23,311
important point and I'm glad you did.
Did it right off the bat.

144
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,620
The biggest problem with nutritional 
research epidemiology is that it starts 

145
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:31,780
with the assumption that there is one 
diet for everybody.

146
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,530
That's,
that's something that's rarely 

147
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:37,530
discussed,
but it's,

148
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:37,530
it's this idea that,
you know,

149
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,170
should everyone be on a low carb diet,
should everyone be on a high carb,

150
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,550
you know,
low fat or a low fat diet,

151
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:45,850
you know,
should everyone do this?

152
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:47,680
Should everyone do that?
And the whole,

153
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,880
um,
you know,

154
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:53,881
there's a guy in Australia,
professor who calls calls this approach 

155
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:59,761
nutritionism this idea that we can 
reduce foods down into these individual 

156
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:03,340
components just like macronutrients,
protein,

157
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:04,630
fat,
carbohydrates,

158
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,050
and we can figure out what works best 
for everyone just by looking at these 

159
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:12,580
isolated components without considering 
the,

160
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,140
the whole context of the Diet.

161
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,460
So I think,
you know,

162
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:20,490
Joel would agree that if you talk about 
a diet that's 50 percent calories and 

163
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,091
fat and one diet is they're getting all 
of those fat calories from pizza and 

164
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:26,800
chips and candy bars and things like 
that,

165
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:32,070
and then another diet,
they're getting 50 percent of fat from 

166
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,770
Avocados and olive oil and uh,
even,

167
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,600
you know,
eggs and animal foods,

168
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,040
those are two totally different diets.
And yet in the scientific literature,

169
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,410
those are equated as the same because 
they're,

170
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:43,510
all they're looking at is the calories 
from fat.

171
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:45,880
They're not considering the quality of 
the Diet

172
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,730
and others add in,
and again,

173
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,760
we'd go anywhere with this conversation,
but a lot of the problem has been 

174
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,030
imprecision of language.
So even the word low carb diet,

175
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:56,550
I had a low carb diet.
If we talk low refined carbs,

176
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,830
I don't eat white flour,
I don't eat sugar.

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,810
A very careful about all those 
components.

178
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,350
I eat a very high complex carbohydrate 
diet.

179
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:09,351
So we'll vegetables.
A giant study that's been released this 

180
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:11,020
years appear study,
talks about carbs in the Diet.

181
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,040
They didn't differentiate complex and 
refined very hard to know what to do 

182
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,650
with data that doesn't spread that 
apart.

183
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,840
And in your own life,
I mean low fat,

184
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:20,520
high fat.
I mean we need to talk about,

185
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,000
is it soybean oil that's processed and 
rancid?

186
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,700
Are we talking about Avocados and uh,
you know,

187
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:30,240
healthy whole foods.
So the precision of language,

188
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,620
even protein protein.

189
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,430
The big divide is animal versus plant.
So anytime that word comes up we need to

190
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:40,431
differentiate what w know,
be precise and then will help more 

191
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:40,470
people if we're precise.
Yeah.

192
00:08:40,471 --> 00:08:42,780
And if you can just to eliminate this 
for people.

193
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:46,200
What is the problem with epidemiology 
studies?

194
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,240
Boy,
you know,

195
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,830
I'll,
I'll go there real quick.

196
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,900
I mean,
I don't think there's a problem,

197
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,450
but there are a part of the solution.
They're not the whole solution.

198
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,540
A lot scientists,
I'll give a shout out to Los Angeles,

199
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,880
brightest nutrition mine,
somebody that I know,

200
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:03,690
Chris Honors to Valter Longo,
no label and that Vegan that Pailin that

201
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,550
nothing.
He's at USC,

202
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,610
been honored by the Royal Academy of 
Swedish medicine,

203
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,140
which is a Nobel prize committee in 
this.

204
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,610
Now.
He says,

205
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:16,611
you know,
you do basic science and then you do an 

206
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:16,770
epidemiology study to test the 
hypothesis.

207
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:19,380
You've seen something in a petri dish,
you see something in a mouse,

208
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:21,810
you see something in a cell,
you asked the question,

209
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,220
is animal protein prolongevity pro early
aging,

210
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,190
explaining epidemiologists study people.

211
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,250
So you would take that concept.
I'll just run with that,

212
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:32,190
that you know,
you,

213
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:33,600
um,
you look at a,

214
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:38,601
uh,
an amino acid found in animal protein 

215
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:41,330
thrown out.
Matthias and Lucy in a petri dish looks 

216
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:41,940
like it might cause accelerated aging in
a single cell.

217
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:44,460
That's about chemistry.
That is something you honor,

218
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,170
but it's a long jump from there to a 
human.

219
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,130
Then you look at a database.
Sometimes it's a crappy old database.

220
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,490
Sometimes it's Harvard has these 
gigantic ongoing database.

221
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,860
A Loma Linda an hour from here has a 
gigantic database and there's others 

222
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,730
that epic study,
this pure study I mentioned,

223
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,080
you can test a hypothesis of what 
happens if our data may be crappy,

224
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:07,350
but it's still data and it allows you to
go further with 100,000

225
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:08,160
people.
50,000

226
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:09,090
people,
500,000

227
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:10,100
people.
Can we,

228
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,670
do we have the data?
Ask the question,

229
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,720
does protein correlate with survival 
protein correlate with early death,

230
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,100
animal protein,
plant protein?

231
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,190
These studies had been coming out a lot 
lately and they let you parse it out.

232
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,550
Now it's what Chris talks about.
Do you know everything about the person 

233
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,021
in the database?
Do you know smoke or do you know 

234
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:30,021
diabetes or they go to the gym to lift 
weights.

235
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:32,130
They smoke dope and smoke crack.
You know you don't know everything.

236
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,110
Nowadays.
Most of these things are going to ask,

237
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,400
are your blood pressure,
cholesterol,

238
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,790
all the basics to try and take those 
factors away and isolate the question 

239
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,771
you're asking.
It will be imperfect and then you go to 

240
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:45,771
the best study,
but it won't.

241
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:46,980
It won't happen often.
The randomized clinical trial,

242
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,720
I mean,
there's never been a randomized clinical

243
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:50,810
trial smoking [inaudible] that'd be 
unethical.

244
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,820
You're never going to do it.
It was epidemiology that proved and 

245
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,500
association strong enough to recommend 
to the public don't smoke.

246
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,140
They'll never be a randomized trial and 
that everything,

247
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,870
parachutes don't need a randomized 
trial,

248
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,180
you know,
um,

249
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:10,210
you know,
taking folic acid and a pregnant woman 

250
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:10,740
to not have spinal Bifida doesn't need a
randomized trial.

251
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:12,450
I mean there's some things that are so 
pressing.

252
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,140
The public health can't allow that and 
there's even more than that.

253
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:17,860
The last little section is,
um,

254
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,650
you can study old people.
Chris enjoys studying ancient societies.

255
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:25,920
I enjoy studying the elderly in current,
you know,

256
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:30,921
modern environment,
which is called the blue zones and 

257
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:30,921
there's others.
But you know,

258
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:31,890
what old people do,
the old healthy people.

259
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:32,790
Well,
we would like to be,

260
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:37,791
would you like to be 90 and have your 
brains and have your joints and 

261
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,230
everything working well,
we have that database so that little for

262
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,270
a pod,
a pedestal,

263
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:47,271
the sit on basic epidemiology,
randomized studies and centenarian 

264
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:49,740
studies allows you to make reasonable 
conclusions will be wrong.

265
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:51,240
Some things we're not going to be very 
long,

266
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,390
Chris.
I think there's huge problems with 

267
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:56,390
epidemiology.

268
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:56,800
So obser,
epidemiology,

269
00:11:56,801 --> 00:12:01,801
observational studies are studies that 
look at a certain group of people and 

270
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:06,511
then try to draw inferences from their 
behavior about associations with 

271
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:10,480
disease.
So let's say we take a group and we look

272
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,530
and see,
you know,

273
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,650
how much saturated fat are they eating?
And we separate them into,

274
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,330
you know,
low consumption,

275
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:18,070
medium consumption,
high consumption,

276
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,280
and in a prospective study where we're 
watching them over time,

277
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,610
we might then look 20 years later and 
see how many people had heart attacks 

278
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:26,920
and died.
Okay.

279
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,880
And then we try to correlate that with 
their amount of saturated fat intake.

280
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,230
Now I actually just published two 
articles with.

281
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,380
I'm going in detail on the problems with
observational nutritional research and 

282
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,510
um,
you can find them at [inaudible] dot com

283
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,540
slash Rogan.
There's a whole bunch of information 

284
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:48,820
that we're going to be talking about 
today there so people can go and get the

285
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:49,930
details themselves.

286
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,860
But I'll just give you three of the,
I think the most,

287
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,360
the worst problems with nutritional 
epidemiology.

288
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,680
The first is data collection.
So there's a saying in science,

289
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:04,710
which is that data are only as good as 
the as the tool used to collect them.

290
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,950
All right?
And in nutritional observational 

291
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,111
studies,
the tool used to collect data is a 

292
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:13,111
questionnaire.
Okay?

293
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,630
And so that relies completely on memory 
and we know that memory is not a 

294
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:24,091
precise,
accurate or literal representation of 

295
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:26,851
events.
It's more like a highly edited anecdote 

296
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:28,750
of what happened in the past and back a 
little bit like the cavenaugh thing.

297
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:33,751
Go now,
back in the bag in the 13th century you 

298
00:13:33,751 --> 00:13:34,030
had Francis Bacon.
He said,

299
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,720
for something to be scientific it has to
be independently observable,

300
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,980
measurable and falsifiable,
and then accurate and valid,

301
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,100
valid.
And so let's use an analogy.

302
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:48,760
If you're sitting there eating an apple 
and I'm watching you do that,

303
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,830
I can observe that you're eating the 
apple.

304
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,860
I can measure how much of the apple you 
eat and I can confirm or refute that 

305
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,001
you're eating the apple.
If you tell me that you were eating an 

306
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:02,740
apple 15 years ago or 10 years ago,
I obviously can observe that.

307
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:06,970
I obviously can't measure it and I 
obviously can't confirm or refute it and

308
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:11,971
yet our entire foundation of nutritional
epidemiology is based on that.

309
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,320
Basically people reporting on what they 
ate at some time in the past,

310
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:20,110
so you know how much of a problem is 
this.

311
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,170
A.
There's a guy named Edward Archer who's 

312
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,770
done some really interesting studies and
he looked at the end Haynes data,

313
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:31,771
the nurses' health data,
which is one of the longest running 

314
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:32,500
nutrition studies,
39 years,

315
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:38,010
and he found that the self reported 
calorie intake in those studies was 

316
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,310
either physiologically implausible or 
incompatible with life,

317
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,260
so the average person in those studies 
reported a calorie intake that would not

318
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,160
support an elderly bedridden frail 
woman,

319
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,960
so they just.

320
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,250
It's just inaccurate.
It's completely inaccurate and the 

321
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,740
people who are most likely to under 
report or people who are overweight and 

322
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,660
obese,
so if you if calories or that much under

323
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:08,120
reported,
all nutrition comes through calories.

324
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,560
Everything.
We get fat,

325
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,060
protein,
carbohydrates,

326
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,950
micronutrients.
They all come through calories,

327
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:17,951
so calories or that underreported,
that completely invalidates the Dataset.

328
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:23,260
This is an obesity study,
so the there are under reported because 

329
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,250
of Shannon on an obesity study.
It's just every Americans are overweight

330
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:27,710
and obese.
The majority of Americans are overweight

331
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:32,711
and obese,
so in any data set of Americans are 

332
00:15:32,711 --> 00:15:33,830
going to have the majority of them 
overweight or obese or are obese.

333
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:38,831
So that's the first problem.
The second problem is the healthy user 

334
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:39,260
bias,
which I know we talked about before,

335
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:44,650
but it's basically the idea that because
you know when someone engages in an 

336
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:47,720
unhealthy and a behavior that's 
perceived as unhealthy,

337
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,170
they are more likely to engage in other 
behaviors that are perceived as 

338
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:53,180
unhealthy and vice versa.

339
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:58,010
So let's say you do a study of people 
who ate eat more red meat.

340
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,490
Red Meat has been perceived as unhealthy
for a long time,

341
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,310
and so what we know is that in those 
observational studies,

342
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:07,610
that people who eat more red meat are 
also smoking more.

343
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:10,070
They have higher body mass index.
They're eating less,

344
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:13,760
fewer fruits and vegetables.
They have a lower level of education.

345
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,790
They're less physically active.
So how do you know that it's the red 

346
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,001
meat that's causing the problem and not 
those other things you don't because 

347
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:24,650
they cannot control for all of those 
potential confounding factors.

348
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,440
The third problem with observational 
research,

349
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,710
and maybe the biggest is that the the 
relative risks in nutrition are so low 

350
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,760
that they're indistinguishable from 
chance.

351
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,910
So in fields outside of nutrition and 
epidemiology,

352
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,660
nobody would consider a relative risk an
increase in risk less than 100 percent.

353
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,780
A doubling to be really worth paying 
attention to.

354
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:56,140
So to put this in perspective,
the observational studies that Joel was 

355
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,161
referring to that confirmed that is that
cigarette smoking led to lung cancer 

356
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:06,010
that showed in between a 1000 and 3000 
percent increase in lung cancer in 

357
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:09,980
smokers.
Okay.

358
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,300
And the studies that have shown that 
eating aflatoxin,

359
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,150
which is a mycotoxin increased liver 
cancer risk,

360
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,180
that's 600 percent increase.
Okay.

361
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:22,820
The AIA,
the I a arc,

362
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:25,400
the WHO report that suggested that 
process,

363
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:29,270
red meat was a carcinogen.
That was 18 percent increase.

364
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Most epidemiologists you've talked to 
will say that is so low that it's really

365
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,430
interesting.
Indistinguishable from chance,

366
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:42,431
especially given the healthy user bias 
and the problems with the data 

367
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:44,300
collection that I mentioned before.
So the studies that are cited,

368
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,240
so when people are talking about red 
meat causes cancer,

369
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:52,241
they're literally talking about 
something that showed an 18 percent 

370
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:52,241
increase.

371
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:56,500
Yeah.
And this is over a depot that are also 

372
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,110
consuming sugar.
That translates into four and a half.

373
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,380
There were four and a half cases of 
cancer out of 100 and people with no 

374
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,700
lowest intake of processed meat.
And that went up to five point three 

375
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,770
cases out of 100 and people with the 
highest intake of processed meat.

376
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,180
So,
you know,

377
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,530
there are quotes like if you,
if you look even 20 years ago,

378
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,930
like there's an article in science,
um,

379
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,560
the journal Science and Marsha Anjell 
who was the former editor of New England

380
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:30,810
Journal of Medicine,
was quoted as saying we wouldn't even 

381
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,991
accept a paper for publication if it 
didn't have at least a 200 percent 

382
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:37,610
increase,
especially if it was a new association 

383
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:37,610
or the,
the,

384
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,230
the biological mechanism wasn't known.
And here we are today saying that you 

385
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,960
know,
this increase that by seven percent or 

386
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,671
by 10 percent and when you consider that
the data is usually questionnaires of 

387
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:54,321
what people ate and all of these 
confounding factors like exercise and 

388
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,020
and fruit and vegetable consumption and 
things like that are not accounted for.

389
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,440
Then we're really just playing games 
with numbers as part of the problem as 

390
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,521
well,
that there's this clickbait culture now 

391
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,401
in terms of journalism where they just 
want to publish something that says 

392
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:13,350
eight study shows,
18 percent of people eat red meat,

393
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:15,540
get cancer.
That's a huge problem.

394
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:20,541
And there is a study that was done that 
showed that 43 percent of findings came 

395
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:26,850
from observational studies were 
portrayed in the media as being causal,

396
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,610
which,
which any epidemiologists would tell you

397
00:19:29,611 --> 00:19:32,490
that that's a full pot.
You can't do that,

398
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,270
but nobody is going to click on a 
headline that says,

399
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,630
you know,
small association between these two 

400
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,870
variables scene,
we don't know what it means,

401
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,960
but please read the stories.

402
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,670
Interesting.
Let me just grab a couple and again,

403
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,870
a lot of respect and agreement.
But if we throw a bid deem ecology away,

404
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:56,871
we thrown away about 80 percent of 
nutrition knowledge because that is the 

405
00:19:56,871 --> 00:19:58,890
most common kind of study and that still
leaves us with basic science,

406
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:03,891
which is rockin.
It leaves us with a randomized clinical 

407
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:07,941
trials which are very hard nutrition and
they're very expensive and there's less 

408
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:10,881
than we need.
And if finally leaves us with the 

409
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:10,920
studying old healthy people centenarian 
studies,

410
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:15,921
but does go to Loma Linda 10 times more 
people in Loma Linda are over 100 than 

411
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,790
there are in Los Angeles 10 times more.
That's by definition.

412
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,750
Yeah,
it's called the blue zone.

413
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:23,751
And we'll talk about blue zone.
But that was discovered in the 19 

414
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:23,880
fifties.
If you lived in Loma Linda,

415
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:26,640
you were living 12.
Some of those an hour east of here.

416
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,360
It's what's going on with the center of 
the seventh day adventist church,

417
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,790
which teaches people eat your veggies,
don't drink,

418
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,480
don't smoke and exercise.
So it's an amazing lifestyle oriented,

419
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,520
uh,
aspect of the Christian church.

420
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:42,240
And they in 1958 got huge funding from 
the government to explore.

421
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,160
Why the heck are they live in 12 years,
eight years,

422
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,650
10 years longer,
and they've parsed that out and probably

423
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:50,020
a thousand publications there.
It's not a randomized study,

424
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:52,360
you know,
it was an la versus Loma Linda will feed

425
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:54,670
you different diets and fought.
Won't ever happen,

426
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,540
but it is a reliable longterm peer 
review.

427
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:03,541
This stuff's published,
the finest of journals and it at least 

428
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,541
lets you ask questions.
I mean why is there a 104 year old 

429
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,841
cardiac surgeon,
Elliot wore sham walking around doing 

430
00:21:09,841 --> 00:21:10,390
his gardening and he just finished 
operating on a heart patients.

431
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:12,910
I mean,
it's insane for a award.

432
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,670
Show him love you buddy.
So let me go back for a minute.

433
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,270
If we throw epidemiology out,
we are left with basically.

434
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,520
No,
I know,

435
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:26,670
but so food.
This is all technical stuff and but 

436
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,420
you've got a sophisticated audience.
Food frequency questionnaires with Chris

437
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:33,421
said is the source of a lot of these 
epidemiologists states you fill out a 

438
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:36,811
four page,
a 40 page at in Loma Linda to 58 page 

439
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:38,110
survey,
but you do it once.

440
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,210
That's called the pure study.
The headlines.

441
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,770
You've seen them,
cheese,

442
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:42,520
eggs,
meat,

443
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:47,521
or good for your heart.
It's been the news the last two weeks 

444
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:47,521
that comes from a giant international 
study.

445
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:49,180
They did one food frequency 
questionnaire at the beginning.

446
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,160
Twelve years later,
the reporting that data,

447
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:53,080
it's all click bait headlines.
It's like you say,

448
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:56,740
people love to see this stuff,
so if we throw out some studies,

449
00:21:56,741 --> 00:22:01,741
we have to throw out the largest 
nutritional study that's been reported 

450
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:02,290
and the most recent one that's getting 
all the headlines.

451
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,230
It's got to be played fair.
Now you go to Loma Linda.

452
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:10,231
It's every four years.
They're asking you go to Harvard school 

453
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:10,231
public health every four years they 
update the data,

454
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:11,830
so if you change your diet,
that's the weakness.

455
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,070
You fill out the survey and then you get
healthy or you get sick and you make 

456
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,480
changes and then they're counting of 
your debt or lie.

457
00:22:17,481 --> 00:22:18,880
Well,
it might be what you did.

458
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:20,500
Your six now what you filled out year 
one,

459
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:23,380
so there are.
There are better and worse forms.

460
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,790
The second I'd say healthy user bias is 
the idea that people pick a certain diet

461
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,970
might have other lifestyles.
It might be as or more important.

462
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,560
It's going to be true of the Paleo 
Group.

463
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,430
I mean,
these guys are gonna.

464
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,710
Look at Chris.
He looks wonderful.

465
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:38,010
He Se thin.
He's not the obese American,

466
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,450
the 75 percent that are overweight and 
obese.

467
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:43,630
I mean that's true in the plant 
community to some extent.

468
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:48,631
We have Chubby vegans like there's no 
observational studies with significant 

469
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:49,960
number of Paleo dieters too.
I know.

470
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,290
I know that a healthy user bias is not 
an issue for Leo,

471
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:58,530
but if you don't have data doesn't mean.
I mean you don't have data because it's 

472
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,561
a new movement that hasn't had the data,
but it's not the cast stones that plant 

473
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:03,310
based Cedars go to the gym more.
It's probably true.

474
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,210
We don't know,
but.

475
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,380
And that's a third thing to stop you for
a second.

476
00:23:06,381 --> 00:23:06,490
Yeah.

477
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,240
Mediators do get lumped in with the 
Paleo group.

478
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:13,150
They consider Paleo group part of the 
meat eater group.

479
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,420
Like when people talk about these 
epidemiologic.

480
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,700
Yeah.
Epidemiology studies where they show 

481
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,240
that people that consume red meat more 
likely to get sick on my leg to cancer.

482
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,680
They're not referring to Paleo diet or 
consider eating avocado and grass fed.

483
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:27,550
You gotta.
Remember,

484
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,030
most of the Paleo movement is the last 
dozen,

485
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:31,140
15 years,
you know,

486
00:23:31,141 --> 00:23:35,340
we can talk about that in 1985,
2000 to Loren cordain publishers book in

487
00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:36,900
2002.
The book didn't sell,

488
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:38,790
republished 2010.
It took off.

489
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,820
This is a relatively new moment,
so if you filled out the study and Loma 

490
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,790
Linda in 1958,
you don't have to worry.

491
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,540
There weren't too many people following 
a classic Paleo Diet.

492
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,640
This also true at Harvard,
these initiatives,

493
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,570
the last is just a relative risk.
That's what we call it.

494
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,080
These are pure statistics.
I'm a,

495
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,760
I'm a heart attack,
not a statistician,

496
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,340
but there are some exceptions.
I mean anybody,

497
00:23:58,341 --> 00:24:02,240
and I'll just say I've got a red button 
on my website that says Rogan references

498
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,400
because I thought it would be good to 
have people a place to go,

499
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,340
just like Chris mentioned,
and I'm not massaging the data.

500
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,770
It's scientific peer reviewed data.
Um,

501
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,140
there was a study in October,
2016,

502
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:15,050
October one,
2016 songs from Harvard,

503
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,450
6,000
people observational data,

504
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,460
animal protein,
plant protein.

505
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,920
They actually let me go to 2014.
Morgan Levine,

506
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:24,380
this is an amazing Harvard researcher,
beautiful woman,

507
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,540
Morgan Levine.
She looked at 6,000

508
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:28,250
people prospectively,
observation,

509
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:33,251
fill out all these data.
If you were an animal protein eater 

510
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:37,661
that's called meat,
you had a three to 400 percent increase 

511
00:24:37,661 --> 00:24:38,060
in cancer risk.
Three to 400 percent.

512
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:40,400
That's three to four times isn't one 
point one,

513
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:41,000
one point.
Oh,

514
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,020
eight,
18 percent.

515
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,820
The data's there.
This is peer reviewed data.

516
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,570
If you ate plant based proteins,
risk of cancer goes down.

517
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,060
This is in the highest pause for a 
second.

518
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,100
I just want to say there are nutritional
data that are powerful,

519
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,210
but this is also an epidemiology study.
That's where 18 in a,

520
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:02,450
nobody's going to do a randomized study 
of 6,000

521
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:03,590
people.
You eat beans,

522
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:03,930
you eat

523
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,450
this.
And I think I have a,

524
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,890
a good example that can clear some of 
this.

525
00:25:07,891 --> 00:25:09,120
Uh,
so,

526
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,840
um,
you mentioned the Loma Linda and the 

527
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:14,840
seventh day adventist studies.
So,

528
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,630
um,
first of all,

529
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,130
let me just make a comment about 
observational nutritional research.

530
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:25,131
It can,
there are good observational studies in 

531
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:25,131
there,
bad ones you can design an observational

532
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:30,051
study in a way that controls for some of
these potentially confounding factors 

533
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:30,960
like the healthy user bias,
et cetera.

534
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,840
So,
but this is a story that will,

535
00:25:33,841 --> 00:25:37,890
I think clear some of this up.
So there are about eight studies,

536
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,570
major studies that have compared 
lifespan and in a vegetarians and vegans

537
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:46,920
and omnivores.
So the earlier studies are three studies

538
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:51,921
that were seventh day adventist studies,
so they were done in the seventh day 

539
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:53,160
adventist community,
which Joel mentioned.

540
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:56,010
Is it religious group that has as part 
of its credo,

541
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,610
you know,
a healthy lifestyle diet and lifestyle.

542
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,550
Um,
yeah,

543
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,770
by 20,
20 million people,

544
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:07,790
let's not talk over each other.
Let's just make sure we catch a 

545
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:07,890
vegetarian vegetarian diet,
but also,

546
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,920
you know,
eat a live healthy fruits and 

547
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,170
vegetables,
don't smoke,

548
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,380
don't drink excessively,
etc.

549
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:19,700
So you know,
health conscious group of people and the

550
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,610
the,
the,

551
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,910
the first one on the seventh day 
adventist study in the Netherlands,

552
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:26,130
compared them with the general 
population,

553
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:31,131
which is just garbage because of the 
healthy user bias so we can just cross 

554
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,881
that one off the list.
The two Seventh day adventist studies 

555
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:38,181
that were done in loma linda and the us,
they did a better job because they 

556
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:42,140
compared people who do eat meat amongst 
the seventh day adventist population 

557
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,251
with people who don't and was a slight 
advantage in lifespan and in the 

558
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:51,951
vegetarians versus the mediators.
But one of those studies didn't control 

559
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:52,350
for smoking and body mass index.

560
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,350
So that data is highly suspect.
And the other study did and there was a 

561
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:02,241
slight advantage since then.
There have been four studies that I 

562
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:07,191
think did a much better job.
So this is kind of an interesting 

563
00:27:07,191 --> 00:27:09,591
design.
So they said let's try to find a group 

564
00:27:09,591 --> 00:27:10,440
of more health conscious omnivores to 
compare these vegetarians against.

565
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,910
So they.
The first one was called the health food

566
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:17,911
shopper study.
So they looked at people who shopped at 

567
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:20,901
health food stores.
When the idea is people who shopped at 

568
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:21,480
health food stores are going to be 
generally more health conscious and they

569
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:24,000
found health food store,
you mean like a whole foods or I.

570
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,000
There was no whole foods at this point,
but that was the idea.

571
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:32,070
Right.
And so that study found that both 

572
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,820
groups,
vegetarians and omnivores who shopped at

573
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:37,821
health food stores had us hugely reduced
risk of death compared to the general 

574
00:27:37,821 --> 00:27:42,261
population,
but there was no difference between 

575
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:42,261
vegetarians and omnivores.

576
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,890
Second study,
oxford vegetarian study in the uk,

577
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,280
they recruited people buy first they 
recruited vegetarians and then they 

578
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,151
asked the vegetarians to ask their 
friends who also ate meat so that the 

579
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:56,250
idea was the people that are vegetarians
were hanging out with,

580
00:27:56,251 --> 00:27:58,800
might be more health conscious than the 
general population.

581
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,350
Same result,
big difference in the,

582
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,720
in,
in life span between those two groups in

583
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:08,721
the general population,
but no difference between vegetarians 

584
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:09,000
and omnivores.
Epic oxford cohort.

585
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,370
Same thing,
same way of recruiting people.

586
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,440
Same result,
big difference,

587
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,870
uh,
between the two groups in the omnivores,

588
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:18,360
but no difference between vegetarians 
and omnivores.

589
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,720
And then the heidelberg study was in the
in Germany and in a similar way,

590
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,960
I think they recruited people who read 
vegetarian magazines and then they asked

591
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:30,390
them to bring their friends or family 
members who ate meat.

592
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:34,590
Big difference in lifespan between the 
two groups and general population,

593
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,200
no difference between vegetarians and 
omnivores.

594
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,920
And then you had the 45 and up study 
that was recently done in Australia.

595
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,250
This was a little different because they
didn't set out to find,

596
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,140
you know,
more health conscious people.

597
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,470
Instead they looked at 250,000
people,

598
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:53,880
big sample size and they did a much 
better job of controlling for all of the

599
00:28:53,881 --> 00:28:57,390
various factors that might affect the 
results.

600
00:28:57,391 --> 00:28:59,430
So exercise,
physical activity,

601
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:02,490
fruit and vegetable consumption,
cigarette smoking,

602
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,520
alcohol education level because we know 
that has a big impact on lifespan and 

603
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:12,681
they found that there was no difference 
in lifespan between omnivores and 

604
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:16,290
vegetarians in that study as well.
And then there've been two meta analysis

605
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:18,330
of all of the studies that have looked 
at this.

606
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:23,630
Both meta analysis found no difference 
between vegetarians and omnivores in 

607
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,330
total in lifespan.
So I think this is a really good example

608
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:29,850
of what we're talkiNg about here.
that's all observational data,

609
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,910
so we're not throwing it out or saying 
we should throw it out,

610
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:38,180
but all of those studies did a better 
job at dealing with the potential 

611
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,010
pitfalls of observational studies.
And when they did that they found no

612
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,390
difference.
So,

613
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,680
and I want to point out that it,
those ways of picking more health 

614
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,591
conscious omnivores were they still 
weren't comparing like someone on a 

615
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:55,540
paleo type of diet with a vegetarian.
They were just guessing that someone who

616
00:29:55,541 --> 00:30:00,541
shopped at a health food store was at 
least a little more conscious about 

617
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:01,890
health in the general population.
So quick little cleanup.

618
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,500
Quick,
quick,

619
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:07,501
quick.
Luckily I just want to go back for a 

620
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:07,501
minute to meet in cancer.
World health organization is not a vegan

621
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:09,450
group.
It's not enough in group now.

622
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,000
It's a fairly well respected 
international organization that puts out

623
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:18,190
health claims.
So although I absolutely chris had the 

624
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,781
data right,
18 percent increase in cancer risk with 

625
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:21,781
process red meat.
I want to make that clear.

626
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:23,530
I hope you don't eat too many hot dogs.
Lie me,

627
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,030
bologna,
pepperoni.

628
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,060
That's the uh,
well,

629
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:30,220
it may be more than nature,
but it's just a hallway.

630
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,740
It's assault.
That's a preservatives.

631
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,020
It's junky pieces of the animal that 
they're putting into a hot dog.

632
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,420
That was a group that's an 18 percent 
increase.

633
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:39,820
You can go forward and a half percent of
five and a half percent.

634
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,890
That's still 50 to 60,000
people a year.

635
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:43,750
They get colon cancer.
If that data's right,

636
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:48,930
they wouldn't get colon cancer if they 
just would stop eating hot hotdogs at a 

637
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:48,930
minimum.
And I know chris will agree.

638
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:53,730
Frigging hospitals are serving hot dogs 
and the data's out there that it 

639
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:54,970
promotes cancer to people getting 
chemotherapy with the ivy pool.

640
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,250
It's insanity.
So 50,000

641
00:30:57,251 --> 00:31:02,251
people avoid colorectal cancer with 
small differences that the world health 

642
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:04,540
organization suggests it was 800 papers 
in 22 world experts.

643
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,570
There is no perfect study,
but when they announced it,

644
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:09,310
October 25th,
2015,

645
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:14,311
the world was shocked.
You just said that process red meat 

646
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:14,311
causes cancer.

647
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:18,420
They didn't say related.
They were strong enough data to say 

648
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:18,420
cause they've been beat up.
They publish more data.

649
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,750
They haven't backed down,
I just want to put that out.

650
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:24,751
The healthy user bias will exist in the 
paleo community when the study's done 

651
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:25,590
because they may look at paleo effects 
there.

652
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:30,810
It's everything and I honored that.
I mean we should promote healthy 

653
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:30,810
lifestyle foods.
Only one part of this.

654
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,180
I mean we will all at this table live 
longer than the average american.

655
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:37,570
We're not smoking two packs a day.
We don't have 38 inch waist lines.

656
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:39,130
The whole deal.
We're doing the whole thing.

657
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:43,210
Hopefully you guys are enjoying a little
cabernet now and then or a that's always

658
00:31:43,211 --> 00:31:44,440
on the list.
Just don't overdo it,

659
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,740
but the healthy user bias,
that particular that health food study 

660
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,180
paper with 1996,
it's pretty old paper in the paper in 

661
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:53,180
the limitations.

662
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,150
They beat themselves up.
we were missing this or that.

663
00:31:55,151 --> 00:32:00,151
Anybody just read the paper.
It's not that it doesn't bring up an 

664
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,821
interesting point,
but to say that we again throw away all 

665
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:03,910
these papers cause they are biased it.
Lastly,

666
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:08,911
and I'm done multivariate analysis.
Chris was just talking about better 

667
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:12,301
studies that factor all this stuff.
Let's not bore your audience was 

668
00:32:12,301 --> 00:32:13,480
statistics statistics,
but there's certainly the ability now to

669
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:18,481
say,
does animal protein associated with an 

670
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:21,841
increased risk of cancer and put in 
smoking and weight and diabetes and 

671
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:23,860
blood pressure and vegetable intake and 
alcohol intake and family history,

672
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,250
and then you just isolate the one thing 
is their foibles.

673
00:32:27,251 --> 00:32:28,540
Are There downsides?
Of course,

674
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:33,310
but all modern epidemiology does 
multivariate analysis to try and isolate

675
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:33,700
it.
You know,

676
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:37,520
you can cast stones everywhere,
but you know there are the,

677
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:42,530
you know,
the world health organization mean 

678
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:42,530
there's 21.
Organizations

679
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,570
say limit your saturated fat in your 
diet and none that are international 

680
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,580
society say increase at soap,
you put it.

681
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,870
Nutrition science needs incorporate as 
much as you can with as much reliability

682
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,380
and at the end of the day you can see 
we'll still have questions,

683
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:59,320
but I can't threaten us.
Used to say don't eat much cholesterol.

684
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,340
Now they don't.
They used to say limit your total fat 

685
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,851
and now they don't.
It's wrong because they've gone out is 

686
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:06,851
wrong.
actually,

687
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:10,400
the usta says in the guideline,
eat as little cholesterol is not a 

688
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,501
nutrient of concern because they 
couldn't identify the exact milligrams 

689
00:33:14,501 --> 00:33:14,770
to recommend.
Used to be 300.

690
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,070
The science doesn't support it's 
emitting dietary cholesterol anymore.

691
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:23,270
Let me go back to the the limit 
cholesterol.

692
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,340
Limit cholesterol to as little as 
possible.

693
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:27,020
I mean,
what's this thing?

694
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,640
Who is the usda?
Usda,

695
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:31,040
usda.
The guidelines come out every five years

696
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:35,240
and they are in used for school menus 
and hospital menus.

697
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,450
it was a big buzz in 2016 was announced.
They no Longer were giving a so many 

698
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,440
miLligrams of cholesterol day.
You'd never exceed.

699
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:44,150
They said,
we can't pick the number.

700
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:49,210
Usd a behind the cUrve in termS of a 
little bit influential.

701
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,820
Total mortality is the most important 
end point we should be talking about 

702
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:54,980
here.
That means deaths from any cause.

703
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,510
Okay,
so if,

704
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,640
because that's what we care about most,
right?

705
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,370
If,
if I die of a,

706
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,310
you know,
if,

707
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,580
if I,
if an intervention reduces the risk of a

708
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:06,890
heart attack but increases the risk of 
cancer,

709
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,710
I'm not happy with that.
In fact,

710
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:11,720
I'd rather go out,
have a heart attack,

711
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,900
and so you need to consider a total 
mortality and if something,

712
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,500
you know,
if meat increases the risk of cancer and

713
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:26,501
cancer mortality,
then why aren't we seeing that in the 

714
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:26,720
studies that compared lifespan with 
vegetarians and omnivores?

715
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,400
We have,
as I said,

716
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:33,080
we have a five studies that did a better
job of controlling for that healthy user

717
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:35,240
bias and there was no difference in any 
of those studies.

718
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:40,241
There is not a single study that showed 
that compared relatively equivalent 

719
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:45,191
groups of people that shows that 
vegetarians or vegans have a lifespan 

720
00:34:45,191 --> 00:34:45,470
advantage period.
There is not.

721
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,830
And so if you know red meat isn't.
If we're saying red meat,

722
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,160
processed meat increases the risk of 
cancer by 18 percent,

723
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,650
maybe,
maybe not,

724
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,080
but that's not showing up in any of the 
total.

725
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,870
The total mortality data.
The second thing,

726
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:01,900
and this is a really good example of 
what we talked about,

727
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:05,000
the very beginning of the show context 
is everything.

728
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,580
Quality is more important than quantity.
So let's talk.

729
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:12,610
Let's think about processed meat.
So there's several proposed mechanisms 

730
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,640
for how processed meat causes cancer.

731
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,560
One is that it increases and nitros,
so compounds or [inaudible],

732
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,460
which damage damage,
the gut lining,

733
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:20,920
and others that,
uh,

734
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,960
they,
when you cook meat at a high 

735
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:25,960
temperatures,
at forums,

736
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,170
heterocyclic,
any means or hcas which damaged the gut.

737
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,680
Another is that the heme iron content in
meat causes oxidative stress and 

738
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:39,190
increases the risk of cancer that way.
And then there's and new five gc.

739
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,990
But let me just give you a few examples 
of why context is important.

740
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,560
So there's evidence that chlorophyll 
rich green vegetables prevent myoglobin 

741
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:51,960
from being turned into end nitros.
So compound.

742
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:56,730
So if you're eating processed meat but 
you're also eating kale and broccoli,

743
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,760
then it's not going to have the same 
effect on the body as if you're just 

744
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,241
eating a hot dog.
I'm cruciferous vegetables and spices 

745
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:09,321
and marinades have been shown to reduce 
the formation of heterocyclic amines or 

746
00:36:09,321 --> 00:36:09,321
hta.

747
00:36:09,321 --> 00:36:14,060
So same thing if you're,
if you're marinating meat or if you're 

748
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,870
eating broccoli and cruciferous 
vegetables with meat,

749
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:20,930
it's not going to have the same impact.
There are several studies have shown 

750
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,501
that eating fruits and vegetables 
attenuates the oxidative capacity of 

751
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:26,220
heme iron and even reduces the 
absorption of heme iron in the gut.

752
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,090
And,
uh,

753
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,440
you know,
dietary antioxidants have been shown to 

754
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,550
reduce the risk of gastric cancer.
So heme iron intake,

755
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:38,400
really you can think of it as a proxy 
for a crappy diet.

756
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:43,430
In these observational studies,
there was a quote from a study that did 

757
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:48,081
find a relationship with heme iron and 
cardiovascular disease and the but the 

758
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,810
study,
the study author himself said,

759
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:56,990
with respect to heme iron intake,
we found a significant association only 

760
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,040
in the studies that were based on 
american cohorts.

761
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,560
They didn't find an association than the
Netherlands,

762
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:02,550
Canada,
France,

763
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,570
Italy,
Japan,

764
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:08,571
and Sweden,
which suggests that it's because of the 

765
00:37:08,571 --> 00:37:08,571
standard crappy american diet.

766
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:13,580
You know,
most people are eating processed meat 

767
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,560
in,
in the us are eating it in the form of 

768
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,010
hot dogs and all kinds of other 
unhealthy foods.

769
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:22,011
Sugar.
And it's another example of how that 

770
00:37:22,011 --> 00:37:24,030
user.
But I'm not saying I'm open to the 

771
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,390
possibility that too much processed meat
can be problematic,

772
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,690
but you have to consider the context.
It's not going to have the same effect 

773
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,381
if someone's eating a ton of fruits and 
vegetables versus someone who's on a 

774
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:36,450
standard american diet and we have no 
studies that separate that out.

775
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:41,530
Okay.
I think we have a gong moment because I 

776
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,820
really want your listeners to come away 
with a few tips from chris and I that 

777
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,391
make a difference because I know your 
listeners aren't going to stop eating 

778
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:47,391
meat at the end of the show.
They might.

779
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:51,500
Chris just said meat with vegetables is 
safer.

780
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,770
The meat without vegetables.

781
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,110
Meat with chlorophyll is safe for the 
meat without.

782
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:56,290
I can give you a cardiac study.
Said,

783
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:56,780
agree.
I.

784
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,240
I teach process me.
Well,

785
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,490
it's all made.
I teach the same.

786
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,180
No.
Listen,

787
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,770
we agree here.
I want people to hear this,

788
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,270
but doing.
When you grill,

789
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:08,610
how many people in the audience grill 
barbecue?

790
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,380
Everybody.
If you grill meat,

791
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,980
another chemical group that's formed are
called advanced glycation end products.

792
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:18,981
Age to go along with the list,
but if you grill meat that's marinated 

793
00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:21,900
and this was the tip in dark beer,
this is science randomized science.

794
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:24,620
You put a piece of beef in dark beer and
your grill it.

795
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,990
You don't create as many of these toxic 
chemicals as a dry piece of beef.

796
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,200
So let's.
Let's like right now everybody 

797
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,200
listening,
next time you eat meat,

798
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,350
get a salad.
Next time we meet order broccoli.

799
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:35,900
Next time you have get a

800
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,590
get a,
you know,

801
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,490
slice tomatoes,
you will actually improve your health.

802
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,390
There's this classic announced shift 
into cardiology that they took a healthy

803
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:46,120
volunteers and they took them down to 
the hospital cafeteria and they fed them

804
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:51,330
a hospital burger and they were 
measuring on their arm how there are 

805
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:51,700
arteries function,
cardiology topic,

806
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,710
artery function goes down in three 
hours.

807
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:58,711
We needed a hospital Burger.
It x like you just had a toxin in your 

808
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:58,711
body.
You did.

809
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,160
They took the same group.
A week later they had them meet the same

810
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:03,010
burger with a big salad.
They didn't see that finding.

811
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,490
I mean,
I want this to be an important point and

812
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,650
every body should be jamming fruits and 
vegetables or at least the vegetables 

813
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:13,180
with some fruits.
You can go low glycaemic berries.

814
00:39:13,181 --> 00:39:15,100
I'm fine with papayas,
cantaloupe,

815
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:20,101
and apples,
but you know up your veggies listeners 

816
00:39:20,101 --> 00:39:23,730
and you'll counteract lot of the crap 
that's out there in the world and it's 

817
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:23,730
an important message.

818
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:23,990
I don't disagree with that.
No,

819
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,150
you wouldn't.
You have to.

820
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,610
We'd glossed over this very quickly in 
the beginning of this,

821
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:32,611
but there was a dispute about 
cholesterol and a dispute about 

822
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:32,611
saturated fat.
Ah,

823
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,040
sears.
You were saying that saturated fat,

824
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,810
that there's recommendations to reduce 
saturated fat and reduced cholesterol.

825
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:45,811
So let,
let me go real quick overview and I'm 

826
00:39:45,811 --> 00:39:45,811
going to talk fast.
So just normal.

827
00:39:45,811 --> 00:39:46,660
Yeah,
it was plenty of time.

828
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,870
It was felt so until the forties.
It was not common to have a heart 

829
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,350
attack.
Heart attacks were described in 1916.

830
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:58,530
Not to say that didn't happen,
but the first medical article that used 

831
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,020
the word myocardial infarction 19,
16,

832
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:04,260
1940.
There were not many heart attacks seen 

833
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:04,360
in a modern american city.
After world war two,

834
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:07,840
we are economy went up in the city of 
minneapolis.

835
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,330
Executives started suffering heart 
attacks.

836
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,630
It was also franklin delano roosevelt 
died of high blood pressure.

837
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,820
A few years later,
eisenhower had a massive heart attack.

838
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:21,060
That's when our government,
national institutes of health started 

839
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,911
funneling major money into studies like 
the framingham study or from newton 

840
00:40:23,911 --> 00:40:25,420
framingham's,
the city outside of boston,

841
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:28,270
and they basically invaded this town in 
1958.

842
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,510
Today is that we're spending money.
We're going to figure this crap out.

843
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,540
The idea had come up.
Heart disease wasn't just aging.

844
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:37,540
Heart disease could be explained by 
what's called risk factors.

845
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,090
Smoking might not.
You can smoke and live to a hundred,

846
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:45,091
but it's going to increase your risk and
then the gun to blood pressure and 

847
00:40:45,091 --> 00:40:47,791
cholesterol and a family history.
They identified what we call risk 

848
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:49,660
factors,
so until that point,

849
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:51,940
diet was not considered a factor in the 
development.

850
00:40:51,941 --> 00:40:54,220
The number one killer of men and women I
want to point out,

851
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:56,230
and chris puts this on his website.
I do too.

852
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,440
During this interview,
every 39 seconds and american dies of 

853
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,570
heart disease every 39 second most 
frequent cause of death,

854
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:09,571
so there will be about 200 people 
perhaps that will die during this 

855
00:41:09,571 --> 00:41:09,571
podcast.

856
00:41:09,571 --> 00:41:11,170
The number one killer and 80 percent of 
it's preventable.

857
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,560
Chris is going to prevent some.
I'm going to prevent some because the 

858
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:16,560
biggest enemy out there smoking and 
crap,

859
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,060
diet,
calorie rich and processed foods,

860
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:20,020
crap,
sad diet,

861
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:25,021
standard american diet.
It becAme apparent in the early 19 

862
00:41:25,021 --> 00:41:28,150
fifties diet might play a role and a 
notorious scientists and many others.

863
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:30,220
His name dr.
Ancil keys,

864
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,860
phd,
phd at two of them suggested dietary fat

865
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:36,050
might be a factor.
It was a hypothesis.

866
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:39,560
It says early stage epidemiology doesn't
prove anything.

867
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,920
He went out and did studies.
Other people went out and did studies 

868
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,910
and the idea of transitioned actually he
was criticized for saying dietary fat.

869
00:41:46,911 --> 00:41:51,911
That is the conversation transition.
There's some good fats like omega three 

870
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,560
fatty acids are essential.
You have to have them,

871
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:58,550
and then maybe polyunsaturated fats from
plants are more helpful,

872
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:02,270
but the focus went on saturated fat in 
food,

873
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:03,350
which is bacon,
chicken,

874
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:04,850
red meat,
pizza.

875
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,070
Those are the highest sources.
And,

876
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:09,230
um,
subsequently enough data accumulated.

877
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:14,231
That guideline started to suggest we've 
got this huge problem with heart 

878
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:17,441
disease.
We should limit saturated fat in the 

879
00:42:17,441 --> 00:42:19,181
diet.
It was never limit off that 35 percent 

880
00:42:19,181 --> 00:42:19,310
of calories that's not in anybody's 
word,

881
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:22,040
a low fat diet.
Um,

882
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,510
and that has now promulgated in 21 
international statements,

883
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:29,510
there is no opposite whether it's a 
world health organization,

884
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:31,760
the american heart association,
american college of cardiology,

885
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:34,310
whether it's an institute of institute 
of medicine,

886
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:37,070
says eat as little saturated fat as 
possible.

887
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:38,750
They couldn't be more clear.
And these are high brow.

888
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:44,020
These are not associated with vegan 
movements or paleo movements or 

889
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,810
whatever.
These are medical authorities.

890
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:47,180
If there was half and half,
you'd say controversy,

891
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:52,181
21 to 21 say the same thing,
they might pick a different cutoff 

892
00:42:52,181 --> 00:42:55,451
point,
but we will enhance the health and cut 

893
00:42:55,451 --> 00:42:55,451
down the number one killer,
whether it's in asia,

894
00:42:55,451 --> 00:42:55,850
whether the job,
whether it's Australia,

895
00:42:55,851 --> 00:43:00,851
whether it's a in the United States,
there's unanimity in why did they come 

896
00:43:00,851 --> 00:43:03,530
to the basic science?

897
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,740
Because there is basic science and let 
me tell you that when you eat foods rich

898
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:08,480
and saturated fat,
which is called meat,

899
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,410
cheese,
eggs,

900
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:12,740
and such receptors on your liver for 
cholesterol,

901
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,420
I've got cholesterol,
my blood,

902
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:17,450
I'd like to get some of it out into the 
liver to be metabolized.

903
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,640
I need a receptor.
You eat saturated fats.

904
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:22,130
Receptors go down.
Cholesterol has no place to go.

905
00:43:22,131 --> 00:43:24,470
Cholesterol stays In the blood,
bumps into your artery wall.

906
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:27,710
I'm putting a stent in yardi.
That's the basic biochemistry.

907
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,230
Then they had epidemiology studies,
flawed.

908
00:43:30,231 --> 00:43:31,580
Perfect.
It doesn't matter.

909
00:43:31,581 --> 00:43:33,390
There was.
Whoa,

910
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:33,980
chris,
chris,

911
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:36,600
thank you very much.
Then they did controlled trials.

912
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,960
Three.
Everybody just go read clark.

913
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,100
Nineteen 97 slash 395.
It's called metabolic studies,

914
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,140
changed the diet.
See what happens.

915
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,260
You add saturated fat,
cholesterol skyrockets on average,

916
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:53,261
not in a single person.
If I give you a state christmas taken 

917
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:53,480
mistake,
our cluster would rise differently.

918
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,710
It would rise.
It would rise differently.

919
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:57,350
It's our microbiome,
it's our genetics.

920
00:43:57,351 --> 00:43:58,940
It would rise,
so it.

921
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,700
That's a problem in the studies when you
average everything together.

922
00:44:01,701 --> 00:44:06,701
So they had that and then finally,
finally they looked at populations that 

923
00:44:06,701 --> 00:44:10,091
live over 100.
These are called the pillars of 

924
00:44:10,091 --> 00:44:11,981
longevity.
They don't eat foods rich in saturated 

925
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:11,981
fat.
They have a little,

926
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:13,280
they don't have a lot.
They eat a lot of olive oil in Italy and

927
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:18,281
Greece.
They eat almost no dietary fat in 

928
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:18,281
okinawa,
Japan and they live.

929
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:19,340
They have the greatest longevity in the 
world.

930
00:44:19,341 --> 00:44:21,890
In 1970,
they almost no dietary fat.

931
00:44:21,891 --> 00:44:23,000
About six,
seven percent.

932
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:23,600
Okay.
All right.

933
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,720
Well no,
it'S actually.

934
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:31,721
That is the basis for a major push to 
say cut back on animal products

935
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,360
because that's largely with the 
exception of coconut and palm.

936
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:40,590
We're saturated fat comes from so that 
to tiffany gate,

937
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:44,370
that is to throw out every major health 
agency in the world.

938
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:46,170
And I don't believe chris kresser can do
that.

939
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:51,200
No disrespect.
I don't think chris can throw out a 

940
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,290
hundred years of cluster.
Let's back up a little bit here.

941
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,400
Yeah.
So,

942
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:54,510
um,
first of all,

943
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,960
every food that we consume has all of 
the fats in it,

944
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:01,290
polyunsaturated,
monounsaturated and saturated fat.

945
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,860
And in fact,
two tablespoons of olive oil has more 

946
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:06,900
saturated fat than a seven ounce pork 
chop.

947
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,250
That's a little known fact.
The oily fish macro,

948
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,460
which all of these health agencies that 
joel was talking about advises us to 

949
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:20,091
eat,
has twice the total fat in one and a 

950
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:21,690
half times the saturated fat that we're 
of the meat that we're told to avoid.

951
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:27,180
Um,
does it make sense that nature would 

952
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,571
include the,
that you could eat a macro and the 

953
00:45:29,571 --> 00:45:30,600
polyunsaturated fats in it are good for 
you,

954
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:32,970
but the saturated fat in it is bad for 
you.

955
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,150
That'S kind of nonsensical.
But you know,

956
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,880
let's talk a little bit more about the 
research.

957
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:43,881
So there never really was good evidence 
to suggest that dietary cholesterol and 

958
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:48,060
saturated fat are connected to heart 
disease.

959
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:50,410
And zoe heart comb,
who's a,

960
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,120
has a phd in nutritional researcher,
she wrote her thesis,

961
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:59,121
her phd thesis on the evidence back in 
the seventies that led to the 

962
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:04,020
restrictions on a saturated fat and 
cholesterol.

963
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,380
And then she also reviewed the evidence.
You're all the way up until the 2016.

964
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:11,380
And,
and if,

965
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,490
uh,
I have this information on my website,

966
00:46:14,491 --> 00:46:16,530
if you go to [inaudible] dot com slash 
rogan,

967
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:21,860
you can find it and what you'll find is 
there never was in really good evidence 

968
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,440
to support the limitations on die on 
saturated fat and cholesterol.

969
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,620
And people have started to look at this 
more recently.

970
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,050
And uh,
for example,

971
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:36,051
you have a meta analysis of 
observational studies including about 

972
00:46:36,051 --> 00:46:40,611
350,000
participants recently that found no 

973
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:43,290
relationship between saturated fat 
intake and cardiovascular disease.

974
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:47,700
You have an exhaustive review of 
studies,

975
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:50,850
something like 25 randomized controlled 
trials,

976
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,230
gold standard of clinical evidence.
And it's almost 40 observational studies

977
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,990
involving 650,000
participants.

978
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,240
And I'll read you a quote from the 
conclusion,

979
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:05,810
current evidence does not clearly 
support cardiovascular guidelines that 

980
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:09,621
encourage high consumption of 
polyunsaturated fatty acids and low 

981
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:11,190
consumption of saturated fatty acids.
Now,

982
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:16,191
look,
one of my favorite quotes is the 

983
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:18,530
philosopher anatoly France,
even a $50 million people say a foolish 

984
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:18,750
thing.
It's still a foolish thing.

985
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:24,650
And the other thing to consider is that 
the history of science is really the 

986
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:28,470
history of most scientists being wrong 
about most things most of the time.

987
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:29,910
and,
uh,

988
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:34,930
you know,
in science we have to continually 

989
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:35,860
challenge our hypotheses and try to 
falsify them.

990
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:38,110
And that'S how the scientific process 
moves forward.

991
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,480
And that's why in 2010,
theu ,

992
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:44,560
s federal government removed 
restrictions on total fat.

993
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,940
Whereas before There was a restriction 
on total fat because they,

994
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:52,660
they acknowledged that the research was 
showing that not all fat is the same and

995
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:54,040
that,
you know,

996
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:58,120
we don't need to be restricting fat from
avocados and things like that.

997
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,480
And in 2015,
they removed the restriction on dietary 

998
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,300
cholesterol.
Now they did that fairly quietly because

999
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:09,301
how do you think it looks when people 
have been told to limit their fat and 

1000
00:48:09,301 --> 00:48:13,210
limit their cholesterol and then the 
federal agency goes back on that,

1001
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,290
that recommendation after so many years 
of telling people to do that,

1002
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:19,960
people lose faith in the agencies that 
are,

1003
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,260
that are issuing these guidelines and 
don't take it for me.

1004
00:48:23,261 --> 00:48:23,920
you know,
I'm,

1005
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,800
I'm,
I'm not expecting anyone to believe me,

1006
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:31,801
and that's why I put all of the studies 
and the research supporting this at 

1007
00:48:31,801 --> 00:48:34,930
[inaudible] dot com slash rogan,
but how about johnny enedis,

1008
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:38,560
who's one of the most renowned 
epidemiologists in the world?

1009
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,790
He's a professor of medicine at stanford
and he has wrote some written,

1010
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:47,791
some scathing critiques of nutritional 
research recently that had been 

1011
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:48,880
published in jama and british medical 
journal.

1012
00:48:48,881 --> 00:48:52,540
So here's a quote from one of them,
some nutrition scientist and much of the

1013
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:57,541
public often consider epidemiological 
associations of nutritional factors to 

1014
00:48:57,541 --> 00:49:00,640
represent causal effects that can inform
public health policy and guidelines.

1015
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:06,120
However,
the emerging picture of nutritional 

1016
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,660
epidemiology is difficult to reconcile 
with good scientific principles.

1017
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:13,020
The field needs radical reform and he 
goes on to point out that med analyses 

1018
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:18,931
of observational studies have found that
almost all foods are associated with a 

1019
00:49:18,931 --> 00:49:21,070
higher risk of death if you crunch the 
data in certain ways.

1020
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:22,690
So,
uh,

1021
00:49:22,691 --> 00:49:24,760
it's not enough to say that,
you know,

1022
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:30,090
governments are recommending this or 
that we have to look at the science and 

1023
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:30,880
what the science is saying.
And as I said,

1024
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:36,250
you two recent med analysis covering 
over a million people are not showing a 

1025
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:41,011
relationship between saturated fat and 
heart disease and they're not showing 

1026
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:44,110
any benefit from replacing saturated fat
with polyunsaturated fats.

1027
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:46,400
So these organizations,
joel,

1028
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,940
you were describing,
why do you think that they recommend,

1029
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:54,970
based on what chris has just said,
why do you think that they recommend 

1030
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:55,370
reducing your saturated fat?
Reducing your cholesterol?

1031
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:56,250
Okay.
Um,

1032
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,610
and thank you and you know,
the important here,

1033
00:49:58,611 --> 00:50:02,170
which we are technical in the weeds,
but I want to bring it back.

1034
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,280
This discussion is,
do you have a stroke,

1035
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:05,840
heart attack,
erectile dysfunction,

1036
00:50:05,841 --> 00:50:07,850
lose a leg,
or do you not?

1037
00:50:07,851 --> 00:50:12,851
Because at least one factor in 
development of these horrible medical 

1038
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:13,220
problems that are 80 percent 
preventable,

1039
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,830
at least one of it is nutrition and the 
continuity.

1040
00:50:15,831 --> 00:50:16,370
Nutrition.
I mean,

1041
00:50:16,371 --> 00:50:18,620
there's no doubt it's the single most 
important factor.

1042
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:22,820
It's never been the only fact that 
organizations are saying this.

1043
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,120
He's saying social studies don't support
that.

1044
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,120
Well,
uh,

1045
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,040
I disagree.
The science and

1046
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,470
I want to be very specific.
Let's talk about cholesterol.

1047
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:33,290
Let's talk about saturated fat.
So stay with saturated fat because there

1048
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:35,760
is differences there.
They're both,

1049
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:36,260
uh,
you know,

1050
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:39,140
contents of food,
fatty contents of food,

1051
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:40,790
but they're chemically different in the 
volume.

1052
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:41,990
Weight is very,
very different.

1053
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,920
Cholesterol only comes from animal 
saturated fat as animals and plants 

1054
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,520
depending on the food source.
So when this rise in heart attacks 

1055
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,160
developed,
research began 19,

1056
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:54,110
48 and 1950,
1958.

1057
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,880
There were observations made that 
carefully done dietary logs,

1058
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,900
suggested these were hypotheses.
There might be a connection between what

1059
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:05,000
you eat and heart attacks.
And then it's centered on,

1060
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:05,890
um,
you know,

1061
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,330
is it foods high in protein,
foods,

1062
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,200
high sugar,
foods,

1063
00:51:09,201 --> 00:51:14,201
high in fatty sources.
Ultimately they get sophisticated foods 

1064
00:51:14,201 --> 00:51:16,190
high in plant fat sources,
foods high in animal fat sources,

1065
00:51:16,191 --> 00:51:21,191
so by the late 19 fifties there was a 
very strong consensus already that foods

1066
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:24,890
high in animal products with saturated 
fat.

1067
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,110
They go together.
We're talking to meat,

1068
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,400
egg and cheese may be a role.
Why?

1069
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,470
Let me give you a great example.
in 1959,

1070
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,040
you grew up in Japan.
You have a cholesterol of 120.

1071
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:39,070
You almost never see a heart attack.
You moved to Hawaii because there's 

1072
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,400
migration.
Your cholesterol rises to a hundred 80.

1073
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,500
Welcome to America.
Your heart attack,

1074
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:44,750
risk triples.
You move to this great city,

1075
00:51:44,751 --> 00:51:47,030
los angeles,
this was published in 1959.

1076
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:52,210
Your cholesterol is now 2:10.
You have 10 times the heart attack risk 

1077
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,570
that you had when you lived in Japan.
Genetics don't change that quick.

1078
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:56,230
This was within one generation.
They're called nisei.

1079
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:58,340
People that leave Japan to move to 
California,

1080
00:51:58,341 --> 00:52:00,090
the nisei,
and there's the knee say,

1081
00:52:00,091 --> 00:52:00,920
hon,
study that.

1082
00:52:00,921 --> 00:52:02,120
Track these people.
now,

1083
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:07,360
is that the air?
Is it that they adopted other bad 

1084
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:07,360
habits?
Shirt could be,

1085
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,070
but within a very short time that 10 
times the risk of heart attack,

1086
00:52:10,071 --> 00:52:15,071
so public research and dollars,
this stuff is correlated with animal 

1087
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:16,160
fats and proteins.

1088
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:21,370
Why isn't correlated with sugar and 
refined carbohydrates so carefully done 

1089
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:25,781
studies say,
and I think we all agree more so now 

1090
00:52:25,781 --> 00:52:29,381
because we're overweight and now we're 
more insulin resistant and added sugars 

1091
00:52:29,381 --> 00:52:33,671
in the diet are more important in 2018 
than they were when in the country was 

1092
00:52:33,671 --> 00:52:34,850
thin in 1960.
They weren't good then.

1093
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,590
They aren't good now,
but when you parse it out,

1094
00:52:36,591 --> 00:52:41,591
multivariate analysis,
there's a stronger relationship between 

1095
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,920
the number one.
food in studies like this is usually 

1096
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:44,960
butter more than red meat.
It's actually butter.

1097
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,480
That's just at our value.
It's called statistic.

1098
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:49,130
I don't want to go so deep into 
statistics.

1099
00:52:49,131 --> 00:52:52,490
It is somewhere there is sugar.
I'll give you a classic study.

1100
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,840
If you could hold sugar the same and 
increased dietary saturated fat,

1101
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:56,840
heart disease,
rockets.

1102
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:58,460
If you could hold saturated fat,
the same.

1103
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:01,910
Increased sugar in these manipulations.
Coronary heart disease doesn't increase.

1104
00:53:01,911 --> 00:53:04,490
Let's point something out.
I've been inside of hearts 15,000

1105
00:53:04,491 --> 00:53:09,491
times.
I've never scooped sugar out of a 

1106
00:53:09,491 --> 00:53:09,491
blocked artery as scooped cholesterol 
out of blocked arteries.

1107
00:53:09,491 --> 00:53:11,870
Twenty percent of every blockage in a 
heart is cholesterol.

1108
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:15,620
So fact that was discovered in 1910.
It's never varied.

1109
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:19,040
Then we fed animal.
Let's pause for a second,

1110
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:20,390
chris,
you have something to say about that?

1111
00:53:20,391 --> 00:53:25,391
Yeah,
so that doesn't mean that the 

1112
00:53:25,391 --> 00:53:25,391
cholesterol is there because people were
eating it.

1113
00:53:25,391 --> 00:53:26,120
Joel,
you know That could be though

1114
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,200
that let.
Let's say,

1115
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,570
let's look at what the research says 
again here.

1116
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:35,571
So they've done controlled feeding 
studies where they fed people two to 

1117
00:53:35,571 --> 00:53:38,571
four eggs a day and those show that in 
75 percent of cases that has zero impact

1118
00:53:39,331 --> 00:53:42,900
on blood cholesterol levels for the 
other 25 percent of people,

1119
00:53:42,901 --> 00:53:47,901
they're termed hyper responders and in 
that group dietary cholesterol or does 

1120
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:52,971
modestly increase ldl cholesterol,
but it also increases hdl cholesterol 

1121
00:53:52,971 --> 00:53:54,000
and it does not increase the risk of 
heart disease.

1122
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:59,510
This is why the guidelines were changed 
on dietary cholesterol is there is no 

1123
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:04,850
evidence that they're consuming dietary 
cholesterol increases the risk of blood 

1124
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:07,080
cholesterol and most people,
and even when it does,

1125
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:09,660
there's no evidence that it increases 
the risk of a heart attack,

1126
00:54:09,661 --> 00:54:14,190
which is again why the dietary 
guidelines change for saturated fat.

1127
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,520
Again,
it most of the studies that showed harm 

1128
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:19,520
work,
short term studies,

1129
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,870
these longer term studies have shown 
that on average eating saturated fat 

1130
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:28,671
does not increase saturated fat levels 
in the blood and have all of the long 

1131
00:54:28,671 --> 00:54:31,560
term studies that looked at this.

1132
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:36,560
Only one showed any association between 
saturated fat intake and cholesterol 

1133
00:54:37,651 --> 00:54:40,680
levels in the blood.
Then we have a med analysis,

1134
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:45,740
lots of meta analyses actually,
but one of the best known met analysis 

1135
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:51,141
was of 17 randomized controlled trials 
of low carb diets that were high in 

1136
00:54:51,141 --> 00:54:54,960
saturated fats in published in the 
journal of obesity reviews,

1137
00:54:55,530 --> 00:55:00,530
and they found that low carb diets 
neither increase nor decrease ldl 

1138
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,530
cholesterol,
but what they did find was that low carb

1139
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:06,531
diets are associated with decrease in 
body weight improvements in several 

1140
00:55:06,531 --> 00:55:08,490
cardiovascular risks.
Risk factors including triglycerides,

1141
00:55:08,491 --> 00:55:10,260
fasting glucose,
blood pressure,

1142
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,600
body mass index,
abdominal circumference,

1143
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:13,440
plasma,
insulin,

1144
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:18,480
c reactive protein,
as well as an increase in hdl 

1145
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:18,480
cholesterol.
Now,

1146
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,211
there hAve now been 10 meta analysis of 
randomized controlled trials looking at 

1147
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:29,301
low carb diets for weight loss.
all 10 showed that the low carb diet 

1148
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:35,930
either outperformed in most cases or was
was on this at the same level as low fat

1149
00:55:36,331 --> 00:55:36,870
diets.

1150
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:42,290
There have been several metta analyses 
now you can see them all at [inaudible] 

1151
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:45,711
dot com slash rogan that have looked at 
a low carb diets for diabetes and 

1152
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,280
cardiovascular risk markers and all of 
these meta analyses have found that low 

1153
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,020
carb diets are superior for glycaemic 
control,

1154
00:55:55,021 --> 00:55:57,600
for reducing insulin,
for reducing triglycerides,

1155
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,900
and have beneficial effects across the 
board without increasing cardiovascular 

1156
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:07,731
risk markers.
So we're now we're talking about 

1157
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,801
randomized control trials,
which is the best form of evidence that 

1158
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:11,440
we have and we're not seeing any harm 
from ink,

1159
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,040
you know,
increased consumption of saturated fat.

1160
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,030
So it was the problem that you're citing
epidemiology studies from the 19 forties

1161
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:23,050
in the 19 fifties was that definitely.
I think we need to to to prefer

1162
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:27,340
randomized controlled trials over that 
kind of evidence for sure.

1163
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,680
Why do you continue to go back to these 
studies from the 1940 and 19 fifties was

1164
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:37,170
beginning though the beginning,
but chris just took 14 topics and put 

1165
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:39,580
them into one for meta analysis during 
them as controls.

1166
00:56:39,581 --> 00:56:40,690
The low carb,
low fat.

1167
00:56:40,691 --> 00:56:45,691
I mean they're all different topics and 
I don't know how you put that all 

1168
00:56:45,691 --> 00:56:46,810
together.
You need clarity and laser focused.

1169
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:49,360
So we were talking saturated fat.
I mean,

1170
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:52,720
so hypothesis has generated saturated 
fat in the diet.

1171
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:57,721
Butter,
eggs and cheese may be bad for heart 

1172
00:56:57,721 --> 00:56:59,401
disease,
something killing americans left to 

1173
00:56:59,401 --> 00:57:01,351
right in 1949 slash 50.
Let's go into countries with widely 

1174
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:01,351
different diets.
Let's see what they're eating.

1175
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:04,030
Let's actually take their frigging diet 
back to minneapolis.

1176
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:09,090
Let's analyze it so it's not guessing.
Not food frequency questionnaires were 

1177
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:09,090
taking their meals back.

1178
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,050
The United States analyze them,
but boom,

1179
00:57:11,051 --> 00:57:14,710
there's a relationship between dietary 
saturated fat and your risk.

1180
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:17,100
Fifty year followup,
there's no short term followup.

1181
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:22,130
The study I'm referring to as 50 year 
1958 to now and um,

1182
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:27,570
that strongly suggested that dietary 
saturated fat and heart disease that 

1183
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:31,741
doesn't,
that's not what's called the ultimate 

1184
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:33,900
randomized clinical study,
but it's one of high quality second 

1185
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,070
study done in China at the same time 
with years of followup.

1186
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:40,080
So these are right up to date.
There's publications right now from 

1187
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:40,390
studies starting at then,
but the publications are now,

1188
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:43,420
but then you get the best kind of study.
Okay,

1189
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:46,000
I'm still unsaturated saturated fat.
I'm not talking any other topic.

1190
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:49,810
You put people in a metabolic ward at 
the national institute of health,

1191
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:54,730
395 of these studies published in 1979.
You change their diet.

1192
00:57:54,731 --> 00:57:58,720
This is the ultimate careful experiment.
It might be for four weeks or six weeks,

1193
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:00,340
you up their saturated fat.

1194
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:03,430
Their cholesterol rises assures can be,
we're all different.

1195
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:06,580
The change in cholesterol is consistent.
You're going to go up 20 percent,

1196
00:58:06,581 --> 00:58:07,510
20 percent,
20 percent.

1197
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:12,511
We start at different points.
You have to track the change in 

1198
00:58:12,511 --> 00:58:13,030
clusteral.
Chris referred tO.

1199
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,660
Can I go off on a tangent?
It's really interesting,

1200
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:19,150
this will fascinate your listeners,
but it's right on the topic.

1201
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:22,300
Two thousand and eight.
This is published data.

1202
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:25,390
I don't bullshit on this.
Two thousand eight Mexico city,

1203
00:58:25,391 --> 00:58:28,480
the national,
the international dairy council meet and

1204
00:58:28,481 --> 00:58:33,481
they published their notes,
which is why we know this and they said 

1205
00:58:33,481 --> 00:58:36,331
we are losing the battle.
People are eating less dairy around the 

1206
00:58:36,331 --> 00:58:36,610
world and we are losing sales.
Well,

1207
00:58:36,611 --> 00:58:39,520
we can do is influence researchers 
influence expeditions,

1208
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,320
insistent speaker.
Well,

1209
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:46,410
it's every.
Every dairy council in the world just 

1210
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:46,450
happens to meet in Mexico city that 
year.

1211
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,770
Then they go meet and Portugal.

1212
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:49,210
Then they go meet in New York,
whatever,

1213
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:52,660
2008.
We're going to put dollars into changing

1214
00:58:52,661 --> 00:58:55,780
research and influencing people.
doesn't mean it's all bad.

1215
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:59,200
They publish those notes that are global
initiative for the next year.

1216
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:04,410
They looked for sympathetic researchers 
that would change public opinion and 

1217
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,130
that was right before the milk mustache 
campaign.

1218
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:09,580
They find a gUy I actually reSpect now,
but I'm going to beat them up a little.

1219
00:59:09,581 --> 00:59:10,630
Dr.
Ronald krauss,

1220
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:11,920
md in berkeley,
California,

1221
00:59:11,921 --> 00:59:16,750
right by him runs it a liquid center.
He's had beef funding for 10 years.

1222
00:59:16,751 --> 00:59:21,751
He said dairy funding.
All of a sudden he's speaking to dairy 

1223
00:59:21,751 --> 00:59:22,220
industries all over in 2010,
two years later,

1224
00:59:22,221 --> 00:59:24,560
he publishes,
we call it a meta analysis.

1225
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:29,210
That's not new research,
that's statistical playing with previous

1226
00:59:29,211 --> 00:59:31,040
studies that can be fair,
can be unfair,

1227
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:32,270
whatever.
Whatever it is,

1228
00:59:32,271 --> 00:59:37,271
their conclusion is they could not find 
and verify that saturated fat in the 

1229
00:59:37,271 --> 00:59:37,310
diet.

1230
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:39,170
Butter,
eggs and cheese raises the risk of heart

1231
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:41,270
disease.
they never said eat butter,

1232
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:46,271
eggs and cheese.
They just couldn't verify what's 

1233
00:59:46,271 --> 00:59:48,761
amazing.
It's an american journal of clinical 

1234
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:48,761
nutrition.
That same journal is a,

1235
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:52,160
is a editorial that destroys the study.
This is 15 reasons.

1236
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:57,161
This is horrible.
Epidemiology by guy named jeremiah 

1237
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:59,921
stamler.
I've never seen a medical journal 

1238
00:59:59,921 --> 01:00:00,110
destroy a piece that they accepted for 
publication.

1239
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:05,560
Okay,
so everything's like stirred up and 

1240
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,590
2014,
a guy named chowdry publishes a similar 

1241
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:11,801
analysis.
That is the reason that time magazine 

1242
01:00:11,801 --> 01:00:13,390
put on the cover butter is back because 
it was not new research.

1243
01:00:13,391 --> 01:00:16,130
It's a meta analysis.
It's all following this Mexico city,

1244
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:21,690
uh,
effort to a fund dairy positive 

1245
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:26,291
publications,
a study so bad that both the journal 

1246
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:28,460
required them to adjust and republish 
the data because of mistakes.

1247
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,080
The harvard school of public health 
said,

1248
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:31,160
take this thing away.

1249
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,960
statistically.
This is nonsense.

1250
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,840
Since those two times,
and that's just the bottom line,

1251
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:41,010
we have had confusion in the public.
We've got experts like chris experts 

1252
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,080
like me,
experts like dr mark hyman,

1253
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,480
experts like Dr.
Walter willett audit on.

1254
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:48,890
There is a quote from the tobacco 
industry that our product is confusion.

1255
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,830
They didn't care about,
you know,

1256
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:55,870
winning the battle when the is confused 
or just going to keep on doing habits 

1257
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:58,961
they haVe.
And that has got to stop because now 

1258
01:00:58,961 --> 01:01:00,821
we're in the weeds with conspiracy 
theories to saturate so that when the 

1259
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,590
pendulum of 1950,
19,

1260
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:04,280
69,
19,

1261
01:01:04,281 --> 01:01:09,281
97,
395 of the best done studies in the 

1262
01:01:09,281 --> 01:01:09,281
world,
say you eat more saturated fat,

1263
01:01:09,281 --> 01:01:11,180
your cholesterol goes up,
more saturated fat,

1264
01:01:11,181 --> 01:01:13,330
coronary heart disease goes up.
It was clear,

1265
01:01:13,331 --> 01:01:16,100
crystal clear in the guidelines,
set the guidelines.

1266
01:01:16,101 --> 01:01:19,520
Still say it.
The guidelines still say limits what the

1267
01:01:19,521 --> 01:01:24,440
same science from the 19 fifties in the 
19 forties is applicable today.

1268
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,000
If it's in retrospect,
valid there.

1269
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:28,890
Let's point out one,
two.

1270
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:30,200
Yeah,
absolutely.

1271
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:31,640
Do you think it is?
Absolutely.

1272
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:35,150
Why?
Because just bringing this up,

1273
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,050
we're

1274
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:38,570
going back to observational studies done
50,

1275
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:43,571
60 years ago that suffer from all of the
problems that I mentioned to begin with 

1276
01:01:43,571 --> 01:01:45,140
and several more that we didn't have 
time to go into.

1277
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:48,560
Um,
we have randomized controlled trialS now

1278
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:53,650
and you know,
observational studies were never meant 

1279
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:57,310
to prove a hypothesis.
They're meant to generate a hypothesis 

1280
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:00,791
and it's true that in some cases it's 
not possible to do a randomized 

1281
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:02,180
controlled trial,
like with cigarette smoking,

1282
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:07,400
you'd have to have the trial lasts for 
so long and you'd have to isolate people

1283
01:02:07,401 --> 01:02:12,401
and award so they weren't exposed to air
pollution and other factors that can 

1284
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:12,401
affect the result.
You can't do that.

1285
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:16,310
But in that case the risk was a thousand
to 3000 percent higher.

1286
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:19,350
So there are criteria called the 
bradford hill criteria,

1287
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:24,351
which yOu can use and apply to 
observational studies to assess the 

1288
01:02:24,351 --> 01:02:25,860
chance that there's a causal 
relationship,

1289
01:02:25,861 --> 01:02:30,861
and in the case of smoking,
which actually was when the bradford 

1290
01:02:30,861 --> 01:02:34,070
bradford hill criteria were created,
that really that meets many of those 

1291
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:35,730
criteria in the case of nutrition 
research,

1292
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:40,470
very seldom did they meet more than a 
couple of the bradford hill criteria.

1293
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,570
Now observational research in order to 
be valuable and needs to be confirmed,

1294
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:50,660
you know the results need to be 
replicated in a randomized controlled 

1295
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:51,240
trial.
That's how science is supposed to work.

1296
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,720
But there was one analysis that found 
that zero of 52 claims that were made in

1297
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:02,691
observational nutrition studies were 
replicated when they were tested later 

1298
01:03:02,691 --> 01:03:07,250
and in fact,
five were replicated in the opposite 

1299
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:07,250
direction.
In other words,

1300
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:11,541
they did an experiment.
They found the opposite results of what 

1301
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:14,601
the observational studies suggested.
So a good examples of this are 

1302
01:03:14,601 --> 01:03:16,890
obserVational studies originally 
suggested that beta carotene,

1303
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:21,390
an antioxidant that people with the 
highest intake of beta carotene,

1304
01:03:21,391 --> 01:03:24,030
that's something like a 30 percent 
reduced risk of death,

1305
01:03:24,031 --> 01:03:29,031
which is not really plausible anyways,
but then when they started doing trials 

1306
01:03:29,031 --> 01:03:30,660
where they were giving people beta 
carotene,

1307
01:03:30,661 --> 01:03:35,661
sUpplements,
not only did it not improve their 

1308
01:03:35,661 --> 01:03:35,661
lifespan,
they got more cancer,

1309
01:03:35,661 --> 01:03:36,360
it increased the risK of cancer.

1310
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:41,690
So this is why it's so important not to 
rely just on observational data and to 

1311
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:43,710
do these experiments.
Now going back to saturated fat,

1312
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:49,220
as I said,
we've got a 2013 meta analysis of 

1313
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,910
randomized controlled trials that found 
that low carb,

1314
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:55,911
high protein diets lead to greater 
improvements in glycaemic control 

1315
01:03:55,911 --> 01:03:56,880
compared to low fat american heart 
association,

1316
01:03:56,881 --> 01:04:01,881
american diabetic association diets.
We've got a 2014 meta analysis of 

1317
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:07,730
randomized controlled trials that showed
that low carb diets are more effective 

1318
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:09,090
than high carb diets for patients with 
type two diabetes.

1319
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:14,450
And we've got another meta analysis of 
25 randomized controlled trials just 

1320
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:16,830
published in 2018 that found the same 
thing.

1321
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,680
So you know,
science marches on,

1322
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:20,330
we,
we,

1323
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:25,360
we learn more,
we change and now we've got randomized 

1324
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,981
controlled trials that are replacing 
some of the observational evidence from 

1325
01:04:27,981 --> 01:04:28,860
the fifties and sixties and seventies,
which,

1326
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,160
which by the way in and dr hark homes 
paper,

1327
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:36,330
you see that that evidence was never 
strong to begin with and this is what we

1328
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:37,200
should be looking at.

1329
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:40,810
So why are you consistently bringing up 
these studies for fifties?

1330
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:44,140
Because chris has mixing everything up.
He's talking low carb data.

1331
01:04:44,141 --> 01:04:49,141
Let's talk low carb diet.
That's kito diet low carb you,

1332
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,600
you consistently bring up these studies 
from the 19 fifties.

1333
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:55,240
The 19 sixties diets are high in 
saturated fat.

1334
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,630
Okay?
Nineteen 50,

1335
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:59,950
96 was the initiation.
Nineteen 97.

1336
01:04:59,951 --> 01:05:04,951
Clark 395 randomized clinical trials.
What chris looking for in metabolic 

1337
01:05:04,951 --> 01:05:09,391
ward?
Say you jack up the saturated fat in 

1338
01:05:09,391 --> 01:05:09,391
your diet.
You jack up your cholesterol.

1339
01:05:09,391 --> 01:05:09,850
We can talk about cholesterol in a 
minute,

1340
01:05:09,851 --> 01:05:12,260
but cholesterol matters.
Ldl cholesterol matters in higher ed.

1341
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:15,900
Ask asking a question.
You say 395 randomized controlled trials

1342
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:17,980
in 1997.
Clark 1,907,

1343
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,200
$395.
Met him off.

1344
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:21,790
I'd love to see that different metabolic
wards day.

1345
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:23,140
I can show you here.
It's right here.

1346
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,180
I'll give you the rest of americans.
Ninety five.

1347
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:30,210
He viewed 395,
a randomized controlled trials in a meta

1348
01:05:30,971 --> 01:05:35,230
analysis in metabolic ward.
the tightest dietary exchange studies,

1349
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,150
the best sandwich would a metabolic 
where it is,

1350
01:05:37,151 --> 01:05:40,480
but I don't understand the three 95.
That's how many were there.

1351
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:44,230
Five people now.
Three hundred 95 individual studies that

1352
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:49,231
played with fat content had died.
It looked at markers of cardiovascular 

1353
01:05:49,231 --> 01:05:52,750
risks.
395 metabolic ward studies that were 

1354
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:56,911
randomized,
randomized controlled trials in 

1355
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:56,911
metabolic wards.
Yeah,

1356
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:57,250
they're going to be short term.
That's true.

1357
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:59,170
You've got to read the literature.
It's there.

1358
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:04,200
It's there.
I've read the literature while you 

1359
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:04,200
missed that one.
That's a pretty important.

1360
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:04,200
Okay,
but let's go back,

1361
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,830
but hold on a second.
This is a dispute here,

1362
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:07,230
right?
So what is your issue with.

1363
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,110
I'll just give you.
It's no big deal.

1364
01:06:09,111 --> 01:06:12,070
I'll give chris what is your issue?
I'm not aware of 300.

1365
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:17,110
90 five randomized controlled trials 
that have been done in a metabolic ward 

1366
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:21,511
on this question,
so I'd love to learn more about that if 

1367
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:21,511
that's true.
One second.

1368
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:25,471
It's clark,
but so I mean I'm not stuck in the 19 

1369
01:06:25,471 --> 01:06:25,471
fifties,
but you know,

1370
01:06:25,471 --> 01:06:26,110
if you don't agree,

1371
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,780
right,
that science has moved far past that and

1372
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:33,781
our understanding of nutrition and our 
understanding of the mechanisms of the 

1373
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:36,640
effect of the food and the body.
All that has changed radically

1374
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:41,460
are we have not changed our flipcharts 
exchange,

1375
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:47,110
but that's not what I asked you as our 
understanding of the science change as 

1376
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:52,620
well.
Actually I would say that the 

1377
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:52,620
observations made in the fifties and 
sixties if I held up,

1378
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:57,300
which is why 21 international societies,
they'll say you will have held up that 

1379
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,030
low saturated fat in the diet.
Chicken,

1380
01:07:01,031 --> 01:07:01,780
eggs,
cheese,

1381
01:07:01,781 --> 01:07:04,960
beef is related to raising your 
cholesterol is related to your increased

1382
01:07:04,961 --> 01:07:06,430
risk of heart attacks,
strokes,

1383
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:07,650
19 fifties,

1384
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:12,700
initial initial.
Then we got randomized clinical trials.

1385
01:07:12,701 --> 01:07:15,310
Those are called metabolic ward studies 
and such.

1386
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:18,520
The first,
the first chink in the,

1387
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,570
in the armor was a 2010.
I gave you the background to it,

1388
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:25,120
the siri torino study,
the [inaudible] study,

1389
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:30,300
but they have been resolved.
We've decided to throw out 50 years of 

1390
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,820
science,
just mentioned several other med 

1391
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:35,761
analyses of I know,
probably a 50 randomized controlled 

1392
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:37,440
trials collectively here.
and these are

1393
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:39,450
modern studies.
So joel,

1394
01:07:39,451 --> 01:07:41,400
what is the difference?
Like what,

1395
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:46,430
why,
why do you think that these old studies 

1396
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:47,760
are applicable and why you dismissing 
this new evidence?

1397
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,080
okay,
so I just,

1398
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,990
just so chris and I can resolve this 
issue.

1399
01:07:51,991 --> 01:07:56,030
British medical journal in 1997,
dietary lipids and blood cholesterol.

1400
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:59,760
Three hundred 95 individual dietary 
experience,

1401
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:02,220
uh,
put together in a med analysis.

1402
01:08:02,221 --> 01:08:07,221
It's a classic study that people know 
they actually estimated if we could 

1403
01:08:07,221 --> 01:08:10,821
lower the saturated fat content of the 
british population by 60 percent and we 

1404
01:08:10,821 --> 01:08:12,660
would save x number of heart attacks.
What year?

1405
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,910
Nineteen 97.
Nineteen 97.

1406
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:19,100
So to answer your question,
why do I think old studies are relevant?

1407
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:22,160
You have to keep probing and questioning
and probing and questioning.

1408
01:08:22,161 --> 01:08:25,760
But until this date,
every major medical society,

1409
01:08:25,761 --> 01:08:27,860
not one.
If there'S one you'd question at 21,

1410
01:08:27,861 --> 01:08:31,580
international sizes say you will further
the populace health.

1411
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:36,640
If you lower saturated fat in the diet 
and we can't pinpoint the amount of 

1412
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,420
cholesterol you should lower,
which is only from animal sources,

1413
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:40,640
but you should lower it to as low as 
possible.

1414
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,860
According to the usda epidemiology 
studies,

1415
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,460
this was randomized data.
It's random.

1416
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:49,130
It's based on.
And the guidelines have changed,

1417
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:49,990
uh,
as,

1418
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:55,030
as we said in 2010,
the new evidence,

1419
01:08:55,280 --> 01:09:00,280
there's new evidence is the new science,
like whatever they've studied today,

1420
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,710
like what,
what the better methods of detection,

1421
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,950
more,
more understanding,

1422
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:10,970
more data to go from.
Wouldn't you agree that we should look 

1423
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:11,780
at new studies?
We should,

1424
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:14,540
let me tell you say so wait,
let me tell you,

1425
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:18,440
when I published a study in 2012,
that's when quoted 100,000

1426
01:09:18,441 --> 01:09:23,441
times for a major medical journal.
It uses something called men delian 

1427
01:09:23,441 --> 01:09:27,071
randomization.
We don't need to do randomized clinical 

1428
01:09:27,071 --> 01:09:29,681
trials all the time.
There are these gigantic databases now 

1429
01:09:29,681 --> 01:09:30,440
about genetic abnormalities and certain 
other parameters.

1430
01:09:30,441 --> 01:09:32,810
So there is a database with 300,000
people.

1431
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,150
We know what's called their snips.
You've probably heard of snips,

1432
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:38,210
you know chris is biology and jeans 
aren't the same as mine,

1433
01:09:38,211 --> 01:09:43,211
and there's variability if you're born 
with one of nine snips that keeps your 

1434
01:09:43,371 --> 01:09:45,170
cholesterol low your entire life.

1435
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:50,170
This is a genetic gift to you.
The observation in this major study 

1436
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:52,430
quarter all over the world,
first author is brian ferentz,

1437
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:53,540
but I'm there.
Number five,

1438
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:58,870
ldl randomization is new data that it is
an advantage for your survival and 

1439
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:59,670
advantage,
your risk of heart attack,

1440
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,790
stroke to have a low ldl,
your whole life.

1441
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:06,970
New data.
Is it consistent with 60 years of 

1442
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:06,970
science,
but boom,

1443
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:10,600
it sure was.
We actually have learned stuff that has 

1444
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,890
changed our mind when you do that same 
cutting edge science on hdl,

1445
01:10:12,891 --> 01:10:14,330
the happy one,
the high one.

1446
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,730
You cannot show the same association 
anymore.

1447
01:10:16,731 --> 01:10:21,731
We're totally confused by the hdl.
Particle ldl is the focus of 

1448
01:10:21,731 --> 01:10:25,700
atherosclerosis low ldl,
and I'll just finish dr loren cordain.

1449
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:27,500
I'd love to talk about the history of 
the paleo movement.

1450
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,900
Dr loren cordain,
who at the first popular book,

1451
01:10:29,901 --> 01:10:34,160
a phd in Colorado,
has written an article in 2004.

1452
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,160
It says the ideal ldl cholesterol is 50 
to 70.

1453
01:10:37,161 --> 01:10:42,161
Well man,
he should be a cardiologist because I'm 

1454
01:10:42,161 --> 01:10:44,141
going to hug them for that because he 
thought that saturated fat raises your 

1455
01:10:44,141 --> 01:10:47,651
blood cholesterol,
increases your risk of heart attack and 

1456
01:10:47,651 --> 01:10:47,651
stroke.
This is the founding pillars.

1457
01:10:47,651 --> 01:10:49,820
This 2004 and a big isn't a medical 
journal.

1458
01:10:49,821 --> 01:10:52,400
I mean this is peer reviewed.
It was an editorial,

1459
01:10:52,401 --> 01:10:57,401
but it's peer review of 50 to 70 ldl.
I'm really cool there with loren cordain

1460
01:10:57,501 --> 01:11:02,501
and 50 to 78,
but our understanding of nutrition is 

1461
01:11:02,501 --> 01:11:04,350
advanced pretty radically since I'm not.
Yeah.

1462
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,640
And I'm not here to represent paleo.
I mean,

1463
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,310
I never been,
uh,

1464
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,470
uh,
ideological about paleo.

1465
01:11:12,471 --> 01:11:13,860
Even if you read my first book,

1466
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,010
I'm recommending dairy products,

1467
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:19,020
but I don't want to get lost in this 
because you pause for a second.

1468
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:23,800
So what is your response though to all 
these studies that he was citing?

1469
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:28,020
You're citing these old studies that 
seem to contradict what he saying,

1470
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:31,440
but these new studies that he showing 
and you could,

1471
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:33,840
we can go over them again,
but you didn't address.

1472
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:35,550
You did

1473
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,820
well,
he didn't say saying them by name.

1474
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:46,530
What?
Why are the results so different than 

1475
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:46,530
the new studies?

1476
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:48,070
Oh,
well people better at statistics than me

1477
01:11:48,071 --> 01:11:50,750
with say manipulation of what's called 
meta analysis.

1478
01:11:50,751 --> 01:11:55,751
These aren't new studies.
I mean these are old studies lumped 

1479
01:11:55,751 --> 01:11:57,700
together with different analyses that 
led to a conclusion that was accurate.

1480
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:03,140
These are.
These are randomized controlled trials 

1481
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:04,520
that are long term.
That's 20 years,

1482
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:05,780
30 years,
40 years.

1483
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:11,070
There is no such show.
Of course they're not doing 20 or 30 or 

1484
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:11,780
40 year randomized controlled trial.
We have fish.

1485
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:16,640
We have 50 year data on seven I'll study
of 50 years.

1486
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:18,310
Problem

1487
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,960
difference,
again we've already outlined is a big 

1488
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,060
difference between epidemiology studies 
and randomized trial.

1489
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:29,680
Randomized controlled trials are not 
short term.

1490
01:12:29,681 --> 01:12:32,590
Many of them are go up to two years in 
length.

1491
01:12:32,591 --> 01:12:37,591
If we're going to see changes in lipids,
we're going to see them within a few 

1492
01:12:37,591 --> 01:12:41,520
weeks and certainly within a few months,
so if we're not seeing them in a few 

1493
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,100
months,
we're not going to see them later.

1494
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:45,280
And you know the.
If you look at dr.

1495
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:49,630
Hark homes paper,
she reviews all of the the meta analyses

1496
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:53,740
and looking at saturated fat and the 
connection with heart disease.

1497
01:12:53,741 --> 01:12:58,741
There are 39 med analyses of rcts or 
prospective cohort studies that looked 

1498
01:12:59,411 --> 01:13:04,411
at saturated fat and health outcomes.
Thirty five of 39 did not show 

1499
01:13:04,411 --> 01:13:06,310
significant correlations between 
saturated fat and any outcome.

1500
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:11,470
Okay.
Thirty five of 39 of the four that did 

1501
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,990
one was more related to trans fats,
not saturated fats.

1502
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:18,220
OnE showed a benefit of replacing 
saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat,

1503
01:13:18,221 --> 01:13:21,280
but it excluded twO studies that would 
have totally changed the result.

1504
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:26,340
And as I mentioned,
there's the med analysis of 25 rcts and 

1505
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:30,421
40 observational studies that showed no 
benefit of replacing saturated fat with 

1506
01:13:30,421 --> 01:13:34,261
polyunsaturated fat.
And then the last two were cochrane 

1507
01:13:34,261 --> 01:13:34,261
reviews.
And in those two,

1508
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,300
saturated fat and cardiovascular disease
were correlated,

1509
01:13:37,301 --> 01:13:40,270
but saturated fat was not correlated 
with total mortality,

1510
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:43,900
cardiovascular disease mortality,
a fatal heart attack,

1511
01:13:43,901 --> 01:13:48,901
nonfatal heart attack,
stroke or a heart death from heart 

1512
01:13:48,901 --> 01:13:52,060
disease or death from any diagnoses of 
diabetes.

1513
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:57,090
So joel,
I'm going to let you get you had out of 

1514
01:13:57,090 --> 01:14:00,541
those 39 trials,
virtually none showed that eating 

1515
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:04,351
saturated fat will increase your risk of
heart disease and none showed that it 

1516
01:14:04,351 --> 01:14:06,250
will increase your risk of death from 
any cause.

1517
01:14:06,251 --> 01:14:08,050
So that is pretty damning evidence.

1518
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:13,310
Now,
if I could summarize for you or get you 

1519
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:15,561
to summarize your position,
is that his reciting of these older 

1520
01:14:15,561 --> 01:14:18,780
studies that they are not relevant,
that they are epidemiologists,

1521
01:14:18,781 --> 01:14:23,781
study that they are,
they are not as rigorous and that this 

1522
01:14:24,431 --> 01:14:29,431
new evidence is based on a new 
understanding and new science and that 

1523
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:29,431
he's ignoring this.

1524
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:34,050
Yeah,
the early studies showed some 

1525
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:34,050
relationship,
but they were short,

1526
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:36,850
very short term between eating saturated
fat and then and then cholesterol.

1527
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:40,570
The other problem is they were using 
cholesterol as a proxy marker.

1528
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:44,410
They weren't looking at did people eat 
saturated fat and die more?

1529
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,470
They'd looked at did saturated fat,
inCreased cholesterol.

1530
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:49,920
Um,
so when they,

1531
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:54,990
when they did longer term studies,
there's no increase in cholesterol on 

1532
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:55,930
average.
That doeSn't mean no one will experience

1533
01:14:55,931 --> 01:14:57,310
an increase.
That's not true.

1534
01:14:57,311 --> 01:15:01,030
Some people will,
but on average there was no increase in.

1535
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:04,750
And then when they looked at they just 
took cholesterol out of the equation.

1536
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:09,751
Let's just look at is there an increase 
in heart attacks or death from eating 

1537
01:15:09,751 --> 01:15:12,240
saturated fat when they did that?
There's no increase in [inaudible].

1538
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:17,260
These are that,
those are observational studies and we 

1539
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:18,150
have all these randomized controlled 
trials that are showing no,

1540
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:23,180
no increase in cholesterol,
no increase in insulin levels and 

1541
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:25,600
actually a decrease in all of those 
markers.

1542
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:26,470
Joel,

1543
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:29,480
um,
important stuff.

1544
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:31,930
And a lot of stuff was said.
And I doubt it,

1545
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:34,130
unless you're really high level,
you understood.

1546
01:15:34,131 --> 01:15:35,900
I just want to pick out one thing chris 
said,

1547
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:38,450
does anybody know what the cochrane 
database?

1548
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,740
So where'd the flow of his mouth?
Cochran coc,

1549
01:15:40,741 --> 01:15:43,910
h r n e is a group of scientists to try 
and be very objective,

1550
01:15:43,911 --> 01:15:46,310
very independent,
don't have any emotional,

1551
01:15:46,311 --> 01:15:47,840
any books,
any supplements,

1552
01:15:47,841 --> 01:15:49,010
any food,
and nothing,

1553
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,350
and we all love supplements around this 
table,

1554
01:15:51,351 --> 01:15:53,960
but let's get out of that cochrane 
database.

1555
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:59,020
Every five years,
comes out with a statement that 

1556
01:15:59,020 --> 01:15:59,020
saturated fat relate to the risk of 
heart disease.

1557
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:03,911
In 2015,
the most recent hooper look up hooper 

1558
01:16:03,911 --> 01:16:04,160
lookup cochrane database.
YeS it does.

1559
01:16:04,161 --> 01:16:05,900
Chris said it,
but he flew by it.

1560
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:11,140
No,
it wasn't powerful enough that your 

1561
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:11,140
choice of butter,
eggs,

1562
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:15,161
meat,
and cheese necessarily predicted your 

1563
01:16:15,161 --> 01:16:15,560
total lifespan,
but it absolutely predicted your risk of

1564
01:16:15,561 --> 01:16:17,970
developing a heart attack and stroke 
according to this independent david.

1565
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:20,960
How 2015.
Well,

1566
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:24,830
how does it do it?
Saturated fat in the diet lowers the ldl

1567
01:16:24,831 --> 01:16:25,850
receptor.
Gene liver.

1568
01:16:25,851 --> 01:16:27,620
Let's talk some real science.
Your liver,

1569
01:16:27,621 --> 01:16:28,820
my liver.
Chris's liver.

1570
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:33,970
When you don't have ldl receptors or 
less than you should on the surface of 

1571
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:34,970
your liver cells,
you ldl stays in your blood.

1572
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:37,730
it gets into your arterial wall.
That's my field.

1573
01:16:37,731 --> 01:16:39,410
Don't jack with manner,
tara walls.

1574
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:44,590
It gets picked up by monocytes and 
macrophages become foamy cells and you 

1575
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:45,680
fucking dead,
and that's how it starts.

1576
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:50,681
When you eat saturated fat,
there's a chain of events that 

1577
01:16:50,681 --> 01:16:50,690
biologists and chemists and scientists 
know.

1578
01:16:50,691 --> 01:16:54,590
There's no question.
Nineteen 85 nobel prize in medicine.

1579
01:16:54,591 --> 01:16:56,390
Nobody would not go to the eighties.
Again.

1580
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:00,200
When you go to these studies,
just want you to refute,

1581
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:03,500
okay,
2012,

1582
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,890
I published a study which one of us is 
as scientists around the table.

1583
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,390
I've got it open.
It's a journal,

1584
01:17:08,391 --> 01:17:11,000
american kind of high energy may please 
read the conclusion,

1585
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:14,150
the lower your ldl level beginning in 
life,

1586
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:19,151
the greater issue.
Reduction in your risk of developing a 

1587
01:17:19,151 --> 01:17:21,551
heart attack and stroke,
and I'll give you an interesting 

1588
01:17:21,551 --> 01:17:24,131
statistic.
If you take lipitor and you drop your 

1589
01:17:24,131 --> 01:17:27,341
ldl cholesterol 30 percent,
you will typically drop your risk of a 

1590
01:17:27,341 --> 01:17:31,211
heart attack.
If you're in the coronary range by 30 

1591
01:17:31,211 --> 01:17:33,761
percent.
If you drop your ldl by 30 percent 

1592
01:17:33,761 --> 01:17:36,971
because you're born with a genetic gift,
that it's just a lower than the average 

1593
01:17:36,971 --> 01:17:38,030
american,
you drop your risk of heart attack by 90

1594
01:17:38,031 --> 01:17:40,220
percent.
When you keep your cholesterol down your

1595
01:17:40,221 --> 01:17:41,030
whole life.
I'm telling you,

1596
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:42,470
your blood cholesterol level,
your whole life,

1597
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,990
you are golden and the heart attack and 
stroke risk.

1598
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,930
The problem was they do.
We pick up people at age 50,

1599
01:17:47,931 --> 01:17:52,931
60 and we start jaclyn with her diet and
jacket with their drugs and that's 

1600
01:17:52,931 --> 01:17:52,931
wonderful.

1601
01:17:52,931 --> 01:17:54,200
They've had 50,
60 years of deteriorating their arteries

1602
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:59,201
and we help them.
We can't help them like teaching 

1603
01:17:59,201 --> 01:17:59,570
children eat fruits and vegetables and 
stay away from hot dogs.

1604
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,600
That's where we got to go.
That's the second gong to get kids 

1605
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:04,790
healthy because they got their whole 
life.

1606
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:07,880
Please,
what is wrong with what he said?

1607
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:09,050
Well,
there's.

1608
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,420
There's illusions to what's the number 
one,

1609
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,710
two things wrong and I,
you know,

1610
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:15,980
I'm really not trying to nitpick.
He doesn't like epidemiology,

1611
01:18:15,981 --> 01:18:18,800
but he totally uses epidemiology to 
support his case.

1612
01:18:18,801 --> 01:18:21,620
You can't have it both ways.
I love basic biochemistry.

1613
01:18:21,621 --> 01:18:24,020
I love epidemiologists.
I love randomized studies,

1614
01:18:24,021 --> 01:18:29,021
I love sitting there and in studies,
my foundation is broad and it's what's 

1615
01:18:29,021 --> 01:18:30,560
called the scientific method that's used
by scientists and los angeles,

1616
01:18:30,561 --> 01:18:33,340
and that's taught me a number two.
Uh,

1617
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:34,300
besides that,
there's,

1618
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:39,350
there's illusions to significant 
randomized clinical trials in meta 

1619
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:43,811
analysis.
We got to keep the science clean as can 

1620
01:18:43,811 --> 01:18:46,571
be.
A breakthrough has been the meta 

1621
01:18:46,571 --> 01:18:47,900
analysis.
Siri torino chowdry 2010,

1622
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:50,150
2014 d'souza,
thousand 15.

1623
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,940
They haVe severe flaws.
They're not new research.

1624
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:56,540
They're rehashing old data.
There has not been a randomized clinical

1625
01:18:56,541 --> 01:19:01,541
trial that really challenges the 
coronary heart disease risk or meaning 

1626
01:19:01,541 --> 01:19:02,630
and increased saturated fat that you 
three right now.

1627
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:04,490
So long are they?
Hold on.

1628
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:07,390
There is american journal of clinical 
nutrition,

1629
01:19:07,391 --> 01:19:10,870
2013.
I'm a judge or holla.

1630
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,870
I'm not sure how to pronounce the name.
These are all on my website.

1631
01:19:13,871 --> 01:19:16,330
If you go to [inaudible] dot com slash 
research,

1632
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:21,610
you can see them or crestor.com/rogan,
and you scroll down to the saturated fat

1633
01:19:21,611 --> 01:19:22,690
section.
You can see them.

1634
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:27,720
This is a total of 20 randomized 
controlled trials and the results low 

1635
01:19:27,911 --> 01:19:29,350
carb load,
gi,

1636
01:19:29,351 --> 01:19:34,351
mediterranean,
and high protein diets are effective in 

1637
01:19:34,351 --> 01:19:37,081
improving various markers of 
cardiovascular risk and people with 

1638
01:19:37,081 --> 01:19:39,310
diabetes should be considered the 
overall strategy of diabetes management.

1639
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:44,050
And then we've got a one from a snore 
guard,

1640
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:49,580
systematic review and meta analysis of 
dietary carbohydrate restriction in 

1641
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:53,761
patients witH type two diabetes.
And this was a review of 10 rcts and 

1642
01:19:54,101 --> 01:19:59,101
they found not only was the low carb 
diet more effective for diabetes than 

1643
01:19:59,101 --> 01:20:03,910
the low fat diet,
the greater the carbohydrate 

1644
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:03,910
restriction,
the greater the effect.

1645
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:08,730
And then we have one from 2018.
This is sainsbury at all and this is 

1646
01:20:09,661 --> 01:20:14,661
effective dietary carbohydrate 
restriction on glycemic control in 

1647
01:20:14,661 --> 01:20:17,811
adults with diabetes.
And they found that the low carb,

1648
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,950
uh,
the conclusion,

1649
01:20:19,951 --> 01:20:24,951
this review suggests that low carb 
restricted or carbohydrate restricted 

1650
01:20:24,951 --> 01:20:28,251
diets could be offered to people livinG 
with diabetes as part of an 

1651
01:20:28,251 --> 01:20:30,170
individualized management plan.
So these are finding that these,

1652
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:31,640
these are,
you know,

1653
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:36,680
reviews of several randomized controlled
trials that are finding that there's no 

1654
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:40,941
increase in cardiovascular risk markers.
There's actually an improvement in 

1655
01:20:40,941 --> 01:20:44,841
cardio vascular risk markers and there's
an improvement in diabetes markers like 

1656
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:46,920
blood sugar,
insulin weight,

1657
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:48,900
visceral fat,
et cetera.

1658
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:50,930
So I mean this is the,
the,

1659
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:56,040
the,
the gold standard of evidence that we 

1660
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,360
have is randomized controlled trials and
meta analyses.

1661
01:20:57,361 --> 01:20:58,750
Of course they do.
They're,

1662
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,320
there are problems.
They can be done poorly.

1663
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:06,320
They can be done well.
That's true of any kInd of scientific 

1664
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,541
research,
but we can't throw out really the 

1665
01:21:08,541 --> 01:21:10,410
highest standard of evidence is a meta 
analysis of randomized controlled trials

1666
01:21:10,411 --> 01:21:15,411
because you can just.
Anyone can pick one randomized 

1667
01:21:15,411 --> 01:21:18,201
controlled trial to support their view.
The met analysis does is it looks at all

1668
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:23,010
of the evidence and it looks at the 
quality of evidence and then it comes up

1669
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:26,570
with a result from looking at all of 
these trials and that's,

1670
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:31,590
that's where science is today and these 
low carb diets are high in saturated 

1671
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:31,890
fat.
They are high in saturated fat.

1672
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:37,010
Yeah.
Unless they're explicitly doing a trial 

1673
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:39,621
where they're doing a low carb diet 
that's the tire and mono unsaturated 

1674
01:21:39,621 --> 01:21:39,621
fat,
but those are rare.

1675
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:41,970
Generally,
people who are reading low carb diets or

1676
01:21:41,971 --> 01:21:44,100
eating a lot more saturated fat.
Joel,

1677
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,810
just three quick bullet points.
Number one,

1678
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:48,760
it is low carb literature.
We're talking saturated fat and coronary

1679
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,130
disease.
That's a mixture.

1680
01:21:50,131 --> 01:21:52,080
It's not the topic we're talking about.
Number two,

1681
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:54,540
these are buying at the top of that.
We're talking about low carbs,

1682
01:21:54,541 --> 01:21:58,760
a whole different nutritional.
That's that.

1683
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,170
We haven't seen it.
That's what he said.

1684
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:01,560
Yeah,
no,

1685
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:05,130
you can do low carbon jack up protein,
but most of the experts say,

1686
01:22:05,131 --> 01:22:06,360
don't do that.
That's called meat.

1687
01:22:06,361 --> 01:22:11,361
You can do low carbon jack up fat.
That doesn't necessarily mean you're 

1688
01:22:11,361 --> 01:22:12,780
jacking up your saturated fat.
I do low carb plant based.

1689
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:16,080
That's a whole different topic,
but it is not the number one.

1690
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:17,820
These are one.
It's low carb.

1691
01:22:17,821 --> 01:22:22,230
It's not the main topic that's dominated
cardiovascular research for 60 years,

1692
01:22:22,231 --> 01:22:24,720
which is consistent to this day in every
guideline.

1693
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,240
Limit saturated fat.
She don't die of a heart attack.

1694
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,610
Stroke number two,
I just.

1695
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,810
These are words your listeners may not 
know.

1696
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:35,990
These seats that our biomarker studies,
I'm talking about dying of heart 

1697
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:35,990
attacks,
having heart attacks,

1698
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:39,180
having stroke.
I care if your blood sugar marker called

1699
01:22:39,181 --> 01:22:40,620
hemoglobin a,
one c goes down.

1700
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:45,830
I care if your ldl and your high 
sensitivity c reactive protein goes 

1701
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:46,170
down,
but that's not life and death.

1702
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:51,200
Those are biomarkers,
so usually correlated with better 

1703
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:51,380
health.
If you're not tracking in artery,

1704
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:54,720
you're not in my scientific field 
because I track arteries in clinic,

1705
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:57,360
we track arteries in our research 
studies.

1706
01:22:57,630 --> 01:23:00,120
Um,
I think that's the second thing I wanted

1707
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:01,290
to say,
but you know,

1708
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:06,710
I'm not here to actually negate the data
that compared the crappy calorie rich 

1709
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:10,980
and process died.
The most americans are eating what chris

1710
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:14,200
is presenting as alternative diet won't 
improve numbers in the lab.

1711
01:23:14,201 --> 01:23:15,970
Absolutely.
It's a better choice.

1712
01:23:15,971 --> 01:23:17,380
I like your diet.
I do.

1713
01:23:17,381 --> 01:23:18,640
Joe.
I like your diet,

1714
01:23:18,641 --> 01:23:20,460
chris,
because I'm looking at people walking in

1715
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:25,240
wendy's and hardee's and mcdonald's and 
hospital cafeterias and gas stations.

1716
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:30,510
That's what we need to shut down and 
we'll make a main difference at all 

1717
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:32,140
we're left with is chris's diet,
joe's diet and joel's diet.

1718
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,230
We're going to have an amazing country.
Then you can decide what you want.

1719
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:41,880
I think we all agree with that,
but I still need to bring you back to 

1720
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:44,671
this,
what he's talking about in terms of 

1721
01:23:44,671 --> 01:23:47,251
saturated fat and not being a risk and 
not increasing your cholesterol.

1722
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,170
You seem to disagree with that.

1723
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:52,990
Sure.
Because the science says it does.

1724
01:23:52,991 --> 01:23:53,850
I mean,
he just said,

1725
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:57,860
I would say that it doesn't show me.
Let me clarify something too.

1726
01:23:57,861 --> 01:24:00,230
I wasn't.
I'm not just talking about biomarkers.

1727
01:24:00,231 --> 01:24:02,930
Biomarkers are important,
but I was the one who argued for looking

1728
01:24:02,931 --> 01:24:07,760
at total mortality is the most important
endpoint and mortality for many of these

1729
01:24:07,761 --> 01:24:10,670
other diseases and for the conclusion 
from Dr.

1730
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:15,670
Hart comes paper where she reviewed all 
of the evidence on saturated fat that I 

1731
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:20,231
talked about before and I just mentioned
35 of 39 studies didn't show any 

1732
01:24:20,231 --> 01:24:21,860
relationship.
Here's the conclusion.

1733
01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:27,310
No meta analysis of randomized 
controlled trials and slash or 

1734
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:29,090
prospective cohort studies.
Those are observational studies,

1735
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:34,360
has found any significant difference for
dietary fat interventions and all cause 

1736
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:38,921
mortality.
That's deaths from any cause or death 

1737
01:24:38,921 --> 01:24:42,080
from heart disease or associated with 
dietary fat and heart disease mortality.

1738
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:47,110
In other words,
there's no med analysis of randomized 

1739
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:50,201
controlled trials that shows that eating
more saturated fat will will increase 

1740
01:24:50,201 --> 01:24:50,360
your risk of death

1741
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:55,460
and your take on this is that this is 
the latest science and that would he 

1742
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:57,000
siting in terms of these studies from 
the 19 fifties,

1743
01:24:57,001 --> 01:24:58,710
the 19 sixties aren't really relevant?

1744
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:00,940
Yes,
and it that that,

1745
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:03,760
but even even if we look at 
epidemiology,

1746
01:25:03,761 --> 01:25:06,490
like I said earlier,
that there are.

1747
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:10,000
There's a meta analysis of studies 
including 350,000

1748
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:15,001
participants that found no relationship 
between saturated fat intake and 

1749
01:25:15,001 --> 01:25:18,631
cardiovascular disease and then a more 
recent review that included both 

1750
01:25:18,631 --> 01:25:23,251
randomized controlled trials,
25 of them and 40 observational studies 

1751
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:26,770
with 650,000
participants that that concluded.

1752
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,180
Current evidence doesn't clearly support
cardiovascular guidelines that encourage

1753
01:25:31,181 --> 01:25:36,181
high consumption of polyunsaturated fat 
and low consumption of pto of saturated 

1754
01:25:36,181 --> 01:25:40,531
fat.
So whether you look at the epidemiology 

1755
01:25:40,531 --> 01:25:43,080
or whether you look at the randomized 
controlled trials are the meta analysis 

1756
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,020
of randomized controlled trials.
You ended up in the same place,

1757
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:44,890
joel,

1758
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:48,070
most modern data,
we already talked this,

1759
01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:51,820
everyBody please google cochrane 
database saturated fat.

1760
01:25:51,821 --> 01:25:56,821
Two thousand 15 hooper is the author.
He the introduction is reducing 

1761
01:25:57,761 --> 01:26:00,850
saturateD fat,
reduces serum cholesterol,

1762
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:06,000
but we're not sure of the importance.
So we took 15 randomized studies with 

1763
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:06,560
59,000
participants.

1764
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:11,590
The conclusion there is a potentially 
important reduction in heart disease 

1765
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:13,160
risk by reducing saturated fat in your 
diet.

1766
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:18,220
Two thousand 15,
which is why 21 international societies 

1767
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:21,970
are solid that we will help the public.
We will help the listeners have your 

1768
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:23,180
piece of meat,
make it four ounces,

1769
01:26:23,181 --> 01:26:25,940
not 14 ounces,
have your bake and make a one strip,

1770
01:26:25,941 --> 01:26:27,890
not for strips.
Have your cheese,

1771
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:30,230
just don't eat it every day and don't 
eat large amounts.

1772
01:26:30,231 --> 01:26:35,231
The amount of cheesy United States has 
gone insane because the usta funds 

1773
01:26:35,231 --> 01:26:35,420
cheese manufacturers.
Okay,

1774
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:37,850
so 2015.
I can't get you a better one though.

1775
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:40,190
They'll update cochrane database in 20 
slash 20.

1776
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:43,110
It'll be the same.
What's your take on when you said so?

1777
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:44,780
Here's johnny.
I don't care.

1778
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:49,840
Honestly what he said,
I've got to go with the best science in 

1779
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:50,960
the world because I deal with patients 
who have serious disease.

1780
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:56,020
I can tell my patients the most updated 
data analysis of randomized clinical 

1781
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:58,100
studies say saturated fat in your diet 
raises your cholesterol,

1782
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,010
lowering saturated fat,
like eating less animal products,

1783
01:27:01,011 --> 01:27:02,210
not the most.
Up to date.

1784
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:07,240
Two thousand 15 database mentioned to 
several med analyses from 2008.

1785
01:27:07,731 --> 01:27:10,160
This is not been announced.
This is random as clinical studies.

1786
01:27:10,161 --> 01:27:15,161
Fifty 9,000
participants out there reviewing 

1787
01:27:15,161 --> 01:27:15,730
studies.
That's not a that's and that's w.

1788
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:17,660
We have to look at the weight of 
evidence.

1789
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:21,500
There are lots of studies published all 
the time and that's again why looking at

1790
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:23,780
med analyses of randomized controlled 
trials,

1791
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:29,110
looking at very large reviews of 
observational studies with over a 

1792
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:31,940
million participants and you end up in 
the same place.

1793
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:34,460
Of course we can go and find one study 
here,

1794
01:27:34,461 --> 01:27:38,450
one study there that that is different 
has a different result,

1795
01:27:38,451 --> 01:27:43,451
but that's not the scientific method.
The scientific method is to look at the 

1796
01:27:43,451 --> 01:27:46,781
weight of the evidence and to continue 
to evaluate that over time as the 

1797
01:27:46,781 --> 01:27:48,110
evidence changes.
And you know,

1798
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,070
this is a great quote from johnny and 
dennis,

1799
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:52,520
the stanford epidemiologists that I 
mentioned,

1800
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:53,810
um,
that,

1801
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:58,920
that,
that reminds us that we can't just rely 

1802
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:01,930
on the past to inform the present.
He said claimed research findings may 

1803
01:28:02,511 --> 01:28:07,040
often be simply accurate measures of the
prevailing bias.

1804
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:11,180
And that what that means is that let's 
say,

1805
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,920
you know,
you haVe a paper that,

1806
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:14,260
uh,
you know,

1807
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:15,360
30,
40,

1808
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,710
50 years ago that says saturated fat 
increases the risk of cholesterol.

1809
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:23,330
Then later somebody makes that claim and
a paper just like that initial sentence,

1810
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:25,040
saturated fat raises cholesterol.

1811
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,680
You see a little number,
they're referencing that one paper.

1812
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:31,310
Then a couple of years later,
somebody else makes that same claim.

1813
01:28:31,311 --> 01:28:36,311
They referenced the second paper which 
was referencing the first paper and on 

1814
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,780
and on it goes.
And the whole thing is a house of cards.

1815
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:43,880
That's what most people don't realize 
that that is bad science.

1816
01:28:43,881 --> 01:28:46,910
This was good side.
The bad side is what you're saying.

1817
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:50,760
You're saying you see what he's saying 
is because we know not.

1818
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:56,890
Again,
he's making comments that have no 

1819
01:28:56,890 --> 01:28:57,500
reference shortly.
If there's misquoted the references.

1820
01:28:57,501 --> 01:29:00,980
CAn I give an example?
How does he have no references?

1821
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:06,860
A scientific peer reviewed paper that 
quoted or referenced in everybody's 

1822
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:08,970
simply passively keeps requesting their 
reference.

1823
01:29:08,971 --> 01:29:13,971
It was wrong in the beginning.
I can give you a real life internet 

1824
01:29:13,971 --> 01:29:14,550
example wigs because gary dobbs,
my new friend,

1825
01:29:14,551 --> 01:29:19,551
but sometimes my adverse adversary,
but I can't give you a literature 

1826
01:29:19,551 --> 01:29:19,710
reference.
It might be one,

1827
01:29:19,711 --> 01:29:21,710
but these are very general statements.
I just want to.

1828
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:22,560
I think we should

1829
01:29:22,570 --> 01:29:23,650
move on,
but no,

1830
01:29:23,651 --> 01:29:26,830
I definitely shouldn't because we're not
really clearing this up.

1831
01:29:26,831 --> 01:29:28,520
What is he saying that's wrong?
Okay.

1832
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:34,830
The best scientific analysis of the 
global topic to saturated fat.

1833
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:39,950
Rich containing foods which are animal 
sourced foods at high amount in your 

1834
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:44,091
diet,
increase your risk of dying of a heart 

1835
01:29:44,091 --> 01:29:44,100
attack or stroke or have a heritage.
Stroke goes to the biochemistry,

1836
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:45,540
etc.
Offend your diet,

1837
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:48,840
will lower the number of ldl receptors 
on your liver and your blood close to it

1838
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:53,841
goes up.
That's backed by 395 metabolic ward 

1839
01:29:53,841 --> 01:29:53,841
studies,
but that is biochemistry.

1840
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:57,720
Then you get to epidemiology countries 
that eat more saturated fat.

1841
01:29:57,930 --> 01:29:59,370
Finland.
Great story,

1842
01:29:59,371 --> 01:30:01,440
and I got to tell it,
1970.

1843
01:30:01,441 --> 01:30:03,900
The highest heart attack rate in the 
world was Finland.

1844
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:06,510
Guys were dying your age and my age at 
the highest rate,

1845
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:09,330
the lowest heart attack rate in the 
mediterrAnean was crete.

1846
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:12,060
Forty percent of calories from fat and 
Finland.

1847
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:14,310
Forty percent of calories from fat and 
crete.

1848
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:15,390
Is that.
How can that happen?

1849
01:30:15,391 --> 01:30:20,391
Because I'm not an advocate for low fat 
diet except for very selected clinical 

1850
01:30:20,391 --> 01:30:20,790
cases.
IT was olive oil and crete.

1851
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:23,430
That's very low,
not zero low in saturated fat.

1852
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:25,140
It was cheese,
it was meat,

1853
01:30:25,141 --> 01:30:27,120
it was beef,
it was butter in Finland.

1854
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:30,870
They instituted a national program to 
lower the content,

1855
01:30:30,871 --> 01:30:32,340
has saturated fat in the diet and 
Finland.

1856
01:30:32,341 --> 01:30:34,740
five years later,
hard tech dropped 80 percent.

1857
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:35,990
Kevin,
do you understand that?

1858
01:30:35,991 --> 01:30:38,540
He's.
He's saying something totally different.

1859
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:43,360
You're citing epidemiologist chemistry.
Then I went to epic.

1860
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:48,850
What's wrong with what he said,
because he's not being broad with the 

1861
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:48,850
scientist

1862
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:49,060
getting.
He's getting mired in the woods.

1863
01:30:49,061 --> 01:30:52,240
I'm telling you,
the broadest view from 50,000

1864
01:30:52,241 --> 01:30:54,310
feet up,
biochemistry supports it.

1865
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:58,330
Epidemiology supports at 395 metabolic 
ward studies,

1866
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:01,510
my randomized mendelian randomization so
said though,

1867
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:06,570
because he's not looking at the entirety
of the data and I'm telling you the 

1868
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:06,940
entire data.
Then you'd go to loma linda,

1869
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:08,210
okinawa,
you go to [inaudible],

1870
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,960
you'd go to Costa Rica and you go to 
sardinia.

1871
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:16,350
If you are live to 100 and you're still 
operating on somebody's heart is you're 

1872
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:17,560
likely high in animal saturated fat or 
not.

1873
01:31:17,561 --> 01:31:20,920
The answer is it isn't.
It's as low as three percent of the diet

1874
01:31:20,921 --> 01:31:21,160
and okay,

1875
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:24,280
what could it possibly be?
other faculty user bias that.

1876
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:29,380
There's a great stat recently that came 
out that showed that just following the 

1877
01:31:29,461 --> 01:31:32,190
top five health behaviors which are 
basic,

1878
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:34,710
so we're talking about not smoking,
not drinking,

1879
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:39,950
maintaining a healthy body weight,
getting some physical activity and 

1880
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:40,850
eating healthy.
You know,

1881
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:43,620
relatively healthy diet,
like not junk all the time.

1882
01:31:43,621 --> 01:31:47,030
Increases your lifespan by 13 years and 
that's where you cannot.

1883
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:52,490
You can't look at these at these 
populations and make inferences about 

1884
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:56,601
animal products being the driving factor
one way or the other because there's 

1885
01:31:56,601 --> 01:32:00,010
just too many other factors.
There's no way to control for all of

1886
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:05,010
those factors in a study and that's why 
we have to come back to the scientific 

1887
01:32:05,141 --> 01:32:10,141
method.
We use observational studies to come up 

1888
01:32:10,141 --> 01:32:13,321
with hypotheses.
Then we do randomized controlled trials 

1889
01:32:13,321 --> 01:32:14,110
to either confirm or refute those 
hypotheses.

1890
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:16,450
As I said before,
in many cases,

1891
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:21,440
what is apparent and observational 
studies or what seems apparent to is not

1892
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:23,860
later confirmed in randomized controlled
trials.

1893
01:32:23,861 --> 01:32:27,520
And that's where we're at now wIth 
saturated fat and dietary cholesterol.

1894
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:32,620
I just mentioned three very large meta 
analysis of randomized controlled trials

1895
01:32:32,621 --> 01:32:37,621
that failed to confirm any association 
of saturated fat and heart disease and,

1896
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:41,620
or saturated fat and increase in these 
risk markers.

1897
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:46,650
And I mentioned to reviews of very large
observational study data including 

1898
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:52,710
350,000
in one study in 650 in another showing 

1899
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:57,571
no relationship.
So the mechanistic arguments about 

1900
01:32:57,571 --> 01:32:57,571
liver,
you know,

1901
01:32:57,571 --> 01:32:59,550
the saturated fat does this or that,
uh,

1902
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:02,740
that's not convincing.
If it's not showing up in the data,

1903
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:07,780
if it did that,
then we would see it in the 

1904
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:08,160
observational studies in the randomized 
studies.

1905
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,690
Now,
specifically joel,

1906
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:11,880
what is your take on what he just said?
Well,

1907
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:15,960
we just had another gang moment,
so chris just quoted and it's actually a

1908
01:33:15,961 --> 01:33:20,961
little bit comical,
a harvard school of public health study 

1909
01:33:20,961 --> 01:33:22,380
on how do you live 14 years longer.
It's epidemiology,

1910
01:33:22,381 --> 01:33:25,050
but he's using it until the senior 
author is Dr.

1911
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:27,450
Walter willett.
A guy he calls a vegan pro,

1912
01:33:27,451 --> 01:33:29,460
uh,
advocate who's not at all vegan.

1913
01:33:29,461 --> 01:33:34,461
He's written a book about the 
mediterranean diet with all kinds of 

1914
01:33:34,461 --> 01:33:34,461
animal recipes in it,
which is fine with me.

1915
01:33:34,461 --> 01:33:35,730
He's a brilliant,
brilliant,

1916
01:33:35,731 --> 01:33:40,731
brilliant senior harvard researcher,
but she's using data that he says is 

1917
01:33:40,731 --> 01:33:41,220
weakened such,
yet the teaching point is there.

1918
01:33:41,221 --> 01:33:46,221
How do you live 14 years longer?
You don't smoke exercise 30 minutes a 

1919
01:33:46,221 --> 01:33:46,350
day.
He eat better than average.

1920
01:33:46,351 --> 01:33:48,570
That's very broad,
but you'd better than average.

1921
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:49,470
You,
um,

1922
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:54,620
keep your waist under 25,
a bmi under 25 and you have a few 

1923
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:57,840
alcoholic beverages a week.
I want your listeners to write that down

1924
01:33:57,841 --> 01:34:02,841
because that is solid epidemiologic data
that's fairly consistent across across 

1925
01:34:02,841 --> 01:34:06,270
the spectrum.
So let's all use something to teach your

1926
01:34:06,271 --> 01:34:07,920
listeners,
but that's my point.

1927
01:34:07,921 --> 01:34:12,921
So you can't look at cultures that have 
a completely different lifestyle than

1928
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:17,580
standard american lifestyle and draw any
inferences about animal products.

1929
01:34:17,581 --> 01:34:20,480
So a really good example of this is,
you know,

1930
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:22,750
the seventh day adventists,
uh,

1931
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:23,600
the,
the,

1932
01:34:23,601 --> 01:34:28,601
the claim is that it's the vegetarian 
diet that makes them live longer than 

1933
01:34:28,601 --> 01:34:29,880
the general population,
but they,

1934
01:34:29,910 --> 01:34:32,730
as I mentioned before,
as part of their belief system,

1935
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,950
they don't smoke,
they don't drink,

1936
01:34:34,951 --> 01:34:36,900
they have a healthy lifestyle in 
general.

1937
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:42,230
What if there was another population 
that also had those kinds of belief 

1938
01:34:42,230 --> 01:34:45,150
systems about not smoking,
not drinking and healthy lifestyle,

1939
01:34:45,151 --> 01:34:46,940
but they also ate meat.
Well,

1940
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,960
turns out there is the mormons and 
there've been three studies on mormons 

1941
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:54,900
and each of the mormon,
the studies had been done on mormons,

1942
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:59,990
found that they're mortality.
I'll give you the exact numbers here in 

1943
01:35:02,171 --> 01:35:05,320
just a second.
Um,

1944
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,620
for whatever reason that's not coming up
here.

1945
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:14,621
But um,
their risk of death compared to the 

1946
01:35:14,621 --> 01:35:18,341
general population was something like 50
percent lower than the general 

1947
01:35:18,341 --> 01:35:19,790
population on average and yet they're 
eating animal foods.

1948
01:35:19,791 --> 01:35:22,140
They're not vegetarian like the seventh 
day adventist.

1949
01:35:22,141 --> 01:35:22,390
So

1950
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,260
point and bringing that epidemiologists 
study in the first place,

1951
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:30,261
bringing up healthy lifestyle,
increasing your lifespan by 14 years is 

1952
01:35:30,261 --> 01:35:33,861
to show that any positive move is going 
to show whether it's just exercise and 

1953
01:35:35,131 --> 01:35:38,990
not eating sugar or whatever is going to
show an increase in,

1954
01:35:38,991 --> 01:35:39,870
in your lifespan.

1955
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:44,960
Yeah,
and just to show how hard it is to 

1956
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,940
isolate single variables and the 
influence of those single variables in 

1957
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:50,340
an observational study on,
on those effects,

1958
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:55,850
and this is something that you noticed 
johnny geneticists said over and over 

1959
01:35:55,850 --> 01:36:00,201
again,
is that it's almost impossible if not 

1960
01:36:00,201 --> 01:36:02,961
impossible to disentangle the influences
of all of these single variables in 

1961
01:36:03,481 --> 01:36:05,340
observational research.
And again,

1962
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:08,460
I'm not saying we shouldn't use 
observational research.

1963
01:36:08,461 --> 01:36:13,461
I'm saying we should be circumspect 
about how you use it and we should be 

1964
01:36:13,461 --> 01:36:16,461
aware of the limitations and the flaws 
and keep those in mind when we're 

1965
01:36:16,461 --> 01:36:20,340
designing observational studies and when
we're interpreting their results.

1966
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:23,610
So joe,
what is your opinion on what he's saying

1967
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:27,300
about saturated fat and cholesterol and 
mortality risk?

1968
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:28,330
Okay.
Well,

1969
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:30,010
I think I've said it,
but I'll repeat it.

1970
01:36:30,011 --> 01:36:33,310
I just want to point out we just shared 
another common moment.

1971
01:36:33,311 --> 01:36:37,000
We're both lifestyle medicine doctors of
which nutrition is just one part.

1972
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:39,490
We just went through a list of lifestyle
factors.

1973
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:42,070
We now add sleep,
we had social support,

1974
01:36:42,071 --> 01:36:45,010
we had stress management skills.
It's not all smoking diet,

1975
01:36:45,011 --> 01:36:50,011
exercise and and the size of your body,
but we are aligned and in know and we 

1976
01:36:50,011 --> 01:36:54,520
will go at patient's side by side and do
a lot of the exactly the same thing.

1977
01:36:54,521 --> 01:36:59,521
In fact,
I think the only thing they're squabble 

1978
01:36:59,521 --> 01:37:01,210
about and lifestyle medicine is optimal 
nutrition to prevent chronic disease and

1979
01:37:01,211 --> 01:37:06,211
there's probably more than one path,
but god knows the plant based medicine 

1980
01:37:06,211 --> 01:37:09,721
group has a tremendous body of science.
I'll conclude one more time and I don't 

1981
01:37:09,721 --> 01:37:13,921
know how many times I can say at the 
highest level of science to integrate 

1982
01:37:13,921 --> 01:37:15,490
all that's available biochemistry's on 
the side.

1983
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:18,280
Saturated fat raises your risk of 
coronary heart disease.

1984
01:37:18,490 --> 01:37:21,130
It doesn't mean nobody eats a no 
saturated fat diet,

1985
01:37:21,131 --> 01:37:26,131
but you can lower it.
A observational studies where their 

1986
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:27,280
epidemiology studies were to test that 
hypothesis.

1987
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:29,890
They confirm Finland and crete I've 
talked about.

1988
01:37:29,891 --> 01:37:30,820
I won't go there.
Again.

1989
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:33,100
Randomized clinical trials have 
confirmed it.

1990
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:37,510
Hooper cochrane database 2015.
My study 2012,

1991
01:37:37,511 --> 01:37:42,511
widely cited worldwide has confirmed it.
Get your ldl cholesterol down 

1992
01:37:42,511 --> 01:37:44,110
genetically or by diet as long as you 
can,

1993
01:37:44,111 --> 01:37:49,111
as early as you can,
and finally in the last is what a old 

1994
01:37:49,111 --> 01:37:49,111
healthy people do.
Actually,

1995
01:37:49,111 --> 01:37:53,550
chris,
I just think there's a good concept to 

1996
01:37:53,550 --> 01:37:53,950
let your listeners know.
It isn't all about lifespan.

1997
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:54,700
In fact,
lifespan,

1998
01:37:54,701 --> 01:37:57,360
the united is dropping,
which is very scary for all the frigging

1999
01:37:57,361 --> 01:38:00,210
money we spend on health.
There's something called health span,

2000
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:03,660
which is to avoid chronic disease and 
die dancing or die,

2001
01:38:03,661 --> 01:38:08,661
swimming or die sky diving,
but don't die in a frigging hospital 

2002
01:38:08,661 --> 01:38:10,130
with a peg tube and a trake and a and a 
foley up your,

2003
01:38:10,131 --> 01:38:10,510
uh,
who,

2004
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:11,760
who,
and um,

2005
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:15,030
many of these studies that show you can 
reduce your risk of heart disease,

2006
01:38:15,031 --> 01:38:17,880
stroke and diabetes are talking about 
better quality of life.

2007
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:22,880
So when you put all that together,
these centenarian studies that have low 

2008
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,721
saturated fat diets are just one more 
piece I just mentioned for incredibly 

2009
01:38:26,721 --> 01:38:27,870
solid piece of evidence.
Not one,

2010
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:29,850
it's for,
it's all that's out there.

2011
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:33,270
It's what nobel prize winners use when 
they describe the cholesterol hypothesis

2012
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:36,210
is what is this correct?
He may not know it.

2013
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:38,970
In this city of los angeles,
our shared friend,

2014
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:43,971
dr valter longo often considered,
and you should have on the show perhaps 

2015
01:38:43,971 --> 01:38:45,420
the world's leading expert in nutrition,
longevity and such.

2016
01:38:45,421 --> 01:38:50,421
We'll say you incorporate all the bases 
for nutritional evaluation.

2017
01:38:50,641 --> 01:38:55,641
You keep it big picture.
You don't that he calls it pixel 

2018
01:38:55,641 --> 01:38:55,950
mentality.
You don't get hung up on one study.

2019
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:59,010
You get the whole picture biochemistry,
epidemiology,

2020
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:02,100
randomized clinical trials.
finally centenarian studies.

2021
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:05,670
I think it's very consistent.
You will enhance your health by lowering

2022
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:06,900
animal based products.

2023
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:09,900
Now we can argue is that 70 percent,
80 percent,

2024
01:39:09,901 --> 01:39:12,980
90 percent plant based loren cordain and
uh,

2025
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:15,010
the founder of the paleo movement,
um,

2026
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:20,360
boyd eaton,
we were talking about 70 percent plants 

2027
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:20,360
on your plate.
I love that.

2028
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:24,590
You know,
I'm not telling people quit eating meat 

2029
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:24,590
today or thy,
I'm not a reactionary,

2030
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:28,140
but to say that plant based medicine 
doesn't have a strong basis that I can't

2031
01:39:28,141 --> 01:39:30,240
reverse plaque which just plant based 
medicine.

2032
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:32,970
We haven't even talked about the ability
to do that,

2033
01:39:32,971 --> 01:39:37,220
but iS his absolute heresy because it in
fact is one of the most powerful piece

2034
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:38,700
attrition we have.
Okay,

2035
01:39:38,701 --> 01:39:43,701
but what's wrong with these studies that
he's talking about their pixel 

2036
01:39:43,701 --> 01:39:43,701
mentalities,
picking one,

2037
01:39:43,701 --> 01:39:48,690
know how observational data of over a 
million people and three different meta 

2038
01:39:51,231 --> 01:39:56,231
analyses of 20 to 25 randomized 
controlled trials each pixel mentality.

2039
01:39:57,511 --> 01:40:02,511
This is the gold standard for assessing 
a question like this in medicine.

2040
01:40:02,581 --> 01:40:07,050
It's not mechanistic data or mechanistic
arguments don't make,

2041
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:12,320
are not persuasive if they don't 
translate into real outcomes that you 

2042
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:15,501
can measure in randomized controlled 
trials or observational studies like 

2043
01:40:15,501 --> 01:40:17,490
trying to boil this down.
So what is your take on that without any

2044
01:40:17,491 --> 01:40:20,940
references to the past and people that 
lived in Angola that live longer.

2045
01:40:21,110 --> 01:40:26,110
These are the three disruptive 
randomized trials from 2010 on that 

2046
01:40:26,110 --> 01:40:26,180
question.
The relationship.

2047
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:28,480
Those are different trials,
joel.

2048
01:40:28,510 --> 01:40:30,670
Well then these are three different 
trials.

2049
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:34,770
I'm not the crosses researcher or 
chowder worries you.

2050
01:40:34,771 --> 01:40:36,610
You need to.
You need to throw them out there and let

2051
01:40:36,611 --> 01:40:39,790
us know the reference I did before.
You want me to do it again?

2052
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:42,430
No,
but we will get my yard.

2053
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:44,260
I mean,
what is wrong with what he's saying?

2054
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:49,620
I'm just look at them.
Obviously the non expert here and I'm 

2055
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:50,680
baffled.
So I'm trying to boil this down with his

2056
01:40:50,681 --> 01:40:52,350
little rhetoric as possible.
Okay.

2057
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:53,200
It

2058
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:59,370
a heretical conspiracy attitude to say 
everybody's got it wrong for 60 years.

2059
01:41:00,911 --> 01:41:02,940
Twenty one international societies have 
rung.

2060
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:07,970
They could,
but it's a controversy theory to say 

2061
01:41:07,970 --> 01:41:07,970
that,
that,

2062
01:41:07,970 --> 01:41:09,100
um,
hooper cochrane database,

2063
01:41:09,101 --> 01:41:11,110
2015,
they've got it wrong,

2064
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:13,630
that metabolic ward studies got it 
wrong.

2065
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:17,830
This is one or two or three pieces of 
data and their observational,

2066
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:23,340
you don't throw out the babies with the 
benefit randomized controlled trials 

2067
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:25,180
saying they're observational if they're 
not.

2068
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:29,470
What men analysis by nature is implying.
It's not a new study.

2069
01:41:29,471 --> 01:41:31,300
it's taking previous studies in doing 
so.

2070
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:36,570
Let me give you one quick example.
In the chowdry meta analysis created 

2071
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:42,180
butter is back on the cover of time 
magazine created a whole fervor out 

2072
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:45,631
there that we can go back to and all 
these great foods that atkins wants us 

2073
01:41:45,631 --> 01:41:48,331
to eat.
They correlated your blood cholesterol 

2074
01:41:48,331 --> 01:41:48,331
with your risk of having heart disease.

2075
01:41:48,331 --> 01:41:49,810
They couldn't confirm it.
Well,

2076
01:41:49,811 --> 01:41:52,900
they allowed people in that men analysis
who are on lipitor,

2077
01:41:53,170 --> 01:41:55,390
well,
of course you're on a medicine,

2078
01:41:55,391 --> 01:41:57,550
lowers your cholesterol.
They didn't exclude those people.

2079
01:41:57,551 --> 01:42:00,100
That has been resoundingly criticized 
as,

2080
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:01,300
yes,
it looks good.

2081
01:42:01,301 --> 01:42:06,301
It's in a journal.
It's a meta analysis that is fraudulent 

2082
01:42:06,301 --> 01:42:06,970
or at least relatively inappropriate 
statistics.

2083
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:07,660
It's,
you know,

2084
01:42:07,661 --> 01:42:09,190
it's,
it's so technical,

2085
01:42:09,191 --> 01:42:09,940
it's beyond,
I think,

2086
01:42:09,941 --> 01:42:14,650
the importance of this discussion,
but I just say 50,000

2087
01:42:14,651 --> 01:42:19,480
feet elevation view of the best 
nutrition is again,

2088
01:42:19,481 --> 01:42:24,481
four pillars that I keep talking about 
indicates you'd be very wise to limit 

2089
01:42:24,481 --> 01:42:29,100
the amount of saturated fat and that's 
endorsed by every major medical society 

2090
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:29,770
in the world.
It's not controversial.

2091
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:31,730
It's not controversial.
I don't.

2092
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:36,960
I don't think it's conspiracy.
I think it's just the natural 

2093
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,481
progression of science.
When we used to think the world was 

2094
01:42:39,481 --> 01:42:40,030
flat,
but that's theirs were caused by stress,

2095
01:42:40,031 --> 01:42:40,920
but that's down there.

2096
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:45,970
There are a lot of things that have 
changed over time as the evidence 

2097
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:50,340
evolves and is we'd be.
We become more educated and aware of 

2098
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:55,700
some sort of a belief in a conspiracy.
Well,

2099
01:42:56,860 --> 01:43:00,340
chris is suggesting we got it wrong,
which means the american heart,

2100
01:43:00,390 --> 01:43:03,250
american college,
the world health institute of medicine,

2101
01:43:03,251 --> 01:43:07,150
the european society of atherosclerosis,
the australian society of health,

2102
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:08,510
all of these bleep,
bolded,

2103
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:11,170
tell you 10 percent or less saturated 
fat.

2104
01:43:11,171 --> 01:43:16,171
Some say as little as you could possibly
get in your diet have got it wrong and 

2105
01:43:16,171 --> 01:43:18,360
that suggests there's been a total 
misrepresentation of all the sciences.

2106
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:22,330
I paused for a second there.
What are their recommendations based on?

2107
01:43:22,331 --> 01:43:24,190
Is it based on old science?
No,

2108
01:43:24,191 --> 01:43:29,191
I mean these are long.
Have they been saying this and what is 

2109
01:43:29,191 --> 01:43:32,341
it based on?
And have they adjusted to this new 

2110
01:43:32,341 --> 01:43:32,341
science?
He's discussing [inaudible],

2111
01:43:32,341 --> 01:43:32,700
republican,
republican,

2112
01:43:32,701 --> 01:43:35,650
republican for the usta republishes 
every five years.

2113
01:43:35,651 --> 01:43:37,430
Two thousand and 16.
Not long ago.

2114
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:42,440
Five years.
Two thousand 16 was the last usd a 

2115
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:42,640
publication there.
We'll do it again in 20 slash 20.

2116
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:45,670
But doesn't this science change?
Not that fast.

2117
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:50,700
Not that fast.
There's nothing new since 2000 took 

2118
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:51,980
theme that rocks the idea that 21 
international got

2119
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:52,910
it wrong there.
Nothing.

2120
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:58,310
There isn't.
The 2015 report did not use.

2121
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:00,240
Um,
there was a,

2122
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:05,260
the usta setup,
the nutrition evidence library to help 

2123
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:07,340
conduct systemic reviews to answer some 
of these questions.

2124
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:12,341
And in the 2015 report,
the committee stated that it didn't use 

2125
01:44:12,341 --> 01:44:15,500
that database for 70 percent of the 
topics.

2126
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:18,170
And um,
the,

2127
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:23,440
the,
a lot of the guidelines hadn't used any 

2128
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:26,890
newer science from since 2010 and there 
had been large reviews as I just 

2129
01:44:27,201 --> 01:44:28,020
mentioned,
these,

2130
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:31,940
these three reviews that I mentioned,
one was in 2000,

2131
01:44:31,941 --> 01:44:36,941
13,
one was in 2017 and one was in 2018.

2132
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:42,910
These are the reviews of the randomized 
controlled trials that didn't show 

2133
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:45,260
increase in cardiovascular risk markers 
from saturated fat consumption.

2134
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:50,620
and then we had those observation 
reviews of observational studies of 

2135
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:51,560
300,000,
650,000

2136
01:44:51,561 --> 01:44:56,561
people.
I think the same thing will happen with 

2137
01:44:56,561 --> 01:44:56,561
saturated fat,
as I said in 2010,

2138
01:44:56,561 --> 01:44:58,250
they changed their recommendations on 
total fat.

2139
01:44:58,550 --> 01:45:02,210
They used to limit total fat and then 
they changed those in 2010,

2140
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:07,630
2015,
they changed their recommendation on 

2141
01:45:07,630 --> 01:45:08,660
dietary cholesterol.
And I think probably the next time,

2142
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:13,690
you know,
maybe it's the next time or maybe it's 

2143
01:45:13,690 --> 01:45:14,210
the time after that you'll see a change 
in the saturated fat guidelines.

2144
01:45:14,211 --> 01:45:17,060
And it's not a big conspiracy.
I'm not saying,

2145
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:18,350
you know,
it's not a conspiracy,

2146
01:45:18,351 --> 01:45:22,520
it's the advancement of science.
So your take is that these organizations

2147
01:45:22,521 --> 01:45:24,380
are behind the curve.
Yes.

2148
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:26,660
And if we want to talk about conflicts 
of interest,

2149
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:29,300
there are huge conflicts of interest in 
these organizations.

2150
01:45:29,301 --> 01:45:32,480
Something like 40 percent of the funding
of the uh,

2151
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:33,730
uh,
well,

2152
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,710
I don't want to get this number wrong,
but a lot.

2153
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:38,660
The american heart association,
american diabetic association,

2154
01:45:38,690 --> 01:45:41,690
a lot of these organizations have 
funding from big food.

2155
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:43,130
Um,
you know,

2156
01:45:43,131 --> 01:45:46,400
coca cola,
you talked to a nutritionist who goes to

2157
01:45:46,401 --> 01:45:48,230
these conferences and they,
you know,

2158
01:45:48,231 --> 01:45:52,460
there's like nestle bars and coca cola 
at the nutrition conferences.

2159
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:53,380
That's hilarious.
Yeah,

2160
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:54,680
it's hilarious.
This terrible,

2161
01:45:55,610 --> 01:45:56,460
wasn't it?
Yeah.

2162
01:45:56,461 --> 01:46:01,461
I mean it's,
it's actually funny and sad at the same 

2163
01:46:01,461 --> 01:46:03,611
time.
And so I'm not saying there's a big 

2164
01:46:03,611 --> 01:46:05,801
conspiracy,
but I am saying there's a problem in 

2165
01:46:05,801 --> 01:46:07,760
terms of scientific integrity when you 
have these organizations,

2166
01:46:07,761 --> 01:46:12,761
they're tasked with creating the 
guidelines that have these financial 

2167
01:46:12,761 --> 01:46:13,520
conflicts of interest.
That's not really how it should be,

2168
01:46:13,790 --> 01:46:18,790
but I don't,
I don't even want to go too far down 

2169
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:20,681
that road because we don't need to go 
there in order to show that the 

2170
01:46:20,681 --> 01:46:20,681
sciences,
what the,

2171
01:46:20,681 --> 01:46:23,360
what the science is showing and peer 
review journals.

2172
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:25,880
So joel,
what is wrong with what he just said?

2173
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:33,550
Well,
I'll say this until 2020 usda guidelines

2174
01:46:33,711 --> 01:46:38,711
come in.
Actually think he's factually wrong 

2175
01:46:38,711 --> 01:46:38,900
because he goes to a guideline,
say keep the percentage of calories from

2176
01:46:38,901 --> 01:46:42,590
saturated fat to 35 percent or less.
I could be wrong on that.

2177
01:46:42,591 --> 01:46:44,840
I'm not an encyclopedia.
I know they say,

2178
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:45,770
oh,
I agree with that.

2179
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:46,930
Well,
why?

2180
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:50,040
I said they changed their total,
their

2181
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,450
limitation on total fat in 2010.
And I,

2182
01:46:53,451 --> 01:46:58,451
I'm speculating that eventually changed 
their guidelines on saturated fat 

2183
01:46:58,801 --> 01:47:03,801
because the science has evolved and I 
will buy you guys are all paid trip to 

2184
01:47:03,801 --> 01:47:07,521
bali.
If you see in the 2020 guidelines that 

2185
01:47:07,521 --> 01:47:08,140
saturated fat is still not to be limited
to that.

2186
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:09,930
Right?
So what's wrong with what he said?

2187
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,860
Uh,
I,

2188
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:13,950
I don't know it just.
Well it's about.

2189
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:18,150
I agree there are conflicts of funding,
but they're not unique to any particular

2190
01:47:18,151 --> 01:47:19,420
sector.
Um,

2191
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:22,680
we just had one of the most famous food 
psychologist in Connecticut.

2192
01:47:22,681 --> 01:47:24,660
Brian wants it goes.
A hero of mine,

2193
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:26,690
said eden small plates because we 
didn't.

2194
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:28,740
SmAll plates.
You're mindful and you don't get obese.

2195
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:31,200
had to have six papers rejected and had 
to resign.

2196
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:33,030
It's pervasive.
It's a problem.

2197
01:47:33,031 --> 01:47:38,031
Doesn't mean there's not been any good 
scientists and I think most of the 

2198
01:47:38,031 --> 01:47:41,481
people we've been talking about are 
largely good scientists that their 

2199
01:47:41,481 --> 01:47:41,481
reputation hasn't been tainted.

2200
01:47:41,481 --> 01:47:43,080
I don't want to get,
get too Mired in this,

2201
01:47:43,081 --> 01:47:46,070
but if you look at the egg industry 
prior to 1990,

2202
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:50,370
about 30 percent of egg studies on 
nutrition,

2203
01:47:50,371 --> 01:47:52,350
we're funded by the egg board since 
1990.

2204
01:47:52,351 --> 01:47:54,480
It's 92 percent.
It's a conflict.

2205
01:47:54,481 --> 01:47:59,481
Who's got the money to study nutrition?
It's not the broccoli grower stop you 

2206
01:47:59,481 --> 01:47:59,610
because we're getting in the weeds 
again.

2207
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:03,450
What is wrong with what he said?
Well,

2208
01:48:03,451 --> 01:48:05,950
he's predicting that there'll be a 
change in the record.

2209
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:12,080
I think there's no,
there's no substantial new data on 

2210
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:15,180
saturated fat since 2015 hooper in 2016 
usta.

2211
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:20,130
That changes anybody to question that 
they should not recognize and follow the

2212
01:48:20,131 --> 01:48:25,131
leadership of 21 international societies
that are out there to try and improve 

2213
01:48:25,131 --> 01:48:28,950
the copy there because those 21 
international societies and all these 

2214
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:31,230
different organizations,
they rely on current science to make the

2215
01:48:31,231 --> 01:48:32,600
recommendations correct?
sure,

2216
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:32,950
sure.

2217
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:35,070
Okay.
And are they often behind the curve?

2218
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:36,430
I don't believe so.
The usda,

2219
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:41,440
it goes through this whole presence now.
They haven't published anything new 

2220
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:42,030
since 2016.
It's an expensive process,

2221
01:48:42,031 --> 01:48:44,430
but they did change.
Like he said,

2222
01:48:44,431 --> 01:48:49,431
they're total fat requirements.
They did change what they believe to be 

2223
01:48:49,431 --> 01:48:50,430
healthy and not healthy.
Um,

2224
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:52,650
well said.
They changed it in 2010.

2225
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:57,651
Correct.
It changed the limitation on total fat 

2226
01:48:57,651 --> 01:49:00,831
in 2010 and then they changed the 
limitation on dietary cholesterol in 

2227
01:49:00,831 --> 01:49:02,790
2015.
So they admit that the sciences advanced

2228
01:49:02,791 --> 01:49:05,640
and changed their perceptions of what is
in and is not healthy.

2229
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:08,340
So what's wrong with what he's saying 
aBout saturated fat?

2230
01:49:09,050 --> 01:49:09,940
Uh,

2231
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:13,280
they didn't chain saturated fat,
so if we stick just,

2232
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:14,950
they're,
they,

2233
01:49:15,230 --> 01:49:17,820
they rely on the current science.
Right?

2234
01:49:18,090 --> 01:49:23,090
So he's saying that the current science 
is showing that there is no negative 

2235
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:23,670
consequences of saturated fat.
That's bs,

2236
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:26,490
that's bs.
So what is wrong with these studies that

2237
01:49:26,491 --> 01:49:27,000
he's citing?

2238
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:27,550
Well,

2239
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:34,580
I don't know.
I have not read every article in the 

2240
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:34,580
world,
nor has chris.

2241
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:37,680
I don't know specifically.
There are three faMous studies that I've

2242
01:49:37,681 --> 01:49:38,310
read.
Siri,

2243
01:49:38,311 --> 01:49:40,170
torino,
chowdry and d'souza.

2244
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:42,420
Those have been dissected.
Those are event generally,

2245
01:49:43,290 --> 01:49:44,990
but you don't believe the ones that he 
cited?

2246
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:45,380
Well,
I don't,

2247
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:48,100
I don't know actually he would probably 
those to support

2248
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:53,100
his case,
but they've been so resoundingly 

2249
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:53,800
criticized that and they created fervor 
and I'll,

2250
01:49:53,801 --> 01:49:56,260
I don't know this sounding,
said it criticized.

2251
01:49:57,770 --> 01:50:02,770
I'm aware that there has been criticism,
but you could say the same thing about 

2252
01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:04,470
the vegetarian lifespan studies to the 
I,

2253
01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:09,490
a arc report on processing 
scientifically been debunked by any 

2254
01:50:09,991 --> 01:50:13,260
stretch of the imagination.
They are the papers stand.

2255
01:50:13,290 --> 01:50:16,320
The authors have defended against those 
criticisms.

2256
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:21,410
And uh,
it's nothing like what joel was talking 

2257
01:50:21,410 --> 01:50:23,800
about with brian wansink who had to re,
you know,

2258
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:26,920
all the papers were proven to be 
fraudulent and he had to retract them.

2259
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:30,030
It's nothing like that that has happened
with those papers and those were not the

2260
01:50:30,031 --> 01:50:31,240
ones that I cited anyway.
Yeah.

2261
01:50:31,490 --> 01:50:36,490
I just want to say the usd in 2015 said 
total fat intake should be 20 to 30 fiVe

2262
01:50:36,831 --> 01:50:39,890
percent of all your calories.
They didn't eliminate anything in 2010.

2263
01:50:39,891 --> 01:50:42,530
that's 2015.
I think that's a factual error,

2264
01:50:42,531 --> 01:50:47,531
chris.
They clearly change a cholesterol 

2265
01:50:47,531 --> 01:50:47,531
recommendation to say as little as 
possible.

2266
01:50:47,531 --> 01:50:51,580
They just didn't put a number on it.
We all know that my cardiology group 

2267
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:54,821
went bananas and got them to add that 
sentence as keep cholesterol as low as 

2268
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:54,821
possible.
Chris,

2269
01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:58,370
it says cholesterol is no longer a 
nutrient of concern,

2270
01:50:58,490 --> 01:51:00,980
but you were talking that they removed 
the total fat intake.

2271
01:51:00,981 --> 01:51:02,480
That's actually inaccurate.
It's right here.

2272
01:51:02,481 --> 01:51:03,770
I mean,
I'm going to get the guideline open,

2273
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:05,180
you know,
it is.

2274
01:51:05,181 --> 01:51:05,570
I mean,
we're,

2275
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:06,050
we're,
we're,

2276
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:11,060
we're allowed to make mistakes.
We're trying to incorporate the whole 

2277
01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:11,060
world literature and we're just two 
guys.

2278
01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:11,270
Was that a mistake,
chris?

2279
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:13,070
Right here.
I mean,

2280
01:51:14,150 --> 01:51:17,570
it's a mistake.
This mistake.

2281
01:51:17,571 --> 01:51:19,670
What did he say?
That we said that in 2010,

2282
01:51:19,671 --> 01:51:24,671
the usda guidelines which are supposed 
to be followed by schools and colleges 

2283
01:51:24,671 --> 01:51:26,270
and the rest removed the total fat 
percentage recommendation.

2284
01:51:26,271 --> 01:51:30,620
It remainS at 20 to thIrty five percent.
That's fairly modest fat intake.

2285
01:51:30,650 --> 01:51:32,260
I have to look at this,
the specific

2286
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:35,580
language to see.
My recollection is that the,

2287
01:51:35,890 --> 01:51:40,890
in the same way that there is some,
a contradiction with the cholesterol.

2288
01:51:42,461 --> 01:51:46,390
There's a sentence that says cholesterol
is no longer a nutrient of concern.

2289
01:51:46,450 --> 01:51:51,450
And then joel mentioned that he and his 
cardiologist friends got them to add 

2290
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:52,750
something back that was,
you know,

2291
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:55,010
kind of seem to step back from that.
Um,

2292
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:58,930
and I think the same thing happened with
total fat.

2293
01:51:58,931 --> 01:52:00,280
I don't know,
and I can't,

2294
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:03,100
I don't have it to look at right now.
Can we?

2295
01:52:03,310 --> 01:52:08,310
This is so because it's,
it seems like it's a major point of 

2296
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:11,011
dispute and joel says it isn't.
It isn't because the the still the 

2297
01:52:11,011 --> 01:52:15,700
question at hand is what do the meta 
analysis of randomized controlled trials

2298
01:52:15,701 --> 01:52:20,701
and what do the reviews,
large reviews of observational studies,

2299
01:52:20,771 --> 01:52:25,771
including over a million participants 
suggest about the influence of saturated

2300
01:52:26,681 --> 01:52:31,681
fat on important markers like heart 
disease and total mortality.

2301
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:36,720
I'm still waiting to hear about a study 
that shows that eating more saturated,

2302
01:52:38,070 --> 01:52:43,070
a convincing review of meta analyses,
a meta analysis of randomized control 

2303
01:52:44,081 --> 01:52:49,081
trials or even large observational data 
that lasted for more than a short period

2304
01:52:49,101 --> 01:52:54,101
of time that shows that eating saturated
fat and I'm not even talking about in 

2305
01:52:54,141 --> 01:52:57,500
the context of a healthy diet,
which is a whole other discussion,

2306
01:52:57,890 --> 01:53:01,400
but just in any diet increases the risk 
of heart disease.

2307
01:53:02,130 --> 01:53:07,130
Can I stop you please?
Because we were discussing this on the 

2308
01:53:07,130 --> 01:53:10,191
assumption that the usta had changed the
requirements for fat joel saying that's 

2309
01:53:10,351 --> 01:53:12,360
a mistake.
I really think we should clarify that.

2310
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:13,050
we should find out.

2311
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:15,930
Choose my plate.gov.
It's right here.

2312
01:53:15,931 --> 01:53:20,931
Two thousand 15,
2020 questions about the usda 

2313
01:53:20,931 --> 01:53:24,150
guidelines.
It said healthy diets can include up to 

2314
01:53:24,150 --> 01:53:24,600
35 percent of calories from fat.
They put a clearcut limit on it.

2315
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:25,390
It's right here.
I mean,

2316
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:27,460
I'm reading it and not making it up.
But.

2317
01:53:27,461 --> 01:53:28,890
So usda,
it's a government.

2318
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:32,520
So what was it that you remembered from 
2010 and did you remember it?

2319
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:37,440
Erroneously.
Let's see here.

2320
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:41,510
So fucking complicated.
Oh,

2321
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,110
it's so bad.
Yeah.

2322
01:53:43,111 --> 01:53:48,111
Each vegetables,
everything else follows and have some 

2323
01:53:48,111 --> 01:53:48,990
fun.
Love your fellow man.

2324
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:54,750
I have an anecdote.
Can I.

2325
01:53:55,030 --> 01:53:59,620
This came from a paper,
it was talking about the um,

2326
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:02,150
the shift and the guidelines and I need 
to,

2327
01:54:02,970 --> 01:54:04,790
um,
you know,

2328
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:05,550
if,
if,

2329
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:06,410
why don't you tell us,

2330
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,030
don't joel,
and we'll,

2331
01:54:08,031 --> 01:54:09,320
uh,
we'll get into this.

2332
01:54:09,330 --> 01:54:11,810
So I goTta tell ya,
I love chris kresser.

2333
01:54:11,811 --> 01:54:15,230
I want everybody to know that there's a 
very famous food doc in santa rosa named

2334
01:54:15,231 --> 01:54:20,231
john mcdougal.
He's been treated people with crazy 

2335
01:54:20,231 --> 01:54:21,800
plant based,
high complex carb diets.

2336
01:54:21,801 --> 01:54:26,801
He reverses diabetes.
isn't that his newsletter came out just 

2337
01:54:26,801 --> 01:54:27,080
as I'm pulling up here and bumped into 
chris.

2338
01:54:27,230 --> 01:54:29,000
We actually walked in exactly the same 
time.

2339
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:34,060
He quotes the new testament,
and I'm going to read this because as a 

2340
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:34,060
jewish boy,
I just got to read it.

2341
01:54:34,130 --> 01:54:37,040
One man.
Faith allows indeed everything.

2342
01:54:37,041 --> 01:54:38,810
There's some people around the table 
where they would do that.

2343
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:42,200
Another man's faith allows him to eat 
only vegetables.

2344
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:45,040
The man who eats everything must not 
look down on him.

2345
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:50,070
He eats only vegetables.
That man who does not eat everything 

2346
01:54:50,070 --> 01:54:50,070
must not condemn.
The man who does.

2347
01:54:50,070 --> 01:54:54,340
There should be peace.
I think that is such a freaking 

2348
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:56,621
beautiful cats because we do need to 
leave here as promoters of healthy 

2349
01:54:56,621 --> 01:55:00,761
lifestyles,
whether we call it the harvard school 

2350
01:55:00,761 --> 01:55:00,761
public health,
how to live 14 years longer,

2351
01:55:00,761 --> 01:55:02,510
the blue zones,
how to live like loma linda,

2352
01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:05,050
whether you want to eat game that you 
hunt,

2353
01:55:05,051 --> 01:55:09,110
that is probably eight times less 
saturated fat than what you're buying at

2354
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:10,250
the damn grocery store.

2355
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:15,520
You know people eat your vegetables.
People be really quality over quantity 

2356
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:20,020
and I'm going to tell you at some point,
let's talk about eating less and taking 

2357
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:21,080
some breaks for meetings so you can 
activate anti aging pathways,

2358
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:22,630
but um,
because you know,

2359
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:24,350
it isn't all food.
It's sometimes too much.

2360
01:55:24,351 --> 01:55:26,470
Food is probably one of the biggest 
problem for sure.

2361
01:55:26,471 --> 01:55:26,740
Sure.

2362
01:55:26,830 --> 01:55:28,390
For sure.
whether we all agree about that.

2363
01:55:28,420 --> 01:55:32,350
I think the real question is for someone
like me who really doesn't know.

2364
01:55:32,590 --> 01:55:33,510
Yeah,
I am.

2365
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:38,660
I'm baffled by the saturated fat dispute
because it seems to be there's one of 

2366
01:55:39,671 --> 01:55:42,850
you has got to be wrong here.
The evidence has got a point.

2367
01:55:42,851 --> 01:55:47,851
One or the other.
Chris is saying the evidence points to 

2368
01:55:47,851 --> 01:55:50,860
be not an issue at all and you're saying
your points to being a major issue 

2369
01:55:50,860 --> 01:55:55,590
worldwide consensus worldwide consensus,
one of these groups that rely on current

2370
01:55:55,591 --> 01:55:58,080
science that may or may not be behind 
the times.

2371
01:55:58,250 --> 01:56:00,410
Oh yeah.
And I want to step back and just clarify

2372
01:56:00,411 --> 01:56:02,850
my position here because I'm not saying,
you know,

2373
01:56:02,870 --> 01:56:05,630
we started by saying there's no one size
fits all approach.

2374
01:56:05,690 --> 01:56:10,690
Right?
So these studies just tell us about 

2375
01:56:10,690 --> 01:56:13,661
averages.
They tell us what happens on average 

2376
01:56:13,661 --> 01:56:14,870
when a group of people do something,
they don't tell us actually what happens

2377
01:56:14,871 --> 01:56:16,730
for person a,
person b,

2378
01:56:16,731 --> 01:56:19,010
person c,
and that can be different.

2379
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:20,030
So if you get,
like,

2380
01:56:20,031 --> 01:56:25,031
some people may experience a slight 
increase in their cholesterol from 

2381
01:56:25,031 --> 01:56:28,831
eating saturated fat,
some people might actually experience a 

2382
01:56:28,831 --> 01:56:29,630
slight decrease and on a net basis that 
averages out,

2383
01:56:29,770 --> 01:56:30,960
right?
Um,

2384
01:56:31,130 --> 01:56:36,130
I think the next,
the next generation of science is going 

2385
01:56:36,171 --> 01:56:41,171
to be more of an understanding of how 
various dietary components and various 

2386
01:56:42,801 --> 01:56:47,801
foods affect people on an individual 
level because let's say there's someone 

2387
01:56:47,801 --> 01:56:51,140
who's got genetic polymorphisms that,
that mean that for that person,

2388
01:56:51,141 --> 01:56:53,810
if they eat a diet that's very high in 
saturated fat,

2389
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:58,220
their ldl particle number,
which is a risk factor for heart disease

2390
01:56:58,221 --> 01:56:58,950
is going to go up.

2391
01:56:59,110 --> 01:57:01,520
I've seen that in my clinic.
Absolutely.

2392
01:57:01,521 --> 01:57:06,521
I'm not saying that saturated fat will 
never increased cholesterol or ldl 

2393
01:57:06,521 --> 01:57:09,590
particle number in people.
That's just not true.

2394
01:57:09,670 --> 01:57:12,190
And it will,
it will,

2395
01:57:12,250 --> 01:57:14,730
it will happen in some cases.
Um,

2396
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:17,360
but I'm just,
I'm reporting on the science,

2397
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:18,110
uh,
as,

2398
01:57:18,111 --> 01:57:23,111
in terms of the general question of is 
saturated fat going to increase the risk

2399
01:57:24,111 --> 01:57:29,111
of heart disease and is it going to 
increase the risk of death on average 

2400
01:57:29,301 --> 01:57:33,080
according to the available research?
And the answer to that is no.

2401
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:35,330
Now,
then the next question is,

2402
01:57:35,690 --> 01:57:40,690
should you joe eat a very diet high in 
saturated fat or should I or should 

2403
01:57:41,451 --> 01:57:43,190
jamie,
that's a different question.

2404
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:48,220
And unfortunately science is not.
we've been so focused on these 

2405
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:53,130
population level recommendations and the
idea that there's one diet that works 

2406
01:57:53,130 --> 01:57:56,650
for everyone and we don't have a lot of 
research that answers that question.

2407
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:59,570
That's a big gap in current science.

2408
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:01,290
Two questions.
One,

2409
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:06,291
did you find out if you made an error on
this 2010 requirement from the usta?

2410
01:58:06,690 --> 01:58:07,320
So

2411
01:58:07,650 --> 01:58:11,490
this came from a study that's,
that reference said,

2412
01:58:11,491 --> 01:58:15,000
despite a lack of evidence supporting 
low fat diets only in 2010,

2413
01:58:15,001 --> 01:58:18,660
did the dietary guidelines committee 
stop recommending limits on total fat?

2414
01:58:19,090 --> 01:58:24,090
Um,
but I don't have the full guidelines in 

2415
01:58:24,090 --> 01:58:24,090
front of me and,
and I,

2416
01:58:24,150 --> 01:58:27,930
I'm not sure what the language says so I
could have made an error.

2417
01:58:27,931 --> 01:58:28,380
It's possible.

2418
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:31,330
Okay.
so you made it based on that,

2419
01:58:31,390 --> 01:58:36,390
what you just said,
that was what assumption in another 

2420
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:38,911
study now in terms of saturated fat 
isn't there are an increased risk when 

2421
01:58:40,511 --> 01:58:42,160
you consume fat

2422
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:45,130
with refined sugars?
There absolutely is.

2423
01:58:45,131 --> 01:58:47,190
This is another example of where it's 
at.

2424
01:58:47,191 --> 01:58:49,540
Mcallen is context matters.
Well,

2425
01:58:49,541 --> 01:58:54,541
let me just even step back a second and 
say that the primary sources of 

2426
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:58,810
saturated fat,
and this is important to understand when

2427
01:58:58,811 --> 01:59:03,811
you're looking at epidemiological data,
so the sources of saturated fat in the 

2428
01:59:04,391 --> 01:59:07,540
american diet,
33 percent comes from pizza,

2429
01:59:07,541 --> 01:59:08,770
desserts,
candy,

2430
01:59:08,771 --> 01:59:10,900
potato chips,
pasta tortillas,

2431
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:12,460
burritos,
and tacos.

2432
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:16,750
I'm 24 And a half percent is unaccounted
for,

2433
01:59:16,751 --> 01:59:19,840
but most likely processed foods 
according to the authors.

2434
01:59:20,380 --> 01:59:25,090
And then 10 percent is almost 10 percent
sausages,

2435
01:59:25,091 --> 01:59:26,290
hot dogs,
bacon,

2436
01:59:26,890 --> 01:59:30,070
ribs and burgers.
So the vast majority of saturated,

2437
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:35,250
oh,
a 13 percent is chicken and mixed 

2438
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:37,921
chicken dishes.
I think kfc or chicken nuggets and eggs 

2439
01:59:39,731 --> 01:59:44,731
and mixed egg dishes,
so the vast majority of saturated fat 

2440
01:59:44,731 --> 01:59:46,420
that americans are eating is coming from
junk,

2441
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:48,990
right?
So even in an observational,

2442
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:54,030
even if we did see an increase in harm 
from saturated fat and observational 

2443
01:59:54,071 --> 01:59:57,010
studies,
we still couldn't say that that would be

2444
01:59:57,011 --> 02:00:00,760
true for someone who's eating what I 
would call like a neutral board diet,

2445
02:00:00,790 --> 02:00:02,230
which is,
you know,

2446
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:04,420
whole foods,
fruits and vegetables,

2447
02:00:04,421 --> 02:00:09,421
nuts and seeds,
and some starchy plants like sweet 

2448
02:00:09,421 --> 02:00:11,620
potatoes and animal products including 
saturated fat.

2449
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:16,620
We have no research that suggests that 
saturated fat in that context is 

2450
02:00:16,620 --> 02:00:21,181
harmful.
What is the mechanism that makes 

2451
02:00:21,181 --> 02:00:21,400
saturated fat more harmful when it's 
consumed with sugar?

2452
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:24,140
Well,
you have a,

2453
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:26,410
there is an interesting study that was 
done,

2454
02:00:26,610 --> 02:00:27,730
um,
by,

2455
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:31,450
uh,
that showed that in the context of a key

2456
02:00:31,451 --> 02:00:36,160
to genic diet where there's no,
no sugar essentially or very low amounts

2457
02:00:36,161 --> 02:00:39,280
of sugar,
that dietary saturated fat will actually

2458
02:00:39,281 --> 02:00:43,090
decrease blood levels of saturated fatty
acids.

2459
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:46,390
And that if you're eating refined 
carbohydrates,

2460
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:48,270
then you,
um,

2461
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:53,850
uh,
you see an increase in saturated fatty 

2462
02:00:53,850 --> 02:00:54,250
acids that comes from,
um,

2463
02:00:54,970 --> 02:00:58,310
the effects of insulin essentially.
Um,

2464
02:00:58,330 --> 02:01:03,330
let me find you the specific.
So if you're eating a high carbohydrate 

2465
02:01:03,330 --> 02:01:04,240
diet,
it will,

2466
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:10,140
uh,
increase insulin which inhibits the 

2467
02:01:10,140 --> 02:01:13,021
oxidation of saturated fat.
And So then when insulin levels are 

2468
02:01:13,021 --> 02:01:16,291
high,
saturated fat tends to be stored rather 

2469
02:01:16,291 --> 02:01:17,810
than beIng burned as fuel.
And then high carb diet can put an,

2470
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:19,500
and I'm mean,
refined carbs here,

2471
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:20,190
not,
um,

2472
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:24,490
fruits and vegetables can promote the 
synthesis of saturated fat in the liver.

2473
02:01:24,491 --> 02:01:29,491
So it actually causes the liver to make 
more saturated fatty acids in the serum.

2474
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:35,280
But this study here is a,
this showed that a controlled feeding 

2475
02:01:37,121 --> 02:01:40,400
studies have shown that refined 
carbohydrates,

2476
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:45,520
I'm,
will actually increase levels of 

2477
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:47,840
saturated fat in the blood.
Whereas eating saturated fat in the diet

2478
02:01:47,841 --> 02:01:48,880
does not.
If they're,

2479
02:01:49,130 --> 02:01:51,860
if the diet is not high in those 
carbohydrates.

2480
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:53,270
Joel,
what's your take on that?

2481
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:54,140
Uh,
you know,

2482
02:01:54,141 --> 02:01:56,550
the only key point I make to answer your
question,

2483
02:01:56,890 --> 02:02:01,890
chris,
is why does high sugar diets combined 

2484
02:02:01,890 --> 02:02:01,890
with high saturated fat diet?
It's because,

2485
02:02:01,890 --> 02:02:03,100
again,
go back to biochemistry.

2486
02:02:03,110 --> 02:02:05,630
This is serious science.
we're saturated fat.

2487
02:02:05,660 --> 02:02:09,650
It's usually found in meat and other 
animal based products.

2488
02:02:09,651 --> 02:02:13,170
It does exist in plants like a seminar,
avocado,

2489
02:02:13,171 --> 02:02:14,750
salmon,
and the olives and olive oil.

2490
02:02:14,900 --> 02:02:16,840
But anyways,
there's a pathway,

2491
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:18,260
get insights,
but it's real stuff.

2492
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:23,560
The pro,
the amino acids found in red meat out 

2493
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:26,491
combined with their saturated fat.
That's content triggers a pathway that 

2494
02:02:26,491 --> 02:02:27,410
accelerates aging.
You don't want to age fast.

2495
02:02:27,590 --> 02:02:30,170
That's called mtor pathway,
the igf one pathway.

2496
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:32,210
Then you eat a diet rich in sugar.
Well,

2497
02:02:32,211 --> 02:02:34,730
we know about chemistry right here in 
los angeles,

2498
02:02:34,731 --> 02:02:37,550
university of southern California.
Bow gerontology institute.

2499
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:42,740
Eat a lot of sugar.
You activate another aging pathway 

2500
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:43,670
called a pk ras,
and these two pathways,

2501
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:44,600
mtor,
igf one,

2502
02:02:44,601 --> 02:02:47,270
pk rest will make you an old man or an 
old woman quicker.

2503
02:02:47,450 --> 02:02:52,450
So when you're eating pastries,
which is high saturated fat and high 

2504
02:02:52,450 --> 02:02:54,350
sugar,
or you're eating a meal with a coke,

2505
02:02:54,380 --> 02:02:55,820
how common is that?
I mean,

2506
02:02:55,821 --> 02:02:57,230
my god,
a hamburger and a coke,

2507
02:02:57,410 --> 02:03:02,410
you're activating everything we know 
about science that will make you age 

2508
02:03:02,410 --> 02:03:02,410
faster.
That sucks.

2509
02:03:02,410 --> 02:03:07,390
So is that true?
That eating meat and the amino acids 

2510
02:03:07,390 --> 02:03:11,321
accelerate the aging process?
There's no studies that show that eating

2511
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:16,490
meat in the context of a healthy diet 
shortens your lifespan.

2512
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:17,930
And if,
if so,

2513
02:03:17,931 --> 02:03:21,380
if that were true,
then we would see that in the data.

2514
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:26,740
But joel,
you're talking about an actual physical 

2515
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:27,380
mechanism that accelerates the aging 
processes as well known that,

2516
02:03:27,381 --> 02:03:28,670
you know,
what is it called again?

2517
02:03:29,060 --> 02:03:30,090
Well,
it's empty.

2518
02:03:30,091 --> 02:03:33,740
Your igf one is one pathway.
And pk rest the chemistry is not.

2519
02:03:33,741 --> 02:03:35,480
I mean,
this is like high level science.

2520
02:03:35,481 --> 02:03:36,560
It's not,
I'm not,

2521
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:39,140
I'm not stretching on the limb here.
But um,

2522
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:43,100
you know,
protein is really amino acids.

2523
02:03:43,101 --> 02:03:44,270
You know,
I get this question,

2524
02:03:44,271 --> 02:03:45,860
you're a vegan.
Where'd you get your protein?

2525
02:03:45,861 --> 02:03:47,840
My answers.
Where do you get your amino acids?

2526
02:03:47,841 --> 02:03:52,841
Because my body breaks protein down into
the building blocks and then I build a 

2527
02:03:52,841 --> 02:03:53,210
backup to wherever the hell I needed for
its,

2528
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:54,620
you know,
acids in meat.

2529
02:03:54,621 --> 02:03:56,360
There's amino acids in my head,
a mommy,

2530
02:03:56,361 --> 02:04:00,410
wherever I want to get them.
The the split of those 20 amino acids is

2531
02:04:00,411 --> 02:04:02,240
different and meat than it isn't at a 
mommy.

2532
02:04:02,370 --> 02:04:05,390
There's more methodically and in a more 
loose and very technical stuff.

2533
02:04:05,430 --> 02:04:10,430
Leucine,
and there were some mixes that branch 

2534
02:04:10,430 --> 02:04:10,790
chain amino acids of lucy and I don't 
know what the hell that does your aging,

2535
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,520
but we do know that meet rich in 
matthias.

2536
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:18,540
Then we'll activate mtor and igf one,
and it is a very strong factor in aging.

2537
02:04:19,281 --> 02:04:22,430
You want a low mathiasson and diet,
so another reason,

2538
02:04:22,610 --> 02:04:27,610
plant based eaters,
you need to take be 12 to keep their 

2539
02:04:27,610 --> 02:04:27,610
homocysteine to methionine and down.
That's a separate topic,

2540
02:04:27,610 --> 02:04:32,230
but yes,
the amino acid mixed found in animal 

2541
02:04:32,230 --> 02:04:33,860
protein is different than the amino acid
mixed found in vegetable protein,

2542
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:36,650
which is why when morgan levine looks at
the question,

2543
02:04:36,870 --> 02:04:39,720
what is your survival?
What's your cancer risks?

2544
02:04:39,721 --> 02:04:42,450
Which are heart risk on animal protein 
and plant protein?

2545
02:04:42,451 --> 02:04:45,210
Plant protein beats the crap out of 
animal Protein.

2546
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:50,420
This is high level cell metabolism.
Try and publish a paper in cell 

2547
02:04:50,420 --> 02:04:54,141
metabolism.
Beat the crap out of animal protein 

2548
02:04:54,141 --> 02:04:56,960
because there's a 300 to 400 percent 
increase in cancer of those diets 

2549
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:01,850
concentrating on protein of animal 
source and there's a 25 percent 

2550
02:05:01,850 --> 02:05:04,971
reduction in cardiovascular disease cell
metasys in 2014 morgan levine of 

2551
02:05:04,971 --> 02:05:09,591
harvard.
Nobody's questioning or work october 

2552
02:05:09,591 --> 02:05:12,171
one,
2016 song at harvard animal protein 

2553
02:05:12,171 --> 02:05:15,360
plant protein lead to very different 
outcomes in large database observational

2554
02:05:15,361 --> 02:05:18,060
studies at the highest level because you
can't take 6,000

2555
02:05:18,061 --> 02:05:19,770
people in,
randomize them in that way.

2556
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:22,140
So if you're waiTing for that to resolve
the question,

2557
02:05:22,650 --> 02:05:23,440
you know,
good luck.

2558
02:05:23,650 --> 02:05:28,650
Actually not the case cd I irc panel 
that confirm that concluded that that 

2559
02:05:29,060 --> 02:05:33,200
processed meat led to an 18 percent 
increase in cancer risk,

2560
02:05:33,201 --> 02:05:37,610
which again is like indistinguishable 
from chance using that low of a relative

2561
02:05:37,611 --> 02:05:38,760
risk.
They.

2562
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:43,780
Their conclusion was that the fresh red 
meat lead was a point zero to one point 

2563
02:05:45,770 --> 02:05:50,770
zero two.
That's a two percent increase in many 

2564
02:05:50,770 --> 02:05:53,261
other studies have shown that 
unprocessed red meat is not associated 

2565
02:05:53,261 --> 02:05:58,241
with increase in cancer risk and is not 
associated with increase in heart 

2566
02:05:58,241 --> 02:05:59,390
disease risk.
So again,

2567
02:05:59,391 --> 02:06:02,240
you can talk about these proposed 
mechanisms all day long,

2568
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:07,460
but if it's not showing up in actual 
events that are meaningful to people,

2569
02:06:07,461 --> 02:06:12,461
then you might be missing something.
Maybe red meat does act in certain way 

2570
02:06:13,551 --> 02:06:16,190
that you might think would increase the 
risk of death,

2571
02:06:16,191 --> 02:06:19,010
but maybe it does other things that 
reduce the risk of death.

2572
02:06:19,011 --> 02:06:22,220
And that's why we can't just focus on 
mechanistic studies.

2573
02:06:22,221 --> 02:06:25,340
We have to look at actual endpoints that
matter to people

2574
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:28,910
in terms of the quality of animal 
testing cancer matter.

2575
02:06:28,911 --> 02:06:29,910
Chris and I know you know,

2576
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:35,300
said they don't know.
The studies don't show that fresh meat 

2577
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:38,430
increases the risk of fresh red meat 
increased the risk of death and cancer 

2578
02:06:38,430 --> 02:06:38,560
and heart disease.

2579
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:43,800
Joel,
what was the number that you were 

2580
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:43,800
saying?
300 percent.

2581
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:43,800
It's ready to anybody.
Look,

2582
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:44,640
March 4th,
2014 cell metabolism.

2583
02:06:44,690 --> 02:06:46,100
Morgan levine,
right here.

2584
02:06:46,110 --> 02:06:48,930
Animal protein.
Seventy five percent increase in death.

2585
02:06:48,931 --> 02:06:52,690
Four hundred percent increase in cancer 
over 18 year followup.

2586
02:06:52,890 --> 02:06:56,700
These findings were not found with plant
based protein.

2587
02:06:56,820 --> 02:07:00,050
So let's talk about reviews.
You're gonna reveal giants.

2588
02:07:00,430 --> 02:07:05,430
This is reviews our science tool.
You're saying that reviews of 

2589
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:09,831
observational studies and reviews of med
analyses are not science if you would 

2590
02:07:09,831 --> 02:07:12,090
prefer to draw conclusions based on a 
single study?

2591
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:17,180
No,
not that I wouldn't want to a single 

2592
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:19,341
state,
but this is very consistent with the 

2593
02:07:19,341 --> 02:07:19,341
overall high level of igf one.
pk,

2594
02:07:19,470 --> 02:07:19,710
I was

2595
02:07:19,710 --> 02:07:24,710
just referring to research that several 
large reviews that have not found a 

2596
02:07:24,710 --> 02:07:26,910
relationship between red,
fresh,

2597
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:30,480
red meat and cancer and fresh red meat 
and heart disease,

2598
02:07:30,510 --> 02:07:35,510
so professor to look at reviews.
That can include lots of studies and 

2599
02:07:35,861 --> 02:07:39,640
just a single study that supports a 
particular viewpoint.

2600
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:40,300
Maybe.

2601
02:07:40,900 --> 02:07:41,890
Maybe,
maybe,

2602
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:44,010
but we need more than.
Well,

2603
02:07:44,070 --> 02:07:45,640
okay.
The 300 percent,

2604
02:07:45,670 --> 02:07:47,330
what does that.
Let me let.

2605
02:07:47,590 --> 02:07:50,050
It's it's human study.
These are real lives.

2606
02:07:50,051 --> 02:07:52,150
These are real desks and these are real 
cancer cases.

2607
02:07:52,151 --> 02:07:57,151
This is.
This is the original science and in one 

2608
02:07:57,151 --> 02:07:59,911
of the highest level of epidemiology 
where they don't take into account all 

2609
02:07:59,911 --> 02:08:01,000
the other risk factors and then the rest
of their diet,

2610
02:08:01,001 --> 02:08:03,250
smoking,
sedentary lifestyle,

2611
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:05,030
obesity,
all the burial.

2612
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:07,720
I'll answer in a second to download the 
whole paper,

2613
02:08:07,721 --> 02:08:08,610
but you know,
they do that.

2614
02:08:09,010 --> 02:08:09,820
They do multivariate

2615
02:08:10,750 --> 02:08:15,750
noting that there is a 2011 meta 
analysis of 34 prospective studies on 

2616
02:08:15,750 --> 02:08:19,540
red meat and colorectal cancer,
which said the event that's 34 studies,

2617
02:08:19,570 --> 02:08:24,490
the available epidemiologic data are not
sufficient to support an independent and

2618
02:08:24,491 --> 02:08:28,840
unequivocal positive association between
red meat intake and colorectal cancer.

2619
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:32,080
um,
2015 meta analysis,

2620
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:37,400
um,
did find a relationship with processed 

2621
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:38,260
meat but did not find a relationship.
Uh,

2622
02:08:38,350 --> 02:08:43,330
with fresh red meat is also an issue of 
dose response.

2623
02:08:43,390 --> 02:08:46,090
If we,
if red meat did cause cancer,

2624
02:08:46,091 --> 02:08:51,091
then you'd expect to see a continuous 
increase in cancer rates as the intake 

2625
02:08:51,091 --> 02:08:55,051
of red meat increased.
But in many cases you actually see the 

2626
02:08:55,051 --> 02:08:58,531
opposite.
You can see a decrease in cancer rates 

2627
02:08:58,531 --> 02:08:58,531
and the people who ate the most red 
meat,

2628
02:08:58,531 --> 02:09:00,070
which cast some doubt on that 
association.

2629
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:02,470
Um,
and again,

2630
02:09:02,710 --> 02:09:05,740
we come back to the relative risks.
It like,

2631
02:09:05,810 --> 02:09:06,640
uh,
you know,

2632
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:08,740
uh,
even with processed meat,

2633
02:09:08,741 --> 02:09:13,741
it's only 18 percent and you have to 
consider the healthy user bias that we 

2634
02:09:13,741 --> 02:09:15,010
talked about before.
And with fresh red meat,

2635
02:09:15,011 --> 02:09:18,700
it's either nothing,
zero or maybe like two percent.

2636
02:09:19,090 --> 02:09:24,090
And that's just like that level in 
observational research is not 

2637
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:28,471
distinguishable from chance.
You cannot draw any concluSions on that 

2638
02:09:28,471 --> 02:09:32,100
and you cannot assume that someone who's
eating a nutrient or diet with fresh 

2639
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:35,530
whole foods and is including some red 
meat in that diet.

2640
02:09:35,531 --> 02:09:39,550
It's going to have the same response as 
someone who's eating pizza,

2641
02:09:39,551 --> 02:09:42,640
candy hot dogs,
and all kinds of other,

2642
02:09:42,730 --> 02:09:44,650
uh,
junk food that's just not,

2643
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:45,980
you know,
common sense will tell you.

2644
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:48,400
Hence the problem with these kinds of 
stuff.

2645
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:49,760
Exactly.
Joel,

2646
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:52,580
chris,
do you want a low igf one are.

2647
02:09:52,581 --> 02:09:55,460
Hi jeff.
One you want to low igf one?

2648
02:09:55,461 --> 02:09:57,530
You know,
just say I want to live a long,

2649
02:09:57,531 --> 02:09:58,220
healthy life.

2650
02:09:58,420 --> 02:09:59,770
I don't,
I don't want to be,

2651
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:03,910
I don't want to be.
I'm obsessing over individual markers.

2652
02:10:03,911 --> 02:10:04,650
I want to live.

2653
02:10:04,990 --> 02:10:08,040
I feel like a lot of markers when it 
comes to low carb steady,

2654
02:10:08,041 --> 02:10:10,890
she wanted a low igf one for survival.
The scientists strong.

2655
02:10:10,891 --> 02:10:15,891
This is la science,
so we're not making this stuff up 

2656
02:10:15,891 --> 02:10:18,510
anyways.
My thigh and into leucine and meat 

2657
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:18,630
raises igf one and at least periodically
take a break.

2658
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:22,020
Um,
raises insulin growth factor,

2659
02:10:22,590 --> 02:10:25,020
which will take your press prostate in 
your breast tissue,

2660
02:10:25,021 --> 02:10:27,480
makes it start growing at age 50,
which is the.

2661
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:29,190
Yeah,
because it's our males are for women,

2662
02:10:29,220 --> 02:10:30,050
for women.
Well,

2663
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:31,980
just because the frequency of breast 
cancer women,

2664
02:10:31,981 --> 02:10:32,980
it's women.
So you know,

2665
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:34,040
there is a relationship

2666
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:36,040
between animal products.
In breast cancer,

2667
02:10:36,060 --> 02:10:38,630
there's a opposite relations.
These are relationships.

2668
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:41,260
There is,
there are his petri dish.

2669
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,800
Let me just say,
go back about chemistry.

2670
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:44,730
You take breast cancer cells in a petri 
dish,

2671
02:10:44,731 --> 02:10:46,280
you put plant proteins,
they stopped growing.

2672
02:10:46,281 --> 02:10:47,900
You put animal proteins,
they start growing.

2673
02:10:47,901 --> 02:10:51,320
That's as pretty good science.
Now you say that's a petri dish.

2674
02:10:51,321 --> 02:10:53,150
They happen to be human breast cancer 
cells,

2675
02:10:53,151 --> 02:10:57,170
but until you do a randomized controlled
study of animal versus vegetable,

2676
02:10:57,200 --> 02:11:02,200
they won't be done.
Should a breast cancer patient eat more 

2677
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:02,200
broccoli?
Yeah.

2678
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:03,950
Let's dong the bell there again for 
sure.

2679
02:11:03,951 --> 02:11:06,950
And I can tell you how to book cook the 
broccoli so they get the best benefit.

2680
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:09,120
Eat broccoli sprouts.
She kept 50 times more than

2681
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:11,450
benefit that broccoli.
You were going to respond to that.

2682
02:11:12,530 --> 02:11:13,130
Yeah.
All right.

2683
02:11:13,131 --> 02:11:18,131
Come back to important endpoints,
total mortality or death from any 

2684
02:11:18,131 --> 02:11:18,450
causes.
Um,

2685
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:23,620
and diseases I'm not,
I'm not persuaded by mechanisms unless 

2686
02:11:23,620 --> 02:11:27,740
they're tied to outcomes that we care 
about.

2687
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:30,830
I think mechanisms are interesting,
but as I said,

2688
02:11:30,831 --> 02:11:31,840
if,
if you,

2689
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:36,230
you have to be aware that if foods have 
multiple effects,

2690
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:41,260
they might have one impact that you 
might think would lead to harm,

2691
02:11:41,271 --> 02:11:46,271
but then they could have several other 
impacts that would be beneficial and 

2692
02:11:46,271 --> 02:11:49,721
that's why you need to look at the real 
outcomes because there've been so many 

2693
02:11:49,721 --> 02:11:51,030
examples in the past of,
of,

2694
02:11:51,110 --> 02:11:56,110
of ideas where the mechanism that was 
originally proposed for the harm doesn't

2695
02:11:56,421 --> 02:12:01,421
turn out to be what we thought it was.
And so a total mortality is the most 

2696
02:12:01,421 --> 02:12:03,290
important endpoint.
Deaths from all causes,

2697
02:12:03,291 --> 02:12:07,370
but then also deaths from from specific 
conditions are important too.

2698
02:12:07,371 --> 02:12:12,371
And you and I would put that higher in 
the hierarchy of evidence and 

2699
02:12:12,371 --> 02:12:13,040
mechanisms.
Absolutely.

2700
02:12:13,250 --> 02:12:13,670
Joel,

2701
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:18,490
I don't know how you abandoned the 
unbelievable dedication and explosion of

2702
02:12:18,491 --> 02:12:23,491
scientists around the country and around
the world to come up with mechanisms of 

2703
02:12:23,491 --> 02:12:25,690
disease because we're on the verge of 
this unbelievable breakthrough to change

2704
02:12:25,691 --> 02:12:28,400
your genetics and alter your mechanism.
If you don't understand them,

2705
02:12:28,401 --> 02:12:33,401
you can't do it.
I think chris has it backwards more 

2706
02:12:33,401 --> 02:12:34,360
commonly.
Basic science drives Questioning a human

2707
02:12:34,361 --> 02:12:39,361
population and epidemiologic study and 
then maybe a randomized clinical trial 

2708
02:12:39,361 --> 02:12:40,000
that's usual progression.
Um,

2709
02:12:40,390 --> 02:12:43,660
for example,
we have not even talked cholesterol.

2710
02:12:43,661 --> 02:12:45,640
This literally has been all saturated 
fat.

2711
02:12:45,910 --> 02:12:48,850
Nineteen 75.
My mentors in dallas,

2712
02:12:48,851 --> 02:12:51,280
Texas,
but this is relevant in 2018.

2713
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:56,520
Brown and goldstein basic science.
Identify your liver cell has a receptor 

2714
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:57,790
called the ldl receptor.
Nobody knew it.

2715
02:12:57,940 --> 02:13:01,030
It completely controls the metabolism of
cholesterol in the body.

2716
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:06,240
They then find that there's a disease 
where you don't have that receptor in 

2717
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:06,940
your clusters.
A thousand and you die before you're 15.

2718
02:13:06,941 --> 02:13:08,920
And I took care of those children in 
dallas,

2719
02:13:08,921 --> 02:13:10,750
Texas in 1986,
1989.

2720
02:13:10,930 --> 02:13:15,040
From that came the development of a drug
called mevacor and lipitor and lovis.

2721
02:13:15,041 --> 02:13:18,160
Dad and all the rest,
and we were able to test in humans.

2722
02:13:18,430 --> 02:13:20,710
Does that basic science make a 
difference?

2723
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:23,800
Kaboom.
The forest study says you live longer.

2724
02:13:23,801 --> 02:13:25,420
If you have heart disease,
you need to take a step.

2725
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:26,590
Yeah,
there's side effects.

2726
02:13:26,591 --> 02:13:27,400
Yeah.
There's this and that.

2727
02:13:27,970 --> 02:13:30,490
Go down to the bottom line.
You want your ldl cholesterol.

2728
02:13:30,491 --> 02:13:32,130
Like loren,
the founder

2729
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:37,130
of the modern paleo movement said 50 to 
70 and it's all consistent across 

2730
02:13:37,130 --> 02:13:38,730
epidemiology.
Basic biochemistry,

2731
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:43,880
randomized clinical studies,
and what's the average ldl cholesterol 

2732
02:13:43,880 --> 02:13:48,141
and 100 gather in okinawa in loma linda.
Ldls are 70 or 80.

2733
02:13:48,211 --> 02:13:53,211
In fact,
humans are the only free living animal 

2734
02:13:53,211 --> 02:13:53,420
on the planet with an ldl cluster over 
80 [inaudible].

2735
02:13:53,421 --> 02:13:58,200
We eat and we gorge and we have jacked 
up saturated fat that drives our cluster

2736
02:13:58,201 --> 02:14:03,201
up.
We're the only animal on the planet and 

2737
02:14:03,201 --> 02:14:04,270
we're suffering terribly from policy 
there does saturated fat raises.

2738
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:09,800
That's the hope we need to keep coming 
back to dietary cholesterol and dietary 

2739
02:14:09,861 --> 02:14:14,861
saturated fat.
The evidence is showing that on average 

2740
02:14:14,861 --> 02:14:17,840
they do not raise cholesterol in the 
blood and even when they do that,

2741
02:14:17,841 --> 02:14:21,200
that doesn't translate into an increased
risk of heart disease.

2742
02:14:21,201 --> 02:14:23,330
That's what the data show we've talked.
I mean,

2743
02:14:23,331 --> 02:14:25,940
I don't know what more I can say.
Well actually we haven't.

2744
02:14:26,150 --> 02:14:28,070
We have a nutritionist I call bullshit 
on that.

2745
02:14:28,100 --> 02:14:30,680
It's called the heck aesthetic equation.
In the keys equation.

2746
02:14:30,770 --> 02:14:33,790
I shared the data on controlled feeding 
you.

2747
02:14:33,791 --> 02:14:38,791
You mentioned metabolic ward studies is 
as a high standard of evidence 

2748
02:14:38,791 --> 02:14:42,521
controlled feeding studies where 75 
percent of people experience no change 

2749
02:14:42,521 --> 02:14:47,231
in their blood cholesterol from eating 
to four eggs a day and not exit an 

2750
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:50,570
isolated topic because that's a 
cholesterol topic.

2751
02:14:50,571 --> 02:14:53,940
We have not talked cholesterol.
We've been talking saturated fat.

2752
02:14:53,980 --> 02:14:55,940
We talk to them about it right now.
Okay,

2753
02:14:55,941 --> 02:14:58,370
well,
but you just asked saturated fat and I'm

2754
02:14:58,820 --> 02:14:59,110
nervous.

2755
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:01,140
Cholesterol,
well,

2756
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:05,450
just saturated fat,
raised blood cholesterol to deny that is

2757
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:08,990
is whack and I'm sorry.
That's called the aesthetic equation.

2758
02:15:09,110 --> 02:15:11,020
Google it.
Look it up on wikipedia.

2759
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:16,260
It's called the keys equation.
That change and that change in saturated

2760
02:15:16,671 --> 02:15:19,380
fat raises choLesterol in the blood.
Yeah,

2761
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:21,380
it does.
It's known.

2762
02:15:21,390 --> 02:15:23,650
It's what chris is saying that it

2763
02:15:23,700 --> 02:15:24,180
does.
No,

2764
02:15:24,181 --> 02:15:26,880
I'd say I say it does some times to some
people,

2765
02:15:26,881 --> 02:15:31,770
but on average the studies are saying 
that it doesn't have a significant mr.

2766
02:15:31,910 --> 02:15:32,030
Right?

2767
02:15:32,180 --> 02:15:37,180
Get a large enough group of people,
you'll have some aberrations and some 

2768
02:15:37,180 --> 02:15:40,340
people will find a significant raise.
A rising of their cholesterol.

2769
02:15:40,510 --> 02:15:42,010
Yeah.
And that again,

2770
02:15:42,011 --> 02:15:47,011
more importantly people that the 
presumption here is that serum 

2771
02:15:47,011 --> 02:15:51,121
cholesterol where we care about it 
because it will increase your risk of a 

2772
02:15:51,121 --> 02:15:52,120
heart attack,
as I said before,

2773
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:55,490
large studies that have been forgotten 
about cholesterol.

2774
02:15:55,520 --> 02:16:00,520
Just analyze the relatIonship between 
saturated fat intake and heart attacks,

2775
02:16:01,150 --> 02:16:02,950
which is what everyone cares about,
right?

2776
02:16:02,951 --> 02:16:06,020
If they're thinking about cholesterol is
like the middle is,

2777
02:16:06,050 --> 02:16:07,120
is a,
um,

2778
02:16:07,390 --> 02:16:10,750
a mediator in that situation.
So they removed that and they just say,

2779
02:16:10,840 --> 02:16:14,290
does eating saturated fat increase your 
risk of heart disease?

2780
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:18,940
Not large review of 350,000
participants did not show a relationship

2781
02:16:18,970 --> 02:16:19,690
on average.

2782
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:24,720
So is the concept that cholesterol is 
just one factor and that perhaps we've 

2783
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:26,620
isolated it as more significant

2784
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:29,740
and then it really is in our typical 
reductionist paradigm.

2785
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:30,700
Absolutely.

2786
02:16:30,730 --> 02:16:34,120
There are many factors that contribute 
to heart disease and that's one of them.

2787
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:37,030
Um,
and so that's why again,

2788
02:16:37,031 --> 02:16:42,031
it's important to look at the studies 
that directly examine the relationship 

2789
02:16:42,031 --> 02:16:44,380
between saturated fat intake and heart 
disease.

2790
02:16:44,381 --> 02:16:46,840
Rather than doing this dance where we 
go,

2791
02:16:46,841 --> 02:16:51,841
does it increase cholesterol?
And then assuming that high cholesterol 

2792
02:16:51,841 --> 02:16:52,390
will lead to heart attack.
Joel,

2793
02:16:52,391 --> 02:16:54,460
I'm sure you can understand why this is 
so confusing for me.

2794
02:16:54,510 --> 02:16:59,510
I,
I actually feel really badly for your 

2795
02:16:59,510 --> 02:16:59,510
viewers and listeners.
No,

2796
02:16:59,510 --> 02:16:59,830
no,
they're going to be able to go over this

2797
02:16:59,831 --> 02:17:01,360
with a fine tooth.
This is so important.

2798
02:17:01,361 --> 02:17:06,361
I thank you both for doing this because 
this is the kind of conversation that 

2799
02:17:06,361 --> 02:17:09,811
you just don't get to have.
We get to experts with opposing views 

2800
02:17:09,811 --> 02:17:14,460
and you have a decent conversation where
you go over all the actual details of it

2801
02:17:14,801 --> 02:17:18,220
and you get to see how each one of you 
thinks about these things and how you've

2802
02:17:18,221 --> 02:17:19,250
drawn this conclusion.

2803
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:22,590
I agree With that actually.
I think it's great and all,

2804
02:17:22,591 --> 02:17:27,591
but you know,
we've had a couple moments of clarity 

2805
02:17:27,591 --> 02:17:30,630
and advice and I just want people to 
have as many as possible because it does

2806
02:17:30,631 --> 02:17:33,510
matter wHy a friend of mine says heart 
disease is not theoretical.

2807
02:17:33,511 --> 02:17:36,720
I mean we've had many 39 secOnd desk.
We've been doing this.

2808
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:38,250
So just to respond.
I mean,

2809
02:17:39,510 --> 02:17:42,090
does saturated fat rich diets race 
class?

2810
02:17:42,100 --> 02:17:42,810
I'll.
Absolutely.

2811
02:17:42,811 --> 02:17:47,811
It's such a tight relationship.
There's a line with a correlation that 

2812
02:17:47,811 --> 02:17:47,820
just straight up now.

2813
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:49,030
Can I pause you for a second?
Yeah.

2814
02:17:49,110 --> 02:17:54,110
Why?
What is wrong with these studies that 

2815
02:17:54,110 --> 02:17:56,151
he's showing that,
that show that it doesn't in most 

2816
02:17:56,151 --> 02:17:56,151
people?

2817
02:17:56,151 --> 02:17:56,710
No,
I believe,

2818
02:17:56,711 --> 02:18:01,711
and again there are studies that are 
being referenced but we're not looking 

2819
02:18:01,711 --> 02:18:04,921
at and that's a limitation we can live 
with that since 2010 the question has 

2820
02:18:04,921 --> 02:18:08,821
come up,
does an increase saturated fat causes 

2821
02:18:08,821 --> 02:18:11,460
coronary heart disease?
And that has been questioned in some 

2822
02:18:11,460 --> 02:18:14,251
studies.
The idea that it doesn't raise blood 

2823
02:18:14,251 --> 02:18:16,411
cholesterol is a to it.
It's the reason all the guidelines up 

2824
02:18:16,411 --> 02:18:16,810
there,
2015,

2825
02:18:16,811 --> 02:18:21,100
2016 still say limit saturated fat 
because that science hasn't changed.

2826
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:24,490
There's such a tight correlation.
The line is straight up.

2827
02:18:24,670 --> 02:18:28,180
Percentage of dietary fats presented 
dietary saturated fat,

2828
02:18:28,510 --> 02:18:29,620
blood cholesterol,
blood cholesterol,

2829
02:18:29,660 --> 02:18:32,680
the challenges,
how much yours is going to raise and how

2830
02:18:32,681 --> 02:18:37,681
much mine is going to raise going 
depending on your genetics and your 

2831
02:18:37,681 --> 02:18:38,320
microbiome and where you're starting.
If I ate a steak,

2832
02:18:38,321 --> 02:18:40,390
my cholesterol goes up.
If I ate an egg,

2833
02:18:40,391 --> 02:18:45,391
this has been shown because I don't eat 
any dietary cholesterol is a plant 

2834
02:18:45,391 --> 02:18:45,391
eater.

2835
02:18:45,391 --> 02:18:47,170
My cholesterol skyrockets.
You become habituated eating two,

2836
02:18:47,171 --> 02:18:50,590
three eggs a day in the curve flattens 
out after two,

2837
02:18:50,591 --> 02:18:55,591
three eggs a day,
which is four or 500 milligrams of 

2838
02:18:55,591 --> 02:18:55,810
cholesterol a day.
It's like if you smoke 20 cigarettes and

2839
02:18:55,811 --> 02:18:57,910
you go to 24,
going to be pretty hard to show.

2840
02:18:57,911 --> 02:19:02,911
Much of a difference to three eggs a day
for a chronic dieter is tough to 

2841
02:19:02,911 --> 02:19:07,381
challenge your body,
just creates a tolerance for it is 

2842
02:19:07,381 --> 02:19:09,370
there's a level of absorption that 
starts to level off,

2843
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:13,540
but I'm an interesting statistic.
A toothpick is 100 milligrams.

2844
02:19:13,541 --> 02:19:18,541
Most of us eat three to 400 milligrams 
of cholesterol day three to four 

2845
02:19:18,541 --> 02:19:18,541
toothpicks.
We're talking,

2846
02:19:18,690 --> 02:19:21,020
we're talking fat.
We're talking 150 grams.

2847
02:19:21,021 --> 02:19:25,390
So that's why the saturated fat,
it's like overwhelmingly more of a topic

2848
02:19:25,690 --> 02:19:29,210
than three to put three to four 
toothpicks of cluster holiday.

2849
02:19:29,310 --> 02:19:30,080
Okay,
hold on a sec.

2850
02:19:30,081 --> 02:19:33,030
Because he'd just come back to the 
studies.

2851
02:19:33,090 --> 02:19:38,090
Two to four eggs a day.
Controlled metabolic word feeding 

2852
02:19:38,090 --> 02:19:40,830
studies do not have any impact on blood 
cholesterol in 75 percent of people.

2853
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:46,760
That's pretty.
That's about as conclusive as the 

2854
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:47,070
evidence can get.
Well and reverends.

2855
02:19:47,340 --> 02:19:48,840
Okay,
I'll give one to you.

2856
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:55,200
I always have it.
And in they're always there at 

2857
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:55,200
[inaudible] dot com slash rogan.
Yeah.

2858
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:59,010
No,
and here it is.

2859
02:20:02,010 --> 02:20:06,090
If you,
if you google kresser saturated fat,

2860
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:08,850
you'll that the first article that comes
up.

2861
02:20:08,851 --> 02:20:11,110
So this is [inaudible],
uh,

2862
02:20:11,370 --> 02:20:16,370
from 2009 dietary cholesterol and 
coronary artery disease.

2863
02:20:16,501 --> 02:20:17,610
A systemic review.

2864
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:22,130
I'll just show I know your viewers.
Maybe your viewers can see it.

2865
02:20:22,131 --> 02:20:25,940
I don't know.
That's called saturated fat in the diet.

2866
02:20:26,030 --> 02:20:31,030
That's called changing your ldl.
That's called the line going up like a 

2867
02:20:31,030 --> 02:20:31,030
straight rocket

2868
02:20:31,030 --> 02:20:34,900
and that will have jamie pull it up on 
the big screen.

2869
02:20:34,940 --> 02:20:39,940
Yeah.
Anybody that googles it's called 

2870
02:20:39,940 --> 02:20:39,940
heggstad equation egg

2871
02:20:39,940 --> 02:20:44,200
t e d dot.
He's from the late 19 seventies.

2872
02:20:45,380 --> 02:20:46,450
This was,
I know,

2873
02:20:46,451 --> 02:20:50,530
but the heggstad equation comes from a 
heg said,

2874
02:20:50,531 --> 02:20:55,531
who was one of the doctors who was 
involved with the mcgovern report in 

2875
02:20:55,531 --> 02:20:58,771
1977,
which was the original report that led 

2876
02:20:58,771 --> 02:21:00,880
to the limitation on dietary cholesterol
and saturated fat.

2877
02:21:00,881 --> 02:21:02,300
So,
um,

2878
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:05,050
I think that's a little bit outdated 
perhaps.

2879
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:11,880
Like I said,
you know what joel just said though,

2880
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:15,990
if metta now,
as I said,

2881
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:17,460
one study doesn't,
you know,

2882
02:21:17,470 --> 02:21:22,470
the exception doesn't make the rule.
We have a med analysis of observational 

2883
02:21:22,470 --> 02:21:25,921
studies including 350,000
participants that found no relationship 

2884
02:21:26,621 --> 02:21:29,560
between saturated fat intake and 
cardiovascular disease.

2885
02:21:30,170 --> 02:21:33,870
The review of 25 rcts and 40 
observational studies,

2886
02:21:33,871 --> 02:21:38,871
650,000
people that concluded that replacing 

2887
02:21:38,871 --> 02:21:42,220
saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat 
doesn't lower the risk of cardiovascular

2888
02:21:42,221 --> 02:21:47,221
disease.
We have to look at the weight of the 

2889
02:21:47,221 --> 02:21:47,221
evidence.

2890
02:21:47,221 --> 02:21:49,980
We can't just choose one study or a 
mechanistic argument to support our 

2891
02:21:49,980 --> 02:21:50,060
view.
I mean,

2892
02:21:50,110 --> 02:21:52,690
what's your take that this study is 
flawed and out.

2893
02:21:52,770 --> 02:21:54,280
It's not a study that's,
uh,

2894
02:21:54,460 --> 02:21:55,170
that's,
uh,

2895
02:21:55,490 --> 02:21:57,300
he was,
uh,

2896
02:21:58,090 --> 02:22:03,090
an equation that was meant to represent 
the relationship between saturated fat 

2897
02:22:03,090 --> 02:22:07,681
intake and a blood cholesterol that was 
created created by a in,

2898
02:22:08,950 --> 02:22:11,610
in the late seventies that was 
originally involved in,

2899
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:16,680
in this diet heart hypothesis and the 
mcgovern report which led to the 

2900
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:18,820
restrictions on cholesterol and 
saturated fat in the first place.

2901
02:22:18,821 --> 02:22:20,740
So yes,
I am saying that we should be looking at

2902
02:22:20,741 --> 02:22:22,840
more recent evidence,
large reviews of meta,

2903
02:22:23,510 --> 02:22:26,400
of observational studies,
then meta analyses

2904
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:28,190
of randomized controlled trials.
that's,

2905
02:22:28,230 --> 02:22:32,250
that's the much more persuasive source 
of evidence for me,

2906
02:22:32,370 --> 02:22:36,240
joel.
it was based on metabolic ward,

2907
02:22:36,241 --> 02:22:41,241
carefully done studies at harVard.
It was the equation derived from human 

2908
02:22:41,241 --> 02:22:42,690
data and where you put people in 
changing their diet,

2909
02:22:42,691 --> 02:22:45,840
dietary change studies drives up ldl 
cholesterol ads,

2910
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:47,490
plotted out complaints,
very clear.

2911
02:22:47,610 --> 02:22:50,220
It's changing cholesterol to dietary 
saturated fat.

2912
02:22:50,370 --> 02:22:55,370
It's well accepted in the medical 
community and it's incorporated in the 

2913
02:22:55,370 --> 02:22:55,410
guidelines.
It'll never change.

2914
02:22:55,470 --> 02:22:58,740
Human physiology is not gonna change.
Ldl receptors don't change.

2915
02:22:58,860 --> 02:23:03,860
It all goes back to basic biochemistry 
and when we understand that we can 

2916
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:05,910
manipulate it to better health,
we can do it through pharmacology.

2917
02:23:05,911 --> 02:23:08,610
we can do through diet,
will be doing it through gene therapy,

2918
02:23:08,790 --> 02:23:11,520
stem cell therapy,
but we don't understand about chemistry.

2919
02:23:11,521 --> 02:23:14,160
We're cuttIng out a pillar.
We have to have for better health.

2920
02:23:15,240 --> 02:23:15,600
Chris,

2921
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:20,690
I don't know how many more times I feel 
like I'm just saying the same thing over

2922
02:23:20,691 --> 02:23:23,870
and over again.
We have to look at the research,

2923
02:23:23,900 --> 02:23:26,660
that weight of the evidence.
We have to look at randomized controlled

2924
02:23:26,661 --> 02:23:31,661
trials that actually look at what 
happens when people consume saturated 

2925
02:23:31,661 --> 02:23:35,891
fat and dietary cholesterol.
These studies as the mechanistic 

2926
02:23:36,591 --> 02:23:41,591
arguments are not persuasive.
If it's not happening in real in real 

2927
02:23:41,591 --> 02:23:45,221
people.
You're measuring in a randomized 

2928
02:23:45,221 --> 02:23:45,221
controlled trial.
You're controlling,

2929
02:23:45,221 --> 02:23:49,650
you're measuring what happens when 
people eat saturated fat and 

2930
02:23:49,650 --> 02:23:49,880
cholesterol,
and then you do a meta analysis of these

2931
02:23:49,881 --> 02:23:52,850
controlled trials and you're finding 
what I what I just said,

2932
02:23:52,910 --> 02:23:56,690
that's way more persuasive to me.
What is your take on that?

2933
02:23:56,730 --> 02:23:59,630
Joel?
The royal academy of the same,

2934
02:24:00,430 --> 02:24:05,430
just the royal academy of saying,
since we can give the nobel prize in 

2935
02:24:05,430 --> 02:24:06,870
medicine for what we're talking about 
and nobody's changed that.

2936
02:24:06,871 --> 02:24:11,871
I mean I totally disagree with chris,
that human physiology didn't change from

2937
02:24:12,391 --> 02:24:17,391
1985 nobel prize to 2018,
that it's that relationship between 

2938
02:24:17,391 --> 02:24:19,650
eating saturated fat,
lowering your ldl receptor,

2939
02:24:19,860 --> 02:24:21,240
raising your blood,
ldl,

2940
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:24,630
developing atheroma.
I go in at three in the morning and bust

2941
02:24:24,631 --> 02:24:27,170
open.
Your plaques you live has not changed.

2942
02:24:27,171 --> 02:24:32,171
Well,
how are these studies made and what's 

2943
02:24:32,171 --> 02:24:32,171
wrong with them?
Then the.

2944
02:24:33,930 --> 02:24:38,930
Nothing's changed about understanding 
the biochemistry of metabolism and 

2945
02:24:38,930 --> 02:24:39,300
cells.
Of course,

2946
02:24:39,301 --> 02:24:41,340
there's always advancements,
but uh,

2947
02:24:41,341 --> 02:24:44,640
the ldl receptor has led to the staten 
field,

2948
02:24:44,641 --> 02:24:47,610
a new class of drugs called pcsk nine 
inhibitors.

2949
02:24:47,970 --> 02:24:50,730
It's all because of the biochemistry 
that people are living longer,

2950
02:24:50,731 --> 02:24:55,731
living better.
There are plaqueS are being reduced 

2951
02:24:55,731 --> 02:24:58,280
through lifestyle medicine.
But thank god we also pharmacology 

2952
02:24:58,280 --> 02:24:58,280
that's advanced

2953
02:24:58,280 --> 02:25:02,280
wrong with these studies,
these studies that are showing these 

2954
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:03,160
results that he's descrIbing,
that you're disputing what is wrong with

2955
02:25:03,161 --> 02:25:04,690
these studies and what is wrong with 
their results.

2956
02:25:04,691 --> 02:25:04,820
Results.

2957
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:09,910
Again,
I would urge everybody to take the 

2958
02:25:09,910 --> 02:25:13,001
broad,
high level view of science and not 

2959
02:25:13,001 --> 02:25:15,491
pixels.
What's the basic biochemistry and now 

2960
02:25:15,491 --> 02:25:17,981
we're circling around what's the 
epidemiology with the Clinical 

2961
02:25:17,981 --> 02:25:18,320
randomized trials and what's a 
centenarian studies there?

2962
02:25:18,340 --> 02:25:23,340
There is no new data that you live to 
100 by adding saturated fat to your 

2963
02:25:23,340 --> 02:25:23,340
diet.
You may.

2964
02:25:23,340 --> 02:25:24,040
We're not talking about that.

2965
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:26,770
We're talking about the actual physical 
results on human bodies.

2966
02:25:26,771 --> 02:25:30,010
When you consume saturated fat,
what he's describing,

2967
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:35,330
take a new metabolic ward study that 
negated

2968
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:40,530
keys equation,
the state equation that there's linear 

2969
02:25:40,530 --> 02:25:42,901
relationship.
Three hundred 95 metabolic says it 

2970
02:25:42,901 --> 02:25:42,901
doesn't exist.
What are you saying to that,

2971
02:25:42,901 --> 02:25:46,981
chris?
A metabolic ward study that says eating 

2972
02:25:46,981 --> 02:25:49,021
saturated fat.
It would not take a job where we have 

2973
02:25:49,021 --> 02:25:51,631
randomized controlled trials which is a 
very high standard of evidence and 

2974
02:25:51,700 --> 02:25:56,440
observational data,
large amounts of observational data that

2975
02:25:56,441 --> 02:26:01,120
have been reviewed that answer this 
question and we we also,

2976
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:06,240
we have many rcts of low carb diets and 
even ketogenic diets that are not 

2977
02:26:06,311 --> 02:26:10,000
showing a significant impacts that.
Joel,

2978
02:26:10,001 --> 02:26:12,790
is it possible that this is,
here's a dietary,

2979
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:17,820
here's a 2018 review of all of the 
previous science on dietary cholesterol 

2980
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:21,820
in eggs,
and the conclusion says,

2981
02:26:21,910 --> 02:26:24,730
reese overall recent intervention 
studies with eggs,

2982
02:26:24,731 --> 02:26:26,350
recent,
uh,

2983
02:26:26,500 --> 02:26:31,500
demonstrate that the additional dietary 
cholesterol does not negatively affect 

2984
02:26:31,500 --> 02:26:35,141
serum lipids,
and in some cases appears to improve 

2985
02:26:35,141 --> 02:26:37,711
lipoprotein particle profiles like have 
a beneficial effect and hdl 

2986
02:26:37,711 --> 02:26:40,480
functionality which is the so called 
good cholesterol.

2987
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:45,960
And he talks about here in the 
conclusion that eggs shift ldl particles

2988
02:26:46,601 --> 02:26:49,570
to the less detrimental large buoyant 
ldl,

2989
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:54,600
which is less atherogenic.
He says eggs also typically increase 

2990
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:58,920
hdl.
He says that eggs probably have other 

2991
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:01,100
beneficial impacts on in terms of their 
phospho lippitt,

2992
02:27:01,101 --> 02:27:04,930
contact qa,
and that there's no relationship between

2993
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:08,080
the consumption of eggs and heart 
disease.

2994
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:12,750
So thIs is a 2018 review.
It's by christopher blessed.

2995
02:27:12,751 --> 02:27:15,850
So dietary cholesterol,
serum lipids and heart heart disease.

2996
02:27:15,851 --> 02:27:18,880
Are eggs working for and against you 
published in nutrients?

2997
02:27:18,910 --> 02:27:23,910
Joel,
is it possible that that's correct and 

2998
02:27:23,910 --> 02:27:24,130
that there's some misunderstanding about
the previous data?

2999
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:27,360
It's a different topic.
It's eggs,

3000
02:27:27,420 --> 02:27:29,730
it's cholesterol.
We were talking saturated fat.

3001
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:34,760
Does It raise your cholesterol?
So they're different topics and then 

3002
02:27:34,760 --> 02:27:35,130
we've introduced a very hot topic about 
ldl particle size,

3003
02:27:35,131 --> 02:27:36,870
which we should break down and talk 
about.

3004
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:38,850
So I'm not sure quite how to respond 
because we

3005
02:27:38,900 --> 02:27:43,900
got off track by shifting to 
consistently low carb and the eggs and 

3006
02:27:43,900 --> 02:27:45,350
other things.
We were talking about cholesterol,

3007
02:27:45,410 --> 02:27:46,160
what we're talking about

3008
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:50,300
raised blood cholesterol.
So I'm,

3009
02:27:50,420 --> 02:27:53,420
I stand by the fact human physiology 
will not change.

3010
02:27:53,420 --> 02:27:56,630
We have receptor understanding of human 
physiology advance.

3011
02:27:57,500 --> 02:28:00,070
Um,
I don't.

3012
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:01,420
Well,
I'll give you an example.

3013
02:28:01,540 --> 02:28:06,540
Until 20 years ago nobody ever heard a 
word pcs canine god or somebody gave us 

3014
02:28:08,441 --> 02:28:12,040
a protein in our blood.
Pcsk nine that goes to your Liver,

3015
02:28:12,100 --> 02:28:17,100
sits in a receptor,
causes the ldl receptor to go internal 

3016
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:17,860
and you're frigging blood cholesterol 
goes up.

3017
02:28:17,980 --> 02:28:21,100
Now there's a class of drugs that's an 
antibody to pcsk,

3018
02:28:21,620 --> 02:28:26,620
lowers your cholesterol draMatically,
and we're finding it reduces plaque and 

3019
02:28:26,620 --> 02:28:26,620
lowers your risk of heart attack.
Sure.

3020
02:28:26,620 --> 02:28:27,470
New science.
Amazing.

3021
02:28:27,471 --> 02:28:31,820
Totally consistent with what brown and 
goldstein showing that led to statens.

3022
02:28:31,970 --> 02:28:34,220
Now we have a new treatment.
That's a wonderful thing.

3023
02:28:34,221 --> 02:28:39,221
It didn't rock the boat a,
we still don't know to this day why we 

3024
02:28:39,221 --> 02:28:42,881
have that a protein in our Blood and if 
you're lucky enough to be born with a 

3025
02:28:42,881 --> 02:28:45,560
low level of pcsk nine,
your cholesterol is lower,

3026
02:28:45,620 --> 02:28:47,240
you have less disease,
you live longer.

3027
02:28:47,240 --> 02:28:52,240
That was part of the data I published in
2012 with brian ferentz at wayne state 

3028
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:52,610
university.
So yes,

3029
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:54,680
we've learned more about human 
physiology.

3030
02:28:54,710 --> 02:28:59,710
Totally consistent,
didn't disrupt anything and lead to 

3031
02:28:59,710 --> 02:28:59,710
better treatments.
That's great.

3032
02:28:59,710 --> 02:29:00,320
Um,
has,

3033
02:29:00,380 --> 02:29:03,500
has human physiology been challenged?
I'll give you another.

3034
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:05,760
We've learned,
and chris menTioned this,

3035
02:29:05,790 --> 02:29:07,760
I think it's fair to go there.
It's like a court of law.

3036
02:29:07,761 --> 02:29:12,761
he opened it up.
I'm cross examining nobody in the world 

3037
02:29:12,761 --> 02:29:15,731
ever heard the word of four letters.
T m a o 2011 cardiologists sitting at 

3038
02:29:16,071 --> 02:29:18,920
the cleveland clinic said,
there's got to be more in the blood that

3039
02:29:18,921 --> 02:29:20,330
hurts arteries.
Let's go find him.

3040
02:29:20,331 --> 02:29:23,000
They found this chemical.
They learned how to measure it.

3041
02:29:23,001 --> 02:29:24,830
They patent and how to measure it.
Tmao.

3042
02:29:24,980 --> 02:29:27,230
They took 4,000
people on the cath lab table.

3043
02:29:27,350 --> 02:29:32,350
They said,
I wonder if the level of tmao and the 

3044
02:29:32,350 --> 02:29:32,350
blood correlates with how clogged up 
your arteries are,

3045
02:29:32,350 --> 02:29:32,450
but doom.

3046
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:37,600
It worked perfect.
Then they figured out if you eat red 

3047
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:38,570
meat that has rich in l carnitine amino 
acids,

3048
02:29:38,571 --> 02:29:41,600
you eat exits rich and coleen and a 
nutrient,

3049
02:29:41,601 --> 02:29:43,220
I think amino acid and blanket for a 
minute.

3050
02:29:43,640 --> 02:29:46,490
Those directly led your liver to create 
tmao.

3051
02:29:46,670 --> 02:29:48,920
They took studies where they reduced 
carnitine,

3052
02:29:48,921 --> 02:29:50,960
reduced coleen.
The team mail goes down.

3053
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:56,080
What is tmao do it stunted your hdl so 
it doesn't reverse cholesterol 

3054
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:57,410
transport.
It causes ldl to enter the cell wall and

3055
02:29:57,411 --> 02:29:58,910
create foam cells.
Macrophages,

3056
02:29:58,911 --> 02:30:03,911
plaque and you get a heart attack.
It actually screws up your kidney and 

3057
02:30:03,911 --> 02:30:04,580
causes it to be fibrosis.
If you have heart failure,

3058
02:30:04,581 --> 02:30:06,710
diabetes,
or heart disease or hypertension,

3059
02:30:06,711 --> 02:30:09,650
you're tmao is up.
I've actually drawn more tmao levels.

3060
02:30:09,651 --> 02:30:12,050
I think any physician United States,
this is my baby.

3061
02:30:12,260 --> 02:30:17,260
New human physiology that has not led us
to back off the idea that limiting the 

3062
02:30:18,470 --> 02:30:23,470
animal product consumption in this case 
specifically egg yolk and red meat may 

3063
02:30:23,470 --> 02:30:23,470
have benefit to your health.

3064
02:30:23,470 --> 02:30:25,790
We just learned in the academy,
increased,

3065
02:30:25,870 --> 02:30:30,870
went in diet,
increases tmao orders of magnitude more 

3066
02:30:30,870 --> 02:30:34,220
hazard right in their fish flesh along 
with mercury and pcbs and ddt.

3067
02:30:34,250 --> 02:30:38,630
What is the association of seafood 
intake with heart disease mortality?

3068
02:30:38,660 --> 02:30:41,270
Can we use epidemiology studies or that 
they're off the table?

3069
02:30:41,271 --> 02:30:46,271
As I said before,
we can use epidemiology when we use it 

3070
02:30:46,271 --> 02:30:49,451
wisely,
but selective chris use it or don't use 

3071
02:30:49,451 --> 02:30:49,760
it.
I always use epidemiology.

3072
02:30:49,761 --> 02:30:54,761
One hundred percent of the job.
We've been talking about large reviews 

3073
02:30:54,761 --> 02:30:56,570
of epidemiology,
that that suggests that heart,

3074
02:30:56,720 --> 02:31:00,470
that saturated fat and cholesterol don't
increase the risk of heart disease.

3075
02:31:00,471 --> 02:31:05,471
So if you could answer Their question,
is the association of fish with 

3076
02:31:06,650 --> 02:31:11,650
cardiova,
what would most doctors and researchers 

3077
02:31:11,650 --> 02:31:14,710
say about fish consumption and 
cardiovascular disease and mortality was

3078
02:31:14,711 --> 02:31:19,711
since it has saturated fat,
most high level 2018 and advisors are 

3079
02:31:19,711 --> 02:31:20,010
two meals a week of

3080
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:25,010
fish.
Balancing out with 19 meals a week of 

3081
02:31:25,010 --> 02:31:26,940
plant based is the usda guidelines.
Answer the question long.

3082
02:31:27,020 --> 02:31:30,310
Can you look at the data?
There are a few things that,

3083
02:31:30,450 --> 02:31:35,450
that are associated with a greater 
decrease in cardiovascular disease risk 

3084
02:31:35,450 --> 02:31:37,620
than fish consumption of fruits and 
vegetables.

3085
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:42,680
Cmio is if you look at a graph and you 
can,

3086
02:31:42,781 --> 02:31:44,370
if you google,
um,

3087
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:46,860
let's see.
Maybe jamie,

3088
02:31:46,861 --> 02:31:49,260
you can pull this up.
Kresser tmao.

3089
02:31:50,290 --> 02:31:54,030
Um,
and you click on that first link,

3090
02:31:54,031 --> 02:31:59,031
red meat and tmao.
You scroll down and there's a picture of

3091
02:32:00,690 --> 02:32:02,310
jamie.
Where are you?

3092
02:32:02,311 --> 02:32:05,850
Ben?
There's a picture a scroll down.

3093
02:32:06,010 --> 02:32:08,580
I'm.
There you go.

3094
02:32:08,820 --> 02:32:13,770
So that picture shows the increase in 
tmao from eggs,

3095
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:14,880
beef,
cheese,

3096
02:32:14,881 --> 02:32:16,020
milk,
clams,

3097
02:32:16,021 --> 02:32:18,210
and then look at cod and halibut.
Wow.

3098
02:32:18,330 --> 02:32:20,910
Let me just see the reference data 
reference beef,

3099
02:32:20,970 --> 02:32:22,620
the references in the article.
Joel,

3100
02:32:22,670 --> 02:32:25,900
as always,
you can see it there,

3101
02:32:25,910 --> 02:32:29,190
there jan referenced,
that's not fair.

3102
02:32:29,420 --> 02:32:30,590
Chris,
master john.

3103
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:34,260
Um,
and not so cod and halibut or increasing

3104
02:32:34,261 --> 02:32:36,090
tmao,
as I said,

3105
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:38,640
orders of magnitude more than beef or 
eggs.

3106
02:32:38,641 --> 02:32:43,641
You can't even see eggs and beef there.
And the data show that fish consumption.

3107
02:32:44,491 --> 02:32:49,491
I think almost every public health 
authority would recommend would agree 

3108
02:32:49,491 --> 02:32:53,121
with this,
is reducing the risk of heart disease 

3109
02:32:53,121 --> 02:32:54,030
and mortality.
So tmao Is another mechanism,

3110
02:32:54,031 --> 02:32:57,650
it's another interesting mechanism,
but not very understood.

3111
02:32:57,660 --> 02:33:00,030
It's not fully understood and the,
and again,

3112
02:33:00,031 --> 02:33:05,031
we have to look at the data on red meat 
consumption and heart disease and 

3113
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:09,690
mortality to to really figure this out.
We can't,

3114
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:11,610
you know,
it's a speculative mechanism.

3115
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:15,000
I don't disagree that it's important to 
look at mechanisms,

3116
02:33:15,001 --> 02:33:18,300
but you can't draw conclusions based on 
them.

3117
02:33:18,301 --> 02:33:23,190
And this single fact about tmao just 
kind of blows the thing apart.

3118
02:33:23,610 --> 02:33:28,610
The other thing about tmao to know is 
that certain types of gut bacteria 

3119
02:33:29,070 --> 02:33:32,730
metabolize coleen and carnitine into 
tmao,

3120
02:33:32,731 --> 02:33:33,960
whereas others don't.

3121
02:33:34,140 --> 02:33:39,140
And so a lot of scientists have 
speculated that high tmao levels are 

3122
02:33:39,871 --> 02:33:43,140
essentially a result of a disrupted gut 
microbiome.

3123
02:33:43,950 --> 02:33:48,950
and that makes sense.
If you have 60 percent of the calories 

3124
02:33:48,950 --> 02:33:52,911
that americans are consuming or from 
ultra processed food and we know that 

3125
02:33:52,911 --> 02:33:53,460
that totally screws up the gut 
microbiome.

3126
02:33:53,850 --> 02:33:57,270
Then if you get a person eating a 
standard american diet,

3127
02:33:57,570 --> 02:34:01,290
then they're tmao.
Tmao levels may go up with red meat.

3128
02:34:01,291 --> 02:34:06,291
Whereas if you take someone who's got a 
healthy microbiome because they're 

3129
02:34:06,291 --> 02:34:07,950
eating lots of plant foods that support 
healthy gut,

3130
02:34:07,990 --> 02:34:12,990
then you may not see the same 
association and part of what supports 

3131
02:34:12,990 --> 02:34:16,911
that is a.
There's studies showing that rifaximin,

3132
02:34:17,170 --> 02:34:18,340
which is an antibiotic

3133
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:21,520
that treats bacterial overgrowth in the 
small intestine,

3134
02:34:21,521 --> 02:34:26,380
reduces serum tmao levels,
which suggests that it's mediated by the

3135
02:34:26,381 --> 02:34:31,381
gut microbiome.
So consumpTion of fish has been 

3136
02:34:31,381 --> 02:34:32,530
universally shown to decrease heart 
disease.

3137
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:38,280
The mechanism is interesting,
but overall it may be very complicated 

3138
02:34:38,741 --> 02:34:41,740
with many factors and we might not know 
all of them.

3139
02:34:41,800 --> 02:34:46,800
Yeah,
and then that's what takes us back to 

3140
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:48,511
let's look at the data on whether red 
meat increases the risk of death or 

3141
02:34:48,511 --> 02:34:51,160
heart disease.
Joel,

3142
02:34:52,110 --> 02:34:53,770
uh,
chris has referenced,

3143
02:34:53,771 --> 02:34:56,830
was giving credit to another bloggers 
article.

3144
02:34:56,831 --> 02:34:58,960
That's not science.
You'd have to go to the bloggers article

3145
02:34:58,961 --> 02:35:01,480
and look at it was number 16.
There is.

3146
02:35:01,990 --> 02:35:06,190
We have to find the reference.
Sloppy referencing.

3147
02:35:06,410 --> 02:35:10,140
Hold on,
let him explain what the references said

3148
02:35:10,150 --> 02:35:11,340
there that,
that graph came.

3149
02:35:11,690 --> 02:35:16,600
Explain number 15 is the reference 
dietary precursors of trimethylamine and

3150
02:35:16,601 --> 02:35:18,550
man,
a pilot study tmao.

3151
02:35:18,550 --> 02:35:20,530
Is that okay?
So it's not a blog.

3152
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:25,560
It's actually a tmao is a hot topic 
right now that is largely being 

3153
02:35:25,560 --> 02:35:27,910
researched in terms of a egg yolk and 
meat consumption.

3154
02:35:27,940 --> 02:35:30,520
It doesn't really matter.
It's not preliminary science.

3155
02:35:30,660 --> 02:35:31,050
No,
no.

3156
02:35:31,060 --> 02:35:36,060
It's not playing with science or coming 
up with pharmacologic agents right now 

3157
02:35:36,060 --> 02:35:36,940
to block it and we'll.
We'll see a new class of drugs they were

3158
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:41,960
just reported.
Is that with significant or is it more 

3159
02:35:41,960 --> 02:35:42,820
important to concentrate on gut biome 
and healthY diet?

3160
02:35:43,310 --> 02:35:43,840
Well,
why?

3161
02:35:43,850 --> 02:35:48,850
Why are we.
Why are we instantly giving the ball to 

3162
02:35:48,850 --> 02:35:49,990
pharmaceuticals?
You ask the question,

3163
02:35:49,991 --> 02:35:52,930
is there any new human physiology that's
relevant?

3164
02:35:52,931 --> 02:35:57,931
We've started with pcsk nine.
I'm introducing tmao is new human 

3165
02:35:57,931 --> 02:36:01,321
physiology that's relevant that could 
lead to improvements in clinical 

3166
02:36:01,321 --> 02:36:05,131
outcomes as suggested by observation.
We're talking about what he just showed 

3167
02:36:05,131 --> 02:36:05,131
him.
The graph.

3168
02:36:05,131 --> 02:36:09,410
Dismiss the graph.
Then he gave you a study for the graph 

3169
02:36:09,410 --> 02:36:09,410
and you just sort of glossed over it,
right?

3170
02:36:09,410 --> 02:36:09,580
I,
I,

3171
02:36:09,870 --> 02:36:13,240
I.
The one that contributed fish is a flush

3172
02:36:13,241 --> 02:36:18,241
source of tmao.
we can talk about whether fish in 2018 

3173
02:36:18,241 --> 02:36:20,410
is uniformly a healthy.
I'm not saying,

3174
02:36:20,411 --> 02:36:23,380
and he's also talking about gut biome,
gut bacteria,

3175
02:36:23,710 --> 02:36:28,710
then consumption of red meat being 
significantly less than the consumption 

3176
02:36:28,710 --> 02:36:32,371
of fish,
which is universally said to be a good 

3177
02:36:32,371 --> 02:36:32,371
thing for your heart.
A.

3178
02:36:32,371 --> 02:36:34,060
So a bunch of layers there.
Real quick,

3179
02:36:34,990 --> 02:36:39,990
everybody who studies tmao knows that 
the microbiome is a critical component 

3180
02:36:39,990 --> 02:36:41,530
to people can eat a steak.
It's classic study.

3181
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:44,320
Cleveland clinic study feed a vegan 
estate.

3182
02:36:44,350 --> 02:36:49,350
This is a classic cleveland clinic 
research study in the new england 

3183
02:36:49,350 --> 02:36:50,500
journal of medicine.
I don't make tmao why?

3184
02:36:50,501 --> 02:36:53,710
Because my microbiome was different than
yours feed and on the board of steak,

3185
02:36:53,711 --> 02:36:57,820
they make tmao within 12 hours now 
eating a standard american diet.

3186
02:36:58,330 --> 02:36:59,440
Sure.
But none the less,

3187
02:36:59,450 --> 02:37:04,450
it's pointed to the fact that it was the
microbiome you give a mouse meat and 

3188
02:37:04,450 --> 02:37:08,731
given an antibiotic that wipes out of 
microbiome a won't make tmao tmao 

3189
02:37:08,731 --> 02:37:12,151
dependency.
The microbiome dependency of tmao is 

3190
02:37:12,151 --> 02:37:12,151
well known science.
Um,

3191
02:37:12,151 --> 02:37:15,190
so that,
that is not denigrate the topic.

3192
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:16,640
I mean,
it's a side topic.

3193
02:37:16,641 --> 02:37:19,850
Is fish always healthy in a world of 
ddt?

3194
02:37:19,851 --> 02:37:22,520
pcb mercury.
I don't know about christmas practice,

3195
02:37:22,521 --> 02:37:27,521
but every patient I see gets blood 
mercury levels and those that eat 

3196
02:37:27,521 --> 02:37:28,790
routinely heavy or very often,
but that's another subject.

3197
02:37:29,160 --> 02:37:30,980
That's another subject,
but no,

3198
02:37:31,250 --> 02:37:34,190
you don't want to.
You want to look at old data on fish and

3199
02:37:34,191 --> 02:37:37,580
now I'm bringing up 2018 clinical.
That's not what he's doing.

3200
02:37:37,610 --> 02:37:42,610
We're not bringing up old data on female
beat up old data and I'm bringing 

3201
02:37:42,610 --> 02:37:47,290
relevant clinical materials about the 
absolute mechanism that's caused by the 

3202
02:37:47,991 --> 02:37:49,100
consumption of meat.

3203
02:37:49,130 --> 02:37:54,130
He brought up fish consumption which 
vastly elevates this and yet fish 

3204
02:37:56,391 --> 02:37:59,060
consumption is not correlated with heart
disease.

3205
02:37:59,061 --> 02:38:04,061
In fact,
it's correlated with people having 

3206
02:38:04,061 --> 02:38:06,041
healthier hearts,
so if you're suggesting to me is the 

3207
02:38:06,041 --> 02:38:08,210
recommendation today in this discussion,
eat fish,

3208
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:10,460
but limit egg yolk and meet.
I'd agree with that.

3209
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:15,520
That's not what it says because the fish
consumption vastly elevates what you 

3210
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:20,411
were saying was significant issue.
He's saying it's not a significant 

3211
02:38:20,411 --> 02:38:24,191
issue,
that it's a mechanism and it's an 

3212
02:38:24,191 --> 02:38:26,171
interesting mechanism,
but it's part of a much larger and 

3213
02:38:26,171 --> 02:38:28,100
probably very poorly understood 
situation.

3214
02:38:29,210 --> 02:38:32,120
I don't think that's completely true.
What we do know is that true?

3215
02:38:32,450 --> 02:38:33,070
Well,
yeah,

3216
02:38:33,110 --> 02:38:36,980
I would say that's true and I would say 
it's another proxy marker for crappy,

3217
02:38:37,520 --> 02:38:40,750
crappy diet.
What we know is that eating red meat and

3218
02:38:40,751 --> 02:38:44,330
the context of a standard american diet,
uh,

3219
02:38:44,510 --> 02:38:49,510
may slightly raise your tmao but not 
nearly as much as eating fish will.

3220
02:38:50,240 --> 02:38:54,260
So you brought up this tmao and he's 
basically just squashed that argument,

3221
02:38:54,430 --> 02:38:57,140
but I think he's a scientifically wrong 
because again,

3222
02:38:57,141 --> 02:39:02,141
the wealth of the body,
and I mean is that about tmao about 

3223
02:39:02,141 --> 02:39:06,230
female because what about the fish?
Because a few specific fish,

3224
02:39:06,290 --> 02:39:09,490
number one,
the way that egg yolk and red meat,

3225
02:39:09,491 --> 02:39:11,450
cleveland clinic,
new england journal medicine is,

3226
02:39:11,451 --> 02:39:15,770
is this a step of eden adjusting the 
precursor going through your microbiome,

3227
02:39:15,980 --> 02:39:20,980
going through an enzyme called 
[inaudible] and your small intestine 

3228
02:39:20,980 --> 02:39:21,980
going to your liver as tma and green 
metabolize it tmao.

3229
02:39:22,190 --> 02:39:24,140
That process is correlated with 
atherosclerosis,

3230
02:39:24,260 --> 02:39:29,260
atherosclerosis.
That process is correlated with 

3231
02:39:29,260 --> 02:39:29,260
increased activity of ldl within your 
cell wall,

3232
02:39:29,350 --> 02:39:32,180
leaded by epidemiologists,
bio chemistry,

3233
02:39:32,181 --> 02:39:34,730
biochemistry.
We know how it works in the petri dish.

3234
02:39:34,731 --> 02:39:39,620
That was the brilliance of this rapid 
development from 2011 to 2013 to now,

3235
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:41,820
so it's not in fish.

3236
02:39:41,910 --> 02:39:46,910
It hasn't been studied is if fish flesh 
already has preformed tmao.

3237
02:39:47,270 --> 02:39:49,730
We don't know if it activates ldl 
activation.

3238
02:39:49,731 --> 02:39:51,380
We don't know if it's dones.
Hdl.

3239
02:39:51,530 --> 02:39:54,290
Nobody's looked at the correlation of 
fish flesh,

3240
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:57,230
preformed tmao,
and a 4,000

3241
02:39:57,231 --> 02:40:02,231
patients studied in the cath lab table.
We don't know they're wonderful 

3242
02:40:02,231 --> 02:40:02,420
questIons to ask,
but until they're done,

3243
02:40:02,750 --> 02:40:07,750
there is reason to be concerned that 
there's a new pathway that might be 

3244
02:40:07,750 --> 02:40:09,410
involved in athletes talking about a 
totally different thing.

3245
02:40:10,070 --> 02:40:11,120
Yeah,
exactly.

3246
02:40:11,180 --> 02:40:16,180
If if consuming food that raises your 
tmao increased the risk of heart disease

3247
02:40:16,651 --> 02:40:19,080
and you'd see people who are eating the 
most fish,

3248
02:40:19,081 --> 02:40:24,081
having the most heart attacks,
and that's the opposite of what you see 

3249
02:40:24,081 --> 02:40:24,780
that that's.
I think that's reductionist because what

3250
02:40:24,781 --> 02:40:29,781
does fish out reductiveness to bring up 
tmao in the first place because you 

3251
02:40:29,781 --> 02:40:33,831
brought her even more than what I just 
said because I zoomed out a little bit 

3252
02:40:33,831 --> 02:40:35,310
to look at the actual relationship with 
mortality.

3253
02:40:35,490 --> 02:40:37,080
Well,
that was a blood level.

3254
02:40:37,081 --> 02:40:39,180
That's not atherosclerosis,
that's not outcome.

3255
02:40:39,181 --> 02:40:41,730
That's not kidney function.
That's not stroke risk and heart rates,

3256
02:40:41,731 --> 02:40:46,731
which happens about tmao.
I am talking about what that graph 

3257
02:40:47,731 --> 02:40:50,700
showed was tmao back it up.
You eat red meat,

3258
02:40:50,730 --> 02:40:55,730
you make tmao.
If your microbiome is of a certain 

3259
02:40:55,730 --> 02:40:55,730
constitution,
you eat egg yolk,

3260
02:40:55,730 --> 02:40:56,520
you make tmao.
If that's a certain constitution,

3261
02:40:56,670 --> 02:40:59,130
is it good to have high levels with tmao
and the blood,

3262
02:40:59,131 --> 02:41:00,660
whether they're from fish,
egg yolk,

3263
02:41:00,661 --> 02:41:02,370
or red meat?
The science of justice.

3264
02:41:02,371 --> 02:41:07,371
Not good.
What can you do to lower your 

3265
02:41:07,371 --> 02:41:07,371
[inaudible]?
Let me pause you.

3266
02:41:07,371 --> 02:41:10,580
Let me pause you.
How does the science suggests it's no 

3267
02:41:10,580 --> 02:41:13,281
good.
If there's large levels of tmao that 

3268
02:41:13,281 --> 02:41:13,281
come from fish and when you eat that 
fish,

3269
02:41:13,281 --> 02:41:15,900
it's directly correlated with less heart
disease.

3270
02:41:15,930 --> 02:41:19,670
What it would take an evaluation.
What's the calorie content of the United

3271
02:41:19,670 --> 02:41:21,030
States from cod,
halibut,

3272
02:41:21,210 --> 02:41:22,410
red meat and egg yolk.

3273
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:27,440
I would think the calorie content of egg
yolk and red meat is higher than cotton 

3274
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:31,710
helmet.
I don't have that data and that's a 

3275
02:41:31,710 --> 02:41:33,801
global perspective,
but if you are up to date in the 

3276
02:41:33,801 --> 02:41:33,801
scientists,
say,

3277
02:41:33,801 --> 02:41:35,010
I'd like to lead a lower tmao life,
which again,

3278
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:40,040
I'm going to say with all boldness,
I've drawn more blood levels on anybody 

3279
02:41:40,040 --> 02:41:42,921
in the United States.
I believe according to the cleveland 

3280
02:41:42,921 --> 02:41:44,841
heart labs,
you will want to do all steps to lower 

3281
02:41:44,841 --> 02:41:48,141
it and maybe you want to leave fishing 
because the complimentary benefit that 

3282
02:41:48,141 --> 02:41:52,341
fishes shown maybe from omega three 
speculative though we don't understand 

3283
02:41:52,341 --> 02:41:53,250
what you're talking about.
Tmi te,

3284
02:41:53,370 --> 02:41:55,140
te reo as a mechanism,
right?

3285
02:41:55,440 --> 02:41:59,250
It's purely speculative to say that the 
tmao from fish is healthy,

3286
02:41:59,251 --> 02:42:01,950
but the tmao from beef and eggs is not.
No,

3287
02:42:01,951 --> 02:42:04,680
I don't think it's have.
I don't think we know the answer because

3288
02:42:04,681 --> 02:42:07,140
it's seven year old science,
but you're stating it though.

3289
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:10,440
Now I'm not saying that you're studying 
the tmao is a massive concern.

3290
02:42:11,160 --> 02:42:14,190
That is scientifically true.
How is it scientifically true?

3291
02:42:14,191 --> 02:42:17,130
If there's so much tmao and fish and 
there's no concern?

3292
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:20,280
There's two species of fish that have 
the highest levels.

3293
02:42:20,281 --> 02:42:25,281
You saw the other levels or whatever.
They're the ones filling fish in 

3294
02:42:25,281 --> 02:42:27,610
general.
This isn't rare fish and we're not,

3295
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:31,830
we're not talking about higher.
We're talking about beef and eggs barely

3296
02:42:31,831 --> 02:42:35,590
even register on that grass.
Orders of magnitude higher.

3297
02:42:35,591 --> 02:42:38,630
Like what percentage looked like 20 
times.

3298
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:39,650
It was hiding.
Yeah,

3299
02:42:39,660 --> 02:42:42,120
I probably 20 fold higher.
Twenty four,

3300
02:42:42,150 --> 02:42:47,150
20 times higher.
Like I might've even mentioned that in 

3301
02:42:47,150 --> 02:42:47,750
my,
in my original article.

3302
02:42:47,970 --> 02:42:49,920
joel,
the problem is you brought up to mayo in

3303
02:42:49,921 --> 02:42:51,990
the first place.
Like it was this.

3304
02:42:52,170 --> 02:42:53,680
Well,
but let me just tell you,

3305
02:42:53,681 --> 02:42:54,340
okay,
let's,

3306
02:42:54,420 --> 02:42:58,230
let's everybody look at molecular 
nutrition food research.

3307
02:42:58,231 --> 02:43:03,231
2016.
Does fish protein when it elevates tmao 

3308
02:43:03,231 --> 02:43:05,850
accelerated atherosclerosis according to
a research study,

3309
02:43:05,851 --> 02:43:09,300
when fish raised tml,
they accelerate atherosclerosis.

3310
02:43:10,050 --> 02:43:12,340
Anybody can check the lead author.
I cannot

3311
02:43:12,340 --> 02:43:14,240
say the name yazdi gosh,
dee.

3312
02:43:15,070 --> 02:43:17,080
Conclusion reached,
um,

3313
02:43:17,340 --> 02:43:18,730
a,
a petri dish.

3314
02:43:18,731 --> 02:43:19,900
Data,
uh,

3315
02:43:19,901 --> 02:43:21,430
is a petri dish.
I'm looking for a minute.

3316
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:26,760
It's basic biochemistry.
What happens to atherosclerosis in 

3317
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:27,640
arteries when you feed this was a mouse 
data.

3318
02:43:27,880 --> 02:43:30,310
That's how you generate hypotheses.
Well,

3319
02:43:30,311 --> 02:43:34,840
it hasn't been done in humans yet.
It's not such a thing as pure fact.

3320
02:43:35,020 --> 02:43:40,020
Well,
the assumption is the fishes a 

3321
02:43:40,020 --> 02:43:40,020
superfood.
I've Already knocked It down for several

3322
02:43:40,020 --> 02:43:40,240
reasons.
One,

3323
02:43:40,350 --> 02:43:43,750
the fish intake is associated with 
increased risk of diabetes.

3324
02:43:43,751 --> 02:43:45,190
I'm sorry,
that's epidemiology.

3325
02:43:45,200 --> 02:43:48,910
Fish is here with inCreased risk of 
diabetes.

3326
02:43:48,911 --> 02:43:52,450
Yes,
it's got protein epidemiology studies.

3327
02:43:53,080 --> 02:43:55,330
So the question is,
is there a randomized study,

3328
02:43:55,331 --> 02:44:00,331
basic biochemistry.
You would understand that from the 

3329
02:44:00,331 --> 02:44:03,091
saturated fat content of fish.
It would be largely epidemiologic 

3330
02:44:03,091 --> 02:44:03,091
studies,
things like that,

3331
02:44:03,220 --> 02:44:05,110
but when you're saying epidemiology 
studies,

3332
02:44:05,111 --> 02:44:09,880
you're asking people what do you eat on 
a regular basis and if they say fish and

3333
02:44:09,910 --> 02:44:13,080
french fries and hot dogs,
right?

3334
02:44:13,090 --> 02:44:14,290
You say,
oh,

3335
02:44:14,380 --> 02:44:19,380
the fish is associated with an increase.
That's where it can happen and it's not 

3336
02:44:20,921 --> 02:44:21,640
isolated.

3337
02:44:22,290 --> 02:44:27,290
It's connected.
All the other things with that isolated 

3338
02:44:27,290 --> 02:44:27,750
what you're trying to isolate out things
by multivariate analysis.

3339
02:44:27,751 --> 02:44:29,240
Emmy is not one study,
it's many,

3340
02:44:29,550 --> 02:44:32,970
but diabetes and Fish really is that 
real?

3341
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:33,850
It's real.
It's

3342
02:44:34,940 --> 02:44:39,940
review that said that and review because
there's a 2012 review that does not find

3343
02:44:42,281 --> 02:44:46,060
any association between fish consumption
and diabetes.

3344
02:44:46,090 --> 02:44:51,090
So you're thinking this is for 440,000
people with an average of 11 year follow

3345
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:56,290
up published in the american diabetes 
association,

3346
02:44:56,350 --> 02:44:59,080
diabetes care journal.
So I.

3347
02:44:59,081 --> 02:45:01,580
Yeah,
I don't think you know it.

3348
02:45:01,670 --> 02:45:04,540
It's,
it's hard I think to make the claim that

3349
02:45:04,541 --> 02:45:09,541
fish consumption is harmful for the 
enormous weight of evidence and yes,

3350
02:45:11,051 --> 02:45:16,051
there are concerns now about toxins then
it might change over time and there are 

3351
02:45:16,051 --> 02:45:17,290
also issues with overfishing and all of 
that,

3352
02:45:17,291 --> 02:45:22,291
but on different story we're talking 
about just the association of fish 

3353
02:45:22,291 --> 02:45:25,810
consumption and health and longevity.
And I think if you've got 100 scientists

3354
02:45:25,811 --> 02:45:29,620
in the room,
maybe 99 of them would agree that that's

3355
02:45:29,790 --> 02:45:30,920
a,
that you know,

3356
02:45:30,940 --> 02:45:35,940
there are a few things in nutritional 
research that are less controversial 

3357
02:45:35,940 --> 02:45:35,940
than that.

3358
02:45:36,260 --> 02:45:37,690
Well maybe,
I mean I'm just,

3359
02:45:37,700 --> 02:45:39,320
I'm not making this shit up.
Journal,

3360
02:45:39,330 --> 02:45:44,330
american college and nutrition intake of
fish was correlated positively with the 

3361
02:45:44,330 --> 02:45:45,290
increased risk of diabetes.
I mean the science is out there.

3362
02:45:45,380 --> 02:45:48,950
Is it crystal clear as well defined as 
the head of state equation,

3363
02:45:49,220 --> 02:45:51,410
dietary saturated fat changing 
cholesterol?

3364
02:45:51,411 --> 02:45:56,411
No.
Is it an association that could be of 

3365
02:45:56,411 --> 02:45:56,420
concern and basic biochemistry said,
fish?

3366
02:45:56,421 --> 02:46:01,421
You have saturated fat that could 
possibly caused something called lipo 

3367
02:46:01,421 --> 02:46:01,610
toxicity fish.
You have animal protein.

3368
02:46:01,611 --> 02:46:06,611
We've already talked where animal 
proteins very different than plant 

3369
02:46:06,611 --> 02:46:06,611
proteins.
The concept is plausible.

3370
02:46:06,611 --> 02:46:07,370
Sure.
Is it resolved?

3371
02:46:07,371 --> 02:46:10,220
It's not resolved.
Is fish a better than eating

3372
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:14,620
fried chicken or a piece of affiliate 
hoagie stake?

3373
02:46:14,990 --> 02:46:15,990
Absolutely.
It's upsetting.

3374
02:46:16,060 --> 02:46:16,590
Just pull it up.

3375
02:46:16,650 --> 02:46:18,480
Then up here it says the findings is not
supportive.

3376
02:46:18,481 --> 02:46:23,481
Beneficial effect of total fish type of 
fish or epa and dha intake on the risk 

3377
02:46:25,741 --> 02:46:28,110
of type two diabetes.
Alternatively,

3378
02:46:28,380 --> 02:46:33,380
other dietary components such as 
selenium and unmeasured contaminants 

3379
02:46:34,141 --> 02:46:35,670
present,
present in fish.

3380
02:46:35,671 --> 02:46:36,510
Might explain

3381
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:37,870
jamie,
dude,

3382
02:46:37,871 --> 02:46:42,871
read the sentence.
Total fish intake was associated 

3383
02:46:42,871 --> 02:46:45,190
positively with the risk of type two 
diabetes that says there's epidemiology.

3384
02:46:45,191 --> 02:46:50,191
That should be further studied,
but maybe somebody wants to cut back 

3385
02:46:50,191 --> 02:46:53,860
their fish,
but we're looking at a single study here

3386
02:46:54,440 --> 02:46:56,140
to look at the weight of evidence.
Jamie,

3387
02:46:56,141 --> 02:46:57,070
you're bad man.

3388
02:46:57,550 --> 02:47:02,550
A minute.
It says findings do not support a 

3389
02:47:02,550 --> 02:47:06,311
beneficial effect of total fish type of 
fish or epa dpa on the intake,

3390
02:47:07,761 --> 02:47:11,080
on the risk of type two diabetes like 
it,

3391
02:47:11,390 --> 02:47:15,560
lean fish was associated with developing
type two diabetes.

3392
02:47:15,561 --> 02:47:18,650
Fatty fish was not because you probably 
want that omega three,

3393
02:47:19,220 --> 02:47:24,220
but you know,
I'm not telling anybody it's a resolved 

3394
02:47:24,220 --> 02:47:24,220
issue.
Is that yours?

3395
02:47:24,220 --> 02:47:27,840
Sang tma from animal protein is what 
causes this problem?

3396
02:47:28,781 --> 02:47:28,850
No,

3397
02:47:28,900 --> 02:47:32,580
it's actually more specific.
It's coleen and carnitine in egg yolk.

3398
02:47:32,581 --> 02:47:34,030
It's not really animal protein.
That's.

3399
02:47:34,190 --> 02:47:37,440
But you said the tmao tmao.
Tmao is.

3400
02:47:37,441 --> 02:47:40,650
Okay,
so what's in meat?

3401
02:47:40,651 --> 02:47:45,651
That's not good for you.
although if you're hungry on an island 

3402
02:47:45,651 --> 02:47:45,651
and you're dying,
eat meat,

3403
02:47:45,651 --> 02:47:50,361
we all recognize it,
but if you're looking for optimal 

3404
02:47:50,361 --> 02:47:52,431
health,
you should be concerned about saturated 

3405
02:47:52,431 --> 02:47:54,621
fat content.
You should be concerned that animal 

3406
02:47:54,621 --> 02:47:57,150
protein accelerates aging and igf one is
it,

3407
02:47:57,151 --> 02:47:59,430
but proven that animal protein 
accelerates aging.

3408
02:47:59,650 --> 02:48:00,960
well.
if he says no,

3409
02:48:00,961 --> 02:48:05,810
we should just stop because that's it's 
world class science.

3410
02:48:05,811 --> 02:48:10,811
I mean,
just because you say it doesn't mean we 

3411
02:48:10,811 --> 02:48:13,320
did go visit a possibility that high 
intakes of mathias [inaudible],

3412
02:48:13,370 --> 02:48:18,370
which isn't one of the amino acids in 
animal protein in the absence of 

3413
02:48:19,321 --> 02:48:24,321
sufficient intakes of glycine,
which is another amino acid that's in 

3414
02:48:24,321 --> 02:48:27,510
animal proteins and an intake of 
nutrients like b,

3415
02:48:27,511 --> 02:48:30,120
12 and b,
six and b,

3416
02:48:30,121 --> 02:48:31,440
nine,
which is full eight.

3417
02:48:31,800 --> 02:48:36,800
Could some of the animal studies suggest
that that has an effect on longevity,

3418
02:48:36,991 --> 02:48:40,320
but this is why I've always been an 
advocate of eating nose to tail,

3419
02:48:40,380 --> 02:48:45,380
so not just eating lean meats that are 
very high and matthias and making sure 

3420
02:48:45,380 --> 02:48:46,840
you're getting enough of the glycine 
rich foods,

3421
02:48:46,841 --> 02:48:48,270
the bone broth,
et cetera,

3422
02:48:48,720 --> 02:48:51,280
and then you're also eating plenty of,
you know,

3423
02:48:51,290 --> 02:48:56,290
a mixed diet that contains 12 and full 
eight and b six and the other nutrients 

3424
02:48:56,581 --> 02:49:01,581
that balance out the effects of excess.
MatthIas matheny as well as fiber for a 

3425
02:49:01,581 --> 02:49:02,220
healthy gut.
Absolutely.

3426
02:49:02,221 --> 02:49:05,280
And when you pulled up that conclusion,
no fiber in meat,

3427
02:49:05,310 --> 02:49:06,820
no meat,
yeah.

3428
02:49:06,850 --> 02:49:08,160
Will you eat other things?

3429
02:49:08,610 --> 02:49:13,500
I've never argued.
I've never bad except Sean Baker.

3430
02:49:13,830 --> 02:49:18,830
Well,
there's a whole nother ball of wax or 

3431
02:49:18,830 --> 02:49:21,861
that whole carnivore diet conclusions at
accumulated evidence generated from this

3432
02:49:22,951 --> 02:49:27,951
meta analysis does not support the 
overall inverse association of fish or 

3433
02:49:27,951 --> 02:49:30,920
fish oil intake with incidents of 
diabetes.

3434
02:49:31,290 --> 02:49:36,290
That'S saying that they couldn't confirm
increase fish intake doesn't lower the 

3435
02:49:36,290 --> 02:49:40,641
risk of diabetes.
It's not saying that it increases the 

3436
02:49:40,641 --> 02:49:40,641
risk.

3437
02:49:40,641 --> 02:49:44,350
So it says it's not a,
there's no relationship there taking 

3438
02:49:44,350 --> 02:49:46,190
place.
So it's not that no one's saying that it

3439
02:49:46,191 --> 02:49:48,900
causes diabetes.
So whatever it does.

3440
02:49:49,030 --> 02:49:49,520
When,
when,

3441
02:49:49,530 --> 02:49:50,090
uh,
where,

3442
02:49:50,150 --> 02:49:52,120
where does it say that it causes 
diabetes?

3443
02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:57,160
What does this study nobody said to.
Cause this is classic association 

3444
02:49:57,160 --> 02:49:58,220
because you don't know if it's the 
protein,

3445
02:49:58,221 --> 02:49:59,600
the fat,
the mercury,

3446
02:49:59,601 --> 02:50:03,780
the pcbs and ddt.
The people that are fish die.

3447
02:50:03,790 --> 02:50:05,300
Yeah.
They're eating fish and chips.

3448
02:50:05,610 --> 02:50:06,540
Tv.
Absolutely.

3449
02:50:06,950 --> 02:50:11,390
This is clearly not to the level of 
saying processed red meat causes cancer.

3450
02:50:11,391 --> 02:50:16,391
This is saying fish consumption in some 
studies is associated with type two 

3451
02:50:16,391 --> 02:50:17,360
diabetes.
These are heavily flood studies.

3452
02:50:17,361 --> 02:50:20,480
Would you agree?
I wouldn't throw them all under the bus.

3453
02:50:20,630 --> 02:50:21,980
You know,
that's how science works.

3454
02:50:21,981 --> 02:50:23,890
I mean,
it slowly plods forward,

3455
02:50:23,891 --> 02:50:24,440
smiling.

3456
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:27,410
Yeah,
I mean we,

3457
02:50:27,570 --> 02:50:32,570
we were starting,
joe brought up tmao and then that's how 

3458
02:50:32,570 --> 02:50:36,821
we got onto fish in diabetes.
I think there is no strong evidence that

3459
02:50:37,041 --> 02:50:40,220
fish causes diabetes.
Eating fish causes diabetes.

3460
02:50:40,221 --> 02:50:45,221
There's a lot of evidence that suggests 
that eating seafood reduces 

3461
02:50:45,221 --> 02:50:47,840
significantly the,
the incidence of cardiovascular disease.

3462
02:50:47,841 --> 02:50:52,841
And again,
if tma out were a problem then eating a 

3463
02:50:52,841 --> 02:50:53,570
lot of fish,
it should not have that impact.

3464
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:56,120
I believe that this is probably.
Well I shouldn't say you believe.

3465
02:50:56,121 --> 02:50:59,330
Do you believe this is from essential 
fatty acids that are found in fish,

3466
02:50:59,331 --> 02:51:00,770
particularly fatty fish?

3467
02:51:01,380 --> 02:51:06,380
Yeah.
I think that's plausible given what we 

3468
02:51:06,380 --> 02:51:07,080
know about epa and dha,
which are the long chain essential fatty

3469
02:51:07,081 --> 02:51:12,081
acids and their benefits and it could be
fish is also a really great source of 

3470
02:51:13,561 --> 02:51:16,800
selenium as,
as that one study said 16 and the tWenty

3471
02:51:16,801 --> 02:51:19,740
five top sources of slain income from 
ocean fish.

3472
02:51:20,190 --> 02:51:22,740
Fish is a great source of bioavailable 
protein.

3473
02:51:23,070 --> 02:51:25,240
Um,
there are lots of reasons why,

3474
02:51:25,270 --> 02:51:27,360
why fish consumption could be 
beneficial.

3475
02:51:27,450 --> 02:51:27,960
So

3476
02:51:28,360 --> 02:51:33,360
in your opinion,
tHis sort of highlights that there's a 

3477
02:51:33,360 --> 02:51:36,481
lot of complex different moving parts 
that we dOn't totally understand and 

3478
02:51:37,781 --> 02:51:42,781
that this is why you don't want to rely 
completely on just the mechanisms and 

3479
02:51:43,720 --> 02:51:47,480
these things that are occurring in petri
dishes or mice studies or

3480
02:51:47,780 --> 02:51:49,190
things along those lines.
Yeah.

3481
02:51:49,191 --> 02:51:53,600
So going back to the bradford hill 
criteria that we mentioned before,

3482
02:51:53,601 --> 02:51:58,601
which are ways of kind of determining 
whether associations that should show up

3483
02:51:59,181 --> 02:52:01,220
and observational studies might be 
causal.

3484
02:52:02,410 --> 02:52:05,620
The plausibility one of one of the 
criteria is mechanism.

3485
02:52:05,621 --> 02:52:06,430
Is there a plausible

3486
02:52:06,430 --> 02:52:11,430
mechanism that could explain the 
relationship between this variable and 

3487
02:52:11,430 --> 02:52:12,600
that variable?
But there are other criteria,

3488
02:52:12,620 --> 02:52:13,840
strength,
consistency,

3489
02:52:13,841 --> 02:52:15,580
specificity,
temporality,

3490
02:52:15,800 --> 02:52:20,800
plot,
a biological gradient like a dose 

3491
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:20,800
response.
Um,

3492
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:22,600
coherence experiment analogy.
So yes,

3493
02:52:22,630 --> 02:52:23,830
mechanisms are great.
We,

3494
02:52:23,831 --> 02:52:27,050
it's important to study them.
I'm all for that and we,

3495
02:52:27,090 --> 02:52:31,300
we absolutely need to correlate them 
with real outcomes and real human beings

3496
02:52:31,301 --> 02:52:36,130
to see both in observational studies 
that are well designed and in randomized

3497
02:52:36,131 --> 02:52:38,290
controlled trials to see if it makes 
sense.

3498
02:52:38,291 --> 02:52:40,900
And the tmao.
I think it's a great example of that.

3499
02:52:41,270 --> 02:52:46,270
Does it,
is it fair to say that we really just 

3500
02:52:46,270 --> 02:52:46,610
are looking at a puzzle and we don't 
have all the pieces?

3501
02:52:46,640 --> 02:52:51,640
I think you can say that in many cases 
and in this case for sure.

3502
02:52:52,490 --> 02:52:57,490
Yeah.
I disagree that there's a tremendous 

3503
02:52:57,490 --> 02:52:59,981
group and you can pull this up.
If we went jamie called true health 

3504
02:52:59,981 --> 02:53:00,050
initiative,
it's more than 400,

3505
02:53:00,051 --> 02:53:05,051
I'd call world experts on nutrition 
fairy divergent food philosophies,

3506
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:10,600
paleo mediterranean plants specifically 
disagreeing well so that there's no 

3507
02:53:10,600 --> 02:53:15,431
consensus to advise the public on a 
healthy diet for humans.

3508
02:53:15,690 --> 02:53:17,720
They disagree.
That's what we said.

3509
02:53:17,900 --> 02:53:19,740
That's what we.
What we said was that there's.

3510
02:53:19,790 --> 02:53:22,550
It's a complex puzzle and we don't have 
all the pieces.

3511
02:53:22,610 --> 02:53:23,450
Well,
I agree with that,

3512
02:53:23,451 --> 02:53:26,420
but we have enough to make 
recommendations because we have enough.

3513
02:53:26,570 --> 02:53:31,570
We have enough to make recommendations 
to the public and the true health 

3514
02:53:31,570 --> 02:53:31,570
initiative has crystallized that.

3515
02:53:31,570 --> 02:53:36,350
Okay,
but that's not what we were discussing 

3516
02:53:36,350 --> 02:53:36,350
right there about recommendations to the
public.

3517
02:53:36,350 --> 02:53:39,761
We were talking about mechanisms and 
whether or not it's understood all the 

3518
02:53:39,761 --> 02:53:42,290
different moving pieces in terms of how 
your body absorbs nutrients and food.

3519
02:53:43,250 --> 02:53:48,250
It's good.
It's an endless flow of new knowledge 

3520
02:53:48,250 --> 02:53:48,250
and that's what I said,
but why?

3521
02:53:48,250 --> 02:53:50,090
Why did you disagree with that?
I didn't disagree with it.

3522
02:53:50,140 --> 02:53:53,480
I completely agree with you.
I disagree when he said that.

3523
02:53:53,481 --> 02:53:57,290
That's an accurate assessment that we 
don't have all the pieces to the puzzle.

3524
02:53:57,310 --> 02:54:02,310
We definitely go to have all the pieces.
We have enough to make recommendations 

3525
02:54:02,310 --> 02:54:03,560
and then we'll reevaluate and all.
Do you want another new meat problem?

3526
02:54:03,860 --> 02:54:05,330
It's coolest.
Latest science.

3527
02:54:05,360 --> 02:54:06,200
Sure.
Okay.

3528
02:54:06,470 --> 02:54:11,470
Jamie,
will you go to please meet allergy on 

3529
02:54:11,470 --> 02:54:11,870
google,
university of Virginia,

3530
02:54:12,020 --> 02:54:14,900
atherosclerosis.
So little tolerance meat allergy.

3531
02:54:14,901 --> 02:54:18,080
You wait and go to the second tick.

3532
02:54:18,200 --> 02:54:19,130
Oh,
you got a baby.

3533
02:54:19,131 --> 02:54:20,890
You are so good.
Joe lactose,

3534
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:26,040
my gel.
I am so overwhelmed by your science and 

3535
02:54:26,040 --> 02:54:26,990
I mean that sincerely.
You see the one that says nih?

3536
02:54:27,410 --> 02:54:32,410
It's a number to hit and google,
but this is something that is caused by 

3537
02:54:32,480 --> 02:54:37,480
an adverse reaction to it.
You've got to listener here who's in 

3538
02:54:37,480 --> 02:54:41,171
Virginia.
Maybe you see a segue question whether 

3539
02:54:43,130 --> 02:54:45,200
the average person should eat meat 
though,

3540
02:54:46,090 --> 02:54:50,420
but if you get started with this here,
go ahead.

3541
02:54:50,421 --> 02:54:55,421
So this is diabetes.
I don't know if I'd go to the second 

3542
02:54:55,421 --> 02:54:55,421
one,
you'll have the picture just real quick.

3543
02:54:55,421 --> 02:54:56,960
Okay.
You live in Virginia,

3544
02:54:57,140 --> 02:54:59,690
you end up putting god.
You're right.

3545
02:55:00,140 --> 02:55:05,140
You end up,
you end up on my cath table because 

3546
02:55:05,140 --> 02:55:05,960
you're in the emergency room for 
whatever reason.

3547
02:55:05,990 --> 02:55:07,910
Okay.
I draw a blood sample on you.

3548
02:55:07,940 --> 02:55:12,940
Twenty four percent of those people have
a antibody to alpha gal,

3549
02:55:13,641 --> 02:55:17,150
which is a carbohydrate found in meat 
and that shocks people.

3550
02:55:17,160 --> 02:55:20,540
There are carbohydrates and mainly red 
meat specifically and only red meat,

3551
02:55:20,541 --> 02:55:23,510
specifically 24 percent of Virginia and 
so the antibody,

3552
02:55:23,600 --> 02:55:27,470
so that was interesting and some are now
developing anaphylaxis,

3553
02:55:27,650 --> 02:55:29,870
carrying epi pens because they've 
immediate allergy.

3554
02:55:29,871 --> 02:55:32,660
that isn't two point four percent is 24 
percent have the antibody,

3555
02:55:32,870 --> 02:55:37,870
but what was discovered university of 
Virginia is if you then look at their 

3556
02:55:37,870 --> 02:55:39,290
heart arteries by ultrasound,
the more plaque they have,

3557
02:55:39,291 --> 02:55:42,110
the higher is there.
Tighter the antibody brand new science.

3558
02:55:42,200 --> 02:55:47,200
It's an association.
Nobody knows there is of course the 

3559
02:55:47,200 --> 02:55:48,200
possibility of inflammation from immune 
activation.

3560
02:55:48,620 --> 02:55:49,850
That's wild data.
Now,

3561
02:55:49,851 --> 02:55:52,280
I don't wish that on people.
I wished we live in a world,

3562
02:55:52,281 --> 02:55:57,281
but people didn't have nut allergies,
didn't have lactose in towns and didn't 

3563
02:55:57,281 --> 02:56:00,791
have meat allergies,
but the reality is there may be a 

3564
02:56:00,791 --> 02:56:03,611
pathway previous unknown that is hot,
and this all goes back to your question.

3565
02:56:04,340 --> 02:56:07,750
Is there any new physiology about this 
whole stop you right there.

3566
02:56:07,760 --> 02:56:11,990
This is a pathogen activated allergy 
that's from a pretty severe.

3567
02:56:11,991 --> 02:56:14,660
People don't walk around with this 
without knowing that they have it.

3568
02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:18,560
They have severe allergic reactions.
It's basically like lyme disease,

3569
02:56:18,670 --> 02:56:23,670
that lactic.
We're not talking about like a mild gi 

3570
02:56:24,861 --> 02:56:29,861
discomfort when we're talking about us.
I don't think this is a mechanism that 

3571
02:56:29,861 --> 02:56:30,940
has existed for a long time to explain 
anything,

3572
02:56:30,970 --> 02:56:35,970
but this is something that's only been 
discovered over the last couple of 

3573
02:56:35,970 --> 02:56:39,380
decades.
Of those 24 percent that have the 

3574
02:56:39,380 --> 02:56:39,380
antibody,
very few had the full clinical syndrome,

3575
02:56:39,380 --> 02:56:40,490
but it's still correlated with heart 
disease.

3576
02:56:40,520 --> 02:56:42,710
The point is,
keep an open mind.

3577
02:56:42,890 --> 02:56:45,510
I don't see the data accumulate and 
getting healthier.

3578
02:56:45,560 --> 02:56:48,320
can I ask you this?
Do you think that it's because they have

3579
02:56:48,350 --> 02:56:53,350
a mild case of this tick borne disease 
or this tickborne disease is like 

3580
02:56:53,690 --> 02:56:56,540
because it is fairly recent in terms of 
our discovery of it,

3581
02:56:56,541 --> 02:56:59,300
is it advancing and evOlving and getting
more potent?

3582
02:57:00,080 --> 02:57:05,080
I doubt you know,
the basic biochemistry of meat and the 

3583
02:57:05,080 --> 02:57:05,300
carbohydrates and meet have changed.
It has the.

3584
02:57:05,890 --> 02:57:10,890
Has the lone star tick become more 
frequent naps,

3585
02:57:14,170 --> 02:57:19,170
cross reaction between glyphosate and 
being bit by a tick and our intestinal 

3586
02:57:19,170 --> 02:57:23,411
permeability.
There's all kinds of crazy ideas that 

3587
02:57:23,411 --> 02:57:24,380
need to be pursued because some of them 
will run santos round off.

3588
02:57:25,870 --> 02:57:27,810
It's fair.
It's,

3589
02:57:28,490 --> 02:57:31,070
it's all their correlation is not 
causation.

3590
02:57:31,120 --> 02:57:34,280
we know you agree with this job.
We didn't have to keep that in mind.

3591
02:57:34,281 --> 02:57:38,300
I mean it's that there's a great study 
done in one of my favorites.

3592
02:57:38,860 --> 02:57:43,860
It was purposely done to illustrate the 
danger of assuming that correlation 

3593
02:57:43,860 --> 02:57:48,070
equals causation.
It was a study done of the most common 

3594
02:57:48,070 --> 02:57:52,601
diagnoses for hospitalization in Canada.
10 point 6 million people and they found

3595
02:57:53,301 --> 02:57:58,301
that 24 diagnoses were significantly 
associated with the participants 

3596
02:57:58,301 --> 02:58:02,040
astrological science,
so people

3597
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:07,040
who are born under the sign of leo had a
15 percent higher risk of being 

3598
02:58:07,171 --> 02:58:10,140
hospitalized for gi,
gastrointestinal hemorrhage,

3599
02:58:10,141 --> 02:58:15,141
and sagittarians had a 38 percent higher
risk of being hospitalized for an arm 

3600
02:58:15,141 --> 02:58:18,580
fracture.
Now remember the the candidates,

3601
02:58:18,581 --> 02:58:23,581
the proposed increase in risk of for for
process meat and cancer is 18 percent,

3602
02:58:24,660 --> 02:58:28,770
so these risks are on the process at the
same process,

3603
02:58:28,771 --> 02:58:32,670
meet at that same level so it 
sagittarian has a higher risk of being.

3604
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:38,000
If we believe in this correlation data,
you know you can't assume correlations 

3605
02:58:38,851 --> 02:58:40,710
or causation.
I mean that's basic and I,

3606
02:58:40,910 --> 02:58:45,910
and it doesn't again,
there extent you can use bradford hill 

3607
02:58:45,910 --> 02:58:46,200
and other things to strengthen the 
association,

3608
02:58:46,201 --> 02:58:51,201
but you need to test it with an 
experiment or the association needs to 

3609
02:58:51,201 --> 02:58:53,820
be strong.
It needs to be over 100 percent at least

3610
02:58:53,850 --> 02:58:57,750
to really rise out of the noise and then
say,

3611
02:58:57,751 --> 02:58:59,160
okay,
we're really seeing a signal.

3612
02:58:59,460 --> 02:59:04,460
Let me give you another example.
There was a recent study just published 

3613
02:59:04,460 --> 02:59:07,050
that showed that women pregnant women 
with the highest maternal consumption of

3614
02:59:07,051 --> 02:59:12,051
gluten had a twofold risk of type one 
diabetes and their offspring and their 

3615
02:59:13,320 --> 02:59:14,610
children.
That was a double,

3616
02:59:15,090 --> 02:59:20,090
that was over a hundred percent.
So that is actuallY worth paying 

3617
02:59:20,090 --> 02:59:23,211
attention to because that's so such a 
large increase in risk that it doesn't 

3618
02:59:24,721 --> 02:59:27,300
confirm it by any stretch.
But it does mean.

3619
02:59:27,810 --> 02:59:29,820
Yeah,
maybe we should look into this further.

3620
02:59:29,821 --> 02:59:31,920
If that was a five percent increased 
risk,

3621
02:59:32,580 --> 02:59:33,350
I mean,
you,

3622
02:59:33,351 --> 02:59:33,900
you,
you,

3623
02:59:33,960 --> 02:59:37,680
you might as well say that sagittarians 
have a higher risk of fracture.

3624
02:59:37,710 --> 02:59:42,710
Is it fair to say that we're doing all 
these nutritional studies that you're 

3625
02:59:42,710 --> 02:59:44,700
looking at a poverty of data?
Yeah,

3626
02:59:44,790 --> 02:59:47,430
I'm johnny.
Johnny enedis had a quote.

3627
02:59:47,660 --> 02:59:50,580
Uh,
let's see if I can quickly find it.

3628
02:59:51,210 --> 02:59:56,210
Um,
because we're comparing all these 

3629
02:59:56,210 --> 02:59:58,320
different studies and mean obviously 
joel thinks one thing.

3630
02:59:58,320 --> 02:59:59,640
You think another thing.
So,

3631
02:59:59,670 --> 03:00:01,740
so here's the,
here's the end of this quote.

3632
03:00:01,770 --> 03:00:06,770
Moreover,
given the complicated associations of 

3633
03:00:06,770 --> 03:00:07,090
eating behaviors and patterns,
uh,

3634
03:00:07,550 --> 03:00:08,400
oops,
lost my place.

3635
03:00:08,401 --> 03:00:13,401
Given the complicated associations of 
eating behaviors and patterns with many 

3636
03:00:13,401 --> 03:00:16,410
time varying social and behavioral 
factors that also affect health.

3637
03:00:16,920 --> 03:00:21,920
No,
currently available cohort includes 

3638
03:00:21,920 --> 03:00:24,000
sufficient information to address 
confounding in nutritional association.

3639
03:00:24,001 --> 03:00:25,560
So he's saying,
you know,

3640
03:00:25,620 --> 03:00:30,620
lay-person translation,
there's so many factors that affect our 

3641
03:00:30,620 --> 03:00:32,130
health from our sleep to our physical 
activity to our,

3642
03:00:32,690 --> 03:00:34,320
uh,
whether we smoke,

3643
03:00:34,350 --> 03:00:37,080
whether we drink your,
our social relationships.

3644
03:00:37,081 --> 03:00:39,180
There was a study that I think I talked 
about,

3645
03:00:39,181 --> 03:00:40,830
um,
one of my previous appearances that,

3646
03:00:40,860 --> 03:00:45,860
that shows that I'm having not having 
enough good relationships will increase 

3647
03:00:46,201 --> 03:00:48,990
your risk of death more than smoking 15 
cigarettes a day,

3648
03:00:49,350 --> 03:00:54,350
no studies or controlling for that gut 
microbiome we now know is really 

3649
03:00:54,511 --> 03:00:57,870
important for our overall health.
Are any sTudies comparing for pe?

3650
03:00:57,910 --> 03:01:02,910
You know,
actually controlling for people's state 

3651
03:01:02,910 --> 03:01:02,910
of people's got microbiome?
Absolutely not.

3652
03:01:02,910 --> 03:01:04,750
Which is a problem with the tmao 
research.

3653
03:01:05,140 --> 03:01:10,140
So again,
it doesn't mean that observational 

3654
03:01:10,140 --> 03:01:13,021
studies are not useful.
It means we have to take them with a 

3655
03:01:13,021 --> 03:01:15,601
huge grain of salt and the fewer things 
that are actually controlled for the 

3656
03:01:15,671 --> 03:01:20,020
bigger,
the grain of salt will be joe w.

3657
03:01:20,140 --> 03:01:25,140
I eman,
I kind of had a sense that it's so 

3658
03:01:25,140 --> 03:01:27,451
overwhelming and there's so many spots 
in the data that we're unable to advise 

3659
03:01:27,581 --> 03:01:28,420
the public.
Again,

3660
03:01:28,421 --> 03:01:31,210
I don't agree with that.
I Think we have more than enough data.

3661
03:01:31,420 --> 03:01:33,850
you can go to michael polan,
eat food,

3662
03:01:33,851 --> 03:01:35,440
not too much.
Mostly plants.

3663
03:01:35,441 --> 03:01:38,980
Everybody loves it because it's 
consistent with the overwhelming 50,000

3664
03:01:38,981 --> 03:01:39,490
level.
Look,

3665
03:01:39,700 --> 03:01:42,160
you can go to the true health initiative
that says 15,000

3666
03:01:42,161 --> 03:01:43,040
level look.
Yeah,

3667
03:01:43,130 --> 03:01:45,790
no.
The whole level of biology,

3668
03:01:45,820 --> 03:01:48,130
basic science,
centenarian,

3669
03:01:48,820 --> 03:01:50,890
randomized clinical trials,
epidemiology.

3670
03:01:51,130 --> 03:01:53,320
You got to talk to a patient monday 
morning.

3671
03:01:53,500 --> 03:01:58,500
I don't want to get mired in confusion.
I'm going to tell that patient eat real 

3672
03:01:58,500 --> 03:02:00,760
food.
Don't eat too much and eat mostly plants

3673
03:02:00,761 --> 03:02:04,540
because that is a synthesis of 50 years 
in nutritional research.

3674
03:02:04,600 --> 03:02:07,300
are we going to evolve that to something
more brilliant?

3675
03:02:07,420 --> 03:02:12,420
You might add now fast five days a month
or don't eat 12 hours a day.

3676
03:02:12,790 --> 03:02:17,790
We might be able to refine it with some 
of the new science on it using fasting 

3677
03:02:17,790 --> 03:02:18,880
intelligently,
but that's pretty strong.

3678
03:02:19,030 --> 03:02:22,270
When I go to the true health initiative 
and say it's all confusing,

3679
03:02:22,370 --> 03:02:24,970
but 400 scientific international experts
say,

3680
03:02:25,180 --> 03:02:30,180
eat locally,
source close to the ground per plant 

3681
03:02:30,180 --> 03:02:33,301
predominant with water.
400 scientists say that's pretty 

3682
03:02:33,301 --> 03:02:36,901
reasonable,
that I can tell my patient on monday is 

3683
03:02:36,901 --> 03:02:39,811
something they can actually activate and
we'll figure out tmao with a blocker 

3684
03:02:39,811 --> 03:02:44,280
with fish or with eggs with coleen or 
whether this tick allergy ends up 

3685
03:02:44,280 --> 03:02:47,080
spreading into Michigan or California.
And There's a way to deal with it.

3686
03:02:47,250 --> 03:02:52,250
For now.
These are critically simple lessons for 

3687
03:02:52,250 --> 03:02:52,250
the public.

3688
03:02:52,250 --> 03:02:53,570
I'd actually agree with that.
Including the part about plants.

3689
03:02:53,571 --> 03:02:58,571
I mean,
I recommend my recommendation is your 

3690
03:02:58,571 --> 03:02:58,571
plate should be,
you know,

3691
03:02:58,571 --> 03:03:00,130
two thirds or three quarters plants and,
and then,

3692
03:03:00,230 --> 03:03:03,260
and then animal products,
animal foods.

3693
03:03:03,261 --> 03:03:08,261
So the question here is not that,
should we eat a healthy whole foods 

3694
03:03:08,631 --> 03:03:10,670
diet?
We both agree on that 100 percent.

3695
03:03:10,700 --> 03:03:13,720
The question is whether animal foods,
uh,

3696
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:17,420
should be a part of the diet based on 
their nutrient density,

3697
03:03:17,421 --> 03:03:19,850
which unfortunately we haven't had a 
chance to get into yet.

3698
03:03:19,851 --> 03:03:24,851
And their bioavailability and the fact 
that humans in our hominid ancestors 

3699
03:03:24,851 --> 03:03:26,900
have been consuming them for over two 
and a half million years.

3700
03:03:27,350 --> 03:03:28,340
Um,
you know,

3701
03:03:28,610 --> 03:03:31,160
that's my argument is that,
uh,

3702
03:03:31,540 --> 03:03:33,380
on that plate,
for most people,

3703
03:03:33,381 --> 03:03:35,420
they're going to benefit from having 
some animal foods.

3704
03:03:35,421 --> 03:03:36,800
How much,
you know,

3705
03:03:36,801 --> 03:03:38,930
what proportions of carbohydrate,
fat,

3706
03:03:39,380 --> 03:03:40,490
protein,
and all of that.

3707
03:03:40,490 --> 03:03:45,490
That depends on the person and you're 
going to see big differences actually 

3708
03:03:45,490 --> 03:03:45,490
from person to person.
Um,

3709
03:03:45,500 --> 03:03:48,040
but you know,
I,

3710
03:03:48,680 --> 03:03:53,680
I think today has made it clear there's 
no convincing data that shows that 

3711
03:03:54,140 --> 03:03:59,140
completely removing animal products from
that plate going to lead to a longer 

3712
03:03:59,140 --> 03:04:03,080
life span or significant reductions in 
disease.

3713
03:04:03,260 --> 03:04:08,260
Let me put it this way.
What is the benefit of putting that one 

3714
03:04:08,260 --> 03:04:11,240
quarter of your plate putting animal 
protein?

3715
03:04:11,810 --> 03:04:16,810
Like what,
what Is the nutrient density of it that 

3716
03:04:16,810 --> 03:04:16,970
makes lots of benefits?
Yeah.

3717
03:04:16,971 --> 03:04:17,810
So,
uh,

3718
03:04:17,990 --> 03:04:19,970
animal protein is,
um,

3719
03:04:20,150 --> 03:04:23,480
more nutrient dense in essential 
nutrients.

3720
03:04:23,970 --> 03:04:26,650
So,
so making it clear that I,

3721
03:04:26,660 --> 03:04:31,660
I,
I support eating both plants and animal 

3722
03:04:31,660 --> 03:04:34,871
foods.
So animals or animal foods are higher 

3723
03:04:34,871 --> 03:04:35,840
and be 12 bioavailable zinc,
iron,

3724
03:04:36,290 --> 03:04:40,040
calcium,
a coleen taurine,

3725
03:04:40,310 --> 03:04:45,310
creatine,
and not just higher in terms of the 

3726
03:04:45,310 --> 03:04:46,400
actual amounts but higher in the amount 
that you,

3727
03:04:46,460 --> 03:04:47,660
that you absorb.

3728
03:04:47,660 --> 03:04:51,800
And that's a very key point.
whereas plant foods tend to be higher in

3729
03:04:52,280 --> 03:04:55,810
carotinoids polyphenols,
flavanoids,

3730
03:04:56,050 --> 03:04:58,520
diallo,
little sulfides which are in cruciferous

3731
03:04:58,521 --> 03:05:02,210
vegetables and fiber and those are 
important as well.

3732
03:05:02,211 --> 03:05:04,010
And so to get the best of,
you know,

3733
03:05:04,020 --> 03:05:04,600
the,
the,

3734
03:05:04,940 --> 03:05:09,940
the widest spectrum of nutrient density,
we want to eat the animals for those 

3735
03:05:09,940 --> 03:05:12,680
nutrients in animal foods and then the 
plant foods for those other nutrients.

3736
03:05:13,940 --> 03:05:18,940
And whaT would be negative about 
removing the animal products from that 

3737
03:05:20,211 --> 03:05:21,860
one quarter of your plate?
What,

3738
03:05:21,861 --> 03:05:26,260
what could you not fill in with plant 
protein a,

3739
03:05:26,350 --> 03:05:31,350
b?
Clearly some people get by with just 

3740
03:05:31,350 --> 03:05:31,350
plant protein b.
12 is the,

3741
03:05:31,350 --> 03:05:32,990
is the biggest issue for sure.
Um,

3742
03:05:32,991 --> 03:05:37,991
it's not really found in plant foods 
except for some exotic species of wild 

3743
03:05:38,211 --> 03:05:41,930
mushrooms and,
and nori and plants and mushrooms aren't

3744
03:05:41,931 --> 03:05:43,820
really plants.
Right?

3745
03:05:44,360 --> 03:05:46,720
But yeah,
in non animal foods,

3746
03:05:46,721 --> 03:05:47,810
yeah,
I guess you could say,

3747
03:05:47,950 --> 03:05:52,950
um,
but if it's not just a question of 

3748
03:05:52,950 --> 03:05:56,530
what's theoretically possible,
it's a question of looking at the 

3749
03:05:56,530 --> 03:05:58,130
studies that show us what are the 
average,

3750
03:05:58,300 --> 03:05:59,600
uh,
you know,

3751
03:06:00,020 --> 03:06:05,020
how common are nutrient deficiencies on 
omnivorous versus vegetarian and vegan 

3752
03:06:05,210 --> 03:06:05,720
diets.

3753
03:06:05,720 --> 03:06:08,060
And if you go to [inaudible] dot com 
slash rogan,

3754
03:06:08,390 --> 03:06:13,390
there's a whole section on that that 
links to a very in depth article that 

3755
03:06:13,390 --> 03:06:13,850
shows that,
for example,

3756
03:06:13,940 --> 03:06:17,750
of vegetarians and vegans,
the average omnivore,

3757
03:06:17,930 --> 03:06:20,480
the rate of between depletion is 11 
percent.

3758
03:06:20,570 --> 03:06:24,800
And then for vegetarians at 77 Percent 
and for vegans it's 92 percent,

3759
03:06:24,830 --> 03:06:28,220
92 percent of depletion,
which is the first stage.

3760
03:06:28,221 --> 03:06:30,410
There's four stages of b,
12 deficiency.

3761
03:06:30,411 --> 03:06:34,730
And that's the first stage.
And the earlier studies that showed less

3762
03:06:34,731 --> 03:06:37,850
of a difference used only crm b12 as a 
marker,

3763
03:06:37,880 --> 03:06:42,290
but it turns out that crmb 12 is not a 
very accurate marker of b 12 deficiency.

3764
03:06:42,620 --> 03:06:45,050
And we need to be using more accurate 
markers like holo,

3765
03:06:45,051 --> 03:06:47,720
transcobalamin,
methylmalonic acid,

3766
03:06:47,850 --> 03:06:51,080
homocysteine.
And when you use those newer markers,

3767
03:06:51,380 --> 03:06:53,540
you see those broad,
broad,

3768
03:06:53,570 --> 03:06:55,280
you know,
very big differences,

3769
03:06:55,470 --> 03:07:00,470
deficiency rates and furthermore there 
was a study done in vegans and 

3770
03:07:00,470 --> 03:07:03,360
vegetarians in the Netherlands that were
at a summer camp.

3771
03:07:03,360 --> 03:07:06,750
So these were people who were educated 
vegetarians and vegans,

3772
03:07:06,751 --> 03:07:11,751
they were really into it and the average
crmb 12 level for them even it was below

3773
03:07:13,111 --> 03:07:15,450
200,
which is in a deficiency state.

3774
03:07:15,840 --> 03:07:20,840
And even the people who were 
supplementing had significant levels of 

3775
03:07:20,850 --> 03:07:24,990
b 12 deficiency.
And that's probably because studies have

3776
03:07:24,991 --> 03:07:29,991
shown that the amount that you need to 
supplement with is about a 100 times 

3777
03:07:29,991 --> 03:07:32,700
higher than the rda.
So the rda is two point five micro grams

3778
03:07:33,180 --> 03:07:37,020
and you really need 250 micrograms to 
get your levels up.

3779
03:07:37,021 --> 03:07:40,620
And if you're deficient you need 200 
times more than the rda,

3780
03:07:40,650 --> 03:07:44,670
500 micrograms and this.
All the studies are there on,

3781
03:07:44,671 --> 03:07:49,671
on my site.
So it is the problem that beat twelves 

3782
03:07:49,671 --> 03:07:50,580
nonexistent and plant based foods or 
that it's not as bioavailable.

3783
03:07:50,660 --> 03:07:52,020
It's,
it doesn't exist.

3784
03:07:52,021 --> 03:07:57,021
The true,
true cobalamin absorbable b12 doesn't 

3785
03:07:57,021 --> 03:07:57,880
exist in implant that you can't,
um,

3786
03:07:58,340 --> 03:08:03,340
you can get other koba minds,
other forms of implant,

3787
03:08:03,630 --> 03:08:05,370
even algae,
even algae.

3788
03:08:05,371 --> 03:08:05,850
Yeah.
Most,

3789
03:08:06,060 --> 03:08:11,060
most vegans who are well who were 
educated about this know this and they 

3790
03:08:11,060 --> 03:08:11,730
take a 12 suPplement.
So,

3791
03:08:11,790 --> 03:08:14,710
but the [inaudible] supplement is 
probably based on what,

3792
03:08:14,970 --> 03:08:16,950
like what is it coming from?
Well,

3793
03:08:17,190 --> 03:08:17,920
it's not that,
that,

3794
03:08:18,170 --> 03:08:19,890
that doesn't necessarily make the 
difference.

3795
03:08:19,900 --> 03:08:22,050
It's are they taking enough to meet your
needs?

3796
03:08:22,051 --> 03:08:27,051
So I hope that anyone who is listening 
to this make sure that they're getting 

3797
03:08:27,051 --> 03:08:27,051
enough b,
12,

3798
03:08:27,051 --> 03:08:27,350
you know.
RIght.

3799
03:08:27,360 --> 03:08:29,400
But what is it coming from?
If it's not active?

3800
03:08:29,730 --> 03:08:33,330
I make be 12 cows are eating dirty 
ground.

3801
03:08:33,331 --> 03:08:38,331
they get bacteria,
cows stored in their stomach plants if 

3802
03:08:38,331 --> 03:08:41,211
you don't wash will give you be 12.
But it's the bacteria hanging on the 

3803
03:08:41,211 --> 03:08:41,211
carrot

3804
03:08:41,211 --> 03:08:44,860
and we make the 12 too,
but It's in the colon and we can absorb 

3805
03:08:44,860 --> 03:08:44,860
it in the small intestine.
Right.

3806
03:08:44,860 --> 03:08:45,860
So,
um,

3807
03:08:46,220 --> 03:08:51,220
but yeah,
just making sure that if someone is 

3808
03:08:51,220 --> 03:08:53,051
following this diet,
they're getting enough b 12 and that 

3809
03:08:53,051 --> 03:08:53,051
they're using the right markers to 
assess their status.

3810
03:08:53,051 --> 03:08:57,911
Crmb 12 only goes out of range In the 
final stages of b 12 deficiency and by 

3811
03:08:57,911 --> 03:09:02,861
then it can be too late some of the 
effects of b 12 deficiency or 

3812
03:09:02,861 --> 03:09:05,150
irreversible.
So it's a pretty serious thing and it's,

3813
03:09:05,210 --> 03:09:08,900
it's a really important thing for any 
vegetarian or vegan to be aware of,

3814
03:09:08,901 --> 03:09:11,570
given those big differences in 
depletion,

3815
03:09:11,950 --> 03:09:13,850
uh,
between the population.

3816
03:09:13,860 --> 03:09:18,860
So joel,
if you been a vegan since you've been 

3817
03:09:18,860 --> 03:09:18,860
18,
obviously must've been on top of all the

3818
03:09:18,860 --> 03:09:21,560
supplementation and making sure that you
get your nutrients

3819
03:09:21,940 --> 03:09:22,810
well,
it's out.

3820
03:09:23,020 --> 03:09:28,020
Number one,
it's responsible for a healthcare 

3821
03:09:28,020 --> 03:09:30,370
practitioner to advise somebody eating 
plant based to take vitamin b.

3822
03:09:30,371 --> 03:09:31,150
12.
Absolutely.

3823
03:09:31,270 --> 03:09:35,350
There are people that do it because it's
fortified in many foods and nori,

3824
03:09:35,351 --> 03:09:40,351
if you eat sushi and nutritional yeast,
I don't advise my patients to rely on 

3825
03:09:40,351 --> 03:09:43,690
food because there's a neurologic and 
hematologic potential for trouble.

3826
03:09:43,780 --> 03:09:48,780
If you don't be 12,
it actually takes years to deplete your 

3827
03:09:48,780 --> 03:09:49,090
b 12.
It's an interesting statistic.

3828
03:09:49,091 --> 03:09:51,430
I want to come back to humans.
Ninety percent of all b,

3829
03:09:51,431 --> 03:09:55,510
12 right now is being given to lock cows
because they don't eat dirt anymore.

3830
03:09:55,511 --> 03:09:57,340
They're inside a building that has no 
dirt.

3831
03:09:57,460 --> 03:10:00,550
They dOn't get be 12,
but the public wants be 12 rich meat,

3832
03:10:00,700 --> 03:10:02,990
so they'd give be 12 to cows to make b 
12.

3833
03:10:03,020 --> 03:10:05,620
There is little vegans.
These cows,

3834
03:10:05,621 --> 03:10:08,030
they don't have a source anymore.
No animal.

3835
03:10:08,031 --> 03:10:09,900
They usually talking about factory 
farming,

3836
03:10:09,901 --> 03:10:12,220
factory farming.
You know if you're out there eating dirt

3837
03:10:12,221 --> 03:10:13,940
in the field are going to have a 
college,

3838
03:10:13,960 --> 03:10:14,440
have a job,

3839
03:10:15,350 --> 03:10:16,970
be right here.
When you say that,

3840
03:10:17,150 --> 03:10:22,150
so is it impossible to live a healthy 
plant based lifestyle without 

3841
03:10:23,631 --> 03:10:24,500
supplementation?

3842
03:10:24,540 --> 03:10:25,770
No.
Many many people do,

3843
03:10:25,800 --> 03:10:27,830
but if you're saying you don't remember 
amended,

3844
03:10:27,870 --> 03:10:29,760
I don't recommend it,
but they should get bloodwork.

3845
03:10:29,780 --> 03:10:30,870
Know your vitamin d,
no,

3846
03:10:30,871 --> 03:10:35,871
your omega three and know your b 12.
I'm all for optimal health and I'm 

3847
03:10:35,871 --> 03:10:39,681
practicing high level medicine,
but I have friends that adamantly show 

3848
03:10:39,681 --> 03:10:43,731
me their blood work.
I don't take pills and look at my blood 

3849
03:10:43,731 --> 03:10:43,731
work.
I mean they may sneak by.

3850
03:10:43,731 --> 03:10:46,540
It's not my medical recommendation.
The fish and recommendations is every,

3851
03:10:46,770 --> 03:10:51,770
everybody over age 50 and the United 
States take be 12 for brain and mental 

3852
03:10:51,770 --> 03:10:55,911
health,
whatever your diet and that's a wise 

3853
03:10:55,911 --> 03:10:59,091
advice.
Whether you take a multivitamin every 

3854
03:10:59,091 --> 03:10:59,091
couple of days like dr longo recommends 
there's,

3855
03:10:59,091 --> 03:11:00,990
you know,
this is a real problem.

3856
03:11:01,050 --> 03:11:03,030
Nobody's denying that chris has laid it 
out.

3857
03:11:03,031 --> 03:11:05,370
Well,
it's such a simple solution.

3858
03:11:05,400 --> 03:11:09,710
I'm going to demonstrate my be 12.
What's the source of your [inaudible]?

3859
03:11:09,800 --> 03:11:14,070
It's synthesize methological bombing.
I just got 1000 micrograms of vitamin b,

3860
03:11:14,071 --> 03:11:19,071
12 with 400 micro with 400 milligrams of
dha with 2000 international units of 

3861
03:11:19,531 --> 03:11:24,420
vitamin d three and I did vegan.
I just did that once a day and I'm done.

3862
03:11:24,421 --> 03:11:26,400
You know,
and it's all vegan and has nothing to do

3863
03:11:26,401 --> 03:11:29,560
with living organisms.
It's made synthesized a,

3864
03:11:29,650 --> 03:11:31,680
b.
Twelve is synthesizing labs.

3865
03:11:31,681 --> 03:11:36,681
MethylcobAlamin,
some people believe is the preferred 

3866
03:11:36,681 --> 03:11:37,290
choice,
which I think chris would agree with.

3867
03:11:37,530 --> 03:11:42,530
Contrary to popular belief,
it can be gotten by completely humane 

3868
03:11:42,530 --> 03:11:43,630
and ethical ways.
If you're a,

3869
03:11:43,840 --> 03:11:44,880
oh,
it's lpg,

3870
03:11:44,930 --> 03:11:49,930
it's lg for dha,
it's synthesize for be tWelve and 

3871
03:11:49,930 --> 03:11:51,580
vitamin d three is synthesized to it 
used to be made from cows,

3872
03:11:51,640 --> 03:11:53,840
a secretion called land,
a sheep's secretion

3873
03:11:53,840 --> 03:11:58,840
called land limpets synthesize now,
but it does beg the question of whether 

3874
03:11:58,840 --> 03:12:03,310
we should be following a diet that can't
meet our essential nutrient needs and 

3875
03:12:03,310 --> 03:12:07,331
that leads to deficiencies of many other
nutrients much more commonly than an 

3876
03:12:07,331 --> 03:12:09,950
omnivorous diet.
And you know,

3877
03:12:09,980 --> 03:12:14,980
my,
my position has always been we should 

3878
03:12:14,980 --> 03:12:17,171
get as many nutrients as food as we as 
we can because that's the way that 

3879
03:12:17,171 --> 03:12:18,020
humans are adapted to getting new 
nutrients.

3880
03:12:18,480 --> 03:12:21,110
There's issues with supplementation 
sometimes.

3881
03:12:21,111 --> 03:12:22,490
Um,
you know,

3882
03:12:22,580 --> 03:12:26,000
both like getting too much of a nutrient
is,

3883
03:12:26,030 --> 03:12:29,060
can be a problem in several cases.
That's not the case in b12,

3884
03:12:29,090 --> 03:12:34,090
which is great because it means people 
can take really high doses and it won't 

3885
03:12:34,090 --> 03:12:34,610
be a problem.
But as I mentioned,

3886
03:12:34,611 --> 03:12:39,611
a lot of vegetarians and vegans who are 
supplementing are still at risk and 

3887
03:12:39,611 --> 03:12:44,101
still deficient because crmb b 12 is the
main marker that is used in this 

3888
03:12:44,271 --> 03:12:45,470
country.
And not even,

3889
03:12:45,500 --> 03:12:47,840
most physicians don't test for cmv 
tWelve.

3890
03:12:47,841 --> 03:12:49,340
I know this,
you probably know this,

3891
03:12:49,341 --> 03:12:51,920
joel from people come in,
they've never had be 12 tests,

3892
03:12:52,250 --> 03:12:54,260
but then when they do get the cnb 12 
tests,

3893
03:12:54,261 --> 03:12:57,630
it's going to miss a large percentage of
people who are already in the stage two.

3894
03:12:57,640 --> 03:12:59,800
I do a methylmalonic methylmalonic.
Yeah.

3895
03:12:59,810 --> 03:13:04,810
So methylmalonic acid and homocysteine 
are much more important markers and I 

3896
03:13:05,771 --> 03:13:10,771
agree.
If you look at average homocysteine 

3897
03:13:10,771 --> 03:13:13,391
levels in vegans and vegetarians are 
significantly higher than in omnivores 

3898
03:13:14,790 --> 03:13:18,140
because of this issue,
because of the high prevalence of,

3899
03:13:18,590 --> 03:13:22,250
of b12 deficiency.
And what's ironic about that is a lot of

3900
03:13:22,251 --> 03:13:27,251
people turn to a plant based,
I don't even want to say plant based 

3901
03:13:27,251 --> 03:13:29,280
because I would consider a neutral or a 
paleo diet to be plant based to but uh,

3902
03:13:29,510 --> 03:13:33,080
no animal product diet to improve their 
cardiovascular health.

3903
03:13:33,110 --> 03:13:37,870
And yet you're seeing much higher rates.
Your rates of homocysteine,

3904
03:13:37,871 --> 03:13:42,871
like the average and vegans is 16,
which is a rate that's clearly 

3905
03:13:42,871 --> 03:13:44,120
associated with increased risk of not 
only cardiovascular disease,

3906
03:13:44,121 --> 03:13:46,220
but also dementia and alzheimer's.
RighT.

3907
03:13:46,390 --> 03:13:47,260
Chris?
I couldn't agree more.

3908
03:13:47,261 --> 03:13:52,261
I've written many articles,
don't be a dumb vegan and I don't mean 

3909
03:13:52,261 --> 03:13:52,570
to offend,
but you know what you know you,

3910
03:13:52,630 --> 03:13:57,630
you,
we are prone and I mean there's no 

3911
03:13:57,630 --> 03:13:57,630
bullshit here.
This is too important for people.

3912
03:13:57,630 --> 03:14:01,800
We are prone to have a few holes in the 
wall that an intelligent person knows 

3913
03:14:01,800 --> 03:14:04,180
how to plug it.
Vitamin d,

3914
03:14:04,210 --> 03:14:06,730
it's dha,
it's be 12.

3915
03:14:06,760 --> 03:14:09,490
You might go onto say iodine touring 
vanadium,

3916
03:14:09,491 --> 03:14:11,440
chromium.
I just got those.

3917
03:14:11,441 --> 03:14:14,170
That's what I do every other day.
I'm totally complete.

3918
03:14:14,200 --> 03:14:18,430
My patients are totally complete.
The industry has provided solutions to a

3919
03:14:18,460 --> 03:14:20,250
relatively simple problem.
I don't.

3920
03:14:20,540 --> 03:14:21,550
So you got a mouthful.

3921
03:14:22,570 --> 03:14:23,470
Let me ask you questions.
Is,

3922
03:14:23,530 --> 03:14:28,530
is it fair to say that you believe that 
What the vegan diet is like?

3923
03:14:28,630 --> 03:14:32,710
You can essentially hack your way to a 
better,

3924
03:14:32,711 --> 03:14:36,610
healthier life by just adding a few 
things like be 12,

3925
03:14:36,611 --> 03:14:39,400
a few other nutrients that you're not 
going to get from the diet,

3926
03:14:39,401 --> 03:14:43,030
but with those together you feel like 
you're far healthier.

3927
03:14:43,080 --> 03:14:45,050
Well,
because what I didn't get,

3928
03:14:45,051 --> 03:14:46,920
I substituted,
but what I don't want,

3929
03:14:46,921 --> 03:14:51,921
I'm not taking in,
which is animal saturated fat animal 

3930
03:14:51,921 --> 03:14:51,921
protein.
I'm not taking

3931
03:14:51,921 --> 03:14:56,160
main disagreement here between the two 
of you is whether or not saturated fat.

3932
03:14:56,340 --> 03:14:59,190
Chris and I would both agree as 
educators,

3933
03:14:59,400 --> 03:15:04,400
all the public and specifically plant 
eaters should be aware of nutritional 

3934
03:15:04,400 --> 03:15:07,821
deficiencies.
A two year paleo followup study said 

3935
03:15:07,821 --> 03:15:08,280
that people were deficient in iodine on 
the paleo diet.

3936
03:15:08,470 --> 03:15:13,280
Sounds have much higher rates of iodine,
but you know it's common in America.

3937
03:15:13,281 --> 03:15:13,600
MucH higher

3938
03:15:13,790 --> 03:15:15,660
rates of iodine deficiency than paleo

3939
03:15:15,820 --> 03:15:17,680
unless you eat some nori,
some kelp,

3940
03:15:18,160 --> 03:15:20,170
unless use iodized salt.
If you would just put

3941
03:15:20,690 --> 03:15:24,140
though that the paleo diet is the issue,

3942
03:15:24,530 --> 03:15:29,530
just people deficiency.
Paleo diet goes back 10 to 12 years in 

3943
03:15:29,530 --> 03:15:34,480
literature.
Two thousand nine is about the first 

3944
03:15:34,480 --> 03:15:36,421
good paleo.
Sansa showed up and I honor the paleo 

3945
03:15:36,421 --> 03:15:36,421
diet.
There is good reason to consider it as a

3946
03:15:36,421 --> 03:15:41,161
food option.
They'll us news and world report does 

3947
03:15:41,161 --> 03:15:41,161
not agree with that,
but to say,

3948
03:15:41,161 --> 03:15:43,270
what are they basing it on?
They're not scientists.

3949
03:15:43,570 --> 03:15:47,020
Well,
their panel of scientists that they read

3950
03:15:47,021 --> 03:15:48,210
it,
they read it for lunch.

3951
03:15:48,260 --> 03:15:50,100
The bigger question is just what?

3952
03:15:50,130 --> 03:15:55,130
You know what's going to happen for the 
average person who's following these 

3953
03:15:55,130 --> 03:15:57,080
diets and I agree 100 percent with joel 
that you know,

3954
03:15:57,081 --> 03:16:00,030
we have to educate people on whatever 
diet they're on and I've,

3955
03:16:00,170 --> 03:16:01,860
I've,
I've said this to people,

3956
03:16:01,920 --> 03:16:05,440
that's why I'm not,
I've never advocated strict paleo be.

3957
03:16:05,820 --> 03:16:07,740
I mean I think that can work for some 
people,

3958
03:16:07,741 --> 03:16:12,741
but I've never been an ideological about
that because I actually think that full 

3959
03:16:12,741 --> 03:16:17,301
fat fermented dairy is really beneficial
when it's well tolerated and one of the 

3960
03:16:17,301 --> 03:16:21,531
reasons for it is iodine dairy is 
actually one of the best sources of 

3961
03:16:21,531 --> 03:16:25,431
iodine in the diet and it's not because 
the dairy products contain iodine but 

3962
03:16:25,431 --> 03:16:29,051
they're stored in tanks that were iota 
for is the cleanser that's used for the 

3963
03:16:29,071 --> 03:16:31,360
tanks.
We basically pure just pure it.

3964
03:16:31,370 --> 03:16:35,280
Interesting and,
and gross.

3965
03:16:35,700 --> 03:16:36,660
It's not,
it's just,

3966
03:16:36,670 --> 03:16:37,350
it's like,
you know,

3967
03:16:37,351 --> 03:16:39,240
the iodine you use to clean.

3968
03:16:39,270 --> 03:16:44,270
It's just a natural nutrient.
Where do you get it from food though 

3969
03:16:44,270 --> 03:16:46,620
outside?
So the three top sources of iodine would

3970
03:16:46,621 --> 03:16:49,410
be.
Well iodized salt is the main one.

3971
03:16:49,411 --> 03:16:51,690
That's why it was added to salt in the 
first place,

3972
03:16:51,691 --> 03:16:56,691
but a lot of people on a healthy diet 
remove iodized salt in favor of sea 

3973
03:16:56,691 --> 03:16:57,900
salt,
which I think is a good choice overall,

3974
03:16:57,930 --> 03:17:02,930
but one of the downsides of that is that
there are no longer consuming the main 

3975
03:17:02,930 --> 03:17:06,351
source of iodine.
Then dairy products and then sea 

3976
03:17:06,351 --> 03:17:06,351
vegetables,
as joel mentioned,

3977
03:17:06,351 --> 03:17:09,240
I'm like kelp and he jiechi and rma and,
and no worry,

3978
03:17:09,241 --> 03:17:14,241
not as much,
which is the only sea vegetable that 

3979
03:17:14,241 --> 03:17:14,241
most americans consume in the form of 
sushi.

3980
03:17:14,241 --> 03:17:15,360
Right?
Um,

3981
03:17:15,480 --> 03:17:19,020
so if you take someone on a,
on a vegan diet or a paleo diet for that

3982
03:17:19,021 --> 03:17:21,830
matter,
and they remove dairy seat,

3983
03:17:21,910 --> 03:17:24,690
a iodized salt and they're not eating 
sea vegetables,

3984
03:17:24,691 --> 03:17:26,940
then yes,
that is a risk for iodine deficiency.

3985
03:17:26,940 --> 03:17:30,180
I have written about that,
but let's look at things like calcium.

3986
03:17:30,210 --> 03:17:32,190
Let's look at iron.
Let's look at zinc.

3987
03:17:32,250 --> 03:17:34,830
Let's look at coleen.
Let's look at taurine.

3988
03:17:34,831 --> 03:17:36,930
Let's look at creotine.
Let's look at retina,

3989
03:17:36,931 --> 03:17:40,170
which is preformed vitamin a.
And let's look at epa and dha.

3990
03:17:40,740 --> 03:17:45,740
All of these are shown to be lower in 
vegetarians and vegans and they are in 

3991
03:17:45,740 --> 03:17:47,820
omnivores and it Just,
yes,

3992
03:17:47,821 --> 03:17:49,260
you can supplement,
but it just,

3993
03:17:49,350 --> 03:17:54,350
you know,
are the supplements have the same 

3994
03:17:54,350 --> 03:17:54,350
effect,
like look at calcium.

3995
03:17:54,350 --> 03:17:58,760
dietary calcium has inversely related to
heart disease and kidney stones,

3996
03:17:59,160 --> 03:18:01,800
meaning the more dietary calcium you 
eat,

3997
03:18:02,040 --> 03:18:07,040
the lower risk of those conditions.
But when you look at studies on calcium 

3998
03:18:07,040 --> 03:18:09,630
supplements,
the opposite is true calcium supplements

3999
03:18:09,631 --> 03:18:14,631
are associated with an increase in heart
disease and an increase in kidney 

4000
03:18:14,631 --> 03:18:17,160
stones.
So associated by epidemiology studies.

4001
03:18:17,700 --> 03:18:18,390
Yes,
yes.

4002
03:18:19,140 --> 03:18:24,140
So,
but the theory is that because you went 

4003
03:18:24,140 --> 03:18:27,290
with the supplemental,
calcium is not the same as dietary 

4004
03:18:27,290 --> 03:18:29,931
calcium.
You get a large bolus of calcium that 

4005
03:18:29,931 --> 03:18:32,271
goes into your blood all at once and 
then it can get into the soft tissues 

4006
03:18:32,271 --> 03:18:34,620
which you know,
can make them stiffer,

4007
03:18:34,650 --> 03:18:38,070
which is joel will tell you is not good 
for your heart health.

4008
03:18:38,071 --> 03:18:41,610
And so my point is that supplements 
don't always affect the body in the same

4009
03:18:41,611 --> 03:18:46,611
way.
That's why I just think it's better to 

4010
03:18:46,611 --> 03:18:49,281
get nutrients from food if you can,
because that's the way we've been 

4011
03:18:49,281 --> 03:18:49,281
getting them for

4012
03:18:49,281 --> 03:18:49,850
millions of years,
you know,

4013
03:18:49,900 --> 03:18:54,900
let's talk about something I think you 
guys can both agree on because I am 

4014
03:18:54,900 --> 03:18:57,380
baffled by this carnivore diet.
Yes.

4015
03:18:57,430 --> 03:19:02,430
And baffled.
I'm baffled by how many people are 

4016
03:19:02,430 --> 03:19:06,840
clinging to it as a panacea.
I'm baffled by whether or not it's a 

4017
03:19:06,840 --> 03:19:11,050
physiological effect or whether there's 
a placebo effect going on.

4018
03:19:11,080 --> 03:19:12,690
I have a theory please.
Yeah.

4019
03:19:13,120 --> 03:19:17,110
So my theory is that it mimics some of 
the benefits of fasting,

4020
03:19:18,820 --> 03:19:22,990
but allows people to persist for longer 
because it's providing some nutrition.

4021
03:19:23,110 --> 03:19:23,920
You know,
most,

4022
03:19:24,220 --> 03:19:25,750
if you look in the scientific 
literature,

4023
03:19:25,751 --> 03:19:28,930
fasting is the cure.
all for everything I agree with.

4024
03:19:28,931 --> 03:19:33,010
you mean like you can look at any 
condition and fasting is the cure time,

4025
03:19:33,011 --> 03:19:35,080
water fasting.
So you can do it for two,

4026
03:19:35,081 --> 03:19:35,830
three,
four weeks.

4027
03:19:36,240 --> 03:19:40,810
I tried that for a year and that will be
the cure for life in that case.

4028
03:19:42,190 --> 03:19:44,620
The longest example is a year of water 
fest.

4029
03:19:44,650 --> 03:19:46,530
So most people die.
That last,

4030
03:19:46,531 --> 03:19:46,960
uh,
it was,

4031
03:19:48,060 --> 03:19:51,490
he was extremely obese,
a lot of energy stores,

4032
03:19:52,300 --> 03:19:53,320
fat stores,
right.

4033
03:19:53,620 --> 03:19:56,530
Anything about that was he actually his 
skin shrank to.

4034
03:19:56,650 --> 03:19:57,750
Right.
Which is really,

4035
03:19:57,751 --> 03:19:59,410
yeah.
Which doesn't usually happen with weight

4036
03:19:59,411 --> 03:20:01,450
loss,
so this is just a theory.

4037
03:20:01,451 --> 03:20:02,660
I have nothing to,
you know,

4038
03:20:02,670 --> 03:20:07,670
I don't have any evidence,
but we meet as absorbed very high up in 

4039
03:20:07,670 --> 03:20:10,390
the digestive tract.
And so when you only eat meat,

4040
03:20:10,391 --> 03:20:15,391
it's a low residue diet and there's 
nothing leftover to irritate or inflame 

4041
03:20:15,391 --> 03:20:20,371
the gut.
My theory is a lot of people who are 

4042
03:20:20,371 --> 03:20:20,371
benefiting from this have a really 
disrupted gut microbiome.

4043
03:20:20,470 --> 03:20:25,470
Alessio fasano has argued that leaky gut
is kind of a preconditioned for auto 

4044
03:20:25,470 --> 03:20:28,120
immunity and this,
the carnivore diet is essentially like a

4045
03:20:28,121 --> 03:20:33,121
gut rest or a fast.
And so I don't know the out that people 

4046
03:20:33,461 --> 03:20:38,461
are benefiting from it.
The question is what is the longterm 

4047
03:20:38,461 --> 03:20:38,461
implication?
But there is no.

4048
03:20:38,461 --> 03:20:41,130
I mean there's a few people that have 
been doing this,

4049
03:20:41,170 --> 03:20:43,810
some anecdotal evidence.
We've been doing it for a few decades.

4050
03:20:43,880 --> 03:20:44,180
Well,
you know,

4051
03:20:44,181 --> 03:20:49,181
it's pretty cool.
I'm actually going on my homeboy sean 

4052
03:20:49,181 --> 03:20:49,550
baker's podcasts in a few weeks.
We're humble.

4053
03:20:49,690 --> 03:20:51,860
We started.
Sean and I started as enemies.

4054
03:20:51,861 --> 03:20:52,940
We love each other.
Shannon,

4055
03:20:52,941 --> 03:20:55,190
I love your brother.
We're going to have an honest discussion

4056
03:20:55,220 --> 03:21:00,220
as much as you can to say why has my 
Kayla Peterson feeling good and you got 

4057
03:21:00,331 --> 03:21:03,380
to love that and honor that.
If she had done water fasting,

4058
03:21:03,440 --> 03:21:06,440
transitioning to an ultra clean diet,
which you have done as well,

4059
03:21:06,650 --> 03:21:09,830
who knows,
but to look at sean baker's labs and say

4060
03:21:10,040 --> 03:21:14,450
prediabetic low testosterone high bun.
I'm concerned,

4061
03:21:14,451 --> 03:21:19,451
although he just published his coronary 
calcium scan to zero and I honor that 

4062
03:21:19,451 --> 03:21:20,480
he's got little kids.
I don't want the guy to drop dead,

4063
03:21:20,481 --> 03:21:25,481
but you know,
there's it's way preliminary for the 

4064
03:21:25,481 --> 03:21:28,361
bandwagon.
That's testosterone thing though is he 

4065
03:21:28,361 --> 03:21:31,241
said that he had been dead lifting the 
day before and the day before he took 

4066
03:21:31,251 --> 03:21:34,610
his test out of sydney.
Significantly decreased testosterone.

4067
03:21:34,850 --> 03:21:39,850
Well,
he said he repeated it a few times and 

4068
03:21:39,850 --> 03:21:39,850
has stayed low,
but if you're total raised,

4069
03:21:40,050 --> 03:21:42,230
it didn't raise rates by 100 percent.
No,

4070
03:21:42,240 --> 03:21:44,420
it was.
It was like 237,

4071
03:21:44,421 --> 03:21:46,120
I can't memorize last,
but there's little

4072
03:21:46,130 --> 03:21:47,090
though.
There's plenty of data.

4073
03:21:47,091 --> 03:21:49,460
If you're sharing a total testosterone 
was less than 250.

4074
03:21:49,461 --> 03:21:52,130
It's an adverse mortality predictor and 
you know,

4075
03:21:52,190 --> 03:21:54,440
he wants to be alive.
He doesn't need to do it.

4076
03:21:54,570 --> 03:21:57,950
Kayla peterson and Jordan might need to 
do it until they find a better path.

4077
03:21:58,430 --> 03:21:59,410
Sean's,
you know,

4078
03:21:59,430 --> 03:22:00,530
uh,
adopted it.

4079
03:22:00,531 --> 03:22:01,740
So there's,
you know,

4080
03:22:01,760 --> 03:22:04,330
the biggest puzzle is quickly,
quickly,

4081
03:22:04,340 --> 03:22:09,340
one of the things that plant based 
eaters and people that fill three 

4082
03:22:09,340 --> 03:22:13,691
quarters of their plate with fruit and 
vegetables get way more than everybody 

4083
03:22:13,691 --> 03:22:16,121
else has lots of vitamin c and vitamin c
builds healthy walls and build south 

4084
03:22:16,121 --> 03:22:16,550
immune systems.
You love vitamin c?

4085
03:22:16,551 --> 03:22:18,290
I love vitamin c,
I love it from foods.

4086
03:22:18,291 --> 03:22:20,210
I don't mind it as a supplement.
I don't mind it.

4087
03:22:20,211 --> 03:22:22,820
Intravenous vitamin c,
linus pauling.

4088
03:22:23,070 --> 03:22:24,610
There's so many,
uh,

4089
03:22:25,340 --> 03:22:27,860
benefits of the body.
Where are these people?

4090
03:22:27,861 --> 03:22:30,440
When every chart says that meat has no 
vitamin c,

4091
03:22:30,470 --> 03:22:31,640
are they eating raw meat?

4092
03:22:31,640 --> 03:22:36,640
Which might've vitamin c?
Are they eating organ meat which might 

4093
03:22:36,640 --> 03:22:40,341
have some invited?
Let me stop you there because I'll tell 

4094
03:22:40,341 --> 03:22:42,371
you what the explanation has been.
The explanation to me has been that 

4095
03:22:42,371 --> 03:22:46,151
there is a decrease in absorption of 
vitamin c when you're consuming vitamin 

4096
03:22:46,151 --> 03:22:48,010
c with all these other things.
Cruciferous vegetables,

4097
03:22:48,200 --> 03:22:53,200
carbohydrates,
all these different things that there's 

4098
03:22:53,200 --> 03:22:53,200
some sort of a,
there's an adverse effect.

4099
03:22:53,200 --> 03:22:53,890
Is that,
is that a fact?

4100
03:22:54,800 --> 03:22:57,800
If you take a thousand milligrams of 
vitamin c will absorb a lot of,

4101
03:22:57,960 --> 03:23:00,950
take 10,000
milligrams by percentage,

4102
03:23:00,951 --> 03:23:05,951
you won't absorb as much,
but you'll still get more than a 

4103
03:23:05,951 --> 03:23:06,440
thousand milligrams.
But there's also this theory that sensor

4104
03:23:06,441 --> 03:23:11,441
eating basically and no added glucose 
diet that there's some kind of 

4105
03:23:11,441 --> 03:23:13,410
competition in us between glucose and 
see.

4106
03:23:13,411 --> 03:23:17,390
So even if they get a touch a c,
they're absorbing it hyper efficiently.

4107
03:23:17,510 --> 03:23:22,510
Nobody knows.
They haven't developed getting clothes 

4108
03:23:22,510 --> 03:23:23,600
from glucogenesis uh,
internally,

4109
03:23:23,601 --> 03:23:23,870
right?

4110
03:23:23,870 --> 03:23:28,870
Because they're adding.
Surely it's a low carb diet and elidel 

4111
03:23:28,870 --> 03:23:31,310
alpha gal in there.
Maybe that's about the only I think.

4112
03:23:31,520 --> 03:23:33,160
I mean,
the point is we just don't know.

4113
03:23:33,200 --> 03:23:34,320
We don't know.
And,

4114
03:23:34,450 --> 03:23:38,660
and I mean as a,
as a practitioner myself,

4115
03:23:38,661 --> 03:23:43,661
and as someone who's dealt with chronic 
illness who wasn't able to find help 

4116
03:23:43,661 --> 03:23:43,661
anywhere else,
I mean,

4117
03:23:43,661 --> 03:23:48,401
I,
I do not be grudged people for sticking 

4118
03:23:48,401 --> 03:23:51,341
with something that they've tried 
everything and nothing has worked and 

4119
03:23:51,341 --> 03:23:51,341
they do this and they feel good.
I mean,

4120
03:23:51,341 --> 03:23:53,810
who can blame Them?
It's a dinner with Jordan,

4121
03:23:53,840 --> 03:23:58,840
Jordan Peterson.
He's eating these big giant stakes and 

4122
03:23:58,840 --> 03:23:59,540
he looks great.
He's lighter than he's been since he was

4123
03:23:59,541 --> 03:24:04,541
20 and I'm,
I'm 100 percent empathetic with that 

4124
03:24:04,541 --> 03:24:05,510
because I've been through something like
that myself.

4125
03:24:05,511 --> 03:24:10,310
But to then take that and say that we're
certain that it's safe is a big leap.

4126
03:24:10,520 --> 03:24:11,330
And so,
you know,

4127
03:24:11,380 --> 03:24:15,020
my field atherosclerosis takes years to 
develop and I wish him well.

4128
03:24:15,021 --> 03:24:16,910
He contributing amazing things in the 
world,

4129
03:24:17,150 --> 03:24:22,150
but unless he's tracking carotid and 
coronary and doing it year after year 

4130
03:24:22,150 --> 03:24:22,150
after year,
you know,

4131
03:24:22,150 --> 03:24:23,760
it's an experiment.
You might not Want to run,

4132
03:24:24,770 --> 03:24:29,770
run those tests.
Baseline baseline some nutrient 

4133
03:24:29,770 --> 03:24:32,790
deficiencies also take many years to 
consider.

4134
03:24:33,320 --> 03:24:34,820
There's another guy that I follow 
online.

4135
03:24:34,850 --> 03:24:36,140
I'm sorry,
I forget the gentleman's name,

4136
03:24:36,141 --> 03:24:39,410
but he advocates organ meat and he's 
saying that organ meat,

4137
03:24:39,470 --> 03:24:41,840
if you just eating steak that you've got
an issue,

4138
03:24:42,110 --> 03:24:44,250
but if you take into count liver

4139
03:24:44,310 --> 03:24:49,310
and heart kidneys that you are going to 
get all these essential nutrients from 

4140
03:24:49,310 --> 03:24:53,091
that you're still not getting vitamin c 
that I'm aware of an insignificant 

4141
03:24:53,091 --> 03:24:57,561
amount.
You're not getting cArotinoids and 

4142
03:24:57,561 --> 03:24:57,910
flavonoids and people not getting 
smaller phenol.

4143
03:24:57,970 --> 03:24:59,040
We don't know.
We don't know.

4144
03:24:59,670 --> 03:25:00,990
yeah,
so yeah,

4145
03:25:01,230 --> 03:25:04,140
we don't know.
Is a good summation of of is it possible

4146
03:25:04,141 --> 03:25:09,141
that there's some mechanism that's going
on that picture he was eating steak and 

4147
03:25:09,241 --> 03:25:14,241
cheese,
so it's apparently not an all meat diet 

4148
03:25:14,241 --> 03:25:16,551
and I'm not slamming them.
I really wish him well and he can do 

4149
03:25:16,551 --> 03:25:16,551
what he wants.
I don't know.

4150
03:25:16,551 --> 03:25:17,040
Very nice guy.
Yeah.

4151
03:25:17,041 --> 03:25:22,041
Yeah.
just detail is important though because 

4152
03:25:22,041 --> 03:25:24,900
the organ meats and then like fattier 
cuts of meat,

4153
03:25:24,901 --> 03:25:27,540
have glycine and other nutrients that 
are really important.

4154
03:25:27,541 --> 03:25:30,720
If you're only eating lean meat,
I think yeah,

4155
03:25:30,721 --> 03:25:32,400
I would be very concerned about that.

4156
03:25:32,430 --> 03:25:37,430
Children do not try this at home.
Someone tried to get me there were 

4157
03:25:37,430 --> 03:25:38,910
saying you should try a carnivore diet 
for 90 days,

4158
03:25:39,150 --> 03:25:39,870
and I said,
well,

4159
03:25:39,930 --> 03:25:44,930
the real problem with that be I game and
that's extremely smart and I like 

4160
03:25:46,561 --> 03:25:48,180
vegetables.
I love vegetables.

4161
03:25:48,210 --> 03:25:53,210
I like to eat them.
I eat vegetables with essentially every 

4162
03:25:53,210 --> 03:25:56,811
single meal.
That's very smart because I told you 

4163
03:25:56,811 --> 03:25:56,811
it's an antidote if nothing else.
I mean it's.

4164
03:25:56,811 --> 03:26:01,790
I do think that it's entirely possible 
that maybe it's people that have this 

4165
03:26:01,790 --> 03:26:05,250
disrupted gut microbiome,
but that some people might be alert.

4166
03:26:05,430 --> 03:26:10,430
One of the things that mckayla peterson 
brought up when she was on the podcast 

4167
03:26:10,430 --> 03:26:12,360
that it might very well be that she's 
allergic to almost everything.

4168
03:26:12,361 --> 03:26:14,370
She has some sort of an allergic 
reaction.

4169
03:26:14,640 --> 03:26:19,640
You,
I think you both think that that could 

4170
03:26:19,640 --> 03:26:19,640
be because of a fucked up.

4171
03:26:19,640 --> 03:26:20,310
Got my maps.
It's absolutely.

4172
03:26:20,311 --> 03:26:22,020
She just hasn't had evaluated.
She,

4173
03:26:22,230 --> 03:26:24,840
she started to laugh when I talked to my
naturopath.

4174
03:26:24,870 --> 03:26:26,400
That's what you should have kept on 
doing.

4175
03:26:26,460 --> 03:26:28,500
Gotten her gut analyte and gotten her 
gut healed.

4176
03:26:28,680 --> 03:26:30,690
I mean maybe that would've helped her,
you know,

4177
03:26:30,900 --> 03:26:35,400
kind of problem with those natural path.
It's like good psychics and can I try to

4178
03:26:35,401 --> 03:26:37,710
find one?
I'll tell you that it's also not.

4179
03:26:37,740 --> 03:26:39,960
Look,
not all problems are solvable,

4180
03:26:40,070 --> 03:26:41,300
right?
That's we,

4181
03:26:41,850 --> 03:26:46,850
that's a really hard thing to accept.
But let's say you get in a car accident 

4182
03:26:46,850 --> 03:26:48,480
and your spine is crushed,
you know,

4183
03:26:48,481 --> 03:26:51,300
most in short of a miracle,
you know,

4184
03:26:51,301 --> 03:26:56,301
that's not,
that person's not going to read fully 

4185
03:26:56,301 --> 03:26:58,521
regained their 100 percent of their 
musculoskeletal capabilities.

4186
03:26:59,020 --> 03:27:04,020
Right?
But we don't have that same 

4187
03:27:04,020 --> 03:27:04,440
understanding with other conditions,
health conditions.

4188
03:27:04,441 --> 03:27:09,441
Let's say I go to Indonesia and I get 10
parasites and you know,

4189
03:27:11,640 --> 03:27:12,100
and,
and,

4190
03:27:12,110 --> 03:27:15,060
and then I'd have to take tons of 
antibiotics to deal with that.

4191
03:27:15,450 --> 03:27:19,490
Is my gut ever going to return to 100 
percent of the function that it,

4192
03:27:19,520 --> 03:27:22,050
that it had before that even with all 
the right things,

4193
03:27:22,051 --> 03:27:27,051
maybe not.
And so I'm not saying that the people 

4194
03:27:27,051 --> 03:27:30,441
should give up hope and I'm saying that 
like we have to separate between this is

4195
03:27:31,321 --> 03:27:35,220
helping me and it's making me feel great
and nothing else worked.

4196
03:27:35,610 --> 03:27:39,630
and we know with 100 percent certainty 
that this is safe for the long term.

4197
03:27:39,840 --> 03:27:42,430
Those are two very questions

4198
03:27:42,430 --> 03:27:47,430
and again,
I'm totally empathetic to that and I 

4199
03:27:47,430 --> 03:27:51,091
would probably do the same thing,
situate yourself that has gone through 

4200
03:27:51,091 --> 03:27:52,450
this process of being extremely 
unhealthy and I might even say,

4201
03:27:52,720 --> 03:27:53,620
hey,
you know,

4202
03:27:53,621 --> 03:27:56,770
if I,
maybe I'll die five years earlier,

4203
03:27:56,771 --> 03:27:58,480
but I'll enjoy the,
you know,

4204
03:27:58,510 --> 03:28:03,510
those years of my life,
I won't be in pain and discomfort the 

4205
03:28:03,510 --> 03:28:04,600
entire time then sign me up or I might,
I might say to myself,

4206
03:28:05,020 --> 03:28:10,020
well wait,
it can't be that good for me to be 

4207
03:28:10,020 --> 03:28:10,020
inflamed all the time and like,
you know,

4208
03:28:10,450 --> 03:28:13,030
that can't be good for me,
so maybe even though the,

4209
03:28:13,230 --> 03:28:18,230
the all meat diet might have some 
downsides and it actually might be 

4210
03:28:18,230 --> 03:28:19,300
reducing inflammation and therefore that
will cancel out.

4211
03:28:19,510 --> 03:28:21,380
We just don't know.
What about all meat diet?

4212
03:28:21,400 --> 03:28:24,190
The thing that gets me is there's no 
vitamin supplementation.

4213
03:28:24,191 --> 03:28:29,191
I'm like,
what about an all meat diet with good 

4214
03:28:29,191 --> 03:28:29,290
supplementation of multivitamin and 
pretty smart idea.

4215
03:28:29,850 --> 03:28:34,850
It was fiber omega three coming fine.
It's being questioned.

4216
03:28:35,560 --> 03:28:40,560
I mean it is.
It as centraL to health in the medical 

4217
03:28:40,560 --> 03:28:40,960
literature,
Dr.

4218
03:28:40,960 --> 03:28:42,820
Dennis burkitt from england went to 
africa.

4219
03:28:42,850 --> 03:28:47,850
Describe fiber described it,
reduced all kinds of chronic diseases 

4220
03:28:47,850 --> 03:28:49,000
that you wrote,
a book called the fiber man and all.

4221
03:28:49,420 --> 03:28:52,480
It's being questioned now.
It's so entrenched.

4222
03:28:52,481 --> 03:28:55,090
Have we got it all wrong and only plants
of fiber.

4223
03:28:55,300 --> 03:28:57,040
It's a good question.
Where are they getting their fiber?

4224
03:28:57,220 --> 03:29:02,220
Their meat is sticking in their colon.
It's called putrefaction for days and 

4225
03:29:02,220 --> 03:29:02,320
days.
That's is it?

4226
03:29:02,590 --> 03:29:03,440
Yeah.
Well it's.

4227
03:29:03,550 --> 03:29:08,550
That is what happens and they.
Jaime died at 100 percent with every 

4228
03:29:08,550 --> 03:29:10,300
single person.
When you chew it well and drink water,

4229
03:29:10,301 --> 03:29:13,300
does it always get stuck?
It's generally thought that it's fiber.

4230
03:29:13,301 --> 03:29:16,480
That is the process of moving abdominal 
contents,

4231
03:29:16,481 --> 03:29:18,020
whether you eat a,
a,

4232
03:29:18,070 --> 03:29:19,650
an all plant diet or.
No,

4233
03:29:19,790 --> 03:29:24,790
I mean I think there's still,
there's definitely controversy about 

4234
03:29:24,790 --> 03:29:28,171
fiber,
but I think the weight of the evidence 

4235
03:29:28,171 --> 03:29:28,900
still still does suggested fermentable 
carbohydrates.

4236
03:29:28,930 --> 03:29:33,930
Fiber essentially beneficial because the
very important for the microbiome and we

4237
03:29:35,591 --> 03:29:35,970
have,
you know,

4238
03:29:36,050 --> 03:29:41,050
people like justin sonnenburg at 
stanford who's done a lot of good work 

4239
03:29:41,050 --> 03:29:41,050
here.
Um,

4240
03:29:41,050 --> 03:29:42,180
do we know with a hundred perCent 
certainty?

4241
03:29:42,240 --> 03:29:47,240
No,
but we also know that virtually every 

4242
03:29:47,240 --> 03:29:49,360
human population that's ever been 
studied had significant amounts of fiber

4243
03:29:49,361 --> 03:29:50,620
in their diet,
so,

4244
03:29:50,990 --> 03:29:52,810
so if we're going with die,
right?

4245
03:29:53,210 --> 03:29:53,660
No,
they,

4246
03:29:53,810 --> 03:29:57,910
they did a very high note,
the warriors,

4247
03:29:58,120 --> 03:30:03,120
they consumed the warriors consumed milk
and meat and blood at certain times of 

4248
03:30:03,120 --> 03:30:04,870
year when they were,
you know,

4249
03:30:04,910 --> 03:30:09,910
and,
and other times of year they did eat 

4250
03:30:09,910 --> 03:30:09,910
more plant foods,
so the white,

4251
03:30:09,910 --> 03:30:10,320
the white plants,
but in the,

4252
03:30:10,420 --> 03:30:12,490
even the nun,
the traditional knew it,

4253
03:30:12,580 --> 03:30:17,580
you know,
they had a d during certain times a 

4254
03:30:17,580 --> 03:30:20,680
year,
like the winter when the ground was 

4255
03:30:20,680 --> 03:30:22,771
covered with snow.
They had a very low intake of plant 

4256
03:30:22,771 --> 03:30:25,411
foods,
but they would still trade for them and 

4257
03:30:25,411 --> 03:30:28,051
then during the summer when,
when they were able to collect berries 

4258
03:30:28,051 --> 03:30:29,440
and things like that,
they would definitely do that.

4259
03:30:29,560 --> 03:30:33,280
So every culture that we know of that's 
been studied,

4260
03:30:33,281 --> 03:30:38,281
eight,
some combination of animal and plant 

4261
03:30:38,281 --> 03:30:38,281
foods,
you know,

4262
03:30:38,281 --> 03:30:38,281
what ratio,
what amount,

4263
03:30:38,281 --> 03:30:40,070
you know,
that varies place to place

4264
03:30:40,070 --> 03:30:41,790
depending on where they are.
Um,

4265
03:30:41,900 --> 03:30:46,900
but that's,
that's what the anthropological data 

4266
03:30:46,900 --> 03:30:46,900
show.
There's actually,

4267
03:30:46,900 --> 03:30:48,470
you know,
when you talk about this too,

4268
03:30:48,471 --> 03:30:50,210
super,
super cool piece of data.

4269
03:30:50,211 --> 03:30:55,211
I'll go quick,
there's a professor at university of 

4270
03:30:55,211 --> 03:30:55,211
pittsburgh,
steven o'keefe,

4271
03:30:55,211 --> 03:30:58,421
who took 20 african americans in 
pittsburgh eating and intercity not 

4272
03:30:58,421 --> 03:31:02,351
healthy diet and 20 rural africans in 
South Africa eating from the bush and 

4273
03:31:02,351 --> 03:31:06,791
largely plants and they switched them 
for 20 days and they measured every 

4274
03:31:06,791 --> 03:31:07,190
single thing they can measure in the 
microbiome,

4275
03:31:07,191 --> 03:31:08,750
in their stool,
metabolites,

4276
03:31:08,751 --> 03:31:13,751
tmao and all the rest.
Your body is so amazing that 20 days on 

4277
03:31:13,751 --> 03:31:14,210
a better diet,
well,

4278
03:31:14,220 --> 03:31:16,310
what I would call the rural african died
a better diet.

4279
03:31:16,580 --> 03:31:21,580
You know,
there was incredible changes towards 

4280
03:31:21,580 --> 03:31:21,580
health,
making butyric acid,

4281
03:31:21,580 --> 03:31:26,351
having bacteroidetes and prepatella I 
mean changes and the the rural african 

4282
03:31:26,391 --> 03:31:31,391
suffered american illness in terms of 
what you can measure within two weeks 

4283
03:31:31,391 --> 03:31:34,930
now there's data I just learned 
yesterday in los angeles that I'm 

4284
03:31:34,930 --> 03:31:34,930
microbiome changes in five days.

4285
03:31:34,930 --> 03:31:37,580
You go to a low sugar,
low protein plant diet.

4286
03:31:37,581 --> 03:31:39,200
This is university of southern 
California.

4287
03:31:39,380 --> 03:31:42,320
I can tell you in five days michela 
peterson's microbiome would change.

4288
03:31:42,470 --> 03:31:44,180
Would she feel better?
I don't know.

4289
03:31:44,330 --> 03:31:47,990
I'm just pointing out just the 
remarkable resiliency and that's part of

4290
03:31:47,991 --> 03:31:52,991
the issue.
You can feed a human a whole lot of 

4291
03:31:52,991 --> 03:31:55,571
diets and make it through procreation,
which is our main purpose of 

4292
03:31:55,571 --> 03:31:58,931
evolutionary biology to be here.
We're talking about from procreation to 

4293
03:31:58,931 --> 03:32:00,440
death for optimal health,
longevity,

4294
03:32:00,441 --> 03:32:03,350
health span.
there's more than one path.

4295
03:32:03,650 --> 03:32:06,770
um,
but let's not beat on our plant base,

4296
03:32:06,950 --> 03:32:10,640
the people out there because we've shown
you can reverse atherosclerosis.

4297
03:32:10,641 --> 03:32:12,860
We've shown you can reverse prostate 
cancer,

4298
03:32:13,040 --> 03:32:18,040
university of California south as a use 
csf and we've shown you can lengthen 

4299
03:32:18,040 --> 03:32:22,181
your telomeres,
which may have implications for 

4300
03:32:22,181 --> 03:32:24,341
longevity.
So it's done through ketogenic diet as 

4301
03:32:24,341 --> 03:32:24,341
well.

4302
03:32:24,341 --> 03:32:27,080
Doesn't that lengthen your telomeres?
I don't think that's been published.

4303
03:32:27,620 --> 03:32:29,450
It's a be an interesting project.
You know,

4304
03:32:29,451 --> 03:32:31,950
it takes about three to six months,
so you'd have nobody.

4305
03:32:31,990 --> 03:32:33,110
No,
it's not been looked at.

4306
03:32:33,670 --> 03:32:38,670
And they say the same thing about a diet
that is rich in a,

4307
03:32:40,280 --> 03:32:44,240
you know,
vegetables and fruits and animal foods.

4308
03:32:44,300 --> 03:32:44,850
You know,
the,

4309
03:32:44,910 --> 03:32:48,200
the benefits that you can reverse heart 
disease with what you just said.

4310
03:32:48,201 --> 03:32:53,201
Don't touch that.
You cannot reverse atherosclerosis with 

4311
03:32:53,201 --> 03:32:53,201
animal products.
It's never been studied.

4312
03:32:53,201 --> 03:32:57,761
The only thing.
so then how can you say you cannot do 

4313
03:32:57,761 --> 03:32:57,761
it?
Why do we have studies?

4314
03:32:57,761 --> 03:33:00,740
What would you tell a patient with the 
99 percent blockages that come to me?

4315
03:33:00,741 --> 03:33:01,720
Go eat meat.
That's.

4316
03:33:02,670 --> 03:33:07,670
We have studies that show that switching
from a standard american diet to a 

4317
03:33:09,530 --> 03:33:11,130
neutral for diet.
Yeah.

4318
03:33:11,580 --> 03:33:13,340
Um,
this is a new word,

4319
03:33:13,400 --> 03:33:16,640
neutraL for you coined this sarah 
ballantine.

4320
03:33:17,090 --> 03:33:21,170
And this is the idea is just plant based
meat.

4321
03:33:21,890 --> 03:33:22,760
Yeah,
yeah,

4322
03:33:22,850 --> 03:33:23,390
yeah.
It's,

4323
03:33:23,391 --> 03:33:27,530
it's a whole foods diet with fruits,
vegetables,

4324
03:33:27,531 --> 03:33:30,440
nuts and seeds.
Some starchy plants and animal foods.

4325
03:33:31,980 --> 03:33:33,290
Why don't you call that paleo?
Now?

4326
03:33:33,300 --> 03:33:38,300
The problem with paleo,
paleolithic people didn't really eat 

4327
03:33:38,300 --> 03:33:38,300
like that.
They had a lot of grains.

4328
03:33:38,300 --> 03:33:38,300
So when

4329
03:33:38,480 --> 03:33:43,230
I don't think that's for me,
for me,

4330
03:33:43,260 --> 03:33:47,520
neutral four is a more inclusive term.
That just means that what I said,

4331
03:33:47,521 --> 03:33:52,521
it doesn't necessarily some,
some neutral voice might include some 

4332
03:33:52,521 --> 03:33:55,791
dairy products.
They might include some grains or 

4333
03:33:55,791 --> 03:33:55,791
lagoons,
um,

4334
03:33:55,791 --> 03:33:59,580
but what they're eating whole real foods
and they're including animal foods there

4335
03:33:59,610 --> 03:34:04,610
to distinguish that from vegan or 
vegetarian isn't the criticism of the 

4336
03:34:04,610 --> 03:34:06,330
paleolithic diet or calling it the 
paleolithic diet.

4337
03:34:06,331 --> 03:34:11,331
The people in the paleolithic era 
actually did experience at least some 

4338
03:34:11,331 --> 03:34:14,190
form of agriculture people.
There has been recent data that suggests

4339
03:34:14,191 --> 03:34:19,191
that a green consumption in lagoon 
consumption went back further than it 

4340
03:34:19,321 --> 03:34:21,570
was originally thought it was.
Now,

4341
03:34:21,720 --> 03:34:26,720
whether those were prominent parts of 
the diet or fall back foods is another 

4342
03:34:27,001 --> 03:34:29,700
question.
And does that even matter?

4343
03:34:29,701 --> 03:34:34,701
I mean,
this is why I've argued that the 

4344
03:34:34,701 --> 03:34:37,011
evolutionary perspective is important.
it's just a way of generating 

4345
03:34:37,011 --> 03:34:39,240
hypotheses,
kind of like observational research.

4346
03:34:39,650 --> 03:34:42,840
It's not an.
you can't look at what our ancestors ate

4347
03:34:42,841 --> 03:34:45,450
and say that therefore that's what we 
should eat right now.

4348
03:34:45,480 --> 03:34:46,800
You can look at it and say,
oh,

4349
03:34:46,801 --> 03:34:48,630
that's interesting.
Let's test this out.

4350
03:34:48,690 --> 03:34:49,970
Joel,
how does it reverse

4351
03:34:50,140 --> 03:34:50,780
disease?
Okay.

4352
03:34:50,920 --> 03:34:53,740
Ketogenic diet and tila mirrors.
There's no sane studies out there.

4353
03:34:53,741 --> 03:34:56,860
Just to follow up to know,
um,

4354
03:34:57,610 --> 03:35:01,030
how does it reverse heart disease?
You go back to los angeles,

4355
03:35:01,031 --> 03:35:03,340
California in 1948,
Dr.

4356
03:35:03,340 --> 03:35:04,480
Lester morrison,
internist.

4357
03:35:04,481 --> 03:35:09,481
It's real answer.
Saw that in the country of Norway in 

4358
03:35:09,481 --> 03:35:12,811
world war two where they dropped their 
animal food consumption because of the 

4359
03:35:12,811 --> 03:35:13,690
nazis.
Heart disease slowed for those two,

4360
03:35:13,691 --> 03:35:14,920
three years.
He said,

4361
03:35:14,921 --> 03:35:17,260
I wonder what happens with my heart 
patients in los angeles,

4362
03:35:17,261 --> 03:35:19,210
he had 100 of them.
There was no treatment.

4363
03:35:19,211 --> 03:35:23,020
in 1948,
he put half of them on a low animal diet

4364
03:35:23,021 --> 03:35:26,350
with very high plants that half of them 
make like los angeles people.

4365
03:35:26,500 --> 03:35:31,500
Eight years later,
50 percent on the high plant lowfat 

4366
03:35:31,500 --> 03:35:31,500
diet.
We're alive.

4367
03:35:31,500 --> 03:35:35,461
Zero percent on the standard.
Los angeles died and then a series of 

4368
03:35:35,461 --> 03:35:36,790
people said,
let's start doing that more routinely.

4369
03:35:36,880 --> 03:35:41,880
Ultimately there were randomized 
clinical studies using cath lab 

4370
03:35:41,880 --> 03:35:43,210
techniques using ultrasound techniques 
using pet scanning.

4371
03:35:43,210 --> 03:35:48,210
This shows it actually causes small 
decreases in the amount of plaque in 

4372
03:35:48,210 --> 03:35:52,291
your heart arteries,
which results in tripling of blood flow 

4373
03:35:52,291 --> 03:35:54,100
because it's it's fluid physiology that 
is four r squared,

4374
03:35:54,101 --> 03:35:59,101
so small decreases in plaque.
Nobody ever thought you could decrease 

4375
03:35:59,101 --> 03:36:02,311
plaque with diet and lifestyle,
but you can cause this big increase in 

4376
03:36:02,311 --> 03:36:02,311
flow.
So within three,

4377
03:36:02,311 --> 03:36:02,800
four weeks,
chest pain goes away.

4378
03:36:03,040 --> 03:36:04,390
Within three,
four months,

4379
03:36:04,391 --> 03:36:05,590
stressed us,
get better,

4380
03:36:05,740 --> 03:36:10,740
and as you keep going,
a number of hospitalizations procedures 

4381
03:36:10,740 --> 03:36:13,240
go down dramatically to the point.
Initially small studies got big enough.

4382
03:36:13,450 --> 03:36:18,450
In 2010 medicare said,
we'll pay for patients to learn how to 

4383
03:36:18,450 --> 03:36:20,890
do this reversal lifestyle.
They don't pay for mediterranean diet,

4384
03:36:20,920 --> 03:36:22,990
they don't pay for dash diet,
they don't pay for paleo,

4385
03:36:22,991 --> 03:36:23,940
keto,
neutral for.

4386
03:36:24,130 --> 03:36:25,860
They pay for plant based diets for 
advantage

4387
03:36:26,260 --> 03:36:31,260
only because the these concepts of 
neutral bar and paleo have not been 

4388
03:36:31,260 --> 03:36:32,500
around for very long.
So all you said

4389
03:36:33,140 --> 03:36:35,140
the study,
okay,

4390
03:36:35,430 --> 03:36:35,650
you don't

4391
03:36:35,980 --> 03:36:39,000
have the millions of dollars to do this 
study but don't.

4392
03:36:39,090 --> 03:36:43,780
Don't be rigorous.
So all all that you have said,

4393
03:36:43,781 --> 03:36:46,300
which I agree with,
is that a plant,

4394
03:36:46,480 --> 03:36:51,480
a vegan or plant based kind of diet 
compared to a standard american diet 

4395
03:36:51,480 --> 03:36:53,490
will reverse some markers of 
atherosclerosis.

4396
03:36:53,540 --> 03:36:55,490
Tip number one,
the.

4397
03:36:56,710 --> 03:36:59,590
I agree with that statement,
but there's no.

4398
03:37:00,070 --> 03:37:05,070
We don't have research.
It's not like studies have been done 

4399
03:37:05,070 --> 03:37:08,700
taking people from standard american to 
neutral for paleo and we haven't seen 

4400
03:37:08,700 --> 03:37:10,450
benefits.
We have rcts that have shown significant

4401
03:37:10,451 --> 03:37:15,451
benefits in cardiovascular markers,
markers neutral for diets and paleo and 

4402
03:37:16,691 --> 03:37:19,060
low carb for that matter,
and key to genic.

4403
03:37:20,480 --> 03:37:25,480
Your assumption is that the real issues 
of standard american diet is killing 

4404
03:37:25,480 --> 03:37:28,420
people and lack of that lack of evidence
is not evidence against it,

4405
03:37:28,460 --> 03:37:31,680
so we don't.
We don't know that.

4406
03:37:31,840 --> 03:37:35,170
How long have.
How long have these concepts been around

4407
03:37:35,171 --> 03:37:36,370
neutral for paleo?

4408
03:37:36,640 --> 03:37:39,040
How many studies have been done looking,
comparing,

4409
03:37:39,340 --> 03:37:44,340
for example,
let's do it would be great if we had a 

4410
03:37:44,340 --> 03:37:44,340
study where you had standard american 
diet,

4411
03:37:44,340 --> 03:37:48,920
then you had two different groups you 
had or a control group of standard 

4412
03:37:48,920 --> 03:37:52,831
american diet and then you had you know,
vegan diet and then you had neutral for 

4413
03:37:52,831 --> 03:37:53,290
paleo.
We don't have that study,

4414
03:37:53,590 --> 03:37:58,570
so we can't say that that eating a diet 
that's rich in whole foods but contained

4415
03:37:58,571 --> 03:38:01,660
some animal foods isn't going to reverse
atherosclerosis.

4416
03:38:02,020 --> 03:38:07,020
We can't say that.
So I think one thing that we can 

4417
03:38:07,020 --> 03:38:09,001
absolutely agree on is that the standard
american diet socks and that a vegan 

4418
03:38:09,001 --> 03:38:11,020
diet is superior to the standard 
american diet.

4419
03:38:11,080 --> 03:38:12,040
These,
these two men,

4420
03:38:12,730 --> 03:38:16,980
these two things are if the vegan 
implementing wisely,

4421
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:18,250
wisely.
I just tell you,

4422
03:38:18,470 --> 03:38:21,670
and this is very subtle,
but vegan diets as which you can't do.

4423
03:38:21,670 --> 03:38:25,360
You can't eat dairy and eggs,
you can't eat fish can eat whole food.

4424
03:38:25,361 --> 03:38:27,700
Plant based is really the proper medical
term.

4425
03:38:27,760 --> 03:38:29,610
What do you eat?
Eat john.

4426
03:38:29,620 --> 03:38:33,400
Joseph talks about too,
he calls it call with a whole food plant

4427
03:38:33,401 --> 03:38:34,930
based because you,
you know,

4428
03:38:34,931 --> 03:38:36,730
you don't want to be just eating pasta 
all day.

4429
03:38:37,000 --> 03:38:42,000
Oh absolutely.
No food vegetarian or junk food vegan 

4430
03:38:42,000 --> 03:38:45,031
diet.
So the dispute is whether or not animal 

4431
03:38:45,031 --> 03:38:47,030
protein in organ meats will advance your
health and,

4432
03:38:47,090 --> 03:38:48,910
and,
and make in debt.

4433
03:38:48,911 --> 03:38:52,780
It's a superior diet when you add that 
one quarter of your plate.

4434
03:38:52,781 --> 03:38:53,680
So yeah,
I'm.

4435
03:38:53,681 --> 03:38:56,350
One of the ways to answer this is to 
look at nutrient density.

4436
03:38:56,440 --> 03:39:00,220
So I have this study on my websites,
my yo,

4437
03:39:00,250 --> 03:39:02,440
I think my low and my french is 
terrible.

4438
03:39:02,441 --> 03:39:06,040
M a I l l o,
t and m,

4439
03:39:06,820 --> 03:39:07,730
uh,
it's uh,

4440
03:39:07,810 --> 03:39:11,240
[inaudible] dot com slash rogan,
um,

4441
03:39:11,350 --> 03:39:16,350
and he looked at nutrient density of 
foods and categorize them based on 

4442
03:39:16,350 --> 03:39:17,630
nutrient density and he was only looking
at,

4443
03:39:17,830 --> 03:39:20,890
he was looking at essential nutrients,
so all the vitamins and minerals that we

4444
03:39:20,891 --> 03:39:25,891
absolutely need for health.
He wasn't looking at polyphenols and 

4445
03:39:25,891 --> 03:39:26,710
flavonoids and things like that,
which are beneficial,

4446
03:39:26,711 --> 03:39:31,711
but we don't absolutely need.
So the number one food in terms of 

4447
03:39:32,231 --> 03:39:37,231
nutrient density,
do you want to guess what organ meats 

4448
03:39:37,231 --> 03:39:38,480
organized score of seven.
Fifty four.

4449
03:39:38,540 --> 03:39:41,360
Next highest shellfish.
Six 43.

4450
03:39:41,361 --> 03:39:43,700
And I've often said this to my patients 
like kale,

4451
03:39:43,900 --> 03:39:47,720
you can be a vegetarian or an only eat 
organ,

4452
03:39:47,721 --> 03:39:52,721
meats and shellfish,
you'd be doing really well because of 

4453
03:39:52,721 --> 03:39:52,721
just how nutrient dense they are.

4454
03:39:52,721 --> 03:39:54,150
And that's not really a controversial.

4455
03:39:54,710 --> 03:39:56,870
Let me come here.
Fatty fish,

4456
03:39:56,900 --> 03:40:00,890
six slash 22.
Lean fish is three 75.

4457
03:40:01,320 --> 03:40:03,560
Um,
and then vegetables or 3:52

4458
03:40:03,561 --> 03:40:04,190
so that,
you know,

4459
03:40:04,191 --> 03:40:06,800
vegetables are on there,
but a organ,

4460
03:40:06,801 --> 03:40:07,820
meat,
shellfish,

4461
03:40:07,850 --> 03:40:09,740
fatty fish,
lean fish,

4462
03:40:10,270 --> 03:40:13,250
um,
are all higher than,

4463
03:40:13,310 --> 03:40:18,310
than vegetables and grains and lagoons 
don't even really make the,

4464
03:40:19,470 --> 03:40:24,470
you know,
they're nowhere close in terms of 

4465
03:40:24,470 --> 03:40:24,470
nutrient density.
I think we can all agree that,

4466
03:40:24,470 --> 03:40:28,770
uh,
when someone goes from the standard 

4467
03:40:28,770 --> 03:40:31,181
american diet to a vegan diet,
there's a real reason why they're 

4468
03:40:31,181 --> 03:40:31,430
experiencing significant health 
benefits,

4469
03:40:31,610 --> 03:40:33,710
particularly if they supplement.
YeAh,

4470
03:40:33,760 --> 03:40:34,550
yeah,
that's right.

4471
03:40:34,551 --> 03:40:38,150
That's true.
Are highly processed and refined,

4472
03:40:38,630 --> 03:40:43,630
assuming they're eating a whole foods 
vegan diet and not just subsisting on 

4473
03:40:43,630 --> 03:40:46,580
begets and cookies and stuff like that,
which unfortunately people do.

4474
03:40:46,610 --> 03:40:49,800
We'll do just like people eat the 
standard american diet and you know,

4475
03:40:49,820 --> 03:40:52,090
for that matter,
just like people who go paleo and,

4476
03:40:52,300 --> 03:40:57,300
and,
and are eating paleo donuts and paleo 

4477
03:40:57,300 --> 03:40:57,300
ice cream,
whatever,

4478
03:40:57,300 --> 03:41:02,141
you know,
like you can do it on any dietary 

4479
03:41:02,141 --> 03:41:02,141
approach.
No foods.

4480
03:41:02,141 --> 03:41:02,190
It was going to say,
you know,

4481
03:41:02,200 --> 03:41:06,230
I never have proposed except for one 
small subset that everybody needs to eat

4482
03:41:06,231 --> 03:41:08,170
a completely plant based diet.
But if they do,

4483
03:41:08,171 --> 03:41:09,460
they're probably going to have good 
health.

4484
03:41:09,640 --> 03:41:11,950
There's a concept called the spectrum.
Dr.

4485
03:41:11,950 --> 03:41:13,300
Dean ornish,
some people beat up on,

4486
03:41:13,301 --> 03:41:18,301
but he's done all these studies on 
reversal of atherosclerosis and he 

4487
03:41:18,301 --> 03:41:18,760
celebrated around the world.
Has a book called the spectrum.

4488
03:41:18,820 --> 03:41:21,790
Go as far towards it as you can.
I'll love you wherever you're at,

4489
03:41:21,791 --> 03:41:23,230
you choose.
We're not judging you.

4490
03:41:23,231 --> 03:41:25,390
And that's I think the message for your 
listeners.

4491
03:41:25,391 --> 03:41:28,870
I mean it what you're eating vegetables 
or fruit or maybe it's just vegetables.

4492
03:41:28,871 --> 03:41:33,871
Every meal.
That's the example people need to hear 

4493
03:41:33,871 --> 03:41:33,910
and they don't need to abandon 
everything else.

4494
03:41:34,090 --> 03:41:36,100
Just don't do it with a donut.
Don't do it with a bagel.

4495
03:41:36,101 --> 03:41:39,160
Don't do these calorie empty.
And also time restricted eating.

4496
03:41:39,161 --> 03:41:41,380
I think we all agree on the awesome.
Twelve hours,

4497
03:41:41,381 --> 03:41:46,381
14 hours a day.
I'm a big fan of four or five days a 

4498
03:41:46,381 --> 03:41:47,410
month,
lowering calories with low protein,

4499
03:41:47,411 --> 03:41:49,210
low sugar,
and now the science is coming out.

4500
03:41:49,270 --> 03:41:51,250
Unbelievable.
It's right here from los angeles.

4501
03:41:51,670 --> 03:41:52,660
No,
I mean,

4502
03:41:52,730 --> 03:41:57,730
so I want to say that we're talking 
about helping people and I was a vegan 

4503
03:41:57,730 --> 03:42:01,460
at one point and a vegetarian and I have
friends that are vegans and vegetarians.

4504
03:42:01,461 --> 03:42:03,540
Again,
I'm not ideological about this at all.

4505
03:42:04,300 --> 03:42:06,530
And um,
so I want to say like,

4506
03:42:06,560 --> 03:42:11,560
so someone who is a vegetarian or vegan 
and just to show how nutrient dense 

4507
03:42:11,560 --> 03:42:15,610
organ meats and shellfish are,
if you want it to be a vegan but you're 

4508
03:42:15,610 --> 03:42:15,800
not,
you know,

4509
03:42:15,980 --> 03:42:20,930
ideologically opposed to eating some 
small amount of animal product or animal

4510
03:42:20,931 --> 03:42:25,931
food,
you could eat one clam oyster and four 

4511
03:42:25,931 --> 03:42:29,231
grams,
which is a tiny amount of liver a day 

4512
03:42:29,231 --> 03:42:29,710
and you would completely meet your needs
for b12,

4513
03:42:29,750 --> 03:42:31,040
zinc,
copper,

4514
03:42:31,050 --> 03:42:31,740
coleen,

4515
03:42:32,130 --> 03:42:37,130
and many other nutrients with no other 
consumption of animal foods beyond that.

4516
03:42:37,740 --> 03:42:41,100
So this is what I said before,
like the spectrum is large,

4517
03:42:41,101 --> 03:42:42,600
you know,
some people might consume a much,

4518
03:42:42,660 --> 03:42:46,590
a higher percentage of animal foods.
Some people could consume just that much

4519
03:42:46,650 --> 03:42:51,650
and they would still improve their 
health and wellbeing by doing that from 

4520
03:42:52,290 --> 03:42:55,740
then eating a strictly a plant diet.

4521
03:42:56,840 --> 03:42:57,670
And,
uh,

4522
03:42:57,740 --> 03:42:59,660
one thing that I do have to tell you,
joel,

4523
03:42:59,661 --> 03:43:04,661
unfortunately,
is that you keep saying that nick and 

4524
03:43:04,661 --> 03:43:04,661
nate diaz or vegan,

4525
03:43:04,661 --> 03:43:05,860
I know they,
they've fallen back.

4526
03:43:05,900 --> 03:43:07,630
I don't keep saying it,
but they've fallen back.

4527
03:43:07,660 --> 03:43:09,550
Well,
you brought it up a bunch of times,

4528
03:43:09,551 --> 03:43:10,570
but he was.
When he,

4529
03:43:10,600 --> 03:43:11,750
when he won the fight,
he was,

4530
03:43:12,810 --> 03:43:14,990
he was eating fish,
fish and eggs.

4531
03:43:15,030 --> 03:43:16,040
That's cool.
I worry about this tape,

4532
03:43:16,050 --> 03:43:16,950
male level,
but it's cool.

4533
03:43:17,280 --> 03:43:18,070
No,
I'm serious.

4534
03:43:18,071 --> 03:43:19,600
But you know,
the explosion,

4535
03:43:19,601 --> 03:43:23,080
the Tennessee titans and kyrie irving 
and serena williams.

4536
03:43:23,081 --> 03:43:25,120
I mean serena williams is vegan as well.
Yeah.

4537
03:43:25,121 --> 03:43:27,610
She reversed and auto immune disease 
called sjogren's.

4538
03:43:27,611 --> 03:43:32,611
Yeah.
So is it isn't necessary to be plant 

4539
03:43:32,611 --> 03:43:33,100
based to be a world class athlete?
Obviously not.

4540
03:43:33,280 --> 03:43:38,280
Is it compatible to be.
Do you know who patrick bamyan holds a 

4541
03:43:38,280 --> 03:43:39,880
world record for power lifting?
He's been plant based his whole life.

4542
03:43:40,120 --> 03:43:41,680
Big,
stocky litho guy up.

4543
03:43:42,250 --> 03:43:43,390
Patrick,
pat,

4544
03:43:43,450 --> 03:43:44,560
pat,
r I k,

4545
03:43:44,700 --> 03:43:49,700
I mean it's this big stocky german,
but he lives 1200 pounds and he has the 

4546
03:43:49,700 --> 03:43:49,700
world record.

4547
03:43:49,700 --> 03:43:50,920
He hasn't eaten some meat.
None.

4548
03:43:50,921 --> 03:43:53,290
Nick delgado a nema delgado.
Nick,

4549
03:43:53,340 --> 03:43:58,000
the point is it's an option to be a 
super athlete without animal products.

4550
03:43:58,180 --> 03:44:00,830
We're seeing it more and more recovery.
Which troll on your thing,

4551
03:44:01,200 --> 03:44:06,200
but you know it happens.
Just stop beating on us because we're 

4552
03:44:06,200 --> 03:44:07,060
doing pretty well,
but yeah,

4553
03:44:07,061 --> 03:44:09,730
fds has gone back to eating fish and 
vegetables.

4554
03:44:10,690 --> 03:44:15,690
It's a whole lot better than the crap 
american diet that a lot of athletes 

4555
03:44:15,690 --> 03:44:17,500
say.
They just cut out all the land animals.

4556
03:44:17,580 --> 03:44:20,020
Yeah.
You initially started doing it to make.

4557
03:44:20,021 --> 03:44:21,670
Wait,
okay.

4558
03:44:21,970 --> 03:44:22,780
Yeah,
I got it.

4559
03:44:23,050 --> 03:44:23,620
Got it,
got it.

4560
03:44:24,190 --> 03:44:26,350
A lot of people are talking about 
quicker recovery that.

4561
03:44:26,920 --> 03:44:29,190
I mean there's some like alex and sarah 
sees the world

4562
03:44:29,240 --> 03:44:30,220
class fighter.
He's.

4563
03:44:30,280 --> 03:44:35,190
He's completely vegan.
Sean o'malley was for awhile,

4564
03:44:35,210 --> 03:44:38,570
but he found himself to have much more 
energy when he started eating meat,

4565
03:44:38,571 --> 03:44:41,100
but he might've been.
He might've been doing it wrong or not.

4566
03:44:41,400 --> 03:44:43,810
My biome and supplementation.
Yeah,

4567
03:44:44,110 --> 03:44:45,020
believe it,
you know,

4568
03:44:45,021 --> 03:44:46,020
but that's really cool.
This,

4569
03:44:46,030 --> 03:44:51,030
I forget her name right now,
the chef that cooked for 15 Tennessee 

4570
03:44:51,030 --> 03:44:53,701
titans and you know,
they're just kicking ass and griff 

4571
03:44:53,701 --> 03:44:53,701
wailin used to be with the miami 
dolphins.

4572
03:44:53,701 --> 03:44:54,460
I forget where he is now,
oakland raiders,

4573
03:44:54,730 --> 03:44:55,450
you know,
a great,

4574
03:44:55,451 --> 03:44:56,920
great tight end and such.
I mean,

4575
03:44:57,100 --> 03:45:02,100
it's possible that we can say scott 
jurek set the world record for the 

4576
03:45:02,100 --> 03:45:03,970
appalachian trail faster than either the
person eat beans.

4577
03:45:03,971 --> 03:45:05,530
I mean,
insane.

4578
03:45:05,570 --> 03:45:08,440
A level of athletic fitness.
The appalachian trail.

4579
03:45:08,500 --> 03:45:09,370
yeah.
It's like 24,

4580
03:45:09,380 --> 03:45:10,810
100,
2,400

4581
03:45:10,811 --> 03:45:13,930
miles fast as human to ever accomplish 
it on beans.

4582
03:45:13,931 --> 03:45:15,370
I mean,
pretty cool.

4583
03:45:15,371 --> 03:45:20,371
I mean,
this was such an amazing thing to watch 

4584
03:45:20,371 --> 03:45:20,371
a documentary.
Yeah.

4585
03:45:20,371 --> 03:45:21,470
Should we wrap this up?
Yeah.

4586
03:45:22,240 --> 03:45:24,310
Wow.
We obviously we've left

4587
03:45:24,350 --> 03:45:26,050
flat on the table.
It was still alive.

4588
03:45:26,060 --> 03:45:27,380
We did,
that's disputed.

4589
03:45:27,740 --> 03:45:32,740
But uh,
I think one thing that we came to a 

4590
03:45:32,740 --> 03:45:35,641
really solid conclusion,
not as a standard american diet sucks 

4591
03:45:35,641 --> 03:45:39,630
and any deviation from it,
that's a whole food based diet and 

4592
03:45:39,630 --> 03:45:43,770
especially with proper nutrients that 
are supplemented if you're vegan or what

4593
03:45:43,781 --> 03:45:48,781
have you,
is going to be better than standard 

4594
03:45:48,781 --> 03:45:51,001
american diet.
The dispute is whether or not the 

4595
03:45:51,001 --> 03:45:51,490
nutrient dense organ meats,
shellfish,

4596
03:45:51,520 --> 03:45:53,110
meat,
fish,

4597
03:45:53,410 --> 03:45:58,410
and these things would eggs.
That these would benefit you 

4598
03:45:58,410 --> 03:46:01,201
significantly.
And I think that's how we got through 

4599
03:46:01,241 --> 03:46:02,340
it,
like very peacefully,

4600
03:46:02,360 --> 03:46:02,790
just just

4601
03:46:03,100 --> 03:46:04,600
eat real food,
real food.

4602
03:46:04,690 --> 03:46:07,300
I actually refer people in san francisco
to chris.

4603
03:46:07,301 --> 03:46:12,301
I honor what he's doing.
I mean we may have this dispute about 

4604
03:46:12,301 --> 03:46:12,670
saturated fat and cholesterol and it's 
not unimportant,

4605
03:46:12,671 --> 03:46:16,240
but he is a prime practitioner.
He's treating people at the right level.

4606
03:46:16,241 --> 03:46:18,790
I believe I'm doing that in detroit.
And the people that come to see me,

4607
03:46:19,040 --> 03:46:20,140
you know,
where the solution.

4608
03:46:20,141 --> 03:46:22,270
We're not the problem despite the 
differences.

4609
03:46:22,271 --> 03:46:23,980
And you're a good man to bring us on,
you know,

4610
03:46:24,040 --> 03:46:24,720
point all that out.

4611
03:46:24,970 --> 03:46:27,310
both handled yourself admirably.
I mean this is,

4612
03:46:27,320 --> 03:46:31,720
this is a very emotional,
tightly contested sort of a dispute.

4613
03:46:31,721 --> 03:46:36,721
And I,
I thank you both very much for being 

4614
03:46:36,721 --> 03:46:36,721
here.

4615
03:46:36,721 --> 03:46:39,330
Well thanks for the opportunity to joe.
I mean the have the chance to do this 

4616
03:46:39,330 --> 03:46:41,980
for what almost four hours now.
That's amazing.

4617
03:46:42,010 --> 03:46:47,010
And it serves people because on most tv 
segments it's like five minutes and you 

4618
03:46:47,010 --> 03:46:48,010
just get the headlines and there's no 
depth.

4619
03:46:48,011 --> 03:46:50,930
So you get these click bait articles and
it's confusing.

4620
03:46:51,100 --> 03:46:54,220
So thanks for giving us the chance to 
really dive deeply on it.

4621
03:46:54,310 --> 03:46:57,670
