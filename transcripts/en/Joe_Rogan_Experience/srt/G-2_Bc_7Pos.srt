1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,240
Three to Jamie with the quick count.
Jimmy Dore.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,163
We're live.
We're live.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,011
Oh,
fantastic.

4
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:08,940
Do you use headsets or.
No?

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,690
Oh Shit.
Sorry.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,551
Headset.
It's up to you.

7
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:13,380
I just feel lonely if I'm the only guy 
with headsets.

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,151
Oh,
okay.

9
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:16,640
Is there a better trigger?
What?

10
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,450
Hey,
what jobs did it's one,

11
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,450
one minute after 1159 minutes before the
top 12 hours.

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,493
Did you ever do that?
Do you ever do like a regular radio 

13
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:24,960
show?
I had in college.

14
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:26,670
I had a radio show,
but it wasn't real.

15
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,680
It was just broadcast to no one actually
it turned out to the campus.

16
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:32,514
It was it just to the campus we're 
supposed to be going out to the campus 

17
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,720
and then we found out about three months
in,

18
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:36,554
it wasn't going out to anybody.
I always had dreams of doing a radio 

19
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:39,894
show,
but I always knew that I would fuck it 

20
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:41,491
up,
you know,

21
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:43,260
I'm like I'd get fired or something.

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,180
I never and I never thought anybody 
would hire me.

23
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,960
I got in trouble at that station for a,
a,

24
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,880
for playing the same song three times in
a row.

25
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,231
It was so good.
Yeah,

26
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:53,340
I liked it.
It was a song,

27
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:54,174
I don't even remember.
It was like some off brand and I never 

28
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:56,604
heard of them,
but like the Rabbini brothers and I was 

29
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:58,540
like,
this a fun song.

30
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,690
They fired you from a college station,
fire me.

31
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:02,550
They came in and he yelled at me and I 
was like,

32
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:07,551
this doesn't even go and go to anyone 
and if it was a nice day and I had to do

33
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:11,130
my radio shift,
I would just come in and simulcasts with

34
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:11,964
the FM because that was on am simulcasts
with the FM station because I wanted to 

35
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:17,430
go out in the quad.
I want to sit in the studio.

36
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,220
It was next day.
I wonder if anybody has done this.

37
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:24,030
I mean I don't think you could do it and
put ads on it,

38
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,250
but you could do it.
It was just a fun project.

39
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:30,810
Have your own radio show on a podcast.
We'd just play songs.

40
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,360
Could you do that Jamie?
No,

41
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,630
I think because you can't give.
If you give people a download of a song.

42
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,860
That's right.
Yeah.

43
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,930
That's why.
Yeah.

44
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,780
So you could stream it though,
maybe like stream it on youtube,

45
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,790
maybe,
maybe but not,

46
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
but you'd still have to pay some kind of
royalties for those songs.

47
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:50,940
I don't know what.
Even if you weren't making any money off

48
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:51,870
of it,
you don't have to pay.

49
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,200
I think so if someone is streaming your 
jokes,

50
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:57,210
they have to pay.
Yeah.

51
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:59,370
But the thing is nobody wants to hear 
your jokes more than once.

52
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,600
That's the problem with jokes.

53
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,710
That's not true.
Joe.

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,710
Really?
Alright for first of all,

55
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,390
let me blow smoke up your ass a little 
bit.

56
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:07,830
I'm not actually,
it's just sincere.

57
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,500
So I've seen you do comedy before I saw 
you.

58
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:13,770
We did the 2004,
I think it was the aspen festival.

59
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:17,280
We were on the opening night show at the
Wheeler Opera House.

60
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:21,060
And then I saw you do sets at the Improv
and I always thought you were funny,

61
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,430
you know.
Uh,

62
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,270
but I never remembered any of your 
jokes.

63
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,703
And then I saw you at the comedy store a
couple of weeks ago and I've been doing 

64
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:29,610
your act ever since.

65
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,353
I've been telling you jokes everywhere I
go to anybody who will listen and 

66
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,150
everybody falls down laughing.
Those jokes that you have,

67
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,840
first of all of the joke about Weinstein
is just so God damn funny.

68
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,460
And then the joke about the wrestling,
God damn it.

69
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,490
You know,
and I,

70
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,443
it's,
it's hard for me to not say them right 

71
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:50,514
in your face right now.
I know how that would be not good if I 

72
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:56,460
did your jokes right to you,
but I can't not do.

73
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,960
Those are some of the funniest jokes 
I've heard in a long time.

74
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,010
I know

75
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,880
people are going to be saying,
oh,

76
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,650
he's such a kiss ass.
I'm not kidding.

77
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:03,484
I love comedy and I love jokes and I can
remember jokes that I like and a few 

78
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:10,444
whites theme that's so rushed to get 
that onto a netflix special because I'm 

79
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,780
worried it's going to get old.
Yeah,

80
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,321
right.
Right.

81
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:18,280
Now,
you know,

82
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,050
it's like it happened a couple of months
ago.

83
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:22,660
It's still okay and I'm recording in 
April and one.

84
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,440
I'm like,
boy,

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,990
April is like the wire that's like under
the wire.

86
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,853
Yeah,
I think it'll be okay because they're 

87
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,480
not going to be a bigger rapper or 
whatever.

88
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:33,040
Then Harvey Weinstein could come.
He's.

89
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,340
He's the pinnacle.
Right.

90
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,193
Like if you had a cosby joke today,
it's still okay because he's such a 

91
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,280
raper.
That's right.

92
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,710
I forgot cosby your ride.
You forget.

93
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:44,440
Did you see the recent shit?
We're cosby was at a barber shop.

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,730
There's videos of him hanging out at the
barber shop talking about jazz,

95
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,170
a trivia barber shop guys and Philly.
No.

96
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,170
Yeah,
he actually performed recently at a jazz

97
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,340
club.
Yeah.

98
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,174
He showed up at this jazz club and 
perform and then announced that he was 

99
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:03,050
going to perform at another place.
He's like,

100
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,930
he's back while he's in between trials.
Wow.

101
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,820
So see,
that's the weird thing.

102
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,730
I always wondered like he was still 
selling tickets.

103
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,933
Yeah,
like people will still show up to see 

104
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:17,770
him,
but before no one before anyone knew for

105
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:18,604
sure what was going on.
There was a couple of accusations and 

106
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:21,760
everybody was like,
what is this?

107
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,110
Like,
what is this really?

108
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,720
Is this real?
Is this someone doing a shake down?

109
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,733
And then they started the.
Just the fucking tsunami of accusation 

110
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:30,904
started piling in,
which is really incredible when you 

111
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:34,960
think about it,
how many years that guy was doing that.

112
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,410
It's unbelievable how he could get away 
with that for so long and terrifying and

113
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:42,304
then something and then now it's like 
you just go on a bad date and year you 

114
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,800
get in trouble.
Like Aziz Ansari.

115
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,810
Yes.
Yeah.

116
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,070
Now,
well it's the pendulum swings,

117
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,640
you know,
I think it's,

118
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,533
it's,
it's kind of open season on men right 

119
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:58,430
now and it'll swing back around and it 
will be normal again and you know,

120
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,420
it makes sense.
You know,

121
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,920
you,
you,

122
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,110
there's so many of these accusations 
that happened.

123
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,303
You know,
after awhile they pile up and then 

124
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:05,974
there's this like anti male resentment 
and then it'll swing back and it'll 

125
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,360
normalize and people were sort of 
reacting theses thing and they say,

126
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:14,194
well that went a little too far.
And then the woman who was in charge of 

127
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,840
the California woman who was a big me to
support her,

128
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:21,790
she got busted and you see that?

129
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,780
Oh No.
Yeah.

130
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,380
She was grabbing some dude's Dick,
his ass.

131
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:28,120
And she was drunk and she's just a 
congresswoman.

132
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,470
No kidding.
Yeah.

133
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,710
Yeah.
You ever had.

134
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,100
I've ever grilled do that too.
Yeah.

135
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,420
I've been grabbed,
you know,

136
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:38,290
like bill burr said this famously in was
100 percent correct.

137
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,800
It's after shows drunk women in their 
forties.

138
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,873
They get a little liquored up,
they get crazy and they just get a 

139
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,290
little grabby.
They grabbed that ass,

140
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,360
they'll go for it.
And you know,

141
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,560
uh.
Did you,

142
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,980
did you feel violated?
No,

143
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,380
it's anybody who says it's not different
for men is just a liar.

144
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,273
It's not physically scary.
It's like if my daughter comes and 

145
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,740
punches me and kicks me,
you know,

146
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,780
like she'll do that for fun.
Just as a joke.

147
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,210
It's not threatening.
Right?

148
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,800
It's fun.
It's silly.

149
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,690
But if you did it,
I'd be like,

150
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:13,040
Hey man,
I'm fucking hit me.

151
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,930
Like a man hits you.
It's different.

152
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:18,080
Like if a man is trying to grab a 
woman's ass,

153
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:20,780
you're talking about someone larger,
grabbing someone smaller.

154
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,760
It's scary.
It's dangerous.

155
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:27,350
The real threat of rape is actually know
40 year old lady's gonna rape me.

156
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,053
You know,
it's not going to happen unless I want 

157
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:31,400
her to.
It's just not.

158
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:32,234
It's not going to go down that way.
They're really sick to be something 

159
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,810
really wrong with me.

160
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,253
Well,
there was this guy and see this how I 

161
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:42,144
like remembering jokes.
I haven't seen this guy probably tell 

162
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:44,454
jokes for 25 years.
His name is Paul Kelly and it was right 

163
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:48,084
in the,
in the eighties or at the end of the 

164
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:52,680
eighties when when women were in the 
workforce and that was like one day at a

165
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:53,514
time.
Remember that show was all about women 

166
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,670
and so things were weird in the 
workplace.

167
00:06:56,671 --> 00:06:59,430
Men didn't know how to talk to women and
how to act,

168
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:00,120
and then they would go,
oh,

169
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,160
she's just like one of the guys remember
that.

170
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:04,800
They would say that that was the highest
compliment you could give a woman.

171
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,330
She's like,
one of the guys,

172
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:09,720
we don't have to act weird around her 
and this Guy Paul Kelly,

173
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,420
that's when people started talking about
sexual harassment and he said,

174
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,550
see men,
we don't understand what that is.

175
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,080
It's like a.
wait a minute.

176
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:16,850
You mean you're,
you're,

177
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,310
you're gonna Touch my dick while I type 
and I get insurance,

178
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,490
we say that,
but my friend Tj,

179
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:28,560
do you know the amazing atheist?
Do you know who he is?

180
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,580
Oh,
I do know who he is.

181
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:31,260
I've seen his show woke up,
but I'm

182
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,740
to a very funny guy.
Yeah.

183
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,170
He told me and he's kind of an 
introvert.

184
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:36,850
He told me that he was working in an 
office,

185
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:37,684
wants in a woman who was his boss was 
sexually harassing him and it was 

186
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,584
completely unwanted and she would grab 
them and he would lock up or freeze and 

187
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:46,900
be uncomfortable and,
and it was gross.

188
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,770
You know,
he said it was.

189
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,240
He was real,
but he's a big guy.

190
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:51,430
I mean,
he wasn't physically in danger.

191
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm sure it felt super uncomfortable,
but it's always going to be a notch.

192
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,150
Several notches less scary.
Well,

193
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,220
because she can't take out her dick and 
stick it in you.

194
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,970
There you go.
That's a big difference.

195
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,093
The thing is the violation.
That's like the fact that someone could 

196
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,970
physically hold you against your will 
and denigrate menu.

197
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,130
Take.
Yeah,

198
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,030
get into your body.
Yes.

199
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,200
Inside,
inside of you,

200
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,600
like a woman literally can't do that.
She can engulf you.

201
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,050
That,
that could be scary.

202
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,790
So when engulfing you,
Jesus just doesn't seem as scary though.

203
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,260
Just the same violation.

204
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,770
What happened officer?
Well,

205
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:29,210
uh,
he said he wasn't gulped.

206
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,850
He uh,
engulfed my dick with his ass.

207
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:37,180
He just took it over.
Just tell you Weinstein joke.

208
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,043
Just tell it.
No,

209
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,400
it will be on.
I'm,

210
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,730
I'm recording in April.
So it's close.

211
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,020
We're only two months.
So what have you done that rustling joke

212
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,390
on a special.
But now that's all.

213
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,090
All this stuff's new.
It's all this stuff is from my,

214
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,360
from my last special,
which was last year to now.

215
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,181
Well,
you know,

216
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:54,940
I have been.
What it,

217
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,823
what makes,
I think that sets stick in my mind also 

218
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:59,550
is that it made me jealous,
right?

219
00:08:59,551 --> 00:08:59,941
Like,
you know,

220
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:01,170
when you,
I don't know if you get Jello,

221
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:03,880
I still get jealous when I see someone 
doing something better than me.

222
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,850
I want to do it.
And I'm like,

223
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:07,700
God damn it.
Uh,

224
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,543
it made me want to get out and calm 
because I haven't been doing comedy as 

225
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:11,731
much.
And you know,

226
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:13,830
it's like a muscle.
I think Jerry Seinfeld said,

227
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:16,620
if I don't do comedy for about four 
days,

228
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:18,660
the uh,
I notice a difference.

229
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:21,150
And if I don't do comedy for five days,
they can notice.

230
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,300
So I haven't been since I started my 
youtube show,

231
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,900
it's a,
I haven't been to a standup as much as I

232
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,880
should and I stopped touring like I 
should and uh,

233
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,620
and I miss it.

234
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,360
I want to do another special.
And watching.

235
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,780
And that night of comedy at the comedy 
store made me go,

236
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:37,614
God damn it,
I gotta get out here and stuck at my 

237
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,513
desk.
The highest compliment you could pay a 

238
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,080
comic.
God dammit.

239
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,370
It was like that many times,
you know,

240
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,930
that feeling of just being inspired,
just wanna go home and right.

241
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,070
Yeah.
And I was,

242
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,390
you know,
I mean my son went fine,

243
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,750
but it wasn't a.
I'm not on my game right now.

244
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,790
Right now I have to really start working
it again,

245
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,700
which I have started and I'm going out 
and it's,

246
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:00,780
uh,
it's my,

247
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,733
I forgot.
It's like this is all I ever wanted to 

248
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:03,474
do in my life.
Was standup comedy and like being a 

249
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:08,540
standup comic to me was like being 
really Yoda in goodfellows,

250
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,001
like,
you know,

251
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:11,520
I didn't wait in line,
I fucking wanted something.

252
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,900
I took it.
I fucking follow rules or listen to your

253
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:17,640
bullshit.
I fucking do what I want.

254
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:20,520
I say what I want and they pay me for it
and that's,

255
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:23,080
I just fucking love that shit.
And uh,

256
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,443
in that.
And then I started doing the youtube 

257
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:27,234
show and it becomes a job for me and 
it's a grind in a sense and doing 

258
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,223
comedy.
I so miss sleeping till noon and then 

259
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:37,260
getting up,
working out,

260
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,870
having all you had to do is figure out 
who am I going to have lunch with today.

261
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:42,400
That was my big decision.
Who am I going to have lunch with?

262
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,130
Then I go home after the lunch,
I have a nap,

263
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:45,400
then I go out and do a show.
It's fun.

264
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,900
It was the greatest life in the world.
Why did I fuck it up?

265
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,140
But you must enjoy doing your youtube 
show too.

266
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:57,170
I do because it helps me to discover who
I am more because as a standup,

267
00:10:58,921 --> 00:10:59,660
I,
um,

268
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,493
I was like,
Bill Hicks was my favorite guy when I 

269
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:02,514
saw bill Hicks in Chicago almost quit 
because I was in comedy about three or 

270
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:08,340
four years.
And I was like,

271
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,050
I fucking know what I'm doing,
you know,

272
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,970
before I got on stage,
I'd be like,

273
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,260
wait till they get a load of me,
you know,

274
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:14,100
I was like,
that guy,

275
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:16,380
oh,
the fucking baddest ass in Chicago.

276
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,870
And then everybody's talking about this 
guy,

277
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:19,710
Bill Hicks.
Right.

278
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:20,201
And I was like,
oh,

279
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:21,034
I'll have to check this guy out.
So I sat down and he starts to set and 

280
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,124
about two minutes in I started drinking 
and then about five minutes and I 

281
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:32,940
started drinking more and about 10 
minutes.

282
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:37,200
And I was convinced I was going to quit 
comedy because my whole life,

283
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,543
you know,
I always thought like George Carlin was 

284
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,370
my hero and I was like,
you know,

285
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:43,500
if I do everything right,
uh,

286
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,800
I could maybe be like George Carlin for 
one special.

287
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,200
Like maybe if I get everything right and
I really work at.

288
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,350
And I saw Bill Hicks and I knew that it 
wasn't,

289
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:56,450
I was always going to be competing for 
second place and so when he died it made

290
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:57,400
me feel a lot better.
I was like,

291
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:02,401
Oh fuck,
I'm with the saddest thing.

292
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,630
When he died,
of course he was my hero.

293
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:06,220
And um,
you know,

294
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:09,100
I didn't really know him.
I knew him tangentially and it was weird

295
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:12,010
to feel that kind of sadness for someone
who you don't know personally.

296
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,280
And um,
so that was a big deal to me.

297
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:18,250
Watching Bill Hicks had totally changed 
my life and I tried to be like him,

298
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:20,140
of course,
like an idiot.

299
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:22,870
I tried to be like him in you can't 
write.

300
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:26,050
And uh,
and then one time I was dating this girl

301
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,540
and might be my wife,
I don't know who told me this,

302
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,374
but she said,
you don't look like you where you come 

303
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,680
from because I come from the south side 
of Chicago,

304
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,170
grew up poor 12 kids drinking powdered 
milk,

305
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,033
you know,
and having the Shit beat out of me from 

306
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:41,980
the fucking morning till night,
right?

307
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,110
Because I went to Catholic school,
tough neighborhood and my,

308
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,590
so,
uh,

309
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,573
and she's like,
you can't be angry like bill Hicks 

310
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:51,400
because you look like you come from 
privilege money and you're dressed well.

311
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:53,260
I always like to dress nice because I 
grew up poor.

312
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:55,470
I was wanting to be.
And uh,

313
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,720
so that's when I had to like pull back 
on the anger on stage.

314
00:12:58,721 --> 00:12:59,554
And I was like,
if you watch my specials on comedy 

315
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:02,620
central,
I'm very nice.

316
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,950
And uh,
doing the youtube show is what,

317
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:10,030
let me connect with my anger,
which is always what drives me.

318
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,020
That's interesting.
That is what has connected with people.

319
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,970
And that's when I really started selling
tickets and my everything,

320
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,833
you know,
everything I wanted to get from comedy 

321
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:26,230
in a sense I got from this youtube show,
so now I can go wherever I want and do a

322
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:28,090
show and my fans will show up.

323
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,190
It's the greatest thing that ever 
happened in my life.

324
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,490
You're very good on your youtube show 
and you're also very fair.

325
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,383
You know,
one of the things that I really like 

326
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:36,610
about your shows you,
you are,

327
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,503
you're obviously a left leaning guy,
but you very balanced in your criticism 

328
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:44,730
of the left and you criticism of 
criticism of the left and well,

329
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,290
if you have to lie to make your point,
you don't have a good point.

330
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,153
I agree with you a thousand percent.
It's such an important thing that's 

331
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:52,090
being missed today.
Yeah.

332
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,590
And I don't know that.
And I don't know.

333
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,570
I've gone back and forth on issues.
Everybody.

334
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:58,240
I couldn't be allowed to go back and 
forth on issues,

335
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,800
you know.
Um,

336
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,520
I was,
uh,

337
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,240
I was against gun control.
I was for gun control than I was against

338
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:05,080
it again.
I mean,

339
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:06,130
you know,
uh,

340
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,550
so,
um,

341
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,720
the thing that people give me a lot of 
heart I get,

342
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,950
I get more of a hard time from people 
who consider themselves on the left than

343
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:17,170
people who consider themselves on the 
right today.

344
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,030
Today.
This is a new thing though.

345
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:21,070
It's the new thing in the last decade,
right?

346
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,040
It's because it'd be less than a decade.
Well,

347
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,850
to me it sends it,
it's,

348
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,190
it really started with Bill Clinton in 
92,

349
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:28,024
but it didn't get really ramped up until
Barack Obama in 2010 when it was clear 

350
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,113
that Barack Obama was a neo liberal 
corporatist who was going to do the 

351
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:40,810
bidding of the war machine and Wall 
Street and big Pharma,

352
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:44,440
which is why when the Democrats got 
control of government,

353
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,450
they had the presidency,
the Senate filibuster proof Senate for a

354
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,010
few months and they had the congress and
the house and

355
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,320
they didn't pass single payer or even a 
public option.

356
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:55,154
What did we get?
We got a right wing healthcare plan 

357
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:57,464
anyway,
which is a giveaway to the Pharma and 

358
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:01,600
health insurance companies that left out
$28,

359
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,940
million fucking paper and infuriated 
small business owners,

360
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:08,270
infuriated people that were,
that had a small practice.

361
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,393
There were doctors and you know,
and all sorts sorts of people that are 

362
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,620
better than what we had.
It was a bad solution.

363
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:16,454
It wasn't a solution.
What it was was a solution for the 

364
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,320
pharmaceutical companies and the health 
insurance company.

365
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,160
That was it better than what we had way.
Well,

366
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,330
because you before there was preexisting
conditions and you couldn't get covered,

367
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:27,164
so then it was supposed to.
So now you can always get coverage and 

368
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:29,883
that part was better.
You can get covered even if you had an 

369
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:33,590
issue.
Right?

370
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,180
Right.
So then you could go and you could go on

371
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:36,500
an exchange and stuff like that.

372
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,950
I didn't ever had to do that.
I always got through my wife's employer.

373
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,050
I'd always had my health insurance.
Right.

374
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:42,884
And by the way,
having health insurance is doesn't 

375
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,410
really mean that much.
I got really sick until you were talking

376
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:50,390
about this before,
but that's a different thing,

377
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:51,640
but I got a,
had a,

378
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,683
a,
an illness that they couldn't diagnose 

379
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,630
for a few years and it almost killed me.
Right.

380
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,523
And it wasn't,
it was called hypophosphatemic 

381
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:02,270
Osteomalacia and it'll be on late night 
TV.

382
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,720
One of those commercials.
Do you have Osceola?

383
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,440
Trisha was side effects.
Side effects include death.

384
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,833
I,
uh,

385
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,500
what is it a,
it's a,

386
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,560
it's a bone disease.
So my bones were admitting to the bottom

387
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:22,670
line is my bones were having a bone 
disintegration woe.

388
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,470
So yeah,
I used to be much taller.

389
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,361
I know.
That sounds funny,

390
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,230
right?
Has actually true.

391
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:29,000
Is that true?
When we met I was taller than you.

392
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,270
Get the fuck out of here.
I'm.

393
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,790
How tall were you?
I was around five.

394
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,560
10 and you'd shrank to five?
Eight.

395
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm a,
I'm a little,

396
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,140
little under five.
Eight.

397
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,150
Wow,
that's crazy.

398
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:39,680
Yeah.
So,

399
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:40,820
um,
I know.

400
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,713
Right.
And when that happened I was going to 

401
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:46,230
kill myself trying to stretch yourself 
out.

402
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,620
One of those things.
They use the medieval torture devices.

403
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,270
So I'm one of those guys who,
if I want something,

404
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:59,090
no matter what price I have to pay 
physical,

405
00:16:59,091 --> 00:16:59,924
whatever,
I'll pay it and I'll do and I'll get 

406
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:02,330
that thing I want,
right?

407
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,230
Like,
I'll get it.

408
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,750
But this book,
can you mind elaborating on this thing?

409
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:06,430
Yeah.
So,

410
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,360
so I couldn't fix it by stretching.
I couldn't.

411
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,760
It makes it,
it's just joking about that.

412
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:11,594
But,
but,

413
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,463
so what does it do to your.
It's making your bones shrink so it 

414
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:18,230
gives you osteoporosis.
And then my bones got hollow,

415
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:20,570
like a Old Lady.
And then,

416
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,380
uh,
my spine collapsed when I stepped off.

417
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,460
I stepped off a curb and too hard and 
they,

418
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,810
they,
they didn't know what it was.

419
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,940
I like talking about too much,
but uh,

420
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:30,590
they told me all different kinds of 
things.

421
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,580
Oh,
what's your muscles?

422
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:33,440
It's their nerves.
That shit in your head.

423
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:34,350
It's in this.
And,

424
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,713
and um,
I was limping for a few years when 

425
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:38,360
people were always like,
how are you doing?

426
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:38,811
I'm like,
oh,

427
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:40,490
I'll be all right.
And uh,

428
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:41,324
you know,
because no one likes to hear about 

429
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:43,460
anybody else.
And so,

430
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:44,930
um,
and then now when that happened,

431
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,661
they were like,
oh no,

432
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:46,790
what's your bones?
I was like,

433
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:50,010
you motherfuckers so everybody me that 
you should go.

434
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,843
So I started going to bone doctors and 
everybody told me I should go see this 

435
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:54,270
guy,
Dr Charles Sharpe.

436
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,840
And I called him and he was expensive 
and he didn't take insurance.

437
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,220
And so I was like,
well,

438
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:01,800
I'll go to someone he trained so I will 
go to someone who trained.

439
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:04,560
I wouldn't get any better.
After six months I go to someone else,

440
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:05,730
he trained,
he wouldn't get any better.

441
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,680
So if I was just about to die and uh,
I went to him to see him.

442
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:11,514
I like,
I was going to pay the money and go see 

443
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:14,070
him.
And uh,

444
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,890
he,
he figured out what it was like that.

445
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,390
And he says to me,
he goes,

446
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:21,000
you know,
no one in the nowhere you go,

447
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,590
no one's going to know where,
what this is.

448
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,011
I go,
yeah,

449
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:25,170
I know I've already been everywhere.
And he said,

450
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,300
I only saw this once before in 1968.

451
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,360
And he says,
and you haven't.

452
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,011
Yeah,
yeah.

453
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,720
So then any causes it,
uh,

454
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,830
it was just a,
my,

455
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,420
my own,
they didn't know at the time,

456
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,913
he thought I was a tumor,
but they fit since figured out it was 

457
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:44,150
just my own bones leaching of hormone 
that makes your body a leach,

458
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,160
the chemicals that I need to make bone.
So anyway,

459
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:48,450
this is boring,
but no,

460
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:50,040
it's not boring at all.
So,

461
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,650
uh,
he fixed me and I started to fix you.

462
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,350
He just diagnosed me what was wrong and 
what I needed.

463
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,480
And so I need to take supplements,
right?

464
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,790
Uh,
for my bones to make bone,

465
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,624
like some people take calcium.
So I take this thing called phosphorous 

466
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,430
because phosphorous and calcium and 
vitamin D to make bone,

467
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,750
right.
So,

468
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,110
um,
that we did that and it was amazingly,

469
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:10,944
you know,
he's just an amazing doctor and he's 

470
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:14,260
very right wing,
uh,

471
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,660
as far as I can tell,
right?

472
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,070
We,
he,

473
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,880
he doesn't like to talk politics,
but uh,

474
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,793
it comes up and uh,
he was in the military and all this 

475
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:25,500
stuff and he's just a great guy.
I just love him.

476
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:29,490
He's so smart.
He's so smart and he fixed me,

477
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:31,590
so getting back to what I was going to 
kill myself.

478
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,280
So when I stepped off the curb and I 
shrunk and shrunk even more,

479
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,750
they did an operation that gave me about
an inch back.

480
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,250
I was even shorter.
Right.

481
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:42,390
So I'm like,
holy fuck.

482
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,070
I'm like,
this is,

483
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,710
this is like I wanted to kill me.
I was literally going to kill myself.

484
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,573
What was the operation they did?
They had to put some high four slash 

485
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,220
steam,
so bar or something like that.

486
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,690
They collapse,
they puff it up and then they stick some

487
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:55,990
in it.
Oh Jesus.

488
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,250
But I saw I was serious.

489
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,080
I was like,
I cried one day.

490
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,250
I couldn't stop.
I didn't,

491
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:07,270
I didn't know how to stop and my eyes 
puffed up like I couldn't see almost and

492
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:08,334
I was going to do it.
I was like,

493
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,990
I'll just kill myself.
And,

494
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,093
and the only thing that kept me from not
killing myself was my manager called me 

495
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:16,681
and he said,
hey,

496
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:17,514
I go,
you got that hour special on comedy 

497
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:23,430
central and I have a central saved your 
life.

498
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,510
I was like,
what?

499
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,540
Talk about that was the best of times.
It was the worst at times.

500
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,550
Wow.
I could not believe I'm like,

501
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:30,384
what?
And then I just knew I had to do this 

502
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:32,784
special because I couldn't let all those
motherfuckers who said I w I shouldn't 

503
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:35,964
move to La and be a coach.
I couldn't let them when it was about 

504
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:40,500
that,
it was about I'm going to show everybody

505
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:44,310
who doubted me and said I was crazy and 
I'm going to show them.

506
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:47,280
I'm going to do this God damn special.
It's going to be fucking awesome.

507
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,160
And

508
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,080
then I kill myself,
Christchurch and by the time.

509
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,450
So I had to get this.
Anyway,

510
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,530
long stories.
Um,

511
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,940
I had to get this operation in my leg.
It was the Bo Jackson surgery.

512
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,610
You've got a hip replacement.
It was a,

513
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,440
the thigh bone was dead,
dead,

514
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,610
dying.
And uh,

515
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,770
I went to,
my doctor sends me this other doctor who

516
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:11,604
vented the operation at USC and I walk 
into the office just like my doctor 

517
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:17,710
predicted.
He's looking at my chart and he looks up

518
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,050
and he goes,
what?

519
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,660
I've only seen this in books,
meaning what?

520
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:26,020
I have and I was like,
that's what Dr Sharp said,

521
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,630
and so he was going to give me this 
operation.

522
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:29,464
He goes,
we're going to take this bone out from 

523
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:31,144
your chin,
we're going to put it in there and then 

524
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:35,920
you can't step on that foot for six 
months straight.

525
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,053
And I said,
I have a,

526
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,290
I have our special.

527
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,570
I'm taping an eight months.
I go,

528
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:41,380
so,
uh,

529
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,090
I can't do this operation.
He goes,

530
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:43,924
well,
your thigh could just snap at any 

531
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:46,030
moment.
And I go,

532
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:48,760
I guess that's the chance I got to take.
Holy Shit.

533
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:51,160
If I can't do this special,
I'm going to kill myself anyway.

534
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,060
Yeah,
give a fuck.

535
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,620
Right.
So,

536
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,890
uh,
by the time we got to do the special,

537
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:57,724
eight months later,
Dr Sharp's treatment had kicked in and 

538
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:02,170
they didn't know it was going to fix it,
but it fixed it.

539
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,300
They fixed it.
Holy Shit.

540
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,090
You could've got that crazy operation 
for nothing.

541
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,960
Fuck man.
So treatment is just supplements.

542
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:11,771
Yeah,
yeah,

543
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:14,230
yeah.
And you take that to this day,

544
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,133
every day,
every time I eat I have to take to 

545
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,250
foster.
Did you alter your diet?

546
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,451
Uh,
no,

547
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:20,284
he just,
he tells me to make sure I eat meat 

548
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,380
because I need to,
whatever it's in it.

549
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,080
I need the stuff.
Yeah,

550
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,620
whatever,
whatever the good stuff is,

551
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,830
he'll look at me like he goes,
you're from Chicago,

552
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:30,661
right?
And I go,

553
00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:32,290
yeah,
go eat meat like that.

554
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,550
Not One of those fucking plenty.
You're not one of those,

555
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:37,384
are you right.
And sad that I'm turning into one of 

556
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:41,410
those now.
Goddamn it.

557
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,760
What plant?
Eating asshole.

558
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,390
Well,
I'll stop this fucking video about cows.

559
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,490
I haven't seen those two work.
They know.

560
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,413
No,
not those.

561
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,640
So in the,
I don't know,

562
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,230
Norway or Denmark,
I don't know where.

563
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:57,670
Somewhere over there they have a law 
that you have to let the cows out of the

564
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:00,550
barn in the spring on this by this one 
day.

565
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,473
Oh,
you're talking about the one with the 

566
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:04,210
cow jumps out.
So it's bouncing around like a dog.

567
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,093
Yeah.
Yeah.

568
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,810
So they all come out and they start 
jumping around like dogs,

569
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,663
you know.

570
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,640
And I was like,
oh my God,

571
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,790
I couldn't eat my dog,
you know?

572
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,260
And that's,
that was the first like,

573
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,133
Gigi.
She's like,

574
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,450
oh Jesus,
and then I accidentally saw this thing,

575
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,730
this video about a pig and I can't eat 
pigs anymore.

576
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,480
Forks.
I can't and I'm that close to not eating

577
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:28,510
meat,
but I eat a lot of pasta.

578
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:29,170
You know,
I like to.

579
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,960
I like to cook,
but your doctor said,

580
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,570
but it's terrible for you.
You've got no right to wheat pasta.

581
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,130
Oh,
that's not any better.

582
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:37,150
It's not better.
No,

583
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,590
no.
It's terrible for you.

584
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,690
Whole Wheat Pasta is the same amount of 
gluten in it.

585
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:42,760
It's the same amount of sugars in it.
It's,

586
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,130
it's maybe slightly better than refined 
pasta.

587
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,830
Like wheat bread is slightly better than
white bread,

588
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:53,450
but it's all bullshit.
It's all just filler like nutrients,

589
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,880
but seven grain bread is better than 
horse shit.

590
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,290
Man.
Bread is horseshit.

591
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,260
It's not good for you.
Don't do this to me it just is.

592
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:03,380
Wheat is just not a good food.
It's a good filler.

593
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,550
I mean,
if you're starving,

594
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:05,630
you know,
keep you alive.

595
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,040
I mean,
that's literally what are.

596
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:12,041
They invented it for the ground up wheat
and figured out a way to cook it and the

597
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:14,420
wheat that we're eating today is not 
heirloom wheat.

598
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,283
It's all wheat that's been adjusted and 
genetically modified so that it has 

599
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:21,290
higher yield and smaller areas like,
um,

600
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,390
there's a documentary called what's with
wheat.

601
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:24,720
It's really fascinating.
Really?

602
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,633
Yeah,
and they go over the details of what 

603
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:27,344
happened with wheat,
but at somewhere around the early 19th 

604
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:32,990
century or 20th century rather than 
early 19 hundreds,

605
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:33,824
they started altering wheat and they did
it so that they can get higher yield in 

606
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:37,904
a smaller area,
but by doing that you increase the 

607
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,710
amount of complex glutens and the weed.

608
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,543
It makes it much more difficult for 
people to digest and then that's where 

609
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,400
you see like the elevation of all these 
gluten sensitivity issues and people are

610
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:49,671
like,
wow,

611
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:51,230
I was a kid.
There was no gluten sensitivity.

612
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,060
First of all,
nobody knew what the fuck happened.

613
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:54,830
He got fat.
He had a heart attack and die.

614
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,750
They really didn't know.
They didn't.

615
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:59,780
They were much less aware of why people 
are fat,

616
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:00,614
but sugar's wheat.
Those are two of the biggest problems 

617
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,210
hitting.
Yeah,

618
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,043
it's terrible for you.
So when I went to this Chinese medicine 

619
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,690
doctor,
um,

620
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,773
uh,
it was back when I was feeling sick and 

621
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,573
um,
so I went to somebody recommended you 

622
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:16,820
should go to this Chinese man.
I'm like,

623
00:25:16,821 --> 00:25:20,180
I'll try whatever.
So what he did was he changed my diet,

624
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,730
so he got,
got me off of white sugar,

625
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,610
dairy,
even brown sugar is terrible for you and

626
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:26,060
I'm sure.

627
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,950
Sure.
And,

628
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,480
and,
and carbs basically.

629
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,780
And um,
he told me not to drink soda and I said,

630
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,381
well,
I drink diet.

631
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:35,930
He goes,
that's worse because of the chemicals in

632
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:37,400
it.
And um,

633
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,960
so I was like,
Holy Shit.

634
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,280
I was like,
okay.

635
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:41,114
So then he sells he,
these herbs for 800 bucks a month 

636
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:44,414
supply.
So I realized that's all I ate when I 

637
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:47,810
got out of his office.
I like,

638
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:51,890
every time I eat I'm eating white flour,
meeting bread or a pizza or a pasta or a

639
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:54,230
cheese or everything.
Everything he told me not to eat,

640
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:55,820
that's all I ate.
So I was like,

641
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,260
they go.
I remember my girlfriend said,

642
00:25:57,261 --> 00:26:00,980
how long are you going to do this?
I go at least for a month because that's

643
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:03,050
how much these herbs are and the $800 
bucks I don't want.

644
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,700
So by the.
By Day three I was leaping out of bed.

645
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,770
I could not get over how much energy I 
had.

646
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,633
Yeah.
That's because you don't have that big 

647
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,330
insulin crash when you're eating all 
that sugar and all that bread.

648
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,193
Your body's just fighting that shit off 
all the time trying to process it and 

649
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:22,580
then there's this big crash boom.
And then you have to take a nap.

650
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,443
What do you eat?
I eat mostly meat and Aviva cahtos and 

651
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:29,920
healthy fats and vegetables,
but I.

652
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,180
I hunt so I.
everything I eat is wild,

653
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,433
so when I'm eating meat,
I'm eating elk or deer or something 

654
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:36,644
along those lines.
You don't feel bad when you see the 

655
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:39,251
deer,
you just.

656
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:41,870
Yet?
I do feel a sense of loss,

657
00:26:41,871 --> 00:26:44,190
but I do also know that there's a wild 
animal

658
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,530
that had no idea what was going on until
an arrow hit it.

659
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,543
It's not like something that's living in
some pen and being tortured and 

660
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,000
genetically modified and filled with 
antibiotics and hormones.

661
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,660
It's a wild animal and their life 
expectancy is very short.

662
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,250
They get taken out by bears and wolves 
and coyotes and Pumas.

663
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,080
They don't.
They're not making it.

664
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,660
None of them are making zero,
zero percent.

665
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,300
They're starving to death.
They're freezing to death.

666
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,950
What you're doing is just dipping your 
foot in the wild world.

667
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,650
You are taking part in the cycle of 
life,

668
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,440
so your against factory farming and 
hundred percent.

669
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:20,274
That's why I became a hunter.
I was going either going to become a 

670
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:24,870
vegetarian or I was going to hunt.
Those are my two options.

671
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:25,704
I had to figure out what I was going to 
do and I experimented with vegetarian 

672
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:32,310
back when I was fighting to try to make 
a weight class and I didn't like it.

673
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,710
I just didn't feel good.
And then when I started eating meat,

674
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,553
I did it for like six months and then 
when I started eating meat I got way 

675
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:39,990
better.
Like instantly,

676
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,800
like instantly started gaining muscle 
instantly was fighting better,

677
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:46,950
instantly competed better.
And I moved up a weight class and that's

678
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:50,430
when I became my very best.
What you re class?

679
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:53,220
What did you fight at?
One 54 is when I moved up to.

680
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,350
I was trying to stay at 1:40 and this 
was.

681
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:58,290
I fought at 1:40 only for a year when I 
was 18.

682
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,303
I just couldn't do it

683
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,183
now.
Did you bring your power with Easyjet 

684
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,350
Joe when you went up to 1:54 yesterday.
Whilst I was 18 I was still growing.

685
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,360
Still Thick.
And that's young.

686
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,343
Yeah.
Okay.

687
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,610
So it was artificially keeping my body 
very,

688
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:12,050
very thin.
That was a very lean.

689
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,320
But my point is that I knew that when I 
watched too many of those videos,

690
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:18,523
factory farming videos,
factory farming should be mean fuck 

691
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,280
insider trading and all the other 
problems that we have in the world.

692
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:26,520
That's all terrible stuff,
right?

693
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:30,380
Terrible stuff.
Factory farming is a goddamn crime.

694
00:28:30,381 --> 00:28:34,970
It's a horrible crime against life.
And the fact that we just do it and then

695
00:28:34,971 --> 00:28:36,950
we have ag gag laws.
Yes.

696
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,280
That's what's.
That's what they're insane.

697
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,260
Yeah.
Laws are fucking criminal.

698
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,180
They're insane.
It's

699
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,320
not America.
It's not the America I thought about.

700
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,160
I thought you always supposed to have a 
free press.

701
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:49,470
That's the equalizer.
That's what's different about us.

702
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:51,850
And now they gag the press.
You can't talk about craft.

703
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,640
Well,
they could.

704
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,510
They could sue you.
They could put you in jail if you feel.

705
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,590
If you have tortured animal criminal,
if you film a crime.

706
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,453
Right?
Exactly.

707
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,680
So they've made a.
So what's,

708
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,250
there's some famous saying,
well you know,

709
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,270
what is exposing a crime is a crime.
You're ruled by criminals.

710
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:08,910
I don't know if that's the quote,
but something like that.

711
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:09,410
So we,
we,

712
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,990
by the way we are being,
we're,

713
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,370
we're living in a this,
a lawless time,

714
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,280
right?
So the old law only applies to the poor.

715
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,130
It does not apply to a war.
Criminals.

716
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,400
It doesn't apply to Wall Street.
It doesn't apply to anybody.

717
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,930
Giant corporations have figured out a 
way to skirt the law is money.

718
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,430
If you steal from rich people that they 
will get upset.

719
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:32,070
Like Bernie madoff stole from rich 
people.

720
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:33,390
That was wrong.
He fucked up.

721
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,313
But if you're,
if you're jamie diamond or a fear of 

722
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:40,140
Goldman Sachs and you steal from poor 
people are veterans or a lady,

723
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:41,010
that's fine.
That's fine.

724
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,160
That done.
You become secretary

725
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,430
of the treasury.
Steve Mnuchin with Mnuchin is

726
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,680
one of my favorite evil characters of 
the 21st century.

727
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,633
When you see him with his wife and his 
wife has gloves on and they're holding 

728
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:53,344
the money and he's smiling and when she 
fucking tags like Gucci and cardiac and 

729
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:01,660
all these different like big time 
companies and our instagram posts,

730
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:03,880
when she stepping off of a fucking 
private jet,

731
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,680
like,
Holy Shit,

732
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:06,820
look at that picture.
I love,

733
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,790
first of all,
the fact that she would fuck him.

734
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,100
That's a crime.
That woman is a thief.

735
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,960
That's the power of money.
Yeah.

736
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,240
I mean,
but it's also prostitution.

737
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,560
That's.
That's a crime.

738
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,810
You don't think she's hot?
No,

739
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,610
I do not.
I'm doing.

740
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,850
I'm going to be honest with you.
I think if you were there,

741
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:27,610
I'd say okay.
It's got a funny personalities.

742
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,080
Good guy.
She probably enjoys it.

743
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,290
You know,
it doesn't make any sense.

744
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,200
Well,
let me see.

745
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,033
Let me just say this,
there's now Steven Mnuchin is horrible 

746
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,450
and he should probably be in jail,
but guess what?

747
00:30:38,451 --> 00:30:39,710
He's not in jail because.
Why?

748
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,573
Because a Democrat didn't,
didn't prosecute him when she was 

749
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:43,670
supposed to.
That's Kamala Harris.

750
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,150
So she's corrupted by Wall Street too.
So you can point your finger at him.

751
00:30:47,151 --> 00:30:47,481
You're like,
well,

752
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:50,360
the reason why he's there is because of 
the Democratic party is corrupted.

753
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,463
That's why he's there.
And what did he do that he should have 

754
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,790
gone so well?
Kamala Harris is um,

755
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,030
so he ran one West Bank and they enter 
in,

756
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,953
investigated his bank and they found a 
thousand instances of criminality and 

757
00:31:03,471 --> 00:31:04,304
they said if we had thousands and 
thousands and anything less than a 

758
00:31:09,921 --> 00:31:11,930
million instances,
like what the fuck?

759
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:13,820
It's water under the bridge can be 
picky.

760
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,930
Yeah.
You got to break a few eggs.

761
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,643
So they said,
and if we investigated we would find a 

762
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,170
thousand more instances of criminality.
She said don't go.

763
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,100
That was that.
And she never had an answer for it.

764
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,473
So.
And now she's the darling of the 

765
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,120
corporate class.
The,

766
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:29,983
you know,
the same people who anointed Barack 

767
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,790
Obama and Bill Clinton are the same 
people who are annoying her.

768
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,770
So that's.
So that's the problem.

769
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:37,820
That's why I get so,
I mean,

770
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,740
if you,
Brock Obama's entire cabinet,

771
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,680
uh,
came from an email from Citi group,

772
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,543
okay?
So people trying to say that somehow 

773
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,123
corruption started on January 20th,
2017 are fooling themselves and that's 

774
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:53,220
what I'm fighting against on my.
All right.

775
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:53,320
And

776
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,880
you're one of the only people that are 
doing that.

777
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,900
You're one of the only people that are 
online that you,

778
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,773
you're not,
you're not obligated to shill for the 

779
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:03,940
left.
You're not,

780
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,790
you're not doing it,
but everybody else seems to be.

781
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,800
I don't mean to everybody else.
If you're one of the people that are not

782
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,430
like,
fuck you,

783
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,263
Joe Rogan does.
Is it just a handful of people who are 

784
00:32:11,571 --> 00:32:12,404
not just so few.
There's so few that are calling out 

785
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:18,260
people in the Democratic Party for what 
really is going on.

786
00:32:18,261 --> 00:32:23,140
Like I was infuriated when people that I
knew that I was friends with were trying

787
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,320
to tell me that,
that Hillary Clinton was a good choice.

788
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,240
That's the same choice.
I'm like,

789
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,820
look,
I don't know if she's murdered people,

790
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,400
but I know that I worried that she's 
murdered people.

791
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:34,803
That's a real.
I really wonder like this seth rich 

792
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:38,224
shit.
I know.

793
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,703
First of all

794
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,080
just lead.
You don't even need to go there.

795
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,630
You know,
there's so many other things,

796
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:44,464
so,
so many other things that we know for a 

797
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:47,210
fact.
The Clinton Foundation for instance,

798
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,830
so the Iraq war,
I'm old enough to remember one being for

799
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:54,530
the Iraq war was a disqualifier in a 
democratic primary.

800
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,340
I'm,
that's,

801
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,470
that's where I'm from.
That's why she lost a Bruck Obama,

802
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:01,640
the first God time she ran and all of a 
sudden we're supposed to now people like

803
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:03,170
joy behar says,
that was a long time ago.

804
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:04,004
Forget about it.
Why don't you go tell that to his 

805
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,730
soldiers,
to a mother who's got a dead soldier?

806
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,010
Why don't you go tell them out of the 
little girl just died an illegal war.

807
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,430
Why don't you go tell that to a couple 
hundred thousand Iraqis who are dead?

808
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,790
Get over.
It was a long time ago,

809
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:16,250
you.
Anyway,

810
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:18,070
so I remember that.
Uh,

811
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,000
also,
uh,

812
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,550
the Bill Clinton was no friend to the 
working man.

813
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,383
In fact,
he was this demise starting of the 

814
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:27,700
demise of this country.
So bill,

815
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,663
you know,
Ronald Reagan's scared the shit out of 

816
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:31,880
the Democrat so much they decided to 
become like them.

817
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:34,850
And so what Bill Clinton did was he got 
in bed with Wall Street,

818
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:37,940
the military industrial complex,
big Pharma health insurance,

819
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,660
and the Koch brothers.
He started a thing called the Democratic

820
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,493
Leadership Council with Al Gore.
They had executives from the Koch 

821
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,950
Brothers on the Democratic Leadership 
Council.

822
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,440
They completely turned their back on the
working man.

823
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,590
And what happens when you have two 
parties that are in bed with management,

824
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,200
you get Donald Trump,
and that's exactly what happened.

825
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,034
They gutted welfare at the same time.
They explored the prison population 

826
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:00,170
called black kids,
super predators at the same time,

827
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,004
they did Nafta and then they deregulated
Wall Street which crashed the economy 

828
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:06,830
within 10 years.
That's what Democrats did.

829
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:07,664
Democrats did shit that Ronald Reagan 
could only dream about and his wet 

830
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:11,510
dreams.

831
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,790
They couldn't pass Nafta.
George Bush couldn't pass.

832
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:17,560
Nafta took Bill Clinton to do it.
Bill Clinton gave the cover to the other

833
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:21,710
corporate democrats to go along with it,
so that was the beginning of the end for

834
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:23,360
the working class in America.
In fact,

835
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,194
now you know I wouldn't vote for Hillary
Clinton and that's why a lot of people 

836
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:29,210
on the left came after me and they still
do.

837
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,163
Well.
It was confusing to me that you were 

838
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:31,611
saying,
hey,

839
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,770
if you want to vote for a real 
progressive.

840
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,870
What about Jill Stein?
Yeah.

841
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,610
If you vote for a party boat,
here's a program.

842
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:39,200
You actually agree with the grand new 
deal,

843
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,070
right?
So.

844
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:41,250
And we know what it's like.
No,

845
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:42,710
that's what you're throwing away your 
vote.

846
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:45,020
Like how?
How will your throwing away your vote?

847
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,973
So we all know for a fact because of the
wikileaks emails that Hillary Clinton 

848
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,710
had a thing called the Pied Piper 
strategy,

849
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:54,950
which was she told her minions in the 
press,

850
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:56,540
please prop up Donald Trump.

851
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:57,643
Prop him up.
Why did she want Donald Trump to be 

852
00:34:59,061 --> 00:34:59,894
propped up?
Because you want it to run against 

853
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:01,454
Donald trump.
Because she knew that she was so 

854
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:04,634
repulsive to most of the country.
She needed someone who was more 

855
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:09,680
repulsive than hurt.
Turns out that was a bad calculation,

856
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,650
is terrible calculus,
so that's called the Pied Piper strategy

857
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:13,484
and everybody.
That's why the you turn on Chris Hayes 

858
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,913
and he would show donald trump's empty 
podium for an hour instead of a Bernie 

859
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,113
Sanders and then he wagged his finger at
people with no money and no power for 

860
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:25,580
not voting for a corporatist warmonger 
like Hillary Clinton who just.

861
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,623
Why?
Why do you think the people in Michigan 

862
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:28,994
wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton?
Maybe because she put half of them in 

863
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:31,154
fucking prison,
but because she passed Nafta and Barack 

864
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,380
Obama was trying to sell tpp at the top 
of his lungs at the same time was trying

865
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:38,190
to get people

866
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,800
to vote for her.
They know what the fuck was going on and

867
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:42,270
that's why half the country doesn't 
vote,

868
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,030
but you're going to wag their finger at 
the people who actually do vote,

869
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,930
who come out and vote their conscience 
and they don't fucking prop up evil.

870
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,853
You know what the voting for the lesser 
of two evils gets you donald fucking 

871
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,124
trump with is also a really sneaky thing
that happens where you have two parties 

872
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,630
and one of them you think of as this 
conservative warmongering party,

873
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:06,960
which automatically makes the other 
party the the enemy of that.

874
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,770
Yeah,
but they're not.

875
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,521
They're not.
Well,

876
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:10,250
we have two pro war parties and that's 
the point.

877
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,860
There's not an opposition party.
They oppose trump on the most ridiculous

878
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:14,694
bullshit.
They just voted for an extra 

879
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:18,060
$160,000,000,000 to go to the war 
machine.

880
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,770
One hundred 60 billion.
Let's remember.

881
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,870
Bernie Sanders wanted to pay for free 
college,

882
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:23,940
which was somewhere around $65,
million dollars.

883
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,490
So and everybody said he's fucking 
crazy.

884
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,580
How are you going to pay for that?
They just did that in a blink of an eye.

885
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,443
They passed $160,000,000,000 to a war 
machine that we don't have an enemy to 

886
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:33,991
fight.
You know,

887
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,630
Russia spending $65,000,000,000 a year 
on their military.

888
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,270
There are paper tiger.
We got no fucking enemies out there.

889
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:41,460
We have to keep inventing them.
And the last,

890
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,280
the last enemy they invented was isis.
Isis.

891
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:46,110
I don't know.
You were supposed to shit our pants over

892
00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:46,441
them,
Joe,

893
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:49,590
because they have kitchen knives.
They'll cut your head off with a kitchen

894
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:50,424
knife.
That's what I'm supposed to be afraid 

895
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:52,650
of.
What the fuck?

896
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:53,940
It's.
It's,

897
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:58,290
it's amazing how they can keep us scared
so they can keep perpetual war going.

898
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:01,170
This isn't Orwellian nightmare.
And the Democrats right now,

899
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:03,090
she'd be screaming about the Pentagon 
budget,

900
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,760
but they're not screaming about it 
because they're complicit.

901
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,373
They're in it.
And that's what's wrong with this 

902
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:10,770
country.
That's why we can't have nice things.

903
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,520
So when,
when they tell you that you were broken,

904
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:17,220
we can't afford stuff.
They don't mean we can't afford trillion

905
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,810
dollar war is trillion dollar bank 
bailout.

906
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:21,450
Billion dollar oil subsidies and prison 
construction.

907
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:22,284
That's not what they mean.
They mean we can't afford shit like 

908
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,553
healthcare or education or roads or 
bridges or firemen or libraries or 

909
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:29,250
anything that makes your fucking life 
better.

910
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,140
Because whenever they need bombs,
they got it.

911
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,640
Hey,
we're broke for social security.

912
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:33,870
We're booked for Medicare.
How?

913
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:34,681
Above for bombs.
Oh,

914
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:35,514
we got bond money,
we keep it running because we're not 

915
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:42,951
really in a war in the sense of like 
world war two or World War One,

916
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:43,974
we're in this weird war of.
It's like a calculated through all 

917
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:48,900
economic words,
so they're all.

918
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,753
So we went into Iraq for the,
for the oil Libya based because he 

919
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:57,180
wanted to go off the petrodollar,
but it is stunning how much funding this

920
00:37:57,181 --> 00:37:58,014
kind of war gets versus all the 
different social programs that we need 

921
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:01,050
in this country.

922
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,090
Yet infrastructure programs,
yes.

923
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:05,850
We and people always think like,
well how are you going to pay for that?

924
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:06,684
We don't have to spend any more money.
We can actually spend less and less 

925
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:11,630
money.
We don't have to spend $750,

926
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,500
million dollars a year on a military 
that's bloated.

927
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:15,270
We have thousand bases around the 
country,

928
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,133
around the world.
We don't even know how many bases there 

929
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:18,354
are because lots of them are secret.
So what do you say to the argument that 

930
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:23,340
we need them in order to stay safe?
It's not true.

931
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,020
That's the big argument,
right?

932
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,980
The big argument is this is the way we.
We've destroyed Isis because isis was on

933
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:30,820
their way to building up.
We invented this,

934
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,690
we invented al Qaeda,
and then we invented isis.

935
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:37,840
We certainly aided in their development,
their development,

936
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,733
and we then we directly funded them.
We don't know the whole Mujahideen 

937
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:45,700
story,
which was Osama bin Laden was our guy.

938
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,080
He's our guy.
He wasn't t Russian terror,

939
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,230
anti Russian freedom fighter is what 
they called Osama bin Laden and then all

940
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:54,730
of a sudden they didn't need them 
anymore.

941
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,833
So why?
And we're still in Afghanistan 17 years 

942
00:38:58,061 --> 00:38:58,960
later,
three more years.

943
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,230
That word gets a gold watch.
And what did they do?

944
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,190
I mean,
what,

945
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,220
what did they do to get us out of there?
I mean literally what is,

946
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,970
what is there is none.
There is no exit strategy.

947
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,283
Exit strategy,
there is no exit strategy from the 

948
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:13,294
Mideast.
In fact,

949
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,640
they just announced we're going to be 
permanently in Syria.

950
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,470
So.
And by the way,

951
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:20,080
the Syrian war is complete bullshit.
Those gas attacks.

952
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,020
Now I've been completely debunked.
I didn't believe him the first time.

953
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,430
What happened during those guests tax?
So what that's called a false flag.

954
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:31,270
So what happens is they wanted the 
United States to come in on their side,

955
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:32,830
the Obama side to overthrow him.

956
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:36,100
And uh,
so what they would do is they would do a

957
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:38,620
gas attack on their own people and then 
blame it on his side.

958
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:41,120
And then this has been proven be.
Yes,

959
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,310
they did it.
Yes.

960
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,450
And then,
uh,

961
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,410
and the first time was the night think 
2013 in Barack Obama wanted to bomb.

962
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,920
And uh,
and I knew it was bullshit then.

963
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,690
Do you remember when everybody freaked 
out about that?

964
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,960
Yes.
And then he didn't bomb them.

965
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,960
Remember he didn't get to bomb them 
because he was like,

966
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:57,040
fuck you.
Yes.

967
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:57,883
He goes,
let's put it to a vote in the congress 

968
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:01,240
and the people don't want war Joe.
So the people said,

969
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:02,074
fuck you.
And he goes like,

970
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,493
we're going to do it anyway.
Guess what they did it anyway they 

971
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:07,270
bought,
they dropped so many bombs on Syria.

972
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,820
They ran out of bumps.
That's a fact,

973
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,150
right?

974
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,370
So the air force was out of box.
Which year was this?

975
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,523
So was it 2015?
That dropped so many bombs in the 

976
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:17,350
Mideast.
They ran out of bombs.

977
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:18,790
That just a fucking fact.
Look,

978
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,210
if you buy all these bombs,
you've got to use those.

979
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,650
I mean,
what are you going to do with them?

980
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:24,803
They're just going to sit around.
And what if somebody accidentally sets 

981
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,424
one off,
whether an American soil and I don't 

982
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,550
want that.
You can't have that happen.

983
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,980
So.
And here's the weird thing that the left

984
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:33,814
is doing right now.
They're attacking Donald Trump from the 

985
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:38,050
right.
And what do I mean by that?

986
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,930
So when they want.
So they say,

987
00:40:40,931 --> 00:40:41,764
Donald trump is a Putin puppet.
And the only way you can prove you're 

988
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:48,070
not a Putin puppet is you've got a bomb.
Somebody you got to bomb Syria.

989
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,210
Remember that?
They were like,

990
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:50,044
oh,
he's president today because he bombed 

991
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:51,250
Syria.

992
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,070
Remember that fucking Brian Williamson 
was nothing in his pants.

993
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,250
All he bombed was airstrips.
So that's what they're saying.

994
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,263
So they go,
oh,

995
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,000
oh,
they bombed airstrips.

996
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,873
Oh you didn't,
you bombed the old planes and not the 

997
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:03,400
new plane.
So what that is,

998
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,353
you're attacking Donald Trump from the 
right because left people are supposed 

999
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:12,061
to be for detente and you're supposed to
be antiwar and anti and anti empire.

1000
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,130
Right?
So what new attack Donald trump going,

1001
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,480
oh,
he didn't really bomb them.

1002
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,373
You're attacking them from the right.
You're saying he should be more 

1003
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,890
militaristic,
which is fucked up.

1004
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,570
Well,
it supports the argument that everything

1005
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:23,381
is circular,
right?

1006
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:25,950
That as far right as you get,
as far left as you get,

1007
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,280
you really come to some sort of strange 
ideological point zero point.

1008
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,143
That can't be true,
but not in this instance because what's 

1009
00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:33,974
happening there is corporate right wing 
Democrats are attacking trump for not 

1010
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:38,954
being right enough.

1011
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,150
When you're talking about is where I'm 
at,

1012
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,013
where I'm antiwar.
And then there's also anti war anti 

1013
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,044
intervention as people on the right.
So a lot of people voted for Donald 

1014
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:48,194
trump because of that,
because he always said he was an anti 

1015
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,074
interventionists.
He's going to get us out of the Middle 

1016
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,233
East.
It was crazy to be there and bring our 

1017
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:55,424
boys home and all.
And that's why a lot of people did vote 

1018
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,420
for trump because of that.
And um,

1019
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,373
and that's why a lot of people said they
felt more comfortable voting for trump 

1020
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:03,794
because he was because hillary actually 
promised more war in Syria than he did 

1021
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:07,150
and we,
and,

1022
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,410
and that's turning out to be true,
uh,

1023
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,273
because she wanted a no fly zone,
which means we're going to shoot down a 

1024
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:13,910
Russian jet.
Are you fucking crazy?

1025
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:19,300
So I'm,
I'm on the,

1026
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,930
on the left antiwar.

1027
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,793
There's no antiwar movement in the 
country that's represented by a 

1028
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:27,410
political party right now.
Do you think that this right though,

1029
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,740
the way the left is attacking Donald 
Trump from the right,

1030
00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:31,574
as you say,
don't you think it's just because they 

1031
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:35,150
see an opening there to criticize and 
to,

1032
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,093
to point out his vulnerabilities,
what they're doing with this whole 

1033
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:40,454
Russian narrative?
Is the establishment not wanting to 

1034
00:42:43,191 --> 00:42:44,024
examine the system that gave us Donald 
Trump and so they want to distract you 

1035
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:48,770
with Russia until we get to the next 
election,

1036
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,940
then it's working.
Yes.

1037
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,303
That's a very good way of putting it.
Distract you from a system that's 

1038
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:54,674
archaic and outdated and it doesn't work
if people are not asking that question 

1039
00:42:58,761 --> 00:43:00,410
anymore.
Why did people vote for Donald Trump?

1040
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,244
In fact,
the only time they asked that they took 

1041
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:02,984
the shittiest answer was because racism 
really the same country that voted for 

1042
00:43:05,691 --> 00:43:06,770
Barack Obama twice.

1043
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,340
Somebody just doubled down on that the 
other day saying,

1044
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,220
are there racists?
Is Berg or they're racist.

1045
00:43:13,221 --> 00:43:14,630
Who voted for Donald Trump?
Yes,

1046
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:15,680
of course.
So what?

1047
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,010
It's Alonzo Bowden said it best.
He said,

1048
00:43:19,011 --> 00:43:22,340
not all trump supporters are racist,
but all racists are trump supporters.

1049
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,940
Fucking Alonzo.
Um,

1050
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,870
and,
and,

1051
00:43:29,871 --> 00:43:30,704
you know,
I went to a trump rally and it was 

1052
00:43:31,671 --> 00:43:35,930
disgusting and scary and it was all 
xenophobia and it was all race.

1053
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,540
It was worse than I thought it was going
to beat 'em sound.

1054
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,380
He tapped into that.
But what's interesting about him tapping

1055
00:43:42,381 --> 00:43:45,590
into that is this is not something that 
he had been timing on about for years.

1056
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:48,470
He was a Democrat,
but this time he's not an ideologue,

1057
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:49,160
which is,
you know,

1058
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,720
I heard when he got into office,
he was like,

1059
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:52,220
why don't we just give everybody 
Medicare,

1060
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:53,743
which is of course the answer you just 
gave everybody Medicare saving this 

1061
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,000
money instead of food stamps has given 
food.

1062
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,120
He's like,
we have this issue with people.

1063
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,160
They buy cigarettes and booze and stuff 
with food stamps.

1064
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:06,980
Just let's just give them food.
It's not a bad idea.

1065
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,140
That's not a bad idea.
If it's healthy,

1066
00:44:09,141 --> 00:44:14,141
good food places where people can go and
pick up healthy good food,

1067
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,350
that might be a very good idea.
Itto A,

1068
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,880
we need an infrastructure plan in the 
United States.

1069
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:23,900
Yes,
and FDR did that,

1070
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:25,700
right?
He gave old people retirement.

1071
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,460
He gave young people a job.
He put pike,

1072
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,010
gave people dignity.
He gave him a job and he said,

1073
00:44:32,011 --> 00:44:33,370
if you're willing to work,
you'll have a jet.

1074
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:34,350
Remember that?
The old saying,

1075
00:44:34,351 --> 00:44:35,184
when I grew up as they're going to be a 
chicken in every pot and a car in every 

1076
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:39,240
garage or something like that,
something like that,

1077
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,790
and they don't say that shit anymore,
right?

1078
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:43,890
Because the government is not there to 
help you anymore,

1079
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,480
but the government does pretend that 
they are.

1080
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,530
I mean,
he has to have.

1081
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:49,080
That trump has going on about is how 
much job.

1082
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,123
I mean,
how many more people are working today 

1083
00:44:51,031 --> 00:44:54,190
than before African American 
unemployment is at the lowest point.

1084
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,700
Forty years.
The economy's booming.

1085
00:44:56,701 --> 00:44:58,860
All these different things.
The economy,

1086
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:02,010
when they say the economy's booming,
they mean Wall Street is booming.

1087
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,500
The correlation between Wall Street and 
regular people's lives is not a.

1088
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:09,630
well though stock market has been 
booming.

1089
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,060
Uh,
I remember I got called into CNN to do a

1090
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:15,210
thing when the stock market crash 
crossed 13,000.

1091
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,960
Now it's up 25,000 and that was a big 
watershed moment.

1092
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:20,280
That was just a,
like eight years ago.

1093
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:22,350
I got called in to do that at CNN.
That was like,

1094
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:23,040
oh my God,
we.

1095
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,500
So we've gone.
We've doubled the stock market.

1096
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:28,530
People's paychecks have been doubled.
People's lives gotten worse actually,

1097
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,713
but I have a problem with saying that 
because there's just too many people 

1098
00:45:32,821 --> 00:45:33,654
you're dealing with.

1099
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:35,250
When you say people's lives have gotten 
worse,

1100
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,360
like what people.
Well,

1101
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:38,260
I'll tell you,
too many people,

1102
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:41,250
63 percent of the country can't afford a
thousand dollar emergency.

1103
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:45,120
Half the country right now is either 
poor or low income.

1104
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,013
Thirty 50 percent of all wage earners in
less than $30,000 a year in the richest 

1105
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:50,940
country in the world.
Jack Ma,

1106
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:56,390
who is the Jeff Bezos of Asia,
he runs the Amazon of Asia and he said,

1107
00:45:57,061 --> 00:45:58,920
you know,
the problem with the United States isn't

1108
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,260
making money.
It's that you guys don't distribute it.

1109
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:02,094
Right?
That's communist shit coming over from 

1110
00:46:04,051 --> 00:46:05,280
China.
You're going to let that slide,

1111
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,213
but let's call those communists.
Billionaires are buying up all our real 

1112
00:46:09,181 --> 00:46:10,014
estate.
Did a socialist country produced all 

1113
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:12,390
those billionaires?
Well,

1114
00:46:12,391 --> 00:46:13,224
go to the.
As soon as they got into communism or 

1115
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,220
into capitalism,
rather,

1116
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:19,330
they did it in a very ruthless way.
I mean,

1117
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,070
you look at what it's really kind of 
fucked up like what's going on with some

1118
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,800
of the places where we buy our goods 
like Foxconn,

1119
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:30,000
where they have nets around the building
and keep it from fucking jumping off.

1120
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,150
But when trump has been in office for 
only a year,

1121
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,210
he can't expect all those things to 
change.

1122
00:46:35,211 --> 00:46:38,160
But his argument has been that those 
things are improving.

1123
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,440
You think at this all.
It's all horseshit.

1124
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,333
Yes.
And so why is African American 

1125
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,790
unemployment at the lowest rate that's 
been in 40 years?

1126
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:48,510
Is that because it's unreported?
Like people stopped looking for jobs.

1127
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:49,703
They report.
They stopped counting those as being 

1128
00:46:51,301 --> 00:46:52,530
unemployed.
So there's that.

1129
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:53,423
Yeah.
And he stopped taking unemployment and 

1130
00:46:54,931 --> 00:46:56,670
they stopped looking for jobs,
but they don't count them.

1131
00:46:56,671 --> 00:46:57,630
Right.
They don't count them,

1132
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,420
but they're still unemployed.
Real sneaky statistics.

1133
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:03,230
Yes.
Also a really like it.

1134
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,930
If someone was honest about that,
I would like it to like,

1135
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,070
what's the real unemployment rate?
That's what we want to know.

1136
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:10,200
What's the real unemployment?
Would we find that out though?

1137
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:13,530
I don't know.
Maybe I noticed a guy named Mark Blythe.

1138
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,990
He would probably know what it is.
He's an economist.

1139
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,190
He,
uh,

1140
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:21,750
he coined the term global trumpism and 
he has a great line.

1141
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,020
He tells the elites about how we're 
running.

1142
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,360
They're running the economy,
of course I'm going to butcher it,

1143
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:30,040
but he says he,
the Hamptons aren't a defensible

1144
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,050
position.
It's a low lying area.

1145
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,210
He got a Scottish accent,
the Hamptons,

1146
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:37,360
or as a low lying area.
It's a very bad area to be that,

1147
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:40,390
a defensible position,
meaning when the fucking people come for

1148
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:41,410
you,
they're gonna you're,

1149
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,313
you're dead.
You get sides is a military base in the 

1150
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,250
tens,
right?

1151
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,350
You're not up on a hill.
People can get to you.

1152
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:50,110
So a lot of gold diggers.
So the jobs suck.

1153
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:52,540
Everybody's job sucks.
And we know we,

1154
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,100
we,
we hollowed out the unions.

1155
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:57,610
Nafta was the crushing blow to the 
unions in this country.

1156
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,440
And um,
you know,

1157
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:01,263
we need unions is one of the,
one of the things that actually cush 

1158
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,650
cushions the blow of the brutalities of 
a free market,

1159
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,120
right?
So you have unions,

1160
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:13,420
you have social programs because 
capitalism fucks everybody.

1161
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,373
And so you have to have all of these 
things in place to kind of cushion the 

1162
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:18,700
blow of it and we get.
We got rid of them,

1163
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,563
right.
Bill Clinton gutted welfare at the same 

1164
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:22,600
time he did Nafta,
I mean,

1165
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:24,580
and then he floated the prison 
population.

1166
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,180
But people that I know that,
yeah,

1167
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,033
were in unions,
particularly some friends that I have 

1168
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:33,040
that were in the auto union were saying 
that it was getting completely bloated.

1169
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,450
They were doing were having two people 
doing a job that was only for one person

1170
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:42,451
and there was all this there.
There was all this real wanting,

1171
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:44,223
purposeful waste,
and this was all designed into certain 

1172
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:49,450
contracts.
This is a buddy of mine that was an auto

1173
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:50,284
worker in Detroit.
He said we had shifts where there was 

1174
00:48:52,751 --> 00:48:53,584
supposed to be two people on the job and
everybody knew it was a real simple 

1175
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:56,140
thing.
You work on machine,

1176
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,153
so I would work four hours and he would 
work four hours or I would work a day 

1177
00:49:00,551 --> 00:49:01,384
and he would work a day,
but we both punched in and that was 

1178
00:49:03,491 --> 00:49:04,630
just.
It was just common.

1179
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:05,464
And there was several of those and he 
goes and you were getting $100,000 a 

1180
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:09,550
year,
$200,000 a year for some jobs,

1181
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:10,723
just ridiculous amounts of money for 
jobs that really didn't warn that kind 

1182
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:17,170
of income.
And he said this was all negotiated into

1183
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:18,004
the contract is like it's a good thing 
to get fair wages and healthy wages and 

1184
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:23,740
health insurance and all these different
things.

1185
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:25,480
He said,
but it was unquestionably bloated,

1186
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,493
which opened the door to all these 
factories going into Mexico and all 

1187
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:30,154
these other places.

1188
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,110
Well,
what opened the door for those factories

1189
00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:32,591
going?
Why?

1190
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:34,990
Why I would say two things to that.
First of all,

1191
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:35,824
it doesn't.
It's kind of anti logical to think that 

1192
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:38,680
the union would say,
no,

1193
00:49:38,681 --> 00:49:41,920
we're not going to negotiate on this and
go ahead and take our jobs.

1194
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,640
Both of those jobs to Mexico.
So I think they had a chance number.

1195
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:46,503
Right.
Number two is if you look at the 

1196
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:48,760
strongest economies,
right?

1197
00:49:48,761 --> 00:49:50,470
You look at Germany,
they have strong unions,

1198
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,850
Japan,
they have strong unions.

1199
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:54,010
And by the way,
the union sit on their boards.

1200
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:54,961
Well,
there's also,

1201
00:49:54,961 --> 00:49:55,180
it was

1202
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,013
a real problem in the 19 eighties and a,
I guess a little bit in the late 

1203
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:03,550
seventies when the oil crisis happened.
America was making dog shit cars.

1204
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,730
They're just making terrible and then 
Japanese,

1205
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:08,530
we're making these cars that were 
goddamn bulletproof,

1206
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,310
right?
Like you'd make it,

1207
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:13,110
you'd buy a Toyota Corolla and that 
fucking thing would go 400,000,

1208
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,850
500,000 miles when I was single problem,
you know,

1209
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:19,210
you buy an oldsmobile and that thing 
would shit the bed inside of a month and

1210
00:50:19,211 --> 00:50:21,430
a half and you'd be fucking furious.
And everybody was like,

1211
00:50:21,431 --> 00:50:22,750
buy American,
buy American.

1212
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,730
And a lot of people like,
well fuck you man.

1213
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,790
You're making shitty cars.
He's got the emmy.

1214
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:27,843
I bought a dodge Daytona,
I had it for maybe three months and the 

1215
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:33,374
handle fell off in my hand.
I went to open the door and it came off 

1216
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:38,750
in my hand while he motherfucker.
And that was like,

1217
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,440
I think one of the first car,
first car I ever bought.

1218
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,780
That's it.
Well I was a road comic.

1219
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:47,980
I'm like,
I have to buy a Honda comment.

1220
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:48,960
Yeah,
I can't,

1221
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:50,520
this has been a early nineties.
I'm like,

1222
00:50:50,521 --> 00:50:52,920
I have to buy a car that I can rely on.
And same thing.

1223
00:50:52,921 --> 00:50:54,810
I had an accord.
He had a civic.

1224
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:57,380
So the best is it.
It never breaks.

1225
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,790
They never broke.
So uh,

1226
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:02,340
so I would look at that unions,
it's not the problem.

1227
00:51:02,341 --> 00:51:03,174
The unions aren't the problem.
Yang fact unions are an answer to the 

1228
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:07,230
problem and if you look at the 
economies,

1229
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:10,380
everyone wants to be like,
look at Germany by the way,

1230
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:11,214
the German unions just won the right for
a 28 hour to work 28 hours a week and 

1231
00:51:15,301 --> 00:51:18,510
they got a four percent pay raise.
I would say that's eight hours too much.

1232
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,690
I would agree.
I really think I'm talking too much.

1233
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:22,563
Yesterday with Johann Hari who wrote a 
book on depression and one of the major 

1234
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:28,360
causes being the way people live their 
lives without control,

1235
00:51:28,361 --> 00:51:29,194
doing things they don't want to do.
And he was saying that somewhere in the 

1236
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:32,104
neighborhood of 87 percent of the people
are doing things they don't want to be 

1237
00:51:35,141 --> 00:51:38,050
doing most of the time for,
for a job.

1238
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:41,120
And I was,
I was making the argument that we,

1239
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,063
we,
we've set up this structure that's just 

1240
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,733
completely ridiculous and we've stuck 
with it because it's just the way we've 

1241
00:51:47,231 --> 00:51:49,960
always done things.
This 40 hour work week plus overtime,

1242
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:52,690
it's chaos.
You're losing your life.

1243
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,471
The end,
by the way,

1244
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,290
we'd be working more if it wasn't for 
unions.

1245
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:57,340
We had weakened because of unions,
right?

1246
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,393
Goes back to the foxconn thing.
They don't have unions and they have 

1247
00:52:00,531 --> 00:52:02,870
fucking nets around their building and 
dormitories where they live,

1248
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,650
where they work.

1249
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:05,540
So that's when people say about Amazon 
too.

1250
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:07,130
And my whole thing is like people's 
like,

1251
00:52:07,131 --> 00:52:08,360
why do you still,
you know,

1252
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,690
you can't use Amazon,
you can't.

1253
00:52:09,691 --> 00:52:10,251
I'm like,
you know,

1254
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:13,370
it's so hard to live off the grid,
you know what I mean?

1255
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:17,180
It's like I drive a car so I'm going to 
have to buy gas from Exxon or shell.

1256
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,900
Alright.
So does that make me a bad lefty?

1257
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:21,590
Because I'm supporting oil.
Company's supposed to get a prius bro.

1258
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,870
You know,
I mean you still put gas in a prius.

1259
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,130
That's right.
You got to get a tesla.

1260
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:30,440
But then your wrench,
that new tesla three is a cheaper one,

1261
00:52:30,441 --> 00:52:32,960
right?
It's $50 something you want on it.

1262
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:33,794
It's still going to cost more.
You want to see pitches flexera 

1263
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,873
quitting.
What you gotta do is you got to get an 

1264
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,750
old car like an old civic and then 
rebuild it.

1265
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,710
Yeah.
Well the,

1266
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,980
the,
the uh,

1267
00:52:43,981 --> 00:52:45,980
I least now I don't buy cars.
That's a scam.

1268
00:52:45,981 --> 00:52:48,740
I think buying cars anyway.
Uh,

1269
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,290
it is for the most part,
but not if you buy classic cars.

1270
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:52,430
Oh no,
that's different.

1271
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,353
Definitely.
If you're Jay Leno and stick your chin 

1272
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,360
out when you do that.
Well in his new show is fantastic.

1273
00:52:59,361 --> 00:53:01,050
It's really good.
That car show is.

1274
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:01,943
That's the show.
I wish he would've been doing all along 

1275
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,580
the exact same.
Are you kidding me?

1276
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,860
Yes.
I couldn't believe how much I liked it.

1277
00:53:06,861 --> 00:53:08,420
I liked him.
I liked him on that.

1278
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:10,750
Says,
well,

1279
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,100
you know why it's because he's 
passionate.

1280
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,930
I like him.
It's like,

1281
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:15,893
that's really was,
you know when you would watch them 

1282
00:53:17,271 --> 00:53:18,104
interview someone,
you could tell he didn't give a fuck 

1283
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:23,240
about what the question he was asking.
Do you remember the Bill Hicks bit?

1284
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:24,650
Yeah.
Bill Hicks,

1285
00:53:24,651 --> 00:53:26,680
bit of course.
Interviewing Kelly.

1286
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,650
He got a car now you drive in,
you drive and he got a girlfriend.

1287
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:36,730
He got to know bill.
Bill hugs would have A.

1288
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:40,350
Jaylen will reach into his drawer and 
pull out an Uzi and stick in his mouth.

1289
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:45,351
I used to be a fucking comic and he 
blows his brains out and it forms an NBC

1290
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:49,410
peacock in the on the wall and the wall 
behind him because he's a company man to

1291
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:52,250
the bitter end and that was the bet 
reloading.

1292
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,910
When does it become?
Well,

1293
00:53:56,911 --> 00:53:58,050
that's the weirdest thing.
You know,

1294
00:53:58,051 --> 00:54:00,390
Jay Leno was again,
one of my,

1295
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:04,710
one of my inspirations to become a 
comedian was in the early day.

1296
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:06,470
Yeah.
And I would tell people that and they're

1297
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,313
like,
Huh?

1298
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,600
Because they only knew him from the 
tonight show and I'm like,

1299
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:10,860
I don't know what he's doing on that 
show,

1300
00:54:10,861 --> 00:54:12,360
but he's the funniest guy in the world.

1301
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:17,250
It would be like if Dave Chappelle,
before he did Chappelle show,

1302
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,233
decided to host a talk show and then 
completely stopped anything 

1303
00:54:21,151 --> 00:54:25,260
controversial and completely stopped 
having an opinion on anything.

1304
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,170
If you look at that one,
Jay Leno used to go on David Letterman.

1305
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:30,300
He was the guy.
Oh,

1306
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,830
it was a guy who was edgy and super 
cheap,

1307
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:38,490
super edgy.
He made fun of Corporate America,

1308
00:54:38,491 --> 00:54:40,770
like nobody's business.
He was a sharp comic.

1309
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,870
He was a,
it was the best comic.

1310
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,500
And uh,
so that's why it was funny when he,

1311
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:47,423
when he got the tonight show,
I just didn't think he showed off his 

1312
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:50,330
talents,
no heat,

1313
00:54:50,331 --> 00:54:54,720
but for him that was making it,
he was in his head and his head.

1314
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,880
That's it.
This is what is in our heads.

1315
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,270
We were like,
what did you miss?

1316
00:55:00,271 --> 00:55:01,051
Everything,
like,

1317
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:02,410
what the fuck are you doing?
You don't want to.

1318
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:06,180
I was on the tonight show and um,
a couple times,

1319
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,870
one time I was on and during the break I
sat there with Jay and I,

1320
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,920
I said,
I think it was the first time I was on.

1321
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:13,773
I said,
hey man,

1322
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,900
I go,
what was up with that Bill Hicks?

1323
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:17,070
Bit Like A.
Well,

1324
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,330
no.
Yeah,

1325
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:19,560
yeah.
I had to,

1326
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,453
had to ask because I was like,
what are the odds I want to be on the 

1327
00:55:23,281 --> 00:55:24,890
show again?
I'm like a mom.

1328
00:55:24,891 --> 00:55:27,840
Once,
I think it was the fear factor days,

1329
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,793
which was in the early fear factor days.
I was 100 percent convinced that show 

1330
00:55:31,181 --> 00:55:32,910
was canceled at any second now.
So I'm like,

1331
00:55:32,911 --> 00:55:35,190
really isn't my one chance to get on the
Jay Leno show.

1332
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,340
Let me ask them some questions.
So he's like,

1333
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:38,610
you don't yell,
you don't like doing that.

1334
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,200
And I think,
yeah,

1335
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,220
I,
it's not bad.

1336
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:41,851
I go,
hey man,

1337
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:42,960
let me ask you this.
I go,

1338
00:55:42,961 --> 00:55:44,280
what?
What's up with that Bill Hicks thing?

1339
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:45,540
Right.
And uh,

1340
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,340
his take on it was,
you know,

1341
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:49,710
well,
I wanted to do jokes for everybody,

1342
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:51,450
you know,
I wanted to do comedy for everybody.

1343
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,970
And Bill just didn't believe in doing 
comedy for everybody.

1344
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,600
I thought it was interesting.
He just,

1345
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,900
I don't think he expected me to ask it 
to them.

1346
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,073
You're not hitting them on the podcast.
And he was fucking fantastic because 

1347
00:56:01,771 --> 00:56:04,410
after he'd retired,
he told some stories about doing standup

1348
00:56:04,411 --> 00:56:07,980
for mom people and about this guy 
fucking screaming at a priest,

1349
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:09,510
you fucking mother,
fuck up.

1350
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,833
And it was a hilarious thing to watch 
Jay Leno telling hilarious stories and 

1351
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,460
swearing like a fucking long shoreman.
And I was like,

1352
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,720
wow,
this is crazy.

1353
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:24,280
You're a regular guy.
Like you've always been a regular

1354
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,400
guy.
You were just doing the tonight show.

1355
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:32,140
And I heard stories about Jay that he.
He loved to watch hacky comedy.

1356
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,033
And the reason why this stuck in my head
was because I used to do that too with 

1357
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,250
todd glass.
We would,

1358
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,760
we would,
if the was the worst,

1359
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:43,710
the comedian,
the better.

1360
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:46,210
We actually have three specials lined up
for a night.

1361
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:47,141
He was like,
fuck,

1362
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:47,974
this is going to be great.
And we found out after I found out that 

1363
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:52,443
Jay Leno used to do the same thing when 
he would see a comic that he didn't 

1364
00:56:54,761 --> 00:56:55,630
think,
you know,

1365
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:58,660
he thought it was horrible.
He would hunt down a tape of it and then

1366
00:56:58,661 --> 00:57:00,340
everyone would have to come over to his 
house.

1367
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,160
And they've watched it.
Oh,

1368
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,150
that's just a story I heard.
So maybe this is,

1369
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,380
but it's true.
I'm sure.

1370
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,910
And I'm like,
holy fuck,

1371
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,160
that's what I do.

1372
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,020
Well,
he just turned everything mild,

1373
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,850
you know,
he turned everything mild for many,

1374
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:13,684
many years and just didn't.
It just wasn't who he was or what made 

1375
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:20,050
me like him.
And it confused me and I felt personally

1376
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:20,884
let down by him.
I felt like he left on comedy because 

1377
00:57:23,201 --> 00:57:26,620
now he was supposed to show the old 
people what the new people were doing in

1378
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:31,621
comedy and then he just kind of didn't.
But now you see him and he's like a very

1379
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:33,670
likable person.
He's fun.

1380
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:34,900
Like,
could show is fun.

1381
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:36,050
That's Joe.
Look,

1382
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:36,963
it's because exactly he's talking about 
shitty cares about that show was not 

1383
00:57:40,241 --> 00:57:41,600
made for him the tonight show.
He.

1384
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:43,480
But he was the number one show.
So what do we know?

1385
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:45,040
Right?
It was still the number one show,

1386
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:45,950
so maybe I'm wrong.
Oh,

1387
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:47,200
it was a different thing,
you know,

1388
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:50,710
because like letterman seemed 
passionate,

1389
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,660
like he seemed to be enjoying it.

1390
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:56,380
And when he would say like witty things 
and sharp things to people,

1391
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,393
he would,
you could tell he was getting a little 

1392
00:57:58,931 --> 00:58:02,530
bit of a thrill out of it.
There was some excitement to Letterman's

1393
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:05,440
position that you didn't sense with Jay 
Leno.

1394
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:06,760
Jay Leno was just like,
well,

1395
00:58:06,761 --> 00:58:08,020
you know,
making everybody happy.

1396
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:09,003
So the thing I liked about late night 
shows when I was younger was that there 

1397
00:58:13,361 --> 00:58:15,540
was a sense of danger that anything 
could happen.

1398
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,720
You didn't know what was going to 
happen.

1399
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:17,623
Right?
A Burt Reynolds is going to come out 

1400
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:20,860
drunk,
you know what I mean?

1401
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,170
Like that.
Yeah.

1402
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:24,820
Yeah.
And they used to smoke and you know,

1403
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,380
there was.
And they would talk about things.

1404
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:27,214
They were talk show.
They would actually talk about things 

1405
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:30,660
and I get to watch a Dick cabot.
And he would,

1406
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,520
he,
I remember he had a,

1407
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,100
uh,
a mort Sahl come out with Jane Fonda and

1408
00:58:36,101 --> 00:58:36,934
Peter Fonda right after the easy rider 
came up and they're all talk and you're 

1409
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,190
like,
this is a fucking counterculture.

1410
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:44,770
And it's right on.
And so it was really good.

1411
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:48,340
That's when shows,
but now shows her now they're all fluff.

1412
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:50,730
It's all fucking bubble of that stuff as
well.

1413
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,573
There was an outlet for that though,
and it was filled by comedy in podcasts 

1414
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:55,883
just so now.
Podcasts are doing that and those late 

1415
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,350
night shows,
I have no idea what they're doing or why

1416
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:02,680
they even exist.
We're even Stephen Colbert,

1417
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,890
Stephen Colbert show on comedy central.
Just a brilliant,

1418
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:06,724
brilliant show and now he quit to get 
way more money to do a more popular 

1419
00:59:10,301 --> 00:59:12,210
show.
That is way less relevant.

1420
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:13,143
Interesting or creative,
but it is funny when you fucking mocks 

1421
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,010
trump.
It's funny how hard he goes.

1422
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:18,844
The fact that he said why trump's but 
did he uses his mouth is Kootenai 

1423
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,570
Putin's cock holster.
The fact that they said that on CBS,

1424
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,041
I was like,
wow,

1425
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:30,530
this is what happens when you have to 
compete with the Internet.

1426
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,800
Who the fuck could have imagined every 
doing mccarthy smears,

1427
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:41,150
but who the fucking thought a job,
but a joke like that.

1428
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:46,010
A can I get the mccarthyism thing,
but the joke of a cock holster,

1429
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:50,630
the president's mouth being used as 
Putin's cock holster that,

1430
00:59:50,631 --> 00:59:52,780
that would be on CBS.
I get that.

1431
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,860
You're applauding that.
He broke a boundary.

1432
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:55,790
Well,
I'm a,

1433
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:56,623
I'm not applauding it.
I'm just saying it's fascinating that 

1434
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:01,550
we've changed.
What's the bar?

1435
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:02,410
What's,
what,

1436
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:04,430
what you're allowed to do,
like you've changed.

1437
01:00:04,431 --> 01:00:07,150
Ever end because it's trump.
Like if they said that about Hillary,

1438
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:10,130
Hillary Clinton,
he said,

1439
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,993
well,
because look at all this Russia dossier 

1440
01:00:12,261 --> 01:00:13,460
memos.
Shit that's coming out.

1441
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:16,040
I mean it turns out that a lot of this 
stuff is horseshit.

1442
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,870
So a lot of people who weren't around 
for the first mccarthy a shit,

1443
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:21,170
they're getting to experience it now.

1444
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:22,410
This is what it's like.
Yeah,

1445
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,080
this is what it's like.
And you're like,

1446
01:00:24,081 --> 01:00:25,040
what?
Even the media is.

1447
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:26,240
Yeah.
And the media goes along.

1448
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:29,480
Yeah,
this is what it's like and you know,

1449
01:00:29,481 --> 01:00:31,280
um,
I don't,

1450
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:34,430
I don't want to spend any amount of time
talking about it,

1451
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,264
but it's so unbelievable because people,
they forgot you're talking to a wall 

1452
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:39,230
when you tell people just go,
well,

1453
01:00:39,231 --> 01:00:41,270
you mean there was collusion?
I got one.

1454
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:42,290
Well,
it's collusion.

1455
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:43,700
What does that mean?
Collusion,

1456
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:44,893
that trump colluded with the Russians 
hacked into the John Podesta's emails 

1457
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,970
and somehow they need to trump to help 
them.

1458
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:51,870
What the fuck?
Right.

1459
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,510
That's the because that's what they're 
saying.

1460
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:54,373
Exactly.
And that there's some kind of quid pro 

1461
01:00:55,581 --> 01:01:00,260
quo and that now trump has a Manchurian 
candidate and that he's Putin's puppet.

1462
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,273
And uh,
but you noticed they're moving the 

1463
01:01:04,251 --> 01:01:05,330
goalposts every day.

1464
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:06,370
So now it's,
oh no,

1465
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:09,080
now he's,
he's in bed with Russian oligarchs doing

1466
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:10,160
money laundering.
Well,

1467
01:01:10,161 --> 01:01:15,161
you don't know there's a sale of a home 
and it was a Russian bought it Russian.

1468
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,153
So they've totally moved the goalposts 
from being treason to now he's just 

1469
01:01:18,921 --> 01:01:20,480
regular corrupt,
like everybody else.

1470
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:23,060
Because let me tell you something.
Everybody else has regular corrupt,

1471
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:23,894
like trump,
but I don't even know if it's regular 

1472
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:27,290
corrupt because we're talking about a 
sale of a house.

1473
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,880
Well,
there's quite a few years ago.

1474
01:01:28,881 --> 01:01:29,714
Well that there's more than one thing,
but they're talking about lots of other 

1475
01:01:32,091 --> 01:01:32,720
things,
right?

1476
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,490
And I say you want to talk about 
collusion?

1477
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,353
He opened up eight businesses in Saudi 
Arabia during the Goddamn campaign that 

1478
01:01:38,471 --> 01:01:39,304
there's your fucking collusion,
but nobody talks about that because 

1479
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:42,530
Saudi Arabia is supposed to be on our 
side,

1480
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,260
even though the repressive theocracy 
that beheads people in the streets.

1481
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,900
But we liked them because of the 
petrodollar,

1482
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:49,510
which no one ever talks about the 
petrodollar serving.

1483
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,320
It's dope.
Well,

1484
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,950
that's what props up our dollar right 
now.

1485
01:01:51,951 --> 01:01:55,040
The economy.
So what people don't know is that in the

1486
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:55,873
early seventies,
Richard Nixon took our country off the 

1487
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:00,380
gold standard and uh,
we went on the petro dollar.

1488
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:03,110
And what was that?
When we promised Saudi Arabia the use of

1489
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:03,944
our military anywhere they wanted,
as long as they would convert every 

1490
01:02:07,371 --> 01:02:11,030
dollar of oil that someone bought for 
them in American dollars.

1491
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:12,610
So if you want to buy oil from Saudi 
Arabia,

1492
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,870
first have to convert your currency into
American dollars,

1493
01:02:14,871 --> 01:02:17,870
which is the real reason why we invaded 
Iraq the first time.

1494
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,260
Well,
it has a lot to do it.

1495
01:02:19,261 --> 01:02:20,040
The patent.
It's why we're

1496
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,100
in Yemen right now.
We're doing siege warfare in Yemen,

1497
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:25,680
which is a war crime.
That guy just got convicted of it,

1498
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,000
uh,
at the Hague.

1499
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:30,120
So we're doing that in conjunction with 
Saudi Arabia.

1500
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,430
And why are we doing that?
Because of the petrodollar.

1501
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:35,110
That's what's it's all about.
Why are we in Africa?

1502
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,230
So every,
everything comes down to money.

1503
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:38,064
And why are we in Syria?
They wanted to put a natural gas 

1504
01:02:39,721 --> 01:02:40,554
pipeline through Syria and Russia 
doesn't want it because they want to 

1505
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:45,150
sell the,
the natural gas to Europe.

1506
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,190
That's what this is about.
So if there's a,

1507
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,920
and it's not about babies,
it's not about freedom.

1508
01:02:49,921 --> 01:02:52,380
It's not about liberty.
And you know,

1509
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:56,190
we got it clearly.
Don't like country music,

1510
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:59,490
country music,
real country music.

1511
01:02:59,491 --> 01:03:00,780
I like country,
like the outlaw.

1512
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:02,190
Can Be Merle haggard.
Yeah.

1513
01:03:02,191 --> 01:03:03,780
I like that guy.
Like waylon jennings.

1514
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:04,330
Yeah.

1515
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:07,710
I like Willie Nelson.
Not these fucking pussies and want to be

1516
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,080
boy scouts and my Mama and all that 
shit.

1517
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:11,600
What?
Who Sees?

1518
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,550
I'm not supposed to say pussies.
Well,

1519
01:03:14,551 --> 01:03:16,260
it's going to be a time where we can't 
say pussy shit,

1520
01:03:16,261 --> 01:03:17,370
Piss fuck cunt.
Cock sucker.

1521
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:18,204
Motherfucker and tits.
So a lot of people are trying to use 

1522
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:24,300
Hashtag me too for a puritanical reasons
and that's not what it's about.

1523
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:25,373
Hashtag me too is about fucking stopping
men who use their power and station in 

1524
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:32,850
life to hold it over women for sexual 
sexual purposes.

1525
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,430
That's what that's about.
It's not about being a puritan.

1526
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,353
It's not about being anti porn.
It's nothing wrong with the lusting 

1527
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:42,180
after a woman's tits and a woman's ass.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1528
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:45,150
And there's nothing wrong with a woman 
wanting to be fucked by a man.

1529
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:48,000
That was our normal things there.
So that's okay.

1530
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:48,834
And don't let people hijack that 
movement and try to use it for 

1531
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:54,720
puritanism because what a lot of people 
are doing shit.

1532
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:56,760
Piss fuck on cocksucker motherfucker.
Intense.

1533
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:59,030
I'm triggered.
Triggered

1534
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,060
to.
Yeah,

1535
01:04:00,061 --> 01:04:02,280
I mean absolutely.
I mean,

1536
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:06,720
I think that what what we're dealing 
with is an exposure of sexual assault,

1537
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,200
exposure of sexual harassment,
sexual assault,

1538
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:12,390
particularly in the workplace.
You know,

1539
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:13,224
and this is a giant issue for people 
that have to work alongside men and 

1540
01:04:15,661 --> 01:04:16,494
women and they develop these little 
communities inside these little boxes 

1541
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:20,154
that we call offices and things get 
really fucking weird and if you have a 

1542
01:04:22,501 --> 01:04:24,690
boss,
it's a piece of shit and he's constantly

1543
01:04:24,691 --> 01:04:27,270
harassing the women that work there and 
it becomes a living hell with them.

1544
01:04:27,271 --> 01:04:29,520
Their stress they're going through.
Maybe it is a crime.

1545
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,800
You're doing something to those people 
that work there.

1546
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:32,470
You're,
you're,

1547
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:34,290
you're,
you're putting this pressure on them.

1548
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,140
You're fucking up their life.
Could you imagine?

1549
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,163
Could you eat?
The last thing I would ever want to do 

1550
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,450
was imposed myself sexually at a woman 
who didn't want it.

1551
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,000
Right?
While you're a healthy person,

1552
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,800
like I mean some people,
it's just about.

1553
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,750
We've all been into the end goal.

1554
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,800
We've all been drunk,
right?

1555
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:52,003
We've all been on a date or a woman 
didn't want to have sex and we did and 

1556
01:04:54,861 --> 01:04:57,140
we pushed the issue.
But,

1557
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:58,933
uh,

1558
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,071
you know,
I,

1559
01:05:01,071 --> 01:05:02,490
I just can't imagine.
Like,

1560
01:05:02,491 --> 01:05:03,530
I just never,
I just can't.

1561
01:05:03,531 --> 01:05:04,980
I don't get that.
She doesn't like you.

1562
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:05,814
Oh,
I'm going to make her go feel 

1563
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:07,380
uncomfortable.
Like,

1564
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:09,540
what the fuck do you get out of that?
That's just weird.

1565
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:09,730
Well,

1566
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:11,920
there's people that hate the opposite 
sex.

1567
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,630
I mean,
and I say the opposite sex.

1568
01:05:13,631 --> 01:05:16,030
I don't mean just men who hate women.
There's women who hate men.

1569
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,100
There's people who have associated

1570
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:23,100
the opposite sex with rejection and pain
and frustration all of their life.

1571
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:26,710
You look at a guy like Harvey Weinstein,
that is an ugly fat guy,

1572
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:27,843
right?
There's no women who are lusting after 

1573
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:30,124
him.
It was his power and his money that got 

1574
01:05:32,201 --> 01:05:33,034
him into a position where he could get 
some pussy and then having power over 

1575
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:39,770
all these actresses and then hearing 
whether it's Uhm,

1576
01:05:39,771 --> 01:05:41,680
uh,
Thurman or whatever,

1577
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,840
you know,
famous actress Salma Hayek,

1578
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:48,160
all these superstars who were fighting 
this guy off and hotel rooms.

1579
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,750
I mean,
it's fucking crazy.

1580
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:50,980
I mean,
he is a maniac,

1581
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:52,023
but he's a disgusting guy who has no 
shot at getting someone to appreciate 

1582
01:05:57,491 --> 01:06:00,280
him physically.
They might like his personality,

1583
01:06:00,281 --> 01:06:03,220
but for someone to be physically 
attracted to him is almost impossible.

1584
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:04,691
Right?
I mean,

1585
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:07,090
he's eating himself into this disgusting
shape.

1586
01:06:07,091 --> 01:06:08,690
Unless you have a fetish or whatever.
Yeah.

1587
01:06:08,691 --> 01:06:11,260
You might just into getting fucked by 
Jabba the hut.

1588
01:06:11,261 --> 01:06:15,880
Just big fat guy with pockmarked skin 
shooting loads all over you.

1589
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,290
There's no way it makes any sense,

1590
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,200
but if he was going to put you in 
ocean's 11,

1591
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:20,730
you got to do what you gotta do.

1592
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,331
Well,
you know,

1593
01:06:25,331 --> 01:06:26,750
Matt Damon said,
what?

1594
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:29,350
What did Matt Damon's say?
They were trying to get them out of that

1595
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:30,400
new oceans movie.

1596
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:31,011
Well,
it didn't.

1597
01:06:31,011 --> 01:06:31,844
He say something about there was a 
continuum or something that that 

1598
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,080
everything is Harvey Weinstein.
Wasn't that it?

1599
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:41,430
I don't remember the exact quote,
but it was something along the lines of,

1600
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,593
we have to make a differentiation 
between sexual assault and men hitting 

1601
01:06:47,551 --> 01:06:48,384
on women.
What's really interesting is seeing how 

1602
01:06:49,981 --> 01:06:52,980
they're acting about this in France,
in Europe,

1603
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:54,690
a lot of women,
especially older actions.

1604
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,950
Did you see?
Did you see that's wild.

1605
01:06:57,050 --> 01:07:02,050
They want men to be men and and France.
I mean if they're just France part on a,

1606
01:07:02,761 --> 01:07:04,250
they're just different over there.
This,

1607
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:05,670
there,
they have a different attitude.

1608
01:07:05,671 --> 01:07:06,504
The same as Brazil.
My friend Tiago from Brazil told me 

1609
01:07:09,511 --> 01:07:10,390
once,
he's like,

1610
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,310
man,
he goes,

1611
01:07:11,311 --> 01:07:12,780
if you're in Brazil,
and he goes,

1612
01:07:12,781 --> 01:07:14,190
if you're with a girl,
you don't try to fuck her.

1613
01:07:14,191 --> 01:07:16,020
She's like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

1614
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:18,210
Like you're not even trying to fuck me.
Like,

1615
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,160
what the fuck is wrong with these?
They'll get mad at you.

1616
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:24,330
Like they appreciate like in Brazil is a
very aggressive.

1617
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,430
I have sexually aggressive place.

1618
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,290
I,
I have had a.

1619
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:31,470
I'll never forget,
I was working at a comedy club and there

1620
01:07:31,471 --> 01:07:34,510
was a girl there who was beautiful and 
um,

1621
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:38,610
she flirted with me and uh,
well I,

1622
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:40,710
I didn't know if she was flirting with 
me because I was just,

1623
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,330
she was just beautiful and she talked to
me.

1624
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:43,860
So I'm like,
oh right,

1625
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,510
and so,
but I wasn't going to make a move at her

1626
01:07:45,511 --> 01:07:47,520
because I'm,
I'm considering every comedian who comes

1627
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,930
into this club makes a move on this 
girl.

1628
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,800
She's the prettiest girl around.
Right?

1629
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:53,280
So I didn't do anything because I want 
to be that guy.

1630
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:56,400
Right.
And then I'll never forget by the end of

1631
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,440
the week,
it was the last night and she's like,

1632
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,090
Hey,
there was a party at my house tonight,

1633
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:01,650
are you going to come?
And I was like,

1634
01:08:01,651 --> 01:08:02,540
oh sure.
Right.

1635
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:07,440
So I went to their whatever cut to,
I'm leaving and she goes,

1636
01:08:07,441 --> 01:08:09,270
are you fucking kidding me?
And I go,

1637
01:08:09,271 --> 01:08:09,751
what?
She goes,

1638
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:12,450
I threw a party just to get you to my 
apartment and you're going to leave.

1639
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:13,590
And I was like,
Oh really?

1640
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:15,030
You want to?
And so we had

1641
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,670
damn should've beat you over the head 
with it.

1642
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,513
Yeah.
So,

1643
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:20,643
so there was a woman who was,
but you didn't want to be the guy that 

1644
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,910
was super aggressive against a girl that
was like,

1645
01:08:25,911 --> 01:08:27,140
Hey,
I just like you,

1646
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,103
you just fun guy to hang out with.
Does everything have to be sex and I 

1647
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:32,260
know every guy in the world hit on her.
You,

1648
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:33,500
you know what I honestly,
I mean,

1649
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:35,700
I don't want to say this because w,
w,

1650
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:37,063
it's almost like in this day and age,
you got to get to know someone forever 

1651
01:08:39,501 --> 01:08:41,540
before you fuck them.
I mean literally forever.

1652
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:43,850
You're got to fuck my wife.
The first night we went up.

1653
01:08:43,851 --> 01:08:44,780
Good.
Good for you.

1654
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,850
And she wouldn't,
uh,

1655
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,100
which has probably worked out because 
we're still together and uh,

1656
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:52,100
but I kept,
I did it in a charming way.

1657
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,083
Right,
right.

1658
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:55,611
I would say,
honey,

1659
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:55,930
I.

1660
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:56,810
Oh,
can we ask you this?

1661
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,820
Why did you try to fuck her on the first
night?

1662
01:08:58,821 --> 01:08:59,654
But it took you five nights for the 
waitress because I didn't want to be 

1663
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:05,330
that guy at the club because that makes 
sense because it's a work environment.

1664
01:09:05,331 --> 01:09:06,164
Yeah.
So you're the opposite of a sexual 

1665
01:09:07,131 --> 01:09:08,030
harasser?
I guess.

1666
01:09:08,031 --> 01:09:09,890
So I guess now that I look at it that 
way.

1667
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:10,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

1668
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,610
Not that I did not have sensitive.
Not that you weren't attracted to her,

1669
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,350
you just didn't want to be a dick.
Yeah,

1670
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,184
I didn't want to have that reputation of
that guy and plus there's plenty of 

1671
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:19,640
women in the audience.

1672
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:23,060
There's plenty of women.
Right?

1673
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,313
So what I would tell her,
I remember the first night we were 

1674
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:27,021
together,
I was like,

1675
01:09:27,021 --> 01:09:28,560
Hey,
I know you.

1676
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,190
I know you're going to say you want me 
to go home,

1677
01:09:31,191 --> 01:09:32,024
but you're going to worry that I'm too 
tired to drive and I might get in an 

1678
01:09:33,681 --> 01:09:35,780
accident so you don't have to say that.
I'll just stay.

1679
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,240
That's hilarious.
She's like,

1680
01:09:38,241 --> 01:09:38,721
no,
it's okay.

1681
01:09:38,721 --> 01:09:39,554
I go,
it's nice of you to say that you're 

1682
01:09:40,341 --> 01:09:41,750
strong,
you're brave,

1683
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:44,090
and I know you're gonna worry.
So I'm just staying.

1684
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:48,020
Then I think I did end up staying,
but we didn't have sex.

1685
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:51,620
Right.
And I'm like probably two more times,

1686
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:53,720
two more times like that.
But also it's,

1687
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:57,980
you don't really know someone's 
personality for a long time.

1688
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:58,993
I mean that's part of the problem.
The problem is people have physical 

1689
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:01,730
needs and they get attracted to each 
other.

1690
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:02,563
And then next,
you know,

1691
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,270
look,
there's been many times in my life where

1692
01:10:05,271 --> 01:10:06,104
I wound up having sex with somebody who 
turned out to be crazy and then you 

1693
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:09,410
know,
you're one,

1694
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:10,970
two dates in and like,
yeah,

1695
01:10:10,971 --> 01:10:11,804
she seems cool and next thing you know,
you're hanging out in a week or two 

1696
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:16,070
later and she does something completely 
fucking insane.

1697
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:19,340
And then the crazy just starts leaking 
out of her pores and you're like,

1698
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:20,203
oh well now what have I done?
I've been tangled myself with some 

1699
01:10:23,931 --> 01:10:24,764
person who knows where I live and 
expects me to call them every day and 

1700
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:30,860
we're going to get together and I have 
to figure out a way to back out of this.

1701
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:34,010
And then he tried to back out of it and 
they get fucking angry at you.

1702
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:37,370
And this is back in the old days when 
people would actually call you up,

1703
01:10:37,371 --> 01:10:38,300
call you to.

1704
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:39,463
There was no text messaging.
You can just pick up the phone if 

1705
01:10:41,311 --> 01:10:42,144
someone started yelling at you or I 
would just duck them for awhile until 

1706
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:45,314
they found some new guy.
Remember when people used to answer 

1707
01:10:46,731 --> 01:10:49,570
their phone,
they don't ever answer my.

1708
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:50,423
No one ever answers their phone.
When I get too many phone calls from 

1709
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:53,420
people.
I don't know.

1710
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,430
I just get phone calls from numbers.
I don't know.

1711
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:56,264
I'm like,
where's this going to get my fucking 

1712
01:10:56,631 --> 01:10:57,800
number from?
I have no idea.

1713
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,750
I just look at it and my.
Did you ever have.

1714
01:10:59,751 --> 01:11:03,240
I answered a call because I didn't 
because uh,

1715
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:03,800
you know,
you're like,

1716
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,970
oh,
maybe it's that business.

1717
01:11:04,971 --> 01:11:06,260
I just called her con.
You don't know.

1718
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:07,000
Right,
right.

1719
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,870
So I took one one time and it was just a
number.

1720
01:11:08,871 --> 01:11:09,704
It didn't come up and it was someone 
asking me for money to borrow the money 

1721
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,320
was just a person,

1722
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,400
you know,
I knew tangentially in comedy and,

1723
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:20,040
and I,
and I didn't say this and I was like,

1724
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,593
do you know that your name is not even 
in my fucking phone book and you're 

1725
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:26,640
asking for any money from.
That's a desperate move.

1726
01:11:26,641 --> 01:11:28,800
That must be a person who's like a 
gambling addict or something.

1727
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:31,920
That's what I thought right away.
But getting back to this thing about the

1728
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:32,521
women,
you know,

1729
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:35,250
one time I had a woman when I first 
moved to La,

1730
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:36,550
I was dating or,
and uh,

1731
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,093
I went to her house and she was really 
creative and she's cute and she wrote 

1732
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:44,130
songs and she would sing them for me.
I love that shit.

1733
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:46,020
And uh,
I remember she,

1734
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:46,943
like,
we were going to go have sex and she 

1735
01:11:47,281 --> 01:11:48,870
went and she was hanging on and she 
went,

1736
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:51,540
took a drink and I go,
what?

1737
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:52,321
She goes,
do you want to drink?

1738
01:11:52,321 --> 01:11:52,711
I go,
no.

1739
01:11:52,711 --> 01:11:53,401
And she goes,
Oh,

1740
01:11:53,401 --> 01:11:54,720
hell on.
And she's like drinking.

1741
01:11:54,721 --> 01:11:55,610
And I go,
what are you doing?

1742
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:57,270
Because I have to have a couple of 
drinks before.

1743
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:59,490
And then it made me not want to have sex
with her.

1744
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:01,380
Isn't that fucked up?
I was like,

1745
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,280
wow,
you have to have,

1746
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:04,260
you have to drink so you can feel 
comfortable.

1747
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:06,510
I took it personal,
which of course it was just her,

1748
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:07,373
it was,
she needed to relax because she had 

1749
01:12:08,401 --> 01:12:09,690
fucked up.
She had it or not.

1750
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,340
She had issues or whatever.
Right.

1751
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:12,750
And so,
uh,

1752
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:14,400
that was it.
I was like,

1753
01:12:14,401 --> 01:12:16,240
I can't be with the girl has to drink 
that accessible,

1754
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,090
isn't it

1755
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:19,250
to the window.
Especially when you're young and single.

1756
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:20,084
It's like you don't,
you don't want to get stuck in a bad 

1757
01:12:21,651 --> 01:12:22,820
situation.
You know,

1758
01:12:22,821 --> 01:12:25,130
like I'd seen a lot of bad situations 
when I was young,

1759
01:12:25,131 --> 01:12:27,140
my own parents and other people's 
parents.

1760
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:30,920
So I'd see anything fucking sketchy and 
like where this is gone,

1761
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:32,960
I don't want to deal with your problems,
you know,

1762
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:34,910
I don't have those kinds of problems.
So.

1763
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:35,773
See Ya.

1764
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:37,280
Yeah,
I was the same way.

1765
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:40,730
My,
I had a lot of bad examples of people.

1766
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:43,970
I have no idea why these people would be
with the spouse there with like,

1767
01:12:43,971 --> 01:12:44,804
why would you do that?
Well maybe that's going to happen to me 

1768
01:12:46,221 --> 01:12:49,790
because it's unconscious.
So I started reading self help books and

1769
01:12:49,791 --> 01:12:50,624
watching John Bradshaw videos that I 
don't know if he knew that his John 

1770
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:53,923
Bradshaw,
he invented that term inner child and 

1771
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:57,260
all the inner child work and all that 
stuff.

1772
01:12:57,261 --> 01:12:59,510
So I got fucked up

1773
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,040
people's ads.
I'm getting your child pitch,

1774
01:13:03,041 --> 01:13:03,874
you're 40.

1775
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,040
But he was,
he was helpful to me because he broke up

1776
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:07,874
the family dynamic and he talked about 
how people act in fact come from a big 

1777
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,860
family,
12 kids and that,

1778
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,630
you know,
how it's like,

1779
01:13:14,631 --> 01:13:17,450
it all balances out.
You'll have a bad kid and as an angel,

1780
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:18,613
you know,
and all the and everything in between 

1781
01:13:19,371 --> 01:13:22,970
and he talked to him and so it helped me
understand myself a lot.

1782
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:25,030
Uh,
and we're.

1783
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:29,030
So I wanted to understand my motivations
so I didn't make bad choices in my life.

1784
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:32,840
Like I had seen people around me making.
And because it's unconscious,

1785
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:34,510
right?
So you just do what's habit,

1786
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:35,150
you know,
you don't,

1787
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:38,390
you don't even know why you're doing 
what you're doing half the time.

1788
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:39,563
You're not conscious of why you're 
acting the way you're acting or why you 

1789
01:13:41,511 --> 01:13:42,860
like what you like.
You just go.

1790
01:13:42,861 --> 01:13:43,850
I like that.
Why

1791
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,730
when I was struggling as a comic,
one thing that I definitely did is I,

1792
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,593
I only gave this.
I only gave a certain amount of room to 

1793
01:13:50,911 --> 01:13:54,840
relationships because I knew that I've 
really had to concentrate on my career.

1794
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:55,800
Yes.
I'm like,

1795
01:13:55,801 --> 01:13:57,150
if I don't,
I will.

1796
01:13:57,151 --> 01:13:59,880
It will fall apart.
There was a kid that I started out with,

1797
01:13:59,881 --> 01:14:00,714
we both started out together and it was 
pretty funny guy and he got this 

1798
01:14:03,301 --> 01:14:04,134
girlfriend that was just very demanding 
and he stopped doing stand up less and 

1799
01:14:07,081 --> 01:14:08,190
less.
It was.

1800
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:11,680
It was doing less and less sets and then
eventually he dropped out and then I ran

1801
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:11,980
into his

1802
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,410
son many years later and his son,
you know the,

1803
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,253
the.
They wound up having a baby and his son 

1804
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:21,190
was saying that his dad just really 
regretted not getting into comedy.

1805
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:23,440
I'm sure he's happy.
He has a nice sun and all that stuff and

1806
01:14:23,441 --> 01:14:26,300
he had a family but it just,
it tanked him.

1807
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:27,563
There's a saying,
I think it might've been Carl young who 

1808
01:14:30,281 --> 01:14:31,114
said,
nothing affects a child more than the 

1809
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:37,600
unlived life of its parent.
So imagine.

1810
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:38,493
I mean,
imagine being a father and you went 

1811
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:42,790
after your dream and you gave it 
everything you can.

1812
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:45,610
Now you can impart that to your kid and 
your kid just absorbs it.

1813
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,040
Being around you.
Now you didn't do that.

1814
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:48,874
You have all that on resentment or 
whatever you feel because you didn't 

1815
01:14:53,051 --> 01:14:53,884
live what your life here supposed to and
then you can pass that off and your kid 

1816
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:57,723
absorbs that.

1817
01:14:57,790 --> 01:14:58,623
I knew it was so hard to do anyway.
It was going to be so hard to make it 

1818
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:03,010
in.
The odds are stacked against you.

1819
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:05,320
You've seen everybody else drop off like
flies.

1820
01:15:05,321 --> 01:15:07,450
You see guys can't get gigs.
They wind up quitting.

1821
01:15:07,451 --> 01:15:09,520
They get a day job,
they work less and less,

1822
01:15:09,521 --> 01:15:10,354
and the next thing you know,
they're just completely stopped doing 

1823
01:15:11,171 --> 01:15:12,004
standup.
It's so common and so when I would see 

1824
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,173
relationships and see those signs where 
girls are just demanding more and more 

1825
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:20,080
of my time,
why do you have to go up tonight?

1826
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:23,510
I'm like a four or five nights a week.
I have two kids.

1827
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,520
Yeah.
I'm like,

1828
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:26,770
you can come with me.
I've seen your act 100 times.

1829
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:29,430
Well,
what I do,

1830
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:31,180
this is what I do.
You know I can't.

1831
01:15:31,181 --> 01:15:33,980
I don't know what to tell you.
I meet guys who they their,

1832
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:34,863
their spouses,
their significant others aren't into 

1833
01:15:36,881 --> 01:15:39,490
their comedy and I'm like,
it's awful.

1834
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,770
It's awful.
That's the thing that sap.

1835
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:43,210
What do you,
what,

1836
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:46,420
what do you like about me?
My wife is,

1837
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:50,590
I would say she's a,
she's a fan of comedy,

1838
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,490
but she's been around me for a long time
and she is,

1839
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:55,503
she's hard,
like if she wants to stand up and it's 

1840
01:15:57,701 --> 01:15:58,990
not good to like,
this sucks.

1841
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:00,190
Well that there's nothing wrong with 
that.

1842
01:16:00,191 --> 01:16:01,060
No,
it's good.

1843
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,460
It's a good thing.
You know,

1844
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:04,990
she's,
she's got an eye for it,

1845
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,824
she understands it.
But I have friends whose wives hate 

1846
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:12,350
comedy and they do stand up and it's 
quick,

1847
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,193
it's easy.
And they associate comedy with like 

1848
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:19,510
taking their boyfriend away or taking 
their husband away.

1849
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,870
Like this is that thing that takes away 
my time,

1850
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:25,000
you know,
from me with him.

1851
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:27,790
Now he's off doing these joke things.
Fucking bullshit.

1852
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:30,340
So it's super selfish.
You need this,

1853
01:16:30,341 --> 01:16:31,600
you need a better woman.

1854
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:33,970
Someone who's deeper yet.
Well,

1855
01:16:33,971 --> 01:16:37,770
you just fucking settle.
They just settle.

1856
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:40,530
They settle my what my.
Anyway,

1857
01:16:40,531 --> 01:16:41,470
I,
there's so many.

1858
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:44,630
I have to,
I forget where out of show sometimes and

1859
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:49,180
he'll probably hear this.
And so,

1860
01:16:49,181 --> 01:16:51,640
um,
when I started comedy,

1861
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:52,810
uh,
I was dating this girl,

1862
01:16:52,811 --> 01:16:55,360
sweet,
sweet girl and she wanted to get married

1863
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,340
like you would expect,
right?

1864
01:16:57,341 --> 01:16:58,174
So I was 24 at the time.
I was six years to get out of college 

1865
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:04,810
and um,
so she bought me a suit so I could go on

1866
01:17:04,811 --> 01:17:05,644
interviews to get a job.
She wanted me to get a job and I had 

1867
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:10,340
started doing comedy

1868
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:11,173
that the right then.
And so about six months into doing 

1869
01:17:14,331 --> 01:17:15,164
comedy,
I started getting Saturday night spots 

1870
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:19,010
at a real club.
They would let me go do 10 minutes,

1871
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:19,844
not paid,
but I could do it on the regular show 

1872
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:22,330
guests set.
That's huge.

1873
01:17:22,331 --> 01:17:24,380
I thought,
oh my God,

1874
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:25,910
are you kidding me?
It's a godsend.

1875
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:28,790
So we go out loud part.
Yes.

1876
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:30,890
So on a Saturday night I take her with 
me,

1877
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:31,753
we're going to the,
it was called the comedy cottage and I 

1878
01:17:35,031 --> 01:17:37,910
do my set and there was lots of other 
like,

1879
01:17:37,911 --> 01:17:38,744
um,
new new comics like me and they were 

1880
01:17:40,451 --> 01:17:41,530
like,
oh Jimmy,

1881
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,530
you know,
that was great.

1882
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,230
That was a big deal.
It's a big deal for us.

1883
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:48,020
One of our own got on and,
and in the car ride home,

1884
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,830
she's not saying anything and finally 
she just turns to me and she goes,

1885
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:53,720
you're really gonna do this,
aren't you?

1886
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:55,970
I go,
fuck,

1887
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:58,310
yes.
Did you just see what happened?

1888
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:00,770
Of course I'm doing this.
What does that mean?

1889
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:01,663
That she was like,
she knew that I was going to be a 

1890
01:18:03,081 --> 01:18:05,900
comedian and not married to her and 
that's what that meant.

1891
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,940
Wow.
You couldn't be both.

1892
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:12,440
Not then I couldn't get married.
Even if I couldn't get married.

1893
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:13,740
Jim Brewer is married.

1894
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:15,920
The same girl he's with.
When I met him,

1895
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:21,550
I met Jim in 1991 and two happy kids the
whole deal.

1896
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,470
Super happy.
She's super nice.

1897
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:25,383
I didn't.
So the problem with standup comedy is 

1898
01:18:26,561 --> 01:18:28,420
you don't know where you're gonna end up
of course.

1899
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:29,890
So when you start,
you don't know,

1900
01:18:29,891 --> 01:18:31,480
can I even do five minutes?
And then we're like,

1901
01:18:31,481 --> 01:18:33,220
what can I do 15?
Can I get paid?

1902
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,080
Can I do an MC?
Can I be consistent?

1903
01:18:35,081 --> 01:18:36,970
Can I middle can I hadn't read.
I don't know.

1904
01:18:36,971 --> 01:18:39,100
Can I work in a room?
Can I get on TV?

1905
01:18:39,101 --> 01:18:40,660
You don't know.
You don't know.

1906
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,310
You don't like.
If you go to any other job,

1907
01:18:42,311 --> 01:18:42,761
you go,
well,

1908
01:18:42,761 --> 01:18:44,140
if you do this,
this and this,

1909
01:18:44,141 --> 01:18:45,770
then you'll get the promotion and then 
get that.

1910
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:47,470
You have to meet your number and then 
you get,

1911
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:47,831
oh,
okay.

1912
01:18:47,831 --> 01:18:49,250
I can meet my numbers.
This.

1913
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:50,970
There's no handbook.
No.

1914
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,240
Even

1915
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,330
to this day,
like my.

1916
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:53,223
My agent called me to schedule something
in New York for November and I said I 

1917
01:18:58,081 --> 01:18:59,640
can't,
and I said,

1918
01:18:59,641 --> 01:19:00,474
I'm doing my special in April.
I don't know if I'm going to have an 

1919
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:04,920
hour by November.
I assume I will,

1920
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,720
but I don't know.
I go,

1921
01:19:06,721 --> 01:19:07,200
I can't.
I can't.

1922
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:11,660
I'm not going to fuck people over at 
some big fucking theater and not have an

1923
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:12,493
hour yet.
I'm gonna.

1924
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:13,860
I'm gonna.
Do my best,

1925
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,810
but may June,
July,

1926
01:19:15,811 --> 01:19:17,160
August,
September,

1927
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:17,521
October,
November,

1928
01:19:17,521 --> 01:19:18,354
seven months.
Most likely I'll have a new our most 

1929
01:19:20,401 --> 01:19:22,470
likely,
but what if I only have a half hour?

1930
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:25,860
What if I only have an half an hour 
fucking bomb?

1931
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:29,730
What if I do half an hour of good comedy
but not the best?

1932
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:33,030
And then have nothing,
I can't take that risk.

1933
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,680
Like when I'm ready I'll call yet.
So when April rolls around,

1934
01:19:37,681 --> 01:19:40,020
after I'm done and I chuck everything 
aside,

1935
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:44,310
I'm on a fucking rampage for like three,
four months of just doing 10,

1936
01:19:44,311 --> 01:19:45,144
15 minutes spots,
writing a bunch of new shit and trying 

1937
01:19:47,671 --> 01:19:48,504
to piece together an hour.
Then it's going to take me a month or 

1938
01:19:50,641 --> 01:19:51,474
two to try to sort that our out to 
figure out where everything goes and 

1939
01:19:54,511 --> 01:19:56,850
what the punchlines are.
Listening to recordings,

1940
01:19:56,851 --> 01:20:00,000
writing things down,
burning the midnight oil late at night.

1941
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:01,710
This is,
I don't know if I could do it.

1942
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,750
I mean I'm assuming you do it,
but once I chucked my act,

1943
01:20:04,751 --> 01:20:07,560
decide once the act that you saw that 
you thought was funny,

1944
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:08,160
that fucking

1945
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,110
things going to the toilet.
It's over.

1946
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:11,243
So over baby.
I'm lucky in the sense that no one saw 

1947
01:20:14,251 --> 01:20:15,084
my last special.
So I think to do those jokes I get to 

1948
01:20:16,681 --> 01:20:19,230
keep doing those job.
What about your fans know?

1949
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:20,520
So I did.
This is funny,

1950
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:22,560
right?
So I did a to comedy central specials.

1951
01:20:22,561 --> 01:20:25,380
Then I did,
my last one was for Hulu and it was in I

1952
01:20:25,381 --> 01:20:29,040
think 20,
15 maybe or 1415 and uh,

1953
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,180
so,
uh,

1954
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:31,283
so because of my youtube show I'd sell 
tickets now so people come out and so I 

1955
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:35,694
got a,
I was doing a show maybe six months ago 

1956
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:43,220
and I do the opening joke from my 
special and it kills and I go,

1957
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,400
you motherfuckers,
none of you saw my special.

1958
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,590
And then I was upset for a second and 
then I was like,

1959
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,240
oh,
I get to do those jokes again.

1960
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:56,143
I'm going to do my own special and put 
it out on my own thing because I don't 

1961
01:20:59,341 --> 01:21:01,220
know where that even like that Hulu 
special.

1962
01:21:01,221 --> 01:21:03,180
It's only,
it lives on Hulu somewhere.

1963
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:05,280
Is Hulu is still a thing?
It's still a thing.

1964
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,300
Well,
Hulu was still a thing.

1965
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,430
I'm thinking of CSO.
CSO is not a thing anymore.

1966
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:08,941
Yeah.
I don't know.

1967
01:21:08,941 --> 01:21:10,020
Lisa went under.
Yeah.

1968
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,530
That sort of Stan hope at a special.
Diaz had express.

1969
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:13,680
Really?
Yeah.

1970
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:14,593
A bunch of guys who were really funny.
People had specials on seesaw and now 

1971
01:21:18,371 --> 01:21:20,160
see,
so is it doesn't exist.

1972
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:21,570
Oh yeah,
I've heard about that.

1973
01:21:21,571 --> 01:21:22,650
Going under.
Yeah,

1974
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:23,910
they've tried it.
A bunch of.

1975
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:25,940
Cecil was a Sony thing,
right?

1976
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,330
Wasn't it?
Or was it NBC?

1977
01:21:27,331 --> 01:21:28,350
NBC,
NBC.

1978
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:29,270
I think you're right.
Yeah.

1979
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:32,070
Now like Sony had crackle.
Right.

1980
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:33,743
That's just such a funny.
I was thinking that Qualif Tompkins bit 

1981
01:21:35,731 --> 01:21:37,560
about crackle,
crackle.

1982
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:39,870
I can't remember how it went,
but only if they're called crack crack.

1983
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,870
We cute and so funny.
I couldn't remember how it.

1984
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,990
It's so funny.
Uh,

1985
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:48,910
yeah.
Well it's now.

1986
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:51,300
Then I got to tell Ya.
I was happier before.

1987
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,433
What do you mean?
I was happier when my whole life was 

1988
01:21:54,241 --> 01:21:55,074
ahead of me and like when I first 
started hanging out a largo and doing 

1989
01:21:57,331 --> 01:22:01,320
sets at the Improv and being in and 
meeting all my heroes in comedy,

1990
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:02,543
like to me that was a headier time.
Now it's like I feel pressure to stay 

1991
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:10,300
on,
stay where I'm at or be successful.

1992
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:13,980
I don't know what it is I feel,
but I feel like I'm working too hard and

1993
01:22:13,981 --> 01:22:17,580
I'm not able to enjoy what I've 
accomplished and that's why I've been,

1994
01:22:17,581 --> 01:22:18,810
um,
I've been trying to,

1995
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,200
like I told you,
he showed me that,

1996
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:20,820
that tank.

1997
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:22,680
I've been trying to figure out how to 
stop my thoughts.

1998
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:24,210
You can come into a tank anytime you 
want.

1999
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,141
Don't sit.
No,

2000
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:27,930
don't come into the tank.
But you could because people do do that.

2001
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:32,660
There's a tank center,
a place,

2002
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:35,340
a find out the name of that place.
Give them a shout out.

2003
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:39,570
So the float lab in Venice is my spot.
That's the spot that built my tank.

2004
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:40,643
They have a place in Westwood and they 
are the best in the world and they 

2005
01:22:42,631 --> 01:22:45,300
actually supply the tanks to the place 
in Pasadena.

2006
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:47,130
The guy who will put this,
my friend crash,

2007
01:22:47,131 --> 01:22:47,964
who put it in our studio just float,
just float is the place in Pasadena and 

2008
01:22:51,181 --> 01:22:53,880
I'm pretty sure it's the largest float 
center in the world.

2009
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:57,210
So does that help you stop thinking?
No,

2010
01:22:57,211 --> 01:22:59,640
the opposite I think in there,
but I relax.

2011
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:00,663
It's very relaxing physically because 
the water's warm and you float and you 

2012
01:23:04,741 --> 01:23:06,010
can do it after the show if you want.
I got

2013
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,790
another show that goes until two if you 
want.

2014
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:10,730
You totally can.
Thank you for the album.

2015
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:13,330
Going to be the second person outside of
me to be in there.

2016
01:23:13,331 --> 01:23:15,190
Dan Harris from ABC.
Good morning.

2017
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:16,840
America is the only other guy that's 
been in there.

2018
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:18,603
Dan is a big meditation proponent,
so I tried meditating and it just hurts 

2019
01:23:21,971 --> 01:23:22,804
my back and oh well that will be really 
good for your back because it's become 

2020
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:27,124
weightless.
You just float in there and the water's 

2021
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:29,553
the same temperature as the surface of 
your skin so you don't feel the water 

2022
01:23:31,451 --> 01:23:33,220
after awhile and you're,
you know,

2023
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:36,160
you're in total darkness and total 
silence and you just chill out in there,

2024
01:23:36,161 --> 01:23:37,530
man.
It feels.

2025
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:38,513
It feels good.

2026
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:39,720
Okay,
I got to do it.

2027
01:23:39,721 --> 01:23:40,554
I gotta do something.
You know where I've heard this thing by 

2028
01:23:45,541 --> 01:23:48,700
Alan Watts and he talked about how we 
know,

2029
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,960
we know how to prepare for life.
We don't know how to enjoy life.

2030
01:23:51,961 --> 01:23:52,794
Once it gets here,

2031
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:54,680
you gotta get good at that,
man.

2032
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:55,331
That's,
that's,

2033
01:23:55,331 --> 01:23:56,164
uh,
something that you really need to 

2034
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:59,170
concentrate on the.
I don't know.

2035
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:02,600
I know you're doing really well right 
now and I'm a fan of yours,

2036
01:24:02,601 --> 01:24:05,870
so when you say you're not happy,
that bums me out.

2037
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,040
I'm stressed.
Yeah.

2038
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:09,080
Well you gotta figure out a way to enjoy
this.

2039
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:10,910
I know.
That's what I'm trying to be more silly.

2040
01:24:10,911 --> 01:24:13,820
Just smoke weed.
We'll smoke a little bit more.

2041
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,970
Just just enjoy it a little bit more,
you know,

2042
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,833
just smoking weed in the morning and now
I can't because I have to fucking do 

2043
01:24:20,991 --> 01:24:21,411
stuff.
Oh,

2044
01:24:21,411 --> 01:24:23,300
you definitely can.
Yeah,

2045
01:24:23,301 --> 01:24:25,940
you'd have to trust me.
It can be done,

2046
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:29,720
but then I can't do anything.
You can know you can.

2047
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:31,670
Um.
Do you exercise a?

2048
01:24:31,671 --> 01:24:32,750
No,
I can't exercise.

2049
01:24:32,751 --> 01:24:34,370
That's the problem.
I used to be athletic.

2050
01:24:34,371 --> 01:24:35,630
I used to love them at all.

2051
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:37,640
Because your gallbladder?
No because of my bones.

2052
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:40,550
I every once in a while I'll forget I'll
do yoga or anything.

2053
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:41,550
Um,
no.

2054
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,550
My doctor told me don't,
don't do anything.

2055
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,830
Your Dr told me to swim.
Oh,

2056
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:46,510
that's nice.
Yeah,

2057
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:48,680
swimming is great.
So he said I could swim.

2058
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:49,603
Oh,
okay.

2059
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:53,180
So the most boring thing.
Swimming man.

2060
01:24:53,181 --> 01:24:55,530
I like getting high and swimming.
Oh yeah,

2061
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,810
it's fun.
It feels good.

2062
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:58,540
But you,
um,

2063
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:59,623
you can see every exercise like lifting 
weights or anything along those lines 

2064
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:03,553
because your bone issue.
But I would think that lifting weights 

2065
01:25:05,511 --> 01:25:07,040
would enhance your bone density.

2066
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,370
Um,
it just hurts.

2067
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:13,490
So I can't,
I can't even pick up a suitcase.

2068
01:25:13,491 --> 01:25:15,290
Really,
really fuck man.

2069
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,140
Have to be,
I forget often and I will then fuck.

2070
01:25:18,141 --> 01:25:19,940
And then my back hurts for the whole day
back.

2071
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:21,870
So yeah,
cause,

2072
01:25:21,871 --> 01:25:22,640
uh,
anyway,

2073
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:25,640
um,
but it's about being coming present.

2074
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:28,580
And I love listen to this guy.
Eckhart tolle.

2075
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,470
Power of now.
Oh book.

2076
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:32,613
Oh did you?
Yeah.

2077
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:37,250
So that is a really getting me a.
she's still alive.

2078
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:38,150
Yeah,
yeah.

2079
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:39,800
Yeah.
So that's really getting me,

2080
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:41,060
you know,
um,

2081
01:25:41,061 --> 01:25:42,890
when things frustrate you.
I love what he says.

2082
01:25:42,891 --> 01:25:44,570
He goes,
the world isn't here to make you happy.

2083
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:46,520
It's here to frustrate you.
So you wake up,

2084
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:48,150
Huh?
Oh,

2085
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:49,431
when I'm like,
oh,

2086
01:25:49,431 --> 01:25:50,264
so now you can use your frustrations as 
reminders to wake up and so whenever 

2087
01:25:55,131 --> 01:25:56,410
something,
and it's hard because,

2088
01:25:56,411 --> 01:25:57,070
you know,
I,

2089
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:59,590
I have a temper and I,
uh,

2090
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,440
and that's the weird thing.
Now I,

2091
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:03,703
I hid my temper,
my anger through my standup and I was 

2092
01:26:06,471 --> 01:26:08,780
successful.
I had specials and everything,

2093
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:11,540
but now I don't hide it and now I'm 
really sick.

2094
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:12,740
Now I'm selling tickets.
Right.

2095
01:26:12,741 --> 01:26:14,840
Because that's the ultimate goal is if 
you could sell tickets,

2096
01:26:14,841 --> 01:26:17,090
then you don't need anybody and yeah.

2097
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,173
Why?
It seems like there's some sort of 

2098
01:26:19,431 --> 01:26:20,264
internal conflict between you getting 
angry and ranting and talking about 

2099
01:26:24,081 --> 01:26:24,914
things that are very important to you 
and then going on stage and doing 

2100
01:26:26,991 --> 01:26:27,824
standup.
I don't think that they should be 

2101
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:29,550
mutually

2102
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:30,201
inclusive.
No,

2103
01:26:30,201 --> 01:26:33,210
I'm trying to bring them together and 
then my wife would always tell me,

2104
01:26:33,211 --> 01:26:35,730
you got to rent on your set,
upset you gotta read,

2105
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,500
you gotta get angry.
And I was like,

2106
01:26:37,501 --> 01:26:39,510
okay,
well I would never really do it.

2107
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:40,603
Well you just got to balance it out.
Just going to find out a way to make 

2108
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:43,430
that ramp.
Funny,

2109
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:44,390
and then,
you know,

2110
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:49,250
find perspectives that are relatable 
where you go into this rant,

2111
01:26:49,251 --> 01:26:51,620
but then bring it to these people in a 
digestible way,

2112
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:52,820
you know?
Yeah,

2113
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:53,850
yeah.
Um,

2114
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,513
what's happening is I'm showing videos 
now at my live show and those get me 

2115
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:03,080
into that groove and I just dropped a 
video kind of videos.

2116
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,093
Like I just dropped a video about it.
I did a live show at the flappers in 

2117
01:27:07,791 --> 01:27:08,710
Burbank and I did,
uh,

2118
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:09,813
uh,
I showed a video of Keith Olbermann 

2119
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:15,770
apologizing to John Mccain and George 
Bush on the view and that.

2120
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:17,710
Yeah,
what does,

2121
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,130
what does that.
So He,

2122
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:20,330
I dunno,
he's trying to.

2123
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:23,000
He was talking to Megan Mccain and this 
recently,

2124
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:23,863
this was a couple months ago,
he going crazy because he retired from 

2125
01:27:26,451 --> 01:27:27,860
that show that he was doing it in a 
basement.

2126
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:31,550
So trump excites the lizard brain of a 
certain kind of neo liberal.

2127
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,520
And Olbermann is certainly one of those 
guys.

2128
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:35,593
He pretends all the problems in our 
country started on January 2017 and 

2129
01:27:39,201 --> 01:27:40,940
that's certainly not it.
Like he was great.

2130
01:27:40,941 --> 01:27:41,774
He could deconstruct what was wrong with
Hillary Clinton back in 2008 when she 

2131
01:27:44,961 --> 01:27:45,794
was running against Barack Obama and he 
could deconstruct it was wrong with the 

2132
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:50,030
Iraq war and what was wrong with Bush 
and Cheney,

2133
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:51,253
but I don't know.
Somehow all of a sudden now he pretend 

2134
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:55,740
it's like again,
he trump excites,

2135
01:27:55,741 --> 01:27:59,750
says lizard brain and all his critical 
thinking skills go out the window and he

2136
01:27:59,751 --> 01:28:00,584
pretends that all our protest,
trump is the problem and not a symptom 

2137
01:28:02,691 --> 01:28:03,410
of the problem.
Well,

2138
01:28:03,410 --> 01:28:04,100
it was a scene

2139
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:04,933
in a movie when he was doing that.
It looked like he was doing a show in 

2140
01:28:07,191 --> 01:28:08,024
the basement somewhere with this weird 
background who was called the 

2141
01:28:11,001 --> 01:28:12,980
resistance,
the resistance,

2142
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:14,780
but he was also.
He didn't.

2143
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:15,973
Wasn't making connections like was that 
law that really a pretty conservative 

2144
01:28:21,441 --> 01:28:23,420
girl.
Tammy Lauren,

2145
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:26,720
is that her name?
She did a thing where she was covered in

2146
01:28:26,721 --> 01:28:27,554
the American flag and he was talking 
about how hypocritical it is to be 

2147
01:28:31,221 --> 01:28:34,160
standing there holding draping yourself 
in the American flag.

2148
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:39,550
And then Donald Trump jr posts a picture
of Tammy Lauren right next to him.

2149
01:28:40,161 --> 01:28:43,640
Doing the same thing and Donald Trump jr
says,

2150
01:28:43,641 --> 01:28:47,130
it must be painful to be so stupid.
Like in like,

2151
01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:48,003
well,
I don't even understand how he could 

2152
01:28:48,871 --> 01:28:51,950
have not known.
He took that picture to be draped in it.

2153
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:52,813
Yes.
Like how could he not know that he took 

2154
01:28:54,021 --> 01:28:57,290
that picture?
So he admitted on so smart.

2155
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:58,150
Well,
that's the thing.

2156
01:28:58,150 --> 01:29:00,050
Listen to him.
He's incredibly articulate.

2157
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:02,550
He's A.
I love the skill

2158
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:07,640
in which he writes is a great form.
Was my key dormant.

2159
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:08,700
That's the whole thing.
Yeah.

2160
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,010
I was a huge fan.
Yeah.

2161
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:13,860
It was great with sports.
I mean he's sort of old school lead type

2162
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:15,023
delivery that I enjoy.
He's a great broadcaster and you always 

2163
01:29:17,581 --> 01:29:20,880
hear stories about his idiosyncrasies,
like he's a prick to work with and stuff

2164
01:29:20,881 --> 01:29:21,611
and you go,
well fuck.

2165
01:29:21,611 --> 01:29:22,590
I gave.
What are you going to do?

2166
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:23,221
So who cares?
I don't.

2167
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:24,630
I don't work with them.
I want to watch them.

2168
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:26,183
Right.
Well that's the truth with a lot of 

2169
01:29:27,331 --> 01:29:28,164
people that are apparently.
One of the things about being great at 

2170
01:29:31,291 --> 01:29:34,140
something is a lot of it.
You're fucking fanatical about it.

2171
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:35,003
You get crazy,
completely obsessed and something is 

2172
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:38,373
embedded.
Your people skills are out the window 

2173
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:43,140
because you're so completely 
concentrated on something else.

2174
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:44,340
Yes.
Yeah.

2175
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:45,390
So I could,
uh,

2176
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:47,130
so he,
he apologized.

2177
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:52,290
He said that Donald trump was worse than
nine slash 11 and Megan Mccain said,

2178
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:53,280
do you really believe that?
And,

2179
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:54,303
and his big comeback to that was your 
father was my favorite political figure 

2180
01:29:57,631 --> 01:29:59,130
of the 21st century.
And I'm like,

2181
01:29:59,131 --> 01:30:00,870
really?
Who was the second Bernie Madoff?

2182
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:01,733
Are you fucking kidding me?
John Mccain's a warmonger who thrust 

2183
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:05,253
him?
Sarah Pailin on us and playing poker 

2184
01:30:08,101 --> 01:30:10,470
while they were trying to decide the 
fate of live.

2185
01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:12,280
Remember that whole thing?
We'll talk.

2186
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:14,530
Do you remember that thing or John 
Mccain?

2187
01:30:14,531 --> 01:30:15,364
There were in the middle of what was the
exact scenario that they were in the 

2188
01:30:19,201 --> 01:30:20,034
middle of some meeting in the Senate and
they were deciding something incredibly 

2189
01:30:23,101 --> 01:30:25,910
important and they busted mccain playing
poker.

2190
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:27,630
No area.
Yeah,

2191
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:28,464
it was about bombing Syria.
Look at this because he's four he 

2192
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,770
doesn't do is it doesn't need to hear 
that look.

2193
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:34,800
They're playing poker war games.

2194
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,950
Mccain caught playing poker on iphone 
during Syria debate.

2195
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:42,450
Just fucking imagine the type of person 
that could do that.

2196
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:43,723
You're in the middle of talking about 
dropping bombs that are going to kill 

2197
01:30:47,401 --> 01:30:47,910
people.
Yeah.

2198
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:48,743
They're absolutely going to kill people 
and they're gonna be come flying out of 

2199
01:30:50,641 --> 01:30:53,550
fucking high speed jet and he's either 
playing poker.

2200
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:56,100
This is boring.
Are new to find out if I can get another

2201
01:30:56,101 --> 01:31:01,101
ace.
The whole baby up my stream suck on it.

2202
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,290
I mean,
so this is what I saw.

2203
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:04,133
And he called brand Paul a Putin puppet 
because he was against Ukraine joining 

2204
01:31:07,051 --> 01:31:07,884
NATO.
I mean that's what jumped decker Kinda 

2205
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:09,571
Shit.
John Mccain,

2206
01:31:09,571 --> 01:31:10,800
John Mccain,
you know,

2207
01:31:10,801 --> 01:31:13,380
there might be I,
I said this at a live show.

2208
01:31:13,381 --> 01:31:14,850
I go,
I don't disrespect to service.

2209
01:31:14,851 --> 01:31:17,870
Nobody disrespects the surface except 
the president said it stayed,

2210
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:21,180
which was the craziest thing ever.
I like people don't get caught.

2211
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:22,920
I was like,
how the fuck can you say that?

2212
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,900
So much of the shit that he has said 
just bounces off of,

2213
01:31:25,901 --> 01:31:26,550
um,
like,

2214
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:27,510
um,
I was at,

2215
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:28,373
I was at the comedy store the other 
night and somebody was trying to say 

2216
01:31:30,391 --> 01:31:31,780
that,
that stormy weathers chick,

2217
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:33,060
is that her name?
Stormy weather.

2218
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:35,220
Stormy Daniels.
Sorry,

2219
01:31:35,221 --> 01:31:36,630
sorry.
Stormy weather.

2220
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:39,990
It's a fuck.
Was saying it.

2221
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,750
What the fuck was saying it?
Um,

2222
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:43,710
Africa who said it,
but they were saying,

2223
01:31:43,890 --> 01:31:46,530
oh,
she's our Monica Lewinsky.

2224
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:48,600
And I was like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

2225
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:52,070
That stormy Daniels is going to tank 
top.

2226
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,220
I'm like,
you're out of your fucking mind.

2227
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,200
I go,
it's going to go right off his skin like

2228
01:31:55,201 --> 01:31:58,200
a water on a duck.
It's not even going to affect at all.

2229
01:31:58,201 --> 01:32:00,280
He's going to say fake never happened.

2230
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,010
He's going to keep moving.
And that's gonna be the end of it.

2231
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:04,570
And he's like,
no fucking way.

2232
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,460
He's gonna get in trouble for that.
And I'm like,

2233
01:32:06,461 --> 01:32:07,270
no,
he's not.

2234
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:09,370
It's not going to be anything.
You don't understand all the things that

2235
01:32:09,371 --> 01:32:11,530
he's done so far,
grab them by the Pussy.

2236
01:32:11,531 --> 01:32:13,570
All these different things.
It's like Charlie Sheen.

2237
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:14,583
I read an article once that said,
when is the me too movement can hit 

2238
01:32:16,481 --> 01:32:18,100
Charlie Sheen.
I'll answer that.

2239
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,930
Fucking never.
You know why?

2240
01:32:19,931 --> 01:32:23,140
Because you can't shame someone who 
doesn't have any shame.

2241
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:24,280
Right?
It doesn't work.

2242
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,560
That's it.
If someone's not embarrassed,

2243
01:32:26,561 --> 01:32:28,110
you cannot embarrass them.
Right.

2244
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:28,871
You know,
I mean,

2245
01:32:28,871 --> 01:32:29,950
if someone says to you,
hey,

2246
01:32:29,951 --> 01:32:31,900
Jimmy Dore,
what are you a fucking comedian?

2247
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,441
You're like,
yeah,

2248
01:32:32,441 --> 01:32:34,480
I'm a comedian.
People call me dumb.

2249
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:36,460
Yeah.
I call myself dumb.

2250
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:37,740
That doesn't,
that's not going to get.

2251
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:38,470
Doesn't bother me.

2252
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:39,910
Yeah.
You need something more than that.

2253
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,800
Charlie.
You're a fucking whoremonger.

2254
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,160
Uh,
yeah.

2255
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,400
That's what I do.
It's well documented.

2256
01:32:45,401 --> 01:32:47,530
I smoke crack and I bang horse.
Any other questions?

2257
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:48,900
I got to go back.
Horse smoke,

2258
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:50,110
crack.
I don't have time for this.

2259
01:32:50,111 --> 01:32:53,780
I have HIV and that's what I go.
And that's all.

2260
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:55,803
It's not gonna work.
You Know Charlie Sheen is out there 

2261
01:32:57,731 --> 01:32:59,460
doing terrible things to women.
Yeah,

2262
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,540
he pays him.
That's what he does with all that.

2263
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:02,374
Fucking two and a half men money.
That's how I always felt about being a 

2264
01:33:05,201 --> 01:33:06,990
comedian.
Like I,

2265
01:33:07,170 --> 01:33:09,280
I don't play by,
you don't get to judge me,

2266
01:33:09,281 --> 01:33:11,410
I fucking judge you.
Like,

2267
01:33:11,730 --> 01:33:14,190
oh,
you're very aggressive to the point,

2268
01:33:14,191 --> 01:33:15,160
and then shit,
I never,

2269
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:18,940
I never advocated for a war like The 
Washington Post New York Times,

2270
01:33:18,941 --> 01:33:19,774
MSNBC and CNN and you can't.
You're going to judge me over some 

2271
01:33:22,421 --> 01:33:25,630
fucking thing I said,
or did I never advocated for a war.

2272
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:26,463
I never fired a guy who was speaking out
against the war like Msnbc did in the 

2273
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:31,840
New York Times.
WHO DID MSNBC fire?

2274
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:32,703
Phil Donahue.
Phil Donahue had the number one show on 

2275
01:33:34,481 --> 01:33:37,360
the network at the time and they fired 
him because he was against the Iraq war.

2276
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:40,120
That's your.
When they fired him the first time,

2277
01:33:40,121 --> 01:33:44,050
Rachel maddow or Chris Hayes says 
anything that costs MSNBC a nickel,

2278
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:46,180
they will be fucking fired.
Just like.

2279
01:33:46,181 --> 01:33:47,950
And that's why they don't.
They don't.

2280
01:33:47,951 --> 01:33:52,030
And they're paid $30,000 a work day.
30,000.

2281
01:33:52,031 --> 01:33:54,530
Yeah.
That's what she gets a workday day.

2282
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:55,953
Yeah.
And I used to think she dislikes 

2283
01:33:58,650 --> 01:33:59,920
Oberman.
They were fantastic.

2284
01:33:59,921 --> 01:34:02,650
And then trump excites their lizard 
brain and she's lost her mind.

2285
01:34:02,651 --> 01:34:05,640
She's pushing a fucking red scare and 
mccarthyism and she should be,

2286
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:06,753
she should be shunned.
Do you think that she's doing that 

2287
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:12,610
rationally?
Do you think that she is confused,

2288
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:17,560
please being coerced and pushed into 
that sort of that certain direction?

2289
01:34:17,790 --> 01:34:20,270
Um,
I think she's being coerced and push,

2290
01:34:20,271 --> 01:34:23,170
but I think she goes along willingly and
getting that 30,

2291
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:25,720
30 k a day.
She's not going to talk out against,

2292
01:34:25,721 --> 01:34:27,790
make a t shirt.
She's like 30 k a day.

2293
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:28,750
I will.
You can have your way.

2294
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:32,260
I mentioned it all the time.
I show.

2295
01:34:32,261 --> 01:34:34,780
Can I steal that phrase phrase?
Okay.

2296
01:34:34,781 --> 01:34:37,210
I think I may.
I may make a day and you could have your

2297
01:34:37,211 --> 01:34:40,490
way.
The real problem is neo liberalism,

2298
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,333
Joe,
the real problem is the system and 

2299
01:34:42,881 --> 01:34:45,610
they'll never talk about that.
They want also tribalism,

2300
01:34:45,611 --> 01:34:46,444
right?
Anything that opposes the other side 

2301
01:34:47,501 --> 01:34:48,640
must be good.
Right?

2302
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:51,070
In anything you can use on them must be 
good.

2303
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:51,933
Well,
that's what's happening right now with 

2304
01:34:52,361 --> 01:34:53,194
trump and it's disgusting.
It's like there's a way to oppose trump 

2305
01:34:55,901 --> 01:34:58,030
and it's not the way you're doing it.
The fucking will

2306
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:00,470
affect the way they're doing.
It enhances trump.

2307
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:03,620
It makes them more powerful.
You keep coming at him that he'd go with

2308
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:05,990
his guy,
with the battered wife,

2309
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,060
and he gives up.
Meanwhile,

2310
01:35:08,061 --> 01:35:11,840
they're spending 160 billion more 
dollars on bombs that nobody wants.

2311
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:14,480
Meanwhile,
half the country is poor or low income.

2312
01:35:14,481 --> 01:35:15,314
Sixty three percent of Americans can't 
afford a thousand dollar emergency in 

2313
01:35:17,721 --> 01:35:19,850
the richest country that face of the 
earth has ever seen.

2314
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,330
All the benefits of this recovery has 
gone to the upper one percent.

2315
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:25,280
People haven't had a raise.
You know,

2316
01:35:25,281 --> 01:35:26,114
I just saw the afl cio was telling you,
people give me shit because I wouldn't 

2317
01:35:29,031 --> 01:35:30,400
vote for Hillary Clinton.
Right?

2318
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:32,230
And I just saw the,
um,

2319
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:34,213
the AFL cio tweeted out last week that 
the union unions have helped give 

2320
01:35:40,521 --> 01:35:42,590
Democrats complete control of 
government,

2321
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:45,140
uh,
four times in the last three decades.

2322
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:47,570
And they have done nothing to help 
unions.

2323
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:50,090
And they're saying vote third party 
they've got.

2324
01:35:50,091 --> 01:35:50,924
They got together with the Teachers 
Union and the postal union and they're 

2325
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:53,901
like,
hey,

2326
01:35:53,901 --> 01:35:54,734
let's reveal voting isn't working.
We have to somehow come up with a third 

2327
01:35:57,861 --> 01:35:58,600
party,
so they're.

2328
01:35:58,600 --> 01:35:59,433
They're talking about it now,
so people who are wagging their finger 

2329
01:36:01,611 --> 01:36:02,091
at me,
I go,

2330
01:36:02,091 --> 01:36:02,924
hey,
even the unions agree with me now that 

2331
01:36:04,071 --> 01:36:04,904
we've got to have a third party,
and if Bernie Sanders would have went 

2332
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:07,813
with a third party instead of propping 
up that corporatist warmonger like he 

2333
01:36:10,251 --> 01:36:12,410
did,
he could have really changed politics in

2334
01:36:12,411 --> 01:36:13,244
America.
If Jill Stein and the Green party would 

2335
01:36:14,511 --> 01:36:17,300
have got 10 or 15 percent of the vote or
even five percent of the vote,

2336
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:18,343
it would have completely changed our 
politics in America because now the 

2337
01:36:20,661 --> 01:36:21,494
Democrats,
they wag their finger at their base and 

2338
01:36:23,571 --> 01:36:24,404
then they move to the right.
Like Hillary Clinton wagged her finger 

2339
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:29,150
at the base and then picked Tim Kaine 
who was to the right of her.

2340
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:31,010
Right.
And so if,

2341
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:31,903
if Bernie Sanders would have went with 
the Greens and they would have made it 

2342
01:36:33,450 --> 01:36:34,970
showing,
now they can't do that.

2343
01:36:34,971 --> 01:36:35,804
They can't dismiss them anymore.
Now they have to come together in a 

2344
01:36:37,611 --> 01:36:38,444
coalition,
but she was doing it in a calculated 

2345
01:36:40,731 --> 01:36:41,564
manner to try to get some Republicans 
that thought that Donald Trump was 

2346
01:36:43,530 --> 01:36:45,530
republican.
Hillary Clinton,

2347
01:36:45,531 --> 01:36:48,110
their whole strategy was work.
Fuck overworking people that we're going

2348
01:36:48,111 --> 01:36:51,680
to try to get white collar Republicans.
That's not what your party is.

2349
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:53,270
There's already a party for those 
people.

2350
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:55,280
There's a part is called the Republican 
Party.

2351
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:58,280
You're supposed to be the party of 
fucking workers and that.

2352
01:36:58,281 --> 01:37:00,500
That's why we don't have an opposition 
party in this country.

2353
01:37:00,501 --> 01:37:01,334
Joe,
and we have to two parties at a pro 

2354
01:37:02,481 --> 01:37:04,370
management.
You know that Nissan.

2355
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:08,810
Nissan has 49 plants around the world.
Three of them are not union.

2356
01:37:08,811 --> 01:37:10,160
You know where those three plants are?

2357
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:13,430
United fucking states.
So we've got a broken system,

2358
01:37:13,431 --> 01:37:16,310
right?
Are are the problem is the Democrats are

2359
01:37:16,311 --> 01:37:18,890
bought by the same people.
They're just a little,

2360
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,090
you know,
and people go,

2361
01:37:20,091 --> 01:37:20,924
why did the Democrats keep caving?
Why didn't they stand up against trump 

2362
01:37:23,301 --> 01:37:25,130
for Daca?
They're not caving.

2363
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:29,210
They're standing up to you the voter,
and they're standing up to their donors.

2364
01:37:29,230 --> 01:37:30,063
Their donors don't want the government 
shut down for one minute and that's 

2365
01:37:32,361 --> 01:37:33,194
where they're standing up for.
They could have stood up for the voters 

2366
01:37:35,481 --> 01:37:37,610
and and stood up for Daca,
but they didn't.

2367
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:40,820
They stood up for their donors,
so it's not like they're spineless.

2368
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:41,654
They appeared spineless because it looks
like they're not doing what they're 

2369
01:37:44,181 --> 01:37:45,830
supposed to or what they say they're 
not,

2370
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,570
and they're not doing what they said 
they would do,

2371
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:48,404
which is stand up for the people,
but they're secretly standing up for 

2372
01:37:51,081 --> 01:37:53,780
their donors.
They have a steel spine when it comes to

2373
01:37:53,781 --> 01:37:54,614
their donors,
which is why they gave the trump 

2374
01:37:55,651 --> 01:37:56,880
$160,000,000,000.

2375
01:37:57,570 --> 01:37:59,750
Can I make one last point about Donald 
Trump?

2376
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:02,250
So this shows you how they're full of 
shit.

2377
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:03,443
When you say Donald Trump is an 
existential threat to our country and a 

2378
01:38:05,911 --> 01:38:06,744
maniac and he has his finger on the 
button and then you vote to give them 

2379
01:38:09,181 --> 01:38:12,630
$160,000,000,000 more in bombs.
I think you're full of shit.

2380
01:38:12,631 --> 01:38:13,464
When you say he's existential maniac.
When you say that this guy is unhinged 

2381
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:17,934
and you can't be trusted,
and then you vote to expand his 

2382
01:38:20,341 --> 01:38:21,174
warrantless wiretapping and spying 
powers on his own enemies in the 

2383
01:38:23,851 --> 01:38:26,160
country,
that's what I know in your fullest shit,

2384
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:28,200
because if they really wanted to check 
trump,

2385
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:30,510
they would check him on the military,
the Pentagon budget,

2386
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:33,450
and his spying powers and they've 
expanded all that stuff,

2387
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:34,403
so if he's really a maniac,
those motherfuckers are the most 

2388
01:38:36,121 --> 01:38:36,954
irresponsible people in the world.
Giving him all this extra power for the 

2389
01:38:39,481 --> 01:38:40,314
Pentagon and spike,
but they know the only reason they hate 

2390
01:38:42,211 --> 01:38:43,890
trump because ain't part of their 
fucking club.

2391
01:38:45,850 --> 01:38:46,683
Jimmy door just laid it down.
Now you're going to get hate mail from 

2392
01:38:49,441 --> 01:38:50,940
people that are Hillary Clinton 
supporters.

2393
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,080
Yeah,
come.

2394
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,040
I hope you're ready.
Yeah,

2395
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,193
but getting it my since 2016 thing that 
always killed me about Hillary Clinton 

2396
01:38:57,631 --> 01:39:00,600
more than when or when I would talk to 
Super Democrats,

2397
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:03,510
like people that were just completely 
tribal there on the democratic side,

2398
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:05,070
no matter what I go,
you know,

2399
01:39:05,071 --> 01:39:07,900
she didn't support gay marriage until 
2001.

2400
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:08,730
Yeah.
She,

2401
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:09,563
you know,
there was a sexual harasser and her 

2402
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:12,600
campaign in 2008 and she didn't fire the
fucking guy.

2403
01:39:12,601 --> 01:39:13,434
In fact,
she covered for him and anyone onto 

2404
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:18,090
sexually harassed again in another 
organization tied to Hillary Clinton.

2405
01:39:18,091 --> 01:39:18,924
Correct.
The record.

2406
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:20,550
Yeah.
Well the problem is,

2407
01:39:20,551 --> 01:39:21,384
I think when you're close to her,
you find out all the dirty details 

2408
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:26,880
what's going on behind the scenes and 
it's just a creepy,

2409
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,040
creepy organization.
She was the.

2410
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:33,900
She was such a flawed person for 
feminists to wrap their flag around.

2411
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:35,460
She.
She's not the person.

2412
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:37,290
There was another woman running in that 
race.

2413
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:38,970
It was Jill Stein.
I voted for her.

2414
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:41,640
Nobody cared about her though.
That was a weird one.

2415
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:42,513
It's because trump,
it was exactly what Hillary Clinton 

2416
01:39:43,831 --> 01:39:45,390
wanted.
The Pied Piper Strategy.

2417
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,373
You can't even entertain not voting for 
Hillary Clinton because of this 

2418
01:39:49,231 --> 01:39:52,350
existential threat of trump and he's 
such an existential threat.

2419
01:39:52,351 --> 01:39:53,184
We're going to vote to expand its buying
powers and given by bullet of military 

2420
01:39:55,561 --> 01:39:56,080
budget.
Well,

2421
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:56,913
we saw this Hashtag.
I'm with her stuff to where they wanted 

2422
01:39:58,831 --> 01:40:02,100
to have one female president.
That would be a historical victory.

2423
01:40:02,101 --> 01:40:05,340
That's why so many people were crying on
television because they were watching an

2424
01:40:05,341 --> 01:40:06,174
avengers movie.
They weren't really involved in the 

2425
01:40:07,831 --> 01:40:08,664
actual political process itself.
They didn't understand what was 

2426
01:40:10,741 --> 01:40:12,900
happening and they didn't understand who
she really was.

2427
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:14,333
That's it from the beginning to the end,
and if you go and there's just so much 

2428
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:18,720
evidence.
You remember that off camera interview,

2429
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:20,940
which she was talking about Kadafi.
We came,

2430
01:40:20,941 --> 01:40:25,080
we saw he died.
She's laughing like psychopath.

2431
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:27,930
What kind of a person is that?
That's a crazy person now in Libya.

2432
01:40:27,931 --> 01:40:29,550
It's a failed state.
Exactly.

2433
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:32,340
It's a failed state.
It's a haven for terrorists.

2434
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:34,730
Slavery's back.
See that shit?

2435
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:35,603
Yes.
On Youtube you can watch slave trade in 

2436
01:40:38,791 --> 01:40:39,490
Libya.
That's,

2437
01:40:39,490 --> 01:40:41,510
that's her success story.
Yeah,

2438
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:43,440
it's,
it's her horrific.

2439
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:45,380
But don't you let me ask you a question.
Uh,

2440
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:46,201
Joe,
uh,

2441
01:40:46,201 --> 01:40:48,770
I dunno if you like my.
One of my big things is,

2442
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:49,663
is the reason why I have a show is 
because mainstream news media sucks so 

2443
01:40:52,291 --> 01:40:53,950
bad.
And the reason you have this show

2444
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,990
is because late night talk shows suck so
bad,

2445
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:57,213
right?
And,

2446
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:59,050
and it's,
it's established stuck.

2447
01:40:59,210 --> 01:41:00,043
They have commercials and they have 
these things that they do and they have 

2448
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:05,300
never had this conversation.
Now you would.

2449
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,800
They would.
Someone would come and Jimmy.

2450
01:41:06,801 --> 01:41:08,000
Joe,
listen,

2451
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:10,650
you can't listen.
This is not the time for this.

2452
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:12,140
Just want to talk about this in your own
time.

2453
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:14,760
At the time,
Hillary is this,

2454
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:15,643
a lot of Hillary supporters on staff and
they're very upset right now and they 

2455
01:41:17,631 --> 01:41:20,930
feel that you guys were massage and see.
Did you see Jimmy Fallon?

2456
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:21,793
No,
I don't know Jimmy Fallon and I've only 

2457
01:41:23,391 --> 01:41:25,150
bumped into him and he's always been a 
gentleman.

2458
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:25,993
Nice Guy,
a gentleman and a nice guy and nothing 

2459
01:41:28,311 --> 01:41:30,840
bad to say about Jimmy Fallon,
but they did a,

2460
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:33,440
um,
a segment where they had Hillary Clinton

2461
01:41:33,441 --> 01:41:34,274
on and her writer's could in his writers
came out and they all wrote thank you 

2462
01:41:36,891 --> 01:41:39,140
notes and they read them to Hillary 
Clinton.

2463
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:41,180
And at first I'm like,
this is going to be hilarious.

2464
01:41:41,870 --> 01:41:43,940
And then it wasn't,
it was actually sincerely.

2465
01:41:43,941 --> 01:41:44,774
They were thanking her for what?
For being then running for fucking 

2466
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:49,820
brick.

2467
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:53,420
The fact he got shot him and left his 
wallet and his has watched there.

2468
01:41:53,421 --> 01:41:55,820
That was amazing.
That was a botched robbery,

2469
01:41:55,821 --> 01:41:57,550
Joe and yeah,
sure.

2470
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:59,260
Four o'clock in the morning.
Did you see that?

2471
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:01,910
Took anything from um,
see Donna Brazil happened to leak.

2472
01:42:01,911 --> 01:42:03,470
So yeah,
she called him a fucking hero.

2473
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:05,850
Donna Brazil said that that was scared 
her to death.

2474
01:42:05,851 --> 01:42:08,160
She started pulling the blinds in her 
office.

2475
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:09,053
She should.
So now the Washington Post this what I 

2476
01:42:10,381 --> 01:42:11,214
wanted to ask you,
they wrote a whole thing about how 

2477
01:42:13,081 --> 01:42:14,970
anybody who questions seth rich is 
crazy.

2478
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:15,480
Of course

2479
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:16,313
they do that they make you look like 
you're a fool because it's a conspiracy 

2480
01:42:18,541 --> 01:42:21,210
theory.
And can you say conspiracy theory,

2481
01:42:21,211 --> 01:42:23,160
conspiracy theorist,
and you're wack job.

2482
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:26,270
But what is one big conspiracy theory?
Right?

2483
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:28,260
But just put it down on paper.
Let's just look at what.

2484
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:29,343
Look at real hard facts.
Seth rich was a Bernie Sanders 

2485
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:35,760
supporter.
Seth rich was a Patriot seth,

2486
01:42:35,761 --> 01:42:38,460
which according to Julian assange and 
wikileaks,

2487
01:42:38,461 --> 01:42:39,294
which have not been proven to be liars,
never had to retract anything they 

2488
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:42,780
printed.
They've never had to do that.

2489
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:44,093
He's saying that he leaked stuff to him.
There are consequences leaking stuff to 

2490
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:49,023
wikileaks.
Seth rich was murdered at 4:00 in the 

2491
01:42:51,151 --> 01:42:52,440
morning,
shot in the back.

2492
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:53,333
They said it was a botched robbery,
but no one took anything from him and 

2493
01:42:55,651 --> 01:42:57,600
there's never been anyone that's charged
with it.

2494
01:42:57,601 --> 01:43:00,030
And there's no suspects.
I don't know.

2495
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:03,270
I don't know what happened to him,
but that looks very

2496
01:43:03,690 --> 01:43:05,340
well.
You're not even allowed to ask questions

2497
01:43:05,341 --> 01:43:06,174
because I covered that story one day.
I covered it one day because that guy 

2498
01:43:09,421 --> 01:43:11,310
wheeler came out and he was saying he 
had all this.

2499
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:15,180
He saw the computer and all this stuff.
So I covered that in your piece of shit.

2500
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:18,720
And you're a conspiracy theorist.
In that video I did.

2501
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:21,050
I literally said,
uh,

2502
01:43:21,450 --> 01:43:24,180
I don't know if this is true.
We're waiting for evidence,

2503
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:27,030
unlike the mainstream news media with 
their Russia bullshit.

2504
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:30,750
We're gonna wait for evidence.
I literally said that inside that.

2505
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:32,033
And then the next day I did another 
video which debunk that Guy Wheeler who 

2506
01:43:34,351 --> 01:43:35,184
was pushing that,
that story because he turned out he was 

2507
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:39,570
full of Shit.
So what was the response though?

2508
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:42,690
People still to this day,
it's fucking smear.

2509
01:43:42,691 --> 01:43:43,820
Meet with that thing.
Oh,

2510
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:44,700
you pushed it.
I go,

2511
01:43:44,701 --> 01:43:46,050
I covered.
I would do a new show.

2512
01:43:46,051 --> 01:43:48,030
I covered a new show.
By the way,

2513
01:43:48,031 --> 01:43:51,000
why aren't you allowed to ask questions 
about an open murder investigation?

2514
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,010
Not only that,

2515
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,843
this is a re look.
This is a guy who was a real Bernie 

2516
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:58,700
Sanders supporter,
open Bernie Sanders supporter who worked

2517
01:43:58,701 --> 01:43:59,534
for the DNC.
The DNC absolutely rigged the primary 

2518
01:44:02,631 --> 01:44:04,850
against Bernie Sanders.
He was aware of this.

2519
01:44:04,851 --> 01:44:06,410
He was there while this was all going 
down.

2520
01:44:06,530 --> 01:44:08,520
So is Donald Brazil.
Everyone was aware of that.

2521
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:12,350
The guy got fucking murdered after he 
leaked information to wikileaks.

2522
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:14,030
If you don't think that's a little 
weird,

2523
01:44:14,210 --> 01:44:15,790
what are you looking at?
What?

2524
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:18,740
What?
What delusional rose colored glasses.

2525
01:44:18,741 --> 01:44:19,574
Are you looking at your party from a.
You think you're in some Julia Roberts 

2526
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:24,230
movie from Nineteen Ninety.
This is real shit.

2527
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,350
Some guy got killed.
He was 24 years old.

2528
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:28,333
He was a young guy who is very 
optimistic and have this view of the 

2529
01:44:33,831 --> 01:44:37,130
world where he meets the guy fucking 
war,

2530
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:38,023
American flag pants and shirt.
There's a famous picture of him with a 

2531
01:44:41,031 --> 01:44:41,864
beer on me is the Patriot that a lot of 
ways he wanted to be involved in the 

2532
01:44:45,021 --> 01:44:46,070
political process.

2533
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:51,520
He was very idealistic because is.
He was probably shattered by finding out

2534
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:55,340
the party that he was working for was 
corrupting the democratic process.

2535
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:58,630
And because I've said this before,
you know,

2536
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:02,900
I've been accused of helping Donald 
Trump win by really wacky people online,

2537
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:04,850
but pointing out all the flaws of 
Hillary Clinton,

2538
01:45:04,851 --> 01:45:05,361
like,
look,

2539
01:45:05,361 --> 01:45:06,194
man,
you can't ignore that shit because you 

2540
01:45:07,731 --> 01:45:08,564
want one side to.
When I've talked about all of his flaws 

2541
01:45:11,511 --> 01:45:14,210
to it,
there's a lot of flawed human beings are

2542
01:45:14,211 --> 01:45:15,920
run for president pretty much all of 
them.

2543
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:17,023
I mean,
it's very rare you have someone who's 

2544
01:45:17,781 --> 01:45:18,830
not flawed,
right?

2545
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:22,070
Extremely flawed.
We're all flawed but extremely flawed.

2546
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:23,780
Who wants to be the fucking King of the 
world?

2547
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:25,190
It's very rare.
Well,

2548
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:26,390
uh,
you know,

2549
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:29,380
not to change subjects,
but Barack Obama,

2550
01:45:29,381 --> 01:45:31,190
everyone thinks is the greatest guy in 
the world.

2551
01:45:31,210 --> 01:45:32,043
Do you know,
in contrast to Donald Trump because he 

2552
01:45:34,151 --> 01:45:35,830
was polite,
was a statesman,

2553
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:37,110
he was a good speaker,
live site,

2554
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:39,550
but at the end,
but he was polite at the same time.

2555
01:45:39,551 --> 01:45:40,384
He let cops correct the heads of 
peaceful protesters at occupy Wall 

2556
01:45:42,910 --> 01:45:43,743
Street all across the country.
He said he put on a soft shoe to stand 

2557
01:45:45,581 --> 01:45:46,414
up for unions.
He fucked over unions in Wisconsin when 

2558
01:45:48,101 --> 01:45:50,070
they took the teacher's union away,
uh,

2559
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:53,180
he opened the Arctic to drilling twice 
whenever Shell oil won.

2560
01:45:53,181 --> 01:45:54,014
And he said,
okay,

2561
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:56,500
and he only closing one.
They didn't want to do it anymore.

2562
01:45:56,890 --> 01:45:57,723
He took us from two wars to seven.
He cooked out five point 1 million 

2563
01:46:00,281 --> 01:46:02,830
families out of their homes instead of 
helping them.

2564
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:06,040
And he made Wall Street whole 
motherfucking over everyone else.

2565
01:46:06,041 --> 01:46:07,890
So this guy,
he ended,

2566
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:10,150
he made the Bush tax cuts permanent.
So there was,

2567
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:10,901
um,
uh,

2568
01:46:10,901 --> 01:46:11,950
what they say is,
uh,

2569
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:13,870
it looked like it was changing on the 
outside.

2570
01:46:13,871 --> 01:46:14,780
Continuity on the inside.

2571
01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:15,843
Well,
the hope and change website had to be 

2572
01:46:16,871 --> 01:46:17,704
altered because there was all these 
things in there about whistleblowers 

2573
01:46:20,321 --> 01:46:21,820
about.
And then he prosecuted that.

2574
01:46:21,821 --> 01:46:23,520
Exactly.
But he takes,

2575
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:25,260
he took it out of the website,
right?

2576
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:26,133
He had all these segment sections on the
website about offering protection for 

2577
01:46:28,721 --> 01:46:29,554
whistle blowers and the.
And also they were like the worst when 

2578
01:46:32,711 --> 01:46:34,920
it came to the press.
Yes,

2579
01:46:35,170 --> 01:46:38,740
yes.
When it came to the press and people and

2580
01:46:38,741 --> 01:46:42,100
freedom of the press and people getting 
in trouble for leaking information.

2581
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:43,720
They were the worst.
The worst,

2582
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:44,570
much worse

2583
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:48,590
than Bush.
They used the espionage act to prosecute

2584
01:46:48,591 --> 01:46:49,650
journalists.
Yes.

2585
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:50,430
And

2586
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:51,720
then they,
that's a fact.

2587
01:46:51,721 --> 01:46:53,100
And everyone turned their head.
You know,

2588
01:46:53,101 --> 01:46:56,250
Greg Glenn Greenwald used to be a hero 
on the left until he started telling the

2589
01:46:56,251 --> 01:46:58,350
truth about Barack Obama.
And now he's a pariah.

2590
01:46:58,770 --> 01:46:59,530
So,
uh,

2591
01:46:59,530 --> 01:47:00,900
up to the people,
you know,

2592
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:02,530
Thomas Frank,
I don't know if you know you,

2593
01:47:02,531 --> 01:47:04,260
you would love that guy if you ever met 
him.

2594
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:06,600
He wrote that book called what's the 
matter with Kansas,

2595
01:47:06,601 --> 01:47:08,760
which is examining what's wrong with 
conservatives.

2596
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:11,670
And then he wrote a book called Listen 
Liberal,

2597
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:16,150
which came out I think two years ago,
and he is persona non grata.

2598
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:18,030
MSNBC,
CNN,

2599
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:18,864
nobody will talk to him because he 
critiqued the left and he talked about 

2600
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:21,930
the,
yeah,

2601
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:22,763
you can't no room for discourse.
You can't even get a job in the United 

2602
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:26,453
States.
He has to write for the Guardian in 

2603
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:28,890
England.
That's a true story.

2604
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:30,110
So I've had him on my show.

2605
01:47:30,130 --> 01:47:30,963
People love him and he comes out and he 
tells the truth about the last Frank 

2606
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:36,960
Thomas Frank,
and he's got a great sense of humor too.

2607
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:39,090
And he's real personable and he's a 
hero.

2608
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:41,070
He's an academic,
but he doesn't talk like one.

2609
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:43,830
And um,
his book,

2610
01:47:43,950 --> 01:47:48,810
listen liberal is what radicalized me to
not be able to vote for Hillary Clinton.

2611
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:51,030
It opened my eyes to all the bull.
You know,

2612
01:47:51,031 --> 01:47:54,480
people still fucking blame Ralph Nader.
Just unbelievable.

2613
01:47:54,481 --> 01:47:57,150
Like you're allowed to participate in 
democracy.

2614
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:01,770
And Hillary Clinton was the only 
candidate in the history of politics who

2615
01:48:01,771 --> 01:48:04,350
wasn't expected to garner votes by 
campaigning.

2616
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,480
You just were supposed to over your 
fucking votes.

2617
01:48:06,481 --> 01:48:07,314
If she doesn't have the votes,
you're supposed to go get the fucking 

2618
01:48:09,181 --> 01:48:10,014
votes.
That's how it works is the first time 

2619
01:48:11,341 --> 01:48:14,410
ever I've seen.
She was of poor health and shame.

2620
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:15,870
She was having a really hard time.

2621
01:48:15,870 --> 01:48:17,670
Donna Brazil would almost want it to 
replace her.

2622
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:18,533
She said in the book that Brazil set,
her health was so bad they want it to 

2623
01:48:21,031 --> 01:48:21,864
replace her.
That was another thing that I got in 

2624
01:48:23,281 --> 01:48:25,440
trouble for not for,
for people were saying like,

2625
01:48:25,441 --> 01:48:26,760
why do you keep talking about her 
health?

2626
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:31,140
Because it's a huge issue and also I 
happen to know a lot about brain trauma.

2627
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:34,830
She had brain trauma and she passes out.
They said she was a.

2628
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:36,990
She was hot.
She didn't take her coat up.

2629
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:38,810
Listen,
I've been hot many times.

2630
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:40,440
I go in the sun all the time.
I never faint.

2631
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:42,300
Okay.
And I don't want to run for president.

2632
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:46,350
You can't just fall asleep while you're 
standing up and be president.

2633
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:48,420
That's not,
that's not in the books.

2634
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,880
Like I have a joke about it in my act.
Like I was like,

2635
01:48:50,881 --> 01:48:51,890
if that was my mom,
but be like,

2636
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:53,730
mom,
you can't be president.

2637
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:55,350
You can't stand up fast.

2638
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:58,860
She can.
It's true.

2639
01:48:59,030 --> 01:49:02,220
If Hillary Clinton stood a Fascia,
her eyes would roll back behind her head

2640
01:49:02,221 --> 01:49:04,050
and she'd fucking cracker head off the 
linoleum.

2641
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:09,210
That's just a fact.
But if you say that you're a misogynist,

2642
01:49:09,330 --> 01:49:11,070
you're a.
you're all right.

2643
01:49:11,071 --> 01:49:13,530
I've been called alt right for that.
Like you're helping.

2644
01:49:13,531 --> 01:49:16,440
You're helping Donald Trump.
We're helping trump like this.

2645
01:49:16,441 --> 01:49:17,274
Seth rich thing is a real symptom and 
the ignoring of that case is a real 

2646
01:49:21,991 --> 01:49:25,560
symptom of what is wrong with this.
You can even tribalism.

2647
01:49:25,561 --> 01:49:26,620
You can't discuss it.
List.

2648
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:28,350
That's crazy that you're even talking 
about it.

2649
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:30,150
I can't believe that you talk about it 
so openly.

2650
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:31,133
What do people.
People don't try to discredit you 

2651
01:49:32,191 --> 01:49:33,660
because of this.
It doesn't matter.

2652
01:49:33,661 --> 01:49:34,760
You can't.
What do I do?

2653
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:36,150
MMA cage fighting.
Commentator.

2654
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:39,660
Go ahead.
I'm a pot addict.

2655
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:42,060
I smoked pot.
I got problems.

2656
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:44,640
Listen man,
I'm not a fucking reputable person.

2657
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:47,990
By political ideologies.
I mean I'm just

2658
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:48,701
not.
I'm,

2659
01:49:48,701 --> 01:49:50,800
I'm not well read.
When it comes to politics,

2660
01:49:50,801 --> 01:49:51,634
I have my opinions on things,
but when it comes to things that are 

2661
01:49:53,171 --> 01:49:54,004
rock solid and clear like that seth rich
was murdered and people want to ignore 

2662
01:49:57,281 --> 01:49:57,941
it,
I'm like,

2663
01:49:57,941 --> 01:50:01,810
what the fuck do you think happened?
This has to be some sort of a disconnect

2664
01:50:01,811 --> 01:50:02,644
here.
When a person is giving information to 

2665
01:50:04,961 --> 01:50:05,794
Wiki leaks that exposes corruption 
inside the very organization that's 

2666
01:50:09,191 --> 01:50:10,024
responsible for the fucking Democratic 
Party and he gets murdered and you're 

2667
01:50:13,691 --> 01:50:14,081
like,
oh,

2668
01:50:14,081 --> 01:50:15,450
the conspiracy theories.
No,

2669
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,710
he got murdered.
There's no conspiracy.

2670
01:50:17,711 --> 01:50:20,920
It was a botched robbery.
Says who says who wears this?

2671
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:23,650
How come his wallet was there?
How come his watch was there?

2672
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:27,790
How come they didn't take his phone?
What the fuck are you talking about that

2673
01:50:27,791 --> 01:50:30,760
I'm a conspiracy theorist when I just 
tell you the facts.

2674
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:31,683
So this,
this wiki leaks thing with Julian 

2675
01:50:32,921 --> 01:50:33,754
assange is the craziest shit ever.
When he said there's consequences to 

2676
01:50:36,071 --> 01:50:38,280
sharing information with us and 
everybody's like,

2677
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:42,250
he works for Russia.
Now he writes for Russia.

2678
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:45,250
So is the darling of the left when Obama
was in office,

2679
01:50:45,251 --> 01:50:46,350
do you remember that?
Amazing.

2680
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,873
So Julian decides he's just a great news
guy with whose tough as nails at dances 

2681
01:50:52,410 --> 01:50:54,990
creepy and might've fucked some girl 
while she was asleep,

2682
01:50:54,991 --> 01:50:56,090
whatever,
whatever.

2683
01:50:57,470 --> 01:50:58,303
He's can't leave that stuck in the 
Ecuadorian embassy the way that that 

2684
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:04,170
case was so fucked so far.
So fuck teeth.

2685
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:07,140
He's been so fucking.
It's because the ca wants him so bad and

2686
01:51:07,141 --> 01:51:08,830
they control everybody and now they're 
trying.

2687
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:10,980
They have influence over Ecuador and 
they're trying to.

2688
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:14,640
They're trying to get a Halliburton guy 
to be their new anyway.

2689
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:18,150
They might just blow up that place.
I thought gas will no doubt have bright.

2690
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:19,700
I wouldn't be surprised if shit like 
that.

2691
01:51:19,790 --> 01:51:21,890
More stuff comes out like the seth rich 
stuff,

2692
01:51:22,130 --> 01:51:22,963
the amount of people.
And this is where I leak any conspiracy 

2693
01:51:25,191 --> 01:51:26,024
theories,
the amount of people connected to 

2694
01:51:27,171 --> 01:51:29,390
Hillary Clinton Organization to the 
Clinton Foundation,

2695
01:51:29,391 --> 01:51:30,224
to Bill Clinton.
The amount of people that had been iced 

2696
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:32,773
is stunning.
But then some of them are bullshit and 

2697
01:51:34,641 --> 01:51:35,474
coincidental and you know,
people and they're in a weird job and 

2698
01:51:37,911 --> 01:51:38,744
people get go.
There's a lot of people that have been 

2699
01:51:39,891 --> 01:51:40,870
killed,
but,

2700
01:51:41,450 --> 01:51:43,030
but don't you think,
uh,

2701
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:45,650
what I love when they talk about the 
uranium one story,

2702
01:51:45,651 --> 01:51:47,190
like it's debunked,
right?

2703
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:48,073
Bill Clinton got a half a million 
dollars put directly in his pocket from 

2704
01:51:50,301 --> 01:51:51,134
a Kremlin bank directly and then 
$142,000,000 float into the Clinton 

2705
01:51:55,910 --> 01:51:56,743
Foundation.
And it was fun to punch a bunch of 

2706
01:51:57,381 --> 01:52:00,860
motherfuckers surrounded a nuclear deal 
because they wanted to do charity.

2707
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:02,510
So what's the argument that it was 
debunked?

2708
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:05,210
They though they say they say,
oh no,

2709
01:52:05,211 --> 01:52:05,771
this,
this is.

2710
01:52:05,771 --> 01:52:08,390
She was only one of nine things that had
to sign off,

2711
01:52:08,391 --> 01:52:11,630
but there was all these other agencies I
had to sign off on it and this and that.

2712
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:14,760
And it's all bullshit.
That was all influenced by date.

2713
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:18,050
Someone gave Clinton Foundation $142,
million dollars.

2714
01:52:18,230 --> 01:52:19,063
That's to buy influence and a half a 
million dollars in the Bill Clinton's 

2715
01:52:21,831 --> 01:52:22,664
pocket directly.
It's because they like how he talks 

2716
01:52:24,051 --> 01:52:25,310
pretty English in Russia.

2717
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:29,030
Are you fucking kidding me?
So that it's all bullshit.

2718
01:52:29,031 --> 01:52:29,580
So people go,
oh,

2719
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:30,290
it's the bugs.
NAFTA,

2720
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:31,123
bunked.
It's that fucking you tell me why they 

2721
01:52:32,841 --> 01:52:36,590
gave $140 million dollars anonymously to
a fucking Clinton Foundation.

2722
01:52:36,620 --> 01:52:39,080
That is such bullshit.
There are so corrupt.

2723
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:42,200
If you believe trump is corrupt by doing
deals with oligarchs,

2724
01:52:42,350 --> 01:52:46,010
this is Dylan radigan talking.
You'll also have to believe that Hillary

2725
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:46,843
Clinton did arms deals around the 
country while personally enriching 

2726
01:52:48,201 --> 01:52:53,201
herself and Barack Obama has paid off by
the Wall Street and the health insurance

2727
01:52:53,211 --> 01:52:54,044
companies and big Pharma so we don't 
have a functioning out of money sector 

2728
01:52:56,901 --> 01:52:59,900
or the healthcare sector.
It's hard to believe one and not believe

2729
01:52:59,901 --> 01:53:01,880
the other two.
That's what Dylan Radigan says,

2730
01:53:01,881 --> 01:53:02,714
and I believe that fucking guy.
He's an award winning journalist and he 

2731
01:53:04,881 --> 01:53:06,350
said,
if you believe trump is corrupt in this,

2732
01:53:06,351 --> 01:53:07,184
and he goes,
and it's easy to believe it's all no 

2733
01:53:07,761 --> 01:53:09,560
fucking bro,
but you also have to believe this.

2734
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:10,940
You have to believe Hillary Clinton did 
arms.

2735
01:53:10,941 --> 01:53:11,774
Deals are all around the world and 
enriching herself to the tunes of 

2736
01:53:13,521 --> 01:53:15,200
millions of dollars.
The same thing with Barack Obama.

2737
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:16,153
You can't believe one and not the other.
So my whole point is when people try to 

2738
01:53:18,891 --> 01:53:21,770
pretend that trump is the problem,
they're missing the problem.

2739
01:53:21,860 --> 01:53:22,693
The problem is the neo liberal system 
that gave us trump that renders 63 

2740
01:53:25,821 --> 01:53:30,260
percent of the population without funds 
to handle a thousand dollar emergency in

2741
01:53:30,261 --> 01:53:32,900
the richest country in the world.
That's the problem,

2742
01:53:32,901 --> 01:53:34,760
Joe.
And that's what people are.

2743
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:39,170
If you think it's trump,
trump is a symptom of a bigger problem.

2744
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:40,940
I don't even think that guy wants to be 
president.

2745
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:41,833
He doesn't think he fucked up and he was
running to the dog shit tires now and 

2746
01:53:51,321 --> 01:53:52,610
people will taste like shit

2747
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:55,150
will hate him so much.
They want to.

2748
01:53:55,510 --> 01:53:56,670
They want to impeach him.
Right.

2749
01:53:56,930 --> 01:53:59,900
Favorite parts of the election process 
was when he was saying,

2750
01:54:00,170 --> 01:54:04,060
I gave you money.
I gave you my that.

2751
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:05,770
So again,
my favorite part,

2752
01:54:06,580 --> 01:54:08,240
I was like,
got it.

2753
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:11,240
Who would have thought it would be trump
fucking out?

2754
01:54:11,241 --> 01:54:13,500
These people know Eddie has.
He did.

2755
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:16,810
He did it when Obama was mocking him at 
that.

2756
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:18,890
A press junket thing.
What does that thing?

2757
01:54:18,940 --> 01:54:20,780
It was at the Gulf War correspondents.
Yeah.

2758
01:54:20,830 --> 01:54:23,960
The correspondence dinner when he was 
mocking him and he said one thing that I

2759
01:54:23,961 --> 01:54:26,210
am that you'll never be president of 
United States,

2760
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:28,460
and,
and you see trump's in there going,

2761
01:54:28,461 --> 01:54:29,450
oh yeah,
mother fucker.

2762
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:30,503
And like that very well could have been 
like he was talking about running for 

2763
01:54:34,191 --> 01:54:35,390
president the eighties.
Right?

2764
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:36,540
But he never did.
Never did.

2765
01:54:36,550 --> 01:54:39,320
I thought about it in the 2004 election.
Never did.

2766
01:54:39,590 --> 01:54:43,580
But that fucking Straw snap and he did 
it and we're on.

2767
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:46,500
He did it and he always,
I always in a.

2768
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:47,533
do you think that it's a good thing to 
have someone that's fucked up is he is 

2769
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:51,133
like in terms of how we view a precedent
in terms of like all the grab them by 

2770
01:54:54,381 --> 01:54:55,214
the Pussy and the paying off 100 women.
That's all the crazy shit and all the 

2771
01:54:59,301 --> 01:55:01,550
lies like he gets caught in lies all the
time.

2772
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:02,510
And what's worse,

2773
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:04,873
Donald Trump says,
grab them by the Pussy or Barack Obama 

2774
01:55:07,341 --> 01:55:09,410
says I'm going to fix everything for 
you.

2775
01:55:09,411 --> 01:55:11,180
And then he kicked your family Outta 
your house.

2776
01:55:11,181 --> 01:55:12,014
Five point 1 million families out of 
their house while making Wall Street 

2777
01:55:13,911 --> 01:55:14,744
whole and then when he leaves then he 
comes back into public life after 

2778
01:55:17,181 --> 01:55:18,014
retiring,
the first thing he does is give half a 

2779
01:55:19,390 --> 01:55:22,550
million dollar speeches to banks.
You fucking tell me what's worse.

2780
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:24,230
Is that what he's doing now?
That's what he did.

2781
01:55:24,231 --> 01:55:25,220
Yeah.
When he first,

2782
01:55:25,221 --> 01:55:26,054
when he works,
he went wind surfing with Branson and 

2783
01:55:28,041 --> 01:55:28,874
then he came back and he gave speeches 
to the Carlyle group and some other 

2784
01:55:30,771 --> 01:55:34,430
people I had half a million bucks a 
crack and Chris Hedges says,

2785
01:55:34,431 --> 01:55:35,264
which is why I love Chris Hedges.
He was a guy who told the truth about 

2786
01:55:37,071 --> 01:55:39,340
the Iraq war and the New York Times 
fired him for it,

2787
01:55:40,730 --> 01:55:43,500
which is why the New York Times and you 
can't fucking believe that you listen to

2788
01:55:43,501 --> 01:55:44,070
these male

2789
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,050
establishment newspapers where they talk
about war.

2790
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:47,700
Right?
So,

2791
01:55:47,790 --> 01:55:49,560
um,
now I fucking forgot what I was saying.

2792
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:52,920
God dammit.
I'm Obama coming back in the office.

2793
01:55:52,921 --> 01:55:54,930
So Chris had says they steal right out 
in the open.

2794
01:55:54,931 --> 01:55:57,360
Now they don't even try to hide it.
And that's what that is.

2795
01:55:57,420 --> 01:55:58,253
Well,
that was one of the funniest things 

2796
01:55:58,771 --> 01:56:00,510
about the Bernie Sanders,
Hillary Clinton debates.

2797
01:56:00,511 --> 01:56:02,490
He's like,
why don't you released the transcripts,

2798
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:05,160
relates to transcript.
It must have been some kind of a speech.

2799
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:07,680
600,000 dollars.
I'd love to hear what you had to say.

2800
01:56:07,810 --> 01:56:08,643
Yeah,
that was fucking Debbie Wasserman 

2801
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:11,453
Schultz.
Yeah.

2802
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:13,820
People keep it.
We're.

2803
01:56:13,850 --> 01:56:15,840
We're so fucked up in this country,
Joe,

2804
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,960
that we nominate the most repulsive Neil
Liberal,

2805
01:56:18,970 --> 01:56:21,780
corporatists warmonger and the history 
of the Democratic Party,

2806
01:56:21,870 --> 01:56:26,330
the most unpopular nominee ever.
She loses to a fucking game show hosts.

2807
01:56:26,331 --> 01:56:28,740
It doesn't even want to be president,
and what do we do?

2808
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:33,830
We blame another country.
We talk about not wanting to examine the

2809
01:56:36,211 --> 01:56:37,044
system that gave us.
They taught and that's all they'll talk 

2810
01:56:38,701 --> 01:56:42,030
about is blaming another country and 
what is the big news of the week that we

2811
01:56:42,031 --> 01:56:47,031
really concentrate on his hair flopping 
off in the breeze in France.

2812
01:56:47,090 --> 01:56:49,260
That's hair opens up and you see the 
back of his head.

2813
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:50,870
Oh man,
I did a video on that bucket.

2814
01:56:50,910 --> 01:56:53,160
The comb over.
Look at that column over.

2815
01:56:53,161 --> 01:56:54,540
Look at it.
It's right there.

2816
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:55,980
Well,
it wasn't new,

2817
01:56:56,180 --> 01:57:00,750
but it was dramatic.
It was dramatic the way it blew open and

2818
01:57:00,751 --> 01:57:03,840
was like a wing opened.
It was like.

2819
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:07,170
It was like you seeing something you're 
not supposed to say yes.

2820
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:10,230
Like up a skirt.
It was like his head had an ass.

2821
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:12,330
Yes,
I heard that.

2822
01:57:12,331 --> 01:57:13,350
Someone say that.
Yes.

2823
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:14,670
That's a good way of looking at it.

2824
01:57:14,670 --> 01:57:17,320
Like this is his head was mooning us.
Yeah.

2825
01:57:17,321 --> 01:57:18,630
Yeah.
It was a.

2826
01:57:18,750 --> 01:57:19,583
and by the way,
people are going to mistake everything 

2827
01:57:20,581 --> 01:57:22,920
I'm saying for defending trump and 
that's he shaved his head.

2828
01:57:23,670 --> 01:57:25,500
Take it from a guy who's got his head 
shaved Donald.

2829
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:27,120
Now,
how long ago did you shave your head?

2830
01:57:27,121 --> 01:57:28,560
Because I don't ever remember.
You're having.

2831
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:30,630
I don't ever just like you in my head.
11,

2832
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:35,460
2011 maybe.
I think like when I met you in 2004,

2833
01:57:35,461 --> 01:57:36,294
whenever that was I,
I just remember you being bald and even 

2834
01:57:39,811 --> 01:57:41,640
though you weren't obviously now in my 
head.

2835
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:43,080
Yeah,
memories do too.

2836
01:57:43,081 --> 01:57:45,000
I look at pictures of me from Fairfax.
I'm like,

2837
01:57:45,020 --> 01:57:48,500
oh my hair.
I don't remember you ever having hanging

2838
01:57:48,501 --> 01:57:50,760
on though.
We started those guys who can pull it.

2839
01:57:50,761 --> 01:57:51,780
I,
I couldn't pull it off.

2840
01:57:51,810 --> 01:57:52,643
You could pull it off.
I don't think you couldn't until you do 

2841
01:57:54,751 --> 01:57:54,930
it.

2842
01:57:54,930 --> 01:57:57,240
And then you realize it sometimes can do
gray hair too.

2843
01:57:57,241 --> 01:57:59,910
I can't do greg fucking really can't do 
it.

2844
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:03,480
I have to dye my hair all the time.
But when you let your hair go gray,

2845
01:58:03,481 --> 01:58:04,980
you have that are,
uh,

2846
01:58:04,981 --> 01:58:06,330
of,
you know,

2847
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:09,180
distinguishing this distinguished 
gentleman.

2848
01:58:09,181 --> 01:58:12,270
You're,
you have aged and learned and he,

2849
01:58:12,271 --> 01:58:12,960
I don't need.
No,

2850
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:13,793
you don't want to die that I don't want 
to die and I don't need to be 

2851
01:58:16,561 --> 01:58:17,394
distinguished.
I want everyone to think I'm the Jerry 

2852
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:22,620
Seinfeld when he was getting an award,
he said,

2853
01:58:22,621 --> 01:58:24,360
I don't like doing this.
I don't like getting awards.

2854
01:58:24,361 --> 01:58:27,000
I'd rather be sat in the corner making 
fun of the Guy Getting an award.

2855
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:28,340
And that's exactly how I.
Yeah,

2856
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,150
that's me too.
I don't want an award.

2857
01:58:30,210 --> 01:58:32,190
I don't want to be in your club.
I don't want to.

2858
01:58:32,191 --> 01:58:33,024
You know what?
So what do you think about the 

2859
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:37,790
Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos,
the richest guy in the world.

2860
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:38,700
Hanni.
Fascinating,

2861
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:42,100
and he sits on a Pentagon board and he 
has 100 million dollar deal

2862
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,190
with the CIA and he runs the paper up.
No wait,

2863
01:58:44,191 --> 01:58:44,560
wait,
wait.

2864
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:47,000
$600.
Million dollar deal with the CIA.

2865
01:58:47,001 --> 01:58:49,300
Yeah.
Which is like something on Amazon.

2866
01:58:49,301 --> 01:58:51,280
Alexis Dillon.
So he's on Alexis.

2867
01:58:51,281 --> 01:58:53,860
Just gathering up information on 
everything you do.

2868
01:58:53,950 --> 01:58:56,350
Yes,
it is fucking shit out of me.

2869
01:58:56,351 --> 01:58:57,000
Yeah.
Yeah,

2870
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,630
it's not good.
Jamie and I were just talking about that

2871
01:58:58,631 --> 01:59:01,510
new apple home thing,
which has the most amazing microphones.

2872
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:03,850
Jamie was saying that while the music is
blaring,

2873
01:59:03,851 --> 01:59:04,840
you could say,
Hey Siri.

2874
01:59:05,020 --> 01:59:06,100
Oh,
it was real quiet.

2875
01:59:06,101 --> 01:59:06,934
Hey Siri,
punch.

2876
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:08,770
Suck my Dick.
Seriously,

2877
01:59:08,771 --> 01:59:09,604
I can't do that sir.
Details about the CIA's deal with 

2878
01:59:12,641 --> 01:59:16,240
Amazon.
$600,000,000 computing cloud built by an

2879
01:59:16,241 --> 01:59:17,074
outside company is a radical departure 
from the risk averse intelligence 

2880
01:59:19,991 --> 01:59:20,824
community,
so now they're in bed with the 

2881
01:59:22,870 --> 01:59:26,530
Washington Post or Jeff Bezos.
Now he also sits on a Pentagon board.

2882
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:27,483
He's got so much money.
He's fascinating to me because like 

2883
01:59:29,891 --> 01:59:30,490
what?

2884
01:59:30,490 --> 01:59:33,340
How do you keep going when you have 105 
billion?

2885
01:59:33,341 --> 01:59:34,690
Like what's getting you up in the 
morning?

2886
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,340
So he's a megalomaniac,
right?

2887
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:40,840
How do you accumulate more wealth than 
any person in the history of the world?

2888
01:59:40,841 --> 01:59:42,430
That means kings,
Queens.

2889
01:59:42,490 --> 01:59:43,323
That's not necessarily true.
The reason why is we don't count the 

2890
01:59:46,271 --> 01:59:48,820
same kind of money that the oligarchs 
have.

2891
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:51,190
Like especially people that.
First of all,

2892
01:59:51,191 --> 01:59:52,024
people have said that it's very possible
that Putin is the richest man alive 

2893
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:55,473
because they.
They're not counting how much money 

2894
01:59:56,531 --> 01:59:57,364
Putin is stolen from all the various 
companies that he's just sort of 

2895
01:59:59,681 --> 02:00:01,870
absorbed and that he owns all that 
stuff,

2896
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:07,140
but also we don't count all these kings 
and princes in the Middle East.

2897
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:11,170
They're not publicly,
they're not public people,

2898
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:12,250
Telco,
so,

2899
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:14,140
so let's say of all the people we can 
count,

2900
02:00:14,141 --> 02:00:14,974
he's the richest guy.
A billionaire friend of mine who's a 

2901
02:00:17,531 --> 02:00:21,280
legitimate billionaire,
told me that it's entirely possible that

2902
02:00:21,281 --> 02:00:22,720
some of these guys are trillionaires.

2903
02:00:22,930 --> 02:00:24,460
Some of these Middle Eastern guys.
He's like,

2904
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:29,670
you've never seen wealth like this.
It's insane in do you know in the United

2905
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:31,960
Arab Emirates,
they make it rain every week,

2906
02:00:32,260 --> 02:00:33,093
once a week they make it rain.
I mean they see the clouds really get 

2907
02:00:36,671 --> 02:00:37,361
rain.
Yeah,

2908
02:00:37,361 --> 02:00:38,560
because they're in the desert and I'm 
like,

2909
02:00:38,620 --> 02:00:40,570
Eh,
I don't like this like a drain.

2910
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:44,050
So they fucking put all that shit that 
they have to put into the sky to make it

2911
02:00:44,051 --> 02:00:45,580
rain,
which they've been doing forever.

2912
02:00:45,581 --> 02:00:47,710
Cloud seeding,
but insanely expensive.

2913
02:00:47,711 --> 02:00:51,550
But they do it once a week,
so 52 times a year at range there.

2914
02:00:51,670 --> 02:00:52,503
So what do you see?
You see a problem with the richest guy 

2915
02:00:54,281 --> 02:00:55,114
in the world owning the political paper 
of note and being in bed with the CIA 

2916
02:00:59,470 --> 02:01:01,550
and he's on a Pentagon board.
No,

2917
02:01:01,570 --> 02:01:04,150
it's all spooky.
It's like some kind of Orwellian fucking

2918
02:01:04,151 --> 02:01:04,670
nightmare.

2919
02:01:04,670 --> 02:01:07,810
We got so much money and you can't 
criticize him in the paper.

2920
02:01:07,870 --> 02:01:08,703
They won't let you know.
The people who write for that paper 

2921
02:01:10,181 --> 02:01:13,270
aren't going great session and post duct
can't write anything bad about it.

2922
02:01:13,271 --> 02:01:14,104
They're not going to write.
They wouldn't imagine they would even 

2923
02:01:15,191 --> 02:01:17,770
dare.
One guy wrote something bad about Amazon

2924
02:01:18,070 --> 02:01:20,230
and the Huffington Post.
He got disciplined.

2925
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:22,510
There was a guy who was a writer for the
Washington Post,

2926
02:01:22,690 --> 02:01:23,523
wrote something in the Huffington Post 
that was critical of Amazon and he got 

2927
02:01:26,921 --> 02:01:29,020
disciplined at the Washington Post for 
doing that.

2928
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:30,213
So that's the world we live in and then 
we have the government and if you ever 

2929
02:01:33,131 --> 02:01:35,050
try to tell about a crime inside the 
government,

2930
02:01:35,051 --> 02:01:37,300
then the government would use the 
espionage act to correct on you.

2931
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:39,440
So we're again,
we're living in an oligarchy joe.

2932
02:01:39,441 --> 02:01:40,120
We are d

2933
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:41,990
democracy has already been taken from 
us.

2934
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:45,110
So you know that this isn't a democracy.
They've done studies.

2935
02:01:45,111 --> 02:01:45,944
This is provable.
Was the thing about from the Huffington 

2936
02:01:48,441 --> 02:01:51,110
post to derail us,
but was it valid?

2937
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:53,510
Was it a valid criticism?
It wasn't about.

2938
02:01:53,810 --> 02:01:56,600
He criticized about how Jeff Bezos 
treats his workers.

2939
02:01:56,670 --> 02:01:57,503
Oh,
okay.

2940
02:01:57,630 --> 02:02:01,620
That has been an open area of discussion
that they like.

2941
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:04,590
I've talked to someone who actually work
there and they were saying that they get

2942
02:02:04,591 --> 02:02:06,930
like a countdown.
So say an order comes in,

2943
02:02:06,931 --> 02:02:10,470
they literally have like a countdown on 
their tablet when the countdown says,

2944
02:02:10,471 --> 02:02:11,050
you know,
like,

2945
02:02:11,050 --> 02:02:12,380
I don't know what the net amount of time
is,

2946
02:02:12,390 --> 02:02:13,223
but you have to run and find that 
fucking product and get it into the box 

2947
02:02:15,361 --> 02:02:18,120
and get it shipped out inside a very 
small window of time.

2948
02:02:18,121 --> 02:02:19,920
He goes,
so I'm literally running.

2949
02:02:20,670 --> 02:02:21,690
I go,
you run?

2950
02:02:21,870 --> 02:02:22,441
He goes,
yeah,

2951
02:02:22,441 --> 02:02:25,640
you literally run because if you don't 
meet your countdown,

2952
02:02:25,650 --> 02:02:26,483
he goes,
you could only get away with that for a 

2953
02:02:27,811 --> 02:02:29,730
certain amount of times.
Then you get in real trouble.

2954
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,400
So they also have these new things,
the risks,

2955
02:02:32,401 --> 02:02:34,990
the bands that they developed a shock 
you or shock,

2956
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,580
you know,
will you serious?

2957
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:39,010
I was joking.
They tell you,

2958
02:02:39,750 --> 02:02:42,120
they just fucking shot.
He'll pull it up.

2959
02:02:42,130 --> 02:02:43,380
They've,
they'll vibrate.

2960
02:02:43,470 --> 02:02:44,460
And if you're,
if you're,

2961
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:47,080
if you're moving the wrong way,
it'll shock you back.

2962
02:02:47,310 --> 02:02:49,140
It'll shock you back to the requisite 
hurt.

2963
02:02:49,141 --> 02:02:51,480
Or is it like,
have you ever been to her new Cadillac,

2964
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,100
new cadillacs?
If you,

2965
02:02:53,130 --> 02:02:56,310
if you go too close to the side,
it gives you like zip,

2966
02:02:56,311 --> 02:02:56,581
zip,
zip,

2967
02:02:56,581 --> 02:02:57,414
zip,
zip gives like a little feeling Amazon 

2968
02:02:59,490 --> 02:03:04,320
wristbands designed to track and 
employee's movements.

2969
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:07,450
So Jeff Bezos,
it's been reported it,

2970
02:03:07,470 --> 02:03:09,910
which is true,
is that he would rather,

2971
02:03:09,911 --> 02:03:13,260
it's not running,
run my shit that day.

2972
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:15,053
So now there's plenty.
There's a couple different fixes for 

2973
02:03:16,981 --> 02:03:18,800
this.
The problem of robots,

2974
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:22,290
uh,
one of them would be a unions,

2975
02:03:22,350 --> 02:03:22,650
right?

2976
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:26,730
So I'm like,
my whole thing is why can't we unionize?

2977
02:03:26,790 --> 02:03:28,560
Amazon,
why can't we use a Nice Walmart?

2978
02:03:28,561 --> 02:03:29,394
I know they make it hard.
Walmart literally shut down their 

2979
02:03:31,321 --> 02:03:33,990
meatpacking in Texas because of the meat
packing group.

2980
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:36,240
They unionized in Texas.
They fuck it.

2981
02:03:36,241 --> 02:03:37,800
We're not going to sell meat anymore in 
Texas.

2982
02:03:37,801 --> 02:03:39,960
That's how we'll fuck over the union.
So,

2983
02:03:39,961 --> 02:03:41,850
but we got to figure out a way to get 
unions in there.

2984
02:03:41,851 --> 02:03:42,750
There's another thing,
you know,

2985
02:03:42,780 --> 02:03:45,210
Teddy Roosevelt was a trust buster,
which was a,

2986
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:47,010
he was a monopoly buster.
You know,

2987
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:50,820
50 percent of all online purchases go 
through Amazon.com in the United States.

2988
02:03:50,821 --> 02:03:51,790
Fifty percent.
Yeah.

2989
02:03:52,740 --> 02:03:55,860
Fifty one percent of households in 
America have Amazon prime.

2990
02:03:55,861 --> 02:03:56,694
Only 49 percent have a landline,
so more people at Amazon prime in the 

2991
02:04:00,330 --> 02:04:01,470
United States then have fucking 
landline.

2992
02:04:01,740 --> 02:04:02,573
So what is that?
Real Teddy Roosevelt would come along 

2993
02:04:07,801 --> 02:04:09,210
and go,
we got to break this company up.

2994
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:10,500
Wow.
He would say,

2995
02:04:10,501 --> 02:04:12,030
this is a first.
First of all,

2996
02:04:12,210 --> 02:04:14,370
Jeff Bezos,
because he owns the paper,

2997
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:15,900
he got the trump was right when he said 
he.

2998
02:04:15,930 --> 02:04:16,763
He's there to get the texts in his favor
because he was able to go around and 

2999
02:04:19,981 --> 02:04:20,814
hollow out economies,
a mainstreet little small towns all 

3000
02:04:22,861 --> 02:04:25,170
around because he didn't have to pay 
taxes,

3001
02:04:25,230 --> 02:04:29,700
the income tax and for Amazon and so the
brick and mortar places did.

3002
02:04:29,730 --> 02:04:31,830
He closed them down by undercutting 
them,

3003
02:04:31,831 --> 02:04:34,140
right?
Because he and now he's opening up brick

3004
02:04:34,141 --> 02:04:34,974
and mortar stores.
He closed out all the barnes and nobles 

3005
02:04:36,391 --> 02:04:39,060
and borders books and now he's opening 
up Amazon bookstores.

3006
02:04:39,061 --> 02:04:40,500
Did you know that?
No.

3007
02:04:41,300 --> 02:04:43,020
Amazon 64,
40,

3008
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:44,850
64.
There you go.

3009
02:04:45,790 --> 02:04:47,560
Even up higher than than from when I 
looked.

3010
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:49,110
They have Amazon prime.
Now.

3011
02:04:49,111 --> 02:04:51,420
How many of those people use it for 
television?

3012
02:04:51,421 --> 02:04:52,254
This is my question because I know that 
Amazon started to make apparently some 

3013
02:04:55,531 --> 02:04:56,364
very good shows,
but I don't hear anybody talking about 

3014
02:04:58,651 --> 02:05:01,140
watching them.
Like apparently billy Bob Thornton has a

3015
02:05:01,141 --> 02:05:04,680
really good show on Amazon and I know 
there was that,

3016
02:05:04,930 --> 02:05:07,650
um,
Jeffrey tambor show that got tanked.

3017
02:05:08,170 --> 02:05:09,380
Do you know,
that's an interesting me too.

3018
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:11,580
Story.
The Jeffrey Tambor,

3019
02:05:11,581 --> 02:05:12,414
one of the guys he was,
he's playing a transvestite transgender 

3020
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:17,110
person and

3021
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:18,173
there was people and he's not 
transgender and there's people on the 

3022
02:05:20,011 --> 02:05:23,280
show apparently that were very upset 
that a transgender,

3023
02:05:23,310 --> 02:05:26,310
a non transgender person was playing a 
transgender person will.

3024
02:05:26,311 --> 02:05:27,420
It's acting.
Yeah.

3025
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:30,360
Well they didn't like that and this,

3026
02:05:30,980 --> 02:05:35,750
a lot of internal dispute because of 
that,

3027
02:05:36,050 --> 02:05:38,420
which may or may not have led to the 
accusations.

3028
02:05:38,810 --> 02:05:39,643
I used to be much harder job.
I used to be harder on it on 

3029
02:05:42,021 --> 02:05:44,210
transgender.
When I say harder on transgender,

3030
02:05:44,211 --> 02:05:44,991
I mean a boner.
No,

3031
02:05:44,991 --> 02:05:47,450
I mean when I,
I used to make.

3032
02:05:47,570 --> 02:05:49,820
I used to make jokes about them because 
I didn't understand.

3033
02:05:50,150 --> 02:05:51,470
I didn't understand that was a real 
thing.

3034
02:05:51,471 --> 02:05:53,480
I thought it was just guys fucking 
having fun,

3035
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:54,450
right?
Well,

3036
02:05:54,450 --> 02:05:58,070
some of them we all like to fucking feel
a little weird or whatever.

3037
02:05:58,100 --> 02:06:00,020
I,
you know,

3038
02:06:00,860 --> 02:06:01,693
I don't go out in public and so,
but then I realized this is the actual 

3039
02:06:04,461 --> 02:06:06,500
thing with a lot of people that they're 
actually born.

3040
02:06:06,501 --> 02:06:08,570
They have the different feeling than 
they're outside.

3041
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:11,390
Then I realized it was a thing and so 
now I don't do that anymore.

3042
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:12,850
It's gender

3043
02:06:12,850 --> 02:06:14,060
Morphea,
you know,

3044
02:06:14,610 --> 02:06:15,560
it's,
there's,

3045
02:06:15,590 --> 02:06:16,423
there's definitely people that have 
issues in their mind where they wish 

3046
02:06:19,071 --> 02:06:20,660
that they were a different thing than 
what they are.

3047
02:06:21,020 --> 02:06:21,853
I think the thing that concerns me more 
about transgender people than anything 

3048
02:06:25,310 --> 02:06:30,080
is this acceptance of using hormone 
blockers for young children.

3049
02:06:30,380 --> 02:06:31,213
And I just think that is fucking insane.
And this is something that the liberal 

3050
02:06:33,801 --> 02:06:35,260
progressives are pushing.
Edit,

3051
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:37,820
alarming rate.
It's a terrifying idea.

3052
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:38,990
Uh,
you know,

3053
02:06:39,740 --> 02:06:40,573
there's,
there's plenty of discussion about this 

3054
02:06:42,351 --> 02:06:44,750
online.
There's plenty of people that think that

3055
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:48,110
age six is a fine year to start this.
Yeah.

3056
02:06:48,290 --> 02:06:49,123
We've talked,
we've had people on the podcast who 

3057
02:06:50,151 --> 02:06:51,780
infiltrated,
um,

3058
02:06:51,830 --> 02:06:52,410
this,
uh,

3059
02:06:52,410 --> 02:06:55,010
this transgender group and we're talking
about their kid,

3060
02:06:55,011 --> 02:06:55,844
their kid identifies with the girl,
but the kid is six is two years too 

3061
02:06:59,061 --> 02:07:02,080
young to start and you know,
and that is,

3062
02:07:02,140 --> 02:07:02,900
it's too young.

3063
02:07:02,900 --> 02:07:03,471
They were saying,
no,

3064
02:07:03,471 --> 02:07:04,304
it's not,
you know,

3065
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:05,473
studies show that that's a good time.
They're just horse shitting and want 

3066
02:07:08,151 --> 02:07:10,280
more people to do it so that they feel 
better.

3067
02:07:10,310 --> 02:07:12,080
Okay.
Do you ever met a married guy that wants

3068
02:07:12,081 --> 02:07:15,230
you to get married because they're 
fucking miserable as shit.

3069
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:18,530
I don't want to call anybody out,
but famous guy,

3070
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:22,220
how have a conversation with famous guys
telling me how great it is to be married

3071
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:23,133
and his wife yells at them,
tells them what to do and all this shit 

3072
02:07:26,691 --> 02:07:28,730
and he gets things done this way and I'm
like,

3073
02:07:28,731 --> 02:07:31,670
what the fuck are you talking about?
He's now divorced.

3074
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:32,740
I'm married.
Okay.

3075
02:07:32,741 --> 02:07:36,040
So it's many years ago,
this guy was fucking miserable,

3076
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:36,873
but he was trying to tell me that it's a
good thing to be married because when 

3077
02:07:40,151 --> 02:07:40,984
you're married you have to answer to 
someone that someone tells you what to 

3078
02:07:42,971 --> 02:07:43,720
do.
I go,

3079
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:44,553
what?
He was telling me that his wife calls 

3080
02:07:45,551 --> 02:07:47,110
him a fucking asshole and it makes him 
more.

3081
02:07:47,111 --> 02:07:48,190
I go,
I go,

3082
02:07:48,250 --> 02:07:49,900
no,
my friends don't call me an asshole.

3083
02:07:50,010 --> 02:07:50,771
Why?
Unless I'm.

3084
02:07:50,771 --> 02:07:51,604
And if I.
If one of my friends calls me a fucking 

3085
02:07:52,931 --> 02:07:55,030
asshole,
I made a huge mistake.

3086
02:07:55,060 --> 02:07:57,690
It's like living in married to your 
football coach who wants that?

3087
02:07:58,070 --> 02:07:58,903
Who wants to do that?
You could throw in buckets of gatorade 

3088
02:08:00,321 --> 02:08:02,710
on your head.
Like the whole thing was ridiculous,

3089
02:08:02,711 --> 02:08:06,040
but it was literally a misery loves 
company thing that happens.

3090
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:09,520
So people who are married want you to be
married to.

3091
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:10,533
Now I'm not saying that's absolutely 
what's going on with people who are 

3092
02:08:12,971 --> 02:08:16,210
transgender,
but they're most certainly in support of

3093
02:08:16,211 --> 02:08:17,044
more people doing it and I don't know if
that is why they would lean towards 

3094
02:08:20,681 --> 02:08:23,830
having six year olds take hormone 
blockers.

3095
02:08:24,070 --> 02:08:27,350
But if you criticize that in any way,
you were thought to be transphobic,

3096
02:08:27,370 --> 02:08:28,203
and this is a real issue today where 
people bring this up over and over 

3097
02:08:31,301 --> 02:08:34,420
again,
I don't know why anyone would think that

3098
02:08:34,421 --> 02:08:38,290
it's a good idea to take a six year old 
and put them on hormone blockers,

3099
02:08:38,291 --> 02:08:40,870
but they don't know what the fuck is 
going on with the world.

3100
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:41,823
Their body is changing.
They're going through all this growth 

3101
02:08:43,691 --> 02:08:44,524
and development,
and for you to chemically hijack that 

3102
02:08:46,541 --> 02:08:51,490
for an ideology seems to me as an 
outsider to be fucking insane,

3103
02:08:52,060 --> 02:08:52,893
but to talk about it,
you run the risk of being thought of as 

3104
02:08:55,721 --> 02:08:56,554
being transphobic.
It's a very strange time to discuss 

3105
02:08:59,891 --> 02:09:02,860
things because you can't have an opinion
about it because,

3106
02:09:02,890 --> 02:09:05,680
oh,
you're a CIS gendered white man with all

3107
02:09:05,681 --> 02:09:07,410
sorts of privilege.
Look at you.

3108
02:09:07,411 --> 02:09:08,800
You Macho piece of shit.

3109
02:09:08,830 --> 02:09:11,710
Yeah.
People like to say you're mansplaining.

3110
02:09:11,711 --> 02:09:12,940
Exactly.
It's like,

3111
02:09:12,941 --> 02:09:13,774
well,
I'm a guy and I have an opinion so I'm 

3112
02:09:14,981 --> 02:09:16,720
not allowed to have that opinion ever.
I mean,

3113
02:09:16,721 --> 02:09:17,554
I understand there's a.
there's a time and a place to say 

3114
02:09:19,571 --> 02:09:20,710
mansplaining.
Sure.

3115
02:09:21,130 --> 02:09:21,963
But I don't think there is,
but let's find a place to say that 

3116
02:09:24,311 --> 02:09:26,890
someone is talking down to people just 
happened to be a man.

3117
02:09:26,891 --> 02:09:27,724
That's fine.
But the problem with the term 

3118
02:09:28,841 --> 02:09:29,674
mansplaining is that man is correct.
If a woman is saying something that's 

3119
02:09:34,331 --> 02:09:36,010
incorrect in a man.
Correct sir?

3120
02:09:36,011 --> 02:09:37,780
He's mansplaining.
Yeah.

3121
02:09:37,781 --> 02:09:38,614
Well that's ridiculous.
So that's what it's saying too often 

3122
02:09:41,291 --> 02:09:42,640
it's turned into that.
Just like I said,

3123
02:09:42,641 --> 02:09:43,570
the Hashtag.
Me Too.

3124
02:09:43,571 --> 02:09:45,610
We're all against sexual harassment at 
work,

3125
02:09:45,611 --> 02:09:46,444
but we're not for puritanism exactly.
So it's when people hijacking certain 

3126
02:09:49,691 --> 02:09:51,350
things,
I think that what we're going,

3127
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:55,600
what's going on with Hashtag me too and 
a lot of things in this society is we're

3128
02:09:55,601 --> 02:10:00,601
undergoing a radical cultural change and
it's brought about by information.

3129
02:10:01,090 --> 02:10:04,390
I think we're way more aware of each 
other's feelings,

3130
02:10:04,570 --> 02:10:05,403
way more aware of what's okay,
way more aware of what we're willing to 

3131
02:10:08,081 --> 02:10:09,640
tolerate and what we're not willing to 
tolerate.

3132
02:10:09,870 --> 02:10:13,450
And if you go back to the 19 thirties in
the 19 forties and watch old films where

3133
02:10:13,451 --> 02:10:14,284
people would smack the shit out of women
and rape them and do all kinds of crazy 

3134
02:10:17,141 --> 02:10:18,730
stuff.
And it was thought to be normal.

3135
02:10:18,731 --> 02:10:19,660
Those are the heroes.
The,

3136
02:10:20,290 --> 02:10:22,380
that a woman?
Yes.

3137
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:24,450
John Wayne would do that.
Remember what he uh,

3138
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:25,750
how about uh,
well it's the guy,

3139
02:10:25,751 --> 02:10:26,584
I forget his name,
but he took the grapefruit right in her 

3140
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:28,390
fail.
Yeah.

3141
02:10:28,390 --> 02:10:29,920
Yeah.
What was that?

3142
02:10:29,990 --> 02:10:32,980
Was that I'm John Waner was.
That's the short.

3143
02:10:33,340 --> 02:10:34,400
Uh,
yeah.

3144
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:35,390
Uh,
fuck.

3145
02:10:35,590 --> 02:10:37,940
Oh I counted.
And Mickey Rooney?

3146
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:39,830
No,
the other store guy closet?

3147
02:10:40,090 --> 02:10:41,210
No.
Jim James.

3148
02:10:41,211 --> 02:10:42,100
Cagney Agni.
Yeah.

3149
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:43,360
Up.
I couldn't think of his name.

3150
02:10:43,410 --> 02:10:44,660
I couldn't either.
Yeah.

3151
02:10:45,150 --> 02:10:45,983
Here it is.
It is.

3152
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:50,030
Volume.
Volume.

3153
02:10:50,450 --> 02:10:52,850
I didn't ask you any lip.
Actually we had a drink.

3154
02:10:52,940 --> 02:10:55,640
I know Tom.
But yeah.

3155
02:10:55,660 --> 02:11:00,660
I wish wishing stop again.
I wish you were the wishing well.

3156
02:11:03,210 --> 02:11:05,090
And I can tell you a bucket they in sync
yet.

3157
02:11:05,970 --> 02:11:06,900
What Dick?

3158
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:08,680
Wow.
That's kind of an asshole thing to say.

3159
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:09,890
Say that one you like better.

3160
02:11:12,540 --> 02:11:14,840
So she says that,
and he takes the group great,

3161
02:11:14,850 --> 02:11:16,170
great food right in their face.

3162
02:11:19,550 --> 02:11:20,480
Wow.
That is kind of a beat.

3163
02:11:20,510 --> 02:11:23,030
That's a dick move back.
It's so ruthless.

3164
02:11:23,031 --> 02:11:24,950
Fucking seen.
Horrible.

3165
02:11:25,230 --> 02:11:27,440
I'll try to do that today.
Maybe you know,

3166
02:11:27,441 --> 02:11:32,240
have some name,
a guy who's a Ryan Geisler,

3167
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:35,270
one of those guys when I'm handsome 
fellows,

3168
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:39,500
do it to some beautiful young girl who's
a good stone.

3169
02:11:39,610 --> 02:11:41,520
Yeah.
How about that sucks.

3170
02:11:41,530 --> 02:11:44,600
Like grapefruit interface,
pupil fuck movie is.

3171
02:11:44,610 --> 02:11:48,620
And she just kind of cried.
She doesn't even react with that.

3172
02:11:48,621 --> 02:11:50,270
Men beat the fuck out of women back 
then.

3173
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:51,470
It was normal.
Yeah.

3174
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:56,290
That's horrible.
So I think what those things represent.

3175
02:11:56,300 --> 02:11:57,500
Obviously it's fiction,
right?

3176
02:11:57,650 --> 02:11:58,483
But what it also represents is what was 
acceptable culturally to witness in a 

3177
02:12:03,261 --> 02:12:06,500
film that is not acceptable culturally 
to witness in a film now,

3178
02:12:06,501 --> 02:12:09,020
especially from the fucking hero of the 
show.

3179
02:12:09,950 --> 02:12:14,950
I think today we're more aware than ever
before of of how people feel,

3180
02:12:16,521 --> 02:12:18,080
of how people think of what's 
acceptable,

3181
02:12:18,081 --> 02:12:18,914
what's not,
and what was wrong with the way people 

3182
02:12:20,091 --> 02:12:20,924
used to behave.

3183
02:12:21,050 --> 02:12:21,883
Whereas it was just,
we were operating on momentum and the 

3184
02:12:23,601 --> 02:12:25,850
thirties and forties and fifties and 
sixties and seventies.

3185
02:12:26,090 --> 02:12:26,923
The Internet came along and people were 
just sharing information of this 

3186
02:12:29,211 --> 02:12:31,640
unprecedented pace.
Yeah.

3187
02:12:31,730 --> 02:12:32,570
Yeah.
Uh,

3188
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:35,300
I just found out about John Lennon.
What about him?

3189
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:39,530
That he admitted to beating his girls?
Girlfriends.

3190
02:12:39,630 --> 02:12:40,463
Really?
Did you meet her at Yoko Ono sing you 

3191
02:12:42,651 --> 02:12:45,410
gotta you gotta give him,
cut him a break.

3192
02:12:45,470 --> 02:12:47,510
But it was when I was younger and he 
said,

3193
02:12:47,511 --> 02:12:49,160
you know,
I have to make up for the things.

3194
02:12:49,161 --> 02:12:51,170
I can't deny what I did.
I have to make up for it.

3195
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:52,061
I was like,
wow.

3196
02:12:52,061 --> 02:12:55,160
And you don't want to hear that right.
Data about Hendrix to know.

3197
02:12:55,190 --> 02:12:55,820
Yeah,
yeah,

3198
02:12:55,820 --> 02:12:57,290
yeah.
See if he could find that dude.

3199
02:12:57,291 --> 02:13:00,380
Hendrick Hendrick story is very 
disturbing because Hendrix might've been

3200
02:13:00,381 --> 02:13:01,214
murdered.
It's very possible that really is 

3201
02:13:02,660 --> 02:13:03,493
murdered.
You don't have to imagine John Lennon 

3202
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:06,680
beat women and children.
It was just a fact beat.

3203
02:13:06,710 --> 02:13:09,110
Children.
Who did he what children?

3204
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:10,363
Terrible things the famous asshole did 
during his life have written by a woman 

3205
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:14,413
Hashtag.
Me Too.

3206
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:18,500
Yeah,
it was a different time.

3207
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:19,393
I bet.
I bet a lot of people did terrible 

3208
02:13:20,481 --> 02:13:22,910
things back then.
I guess he wasn't one of his kids.

3209
02:13:22,911 --> 02:13:24,650
He wasn't nice to.
I forget which one,

3210
02:13:24,651 --> 02:13:26,330
Julian or the other.
Anyway,

3211
02:13:26,610 --> 02:13:27,500
it's tough.
It's not.

3212
02:13:27,501 --> 02:13:29,090
You don't want to,
you know,

3213
02:13:29,091 --> 02:13:31,530
Steve Martin's Dad.
I might give a read his book talks about

3214
02:13:31,531 --> 02:13:32,364
how his dad hit him a little too hard 
one time when they were never friends 

3215
02:13:34,261 --> 02:13:35,540
after that.
Jesus.

3216
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:38,250
And did you get hit as a kid growing up?
No.

3217
02:13:38,820 --> 02:13:41,760
No,
I didn't get your mother got hit.

3218
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:42,771
Oh,
okay.

3219
02:13:42,771 --> 02:13:44,280
Yeah.
My mother got hit by my dad,

3220
02:13:44,281 --> 02:13:45,990
but then she left my dad.
Oh,

3221
02:13:45,991 --> 02:13:47,970
your dad didn't hit you completely made 
up.

3222
02:13:47,971 --> 02:13:49,600
Jimmy Hendrix,
Australian girlfriend.

3223
02:13:49,601 --> 02:13:51,960
Savages.
New Film which shows rockstar beating up

3224
02:13:51,961 --> 02:13:53,580
her character.
Oh,

3225
02:13:53,581 --> 02:13:54,750
okay.
Uh,

3226
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:57,570
all my sides and accuracy has been 
criticized by Hendrix.

3227
02:13:57,571 --> 02:13:59,060
His friends,
his former girlfriend,

3228
02:13:59,100 --> 02:13:59,933
disgusted by scenes depicting domestic 
violence never consulted her about 

3229
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:04,140
portrayal.

3230
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:05,280
Okay.
So that might not be true.

3231
02:14:05,550 --> 02:14:06,460
But there was,
um,

3232
02:14:06,810 --> 02:14:08,070
there was another,
uh,

3233
02:14:08,190 --> 02:14:09,023
someone had said that there was a 
situation where Jimmy was in the other 

3234
02:14:11,851 --> 02:14:12,684
room and he hit his girlfriend,
like someone was talking about it from 

3235
02:14:16,680 --> 02:14:19,020
first person perspective.
I don't know if that was the girlfriend.

3236
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:20,213
The fascinating thing about Jimmy was 
that he had this gangster manager who 

3237
02:14:23,521 --> 02:14:24,354
had him kidnapped his manager,
had him kidnapped so that he could 

3238
02:14:27,151 --> 02:14:27,984
release him so that he could rescue him 
so that he can keep Jimmy on as a 

3239
02:14:31,261 --> 02:14:33,560
client.
And this is all a.

3240
02:14:33,570 --> 02:14:37,590
That came from a really recent book that
was one of the gangster guys,

3241
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:38,633
bodyguards,
like one of the people that worked for 

3242
02:14:39,921 --> 02:14:41,610
them.
So very fascinating.

3243
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:44,460
So he was afraid that Jimmy was going to
get rid of him as a manager.

3244
02:14:44,461 --> 02:14:48,060
So he engineered a kidnapping that he 
could solve,

3245
02:14:48,061 --> 02:14:50,850
that Jimmy would feel indebted and bring
them on as his manager.

3246
02:14:50,910 --> 02:14:51,743
And this guy who wrote this book,
I don't know how much of this is real 

3247
02:14:53,491 --> 02:14:54,324
and how much of it's bullshit,
but thinks that they murdered Jimi 

3248
02:14:56,670 --> 02:14:59,070
Hendrix.
And then right after that,

3249
02:14:59,130 --> 02:15:02,010
the girlfriend of Jimi Hendrix was 
thrown off of a roof.

3250
02:15:02,490 --> 02:15:03,420
Yeah.
Really?

3251
02:15:03,421 --> 02:15:05,220
Yeah.
And they said she committed suicide.

3252
02:15:05,221 --> 02:15:08,700
But he says they threw her off a roof 
and she knew about Jimmy's murder.

3253
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:10,090
Really?
Eh?

3254
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:11,310
I Dunno,
I dunno.

3255
02:15:11,490 --> 02:15:12,720
I Dunno.
A stranger.

3256
02:15:12,721 --> 02:15:14,060
Things have happened in that job.
Well,

3257
02:15:14,070 --> 02:15:16,830
that whole business in many ways look at
should night,

3258
02:15:16,890 --> 02:15:17,970
right?
That whole business,

3259
02:15:17,971 --> 02:15:21,570
the music business has been run by 
gangsters for a long fucking time.

3260
02:15:21,750 --> 02:15:22,800
Look it.
Phil Spector,

3261
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:24,330
right?
The guy who was shot,

3262
02:15:24,331 --> 02:15:25,164
that woman in the face,
like he used to put guns in people's 

3263
02:15:27,181 --> 02:15:31,320
mouths all the time.
That business was run by gangsters ever.

3264
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:34,950
So the idea of Jimi Hendrix manager 
being a gangster,

3265
02:15:34,951 --> 02:15:36,990
it's not outside the realm of 
possibility.

3266
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:40,740
You go back to the Ciro's nightclub days
where it's the comedy store is today.

3267
02:15:41,010 --> 02:15:44,840
That was run by Bugsy Siegel.
It was a fucking gangster joint with.

3268
02:15:44,841 --> 02:15:45,674
That's where they had musicians play and
fucking Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin 

3269
02:15:48,991 --> 02:15:50,670
Plate there.
I mean really?

3270
02:15:50,700 --> 02:15:51,533
That was run by fucking murderers.
That was the one reason why everybody 

3271
02:15:55,111 --> 02:15:57,210
was willing to believe the comedy store 
was haunted.

3272
02:15:57,450 --> 02:15:58,283
If you look at like the haunted no 
dictionary of like places or the 

3273
02:16:01,470 --> 02:16:02,303
directory of places,
the comedy store's like one of the top 

3274
02:16:04,051 --> 02:16:05,760
places on the list in Hollywood.
There it is.

3275
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:08,250
I'm pretty sure it's not a club.
That's the fucking main room,

3276
02:16:08,251 --> 02:16:09,570
man.
I prefer them there.

3277
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:10,703
I'm going there tonight.
I'll be standing right there with that 

3278
02:16:12,451 --> 02:16:13,920
guy is.
I mean,

3279
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:18,980
it's crazy that the store is essentially
the same fucking place as it was then.

3280
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:20,100
Wow.
Yeah,

3281
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:20,570
I bet.

3282
02:16:20,570 --> 02:16:23,130
I believe baton do.
They killed a shitload of people in that

3283
02:16:23,131 --> 02:16:24,990
place and there's a.
that's the front door.

3284
02:16:25,310 --> 02:16:26,840
How Nice.
That looks isn't amazing.

3285
02:16:26,841 --> 02:16:28,680
Yeah.
That's really dark and evil.

3286
02:16:28,970 --> 02:16:29,803
Meanwhile,
I was evil or then now we're just 

3287
02:16:30,611 --> 02:16:32,520
telling jokes.
That was fun that night at.

3288
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:33,393
You know,
I haven't done many sets of the comedy 

3289
02:16:34,361 --> 02:16:37,630
store in Los Angeles.
It was a blast.

3290
02:16:37,631 --> 02:16:39,390
I really enjoyed that.
Sam Tripoli.

3291
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:40,720
Thanks for him.
Me On that show,

3292
02:16:40,750 --> 02:16:43,660
doing his show tonight show tonight.
It's in the main room.

3293
02:16:43,870 --> 02:16:45,260
It's the place is the best.
It's.

3294
02:16:45,270 --> 02:16:47,860
It's just,
it's soaked with history.

3295
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:48,913
Look at that point blown grant smacked 
my girlfriend to finish with a 

3296
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:54,370
grapefruit chain.
We'll get them cigarettes,

3297
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:57,100
smoking cigarettes.
Nobody worked out.

3298
02:16:57,310 --> 02:16:59,740
Nobody.
Nobody where everybody looked like shit.

3299
02:16:59,980 --> 02:17:03,050
Ronald Reagan.
Reagan.

3300
02:17:03,220 --> 02:17:05,430
Who's the girl?
I don't know.

3301
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:06,490
That state.
That's Dean Martin,

3302
02:17:06,491 --> 02:17:07,600
right?
Nancy Reagan.

3303
02:17:08,170 --> 02:17:10,600
That's Nancy.
Know what the picture says?

3304
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:12,340
It was nancy and Ronald Reagan.
Wow.

3305
02:17:12,341 --> 02:17:15,460
She got an even bigger Martin genie 
bigger.

3306
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:18,280
That's Dean Martin writing.
Martin.

3307
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:21,520
Dean Martin looked weird too.
It's just a weird angle.

3308
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:22,433
Is probably hammered.
Couldn't keep his eyes open like I 

3309
02:17:24,611 --> 02:17:27,150
always wanted to be those guys like I 
wanted to be Dean Martin.

3310
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:30,230
I wanted to be the rat pack.
I want it to be a dreamy.

3311
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:31,443
Jimmy.
Dory Leo.

3312
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:33,090
You have a good chance of being Jimmy 
Dore.

3313
02:17:35,310 --> 02:17:38,140
It's hard to find out who that guy is.
Oh,

3314
02:17:38,141 --> 02:17:39,460
I see.
But if you're on the outside,

3315
02:17:39,730 --> 02:17:41,640
maybe there's a kid right now listening 
going,

3316
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:42,810
God dammit.
Jimmy Dore.

3317
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:43,993
I want to be.
You don't even know who the fuck you 

3318
02:17:45,581 --> 02:17:47,220
are.
Well you don't.

3319
02:17:47,350 --> 02:17:48,940
I will put you here.
Have you ever thought about this?

3320
02:17:48,941 --> 02:17:49,774
I've thought about it like this,
if somebody would have whispered in my 

3321
02:17:51,671 --> 02:17:53,740
ear when I was 18 years old,
you know how you.

3322
02:17:53,800 --> 02:17:56,230
I had a lot of anxiety as a kid,
like what am I gonna do with my life?

3323
02:17:56,770 --> 02:17:57,603
I had no role models to do anything.
I grew up in this blue collar 

3324
02:17:59,531 --> 02:18:00,700
neighborhood.
I didn't want to do anything.

3325
02:18:00,750 --> 02:18:02,290
Anybody fucking did there.
Me Too.

3326
02:18:02,380 --> 02:18:03,460
Same thing.
Same Story.

3327
02:18:03,830 --> 02:18:04,541
Yeah.
It's crazy.

3328
02:18:04,541 --> 02:18:05,500
Right?
So you become a comment.

3329
02:18:05,550 --> 02:18:08,840
Yeah,
and that's how I became a comic and I,

3330
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:10,870
if somebody would have whispered in my 
ear when I was younger,

3331
02:18:10,871 --> 02:18:11,440
like,
Hey,

3332
02:18:11,440 --> 02:18:12,273
this is how it's gonna work out,
I'd have been a lot more relaxed and 

3333
02:18:14,270 --> 02:18:15,320
yeah,
but then you would have made it.

3334
02:18:15,430 --> 02:18:16,550
Probably would need it.
No,

3335
02:18:16,551 --> 02:18:18,730
you had that anxiety is important that 
the heart,

3336
02:18:18,740 --> 02:18:19,573
the horrible feeling of insecurity.
It all pans out because that makes you 

3337
02:18:22,421 --> 02:18:24,610
work.
Like you don't want to be comfortable.

3338
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:27,820
That's one of the things that I'd like 
to do.

3339
02:18:27,821 --> 02:18:28,654
Things that I'm not good at.
That's one of the reasons why I like to 

3340
02:18:31,031 --> 02:18:33,700
do yoga is one of the reasons why I like
to run hills.

3341
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:34,713
It's one of the reasons why I like to do
things like archery and bow hunting and 

3342
02:18:37,691 --> 02:18:39,640
stuff like that.
It's fucking hard to do so.

3343
02:18:39,641 --> 02:18:40,900
It's humbling.
Jujitsu.

3344
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:43,780
It's very humbling and in doing these 
humbling things,

3345
02:18:43,990 --> 02:18:47,080
you're always insecure.
You're always struggling.

3346
02:18:47,260 --> 02:18:50,110
You have to somehow or another 
constantly be in a state of struggle,

3347
02:18:50,111 --> 02:18:52,570
but that doesn't mean you have to be in 
a state of sugar all day,

3348
02:18:52,930 --> 02:18:53,763
all your life,
but you have to understand what that 

3349
02:18:54,851 --> 02:18:57,520
feeling is because that feeling is the 
only way you progress.

3350
02:18:57,580 --> 02:19:00,040
It's the only way you advance,
so the only way you get better things.

3351
02:19:00,050 --> 02:19:02,230
You get better at yourself,
you get better at life.

3352
02:19:02,960 --> 02:19:04,900
You have to go through that all the 
time.

3353
02:19:04,901 --> 02:19:07,150
It's a muscle that has to constantly be 
exercised.

3354
02:19:07,330 --> 02:19:09,700
It's like you're talking about doing 
standup,

3355
02:19:09,701 --> 02:19:11,620
like Jerry Seinfeld saying,
take four days off.

3356
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:13,060
You feel it.
Take five days off.

3357
02:19:13,061 --> 02:19:14,100
People know it.
Yeah.

3358
02:19:14,230 --> 02:19:15,063
That's the same thing with struggle.
You got to constantly be engaged in 

3359
02:19:18,581 --> 02:19:21,520
improvement and trying to figure out how
to improve things.

3360
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:25,090
That's how you advance.
That's how you advance technique.

3361
02:19:25,210 --> 02:19:28,130
That's how you advance thought.
That's how I advanced ideas

3362
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:29,780
and bits.
That's how they progress.

3363
02:19:30,580 --> 02:19:31,413
You have to feel that fucking 
uncomfortable feeling that everybody 

3364
02:19:33,081 --> 02:19:35,790
wants to avoid.
Everybody wants to feel comfortable with

3365
02:19:35,930 --> 02:19:37,310
all that.
So when I was on the road,

3366
02:19:37,311 --> 02:19:38,144
you know,
when you were talking about how putting 

3367
02:19:38,751 --> 02:19:40,580
together your next special and how 
you're going to do it,

3368
02:19:40,850 --> 02:19:42,950
terrified and all,
all you have to go through.

3369
02:19:43,460 --> 02:19:43,780
You know,
I,

3370
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:46,790
when I was on the road,
I remember like even in in El Paso,

3371
02:19:46,791 --> 02:19:47,624
Texas,
I'd be working and I would do two shows 

3372
02:19:48,951 --> 02:19:49,784
and I would go home after afterwards she
has a condo and I would listen to both 

3373
02:19:53,031 --> 02:19:55,890
shows before I went to sleep,
you know,

3374
02:19:55,940 --> 02:19:58,070
now I know most guys didn't do that,
you know,

3375
02:19:58,071 --> 02:20:01,400
but I just had to do it and it was 
almost like I was embarrassed to let the

3376
02:20:01,401 --> 02:20:02,111
other comics.
No,

3377
02:20:02,111 --> 02:20:04,730
I was listening to my set,
but it was like,

3378
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:05,660
just like that.

3379
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:08,060
It's like I don't,
I don't want to be stuck here,

3380
02:20:08,150 --> 02:20:11,420
I want to be,
I have some place I want to be and I got

3381
02:20:11,430 --> 02:20:13,520
to get there and if this helps me get 
there,

3382
02:20:13,521 --> 02:20:14,354
I want to get there.
I want to figure out what the fuck I 

3383
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:17,150
want.
How do I get to be like that guy?

3384
02:20:17,330 --> 02:20:20,240
How do I get to be like Jerry Seinfeld?
I don't want to be like Brian Regan,

3385
02:20:20,330 --> 02:20:22,820
how do I get to be like those people I 
want to be like,

3386
02:20:23,150 --> 02:20:25,600
and you know,
I just studied them and I just.

3387
02:20:25,730 --> 02:20:26,563
So it's that whole thing of you have to 
have a desire to be somewhere that 

3388
02:20:28,881 --> 02:20:30,520
you're not.
Um,

3389
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,890
well that's one way to look at it.
But for me,

3390
02:20:33,950 --> 02:20:34,361
the,
the,

3391
02:20:34,361 --> 02:20:37,790
I feel like that takes care of itself if
you continue to improve.

3392
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:41,510
So my thought has always been on the 
thing itself,

3393
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:43,250
like the craft,
the bits,

3394
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:44,113
the chunks and there's some material 
from my past I'm embarrassed as fuck 

3395
02:20:47,121 --> 02:20:47,720
about.

3396
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:48,553
I can't go.
Like if I go on youtube and I see some 

3397
02:20:49,791 --> 02:20:54,530
old thing from 1999 or something like 
let's fucking death,

3398
02:20:54,531 --> 02:20:56,870
I can't look at that,
but what,

3399
02:20:57,250 --> 02:21:00,350
what I'm concerned with is like what I'm
doing right now,

3400
02:21:00,380 --> 02:21:03,020
how do I get that better?
How do I tighten that up?

3401
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:07,160
I'm not thinking one day I want to 
perform at this place and then I'll have

3402
02:21:07,190 --> 02:21:08,840
truly made it.
That's a trap.

3403
02:21:09,380 --> 02:21:12,320
But what's not a trap is making the work
better.

3404
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:17,300
Like constantly improving the work.
And since I've been focusing on that,

3405
02:21:17,301 --> 02:21:19,760
the more I focused on that,
the better my act has got.

3406
02:21:19,790 --> 02:21:21,080
Oh yeah,
definitely.

3407
02:21:21,110 --> 02:21:22,850
You're right about that too.
Trap.

3408
02:21:23,630 --> 02:21:24,463
Because um,
well why do you think it's a trap when 

3409
02:21:26,511 --> 02:21:26,841
you say,
Oh,

3410
02:21:26,841 --> 02:21:27,674
I want to play theaters.
You're still use somewhere else with 

3411
02:21:29,391 --> 02:21:30,224
that same stupid and yes,
then still bugs you and you think 

3412
02:21:32,961 --> 02:21:34,130
everything's going to be different.

3413
02:21:34,130 --> 02:21:34,940
And it's like,
um,

3414
02:21:34,940 --> 02:21:35,773
and,
and why I think fucks people up when 

3415
02:21:37,041 --> 02:21:38,030
they make it,
if they're like,

3416
02:21:38,031 --> 02:21:41,480
I feel exactly the same and if they 
don't know what to do with them.

3417
02:21:41,481 --> 02:21:46,070
So that's kind of guy where I got right,
like oh I can do whatever I want,

3418
02:21:46,071 --> 02:21:46,904
go wherever I want to see the and I 
still feel the same and that's when I 

3419
02:21:50,151 --> 02:21:50,984
started listening to Eckhart totally.
And I started to try to be present and 

3420
02:21:52,911 --> 02:21:57,500
try to learn how to enjoy the moment 
more and in the doing right.

3421
02:21:57,501 --> 02:21:58,334
So when I'm doing.
And that's what I realized also is that 

3422
02:21:59,781 --> 02:22:00,614
when I'm onstage stage,
I'm never more present than when I'm on 

3423
02:22:04,341 --> 02:22:05,750
stage.
Like I am,

3424
02:22:05,830 --> 02:22:09,470
that whatever that magic is to be 
present it and it gives you.

3425
02:22:09,471 --> 02:22:10,304
It's like when people say they meditate,
they have energy after I have so much 

3426
02:22:12,411 --> 02:22:13,244
energy after I get off stage,
even if it's a shitty show because I'm 

3427
02:22:16,970 --> 02:22:17,803
just being present the whole time.
I'm not thinking about my bills or what 

3428
02:22:19,881 --> 02:22:20,714
happened yesterday,
I'm just thinking about right this 

3429
02:22:21,891 --> 02:22:25,620
fucking moment and it fuels me and 
that's why I just want to go.

3430
02:22:25,860 --> 02:22:26,100
I want

3431
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:27,930
to figure out how I could go back to 
being a comedian.

3432
02:22:28,110 --> 02:22:28,943
Well you can be.
I mean you definitely did it the other 

3433
02:22:30,271 --> 02:22:30,981
night,
so yeah.

3434
02:22:30,981 --> 02:22:32,310
Yes.
You just got to do it more.

3435
02:22:32,430 --> 02:22:35,360
I'm just pushing my song man,
pushing myself to get out there more and

3436
02:22:35,390 --> 02:22:36,223
it happens to people when they get a 
television show and it happened to me 

3437
02:22:38,941 --> 02:22:39,774
when I got news radio,
I was doing very little comedy and I 

3438
02:22:42,151 --> 02:22:44,460
wasn't writing it all and my aunt 
started to suck.

3439
02:22:44,730 --> 02:22:47,520
I was having this.
I have the same old stupid act and I had

3440
02:22:47,521 --> 02:22:48,354
for years.
There was a period of like two years 

3441
02:22:49,741 --> 02:22:51,330
writing,
write a fucking single joke.

3442
02:22:51,331 --> 02:22:52,164
I would just go up and do the same set.
I wasn't doing any TV sets and I just 

3443
02:22:55,171 --> 02:22:56,004
kept bombing and one time I bombed in 
front of some writers was radio and I 

3444
02:22:59,071 --> 02:23:00,340
realized like,
Oh my God,

3445
02:23:00,500 --> 02:23:01,333
I have to get back to work,
and then I really started dedicating 

3446
02:23:03,871 --> 02:23:05,730
myself and really started paying 
attention again.

3447
02:23:05,730 --> 02:23:10,730
I bought a recorder so I can record all 
my sets are even installed a dat machine

3448
02:23:11,131 --> 02:23:11,964
at the comedy store,
a bought it really stalled and stalled 

3449
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:15,300
and stalled microphones.
Yeah,

3450
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:16,373
I changed the microphone.
I bought a whole new sound system for 

3451
02:23:18,151 --> 02:23:18,984
the comedy store so I could start 
recording my sets and listening to all 

3452
02:23:21,751 --> 02:23:23,010
of them.
Fantastic.

3453
02:23:24,340 --> 02:23:27,090
And now I just use my phone,
iphone.

3454
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:30,600
So amazing.
But kind of fucking,

3455
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:33,570
you got to be concentrating on the work.
That's the thing,

3456
02:23:33,571 --> 02:23:34,404
man.
And the more you concentrate on getting 

3457
02:23:35,731 --> 02:23:36,564
it better and the more you tighten it up
and that's where the real happiness in 

3458
02:23:40,321 --> 02:23:42,480
performing is,
is doing a great job.

3459
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:45,640
It's not in like the places that you go.
I still get nervous like if uh,

3460
02:23:45,641 --> 02:23:47,460
some,
some places they'll get nervous,

3461
02:23:47,820 --> 02:23:50,870
you know,
like I did the theater at Madison Square

3462
02:23:50,870 --> 02:23:51,750
Garden.
That made me nervous.

3463
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:52,561
I was like,
Holy Shit,

3464
02:23:52,561 --> 02:23:53,394
I'm performing at the fucking garden.
But then after the show was over I was 

3465
02:23:55,681 --> 02:23:56,850
like,
well that was a show.

3466
02:23:57,430 --> 02:23:58,410
Normal shelves.
Great.

3467
02:23:58,650 --> 02:23:59,970
Everything was great.
Went well,

3468
02:24:00,210 --> 02:24:01,043
but it was fucking weird man,
because you're just mind fucking 

3469
02:24:03,301 --> 02:24:05,260
yourself.
It's the same jokes as people,

3470
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:06,533
just a different venue.
So I used to work this club in Chicago 

3471
02:24:08,131 --> 02:24:11,670
called the funny firm,
which was a 400 seat room right downtown

3472
02:24:11,671 --> 02:24:12,504
Chicago was great room around the corner
was the Improv and they made it really 

3473
02:24:16,111 --> 02:24:20,420
hard to play the Improv if you lived in 
Chicago and so I remember I had a got a,

3474
02:24:20,421 --> 02:24:23,700
got a shot to to do a set there and I 
was freaked out.

3475
02:24:23,701 --> 02:24:27,690
I didn't have a good set and I can't so 
much pressure.

3476
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:30,870
I cave off and my friend Steve Siegrist 
goes,

3477
02:24:30,871 --> 02:24:31,704
he goes,
it's the same fucking people that are 

3478
02:24:32,761 --> 02:24:33,350
around the corner.

3479
02:24:33,350 --> 02:24:34,230
Jimmy,
they're right here.

3480
02:24:34,231 --> 02:24:37,680
It's the same fucking people.
And I know he's right.

3481
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:39,330
I know he's right.
And,

3482
02:24:39,331 --> 02:24:40,164
but I still fall into that.
But if you went up a week later you'd 

3483
02:24:43,231 --> 02:24:44,070
probably be fine.
Yeah.

3484
02:24:44,071 --> 02:24:46,550
Yeah.
It's just more often it's against.

3485
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:47,393
It's the newness of the situation until 
you feel like that's the problem with 

3486
02:24:49,381 --> 02:24:51,660
filming a special.
When you film a special,

3487
02:24:51,661 --> 02:24:52,381
it's like,
here it is,

3488
02:24:52,381 --> 02:24:54,150
ready go.
The camera's on.

3489
02:24:54,151 --> 02:24:55,020
Oh my God.
I gotta get right.

3490
02:24:55,160 --> 02:24:57,730
Got To be relaxed and be normal.
I have one chair,

3491
02:24:57,760 --> 02:24:59,910
when I did my hour special for comedy 
central,

3492
02:25:00,060 --> 02:25:02,070
I thought we'd shoot too and then we put
it together,

3493
02:25:02,480 --> 02:25:03,313
but for whatever reason we only had 
enough money to shoot one and I was 

3494
02:25:05,101 --> 02:25:06,420
like,
what I should for.

3495
02:25:06,810 --> 02:25:09,540
Oh really?
But I could have used the first one.

3496
02:25:09,541 --> 02:25:11,340
You know why?
Because I knew I had four barrels.

3497
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:14,730
I knew I had four shots,
but I did it before what I had to.

3498
02:25:14,731 --> 02:25:16,170
I did Denver.
I had to.

3499
02:25:16,350 --> 02:25:19,020
And the first one,
a lady heckled me and I was like,

3500
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:20,260
oh no,
no,

3501
02:25:21,700 --> 02:25:22,830
no,
I have.

3502
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:25,300
It's terrible.
Right.

3503
02:25:25,330 --> 02:25:28,190
So I'm like,
you got have four and four.

3504
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:31,090
I was relaxed,
like I did the fillmore in San Francisco

3505
02:25:31,091 --> 02:25:33,190
for my last one and it felt like regular
comedy.

3506
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:34,570
It was normal.
That's a great place.

3507
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:35,351
Yeah,
that's what I did.

3508
02:25:35,351 --> 02:25:37,700
My hour specials at the fillmore.
Where does a really great place?

3509
02:25:37,780 --> 02:25:38,613
Place,
but I'd done that place before I was 

3510
02:25:40,661 --> 02:25:41,980
comfortable.
I love San Francisco.

3511
02:25:41,981 --> 02:25:45,250
I worked there all the time,
so everything just set right in.

3512
02:25:45,251 --> 02:25:48,700
But I knew I had four shows.
Like I feel like too many people put too

3513
02:25:48,701 --> 02:25:49,534
much pressure on themselves to do one.
And I always remember about Hicks when 

3514
02:25:52,031 --> 02:25:52,990
Hicks did relentless.

3515
02:25:52,990 --> 02:25:57,340
He didn't in the UK and he did one big 
show and it just was flat.

3516
02:25:57,850 --> 02:26:00,500
It just seemed flat.
He didn't seem loose.

3517
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:01,373
The wasn't.
It was like he was just going through 

3518
02:26:02,801 --> 02:26:05,200
these motions that he had done before 
that were funny,

3519
02:26:05,201 --> 02:26:06,034
but he wasn't connected to it.
You could feel the tension of doing one 

3520
02:26:08,801 --> 02:26:10,330
show.
And I had seen him many,

3521
02:26:10,331 --> 02:26:11,164
many times.
And I remember I watched it with this 

3522
02:26:12,311 --> 02:26:15,700
girl that I was dating and she goes,
he's really interesting,

3523
02:26:15,701 --> 02:26:17,710
but he's not funny.
That's what she said.

3524
02:26:18,170 --> 02:26:19,090
I was like,
Damn Bitch,

3525
02:26:19,130 --> 02:26:20,110
wow.
You know,

3526
02:26:20,111 --> 02:26:21,820
it's tough debt.
Don't you know that.

3527
02:26:22,150 --> 02:26:26,470
How about you shut the fuck up.
You grab a great proofreader.

3528
02:26:26,480 --> 02:26:29,470
Faith no,
a Kiwi.

3529
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:30,423
And uh,
I always thought it was that Bill Hicks 

3530
02:26:33,550 --> 02:26:34,383
hit it just,
it's hard to capture someone on film as 

3531
02:26:37,211 --> 02:26:38,860
a standup.
It's hard to capture that.

3532
02:26:39,220 --> 02:26:40,990
Like Dennis Miller is black and white.
That was,

3533
02:26:41,080 --> 02:26:43,090
I think the greatest example of 
capturing that.

3534
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:45,250
And uh,
but I just thought it was like,

3535
02:26:45,251 --> 02:26:46,084
well bill is funny in person,
but he doesn't transfer to tv that well 

3536
02:26:48,461 --> 02:26:49,294
because he,
his specialist didn't come anywhere 

3537
02:26:50,381 --> 02:26:51,910
close to being a funny.
He wasn't,

3538
02:26:52,450 --> 02:26:54,550
he just never.
They never got it right.

3539
02:26:54,551 --> 02:26:56,440
I think they needed to get him at a 
club.

3540
02:26:56,660 --> 02:26:57,550
Said,
man,

3541
02:26:57,551 --> 02:27:00,010
you ever see St Mastache that captured 
him?

3542
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:01,120
Exactly.
Yeah.

3543
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:03,790
They did that at the Houston laugh stop.
He did himself.

3544
02:27:03,820 --> 02:27:04,870
Right.
See that's.

3545
02:27:05,350 --> 02:27:07,630
But when you do that then you're 
getting,

3546
02:27:07,631 --> 02:27:09,160
you know,
a bunch of different sets.

3547
02:27:09,161 --> 02:27:10,690
You find the right one,
but.

3548
02:27:10,780 --> 02:27:13,240
And you do it at a comedy club where 
he's comfortable.

3549
02:27:13,660 --> 02:27:16,950
I think more people should do sets a 
comedy clubs and,

3550
02:27:17,090 --> 02:27:17,923
and film specials at comedy clubs.
I have a couple of different theories 

3551
02:27:20,351 --> 02:27:20,800
for why.

3552
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:22,420
But one of the big ones is when you're 
at home,

3553
02:27:22,421 --> 02:27:23,950
you're in a living room.
It's intimate.

3554
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:26,500
Your want your couch.
TV is just right there.

3555
02:27:26,501 --> 02:27:29,440
It's not fucking a million miles away on
a giant big ass screen.

3556
02:27:29,740 --> 02:27:33,140
So it feels weird to watch something on,
you know,

3557
02:27:33,190 --> 02:27:34,023
the big ass giant place.
50,000 people that Kevin Hart did is 

3558
02:27:37,121 --> 02:27:38,840
special.
I think that that.

3559
02:27:38,850 --> 02:27:40,270
It's funny,
you know,

3560
02:27:40,330 --> 02:27:42,970
obviously the material's great,
great delivery and everyone in that,

3561
02:27:42,971 --> 02:27:46,570
but I think everything is enhanced more 
with an intimate environment.

3562
02:27:46,750 --> 02:27:48,730
My favorite spot,
one of my favorite specials that I did,

3563
02:27:48,731 --> 02:27:49,564
I did at the comedy works in Denver,
so like I think it's what does that 

3564
02:27:52,301 --> 02:27:53,134
place.
It's not even 300 people I don't think 

3565
02:27:54,360 --> 02:27:55,193
really might be 300.
I just saw Judah fried lenders and he 

3566
02:27:57,761 --> 02:27:58,594
did his all in the comedy cellar I think
could be perfect and it was all a bunch 

3567
02:28:02,081 --> 02:28:03,970
of different from over like a couple 
months.

3568
02:28:04,390 --> 02:28:05,100
So he just,
you know,

3569
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:07,760
he would just great.
It was.

3570
02:28:07,780 --> 02:28:11,320
And he did it in black and white.
Oh see if you do that man,

3571
02:28:11,321 --> 02:28:13,150
you get it.
You get the right show.

3572
02:28:13,180 --> 02:28:14,013
Yeah,
he did.

3573
02:28:14,360 --> 02:28:15,193
It was.
When you're trying to capture one 

3574
02:28:16,660 --> 02:28:17,800
moment,
one night,

3575
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:19,490
what are the odds that it's going to be 
perfect.

3576
02:28:19,660 --> 02:28:21,140
Too much pressure on you.
You're right.

3577
02:28:21,141 --> 02:28:22,100
I never thought about that.

3578
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:25,100
That you're in this big,
huge thing and people are watching it in

3579
02:28:25,101 --> 02:28:27,530
their little room and it makes sense.
Yeah.

3580
02:28:27,531 --> 02:28:29,660
I definitely want to do my next special 
in a club.

3581
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:31,610
Did you see Dave Chappelle's new netflix
special?

3582
02:28:31,611 --> 02:28:33,380
The one that he did at the comedy store,
belly room.

3583
02:28:34,010 --> 02:28:34,843
He did two of them.
He did want it to a good size place in 

3584
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:40,640
dc or just things like a couple thousand
people and then he did another one,

3585
02:28:40,670 --> 02:28:44,030
the belly room which was like 70 people 
and I was there for that one.

3586
02:28:44,110 --> 02:28:44,931
Really?
Yeah.

3587
02:28:44,931 --> 02:28:45,471
I was like,
wow,

3588
02:28:45,471 --> 02:28:46,880
this is interesting man.
He's like,

3589
02:28:46,881 --> 02:28:47,714
it's so conversational,
but like when you're at home it's great 

3590
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:51,313
because it's like he's right there.
You see the people are literally as 

3591
02:28:54,681 --> 02:28:55,514
close to him as you are to me.
And then you're right there to like 

3592
02:28:58,731 --> 02:29:01,100
you're in the room with them.
Now check that out.

3593
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:03,410
And I have an intimate.
You feel it,

3594
02:29:03,930 --> 02:29:05,220
you know.
And uh,

3595
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:09,490
how is it funny to fucking hilarious the
one in dcs genius.

3596
02:29:09,700 --> 02:29:13,280
And then the one in the belly room is 
great too,

3597
02:29:13,281 --> 02:29:15,110
but in a different way because it's 
like,

3598
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:19,970
it's more like really current events 
stuff like he's talking about Louis Ck,

3599
02:29:19,971 --> 02:29:20,804
like there he is up there so it's like 
Louis ck and Harvey Weinstein and Kevin 

3600
02:29:25,910 --> 02:29:29,090
Spacey was a big part of the material 
that he was talking about.

3601
02:29:29,091 --> 02:29:31,130
So.
And it was right after it happened.

3602
02:29:31,550 --> 02:29:32,383
He filmed this in November,
so it was just a couple of months ago 

3603
02:29:36,050 --> 02:29:38,810
and it was out in New Year's.
New Year's Day.

3604
02:29:39,540 --> 02:29:40,580
Oh,
I'll check it out.

3605
02:29:40,620 --> 02:29:41,510
They'll definitely,
I thought,

3606
02:29:41,560 --> 02:29:42,620
you know,
I have Amazon prime.

3607
02:29:42,621 --> 02:29:44,450
I don't like to Brag.
Oh you.

3608
02:29:44,451 --> 02:29:46,520
And 65 fucking million.
What is it?

3609
02:29:46,521 --> 02:29:48,110
Sixty four percent.
Sixty four percent.

3610
02:29:48,111 --> 02:29:49,910
Sixty,
64 percent of the country.

3611
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:53,090
I wonder how many of those people are 
watching it on TV though.

3612
02:29:53,090 --> 02:29:54,920
That's the thing.
Using Amazon prime.

3613
02:29:54,921 --> 02:29:58,070
Just for the TV part.
I mean how many of them are using the TV

3614
02:29:58,071 --> 02:30:00,410
part of prime?
How many of you were watching?

3615
02:30:00,411 --> 02:30:02,660
Because I have Amazon prime.
I never,

3616
02:30:02,750 --> 02:30:05,250
I never remembered.
He never used it for TV.

3617
02:30:05,490 --> 02:30:08,210
Now I've never.
Do you still have old time cable?

3618
02:30:08,780 --> 02:30:10,100
I have direct TV.
Oh,

3619
02:30:10,101 --> 02:30:11,880
so that's old time cable.
Yeah,

3620
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:13,090
I still have it.
Uh,

3621
02:30:13,091 --> 02:30:14,570
I,
I'd like to flip through the.

3622
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:18,110
I like cooking shows and I like watching
boxing and sports.

3623
02:30:18,140 --> 02:30:20,540
It's great for live sports,
but I don't really,

3624
02:30:20,570 --> 02:30:22,890
I didn't watch the football too much 
anymore.

3625
02:30:22,910 --> 02:30:23,980
It's just,
you know,

3626
02:30:24,020 --> 02:30:24,853
I did watch the superbowl.
It was even though I loved watching New 

3627
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:30,710
England lose,
I didn't really didn't really.

3628
02:30:30,850 --> 02:30:32,970
Game just doesn't excite me anymore.
It's just,

3629
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:35,330
it's just a bunch of fucking 
millionaires and that kind of,

3630
02:30:35,450 --> 02:30:37,040
you know,
once they get younger than you to.

3631
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:39,380
It's hard to get excited with all these 
different things.

3632
02:30:40,990 --> 02:30:41,840
Is that,
I don't know,

3633
02:30:41,841 --> 02:30:43,330
is that stupid?
I don't know.

3634
02:30:43,490 --> 02:30:45,470
I mean it's only stupid if it's stupid 
to you.

3635
02:30:45,640 --> 02:30:46,473
Okay.
I mean it just was a lot and now and 

3636
02:30:47,511 --> 02:30:49,940
when I moved out from Chicago to La,
I just,

3637
02:30:50,090 --> 02:30:52,220
sports just seemed so much less 
interesting.

3638
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:53,990
Now I like watching sports.
Like,

3639
02:30:53,991 --> 02:30:54,824
um,
I like boxing because it's very much 

3640
02:30:56,541 --> 02:30:58,250
like standup comedy.
There's no hiding.

3641
02:30:58,850 --> 02:31:00,970
You reveal who you are in the ring.
Right.

3642
02:31:01,010 --> 02:31:02,840
And just like as a standup,
there is no hiding,

3643
02:31:03,050 --> 02:31:03,883
there's no fucking light show or music 
underneath their fucking dancing girls 

3644
02:31:06,540 --> 02:31:07,373
just liking you and your ideas.
And so that's why I like boxing and I 

3645
02:31:10,790 --> 02:31:14,180
and I realized again,
it's people that think I'm blowing smoke

3646
02:31:14,181 --> 02:31:15,950
up your ass,
but I don't like to watch.

3647
02:31:16,190 --> 02:31:17,300
I like to watch UFC.

3648
02:31:17,300 --> 02:31:18,133
I like to watch the fighting,
but only you're announcing it because I 

3649
02:31:20,851 --> 02:31:21,684
liked the backstories and all that shit 
that you give to it that no one else 

3650
02:31:24,901 --> 02:31:27,810
seems to be able to do it.
Just kind of roles are it off of you.

3651
02:31:27,960 --> 02:31:30,270
It just falls out of your mouth.
Other people,

3652
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:31,420
announcers,
they just,

3653
02:31:31,750 --> 02:31:33,390
it's just boring.
So I don't watch that.

3654
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:35,770
It's very nice to you,
but it's just because I care about it.

3655
02:31:35,810 --> 02:31:36,643
That's all it is you can sell.
It's been a part of my life since I was 

3656
02:31:39,421 --> 02:31:40,254
a little kid.
And so for me it's very important when 

3657
02:31:42,871 --> 02:31:46,080
I'm watching this and explaining what's 
happening,

3658
02:31:46,081 --> 02:31:46,914
like physically like to look to 
understand what the gracie brothers and 

3659
02:31:50,011 --> 02:31:52,710
what that,
what they did and the like.

3660
02:31:52,830 --> 02:31:55,830
That's interesting.
That's what heightens everything,

3661
02:31:55,831 --> 02:31:56,670
you know,
when you're watching and,

3662
02:31:56,790 --> 02:31:57,623
and that's why I liked to watch boxing 
because those guys' stories are always 

3663
02:32:00,031 --> 02:32:00,864
these unbelievable.

3664
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:02,710
His mother abandoned him.
He was 80,

3665
02:32:02,730 --> 02:32:05,360
walked Brazil for three years and then 
he started like,

3666
02:32:05,370 --> 02:32:07,190
holy fuck,
you know,

3667
02:32:07,220 --> 02:32:09,230
so.
So that's like,

3668
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:12,990
that's the,
it's a do or die and it's one on one and

3669
02:32:12,991 --> 02:32:13,824
that's why I love box.
It's what we were talking about earlier 

3670
02:32:15,241 --> 02:32:16,074
when we were talking about Jay Leno's 
new show is that he's actually 

3671
02:32:17,881 --> 02:32:18,714
passionate about it.
When someone's passionate about 

3672
02:32:20,131 --> 02:32:22,380
something,
it comes through when it's real,

3673
02:32:22,381 --> 02:32:24,660
when it's genuine and they can 
articulate it.

3674
02:32:24,860 --> 02:32:25,693
It comes through and I think if you're 
not doing something you're passionate 

3675
02:32:29,011 --> 02:32:29,844
about,
understand that from watching someone 

3676
02:32:31,351 --> 02:32:34,410
who is doing something like the Jay Leno
show or anything along those lines.

3677
02:32:34,950 --> 02:32:36,600
When you see someone you go,
oh,

3678
02:32:36,601 --> 02:32:37,434
that's that feeling,
that magic does that thing where 

3679
02:32:39,361 --> 02:32:41,790
someone's like really excited about it.
Like it's legit,

3680
02:32:41,820 --> 02:32:44,460
like it's in their bones and if it's not
in your bones,

3681
02:32:44,461 --> 02:32:45,294
man,
you better find what is because you're 

3682
02:32:46,171 --> 02:32:47,280
missing out on,
you know,

3683
02:32:47,281 --> 02:32:48,360
you're only getting to seven.

3684
02:32:48,390 --> 02:32:51,900
Life goes to 10 and you're not,
you're not ever hitting the high spots.

3685
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:53,340
You know,
he might be fine being,

3686
02:32:53,670 --> 02:32:57,090
staying at seven forever.
I've been to attend too many times.

3687
02:32:57,150 --> 02:32:59,100
He liked being at 10.
That's the problem.

3688
02:32:59,340 --> 02:33:01,710
Most people never get to five.
It's amazing.

3689
02:33:01,711 --> 02:33:04,170
Most people,
most people I grew up with and stuff,

3690
02:33:04,171 --> 02:33:05,370
it's just,
it's system.

3691
02:33:05,430 --> 02:33:06,810
You know,
comedy opened my,

3692
02:33:06,940 --> 02:33:08,670
you know,
I grew up on the south side of Chicago.

3693
02:33:08,700 --> 02:33:10,680
We could see,
I could see the sears tower,

3694
02:33:10,681 --> 02:33:11,514
the John Hancock building,
which are the two biggest buildings in 

3695
02:33:12,910 --> 02:33:13,743
Chicago.
You could see downtown from where I 

3696
02:33:14,671 --> 02:33:16,290
live.
Nobody ever went there,

3697
02:33:16,550 --> 02:33:17,940
you know,
it was like,

3698
02:33:17,941 --> 02:33:18,774
yeah,
I guess I guess if you grew up in the 

3699
02:33:19,321 --> 02:33:20,430
bronx,
you can see Manhattan.

3700
02:33:20,431 --> 02:33:21,960
You never went right.
So,

3701
02:33:21,961 --> 02:33:22,794
but,
and then comedy kind of opened that up 

3702
02:33:23,761 --> 02:33:24,594
for me.
I went into those neighborhoods and I 

3703
02:33:25,890 --> 02:33:28,320
under and I was like,
this is awesome.

3704
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:30,750
I love this city,
the whole thing.

3705
02:33:30,751 --> 02:33:31,584
It was set guts.
I said it was such a heady experience 

3706
02:33:33,061 --> 02:33:33,894
for me and thing.
My whole life was ahead of me and no 

3707
02:33:36,331 --> 02:33:38,040
matter who you are,
if you kill,

3708
02:33:38,100 --> 02:33:38,933
if you're a stand up and you kill,
I don't care if you kill Adzenys as 150 

3709
02:33:42,001 --> 02:33:44,760
people or if you kill a Madison Square 
Garden,

3710
02:33:44,820 --> 02:33:47,610
it's still killing the same feelings.
10,

3711
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:49,430
it's 10,
you hit 10,

3712
02:33:49,431 --> 02:33:51,720
you,
you hit a joke and boom and you hear the

3713
02:33:51,721 --> 02:33:55,270
roar like that's 10 and there's nothing.
You know,

3714
02:33:56,490 --> 02:33:57,323
my brother,
I remember the first time I got a paid 

3715
02:33:58,321 --> 02:34:00,960
gig.
It was in Wheaton or wheeling,

3716
02:34:00,990 --> 02:34:01,681
Illinois.
Anyway,

3717
02:34:01,681 --> 02:34:02,514
it was $50 and I was telling him I had 
to drive 50 miles to go make $50 to do 

3718
02:34:05,941 --> 02:34:07,350
comedy,
which to me it was a victory,

3719
02:34:07,410 --> 02:34:08,243
right?
Yeah.

3720
02:34:08,250 --> 02:34:09,083
And he,
he worked for the power company in 

3721
02:34:10,321 --> 02:34:10,740
Chicago.

3722
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:11,573
Come with us and he goes,
they'd have to pay me $50 just to drive 

3723
02:34:13,681 --> 02:34:14,514
there.
Right?

3724
02:34:14,730 --> 02:34:15,271
And I'm like,
yeah,

3725
02:34:15,271 --> 02:34:17,770
but when you get there,
you have to go to work.

3726
02:34:18,730 --> 02:34:20,920
What I get there,
I'm the center of attention.

3727
02:34:20,921 --> 02:34:21,754
It's there's a party happening and I'm 
the guest of honor and I'm going to get 

3728
02:34:23,861 --> 02:34:24,694
a blow job afterwards,
which I did that night in the church 

3729
02:34:27,071 --> 02:34:27,904
parking lot.
It was fantastic church parking lot 

3730
02:34:29,690 --> 02:34:32,950
where the parking lot of a church.
Anyway,

3731
02:34:33,250 --> 02:34:35,620
so that's the.
So that's why I loved stand up comedy.

3732
02:34:35,621 --> 02:34:37,720
It's like there's nothing like it 
everywhere you go,

3733
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:38,793
you're the guest of honor at a party.
That's another thing that people 

3734
02:34:41,050 --> 02:34:41,883
probably never totally understand about 
standup that haven't done it is you 

3735
02:34:44,921 --> 02:34:48,880
become attractive.
Whereas you're just a guy.

3736
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:50,050
Oh,
right before,

3737
02:34:50,380 --> 02:34:51,700
right?
You're just a guy,

3738
02:34:51,740 --> 02:34:52,573
just a guy.
Now you're a guy and girls are going 

3739
02:34:54,401 --> 02:34:56,800
after you and you're like,
what is happening?

3740
02:34:57,360 --> 02:34:59,220
I remember the first time that happened,
I was in.

3741
02:34:59,410 --> 02:35:01,540
I was stunned.
Like I'd come off stage.

3742
02:35:01,541 --> 02:35:02,374
I killed.
This girl came right up to me and you 

3743
02:35:03,161 --> 02:35:03,911
want to talk to me.
I'm like,

3744
02:35:03,911 --> 02:35:06,580
is this a trick?
Some grown in Connecticut?

3745
02:35:06,581 --> 02:35:09,070
I'll never forget it.
She put her hand on my chest and she was

3746
02:35:09,071 --> 02:35:10,300
talking to me.
You are so funny.

3747
02:35:10,301 --> 02:35:11,860
How long have you been doing this?
Oh my God,

3748
02:35:11,861 --> 02:35:13,450
you know,
Larry has picked kit and I was like,

3749
02:35:13,451 --> 02:35:15,160
what is going on here?
This is fake,

3750
02:35:15,480 --> 02:35:15,971
this,
this girl,

3751
02:35:15,971 --> 02:35:18,550
what is she going to do to me?
Someone around going to rob me.

3752
02:35:18,790 --> 02:35:20,290
Like,
what's happening was so weird.

3753
02:35:20,500 --> 02:35:22,210
Even when a,
afterwards,

3754
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:23,410
her and I had sex,
I was like,

3755
02:35:23,411 --> 02:35:26,200
this seems fake.
It doesn't even seem real.

3756
02:35:26,290 --> 02:35:28,240
First Time that happened to me,
I was,

3757
02:35:28,330 --> 02:35:31,030
I was working at a zany up,
maybe I should too late.

3758
02:35:31,540 --> 02:35:33,190
And uh,
I was,

3759
02:35:33,430 --> 02:35:36,460
I come off stage and this woman came up 
to me and uh,

3760
02:35:36,760 --> 02:35:37,720
she says,
where are you going?

3761
02:35:37,721 --> 02:35:38,950
I go,
I'm going to the bathroom.

3762
02:35:39,790 --> 02:35:41,470
And she says,
do you need any help?

3763
02:35:42,490 --> 02:35:45,010
And uh,
and at that club there's just one.

3764
02:35:45,210 --> 02:35:46,960
It's not a big bathroom.
It's one stall,

3765
02:35:46,990 --> 02:35:48,340
right?
So you get your own room,

3766
02:35:48,370 --> 02:35:50,120
right?
And I go,

3767
02:35:50,150 --> 02:35:50,983
I don't know if my,
if my boss would appreciate that or 

3768
02:35:53,471 --> 02:35:54,700
something like that.
And she says,

3769
02:35:54,701 --> 02:35:55,930
Oh,
I'm here with the boss's wife,

3770
02:35:55,931 --> 02:35:59,470
which I don't know if she was or not.
And so she follows me into the bathroom.

3771
02:35:59,471 --> 02:36:01,250
And gave me a blow job.
It was.

3772
02:36:01,420 --> 02:36:02,350
I was like,
I just got out.

3773
02:36:02,370 --> 02:36:04,930
I had to go up and bring up the middle.
It was fucking awesome.

3774
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,530
It was almost like,
this is,

3775
02:36:08,531 --> 02:36:12,040
I love comedy.
It's a weird.

3776
02:36:12,070 --> 02:36:14,500
A shifting of roles,
you know?

3777
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:15,393
Yeah.
It was.

3778
02:36:15,530 --> 02:36:16,363
I remember my back hurt at the time.
I just have a bad back when I was 

3779
02:36:18,641 --> 02:36:19,474
starting comedy and I remember I had to 
like sit on the sink because I got my 

3780
02:36:21,971 --> 02:36:26,971
back and I said she's blowing.
It was so funny.

3781
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:30,850
I love girls,
don't get that thing from comedy though.

3782
02:36:30,851 --> 02:36:34,150
It's a funny thing that Allie has.
She's like a.

3783
02:36:34,270 --> 02:36:36,730
she's like,
road pussy is amazing.

3784
02:36:36,731 --> 02:36:38,140
She goes,
road dick is.

3785
02:36:38,200 --> 02:36:40,300
I don't want to do her bit.
I don't want to ruin her.

3786
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:42,010
Essentially.
She's,

3787
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:43,060
yeah,
it's not the same.

3788
02:36:43,210 --> 02:36:44,950
Yeah.
I don't want to ruin her material,

3789
02:36:44,980 --> 02:36:47,380
but essentially that's what she's 
saying.

3790
02:36:47,780 --> 02:36:50,170
It's like,
it's not a good deal for gals.

3791
02:36:50,530 --> 02:36:51,580
It must be different.
You know,

3792
02:36:51,581 --> 02:36:52,980
one time I remember,
um,

3793
02:36:53,260 --> 02:36:54,940
I,
I have a big mouth and everything.

3794
02:36:54,941 --> 02:36:58,950
And so when I started comedy,
there was this girl and um,

3795
02:36:59,530 --> 02:37:02,320
she was pretty and I guess I must have 
told people I'd like to get it on.

3796
02:37:02,380 --> 02:37:04,290
I can't wait to work the road with her 
so I could fuck her.

3797
02:37:06,850 --> 02:37:07,683
That's horrible.
So people hearing that now today you're 

3798
02:37:10,780 --> 02:37:12,910
a piece of shit.
So I don't know if.

3799
02:37:12,911 --> 02:37:13,890
I don't even know if I said what,
uh,

3800
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:16,040
how I said or whatever,
but so that I get

3801
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:16,873
confronted by her at a comedy club.
This girl comes up to me and I didn't 

3802
02:37:20,091 --> 02:37:21,200
know she was going to say.
She goes,

3803
02:37:21,410 --> 02:37:22,490
hi Jimmy.
And I go,

3804
02:37:22,491 --> 02:37:23,031
hi,
how you doing?

3805
02:37:23,031 --> 02:37:23,864
She goes,
I heard you said you can't wait to work 

3806
02:37:25,101 --> 02:37:27,830
the road because you wanted to fuck me.
And uh,

3807
02:37:28,790 --> 02:37:29,950
she goes,
uh,

3808
02:37:30,020 --> 02:37:30,950
she goes,
did you say that?

3809
02:37:30,951 --> 02:37:33,080
I go,
sounds like something I would say.

3810
02:37:34,910 --> 02:37:36,020
And she goes,
uh,

3811
02:37:36,100 --> 02:37:36,861
uh,
she goes,

3812
02:37:36,861 --> 02:37:38,980
don't you want to know who told me I go,
could be anything

3813
02:37:39,010 --> 02:37:43,540
buddy taught you want to know?
And she goes,

3814
02:37:43,541 --> 02:37:45,140
she ran out of things to say yes.

3815
02:37:45,490 --> 02:37:46,151
And then she goes,
well,

3816
02:37:46,151 --> 02:37:46,984
why did you say that?
I go because you're really pretty and 

3817
02:37:49,031 --> 02:37:52,030
I'm attracted to you,
and she totally changed.

3818
02:37:52,031 --> 02:37:52,900
She was like,
oh,

3819
02:37:52,901 --> 02:37:56,590
well that's okay.
Totally changed.

3820
02:37:56,620 --> 02:37:57,453
Yeah,
but this is a different era and we're 

3821
02:37:58,121 --> 02:38:00,610
friends til this day,
but if this never had sex,

3822
02:38:00,611 --> 02:38:03,730
but she would write an article for some 
of them online rags,

3823
02:38:03,820 --> 02:38:04,610
you're,
you're right.

3824
02:38:04,610 --> 02:38:06,340
I want to get in trouble for that piece 
of shit.

3825
02:38:06,370 --> 02:38:08,410
But I was a kid.
I was just starting comedy.

3826
02:38:08,411 --> 02:38:09,244
I didn't know him and my asshole from a 
hole in the ground and I didn't know 

3827
02:38:11,561 --> 02:38:13,180
anything about that.
And when she said she goes,

3828
02:38:13,181 --> 02:38:14,720
why did you send them free?
Why did you say that?

3829
02:38:14,740 --> 02:38:16,300
And I just decided to be honest.
I go,

3830
02:38:16,450 --> 02:38:18,040
because you're pretty,
I'm attracted to you.

3831
02:38:18,070 --> 02:38:19,000
She was like,
oh,

3832
02:38:19,420 --> 02:38:23,680
that's okay.
I think she thought,

3833
02:38:23,681 --> 02:38:26,530
I thought I was saying she was a slut 
and that's not what I was saying.

3834
02:38:27,100 --> 02:38:27,933
That's not what I was saying.
I was saying she's fucking chance with 

3835
02:38:30,460 --> 02:38:31,293
her.
I get it.

3836
02:38:31,340 --> 02:38:33,400
I would like a chance with her.
That's what I was saying.

3837
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:35,470
She took it.
I was saying she was a horse,

3838
02:38:35,480 --> 02:38:37,720
so that's not what I was saying.
So she totally.

3839
02:38:37,721 --> 02:38:38,554
It was that.
That's the only experience I have like 

3840
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:40,121
that.
Yeah,

3841
02:38:40,121 --> 02:38:41,050
it's going to be a weird thing.

3842
02:38:41,100 --> 02:38:46,100
Time if we remove flirting and clumsy,
attempt sets,

3843
02:38:46,850 --> 02:38:50,520
sex and there's a lot of that stuff that
turns out to be fun.

3844
02:38:50,670 --> 02:38:51,503
It's funny to that like one thing that 
you could say to one person is highly 

3845
02:38:55,261 --> 02:38:56,094
offensive and you could say it to 
another person is exactly what they 

3846
02:38:58,741 --> 02:39:00,470
wanted to hear.
That's like.

3847
02:39:00,480 --> 02:39:01,313
And you really don't know until you 
essentially you say it or do it and you 

3848
02:39:03,451 --> 02:39:05,360
read it written on paper like,
yeah,

3849
02:39:05,361 --> 02:39:09,090
it sounds terrible,
but in the right circumstance,

3850
02:39:09,180 --> 02:39:12,060
that's the thing to say.
Nobody wants to admit that.

3851
02:39:12,840 --> 02:39:14,010
Like,
I dated this girl once,

3852
02:39:14,370 --> 02:39:17,610
I'll never forget they ever read it.
When it's read back to you in court,

3853
02:39:17,611 --> 02:39:20,190
it sounds horrible.
But in the go ahead,

3854
02:39:20,700 --> 02:39:23,690
there was a girl that I dated once and 
we're making out and uh,

3855
02:39:23,990 --> 02:39:25,860
and you know,
we're getting into it hot and heavy.

3856
02:39:25,860 --> 02:39:26,693
She grabs my dick and I said,
I want you to get on my knees or get on 

3857
02:39:28,741 --> 02:39:29,940
your knees and suck my cock.
She goes,

3858
02:39:30,270 --> 02:39:31,830
I've always wanted someone to tie that 
to me.

3859
02:39:31,850 --> 02:39:32,683
No Kid.
She drops down to her knees and like 

3860
02:39:35,010 --> 02:39:37,710
she's fucking going at it.
But when she looked at me,

3861
02:39:37,711 --> 02:39:38,544
she goes,
I've always wanted someone to say that 

3862
02:39:39,030 --> 02:39:40,610
to me and like,
what?

3863
02:39:41,670 --> 02:39:44,010
Jackpot baby?
Come on seven.

3864
02:39:44,700 --> 02:39:46,170
You could say that some girls,
she'd be like,

3865
02:39:46,171 --> 02:39:47,580
no,
like,

3866
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:49,120
all right.
That's the whole.

3867
02:39:49,121 --> 02:39:51,570
You can say like,
you don't know in the moment.

3868
02:39:51,750 --> 02:39:54,510
Like I just like,
it was hot and heavy and crazy quick and

3869
02:39:54,511 --> 02:39:56,430
I was like,
I'm just going to roll the dice.

3870
02:39:56,460 --> 02:39:57,540
Let's just see.
Let's pull up.

3871
02:39:57,600 --> 02:40:02,600
Let's go for three lemons.
Couldn't see what the fuck happens.

3872
02:40:03,330 --> 02:40:05,040
You never know,
but if you don't,

3873
02:40:05,090 --> 02:40:06,750
you don't make any calls.
You don't make any sales.

3874
02:40:06,751 --> 02:40:08,600
But this was 1993,
you know,

3875
02:40:08,610 --> 02:40:12,300
try doing that in 2018.
You get in real trouble.

3876
02:40:12,430 --> 02:40:14,070
You know,
I just talked to a guy and he made

3877
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:14,903
it.
He owns a bar and he was talking about 

3878
02:40:16,081 --> 02:40:17,280
Hashtag me too,
and he says,

3879
02:40:17,281 --> 02:40:18,114
you know,
the thing is that women don't have to 

3880
02:40:19,111 --> 02:40:21,870
hit on men.
Men are always the aggressor.

3881
02:40:21,990 --> 02:40:24,090
Right?
And so that causes a lot of problems,

3882
02:40:24,091 --> 02:40:25,450
you know,
like a guy will say,

3883
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:26,333
I'll see a guy,
what have this group of friends and 

3884
02:40:27,211 --> 02:40:30,480
he'll slink over to try to talk to this 
girl and he's nervous and he says,

3885
02:40:30,481 --> 02:40:31,560
Hey,
do you want to dance?

3886
02:40:31,561 --> 02:40:34,050
And she'll shut him down and he'll walk 
back over and like,

3887
02:40:34,051 --> 02:40:34,950
oh,
that fucking bitch,

3888
02:40:34,951 --> 02:40:36,150
you know?
And he goes,

3889
02:40:36,180 --> 02:40:37,013
that's what said because he's got to 
save face and women don't know what 

3890
02:40:40,021 --> 02:40:40,854
that's like.
And I was thinking attractive women do 

3891
02:40:43,301 --> 02:40:44,710
though,
I mean one of the,

3892
02:40:44,740 --> 02:40:47,770
one of the things that you see from the 
same people,

3893
02:40:48,010 --> 02:40:48,843
whether it's men or women,
is people that are constantly shut down 

3894
02:40:52,270 --> 02:40:56,980
and ridiculed and mocked by the opposite
sex become very bitter and angry.

3895
02:40:57,220 --> 02:40:58,053
You see it sometimes from unattractive 
women who have been shit on by men and 

3896
02:41:01,451 --> 02:41:03,550
you see it from an attractive men who've
been shit on by women.

3897
02:41:03,551 --> 02:41:05,700
They developed this animosity towards 
the opposite sex.

3898
02:41:05,730 --> 02:41:06,563
It's very unfortunate and it a lot of it
comes from that feeling that you just 

3899
02:41:09,671 --> 02:41:12,170
get from someone.
When you make an advance,

3900
02:41:12,171 --> 02:41:14,770
you become vulnerable and look,
if you're a guy,

3901
02:41:15,020 --> 02:41:17,410
not a good looking guy and take a chance
of some girl.

3902
02:41:17,450 --> 02:41:18,283
She's with her friends at a bar.
She might mock you openly in front of 

3903
02:41:20,201 --> 02:41:23,590
her friends and it's ruthlessly painful 
and she's just not attracted to you.

3904
02:41:23,591 --> 02:41:26,260
She wants to shut down any possibility 
that you might have in your head.

3905
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:29,050
You go back over there and this happens 
time and time again.

3906
02:41:29,890 --> 02:41:30,723
You could easily develop animosity 
towards women or develop a very bad 

3907
02:41:33,941 --> 02:41:36,010
association with the opposite sex.

3908
02:41:36,220 --> 02:41:37,053
You see that from women.
There's a lot of women that I know that 

3909
02:41:39,311 --> 02:41:44,020
have real issues with men and they're 
very unattractive and they'll say really

3910
02:41:44,110 --> 02:41:47,830
gross generalizing things about men.
They will make these grown.

3911
02:41:48,070 --> 02:41:51,670
Men are this and men suck and men aren't
funny and men aren't this,

3912
02:41:51,671 --> 02:41:52,504
and men are that,
and then you look at them and you're 

3913
02:41:53,681 --> 02:41:54,460
like,
oh,

3914
02:41:54,460 --> 02:41:55,660
well,
you're obese.

3915
02:41:56,240 --> 02:41:59,470
You're.
You're unattractive and your experiences

3916
02:41:59,471 --> 02:42:00,304
with men have probably largely been of 
rejection and pad things on top of all 

3917
02:42:05,411 --> 02:42:06,244
the realities of what men are capable of
and the horrible things that meant 

3918
02:42:08,261 --> 02:42:09,094
absolutely do no denying that,
but to have this gross generalizations 

3919
02:42:13,960 --> 02:42:17,890
about an entire gender based on what 
well,

3920
02:42:17,891 --> 02:42:20,650
a lot of it is based on their own life 
experiences.

3921
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:23,830
Meanwhile,
you go to some really attractive girls.

3922
02:42:23,980 --> 02:42:24,940
Go to,
you know,

3923
02:42:25,210 --> 02:42:28,120
fill in the blank.
Some really attractive girl who's always

3924
02:42:28,121 --> 02:42:29,200
had men hit on her.
She might be,

3925
02:42:29,201 --> 02:42:30,070
oh,
men are gross.

3926
02:42:30,071 --> 02:42:31,810
Men are discussing.
I'm just waiting for the right guy.

3927
02:42:32,020 --> 02:42:35,350
She's not lumping all men into this 
group,

3928
02:42:35,620 --> 02:42:36,453
but many women that are unattractive and
had a hard time with men have the same 

3929
02:42:41,381 --> 02:42:44,860
response towards men that many 
unattractive men have towards women.

3930
02:42:44,861 --> 02:42:45,694
It's a real.
It's a fucking hard roll the dice to be 

3931
02:42:48,611 --> 02:42:53,611
born in a way that just without any 
doing of your own,

3932
02:42:55,180 --> 02:42:56,013
completely outside of your control,
you're just not sexually attractive to 

3933
02:42:58,241 --> 02:42:59,200
the opposite sex.

3934
02:42:59,670 --> 02:43:00,630
So,
you know what?

3935
02:43:01,590 --> 02:43:05,610
I didn't realize that men had this kind 
of anger towards women.

3936
02:43:05,670 --> 02:43:06,890
Uh,
I didn't realize men,

3937
02:43:06,930 --> 02:43:11,490
women had it towards him and like,
but porn a want,

3938
02:43:11,890 --> 02:43:15,100
it turns me off a lot.
Most of it is like this anger,

3939
02:43:15,590 --> 02:43:16,423
slap and forcing and jamming the COC and
the on your ear and all this and 

3940
02:43:21,491 --> 02:43:22,480
speeding in there.
I'm like,

3941
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:25,060
what the fuck is going on?
So this is,

3942
02:43:25,180 --> 02:43:26,610
I don't know what that is.
I,

3943
02:43:26,611 --> 02:43:29,410
I like when I have sex,
I like to please a woman,

3944
02:43:29,470 --> 02:43:30,303
you know,
I like her to be happy and comfortable 

3945
02:43:31,841 --> 02:43:33,710
and I don't,
that whole ain't.

3946
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:34,900
So that's when I realized,
oh,

3947
02:43:34,901 --> 02:43:39,460
there's a bunch of fucking dudes who 
hate women and angry and they get off.

3948
02:43:39,461 --> 02:43:40,660
I'm like,
humiliating them.

3949
02:43:40,690 --> 02:43:41,740
Like I don't get off on that.

3950
02:43:41,850 --> 02:43:42,990
Yeah,
there's definitely that.

3951
02:43:43,050 --> 02:43:43,680
There's,
you know,

3952
02:43:43,680 --> 02:43:47,490
I had a friend and he was an 
unattractive Gar and watched him go from

3953
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:51,760
being sort of having these idealistic 
ideas about the one guy.

3954
02:43:51,810 --> 02:43:52,643
One day he's going like he had a 
girlfriend at the time and turned his 

3955
02:43:54,210 --> 02:43:55,043
girlfriend was cheating on him and then 
he had other girls and they were trying 

3956
02:43:57,841 --> 02:44:01,970
to get his money and then he just became
this bitter fucking God.

3957
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:05,010
Like over the time that I knew him.
He just became a woman hater.

3958
02:44:05,011 --> 02:44:05,844
I mean straight up woman hater.
You'd hit on girls and they would turn 

3959
02:44:08,671 --> 02:44:11,310
them down like fucking dykes.
He just be angry,

3960
02:44:11,460 --> 02:44:15,270
like angry at women like he associated.
And I watched it from afar.

3961
02:44:15,660 --> 02:44:18,540
He associated women with negative 
feelings.

3962
02:44:18,541 --> 02:44:23,541
You associate them with rejection.
He associated them callousness that they

3963
02:44:23,730 --> 02:44:26,130
and I,
and I have a friend who's overweight and

3964
02:44:26,131 --> 02:44:27,270
she feels like that about men.

3965
02:44:27,270 --> 02:44:28,103
Sometimes men are shit and you know 
they're insulting and they're this and 

3966
02:44:30,451 --> 02:44:31,770
that.
Like some,

3967
02:44:31,950 --> 02:44:33,100
some are,
yes.

3968
02:44:33,300 --> 02:44:34,133
Some people are terrible.
Some males and females that terrible 

3969
02:44:36,541 --> 02:44:37,710
one.
When you're picking,

3970
02:44:37,711 --> 02:44:40,650
I'm on team penis and you're on team 
vagina.

3971
02:44:40,800 --> 02:44:43,140
We've all lost because you're crazy.
You're what?

3972
02:44:43,141 --> 02:44:45,600
You're going to align yourself with 150 
million people that you.

3973
02:44:45,690 --> 02:44:47,370
How many do you know?
Do you know?

3974
02:44:47,371 --> 02:44:50,490
A hundred and 50 of those 150 million 
people because that's a lot.

3975
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:52,290
You know,
you probably don't even know 100.

3976
02:44:52,291 --> 02:44:54,900
You don't probably don't even have an 
intimate relationship with 150 men,

3977
02:44:55,080 --> 02:44:59,190
so you're going to lump all $150 million
to the same group that you're against an

3978
02:44:59,191 --> 02:45:02,040
150 million women into the group that 
you're with.

3979
02:45:02,160 --> 02:45:04,020
That's crazy.
We're humans.

3980
02:45:04,140 --> 02:45:04,973
We're supposed to be on team human and 
we're supposed to all figure out how to 

3981
02:45:08,161 --> 02:45:08,994
get along.
But along the way we're trying to find 

3982
02:45:10,531 --> 02:45:14,400
mates and we're trying to find 
companionship and the.

3983
02:45:14,401 --> 02:45:19,401
The reality of that is it is a messy 
proposition and some people get left out

3984
02:45:19,530 --> 02:45:24,210
and some people get shoved aside and 
some people get attacked and some people

3985
02:45:24,211 --> 02:45:25,044
get diminished and some people feel 
terrible about the experience and some 

3986
02:45:28,021 --> 02:45:28,854
people aren't good at it and some people
are better at it than others and some 

3987
02:45:30,751 --> 02:45:31,584
people use money and influence and some 
people use their looks and the whole 

3988
02:45:34,621 --> 02:45:36,450
thing is just.
It's not perfect.

3989
02:45:36,570 --> 02:45:39,300
This is not some egalitarianism venture.

3990
02:45:39,420 --> 02:45:41,520
So I,
I never watched sex and the city,

3991
02:45:41,550 --> 02:45:44,730
but my wife did good for you and she 
good for you.

3992
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:47,960
She talks.
I watched it once because Brian Callahan

3993
02:45:47,970 --> 02:45:48,541
was on.
I was like,

3994
02:45:48,541 --> 02:45:52,170
Jesus,
it's definitely a show for women.

3995
02:45:52,470 --> 02:45:53,580
Wait a minute,
what are you saying?

3996
02:45:54,060 --> 02:45:59,060
Sexist God.
But my wife says about that show because

3997
02:45:59,221 --> 02:46:01,050
it was on her when she's watching.
She's like,

3998
02:46:01,260 --> 02:46:02,093
you know,
these women all got laid and it was all 

3999
02:46:03,181 --> 02:46:04,014
about them wanting to get laid and they 
had resiliency and they weren't 

4000
02:46:07,021 --> 02:46:10,070
snowflakes and they were.
And these

4001
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:12,170
women could fucking run in heels and you
know,

4002
02:46:12,171 --> 02:46:13,100
all this.
They were,

4003
02:46:13,250 --> 02:46:14,320
they had grit.
Right?

4004
02:46:14,660 --> 02:46:15,820
And she's like,
well,

4005
02:46:16,100 --> 02:46:18,230
she doesn't feel that that's what's 
happening today.

4006
02:46:18,290 --> 02:46:19,123
Well,
there's certainly no role models like 

4007
02:46:20,361 --> 02:46:20,811
that.
But you know,

4008
02:46:20,811 --> 02:46:21,950
what's really interesting,
Sarah,

4009
02:46:21,951 --> 02:46:24,410
Jessica Parker and Kim control fucking 
hated each other.

4010
02:46:24,920 --> 02:46:27,620
No kidding.
There was a thing to yesterday with Kim.

4011
02:46:27,630 --> 02:46:29,450
Katrina St.
she's not my friend.

4012
02:46:29,451 --> 02:46:30,284
She's never been,
I don't want your sympathy because Kim 

4013
02:46:32,540 --> 02:46:36,310
controls was her brother died.
Someone in her family died and she sends

4014
02:46:36,311 --> 02:46:38,150
her best wishes and,
and she's like,

4015
02:46:38,151 --> 02:46:39,620
she's not my French.
Never been my friend.

4016
02:46:39,621 --> 02:46:42,590
I don't like her.
And apparently they were just.

4017
02:46:43,280 --> 02:46:46,100
Yeah.
And she said she's a shitty person.

4018
02:46:46,101 --> 02:46:49,880
And she said all this stuff about it.
Like right after my brother died,

4019
02:46:49,881 --> 02:46:50,714
I was like,
Jesus.

4020
02:46:51,110 --> 02:46:52,760
Wow.
What thought it was her brother?

4021
02:46:52,790 --> 02:46:53,511
Yeah.
Yeah.

4022
02:46:53,511 --> 02:46:54,650
Like the whole thing.

4023
02:46:54,770 --> 02:46:55,880
It's just like,
oh,

4024
02:46:55,881 --> 02:46:56,714
so this whole thing about this comradery
in this union of women all together and 

4025
02:47:01,221 --> 02:47:04,320
fighting against not horseshit.
Yeah.

4026
02:47:04,680 --> 02:47:07,500
Horseshit people hate each other.
It's like the Rock and tie,

4027
02:47:07,501 --> 02:47:10,790
reese and fast and the furious.
They didn't really like each other.

4028
02:47:11,030 --> 02:47:12,910
It's a scam.
That's fascinating.

4029
02:47:12,940 --> 02:47:14,450
She's married to that.
Matthew Broderick,

4030
02:47:14,451 --> 02:47:15,284
right?
Yeah.

4031
02:47:15,350 --> 02:47:17,000
Yeah.
He was.

4032
02:47:17,030 --> 02:47:18,010
Yeah.
Okay.

4033
02:47:18,080 --> 02:47:19,970
Yeah.
I don't follow that stuff,

4034
02:47:19,971 --> 02:47:20,950
but whatever.
Uh,

4035
02:47:21,260 --> 02:47:22,700
that's a good point.
I think my wife made.

4036
02:47:23,570 --> 02:47:24,403
Yeah,
it was a good point that women with 

4037
02:47:26,691 --> 02:47:27,740
grit.
Yeah.

4038
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:30,200
I mean you don't get.
What were the role models that you have?

4039
02:47:30,201 --> 02:47:32,000
The kardashians.
You have sex in the city.

4040
02:47:32,030 --> 02:47:33,370
I mean,
I'm a.

4041
02:47:33,380 --> 02:47:35,330
What does that on housewives?
Real housewives.

4042
02:47:35,720 --> 02:47:38,330
How to Kim Kardashian and get famous 
sucking Dick.

4043
02:47:39,380 --> 02:47:40,700
It was a.
It was a porn tape,

4044
02:47:40,701 --> 02:47:41,534
right?
Yeah,

4045
02:47:41,670 --> 02:47:42,503
yeah.
She released a sex tape that was 

4046
02:47:43,311 --> 02:47:44,840
apparently was engineered by her family.

4047
02:47:45,350 --> 02:47:47,270
That's what I heard too.
Crazy.

4048
02:47:47,330 --> 02:47:49,910
But it's not.
If you see what that lady's done,

4049
02:47:49,940 --> 02:47:51,170
like how she's organized it.
Look.

4050
02:47:51,171 --> 02:47:52,880
And it's been very successful.
She had a plan.

4051
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:53,773
Yeah.
If you look at it in terms of a 

4052
02:47:54,201 --> 02:47:56,270
financial venture,
oh my God.

4053
02:47:56,360 --> 02:47:58,010
A windfall.
It's unbelievable.

4054
02:47:58,011 --> 02:48:00,530
Believable.
Amazingly successful,

4055
02:48:00,980 --> 02:48:01,813
but chaos.
And in a sense they're a type of a 

4056
02:48:03,921 --> 02:48:07,880
royalty in lot of ways.
Modern plastic royalty.

4057
02:48:08,210 --> 02:48:10,430
Yes.
It's the culture of nothing.

4058
02:48:10,590 --> 02:48:14,150
Yeah.
Culture of fake asses and nonsense.

4059
02:48:14,270 --> 02:48:16,040
But yeah,
they're talented.

4060
02:48:16,041 --> 02:48:16,874
I'm sure.
No,

4061
02:48:17,740 --> 02:48:20,210
no,
the talented at doing that.

4062
02:48:20,420 --> 02:48:21,710
I mean,
it's not a talent,

4063
02:48:21,711 --> 02:48:22,544
but it's a,
they've been wise strategically and 

4064
02:48:25,500 --> 02:48:27,740
keeping themselves out in the public.
I mean,

4065
02:48:27,741 --> 02:48:28,910
I don't,
I'm not.

4066
02:48:28,920 --> 02:48:29,561
Uh,
uh,

4067
02:48:29,561 --> 02:48:31,240
I don't.
I'm not a Kim Kardashians.

4068
02:48:31,241 --> 02:48:34,010
The kardashians family hater by any 
stretch of the imagination.

4069
02:48:34,011 --> 02:48:36,080
I've had a couple of bits about them or 
kind of mocked them,

4070
02:48:36,470 --> 02:48:37,070
but,
uh,

4071
02:48:37,070 --> 02:48:38,270
I don't hate them.

4072
02:48:38,330 --> 02:48:39,163
I mean,
I don't think wrong with what they're 

4073
02:48:39,481 --> 02:48:40,314
doing.
I know a lot of people that are way 

4074
02:48:40,701 --> 02:48:43,640
dumber than them that I don't hate.
Why does she hate them?

4075
02:48:43,641 --> 02:48:45,230
Because they're famous.
Like that doesn't make any sense.

4076
02:48:45,260 --> 02:48:46,520
No,
I don't hate them at all.

4077
02:48:46,521 --> 02:48:47,354
I mean,
I don't even know them or watch their 

4078
02:48:48,171 --> 02:48:50,390
shows.
I think Kim is really pretty.

4079
02:48:50,470 --> 02:48:51,970
Um,
but uh,

4080
02:48:52,460 --> 02:48:54,500
I just think what it says about the 
culture,

4081
02:48:54,530 --> 02:48:56,070
right?
So that makes you like,

4082
02:48:56,071 --> 02:48:56,751
it reminds you,
hey,

4083
02:48:56,751 --> 02:48:58,310
your culture is vapid.
Yeah.

4084
02:48:58,311 --> 02:49:00,200
Well,
part of our culture is that,

4085
02:49:00,201 --> 02:49:03,350
and I think they came along at an 
amazing time,

4086
02:49:03,351 --> 02:49:04,184
the time of social media where it's just
all about likes and blood pictures that 

4087
02:49:07,471 --> 02:49:11,310
have been doctored up by photoshop and 
the whole thing is really fascinating.

4088
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:12,540
And then,
you know,

4089
02:49:12,541 --> 02:49:13,740
the father is like,
well,

4090
02:49:13,741 --> 02:49:15,240
I'm not getting enough attention as a 
guy,

4091
02:49:15,241 --> 02:49:16,350
fuck that.
I'm going to be a check.

4092
02:49:16,351 --> 02:49:18,240
And then he gets amazing amounts of 
attention.

4093
02:49:18,690 --> 02:49:19,770
I mean,
it's,

4094
02:49:20,370 --> 02:49:22,510
I mean,
you could say that I'm being callous and

4095
02:49:22,830 --> 02:49:24,660
that's what happened.
That's what happened.

4096
02:49:25,050 --> 02:49:28,140
And that's so funny.
I never thought of it like 100 percent.

4097
02:49:28,141 --> 02:49:29,070
He's a male.
Kardashians.

4098
02:49:32,100 --> 02:49:36,300
That's an amazing way to look at it.
I had a bit about it in my last special,

4099
02:49:36,320 --> 02:49:37,100
my,
my,

4100
02:49:37,100 --> 02:49:39,210
my last best.
Did you get in trouble?

4101
02:49:39,211 --> 02:49:39,991
No,
I didn't.

4102
02:49:39,991 --> 02:49:44,991
I covered all my bases,
but it was basically about it.

4103
02:49:45,300 --> 02:49:46,830
I can't do the bit,
but I'll tell you.

4104
02:49:46,831 --> 02:49:47,664
I'll tell you about it afterwards.
People that eats on triggered on 

4105
02:49:49,981 --> 02:49:51,300
Netflix.
Go Watch it fuckers.

4106
02:49:51,390 --> 02:49:52,950
Okay.
Let's wrap this up.

4107
02:49:52,951 --> 02:49:53,491
Do you mean.
Okay,

4108
02:49:53,491 --> 02:49:54,211
let's right.
Listen man,

4109
02:49:54,211 --> 02:49:55,980
I'm glad we finally got a chance to do 
this.

4110
02:49:55,981 --> 02:49:57,120
This is really fun.
Yeah,

4111
02:49:57,121 --> 02:49:57,954
this was great.
I'm really glad you invited me and so 

4112
02:50:00,450 --> 02:50:01,283
more often a big fan of your comedy.
I would love to do it again and I hope 

4113
02:50:03,751 --> 02:50:05,820
hopefully if you could ever come out to 
Pasadena.

4114
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:06,870
Mom,
listen,

4115
02:50:06,871 --> 02:50:09,120
I'm out in passing all the time,
so let's make it happen.

4116
02:50:09,220 --> 02:50:11,190
I will do Jimmy Dore,
ladies and gentleman,

4117
02:50:11,191 --> 02:50:14,130
Jimmy underscore door on twitter.
You got to instagram or no?

4118
02:50:14,160 --> 02:50:15,240
No.
Good for you.

4119
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:19,740
Fucking know he doesn't need it.
Great fruit and your face.

4120
02:50:19,770 --> 02:50:22,350
Everything by everybody.
