1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,740
The general experience,
Michael Jackson was not an ecstatic

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,140
onstage.
Michael Jackson wasn't incredible,

3
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:11,610
astonishing performer who had studied
his craft from the age of nine,

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,020
and so he worked out every single move
and advance John,

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,050
you never knew from one night to the
next what prince or John Mellencamp

6
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:22,320
we're going to do in performance.
They didn't know how well did you know

7
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:25,050
Michael Jackson?
I thought very,

8
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:28,500
very well and he was the most remarkable
person I've ever met in my life.

9
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:31,200
And when I tell people how remarkable
they don't believe me,

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,900
he was,
you know,

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,210
and I and Jamie are on a certain level
and we don't know.

12
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:42,330
We're on a certain level because we
figured these are the range.

13
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:46,080
This is the range of humanity.
If we go out and meet anybody on the

14
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:49,410
street or even anybody famous,
I work with Buzz Aldrin these days.

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,500
What we're gonna encounter is another
person pretty much like costs.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,440
Sorry.
In Michael Jackson's case,

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,830
he did not fit on this normal plain at
all.

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,280
He was on a plane somewhere where you've
never seen a human being before.

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,610
So the first time I met him,
we were at his brother Marlin's,

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,920
have pool house.
It's a little house with just enough

21
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:18,150
room for one big room on the first floor
and another big room on the second floor

22
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:22,680
with a little tiny staircase between
them and there's a billiard table in the

23
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:24,840
middle of the room and their arcade
games,

24
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:28,380
which at that point in particular in
1983,

25
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,720
um,
were unattainable.

26
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,460
No human could afford arcade games,
um,

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,140
unless you were Steve Wynn and you were
actually equipping and arcade.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,180
So we're in the middle of.
We're in this room and Michael and I are

29
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:47,181
standing next to each other,
so his elbow is that his left elbow is

30
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:48,870
at my right elbow.

31
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,900
His left knee is at my right knee and we
have a meeting with the art director

32
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:56,580
from CBS.
I'm condensing the story,

33
00:01:56,581 --> 00:02:00,060
there's lots more,
but we're having a meeting with the art

34
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:03,540
director and she walks in with five of
the most gorgeous portfolios you've ever

35
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,670
seen in your life.
Hand carved Cherrywood,

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,350
hand carved leather.
And these are from guys I know because I

37
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:12,750
was,
I started in pop culture in the art

38
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:17,660
business and these were my legendary
competitors and um,

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,940
and Michael opens the first page of the
first portfolio and he gets a square

40
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:27,000
inch into it,
a postage stamp sized piece into it.

41
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,550
And he goes,
oh.

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,760
And his knees began to buckle and he
gets another two square inches into.

43
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,890
It just lifts the page a little bit
further.

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,700
Oh,
he lifts it up even further.

45
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,970
Oh,
Michael was seeing the infinite in the

46
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,050
things that even the artist didn't see
it with such infinity.

47
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,950
As Michael is singing.
And by this time he gets to the full

48
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:56,340
page,
he's having a full scale aesthetic

49
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:59,440
orgasm.
I have never seen anything like this in

50
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:01,570
my life.
And I remember the first two rows of

51
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:04,870
science are the truth at any price,
including the price of your life.

52
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,800
And look at things run under right under
your nose as if you've never seen them

53
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,390
before.
And then proceed from there.

54
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,600
Michael is seeing the infinite in the
tiniest of things.

55
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,630
And you never seen a human with this
degree of awe,

56
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,540
wonder and surprise anywhere in your
life.

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,720
And I will never see another human like
that again in my lifetime.

58
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,340
Michael was beyond belief,
utterly beyond belief and his commitment

59
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,120
to his audience,
to his,

60
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,550
the people he called his kids.
Oh God,

61
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:35,110
I forgot to turn this off.

62
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,980
A very different perspectives.
And I said,

63
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,870
I booked this show.
It's in six months.

64
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,730
I need 40 minutes.
It's got to be.

65
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,730
And he's,
he has told some of my stories and vice

66
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:47,120
before getting drunk with sumo wrestlers
and different,

67
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,130
different stories.
And how much do you weigh?

68
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,620
A One?
50 six.

69
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:53,690
And you got drunk with sumo wrestlers?
Scary.

70
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,460
Oh no,
it was really like,

71
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,980
it was joyous.
It was.

72
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,280
You've never seen anything like this
became big though.

73
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:01,911
Yeah.
Oh,

74
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:03,520
you should see it.
So Byamba,

75
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,150
do you know who Byamba is?
He's like,

76
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:08,120
okay.
So if you ever see us Sumal on TV that's

77
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:10,700
beyond.
So he's the guy like the GEICO

78
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:13,530
commercial skating dot being a figure
skater,

79
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,550
tiger woods of sumo wrestling.
And he is a genius.

80
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:19,310
He's a world champion,
but he's also an entertainer,

81
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,520
so he lives in Hollywood and he's very,
very loose here.

82
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,330
Yeah,
yeah.

83
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,190
He is a sumo wrestler.
Yeah.

84
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:26,460
There he is.
Yeah,

85
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,620
he is from Mongolia.
But he spends a great deal of time here

86
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,760
working as a television personality and
an actor and whatever,

87
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:36,770
but he just looked fat.
Oh,

88
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:39,320
he's got it looks jacked.
Like go to that one where he's doing the

89
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,360
muscle.
Po's that are there.

90
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:41,871
Yeah.
Yeah.

91
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:44,990
So that's like those shoulder muscles
through all that fat.

92
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,520
That guy looks like a tank.
Well,

93
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,580
people don't realize,
but underneath there is like you or

94
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,460
underneath Eris like Tj dillashaw.
You know what I mean?

95
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:57,070
There is a muscular person underneath
all those additional layers of fat and

96
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,450
flush and skin.
There was,

97
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,540
there was a powerful athlete and that's
a real benefit and being that fat.

98
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,710
Yeah.
Force power generation like momentum.

99
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:09,890
The ability.
I mean if the other guy is that big and

100
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:13,580
our goal is just to smash into each
other until one of us has taken from the

101
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,350
platform,
you're not that big.

102
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,420
It's going to be very difficult.
Right.

103
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:21,980
So it's like an arms race of size over
generations where they just got bigger

104
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:24,140
and bigger out of necessity because if
you're bigger,

105
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,410
I mean,
what am I going to do?

106
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,020
Go back to this thing and,
and tell me what has been the reaction,

107
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,620
like when you take it,
how you feed your scoring and just like

108
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,150
a cup of coffee,
you really do feel like you do you do

109
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:38,000
feel more energy.
Do you think it's because of the fencing

110
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:42,080
or is it possible that they just live
within the gen sing and that makes the

111
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:45,950
story sexier for the website that sells?
So you think just eating the ants

112
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:49,250
themselves give you haven't injury.
I would imagine that you'd have to catch

113
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:52,550
a lot of ants to get what you get out of
like all the powdered extract that they,

114
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,570
what they sell you.

115
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,700
Right?
But I mean eating the powdered extract.

116
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:59,120
Then just that somehow or another.
What's the mechanism for giving you

117
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,310
energy?
Uh,

118
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,110
there's some chemical that's in the
ants.

119
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,000
Hud,
I don't know the mechanism of action.

120
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,611
Again,
I like,

121
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:07,490
hi.
I really don't claim to be an expert in

122
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,330
index extract,
but yet you've got a bottle and I'm sure

123
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,840
I have,
I have a bottle of it was,

124
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:14,560
it was in with all my other supplements
in it and uh,

125
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,690
I was packing up this morning and
thought it would be an interesting one.

126
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,080
It is interesting to show it to you.
Just a giant bottle of that says aunt on

127
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:21,920
it.
What is the,

128
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,580
what's the standard way that people take
it to the daughter or as a tincture?

129
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,510
Yeah,
I would imagine you could probably put

130
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,570
it in a smoothie,
you know,

131
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,240
with your,
with your bee pollen,

132
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,800
other insect derivatives.

133
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,570
Yeah,
yeah,

134
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,780
yeah.
But yeah,

135
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,240
what a weird one.
Huh?

136
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,830
And this guy,
when I was young,

137
00:06:40,831 --> 00:06:42,830
it was beating me up and the bus all the
time.

138
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:44,730
It was ridiculous.
Really Collides me.

139
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:46,880
I'd like,
I did that spence that you can tight

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,950
like this.
It was,

141
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:50,870
I take enough.
And so I was that gun on dowhere and

142
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:54,010
find everybody in front of a girl.
He was beating me up all the time and it

143
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:56,990
was stronger than me.
Was like treat four years older than me

144
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:59,000
and it was tall and strong.
Guys,

145
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,690
I'll keep layer back in the day and now
I couldn't beat him.

146
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,020
It given him with Marshall,
it was always stronger than me.

147
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:11,000
He hurt me a lot,
like back in the day and so my dad,

148
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:14,330
one time I was got beat up in the bus.
I told him because I came back with a

149
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:15,770
black guy one time in my life.

150
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,040
I told my dad what happened.
I never said anything,

151
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,210
but I sent my dad to say,
yeah.

152
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:20,921
He's like,
I ended up bus.

153
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:23,210
He beat me up and said,
tell him the name of the guy.

154
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,980
So my dad was.
He did

155
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,980
you found out where?
I'm from countryside so everybody knows

156
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,440
who everybody lives.
It goes to Dallas.

157
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,390
Know I can tell the dog to the Daddy,
say,

158
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:39,770
listen and stuff.
Can you tell your son to stop hitting my

159
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:43,760
son in the bus because he need to be
focused on this school and that Dad,

160
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,590
when my dad came back he said,
hey,

161
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,390
I went to talk to his dad is going to
stop.

162
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,440
So he said that is that it was like
drinking and stuff and it was beating

163
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,530
the shit out of his son.
So the way this guy learn to communicate

164
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,650
to his dad was beating up.

165
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,250
He was drunk and beating him up.
That's the way it was communicate,

166
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,950
communicating with me.
It was beating me up because he learned

167
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:12,200
that the same way from is that to
communicate.

168
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,960
So I was just happened to be at the
right,

169
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,400
right the wrong time at the right time
in his life at the perfect,

170
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:21,320
you know,
I was the guy that was getting beat.

171
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,810
So when I say good and bad,
he was not a bad person to my version of

172
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:30,770
life too,
for my perspective.

173
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,410
It was a terrible person back them.
It was terrible.

174
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:36,200
I wanted to kill him.
You and like many making my and my

175
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:39,860
school time miserable man.
I wasn't affiliated all the time.

176
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,400
It was getting beat up and I had,
I was very proud person.

177
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,590
So I used to go fight him all the time
because I was proud and at one point I

178
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:48,860
fought him.

179
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,000
So many times you say,
I like this guy,

180
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:53,130
he's completely insane.
I stop buttering him because I was never

181
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,040
good at giving up even though it was
beating,

182
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,650
getting beat up all the time,
but to my arm eyes he was a bad person,

183
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,330
but true.
His eyes,

184
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,880
it was a different star.
We enjoy.

185
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:05,320
His spotter was a different story today.
Everybody.

186
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:09,690
It was a different story just to say
that when I met him that way we talk

187
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,570
about like,
it feels so good just to meet him in the

188
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:15,120
street and make kind of a piece and give
him money.

189
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:15,751
Like,
yeah,

190
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:17,100
you beat me up.
You didn't.

191
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,900
But you know what?
Even though you did that,

192
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,620
I give you the money and I made me feel
like I'm kind of a revenge.

193
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,730
Better than a revenge.
You make me feel like,

194
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,260
yeah man,
you see without me,

195
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:31,410
you wouldn't have nothing maybe to sleep
or eat tonight,

196
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,820
so I give it to you.

197
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,770
I still give it to you if you do that to
me,

198
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,450
that make me feel much better than if I
would like beat him up.

199
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,330
Yeah.
So you,

200
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,110
you ended up revaluing those kinds of
things and that the,

201
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,930
so that was a really important takeaway
for me.

202
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,110
The other was having an experience of
ego dissolution that which can be scary,

203
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,400
can also be very blissful if it's then
followed by a merging with nature or

204
00:09:56,401 --> 00:10:00,270
other people.
And I do think that is the therapeutic

205
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,900
agent in these people who are healed,
that our ego does keep us from

206
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:11,460
perceiving certain things and it
enforces really destructive stories.

207
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:14,670
We tell ourselves like I can't get
through this day without a drink.

208
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,800
I'm unworthy of love.
Uh,

209
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,130
you know,
the voice of self criticism all and we

210
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:23,820
get trapped in these loops.
And especially as we get older.

211
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,640
And that's one of the reasons I think
psychedelics are actually more valuable

212
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:30,150
the older you get because we are
creatures of habit.

213
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,200
And by now we have these mental
algorithms that organize our,

214
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,010
our,
our response to everything.

215
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,170
And sure,
that's very efficient,

216
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,670
but it blinds you to experience.
It blinds you to the every day,

217
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:45,170
wonders and secondary,
you know,

218
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,590
softens those habits and,
and,

219
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:52,530
and helps you get out of those grooves.
And for me that was really useful and

220
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,950
it's only,
I think it's the experience of ego

221
00:10:55,951 --> 00:11:00,090
dissolution that allows you to.
Because your ego enforces those habits

222
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,460
and you get a little break.
There's a beautiful metaphor.

223
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,990
One of the scientists I interviewed in
the book,

224
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:07,230
a Dutchman working in imperial college
in London,

225
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:10,410
he said,
think of your mind is a hill covered in

226
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:15,411
snow and your thoughts are sleds going
down that hill and after awhile after a

227
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:18,180
lot of thoughts have gotten that hill,
there'll be these grooves.

228
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:20,370
And then getting to get deeper and
deeper and a certain point,

229
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:23,280
you can't go down the hill without
slipping into those groups.

230
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,770
That's who we are is we're like,
you know,

231
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,810
at this age.
And um,

232
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,910
what psychedelics do,
he said his is flattened,

233
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,590
the snow,
lots of fresh powder and you can then

234
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,250
take the slit anyway you want to go.
That is a great way of describing it.
