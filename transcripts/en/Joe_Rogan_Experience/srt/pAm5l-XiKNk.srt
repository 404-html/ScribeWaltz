1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,990
Oh Shit,

The full charges as gentlemen,

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,440

Rogan experience.

00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,370

a one dozen red roses and you get 
another dozen free.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh Shit.
Red Roses today.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,120
That's a strong power move.
Like two dozen red roses.

11
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:44,020
That's like telling someone that you're 
really into.

12
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,460
I know your last man gave you a dozen 
baby.

13
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:51,060
I'm coming to.
They're coming in fresh,

14
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:55,290
slightly chilled.
Two dozen red roses for just 29,

15
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,690
$99.
$20 off the original price.

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,870
That's pretty sweet.
It makes you look like a bar and it's 

17
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:02,870
actually not that much money.
Twenty $9.

18
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,201
Ninety nine to live like a bar,
like two dozen red roses like that's 

19
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,670
Kapow.
That's you're showing massive amounts of

20
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:13,671
affection.
There's going to be wet panties after 

21
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:13,671
that.
Instantly.

22
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:16,260
Full charge predicts.
Wet panties with Japan is.

23
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,780
Well,
that's because you're the one who's been

24
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,610
given them them flowers,
right?

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,250
They know it's coming from the full 
charge.

26
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,590
Two dozen double pistol,
Bam,

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,270
paying two dozen red roses for just 29,
99.

28
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,970
Ladies and gentlemen,
you could just buy them and take them to

29
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:34,440
a bar and make some extra cash.

30
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,830
Be Annoying.
Fucking annoying is that man.

31
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:42,640
If you're a day now for the navy,
come on.

32
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:44,030
That's such a cheap movie,
but that's.

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,970
Think of how much money you wanted to 
buy a flower.

34
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:47,380
I would be at a flower store.
Okay.

35
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:52,381
I'm not sitting in a restaurant and 
someone comes up and tries to sell me 

36
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:52,381
bike tires.
All right?

37
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:56,910
If I want a flower,
I'd be at a place that fucking sells 

38
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,460
flowers.
Not on a special date at a restaurant,

39
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,170
not trained to buy flowers,
bitch.

40
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,380
The next level is bringing a bag of 
oranges up to the table.

41
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,200
An off ramp back.
What'd you guys do?

42
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,980
Like to buy gum?
Maybe that's the next pressure.

43
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,780
Move.
Takes your breath.

44
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:12,920
Stinks.
Perhaps some gum gums.

45
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,890
I said Elca pottery last night and they 
were trying to.

46
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,950
This woman comes up and goes,
would you like a complimentary postcard 

47
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:19,950
photo?
And I'm like,

48
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,930
no.
And then I heard the person next to me 

49
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:24,930
goes,
oh,

50
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:24,930
it's complimentary.
She goes,

51
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,270
well it costs $10 for me to take the 
photo.

52
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,890
That so slick.
If you're doing shit like that,

53
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:32,300
your product sucks.
A fat one,

54
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,180
not like stamps.com.
Not like,

55
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,510
not like ting,
not like audible.

56
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,770
Now like one 800 flowers.com.
Not like our bad ass sponsors.

57
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,180
One 800 flowers.com.
That's two dozen red roses.

58
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:52,210
Just 29 99.
And that's $20 off the original price.

59
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,850
But this is only available today today.
Like don't just do it.

60
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,290
Pitch,

61
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,670
Scared.

65
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,620
upper right hand corner and enter J R,
e dot.

66
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,980
That's the code for this show.
That's one 800 flowers.com.

67
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,360
And enter jre or call one 800 flowers.
And mentioned jre.

68
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,490
I would.
I like calling people,

69
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,270
man.
I'm fucking.

70
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,730
I'm not ordering things online anymore.
I'm done.

71
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,670
I need to speak to humans.
There's a disconnect.

72
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,780
Yeah,
right.

73
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,900
I hear target just got hacked.
Really heard it on the news that said 

74
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,950
like if you've ever shopped at target or
online,

75
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,450
no,
you're fucked.

76
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:45,490
You're going to credit card.
That is everybody we need is everybody 

77
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,960
just everything's going through 
computers.

78
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:51,961
It's just numbers and fucking data.
It's nice to talk to a person every now 

79
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:54,370
and then,
especially if they live in America.

80
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,560
It's really disconcerting.
It feels strange.

81
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:04,561
Not there's anything wrong with talking 
to people from India and most certainly 

82
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:05,350
is nothing wrong with talking to people 
from India,

83
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:06,390
but when you're on the phone with 
someone,

84
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,850
you know they're not even in America.
It's a head trip.

85
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,030
It's like what Dell?
What did you do?

86
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,400
Why?
Whatever companies do it.

87
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,050
Like what?
What are you doing?

88
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,110
Why is he these people on the other side
of the world in a sweat factory phone 

89
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,551
answering.
It makes you feel like the company 

90
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:28,351
doesn't care about any of us.
At the end it feels like you're being 

91
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:33,361
put off,
but you gotta think like how many 

92
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:35,980
knucklehead fucking phone calls if you 
are running a computer company,

93
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,400
say if you're selling windows computers 
and you've got a customer service line,

94
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:45,401
just stop and think about the fucking 
numb skull questions your friends have 

95
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,270
asked you about their computers.

96
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,170
Like you know that one friend that 
didn't get a laptop until he was 30.

97
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,350
Alright,
alright.

98
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,640
I'm getting in and starts asking 
questions.

99
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,180
She had something wrong with my video 
drive.

100
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:56,860
Like,
oh,

101
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,450
there's something wrong with your video 
drive.

102
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,920
Yeah,
that makes a lot of sense.

103
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,340
How fucking what?
Where were you living when you live in 

104
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:05,340
it?
You didn't understand the computer.

105
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,050
What's cut and paste?
What am I supposed to do that with 

106
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,050
gateway?
Man,

107
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,630
it was the worst.
Yeah,

108
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:12,030
you did that.
So what I'm,

109
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,160
what I was thinking is that that job is,
you know,

110
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,170
that's like nobody wants that.
That's the reason why they pawn it off 

111
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:20,470
after a.
they'd probably fuck it.

112
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,700
We can,
we can't do this.

113
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,740
This is ridiculous.
We can't really give advice.

114
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,980
He gives good advice.
These motherfuckers will never get off 

115
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:28,980
the phone,
they can't figure out anything.

116
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,580
They don't know too much.
I got to come to your house.

117
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,220
I'm going to sit down with you for hours
on end.

118
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,130
You have to be interested in learning.
Yeah,

119
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,600
that's the tough part.
If you're starting from scratch now,

120
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,670
you know,
fucking too much,

121
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,700
man.
We've adapted all of our skills and 

122
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:44,860
searching,
clicking and pasting and control,

123
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:47,570
seeing and control all the leading and 
we,

124
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,180
we've,
we've,

125
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,090
we've been fucking hitting keyboards for
so long when someone's never done it and

126
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,360
they're like looking for the why and 
like,

127
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,290
oh,
I'll come back tomorrow.

128
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,130
There's a new pop

129
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,380
machines that they have where you can 
choose all the different flavors.

130
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,460
Like coke,
coke,

131
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,800
orange.
I was behind an old couple of last night

132
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:06,440
at Boston market and it took them like 
10 minutes.

133
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:11,441
Just a poor cocacola.
Well there used to places where they 

134
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:13,760
actually are the options.

135
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:20,070
They're from a generation where they 
ordered a coke and then someone brought 

136
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,070
it to them.
Well,

137
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,110
you didn't have to work at the 
restaurant

138
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,270
as well.
Made the coke at the place.

139
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,050
We'll just get through these sponsors 
real quick.

140
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,510
Um,
we're also brought to you by ting.

141
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,560
If you go to [inaudible] dot ting.com,
if you never heard of ting.

142
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:31,270
Ting is,
uh,

143
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,730
one of our favorite sponsors because 
it's the only one that we have other 

144
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,760
than squarespace.
And I think I've never heard anybody say

145
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:41,180
a single negative thing about it.
Everybody who's used it loves it.

146
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,500
Guys that are on the podcast regularly,
like Chris Ryan,

147
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,750
he used it,
says it saved them money.

148
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,110
They say that 98 percent of people would
save money with Ting and that's what it 

149
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,090
says on their website because they do 
mobile differently and what they mean by

150
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:57,230
that is that,
first of all,

151
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,160
they don't have contracts.
You don't have to be connected with them

152
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,860
in a way that it makes it really 
uncomfortable to get out of it.

153
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,760
What they have is real straightforward,
no nonsense cellular service.

154
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,750
It's available on the sprint network.
They buy time on the sprint backbone.

155
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,650
So you're dealing with a really high end
cell phone signal.

156
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,710
You're dealing with four G,
you're dealing with the top Nokia 

157
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,671
devices that top Samsung devices,
all the bad ass android devices on the 

158
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:32,351
big screen.
Once that's what they sell and you can 

159
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,351
bring them over from,
um,

160
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,880
from a sprint as well.
Uh,

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,920
if you,
if you have phones for sprints,

162
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:39,140
particularly even iphones for the 
forecast,

163
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,510
you can bring them over from sprint.
What,

164
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,530
what they're trying to do is give you a 
no bullshit cell phone service where 

165
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,240
they don't have to rip you off.
They charge you a decent rate for an 

166
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,010
excellent service and everybody's happy.
It's just an ethical way to do business.

167
00:07:55,011 --> 00:08:00,011
It's a,
it's an interesting approach and we've 

168
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:01,400
had nothing but positive feedback from 
the people that have used it.

169
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,180
I don't know,
Brian saved $100 or something when he 

170
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,180
was in.
What was it?

171
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,100
I save $100 every month using my team,
my,

172
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,830
my bill last month and I've been since I
got this galaxy note three,

173
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:16,400
I've been using it like crazy.
And My bill last month was 27 bucks.

174
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,790
You can buy six dozen roses with the 
fucking sell it.

175
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,900
Sell it,
flipped them roses.

176
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,940
Yeah.
Thing.

177
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,350
It's confusing.
Ting

178
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,040
has the phone that I'm using right now,
which was the Samsung Galaxy note three.

179
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,800
It's fucking amazing.
I'm so into this phone.

180
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,460
I've never had a better phone for doing 
everything that.

181
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,060
Yeah,
it's just so big that it just makes me,

182
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,780
uh,
makes me like,

183
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,550
look like iphones will play toys now.
It's such a rich experience.

184
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:51,960
Like,
you know,

185
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:55,000
like if you go to a website,
you almost get a real website.

186
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,040
It's like you're moving it

187
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,990
around.
Shit fits in my back pocket.

188
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:00,090
Tim has that.
They also have the galaxy s four,

189
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,670
which is a,
another really pretty dope,

190
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,650
a Samsung phone.
They have all the best of the um,

191
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,580
what is off the sprint network?
All the best phones that uh,

192
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,920
you could get like,
um,

193
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,430
it was the nexus to.
What was it?

194
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,590
There's a bunch of nexuses galaxy mega 
black also.

195
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,500
They have to admit that that megaphone,
which is even bigger than it note,

196
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,890
or they have that crazy thing.
Yeah,

197
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:25,290
they have,
I think it's bigger.

198
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,190
I,
you know what else I have?

199
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,890
I have that htc one that is also another
excellent phone.

200
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,440
That phone is beautiful too.
Like the build quality.

201
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:33,750
It's all aluminum.
It's pretty sleek.

202
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,620
That's that one on the far right.
That's bad ass.

203
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,310
Nice.
That's probably the right side.

204
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:43,311
I always say that people like,
my phone's probably too big like three 

205
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:43,311
months from now,
but like what am I doing?

206
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:44,970
This big fucking stupid thing on my 
ipad.

207
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,670
I'm starting to not like this flap as 
much.

208
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,530
Like the slabs.
Annoying.

209
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,920
Yeah.
Because I don't like the book.

210
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,320
I think I'm going to go back to a 
regular case.

211
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,860
Yeah,
me too.

212
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,840
Because it seems like you have to hold 
it weird.

213
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,150
It doesn't feel like it can grip it or 
what do you got?

214
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,770
You've got a mirror in the.
In the flap.

215
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,430
Dan.
Handsome.

216
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,840
I keep.
Keep my powder.

217
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,860
Open it up.
Imagine there's like a little lip balm.

218
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,900
Their little thing you unscrew.
Um,

219
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,590
at first I thought it was really cool 
and now it's annoying.

220
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,880
Yeah,
it just doesn't feel good on the hand.

221
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:16,770
It's,
well,

222
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,030
it's goofy for.
You're trying to.

223
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,220
If you're trying to do anything with one
hand,

224
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,460
I feel like you have to spin it around 
and hold it in place and I guess it's 

225
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:25,460
not that bad.
Not too bad.

226
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,351
Maybe I'll miss it when it's gone,
but for now get all depressed.

227
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,540
Go to Rogan.ting.com.

And as we said,

229
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:41,070
they're all the top of the line.
Android phones,

230
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,770
the ones that uh,
I'm actually using right now.

231
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,650
So we'll go there.
Get yourself some fucking roses.

232
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,650
I wouldn't give it that nice one and 
read that one that you have been in red.

233
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,140
Oh,
the htc one is awesome phone.

234
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,230
I'm Brogan Dot Ting.com.
Go there.

235

service from an excellent provider.
Uh,

237
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,710
I shouldn't say cheap.
Inexpensive people.

238
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:06,930
Don't like cheap.
An expensive.

239
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,990
Learn that Phil charge.
This is called advertising lingo.

240
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,880
I'm trying to school you sign.
It's a bargain.

241
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,070
It ain't cheap.
It's a fucking bargain.

242
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,890
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com on it is o n n I t,

243
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,040
and if you've paid attention to,
uh,

244
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,650
some of the more recent things about 
vitamins a,

245
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,720
there's a,
a fascinating blog that aubrey put up 

246
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,750
over it on it.
Vitamins.

247
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:36,070
There's all this debate about whether or
not these new studies showed vitamins to

248
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:38,180
be,
uh,

249
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,580
to be dangerous or have to be 
ineffective.

250
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,340
And the study is actually a really 
pretty limited.

251
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,700
I was kind of shocked that they would 
make the conclusions from this study 

252
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,880
that they made because what the study 
showed was first of all,

253
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:54,040
people who had already had heart disease

254
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,210
and these are very minimal doses of 
synthetic vitamins too.

255
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,600
And they showed people with a heart 
heart that had already had heart 

256
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,930
attacks,
like recovery from heart attacks.

257
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,410
People showing a cognitive decline.
And I forget there was one other one,

258
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,980
but the idea behind it was that they 
were showing that vitamins we're just 

259
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,780
not effective.
And that because in these three cases 

260
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,961
that they're stating that they didn't 
show in a positive impact using what are

261
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:30,490
essentially synthetic vitamins.
The best way to get vitamins for sure is

262
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:35,491
from food,
but if you want to get high level 

263
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:39,511
nutrients like really high levels in 
your body to the point where it's 

264
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:43,351
affecting you in positive ways,
like with a nootropic or with a vitamin 

265
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:43,351
B,
12,

266
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:46,450
when you're exercising to actually get 
that all from food.

267
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:48,790
Holy Fuck Shit.
A lot of weird shit.

268
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,930
A lot of planning.
Yeah.

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This.
The idea that these vitamins don't work 

270
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,111
is silly.
There's a reason why everyone knows by 

271
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:58,390
vitamin 12 gives you energy.
It's because it's universally accepted.

272
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,440
If you take a shot of vitamin B 12,
if they give it to you inter muscularly,

273
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,500
it has an impact on your energy.
There's no doubt about it.

274
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,150
When you work out,
you feel like you have more,

275
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,800
more energy,
more Gusto.

276
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,770
You have more vibrance to it.
Fucking make it mean.

277
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,890
That's a pretty important discovery that
a vitamin gives your body more energy to

278
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:18,730
push hard,
but it does.

279
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,420
It really does work like B.
Twelve is about as rock.

280
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:27,421
Solid science is against.
These are the reason why these things 

281
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:27,421
have all been isolated,
like they know what the effects of these

282
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:32,221
things are and there's a gang of studies
that showed a different improvements and

283
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,280
people that had taken vitamins for 
infectious illness,

284
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:41,620
for mood and stress,
cognition,

285
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,760
work,
stress.

286
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,850
They even did a study on juvenile 
delinquency and they showed an 

287
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:47,960
improvement in juvenile delinquency.
Yeah,

288
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,680
and the lack of it.
If you give the kids healthy vitamins,

289
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,190
well,
I read something in that that most of 

290
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,171
the people that commit suicide are 
vitamin deficient and I don't know if 

291
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,950
vitamins can help you with that,
but while it says something right there,

292
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:02,980
I mean it makes you really unhappy if 
you don't have all your vitamins.

293
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:04,900
There's no doubt.
I think a lot of people with the average

294
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:07,870
American diet are vitamin deficient and 
it's way better,

295
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,040
way better to get your diet in order and
then slept.

296
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:17,380
It's way better,
but I don't think there's ever any wrong

297
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:22,381
reason to supplement as long as you're 
getting good vitamins and nutrients and 

298
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:24,280
that's where it gets weird because all 
vitamins are not created equal.

299
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,760
So when he makes like an irresponsible 
statement where you like case closed,

300
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:32,761
vitamins don't work,
that's really silly because you're your 

301
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:32,761
actual studies.

302
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:34,840
They didn't prove that at all.
In fact,

303
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,600
it does work.
There's a reason why they know that,

304
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,260
that scurvy is cured by vitamin C.
it's a vitamin C deficiency.

305
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,980
We have isolated all of these compounds 
that are crucial to human health.

306
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,030
They know what the fuck they are.
Doesn't.

307
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,530
If the FDA loved to say vitamins don't 
work,

308
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,070
I don't know who's saying it.
I think it's just these doctors that 

309
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,070
are,
uh,

310
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,800
that,
that put together a case,

311
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,790
um,
with these,

312
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,470
uh,
multivitamin researchers.

313
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,160
But it's,
look,

314
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:03,100
they've got us talking about it,
you know,

315
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:04,940
it's,
it's certainly something to be discussed

316
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:09,941
because I think they're right writing a 
lot of ways and what they're right in a 

317
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:12,911
lot of ways is that if you take like a 
standard multivitamin and you don't know

318
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:15,050
the source of it,
you don't know if it's food base.

319
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:16,880
You don't know if it's plant based,
you don't know where they are.

320
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:20,990
Extracting their nutrients from you,
you're very likely to get.

321
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,080
Doesn't absorb.
Right?

322
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:24,830
Yeah.
Well,

323
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,160
it it most certainly doesn't absorb as 
well as the food,

324
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,180
but you're,
you're.

325
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,250
You don't know what levels you're 
getting.

326
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:32,950
Like you don't know.
You don't know where,

327
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,020
where they're extracting it from,
how much bile availability is in these 

328
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,010
vitamins.
All vitamins are not created equally and

329
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:42,080
the way you break them down is not 
created equal either.

330
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Like those,
those one a day things will have blue 

331
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,120
tablets.
They famously find those fucking things 

332
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,121
in the bottom of those Porta potties and
people shut them out and they see this 

333
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:54,050
little blue bullets.
I've read it online,

334
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:55,760
so it must be true.
I've done no research,

335
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,910
no research port-a-potty research on my 
own.

336
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:02,000
That might be a snitch thing is,
is that what these people are saying?

337
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,270
Are there or are they saying that normal
multivitamin,

338
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,910
you don't absorb any enough to do 
anything?

339
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:12,911
Is that what they're claiming they're 
claiming is that they've shown that 

340
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:14,210
vitamins?
Well,

341
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:16,310
they're basically saying that vitamins 
are not worth your time,

342
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:21,311
that vitamins,
the vitamins don't work enough is 

343
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:24,131
enough.
Stop wasting your money on vitamin and 

344
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:24,920
mineral supplements is the actual title 
of the piece.

345
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,560
They found that most people that use 
Porta potties have diarrhea.

346
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Well that that's crazy.
It's say it's out of there quick little 

347
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,090
raft ride.
You also don't use it unless it's an 

348
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:37,090
emergency.
It's like a log roll down a raft.

349
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,760
Everything out,
everything out of raging river.

350
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,200
I take [inaudible] every morning under 
my tongue and I immediately feel it will

351
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:50,201
be 12 is also proven effective.
It's a joke to say the vitamins and 

352
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:52,430
minerals don't do anything for your body
as a silly statement,

353
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:57,550
so when you see this enough is enough.
Stop wasting money on vitamin and 

354
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,730
mineral supplements and then you look at
their actual findings.

355
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,970
The findings were like there was a very 
limited test done on a.

356
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:09,911
They were male physicians over 65 showed
no improvement in cognitive decline 

357
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,820
using generic multivitamins 
supplementation.

358
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,210
Okay?
That's one.

359
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,160
It's male physicians over age 65.
Okay,

360
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,050
alright.
They still went nutty.

361
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,410
They had a cognitive decline.
Okay,

362
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:32,411
and they showed no improvement in 
cognitive decline using generic 

363
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:32,411
multivitamins.
Supplements.

364
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,750
So fucking what?
That doesn't mean anything like generic 

365
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,750
multivitamins,
supplements,

366
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,191
and you're talking about guys who are 
over age 65 that are already sliding 

367
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:42,560
into the abyss.

368
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,400
You saying vitamins didn't haul them 
from what nature?

369
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,850
Vitamins didn't hold them from the old 
process because that's what you're 

370
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,430
talking about here.
So that's one part of this study.

371
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,670
Another study showed that high dose 
multivitamins had no effect on the 

372
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,180
progression of heart disease and heart 
attacks of virus.

373
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,570
Okay?
Now you're talking about people who had 

374
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,900
fucking heart attack and then you give 
them multivitamins and you're.

375
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:11,901
You're saying that vitamins didn't hell,
how the fuck do you know that it didn't 

376
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:12,990
have an effect on progression of heart 
disease?

377
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,110
How the fuck do you know that they 
wouldn't have already gotten even 

378
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,101
quicker,
a relapse of a heart attack if they 

379
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,831
weren't taking vitamins like the 
person's dying already had a heart 

380
00:18:24,831 --> 00:18:25,710
attack.
If you have one heart attack,

381
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:27,390
you're.
You're very likely to have another.

382
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:31,020
So saying that multivitamins don't work 
because it didn't stop that.

383
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,260
This is crazy talk.
You're talking about people that are 

384
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,260
already dying.
It just seems very irresponsible.

385
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,330
It's very irresponsible.
It's irresponsible and very suspect.

386
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:41,490
It doesn't make any sense and I should 
point out that it on it.

387
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:44,070
We don't sell multivitamins,
we don't sell any of that shit.

388
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,270
We sell only food based stuff because 
the closer it is to food,

389
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,490
the easier it is for your body to digest
it.

390
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,510
It's just really simple stuff.
With synthetic stuff can work,

391
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,390
but it doesn't work as good for your 
body.

392
00:18:57,391 --> 00:19:02,391
Like it's not as bioavailable as what 
you can extract from food and that's why

393
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:06,000
when we sell vitamins we try to sell 
like like supplements.

394
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,530
If it's green stuff,
it's like spirulina and chlorella.

395
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,240
That's how you say it.
I don't know one ever say it.

396
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:15,260
I just read it and then green 
supplements.

397
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,490
There's way better to get it in food 
though.

398
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,890
And what is this?
Just like dehydrated food or what?

399
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,980
Well,
I don't know how they extracted the 

400
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,440
extract is probably probably says it on 
the website somewhere,

401
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,680
but it's essentially they're extracting 
nutrients from from Greens and grass and

402
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:36,051
things along those lines and you just 
mix this shit in water and you get a 

403
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:39,570
better nutritional response than just a 
cheeseburger.

404
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:42,360
And fries that ain't doing anything.
It's.

405
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,280
It'll be better for you than a lot of 
things.

406
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,550
It's just a supplement and having 
supplements,

407
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,480
it allows us in our busy everyday life 
too.

408
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,380
You know,
you can,

409
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,390
you can,
you can boost your body's performance,

410
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,270
you can give yourself a little bit of an
edge and a lot of different areas.

411
00:19:57,271 --> 00:20:02,271
Whether it's workouts to taking 
something like shroom tech sport which 

412
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:02,820
is based out of the quarter steps 
mushroom.

413
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:08,450
It's been proven that the quarter 
mushroom has a really positive effect on

414
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,550
your body's ability to process oxygen.

415
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,090
And it's really interesting stuff 
because they first learned about it from

416
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:20,091
high altitude hurting populations and 
apparently what had happened was their 

417
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:22,400
cows would eat these mushrooms is 
quarter eps mushrooms and they,

418
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:26,090
they became more active and they were 
noticing that they're more mobile.

419
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:26,790
Well,
they're living,

420
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,820
they're more active than moving around 
more and they,

421
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,840
they pieced it together and figured out 
that this is a mushroom that they were 

422
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,710
eating and when they were eating this 
mushroom,

423
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:36,060
that's when they started having this 
response.

424
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,840
So that also is mixed with a very 
bioavailable form of vitamin B 12 and 

425
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:48,590
it's an awesome supplement to take about
an hour before you work out all these 

426
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,261
things work and we're so confident that 
they work that we have a 90 day 30 pill 

427
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:55,090
moneyback guarantee when you buy new 
mood,

428
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:58,890
which is a five htp supplement,
um,

429
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,430
which is designed to give your body the 
building blocks for Serotonin,

430
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,670
give your body the building blocks to 
make your brain actually feel better 

431
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,250
when all this stuff is fascinating 
stuff.

432
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,380
And there's a lot of science behind five
htp as well,

433
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:13,780
and all the other different supplements.
It's all listed on it.

434
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:19,050
Go to o,
n n I t this commercials too long and 

435
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,601
entering the code name,
Rogan and save yourself 10 percent off 

436
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:22,000
any and all supplements.
All right,

437
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,530
boom.
The full charges here,

438
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,390
gentlemen,
let's get freaky.

439
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,020
Yes.

440
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,040
podcast.

441
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,500
The full chart.
By the way,

442
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:42,250
I have spoken to the actual Nick Diaz 
himself,

443
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,880
the man in the train by day video.
Yeah.

444
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,440
And he,
he's going to do the podcast,

445
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,740
allegedly nick.
He's,

446
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,700
he's a,
he's a free spirit.

447
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,850
He might change his mind.
Right,

448
00:21:52,851 --> 00:21:53,420
right,
right.

449
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,480
Like you're free.
You're free spirit.

450
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,280
A Duncan trussell budding.
Yeah.

451
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:57,580
Well,
no.

452
00:21:57,581 --> 00:22:00,490
Well,
Duncan had a very legitimate reason.

453
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,080
One hundred percent legitimate reason 
that he couldn't podcast today.

454
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,540
That's all good.
No,

455
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:04,840
no,
no,

456
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,900
no,
but it's a personal reason and he'll be 

457
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:15,031
on Tuesday.
People used to mistake us for one 

458
00:22:15,031 --> 00:22:15,970
another back in the day because I never 
have,

459
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,350
you know,
what is it?

460
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:22,351
The glasses?
I think it was the nose and we both got 

461
00:22:22,351 --> 00:22:22,351
big teeth.
When I saw him,

462
00:22:22,351 --> 00:22:23,890
I'm like,
that's my brother from another mother.

463
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,880
Really?
I mean,

464
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,740
you get older,
you start to look different.

465
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,890
It's not the same thing anymore,
but when I met him when we were both 

466
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,330
younger and someone has called me a 
Duncan trussell looking motherfucker.

467
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,190
That's a quote.
That was the guy that knew you were a 

468
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,190
comic.
Yeah,

469
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,441
this was fat jams.
I don't know if you knew that Jay 

470
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:43,441
course.
I knew James.

471
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:45,640
I was very sad when he passed.
I miss that guy.

472
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:46,760
He was a sweetheart.
Yeah.

473
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,710
Fat James for the comedy store and he 
called himself Pat James Folks.

474
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,110
Sure.
He put his hand out and say,

475
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:55,040
fat James.
Hi James.

476
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,360
Pleased to meet you.
He would literally call himself James.

477
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,310
He was a fun guy to be around.
That was his hook.

478
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,110
I'm fat.
Fat.

479
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:05,470
James's story was he came home one 
night.

480
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,810
He was fit.
I guess he was in the military,

481
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:09,010
right?
Wasn't he in the military?

482
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,940
I didn't know him that well.

483
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,220
He wasn't he in the military?
Do you know Brian?

484
00:23:12,221 --> 00:23:17,221
I don't remember that part.
Was either a cop or he's in the 

485
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:17,221
military.
One of those.

486
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:17,221
Anyway,
he was fit.

487
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,910
He was like healthy guy.
He came home and caught his wife and his

488
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:23,260
best friend.
Okay.

489
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,620
And just went off the deep end.
Just started eating,

490
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,750
Huh?
Yeah.

491
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,890
That was a story.
Be In beautiful.

492
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:31,870
Didn't work for them.
I mean,

493
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:33,070
you know,
his wife cheated on him.

494
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,950
Well,
I don't know if it was ever beautiful.

495
00:23:34,951 --> 00:23:36,430
I don't know.
How beautiful did.

496
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,770
What was potential for beauty is.
Yeah.

497
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:39,670
Good guy though,
man.

498
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:41,650
He was a really good guy.
He's a fun guy.

499
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,420
Always around store.
He still.

500
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:48,430
What did he do back there?
He worked for the door to door for 

501
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,100
awhile.
He had that east coast flavor.

502
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,150
I'll tell you what,
the dude.

503
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:52,130
He was fucking funny on stage too.
Yeah.

504
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,130
I saw fat james have some funny sets.
He was ridiculous.

505
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,900
Did a couple stints

506
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,850
on a always sunny in Philadelphia.
Diddy.

507
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,200
Absolutely,
dude.

508
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:04,050
He had some.
He of get some acting work after awhile.

509
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,550
You hear?
Is this him trying to get on this?

510
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,080
They're trying to put him up on a 
mechanical bull.

511
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,660
Oh my God.
Great Hair.

512
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,390
He's so big.
One flip and he's down.

513
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,330
Remember him taking a shower?
He plopped.

514
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,070
This is.
Oh God.

515
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,220
Oh,
that's so hilarious.

516
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,670
Oh,
this is so funny.

517
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:45,470
Jimmy and Joey.
Wow.

518
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,450
Check it out.
I'm getting nostalgic,

519
00:24:48,451 --> 00:24:49,680
man.
You know,

520
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:53,130
I've actually been Jimmy and the Jimmy 
and joey were phenomenal.

521
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,080
Just once,
just on a whim.

522
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,380
The Jimmy and Joey.
What for those that don't know Jimmy and

523
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:01,050
joey is like a.
it's like a double andrew dice clay.

524
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,770
Do you know like brothers version of 
edge,

525
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,290
like Jimmy and Joey,
don't you?

526
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,630
From the back and forth.
It's like,

527
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,090
oh,
come on.

528
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,940
Italians don't like Jehovah's Witnesses.
I don't know what job is.

529
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,590
Windows.
Oh,

530
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,600
tell us don't like any witnesses and 
they just go back and forth with the 

531
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:22,080
setup and then the punchline.
I remember those guys.

532
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,660
So there was always different Jimmy's 
fat Jameson.

533
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,300
And at one point I was a Jimmy James was
the Jimmy.

534
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,430
Oh,
I get what you're saying.

535
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:31,680
So you played during the show.
So

536
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,160
I just did it once.
Oh,

537
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:35,710
that's funny.
So they use like,

538
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,180
they have fake names.
Well yeah,

539
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:43,181
there's the will.
The original Jimmy was really named 

540
00:25:43,181 --> 00:25:45,461
Jimmy.
That's fascinating subject because I 

541
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:45,800
know that guys have sold their acts to 
other people.

542
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:49,280
Like do you remember that guy who had 
defending the caveman?

543
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,140
Yeah,
yeah,

544
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:51,380
yeah.
Broadway thing.

545
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,700
Yeah.
What was that guy's name?

546
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,760
I don't know his name because he was a 
standup and really a fascinating story 

547
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,500
because uh,
he made a ton of money.

548
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:01,990
Yes he did.
He did.

549
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:07,430
Um,
he was a standup and he put together 

550
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,770
like he put a stand up together in the 
form of like a one man show and it 

551
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,460
became very popular.
Uh,

552
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:17,470
Rob Becker is his name,
but then he started like selling it to 

553
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,040
people that they could do it,
like actors,

554
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:21,260
so they could all do it all at once.
All over the country.

555
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,700
Yeah.
Michael Chiklis did it.

556
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,190
No kidding.
Yeah,

557
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:24,740
yeah,
yeah.

558
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,510
No kidding.
I'm almost positive.

559
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,570
Hold on.
Let me pull this up real soon because 

560
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:31,570
they're definitely doing that show in 
Vegas every time I'm there.

561
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,020
By the way.
Michael Chiklis,

562
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:34,250
if you read it,
I'm a huge fan.

563
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,100
He's the shield,
right?

564
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,020
Yeah.
I love that.

565
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,970
The commish yeah.
I'm not goofing on.

566
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,820
Your men did one episode of Seinfeld.
Are we talking about the same guy?

567
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,260
Yeah,
Michael Chiklis.

568
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,160
He was also a the thing in the fantastic
four.

569
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:50,760
Oh yeah,
he did.

570
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,950
Yeah,
he did his Broadway debut in the one man

571
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:54,930
show defending the caveman.
So I was correct.

572
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,000
We don't even need the internet.
I just sort of remember it because I was

573
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:00,360
like,
wow,

574
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:02,730
that's weird.
But I guess I guess it makes sense,

575
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,070
but to a comic,
it's weird.

576
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:05,880
Like,
you know,

577
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:08,580
like you were going to buy an act like 
all of a sudden,

578
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,190
like he like few.
For instance,

579
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,200
let's say when you.
What year did you start out?

580
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,970
A 98.
90 eight.

581
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,240
What if instead of you doing your act,
what if Dave attell just sold you his 

582
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:22,410
act?
Oh,

583
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:27,411
I would love it.
And you would go on stage and you would 

584
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:28,800
do like say like a classic albums.
Thanks for the memories,

585
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:32,670
which is my favorite hotel.
If you went onstage and his and just did

586
00:27:32,671 --> 00:27:37,671
it as Dave attell and it would be.
That would be called the skanks for the 

587
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:37,890
memory show.
Right?

588
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:40,060
And you would hire an actor to do it.
That's weird.

589
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:42,960
It's really weird.
And God damn it.

590
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:43,860
I wish that was available.

591
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:51,630
You want you to think though that like 
there are two totally different things 

592
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:51,630
is why it's weird.
And when you,

593
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,840
when you turn stand up into a one man 
show,

594
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:59,870
then you can get away with anything 
because it's a clearly defined one man 

595
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,890
show and it's just defending the caveman
one man show.

596
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,030
Absolutely.
As a comic you never do that?

597
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,600
No.
No,

598
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:06,870
no,
no,

599
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:07,170
no,
no,

600
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:12,171
no,
you can't do it because every year you 

601
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:12,171
have to have a new act.
Right?

602
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:12,930
So this what,
what's going on?

603
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Is it that this guy figured out a way to
take stand up but transport it into a 

604
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,230
safe zone.
Right.

605
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,140
And then just drop it off where it 
exists in perpetuity,

606
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,310
right?
No more rules.

607
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,400
And now this can be done at the same 
time in all 50 states and you get you in

608
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,280
a way.
You get all the money from it so you 

609
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,280
don't have to tour as much.

610
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,280
You stay in Vegas and do it.
Well,

611
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,850
all your minions do it around the 
country.

612
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,700
That is fucking weird.
What if you started charging show,

613
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:40,530
making the full charge show?
Yeah.

614
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:45,531
You were showing the full charge show.
You would show it in Los Angeles and 

615
00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:49,491
select markets.
Then you would give people licenses to 

616
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:49,491
do it in Atlanta.
First of all,

617
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:54,040
all,
all my minions will have to be called 

618
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,410
the half charge.
But what do you do for a living?

619
00:28:55,411 --> 00:28:59,250
I'm a half charge.
So you do the full charges jokes.

620
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,620
Do you write your own jokes?
I have a lot of my own stuff,

621
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:03,780
but mostly today people want to hear the
full charge,

622
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:05,070
so that's what I do for now.
It's just,

623
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,450
you know,
it's not my dream.

624
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,270
I'm basically a cover band.
Yeah.

625
00:29:08,271 --> 00:29:13,271
This is what pays the bills and then I 
do my own stuff at open mics around 

626
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:16,161
Atlantic city,
but it is fascinating that in our art 

627
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:18,441
form,
the pretentious title that you give to 

628
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:18,870
standup comedy that we all give it.

629
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,930
You're not allowed to do that,
but in almost every other kind of music 

630
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:28,360
you people do that.
Movies or music or any other kind of 

631
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:28,360
entertainment,
right?

632
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,530
Terentino's straight up.
Yeah.

633
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,530
Like copies other movies and it's known 
as an Oma.

634
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,800
Right.
But like with standup,

635
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,820
it's very sacred to us because I think 
it's just because you don't get paid as 

636
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,610
much.
That's probably exactly what it is.

637
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,560
We're just fun.
Where's my piece?

638
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,960
We got our rules.
Oh,

639
00:29:45,961 --> 00:29:47,650
we certainly.
Because it's not.

640
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:49,660
It's not documented.
When we do our stuff,

641
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:52,150
not necessarily will you.
If you have to have.

642
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,210
You not only have to have rules for 
other people,

643
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,430
you have to have rules for yourself too.
You have to.

644
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,460
Everybody has to keep everybody honest 
because the idea of creativity and the 

645
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:07,330
idea of originality and unique thoughts 
and the origin of thoughts.

646
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,120
It's pretty important to us because it's
all we have.

647
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:15,390
All comic has essentially is what he's 
created in his own mind and then put to 

648
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,280
paper our keyboard and then transfers to
the stage.

649
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,680
That's all you have as a comic.
That's all you have.

650
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:23,830
You can jazz it up and dance with it and
do all kinds of shit,

651
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,070
but if you don't have the raw material,
you don't have anything.

652
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:32,370
Exactly.
That's why for us that that honesty 

653
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,210
process is super important.
I also think it's one of the cool things

654
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:39,211
about what we do that we have so many 
comic friends that were constantly 

655
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:44,191
interacting with on a regular basis.
It's always joey and Ari and Duncan and 

656
00:30:44,191 --> 00:30:48,730
you and score and fucking Christ and all
super cool,

657
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:52,450
super honest,
super above board people.

658
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,030
Right,
and so you know,

659
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,830
don't even want to do something that's 
similar to somebody else.

660
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,290
To have known desire and drop shit in a 
heartbeat.

661
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,060
When you find out that it's too close to
something that.

662
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,950
Exactly.
Just go fuck it.

663
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:08,190
It's over the last you want to hear 
someone's comparing you to someone else 

664
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,860
now also you get to hang with and joke 
around with the funniest dudes on the 

665
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,330
planet.
Yeah,

666
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,430
because we all trust each other to just 
fuck around.

667
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,320
Like we all trust each other.
Like,

668
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,630
like Ari was.
I forget what the subject was.

669
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:21,910
We were joking around about something 
the other day and I'm like,

670
00:31:21,911 --> 00:31:23,560
dude,
you got to do that onstage.

671
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,420
And we started working on how he would 
do it onstage.

672
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,990
Like what are you feel like this or like
that.

673
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,070
And when you do that,
like that camaraderie.

674
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:36,970
When you do that for each other,
like you both have an idea or one of you

675
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:40,540
has an idea and the other one tries to 
enhance it and help each other.

676
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,030
That boost boost a saw.
Like I'll get off stage to grow,

677
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,590
have a tagline for me after he said 
that,

678
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:52,591
like maybe that you're calling so much 
easier to write for someone else 

679
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:56,521
sometimes because like there's no 
pressure on what you wrote and you just 

680
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:58,300
get to sit back and watch the other 
person do it.

681
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,180
Then something pops into your head and 
you can just give it like you don't.

682
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,410
I mean it's just all inspiration.
Have you ever tried to write for someone

683
00:32:05,411 --> 00:32:09,130
specifically though for their staff?
Sat down and tried to write for someone?

684
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,140
No.
I know a lot of guys have done that 

685
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,140
though.
Like I know,

686
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,140
um,
uh,

687
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,090
there was a lot of guys that were 
helping Chris,

688
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:21,180
Chris rock when he was putting together 
one of his hbo specials and I think the 

689
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,960
Pollo might've been one of them.
I believe Rich Vos,

690
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,450
Louis ck definitely wrote for Chris Rock
I think because it will also.

691
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:33,450
Chris was doing so many different things
at the same time and probably doing 

692
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,180
movies and shit and I think he just 
liked to have all those minds to help 

693
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,310
him go over his stuff,
which is,

694
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,980
that's a ballsy move,
you know,

695
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,580
have all these bad motherfuckers.
Right.

696
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:41,570
Cool.
Jokes for you.

697
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,630
I know.
And I'll also work with you creating the

698
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:49,160
jokes so you get like the opinions of 
all these expert comedians.

699
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,550
I mean that's a real ballsy move because
a lot of comedians don't want to be 

700
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,290
judged on their performances,
but when you're bringing in guys like,

701
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,280
like Louis C,
k to write for you,

702
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,530
I mean you're going to get the real 
deal.

703
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,680
You're going to get me.
So we're going to be the most honest 

704
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,661
assessment ever of the material and like
a bunch of masterminds like gearing 

705
00:33:07,661 --> 00:33:10,220
together and putting together this 
perfect masterpiece comedy.

706
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,440
Do you personally think that's good 
though?

707
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,400
I think that's.
Yeah,

708
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:14,690
I think that's weird.
It's good.

709
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,730
No,
it's not what I do,

710
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,760
but it's.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

711
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,441
with it.
I think Chris Rock has one of the 

712
00:33:23,441 --> 00:33:25,001
greatest comedians of all time and if 
that's how he did it brilliantly and 

713
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:25,001
it's right there on the credits.
Oh,

714
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:28,340
100 percent by such and such,
such and such.

715
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:30,890
I know Eddie Murphy did it on raw 
keenan.

716
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:33,830
Ivory Wayans wrote on raw.
Absolutely nothing wrong with that.

717
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,990
Nothing wrong with it.
What it's,

718
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:40,991
you know,
especially because of the way they did 

719
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:40,991
it,
which is so above board.

720
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:41,300
They let everybody know they were doing 
it.

721
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,040
No one,
no one hit that.

722
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,280
And not only that,
it's like what's wrong with bringing in 

723
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,280
writers?
There's nothing wrong with it.

724
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,330
It's not unethical.
It's not uncreative.

725
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,220
Just because you're creating with other 
people,

726
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:55,460
it doesn't mean you're not still 
creating and actually be very inspiring.

727
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,720
Yes.
You know,

728
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,600
and uh,
and it could get rid of a lot of doubt.

729
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,000
Yeah.
As far as like,

730
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,270
they're like,
this is what you're doing.

731
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:03,190
That's good.
This is,

732
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,490
you can use this,
blah,

733
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:04,850
blah,
blah.

734
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:07,640
It's exciting to.
Plagiarism is the problem.

735
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:11,690
It's not going to operation cooperation 
and paid cooperation,

736
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:14,960
which is essentially what writing is.
Writing for content is great.

737
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:17,570
It sounds like a great idea.
I don't do it that way,

738
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,510
but I would.
I think it's really common.

739
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:25,511
It's just really personal for me,
so it's like when you're involving 

740
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:27,500
somebody else's idea of what they think 
she should sound like.

741
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:32,501
To me that's just gross.
You got a badge and Chris rock went up 

742
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:35,741
at the seller,
did what he had and then the other guys 

743
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:35,741
contributed.
That's what I'm imagining.

744
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:40,250
I'm very sure of that and then spice 
things up or added or had an idea.

745
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,560
Maybe Chris could run it out.
Just be this.

746
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,890
Getting all of his jokes and his guys.
He was getting a little juice,

747
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,080
little here and there,
little spark and you're getting it from 

748
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,080
like hungry guys who are really good.
They're,

749
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,080
you know,
they're out there.

750
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,650
He's like,
he's not like,

751
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:52,310
Hey Louis,
c k,

752
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:54,950
let's talk about your divorce in my.
I hear what you're saying too though.

753
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:58,760
What I agree with you in a lot of ways 
is that like it's very personal,

754
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,880
but even though it's very personal,
like sometimes another eye on what 

755
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:06,690
you're doing,
they'll open you up to like,

756
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,360
oh,
I didn't even think of that.

757
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,860
And then like,
why?

758
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,240
Oh,
why was I doing it that way?

759
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,220
Because if I didn't,
if I didn't say that,

760
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,260
it would like open up the whole back end
of it.

761
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:20,530
Like there's,
there's a lot of times like some things 

762
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:20,530
that your friends can see that you don't
say.

763
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,550
I know a lot of comics that actually 
have writers and that to me always felt 

764
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,691
really weird because it seems like 
they're just actors or the boyfriends 

765
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,700
boyfriend to call a writer.
What if felt like I came up with this 

766
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,970
black peoples and this Nigga I got this 
idea when

767
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:42,990
it started to get bigger and blacker a 
white guy starts doing the bigger and 

768
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,580
blacker tour and just does all the.
Well,

769
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:46,560
there was a guy doing that for Hicks 
man,

770
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,390
which I thought was really weird.
Yeah.

771
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:53,391
There's a guy that was doing like Hicks 
as a one man show here are,

772
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,700
you know,
the guy was doing,

773
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,050
uh,
Bill Hicks as a one man show.

774
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:02,240
God impersonating Bill Hicks is a one 
man.

775
00:36:02,241 --> 00:36:07,241
Show me Google this.
That's weird because Bill Hicks still 

776
00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:07,250
isn't famous.
Oh,

777
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:12,090
I think he's pretty famous.
Is Larry still around?

778
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,850
Is he on a show or something?
I know they want to craig gas to do a,

779
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:17,680
a,
um,

780
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,000
a kinison vegas thing.
Well,

781
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:22,400
he does an incredible.
Yes in impression.

782
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,840
Um,
I can't find it here anywhere.

783
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,100
There was,
there was a guy,

784
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:32,060
I'm very positive that there was a guy 
who was trying to put together a one man

785
00:36:32,061 --> 00:36:35,170
show and he was just going to do bill 
Hicks like,

786
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,100
like Mark Twain,
sort of a thing.

787
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:42,140
She could go up and do mark Twain today 
because Mark Twain has been dead for a 

788
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,140
long time.

789
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,310
Fucking people are happy to see you.
No one's going to know what he really 

790
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:46,310
was like and be like,
pitch.

791
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,390
That is not how mark twain talks.
We focused.

792
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,130
This is terrible.
This is fucking terrible.

793
00:36:51,131 --> 00:36:54,190
At the pipe down.
You're holding the pipe or the left.

794
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,350
He helped with the right.

795
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,590
Oh God.
But a guy like Hicks,

796
00:36:59,591 --> 00:37:00,400
like,
you know,

797
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:02,980
I saw him in the flesh.
He didn't die that long ago.

798
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,750
When did you see him and where did you 
see him?

799
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,000
I saw him a couple times.
I saw him.

800
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,480
I saw him at least at least three,
possibly four occasions meeting.

801
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,180
I saw him for an entire weekend.
Okay.

802
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,180
And uh,
it was all when he was visiting Boston,

803
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:25,350
he was a big,
like touring pro coming off of the 

804
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:30,301
Rodney dangerfield special was like just
starting to catch heat right as I got 

805
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:35,101
into comedy.
So I was lucky enough to be at a point 

806
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:36,660
where the clubs of let me come by like 
an open mic or.

807
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,670
But the clubs would let me in on a 
Friday night and I could watch God.

808
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:42,130
There's no way I was working with them 
and I was terrible,

809
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:46,390
but they would let me come in and watch 
them at the comedy connection.

810
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,670
The way they ran it and nick's and all 
those places in Boston.

811
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:52,750
It was so cool because they,
they had great comics.

812
00:37:52,751 --> 00:37:57,751
Would come in every weekend.
You'd have guys that would come in like 

813
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:57,751
dom irrera.
I saw him there.

814
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:59,920
They would.
They would all come like and have like a

815
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:04,090
big name headliner.
But they also had this insane community,

816
00:38:04,091 --> 00:38:06,220
have really great comedy around there as
well.

817
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,550
And the way they did it is because they 
super supported open milkers super 

818
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:16,531
supported the new talent.
They knew that new talent is what 

819
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:17,020
becomes headliners one day and you have 
to nurture it.

820
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,840
And they were like big about that.
So when a guy like Hicks was in town,

821
00:38:19,841 --> 00:38:21,900
they would tell me like,
you got to see Hicks.

822
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,500
I'm Paul Barkley told me.
He was like,

823
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,030
you gotta see this guy.
He's fucking tremendous.

824
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,650
I go,
that's the guy from the HBO special.

825
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,370
Right?
And he's just like,

826
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,240
yeah,
but you got to see him.

827
00:38:28,241 --> 00:38:30,280
Like he's just,
he's on another level.

828
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,680
And then I remember seeing him for the 
first time and going,

829
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,890
whoa.
Like guys say they don't a fuck.

830
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,640
Give a fuck.
Everybody gives a fuck man.

831
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,220
I always give a fuck if I give a fuck 
right now.

832
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,830
Fuck what I'm stumbling through a 
squarespace commercial.

833
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:47,440
I can't get my fat tongue to work.
I give a fuck at the supermarket.

834
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:49,990
I don't want to look dumb.
Bill Hicks did not give a fuck man.

835
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:55,050
I'm telling you.
I saw the first guy in my life that 

836
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,571
didn't honestly didn't give a fuck on 
stage when I saw him because the first 

837
00:38:57,571 --> 00:39:01,690
time I saw him we saw him twice in the 
same time period.

838
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:04,360
He came,
he was at the comedy connection and then

839
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:08,200
he came to nick so shortly thereafter 
and I got to see them in both places.

840
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,650
The comedy connection was,
was pretty fucking fascinating.

841
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:16,830
But when he came to nick's,
he went on after a guy that was doing 

842
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:17,590
like impressions of different,
different cartoon animals,

843
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:22,591
smoking pot.
He had like literally had copped donut 

844
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:22,591
jokes.
Um,

845
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:25,030
I mean he was the guy who we went on 
before.

846
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:27,340
It was a funny guy.
He,

847
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:32,370
but he was,
it wasn't the same style of comedy by 

848
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,911
any stretch of the imagination.
It was terrible setup for Bill Hicks 

849
00:39:35,911 --> 00:39:37,600
because it was all like really dopey,
you know,

850
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,460
base shitty comedy.
Right.

851
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,780
Alright.
Hooks goes on after him and just eats 

852
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,280
fat piles of Shit,
just giant plates and plates of Shit and

853
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:53,281
it's by the end of the show,
there's maybe 300 people in this 

854
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:53,440
displacement,
let's say to 50.

855
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,600
There's maybe 50 left at the end of the 
show.

856
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,100
Walk the entire crowd except for 50 
people and me,

857
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:04,240
Greg Fitzsimmons and like three or four 
other local Boston comics.

858
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,240
I can't remember the name.
We were fucking crying.

859
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,840
He didn't give a fuck.
He was doing his bits as if he was 

860
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,620
killing and they were all dying.
Right?

861
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,650
Everything was dying.
The crowd just did not bite except for 

862
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,371
this small core people that were in the 
back that were howling and the comics 

863
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,500
now.
I just worked with somebody recently in 

864
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Indianapolis who has been around for a 
long time and he said,

865
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,450
Bill Hicks had a lot more dick jokes.
Then you think,

866
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,800
oh yeah,
well he used to joke around about it.

867
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,050
Spice up,
you know,

868
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:41,070
any other topic.
You just throw Dick Jokes in between 

869
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,861
them to keep people interested.
He would joke around about having to do 

870
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:45,490
that right where he joked,
but folks,

871
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,540
Dick Jokes are coming.
I've heard that big fat via.

872
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,450
Yeah,
I've heard that.

873
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,240
I mean he was a fascinating comic to me 
because he represents me.

874
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,240
I've had arguments with Ari about him 
because he doesn't think he was funny.

875
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,450
He's a funny guy,
but he's honest about it.

876
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,610
He tells me,
he goes,

877
00:41:02,611 --> 00:41:03,790
it's not funny.
He's like,

878
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:05,710
he's giving makes really good points,
but he's not funny.

879
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,240
What?
What I.

880
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,010
I disagree.
I always laugh at him.

881
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,650
I laughed at him when I saw him in 
[inaudible] 88.

882
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,920
I laugh at it now,
but what I think he represents is the 

883
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,311
first guy that started looking at what 
you talk about on stage completely 

884
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,900
differently.
Like he started to a young man on acid.

885
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,940
Like that whole bit about what?
About a positive.

886
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:31,020
It was really powerful.
Like the non.

887
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,460
What was non bullshit talk?
It was.

888
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:39,830
Was it a way?
It was like when he was doing like 

889
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:39,980
certain bits,
he wasn't just doing a bit.

890
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:45,250
He was doing a bit that plants a seed 
and gets you thinking about a subject 

891
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,091
differently because he's mocked it so 
well that it whenever you try to 

892
00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:52,880
seriously bring up the war on drugs 
after you've heard Bill Hicks talk about

893
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:54,440
it,
you seem like an asshole.

894
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,660
Right,
right,

895
00:41:55,661 --> 00:41:56,120
right,
right.

896
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:01,460
Did he just had a.
It was a fascinating way of mixing ideas

897
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:06,461
into comedy in it.
I think the most powerful way since 

898
00:42:06,461 --> 00:42:09,941
Lenny Bruce,
I personally think he's the most 

899
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:12,011
powerful at it because his,
his impact is felt by I think a 

900
00:42:12,011 --> 00:42:13,510
different era because of the,
uh,

901
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:18,580
because of Youtube.
But because of the videos and the audio 

902
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:18,580
that's available,
the,

903
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,420
the Lenny Bruce Stuff,
if you've tried to go back and listen to

904
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:22,370
it now,
it doesn't really hold up anymore.

905
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:28,560
It's weird.
So you can tell why it was 

906
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:28,560
groundbreaking at the time,
but now it's just like,

907
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,440
Huh.
It's very like beat poet.

908
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:31,730
Very like,
yeah,

909
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,940
rambling Hicks.
I was on a totally different lens did in

910
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:36,710
the eighties too,
you know,

911
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,840
like where there wasn't really a need 
for that.

912
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:42,830
Yeah,
it was the Reagan administration and the

913
00:42:42,831 --> 00:42:47,831
Bush one administration and people were 
getting by on who's squeezes the bottom 

914
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:48,360
of the toothpaste.

915
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,170
You know,
and I'm no disrespect to Seinfeld,

916
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,340
I can't believe.
Where is that song?

917
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,560
What's the deal?
I can't believe whenever I think about 

918
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,831
Bill Hicks,
I just can't believe he was dead and 

919
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:02,831
gone at 32.
Yeah,

920
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:06,820
that blows my mind.
And when you're talking about that acid 

921
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,120
joke that's on tape one dangerous when 
he was 27.

922
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:10,080
It's a brilliant.
Yeah,

923
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,820
I mean St I don't want to show you a 
tape of me and when I was 26,

924
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,660
you don't want to see tape of him when 
he was 17 because he was funny.

925
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:21,661
He was 17.
He was going up at the fucking Houston 

926
00:43:21,661 --> 00:43:24,540
annex and move 17 and was good.
I know and he was clean and he,

927
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,200
I mean clean as far as like his delivery
was clean.

928
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,800
It was really good stuff.
It wasn't the embarrassing shit that 

929
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,040
would represent you or I know he would 
get lost in just.

930
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,690
This is based on the documentary that 
just came out.

931
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:40,691
I saw a couple of years ago he would get
lost and characters of his family and 

932
00:43:40,691 --> 00:43:44,891
like he was just crazy funny and they 
keep it just as good as the guys that 

933
00:43:44,891 --> 00:43:46,940
were twice as age fucking pancreatic 
cancer.

934
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,880
Crazy,
crazy fucking disease.

935
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,480
That's a bad one to allegedly.
Well,

936
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,860
a lot of it is cigarettes.
A lot of people believe that there's a 

937
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,160
correlation between cigarettes.
Pancreas is a thing you can remove,

938
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:01,700
right?
It's like,

939
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:06,790
does nothing.
No extra parts.

940
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:08,960
Right?
Take it out and I'll be a lighter.

941
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,780
Brian's education is based on operation.
The board game,

942
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,480
appendix,
right?

943
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,620
Uh,
you can take your tonsils,

944
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,190
your appendix,
I think.

945
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:18,000
Yes,
you can take in your wisdom 10 decks.

946
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,140
You definitely take out your appendix.
What causes pancreatic cancer?

947
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:22,940
Uh,
aside from advanced age,

948
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:24,620
smoking is the main risk factor.

949
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:25,520
Oh,
great.

950
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:31,120
A smoker's three to four times more 
likely than a nonsmoker to a acquire 

951
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:37,380
pancreatic cancer is your pancreas at 
who knows inside that that body thing.

952
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,120
Cage,
like in the main part,

953
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,040
the main part,
like a bulletproof vest.

954
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,920
Cover it under the flip cage.
What the fuck?

955
00:44:43,921 --> 00:44:48,921
Man?
Cigarettes or so senior arm and Hicks 

956
00:44:48,921 --> 00:44:49,770
smoked a lot of cigarettes and did jokes
about smoking,

957
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,350
argued for cigarettes,
pancreatic cancer.

958
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,700
Got Them motherfuckers.
Well,

959
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,990
so many really talented artists have 
smoke cigarettes.

960
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,210
It's weird.
It's sad.

961
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:04,050
It's sad a lot of ways because it's like
when I see a cigarette smoker,

962
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:06,330
I don't see a person exercising their 
freedom.

963
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:07,950
I know that's what they're doing.
If they want to smoke,

964
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:10,380
they should be able to smoke for sure,
but that's not what I see.

965
00:45:10,381 --> 00:45:13,140
I see a person who's enslaved.
Yes.

966
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,280
That's what I see.
I see enslavement to a habit and also to

967
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,540
a drug at the same time.

968
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:23,570
It's just another addiction.
It's just another thing to do but it 

969
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:26,460
kills you to kills a lot of.
Doesn't get you high,

970
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:31,580
but it's also a weird thing that you 
would get addicted to taking something 

971
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:35,061
lighting on fire and then putting it up 
to your mouth and then breathing it in 

972
00:45:35,061 --> 00:45:36,300
like that.
Just the ritual of doing that can become

973
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:39,660
so ingrained in your life that it 
represents something like after sex,

974
00:45:39,661 --> 00:45:44,661
like people.
Some people like to smoke a cigarette 

975
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:45,570
after sex.
That's like a classic movie scene,

976
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:50,571
right,
where people have sex and then they 

977
00:45:50,571 --> 00:45:50,850
smoke a cigarette you,
but if you really like,

978
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:55,940
what are you watching?
They're watching someone poisoning 

979
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,701
themselves,
like that's a weird thing to find 

980
00:45:58,701 --> 00:45:58,701
romantic.
That's a weird thing they snuck in on us

981
00:45:58,701 --> 00:46:02,880
and how it becomes habit study finds no 
link between secondhand smoke and cancer

982
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:07,860
funded by the tobacco lobbyists of 
America in Florida.

983
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:12,860
It's in Florida.
If you have a case that goes through in 

984
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:12,860
Florida,
it might as well go through on the moon.

985
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,410
They're not.
Americans are tired of people saying the

986
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,600
Florida's America to stop.
We need to cut it out.

987
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:20,540
Even flip live.
My parents live in Florida.

988
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,050
Don't get me wrong,
I love Florida,

989
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:25,920
but that shit is not America.
That is some crazy spot where you can't.

990
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,830
Any studies that come out of there,
who knows?

991
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,410
Who knows what kind of coke they were on
when they made that study?

992
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,240
They can't even trust him to vote.
Right.

993
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:34,750
I mean,
that's fucked up.

994
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,900
That's interesting.
Nicotine and tobacco linked to heart 

995
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:39,900
disease.
Well,

996
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,600
nicotine speeds up your heart rate,
doesn't it?

997
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,160
It makes it work harder than it has to.
Well,

998
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:47,670
I've heard of nicotine being given as a 
supplement before,

999
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,730
which is really bizarre.
Or as medicine before,

1000
00:46:50,731 --> 00:46:52,290
I think it was for a heart issue.

1001
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,320
I find just like anything else in small 
doses,

1002
00:46:55,321 --> 00:47:00,321
every once in a while I that bad,
but a pack a day delivered through 

1003
00:47:00,321 --> 00:47:01,350
fucking cancer,
a smoke and it's so hot.

1004
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,480
Yeah.
Well a lot of stuff is like that,

1005
00:47:03,481 --> 00:47:08,481
man.
We were talking yesterday with Shane 

1006
00:47:08,481 --> 00:47:09,210
Smith from vice about that devil 
Columbian Devil's breath.

1007
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,610
It's called [inaudible] or something 
like that.

1008
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,770
It's dangerous.
The most dangerous drug.

1009
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:18,690
It's the same shit that's in those 
little seasickness tabs that they put on

1010
00:47:18,691 --> 00:47:19,470
you.
You know,

1011
00:47:19,471 --> 00:47:24,471
those things that you get stick they 
stick on you and the seasickness is 

1012
00:47:24,471 --> 00:47:28,341
supposed to be mitigated by this.
That's the same shit at the Columbian 

1013
00:47:28,341 --> 00:47:29,770
Devil's breath stuff,
but it's just like way more way more

1014
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,930
patches,
like barely giving you a hit.

1015
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,050
They're giving you just a taste.
How do you take this dangerous stuff?

1016
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:36,280
Do you smoke it?
You swallow it,

1017
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:37,330
you shoot it.
What do you do?

1018
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:42,420
Uh,
I think they can blow it in your face 

1019
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:42,640
and you just have it in your face and 
you breathe,

1020
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:47,641
just breathing it in,
like having it blown in your mouth and 

1021
00:47:47,641 --> 00:47:47,641
your nose.
You got it,

1022
00:47:47,641 --> 00:47:49,660
you're done.
And then you become like,

1023
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:51,370
literally,
like a little Zombie.

1024
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,470
They tell you what to do.
I can tell you,

1025
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:55,510
go to your bank account,
take out money for me.

1026
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,790
And people do.
And like they have video of people doing

1027
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,870
this.
Wow.

1028
00:47:58,930 --> 00:47:59,890
Wow.
Indeed.

1029
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:03,880
And it's the same fucking thing that you
can get from these patches,

1030
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,360
these dermal patches for sisense.
And then people go,

1031
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:11,140
don't be seasick.
I concentrate on the horizon.

1032
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:13,360
Don't take anything else,
give me $500.

1033
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:19,570
It's,
don't take those fucking don't think 

1034
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:19,570
drama mean I took drama,
mean,

1035
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,280
oh my God,
I went into a dark dark coma.

1036
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,870
What is drawing me mean?
I don't know.

1037
00:48:22,871 --> 00:48:25,750
Drama man,
pussies pussies like me that,

1038
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:27,520
uh,
get on a boat and start getting sick.

1039
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,450
Right?
Right,

1040
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:29,990
right.
Well,

1041
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:32,220
apparently it alleviates nausea.
Uh,

1042
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,600
but for me it was like a tranquilizer 
dart.

1043
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,620
It alleviated everything else to include
in your sight.

1044
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:41,530
And your hearing even was seriously,
my body was like this,

1045
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:43,180
we were,
it was me and my buddy Jimmy,

1046
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:46,120
and luckily he didn't take the drama 
mean and uh,

1047
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,940
we were at the uh,
the diner on the way home and I was just

1048
00:48:48,941 --> 00:48:52,720
sitting in front of him nodding out like
a heroin addict and he's like,

1049
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,010
you all right over there.
He,

1050
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:55,810
you know,
he might have actually taken a drama,

1051
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:56,260
mean to.

1052
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:01,440
He was a lot bigger than me.
Jimmy was like 200 plus pounds and that 

1053
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:01,990
was probably at the time I was 
competing.

1054
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:06,991
So it was probably about 155 pounds and 
I took this one drama main or to drama 

1055
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:07,870
names.
I don't know how many they gave me,

1056
00:49:07,871 --> 00:49:10,120
but I was gone.
So I wake up,

1057
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:14,950
I woke up the next day.
Really?

1058
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,850
Did you enjoy it on you?
And Joe was terrible.

1059
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,280
I took too much probably.
I probably tried to take as much as he 

1060
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,560
was taken.
I don't know what I'm going to ask you 

1061
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:28,560
all.
If you take two,

1062
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,660
I'll take two.
Two guys doing guys.

1063
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,050
Especially that.
I mean,

1064
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,830
we were both teenagers,
right?

1065
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:39,030
That uh,
but it fucking knocked my dick right in 

1066
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,030
the dirt.
Is that a prescription drug?

1067
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:40,960
I think so.
It might be an over the counter.

1068
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,810
I don't know.
I mean the laws might've changed since,

1069
00:49:43,811 --> 00:49:45,760
uh,
this is a long ass time ago.

1070
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,380
Who knows?
Her formula might have changed too.

1071
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:52,790
Right?
But apparently I'm too much of a pussy 

1072
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:53,110
to even take a drama,
drama,

1073
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,750
drama me knowledge time.
It doesn't do anything to them,

1074
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:57,640
not me.
I'm literally,

1075
00:49:57,641 --> 00:50:02,641
we're eating and I'm sitting here like 
this why we're eating sit straight.

1076
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:09,610
It felt so pathetic.
It's pathetic when you falling asleep 

1077
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:09,610
and someone asks you,
are you falling asleep?

1078
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:10,110
Like,
no.

1079
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,200
Right.
Like why am I afraid to admit that I'm 

1080
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:15,200
falling asleep?
Oh yeah.

1081
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,740
When people call me,
I always like,

1082
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,350
hey man,
what's up?

1083
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,100
Are you sleeping?
I'm sorry?

1084
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:21,220
Did like you always lie about something 
feminine about sleeping,

1085
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,150
man,
I'm a man.

1086
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,710
I don't sleep.
That's exactly what it is for weak bitch

1087
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,000
men

1088
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
like ourselves for weak bitch cells.
We don't want to admit facing my engine 

1089
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:35,300
right now.
I'm up at 6:00

1090
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:38,930
every morning and doing sit ups 
crunches.

1091
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,130
I've worked my obliques.
I don't sleep much sleep.

1092
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,430
It's like,
Oh God,

1093
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,860
if the guy's really trying to be 
intimidating,

1094
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:47,800
he says he doesn't need much sleep.
I gotta go vote,

1095
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:49,300
you know,
four hours sleep at night and I got it.

1096
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,510
I got shit to do.
I'm good.

1097
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,120
I'm good for hours.
I'll to the house at 2:00

1098
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:55,110
in the afternoon.
Motherfuckers asleep on the couch.

1099
00:50:55,111 --> 00:50:59,120
Was Dick in his hand watching days of 
our life with an open laptop nearby.

1100
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,860
Truly the fuck up bitch.
I had shit to do.

1101
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,780
You need to sleep.
Everybody needs sleep.

1102
00:51:05,781 --> 00:51:09,320
How dare you.
Sleep is the best I think you can get by

1103
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:13,610
on like if you really want to have like 
a low level mindset,

1104
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,610
you can get by on four hours sleep for a
couple days in a row,

1105
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,840
but after that,
let's be honest.

1106
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,710
Like you're not functioning very well.
You're,

1107
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:22,820
you're imbalanced.
Four hours.

1108
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:23,900
Sleep at night.
Yeah.

1109
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,570
You stood to have weird thoughts.
Your brain doesn't work properly.

1110
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:28,060
It needs his rest.
Maybe you bro.

1111
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,900
None me for hours.
I'm good.

1112
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:35,140
You don't mind.
Rem cycles are just very deep that go 

1113
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:35,140
deep right away.
I'm confident in myself,

1114
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,670
so I go to sleep very quickly.
I'm not worried about predators.

1115
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:41,810
I go out and get it.
I get all my work done,

1116
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,180
my sleep work.
I get it done in four hours.

1117
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:47,030
My body is a unusual.
It's very wolverine.

1118
00:51:47,031 --> 00:51:49,850
Like if I get it scratched,
people can't believe.

1119
00:51:49,851 --> 00:51:51,440
The next day I'll quick.
It's healed.

1120
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,280
It's just me,
bro.

1121
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:54,590
It's just not normal.
Not Normal.

1122
00:51:55,070 --> 00:52:00,070
This is the Jimmy and joey sketch.
This is a repeat every four hours a day.

1123
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:02,540
Sleep guy.
That's my new character.

1124
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,630
Two thousand 13.
I slept 16 hours so I don't give a fuck.

1125
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,740
You know,
I got a lot done.

1126
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,050
I have a new web series and working on 
right now.

1127
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:11,270
I'm very happy with built a shelf.
You know,

1128
00:52:11,271 --> 00:52:13,970
we had a fire to producer this fucking 
asshole.

1129
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:17,240
See my vision,
but this guy sleeps six hours a day.

1130
00:52:17,241 --> 00:52:19,690
Lazy piece of Shit.
Where were we?

1131
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,920
Wrap up at midnight.
I will see you guys at five.

1132
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:22,670
He was like,
no,

1133
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:25,180
we need to turn around fucking 
turnaround.

1134
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:27,500
I'm here to work for production.
People are like,

1135
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:31,100
I've heard you rag on that before.
They're savages.

1136
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:32,350
They,
they,

1137
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:37,351
they,
they push people to work at ungodly 

1138
00:52:37,351 --> 00:52:37,351
hours and it's like standard in 
Hollywood.

1139
00:52:37,351 --> 00:52:40,580
Fourteen hours is like regular total.
Especially if you're working on a single

1140
00:52:40,581 --> 00:52:45,020
camera drama show like those Csi shows 
and the other like those.

1141
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:50,080
I don't know,
I'm wanting to say that one in 

1142
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,191
particular,
but a lot of those single camera like 

1143
00:52:51,191 --> 00:52:53,351
cop shows,
those fucking people are working 16 

1144
00:52:53,351 --> 00:52:56,321
hours a day,
six days a week and the [inaudible] 

1145
00:52:56,321 --> 00:52:56,321
season is forever.

1146
00:52:56,321 --> 00:52:58,700
It takes forever to get 27 episodes of 
Aqap show done just so they can be like,

1147
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,970
I work in the movies.
It's crazy.

1148
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,580
It's for folks that work on,
on sets,

1149
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,410
it's like,
um,

1150
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,470
there was a show that I did this hunting
show that I do and when you want to talk

1151
00:53:09,471 --> 00:53:11,660
about people that work hard to just show
meat eater.

1152
00:53:11,661 --> 00:53:16,661
And this dude who hosted,
his name is Steven Rinella and he's got 

1153
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:16,661
these guys that work for them 
specifically.

1154
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:21,401
This guy,
Dan Toady and moe's the director and 

1155
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:24,440
these fucking guys are working 16 hours 
a day on top of a mountain somewhere,

1156
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:30,050
freezing their asses off in a fucking 
tent and this is what they do every 

1157
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,981
week.
Every week they're flying a fucking 

1158
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:36,110
Mexico to hunt a buffalo or flying to 
the Swiss Alps to kill some crazy sheep 

1159
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:37,100
or something like that.
Right?

1160
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:40,320
They got to kill animals and Itam on top
of all these hours.

1161
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,520
Well,
they don't have to do that.

1162
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:46,521
They don't sometimes.
Like sometimes they don't get an animal 

1163
00:53:46,521 --> 00:53:48,951
at all really,
but the thing is like these guys that 

1164
00:53:48,951 --> 00:53:48,951
are working behind the scenes,
like the cameraman,

1165
00:53:48,951 --> 00:53:53,600
stuff like that.
The guys were carrying shit like what a 

1166
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,320
fucking hard,
you know,

1167
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,260
to be expected to work like that.
Like wow,

1168
00:53:58,261 --> 00:54:03,261
you've got to find some special fucking 
people that are willing to work like 

1169
00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:03,261
that.
Camping,

1170
00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:05,430
we're going to go,
I don't get to stop work at this.

1171
00:54:05,431 --> 00:54:06,240
No.
Stop work.

1172
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,840
When you're working,
you fucking work while you're there.

1173
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,730
When you're not working,
you're sleeping.

1174
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:15,150
You get up and everybody works again.
No insomnia and production life.

1175
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,620
No,
you're not allowed to,

1176
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:21,710
and they knock out the 40 hour work week
in about two and a half day in the 

1177
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:24,930
adderall flows like hail falls from the 
sky.

1178
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:27,960
Just pick it up and stuffed it into 
their mouth.

1179
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,070
A lot of that.
No,

1180
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:30,140
I don't know.
Just guessing.

1181
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:35,360
I would say that if you were working on 
a set of like a show that was working 

1182
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,381
like crazy hours all the time,
you probably need at least a strong 

1183
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:39,750
energy drink.
Habit,

1184
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,700
coffee.
Don't cut it at that point.

1185
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,440
Coffee.
Don't cut it.

1186
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:46,200
Especially if you're not working on 
something for you.

1187
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,460
All right?
If you're working on the mat,

1188
00:54:47,461 --> 00:54:49,020
fold tron experience,
Kaboom,

1189
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:50,280
and you've got an energy.
You know what I'm saying?

1190
00:54:50,281 --> 00:54:52,770
Like you have a chart and you're.
You're plotting your future.

1191
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:54,910
Take over.
You know what I'm saying?

1192
00:54:54,911 --> 00:54:56,310
I know half George.
You just,

1193
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:01,360
you're figuring out how you're going to 
set up these one man shows around the 

1194
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,081
country who keep your comedy in a time 
capsule and they have all these people 

1195
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:07,770
become the half charges.
You're going to be fine,

1196
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,920
right?
But if you're working on like that 70 

1197
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,230
[inaudible] show or something like that,
how sad example,

1198
00:55:14,231 --> 00:55:17,850
but you know something,
some ridiculous show,

1199
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,850
some show where you don't give a fuck 
about the outcome,

1200
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:26,290
not just a job and you're there all day 
and you're there all day and you get to 

1201
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:31,011
see whiny actors throw hissy fits and 
throw fucking scripts around to see the 

1202
00:55:31,011 --> 00:55:33,600
weirdness between the crew and the 
actors and Oh,

1203
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:38,680
fucking shit.

1204
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,460
The amount of time invested put in all 
that.

1205
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,640
I know it's crazy because a regular 
person has a regular job.

1206
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:51,540
Like you work nine,
you've done five.

1207
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:56,570
Maybe you have some extra things you 
have to tie up before you leave the 

1208
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:56,570
office.
Right?

1209
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,590
The office by six and like that's very.
That's a lot of time.

1210
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:03,650
And let's be honest,
there's some youtube and in there 

1211
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:06,350
there's some office gods has been there.
That's all your fucking employee really 

1212
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:10,161
deserves.
Your employer rather employer doesn't 

1213
00:56:10,161 --> 00:56:11,670
deserve your 100 percent of your time 
here because it's your life.

1214
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:15,240
That shit's ridiculous to have a job 
that sucks.

1215
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:18,390
You drive for 16 hours a day.
It's almost,

1216
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,630
it's almost like you,
it's obviously,

1217
00:56:21,631 --> 00:56:24,420
I believe that people should have the 
free to do whatever the fuck they want.

1218
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:27,360
They want to pursue that sort of alive.
But if you,

1219
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,400
if it's not something you enjoy doing,
that's a really dangerous place to put 

1220
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,060
your brain,
right?

1221
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,360
The fact that,
okay,

1222
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:39,361
this is what we do.
We do stuff that sucks for 16 hours a 

1223
00:56:39,361 --> 00:56:40,330
day where you hate it and then you get 
to be free.

1224
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,980
Some people don't want a life or don't 
want their own thoughts though.

1225
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,380
Is that what it is?
Some people like to keep themselves busy

1226
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,480
and there's a little bit of that in 
standup comedy.

1227
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:51,610
It's like,
I don't want to do Valentine's Day.

1228
00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:53,050
I got to work that night,
honey.

1229
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:53,560
Well,
I see,

1230
00:56:53,561 --> 00:56:56,960
I understand what it is as far as like 
the production budgets and um,

1231
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,600
you know,
getting things done.

1232
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:01,390
And if days take longer,
takes more time,

1233
00:57:01,391 --> 00:57:06,391
cost more money.
And so in order to fit things under 

1234
00:57:06,391 --> 00:57:07,240
budget or in their budget,
they have to work these long hours,

1235
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:12,300
you know,
that's just what they do and that 

1236
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:12,300
there's,
if they don't get a 12 hour turnaround,

1237
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,961
like they have to pay penalties and they
pay meal penalties and all these union 

1238
00:57:15,961 --> 00:57:16,570
penalties that they have to pay if they.

1239
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,720
But at the end of the day it's like,
why is everybody choosing to work so 

1240
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,200
crazy?
Like I don't know.

1241
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,960
At the end of the day I understand you 
save a little money this way.

1242
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:28,390
I get it.
Is there another way?

1243
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,120
There is another way it's called.
It's shorter hours.

1244
00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:32,670
Woody Allen does it.
Does he?

1245
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,960
Television does it a lot of times.
Fuck yeah,

1246
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:36,170
they sit.
Does sitcoms do it?

1247
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:41,220
Yeah.
By the time news radio is in its fifth 

1248
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:41,220
season,
we only worked three days a week.

1249
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:41,220
Nice.
Yeah.

1250
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:46,021
Some we had done two days a week.
We had done one day when we got the 

1251
00:57:46,021 --> 00:57:46,810
script and as we were going over the 
script,

1252
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:51,811
we have block and and like mark where 
the scenes are going to take place and 

1253
00:57:51,811 --> 00:57:53,380
that's what we'd rehearse it,
go over it,

1254
00:57:53,381 --> 00:57:55,300
do one run through and then film with 
the next day.

1255
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,190
Did you,
do you really enjoy doing that show?

1256
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:02,730
I really enjoyed doing that show,
but I don't think I would really enjoy 

1257
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:03,400
doing another show.
Gotcha.

1258
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,110
Unless it was like that.
Right.

1259
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:10,130
You know,
like that was a really weird show 

1260
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,540
because that show was.
I don't know how it is on most sitcoms 

1261
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:16,561
because I've only.
The only other one I've done is just 

1262
00:58:16,561 --> 00:58:16,561
shoot me.
I did one episode of that.

1263
00:58:16,561 --> 00:58:17,940
I did one episode of Mad TV.
I did.

1264
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I didn't really do much other than that,
but when I was on news radio and they 

1265
00:58:23,141 --> 00:58:26,380
let us ad Lib like almost every scene.
That's awesome.

1266
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:29,710
Like almost every scene there was 
something that was changed,

1267
00:58:29,711 --> 00:58:33,120
something that was altered,
something that was someone,

1268
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:38,170
one of us came up with on the fly and 
most of the time orchestrated by Dave 

1269
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,380
Foley.
Like Day Foley would take the script and

1270
00:58:41,381 --> 00:58:43,330
then he was,
he was sort of,

1271
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,850
it was an ensemble show,
but if anybody was the lead,

1272
00:58:45,851 --> 00:58:50,470
it was day four and it was Phil Hartman 
who was the big star and then,

1273
00:58:50,471 --> 00:58:51,610
you know,
Dave Foley was,

1274
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,510
you know,
kind of like,

1275
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,720
I always felt like he was like a,
like an uncredited producer really.

1276
00:58:55,750 --> 00:59:00,750
Right.
And he would orchestrate like a lot of 

1277
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:00,750
the scenes and come up with fantastic 
lines for them to.

1278
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:05,470
He's a really fucking talented guy.
And then all the guys that I think don't

1279
00:59:05,471 --> 00:59:09,400
get appreciated enough for being fucking
unbelievably hilarious.

1280
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:12,700
One of them is Dave Foley.
He's such a sweetheart of a guy,

1281
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:16,030
like always has been.
Always been like the nicest,

1282
00:59:16,031 --> 00:59:18,820
kindest guy and really,
really,

1283
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:23,821
really fucking smart.
Really fucking smart and really fucking 

1284
00:59:23,821 --> 00:59:27,461
funny to such a cool dude.
Always was now.

1285
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:32,530
And I'm and,
and I think he's doing standup now to 

1286
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:32,530
really.
Yeah.

1287
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:33,500
That's not his background,
right?

1288
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:35,770
He's more of an Improv guys.
He was a,

1289
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,340
he was one of the guys from kids in the 
hall.

1290
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:38,180
Yeah,
I know that much.

1291
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:39,470
Yeah.
You've watched kids in the hall?

1292
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:44,530
Yeah,
but after the fact I watched it like 

1293
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:44,530
after it was,
you know,

1294
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:44,530
reruns.

1295
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:44,530
So good.
Yeah.

1296
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:46,450
It's such a fucking good stuff.
Yeah.

1297
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,670
So good.
What was that on originally?

1298
00:59:49,671 --> 00:59:51,230
Canadian television.
What was that on?

1299
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,940
What?
Like kids in the hall?

1300
00:59:52,941 --> 00:59:54,920
Where did it originally aired?
That's a good question.

1301
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:56,390
I think it was Canadian.
Yeah,

1302
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:58,880
I think it was Canadian TV.
Yeah.

1303
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:03,881
And then we found out about it in 
America and then those kinds of came 

1304
01:00:03,881 --> 01:00:03,881
down here.
But,

1305
01:00:03,881 --> 01:00:05,780
um,
I don't remember my original point.

1306
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,890
I just got product caught up in this 
Dahlia production.

1307
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:14,950
It's insane.
When you were asking me that was where 

1308
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:14,960
it was,
you were asking me whether or not,

1309
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:15,960
uh,
I enjoyed doing it.

1310
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:20,970
I said I enjoyed doing it,
but the way it was done was so wild and 

1311
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:21,860
crazy.
Almost after every filming everybody was

1312
01:00:21,861 --> 01:00:26,861
getting hammered more drunken moment 
talks with like Maura Tierney and day 

1313
01:00:27,751 --> 01:00:29,750
fall within any other humans in my whole
life.

1314
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,930
That's these like crate and especially 
for me back then like,

1315
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:34,520
oh,
it's such an emotional mess.

1316
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:35,320
Really.
Yeah.

1317
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:36,110
Because I was,
you know,

1318
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:38,350
my late twenties,
I had just gotten into,

1319
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,640
stand up,
just got done fighting,

1320
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:45,641
just gotten into stand up and then moved
out to la and I didn't know what the 

1321
01:00:45,641 --> 01:00:48,881
fuck I was doing.
I didn't believe I was on TV two years 

1322
01:00:48,881 --> 01:00:49,010
ago.
I was broke as fuck,

1323
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:54,240
right.
Barely getting by as a comic and then 

1324
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,561
all of a sudden I'm sitting here with 
Dave fucking Foley and Phil Hartman and 

1325
01:00:56,561 --> 01:00:57,110
we're going over the lines of the show 
we're on.

1326
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,900
I'm like,
I didn't make any sense.

1327
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,920
So you had trouble accepting that or it 
was just like weird.

1328
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,800
It's just weird.
So crazy.

1329
01:01:05,801 --> 01:01:06,460
And so,
you know,

1330
01:01:06,461 --> 01:01:10,580
we had these wild drunken fucking 
parties after the,

1331
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,570
after the shows for time,
like they were crazy.

1332
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:17,590
They were very punk rock.
Dave Foley like really embraced some 

1333
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,460
sort of a punk ideology for the whole 
thing.

1334
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:22,460
And the producers,
like,

1335
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,740
especially Paul Simms who was the guy 
who created it,

1336
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:25,760
wrote it,
the head writer,

1337
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:30,080
and he would just let the funniest stuff
go through.

1338
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,760
Like he just wanted it to be the 
funniest.

1339
01:01:31,761 --> 01:01:36,761
So he wrote,
he wrote really funny shit and really 

1340
01:01:36,761 --> 01:01:36,890
creative shit and they would let you 
know,

1341
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:40,930
Phil Hartman ad Lib or Andy Dick and 
Andy Dick ad libbed a lot of shit.

1342
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:46,870
Yeah.
He would just take something and just 

1343
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:46,870
run with it,
you know,

1344
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:50,290
figure out a better way to do it.
And everybody was always tweaking their 

1345
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,291
lines.
They're always trying to figure out 

1346
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:53,291
like,
what is this?

1347
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:53,291
Is it this or is it just a.
Oh yeah,

1348
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:54,080
that one,
that one,

1349
01:01:54,081 --> 01:01:56,030
you know,
we would help each other like that.

1350
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:57,710
I think that's,
I don't really know,

1351
01:01:57,711 --> 01:01:59,720
but I kinda think that's a huge vote.
Paul.

1352
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:02,560
And a lot of sitcoms.
You respect the writers.

1353
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:04,450
Is this flubs?
Yeah,

1354
01:02:04,451 --> 01:02:08,740
Ben's a bloopers.
I made to take a piss.

1355
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:16,580
It's unbelievable.
I can't believe that.

1356
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:17,460
I don't know this.

1357
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,420
Uh,
so great.

1358
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:27,610
It was awesome.
I think it will be called free.

1359
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:32,611
Willie's billy free.
Billy's Willie Bell.

1360
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,880
That's so crazy.
I remember that flub count for freaks.

1361
01:02:58,590 --> 01:02:59,240
Yeah,

1362
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:05,970
it's funny.
Fun Times,

1363
01:03:05,971 --> 01:03:07,090
man.
Yeah.

1364
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:11,460
But what he was talking about was,
or what are the.

1365
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:15,330
The question was whether I would do 
something like that again,

1366
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,780
like you'd never find a show like that.
They're probably never going to make one

1367
01:03:18,781 --> 01:03:20,850
like that again.
That show went under the radar.

1368
01:03:20,851 --> 01:03:23,480
It was like while it was on,
it was a,

1369
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:28,520
it was so like ignored that it was sort 
of allowed to be what it became because 

1370
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:33,210
they fucked with it a little bit.
Like I know they brought in like a 

1371
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,140
couple of romantic characters and they 
brought a woman into the office once.

1372
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:39,330
You're not Lauren Graham,
the woman from the Gilmore girls 

1373
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:39,330
Saturday.
Lauren Graham?

1374
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:40,160
I think so.
We'll find.

1375
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,400
Is that her name?
She's so hot.

1376
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,640
She's really cool.
She was on news radio for a season.

1377
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:47,170
Yeah.
So was um,

1378
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:52,430
Patrick Warburton.
The guy when you go to a soaring over 

1379
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:52,430
California,
is that it?

1380
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:57,110
Lauren Green Long Graham.
She's really fucking funny and really 

1381
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:57,110
cool.
Like,

1382
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:57,660
you know,
a lot of actresses.

1383
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:59,220
They're like,
when you're talking to them,

1384
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:03,000
you're talking to your representative.
Do you ever try?

1385
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,580
No.
That we worked together.

1386
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:08,580
She's a very cool though.
Very nice person.

1387
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:10,230
She was fun to hang with.
Like,

1388
01:04:10,231 --> 01:04:11,160
she's like,
she,

1389
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,500
she could joke around,
she was lively,

1390
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:16,830
they brought her in,
but other than that they didn't really,

1391
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:18,060
um,
didn't really fuck with it,

1392
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:23,380
you know,
they kind of let Paul to his thing and 

1393
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:23,380
that's why it was so weird.
I just,

1394
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,750
unless he get a show like that.
No,

1395
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,850
because once you do a show like that,
you realize like,

1396
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,880
that's like I went from a show before 
that we did a show on Fox called 

1397
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,130
hardball and hardball.
Was this like really bad show baseball?

1398
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:37,080
It was terrible.
Fucking terrible.

1399
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,720
And there was a mascot that was a big 
baseball.

1400
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:44,120
Yeah.
And the show was awesome and got 

1401
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:44,120
destroyed.
Okay.

1402
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:48,630
Guys who wrote it?
Jeff Martin and Kevin currently believe 

1403
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:49,170
they,
um,

1404
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:51,720
they were for writers from married with 
children.

1405
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,300
There were writings from the sentence,
really funny guys.

1406
01:04:54,301 --> 01:04:59,301
They were really good and they put 
together this fucking bad ass script and

1407
01:04:59,611 --> 01:05:02,850
the pilot was like really well written.
It was really good stuff.

1408
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,500
And then as soon as the show got picked 
up,

1409
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:09,790
these guys were kind of like,
they were a soft spoken to really 

1410
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:10,740
friendly,
really nice guys.

1411
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:15,741
And just kind of soft spoken and the 
network didn't think that they were 

1412
01:05:15,741 --> 01:05:18,190
strong enough to run a show like they 
thought you needed to be strong.

1413
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,400
So they booted these guys out and it 
brought in this super duper hacker,

1414
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:23,380
richest dude.
I mean,

1415
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,850
he was a hacker [inaudible].
It was terrible.

1416
01:05:25,851 --> 01:05:29,320
Like every terrible cliche in a scene.

1417
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:33,610
This guy would insert in there.
His writing was just insanely bad.

1418
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:36,670
He was from that show,
coach member I've ever coached.

1419
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:41,900
Well he had come from the air somehow or
another and he had gotten on this show 

1420
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:45,510
and I watched the show get destroyed.
And so going from that to seeing the 

1421
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:47,650
news radio way,
which is a weird thing where no one ever

1422
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:52,651
got famous from the show.
The show was always almost going to get 

1423
01:05:52,651 --> 01:05:55,381
canceled and limped into five years and 
didn't even get to 100 episodes.

1424
01:05:56,321 --> 01:06:00,400
We were two episodes shy,
which is like almost for the show,

1425
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:02,350
like prophetic,
you know,

1426
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:03,640
that's,
that's what we are,

1427
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,130
which is bad.
But because of that,

1428
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:08,370
because the no pressure,
no start,

1429
01:06:08,371 --> 01:06:09,880
um,
no craziness.

1430
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,260
No,
not too much.

1431
01:06:11,261 --> 01:06:12,790
Network interference.
Brilliant.

1432
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:17,791
Producer.
It became this weird environment where 

1433
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:17,791
there's all this ad libbing and all 
this,

1434
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:19,510
you know,
rechanging of things in very dynamic and

1435
01:06:19,511 --> 01:06:22,900
really funny stuff that you're proud to 
tell someone that you worked on.

1436
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:24,850
Right.
So once you've done that,

1437
01:06:24,851 --> 01:06:28,240
it's really hard to do a shitty one like
the hardball when again.

1438
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:33,400
Right.
And most likely that's where you're 

1439
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:33,400
going to run into this.
It's hard to do.

1440
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,540
It's fucking silent movies,
man.

1441
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:40,070
That's what it is.
You gotta you gotta fake laughs and 

1442
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:41,530
there's a silent movies.
It's hard to keep that art form alive,

1443
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:43,750
you know.
And so you guys were riffing in front of

1444
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:45,100
the audience while the cameras are 
rolling.

1445
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:45,870
Oh yeah.
All the time.

1446
01:06:45,871 --> 01:06:47,560
It's so awesome.
We'd written in front of the cameras.

1447
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:51,790
Dave would oftentimes change a line,
like on the fly,

1448
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:57,120
like come up with something that was 
funnier because his background had been 

1449
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:57,120
live performing.
Right?

1450
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,680
So he knew how to come up with stuff on 
the fly.

1451
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:02,890
Is that hardball?
Oh God.

1452
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:05,980
I remember when this is on,
it was only on for like six episodes.

1453
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,160
I think we did seven,
but only six of them ever made it to the

1454
01:07:09,161 --> 01:07:11,050
air.
It's just they just.

1455
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:16,100
It just got butchered,
but that's what happens a lot of the 

1456
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,390
time because in the business of TV,
what people were trying to do is make a 

1457
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:19,420
shitload of money and these producer 
guys,

1458
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:22,180
they're there,
they want to control everything and they

1459
01:07:22,181 --> 01:07:24,490
want to make a shitload of money and if 
they are allowed to,

1460
01:07:24,491 --> 01:07:26,020
if they get into a situation where they 
do it,

1461
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,980
you can't be surprised that they do and 
they don't know that their ideas suck.

1462
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,440
They think they're awesome,
which is why they have the job.

1463
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:37,530
So they push forward thinking that these
awesome ideas that aren't so awesome 

1464
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:39,010
actually are going to change this show 
for the better.

1465
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,160
Like they're not trying to fuck it up,
but he fucked it up.

1466
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,480
When you see stuff like that,
you're like,

1467
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:44,860
I don't.

1468
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,780
There's too many people.
I'll just do podcasts.

1469
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:52,430
Yeah,
exactly how many people you've got to 

1470
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:52,430
deal with.
So yeah.

1471
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:55,310
Whoops.
I heard Seinfeld talking about how like 

1472
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:55,310
that was one of the only shows where 
they were like,

1473
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:56,260
no we don't.
I think it was Larry.

1474
01:07:56,261 --> 01:08:01,261
David was like,
no outside influences and he was always 

1475
01:08:01,261 --> 01:08:04,291
willing to walk before he was even 
anybody before he even had any money in 

1476
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:04,291
the bank.
Well,

1477
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:06,520
I don't know how true that is,
but I bet it's true.

1478
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:10,660
Then they initially like shows always 
get fucked with in the beginning.

1479
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:15,900
I mean unless you bring in like unless 
it's Martin Scorsese and speed Steven 

1480
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,430
Spielberg team up together for some new 
miniseries.

1481
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,650
I'm pretty sure that network is going to
shut the fuck up on that.

1482
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:23,240
Right.
But until that happens,

1483
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:25,370
they have some say and they,
they want to,

1484
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,830
they want to throw their own special 
spice into the zoo.

1485
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:31,040
I like coriander.
Can we put coriander in this suit?

1486
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:32,950
Yes.
You fuck with your coriander?

1487
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,230
I'd throw it in there.
We're watching your soup get ruined.

1488
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,270
Right?
There's,

1489
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:38,460
you know,
it's a business.

1490
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,700
A lot of people involved.
It's just like anything else.

1491
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:44,600
It's just like the design of a car or 
the box that the corn flakes come in.

1492
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:49,900
A lot of people have their say,
a lot of people have opinions and 

1493
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:49,900
there's,
you know,

1494
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:50,700
there's a lot of weird desk going on and
you wouldn't,

1495
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:55,830
you know,
as well as I do that when you're trying 

1496
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:58,301
to create something,
especially if you try and create 

1497
01:08:58,301 --> 01:08:59,480
something funny,
the less shit you have coming in,

1498
01:08:59,481 --> 01:09:04,481
the better when it comes to like,
like outside of the creative sphere,

1499
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:05,970
you know,
the less people.

1500
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:11,080
Once you get down to a core group of 
very competent individuals like writers 

1501
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:15,731
and artists are sitting together and 
trying to compile the correct way to do 

1502
01:09:15,731 --> 01:09:17,030
something and they're working on it very
hard if they're a functional group,

1503
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,920
that should be where that ends.

1504
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:19,810
Right.
Okay.

1505
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:23,210
When producers come in and they,
all of a sudden they have line reads and

1506
01:09:23,211 --> 01:09:23,630
they're like,
well,

1507
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:25,550
why doesn't he just like,
Oh,

1508
01:09:25,551 --> 01:09:29,120
fucking Christ.
Why did you hire writers?

1509
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:34,121
Dude,
why don't you just do everything right 

1510
01:09:34,121 --> 01:09:34,850
when she's here.
Once you write a script that happens all

1511
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:37,190
the time to.
They'll tell a producer once you write a

1512
01:09:37,191 --> 01:09:42,191
script,
and a lot of producers think that Ken 

1513
01:09:42,191 --> 01:09:42,191
writes scripts,
right?

1514
01:09:42,191 --> 01:09:42,191
So they'll go and they'll write scripts 
and then those writers,

1515
01:09:42,191 --> 01:09:44,660
we'll pass it around amongst their 
friends and fucking giggle.

1516
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:46,190
Bad.
It sucks.

1517
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:51,520
Right?
I had that on a really small level when 

1518
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,461
I first started doing stand up,
I got this management group and they're 

1519
01:09:54,461 --> 01:09:56,800
like,
we're gonna try to base a sitcom around 

1520
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,920
the fucking five minutes that you 
actually have and every month.

1521
01:09:57,921 --> 01:10:00,920
And it wasn't just me,
it was a bunch of guys that they managed

1522
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:06,250
every month they would have these shows 
where they would go to and then they 

1523
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:09,590
would give us suggestions on how to 
write sets that would inspire sitcoms.

1524
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:14,950
Wow.
And I actually got pretty far down the 

1525
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:17,951
pike with it.
I had like castle rock and we were 

1526
01:10:17,951 --> 01:10:17,951
pitching and everything.
There was this,

1527
01:10:17,951 --> 01:10:19,610
this was 2002,
2002.

1528
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:20,900
Yeah.
Wow.

1529
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:23,780
There was still doing a lot of sitcoms 
back then.

1530
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:28,810
There's still the development deal game 
back then because that was the first 

1531
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:29,900
year of fear factor.
So that was when reality shows were just

1532
01:10:29,901 --> 01:10:34,901
starting to take off.
A survivor was first and then was a 

1533
01:10:34,901 --> 01:10:35,150
couple of other ones and then there was 
a,

1534
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:40,200
you know,
NBC had fear factor and a couple of 

1535
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,040
other ones and then it was just reality 
shows like Jon and Kate plus eight and 

1536
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,940
all these other motherfuckers just 
spewed onto the scene.

1537
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,900
And then there was the influx of reality
shows over the last decade.

1538
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,760
It's pretty crazy.
It's unbelievable.

1539
01:10:49,761 --> 01:10:52,580
Two thousand two that wasn't really 
going on as much as a lot of sitcoms.

1540
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:54,540
Yeah.
Where's that sweet,

1541
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:59,541
sweet sitcom in the aftermath.
Full trump didn't happen.

1542
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:04,220
I smell a smell.
That sweet,

1543
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:06,020
sweet sitcom money.
Everybody wants that.

1544
01:11:06,021 --> 01:11:06,380
Sweet.
Sweet.

1545
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:08,060
I know,
I know.

1546
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:10,980
It's not even a game anymore in a way.
It's not really game.

1547
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
People go,
wow,

1548
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,050
here we go.
Where's

1549
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:17,910
I'm 25 years old and then picture and I 
like your little.

1550
01:11:17,911 --> 01:11:20,300
You got a little beads on,
you have one of these things on.

1551
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:21,810
It was a,
it was a,

1552
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:26,811
um,
a stainless or a sterling silver 

1553
01:11:26,811 --> 01:11:27,360
bracelet.
Where'd you find that picture?

1554
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:30,200
A hardball website.
Isn't Jim?

1555
01:11:30,201 --> 01:11:33,930
Is Jim backup and see if Jim Burrows in 
there and Jim Brewer was in the pilot.

1556
01:11:33,931 --> 01:11:35,300
He played the baseball,
the pilot.

1557
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:37,800
They really played the,
uh,

1558
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:41,310
he played the original mascot that got 
beat up by the baseball.

1559
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,350
He played,
uh,

1560
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,630
the Pied Piper because I think we used 
to be the pied pipers.

1561
01:11:45,631 --> 01:11:47,160
Then we became the pirates or something 
like that.

1562
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:50,550
Right.
Or we can whatever the fuck we became,

1563
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,590
I forget what the name of the actual 
team was,

1564
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:58,220
but a brewer.
The funniest part of the pilot was 

1565
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:00,720
brewer brewer dancing around and getting
in a fight with this fucking baseball.

1566
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,460
Wow.
That's so crazy.

1567
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,680
That's an evil looking baseball right 
there

1568
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:07,500
is this guy right here.

1569
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:09,840
Think garland right there.
I'm like,

1570
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:10,890
no,
it's Mike Star.

1571
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:14,280
Mike Star was in the bodyguard.
He was in Goodfellas.

1572
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,050
Right.
It's been a lot of movies.

1573
01:12:16,051 --> 01:12:19,740
I guarantee you macro recognize if you 
saw him.

1574
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,230
Super Cool Guy,
man.

1575
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:27,840
That's The star track dad right there.
Captain Kirk's dad to the far left.

1576
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,240
Bruce Greenwood.
He was on the show too.

1577
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:33,670
And that's that.
Do this on that.

1578
01:12:33,671 --> 01:12:35,560
A kid's show,
you know,

1579
01:12:35,561 --> 01:12:39,070
that kid show kitchen,
one of those really popular kid shows.

1580
01:12:39,071 --> 01:12:40,930
He plays like he's got a character on.
I,

1581
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,000
I catch them on like nickelodeon and all
the time.

1582
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:46,390
And there's Derek jeter that due to the 
far right.

1583
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:50,680
Forgot his fucking name man.
He was a cool guy too though.

1584
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:53,500
God dammit.
I can't remember his name.

1585
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:58,860
But uh,
that was the dude that got hit in the 

1586
01:12:58,860 --> 01:12:58,860
teeth with a pipe in,
in Russia.

1587
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:01,090
I will tell you that story.
Yeah.

1588
01:13:01,091 --> 01:13:03,560
A buddy of mine,
that guy was there,

1589
01:13:03,561 --> 01:13:08,561
uh,
doing some movie and he turned the 

1590
01:13:08,561 --> 01:13:08,561
corner and some guys smashed him in the 
face of pipe,

1591
01:13:08,561 --> 01:13:09,760
knocked him out cold.
His teeth were shattered.

1592
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:12,820
Oh yeah.
He told me matter of faculty to.

1593
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:15,460
He's a tough fucking dude.
So how was Russia?

1594
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:16,270
He goes,
well,

1595
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:18,370
you see these teeth?
Yeah,

1596
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:21,250
I got them because I was in Russia.
I go,

1597
01:13:21,251 --> 01:13:26,251
what happened?
This man turned a corner at some dude 

1598
01:13:26,251 --> 01:13:26,251
smash me in the fucking jaw with a pipe,
broke my teeth out.

1599
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:30,680
That was it.
No complaining and whining.

1600
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:32,670
And I was like,
you know,

1601
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,520
I mean,
slick.

1602
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:36,350
No,
everywhere I go,

1603
01:13:36,351 --> 01:13:41,351
I worried someone's gonna hit me.
He barely gave a fuck that this guy hit 

1604
01:13:41,351 --> 01:13:42,000
him in the face of the pipe and not to 
have his teeth.

1605
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,780
His teeth look better.
Now I'm telling you,

1606
01:13:44,781 --> 01:13:46,860
this dude barely gave a fuck.
It was a,

1607
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:49,790
it was a tough dude.
I don't know what he ever went on to do,

1608
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:54,170
but I do know is a really strange thing.
I saw he got something,

1609
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:58,220
some sort of a uh,
like a new show or something like that.

1610
01:13:58,221 --> 01:13:59,130
Some,
he got like a,

1611
01:13:59,131 --> 01:14:01,400
a part in something that he was really 
excited about.

1612
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:05,630
And his girlfriend at the time who was 
also an actress,

1613
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:11,140
started openly crying when he received 
the good news and

1614
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:17,190
she kept saying like,
when is something going to happen for 

1615
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:17,190
me?
Oh,

1616
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:18,370
when is something going to happen for 
me?

1617
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:21,070
And she's crying men.
And I was like,

1618
01:14:21,071 --> 01:14:22,310
wow,
this port I've,

1619
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:25,360
I felt bad for her brain works that way.
I was like,

1620
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:26,510
this poor kid,
like,

1621
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:31,830
look at this crazy brain pattern.
She's on weird self-absorbed brain 

1622
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:34,660
pattern,
but that's the Hollywood way,

1623
01:14:34,661 --> 01:14:36,640
man.
That's definitely the acting way.

1624
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:37,590
I mean,
Christ,

1625
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,180
a lot of it,
it's a lot of lottery plan.

1626
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,220
I mean a lot of them aren't that with 
the problem is the,

1627
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:48,320
even the best.
Not that much better than some guy 

1628
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:48,320
that's doing community theater in 
Oakland,

1629
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,540
you know,
it's probably some bad motherfucker that

1630
01:14:51,541 --> 01:14:54,820
can't keep his shit together.
Smokes a little bit too much.

1631
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:59,821
Drinks a little bit too much.
But when he gets his shit together and 

1632
01:14:59,821 --> 01:14:59,821
gets,
you know,

1633
01:14:59,821 --> 01:15:00,700
gets a hold of a script,
he could probably fuck it up.

1634
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:05,750
Right.
But he's just never been gotten the 

1635
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,951
right acting fucking agent or agency or 
parts or they always a part of it goes 

1636
01:15:08,541 --> 01:15:10,990
to and Pharaoh when he gets close,
fuck it.

1637
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:14,740
But the difference between a guy who's 
really good and the difference between a

1638
01:15:14,741 --> 01:15:18,790
guy who's really famous as far as like 
what's valuable in a lot of ways,

1639
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:21,190
it's like how much better is the good 
guy?

1640
01:15:21,191 --> 01:15:26,191
Then the famous guy,
because you've got to be a lot better 

1641
01:15:26,191 --> 01:15:28,860
because if you're not a lot better,
I'm going to go with a famous guy 

1642
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:28,860
because people go to see if God Damn Tom
Cruise movie,

1643
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:30,490
you know,
so like they,

1644
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:32,740
they have a hard road.
Absolutely.

1645
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:34,710
Show.
Did you see his picture?

1646
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:38,070
So it's like all the guys sitting here 
and then you're like,

1647
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:44,220
had a fucking baseball bat that a woman 
is Rosemarie.

1648
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:48,190
She's from,
I think it was the Dick van dyke show or

1649
01:15:48,191 --> 01:15:48,910
something like that.

1650
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:52,300
Wow.
I think it was the Dick Van Dyke show,

1651
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:55,480
but I remember I was embarrassed that I 
didn't know.

1652
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,970
Um,
yeah,

1653
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:59,860
I think I never seen the Dick van dyke 
show.

1654
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:05,190
It's weird.
I've never seen the Mary Tyler Moore 

1655
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:05,190
show.
Well that's not as weird.

1656
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:07,210
The Dick Van Dyke show is weird because 
Mary Tyler Moore is really young.

1657
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:09,100
They're A.
Yeah,

1658
01:16:09,101 --> 01:16:11,650
she was on the Dick Van Dyke show.
I never watched it.

1659
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:12,940
So when everybody's like,
that's Rosemarie,

1660
01:16:12,941 --> 01:16:14,500
like people on the set with like 
Rosemary.

1661
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:15,640
And I'm like,
oh,

1662
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:19,900
like what the fuck does that mean?
This is before wikipedia folks.

1663
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:23,110
No one knew anything back then.
God Damn.

1664
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:26,900
We were stupid in 1993.
Human beings were monkeys.

1665
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,770
We were monkeys with a o railroad 
system.

1666
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,330
Had a language and cars.
What you can do,

1667
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,930
go to the encyclopedia and look it up.
Yeah,

1668
01:16:34,931 --> 01:16:38,470
we're so much fucking smarter now,
but it was interesting because after I'd

1669
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,420
met her,
she was.

1670
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:44,580
She was getting on in age and she's 
still alive.

1671
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:46,960
She's born in Nineteen,
26,

1672
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:50,650
so to to be able to look back and see 
her.

1673
01:16:50,651 --> 01:16:54,310
After I met her then I watched the Dick 
Van Dyke show and I got to look back and

1674
01:16:54,311 --> 01:16:58,510
see her on what was like for a lot of 
people that were alive at the time.

1675
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:01,420
That was an iconic program and so I was 
like,

1676
01:17:01,421 --> 01:17:06,421
oh,
now I know why these older people that 

1677
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:07,180
were on the set were like freaked out 
that she was like,

1678
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:12,780
Jesus Christ would be weird to be on 
television if you were born and lived 

1679
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:14,800
before television was even invented 
often.

1680
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:19,820
Yeah,
I mean I know you looked it up before 

1681
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:19,820
and it was invented way back before it 
was common.

1682
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:23,540
Right.
But still it wasn't common until the 

1683
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:23,540
fifties.
Yeah.

1684
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:26,921
And people that they barely had enough 
money to buy one of those gigantic 

1685
01:17:26,921 --> 01:17:29,060
furniture things you would roll into 
your living room and occupy a good solid

1686
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,370
10 square feet of space.

1687
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:36,930
Um,
see if you could brian see if you could 

1688
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:38,321
find the Dick van dyke show,
like a highlight or clip of a show on,

1689
01:17:38,931 --> 01:17:39,890
um,
on,

1690
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:40,700
uh,
Youtube.

1691
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,040
Yeah,
she's a very nice lady though.

1692
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:45,500
She was very funny too.
She still does.

1693
01:17:45,501 --> 01:17:48,590
I'm sure she's still alive.
But um,

1694
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,460
like I said,
man,

1695
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,060
it ain't easy for everybody.
Shares a lot.

1696
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:58,090
A lot of people that don't get a shot.
The thing about acting that's kind of 

1697
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:02,140
fucked is a,
how many people out there would be 

1698
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:05,531
awesome at it if they apply themselves.
There's a lot of friends that we have 

1699
01:18:05,531 --> 01:18:06,830
that don't act at all.
But if they really decided to be bad ass

1700
01:18:06,831 --> 01:18:08,390
actors,
that would be incredible at it.

1701
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:09,710
Right.
And I think there's a lot of people that

1702
01:18:09,711 --> 01:18:14,711
work,
like a lot of regular jobs that they 

1703
01:18:14,711 --> 01:18:14,711
decided to apply themselves to it.

1704
01:18:14,711 --> 01:18:15,290
They could be awesome at actress,
but yeah,

1705
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:18,740
but the thing is like,
like getting,

1706
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:24,490
getting like discovered like the,
the sheer numbers of fucking people that

1707
01:18:25,311 --> 01:18:27,470
are coming here.
Like what do you think?

1708
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:32,590
Like if a role comes out for a movie,
like let's just say the full charge 

1709
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:32,710
writes a movie.
Yeah,

1710
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:37,860
for you.
I feel action sort of hand to hand 

1711
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:39,120
combat specialists.
Let's go with the mat fold.

1712
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,800
Try to Pakistan to fucking rectify some 
shit.

1713
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:46,280
Some shit.
Some people that are just,

1714
01:18:46,281 --> 01:18:51,281
they can't.
They don't know how to make a deal work 

1715
01:18:51,281 --> 01:18:51,320
smoothly and sometimes you got to knock 
a little and you've got to be able to do

1716
01:18:51,321 --> 01:18:53,240
both and that's what the full charges 
here for.

1717
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,700
I'm like Seagal.
It's like the movie tells you what I am.

1718
01:18:55,701 --> 01:18:56,180
Matt.
False.

1719
01:18:56,190 --> 01:19:01,190
Ron is the full charge and I just knock 
out terrorists and I fucking saved the 

1720
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:05,240
world constantly.
I see that being on Spike TV in the fall

1721
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,760
of 2016.
If we are our cards correctly,

1722
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:11,030
we gave them a little taste by talking 
about it here on the podcast.

1723
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,400
Let the pitch meetings begin.
Let's watch this.

1724
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:21,790
God Damn Mary Tyler Moore,
Mary Tyler Moore.

1725
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,840
Good craziness.
Death of the party.

1726
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:36,240
Just the way people pretended that 
people were back then is weird.

1727
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:42,560
Sleep in the same bed.
At least look at this.

1728
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:45,780
Yeah,
that is pretty sexy.

1729
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:46,620
No,
they don't man.

1730
01:19:46,621 --> 01:19:48,500
Look at the separation between the two 
beds.

1731
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:50,490
Right?
Oh my God.

1732
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:55,550
I'm so sad now.
She's so hot and she's right there and 

1733
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:56,870
he has to sleep in the next bed.
That is bullshit,

1734
01:19:56,910 --> 01:20:01,910
but doing it from behind was with a lot 
more popular back then because you had 

1735
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:03,450
that extra gap so yours is always 
probably just leaned over the bed.

1736
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:05,760
I don't think people really live like 
that,

1737
01:20:05,761 --> 01:20:07,060
dude.
No they didn't.

1738
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:07,830
It was TV,

1739
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,830
TV,
TV rules.

1740
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,660
They would never show.
They would see gives.

1741
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:14,460
If you have people sleep in the same 
band together,

1742
01:20:14,461 --> 01:20:19,461
you're implying that they're fucking.
Don't want to imply that this is 

1743
01:20:19,461 --> 01:20:19,950
wholesome.
Dick Van Dyke is father knows best.

1744
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,720
Just wants to play golf.
That's it.

1745
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:27,080
Yeah.
He's just trying to sneak out and play 

1746
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:27,080
some golf.
Ain't trying to fuck his wife.

1747
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:30,320
What he's doing right now is running 
from the prison warden who tells him 

1748
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:30,960
that he can't do what he wants to do 
with his life.

1749
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,730
Sushi master.
God,

1750
01:20:32,731 --> 01:20:33,990
she's so hot though.
They cute.

1751
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:35,140
Cute prison warden.
Look,

1752
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,570
she wakes up with her hair.
Perfect.

1753
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:41,370
Amazing.
She's got full war paint on and her hair

1754
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:42,120
is perfect.

1755
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:43,440
Look at that.

1756
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:46,060
This is so weird,
man.

1757
01:20:46,061 --> 01:20:48,130
Because this is like a time capsule.

1758
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:50,320
Oh boy.

1759
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:55,010
Curse word back then.
This shit hadn't been done before.

1760
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:56,890
We're watching some shit that like

1761
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:02,670
what happened to got the spark plugs.
I was so proud.

1762
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:07,910
I dressed by shape and AIPAC and got out
without waking you up and it was so 

1763
01:21:09,181 --> 01:21:11,060
brad,
you had to come back and tell him,

1764
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,360
Hey,
I forgot my keys and my money.

1765
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:21,570
I'm sorry.
Oh yeah.

1766
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,840
I'm sorry honey.
Look what?

1767
01:21:23,841 --> 01:21:27,200
She wears the bed.
I closed the door and when the money.

1768
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:30,410
Honey,
I'm sorry.

1769
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:34,160
Get over it.

1770
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,500
So you still mad at me from last night?
No,

1771
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:41,250
I'm not mad now and I wasn't mad last 
night.

1772
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:47,070
This would be a weird sort of a piece.
If someone decided to recreate this 

1773
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:49,360
show,
the exact sort of inflection,

1774
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:49,990
right?

1775
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:53,600
It's not,
I'm inconsiderate.

1776
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:56,450
I mean if I'm anything but I did 
consider a guilty.

1777
01:21:56,451 --> 01:22:01,451
I'm guilty of is talking to you right 
now where there are three guys waiting 

1778
01:22:01,451 --> 01:22:01,610
for me to tee off,
darling.

1779
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,430
Oh,
did you get it?

1780
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:05,550
I get it.

1781
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:06,880
You get that one,
get that.

1782
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:13,040
Can you imagine that?
At one point in time that was cutting 

1783
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:13,040
edge.
That was,

1784
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,020
I was like saying go fuck off.
It's really weird watching old shit like

1785
01:22:16,021 --> 01:22:17,310
that.
Did you see?

1786
01:22:17,311 --> 01:22:22,311
Uh,
I was listening to Opie and Anthony and 

1787
01:22:22,311 --> 01:22:22,311
they were talking about,
uh,

1788
01:22:22,311 --> 01:22:22,950
the house from the future that they used
to have,

1789
01:22:22,951 --> 01:22:25,620
whereas like in the future we're going 
to have and they,

1790
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:30,650
and they were showing them how much 
similarities of what they guessed the 

1791
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:32,530
house of the future was what show was it
on the,

1792
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:35,250
they had it,
it was back back in the day.

1793
01:22:35,251 --> 01:22:38,730
It used to be at epcot or it used to be 
at Disneyland.

1794
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:40,830
It used to be this building.
You walked in and was like,

1795
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,750
in that future,
this is what it tells.

1796
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:44,850
So it was a ride,
kind of.

1797
01:22:44,851 --> 01:22:46,440
It's like a standing right.
If I remember,

1798
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:47,910
I'll show you.
They have the video online,

1799
01:22:47,911 --> 01:22:49,890
but the guests,
things like,

1800
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:51,840
you know,
a microwave,

1801
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:54,120
microwave,
online shopping,

1802
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:55,250
they guessed.
Really?

1803
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,660
Yeah.
That's fascinating.

1804
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:58,750
Wow.
So,

1805
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:02,320
so is there anything in there that the,
that we don't have Brian?

1806
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:03,420
Uh,
yeah,

1807
01:23:03,421 --> 01:23:05,970
there,
there was a lot of spinning

1808
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:12,060
the wheels but in young Mr.
I can't think of an old charge 

1809
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:14,620
enterprises,
but I'm going to do is I'm going to go,

1810
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:17,950
I'm going to watch old shit with the 
predicted the future.

1811
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:22,630
Find out what happened and what didn't 
and then pick up the pieces.

1812
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:27,840
Is there a mailbox that blows you gail?
Cancel all my appointments.

1813
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:34,780
Yeah.
Here's the,

1814
01:23:34,781 --> 01:23:37,210
here's some photos from what it used to 
be.

1815
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:39,190
Oh Wow.
So what was this,

1816
01:23:39,191 --> 01:23:40,600
when was this created?
What year?

1817
01:23:40,710 --> 01:23:45,710
I believe it was the 19 five.
Nineteen 57 to 1967.

1818
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:50,380
And it was called,
believe it or not,

1819
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:55,260
the Monsanto House.
Monsanto.

1820
01:23:55,261 --> 01:23:59,870
You fucking devil.
And uh,

1821
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:02,690
that's hilarious.
How's the view?

1822
01:24:02,691 --> 01:24:04,300
Yeah,
but I,

1823
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:09,301
I remember going to,
I think it was at epcot when I went to 

1824
01:24:09,301 --> 01:24:09,301
it.
Wow.

1825
01:24:09,301 --> 01:24:10,550
And I'll find a video.
The video is actually,

1826
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:13,850
there's a house that was a.
I wonder if it's still up.

1827
01:24:13,851 --> 01:24:15,970
There was a house in the Hollywood hills
somewhere that I saw.

1828
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:21,040
Not In person ever,
but I've seen it in photos that looks 

1829
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:21,230
like a Ufo.
Have you ever seen?

1830
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,570
I've never seen that.
Now I'm gonna find it on Google,

1831
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:28,630
the flying saucer house.
James [inaudible] fired or Brian Flying

1832
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:30,690
saucer house.

1833
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:36,710
I think it's in Holland when,
but uh,

1834
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:41,770
it's so wicked.
It's a house though that once you lived 

1835
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:41,770
in it for a little while,
he'd be like,

1836
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:42,770
all right,
this is ridiculous.

1837
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,630
Look at it.
How dope is that?

1838
01:24:44,631 --> 01:24:44,960
Right.

1839
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:47,510
The encounter at lax,
that restaurant.

1840
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:51,140
But this is someone's fucking house,
man.

1841
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:51,950
Yeah,
no kidding.

1842
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:53,840
Someone's chilling in that house.
Okay.

1843
01:24:53,841 --> 01:24:54,710
I take it back.
That's,

1844
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:56,940
that's Uber Dope.
I would love to learn that.

1845
01:24:56,970 --> 01:24:59,940
It's like living in this space needle.
Look at this photo.

1846
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:05,630
Wow.
Let's try it to see if he can pull that 

1847
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:05,630
one up so that you stream people can see
it.

1848
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:09,380
This fucking house is radical.
You might even survive an earthquake or 

1849
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:12,831
an avalanche or something in that.
You would be worshiped by Star Trek and 

1850
01:25:12,901 --> 01:25:17,901
star wars geeks and where's this at 
Hollywood hills or somewhere in 

1851
01:25:17,901 --> 01:25:17,901
Hollywood.

1852
01:25:17,901 --> 01:25:22,760
I'm John Lottner by John Lautner.
He's the guy who created it.

1853
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,950
I'm wondering when this was built.
Oh,

1854
01:25:25,951 --> 01:25:28,530
okay.
It was a construction back in 1960,

1855
01:25:28,531 --> 01:25:31,590
but it was recently renovated.
Huh?

1856
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:37,040
God,
that's fucking wicked house is 

1857
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:37,860
incredible.
They're so cocky though,

1858
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:42,950
like local people do in California,
they take a hill in a place where the 

1859
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:47,090
ground moves all the fucking time and 
they just stick a big spike right down 

1860
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:51,090
the middle and put a circle on it.
Says they'll stay here.

1861
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,910
I can't believe no one lives in the 
death star or whatever.

1862
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:58,940
No one's recreated that they'll live in.
You just put out a fucking awesome 

1863
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:00,120
message into someone's gonna.
Run with that.

1864
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:02,910
Make sure you finish it guys.
You don't want to leave any weak spots.

1865
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,940
Now should.
He didn't make it full size,

1866
01:26:04,941 --> 01:26:08,540
full charge where they would have to to 
satisfy me starting in space.

1867
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:09,860
What are we doing?
I don't know.

1868
01:26:09,861 --> 01:26:14,750
That's for the nerds to figure out.
Get on at boys.

1869
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,310
Seriously though.
If you're a single guy.

1870
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:17,630
Full charge.
Yeah.

1871
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,950
No,
you are and you're looking to be sly and

1872
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:24,990
you look at it.
Really impressive Gal with where you 

1873
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:27,121
live in two dozen roses,
two dozen roses at the fucking the Ufo 

1874
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,050
House.
You bring her up to the Ufo House.

1875
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:32,900
This chick thinks you're balling.
I want you to look at a view my friend.

1876
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,880
Look at the fucking view from this 
place.

1877
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:38,540
That's what that shit.
That's so awesome.

1878
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:40,050
Come on.
That's so awesome.

1879
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:42,680
That view of Los Angeles at night is a 
really crazy view.

1880
01:26:42,681 --> 01:26:43,790
Have you ever seen that view,
Brian?

1881
01:26:43,791 --> 01:26:45,500
You ever been on top of Doheny?
Yeah.

1882
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:46,940
I would go up and down.
Look at that shit.

1883
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,430
It never disappoints.
Men who would look at that fucking view.

1884
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:53,390
That's insane.
That that is an incredible picture.

1885
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:58,510
This house is so weird because it's just
surrounded by glass because of is a Ufo 

1886
01:26:58,510 --> 01:26:59,450
theme.
Yeah.

1887
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:05,320
It's kind of amazing that there's not 
more of these like really weird freaky 

1888
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:10,061
houses in Hollywood.
You would think there would be a lot of 

1889
01:27:10,061 --> 01:27:10,061
like weird,
unusual.

1890
01:27:10,061 --> 01:27:15,010
I guess by the time you can afford a 
house you've kind like got rid of all 

1891
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:16,700
those crazy ideas about living in a 
fucking.

1892
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,260
Yeah,
I think so.

1893
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,200
And like if you do come up with a crazy 
plan for it.

1894
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:26,470
If you're an architect and you've got to
find somebody who's crazy enough to do 

1895
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:30,341
it,
but he also wants to find like the 

1896
01:27:30,341 --> 01:27:31,160
homeowner's association has to agree.
That's a big deal in California,

1897
01:27:31,161 --> 01:27:32,750
right?
They say no to a lot of stuff,

1898
01:27:32,751 --> 01:27:34,040
don't they?
It's a big deal everywhere.

1899
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:39,070
I was reading about this woman who's 
getting in trouble because she was a in 

1900
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:39,200
Florida,
in Miami.

1901
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:43,340
She's growing vegetables in her front 
lawn because that's the only part of her

1902
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:46,190
house that gets hit by son.
So she's grown her vegetables there.

1903
01:27:46,191 --> 01:27:49,610
She's been doing it for like 17 years 
and they trying to get her to stop,

1904
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:51,860
like,
like the city is coming in and telling a

1905
01:27:51,861 --> 01:27:54,260
lady stopped growing healthy food on her
property.

1906
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:56,470
It's fucking vegetables to have 
invested.

1907
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:59,060
Like someone's going to walk by.
They're going to be offended if they see

1908
01:27:59,061 --> 01:27:59,840
a tomato plant.

1909
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:04,930
Yeah.
Like what the fuck kind of craziness is 

1910
01:28:04,930 --> 01:28:07,511
that?
Why are you telling people they can't 

1911
01:28:07,511 --> 01:28:07,511
have food up?
What could grow?

1912
01:28:07,511 --> 01:28:07,511
Anything else?
Yes,

1913
01:28:07,511 --> 01:28:08,860
she can and she's allowed to grow 
flowers.

1914
01:28:08,861 --> 01:28:12,170
She grow fucking pine trees.
Probably thinks she wants.

1915
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:13,940
Can't grow marijuana.
Full charge.

1916
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,450
That shit's illegal,
dude.

1917
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:18,380
That shit is illegal.
Especially down in that country.

1918
01:28:18,381 --> 01:28:20,080
Known as Florida.
Oh,

1919
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:23,240
Florida.
Not America or California,

1920
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:26,660
right?
This guy made star Trek House.

1921
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:29,360
Whole entire house is just like the 
ship.

1922
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:31,160
Do you hear that?
That's the sound of a million panties.

1923
01:28:31,161 --> 01:28:33,560
Getting wet.
That's fucking dope.

1924
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:36,770
Look at this guy's house.
Look at his fucking.

1925
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:40,130
Even as fireplace.
He did up his fireplace.

1926
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:42,050
You ever seen that documentary?
Trekkies?

1927
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,260
Yes.
Long time ago.

1928
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:47,030
Dedicating their lives.
Yeah.

1929
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:48,920
There's a lot of people that just get 
obsessed with anything,

1930
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:51,710
whether it's world of warcraft being a 
trekkie,

1931
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:54,170
being a furry and trails,
chem trails,

1932
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:54,800
anything.

1933
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:59,860
Do you ever see that?
All of a sudden that live sketch where 

1934
01:28:59,860 --> 01:28:59,860
William Shatner is at a a trekkie 
convention?

1935
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:04,330
Oh No.
He just tells off all the trekkies John 

1936
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:04,330
Lewis.
He's like,

1937
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:04,860
yeah,
you're 30.

1938
01:29:04,861 --> 01:29:07,950
You ever kissed a girl?
He's like,

1939
01:29:07,951 --> 01:29:12,951
you took something fun.
I did in the sixties and turn it into a 

1940
01:29:12,951 --> 01:29:13,140
colossal waste of time.
How rude.

1941
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:18,170
Yeah.
I wonder how the trekkies felt about 

1942
01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:20,181
that trade.
It was one of the first like trekkie 

1943
01:29:20,181 --> 01:29:20,850
things on tv,
you know,

1944
01:29:20,851 --> 01:29:23,340
so they probably appreciated that they 
were being recognized.

1945
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:24,900
Yeah.
It's kind of an interesting,

1946
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:25,860
like what shows

1947
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,830
take off with that.
It's not like star trek went on forever.

1948
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,110
It went on for a few years.
I think it was five.

1949
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,910
Was it five years?
I don't think it was that many.

1950
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:37,940
I think it was more like three.
Let's say Star Trek was a great fucking 

1951
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:38,070
Cheryl.
I'll tell you that,

1952
01:29:38,071 --> 01:29:39,900
but it's amazing that like,
okay,

1953
01:29:39,901 --> 01:29:41,940
here's another perfect example.
The,

1954
01:29:41,941 --> 01:29:45,750
uh,
the fucking rocky hard midnight show,

1955
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:50,780
whatever it is,
when they do the rocky horror picture 

1956
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:53,211
show at midnight ones and they have 
these people get up and they sing along 

1957
01:29:53,211 --> 01:29:54,300
to the music they were,
they throw rice,

1958
01:29:54,301 --> 01:29:59,301
they wear the clothes that everybody's 
wearing and in the music and the 

1959
01:29:59,301 --> 01:29:59,700
musical,
they still do it at the new art,

1960
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:00,990
like once a month,
once a week.

1961
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:04,140
How's that one take off?
Like why that would is,

1962
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:07,350
what is it about the rocky horror 
picture show that makes everyone want to

1963
01:30:07,351 --> 01:30:12,351
get together and watch it over and over 
and over and over and over and over and 

1964
01:30:12,351 --> 01:30:15,981
over again.
Have these midnight screenings and 

1965
01:30:15,981 --> 01:30:15,981
everybody loves it and they dress up and
it's,

1966
01:30:15,981 --> 01:30:16,170
it's a community.
Yeah.

1967
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:19,020
But if forms over this one fucking weird
movie,

1968
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:23,320
it's all such a fucking perfect storm of
events that comes out at the right time,

1969
01:30:23,321 --> 01:30:27,930
right?
When people notice it doesn't hurt.

1970
01:30:28,030 --> 01:30:33,030
The movie is fucking bad ass.
One time viewing is a bad ass movie.

1971
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,650
It's very good.
Rocky horror picture show is a very good

1972
01:30:35,651 --> 01:30:36,760
movie.
I love that movie.

1973
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:41,850
Especially at the time.
I don't know how it holds up to get 

1974
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:44,581
today might be a little absurd.
Knowing all the rocky horror picture 

1975
01:30:44,581 --> 01:30:48,031
show shit behind it.
That's one thing I'm very aware of but 

1976
01:30:48,031 --> 01:30:49,320
don't know anything about.
So I've never seen it and I don't.

1977
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:50,510
Yeah.
It's because it's,

1978
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:53,230
it's also a time capsule.
I should probably see it again to four.

1979
01:30:53,231 --> 01:30:54,640
I recommend it because,
you know,

1980
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:55,930
I've,
I've watched um,

1981
01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:58,420
the uh,
altered states moving that uh,

1982
01:30:58,421 --> 01:31:00,820
William hurt movie about isolation 
tanks.

1983
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:06,150
I watched it and I thought it was the 
most amazing movie ever got me into 

1984
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:09,450
isolation.
Tanks got me researching and eventually 

1985
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:11,791
got me to own one.
So it was like a pivotal moment in my 

1986
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:12,100
life seeing that movie and I remember it
being very good.

1987
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:12,950
High wants to

1988
01:31:14,930 --> 01:31:18,480
dog shit is terrible.
I've barely gotten.

1989
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:24,580
Not only that,
I tried to talk Mrs Rogan into 

1990
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:26,861
Washington with me.
Watch this shit with me for five 

1991
01:31:26,861 --> 01:31:26,861
minutes.
She was like,

1992
01:31:26,861 --> 01:31:29,360
Oh fuck,
are you so bad man,

1993
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:32,420
it's missing so much that makes a movie 
good.

1994
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,540
And then you don't get to pick the movie
again for another three or four choices.

1995
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:40,550
Do you know,
talking about full trust me.

1996
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,460
Yeah.
It's weird how movies don't fucking hold

1997
01:31:47,461 --> 01:31:49,020
up.
It's a lot of them don't,

1998
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:51,720
but a lot of them do,
but it's so strange.

1999
01:31:51,721 --> 01:31:53,730
Like watch the Godfather.
It's perfect.

2000
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:56,540
It's God damn perfect gem.
It's.

2001
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:58,980
There's nothing wrong with it.
Everything is great about it.

2002
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:00,940
I can't imagine goodfellas ever been 
bad.

2003
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:02,890
It's impossible.
It's impossible.

2004
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:06,280
It's a perfect movie.
There's movies that are just so good.

2005
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:10,360
It doesn't matter if someone else 
achieved great heights as well.

2006
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:13,000
Yeah,
that movie's still gonna stand no matter

2007
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:16,300
what era it's shown in.
Especially in consideration between like

2008
01:32:16,301 --> 01:32:21,301
what technology was available to shoot a
movie like that then as it was when it 

2009
01:32:21,301 --> 01:32:21,301
was,
what's available today.

2010
01:32:21,301 --> 01:32:26,250
You know,
it's good when not even Martin Scorsese 

2011
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:26,250
can top it.
He's the one that did it.

2012
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:30,450
There you go.
One flew over the cuckoo's nest holds 

2013
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:30,870
up.
Fuck.

2014
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:31,900
Yeah,
it does.

2015
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:33,520
That's a timeless.
A theme,

2016
01:32:33,521 --> 01:32:38,521
right?
The Nicholson was I bad motherfucker 

2017
01:32:38,521 --> 01:32:38,521
when he was young.
You know,

2018
01:32:38,521 --> 01:32:41,200
people remember Nicholas who's sitting 
in front of court at the Lakers game and

2019
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:44,200
when he pretended to be a wolf and they 
remembered some stupid shit,

2020
01:32:44,410 --> 01:32:49,410
Nicholson,
but go back to China town watch 

2021
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:50,050
Nicholson and China town.
He was a bad motherfucker.

2022
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:51,250
Dude.
China.

2023
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:53,650
China town is another one.
Chinatown holds up.

2024
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,930
He was so bad.
He was so good in Chinatown.

2025
01:32:55,990 --> 01:33:00,060
We talked about it last time I was here.
10 signs point to China,

2026
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:02,140
I swear to Christ,
right?

2027
01:33:02,141 --> 01:33:02,560
Yeah,
yeah,

2028
01:33:02,561 --> 01:33:03,070
yeah,
yeah.

2029
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:08,100
How did we get to them as a major talent
to separate and isn't crazy 

2030
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:09,190
conspiracies.
Crazy.

2031
01:33:09,191 --> 01:33:10,810
Full charge.
I don't even know how it happened.

2032
01:33:11,610 --> 01:33:14,470
I Nicholson was the original full charge
Chinese secret.

2033
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:17,470
He did a lot of fucking great movies to 
men and you know,

2034
01:33:17,471 --> 01:33:18,130
he's still got it.

2035
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:19,210
Like that movie,
the departed.

2036
01:33:19,211 --> 01:33:21,760
He was still growing.
He's still great.

2037
01:33:21,761 --> 01:33:26,761
He's just.
And he has like moved seamlessly from 

2038
01:33:26,761 --> 01:33:27,250
young hot guides,
old,

2039
01:33:27,251 --> 01:33:32,020
creepy guy seamlessly.
Like there was a show recently,

2040
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:33,670
you know,
that fast and loud.

2041
01:33:33,671 --> 01:33:35,660
You know,
that show I don't think I do enough.

2042
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:37,590
Fast and loud is those guys,
uh,

2043
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:40,990
in Dallas,
they have cars and they have a,

2044
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:43,990
it's called gas monkey garage place and 
they take cars,

2045
01:33:43,991 --> 01:33:45,700
they buy them,
they fix them up and they resell them,

2046
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:48,100
sell them at auction and sell them to 
collectors.

2047
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:50,020
It's funny show.
I enjoy it.

2048
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,870
Um,
and fuck.

2049
01:33:52,871 --> 01:33:55,170
What was my point?
Nicholson?

2050
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:57,400
Fuck God.
Oh,

2051
01:33:57,401 --> 01:33:58,090
that's what it is.
Okay.

2052
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:00,260
I'm sorry I got distracted because it's 
a really good shot.

2053
01:34:00,270 --> 01:34:02,290
Right?
They did an episode with Burt Reynolds.

2054
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:07,620
That's where I got distracted.
They were redoing a trans am and the 

2055
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:10,030
Trans am was the burt reynolds firebird 
from smokey and the bandit car.

2056
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:12,700
Perfect car for like when you're in high
school,

2057
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:17,850
like during those,
that those days when smoking the band 

2058
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:17,850
was on.
That was the fucking car.

2059
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:18,310
Yeah.
Oh my God.

2060
01:34:18,311 --> 01:34:19,660
It's a firebird.
Trans Am.

2061
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:22,210
Woo.
The flames on the hood and Shit.

2062
01:34:22,211 --> 01:34:25,450
I mean it was an amazing car for like 
several years because of burt reynolds.

2063
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:28,300
But dude,
burt reynolds is fucked.

2064
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:31,840
Like he's hunched over.
They had him in there signing.

2065
01:34:31,841 --> 01:34:34,000
He's hunched over.
Great Hair,

2066
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:36,040
incredible hair.
It's ridiculous.

2067
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:39,400
He's his face.
Has been operated on way too many times.

2068
01:34:39,401 --> 01:34:44,401
Yeah,
it's strange and he's got sunglasses on 

2069
01:34:44,401 --> 01:34:44,650
and you remember him from like 
deliverance.

2070
01:34:44,651 --> 01:34:46,570
This virile,
strong,

2071
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:52,030
like dangerous looking dude who had just
gotten done playing football 

2072
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:52,030
essentially.
You know,

2073
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:56,520
he'd played football in college in 
Florida and went from there into the 

2074
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:56,520
movies.
He was a bad mother fucker,

2075
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:58,700
but you,
he couldn't make that transition.

2076
01:34:58,870 --> 01:35:02,660
Now you can become the old guy.
The spread couldn't make the spread.

2077
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:05,900
Couldn't be himself throughout the ages.
Where is Nicholson?

2078
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:08,280
The hair started falling out.
No toupee.

2079
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:11,750
Just show up to her award.
Shows his hair all fucked up.

2080
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:13,490
He big balls by.
Doesn't give a shit.

2081
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:14,710
He was always a freaking,
oh,

2082
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,640
he's an artist so he can kinda roll with
it.

2083
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:18,890
He rolled with everything rolled with 
getting fat.

2084
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,840
He just kept getting fatter and fatter 
and fatter.

2085
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:25,960
And he was in that movie with a share 
where he played the devil or something 

2086
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:25,960
like that.
You remember that movie?

2087
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:28,230
She devils or something?
There were witches.

2088
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:30,530
Witches of Eastwick.
Yeah,

2089
01:35:30,531 --> 01:35:31,610
that's it.
Yeah.

2090
01:35:31,611 --> 01:35:34,040
And he was already like fat and creepy.
Then you know,

2091
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:36,640
he like made this transition seamlessly,
right?

2092
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:39,200
So him and Burt Reynolds probably very 
similar in age,

2093
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:42,650
but he looks great and you look at Logan
Nicholson,

2094
01:35:42,651 --> 01:35:43,220
he looks great.

2095
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:48,340
He looks like an old guy and he was at 
the game the other day or floyd 

2096
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:50,870
mayweather fight and he's eating popcorn
while they're interviewing him.

2097
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:56,230
Chewing Pie.
You're not stopping for your camera if 

2098
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:56,750
you want to talk to Jack while he's 
fucking watching the fights.

2099
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:59,450
He's going to eat popcorn,
but you don't feel sad for him,

2100
01:35:59,610 --> 01:36:01,070
right?
You see burt reynolds,

2101
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:02,150
you're like,
Jesus Christ.

2102
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:05,360
Look at this poor guy like his bond.
He's all hunched over.

2103
01:36:05,361 --> 01:36:07,340
He looks like he weighs maybe 100 
pounds.

2104
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,950
I'm not even kidding.
He's got the wig on.

2105
01:36:09,951 --> 01:36:14,040
He's got his face is drawn from surgery 
and weird and shiny.

2106
01:36:14,041 --> 01:36:15,830
He's gotten.
This is kind of spark.

2107
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:17,610
He's got no life.
It's.

2108
01:36:17,611 --> 01:36:22,611
It's depressing.
It's depressing when you consider like 

2109
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:23,420
how funny he was.
If you go watch smokey and the bandit,

2110
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:26,330
it's another time capsule,
but it's hard to see.

2111
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:28,370
It's hard.
He doesn't even look like that now.

2112
01:36:28,371 --> 01:36:33,371
Man.
You know what's weird about smokey and 

2113
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:33,371
the bandit?
I watched it a couple of years ago.

2114
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:34,340
There's no.
There's no one under 30 in that movie.

2115
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:36,380
Right,
and they don't do that movies anymore.

2116
01:36:36,381 --> 01:36:39,070
It's all like young hot shots smoking 
the band.

2117
01:36:39,071 --> 01:36:39,830
It was fun,
man.

2118
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,530
The only young people that hadn't smoked
in the band,

2119
01:36:41,531 --> 01:36:46,531
it was people that almost got hit by 
cars on the baseball field when when 

2120
01:36:46,531 --> 01:36:47,840
they jumped and started driving on a 
baseball field.

2121
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:50,750
How great is the Jackie gleason in that 
movie?

2122
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:53,180
Burt Reynolds had that.
He was great.

2123
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:54,800
Jackie.
Jackie gleason was awesome.

2124
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:56,150
Moving.
What was that one?

2125
01:36:56,151 --> 01:36:57,350
I'm trying.
Sorry to interrupt you,

2126
01:36:57,351 --> 01:36:59,330
but I remember this one.
Burt Reynolds movie.

2127
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:02,390
I think it was domino.
Was that what it's called?

2128
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:06,950
Hold on.
Raynald's.

2129
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:08,910
That's a weird way to spell it.
Real good.

2130
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:11,750
That sexy motherfucker Joe,
look at at.

2131
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:16,400
He made the hairy chest sexy.
Oh,

2132
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:22,190
hold me back.
So a lot of God damn movies.

2133
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:26,660
Stick Sharkey's machine.
That was it.

2134
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:29,000
Do you remember that moving out or burt 
reynolds?

2135
01:37:29,001 --> 01:37:34,001
It was a good movie man bird.
It was a cop movie and at the time I 

2136
01:37:34,001 --> 01:37:36,260
fucking loved it.
It only has a six point two.

2137
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:38,240
I bet if I watched today,
I think it sucks,

2138
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:42,080
but I was 14 years old and burt reynolds
played a bad ass in this,

2139
01:37:42,081 --> 01:37:47,081
uh,
who's in narcotics cop and Atlanta to 

2140
01:37:47,081 --> 01:37:50,090
mobile device after a botched bust and 
the depths of this lowly division while 

2141
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:52,520
investigating a high dollar prostitution
ring.

2142
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:56,070
Sharkey stumbled across a mob murder 
with government

2143
01:37:56,070 --> 01:38:01,070
ties.
Isn't it funny when you read like crazy 

2144
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:04,250
are super overly dramatic movie read 
like the description you're like,

2145
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:06,780
what kind of life is this?
All this keeps happening to you.

2146
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:09,900
Starkey stumbled,
shockey stumbles across a mob.

2147
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:14,901
Murder with government ties and responds
by assembling is downtrodden fellow 

2148
01:38:14,901 --> 01:38:19,581
investigators,
Sharkey's machine to find the leaders 

2149
01:38:19,581 --> 01:38:20,730
and bring them to justice.
Meanwhile,

2150
01:38:20,731 --> 01:38:23,700
most cops are bored out of their fucking
minds is sitting around the office.

2151
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:26,040
No evidence,
no nothing.

2152
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:28,260
I bet it's terrible if I watch it today,
but Goddamn,

2153
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:33,290
I liked it at the time when I was 14.
Did he ever go mustache lists as he 

2154
01:38:33,290 --> 01:38:33,290
mustache?
Listen,

2155
01:38:33,290 --> 01:38:33,390
Boogie nights?
I don't think he.

2156
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:34,950
I don't know.
He,

2157
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,170
he loved the mustache man.
He wore it a lot.

2158
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:39,650
Do you have tape over your Webcam?
Yeah,

2159
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:44,870
you don't.
I don't want people seeing me being 

2160
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:44,870
tired of the NSA.

2161
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:44,870
Oh,
you know what it was,

2162
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:49,230
but I actually had a tape that they put 
over this thing from filming the show.

2163
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:54,440
They wanted to cover my apple logo and I
had an extra piece and I put it over the

2164
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,200
camera as a goof and then just left it 
there.

2165
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:02,940
I met this girl the other day that had a
camera or on me and on her phone she had

2166
01:39:02,941 --> 01:39:07,941
tape on the front end tape on the back 
like a crazy person because she's like 

2167
01:39:07,941 --> 01:39:09,330
an FBI agent.
Well now people are afraid of the NSA,

2168
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:11,250
the NSA,
tuning into your laptop.

2169
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:15,030
If you look through a million hours of 
me,

2170
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:20,060
you're going to see in me in front of 
the computer and then 10 percent of 

2171
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:20,780
those times I'll be beating off.
That's you going to say.

2172
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:24,600
So if you need to see that.
Still not a crime through that thing,

2173
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:28,200
but like why would anybody want to go 
through that data?

2174
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:31,080
What are you trying to prove?
I just tell you,

2175
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:34,590
this has been documented for some people
though.

2176
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,600
It's dangerous as I find out that you 
beat off.

2177
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:40,500
Like if you found out the Colin Powell 
was an obsessive like foot fetish.

2178
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:42,240
It would change the way I thought about 
him.

2179
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:45,600
That's his move.
He loved like watching a video.

2180
01:39:45,610 --> 01:39:50,610
Very specific.
One girl's licking your balls while the 

2181
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:50,610
other one you're coming on our feet 
right now.

2182
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:55,371
That would change the way I thought 
about him and I would question his 

2183
01:39:55,371 --> 01:39:57,411
ability to lead the military style even 
though it's irrational for me to think 

2184
01:39:57,411 --> 01:39:57,420
that.
Yeah.

2185
01:39:57,421 --> 01:40:00,630
If you found out that he was really into
transgender porn,

2186
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:02,080
that was his big thing.
You would.

2187
01:40:02,150 --> 01:40:04,740
You would not trust them when it comes 
to decision making.

2188
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:09,860
Yeah,
because I mean meanwhile there's no 

2189
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:11,811
other indications.
He's exactly the same person as when he 

2190
01:40:11,811 --> 01:40:11,811
was like the most awesome general ever.

2191
01:40:11,811 --> 01:40:13,410
His resumes the exact same.
Just find all this training.

2192
01:40:13,411 --> 01:40:15,150
Porn shaped.
What if it gets out to the news?

2193
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:17,370
People find out how we enjoy this 
pleasure.

2194
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:22,200
Was that slice of pain trans transgender
with a girl.

2195
01:40:22,201 --> 01:40:24,220
It's pretty sweet.
Um,

2196
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:29,540
what does that mean girl to a boy,
meaning like a girl that has like boobs 

2197
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:33,150
and hectic but it dick and it's fucking 
a normal girl that's hot you that,

2198
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:38,320
you watch that,
watch that because it's like you take 

2199
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,140
the guy who you don't really want to see
anyways and you give them boobs and make

2200
01:40:40,141 --> 01:40:45,141
them look like a girl.
It doesn't affect Brian's reputation 

2201
01:40:45,141 --> 01:40:45,141
when he says something like that.
It doesn't have a reputation.

2202
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:51,170
Reputation is that.
That's the best aspect of his 

2203
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:54,111
personality,
his curiosity and his willingness to 

2204
01:40:54,111 --> 01:40:54,150
hang his neck out there,
but we don't want them leaving

2205
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:58,180
the military at the same time.
It's like instead of having to look at a

2206
01:40:58,181 --> 01:41:00,330
hairy dude or some ugly dude.
No,

2207
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:01,840
I see your logic.
Have you tried it?

2208
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:03,160
No,
it doesn't work with me.

2209
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,590
I limit myself to a,
to.

2210
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:08,410
I don't want to watch that.
I'm scared.

2211
01:41:08,411 --> 01:41:12,460
I'll like it because then it'll be all I
watch and now I'm Colin Powell.

2212
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:17,530
I think personally when you start 
getting into weird freaky shit,

2213
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:20,860
like if you're only into like someone 
coming on feet or something like that,

2214
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:22,920
you need to stop beating off for a 
couple months.

2215
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:28,260
Like maybe you've talked yourself into 
some weird box where every girl has to 

2216
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:31,250
have a dick and you know everybody's 
feed up to have red nails,

2217
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:37,720
just no fucking red nail Polish.
You'll fight your search message boards 

2218
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:40,380
for the Red Nail Polish fetish jerking 
off forum and everyone agrees with these

2219
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:41,050
assholes.

2220
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:45,010
Black Goth toads who wants to see that 
and you find the red nail Polish,

2221
01:41:45,011 --> 01:41:47,560
but still not good enough.
You've got to find the perfect.

2222
01:41:47,650 --> 01:41:49,600
There's always gonna be people to take 
anything,

2223
01:41:49,601 --> 01:41:54,601
whether it's a conversation,
whether it's a relationship or whether 

2224
01:41:54,601 --> 01:41:55,870
it's star trek and take things to a bad 
place.

2225
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,780
They take a good thing and they put it 
in a bad place.

2226
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:02,500
That's why porn gets such a God damn 
terrible reputation is because.

2227
01:42:02,501 --> 01:42:07,501
Yeah,
there is a few dudes who beat off a wee 

2228
01:42:07,501 --> 01:42:07,501
bit.
Oh yeah,

2229
01:42:07,501 --> 01:42:07,970
yeah,
yeah,

2230
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:09,470
yeah,
me too much,

2231
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:13,540
but there's also people that use it so 
that you don't have to date people.

2232
01:42:13,541 --> 01:42:15,880
They don't really want to date just to 
get some sex.

2233
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:17,830
They just see it and they,
you know,

2234
01:42:17,831 --> 01:42:22,831
they didn't create it.
They don't feel totally responsible for 

2235
01:42:22,831 --> 01:42:26,090
just watching it and downloading it and 
then they beat off and then they go 

2236
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:28,540
about their day full charge being 
trapped like poor Dick Van Dyke,

2237
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:31,720
Dick Van Dyke who had to sleep in a 
different bed,

2238
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:35,500
wasn't allowed to beat off them,
couldn't even go fishing back then.

2239
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:38,650
They thought Satan would come and steal 
you and your sleep if you beat off.

2240
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:39,430
Yeah,
they did.

2241
01:42:39,431 --> 01:42:43,120
They didn't know how it got labeled a 
homosexual thing.

2242
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:46,750
Beat off and be masturbating.
Beat off and be gay.

2243
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:47,770
Well,
it should be.

2244
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,390
I mean,
you're a man fucking a man.

2245
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:51,220
You have a dick in your hand.
What are you doing?

2246
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:53,990
You're doing gay shit.
You're fucking a man's hand up there.

2247
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:54,940
You.
Oh,

2248
01:42:54,941 --> 01:42:57,550
I quit fucking Weirdo.
Weirdo.

2249
01:42:57,551 --> 01:43:01,510
Fucking your own.
I don't believe in gay sex except my own

2250
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:04,480
hand.
My both my hands are gay as fuck.

2251
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:09,500
Yeah,
I right to way more guy left hands gay 

2252
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:12,061
and my right hand's getting.
Fortunately they're only gay from my 

2253
01:43:12,061 --> 01:43:15,070
Dick.
Monogamous lucked out on that one.

2254
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:16,570
Not there's anything wrong with being 
gay,

2255
01:43:16,571 --> 01:43:18,580
but it seems like you guys carried more 
weight than we do.

2256
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:21,340
We carry,
carry a greater societal burden.

2257
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:24,880
Wouldn't not from people like me but 
from people who judge.

2258
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:27,010
Yup.
So in that case,

2259
01:43:27,011 --> 01:43:30,520
I'm glad my Dick is the only thing that 
my hands are attracted to.

2260
01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:33,850
You have less to deal with.
Gay Hands are called Jazz hands,

2261
01:43:33,851 --> 01:43:35,140
right?
No jazz hands.

2262
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:40,180
Trying to put a little extra energy and 
something that really sucks.

2263
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:44,950
You know,
something that's really not that good or

2264
01:43:44,951 --> 01:43:48,710
you're trying to downplay something that
is unbelievably super awesome data.

2265
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:53,940
Like if you're standing there in front 
of a movie waiting for three years and 

2266
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:56,510
you have the opening night tickets,
those are legit jazz hands.

2267
01:43:56,650 --> 01:43:58,100
You know when you're waiting for the 
hobbit.

2268
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:02,570
Desolation of smoke to come out waiting 
in line.

2269
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:05,540
Do you remember when the fucking Harry 
Potter novels were coming out and people

2270
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:09,560
were making videos of them running by 
and giving away the ending?

2271
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:11,250
Oh,
no,

2272
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:11,810
no,
no,

2273
01:44:11,811 --> 01:44:13,060
no.
Yeah,

2274
01:44:13,110 --> 01:44:14,330
God,
those guys were cons.

2275
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:19,600
It would have been great if the video 
ended with somebody just full line 

2276
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,010
citing the guy on the bike just knocking
them down,

2277
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:24,080
kicking his ass and all the fucking 
Harry Potter dorks join in.

2278
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:29,480
It was funny.
Beaten with brooms.

2279
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:34,250
Imagine man.
Just wanting to steal joy is one,

2280
01:44:34,251 --> 01:44:39,251
a steel mystery from people.
There's always somebody and that was 

2281
01:44:39,251 --> 01:44:39,251
bad.
I mean,

2282
01:44:39,251 --> 01:44:42,910
you know,
I guess the Internet was still around 

2283
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:45,161
then.
I don't know what kind of spoilers you 

2284
01:44:45,161 --> 01:44:45,380
would get because social media wasn't as
strong like twitter and facebook and all

2285
01:44:45,381 --> 01:44:50,381
that stuff,
so I bet it was probably harder to find 

2286
01:44:50,381 --> 01:44:52,370
out accidentally with the end of a book 
was you had to search for a spoiler.

2287
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:54,920
Yeah.
Basically back then you got to really go

2288
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:59,921
looking or you had to get stuck next to 
some asshole who won't stop talking 

2289
01:44:59,921 --> 01:45:01,270
about it and you're like,
I don't want to know.

2290
01:45:01,271 --> 01:45:01,880
No,
it doesn't matter.

2291
01:45:01,881 --> 01:45:03,290
You're still enjoy it.
Listen,

2292
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:07,190
he goes into the like,
why are you still telling me this?

2293
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:11,250
I've been working all week and when I'm 
done,

2294
01:45:11,251 --> 01:45:12,550
I want to watch Harry Potter.
God

2295
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,980
damaged.
I had a guy do that to me.

2296
01:45:13,981 --> 01:45:16,230
Once I got that I really respected and 
was so brutal.

2297
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:19,920
I couldn't believe my opinion of him 
changed.

2298
01:45:19,921 --> 01:45:24,921
So I always use a famous guy.
He's telling me this really fucking 

2299
01:45:24,921 --> 01:45:26,030
boring version of that.
Um,

2300
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:27,780
what is the,
the,

2301
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:29,550
the.
I drink your milkshake moving.

2302
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:31,830
Oh,
there will be blood.

2303
01:45:31,831 --> 01:45:32,780
There will be blood.
Yeah.

2304
01:45:32,850 --> 01:45:34,290
And he's telling me about the opening 
scene.

2305
01:45:34,690 --> 01:45:35,860
He's describing the scene.
I'm like,

2306
01:45:35,861 --> 01:45:37,660
please stop.
Please stop.

2307
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:39,700
Please stop.
I'm going to see this movie.

2308
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:41,290
It doesn't matter.
So you still enjoy it.

2309
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:42,250
I still enjoy.
I'll feel it.

2310
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:47,260
Enjoy it.
You're telling me what's happening and 

2311
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:47,260
he wouldn't stop.
I literally had to walk away.

2312
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:48,970
I go,
Jesus fucking Christ.

2313
01:45:49,230 --> 01:45:50,560
And I had A.
I had to leave.

2314
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:52,990
He was insisting on letting,
not just me,

2315
01:45:52,991 --> 01:45:56,160
but other people around me know exactly 
what happened in this opening scene.

2316
01:45:56,170 --> 01:45:57,660
I'm like,
fucking quizzes.

2317
01:45:57,910 --> 01:46:00,430
Daniel Day Lewis was doing.
Dude,

2318
01:46:00,431 --> 01:46:03,490
I told you don't talk about me and 
Daniel,

2319
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,750
if I have a protein shake to think he 
does everything perfectly.

2320
01:46:08,350 --> 01:46:13,350
I would never criticize him.
Have you guys seen those pants that the 

2321
01:46:13,350 --> 01:46:14,530
young kids are wearing nowadays that 
looks like these young kids?

2322
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:19,560
Kids.
It's where it looks like you have like 

2323
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:22,170
poopy drawers almost.
Where it's like it's not droopy pants 

2324
01:46:22,170 --> 01:46:22,170
here.

2325
01:46:22,170 --> 01:46:26,010
Here's a video like fever,
like wearing them where it almost looks 

2326
01:46:26,010 --> 01:46:29,491
like,
like the crutches down way far like by 

2327
01:46:29,491 --> 01:46:30,870
your knees and it almost.
Oh,

2328
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:35,880
hold on.
Like hammering and almost looks kind of 

2329
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:35,880
like hammer pants.
What?

2330
01:46:36,190 --> 01:46:37,300
This.
Okay.

2331
01:46:37,301 --> 01:46:40,150
So they're skinny,
but bagging the crotch.

2332
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:42,130
Like the crotch goes down to you about 
your knees.

2333
01:46:42,131 --> 01:46:45,580
You look like kind of like a penguin or 
you better not be checking leg kicks.

2334
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:47,950
Tell you that and see how the pot book 
that's coming out of his van.

2335
01:46:47,951 --> 01:46:49,340
This is from yesterday.
He's getting in trouble.

2336
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:51,090
Exclusive.
Yeah.

2337
01:46:51,091 --> 01:46:56,091
They were like,
police were telling me it can't hotbox 

2338
01:46:56,091 --> 01:46:56,091
with his van.
Why is he driving in a van?

2339
01:46:56,650 --> 01:46:58,600
Is that how he gets around?
I guess so.

2340
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:01,200
He brings his crew with him.
That's how you bring a crew.

2341
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:06,370
Yeah.
You have to advantage when everybody 

2342
01:47:06,370 --> 01:47:06,370
traveled together.

2343
01:47:06,370 --> 01:47:07,380
He's got immense crew.
You know when you're a legit super duper

2344
01:47:07,381 --> 01:47:09,720
star,
you gathering immense crew like he has.

2345
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:14,930
I'd love to have a crew.
I think the full charge crew needs a 

2346
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:15,870
special name,
like the volts to charge heads or the.

2347
01:47:15,871 --> 01:47:17,820
Yeah,
the the volts.

2348
01:47:19,620 --> 01:47:24,620
The amps.
Amperage ever readies like that 

2349
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:29,060
Duracell's duracell group.
I've seen people wear these pants all 

2350
01:47:29,101 --> 01:47:31,320
the time and they hit me in a like a 
like a,

2351
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:32,970
like a gross out.
Oh,

2352
01:47:32,971 --> 01:47:37,971
here they are because they are.
They're like hammer pants and I'm not 

2353
01:47:37,971 --> 01:47:39,480
shocked this shit right now.
I am not shocked.

2354
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:43,320
Human beings are begging for the aliens 
to fucking wipe us out.

2355
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:48,920
Begging with every new fashion choice.
With every new video we make.

2356
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:51,450
Seemed like it was getting pretty normal
there for awhile.

2357
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:53,580
Incorrect.
Full charge.

2358
01:47:53,581 --> 01:47:55,770
Very sweat of paying attention.
Fella.

2359
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:58,440
It's been downhill since the fucking 
bell bottom.

2360
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:02,640
We accepted the bell bottom and it was a
slide my friend,

2361
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:08,220
a slide.
I think I'm going to go to track suits 

2362
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:08,220
and fanny packs.
I'll do it.

2363
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:10,320
I think I'm going to commit.
I'm for the tracks.

2364
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:14,100
One track suit and fanny pack is my new 
look for life.

2365
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:18,240
I think my body will appreciate it.
It's very light and relaxing.

2366
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:21,870
Let's find some good tracksuits Brian,
and change that to our new wardrobe.

2367
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:26,910
Show you what?
The ones that I want to live in 

2368
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:26,910
California.
Man.

2369
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:27,330
I don't need to wear thermals and shit.
I don't need layers of goose down.

2370
01:48:27,870 --> 01:48:29,790
I can get by with a track suit and a 
fanny pack.

2371
01:48:30,090 --> 01:48:31,980
I want to be part.
I want to be part of your crew.

2372
01:48:31,981 --> 01:48:34,200
I don't feel like it started my own 
tracks.

2373
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:39,680
What kind of sneakers should we were?
We definitely got to wear pumas or 

2374
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:39,680
Adidas,
whatever,

2375
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:40,650
whatever the whatever the track suit is.

2376
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:43,410
Here's the shoes.
That was a six dozer.

2377
01:48:43,411 --> 01:48:45,180
Good.
That's good.

2378
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:47,760
That's a good choice.
That's a comfortable shoe to.

2379
01:48:47,810 --> 01:48:52,810
Yep,
and if you're wearing like a blue track 

2380
01:48:52,810 --> 01:48:52,810
suit with some white stripes,
that'll fit nicely.

2381
01:48:52,810 --> 01:48:55,180
If we learned anything from fat James,
it's track suits and a six.

2382
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:57,560
No doubt about it.
Rest in peace.

2383
01:48:57,570 --> 01:48:59,160
Fred James.
Yeah,

2384
01:48:59,161 --> 01:49:04,161
track suits and a six.
I haven't had a track suit since I was 

2385
01:49:04,161 --> 01:49:06,921
probably 19.
Was the last time you had an actual 

2386
01:49:06,921 --> 01:49:06,921
legit tracks?
I got one when I was like 28 because one

2387
01:49:06,921 --> 01:49:08,490
of the.
I was going out with this girl.

2388
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:11,430
I wanted to try to pull it off like 
we're talking about now.

2389
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:13,740
Yeah,
she worked at a echo,

2390
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:15,900
you know that,
that Mark Echo that clothing line.

2391
01:49:15,910 --> 01:49:18,990
She worked there and I'm like,
give me one of these tracksuits.

2392
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,780
And I tried it for like a week and I 
just couldn't keep it up,

2393
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:25,040
you know,
track suit.

2394
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:26,760
I couldn't commit,
couldn't put it that way.

2395
01:49:26,761 --> 01:49:28,390
I didn't have a crew.
Yeah.

2396
01:49:28,730 --> 01:49:33,730
These weren't ready yet to get to have 
some other venue that also work so 

2397
01:49:33,730 --> 01:49:34,360
everybody doesn't give a fuck together,
you know,

2398
01:49:34,620 --> 01:49:37,440
because it's just you on your own out 
there in the wilderness of life,

2399
01:49:37,441 --> 01:49:40,920
being judged by your fashion choices 
where to fucking tracksuit.

2400
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:43,440
And you see a girl outside of a place 
where a girl,

2401
01:49:43,441 --> 01:49:44,820
if you were dressed like this,
you'd be like,

2402
01:49:44,850 --> 01:49:45,750
Oh,
oh,

2403
01:49:45,780 --> 01:49:46,570
your mat,
full tron,

2404
01:49:46,590 --> 01:49:48,010
stand up comedian.
But she sees

2405
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,680
you and while you're wearing a track 
suit,

2406
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:55,920
just like being casual,
and I like dressing like a moron is that

2407
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:57,580
they don't buy that anymore or they 
don't buy it.

2408
01:49:57,610 --> 01:49:59,350
Is it a moral thing or is it a 
comfortable thing?

2409
01:49:59,351 --> 01:50:03,760
Are we the morons full charge?
I know I'm the moron with our zippers to

2410
01:50:03,761 --> 01:50:07,810
get our dicks trapped in our belts when 
we could just have a simple drawstring,

2411
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:13,170
easy access.
We got to start smoking cigars to to 

2412
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:13,170
let's do it.
So little,

2413
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:14,920
little back,
little bit of organized crime.

2414
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:18,100
Bruce Lee,
Bruce Lee owned that type of track suit.

2415
01:50:18,101 --> 01:50:23,101
The same way Hitler on the mustache.
You can't wear that without people 

2416
01:50:23,101 --> 01:50:24,790
thinking that you bruce.
I said Bruce,

2417
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:27,580
many more people than I see like this 
one.

2418
01:50:27,610 --> 01:50:29,380
Nothing.
You could wear that no problem.

2419
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:32,140
But that game of death one,
now Bruce Lee owns that.

2420
01:50:32,170 --> 01:50:33,070
That's,
that's his.

2421
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:35,050
You can't wear that.
You can't wear a yellow jumpsuit.

2422
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:40,140
It'd be embarrassing to wear a jumpsuit 
and like a break dance competition 

2423
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:40,630
breaks out and then you got nothing.
You get nothing.

2424
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:44,740
You're just kind of inching away 
quietly.

2425
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:47,740
Bruce Lee,
that,

2426
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:49,810
that yellow track suit.
If you wear that,

2427
01:50:49,811 --> 01:50:50,380
people go,
Yo,

2428
01:50:50,381 --> 01:50:53,250
what's up bruce?
They'll immediately go to that.

2429
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:55,500
That tracks who is off limits.
If you have a track suit,

2430
01:50:55,501 --> 01:50:58,210
you better learn a skill and that had 
better be karate,

2431
01:50:58,250 --> 01:51:02,680
breakdancing or account numbers and now 
that I'm thinking about it,

2432
01:51:02,681 --> 01:51:06,590
is there one actor more synonymous with 
a very specific type of jumpsuit?

2433
01:51:06,591 --> 01:51:09,220
Then Bruce Lee?
No,

2434
01:51:09,221 --> 01:51:12,310
I mean unless you count ll cool j,
which you can't,

2435
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:17,340
but they can't because he owned that 
yellow jumpsuit and the game of their 

2436
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:20,381
eyes so hard that to this day,
the only time you see people wearing 

2437
01:51:20,381 --> 01:51:21,640
them is when they're wearing it for a 
bruce Lee costume.

2438
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:24,760
Right?
A key owns that fucking yellow jumpsuit.

2439
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:29,170
There's never been a time like that 
where someone has just a really standard

2440
01:51:29,171 --> 01:51:34,030
type of athletic apparel that is so 
common to them that when you see it,

2441
01:51:34,031 --> 01:51:35,920
all you think about is them fanny pack.

2442
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:39,850
Hey,
a fanny pack,

2443
01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:47,850
when you have an ass like that,
no one sees anything other than your 

2444
01:51:47,850 --> 01:51:50,191
ass.
That fanny pack is only examined by 

2445
01:51:50,191 --> 01:51:50,191
people online.
If you were there in front of her,

2446
01:51:50,191 --> 01:51:55,081
it would be like a mirage.
You wouldn't be able to sit and you'd 

2447
01:51:55,081 --> 01:51:55,630
see her hips to asset ratio is 
incredible.

2448
01:51:56,350 --> 01:51:59,140
I think that it's a real.
She's ridiculous.

2449
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:02,650
Ridiculously hot.
I forget what we're talking about now.

2450
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:08,040
Jack Nicholson,
burt reynolds was burt rental truck.

2451
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:14,120
It was.
When you see a guy like burt reynolds 

2452
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:16,450
that's like had all that plastic surgery
and really hurting right now.

2453
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:19,060
No one's won the plastic surgery game 
yet.

2454
01:52:19,061 --> 01:52:20,070
Have they?
Well,

2455
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,650
here's what's really crazy.
You know,

2456
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:23,710
it was the same age as him,
so investors,

2457
01:52:23,790 --> 01:52:26,020
stallone [inaudible] that crazy.
Fuck.

2458
01:52:26,021 --> 01:52:27,700
That looks like he's 30 years old,
right?

2459
01:52:27,701 --> 01:52:30,130
I mean its face doesn't it?
But his body is ridiculous.

2460
01:52:30,130 --> 01:52:33,430
He's fucking shredded.
What Sylvester do and just hair dye.

2461
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:38,860
I mean he's definitely doing that.
He's eating babies but to sylvester have

2462
01:52:38,861 --> 01:52:41,020
any plastic surgery hormones.
Yeah,

2463
01:52:41,021 --> 01:52:44,620
I'm sure he has.
He said he's an actor the most.

2464
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:47,270
By the time they get to be like that 
age,

2465
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:52,750
especially with superstar blockbuster 
type dudes that keep the hair the same 

2466
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:53,240
color.
I've had a little bit of something done.

2467
01:52:53,530 --> 01:52:54,160
Yeah,
no,

2468
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:56,240
just a little tuck here.
A little botox there.

2469
01:52:56,241 --> 01:53:01,241
They get that weird shiny skin that 
doesn't move and when they do this it 

2470
01:53:01,241 --> 01:53:01,241
doesn't work.
Right.

2471
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:03,440
So it's like.
So then he can't even act.

2472
01:53:03,441 --> 01:53:05,300
It's like shiny.
Can't even be surprised.

2473
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:07,130
You know?
You can be surprised you're in a movie.

2474
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:12,050
Somebody hired your old crazy ass.
He poisoned skin.

2475
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:14,420
Frozen.
Fucking paralyzed skin because you think

2476
01:53:14,421 --> 01:53:17,060
that looks better.
Bruce Willis kept it real.

2477
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:18,040
Still working.

2478
01:53:18,070 --> 01:53:19,340
Still working.
Yeah.

2479
01:53:19,341 --> 01:53:20,450
There's a lot of those guys.
Right.

2480
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:23,840
And then stand up comedy to a lot of 
those guys.

2481
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:27,680
Like a George Carlin.
Perfect example.

2482
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:33,040
George Carlin just kept being George 
Carlin through being a young guy to be 

2483
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:35,450
in an old curmudgeon and old,
like scholarly curmudgeon,

2484
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:37,130
breaking down the.
You know,

2485
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:42,990
the,
the funny shit about the world became 

2486
01:53:42,990 --> 01:53:42,990
stayed the same guy.
Yeah.

2487
01:53:42,990 --> 01:53:44,130
Something happened to some people 
though,

2488
01:53:44,131 --> 01:53:45,410
man,
where they just can't do that.

2489
01:53:46,690 --> 01:53:50,330
If something happens to some people,
they just can't accept it.

2490
01:53:50,331 --> 01:53:52,280
They got to cut their face.
Yeah.

2491
01:53:52,830 --> 01:53:56,330
Not a lot of comics doing this.
The surgery.

2492
01:53:56,331 --> 01:54:01,331
Right.
What if it became like shown on paper 

2493
01:54:01,331 --> 01:54:02,980
that duck lips like every punchline.
Ten percent,

2494
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:07,120
but it probably does

2495
01:54:08,430 --> 01:54:10,170
slips.
He Does Punch Lips.

2496
01:54:10,230 --> 01:54:11,730
I say a punchline.
Lips.

2497
01:54:11,810 --> 01:54:14,020
It does it like on purpose.
Like tell joking

2498
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:16,400
and he's got his face cut too.
He's got that scar.

2499
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:18,450
Yeah.
But that scar is an accident.

2500
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:23,760
And you're right though,
because that's car king from a laser 

2501
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:26,331
surgery.
He was trying to get as hair removed 

2502
01:54:26,331 --> 01:54:28,761
from his face and they burned his face.
Bronies fucking every fucking Harry.

2503
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:35,770
And He shaves his face.
He gets stubble like an hour later and 

2504
01:54:35,770 --> 01:54:35,970
it's all the way up to his cheeks.
So you had it.

2505
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,820
He was trying to get it lasered.
They boxed them.

2506
01:54:38,821 --> 01:54:40,740
I wonder if he got paid for that.
Did you get paid for that?

2507
01:54:40,770 --> 01:54:43,110
I don't know.
But you might have just done it again on

2508
01:54:43,111 --> 01:54:46,590
his eyebrows and that's why he wears the
hat down like this and glasses.

2509
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:48,570
I hope he doesn't.
He doesn't need to do that.

2510
01:54:48,571 --> 01:54:53,571
He's brody,
she didn't give them love for food 

2511
01:54:53,571 --> 01:54:56,600
eyebrows or something.
Doesn't really laser lasered eyebrows 

2512
01:54:56,600 --> 01:55:00,170
and the they physically much.
It's something that lasts up to like,

2513
01:55:00,171 --> 01:55:02,560
I think he said six months or something 
like

2514
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:03,540
lasered.
Yeah.

2515
01:55:03,660 --> 01:55:04,370
Well the laser,
it,

2516
01:55:04,371 --> 01:55:04,730
it,
it'll,

2517
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,860
it'll kill like a lot of your eyebrow 
hairs for a long time.

2518
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:11,890
Like a lot of girls get on there.
I go down,

2519
01:55:11,891 --> 01:55:13,700
the Hoo Ha and they get it lasered down.
Right?

2520
01:55:13,770 --> 01:55:16,560
It gets a tattoo though.
It's not permanent tattoo,

2521
01:55:16,561 --> 01:55:19,080
but it's when it goes away in like six 
months.

2522
01:55:19,110 --> 01:55:20,890
What are you talking about?
He has eyebrows tattooed.

2523
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:24,570
That's why I shouldn't be talking about 
why while you're talking about that.

2524
01:55:24,590 --> 01:55:27,150
We talked about on an ice house cause he
already talked to you yet.

2525
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:28,630
He's so crazy.
He would.

2526
01:55:31,590 --> 01:55:34,420
The hair chronicles.
He was fucking unbelievably funny.

2527
01:55:34,421 --> 01:55:37,600
The last time he was on here.
Everybody's talking about it.

2528
01:55:37,601 --> 01:55:41,240
Then one of the funniest podcast I've 
ever done with him without a doubt.

2529
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:43,650
So cool.
He's got the TV show because he like.

2530
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:44,120
I

2531
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:46,800
don't know if you remember,
like when he showed up in La in the late

2532
01:55:46,801 --> 01:55:51,801
nineties,
everyone was going fucking ape shit for 

2533
01:55:51,801 --> 01:55:51,801
him.
Like on the,

2534
01:55:51,801 --> 01:55:52,190
on the comic circuit.
Well,

2535
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:57,200
I know comics have always respected him.
He's always been a guy that we stan hope

2536
01:55:58,111 --> 01:56:00,600
and I had him to the opening warmup 
stuff.
