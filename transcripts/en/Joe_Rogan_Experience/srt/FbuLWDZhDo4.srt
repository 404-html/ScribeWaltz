1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I felt that I'd be willing to do a 
podcast with fresh back from Brazil 

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,230
within hours of landing on sacred 
American soil,

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,360
but you're one of them,
Josh stuff live.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,670
It's a real pleasure to be back.
Thanks.

5
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:12,670
Bye Man.
What?

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,770
So first of all,
well,

7
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:16,470
let me say the last time I was here,
I was like,

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,650
out of it.
I was,

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,400
I was white knuckling it just.
I was,

10
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:21,840
I was hung over.
I was tired.

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,540
It was 10 in the morning.
I hadn't slept probably.

12
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,390
I'd been on like a late night flight 
from New York.

13
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,860
I was sick.
Joe.

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,050
I didn't know you were sick.
You,

15
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,800
you performed admirably?
Yeah,

16
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:34,170
I tried.
I tried to kill it today.

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,700
Shit.
I'm just going to smash it.

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,670
Week one today.
Yeah.

19
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:39,030
Good.
I'll,

20
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,200
I'll pick it up.
Thank you.

21
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:45,201
We'll just switch switch roles.
You can sit back and I'll ask you 

22
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:45,201
questions.

23
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:45,720
Yeah.
How you feeling?

24
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,650
Question to my own expectations.
My own of my own self.

25
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:52,800
Just maybe travel like long trips before
every podcast.

26
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,670
What?
Uh,

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,330
what was Brazil about a.
The UFC great.

28
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,380
Ronda rousey fight.
Excellent.

29
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,390
Pretty crazy time.
Yeah.

30
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:01,380
Fantastic.
It was,

31
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:06,381
I'm watching her fight is like a.
it's like watching some historical 

32
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:10,641
thing.
It's like I was saying like when people 

33
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:14,061
tell their grandchildren.
I was there when Muhammad Ali fought 

34
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:17,001
Sonny Liston,
know I was there when Mike Tyson beat 

35
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:17,001
Trevor Berbick and won the heavyweight 
title.

36
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:17,970
Yeah.
That's what it feels like when you watch

37
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:19,950
her fight,
like you're not just seeing a fight.

38
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,900
You're watching some crazy historic 
event.

39
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,400
It's amazing.
She's an.

40
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,090
She's just a freak.
It was like a freak of all freaks.

41
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,270
Beautiful Woman Who's just this insane,
furious combat athlete.

42
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,550
Nuts.
You're the one who's just stepped off a 

43
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,550
13 hour flight and is now working all 
afternoon,

44
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,270
so that's good too.
That's hard.

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,120
Especially doing this.
Yeah,

46
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:46,010
that's true.
We haven't.

47
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,930
We have pretty easy jobs just sitting 
around talking to people all day in.

48
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,270
We do,
we do,

49
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,630
but I really enjoy your show,
man.

50
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:55,110
You have some excellent interviews.
Did you interview that Peter Singer guy?

51
00:01:55,111 --> 00:02:00,111
Yeah.
That's the Animal Liberation Liberation 

52
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:00,111
Guy.
He founded the.

53
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:02,550
He coined the term animal liberation and
he sort of invented the.

54
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,830
He's one of the world's most important 
bioethicists.

55
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,140
Like I mean in terms of just thinking 
about the morality,

56
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:12,141
he's such a brilliant guy.
He's as if it's like an alien just came 

57
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:12,900
down to width and said,
all right,

58
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,960
we're not going to have any more 
preconceptions about what people think 

59
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,751
is right and wrong.
We're going to start from basics and 

60
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:20,751
think,
okay,

61
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:23,730
why do we think about the morality of 
things the way that we do and how,

62
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,880
in what ways is that wrong?
So like he ends up with these crazy 

63
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:28,880
conclusions and people like hate him.

64
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,710
For some of them,
like saying it's not necessarily wrong 

65
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,460
to say kill an infant,
a newborn infant.

66
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,770
Well,
how does he justify that?

67
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,190
I think it's on the grounds that what's 
wrong with killing something as a sort 

68
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,640
of combination of snuffing out the life 
of,

69
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,700
of a,
of a being that has the capability of 

70
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,800
conceiving of itself as having a future.
Right?

71
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,950
You're thwarting a person's plans when 
you kill them,

72
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,310
you're robbing them of all of the 
opportunities that they hoped that they 

73
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:58,920
were gonna have and you're presumably 
causing them pain.

74
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,210
But if you could painlessly.
I mean,

75
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:06,211
if you don't,
if you think of life as being an 

76
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:08,311
incremental thing that starts from a 
conception and then gradually evolves up

77
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:12,820
into adulthood and sort of self 
awareness and consciousness.

78
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,880
I mean does it two day old baby have 
that much more sentience and 

79
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,991
consciousness and sense of itself than a
22 week old baby in the womb does not a 

80
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,850
huge amount necessarily.
I mean,

81
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,090
I'm not saying I agree with it,
but he just,

82
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,840
he's just a fascinating person to talk 
to.

83
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,650
Does he have children?
Yeah,

84
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:30,130
I think so.

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,280
That's interesting that he thinks that 
wavy as children because I could see it 

86
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,060
if you're,
if you're trying to make some sort of a 

87
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,060
logic argument,
you know,

88
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,910
that you could,
you could argue it like that,

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,120
but as far as like being a human being,
the difference being significant in that

90
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,920
a child represents potential and child 
represents to a lot of people represents

91
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:55,430
this insane bond of love that you have 
with the baby.

92
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,370
I,
I,

93
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:56,660
you know,

94
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:02,050
I think just to clarify,
I think he's only saying like in cases 

95
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:02,050
where,
you know,

96
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,970
the parents don't want it or something.
I mean he's,

97
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,140
he's not.
Obviously if you kill someone else's 

98
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,501
baby,
you're doing a terrible thing because 

99
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:11,501
you're depriving the parents of the kid,
right?

100
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:16,240
Oh,
they're saying like if they don't want 

101
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,371
their baby,
it's not that big a deal in a situation 

102
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:18,371
like a Bush as if it was like an 
abortion.

103
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:19,600
There's some people that are extreme

104
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:24,710
animal rights folks that also believed 
that there's something about if you did 

105
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,691
kill a person,
at least you stopped that person from 

106
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:32,871
killing all the animals.
They're going to kill or be responsible 

107
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:32,871
for the death of in their entire life,

108
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,910
which is,
which gets real insane.

109
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,130
That's kind of crazy.
I don't think he'd agree with that.

110
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,960
Well,
you want to know real crazy,

111
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,570
the lobster liberation movement?
No.

112
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,890
Yes,
no.

113
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:44,090
Yes.
There's people that

114
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,200
break into restaurants or places that 
have seafood and keep lobsters and they 

115
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,070
released them and take the rubber bands 
off.

116
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,250
They're atrophied clause and release 
them back into the ocean.

117
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:54,560
Those

118
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,080
lobsters out stuff of heaven in the 
ocean and they've had a too good for too

119
00:04:57,081 --> 00:05:00,140
long.
It might not be stimulating being in the

120
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,670
lobster tank,
but it sure is safe.

121
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,610
I don't know if the lobsters eat while 
they're in the tank.

122
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,610
That's a good question.
I don't know how they must be fed.

123
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:08,690
Right?
I don't.

124
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:10,640
I've never seen it,
if you will,

125
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:11,930
that wouldn't do it while you're eating 
them.

126
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:18,010
But they always have the rubber bands on
their claws so they don't Jack each 

127
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,160
other up while they were in that tank.
I'll probe on top of each other.

128
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,110
It is pretty.
I like,

129
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,950
I,
I'm.

130
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,970
It is kind of sick.
Like I,

131
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:28,971
I have no problem with it because I do 
eat maintenance so I can't really be a 

132
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:32,961
but could have added,
but I think there's something just kind 

133
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:34,430
of oddly sadistic about sitting there at
a table and just being like,

134
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,520
alright,
I'm going to have that,

135
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,090
that I'm going to end that one's life 
right now and then I'm just going to eat

136
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:40,160
him in front of his buddies.

137
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,620
Yeah.
Well we have a weird thing about.

138
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,340
We have like a hierarchy of animals that
we love and that's one of the things we 

139
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,690
found out about Cecil.
Oh God,

140
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,180
let's say I want to get to,
I want to get to this.

141
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,380
It's definitely should get to it,
but we don't have any problem with even 

142
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,771
vegans will slap a mosquito and it's 
biting them like you don't have a 

143
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:02,771
problem with that.
Not only that,

144
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:05,210
when bugs are really little,
like ants will kill it and then brush it

145
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:10,211
off our pants and leave the body on the 
ground and it's just like a head on our 

146
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:14,641
pants and just some little limbs.
Just crush out the grand bug guts and 

147
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:19,121
then the aunt will be an.
I had a friend do that on my kitchen 

148
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:20,060
once he had an aunt.
I was like,

149
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,930
oh fuck,
fucking aunt.

150
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,580
And he just brushed it on the ground.
I go,

151
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:25,070
isn't that odd that I don't have a 
problem with you doing that,

152
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:30,071
but isn't it odd that we do that?
We just brushed bodies under our 

153
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:30,071
friends' floors and we don't care about 
it.

154
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:32,810
Just this week.
So getting back to Peter Singer,

155
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,190
his whole philosophy of animal 
liberation is sort of that there is a 

156
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,590
hierarchy of consciousness and sentience
that has to be taken into account.

157
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,090
He's,
if he happens to be a Vegan,

158
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,980
but he doesn't think,
you know,

159
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:51,180
I've spoken to him.
Obviously he doesn't think that an 

160
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,760
oyster has the same right to life as a 
lion does or as a chimpanzee does.

161
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:56,480
Right?
So you factor in the capacity of the,

162
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,780
of the creature to be sent to you and to
feel pain and to have a conception of 

163
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,491
itself and to feel love and fear and 
those sorts of things and how much it 

164
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:06,491
does.

165
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:10,340
That's why human life is probably more 
important than any other animal's life.

166
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,520
Maybe whales with dolphins.
So I don't know.

167
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,230
Some other animal.
It's equally smart as us,

168
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,740
but so for him the bugs are less worthy 
and for anyone sensible the bugs out.

169
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,410
Right.
But what's interesting when you say like

170
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:29,210
we have these weird conceptions of our 
own hierarchies of like cute animals and

171
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:32,240
non cute animals or animals that we give
a shit about mammals that we don't.

172
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:38,170
What's interesting is that that 
hierarchy doesn't match up with a Peter 

173
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,730
Singer with a logical ethical hierarchy,
like why are we so willing to be so 

174
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,291
cruel to pigs,
which adjusts as conscious and self 

175
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,840
aware and capable of love and family and
pain as dogs,

176
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,700
if not more so,
if not more so,

177
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,880
but we have these institutionalized 
concentrated animal feeding operations 

178
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,630
that just torture.
I mean it's torture.

179
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,630
I mean,
whatever that industry can do to lower 

180
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,140
the price of a pound of flesh by a few 
pennies,

181
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,320
it will do,
including anesthetizing the pigs,

182
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,500
get grabbing little piglets by the tile 
and just smashing their heads against a 

183
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,620
wall to kill them if they had,
if they're not viable anymore.

184
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,220
I mean it's an absolute murder show.
It's like a.

185
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:20,310
it's an ongoing holocaust of,
of,

186
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,720
of pigs,
but then like little people get arrested

187
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:24,210
for,
I don't know,

188
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,480
Michael Vick or something and you're 
doing something bad for dogs.

189
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,250
We just don't give it.
Give a shit.

190
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,320
So what,
what paid a singer would say is yes,

191
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:32,360
there's a hierarchy,
but let's at least be sensible about the

192
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,780
hierarchy,
which brings us to settle.

193
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:40,100
Cecil Cecil was a 13 year old lion,
which I want everyone to understand that

194
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:43,760
if you're a male lion and you reach 13 
years of age,

195
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:46,310
you have killed a fuck load of baby 
lines.

196
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,080
Sure.
One hundred percent.

197
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,420
How many gazelles have you killed?
Lot of gazelles.

198
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,670
But also there's a lot of,
how do you say,

199
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,430
infanticide,
trust side,

200
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,090
fantasy,
side to

201
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,110
side.
It's not trunk.

202
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,370
I'm always want to make an r there for 
some reason.

203
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,430
Well,
there are some other types of light 

204
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,160
fratricide rise.
I think that's why infanticide,

205
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,560
if that is the correct way of saying 
he's got no wisdom,

206
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:12,780
100 percent.
But I think that is,

207
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:13,370
uh,
that,

208
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,260
that's,
that's an important point to look.

209
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,470
My friend Steve Rinella calls them 
charismatic megafauna and he's like,

210
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:24,471
there's all these animals that are 
charismatic megafauna that we have 

211
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:29,330
anthropomorphized in movies like the 
lion king and Yogi bear and all these 

212
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:33,060
movies and we have this idealized view 
of what they really are.

213
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,130
But the reality of them is so alien to 
us because we're never in Africa,

214
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,070
in Zimbabwe,
in the jungle with these lines.

215
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,850
And if you were,
you'd be absolutely fucking terrified of

216
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,420
them and you wouldn't think of them.
Like I saw Jimmy Kimmel crying on TV.

217
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,050
I was like,
Whoa,

218
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:50,970
Jimmy,
I want to show you some videos.

219
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,180
I'm going to show you some videos of 
Cecil killing babies because apparently 

220
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,720
there's a video of cecil actually 
killing

221
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,850
the actual same lion.
Interesting.

222
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,560
Allegedly,
it might not be him.

223
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,690
It's hard to.
Yeah.

224
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:04,130
And it's also a condescending to the 
people who live there.

225
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,730
Like,
I mean,

226
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:06,200
there are farmers there who were like,
well,

227
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:11,201
yeah,
you're allowed to be little teary about 

228
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:11,201
a lion.
It eats out damn cows all the time.

229
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:11,900
Like,
or like elephants,

230
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:14,120
they just stomping all over our crops.
So yeah,

231
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,740
let's save them.
Absolutely.

232
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,190
But we should have a little bit more 
empathy for the human beings who were 

233
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,190
there to.
Yeah.

234
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,700
Well the human beings.
Here's the other one.

235
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:25,760
The poachers,
the lives of poachers.

236
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,840
Okay.
Now,

237
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:27,530
let's see.

238
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,760
I am not defending this guy.
I don't,

239
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:35,761
I'm not exactly sure what happened.
There are several different versions of 

240
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,180
what that guy did and some of them are,
uh,

241
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,060
according to book.
They're,

242
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,700
they're,
they're,

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
they're fine in legal.
That's not the only line that's ever 

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,430
been killed like this with a collar on 
it.

245
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,100
When the lions are off the preserved 
area,

246
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:49,650
it's legal to kill them.
That's right.

247
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,780
Not saying you should kill them.
Just saying if they're not there,

248
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,250
but here's the,
here's the thing.

249
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:55,960
But they lured him off.
I think that's the difference,

250
00:10:55,961 --> 00:11:00,961
right?
Here's what's legal to kill as much as 

251
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:00,961
you want poachers,
people,

252
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:05,200
they can kill people there every day.
Then when they have these hunting camps,

253
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,900
when they go out looking for lions or 
more,

254
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,720
more often,
it's lions are fairly rare.

255
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,490
Most people,
when they go over there to hunt,

256
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:17,491
they want to hunt something to eat with 
big antlers they could put on their 

257
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:17,491
wall.

258
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:18,880
Yeah,
like a neeland or a gazelle or something

259
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:23,881
along those lines.
When they go to hunt those occasionally 

260
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:25,270
they'll find people that are there and 
they call these people poachers,

261
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,000
and what they are is extremely poor 
people that are.

262
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:30,460
They're shooting these animals without a
permit and you know what they do,

263
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,670
they murder them.
They murdered these people on a regular 

264
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,191
basis.
I have a friend who went over there for 

265
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:38,191
a hunting camp and while he was there,
they,

266
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:39,970
the people that he was with shot a 
poacher,

267
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,020
shot it right in front of them.
There was a man and that man had a,

268
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:45,970
uh,
a gun that was like a,

269
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,280
they have makeshift guns,
they have,

270
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,800
it's an actual gun,
but they don't have real bullets.

271
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,510
So what they do is they create a,
with like a piece of metal,

272
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,350
they find pieces of metal and they get 
some gun powder and they create a firing

273
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,330
pin and they have to light it like a 
musket.

274
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,090
It's crazy.
I mean these are extremely,

275
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,550
extremely poor people.
Not only that,

276
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:09,280
they find their camps and a lot of their
camps,

277
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,580
they'll find evidence of witchcraft.
So they have this white powder that 

278
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:18,400
they'll find these camps and they put 
this white powder on the wrists and they

279
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:21,030
believe this white powder.
It's been blessed by this switch.

280
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:26,031
Doctor makes them invisible.
So this guy was standing out in the 

281
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:28,840
open,
like right next to a tree when the,

282
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,150
the,
the game wardens,

283
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,640
the people that live and work in Africa 
and handle this stuff,

284
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:38,641
shot this guy,
they shot this guy and you know what 

285
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:38,980
they do with them when they shoot them,
they fill out paperwork or they don't.

286
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,990
Sometimes they just feed them to the 
hyenas.

287
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,230
And this happens every day and this 
happens all the time because they have 

288
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,600
these huge hunting preserves,
right?

289
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,690
So these preserves might be 20,
30,

290
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:50,980
40,000
acres,

291
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,270
maybe more enormous.

292
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,930
One of them,
my friend was onset.

293
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,280
It took eight hours to drive from one 
side of the ranch to the other.

294
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,530
So you're talking about an enormous 
piece of land.

295
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,070
And in this enormous beautiful land,
you'll find insanely poor people.

296
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,620
And these insanely poor people have 
nothing.

297
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,300
There's no,
it's dry.

298
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,430
There's no supermarkets,
there's no,

299
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,990
no one,
no government support.

300
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,570
There's no where for them to go.
So what do they do?

301
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:18,571
They,
they take a risk and they go and try to 

302
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:20,230
find animals to kill in these hunting 
preserves and they get shot and they get

303
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,700
killed and no one gives a fuck.

304
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,000
Right.
So the economic,

305
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:28,001
the fund,
the underlying problem here is the 

306
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:28,001
economics.
Exactly.

307
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:28,001
Right.
And there's another,

308
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:28,760
there's a case,
I mean some people say,

309
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,050
well look,
trophy hunting,

310
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:32,600
you may not agree with it,
but the $50,000

311
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,670
per person to spending can then go into 
maintaining a preserve that actually 

312
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,901
protects a whole bunch of of lions.
Now I'm a bit sort of conflicted about 

313
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:44,330
that because there are only a few tens 
of thousands of lines left,

314
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,910
right.
Even even fewer elephants at ink.

315
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,500
So there's some areas,
it depends on Africa.

316
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,710
There's some areas where they have to 
call elephants because they have too 

317
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,710
many of them.

318
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,710
Yeah,
I mean,

319
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,601
I mean that again,
that's because of the encroachment of 

320
00:13:58,601 --> 00:13:58,601
cities and more and more know losing so 
much of their habitat.

321
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:01,070
You might have a lot of elephants in a 
particular small area,

322
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,560
but overall the number is going down 
dramatically across the content.

323
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,380
Yeah.
Well,

324
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,120
I was reading a piece the other day that
was saying that,

325
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,820
you know,
within within 15 or 20 years,

326
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:13,160
it's entirely possible they just won't 
be any African elephants left.

327
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,720
Well before.
So forgive me for anybody who's 

328
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,931
listening to this,
but Louis through has a great 

329
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:21,931
documentary.

330
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:21,980
Yeah,
and I heard him on your show as well.

331
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,450
I'm a huge fan of Louis and I've seen 
that episode a couple of times.

332
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,650
Well,
one of the things that was pointed out 

333
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,031
in that show,
there was a lot of animals that were on 

334
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:34,801
the verge of extinction that are now 
thriving because they live in these 

335
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:36,160
giant hunting camps that's really 
fucked.

336
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,030
You look at it and that's what the guy 
running the hunting camp said,

337
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:40,740
you know,
when,

338
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:42,760
when Louis was kind of confronting him 
about this,

339
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:43,840
he goes,
listen to me,

340
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,960
I have an it guy to clocked.
Yeah,

341
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,430
that's an intense moment.
How incredible.

342
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,710
That guy saying that,
like,

343
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,950
Whoa,
like this.

344
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,070
This guy is like,

345
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,110
he's just at his wits end.

346
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,990
So Ricky Gervais' was coming on facebook
about the,

347
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:59,420
about cecil the lion and the trophy 
hunting and everything.

348
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:03,140
Because he's a big animal rights guy and
he'd super opposed to trophy hunting and

349
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:04,960
he was saying like,
you know,

350
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,180
sure,
maybe this is going to fund something 

351
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,670
better,
but would you allow some asshole to like

352
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,730
shoot a cancer patient if he was willing
to donate a million dollars to cancer 

353
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,220
research?
That's not how.

354
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,270
It's not how it works.
If,

355
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,320
why doesn't the asshole who just donate 
if he thinks he's doing a good deed to 

356
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,450
fail lion conservation,
donate the $50,000

357
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:24,640
and then just don't kill a lion?

358
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,940
Well,
well he's,

359
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,040
he doesn't want that.
He wants to line in his house so he 

360
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,080
could climb on top of it and jerk off to
it

361
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,830
and that's the whole point and I don't 
know what he likes.

362
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,620
Then it comes back to like,
you know Jon Ronson,

363
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:41,860
you've had him on the show.
So you've been publicly shamed.

364
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,050
Guys love that guy.
By the way,

365
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:47,700
Bill Hader does the best John Ronson 
impersonation you've ever heard.

366
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:52,150
I had bill hader and a judd apatow on 
huff post live a couple of weeks ago and

367
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,520
for some reason we were just talking 
about what books they like.

368
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,700
I don't remember how it came up and uh,
and Judd apatow was like,

369
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,820
I'm really into John Ronson and I kinda 
thought that John was my special little 

370
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,300
fetish I think is so great,
you know,

371
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,740
but he's not like an a list writer in 
America at least I don't think that many

372
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:10,900
people know him.
And then Bill Hayden was like,

373
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:15,930
Oh yeah,
I just listened to the audiobook of his 

374
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,850
book and I was like,
I just listened to the audiobook of his 

375
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,191
book and Bill Hader starts going 
brilliant John Ronson infestation.

376
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:28,770
But anyway,
what happened to this guy who shot the 

377
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,871
lion?
Reminds me a bit of what John is always 

378
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:30,871
on about,
about like.

379
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:32,350
So he's had to shatter his dental 
practice.

380
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,680
There's like a sign,
there were signs of abuse all over the 

381
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,620
dental practice.
His big business has ruined.

382
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,260
He's had to go into hiding.
I mean,

383
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,400
is that fair?
Like should you.

384
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,680
Yeah,
he did a shitty thing.

385
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,710
I completely don't agree with,
I don't understand like trophy hunting.

386
00:16:47,711 --> 00:16:49,300
I understand hunting,
hunting for meat,

387
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,850
but I don't understand trophy hunting,
uh,

388
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,970
but we all pile on and we all love being
so self righteous and so sanctimonious 

389
00:16:57,011 --> 00:16:58,840
about it at the same time,
once again,

390
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:03,841
as we're eating all those pigs that have
been tortured and people button into 

391
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:05,440
chicken burgers that have been,
that that's another tortured animal,

392
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,470
but the moment there's something with a 
big fluffy main and it has a cute name 

393
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,870
like [inaudible].
Do you pronounce that name?

394
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:12,430
Cecil in America.
Is that Cecil?

395
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,180
Okay,
cool.

396
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,610
Sessile sounds better.
Yeah,

397
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,500
that's,
it's also like if the,

398
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,560
if the,
if the lion's name was like goth or 

399
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:22,560
something,
I think people would be.

400
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,270
I was upset.
Sessile is the cutest name.

401
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:27,340
No one who's called sessile has ever 
done anything wrong.

402
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:32,340
Wrong.
Cecil though is like a cool black guy 

403
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,910
who hangs around pool halls.
You know,

404
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,040
Cecil can hook you up.
Cecil,

405
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,350
is it that?
Maybe that's where it cut may west.

406
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,000
That's where the pronunciation 
difference comes from.

407
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:41,920
Does it come from African Americans?
That's interesting.

408
00:17:41,921 --> 00:17:42,980
I don't know.
I don't know,

409
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,990
I mean there's a lot of different words 
that they pronounced differently in 

410
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:47,990
England.
Yeah,

411
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,220
that's true.
Yeah,

412
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,070
of course.
And in spelled differently

413
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,070
like tires of the why.
That's always bizarre when I read like 

414
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,380
English auto mail,
auto magazines,

415
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,750
higher t y r e s,
m,

416
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:02,751
I think that the idea of this killing 
this animal for no reason other than you

417
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:07,170
want to kill it because you like killing
things is what freaks everybody out.

418
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,260
The idea that this sociopath could go 
over there and kill these beautiful 

419
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,260
things.
Um,

420
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,010
and that's,
that's what freaks people out.

421
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:19,011
But what's going on right now?
Why this guy did this is people are 

422
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:19,940
killing lions all over Africa.
Like,

423
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,170
here's really fucked up.
This is what's really fucked up.

424
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,200
There was an article that said that 
Jericho,

425
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,830
Cecil's brother had also been killed by 
line and everybody was like,

426
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,960
oh my God,
I can't believe this.

427
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,410
We lost Jericho.
This is crazy because it's Geragos got a

428
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:38,160
name and then they said it was a false 
alarm.

429
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,410
Worry not,
it wasn't Jericho.

430
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,400
It was just some poor

431
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,810
line that doesn't have a name.
And then I'm like,

432
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,470
okay,
this kind of highlights what Rinella was

433
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:49,570
saying.
It's charismatic Megafauna,

434
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:54,571
you give them a name and all of a sudden
there's something significant about 

435
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:54,571
them.
They they are.

436
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:55,840
They have a personality like Simba.
That's right.

437
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,740
That's right.
I had to.

438
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:58,840
So I'm.
I'm out here in La this weekend doing an

439
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:01,540
episode of my new show.
I just launched a podcast,

440
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:06,541
which is a panel of three,
three comics sitting around talking 

441
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,210
about the news each week.
What's it called?

442
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,430
It's called we the people live so people
can get.

443
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,690
You should follow us at a WTP under 
school,

444
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:16,600
live on twitter.
Too much work or you already.

445
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:23,230
You just got off a plane.
I got other people who have like who 

446
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,910
they are,
their brains to your list as a clever 

447
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:26,910
enough,
there'll be able to write it down.

448
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,940
You say that you need to go on my 
twitter and my facebook and read some 

449
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,880
comments on instagram as well.
Or Youtube.

450
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,940
That's the fire pit.
That's the pit of stupidity or or you 

451
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,450
can go to WTP livestock.
There's the other plug plug now,

452
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,860
but it's.
It's great.

453
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,760
It's a lot of fun.
So we had Greg Fitzsimmons on the,

454
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:43,730
on the show last night and uh,
we,

455
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:48,770
we just got a bunch of people together 
in Hollywood and Fred Stoller who was a 

456
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:48,770
writer on Seinfeld.
I don't know if you know,

457
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,810
Fred did a joke about exactly what you 
were just saying about cecil the lion.

458
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,430
He was like,
it's like if someone like had intended,

459
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,500
like someone accidentally shot Bruce 
Willis,

460
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,860
but they thought that we're gonna be 
shooting like Gregory Mcgee and they're 

461
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:04,860
like,
oh fuck,

462
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,710
I didn't realize that I was shooting 
bruce.

463
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:06,670
Well,
I just thought I was going to be killing

464
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:08,410
this other random dude.
You'd still be like,

465
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,820
no,
you'd still murdered a guy.

466
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,470
Right?
It doesn't matter whether it's Jericho.

467
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:15,130
The shit hit the law and a,
the way was culpable.

468
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,730
People were

469
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:21,170
set that Jericho died and now they're 
not upset because it was an unknown 

470
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,041
line.
So no one is calling for the head of 

471
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:25,080
this person that shot this unknown lion.
We're stupid.

472
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,890
We're very stupid,
but we're also ruined by media.

473
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:34,130
I really believe that media depictions 
of animals and when you add human voices

474
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:36,390
to them,
like zookeeper movie that I was in,

475
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,200
you know,
you,

476
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:37,950
you,
you do,

477
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,980
you do fuck with people's reality.
I think we're not designed to take in 

478
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,361
the media.
I really don't believe that the human 

479
00:20:47,361 --> 00:20:49,641
body and brain is designed for films and
I think when we sit down there and we 

480
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:54,130
watched some epic movie with lions,
like there was a movie called bears.

481
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,660
Did you ever see that movie?
Yeah.

482
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,560
That was a nature documentary.
Low was.

483
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,000
It was all over it.
There was another one called cats,

484
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:06,001
right?
That was recent and it was about big 

485
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:08,401
cats.
They don't show what the fuck they 

486
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:08,401
really do.
And the bear documentary,

487
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,280
they didn't show the bears killing cubs 
or bears kill cubs.

488
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:17,281
Like that's what they'd like to eat.
That's one of the reasons why female 

489
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:18,100
bears are so aggressive when they're 
around their,

490
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:18,880
their babies.
Yeah.

491
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:20,830
That's.
It bears the Disney nature.

492
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:21,650
Film bears.
Yeah.

493
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:27,030
They didn't show that male bears come 
out of hibernation and they go looking 

494
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,960
for cubs first things they try to eat.

495
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,230
I mean,
I'm not sure that I buy your thesis that

496
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:36,550
things like animated movies like the 
lion king screw us up,

497
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,580
but I do definitely think that if there 
is something which is a pseudo 

498
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:41,580
documentary like what you're talking 
about,

499
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,780
like or something like one movie that I 
hated,

500
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,370
I couldn't get through more than 20 
minutes of it was march of the penguins.

501
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,910
Hi.
Had opened that about it.

502
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,240
I was angry about it.
Why?

503
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,410
Well,
there was a bunch of it.

504
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:55,010
One of the things that were mating for 
life and I was like,

505
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,040
you know,
that they mate for life and they're 

506
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,040
monogamous.
I'm like,

507
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,040
first of all,
they only meet for a year.

508
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,650
I'm like,
I could do that.

509
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,130
Second of all,
they look exactly the same.

510
00:22:04,131 --> 00:22:09,131
It's not like one penguin is Jenna 
Jameson Pega and the other ones that 

511
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:09,131
rosie o'donnell,
penguin,

512
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:10,070
they're fucking penguins.
What's the point in cheating?

513
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:10,930
Just pretend you're

514
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:15,970
cheat.
It's like as if everyone was just 

515
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:15,970
identical twins,

516
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:15,970
right?
Yeah.

517
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,340
Well it was also,
there was a part of the movie and this 

518
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:20,340
really did happen when I watched it.
Um,

519
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,590
I was watching and there's those leopard
seals that feed off of the penguins that

520
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:28,591
I didn't even know existed.
I didn't even know it was a real animal 

521
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:30,140
until that movie.
And it's this amazing piece of an animal

522
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,760
with these huge teeth.
And I was like,

523
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:32,600
whoa.
I was like,

524
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,240
this is incredible.
This thing's a wow.

525
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,570
And there was a family in front of me 
and this mom was upset at me that I was 

526
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,010
happy when the leopard seal was eating 
the penguins.

527
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:43,530
I'm like,
what about the,

528
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:45,560
with the penguin is fucking slaughtering
these fish.

529
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,500
Like the hierarchy took.
There's a leopard seal right there.

530
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:52,810
Look at the fucking incredible beast of 
what about the leopard sale?

531
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,330
It doesn't need to have a right to live.
Does not mean in all forms.

532
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:58,460
Can we up the star,
which is the penguin

533
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,110
march of a leopard seal,
Josh.

534
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,260
That's what I hated about it.
It was this,

535
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,790
it was a way of,
it was a total anthropomorphization,

536
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,770
if that's a word,
which probably isn't of,

537
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,650
of penguin life.
It's like it's,

538
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,930
it's portraying them as basically humans
in little costumes.

539
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,910
Right?
And it's creating all of these,

540
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,450
I mean clearly made up relation.
It would be like,

541
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:23,451
you know,
you'd see a shot of a penguin walking 

542
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:25,130
away and it would be like I'm young.
Jimbo wandered off with a heavy heart to

543
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:32,571
think about,
to think about how he'd just been 

544
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:35,330
jilted,
but like you have no idea what he's 

545
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:35,330
probably wondering over there to take a 
shit.

546
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,930
I don't know.
Taking this shit is trying to find some 

547
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,761
fish to eat.
He's got three brain cells banging 

548
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:40,761
around inside of stupid little bird 
head.

549
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:40,950
Yeah.
So I think there is a.

550
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,980
I think like companies like Disney 
probably should be held to better 

551
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,860
account to be more responsible about 
communicating to children the reality of

552
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,750
animal life rather than making it all 
sunny.

553
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,010
Don't want their kids to watch.
Like pull up this video.

554
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:56,950
Jamie lion killing cub,
male lion killing cops.

555
00:23:56,951 --> 00:23:59,740
I put this up on twitter and I thought 
twitter took it down.

556
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:05,070
But what actually happened is I 
retweeted somebody else tweeted it and 

557
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,801
the guy who tweeted it got attacked so 
hard that he decided to delete his 

558
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:09,190
tweet.
He's just like,

559
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:10,810
fuck this.
Thanks a lot Joe.

560
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:16,050
It was just too much,
but the reason why he got in trouble is 

561
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,521
because there's line is killing cubs.
It's this is reality and it's not just 

562
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:21,810
an isolated instance.
Like a line.

563
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,240
A screw loose is one on a baby killing 
rampage.

564
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:29,200
This is what they do when a lion takes 
over a pride,

565
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,450
one of the first things he does after he
chases out,

566
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:31,890
go ahead,
play it.

567
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:33,940
Jimmy.
One of the first things he does after he

568
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:37,090
chases out the male line is kill all of 
its babies.

569
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,040
Of course.
And this is what's going on right here.

570
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,080
Genetics.
I mean,

571
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:45,081
I,
I interviewed Richard Dawkins recently 

572
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:47,271
as well,
and I've got another event coming up 

573
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:47,271
with him in,
in October,

574
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:47,271
which is going to be cool.
And He,

575
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:47,970
you know,
he wrote the selfish gene,

576
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,450
meaning like the unit of evolution is 
not the individual and it's not the 

577
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:53,850
species,
it's the gene.

578
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,060
Now that line is killing those cubs 
because what better way to make sure 

579
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,740
that it's genes ended up getting passed 
on and spread out and procreated through

580
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:03,150
the,
the um,

581
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,720
the extended the pride.
There's no better by making sure that 

582
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,630
all of the other babies from the other 
guys

583
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,350
don't go.
I mean,

584
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:12,250
he's just following instincts.
That's why wouldn't you.

585
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,660
This is part of the picture,
and again,

586
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,360
I'm not in favor of killing lions and 
people say,

587
00:25:18,361 --> 00:25:20,820
this is cecil by the way.
I don't know if that's true.

588
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,810
I mean how it,
you know,

589
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,950
I don't,
I don't know,

590
00:25:22,951 --> 00:25:25,080
but they.
Cecil has been studied.

591
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,120
I mean these are part of an Oxford study
or was.

592
00:25:27,121 --> 00:25:27,600
Yeah,
yeah.

593
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,650
I interviewed the,
the actually the head of that study,

594
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:34,730
the Oxford Guy.
Fascinating stuff that looks different 

595
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,001
because he's younger in this video and 
apparently when they get older they get 

596
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:38,550
the black around their main.
I don't know if that's true,

597
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,780
but,
but bottom line is this is also part of 

598
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,580
the picture,
so by showing only the beautiful aspects

599
00:25:44,581 --> 00:25:49,581
of the line with flowing main walking 
amongst the cubs that are his and the 

600
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:53,010
female lionesses.
You don't see the actual whole animal.

601
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:58,011
You don't see the thing.
You also don't see the reality of the 

602
00:25:58,011 --> 00:26:00,801
poaching and what these people go 
through that lived there and they and 

603
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:04,540
then it's easy for these hunting wardens
to murder those people that are trying 

604
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,990
to survive today is so much more 
disturbing.

605
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,790
Yeah,
but then there's this big question.

606
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:09,690
I mean,
so there's the.

607
00:26:09,691 --> 00:26:14,691
There's the ethics of actually taking 
the lives of these animals and the 

608
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:16,020
hypocrisy of loving dogs,
but not pigs and of eating chicken,

609
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:18,060
but then going crazy about cecil the 
lion,

610
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:23,300
but then at the end of the day,
I always come back to the fundamental 

611
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,450
fact that we are living through one of 
the greatest extinction events in 

612
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:32,541
history that's been unleashed by humans.
If in 50 years time we don't want to 

613
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:37,500
live in a world that has no lines,
has no African elephants,

614
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,860
has totally polluted overfished waters 
where you kind of eat tuna anymore 

615
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,340
because there's so much mercury

616
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,340
in it.
Like we've got to find ways of dealing 

617
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,660
with this and if the poachers are part 
of that problem.

618
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,640
I'm not saying you put a bullet in the 
head,

619
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,760
but you got to do something.
See with approaches that are getting 

620
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,131
killed in Africa though most,
I mean there's different types of 

621
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:04,041
poachers.
There's poachers in Africa that are 

622
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:04,041
killing elephants for their ivory and 
it's.

623
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,330
This is the most unbelievably brutal 
aspect of it.

624
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,480
When poachers kill elephants for their 
ivory,

625
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,600
the amount of ivory that they get,
they get like four or five elephants 

626
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:14,950
that they kill.
I think they they.

627
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,360
There was a big story a few days ago 
where they killed five elephants and 

628
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:20,990
they,
they just chop off their tusks and leave

629
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,990
there.
The bodies to rot.

630
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,500
They got like $200 for those tusks and 
those tests on the black market are 

631
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:31,650
worth tens of thousands of dollars,
but that's fucking crazy.

632
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,650
I mean this is not hearing,
but you're also talking about people 

633
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,860
that are just so fucking desperate.
We can't even understand the pint,

634
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,980
but there are a lot of desperate people 
are a lot of desperate people born 

635
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,580
desperate.
They're stuck.

636
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:45,150
There's,
I mean,

637
00:27:45,151 --> 00:27:47,340
if you're in that environment.
I have a friend,

638
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:50,310
his name is Justin wren and he.
He'll be on the podcast soon again.

639
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:51,840
He's been on a few times.
He was,

640
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,660
he still was an mma fighter,
but he went over there.

641
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,720
I'm on a trip and met some pygmies in 
the Congo and fell in love and just was 

642
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,491
like,
I need to help these people and we've 

643
00:28:04,491 --> 00:28:04,491
been donating money and they've been 
building wells.

644
00:28:04,491 --> 00:28:05,870
They've built 16 wells for these people.
They're.

645
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:11,040
They're bringing in medical supplies and
doing all these things to try to help 

646
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,040
these people,
but his.

647
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,330
The feeling that he got when he was 
there,

648
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:14,370
it's like there's no one helping these 
folks.

649
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,530
They asked to do anything they can to 
survive.

650
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,400
These people that are on these hunting 
preserves that they're calling poachers,

651
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,890
a lot of them are just trying to feed 
themselves.

652
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,810
They're just.
There's no where to go.

653
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,960
There's nothing.
There's no options and it's legal to 

654
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
kill those people and then the idea that
it's someone legal,

655
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,660
it is legal in Africa to kill these 
people.

656
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:33,970
It's not legal.
It's legal.

657
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:34,980
Yes it is.
It might.

658
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,500
They might turn a blind eye to it.
It's always.

659
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,170
It's always illegal to kill them.
I'm telling you,

660
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:45,690
it's not really.
It's not in Africa.

661
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,930
A poacher.
You can shoot a poacher when they are on

662
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:52,230
your property and it's legal,
you fill out paperwork and you're done.

663
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,770
And it not only that,
but he was being done by what they call,

664
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,610
they call them professional hunters,
but they're essentially game wardens.

665
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,300
So like if you were um,
you know,

666
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:05,430
uh,
if you were in Montana,

667
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,110
oh,
you were elk hunting and you,

668
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,050
when you shoot an animal you have to 
have a tag for it,

669
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,080
which means in Indian state allows 
shooting tiger poachers on site offers 

670
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:16,500
money to informants.
Yeah.

671
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,020
India in India,
right?

672
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,360
Yeah.
But yeah,

673
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:22,590
but it's the same thing.
It's not,

674
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:26,580
it's not uncommon to be for it to be 
legal to shoot poachers,

675
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,880
but that's because they're down to only 
like a few thousand lines or a few 

676
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,380
thousand times.
In ancient India it might be even less 

677
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,481
than thousands.
It might be like hundreds of of tigers 

678
00:29:38,481 --> 00:29:41,691
in India.
But point being it's not just legal like

679
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,530
it's done every day.
Everyday.

680
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:49,710
Africa is so big.
This is the other thing that people 

681
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:49,710
need.
We,

682
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:53,600
we have this perception,
our head that Africa is something like 

683
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,130
America,
you know,

684
00:29:54,131 --> 00:29:56,110
well we know what life is like in 
America,

685
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:58,570
so we expect life is like that in 
Africa.

686
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,230
So if these people are over there in 
Africa and they're shooting lions,

687
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:07,231
these are terrible people.
We the same sanely hard place to live.

688
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,150
Insanely awful place.
You have a lot of ways,

689
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,120
many,
many parts.

690
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:16,420
I think people know that.
I don't think people have any illusions 

691
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,851
about what Africa is like.
The only time we see Africa on the news 

692
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:20,060
is when some horrible,
horrible shit goes down.

693
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:21,650
Or when Bono is playing some,
some,

694
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,230
some charity concert to raise money for 
them.

695
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:29,231
I think if anything,
I mean I've got friends who live in 

696
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:29,231
Nairobi and there are lots of things 
going.

697
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:31,520
I mean the bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation is doing all kinds of stuff.

698
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,500
There are lots of,
there's lots of entrepreneurship.

699
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,460
Cell phones have have revolutionized the
continent because all of a sudden people

700
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:40,400
are able to like send a text message to 
the market that's three,

701
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:42,950
a three hour walk away and ask what,
what price?

702
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:48,130
You know,
fish or rice or getting that day and 

703
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:48,130
they can actually plan instead of just 
guessing like there.

704
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,070
There are a lot of good news stories in 
Africa.

705
00:30:49,071 --> 00:30:54,071
I'm not downplaying how terrible it is,
but the idea that the only way that you 

706
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:57,761
can survive on the continent of Africa 
is by poaching is by being an ivory 

707
00:30:57,761 --> 00:30:57,830
poachers.
Come on.

708
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,980
These are the people who are saying food
poachers.

709
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,980
These people,
these were that are getting shot in 

710
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,971
these game preserves.
A lot of them are just hunting gazelles 

711
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:07,971
or something along those lines.
Right?

712
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:08,330
Just hunting for food.
They have nothing.

713
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,740
Mom,
what I'm saying is I know all these 

714
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:13,740
stories.
I'm aware of all these stories.

715
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,961
I read them all the time,
but I think unless you have feet on the 

716
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:19,211
ground in Africa,
unless you actually go there and 

717
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,371
experience it firsthand.
Everybody that I've talked to that's 

718
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:21,920
been there,
so it is another world.

719
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,090
You might as well be on the mobile with 
the Moon,

720
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,690
the moon.
You can be on the phone as well on that.

721
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,960
I think I know the information,
but I think I haven't internalized it 

722
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,780
and that's what happened to my friend 
Justin when he went there,

723
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,580
he just just like,
Jesus Christ,

724
00:31:37,581 --> 00:31:40,940
I got to do something and he was just 
struck with it because I don't,

725
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,430
I don't think.
I think don't think it gets in.

726
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,040
I think the information hits the brain.
It stores it,

727
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,210
you know,
one plus one is two.

728
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:50,330
It's like it's all there,
but unless you were there,

729
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,160
I don't think you could truly understand
what,

730
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,450
what that place is like.

731
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,840
Yeah.
But I think that's probably true and 

732
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:58,840
we're also so caught up in,
in our own little worlds.

733
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,491
I mean especially in this country 
because America is so big and it's so 

734
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:06,941
easy to,
to maintain just live inside of the 

735
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:07,510
American cultural bubble essentially 
that it's not,

736
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,520
it's you have to actively proactively 
try to seek out other sources of 

737
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,821
information and other experiences.
Otherwise it's very easy to just coast 

738
00:32:15,821 --> 00:32:16,970
along here and not really think about 
the rest of the world.

739
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:22,050
It's also kind of ironic that the last 
big lion story that came out of Africa 

740
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,210
was the editor from the game of thrones.
It got pulled out of her car by a lion.

741
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,340
She was taking a photograph of it and 
the lion was like,

742
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,750
Ooh,
I think that's an open window.

743
00:32:28,751 --> 00:32:33,751
Just dove into the car and literally 
pulled her out in front of her friends 

744
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:37,111
and they're all screaming and the lion 
killed her right in front of everybody 

745
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:39,010
and that's what they do.
They're fucking killers.

746
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,160
They're nature's cleanup crew.

747
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:45,350
Anything with a limp,
anything that looks like it's easy to 

748
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,350
take out,
you know,

749
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,700
the thing that they didn't even eat her,
they just killed her.

750
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,090
It was killer for a goof.
Tied over,

751
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,940
taking pictures.

752
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:55,020
It's like shocks like to just say the 
aussie surfer that was crazy and 

753
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,560
attacked by a great white and like the,
the whole point like.

754
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,640
So sharks don't like what we taste like 
right when they're to after big fatty 

755
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,100
seals,
they don't like scrawny humans.

756
00:33:03,101 --> 00:33:08,101
We're all bound in sin you.
And so they'll just take a bite to see 

757
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:08,800
if they like us and then they'll spit us
out.

758
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:13,830
But if it's a nine foot great white,
then that little taste is enough to kill

759
00:33:13,961 --> 00:33:17,380
you if they rip off your leg or a torso.
So I've always felt like,

760
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:22,381
especially as an Australian,
were that this was constantly just in 

761
00:33:22,381 --> 00:33:22,381
the background of your mind as a 
possibility if we.

762
00:33:22,381 --> 00:33:27,300
Because we're always at the beach,
like I would prefer it if they actually 

763
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,321
liked us.
So at least one of us is happy and it's 

764
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:33,340
just the ignominy of Bay of both being 
killed.

765
00:33:33,341 --> 00:33:35,440
And then also the shock being like,
Eh,

766
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,660
I didn't even like it.
Fuck you sean.

767
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,770
Well they,
they are the ultimate cleanup crew.

768
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,100
They're just dead behind the eyes.
Black Marbles for eyeballs.

769
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:45,470
Love Him.
I was like a shock nerd as a kid.

770
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,890
Books about sharks and would always.
Yeah,

771
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,820
because I don't really go in there.
I don't,

772
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,880
I don't surf.
But apparently surfing in South Africa 

773
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,720
is like fucking jogging.
Were lions live is.

774
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,270
Yeah,
South Africa and South Australia.

775
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,840
Both at the bottom of that,
because great whites like you know,

776
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,870
cool is and that's just where you find 
them,

777
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:08,420
so fuck that.
Fuck,

778
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,230
fuck,
fuck,

779
00:34:09,231 --> 00:34:11,870
fuck that.
Apparently they're finding a lot of them

780
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:16,871
off the Malibu coast right there.
Seeing them on a regular basis and some 

781
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:19,010
reason north in northern San Francisco,
that area,

782
00:34:19,011 --> 00:34:21,380
they breed out there.
I have a buddy,

783
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,470
my friend Alex Ross who runs a shark 
works,

784
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,060
which is actually a porsche,
a man like,

785
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:28,940
uh,
the,

786
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:33,950
uh,
take Porsche's and modify them and he 

787
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:33,950
calls it.

788
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,810
That's the name of his company.
Shark is a shark fan.

789
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:36,380
He's a freak.
He told me there's like,

790
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:36,830
they,
they,

791
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:38,090
they breed out there,
right?

792
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,130
Like in northern somewhere.
Yeah.

793
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:42,650
But like what the fuck man.
Like right there,

794
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,700
he's got a damn monster.
That's a good thing to what is called 

795
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,961
side.
There aren't that many people swimming 

796
00:34:49,961 --> 00:34:51,491
in San Francisco Bay.
There's a video of them taking a 

797
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:54,611
surfboard and pulling it behind a boat 
in South Africa just to show there's 

798
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:56,540
this one area that's just overrun with 
sharks.

799
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,210
And as they pull this surfboard behind 
the boat,

800
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,210
these sharks just,
Pam just hitting the surfboard,

801
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,770
knocking it up in the air.
And you're like,

802
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,330
what?
They're amazing.

803
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,780
Who wouldn't love him?
It's like a lion sale.

804
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,700
Like I love him.
Maybe that girl who lost her arm,

805
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:13,550
she'd probably wouldn't be really too 
much into them.

806
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:13,940
Did,

807
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,470
did.
Uh,

808
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,920
did you see this,
this petition that they've got just a.

809
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:22,030
This is from left field,
but it just popped into my head and I 

810
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,120
don't know why about the 19 year old kid
who,

811
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:28,121
um,
who had sex with a 17 year old girl who 

812
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:30,671
had told him when she was 14 and she 
told him she was 17 and now he and so he

813
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:36,251
went to jail and now he's on the sex 
offender registry for 25 years and he's 

814
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:41,441
not going to be able to have a career 
because he wanted to do software 

815
00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:41,441
engineering.
And as part of his parole,

816
00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:45,621
he's not allowed to own a computer.
He's not allowed to own a smartphone 

817
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:49,020
because he's classified as a pedophile.
Even though she was physically mature.

818
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,610
He thought she was 17.
Her parents lobbied the judge and Sheila

819
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:56,700
with the to plead and say please let 
this guy off,

820
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,150
but he,
but instead the judge threw,

821
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,710
threw the book at him basically saying 
like,

822
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:06,770
you should understand that sex is 
supposed to be a meaningful and like 

823
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,150
holy experience between two people who 
love each other.

824
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,580
You shouldn't be hooking up online like 
this.

825
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,420
What?
Yeah.

826
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,610
Where was it moralizing?
Uh,

827
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:17,400
it was in.
Can we check that is either.

828
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,010
It was in the midwest somewhere,
I think Indiana.

829
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,220
So now there's like 150,000
signatures on this petition to try to 

830
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:25,560
get this guy off the sex offender 
registry.

831
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:30,710
You can be on the,
there are people in the sex offender 

832
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:30,710
registry who does urinated in public.
I know again now.

833
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,740
Yeah,
I know a guy did that.

834
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:33,720
He's a pro pool player.
Apparently that's a story.

835
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:38,721
At least he went outside and he took a 
leak outside of this bar and apparently 

836
00:36:38,721 --> 00:36:43,461
it's close to a school and because he's 
within x amount of feet of a school he 

837
00:36:43,461 --> 00:36:44,640
got,
he got caught by the cops and they,

838
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,740
he's a sex offender for exposing 
himself.

839
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,080
Yeah.
Yeah,

840
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,000
like what?
Hear I hear,

841
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,730
here's the stats.
I was looking at this yesterday.

842
00:36:52,731 --> 00:36:56,210
So in six states you can get on the 
register if you hire a hooker.

843
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,490
Wow.
In,

844
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:03,590
uh,
in at least a dozen states already 

845
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:03,590
segregating and hookah,
hookah,

846
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:08,850
hooker,
it sounds like cheery nestled debbie.

847
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,540
Uh,
and in,

848
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:15,170
uh,
oh yeah.

849
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:15,620
Here it is.

850
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,560
To be a monster debate.
Rages over man.

851
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:22,561
Nineteen.
Put on sex offender registry for 25 

852
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:22,561
years.
Zach Anderson Nineteen.

853
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:26,641
Met a girl online via hookup APP,
a hot or not last year on the APP.

854
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:29,140
Girl says she's 17,
however she is actually 14.

855
00:37:29,141 --> 00:37:32,890
Zack traveled 20 miles from Indiana home
to Michigan and slept with her.

856
00:37:32,891 --> 00:37:35,950
He was arrested at the girl's mom.
Became worried about her whereabouts.

857
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,070
Um,
whatever this uh,

858
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:43,080
this petition is Jamie,
find out where it is and let's give it 

859
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,080
out online and fill it out.

860
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,560
Hopefully that's a change.org
thing or something.

861
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,560
I signed it.
I mean,

862
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,880
this poor guy.

863
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,990
He's just a kid,
man.

864
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,370
When you're 19,
first of all,

865
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,810
it's so hard to tell the difference 
between a 14 and a 17 year old.

866
00:37:53,811 --> 00:37:58,811
It's so hard.
How do you know there's girls that are 

867
00:37:58,811 --> 00:37:58,811
14 that looked like they're 18.
You got to.

868
00:37:58,811 --> 00:37:59,750
We all know that.
Yeah.

869
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:00,360
Look,
I,

870
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,800
I met a girl who was 25 who looked like 
she was fucking 16.

871
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:08,660
People vary wildly in,
in their appearance and if you're 19 you

872
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,030
don't have a whole lot of experience in 
judging that shit.

873
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:11,960
No,
that's right.

874
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:16,350
It's not like he fucking got her drunk 
or drugged her or any of that like this.

875
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,890
Is that the judge,
first of all,

876
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:21,350
they should take him and drag him in the
same place.

877
00:38:21,351 --> 00:38:26,351
They dragged that fucking surfboard.
Just take him and feed them to the 

878
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:26,351
sharks.

879
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:29,010
Dan Savage has been going on a lot about
this status to say because he liked that

880
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:29,520
guy.
Yeah,

881
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:33,240
he's great.
He's been on a couple of times and he's.

882
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,800
I mean his.
His point is like,

883
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,980
what the hell?
What

884
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,040
the hell legal rationale is there for 
saying that sex is supposed to be this 

885
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:46,351
meaningful thing between two people who 
love each other and so you shouldn't be 

886
00:38:46,351 --> 00:38:46,351
using hot or not.
Yeah.

887
00:38:46,351 --> 00:38:47,500
It says,
who says the old judge?

888
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,090
And the prosecutor on that job,
the,

889
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:51,940
when he was getting laid,
there was no hot or not.

890
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:57,360
He wasn't getting the ladies and we 
probably mad that he lost his virginity 

891
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:57,900
at 42 probably fucker.
Yeah.

892
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,140
Or never has maybe switch that robe on 
me.

893
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:06,330
One judge that got caught,
it was had some sort of a masturbation 

894
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:06,480
device underneath the robe.
A condom.

895
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

896
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,450
They caught him in the middle of his 
proceedings.

897
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,630
She had some like fucking pump on his 
dick.

898
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,970
Crazy assholes.
That's great.

899
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:20,971
I'm wearing one right now.
That's why I'm having such a good time 

900
00:39:20,971 --> 00:39:20,971
to.
I don't mind that I.

901
00:39:20,971 --> 00:39:20,971
I welcome that here.

902
00:39:20,971 --> 00:39:23,590
But this guy is a judge.
Okay.

903
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:28,591
He supposed to follow the law.
We don't want his editorial comment on 

904
00:39:28,591 --> 00:39:29,580
the nature of civilization and whether 
or not people shouldn't,

905
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,020
shouldn't enjoy sex recreationally.
That's true.

906
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:33,790
Because that's what he's saying,
that it's got nothing to do with,

907
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,820
with the offense at hand.
I think anytime a judge says something 

908
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:38,820
like that,
you should it like,

909
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,781
fuck you.
You're not a judge anymore because 

910
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:42,781
you've obviously lost your,
your,

911
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,320
your balance.
You've lost your,

912
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,260
your perspective.
That's not what we want from you.

913
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,150
We want for you to be an expert in the 
law as it's written in the law,

914
00:39:52,151 --> 00:39:57,151
as it's written,
as opposed to protect people not 

915
00:39:57,151 --> 00:39:57,151
protecting anybody here.
Well,

916
00:39:57,151 --> 00:40:00,931
let's try it and the whole point of the 
sex offender registry and that kind of 

917
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,220
stuff is to protect kids and parents 
from predatory,

918
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,460
potentially violent,
repeat child rapists.

919
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,800
Right?
I mean that's ideally what that offender

920
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:10,660
registry should do.
Hat who,

921
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,990
what kids is it protecting?
Prosecute this 19 year old.

922
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:19,170
Does anyone seriously believe that if he
has a smart phone at any point in the 

923
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:22,471
next 25 years or whatever it is,
that he's going to be like preying upon 

924
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:24,070
multiple 14 year old girls who look like
this?

925
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:25,060
17.
Come on.

926
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,830
The whole thing's disgusting.
It's just,

927
00:40:26,831 --> 00:40:29,710
it's just madness that someone thinks 
that they could do that.

928
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:34,740
I have.
I have a theory about that and I've 

929
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,631
talked about it on the show before that 
I think that one of the main problems 

930
00:40:36,631 --> 00:40:39,751
that we have with law enforcement and 
with police and even with judge and 

931
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:41,620
prosecutors,
is that it becomes a game.

932
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,040
It becomes a win or lose if the guy gets
off,

933
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:47,020
you lost.
If the guy,

934
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:52,050
if you convict him,
you scored and I think we have this 

935
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,600
built in thing about playing games and I
saw,

936
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:58,650
I think it fits very keenly into that 
dynamic that we have about winning and 

937
00:40:58,871 --> 00:41:03,460
losing and I think that's why cops can 
find some sort of a justification for,

938
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,270
for leaving evidence,
for planting evidence.

939
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:12,360
Like that guy was shot the guy in North 
Carolina and drops the Taser and 

940
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,260
remember that we shot the guy in the 
back and then drops the Taser out his 

941
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:16,260
body.
Like in the POC.

942
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:16,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

943
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,090
I think there's a lot of that where 
it's,

944
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,020
they get locked into this trying to win 
thing and some people with cheap,

945
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,710
like people playing pool to like move a 
ball when you're not looking to cheat.

946
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:31,860
Why?
Because they want to win his petty 

947
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:31,860
playing pool.
Yes.

948
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,800
But when you're trying,
when you're a cop,

949
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,070
you also have a

950
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,120
quota.
You know,

951
00:41:35,121 --> 00:41:39,980
I had this guy on Michael Wood who's a 
former police officer in Baltimore,

952
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,340
who's enlightening means to how fucked 
up Baltimore is.

953
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:46,310
And how fucked up to police department 
is and how crazy it is over there.

954
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:51,311
But he was like,
you get in trouble if you're not 

955
00:41:51,311 --> 00:41:52,280
arresting people,
so if no one commits crimes,

956
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:57,370
you're fucked.
You're fucked as a cop because they're 

957
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:57,370
like,
that's bullshit.

958
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,030
These people suck.
Like it can't be that it ever.

959
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,920
It ever cleans up.
It can't be like,

960
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:01,610
hey,
you know what,

961
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:07,090
I'm Baltimore just became Beverly Hills 
and everyone is like this nice old rich 

962
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:10,240
Jewish couple that doesn't do anything 
wrong and no one knowing commits crimes.

963
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:10,900
So we could just,
uh,

964
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:15,910
relax you like to fire department,
sit around and wait for something to 

965
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,560
happen instead of being forced.
Like if the fire department had quotas,

966
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,060
how many fires you put out today,
Wilson,

967
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:23,030
there was no fire.
They'd be going around fighting fires.

968
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:25,070
Exactly right.

969
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,050
That's a good point.
Right?

970
00:42:26,051 --> 00:42:31,051
So there's a misalignment of incentives 
basically because the people who are 

971
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:35,161
supposed to be doing the cracking down 
on crime actually have an incentive for 

972
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:37,720
there still to continue to be some crime
so they can keep doing the cracking down

973
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:43,210
almost reminds me a little bit of the 
military industrial complex where like 

974
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,980
the Pentagon,
the Defense Department is supposed to be

975
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:49,981
about defending us,
but if we don't have wars to go into 

976
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:51,100
then they're kind of redundant.
Exactly.

977
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:54,640
It's actually good for them when there 
is a war ironically.

978
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,880
But you would expect that the people who
are like who are trying to seek our 

979
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,370
security would not be one in wars 
because wars are bad things.

980
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,680
Yeah.
I think the overall dynamic of how we 

981
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,951
operate is flawed fundamentally on so 
many different levels that we just sort 

982
00:43:11,951 --> 00:43:16,691
of try to patch it up and keep moving.
And I think you could make an analogy 

983
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:20,291
about this hunting thing.
I mean it is kind of fucked that you're 

984
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:22,961
talking about conservation when the best
way to conserve is to get money from 

985
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:23,780
them being murdered.
I mean that,

986
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:28,781
that's really what you're saying.
The best way is to go over there and 

987
00:43:28,781 --> 00:43:33,190
there was an article in huff post 
actually today that I was reading and I 

988
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:37,721
was kind of laughing about it because it
was wrong on a lot of different levels 

989
00:43:37,721 --> 00:43:41,720
and it was about hunting for 
conservation and that this model doesn't

990
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:45,830
really work or the argument doesn't hold
up and one of the things they brought up

991
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:50,831
was that $335,000
that that guy had paid to go and shoot 

992
00:43:50,831 --> 00:43:53,960
that Rhino and what that Rhino,
what they were saying,

993
00:43:53,961 --> 00:43:56,210
well if this rhinos and danger,
these rhinos are endangered,

994
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,770
yes,
but that rhino was an unviable male.

995
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:02,030
Like he was old and he wasn't breathing 
anymore.

996
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:07,060
Not only that,
he was killing young male rhinos and 

997
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,730
female rhinos and so they had targeted 
him for.

998
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:09,890
They were going to call him.
They were going to kill him anyway.

999
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:13,250
So the reason why this guy was able to 
spend so much money,

1000
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,280
shoot this endangered rhino,
it's because they were gonna shoot it 

1001
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:18,280
anyway.
And they said,

1002
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,511
look,
if we can generate a tremendous amount 

1003
00:44:22,511 --> 00:44:22,511
of income,
and he.

1004
00:44:22,511 --> 00:44:25,271
I had him on the podcast and he said the
amount of money that he paid was 

1005
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:28,871
actually small and the reason why it was
small was that all the negative 

1006
00:44:28,871 --> 00:44:33,341
publicity actually fucked up the 
conservation aspect of it because there 

1007
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:35,670
are people that would pay half a million
even more for that Rhino.

1008
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,880
And they didn't because they were scared
of being having their name thrown into 

1009
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:40,880
the pool.

1010
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,740
So this cory Knowlton guy went over 
there and spent the $335,000,

1011
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:48,741
did everything legally,
and he was in a lot of ways just like 

1012
00:44:48,741 --> 00:44:50,460
cecil or just like this Walter Hill 
guys,

1013
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,620
Cecil.
So that.

1014
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,840
Then that brings us back to like the 
social justice,

1015
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,530
like twitter storm thing,
right?

1016
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:01,780
That you're actually,
you're ending up with an inferior 

1017
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,371
outcome to the outcome that you could 
potentially have because the people who 

1018
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:07,641
could pull off the best outcome,
so afraid of us old jumping down their 

1019
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:09,060
throats on twitter and ruining their 
lives,

1020
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,630
getting them into a justine sacco.
But then it also gets to like,

1021
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:15,150
Whoa,
is that really the only way you can save

1022
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:17,770
these rhinos?
The only way you can get $335,000

1023
00:45:17,771 --> 00:45:22,771
and you have to have someone,
you have to get some guy who wants to 

1024
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:22,771
kill one and say,
okay,

1025
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,480
you like killing shit,
alright how much some of our docs,

1026
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,010
but what else?

1027
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,340
Who else is going to pay $350,000
to save rhinos?

1028
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:33,290
I think this is the way if people hate 
this idea of hunting for,

1029
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,330
for conservation,
if they hate this idea,

1030
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:40,360
the best way to stop it is to really 
ramp up conservation as efforts to 

1031
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:45,680
really,
really ramp up the idea of non hunting 

1032
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,920
for conservation and to tell people 
like,

1033
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:47,400
look,
we can.

1034
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:51,870
You can generate like Zimbabwe 
apparently where this guy was,

1035
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,450
they generate some insane amount of 
money.

1036
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,460
I don't want to quote it because I don't
know if I'm right,

1037
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:01,020
but I read various amounts,
but I think it was like $200,000,000

1038
00:46:01,021 --> 00:46:04,710
a year just from hunting just from these
people coming over there to hunt.

1039
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,640
And someone said,
well,

1040
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:08,460
that's the only three percent of it goes
to conservation.

1041
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:13,580
That's probably right,
but it's still three percent of 

1042
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,730
$200,000,000
or whatever the fuck it is.

1043
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,880
That's a lot of goddamn money for people
who have nothing over there.

1044
00:46:17,881 --> 00:46:19,410
How much could they make from tourism 
though,

1045
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,210
for people that are looking at the 
lions?

1046
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,500
That's a good question.
Um,

1047
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:27,660
and that's,
I think maybe the solution in a lot of 

1048
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,741
these situations.
But also another thing that has to be 

1049
00:46:30,741 --> 00:46:31,710
carefully considered is that at least in
some areas,

1050
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:36,711
in some places you have to manage 
populations of animals because if you 

1051
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,750
just leave nature onto its own nature 
will wipe out animals as well.

1052
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,960
Nature doesn't really give a fuck about,
like wolves don't care if they wipe out 

1053
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,590
all the elk really don't care.
They don't have it in their mind.

1054
00:46:46,591 --> 00:46:49,140
They have it in their mind.
What can I kill and eat?

1055
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:52,320
Whether it's dogs or whether it's elk or
whatever.

1056
00:46:52,321 --> 00:46:55,400
It can track down and kill.
So you,

1057
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:58,590
the United States has a problem and a 
lot of the western states,

1058
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:02,520
because they reintroduced wolves and 
they reintroduced wolves and there was a

1059
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:07,521
really interesting video about it,
how wolves are changing yellowstone 

1060
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:07,610
national park and they sort of 
highlighted the,

1061
00:47:07,611 --> 00:47:12,611
the positive aspects of it,
the negative aspects of it or the elk 

1062
00:47:12,611 --> 00:47:15,330
population are getting decimated because
these elk are not used to wolves because

1063
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:20,331
they didn't develop with wolves and the 
wolves are within the last few 

1064
00:47:20,331 --> 00:47:20,331
generations.

1065
00:47:20,331 --> 00:47:24,050
These wolves have been introduced here 
and they wanted to keep them within a 

1066
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,991
certain population.
They wanted to keep them within a few 

1067
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:26,991
thousand wools and the whole country.
Well,

1068
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:27,450
they've gone way,
way,

1069
00:47:27,451 --> 00:47:32,451
way past that and so now they want to 
start hunting these wolves and they do 

1070
00:47:32,451 --> 00:47:36,421
hunt these wolves in some areas,
but they have all these people that are 

1071
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:36,421
freaking out about the hunting of the 
wolves.

1072
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:37,990
So you shouldn't hunt these walls,
but you have to.

1073
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:43,140
You don't like you.
You have to manage these populations 

1074
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:43,140
because if you don't,
then you have starvation.

1075
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,290
Then you have a disease and then you 
have them encroaching into livestock.

1076
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,050
I have a friend who lives in northern 
BC,

1077
00:47:50,051 --> 00:47:52,810
British Columbia,
and he is a hunter up there,

1078
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,840
and he also has cows.
His neighbor's cow was killed in the 

1079
00:47:59,050 --> 00:47:59,680
middle of the night by a pack of wolves.
He said,

1080
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:04,681
you don't even know what terror is and 
when you're sleeping your house with 

1081
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:05,170
your children,
and he said,

1082
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:08,110
you have glass windows that protect you 
from the wild,

1083
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:08,500
right?

1084
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:13,500
You're not living in a fortress,
you're living in a normal house and you 

1085
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,100
look out the window and you see 20,
30,

1086
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:20,130
wild savage,
murderous wolves tearing a cow apart in 

1087
00:48:20,741 --> 00:48:25,741
front of you screaming and cheering and 
ripping this thing apart,

1088
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,410
and they'll do that to your kid.
Do that to you.

1089
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,210
They'll do that to anything they can get
ahold of.

1090
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:35,170
They don't have morals there.
Their idea is to stay alive.

1091
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:40,171
That is their programming there,
and if you don't manage their 

1092
00:48:40,171 --> 00:48:40,171
population,
you're fucked.

1093
00:48:40,171 --> 00:48:42,190
So in that area,
you can kill as many wives as you want.

1094
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:42,420
Right?
Right,

1095
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,760
right.
Where he lives.

1096
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,900
I mean,
kill them every day.

1097
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:47,450
It all comes back to this misconception 
that people have,

1098
00:48:47,451 --> 00:48:50,390
that,
that nature is at a,

1099
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:53,240
at a permanent state of equilibrium,
and the,

1100
00:48:53,241 --> 00:48:55,760
we shouldn't tinker with it because 
there's some,

1101
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,550
some,
something kind of fundamentally precious

1102
00:48:58,551 --> 00:49:00,920
about a particular state of,
of nature,

1103
00:49:00,921 --> 00:49:05,921
but the reality is almost all states of 
nature in the world right now have been 

1104
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:07,340
impacted by human civilization already.
So as you say,

1105
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:12,341
like the wolves,
the reason why we have to reintroduce 

1106
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:12,341
the wolves because we killed them in the
first place.

1107
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:17,051
And the relationship between the number 
of elk in the number of wolves is 

1108
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:17,600
already out of whack.
So we need to be able to manage it.

1109
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:22,601
It reminds me a bit.
I was talking to a marine biologist I 

1110
00:49:22,601 --> 00:49:26,291
think obviously in Tanga will fly specks
South Pacific nation talking to this guy

1111
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:28,190
about whaling.

1112
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:31,710
And I was talking about how opposed I am
to wailing.

1113
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:33,020
I don't think we should be killing 
whales.

1114
00:49:33,021 --> 00:49:34,370
And he was like,
you know what?

1115
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:38,590
Because we already have killed so many 
blue whales and humpback whales will.

1116
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:42,370
The big beautiful wiles,
uh,

1117
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:47,410
the minky whales,
which are the only whales that are 

1118
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:49,451
currently being killed by the Japanese 
and the Norwegians and so on are 

1119
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:53,020
crowding out the,
the bigger wiles from having their 

1120
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,340
populations being able to come back up.
So it actually,

1121
00:49:55,341 --> 00:50:00,341
from a sustainability standpoint,
you may actually want to have some 

1122
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:01,430
culling of the minky whales,
which are the sort of little shitty,

1123
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:08,240
the ugly stepchildren of the while of 
the whale species because they're eating

1124
00:50:08,241 --> 00:50:13,241
all the plankton and they're reading all
the stuff that the blue whales and the 

1125
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:13,241
humpback whales could be using to 
resurrect their populations.

1126
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,550
And in Australia that people go crazy 
sometimes,

1127
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,020
especially known Australians,
abet,

1128
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,460
abet,
kangaroo cows,

1129
00:50:19,461 --> 00:50:21,530
but you got to kangaroos breed like 
rabbits.

1130
00:50:21,531 --> 00:50:26,531
They go out there and shoot Kangaroos to
bring down their population so they 

1131
00:50:26,531 --> 00:50:27,850
don't starve to death sometimes because 
have so many of them.

1132
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:32,300
Have a good buddy who's a famous hunter,
Adam Green tree in Australia.

1133
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:37,301
And what he explained to me is what's 
really crazy is they brought over 

1134
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:39,530
certain animals and when they brought 
over certain animals,

1135
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:44,531
then they had to bring over certain 
animals to deal with these certain 

1136
00:50:44,531 --> 00:50:46,871
animals.
And one of the things they brought over 

1137
00:50:46,871 --> 00:50:46,871
as rabbits and they just fucked up,
man.

1138
00:50:46,871 --> 00:50:48,050
They fucked up.
And these are just terrible.

1139
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:53,080
They have so many rabbits that will.
They brought over the pain to the 

1140
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:53,080
rabbits.
Yeah,

1141
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,920
right.
He said they brought over the foxes to 

1142
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,571
deal with the rabbits will.
They didn't anticipate as a fox is 

1143
00:50:58,571 --> 00:50:58,850
killing everything else.
Ground nesting birds.

1144
00:50:58,851 --> 00:50:59,470
So they're,
they're,

1145
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,350
they're destroying these ground nesting 
birds and everything else.

1146
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,040
I can get all.
They didn't have a mission.

1147
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,050
It's not like they programmed their DNA.
Say,

1148
00:51:06,051 --> 00:51:08,200
okay,
you foxes are only attracted to rabbits.

1149
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,580
Go kill rabbits and foxes kill 
everything.

1150
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,470
Cool.
And they also kill a lot of calves.

1151
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:16,280
They kill one of the things that Fox has
left to do and it's a horrible thing.

1152
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:21,450
They,
they can smell and they know when a 

1153
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:23,000
mother is about to give birth to a calf.
So they wait until it's coming out.

1154
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:28,001
And they literally pull it out of her 
vagina and eat it in front of the 

1155
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:28,001
mother.
And that's what they do.

1156
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:32,470
They do that with deer.
They do that with anything they can get 

1157
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:32,470
ahold of.
It's just a part of nature.

1158
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,050
And they're,
they're having a real problem with that.

1159
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:39,950
The Fox population is just booming.
So they've set up these crazy fences.

1160
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:45,250
They've hired these contractors that 
build these enormous fences and 

1161
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:45,250
Australia to try to keep the rabbits 
out.

1162
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:49,540
The problem is,
it takes a while to build a fence as 

1163
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,851
they're building the fence,
the rabbits got in and they just fucked 

1164
00:51:51,851 --> 00:51:52,670
like rabbits inside the fence.
And now the rabbits are over there too.

1165
00:51:52,671 --> 00:51:57,671
And they don't know what to do about it.
They're trying to figure out how to 

1166
00:51:57,671 --> 00:51:57,671
handle it.

1167
00:51:57,671 --> 00:51:57,671
It's just,
that reminds me.

1168
00:51:57,671 --> 00:51:58,620
So in New Zealand,
I'm half New Zealand,

1169
00:51:58,621 --> 00:51:59,870
my mum's a New Zealand,
uh,

1170
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,770
and I was just back there a few weeks 
ago.

1171
00:52:01,771 --> 00:52:03,680
My grandmother passed away.
She was 100.

1172
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:06,920
So like congratulations to her made.
Yep,

1173
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:07,860
that's right.
That mark,

1174
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:09,510
that's the goal,
right?

1175
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,950
I mean,
you mentioned being a hundred anyway,

1176
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,880
but one of the interesting thing about 
New Zealand in terms of all of all of 

1177
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,031
that conversation around pests is that 
it's possibly the only country that 

1178
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:24,660
actually has the capability and a major 
movement to do so to take itself back to

1179
00:52:24,661 --> 00:52:29,100
pre to what the ecosystem was before 
humans arrived.

1180
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:34,580
So they like.
I don't know if you know what a key way 

1181
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:34,580
is.
The bird,

1182
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,560
not the fruit,
short flightless bird that just wanders 

1183
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,330
around like New Zealand is just lousy 
with all of these really,

1184
00:52:39,331 --> 00:52:43,590
really evolutionarily dumb animals like 
birds that don't fly,

1185
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,800
which when approached by a Predator just
stands still in the hope that the 

1186
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,431
Predator isn't gonna come after them,
which worked prior to the introduction 

1187
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:54,920
of western species,
but now that there are boxes and they're

1188
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,380
like,
it's not a great survival tactic to just

1189
00:52:58,381 --> 00:53:01,020
stand still while the Fox is is coming 
after you.

1190
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,020
So there's this massive movement in New 
Zealand now,

1191
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:09,380
which my uncle is heavily involved in,
in the prime minister is heavily 

1192
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,441
involved in.
To actually genuinely eradicate all of 

1193
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:15,390
these small mammals that were brought in
by by humans when they came.

1194
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:20,630
So it's such a green country.
There's such environmentalist in New 

1195
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:20,630
Zealand.
They really,

1196
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,810
really get their hands dirty with all 
that stuff that's super,

1197
00:53:21,811 --> 00:53:26,811
super natural about everything.
But it's funny because in the rest of 

1198
00:53:26,811 --> 00:53:26,811
the world

1199
00:53:26,811 --> 00:53:31,520
if you're an environmentalist you'll 
probably an animal lover and you're 

1200
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,100
probably maybe not a bloodthirsty 
person,

1201
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:37,310
but the Kiwis,
the New Zealand is I just so blood test 

1202
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:39,771
because they love killing small mammals.
So like it's almost like a part of your 

1203
00:53:39,771 --> 00:53:41,340
patriotic duty to like just have trap,
settle over the place.

1204
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:46,341
They go out and there's just like a 
bloodied old Fox with its head smashed 

1205
00:53:46,341 --> 00:53:46,341
in by a trap and they're like,
oh good.

1206
00:53:46,341 --> 00:53:48,690
We did know we did our job for the 
environment today.

1207
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:54,080
It's great.
Well there are hunting magazines in 

1208
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,241
Australia.
They're really fucking weird because 

1209
00:53:56,241 --> 00:53:57,660
hunting magazines in America,
they show like a deer or an elk,

1210
00:53:57,661 --> 00:53:59,730
like something you hunt for food,
you know,

1211
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:00,180
like,
look,

1212
00:54:00,181 --> 00:54:02,850
this guy got an elk bar that's like 500 
pounds of meat.

1213
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,990
That's awesome.
Well,

1214
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,810
hunting magazines in Australia have 
those as well,

1215
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,960
but they also have guys holding up foxes
and feral cats and my friend gave me a 

1216
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:17,241
copy of this magazine and I was like,
do you got fucking dead cats in your 

1217
00:54:17,241 --> 00:54:17,241
magazine?

1218
00:54:17,241 --> 00:54:17,940
Like kitty cats?
Like my cat,

1219
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:20,580
like this is fuck these ones and feral 
man.

1220
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:21,390
Yeah,
they're feral.

1221
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:22,820
They didn't make the cut.
They didn't make.

1222
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:27,390
They didn't make the team.
They're out there trying to hustle.

1223
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:28,800
Yeah,
the killing all the birds,

1224
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:33,830
killing all those little flight records 
and killing all of the rabbits and 

1225
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:34,710
killing all of the.
Anything else I can get ahold of.

1226
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,150
New Zealand also has a lot of invasive 
large game species.

1227
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:41,640
It's one of the big destinations for 
hunting,

1228
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:46,641
like stags stag is a type of elk.
It's like a similar to an l and it's an 

1229
00:54:46,641 --> 00:54:47,850
enormous,
beautiful,

1230
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:50,880
majestic creature,
but nothing kills them,

1231
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:54,060
but I don't have any big cats over there
like we have in America.

1232
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,830
We have mountain lions,
we have bears.

1233
00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:01,010
Those all killed the calves.
Like the bears kill more than 50 percent

1234
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:06,030
or as much as 50 percent depending on 
who you ask of the Moose that are born,

1235
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,260
like as they're coming out.

1236
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,260
Same with the Fox.
Do they find the mother as it's giving 

1237
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:12,650
birth and they literally killed the calf
immediately.

1238
00:55:12,651 --> 00:55:17,651
You need it.
It's one of their favorite things to 

1239
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:17,651
eat,
so it keeps the population low.

1240
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:18,810
There's sort of a balance to that,
but they don't have that in New Zealand.

1241
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,810
So New Zealand,
they just have these free roaming stags.

1242
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,970
They're just massive and they have no 
predators,

1243
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:29,180
so it's a huge hunting destination,
so people fly 16 hours to go to New 

1244
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:33,980
Zealand.
They have all these animals and you 

1245
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,631
could bring the meat back so you can 
bring back hundreds and hundreds of 

1246
00:55:35,631 --> 00:55:38,480
pounds of this insanely delicious 
stagged meat and it's one of the big 

1247
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:43,911
hunting destinations in the world and 
you can kind of call it trophy hunting 

1248
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:45,390
because everybody wants those antlers as
well.

1249
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,880
But the meat is like the best meat in 
the world.

1250
00:55:47,881 --> 00:55:50,700
It's incredibly delicious and so good 
for you.

1251
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,920
And so rich nutrients that it doesn't 
get like the,

1252
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:53,540
you know,
the,

1253
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:54,110
the,
you know,

1254
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:59,111
like shooting lions are.
And also it's not like stags were in 

1255
00:55:59,111 --> 00:56:00,330
danger and they have to shoot them.
You don't even have to have a license.

1256
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,670
That's what's fucked up.
You don't,

1257
00:56:01,671 --> 00:56:06,671
you don't have to have tags.
Like in America it's hard to pull a tag 

1258
00:56:06,671 --> 00:56:07,260
for an elk,
like say like New Mexico.

1259
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:12,470
New Mexico is like prime elk territory.
They have these enormous elk in New 

1260
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,430
Mexico and they,
it's just a majestic.

1261
00:56:14,431 --> 00:56:18,630
And if you can get lucky and get a New 
Mexico elk tag for hunters,

1262
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:20,240
like wow,
I'm going to get the milk.

1263
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:22,640
You have to sign up for it.
You get,

1264
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,100
it's almost like there's a lottery

1265
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,160
and you get picked.
Say like 100 people sign up for tags.

1266
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:28,990
Maybe like 10.
We'll get a tag.

1267
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:34,230
And so you keep trying to get a ticket 
to the opening ceremony of the Rio 

1268
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,020
Olympics or something.
Next year I might have to apply.

1269
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,660
And then you've got a one in a thousand 
shot up being accepted.

1270
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:38,920
You can probably.
Well,

1271
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:41,810
and also in the same way you could 
probably also get a scalper to buy,

1272
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:45,190
sell you a ticket.
You could probably scalp a tag here.

1273
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:46,870
That probably helped me a black market 
for them.

1274
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:49,060
I don't even think it's a black market.
I think it's illegal.

1275
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:54,061
Like outfitters get a certain amount of 
tags and so that they could sell their 

1276
00:56:54,061 --> 00:56:57,601
tax for like 25 grand or something.
Exorbitant rate and then do it like 

1277
00:56:57,601 --> 00:56:57,640
that.
Twenty five grand.

1278
00:56:57,641 --> 00:56:59,110
You could fly first class to New 
Zealand.

1279
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,240
You could screw the tag 16 hours though.

1280
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,220
It's a long flight.
You can drive to New Mexico.

1281
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:05,390
You have your own car,
sleeping intent.

1282
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,520
My friend from Australia actually came 
and hunted in New Mexico.

1283
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:12,930
He flew all the way from New Mexico,
ironically and hunted in,

1284
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,640
in new Mac or flew all the way from 
Australia,

1285
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,500
hunted in New Mexico and wrote this big 
story about it.

1286
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,030
Cool.
But um,

1287
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:21,130
so it's complicated.
It's speaking of the,

1288
00:57:21,131 --> 00:57:24,130
of how good the stags taste.
Like.

1289
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:29,730
I was amazed.
I'm always amazed when I go back to New 

1290
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,170
Zealand and about how much we're missing
out on great produce in America just 

1291
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:36,600
because of the proliferation of,
of industrialized farming and and the,

1292
00:57:36,601 --> 00:57:39,250
the dearth of great natural food.
I mean I was,

1293
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:44,310
when I was back in New Zealand,
was staying at this little bed and 

1294
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:46,210
breakfast had these eggs for breakfast,
just two fried eggs,

1295
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,480
like the yolk was bright red and it 
stood up like more than an inch above 

1296
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,100
the rest of the,
the egg and the white was just perfect.

1297
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,160
It was flavor.
Tasted like an egg that I haven't tasted

1298
00:57:57,161 --> 00:57:58,750
in years and years.
I was like,

1299
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,220
well,
he's come from and she's like,

1300
00:58:00,221 --> 00:58:01,510
oh,
what just popped down the road?

1301
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:04,630
We have a few trucks and we just put up 
this morning.

1302
00:58:04,631 --> 00:58:07,360
They are just fresh from the backyard.
It was like,

1303
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:12,780
that's what an egg.
That's just all I'm doing is eating an 

1304
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:12,780
actual leg,
which I haven't.

1305
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,060
I haven't had an actual egg in ages.
When are you going back?

1306
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,630
Uh Oh.
To New York to New York?

1307
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:17,710
Yeah.
Light on a red eye.

1308
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,050
Shit.
Why get some eggs?

1309
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:23,570
I have 22 chickens to get eggs every 
day,

1310
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:24,940
man.
I take eggs on the plane.

1311
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,230
I don't know if they'll let you.
Well,

1312
00:58:26,231 --> 00:58:28,930
it's not coming from another country.
Let me see if I could show you.

1313
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:32,710
I have an image on my instagram of how 
incredible the eggs look like.

1314
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:33,910
Jamie,
you see if you could find that,

1315
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,180
but yeah,
my eggs or like a dark dark orange.

1316
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:42,210
Beautiful.
And it's because my chickens run around 

1317
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,431
free.
That's another thing when you see like 

1318
00:58:44,431 --> 00:58:46,680
vegetarian fed chickens,
like you see that like grass fed 

1319
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,170
chickens,
you don't want that.

1320
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:49,110
Chickens are fucking dinosaurs.
All right.

1321
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,680
They.
They eat everything they eat.

1322
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:53,950
A lot of bugs ate.
I fed my chickens a mouse the other day.

1323
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,040
I didn't want to,
but this is a story.

1324
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:58,220
I've already told them,
the podcast,

1325
00:58:58,221 --> 00:58:59,890
so I'll.
I'll tell us briefly as possible because

1326
00:58:59,891 --> 00:59:02,500
it was very conflicted about this.
I came home,

1327
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:07,980
I was on the road and my family had 
found a wounded hawk in our yard and 

1328
00:59:08,561 --> 00:59:13,561
this goes back to the hierarchy of 
animals argument and they found this 

1329
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:13,860
wounded hawk or something was wrong with
its wing,

1330
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:16,180
it's broken wing and it was a juvenile 
hawk.

1331
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,140
It was,
it was,

1332
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,510
you know,
conference call but a small.

1333
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:20,650
And so,
uh,

1334
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:25,651
they picked up and put it in a box and 
they wanted to feed it and they had to 

1335
00:59:25,651 --> 00:59:28,991
get it to the veterinarian on Monday,
but they were trying to figure out like 

1336
00:59:28,991 --> 00:59:29,810
what wildlife organization save these 
hawks.

1337
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:31,490
So they said,
well we have to feed this thing,

1338
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:36,491
we have to figure out how to feed it.
So there was a pet store that's open 

1339
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:36,491
that sells pinkies,
which are baby mice.

1340
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:41,950
And so they fed this hawk,
these baby mice and it kept it alive 

1341
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:44,930
over the weekend and they gave it some 
water with an eyedropper.

1342
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:49,760
And then there was one pinky leftover 
and my daughter wanted to keep it.

1343
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:50,690
Let's keep,
you have to keep.

1344
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:51,080
I go,
honey,

1345
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:53,660
this is not going to live like it needs 
its mothers milk.

1346
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:55,280
The mother's not here,
it doesn't even.

1347
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:56,540
It came.
See it's,

1348
00:59:56,541 --> 01:00:01,541
I mean it's only a few days old.
And I was amazed it was still alive and 

1349
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:01,541
I said him,
I went,

1350
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:05,330
what are you doing?
Like you were going to do something 

1351
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:07,241
about this.
And so the two options were take it to 

1352
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:07,550
the pet store and give it back to the 
pet store,

1353
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,080
which they're going to feed it the 
snakes,

1354
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:14,140
that's what they sell them for to sell 
them for food or I give it to the 

1355
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:17,300
chickens and the chickens to kill it.
Like the hierarchy of animals.

1356
01:00:17,301 --> 01:00:22,301
Like you just,
you were just feeding these fucking 

1357
01:00:22,301 --> 01:00:22,301
things to hawk system.
Like what the hell?

1358
01:00:22,301 --> 01:00:22,301
So,
um,

1359
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:27,370
you know,
we made an executive decision and I 

1360
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:27,370
decided that I was going to be the one 
since I'm the killer,

1361
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,840
I go out and feed it to the chicken.
So I opened up the,

1362
01:00:29,841 --> 01:00:31,340
there's some of my eggs.

1363
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:32,230
Delicious.
See,

1364
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:34,350
look at the color on the yoke.
The.

1365
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,160
Yeah,
like you done.

1366
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,500
Just don't get that from the 
supermarket.

1367
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:41,590
No,
that Goddamn l you ca tech a hot sauce 

1368
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:45,160
to.
I hate that this morning I had some of 

1369
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:45,160
those exact same.
That's exactly.

1370
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,240
I have that all the time with the 
Zucchini bread.

1371
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:49,560
I'll have an egg sandwich.
But um,

1372
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,880
so I put the pinky in the chicken.
I have this big huge chicken coop where 

1373
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,030
they all 22 of them run around.
I mean they have,

1374
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,310
it's like,
I don't know how many hundreds of square

1375
01:00:58,311 --> 01:00:59,780
feet,
but it's an enormous chicken coop.

1376
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,840
And where do you live?
I live out in the burbs.

1377
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,240
I live.
I coyotes dear in my yard,

1378
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:09,320
but I put this thing down for a second.
I mean one second.

1379
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:12,140
And these chickens dove on it.
They're murderers,

1380
01:01:12,141 --> 01:01:15,590
little fucking dinosaurs.
And they were biting each other's face.

1381
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:20,710
Two steel pieces of this,
this little tiny baby mouse from each 

1382
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:20,940
other.
Right.

1383
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:24,070
So goes back to the hierarchy.
And when you,

1384
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:26,600
when you said that birds are dinosaurs 
you made,

1385
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:31,780
did you see the story about how the,
how scientists have now I'm sequenced 

1386
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,250
the genome of woolly mammoths.
Yes.

1387
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:36,530
Which means that within the next 10 or 
20 years,

1388
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:41,800
we're going to be able to actually 
recreate woolly mammoths and bring them 

1389
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:41,800
back.
Should we want to China.

1390
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:46,180
They're going to do it in China just 
like they've recreated like Paris and 

1391
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:46,180
all these weird city.
You've seen that?

1392
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:46,880
No,
I haven't seen that.

1393
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:51,910
Oh my God.
They have these ghost towns in China 

1394
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,750
where they've recreated famous European 
cities and no one's living in them.

1395
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:56,120
They don't know what the fuck they're 
doing.

1396
01:01:56,121 --> 01:01:59,330
Or like an Eiffel Tower in China.
They have everything.

1397
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,250
They.
It's so bizarre.

1398
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,990
I look at this like these.
These are.

1399
01:02:02,991 --> 01:02:07,640
This is a real recreated city in China 
and they're ghost towns.

1400
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:09,260
There's no one living in them.
I mean,

1401
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:14,261
I did know about the ghost towns,
but I didn't know that they will 

1402
01:02:14,261 --> 01:02:15,290
replicated off other existing cities.
China's replica of Paris.

1403
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:16,700
Go to that page,
Jamie,

1404
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:20,460
because it's fucking insane and there's 
lot of people that aren't aware of that.

1405
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:25,080
It's an entirely depressing ghost town.
That is an exact replica of Paris.

1406
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:30,081
Go to full screen if you would in the 
apartments look like perusing and upon 

1407
01:02:30,081 --> 01:02:31,230
their exact.
The exact,

1408
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,860
it's insane.
And look at the Eiffel Tower,

1409
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:39,890
you can see like a that they were like 
just regular skyscrapers in like a 

1410
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:39,890
neighboring city.
Yeah,

1411
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,100
it's really,
really,

1412
01:02:41,101 --> 01:02:45,270
really strange and they haven't just 
done it with Paris but like this is,

1413
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,930
this is abandoned,
this is what's really fucked about it.

1414
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:49,630
Why they have been in the of people 
moving into.

1415
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:54,670
I don't think it worked.
They had an idea to build something and 

1416
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:54,670
have a bunch of people move in,
but.

1417
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:55,350
And everybody's like,
what?

1418
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:57,780
The Chinese government,
they just forced people to live there.

1419
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:02,610
I think they're just sort of slowly but 
surely becoming more capitalistic.

1420
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:06,140
Yeah,
but they're no less authoritarian.

1421
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:11,150
They're having a big crackdown in China.
It's much more authoritarian than it's 

1422
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:13,911
been in the past couple of decades in 
terms of like anti free speech and just 

1423
01:03:13,911 --> 01:03:14,910
forcing people to do whatever the 
whatever Beijing wants them to.

1424
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:15,840
Right.
You're right.

1425
01:03:15,841 --> 01:03:20,841
But capitalism as far as their ability 
to earn money and that's the apparently 

1426
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:26,601
a huge issue that's in China now is the 
haves and the have nots and how baller 

1427
01:03:27,181 --> 01:03:31,320
everybody wants to act and behave and 
it's become a huge part of their culture

1428
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:36,321
like flossing and having the finest of 
everything to find his bag and the 

1429
01:03:36,321 --> 01:03:37,790
finest watch and the fines.
If you're,

1430
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:43,010
if you're a CEO of a company,
you must have a home that is bigger and 

1431
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:47,031
more grand than anyone working for you 
or the other competitive companies that 

1432
01:03:47,851 --> 01:03:48,330
are,
you know,

1433
01:03:48,331 --> 01:03:50,550
other also have ceos.
You have to have the biggest.

1434
01:03:50,551 --> 01:03:50,640
Okay.

1435
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:52,630
Oh,
it's incredibly consumerist.

1436
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:57,220
China and I read an interesting piece 
about how different Asian cultures spend

1437
01:03:57,221 --> 01:04:00,700
their money and one of the points was 
that Chinese,

1438
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:06,150
Japanese people,
Japanese and Chinese culture is like 

1439
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:06,370
totally different.
Japanese in Japan,

1440
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:11,580
people when people earn money,
they will usually put it towards making 

1441
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:14,851
the home as nice as possible so that you
go into a Japanese home and it's 

1442
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:15,760
beautiful.
Outwardly.

1443
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:19,330
People aren't so obsessed with like 
flashy things in China.

1444
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:24,690
People will live in an absolute shit 
hole if it means that they can afford 

1445
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:26,260
like the best watch or the best car or 
like the best handbag.

1446
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,680
So there's like a lot more kind of 
outward consumerist,

1447
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,200
almost like you say,
capitalist style,

1448
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:37,320
con consumption conspicuous consumption 
rather than just sort of feathering 

1449
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,220
their nest the way that the Japanese 
home bodies too.

1450
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:41,660
What was interesting,
it's like a repression thing,

1451
01:04:41,661 --> 01:04:45,410
like a response to oppression,
sort of like Catholic school girls,

1452
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:48,080
Catholic school girls,
you know,

1453
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:50,670
everybody knows I grew up,
I,

1454
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,450
I dated a girl that was in Catholic 
school when I was,

1455
01:04:53,451 --> 01:04:56,210
uh,
in high school and she was a freak.

1456
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:59,570
She was just such a freak.
And it was because everything was like,

1457
01:04:59,571 --> 01:05:02,870
you're going to Howl,
sex is bad and you get that girl alone.

1458
01:05:02,871 --> 01:05:05,690
And she was just bought bananas just 
bonkers.

1459
01:05:05,691 --> 01:05:10,691
Yeah.
I think that's what happens with the 

1460
01:05:10,691 --> 01:05:10,691
repression,
you know,

1461
01:05:10,691 --> 01:05:12,110
some preacher's daughter type shit.

1462
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:17,110
Well,
they're also coming from a much lower 

1463
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:17,110
also coming from a much lower place.
So if,

1464
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,100
you know,
if dirt poor,

1465
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:20,110
and if you've just had a,
you know,

1466
01:05:20,111 --> 01:05:22,180
the past couple of decades,
be your big boom,

1467
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:27,181
and then I suppose you want to show that
you're profiting from it more than a 

1468
01:05:27,181 --> 01:05:30,330
country like Japan,
which has basically been rich since the 

1469
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:30,330
sixties.

1470
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:33,750
Yeah.
They like a hybrid of like a communist 

1471
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:34,360
and a capitalist state right now there's
sort of like,

1472
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:39,770
well they're not,
I don't think it's fair to call them 

1473
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:42,170
capitalists because it's best capitalism
should be about the free exchange about 

1474
01:05:42,991 --> 01:05:44,000
entrepreneurism.
Right?

1475
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:47,360
And the ability of individual human 
beings to start their own businesses and

1476
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:52,370
to trade with one another that is still 
not the way that the Chinese economy 

1477
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:55,851
runs.
But I think what you're alluding to is 

1478
01:05:55,851 --> 01:05:58,230
the fact that they are rapaciously pro 
money and desperate to,

1479
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,030
you know,
to enhance their,

1480
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,490
their economic growth as quickly as 
possible.

1481
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,110
So it's not like they're,
you know,

1482
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:05,250
Mousey tongue said,
uh,

1483
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:06,000
you know,
when someone,

1484
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:08,640
someone said that the reforms that he 
was bringing in,

1485
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,760
or maybe it was Deng Xiaoping said that 
the reforms that he was bringing in,

1486
01:06:11,761 --> 01:06:13,650
what kind of capitalist,
uh,

1487
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,410
and shouldn't he have more of an 
allegiance to communism?

1488
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:17,530
He said,
you know,

1489
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:20,610
black cat white cat,
as long as it catches mice.

1490
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,710
Ooh,
clever bastard.

1491
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,830
Not always so good at things.
They're so good at saying,

1492
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,160
you know,
like Sun Tzu's art of war.

1493
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,810
You read that shit today.
Like,

1494
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:32,430
damn at that dude nailed it.
Right.

1495
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,140
So you know,
they want to make money.

1496
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:39,200
They don't give him no,
don't give a toss whether you call it 

1497
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,111
capitalism will come from.
I think you might describe it as a kind 

1498
01:06:42,111 --> 01:06:44,841
of.
It's almost like a 19th century 

1499
01:06:44,841 --> 01:06:47,510
mercantilist like regime.
It's almost like the British empire was 

1500
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:51,421
or something where there's,
there wasn't a lot of freedom for 

1501
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:52,950
individuals to,
to prosper off their own bat.

1502
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:55,590
And there were a lot,
there wasn't a lot of free industries.

1503
01:06:55,591 --> 01:06:58,350
So you would have like big state 
supporting industries that,

1504
01:06:58,351 --> 01:07:00,210
for example,
ran like cartels,

1505
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:05,230
you know,
only one company was allowed to import 

1506
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:05,230
cotton into Britain or something like 
that and that you,

1507
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:10,040
these cozy relationships between mega 
conglomerates and politicians and the 

1508
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:14,931
government.
I mean that's Kinda what it's like in 

1509
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:14,931
China.

1510
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:17,960
So it used to be that you got a signed 
an occupation saying the way that we 

1511
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:22,320
think of Russia or the way that we think
of Cuba that they tell you,

1512
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:27,350
hey,
this is what you're going to do and so 

1513
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:28,290
you go do this and you get paid x amount
by the state and that's all you get.

1514
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:32,700
But that wasn't good for business.
Like you got to give people an incentive

1515
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:36,390
in order to push harder and to innovate 
and like you got to,

1516
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:41,070
they have to know that that juicy watch 
is like dangling from that string,

1517
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,280
like a carrot in front of them.
That's what makes them push and that's 

1518
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,580
where they fucked up.
And that's where they sort of see.

1519
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:49,140
They'd see that about America.
Like look,

1520
01:07:49,141 --> 01:07:52,650
these dummies work all day for Alexis.
They just want that car.

1521
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:57,651
So bad and they see that billboard as 
they're driving home in their fucking 

1522
01:07:57,651 --> 01:07:58,470
shitty Hyundai.
Not that Honda is are Shitty by the way.

1523
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,330
I like that actually.
Really Nice.

1524
01:08:00,331 --> 01:08:03,870
Now I was in one this weekend in Brazil 
and I was like,

1525
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,820
these things are like fucking Mercedes 
now.

1526
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,130
You know what I.
I'm driving a Kia here.

1527
01:08:08,131 --> 01:08:10,530
I always thought of kids as being like 
crappy.

1528
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,930
It's fantastic.
No,

1529
01:08:11,931 --> 01:08:16,931
not bound anymore.
I got an upgrade like at the Avis Guy 

1530
01:08:16,931 --> 01:08:16,931
gave me an upgrade on

1531
01:08:16,931 --> 01:08:21,040
it because I'm some elite thing or 
something or some credit card or 

1532
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:21,040
whatever that I've got and he was like,
oh,

1533
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,130
I have a gray Kia.
I'm like,

1534
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:22,970
what?
Are you kidding me?

1535
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,530
You upgraded me to a key.
I'll.

1536
01:08:24,531 --> 01:08:29,531
Thanks a lot buddy.
Some upgrade me to the worst car in the 

1537
01:08:29,531 --> 01:08:29,531
world.
No,

1538
01:08:29,531 --> 01:08:29,930
it's great.
Well,

1539
01:08:29,931 --> 01:08:32,420
this is the golden age of automotive 
engineering.

1540
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:37,840
All cars are show that they've learned 
so many lessons from the past few 

1541
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:42,190
decades at all cars that the United 
States used to be known for having Shit 

1542
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:43,730
cars like we used to make shitty fucking
cars.

1543
01:08:43,731 --> 01:08:48,731
We made really cool looking cars in the 
sixties and then for 20 years we just 

1544
01:08:48,731 --> 01:08:51,260
shit all over the,
the people that were buying cars and you

1545
01:08:51,261 --> 01:08:53,810
had to be like a martyr to buy an 
American car.

1546
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:57,860
Like a Japanese car was cheaper.
It was better engineered.

1547
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:02,890
It would break down less and for most of
automotive history you're talking about 

1548
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:03,380
like starting in the eighties or 
something?

1549
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:08,650
I think it was the seventies from the 
seventies on when the gas crisis hit in 

1550
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:10,520
the 19 set,
I believe it was like 73,

1551
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:14,390
74 American muscle cars and American 
like big cars,

1552
01:09:14,391 --> 01:09:19,391
like the cadillacs,
the things that people really loved 

1553
01:09:19,391 --> 01:09:19,391
about American cars,
those signified America.

1554
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:21,560
You know,
when you thought about automobiles,

1555
01:09:21,561 --> 01:09:24,290
you thought about those big cadillacs,
they'll show a smooth,

1556
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:27,050
cushy rides.
No one was making those in Germany knows

1557
01:09:27,051 --> 01:09:29,480
and making those,
that was a true American product,

1558
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:34,720
but then gas became insanely expensive 
and once the gas crisis hit America 

1559
01:09:34,941 --> 01:09:39,941
started making four cylinder mustangs.
That looked like shit and everything 

1560
01:09:39,941 --> 01:09:43,100
just fell apart and they've.
They were really unreliable.

1561
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,440
Then there was also the issues with 
unions.

1562
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:50,680
The issues with automotive unions,
the union workers wanted to get paid a 

1563
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,681
fuck load of money and I had a buddy who
was a union employee in Detroit and he 

1564
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:57,080
told me like how they used to do it and 
it was just ridiculous.

1565
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:57,820
The,
the,

1566
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:02,780
the demands the unions had and what they
were able to achieve in bargaining.

1567
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:08,120
They would have a job that one person 
could do easily eight hour day job,

1568
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:10,120
but two people would take that job.
There was,

1569
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:12,140
it had to be a two person job.
The union demanded it,

1570
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:15,620
so what they would do is one guy would 
show up for four hours a day and then he

1571
01:10:15,621 --> 01:10:17,330
would leave.
The other guy would show up four hours a

1572
01:10:17,331 --> 01:10:19,460
day.
So you had both punch in,

1573
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:22,370
you know,
but one guy would like punch in at 9:00

1574
01:10:22,371 --> 01:10:27,371
and he would go fuck off for four hours 
and then he'd go back and the other guy 

1575
01:10:27,371 --> 01:10:30,530
would relieve him and you know,
they would just switch off like that.

1576
01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:33,890
And the company car companies would have
these massive long term liabilities,

1577
01:10:33,891 --> 01:10:38,891
right?
Because then have like pension programs 

1578
01:10:38,891 --> 01:10:40,901
that were defined benefit pensions 
instead of defined input pinch out and 

1579
01:10:40,901 --> 01:10:42,800
that might not be the correct economic 
way of saying it,

1580
01:10:42,801 --> 01:10:47,801
but like instead of you put into your 
pension and then when you retire at you 

1581
01:10:47,801 --> 01:10:47,801
get back what you put in.

1582
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:51,050
It's we will pay you x amount for the 
rest of your life.

1583
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:56,110
Like a form of social security.
I mean it's even more weird than social 

1584
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:57,470
security.
It's like a form of guaranteed corporate

1585
01:10:57,471 --> 01:11:00,410
welfare for all of the unionized 
employees for the rest of their lives.

1586
01:11:00,411 --> 01:11:02,570
After they retire.
Yeah.

1587
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:06,020
Ends a lot for a company to be able to 
bear and that's why they moved all their

1588
01:11:06,021 --> 01:11:11,021
things overseas.
I mean that's what happened when they 

1589
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:12,941
started just shipping everything 
overseas and then ironically Japanese 

1590
01:11:12,941 --> 01:11:14,190
companies started shipping their things 
to America.

1591
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:16,320
Like a lot of Honda's are built in 
America,

1592
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:19,770
like different Japanese companies.
I don't know how the fuck it works now.

1593
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:24,990
One of the biggest Mitsubishi Plants in,
in the Asia Pacific was in Australia.

1594
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,690
Like why?
Why are they building it and doing it in

1595
01:11:27,691 --> 01:11:30,390
Australia and I don't know.
They must have got some sort of a deal.

1596
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:35,390
I don't know how it works.
And then South Korea came online and 

1597
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:36,120
started making good cause like the key 
is now.

1598
01:11:36,121 --> 01:11:37,050
Right.
The Honda is,

1599
01:11:37,051 --> 01:11:38,460
are fantastic.
They're,

1600
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,670
they're luxury one that they make that 
one that looks like a Mercedes.

1601
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:44,160
They sort of ripped off Mercedes design.
Yeah.

1602
01:11:44,161 --> 01:11:46,080
What's that creek twice or.
No,

1603
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:47,850
that's not it.
What is it not on the Elantra?

1604
01:11:47,851 --> 01:11:50,530
Is Genesis equus or something like that?
Yeah.

1605
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,990
Uh,
I mean,

1606
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,580
but I've,
I've heard you talk also about like the,

1607
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:57,020
the muscle cars of the fifties in terms 
of like the,

1608
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:00,180
that still in Cuba and still working and
running.

1609
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:05,181
Right.
I went to Cuba or was it this past new 

1610
01:12:05,181 --> 01:12:05,181
year's?
No,

1611
01:12:05,181 --> 01:12:08,160
like two a year and a half ago.
And Man,

1612
01:12:08,161 --> 01:12:10,860
it's just incredible seeing like 
cruising around Havana.

1613
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:12,110
Ollie's old.
Cool.

1614
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:17,330
They love those cars.
They're still going tanks they call 

1615
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:17,330
them.
Yeah.

1616
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:21,980
They call them Yank tanks because they 
built these enormous metal fucking 

1617
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:26,210
buildings that you could drive around 
and those was 55 Chevy's and things 

1618
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:26,400
along those lines.

1619
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,760
Do you think,
was that while I was going to say,

1620
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:33,770
do you think that the American industry 
is ever going to be as innovative as it 

1621
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:34,300
was back in the fifties and it's never 
going to rule the coop?

1622
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:39,420
Um,
it's gonna be real tough to rule the 

1623
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:39,420
coop,
but they've made an insane comeback.

1624
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:42,840
The new American cars are incredible.
I drove one of those Cadillac escalades.

1625
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:46,650
That thing is a marvel of engineering.
The entire screen,

1626
01:12:46,651 --> 01:12:51,651
the entire dashboard is an LCD screen,
huge lcd screen that controls the 

1627
01:12:51,651 --> 01:12:54,300
dashboard lcd screen that controls the 
navigation.

1628
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:59,690
Everything is magnetic ride control.
So you go over bumps and it's like 

1629
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:00,180
butter,
incredible engineering.

1630
01:13:00,181 --> 01:13:02,730
Like the car is beautiful.
They ride gray.

1631
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,820
It's an enormous car,
but it rides like a small car.

1632
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:08,490
Like when you drive one of those big 
cadillac escalades,

1633
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:11,640
that thing feels like you're driving 
like a mid sized car.

1634
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:13,360
That's.
This is what it looks like inside.

1635
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,810
Gorgeous.
They take,

1636
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:19,800
they took it up a 100 notches.
I mean it's an amazing car.

1637
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,380
I almost bought one.
I can't remember close,

1638
01:13:23,381 --> 01:13:26,370
but I went with the instead because 
lexus is a.

1639
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:27,740
They go,
uh,

1640
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:32,990
they're,
they're based off of the Land Cruiser 

1641
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:35,450
and the land cruisers.
One of the best platforms for driving 

1642
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:35,450
off road.
They actually have a lift.

1643
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:36,570
He press a button,
it lifts the car up.

1644
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:39,150
So it gives you more ground clearance on
the lexus or the linkers.

1645
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:44,180
Lexis is the same car as a Land Cruiser.
Amazing Lexus ls five 75 70.

1646
01:13:44,281 --> 01:13:49,281
Yeah.
Is this same exact car as the Toyota 

1647
01:13:49,281 --> 01:13:49,281
Land Cruiser?
It's just they,

1648
01:13:49,281 --> 01:13:50,100
it's like they call it a Land Cruiser 
and drag.

1649
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:52,790
They just make it a little more fluffy 
on the inside and modal,

1650
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:56,790
prettier on the outside.
But I'm an idiot and for some reason I'm

1651
01:13:56,791 --> 01:13:57,090
like,
well,

1652
01:13:57,091 --> 01:13:58,640
what if the apocalypse happens?

1653
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:03,650
I don't have to drive on the dirt.
Aren't neutral department car like a 

1654
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:06,760
drop in the dirt.
I'm one of those dummies and things I 

1655
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:07,200
need to cash canister in my car.
No fuckin grass.

1656
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:08,900
You'll be laughing on the other side of 
your face when that,

1657
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,350
when that happens,
when it all goes to shit.

1658
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:12,550
Now when it all to shit,
if a meteor hits,

1659
01:14:12,551 --> 01:14:17,551
I hope it hits me in the head.
I hope the meteor hits my house and I 

1660
01:14:17,551 --> 01:14:18,890
hope you don't even know about it.
I don't want.

1661
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:21,350
What's that whistling sound?
Boom.

1662
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,310
But I don't want to be that guy.
That's like the.

1663
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:25,790
Like the prepper.
That's right.

1664
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:31,950
Right.
You know when you're fucking hold up 

1665
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:34,441
trying to take little cat naps while 
you're holding a shotgun because you're 

1666
01:14:34,441 --> 01:14:34,930
worried that someone's going to come and
steal your canned peaches.

1667
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:36,990
I don't want to be that guy.

1668
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,310
But then I also don't want to be 
completely unprepared.

1669
01:14:39,311 --> 01:14:44,311
Like I don't even have an emergency.
I live in Manhattan and I don't even 

1670
01:14:44,311 --> 01:14:47,431
have a little bag with some like granola
bars in it and some fresh water in case 

1671
01:14:47,431 --> 01:14:48,880
we get hit with a dirty bomb or 
something.

1672
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,880
You know that stuff.
I have that stuff I have.

1673
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:56,560
I have freeze dried food.
I have hundreds of pounds of frozen meat

1674
01:14:56,561 --> 01:14:58,420
because I hunt.
So I have like,

1675
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,480
if I can keep some sort of power on,
you know,

1676
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:04,990
like by generator or solar,
I have food for a long time,

1677
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:10,350
but that's not why I do it.
I do it because that's what I actually 

1678
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:13,230
do eat really prepping for doomsday in 
terms of those that,

1679
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:15,910
those cars being so sophisticated 
nowadays.

1680
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:20,170
I was interviewing a guy from,
I think it was Gorka who was involved in

1681
01:15:20,171 --> 01:15:21,250
um,
in a,

1682
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:26,400
like a test where these hackers 
encouraged him to get in the car I 

1683
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:26,400
think.

1684
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,070
Right.
And then they,

1685
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:31,830
they hacked into the,
like the was,

1686
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,030
it was recent,
right.

1687
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:38,040
Really when they shut it off.
So they yet now they've turned it off 

1688
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:38,300
the side of the road.
That's right.

1689
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:43,320
So you could have like,
imagine if you have hundreds of 

1690
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,991
thousands of a particular type of car 
driving around in America and because 

1691
01:15:45,991 --> 01:15:46,770
they're all wifi enabled and they're all
saddled,

1692
01:15:46,771 --> 01:15:51,771
they've got,
they're all on the satellite and 

1693
01:15:51,771 --> 01:15:53,011
everything.
You can have hackers or terrorists or 

1694
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:53,011
just knit a wells or some kind of hack 
in.

1695
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:57,720
And theoretically,
I mean they can certainly slow down the 

1696
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:57,720
car.
They can certainly make the cotton,

1697
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,860
they can certainly screw around with it 
in some way,

1698
01:15:59,861 --> 01:16:04,861
but if they could make it speed up to 
160 miles an hour and then via sharply 

1699
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:06,940
to the right,
you could be killed 100,000

1700
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:08,830
people like that.
Like that.

1701
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:14,060
Well,
that's the argument for Michael 

1702
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:14,060
Hastings.
You know that story,

1703
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:14,060
right?
Remind me,

1704
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:18,721
Michael Hastings was the journalist that
was writing all these stories about 

1705
01:16:18,721 --> 01:16:22,080
generals like he had taken down.
He was one of the guys that had taken 

1706
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,600
down to and mcchrystal mcchrystal pace.
Find out about it.

1707
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,040
Um,
I remember his name.

1708
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,630
Yeah.
Michael Hastings.

1709
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:30,730
Well,
his car,

1710
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:33,630
he had actually,
was it,

1711
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,350
was that taken down crystal?
Yeah,

1712
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,390
yeah.
He did the mcchrystal,

1713
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,330
right.
That's right.

1714
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:42,040
So he did that and he was insanely 
worried about his safety.

1715
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,960
Yeah.
And he was telling people like,

1716
01:16:43,961 --> 01:16:45,760
look,
if I wind up dead,

1717
01:16:45,761 --> 01:16:47,800
I didn't kill myself,
just know this.

1718
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:52,980
Well,
he died because his Mercedes was 

1719
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,260
barreling down sunset going into 120 
miles an hour running a tree.

1720
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,310
I remember they were like,
he committed suicide and not only that,

1721
01:16:57,311 --> 01:17:01,080
the engine flew from the wreckage.
I'm like,

1722
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:02,350
there is right there.
That's a,

1723
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:07,351
that's the video of the car,
and these cars today are so fucking 

1724
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:10,220
computer.
There's so

1725
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:15,220
much gadgetry and stuff going on inside 
of them that there are many that argue 

1726
01:17:16,101 --> 01:17:18,950
that not only it has been possible for a
long time,

1727
01:17:18,951 --> 01:17:20,660
but they've been doing this for a long 
time.

1728
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,650
He was a good guy.
He was a good report.

1729
01:17:22,651 --> 01:17:24,430
I have is with buzzfeed.
Um,

1730
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,450
well there's a lot of people that 
believe he was murdered.

1731
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:27,410
Yup.
There's a pace.

1732
01:17:27,411 --> 01:17:29,270
I've got a place here in New York 
magazine,

1733
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,840
which I just chatted to Jamie,
who killed Michael Hastings,

1734
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:36,050
reflexively distrustful Egan to make 
powerful enemies.

1735
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:39,110
The young journalist who's Mercedes 
exploded in Los Angeles one night,

1736
01:17:39,111 --> 01:17:40,760
couldn't possibly have died 
accidentally.

1737
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,830
There's a lot of people that believe 
that,

1738
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:47,831
that will also.
He had apparently he had crystal 

1739
01:17:47,831 --> 01:17:47,831
methodist system.
But here's the thing.

1740
01:17:47,831 --> 01:17:52,330
A lot of people that work really hard 
and that do long hours and are involved 

1741
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:54,230
in journalism,
they take adderall.

1742
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:54,630
Okay.

1743
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:57,680
And adderall and crystal meth or fucking
kissing cousins.

1744
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:02,710
They're almost exactly the same.
I'm not saying that he wasn't really on 

1745
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:03,500
crystal meth and I don't know.
I don't.

1746
01:18:03,501 --> 01:18:05,540
I didn't look at the toxicology 
examination,

1747
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:07,200
but they could've been lying about it 
and just.

1748
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:09,920
It could have been adderall.
Adderall is so fucking common.

1749
01:18:09,921 --> 01:18:11,450
There's so many people that take that 
shit,

1750
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:16,780
especially people that are on deadlines 
and they need energy to push through 

1751
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:17,300
something pretty common in journalism.
And so the idea is,

1752
01:18:17,301 --> 01:18:18,650
oh,
he went back on the drugs,

1753
01:18:18,651 --> 01:18:23,651
he was on adderall and he drove into a 
tree man or math and drove into a 

1754
01:18:23,651 --> 01:18:25,040
treatment and not.
Not necessarily who knows?

1755
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,840
Who knows,
but in speaking of adderall,

1756
01:18:26,841 --> 01:18:31,841
did you see the story this week that the
electronic game is association is going 

1757
01:18:31,841 --> 01:18:35,740
to start drug testing as a game is going
to be drug tested for.

1758
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:37,670
I mean I interviewed the DS.
Yeah.

1759
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:38,650
For,
for PDS,

1760
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:43,660
like adderall and I mean I did.
I had a conversation on huff post live 

1761
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:44,240
with the head of the,
of the.

1762
01:18:44,241 --> 01:18:45,260
Of that.
What does it do?

1763
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:48,620
The Electronic Gaming Association.
It's something that the Srb I think.

1764
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,360
Yeah.
So I had the,

1765
01:18:50,361 --> 01:18:51,750
like the president of that on,
oh,

1766
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:56,770
whatever.
And a bunch of gamers and like some 

1767
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:59,321
sports psychologists and sort of 
ethicists about this and like,

1768
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:04,160
it's so weird why we object to doping in
the first place.

1769
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:07,250
Like it gets very complicated.
Like I understand.

1770
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,590
Oh yeah.
Protocol on adderall,

1771
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:10,460
right?
That's right.

1772
01:19:10,461 --> 01:19:13,620
So that's what sparked this whole thing 
because he made those comments.

1773
01:19:13,621 --> 01:19:14,240
So then they're like,
oh,

1774
01:19:14,241 --> 01:19:17,660
we got to crack down on it.
Well that's like cracking down on comics

1775
01:19:17,661 --> 01:19:20,390
for marijuana if they start drug testing
comedy clubs,

1776
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,180
good fucking luck.
Uh,

1777
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,600
you know what Greg Fitzsimmons said last
night on my app,

1778
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:26,870
my wonderful podcasts that everyone 
should listen to,

1779
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:28,100
they all cheapy live.

1780
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:33,550
What does it WTP live and isn't there an
underscore and somewhere handle WTP,

1781
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,670
undisclosed live on twitter?
Who has WTP live on twitter?

1782
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,520
That's a good point.
What the fuck?

1783
01:19:40,521 --> 01:19:43,450
Some asshole who I'm going to have to be
novel possible.

1784
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,720
Somebody else has that.
Exactly.

1785
01:19:44,721 --> 01:19:46,130
Why would they?
I don't know what it is.

1786
01:19:46,131 --> 01:19:48,800
So many ways with people and if you want
to get on our mailing list,

1787
01:19:48,801 --> 01:19:52,600
you can email info@wtplive.com
and what it was greg saying,

1788
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,650
Greg,
Greg Timmins,

1789
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:58,660
my buddy greg.
Greg Fitzsimmons was a was saying now 

1790
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:58,660
I've forgotten what he said.
Well,

1791
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,230
we're just talking about about adderall.
Adderall,

1792
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:01,670
comedy clubs pot.
Oh yeah,

1793
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:02,900
that's right.
He was saying like if you,

1794
01:20:02,901 --> 01:20:05,330
if you were going to,
we want to take Lance Armstrong's medals

1795
01:20:05,331 --> 01:20:06,410
away.
He was like,

1796
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:08,370
if you took away every award

1797
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:13,600
or prize that you give to people for 
something that they did while they were 

1798
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,940
on drugs and there would be no grammys.
It's true.

1799
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:15,930
Right?
That's true.

1800
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,700
Well,
Bill Hicks had that great joke about it.

1801
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:21,300
You know,
you know that I'm about drugs,

1802
01:20:21,301 --> 01:20:22,590
about every,
you know,

1803
01:20:22,591 --> 01:20:27,090
if you want to stop drugs,
like take all your albums and throw them

1804
01:20:27,091 --> 01:20:28,680
away.
If you hate drugs.

1805
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:32,520
All those great songs and led Zeppelin,
the doors,

1806
01:20:32,521 --> 01:20:33,690
all that shit.
They were on drugs.

1807
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,780
They're on drugs.
What do you think about about doping?

1808
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,250
Cause I think like so.
All Right Lance,

1809
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:43,280
glad you brought this up because Jeff 
Novitsky who busted Lance Armstrong is 

1810
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,941
going to be on my podcast.
He was hired by the ultimate fighting 

1811
01:20:46,941 --> 01:20:50,541
championship.
The UFC is trying to clear up the sport 

1812
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:53,480
and they're trying to clean it up by 
hiring the most knowledgeable anti 

1813
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:53,970
doping guy ever.

1814
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:58,170
The guy who busted the ball co scandal 
and Lance Armstrong and all that stuff.

1815
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:01,620
I had the most fascinating conversation 
with him in Brazil.

1816
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:06,830
We were at a bar and we were talking for
over an hour about all the different 

1817
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:08,730
methods that they're using now to get 
away with.

1818
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,800
That's my man.
Great Guy.

1819
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:15,860
Really enjoy talking to him and he'll be
on soon and really empathetic and 

1820
01:21:16,021 --> 01:21:21,021
sympathetic guy and you know,
he's not like some evil person is just 

1821
01:21:21,021 --> 01:21:25,230
like some fucking Jack Law here to take 
down the criminals.

1822
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,890
He's uh,
he's the guy who was sort of seeing both

1823
01:21:28,891 --> 01:21:33,891
sides of it and that's one of the way,
one of the reasons why the people 

1824
01:21:33,891 --> 01:21:35,220
cooperated with him to kind of go after 
Lance Armstrong.

1825
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:37,350
Yeah.
So people will say like,

1826
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:38,300
all right,
well lance,

1827
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:43,350
you know,
that was the reason why it's bet what 

1828
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:43,440
Lance Armstrong did is bad is because 
it's on a fair.

1829
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:45,720
Well,
Lebron James is.

1830
01:21:45,721 --> 01:21:48,000
Genetics is unfair,
right?

1831
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:53,060
I mean the fact that I now feel better 
after having two cups of coffee then I 

1832
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:54,120
did an hour ago is unfair be too.
Yeah,

1833
01:21:54,121 --> 01:21:59,121
I mean I'm jet lagged and Shit,
but I have a two cups of coffee and for 

1834
01:21:59,121 --> 01:22:02,991
Alpha brands and I'm kicking right in.
How different is that stuff from 

1835
01:22:02,991 --> 01:22:02,991
adderall?
I mean,

1836
01:22:02,991 --> 01:22:04,460
isn't it all just degrees?
Like maybe we should just a lamp.

1837
01:22:04,690 --> 01:22:07,290
Why maybe we should just allowed doping?
Um,

1838
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:12,291
I think to a certain extent,
I think one of the real problems with 

1839
01:22:12,291 --> 01:22:14,421
Lance Armstrong said he was suing people
that we're accurately talking about his 

1840
01:22:14,421 --> 01:22:19,071
drug use because they got busted and he 
was going after them and trying to ruin 

1841
01:22:19,071 --> 01:22:19,071
them.
He's a,

1842
01:22:19,071 --> 01:22:21,630
an absolutely and a liar at just a 
pathological liar,

1843
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:22,680
deceiver.
But that's.

1844
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:25,620
But that's less interesting I think.
Then the question of like whether or not

1845
01:22:25,621 --> 01:22:30,621
the laws that he broke should be against
the rules that he broke should be 

1846
01:22:30,621 --> 01:22:33,320
against the rules in the first place,
but I agree with that and also there's 

1847
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:33,690
also an argument that the Tour de 
France,

1848
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,780
notice how I said France and that was 
very impressed.

1849
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:41,780
I'm very,
very good at the misspelling ties with 

1850
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:44,191
the one they say that that race is so 
grueling.

1851
01:22:44,221 --> 01:22:47,100
There's an argument that it's actually 
healthier to do with drugs.

1852
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:52,640
That doing it with drugs actually allows
your body to recuperate in a way that 

1853
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:56,871
you would be breaking it down and you 
would be susceptible to rhabdomyolysis.

1854
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:02,760
You know?
That's that thing that those crossfit 

1855
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:02,760
people get.
Start pissing looks like diet coke,

1856
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:03,660
you know?
Have you ever seen it?

1857
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:04,270
No,
I don't.

1858
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:05,470
Oh my God.
It's awful.

1859
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,600
When when people have a breakdown of 
their muscle tissue and then your,

1860
01:23:10,971 --> 01:23:11,630
your,
your,

1861
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:14,920
your body starts processing it and it 
comes out in your urine.

1862
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:20,100
Like ultra marathon runners have it.
I have a buddy who runs ultra marathons 

1863
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:20,740
and he says,
when you done you pee,

1864
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:25,950
it's black like soda or like coffee,
it's awful and it's just your body's 

1865
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:27,220
just,
your kidneys are malfunctioning.

1866
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:30,130
Everything's just shutting down.
Not The fittest guy in the world,

1867
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:31,570
but uh,
and I'm not proud of that.

1868
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:36,630
Are you sure?
I am not the fittest guy in the 

1869
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:36,630
wheelchair and tested yourself.
I have not tested myself.

1870
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:37,600
I could be.
That's a very good point Mike,

1871
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:42,670
be.
But I think if you're doing as string 

1872
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:44,110
and all,
if you're running marathons,

1873
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:45,850
good for you,
good for you America.

1874
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:51,030
But if you pissing black,
your body's telling you that you 

1875
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:51,220
shouldn't be doing that.
Well,

1876
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:56,250
what they're doing is they're just 
trying to push past all the pain and 

1877
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:59,731
discomfort and show mental toughness.
And that's what's supposed to be 

1878
01:23:59,731 --> 01:23:59,731
inspiring is that,
you know,

1879
01:23:59,731 --> 01:24:00,620
this guy ran like my buddy,
uh,

1880
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:04,990
Cameron Hanes,
he ran 106 miles in 24 hours,

1881
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:10,380
does a 24 hour race where you had a one 
mile course and he did it a hundred and 

1882
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:11,890
six times in 24 hours.

1883
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:14,920
He and he came in fourth place,
didn't even fucking win.

1884
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:18,950
Some dude ran like 120 something miles.
This is insane.

1885
01:24:18,951 --> 01:24:20,650
And he said it's crazy.
How can you combine them all?

1886
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:23,380
I don't know,
animals that's like,

1887
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,660
I mean,
they got beat by a chick too.

1888
01:24:25,661 --> 01:24:27,310
I think a chick came in third place.
Well,

1889
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,500
she's definitely on the juice.
You never know.

1890
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,330
Uh,
I mean just being angry,

1891
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:36,610
you know,
running on the fuel of eight,

1892
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:42,320
they're almost equivalent of 50 iron man
triathlons in 50 days in 50 states to 

1893
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,470
promote fitness among youth.
Oh my God.

1894
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,410
But is that fitness is.
I mean,

1895
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:48,160
are you actually doing good for 
yourself?

1896
01:24:48,161 --> 01:24:53,161
If you know 50 triathlons in 50 days?
Well his body has the capacity to do 

1897
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:56,110
that kind of work and my body doesn't.
So the argument is,

1898
01:24:56,111 --> 01:24:58,720
and he's getting more fit,
you're better than me,

1899
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:03,400
is the argument is that his body is more
fit than the average person's body,

1900
01:25:03,401 --> 01:25:05,200
but he's definitely not doing a service.

1901
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,180
Like my friend who did it,
Cameron,

1902
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:10,120
he did it a couple months ago and he 
said he hasn't recovered yet,

1903
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,730
so he's still hasn't recovered.
He said when he runs,

1904
01:25:12,731 --> 01:25:14,470
like he still runs,
but when he runs he's like,

1905
01:25:14,471 --> 01:25:17,680
you still feeling that he's not back to 
baseline to where he was.

1906
01:25:17,681 --> 01:25:18,760
His times were off.
He's,

1907
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:20,980
he's exhausted and he didn't even come 
first.

1908
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:22,030
No second.
His legs,

1909
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:27,420
his legs swelled up.
He said almost twice the size they 

1910
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:27,420
normally are.
Yeah.

1911
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,680
Fuck all that.
Yeah.

1912
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,200
I'm happy here.
I'm going to open a BA pretty soon.

1913
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:33,760
We got whiskey,
man.

1914
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:37,930
We can just go hard right now.
Let's spark up a joint and have a drink.

1915
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:41,380
I would definitely have it be.
I think you want a beer?

1916
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:43,630
Yeah.
Beer.

1917
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:44,830
That'd be one.
A couple of beers.

1918
01:25:44,831 --> 01:25:45,250
Great.
Look,

1919
01:25:45,251 --> 01:25:45,880
it's five.
10.

1920
01:25:45,881 --> 01:25:48,520
I'm Australian.
If as soon as the clock ticks five.

1921
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,590
Every Australian has to stop drinking.
Yeah,

1922
01:25:50,591 --> 01:25:52,360
I'll have us there too as well.
That sounds good.

1923
01:25:52,361 --> 01:25:54,340
It's the law.
We've got a few good ones.

1924
01:25:54,341 --> 01:25:54,960
We've got that.
Uh,

1925
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:58,300
what does that butte like a dark beer.
Black Butte port.

1926
01:25:58,690 --> 01:25:59,800
Yeah.
I love that stuff.

1927
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:00,920
Yeah.
Um,

1928
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:01,380
I,
yeah,

1929
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,980
I think it's a real good argument

1930
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,980
that coffee is a stimulant and that 
stimulant helps and if that helps why 

1931
01:26:09,471 --> 01:26:14,471
not adderall.
And also marijuana allows you to see 

1932
01:26:14,471 --> 01:26:18,341
things in a different way and if you can
do that and maybe write something 

1933
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:19,550
better,
marijuana helped you write that thing.

1934
01:26:19,551 --> 01:26:23,570
That's not exactly just your creativity.
It's also the marijuana.

1935
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:28,680
Yeah,
and the weird thing is when there are 

1936
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,020
drugs that are not actually performance 
enhancing but are also banned,

1937
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:31,990
like marijuana will be banned in 
sportswear.

1938
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,940
It clearly wouldn't actually give you an
advantage,

1939
01:26:33,941 --> 01:26:38,941
but like which ones I don't have any 
kind of athletic sport is probably not 

1940
01:26:38,941 --> 01:26:38,941
going to be enhanced by meryl

1941
01:26:38,941 --> 01:26:40,860
and it was actually what you're wrong.
They're actually showing,

1942
01:26:40,861 --> 01:26:44,280
especially ultra marathon runners,
they're showing that marijuana does have

1943
01:26:44,281 --> 01:26:46,410
a significant impact on ultra marathon

1944
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:48,630
runners,
not just about coordination sports.

1945
01:26:48,631 --> 01:26:49,240
What about,
you know,

1946
01:26:49,241 --> 01:26:50,880
playing soccer or something and put them
out sweet.

1947
01:26:51,070 --> 01:26:51,250
Better

1948
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,000
too.
That's where it's crazy.

1949
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:53,820
No,
would you?

1950
01:26:53,821 --> 01:26:56,010
Jitsu is a big one.
Jujitsu.

1951
01:26:56,011 --> 01:26:57,120
It's really,
really,

1952
01:26:57,121 --> 01:27:00,210
really common for Jujitsu guys to train 
on marijuana.

1953
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:05,660
A matter of fact,
I'm better at Jujitsu when I do 

1954
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:06,910
marijuana than I am when I'm sober.
How high can I still be bad?

1955
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,450
High as fuck.
Really high as fuck to the point where I

1956
01:27:09,451 --> 01:27:11,780
can't even demonstrate techniques.
Like I try to forget.

1957
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:13,880
I forget how it works or didn't work.
See,

1958
01:27:13,881 --> 01:27:14,730
I'm uh,
when I,

1959
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:17,370
when you're in it.
See when you're sparring.

1960
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:19,680
The idea about sparring is okay,
we've got this stuff.

1961
01:27:19,681 --> 01:27:20,990
This is from New Mexico.
This

1962
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:22,830
really good.
You can take it.

1963
01:27:22,831 --> 01:27:27,831
Yeah,
I'll try the new one because I know in 

1964
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:27,831
new castle and I know.
So I'll try.

1965
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:27,831
Thanks Jamie.
Um,

1966
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:28,000
but

1967
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:32,850
the idea is that it allows you to get to
this sort of zen state where you flow.

1968
01:27:32,851 --> 01:27:37,851
So the things you already know,
they think it's not that good for the 

1969
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:37,851
learning stuff,
but it's actually.

1970
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:38,820
I'll thank you sir.
What a gentleman.

1971
01:27:38,821 --> 01:27:41,190
He opens his,
he opens one and hands it to me and then

1972
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,720
he gets his own.
What a good man.

1973
01:27:42,870 --> 01:27:44,280
I do what I was raised,
right joe?

1974
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,630
You were sir.
You were.

1975
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:51,170
The idea is that it's not good at 
learning stuff because it just goes in 

1976
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:54,381
and out,
but the stuff that you already know 

1977
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:54,690
that's in your system that you already 
have trained down,

1978
01:27:54,691 --> 01:27:56,280
you know,
it's like a part of your.

1979
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:02,120
So it's almost muscle memory in a way 
that doesn't require a lot of cognitive 

1980
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:02,120
effort.
Yeah,

1981
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:02,780
like tennis players,

1982
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:05,310
apparently fine marijuana helps them 
significantly as well.

1983
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:08,190
Recreational tennis players would tell 
you when they get really high,

1984
01:28:08,430 --> 01:28:11,790
they kind of like see the ball better.
They can move pool players.

1985
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:16,910
It's a huge thing with pool with people 
you can feel where the ball's going 

1986
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:17,220
better.
The guys who play,

1987
01:28:17,221 --> 01:28:20,310
they say it gives them like a 10,
20 percent advantage when they,

1988
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:20,840
when they smell it.

1989
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I think there are different types of 
people who respond to the drug 

1990
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:26,000
differently of course,
because I mean,

1991
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I,
I'm not a huge pot smoker.

1992
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,570
I'll have it occasionally.
Uh,

1993
01:28:27,571 --> 01:28:30,690
I can only have like a very small amount
just so I get that buzz.

1994
01:28:30,691 --> 01:28:35,691
If I have too much,
I start to get scattered and like 

1995
01:28:35,691 --> 01:28:35,880
paranoid and just like I can't focus,
I can't do things.

1996
01:28:35,881 --> 01:28:40,881
I kind of can be creative.
I can't follow the plot of like 

1997
01:28:40,881 --> 01:28:43,340
television shows and stuff it.
Whereas I know I've got tons of friends 

1998
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:43,470
who are like,
well that's not me.

1999
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:49,190
Yeah,
well they probably swung a lot of pot 

2000
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:49,190
to.
Yeah,

2001
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:49,860
that's probably true.
The tolerance thing that's real and also

2002
01:28:49,861 --> 01:28:54,861
the acceptance of the experience.
I think when you fight the experience 

2003
01:28:54,861 --> 01:28:57,870
like Oh high and that's where paranoia 
comes in.

2004
01:28:57,871 --> 01:29:02,140
And also I think paranoia is also one of
the things that does is it

2005
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:05,280
lowers the boundaries that we put up in 
order to get things done.

2006
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,580
Like we have boundaries.
Like there's a sort of blinders that you

2007
01:29:08,581 --> 01:29:13,581
put on that allow you to get through 
your job and get in your car and drive 

2008
01:29:13,581 --> 01:29:16,140
home to your family and not consider the
massive amount of variables at the world

2009
01:29:16,141 --> 01:29:19,680
creates or that the world presents and 
also space.

2010
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,770
The fact that you're on a fucking giant,
24,000

2011
01:29:22,771 --> 01:29:27,771
mile round ball that's going a thousand 
miles an hour in a circle and hurling 

2012
01:29:27,771 --> 01:29:32,091
through infinity when he smoked pot,
it sort of unveils all of these 

2013
01:29:32,091 --> 01:29:33,930
possibilities and potentials and it 
freaks people out.

2014
01:29:34,430 --> 01:29:35,900
Well,
I don't get freaked out by that.

2015
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:37,110
I mean,
what you're describing,

2016
01:29:37,111 --> 01:29:39,010
you're not taking enough,
but that said,

2017
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:40,150
well,
maybe you will.

2018
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,060
Maybe I just needed a better dealer or 
something.

2019
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:44,140
Yeah,
sure.

2020
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,040
I don't want to take it on the plane,
the uh,

2021
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:48,400
but,
um,

2022
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:51,550
smell this and we'll get you high.
Are you,

2023
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:55,670
are you allowed to have this as this 
medicinal last patient I have.

2024
01:29:55,910 --> 01:29:56,930
Wow.
That smells great.

2025
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,390
Beautiful flowers.
What your,

2026
01:29:58,580 --> 01:30:01,910
what you're talking about there in terms
of the doors of perception being kind of

2027
01:30:01,911 --> 01:30:03,370
shut down.
Yeah.

2028
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:06,830
During normal behavior strikes me as 
more of a psychedelic thing.

2029
01:30:06,831 --> 01:30:11,831
I mean,
I've had some of the most in like 

2030
01:30:11,831 --> 01:30:11,831
insightful experiences of my entire 
life.

2031
01:30:11,831 --> 01:30:16,331
I don't do them anymore,
but when I was in my late teens and 

2032
01:30:16,331 --> 01:30:18,791
early twenties doing acid or mushrooms 
and having that sense of sudden complete

2033
01:30:19,401 --> 01:30:23,840
awareness that you are on a rock that's 
going around this star on the outer edge

2034
01:30:23,841 --> 01:30:27,540
of a spiral galaxy in a cosmos that is 
so vast that you,

2035
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:32,890
you cannot comprehend it and we have 
evolved as a species to not comprehend 

2036
01:30:34,041 --> 01:30:39,041
it and to not focus on it all the time 
because if we actually thought about 

2037
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:41,180
where we are and what we're doing and 
how many things could be thrown at us at

2038
01:30:41,181 --> 01:30:42,740
any point in,
in time,

2039
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:44,270
we'd go crazy.

2040
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:48,530
You wouldn't even bother like aiding.
You wouldn't buy like working and eating

2041
01:30:48,531 --> 01:30:49,970
anymore because everything would seem 
so,

2042
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:52,220
so kind of trivial.
Yeah.

2043
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:57,280
Does to many people.
I have a lot of friends in the quote 

2044
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,341
unquote psychedelic community that lived
their lives around the time they do 

2045
01:31:00,951 --> 01:31:03,410
psychedelics and then the downtime in 
between.

2046
01:31:03,411 --> 01:31:08,411
There were the sort of processing it and
gearing up for their next psychedelic 

2047
01:31:08,411 --> 01:31:11,591
trip and for them it's just that's their
life.

2048
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:14,000
That's a part of their life.
Like those,

2049
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:19,090
those crazy trips and those realizations
that is a significant part of their 

2050
01:31:19,090 --> 01:31:21,260
existence and what's make makes life 
wonderful to them.

2051
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:22,940
And then there's people like you that 
say,

2052
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:23,930
Hey,
I did it before,

2053
01:31:23,931 --> 01:31:24,950
I don't do it anymore.

2054
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:30,340
Yeah.
Well I mean I wonder if there are also 

2055
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:33,170
like non drug related ways of getting 
there.

2056
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:38,200
Like I,
I know this guy got out or a pendant 

2057
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:38,200
Dusa who's a,
a Hindu chaplain.

2058
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:41,750
He's the first Hindu chaplain of a 
Columbia University and yeah.

2059
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:42,620
So he

2060
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:46,580
hinduism as a religion.
But a chaplain.

2061
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:49,060
Yeah.
Which I guess is the religious authority

2062
01:31:49,061 --> 01:31:49,900
at the university.

2063
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:51,830
Okay.
So it's a designation by the.

2064
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:53,210
The university.
Yeah,

2065
01:31:53,230 --> 01:31:56,140
but he's just a Hindu spiritual teacher 
in New York.

2066
01:31:56,141 --> 01:31:59,770
Lovely guy.
And he is just know you can.

2067
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:01,660
It's like the Dalai Lama or something.
Right.

2068
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:05,530
You can just sense this awareness of 
like him just being on another plane.

2069
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:10,660
He is not bothered by the same trivial 
stuff that distracts us.

2070
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:15,820
He is clearly communing with some kind 
of level of existence that is beyond the

2071
01:32:15,821 --> 01:32:18,640
material.
And I think that that is sort of similar

2072
01:32:18,641 --> 01:32:22,690
to the mindset that you can get into 
with psychedelics.

2073
01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:27,790
Well,
I think yoga can take you there if you 

2074
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:27,800
do the right kind of yoga.
I do hot yoga,

2075
01:32:27,801 --> 01:32:30,680
like a [inaudible] type hot yoga and 
it's great for the body.

2076
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:33,020
It was really is great for relaxation.
Like to me,

2077
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:38,500
my on some things happening.
Like when I do a lot of yoga I was 

2078
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:38,500
talking about,
I got in a car accident,

2079
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:41,180
somebody rear ended my expensive Germans
porche car and I,

2080
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:42,040
I,
you know,

2081
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:43,640
I asked are you okay?
Everything okay.

2082
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:45,020
And I wasn't even mad at him,
you know,

2083
01:32:45,021 --> 01:32:50,021
I should've been probably upset that 
this guy wasn't paying attention or 

2084
01:32:50,021 --> 01:32:53,111
texting or whatever the fuck it was and 
slammed into my car and cost me a 

2085
01:32:53,111 --> 01:32:53,111
shitload of money.
But I wasn't.

2086
01:32:53,111 --> 01:32:55,880
And I attribute it to doing a lot of 
yoga that week.

2087
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:58,700
I think it calms you down.
I think there's something.

2088
01:32:58,701 --> 01:33:03,701
I mean there's a reason why those skinny
Indian dudes have been doing that shit 

2089
01:33:03,701 --> 01:33:03,701
for thousands of years.

2090
01:33:03,701 --> 01:33:04,790
I don't think they'd just been.
It's just like a hobby.

2091
01:33:04,970 --> 01:33:07,820
And they just stuck with it,
but Kundalini Yoga,

2092
01:33:07,821 --> 01:33:12,821
which I don't practice,
but I have friends that do and I have a 

2093
01:33:12,821 --> 01:33:14,060
friend who teaches it in boulder and 
she's,

2094
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:14,900
she's,
uh,

2095
01:33:14,901 --> 01:33:19,310
a firm advocate of achieving psychedelic
states through this practice.

2096
01:33:19,311 --> 01:33:24,311
You get up at 4:00
in the morning and you do these 

2097
01:33:24,311 --> 01:33:26,981
breathing exercises and you want to sit 
in a certain direction and it's all like

2098
01:33:27,411 --> 01:33:32,411
very ritualistic,
but it's also based on the idea of the 

2099
01:33:32,411 --> 01:33:35,500
circadian cycle.
You sort of interrupt your sleep cycle 

2100
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:38,741
and the cycle of the earth and you,
you do these stimulation exercises that 

2101
01:33:38,741 --> 01:33:43,741
supposedly a activate your pineal gland,
which is the gland that's been proven to

2102
01:33:43,911 --> 01:33:48,911
produce dimethyltryptamine,
which is the most potent psychedelic 

2103
01:33:48,911 --> 01:33:52,151
drug known to man.
And it's related in many ways to 

2104
01:33:52,151 --> 01:33:55,871
psychedelic mushrooms.
They're very similar in their chemical 

2105
01:33:55,871 --> 01:33:56,600
composition.
And we know that,

2106
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:57,590
you know,
these,

2107
01:33:57,860 --> 01:34:00,200
these psychedelic drugs that the brain 
produces.

2108
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:04,480
If you can take them and you extract 
them from plants and every,

2109
01:34:04,490 --> 01:34:05,870
the existence,
thousands of plants.

2110
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:10,010
You have these insanely profound 
visionary experiences.

2111
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:15,250
She says that you can achieve these 
states through meditation and through 

2112
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:15,250
Kundalini Yoga.

2113
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:18,820
I don't doubt that I don't get out or a 
bill,

2114
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:20,650
you know,
he meditates two or three hours a day.

2115
01:34:20,651 --> 01:34:24,190
That would probably explain why he is 
the type of person that he is.

2116
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:27,010
And you get into weird places when you 
do that.

2117
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:28,180
Well,
I do a,

2118
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:30,630
I do a lot of meditation in an isolation
tank.

2119
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:33,750
I have an isolation to wanting to do.
Dude.

2120
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:36,420
I can hook it up and tell me when you 
tell me when I'll look it up.

2121
01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:36,810
Like,
well,

2122
01:34:36,811 --> 01:34:39,290
I'm not here.
I was so connected to this,

2123
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,430
this,
this community community.

2124
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:41,640
Yep.

2125
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:43,020
Put me in touch with someone in New York
City.

2126
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:44,250
Had a good good.
There must be good.

2127
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:45,060
Outfit out

2128
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,880
the word right now and we will get 
messages on twitter.

2129
01:34:47,881 --> 01:34:49,380
I guarantee you there's places in New 
York.

2130
01:34:49,970 --> 01:34:52,320
When I started talking about this about 
10 years ago,

2131
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:54,150
a little bit more,
maybe like 2002.

2132
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:55,860
Um,
there were very few of these.

2133
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:57,500
Now they're all over the country and

2134
01:34:58,110 --> 01:35:02,480
me making videos and talking about it.
I've had one in my basement when I first

2135
01:35:02,481 --> 01:35:04,130
started talking about it,
the float lab,

2136
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:05,690
where I got mine from,
which is in Venice,

2137
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:10,220
which is the finest float tanks in the 
world next to this guy in Austin.

2138
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:15,221
I was also has amazing one,
but they were basically like almost on 

2139
01:35:15,221 --> 01:35:16,850
the verge of going out of business.
Now they're opening up new locations,

2140
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:19,790
new locations all over the country,
all over the world.

2141
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:22,550
In fact,
a lot of them they have as their option,

2142
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:27,551
like how did you learn about this?
Joe Rogan is like one of the options 

2143
01:35:27,551 --> 01:35:27,800
because I talk about it so much.
That's great.

2144
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:29,630
I just,
I just think it should be something that

2145
01:35:29,631 --> 01:35:31,260
everybody should do.
I think it's.

2146
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:35,960
It's an amazing form of meditation.
It's amazing relaxation for your body.

2147
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:40,961
It's an incredible way for your body to 
get magnesium because it absorbs it 

2148
01:35:40,961 --> 01:35:40,961
through the,
through the skin,

2149
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,290
the epsom salts.

2150
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:47,560
It's one of the best ways that your body
can absorb magnesium and it's a hugely 

2151
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:51,221
important for muscle recovery and for 
your health and wellness and relaxation.

2152
01:35:51,471 --> 01:35:53,310
It's an incredible experience.
All right.

2153
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:54,500
You heard it here.
If you look,

2154
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:57,170
if you are a float tank person,
I'm going to New York.

2155
01:35:57,710 --> 01:35:58,940
We're gonna.
Hook it up 100 percent.

2156
01:35:58,941 --> 01:35:59,850
I'm going to put out the word.
Awesome.

2157
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:01,550
We'll put it out on twitter.
Bam.

2158
01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:03,490
Yeah,
that's my tank.

2159
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,420
Yeah.
That's the video that we made.

2160
01:36:05,421 --> 01:36:06,590
A huge.
Yeah,

2161
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:07,520
they use me.
Yeah.

2162
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:08,300
Oh,
there we go.

2163
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,190
That's perfect.
I don't even know these people.

2164
01:36:10,191 --> 01:36:11,600
That's New York.
Okay.

2165
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:12,470
There you go.
Great.

2166
01:36:12,471 --> 01:36:15,380
Okay,
so New York aspire.com

2167
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:16,730
flotation.
Hey,

2168
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:20,180
how about you reach out to my buddy josh
steps and hook them up.

2169
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:21,980
If you listen to,
we reach out to me,

2170
01:36:21,981 --> 01:36:26,981
send an email to info@wtplive.com
and I could use a little posts about 

2171
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:27,650
stockers are going to say,
yeah,

2172
01:36:27,651 --> 01:36:32,651
this is the place,
if they're going to give you the 

2173
01:36:32,651 --> 01:36:32,651
address,
but fortunately said who will go through

2174
01:36:32,651 --> 01:36:32,651
that?

2175
01:36:32,651 --> 01:36:36,970
It's going to be plastic all over the 
floor and it goes some fucking dexter 

2176
01:36:36,970 --> 01:36:36,970
house.
Uh,

2177
01:36:36,970 --> 01:36:41,290
when we were talking about the size of 
the cosmos and how mindblowing all of 

2178
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:41,660
that is,
it reminded me,

2179
01:36:41,690 --> 01:36:46,690
did you see about this Russian 
billionaire who has just invested 

2180
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:46,860
$100,000,000?
Yeah.

2181
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:49,080
Yeah.
Not,

2182
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:50,330
not to talk,
to listen,

2183
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:53,090
to listen in.
He just needs mushrooms.

2184
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:58,120
You can meet aliens in an hour,
an hour and 20 minutes so you could be 

2185
01:36:58,120 --> 01:36:59,800
there.
So he's got like Stephen Hawking and all

2186
01:36:59,801 --> 01:37:04,801
these amazing people on board to.
It's the biggest injection of cash to 

2187
01:37:04,801 --> 01:37:09,101
the,
of the search for extraterrestrial 

2188
01:37:09,101 --> 01:37:09,101
intelligence in history.
I think a guy like hockings just like,

2189
01:37:09,101 --> 01:37:09,590
okay,
look,

2190
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:11,120
if you want to throw some money at 
science,

2191
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:11,540
you know,
I mean,

2192
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:13,730
that's really what it is.
It's just science.

2193
01:37:13,731 --> 01:37:15,470
I mean,
if you want innovation,

2194
01:37:15,471 --> 01:37:16,310
you want to.
I mean,

2195
01:37:16,311 --> 01:37:16,880
it's great.

2196
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,920
It's a great thing.
I personally think that there's,

2197
01:37:20,010 --> 01:37:22,830
there's two very distinct possibilities.
What,

2198
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:27,880
I mean there's many,
but there's two that I consider all the 

2199
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:27,880
time.
One of them is that this is it,

2200
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:29,900
that what we have achieved is 
exceedingly rare,

2201
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:35,020
incredibly rare.
And that if the universe is 13 point 7 

2202
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:36,050
billion years old or whatever the fuck 
it is when it started,

2203
01:37:36,051 --> 01:37:41,051
then it's entirely possible that it took
this long for something to come out of 

2204
01:37:41,051 --> 01:37:45,281
it like us and that we are at the front 
of the line of the idea of conscious 

2205
01:37:46,701 --> 01:37:51,701
life where the only thing that we know 
of on this whole planet that's not just 

2206
01:37:51,701 --> 01:37:55,571
conscious but conscious and manipulates 
its environment to the point where we 

2207
01:37:55,571 --> 01:37:56,070
can change the weather.
We can do all

2208
01:37:56,070 --> 01:38:01,070
kinds of crazy shit.
Like send videos all to Australia 

2209
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:01,350
instantaneously.
If you're in Australia and I'm here,

2210
01:38:01,570 --> 01:38:06,570
you can send me a text message with a 
photograph of you smiling and I'll get 

2211
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:06,570
it in a couple of seconds.
Oh,

2212
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:07,770
we could be having the same conversation
we're having right now.

2213
01:38:08,570 --> 01:38:09,650
Yeah.
Really,

2214
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:12,630
really clearly.
And that's just madness.

2215
01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:17,650
That's madness.
I think it is entirely possible that we 

2216
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:20,550
are as advanced as intelligent life has 
ever gotten ever in the entire universe.

2217
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:25,730
And that all of our searching and 
longing is really just some Alpha 

2218
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:27,690
chimpanzee thing where we're always 
looking for the daddy.

2219
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:32,870
You know,
it might be a god or it might be a king 

2220
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:33,720
or it might be a guru or something.
We're always looking for someone to show

2221
01:38:33,721 --> 01:38:35,460
us the way because we know we don't know
the way

2222
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:40,910
it's possible.
It's entirely possible that that's the 

2223
01:38:40,910 --> 01:38:40,910
case.
Um,

2224
01:38:40,910 --> 01:38:44,210
and you're right,
that life got started here pretty much 

2225
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:47,331
as quickly as it could and it evolved 
into our sort of level of consciousness 

2226
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:51,900
as quickly as you would expect it to 
given natural selection.

2227
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:53,790
So it's true that we could be at the 
beginning,

2228
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:54,990
you know,
we could be sort of the,

2229
01:38:55,430 --> 01:39:00,430
the,
the first intelligent conscious species 

2230
01:39:00,430 --> 01:39:01,650
in the cosmos,
but the fact that life got kicked off so

2231
01:39:01,651 --> 01:39:06,000
quickly and the fact that we emerged so 
comparatively quickly might also suggest

2232
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:09,690
that it's woven into the fabric of the 
cosmos.

2233
01:39:09,691 --> 01:39:11,730
That this is a [inaudible].
If it was a really,

2234
01:39:11,731 --> 01:39:12,300
really,
really,

2235
01:39:12,301 --> 01:39:13,590
really,
really rare thing,

2236
01:39:13,591 --> 01:39:18,591
then you would have expected the earth 
to be a dead gaseous bowl for billions 

2237
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:20,220
of years.
Many,

2238
01:39:20,221 --> 01:39:21,870
many more billions of years.
And it was.

2239
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:23,400
So.
I'm not convinced by that.

2240
01:39:23,401 --> 01:39:28,401
And I think also you might be 
underestimating just how mindbogglingly 

2241
01:39:28,401 --> 01:39:31,560
huge the cosmos is and how little access
to it we have,

2242
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:35,430
like the fact that we haven't found 
anything yet doesn't mean anything.

2243
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,640
I mean there are a hundred billion 
stars,

2244
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:39,690
Justin,
our galaxy.

2245
01:39:39,691 --> 01:39:42,480
So there are a hundred billion suns,
Justin,

2246
01:39:42,481 --> 01:39:47,481
our galaxy,
and there are billions of galaxies in 

2247
01:39:47,481 --> 01:39:50,601
the universe.
Every single style that we see in the 

2248
01:39:50,601 --> 01:39:51,630
night sky is inside our galaxy.
And of course that's only a tiny,

2249
01:39:51,631 --> 01:39:56,631
tiny,
tiny fraction of our little corner of 

2250
01:39:56,631 --> 01:39:56,631
that galaxy.
And then beyond that galaxy,

2251
01:39:56,631 --> 01:40:00,180
there are innumerable other galaxies.
Like the idea that we are,

2252
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:01,650
as Carl Sagan said,
you know,

2253
01:40:01,651 --> 01:40:06,651
the great scientists,
like if were the only intelligent life 

2254
01:40:06,651 --> 01:40:07,730
in the cosmos,
that is an awfully large backdrop.

2255
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:09,520
Like,
why bother?

2256
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:11,780
Why is it all.
And no one's saying that we're not,

2257
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:12,770
we're the only.
Well,

2258
01:40:12,771 --> 01:40:13,150
the,
the,

2259
01:40:13,151 --> 01:40:18,151
uh,
there also is the theory that the 

2260
01:40:18,151 --> 01:40:20,081
universe is so incredibly large that not
only is there an exact replica of earth 

2261
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:22,490
out there,
but infinity,

2262
01:40:22,491 --> 01:40:23,720
which is what the universe is supposed 
to be.

2263
01:40:23,721 --> 01:40:28,721
Infinite is that not only is there an 
exact version of earth out there,

2264
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:35,080
there's everything that has happened on 
this planet in the exact same order up 

2265
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:40,001
to me touching that microphone right 
there has happened exactly down to the 

2266
01:40:40,001 --> 01:40:44,630
Nanosecond,
an infinite number of times throughout 

2267
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:46,070
space,
like that's how big the universe is,

2268
01:40:46,370 --> 01:40:49,040
but it doesn't mean that someone's ahead
of us.

2269
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:50,900
It doesn't mean that it doesn't mean 
that,

2270
01:40:50,901 --> 01:40:55,901
but it does mean that intelligent is 
very likely scattered throughout the 

2271
01:40:56,021 --> 01:41:01,021
entire cosmos,
but it doesn't necessarily mean that 

2272
01:41:01,021 --> 01:41:03,460
intelligent life has reached a place 
past where we are right now.

2273
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:06,140
It doesn't necessarily mean that,
but if but,

2274
01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:11,590
but I think that you would be well 
advised to believe that it probably has 

2275
01:41:11,590 --> 01:41:14,060
just because the median is usually a 
better assumption then the extremes.

2276
01:41:14,061 --> 01:41:15,030
Right?
So I mean the,

2277
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,300
the likelihood is that we're not at 
either of the,

2278
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:22,540
either of the very,
very extreme that we're not at the very 

2279
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:23,090
first nor the very last civilization.
Just statistically,

2280
01:41:23,091 --> 01:41:28,091
if you were just tossing a coin,
you would expect our civilization to 

2281
01:41:28,091 --> 01:41:29,630
just happen to be clustered somewhere on
a bell curve in roughly the middle.

2282
01:41:29,810 --> 01:41:33,580
That's just a less anomalous statistical
thing to have happened.

2283
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:34,740
Yeah,
most certainly.

2284
01:41:34,741 --> 01:41:36,540
I mean,
I'm definitely not decided on it.

2285
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:40,410
I think it's just a possibility.
It's a possibility that this is it.

2286
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:44,010
This is about a smart as anything has 
ever gotten ever in the entire existence

2287
01:41:44,011 --> 01:41:47,070
of the universe.
That's depressing or not.

2288
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:49,380
Or pretty fucking cool.
Like where the ballers or the universe,

2289
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:51,200
yeah,
maybe this,

2290
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:52,920
uh,
this system that they're going to put up

2291
01:41:52,921 --> 01:41:54,980
with this brush and billion is money.
Uh,

2292
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:57,360
I was looking at the end exactly what 
it's going to be able to do.

2293
01:41:57,361 --> 01:42:00,600
So astronomers,
they're going to be able to examine 1000

2294
01:42:00,601 --> 01:42:05,601
star systems for any sign of as being 
used because apparently radar is a good 

2295
01:42:05,601 --> 01:42:08,000
way of telling that someone is,
is there,

2296
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:13,210
may have invented it,
and it's going to be able to detect a 

2297
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:16,011
laser with the output of an ordinary 100
watt light bulb from $23,000,

2298
01:42:16,921 --> 01:42:21,921
billion miles away.
That's the distance of the nearest 

2299
01:42:21,921 --> 01:42:23,130
stars.
Twenty 3 trillion miles away,

2300
01:42:23,131 --> 01:42:28,131
there'll be able to spot a laser with 
the wattage of an ordinary household 

2301
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:28,980
bulb.

2302
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:34,120
What I was going to say about the other 
possibility is the other possibility is 

2303
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:37,571
what I believe we're heading towards 
right now is that we're heading towards 

2304
01:42:37,571 --> 01:42:41,501
a virtual universe and that we're 
creating something with the possibility 

2305
01:42:41,501 --> 01:42:46,211
of artificial intelligence and the 
possibility of living inside of some 

2306
01:42:46,211 --> 01:42:49,220
artificial reality that they've created 
that your brain interfaces with.

2307
01:42:49,221 --> 01:42:54,221
That there's going to be no need for 
traveling anywhere or no need even for 

2308
01:42:54,221 --> 01:42:57,530
the type of carbon based life 
civilization that we currently enjoy and

2309
01:42:57,710 --> 01:43:02,710
it won't exist anymore,
and then we're going to create 

2310
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:04,000
artificial life and that the artificial 
life is the next stage of evolution.

2311
01:43:04,001 --> 01:43:09,001
And then will we are is some sort of a 
cosmic caterpillar that's going to 

2312
01:43:09,001 --> 01:43:13,031
become a butterfly.
And that's one of the reasons why we're 

2313
01:43:13,031 --> 01:43:15,161
so obsessed with shiny brand new laptops
and innovation and beautiful 

2314
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:20,230
materialistic items,
is that that has the mechanism and the 

2315
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:22,490
fuel behind creating those things.
Our obsession with these newer,

2316
01:43:22,491 --> 01:43:23,750
better,
greater things.

2317
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:25,960
It's fueling the creation of these 
newer,

2318
01:43:25,970 --> 01:43:30,970
better create greater things and they're
ultimately going to lead to artificial 

2319
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:30,970
intelligence.
Yup,

2320
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:31,620
and that's what Elon Musk is.

2321
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:36,980
That was just about to say,
look at what Elon Musk and Stephen 

2322
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:37,340
Hawking is saying about if,
and you know Sam Harris,

2323
01:43:37,341 --> 01:43:42,341
who I know is a friend of yours and I'm 
a huge fan of Sam's and I've spoken to 

2324
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:47,081
him on huffpost live about this with the
idea that we are really not 

2325
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:52,660
understanding the potential of creating 
artificial intelligence systems that 

2326
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:57,431
self improve in a way that they end up 
getting sort of exponentially more self 

2327
01:43:57,431 --> 01:44:01,871
aware until they're actually outsmarting
us and they have in every meaningful 

2328
01:44:01,871 --> 01:44:03,680
sense a sense of their own existence in 
the same way that we might.

2329
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:06,680
In the same way that norm,
that biological intelligence does.

2330
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:10,670
That is going to be a game changer.
The likes of which,

2331
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:15,820
as you say,
I mean maybe biology just gets 

2332
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:16,250
extinguished or maybe we.
Maybe we end up,

2333
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:17,010
I don't know.
It's like,

2334
01:44:17,011 --> 01:44:17,460
you know,
I don't,

2335
01:44:17,461 --> 01:44:22,461
I don't.
I'm kind of agnostic on the question of 

2336
01:44:22,461 --> 01:44:24,821
whether or not we could ever upload our 
consciousness into a silicon based form

2337
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,610
for that.
I'm too dumb to make that.

2338
01:44:27,611 --> 01:44:27,960
Uh,
you know,

2339
01:44:27,961 --> 01:44:32,961
when,
when people start going to the 

2340
01:44:32,961 --> 01:44:36,630
singularity thing,
I had a chance to talk to him for a 

2341
01:44:36,630 --> 01:44:37,300
long,
did an interview with him for Saifai,

2342
01:44:37,301 --> 01:44:42,301
sat down for him with him,
just me and him chatting about this for 

2343
01:44:42,301 --> 01:44:42,301
about an hour and a half.
The end of it.

2344
01:44:42,301 --> 01:44:44,830
I was fairly convinced that it's 
inevitable,

2345
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:49,860
fairly convinced that it's like if you 
look at like the invention of the wheel 

2346
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:54,610
and then you look at the Cadillac that 
we just showed today and,

2347
01:44:54,611 --> 01:44:59,611
or the mosque sake.
The Tesla is new insane Tesla that he 

2348
01:44:59,611 --> 01:45:00,100
has.
It's all electric.

2349
01:45:00,101 --> 01:45:02,950
Goes zero to 60 in less than three 
seconds.

2350
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:04,600
Yes.
Fucking insane.

2351
01:45:04,601 --> 01:45:06,880
These things that we've created,
and these are just the beginning.

2352
01:45:06,881 --> 01:45:08,200
We're not going to stop there.
We're not going to go.

2353
01:45:08,201 --> 01:45:10,450
Yeah.
I think zero to 60 in three seconds.

2354
01:45:10,510 --> 01:45:12,160
That's good.
Let's stop right there.

2355
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:12,870
We're not going to.

2356
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:13,600
What?
I want to stop,

2357
01:45:13,601 --> 01:45:18,601
but isn't there a.
he's making a philosophical case as 

2358
01:45:18,601 --> 01:45:18,601
well,
and,

2359
01:45:18,601 --> 01:45:23,011
and this is why I say I'm agnostic about
it because I did philosophy at 

2360
01:45:23,011 --> 01:45:27,961
university and one of the big thorny 
questions in philosophy of mind is 

2361
01:45:27,961 --> 01:45:32,790
whether or not it's necessary to have 
the biological substructure of a of a 

2362
01:45:32,790 --> 01:45:37,150
brain in order to have a mind.
Could you disentangle those two things?

2363
01:45:37,151 --> 01:45:42,151
Could the experience of me feeling like 
myself and feeling like I'm alive be 

2364
01:45:42,151 --> 01:45:46,981
disentangled from the biological reality
of my physiology and the gray stuff in 

2365
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:51,220
between my ears.
Kurzweil's assumption,

2366
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:54,370
which is basically just taking on faith 
is yes,

2367
01:45:54,371 --> 01:45:59,371
you could disentangle that.
If you could replicate all of the data 

2368
01:45:59,371 --> 01:46:02,161
that's whirring around in my head right 
now as I'm saying these words as I'm 

2369
01:46:02,161 --> 01:46:02,560
sitting here talking to you.
If you could take all of the things that

2370
01:46:02,561 --> 01:46:04,750
are going on,
all the electrical impulses,

2371
01:46:04,751 --> 01:46:06,730
all of those neurons,
all of those synapses,

2372
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,830
and you could replicate that in a 
computer.

2373
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:12,580
Then that computer would be me and it 
would not just seem like me.

2374
01:46:12,730 --> 01:46:15,340
It would feel like me,
like I would be.

2375
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:21,360
I could actually be uploaded to a 
computer and you could kill my body and 

2376
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,620
I would be existing in some really 
meaningful sense.

2377
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:24,580
I would be a model.

2378
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:29,120
I think we're entirely too attached to 
the idea of me or of us.

2379
01:46:29,530 --> 01:46:34,530
I think we're entirely.
You're too attached to the idea of this 

2380
01:46:34,530 --> 01:46:36,881
even being a good structure.
I think we are so entangled with our 

2381
01:46:38,001 --> 01:46:43,001
chimpanzee DNA.
We're so entangled with our our monkey 

2382
01:46:43,001 --> 01:46:47,240
needs that we think that these have.
I would want to be downloaded into a 

2383
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:50,010
computer and that computer would be me 
and I would share all my hopes and fears

2384
01:46:50,011 --> 01:46:51,990
and dreams.
Why the fuck would you want those?

2385
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:56,550
And we're gonna have like youtube haters
that are in our artificial world that we

2386
01:46:56,551 --> 01:46:59,310
created and we're going to recreate them
in the exact same way.

2387
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:04,510
God.
Imagine the trolls when you're actually 

2388
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:04,510
inside the computer,
inside the Matrix.

2389
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:05,280
Well,
that's what I'm selling,

2390
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:10,390
like haters and jealousy and anger and 
misplaced fear and homophobia and the 

2391
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:18,480
the hatred of xenophobia,
all these different bizarre,

2392
01:47:20,110 --> 01:47:23,410
angry things that we have that make up a
human being.

2393
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:28,680
All these nationalism,
all these different strange things that 

2394
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:32,101
we've sort of just become inexorably 
attached to in our culture that we're 

2395
01:47:32,101 --> 01:47:34,090
trying to eradicate,
but we never seem to quite do.

2396
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,850
All of those things are a part of the 
monkey body,

2397
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,490
right?
But that monkey bodies,

2398
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:41,580
what we're trying to save,
we're trying to save that and downloaded

2399
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:46,620
into consciousness.
What if we can purify consciousness and 

2400
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:49,510
remove it from emotion removed from 
biological need and even sex?

2401
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:54,720
You know,
one of the things that freaks me out 

2402
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:54,720
about aliens,
not that I believe in aliens,

2403
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:57,610
but the the iconic image of the alien is
always sexless.

2404
01:47:57,820 --> 01:47:59,920
They're smooth,
they have smooth genitals,

2405
01:48:00,130 --> 01:48:03,370
they have no muscle there,
totally undefined.

2406
01:48:03,370 --> 01:48:06,070
You can't tell what's a male or a female
and they have these enormous heads.

2407
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:11,730
Is it possible that we have this iconic 
image because we kind of know and 

2408
01:48:11,730 --> 01:48:16,441
understand that ultimately the only way 
we're going to transcend this monkey 

2409
01:48:16,441 --> 01:48:20,881
body is to move past all the needs that 
we've sort of automatically associated 

2410
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:26,350
with being alive.
Being alive means,

2411
01:48:26,351 --> 01:48:27,960
you know,
you have to kind of find food.

2412
01:48:27,961 --> 01:48:32,961
I've got to be a prepper.
I got to make sure that I have canned 

2413
01:48:32,961 --> 01:48:32,961
foods and my band water.
What if it goes down?

2414
01:48:32,961 --> 01:48:34,570
I got to stay,
stay alive.

2415
01:48:34,571 --> 01:48:36,010
Stuff.
It's all live.

2416
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:40,330
It's all about the monkey body and 
that's why people want to be sexy.

2417
01:48:40,331 --> 01:48:42,670
I've got to get my lips done.
They're too skinny and one wants a fuck.

2418
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:47,860
You know,
all that crazy shit that people have in 

2419
01:48:47,860 --> 01:48:50,221
their brain is.
A lot of it is monkey body leftover 

2420
01:48:50,221 --> 01:48:50,221
stuff.

2421
01:48:50,221 --> 01:48:54,960
Well,
I think that's an interesting theory 

2422
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,251
about why the alien,
why the model of the cliched alien is 

2423
01:48:56,251 --> 01:48:56,260
like that.
Like a more,

2424
01:48:56,290 --> 01:49:01,290
in other words,
a less advanced conception of humans is 

2425
01:49:01,290 --> 01:49:04,000
like Harrier.
Racism also plays into this,

2426
01:49:04,001 --> 01:49:05,080
right?
Darker skinned,

2427
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:10,260
you know,
with features that are more kind of 

2428
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:10,260
monkey like or something.
Uh,

2429
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:14,200
and then the more advanced conceptions 
of civilization is white man with his 

2430
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:15,670
tools and everything.
If you extend that,

2431
01:49:15,671 --> 01:49:17,200
if you extrapolate from that,
then yeah.

2432
01:49:17,290 --> 01:49:18,730
More hairless,
I suppose,

2433
01:49:18,731 --> 01:49:21,730
less prone to sex,
less driven by animal desire.

2434
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:24,640
It's also,
it's a huge factor in religion.

2435
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:25,870
I think we're,
you know,

2436
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:29,800
religions are so hung up about sex 
because it's what links us,

2437
01:49:29,801 --> 01:49:32,860
it's what makes us animals and they 
don't want to think of us as animals.

2438
01:49:32,861 --> 01:49:34,480
Then when I think of us as being 
defined,

2439
01:49:34,510 --> 01:49:37,630
we are touched by the spark of God in a 
way that no other animal lives according

2440
01:49:37,631 --> 01:49:42,631
to religion.
So you've got to quash six because the 

2441
01:49:42,631 --> 01:49:42,631
and,
and gluttony,

2442
01:49:42,631 --> 01:49:44,600
because those are reminders that we're 
just prime,

2443
01:49:44,601 --> 01:49:44,750
right?

2444
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:46,830
But meanwhile,
the depictions of God,

2445
01:49:46,831 --> 01:49:47,740
he's ripped,

2446
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:51,250
ripped and he's always wearing a robe 
because he's modest.

2447
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:54,220
He's reaching over and touching people.
His fingers go,

2448
01:49:54,221 --> 01:49:57,010
he's got giant traps and what's great,
it's true.

2449
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:01,150
God looks at his son,
his son's looking great on the cross,

2450
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:06,180
beaten to death,
and he's got abs and really watch for a 

2451
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:08,260
dice was for a guy,
was living in the Middle East 2000 years

2452
01:50:08,261 --> 01:50:09,890
ago,
but skin of bronze,

2453
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:12,520
hair of wool,
bullshit.

2454
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:13,210
The,
uh,

2455
01:50:13,390 --> 01:50:16,210
the other possibility of a black planet.
Chuck d was right.

2456
01:50:16,570 --> 01:50:17,140
There you go.
That.

2457
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:18,380
Look at that.
Look at God.

2458
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:23,400
Beautiful.
The dude on the left hind a little 

2459
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:23,400
robbed.
That's what I'm saying,

2460
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,970
not even,
I mean why even draw it?

2461
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,160
You might as well just make him an alien
with no genitals.

2462
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:29,140
People back then just had little or 
Dick's.

2463
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:31,630
Is that possible?
It's possible,

2464
01:50:31,631 --> 01:50:35,490
but I've always just assumed that that 
it's the modesty of the artist like it.

2465
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:40,560
It kind of changed the frame of the 
picture of God reaching down and 

2466
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:44,941
touching men.
If men had a massive schlong just 

2467
01:50:44,941 --> 01:50:44,941
hanging down his leg.
Yeah,

2468
01:50:44,941 --> 01:50:47,230
it would be distracting if you're just 
giant John Holmes Hog,

2469
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,350
but look how big the muscles are in 
these guys.

2470
01:50:50,351 --> 01:50:55,351
Like these guys have to be fucking 
crossfitting all day as well as being 

2471
01:50:55,351 --> 01:51:00,001
divine.
I mean that guy on the left is doing a 

2472
01:51:00,001 --> 01:51:01,180
lot of fucking weightlifting.
That is not a regular body.

2473
01:51:01,420 --> 01:51:04,360
That's a body of someone who's picking 
up heavy shit all day long,

2474
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:06,580
but it's got a skinny neck.
I bet he's never been choked.

2475
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:11,170
Maybe that's not a guy who knows how to 
get out of a choke.

2476
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:15,340
No Little Dick Skinny neck,
but giant fucking biceps,

2477
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:20,670
forearms that does a lot of the.
There's a lot of weight lifting for 

2478
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:23,401
sure.
Michelangelo's ceiling of the Sistine 

2479
01:51:23,401 --> 01:51:25,150
Chapel and look at the bizarre image of 
God being supported by Cherubs.

2480
01:51:26,070 --> 01:51:29,170
So weird people are religion.
Can't see God's Dick Though.

2481
01:51:29,171 --> 01:51:30,180
Notice that.
Nope.

2482
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:33,850
He's got a robot.
That other dummy was little tiny Dick.

2483
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:36,460
God looks kind of.
I haven't really noticed this before,

2484
01:51:36,461 --> 01:51:39,730
but God on the ceiling of the Sistine 
Chapel looks a bit like Meryl Streep.

2485
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:49,510
Meryl Streep with a bad because I think 
he's kind of got breasts and he's,

2486
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:54,540
he's wearing like a nice white robe.
He looks like an old American actor and 

2487
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:57,180
I can't remember his fucking name 
whether it's.

2488
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:59,760
John has a little maybe,
maybe,

2489
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:01,000
maybe.
Anyway,

2490
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:01,850
anyway,
on the,

2491
01:52:01,851 --> 01:52:06,851
uh,
out of just getting better at one girl 

2492
01:52:06,851 --> 01:52:06,851
though.
Hold on,

2493
01:52:06,851 --> 01:52:09,361
go back to that picture.
Look at the one that's in the crook of 

2494
01:52:09,361 --> 01:52:09,361
his elbow.
She's fucking hater.

2495
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:11,140
Hater.
She doesn't like that dude.

2496
01:52:11,530 --> 01:52:12,940
That dude's getting all the love.
She's like,

2497
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:14,920
fuck that shit.
It was a little Dick.

2498
01:52:15,210 --> 01:52:18,100
Look at her face.
She's not filled with love.

2499
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:19,750
She was like,
whatever,

2500
01:52:21,630 --> 01:52:22,710
uh,
on the,

2501
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:27,750
on that question of the evolution of,
of humans creating like maybe,

2502
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:32,110
maybe computers and artificial 
intelligence of the next stage and maybe

2503
01:52:32,111 --> 01:52:37,111
that's maybe the universe is full of 
like artificial intelligence that isn't 

2504
01:52:37,111 --> 01:52:41,521
sending out the signals that we're 
looking for when we're looking for 

2505
01:52:41,521 --> 01:52:41,521
biological intelligence.
Right.

2506
01:52:41,521 --> 01:52:45,240
Maybe they don't need right as anymore.
They don't need to be losing laces 

2507
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:45,240
because they were all in,
in,

2508
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:46,070
in computers.
The

2509
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:51,070
other possibility which is similar to 
that and which is very depressing and 

2510
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:54,491
which I don't particularly like,
is that once a species becomes capable 

2511
01:52:54,491 --> 01:52:57,950
of destroying itself,
that they usually do,

2512
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:00,760
like you can't get beyond like,
no,

2513
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:05,800
you're not responsible enough to be able
to handle the kind of industrial scale 

2514
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:09,760
destruction,
destructive capacity that we now have 

2515
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:10,610
with nuclear weapons and with coal fired
power plants.

2516
01:53:10,611 --> 01:53:15,611
And with all of our ability.
We're so successful as a species that 

2517
01:53:15,611 --> 01:53:17,240
were successful enough to destroy 
ourselves,

2518
01:53:17,241 --> 01:53:22,241
but not yet wise enough not to do so.
And then maybe that's a trap that lots 

2519
01:53:22,241 --> 01:53:26,750
of species fall into as they try to pass
through the crucible of going from being

2520
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:31,810
ordinary animals to hyper-intelligent a 
self self-aware animals,

2521
01:53:32,691 --> 01:53:37,010
but then on the way they invent tools 
that they aren't yet mature enough to be

2522
01:53:37,011 --> 01:53:39,740
able to handle properly and they end up 
wiping themselves out.

2523
01:53:40,010 --> 01:53:41,210
Well,
it's certainly possible.

2524
01:53:41,211 --> 01:53:43,430
And if we look at the universe as being 
infinite,

2525
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:45,920
the infinite possibilities exist as 
well.

2526
01:53:45,921 --> 01:53:50,921
So probably all the pitfalls,
like all the things that we avoid it,

2527
01:53:51,191 --> 01:53:56,191
like the Cuban missile crisis,
maybe they didn't avoid and maybe they 

2528
01:53:56,191 --> 01:53:57,980
were wiped out and maybe they did toxify
their atmosphere to the point where they

2529
01:53:57,981 --> 01:54:02,981
didn't recover for hundreds of thousands
of years and mutants and freaks barely 

2530
01:54:02,981 --> 01:54:03,090
made it by,
you know,

2531
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:06,350
running from hybrid wolves that have 
fucking glowing red eyes.

2532
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,540
Who knows what has been done.
Right?

2533
01:54:08,541 --> 01:54:11,480
So what kind of genetic engineering has 
been done on these planets?

2534
01:54:11,481 --> 01:54:14,240
It's been run amok and fucked everybody 
of the movie.

2535
01:54:14,241 --> 01:54:17,240
Uh,
we in what version of what we've done in

2536
01:54:17,241 --> 01:54:22,241
Australia with foxes and rabbits is out 
of control nature experiments that have 

2537
01:54:23,811 --> 01:54:27,320
really gone all fucked up wolves in 
Idaho that are out of control,

2538
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:32,680
how much of that has been done in these 
other places as well as genetically 

2539
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:34,760
modifying things to the point where it 
doesn't work anymore.

2540
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:36,110
And that's,
that's also possible.

2541
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:41,600
Absolutely.
And what's sort of staggering to me is 

2542
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:44,240
getting an insight into how recently we 
have invented all of this stuff and 

2543
01:54:44,251 --> 01:54:45,940
change the world like this.
Like I was,

2544
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:51,280
I was in Athens during the great 
financial crisis just in the week after 

2545
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:55,701
they had the big no vote was the week 
when it really looked like grace was 

2546
01:54:55,701 --> 01:54:56,370
going to crash out of the eurozone about
what,

2547
01:54:56,371 --> 01:54:58,860
four or five weeks ago.
And uh,

2548
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:01,970
we went to the Acropolis,
the Parthenon because you know,

2549
01:55:01,980 --> 01:55:05,310
that's what you do.
And I was standing there in the museum,

2550
01:55:05,311 --> 01:55:10,311
like looking at all this stuff and I was
struck not so much by how incredibly 

2551
01:55:10,311 --> 01:55:14,991
ancient it is.
Like this is the birthplace of 

2552
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:14,991
civilization,
right?

2553
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:14,991
I mean,
this is where it all began.

2554
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:16,440
This is the birthplace of Western 
civilization basically,

2555
01:55:17,430 --> 01:55:20,580
but I was amazed at how actually 
comparatively recent that is.

2556
01:55:20,610 --> 01:55:22,620
Like I was saying earlier that my 
grandmother just died.

2557
01:55:22,621 --> 01:55:25,650
She was a hundred.
I can conceive of her lifetime.

2558
01:55:25,651 --> 01:55:29,070
Right.
I knew her like that's a long lifetime,

2559
01:55:29,071 --> 01:55:32,130
but it's not inconceivably long as a 
period of time.

2560
01:55:32,190 --> 01:55:33,990
She was born before the roaring 
twenties.

2561
01:55:33,991 --> 01:55:34,980
Think of that.
Yeah.

2562
01:55:35,070 --> 01:55:40,070
She was born in Nineteen 15.
She was born during the Gallipoli 

2563
01:55:40,070 --> 01:55:41,510
campaign in the first world war,
but.

2564
01:55:41,580 --> 01:55:46,580
So anyway,
that's a span time that I can wrap my 

2565
01:55:46,580 --> 01:55:48,981
head around.
You have 30 or 40 of those and you're 

2566
01:55:48,981 --> 01:55:52,641
back at the Acropolis,
right on the banks of the birthplace of 

2567
01:55:52,641 --> 01:55:52,641
Western civilization.
That is not a number.

2568
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:57,860
That's like the hundred billion stars in
the galaxy that I can't wrap my head 

2569
01:55:57,860 --> 01:56:01,820
even begin to wrap my head around.
It's not a number like the billions of 

2570
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:02,070
years that the earth is all that I can't
wrap my head around.

2571
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:04,620
That's a very measurable,
understandable thing.

2572
01:56:05,610 --> 01:56:10,610
The birth of Western civilization is 
just 30 or 40 of my grandmother's long 

2573
01:56:10,610 --> 01:56:15,260
and then think about the fact that when 
she was born there were no nuclear 

2574
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:15,260
weapons,
was no nuclear power.

2575
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:16,650
We haven't discovered any of that stuff.
Right?

2576
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:19,020
This is so recent.
We are.

2577
01:56:19,021 --> 01:56:21,330
We have the privilege of being the 
generation,

2578
01:56:21,990 --> 01:56:25,220
the couple of generations that are 
witnessing the,

2579
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:29,280
the dawn of the beginning of something 
extraordinarily new,

2580
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:34,580
a,
the capacity to destroy ourselves using 

2581
01:56:34,580 --> 01:56:37,011
nukes and environmental degradation and 
be the rise of artificial intelligence 

2582
01:56:37,011 --> 01:56:39,060
and in computing and mobilization.

2583
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:40,840
You look at that,
the Acropolis,

2584
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:44,050
the parthenon was crazy.
The Acropolis is the building,

2585
01:56:44,051 --> 01:56:45,040
right and the Parthenon is

2586
01:56:45,190 --> 01:56:48,610
built on the Acropolis is the whole 
thing I think,

2587
01:56:48,611 --> 01:56:50,050
and I think the Parthenon is the 
building.

2588
01:56:50,051 --> 01:56:51,850
Am I getting that back to front?
I'm not sure,

2589
01:56:51,970 --> 01:56:52,630
but the.

2590
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:57,780
The bottom line is when you talk to 
Greek scholars and they talk about the 

2591
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:00,820
construction of the building on top,
it was built on Samba,

2592
01:57:00,850 --> 01:57:04,540
something that was even more ancient and
they don't exactly know who built.

2593
01:57:04,810 --> 01:57:08,500
They don't exactly know who built the 
platform that fucker was put on and then

2594
01:57:08,501 --> 01:57:13,501
you go back to crazy things like Baalbek
and Lebanon where they have these 

2595
01:57:13,501 --> 01:57:17,641
enormous stone things that thousands and
thousands and thousands of tons and 

2596
01:57:18,161 --> 01:57:18,460
they're like,
well,

2597
01:57:18,461 --> 01:57:19,960
what the fuck bill?
How'd they build these?

2598
01:57:19,961 --> 01:57:21,910
Would they do with these where these 
things fucking come from?

2599
01:57:22,060 --> 01:57:27,060
And they really don't know.
And that brings up the possibility that 

2600
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:30,070
we haven't had a linear progression from
a man to this,

2601
01:57:30,190 --> 01:57:34,000
but we've had these ups and downs and 
we've been at partially wiped out.

2602
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:39,660
There is a,
there's a series of super volcanoes all 

2603
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:42,391
over the world and one big one being in 
yellowstone that everyone's terrified 

2604
01:57:42,391 --> 01:57:42,391
of,
but there's one of them,

2605
01:57:42,391 --> 01:57:47,281
I believe in Indonesia that there's a 
certain theory that links to a massive 

2606
01:57:47,860 --> 01:57:51,490
eruption of this supervolcano 70,000
years ago.

2607
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:55,270
That is the reason why we all share 
this.

2608
01:57:55,290 --> 01:57:58,450
Um,
so little genetic diversity.

2609
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:03,780
And they believed that we might have 
been down to a few thousand people 

2610
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:04,990
somewhere around 70,000
years ago.

2611
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,110
We were down to,
I mean scientists,

2612
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:10,410
evolutionary biologists can tell that we
were down to,

2613
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:12,390
I don't know if it's as low as that,
but certainly,

2614
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:16,440
I mean it was tens of thousands of 
people and I know when that was,

2615
01:58:16,441 --> 01:58:21,441
but I remember you mentioned that 
Supervolcano last time I was on this 

2616
01:58:21,441 --> 01:58:22,440
show and then I went and googled it and 
it was,

2617
01:58:22,441 --> 01:58:24,720
and it was like a probably didn't 
happen.

2618
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:27,990
Like most of the expert sites that I 
went and looked at was like,

2619
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:33,170
this is kind of one of those sort of 
conspiracy theory things that we don't 

2620
01:58:33,170 --> 01:58:36,291
actually think happened,
but whether or not it was that 

2621
01:58:36,291 --> 01:58:36,291
particular Indonesian super volcano or 
not,

2622
01:58:36,291 --> 01:58:38,670
we do know that there have been periods 
where humankind has,

2623
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:42,040
has almost gone extinct and we've just 
gotten through that.

2624
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:47,720
Well,
human beings have been in this form for 

2625
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:47,720
who knows how long,
you know,

2626
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:50,560
like a million years,
whatever it's been there without a doubt

2627
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:53,380
has been an eruption of yellowstone in 
that time period.

2628
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:57,280
So if there were human beings in North 
America 600,000

2629
01:58:57,281 --> 01:59:00,970
years ago,
those fuckers were cooked and we're do.

2630
01:59:01,230 --> 01:59:02,980
We're done.
Every six to 800,000

2631
01:59:02,981 --> 01:59:07,981
years,
yellowstone blows and it is a continent 

2632
01:59:07,981 --> 01:59:10,441
killer,
it will fuck up everything in the 

2633
01:59:10,441 --> 01:59:11,470
continent and caused some sort of a 
nuclear winter effect to a vast majority

2634
01:59:11,471 --> 01:59:12,880
of the world except maybe like 
Australia,

2635
01:59:13,390 --> 01:59:18,390
Australian passport.
I was going to scrape back to the 

2636
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:18,390
Homeland New Zealand,
go and kill some foxes.

2637
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:23,010
That might be the spot to spot because 
there's a real but didn't have to deal 

2638
01:59:23,171 --> 01:59:24,550
with what they're doing at [inaudible] 
dot com.

2639
01:59:24,551 --> 01:59:29,551
That poor bastard Kim got.com.
You don't know what's going on with him 

2640
01:59:29,551 --> 01:59:33,541
with that Mega upload site and just 
trying to extradite him to a country 

2641
01:59:33,541 --> 01:59:34,000
that he's not even from.

2642
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:36,160
Show him that this was a super 
volcanoes.

2643
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:42,420
Valpo is an amazing.
I said what we're looking at here for 

2644
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:43,120
people who are listening to the podcast 
is yellowstone and then turbo,

2645
01:59:43,121 --> 01:59:45,340
which looks like it's in Indonesia and 
Tampa,

2646
01:59:45,341 --> 01:59:49,270
which is was a mega volcanoes,
so tell my uncle actually is a.

2647
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:52,330
is like a melody.
I have maddy on my side.

2648
01:59:52,331 --> 01:59:52,970
Yeah.
Wow,

2649
01:59:52,980 --> 01:59:54,210
that's cool.
Again,

2650
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:56,440
those crazy face tattoos.
I didn't have a tattoo on my back,

2651
01:59:56,441 --> 02:00:01,441
which is a symbol and to tempo is,
is an old extinct volcano when it blew,

2652
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:10,470
they will.
There are writings of people in Italy 

2653
02:00:10,470 --> 02:00:12,991
talking about how the sunset is,
how like the sky is red at sunset and 

2654
02:00:12,991 --> 02:00:16,060
that's because of the ash from a volcano
on the opposite side of the world and is

2655
02:00:16,061 --> 02:00:21,061
currently a crater that is so big,
like it's a lake that you can reach a 

2656
02:00:21,061 --> 02:00:22,330
huge,
like huge.

2657
02:00:22,330 --> 02:00:27,330
Like,
and that whole thing was just a stream 

2658
02:00:27,330 --> 02:00:30,691
of lava just exploding.
Like it's you can you stand on the side 

2659
02:00:30,701 --> 02:00:35,701
of the lake and you're like this.
I can't even imagine what kind of 

2660
02:00:35,701 --> 02:00:36,880
Armageddon that must've been back when 
it was active.

2661
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:38,080
Well,
our stability,

2662
02:00:38,081 --> 02:00:43,081
the stability that we've enjoyed over 
the past several thousand years that 

2663
02:00:43,081 --> 02:00:44,410
people have written about,
I mean other than,

2664
02:00:44,490 --> 02:00:49,490
um,
what was the one that happened in Rome 

2665
02:00:49,490 --> 02:00:51,470
or what was the,
what was it based on pay?

2666
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:52,900
Yeah,
the Pompei one,

2667
02:00:52,901 --> 02:00:57,901
which was a fairly famous because we've 
actually found people that were killed 

2668
02:00:57,901 --> 02:00:59,170
and we could see their bodies and 
there's,

2669
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:04,200
there's an exhibit somewhere where they 
have the bodies of the people from palm 

2670
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:06,730
pay,
the preserved ones on display somewhere.

2671
02:01:06,740 --> 02:01:09,910
What's supposed to be really freaky,
but that,

2672
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:15,280
that was a major,
a minor one in comparison to 

2673
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:15,280
yellowstone.
They didn't even.

2674
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:19,030
There it is.
Those are the people that were fucking 

2675
02:01:19,030 --> 02:01:19,030
frozen in time and cooked and killed by 
this.

2676
02:01:19,030 --> 02:01:22,150
It's just insane.
Those are actual real human beings.

2677
02:01:22,460 --> 02:01:27,460
I mean,
it looks like some claymation animated 

2678
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:27,460
thing.
That's incredible.

2679
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:30,190
But the um,
what they believe is that,

2680
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:31,780
well,
they didn't even know.

2681
02:01:31,870 --> 02:01:36,870
Here's another thing they didn't even 
know about yellowstone until they 

2682
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:39,721
started looking at it from satellites.
They had no idea it was a Caldera 

2683
02:01:39,721 --> 02:01:43,780
volcano.
They knew that there was some sort of 

2684
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:44,780
thermal activity because of old 
faithful.

2685
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:47,330
They knew there was some lava going on 
under there,

2686
02:01:47,331 --> 02:01:52,331
but they didn't know how big the thing 
was until they started looking at it 

2687
02:01:52,331 --> 02:01:53,090
with satellite imagery and then they 
realize what,

2688
02:01:53,091 --> 02:01:53,840
Whoa,
Whoa,

2689
02:01:53,841 --> 02:01:54,350
whoa,
Whoa,

2690
02:01:54,351 --> 02:01:59,351
whoa.
This thing is like 600 kilometers wide 

2691
02:01:59,351 --> 02:02:03,520
and what it is is a mountain that 
explodes and leaves this crater and 

2692
02:02:05,121 --> 02:02:06,350
that's what it called dairy is.

2693
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:10,540
It reaches this explosion and the whole 
mountain fly.

2694
02:02:10,580 --> 02:02:15,580
You got 300 mile wide mountain shoots,
lava up into the sky and just kills 

2695
02:02:16,131 --> 02:02:19,130
everything.
Everything anywhere on the west coast.

2696
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:21,890
All this is dead.
It's funny how we have a kind of.

2697
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:26,920
There's a sort of cognitive dissonance.
It comes back to what we were talking 

2698
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:29,441
about,
about like the doors of perception and 

2699
02:02:29,441 --> 02:02:31,331
how our brains are forced by evolution 
and to keep us in a very narrow mindset 

2700
02:02:31,331 --> 02:02:35,741
where we don't think about the reality 
of what's going on around us and how 

2701
02:02:35,741 --> 02:02:39,730
vast everything is and so on.
Because I think sometimes about like my 

2702
02:02:39,730 --> 02:02:44,171
friends who live in San Francisco,
San Francisco is going to be devastated 

2703
02:02:44,171 --> 02:02:48,101
by a massive earthquake.
It's just gonna happen when this to La.

2704
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:52,790
San Francisco goes,
they look at you.

2705
02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:55,590
I'm Las Vegas.
San Francisco goes,

2706
02:02:55,591 --> 02:02:56,780
there's going to be awful,
but oh yeah,

2707
02:02:56,781 --> 02:03:00,720
but he's gonna go to La.
Is Ballet as being no las.

2708
02:03:00,850 --> 02:03:05,850
He's saying much San Francisco is a 
innovation Langley to be to be more 

2709
02:03:07,911 --> 02:03:09,110
devastated,
likable,

2710
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:11,170
more likable,
more technical,

2711
02:03:11,330 --> 02:03:16,330
having wood's put in my mouth.
I'm a paranoid paranoid or you,

2712
02:03:17,860 --> 02:03:19,130
uh,
so anyhow,

2713
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:21,300
at the store,
that is great.

2714
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:24,010
That's what I felt like you were saying,
but you know,

2715
02:03:24,110 --> 02:03:29,110
we know this is going to happen and we 
all go about our daily lives and we 

2716
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:32,111
don't pay any attention to it because we
couldn't because we would be paralyzed 

2717
02:03:32,111 --> 02:03:32,390
if we kept thinking isn't going to be 
today,

2718
02:03:32,391 --> 02:03:33,920
is it going to be tonight?
Then we'd just be.

2719
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:35,780
I mean that's OCD,
right?

2720
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:40,990
So we are forced to go through life not 
wrecking will not actually reckoning 

2721
02:03:40,990 --> 02:03:44,771
with the fact that that's going to 
happen and yellowstone is going to 

2722
02:03:44,771 --> 02:03:47,591
happen and all kinds of stuff's going to
go down and there's not a thing we can 

2723
02:03:47,591 --> 02:03:47,810
do about it then.

2724
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:51,800
Then there's asteroids,
asteroidal impacts of the big one,

2725
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:56,860
the,
all the evidence that they're finding 

2726
02:03:56,860 --> 02:03:58,601
now about all the different impact 
craters that they have ignored or not,

2727
02:03:58,671 --> 02:04:02,210
not been aware of until recently.
The discovery of what they called,

2728
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:04,820
I think it's called Triton nine,
it's nuclear glass,

2729
02:04:04,821 --> 02:04:09,821
that that exists on nuclear test sites 
and also made meteor a meteor impacts 

2730
02:04:11,090 --> 02:04:15,170
that they've founded all throughout Asia
and all throughout other parts of Europe

2731
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:20,380
from 12,000
years ago and they think that that 

2732
02:04:20,380 --> 02:04:22,871
coincided with the end of the ice age at
the end of the ice age or might have 

2733
02:04:22,871 --> 02:04:26,201
been instigated by massive astro 
asteroids and impacts all over the world

2734
02:04:29,061 --> 02:04:30,110
like 12,000
years ago.

2735
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:35,500
That might have been why there is this 
really old structures that are sort of 

2736
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:38,700
unexplained and this sort of resurgence 
of civilization.

2737
02:04:38,910 --> 02:04:43,910
Somewhere around the 10,000
year mark that we have this big 

2738
02:04:43,910 --> 02:04:44,520
downfall.
People start figuring things out again,

2739
02:04:44,521 --> 02:04:46,560
just like if you go back 2000 years from
now,

2740
02:04:46,770 --> 02:04:48,210
you know,
you're talking about Greece,

2741
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:53,420
you're talking about ancient Rome,
and then 2000 years later you have New 

2742
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:53,420
York City,
right?

2743
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:55,110
Well,
2000 years after this media,

2744
02:04:55,111 --> 02:04:58,920
real media in most terrible words.
I'm using girl.

2745
02:04:59,420 --> 02:05:04,420
I'm trying to.
I'm trying to say like a weather 

2746
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:04,420
reporter.
Jet Lags triploid along flat.

2747
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:05,220
Yes.
Asteroidal and I'm drinking now.

2748
02:05:05,221 --> 02:05:07,170
You've had a half beer.
That's all I need.

2749
02:05:07,530 --> 02:05:11,100
New.
Was this fucking Nuevo New Mexican beer?

2750
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:11,610
Yeah,
that's good.

2751
02:05:11,810 --> 02:05:16,810
Um,
but they think that it's very possible 

2752
02:05:16,810 --> 02:05:17,460
that civilization has experienced many 
of these.

2753
02:05:17,570 --> 02:05:19,380
Oh,
that's what Graham Hancock is based,

2754
02:05:19,381 --> 02:05:21,900
like a tremendous amount of his work on.
I don't know if you're aware of him,

2755
02:05:21,901 --> 02:05:25,770
but he's a good friend and he wrote a 
book called fingerprints of the Gods.

2756
02:05:25,771 --> 02:05:30,771
It's based on exactly that.
All this evidence that shows that their 

2757
02:05:30,771 --> 02:05:35,120
civilization has experienced these peaks
and valleys and that things have 

2758
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:39,111
happened,
that there have been some resets and it 

2759
02:05:39,111 --> 02:05:40,170
hasn't been as simple as people figured 
out fire.

2760
02:05:40,171 --> 02:05:44,580
Then they figured out they.
And here we are today in New York City.

2761
02:05:44,650 --> 02:05:47,950
I don't know if I mentioned it last time
I was on the podcast or not,

2762
02:05:47,951 --> 02:05:52,951
but there's an amazing kind of study and
there's an amazing article about this 

2763
02:05:54,050 --> 02:05:59,050
sort of research which is if society 
collapses and we still have nuclear 

2764
02:05:59,501 --> 02:06:04,501
waste in the ground,
how do we mark our nuclear waste sites 

2765
02:06:04,501 --> 02:06:07,030
such that a future civilization who has,
who's completely from us?

2766
02:06:07,180 --> 02:06:12,180
Doesn't speak our language,
has no more records of anything that 

2767
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:13,150
went on so that they don't go and hurt 
themselves by digging it up,

2768
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:18,360
and so there's the actual there a 
semiotician and like all these people 

2769
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:21,811
who study the nature of symbols and of 
and of conscious interpretation of the 

2770
02:06:21,811 --> 02:06:26,461
ways that we communicate and everything 
who have got these crazy ideas like 

2771
02:06:26,461 --> 02:06:30,361
putting up these big kind of structures 
that look like big scary angled polls 

2772
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:36,240
that get deeper and deeper and thicker 
and thicker as you get towards the site 

2773
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:39,751
of where the nuclear waste is being 
stored to try to indicate to future 

2774
02:06:39,751 --> 02:06:40,510
intelligent civilizations.

2775
02:06:40,810 --> 02:06:43,780
Not to go in there,
but then the conclusion that they always

2776
02:06:43,781 --> 02:06:47,380
reach is they're just going to think 
they're going to be interested in it.

2777
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:48,870
They're going to want to explore it.
Right?

2778
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:51,430
It's like if even if they understood 
that,

2779
02:06:51,431 --> 02:06:54,520
we're saying that there is this 
invisible radioactive stuff.

2780
02:06:54,790 --> 02:06:59,790
If they haven't yet,
like devise the concept of nuclear 

2781
02:06:59,790 --> 02:07:02,971
power,
then they're just going to treat it the 

2782
02:07:02,971 --> 02:07:02,971
way that we treat the warnings on the 
pyramids saying,

2783
02:07:02,971 --> 02:07:07,741
don't go into the mummies because they 
know you'll get a tech by spirits were 

2784
02:07:07,741 --> 02:07:07,741
like,
oh,

2785
02:07:07,741 --> 02:07:11,131
that was a nice fun thing for you to say
you old fashioned people in ancient 

2786
02:07:11,131 --> 02:07:14,791
civilizations,
but we're going to go in and open the 

2787
02:07:14,791 --> 02:07:16,891
tomb anyway,
and so the conclusion was don't do 

2788
02:07:16,891 --> 02:07:16,891
anything.
Just don't mock it at all.

2789
02:07:16,891 --> 02:07:21,781
Don't try to communicate it because 
human curiosity is always going to be 

2790
02:07:21,781 --> 02:07:21,781
more,
not even human curiosity.

2791
02:07:21,781 --> 02:07:23,840
Maybe like whatever this future species 
is there,

2792
02:07:23,841 --> 02:07:28,841
curiosity is going to be more powerful 
than any warning that we could possibly 

2793
02:07:28,841 --> 02:07:33,630
give them because this stuff last for 
tens sometimes hundreds of thousands of 

2794
02:07:33,630 --> 02:07:33,630
years.

2795
02:07:33,630 --> 02:07:37,020
Yeah,
we really fucked up that whole nuclear 

2796
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:39,271
power thing.
I was trying to explain to someone who 

2797
02:07:39,271 --> 02:07:41,571
is a.
he's a pretty staunch conservative and 

2798
02:07:41,571 --> 02:07:42,040
he was saying how clean nuclear power is
relatively.

2799
02:07:42,050 --> 02:07:45,190
And I said,
do you understand that nuclear power has

2800
02:07:45,191 --> 02:07:50,191
only been around since the 19 forties 
and we already in this brief moment of 

2801
02:07:50,191 --> 02:07:54,661
time,
we already have three spots that we can 

2802
02:07:54,661 --> 02:07:55,300
never go to.
They're done like,

2803
02:07:55,330 --> 02:07:58,240
Chernobyl is done,
fucked,

2804
02:07:58,580 --> 02:08:01,330
you know,
and the Fukushima is fucked.

2805
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:03,420
That's fucked.
You know,

2806
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:05,350
there was the other one,
the mile island,

2807
02:08:05,351 --> 02:08:07,830
three mile island,
wherever it,

2808
02:08:08,030 --> 02:08:11,110
it was really fucked.
Yeah.

2809
02:08:11,170 --> 02:08:14,560
But that's still three spots that they 
fucked up already.

2810
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:19,920
Never to,
not even to mention all the ones that 

2811
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:20,110
are based in the same technology that 
Fukushima was.

2812
02:08:20,380 --> 02:08:22,390
When they can't really shut them down.
They,

2813
02:08:22,410 --> 02:08:27,410
they,
they have these archaic fucking nuclear 

2814
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:28,300
power plants they build when they didn't
really understand nuclear power plants.

2815
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:32,260
Have you heard of pebble shell reactors 
or something like that?

2816
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:33,730
Um,
pebble.

2817
02:08:33,731 --> 02:08:35,140
Hang on,
let me see if I can find.

2818
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:40,170
Because there is apparently a type of 
reactor now where if anything goes 

2819
02:08:40,541 --> 02:08:42,340
wrong,
it automatically shuts down.

2820
02:08:42,341 --> 02:08:44,840
Like it's a physiological thing.
Were they having a,

2821
02:08:44,900 --> 02:08:49,900
it's called a pebble bed reactors,
a graphite moderated gas cooled nuclear 

2822
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:51,970
reactor.
It's apparently,

2823
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:56,770
I believe scientists when they say that 
there are new types of reactors that are

2824
02:08:56,771 --> 02:09:01,771
basically meltdown proof.
My concern is I just think it's so 

2825
02:09:02,261 --> 02:09:04,890
woefully irresponsible to do something 
that,

2826
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:06,480
you know,
producers waste,

2827
02:09:06,481 --> 02:09:11,481
fits incredibly deadly.
That's gonna last for thousands and 

2828
02:09:11,481 --> 02:09:15,841
thousands of times longer than any of us
or any of our children or any of our 

2829
02:09:15,841 --> 02:09:19,951
grandchildren or great grandchildren.
It could be around and just leave it up 

2830
02:09:19,951 --> 02:09:20,290
to other people to deal with.
And I hear conservatives,

2831
02:09:20,300 --> 02:09:22,030
so a pro nuclear people say,
well,

2832
02:09:22,031 --> 02:09:23,470
we'll figure it out eventually.
Okay,

2833
02:09:23,471 --> 02:09:28,471
great.
Let's not use nuclear power until we 

2834
02:09:28,471 --> 02:09:28,471
figure it out then because otherwise you
just,

2835
02:09:28,471 --> 02:09:28,960
you fucking with other people's lives.

2836
02:09:29,140 --> 02:09:34,140
People don't think like that though.
They think short term and they just try 

2837
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:34,180
to make as much money as possible.
That's true.

2838
02:09:34,181 --> 02:09:36,590
Noble today.
Um,

2839
02:09:36,730 --> 02:09:39,610
there's a great documentary that I 
watched on the plane back from Brazil.

2840
02:09:39,950 --> 02:09:41,530
Merchants of doubt.
It was.

2841
02:09:42,170 --> 02:09:43,490
Have you seen it?
Yes.

2842
02:09:43,491 --> 02:09:45,110
Remind me what it is.
Because I think I interviewed the film

2843
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:50,440
fucking fascinating.
It is about fake experts essentially get

2844
02:09:50,901 --> 02:09:55,901
hired by oil companies,
tobacco companies to poo poo the 

2845
02:09:55,901 --> 02:09:59,741
concerns and debate them ferociously.
The concerns about global warming 

2846
02:09:59,741 --> 02:10:04,180
concerns.
They used to do the concerns about 

2847
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:06,640
tobacco being or nicotine being 
addictive and causing cancer and this 

2848
02:10:07,371 --> 02:10:11,150
guy shows that that when when there's 
money involved,

2849
02:10:11,390 --> 02:10:16,390
they.
What they do is they hire all these 

2850
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:18,761
people to fuck with the argument and 
they write op Ed columns and all these 

2851
02:10:18,761 --> 02:10:22,931
different newspapers all throughout the 
country and they constantly hammer so 

2852
02:10:22,931 --> 02:10:25,820
that your grandfather reads and he goes,
I've read a thing today is at 31,000.

2853
02:10:25,821 --> 02:10:27,980
Scientists have said that global 
warming's not real.

2854
02:10:28,150 --> 02:10:30,620
We know who is amongst those 31,000
scientists,

2855
02:10:31,100 --> 02:10:33,220
Michael J Fox.
That was one of it.

2856
02:10:33,290 --> 02:10:34,730
One of the names,
they're fake.

2857
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:38,000
It's fake names and they have Michael 
Shermer on.

2858
02:10:38,001 --> 02:10:43,001
It's kind of explaining that he's great.
At one point in time he thought that 

2859
02:10:43,001 --> 02:10:45,230
there was,
that it was nonsense that global warming

2860
02:10:45,231 --> 02:10:47,200
is nonsense.
And then he started delving into the,

2861
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:49,610
the actual data,
the actual scientific papers,

2862
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:51,050
and then he realized,
well,

2863
02:10:51,051 --> 02:10:56,051
there's not only is there a consensus 
that man made global warming is a real 

2864
02:10:56,541 --> 02:10:59,600
thing,
but there are no peer reviewed studies,

2865
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:03,320
no scientific papers that indicate the 
opposite.

2866
02:11:03,350 --> 02:11:04,100
None,
zero,

2867
02:11:04,101 --> 02:11:04,490
Zilch.

2868
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:06,350
I interviewed the director of that movie
on,

2869
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:11,460
on huffpost live.
So I did see the movie on a screen up 

2870
02:11:11,460 --> 02:11:11,460
beforehand.
And um,

2871
02:11:11,460 --> 02:11:15,710
it,
the amazing thing to me was that it's 

2872
02:11:15,710 --> 02:11:17,611
not just the same tactics that are being
used in sowing doubt about climate 

2873
02:11:17,611 --> 02:11:21,421
change as well.
Used in sowing doubt about all kinds of 

2874
02:11:21,421 --> 02:11:21,421
other different things,
you know,

2875
02:11:21,421 --> 02:11:22,300
starting bestest,
bestest,

2876
02:11:22,301 --> 02:11:25,360
all this sort of stuff.
It's the same human beings.

2877
02:11:25,361 --> 02:11:26,130
Yes,
yes.

2878
02:11:26,530 --> 02:11:31,530
These are professional.
That's why it's called merchants of 

2879
02:11:31,530 --> 02:11:31,530
doubt.
These are the same human beings who went

2880
02:11:31,530 --> 02:11:36,331
in and fought for the tobacco lobby who 
then went and fought for the asbestos 

2881
02:11:36,331 --> 02:11:38,680
industry who are now fighting for the 
fossil fuel companies.

2882
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:42,010
Exactly the same human beings using 
exactly the same playbook,

2883
02:11:42,011 --> 02:11:43,000
using exactly the same.

2884
02:11:43,410 --> 02:11:48,410
And those,
those Goddamn television shows where 

2885
02:11:48,410 --> 02:11:49,360
they have the split screen where they 
have the host and then they have the two

2886
02:11:49,361 --> 02:11:52,960
experts debate it out,
and then have one person who's like Bill

2887
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:57,960
Nye,
who's sort of a reasonable scientist is 

2888
02:11:57,960 --> 02:12:01,871
saying things that people can't totally 
understand because they're a little bit 

2889
02:12:01,871 --> 02:12:05,101
too tactical and then you have this 
shouting guy who like fact 23,000

2890
02:12:06,341 --> 02:12:10,780
scientists from 40 countries have said 
global warming's not real fact.

2891
02:12:11,020 --> 02:12:13,060
The United States and went along and the
they,

2892
02:12:13,070 --> 02:12:17,320
they have this playbook that they use.
They have this style of communicating in

2893
02:12:17,321 --> 02:12:20,440
these short bursts because those shows 
only last.

2894
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:22,750
You have seven minutes,
you have seven minutes.

2895
02:12:22,751 --> 02:12:25,060
There's three people there were all 
talking.

2896
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:27,920
It's so hard to get a point across and 
it.

2897
02:12:28,270 --> 02:12:33,270
It's one of the reasons why I think it's
one of the shittiest ways to discuss a 

2898
02:12:33,270 --> 02:12:33,270
subject.

2899
02:12:33,270 --> 02:12:37,680
Totally.
This is one of the things that I really 

2900
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:39,000
spend a lot of time trying to do in my 
job,

2901
02:12:39,330 --> 02:12:43,860
which is overturn this phony sense of 
balance that is required.

2902
02:12:44,030 --> 02:12:49,030
It's so every journalist in every media 
person tries to be anyone who's good has

2903
02:12:50,941 --> 02:12:53,190
instilled in them a sense that they're 
supposed to be fair,

2904
02:12:53,250 --> 02:12:56,500
right,
but that often gets misallocated,

2905
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:58,560
especially at places like CNN,
for example,

2906
02:12:58,561 --> 02:13:00,900
where they're trying to be genuinely 
even handed,

2907
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:05,820
but what they think that means is giving
a microphone to the two people at either

2908
02:13:05,821 --> 02:13:10,821
side of any particular debate.
Now there are some debates where one 

2909
02:13:10,821 --> 02:13:12,540
side is right and one side is wrong,
right?

2910
02:13:12,541 --> 02:13:17,541
Or there's a 98 percent chance that one 
side is right and a two percent chance 

2911
02:13:17,541 --> 02:13:20,751
that the other side is right.
When you try to be balanced by just 

2912
02:13:20,751 --> 02:13:24,171
sitting in the middle and trying to 
moderate a debate between those two 

2913
02:13:24,171 --> 02:13:27,501
people,
you're actually not being unbiased at 

2914
02:13:27,501 --> 02:13:27,501
all.

2915
02:13:27,501 --> 02:13:29,730
You're being biased towards false hood 
instead of towards truth.

2916
02:13:30,030 --> 02:13:35,030
So whenever I have have a weekly segment
about science news called the nerds 

2917
02:13:35,030 --> 02:13:38,901
forum on Huff Post live,
and I always try to try to explain to 

2918
02:13:38,901 --> 02:13:38,901
people and express,
look,

2919
02:13:38,901 --> 02:13:41,610
this is the likelihood that this thing 
is actually true.

2920
02:13:41,910 --> 02:13:46,910
So let's talk about the science and 
let's not get caught up in this trap of 

2921
02:13:46,910 --> 02:13:47,940
false equivalencies.
It's like,

2922
02:13:47,941 --> 02:13:50,090
where did you say a call?
Bam.

2923
02:13:50,290 --> 02:13:51,630
Did a bit about.
No,

2924
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:52,560
it wasn't cold.
Barrows.

2925
02:13:52,620 --> 02:13:56,010
John Oliver did a bit.
And the same guy.

2926
02:13:57,630 --> 02:14:00,840
Same Guy.
John Oliver is a different guy.

2927
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:02,880
Does he have an English accent?
He has an English accent,

2928
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:04,000
new character.
The Colbert.

2929
02:14:04,250 --> 02:14:07,460
Stephen Colbert is a human being.
So John,

2930
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:12,210
although he's not anymore,
he's the host of the late show.

2931
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:15,570
Oh right.
Kobe is no more carry on.

2932
02:14:15,810 --> 02:14:18,700
So John Oliver did this bit where he was
like a.

2933
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:23,720
instead of having a pro climate change 
person and an anti climate change 

2934
02:14:23,720 --> 02:14:24,180
person,
uh,

2935
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:29,390
we think that we should actually reflect
the proportions accurately since 99 

2936
02:14:29,581 --> 02:14:31,650
percent of climate scientists believe in
it.

2937
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:34,100
They have one.
So he brings out nine.

2938
02:14:34,110 --> 02:14:36,450
Nine people come on sand and they're all
just shouting,

2939
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:41,640
oh,
actually pro the pro climate change 

2940
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:43,821
position.
And there's this one other guy who's 

2941
02:14:43,821 --> 02:14:43,821
chatting the etsy climate change 
position.

2942
02:14:43,821 --> 02:14:44,430
And he's like,
this is what it actually is like.

2943
02:14:44,431 --> 02:14:47,100
It's not one for one,
it's $99 for one,

2944
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:49,800
and that's how the media should portray.
That's hilarious.

2945
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:51,420
That's a great idea.
By the way,

2946
02:14:51,710 --> 02:14:52,930
there really is a great idea.
Idea.

2947
02:14:53,290 --> 02:14:58,290
Yeah.
I think that those shows are horrible 

2948
02:14:58,290 --> 02:15:00,271
because they're.
This is how a lot of people get their 

2949
02:15:00,271 --> 02:15:01,360
information and they say they call it 
the news in quotes,

2950
02:15:01,630 --> 02:15:06,630
but it's not really the news.
It's an entertainment show and it's an 

2951
02:15:06,630 --> 02:15:06,630
entertainment show that relies on 
commercials,

2952
02:15:06,760 --> 02:15:11,760
so you this balanced nuanced 
perspectives and arguments that are 

2953
02:15:11,891 --> 02:15:16,891
extremely complex like we like we spent 
all this time talking about the 

2954
02:15:16,891 --> 02:15:21,151
conservation for hunting argument and 
all the artificial intelligence 

2955
02:15:21,151 --> 02:15:21,400
argument,
the argument,

2956
02:15:21,450 --> 02:15:25,960
the argument about pursuing it.
All these things are real complex,

2957
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:31,200
nuanced issues that require long sort of
detailed examinations of all the 

2958
02:15:33,851 --> 02:15:38,851
possibilities and not from a biased 
perspective but from as objective as is 

2959
02:15:38,851 --> 02:15:43,261
humanly possible,
especially when there's real 

2960
02:15:43,261 --> 02:15:45,871
ramifications.
Things like global warming or nuclear 

2961
02:15:45,871 --> 02:15:49,141
energy or things that really are gonna 
fuck up our generation and generations 

2962
02:15:49,141 --> 02:15:50,860
to come like the hundreds of thousands 
of years from now.

2963
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:56,430
Those don't get addressed when you have 
seven minutes and you have a guy who's 

2964
02:15:56,430 --> 02:15:58,870
being paid by these think tanks and 
that's what's crazy about this merchants

2965
02:15:58,871 --> 02:16:03,871
of doubt,
a documentary is it shows that there's 

2966
02:16:03,871 --> 02:16:07,150
these people that are paid by think 
tanks and these think tanks.

2967
02:16:07,151 --> 02:16:12,151
What they really are is they're these 
fake organizations that are propped up 

2968
02:16:12,151 --> 02:16:16,081
by companies that are selling whatever 
the fuck they would benefit from this 

2969
02:16:16,081 --> 02:16:18,790
being passed or this being the.
The concerns being alleviated.

2970
02:16:18,791 --> 02:16:23,791
One of them being like this doctor who 
was a paid by this think tank to go and 

2971
02:16:24,190 --> 02:16:29,190
preach about these flame retardant 
fabrics and materials using to make 

2972
02:16:31,060 --> 02:16:36,060
furniture and that he would say this 
story about a woman who left a candle in

2973
02:16:36,851 --> 02:16:39,450
the babies was a cigarette,
wasn't a candle.

2974
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:41,080
She said a candle.
She left it.

2975
02:16:41,081 --> 02:16:44,320
There was a cigarette story too,
but there's a woman left a candle in her

2976
02:16:44,321 --> 02:16:49,321
baby's crib and that the baby,
because the pillow was flame retardant 

2977
02:16:51,281 --> 02:16:53,250
leaves a candle in a baby's crib 
annually.

2978
02:16:53,320 --> 02:16:55,060
Exactly.
It wasn't a real story.

2979
02:16:55,180 --> 02:16:58,000
It was a lie and this guy had told not 
that story,

2980
02:16:58,030 --> 02:17:03,030
not just once,
but several times over a long period of 

2981
02:17:03,030 --> 02:17:03,030
time,
over many years,

2982
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:06,370
and these people started investigating 
the merchants of doubt.

2983
02:17:06,371 --> 02:17:07,630
Go Watch the documentary.
It's amazing.

2984
02:17:07,631 --> 02:17:12,631
Amazing.
And they started investigating this 

2985
02:17:12,631 --> 02:17:14,020
doctor and what did they call them up?
Did you actually treat these people?

2986
02:17:14,140 --> 02:17:16,680
They looked into his past.
His background is passed.

2987
02:17:16,850 --> 02:17:21,850
They did a computer database on all the 
infants that died from burns in this 

2988
02:17:21,850 --> 02:17:26,821
guy's a area and they found that it was 
a lie and so they called him and he 

2989
02:17:26,821 --> 02:17:26,821
said,
well,

2990
02:17:26,821 --> 02:17:29,980
this is an anecdotal thing and I would 
trust it wasn't real.

2991
02:17:29,981 --> 02:17:32,380
I was just trying to paint a story of 
what's possible.

2992
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:33,400
No you fucking,
but he,

2993
02:17:33,430 --> 02:17:38,430
because he wasn't under oath because he 
wasn't under oath when he was 

2994
02:17:38,430 --> 02:17:38,430
testifying.

2995
02:17:38,430 --> 02:17:41,380
He was allowed to lie about this stuff.
When they asked him,

2996
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:46,560
yeah,
I was paid for citizens for fire safety 

2997
02:17:46,560 --> 02:17:46,560
or whatever the fuck that's the think 
tank was.

2998
02:17:46,560 --> 02:17:49,210
And then when a think tank has less than
x amount of members,

2999
02:17:49,211 --> 02:17:54,211
you have to sort of disclose where the 
funding comes from and the funding all 

3000
02:17:54,211 --> 02:17:57,151
came from the manufacturers of this 
flame retardants shit that is causing 

3001
02:17:57,151 --> 02:18:01,110
all sorts of problems with children,
especially babies like babies around 

3002
02:18:01,110 --> 02:18:03,520
this flame retardants stuff that dust 
from that stuff gets in their lungs that

3003
02:18:03,521 --> 02:18:08,521
gets in their system and they showed 
like the difference between the amount 

3004
02:18:08,521 --> 02:18:11,491
of this shit,
it's an American babies versus the 

3005
02:18:11,491 --> 02:18:13,771
amount of the shit that's in babies and 
other countries where they don't have 

3006
02:18:13,771 --> 02:18:14,790
these people lobbying to have the shit 
be put in there.

3007
02:18:14,820 --> 02:18:17,080
Their furniture.
It's fucking terrifying.

3008
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:22,140
I often wonder living in America why 
cancer rights here are increasing at 

3009
02:18:22,140 --> 02:18:23,080
the,
at the right that they are.

3010
02:18:23,170 --> 02:18:27,570
And you know why Fox News,
because you can answer this Washington.

3011
02:18:28,180 --> 02:18:33,180
I mean not those hot chicks or something
is going on right up.

3012
02:18:33,281 --> 02:18:36,220
That is not happening in Japan and it is
not happening in,

3013
02:18:36,221 --> 02:18:41,221
in other countries.
And I wonder whether it is stuffed like 

3014
02:18:41,221 --> 02:18:42,520
industry's lobbying for fire safety.
Things that are.

3015
02:18:42,521 --> 02:18:44,050
So every time you sit down on your 
couch,

3016
02:18:44,051 --> 02:18:46,930
you just a little bit,
you're just absorbing like the tiniest,

3017
02:18:46,931 --> 02:18:51,931
tiniest,
tiniest little bit of some shitty 

3018
02:18:51,931 --> 02:18:51,931
chemical,
you know,

3019
02:18:51,931 --> 02:18:52,420
I don't want to get too hippy dippy 
about it,

3020
02:18:52,421 --> 02:18:55,820
but like all the stuff that's in our 
soaps and the teenager just the,

3021
02:18:55,821 --> 02:18:56,710
um,
the number,

3022
02:18:56,740 --> 02:18:58,720
you look at the ingredients on things 
and they were just,

3023
02:18:58,721 --> 02:19:00,940
it's just a litany of chemicals.
It makes me,

3024
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:03,000
it makes me want to move to New Zealand 
and ate my,

3025
02:19:03,260 --> 02:19:08,260
My,
my grandmother's beautiful eggs from a 

3026
02:19:08,260 --> 02:19:10,830
natural chicken and just use eucalyptus 
oil to bathe myself in and sit on a 

3027
02:19:10,930 --> 02:19:11,770
wooden chair.

3028
02:19:11,990 --> 02:19:12,980
Well,
I think you're right.

3029
02:19:12,981 --> 02:19:17,981
And I think though the argument is 
pretty clear when you see things like 

3030
02:19:17,981 --> 02:19:21,101
this merchants of doubt and you find out
how lobbyists work and you find out how 

3031
02:19:21,101 --> 02:19:24,131
think tanks work and you find out how 
these people are actively trying to get 

3032
02:19:24,131 --> 02:19:25,970
these things,
get the concerns about these things that

3033
02:19:25,971 --> 02:19:30,971
alleviated.
And they're it strictly for financial 

3034
02:19:30,971 --> 02:19:30,971
reasons.
That's it.

3035
02:19:30,971 --> 02:19:32,330
They're not doing it because they have a
real concern.

3036
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:34,730
And it takes us a while before we figure
it out,

3037
02:19:34,980 --> 02:19:36,430
like thalidomide,
like thumb,

3038
02:19:36,431 --> 02:19:39,230
a little bit of my babies.
And that has to happen as best as people

3039
02:19:39,231 --> 02:19:40,520
have to get cancer,
they get rid of.

3040
02:19:40,570 --> 02:19:42,230
Especially now they're getting rid of 
trans fats.

3041
02:19:42,231 --> 02:19:43,850
Trans fats are now illegal.
Well,

3042
02:19:43,851 --> 02:19:46,340
how many fucking people had to get sick?
I mean,

3043
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:49,370
how long have trans fats and margarine?
I can't believe it's not butter.

3044
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:53,390
How long has that shift been around?
It's been around forever and people have

3045
02:19:53,391 --> 02:19:57,110
lobbied in,
lied and promoted these things for their

3046
02:19:57,111 --> 02:19:59,750
own personal gain and profits.
And it's,

3047
02:19:59,751 --> 02:20:02,570
it's crazy.
But it's a real part of our culture.

3048
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:06,760
It's a real part of our legal system.
It's a real part of how we,

3049
02:20:06,790 --> 02:20:07,370
we,
we,

3050
02:20:07,380 --> 02:20:09,020
you know,
we create laws.

3051
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:10,670
It's,
it's kind of scary.

3052
02:20:10,671 --> 02:20:13,550
It's kind of scary when you think about 
how sociopathic it really is.

3053
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:14,900
That's right.
And I do think that the,

3054
02:20:14,970 --> 02:20:16,460
again,
coming back to the media,

3055
02:20:16,730 --> 02:20:20,450
I think we have a big responsibility 
because we own the media.

3056
02:20:20,630 --> 02:20:25,630
You will realize I wasn't,
I didn't mean to include you in the way 

3057
02:20:25,630 --> 02:20:25,630
I was including nervous was including 
me.

3058
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:31,300
I mean you are.
You're part of the good part of the 

3059
02:20:31,300 --> 02:20:32,420
media in so far as what the Internet is 
now doing is allowing conversations like

3060
02:20:32,421 --> 02:20:33,020
this.
Like you say,

3061
02:20:33,021 --> 02:20:34,790
well,
how can you get to impart these ideas in

3062
02:20:34,791 --> 02:20:36,080
seven minutes?
I mean,

3063
02:20:36,081 --> 02:20:38,460
you're lucky if you get seven minutes on
exhibit TV,

3064
02:20:38,490 --> 02:20:40,280
you usually get three minutes.
If you're on the today show,

3065
02:20:40,281 --> 02:20:45,281
you get three minutes or something,
but how many people have time to listen 

3066
02:20:45,281 --> 02:20:46,130
to a three hour podcast at one point 6 
million twitter followers?

3067
02:20:46,660 --> 02:20:48,070
Yeah,
there's a lot now.

3068
02:20:48,100 --> 02:20:53,100
It's getting more now,
but it's also ridiculous that a former 

3069
02:20:53,100 --> 02:20:56,890
fear factor host meatheads cage fighting
commentators smokes pot all the time,

3070
02:20:57,100 --> 02:20:58,900
is the guy that you come into for 
information.

3071
02:20:59,170 --> 02:21:01,000
It seems like there should be someone 
more qualified.

3072
02:21:01,050 --> 02:21:01,710
Well,
that's right.

3073
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:06,800
That's right.
But I mean when there are like Sam 

3074
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:07,290
Harris and there's a lot more people out
there that are doing this as well,

3075
02:21:07,291 --> 02:21:12,291
but this medium,
I agree with you that this medium 

3076
02:21:12,291 --> 02:21:12,291
absolutely genius of it,
and the problem is that people,

3077
02:21:12,291 --> 02:21:17,270
journalists,
and not don't tend to be scientifically 

3078
02:21:17,270 --> 02:21:19,671
literate.
So when something comes out saying that 

3079
02:21:19,671 --> 02:21:20,550
butter is a deadly killer and monitoring
is the answer,

3080
02:21:20,970 --> 02:21:23,790
then someone puts out a press release,
a PR company,

3081
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:26,760
then some money from it,
from the modern industry,

3082
02:21:26,970 --> 02:21:31,970
and then the producer at the radio 
station or television station who 

3083
02:21:31,970 --> 02:21:33,000
receives that knows that that's a juicy 
tidbit.

3084
02:21:33,060 --> 02:21:38,060
So they write it up and they do a story 
on it and that's that all of a sudden 

3085
02:21:38,060 --> 02:21:40,620
the viewer is under the impression that 
this is a settled fact.

3086
02:21:40,621 --> 02:21:45,621
It's not a settled fact.
It's what was one study and in three 

3087
02:21:45,621 --> 02:21:48,561
years' time module is going to be a 
deadly killer and bought is going to be 

3088
02:21:48,561 --> 02:21:48,561
good again.
But also in the

3089
02:21:48,561 --> 02:21:50,080
defense of the people that were 
distributing that information,

3090
02:21:50,081 --> 02:21:52,390
there was very little known about 
cholesterol back then.

3091
02:21:52,391 --> 02:21:53,350
LDL,
cholesterol,

3092
02:21:53,351 --> 02:21:54,160
hdl,
cholesterol.

3093
02:21:54,161 --> 02:21:55,390
What is the difference?
What was needed?

3094
02:21:55,570 --> 02:22:00,570
Scientific work has still been needed to
be done on a lot of different dietary 

3095
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:03,610
supplements and things that the data 
wasn't in yet.

3096
02:22:03,640 --> 02:22:04,300
Right,
but Joe,

3097
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:07,780
scientists will always speak with more 
caveats than the media does.

3098
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:13,200
Huge bug and scientists back then,
even if they hadn't known about ldl 

3099
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:13,200
cholesterol,
they would've said,

3100
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:17,200
look on the basis of what we currently 
understand about module and bought a and

3101
02:22:17,201 --> 02:22:18,700
human physiology,
blahdy,

3102
02:22:18,701 --> 02:22:19,270
blahdy,
blah.

3103
02:22:19,300 --> 02:22:24,300
That's not the way that it ends up 
getting impounded because nobody wants 

3104
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:26,521
to watch a television show that 
equivocates like that or a news 

3105
02:22:26,521 --> 02:22:26,521
broadcast that equivocates like,
no,

3106
02:22:26,521 --> 02:22:26,521
I think

3107
02:22:26,521 --> 02:22:31,010
you're definitely right about that and I
also think that we're in a weird time 

3108
02:22:31,010 --> 02:22:32,800
now where,
because of the Internet and because like

3109
02:22:33,090 --> 02:22:38,090
you could do huffpost live,
I don't know what kind of editorial 

3110
02:22:38,090 --> 02:22:38,860
control they have over what you do.
Like when you finish.

3111
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:40,350
I really enjoy your show,
by the way,

3112
02:22:40,590 --> 02:22:45,590
if anybody hasn't seen it,
the reason why I wanted to get you on 

3113
02:22:45,590 --> 02:22:45,590
the show in the first place,
I've watched many episodes your show and

3114
02:22:45,590 --> 02:22:48,120
it's very balanced and until I like this
conversation,

3115
02:22:48,121 --> 02:22:50,010
it's a,
it's a cool show and it's,

3116
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:55,340
and it's very unlike something that you 
would see in normal NBC 8:00

3117
02:22:56,460 --> 02:22:58,920
PM or whatever the fuck it would be on 
broadcast television.

3118
02:22:58,921 --> 02:23:02,370
It's just very different.
I think that that kind of stuff and that

3119
02:23:02,371 --> 02:23:07,371
the Internet and what the Internet,
the freedom that it provides and also 

3120
02:23:07,371 --> 02:23:07,800
the freedom of Info,
the amount of information,

3121
02:23:07,801 --> 02:23:10,670
the access to it is kind of changing 
the,

3122
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:12,630
the ability of these people to do things
like that.

3123
02:23:12,950 --> 02:23:14,640
Yeah,
I agree.

3124
02:23:15,210 --> 02:23:16,800
Um,
did you say,

3125
02:23:16,801 --> 02:23:19,080
by the way,
this also just popped into my head while

3126
02:23:19,081 --> 02:23:20,220
we were talking.
Um,

3127
02:23:20,850 --> 02:23:25,170
Richard Dawkins tweet about feminism in 
Islam.

3128
02:23:25,650 --> 02:23:27,900
Nobody saw him.
He said,

3129
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:31,740
uh,
Islam needs a feminist revolution.

3130
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:36,800
It will be hard.
What can we do to help and which seems 

3131
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:38,070
reasonable to me.
Yeah.

3132
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:38,900
And then,
uh,

3133
02:23:39,030 --> 02:23:41,580
the Internet just exploded.
I had I store,

3134
02:23:41,581 --> 02:23:42,960
it feels like they got mad at him.
Oh,

3135
02:23:42,961 --> 02:23:47,580
totally misogynistic.
How dare he has a white male.

3136
02:23:47,581 --> 02:23:48,220
Look,
I have these.

3137
02:23:48,660 --> 02:23:53,660
I still have these tabs up on my 
computer because we were looking at it 

3138
02:23:53,660 --> 02:23:53,660
as a white male.

3139
02:23:53,660 --> 02:23:55,310
Women who are forced to wear these crazy
outfits.

3140
02:23:55,311 --> 02:23:57,290
They cover their body.
They can't go to school.

3141
02:23:57,500 --> 02:23:58,850
They can't drive.

3142
02:23:59,250 --> 02:24:01,320
So look at the candidate vote ugliest 
headlines.

3143
02:24:01,321 --> 02:24:04,590
Richard Dawkins,
mansplained feminism to Muslim women.

3144
02:24:06,570 --> 02:24:08,910
Atheist Richard Dawkins,
tweet file.

3145
02:24:09,300 --> 02:24:12,900
Richard Dawkins fail spectacularly on 
feminism and Islam.

3146
02:24:12,990 --> 02:24:14,550
Who wrote these,
by the way,

3147
02:24:14,910 --> 02:24:16,400
they're all over the place.
Uh,

3148
02:24:16,750 --> 02:24:18,690
one of them's Napoleon pace in the huff 
post.

3149
02:24:18,691 --> 02:24:20,430
One of them said,
yeah,

3150
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:22,890
we made a blog.
What is the opinion blog?

3151
02:24:22,891 --> 02:24:25,260
What does it say?
That is the.

3152
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:26,480
Hang on,
let me see if I was told that.

3153
02:24:26,610 --> 02:24:30,780
I think I,
I just saved the titles here.

3154
02:24:30,890 --> 02:24:34,800
Say so I don't have the uh,
there are so many people looking to call

3155
02:24:34,801 --> 02:24:37,630
bullshit on men that somehow or another

3156
02:24:37,690 --> 02:24:42,490
try to say anything about what women do 
or need to do.

3157
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:47,720
Like here's one twitter user says,
Richard Dawkins needs to abandon his 

3158
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:48,430
patronizing white savior,
paternalist,

3159
02:24:48,450 --> 02:24:53,450
Islamophobia like how many buzzwords can
you fit in a tweet?

3160
02:24:54,400 --> 02:24:56,280
How many politically correct buzzwords 
can you fit?

3161
02:24:56,281 --> 02:24:58,430
That person's not real.
That's a Stephen Colbert,

3162
02:24:58,550 --> 02:25:03,550
Huffington post.
They're pretending to be a fucking 

3163
02:25:03,550 --> 02:25:05,120
liberal conservative,
and then,

3164
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:10,200
and then it was an article saying that 
he's no better than early 20th century 

3165
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:11,040
European colonists,
Muslim women,

3166
02:25:11,041 --> 02:25:14,880
that they needed help from European men 
even says,

3167
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:16,590
what can we do to help?
It says,

3168
02:25:16,591 --> 02:25:19,140
Islam needs a feminist revolution.
It will be hard.

3169
02:25:19,141 --> 02:25:20,100
What can we do to help?

3170
02:25:20,170 --> 02:25:22,900
That's a beautiful tweet and it's 
correct when look,

3171
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:25,360
if you just look at it as human,
forget about Islam.

3172
02:25:25,420 --> 02:25:29,200
Forget about sex is.
Forget about all that gender's shit.

3173
02:25:29,290 --> 02:25:34,290
If you just looked at it,
there's a human being that's looking at 

3174
02:25:34,290 --> 02:25:36,010
other human beings that are forced to 
behave in a way that they might not want

3175
02:25:36,011 --> 02:25:39,210
to picture.
It has nothing to do with this.

3176
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:42,970
Let's say it's a new group that starts 
up tomorrow and they call themselves the

3177
02:25:42,971 --> 02:25:44,260
fucking monkey faces.

3178
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:49,440
Joe,
you're ignoring the deep complexity of 

3179
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:49,440
so many different strains of Islam 
around the world.

3180
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:52,530
You're disempowering women of color,
western world.

3181
02:25:52,630 --> 02:25:53,890
What about white chicks that are Muslim?

3182
02:25:54,290 --> 02:25:55,200
You're,
you're a racist.

3183
02:25:55,770 --> 02:25:58,750
I just called you out and you don't call
out fucking racist.

3184
02:25:58,780 --> 02:26:00,310
There's a lot of white Muslim.
Of course.

3185
02:26:01,330 --> 02:26:04,930
I'm just so frustrating with.
Was sarcastic too.

3186
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:07,620
I know.
What can you do?

3187
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:13,000
How can we do it?
Here are people that are trying to call 

3188
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:16,611
bullshit on people when the bullshit 
doesn't exist because they want a score 

3189
02:26:16,611 --> 02:26:19,761
just like we were talking about earlier,
that cops want to arrest people because 

3190
02:26:19,761 --> 02:26:19,761
it's a fucking game and they want to 
win.

3191
02:26:19,890 --> 02:26:22,050
I think there's people that want to win 
on twitter.

3192
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:24,600
There's people that want to win on huff 
post is people that are looking to write

3193
02:26:24,601 --> 02:26:28,680
blogs about a guy like Richard Dawkins 
who has said some kind of weird,

3194
02:26:28,681 --> 02:26:33,681
questionable shit in the past.
Like especially the shit that he said 

3195
02:26:33,681 --> 02:26:33,900
about child molesting that he was,
uh,

3196
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:37,260
he experienced some mild molestation 
when he was young.

3197
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:39,300
No big deal.
Got over it.

3198
02:26:39,301 --> 02:26:39,660
You know,
like,

3199
02:26:39,661 --> 02:26:40,210
Whoa,
Whoa,

3200
02:26:40,211 --> 02:26:41,040
whoa.
What the fuck,

3201
02:26:41,090 --> 02:26:46,090
man,
if you listen to what he was actually 

3202
02:26:46,090 --> 02:26:46,090
saying,
I think what he was,

3203
02:26:46,090 --> 02:26:46,850
I think what he was saying is get over 
that we get,

3204
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:50,240
we get,
we have certain paradigms of about which

3205
02:26:50,241 --> 02:26:55,241
we get very,
very upset and because abusing and 

3206
02:26:55,241 --> 02:26:59,141
violently raping children is pretty much
the worst thing that you can possibly 

3207
02:26:59,141 --> 02:27:02,441
do.
We have made it mandatory to regard all 

3208
02:27:02,441 --> 02:27:04,400
child abuse as being the worst thing 
that can possibly happen.

3209
02:27:04,430 --> 02:27:09,430
I think his point was like I was 
funneled by by a stupid crazy priest 

3210
02:27:09,430 --> 02:27:12,710
when I was 12 years old or something and
I pretty quickly got over it.

3211
02:27:12,890 --> 02:27:16,160
So that's not to say that other people 
who didn't get over it and going through

3212
02:27:16,220 --> 02:27:21,220
didn't go through horrible things,
but do we have to regard every single 

3213
02:27:21,220 --> 02:27:25,040
instance of every single type of crime 
as equally bad?

3214
02:27:25,041 --> 02:27:28,220
Can we be a bit more nuance?
Like maybe they're a very,

3215
02:27:28,221 --> 02:27:31,880
very bad forms of child abuse and maybe 
there are less bad forms of child abuse,

3216
02:27:31,881 --> 02:27:36,881
but the moment you say that,
everyone says he's saying a child abuse 

3217
02:27:36,881 --> 02:27:36,881
is good.

3218
02:27:36,881 --> 02:27:36,881
Right?
Well,

3219
02:27:36,881 --> 02:27:38,990
and also this is a horrible thing to 
say,

3220
02:27:39,290 --> 02:27:44,290
but I'll preface it by saying,
this is my own personal experience.

3221
02:27:44,750 --> 02:27:47,750
I was bullied when I was a kid,
but it was mild bullying,

3222
02:27:47,810 --> 02:27:52,810
like nobody did anything horrible to me.
I was never beaten half to death or I 

3223
02:27:52,810 --> 02:27:55,010
was never.
Nobody ever threatened me with weapons.

3224
02:27:55,370 --> 02:27:57,200
I just kind of picked on and fucked 
with,

3225
02:27:57,201 --> 02:28:00,320
but it got me into martial arts and it 
changed my life.

3226
02:28:00,650 --> 02:28:05,300
Like these are the Yin and the Yang to 
things and I think that sometimes take a

3227
02:28:05,301 --> 02:28:10,301
little bit of resistance is good because
the reaction to that resistance is you 

3228
02:28:10,301 --> 02:28:14,711
decide like,
this is never going to happen to me 

3229
02:28:14,711 --> 02:28:16,391
anymore.
I'm going to fire up and I'm going to 

3230
02:28:16,391 --> 02:28:18,911
figure out a way to empower myself.
So this is no longer a fear of mine and 

3231
02:28:18,911 --> 02:28:23,351
I think that a little bit of someone 
being an asshole to you makes you 

3232
02:28:23,351 --> 02:28:24,320
appreciate kind people.

3233
02:28:24,590 --> 02:28:26,480
I think the,
the evil people in the world.

3234
02:28:26,481 --> 02:28:29,030
And here's another one.
Shitty relationships.

3235
02:28:29,330 --> 02:28:31,730
I think most of us have had some bad 
relationships,

3236
02:28:32,330 --> 02:28:35,250
bad relationships make you appreciate 
good relationships.

3237
02:28:35,550 --> 02:28:36,230
You know,
like I,

3238
02:28:36,231 --> 02:28:38,780
I really appreciate one of the things I 
really love about my wife,

3239
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:41,900
she doesn't like to argue about shit.
She's like a really kind person.

3240
02:28:41,901 --> 02:28:46,901
She's friendly and sweet and warm and 
she's not like a person like picks on 

3241
02:28:46,901 --> 02:28:50,861
people and she like picks on you or 
starts arguing or brings up shit that 

3242
02:28:50,861 --> 02:28:54,911
happened like a month ago or a year ago.
I have a buddy that has a wife that 

3243
02:28:54,911 --> 02:28:55,310
argues with them like that.
Well,

3244
02:28:55,311 --> 02:28:56,180
yeah.
Well you know,

3245
02:28:56,181 --> 02:28:57,740
when we were first dating you,
he's like,

3246
02:28:57,770 --> 02:29:02,770
that was fucking police fucking selling.
My body is different from the cells that

3247
02:29:05,880 --> 02:29:10,880
were in my body seven years ago.
I'm not responsible for that guy who 

3248
02:29:10,880 --> 02:29:12,290
came home drunk and fucking shit already
apologized.

3249
02:29:12,620 --> 02:29:13,580
Exactly.
But it's not.

3250
02:29:13,620 --> 02:29:16,250
If anything comes up,
like if she does something wrong,

3251
02:29:16,251 --> 02:29:18,980
like if she doesn't pay a bill.
So was put the fuck the cables off.

3252
02:29:19,010 --> 02:29:21,830
Well you remember when we first started 
dating and fucking yes,

3253
02:29:21,831 --> 02:29:24,590
I do remember that.
And it also has nothing whatsoever to do

3254
02:29:24,591 --> 02:29:26,240
with the conversation that we're having 
right now.

3255
02:29:26,300 --> 02:29:26,800
Well,
you,

3256
02:29:26,830 --> 02:29:31,830
when you experienced that,
he fucked up and married this crazy 

3257
02:29:31,830 --> 02:29:31,830
broad.
Sorry,

3258
02:29:31,830 --> 02:29:32,610
I said broad.
I'm an asshole.

3259
02:29:33,450 --> 02:29:38,450
Let me try to explain things.
It was white male privilege or ripping 

3260
02:29:38,450 --> 02:29:39,630
into the microphone.
I split.

3261
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:45,160
I spray that shit like come.
That's what I do with my white male 

3262
02:29:45,160 --> 02:29:48,461
privilege.
I don't allow it to just ooze out like 

3263
02:29:48,461 --> 02:29:48,461
maple syrup.
Um,

3264
02:29:48,461 --> 02:29:52,660
I think that when we see these terrible 
things like when I go to,

3265
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:56,480
I love Brazil.
Brazil is a wonderful country.

3266
02:29:56,510 --> 02:29:58,220
It's a,
the people are friendly,

3267
02:29:58,221 --> 02:29:59,720
they're free,
they're happy,

3268
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:02,750
but it's also like kind of crazy 
unorganized.

3269
02:30:03,050 --> 02:30:08,050
Like when you go to the airport,
like one of the things when we were 

3270
02:30:08,050 --> 02:30:11,840
getting on a plane from Sao Paulo to 
Brazil or Sao Paulo to Rio rather,

3271
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:12,780
um,
the,

3272
02:30:12,880 --> 02:30:17,660
we couldn't find out what fucking gate 
it was because they said 17.

3273
02:30:17,661 --> 02:30:20,850
See?
So we'd go to 17 c and the lady,

3274
02:30:20,851 --> 02:30:21,230
uh,
you know,

3275
02:30:21,380 --> 02:30:23,000
she speaks Portuguese.
So she's like,

3276
02:30:23,001 --> 02:30:23,270
no,
no,

3277
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:24,290
no,
day 24,

3278
02:30:24,291 --> 02:30:25,100
20 5:00
AM I,

3279
02:30:25,101 --> 02:30:30,101
but it doesn't say 24 slash slash eight.
So we go to 24 and 24 says floor 

3280
02:30:30,101 --> 02:30:32,080
Annapolis and it says another one next 
to it,

3281
02:30:32,081 --> 02:30:37,081
like what the fuck?
But they were saying it over the 

3282
02:30:37,081 --> 02:30:39,371
loudspeaker.
So all the people that are listening 

3283
02:30:39,371 --> 02:30:41,620
that spoke Portuguese knew that it was,
but there was no signs because there 

3284
02:30:41,620 --> 02:30:41,810
are.
It's a different world.

3285
02:30:41,811 --> 02:30:46,811
They have a different.
So it made me appreciate when you come 

3286
02:30:46,811 --> 02:30:46,811
back to America,
you look up at the fucking departures.

3287
02:30:46,811 --> 02:30:48,230
Oh there's the gate.
Here we go.

3288
02:30:48,400 --> 02:30:50,120
You know what,
if you only spoke mandarin,

3289
02:30:50,121 --> 02:30:52,100
the true,
it'd be fucked.

3290
02:30:52,190 --> 02:30:53,990
You'd be fucked.
We fucking just a bad hit.

3291
02:30:54,140 --> 02:30:58,010
Even worse because if I spoke mandarin 
and I was in Brazil,

3292
02:30:58,011 --> 02:30:59,220
I'd be double.
Fuck you.

3293
02:30:59,580 --> 02:31:04,580
You didn't even read what the fuck 
they're writing and they couldn't know 

3294
02:31:04,580 --> 02:31:07,601
what the hell you know,
you would go to your app on your phone 

3295
02:31:07,601 --> 02:31:10,931
and try to decipher it.
But point being like when when you see 

3296
02:31:10,931 --> 02:31:14,291
something like if you like,
if you go to like my buddy who went to 

3297
02:31:14,291 --> 02:31:17,171
Africa and experienced like all the 
chaos of Africa said God mean people 

3298
02:31:17,171 --> 02:31:19,350
complain about America like you to go,
yes,

3299
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:20,070
of course

3300
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:24,690
it's not perfect.
There is no utopia on this planet who is

3301
02:31:24,691 --> 02:31:26,880
Denmark Utopia.
I mean it's just like,

3302
02:31:27,030 --> 02:31:28,230
I think there were degrees,
right?

3303
02:31:28,231 --> 02:31:33,231
Like obviously Africa and many South 
American countries are going to be more 

3304
02:31:33,231 --> 02:31:37,140
screwed up then rich countries like 
America.

3305
02:31:37,190 --> 02:31:42,190
Right?
But then within the club of rich 

3306
02:31:42,190 --> 02:31:42,190
countries,
there are also countries where shit just

3307
02:31:42,190 --> 02:31:44,250
works.
It just easy stuff is easy.

3308
02:31:44,251 --> 02:31:49,251
I lived in Copenhagen for a semester and
went to university there in my early 

3309
02:31:49,251 --> 02:31:49,470
twenties and like,
you know,

3310
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:51,300
there's no lines at the post office.
There's no,

3311
02:31:51,330 --> 02:31:52,920
I mean granted there's no people who 
live there.

3312
02:31:52,921 --> 02:31:54,510
There's like 14 people in the whole 
country.

3313
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:58,110
But like it's still scalable.
You could actually have.

3314
02:31:58,130 --> 02:32:00,750
They still got a tax,
the same tax base per capita,

3315
02:32:01,060 --> 02:32:06,060
you know,
as America could have if it wanted to 

3316
02:32:06,060 --> 02:32:06,480
have higher taxes and you could actually
have a dmv that that works and you could

3317
02:32:06,481 --> 02:32:07,680
have a post office that functions.

3318
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:09,000
We don't have to wait around all the 
time.

3319
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:12,090
It's just A.
There's certainly societies that,

3320
02:32:12,560 --> 02:32:17,560
you know,
Thomas Friedman says that flying from 

3321
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:20,040
Schiphol airport in Amsterdam into JFK 
is like flying from the,

3322
02:32:20,070 --> 02:32:25,070
from the jetsons to the Flintstones,
like laguardia is a shit hole.

3323
02:32:26,210 --> 02:32:28,140
Then that's just the way it is.
You know,

3324
02:32:28,410 --> 02:32:33,410
there are countries whose airports are 
nice and who's trains of fast and these 

3325
02:32:33,410 --> 02:32:35,460
healthcare systems work more cheaply.
The worst though,

3326
02:32:35,610 --> 02:32:37,860
the way the people treat you at 
Laguardia,

3327
02:32:38,090 --> 02:32:42,150
there is so fucking over it and 
aggressively over it,

3328
02:32:42,151 --> 02:32:44,130
like Shitty to you.
Oh,

3329
02:32:44,190 --> 02:32:48,260
New York Tsa workers are my least 
favorite of all the TSA workers.

3330
02:32:48,270 --> 02:32:51,780
That's pretty bad.
So he asked them a question,

3331
02:32:53,550 --> 02:32:55,040
now that I've,
now that I've got,

3332
02:32:55,220 --> 02:32:58,290
I've got to tell you,
you're lucky that you have global entry.

3333
02:32:58,540 --> 02:33:00,390
Need to get it.
You gotta get it.

3334
02:33:01,190 --> 02:33:02,220
I'm a fucking idiot.

3335
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:03,540
I mean,
[inaudible] damn it,

3336
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:05,240
I just got my green card,
this,

3337
02:33:05,610 --> 02:33:08,190
I got my green card earlier this year 
and done to our country.

3338
02:33:08,191 --> 02:33:09,780
So thank you very much.
I hope you enjoy it.

3339
02:33:10,220 --> 02:33:12,210
I appreciate it.
I've been in 10 years,

3340
02:33:12,270 --> 02:33:13,230
but uh,
you know,

3341
02:33:13,930 --> 02:33:18,360
just on temporary visas and uh,
now that I was able to get global entry,

3342
02:33:18,390 --> 02:33:22,560
just not having to deal with the customs
officials coming in,

3343
02:33:22,620 --> 02:33:26,340
especially in the foreign as lane.
I mean I imagine it may be better in the

3344
02:33:26,341 --> 02:33:31,341
city and the citizens lane,
but coming in and the foreign is lane 

3345
02:33:31,341 --> 02:33:34,410
where you're in front of like they've 
just had to deal with 478.

3346
02:33:34,450 --> 02:33:39,450
Like people who don't speak English who 
are probably coming in with with some 

3347
02:33:39,450 --> 02:33:41,640
lousy shit from abroad or chicken in 
their back.

3348
02:33:41,660 --> 02:33:42,390
Yeah,
that's right.

3349
02:33:42,391 --> 02:33:42,840
Exactly.

3350
02:33:45,030 --> 02:33:48,240
In the backpack there no speak.
Oh,

3351
02:33:48,241 --> 02:33:52,670
how racist.
Josh zaps racist evolution.

3352
02:33:52,880 --> 02:33:54,950
It did not.
So he start tweeting.

3353
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:57,530
Can we do to help asshole?
I can't believe what he just did a.

3354
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:59,850
and so by the time I get,
I get up to the,

3355
02:33:59,910 --> 02:34:02,040
to the customs guy,
that pissed,

3356
02:34:02,041 --> 02:34:03,760
they're over it,
they're over me wherever,

3357
02:34:03,870 --> 02:34:08,870
everything.
So just being able to go to the kiosk 

3358
02:34:08,870 --> 02:34:08,870
and swept the global entry and then just
walk straight through.

3359
02:34:09,090 --> 02:34:12,930
It's one of the greatest things.
All the guys I work with the UFC habit.

3360
02:34:12,960 --> 02:34:14,970
I'm the only one who doesn't.
I'm fucking moron.

3361
02:34:15,270 --> 02:34:16,470
It's not hard.
Just busy,

3362
02:34:16,471 --> 02:34:18,040
bro.
I'm doing a lot of podcasts and shit.

3363
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:23,280
You are not a hard.
You make an appointment.

3364
02:34:24,480 --> 02:34:28,000
I go to cryotherapy five times a week.
I can't go to global entry apartment.

3365
02:34:28,001 --> 02:34:28,290
I'm.
Yeah.

3366
02:34:28,380 --> 02:34:31,360
You should not do it.
Should I agree with you?

3367
02:34:31,570 --> 02:34:33,700
I'm disappointed in myself as well.
He should be.

3368
02:34:33,910 --> 02:34:34,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

3369
02:34:35,010 --> 02:34:40,010
Is I wonder whether or not just on why 
people are angry at Richard Dawkins for 

3370
02:34:40,010 --> 02:34:41,280
saying something that obviously makes 
sense.

3371
02:34:41,380 --> 02:34:43,750
I think they're not really angry.
I don't believe they are angry.

3372
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:45,860
I don't.
You feel like

3373
02:34:46,270 --> 02:34:51,270
some people see the world in groups and 
identities and for them identity 

3374
02:34:52,181 --> 02:34:57,181
politics is the most important way of 
contextualizing and conceiving of the 

3375
02:34:57,181 --> 02:34:58,540
things that are happening around them in
culture.

3376
02:34:58,930 --> 02:35:03,160
So the moment a person who's a white 
male starts saying anything,

3377
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:04,390
they're like,
okay,

3378
02:35:04,391 --> 02:35:08,770
this is in the category of patronizing 
white male authority.

3379
02:35:09,310 --> 02:35:14,310
Looking down on this other category of 
person who is oppressed like religious 

3380
02:35:14,561 --> 02:35:19,561
minority.
So let's not actually listen to what's 

3381
02:35:19,561 --> 02:35:19,561
being said and let's not give anyone the
benefit of the doubt.

3382
02:35:20,110 --> 02:35:24,220
Let's just super impose that into the 
jigsaw puzzle in my brain,

3383
02:35:24,221 --> 02:35:27,370
which is like culture.
And when you say it also in,

3384
02:35:27,371 --> 02:35:32,371
in all of the,
all of the racial problems that have 

3385
02:35:32,371 --> 02:35:32,371
been happening in the past year in the 
United States.

3386
02:35:32,371 --> 02:35:35,500
And I'm totally on the side of the black
lives matter movement here.

3387
02:35:35,860 --> 02:35:38,030
And I have a huge problem with,
uh,

3388
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:42,790
with the brutality that police show 
towards towards minority communities.

3389
02:35:42,820 --> 02:35:47,820
But you got to make sure that you're 
actually talking on the same page about 

3390
02:35:47,820 --> 02:35:51,331
the ideas and the practices that you're 
not just caricaturing people into 

3391
02:35:51,331 --> 02:35:52,450
stereotypes of one another.
Right.

3392
02:35:52,451 --> 02:35:53,800
And I think maybe that's what's 
happening here.

3393
02:35:53,900 --> 02:35:55,220
I agree.
It might be.

3394
02:35:55,221 --> 02:35:57,260
I think that what's going on is like a 
game of hungry,

3395
02:35:57,261 --> 02:36:02,261
hungry hippo and there's a little marble
and they see that you can snatch that 

3396
02:36:02,261 --> 02:36:05,951
marble and they go for it.
I think it's an opening and I don't 

3397
02:36:05,951 --> 02:36:05,951
think it's logical and you know what I 
love,

3398
02:36:05,951 --> 02:36:09,230
I love when people who have these knee 
jerk reactions to these things,

3399
02:36:09,231 --> 02:36:11,810
like they see these openings and they'd 
go for it because they feel like there's

3400
02:36:11,811 --> 02:36:16,490
an opening to attack also get attacked.
Like there's a woman who wrote a piece,

3401
02:36:16,491 --> 02:36:21,491
she's a feminist and she wrote a piece 
about my friend Amy Schumer who is 

3402
02:36:21,491 --> 02:36:23,960
hilarious and wild and just fucking 
awesome.

3403
02:36:23,961 --> 02:36:27,800
And she's kicking ass right now and 
she's in the cover of a magazine sucking

3404
02:36:27,801 --> 02:36:32,801
on [inaudible] finger.
And there were saying why this magazine 

3405
02:36:32,801 --> 02:36:34,180
is so awful about,
you know,

3406
02:36:34,360 --> 02:36:35,330
against feminism.

3407
02:36:35,630 --> 02:36:36,440
And I was like,
shit,

3408
02:36:36,500 --> 02:36:39,660
what the fuck are you like,
this is an antifeminist thing.

3409
02:36:39,661 --> 02:36:41,290
And she shouldn't be sucking fingers.
Like,

3410
02:36:41,810 --> 02:36:44,840
as if like you're a woman,
you can't be sexual,

3411
02:36:44,841 --> 02:36:49,841
you know,
like isn't it like part of being a 

3412
02:36:49,841 --> 02:36:50,840
person who owns themselves owning all 
the things you enjoy?

3413
02:36:50,930 --> 02:36:52,970
Maybe she likes sucking fingers,
you know,

3414
02:36:52,980 --> 02:36:57,980
like she's a fucking picture of it.
That's fun.

3415
02:36:58,790 --> 02:36:59,900
Bad ass bitch.
Look at her.

3416
02:36:59,930 --> 02:37:01,100
She's so good.
I love her.

3417
02:37:01,160 --> 02:37:02,780
I love her.
She's gangster as fuck.

3418
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:05,900
But here's the thing.
This same woman wrote a bit of,

3419
02:37:05,901 --> 02:37:10,901
she wrote another piece because I like 
to follow knuckleheads showed another 

3420
02:37:10,901 --> 02:37:12,020
piece about how she's getting older and 
it's really kind of.

3421
02:37:12,230 --> 02:37:15,920
She's torn because she doesn't get cat 
called much anymore.

3422
02:37:16,910 --> 02:37:21,910
She's actually getting.
She's actually as conflicting opinions 

3423
02:37:21,910 --> 02:37:25,481
about this.
And so here's the tweet that drove me 

3424
02:37:25,481 --> 02:37:25,481
crazy.
It made me laugh.

3425
02:37:25,481 --> 02:37:29,320
I howled at my own computer.
Someone tweeted her saying that this 

3426
02:37:29,320 --> 02:37:33,620
article about being conflicted about not
being catcalled anymore.

3427
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:37,250
I felt like that was a very white cis 
piece.

3428
02:37:37,940 --> 02:37:39,410
White,
cisgender,

3429
02:37:39,650 --> 02:37:44,650
meaning that people of Color and trans 
people have to worry about being 

3430
02:37:44,650 --> 02:37:49,391
catcalled because trans people,
if their cat called and then someone 

3431
02:37:49,391 --> 02:37:52,991
finds out that the trans,
they can get beaten to death and you 

3432
02:37:52,991 --> 02:37:53,840
should be more aware that when you write
these pieces,

3433
02:37:53,930 --> 02:37:56,620
you're insensitive and true.
She could.

3434
02:37:56,630 --> 02:37:57,390
She had a.
She had a.

3435
02:37:57,590 --> 02:38:02,590
She had to acquiesce.
She had to like give into it because 

3436
02:38:02,590 --> 02:38:02,590
she's a part of that fucking retarded 
culture.

3437
02:38:02,590 --> 02:38:07,211
Right.
So she got stuck in our own bullshit 

3438
02:38:07,211 --> 02:38:09,020
ideology is the caveat.
Trans Women in particular,

3439
02:38:09,021 --> 02:38:12,020
but trans people in general are the 
victims of violence that way.

3440
02:38:12,020 --> 02:38:17,020
Higher rates than everybody else.
So let's just put that aside and say 

3441
02:38:17,020 --> 02:38:19,601
that that's a terrible thing and that we
should still be supportive of the Trans 

3442
02:38:19,601 --> 02:38:20,090
community,
but I mean,

3443
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:25,420
did you,
you heard about it was a college that 

3444
02:38:25,420 --> 02:38:27,641
canceled the vagina monologues because 
they were doing a production of the 

3445
02:38:27,641 --> 02:38:28,620
vagina monologues,
this popular feminist play.

3446
02:38:28,780 --> 02:38:29,480
Yes.
Yes.

3447
02:38:29,690 --> 02:38:33,440
The trend and the and the on campus 
trends community,

3448
02:38:33,490 --> 02:38:38,490
not even the on campus trans community.
There wasn't an on campus trans 

3449
02:38:38,490 --> 02:38:41,471
community.
The the on campus like liberal fucking 

3450
02:38:41,471 --> 02:38:45,191
knee jerk douchebag decided it was 
insensitive to trans to trans people 

3451
02:38:45,191 --> 02:38:45,830
because not all women have vaginas.

3452
02:38:48,060 --> 02:38:50,240
Someone when that Dick's.
Yeah,

3453
02:38:50,241 --> 02:38:53,180
and not all people are people.
My dog has a person.

3454
02:38:53,210 --> 02:38:56,300
My dog identifies as a person.
I don't know if you know that.

3455
02:38:56,360 --> 02:38:57,290
I didn't know that.
Well,

3456
02:38:57,291 --> 02:38:59,990
you be.
Be more respectful and sensitive because

3457
02:38:59,991 --> 02:39:01,730
not all.
Not all dogs are actually.

3458
02:39:01,731 --> 02:39:04,010
Human beings are.
Not all people are human beings,

3459
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:06,700
but I didn't.
I didn't follow that big live in fucking

3460
02:39:06,701 --> 02:39:08,310
fairy tale land.
That's what we are.

3461
02:39:08,530 --> 02:39:10,730
It's too easy to get food.
That's what's going on,

3462
02:39:10,860 --> 02:39:12,760
so people make up shit to get upset 
about it.

3463
02:39:12,770 --> 02:39:17,770
That's my feeling.
It's too easy to just go to the 

3464
02:39:17,770 --> 02:39:18,140
supermarket and pick up fucking cereal.
It's just too easy.

3465
02:39:18,410 --> 02:39:23,410
Here's the thing,
how you actually supposed to help 

3466
02:39:23,410 --> 02:39:25,511
people.
How are we supposed to be kind and 

3467
02:39:25,511 --> 02:39:28,901
considerate and generous.
Every time we try to we get shut down 

3468
02:39:28,901 --> 02:39:29,540
because we put our foot in it.

3469
02:39:29,540 --> 02:39:34,540
Like Dawkins.
Dawkins in that tweet about Islam is 

3470
02:39:34,540 --> 02:39:34,540
trying to support women.
Yes.

3471
02:39:34,540 --> 02:39:39,460
Like what could be wrong with that?
He tries to do that and then feminist 

3472
02:39:39,460 --> 02:39:43,001
jumped down his throat for being 
condescending towards women because 

3473
02:39:43,001 --> 02:39:43,001
Muslim women should be the ones who were
sticking up for Muslim women.

3474
02:39:43,070 --> 02:39:45,230
They don't need your white,
patriarchal,

3475
02:39:45,231 --> 02:39:50,231
Islamaphobic male,
a activity to in order to do so because 

3476
02:39:50,231 --> 02:39:52,030
they are proud and bold Muslim women.
Well,

3477
02:39:52,031 --> 02:39:57,031
not all of them are.
Some of them are in stuck in beekeepers 

3478
02:39:57,031 --> 02:39:59,441
outfits in Saudi Arabia.
So how do we help them if every time we 

3479
02:39:59,441 --> 02:39:59,630
try to help,
we get jumped.

3480
02:39:59,640 --> 02:40:00,590
We jumped on.
Well,

3481
02:40:00,591 --> 02:40:05,591
I think we have to negate the opinions 
of those people that write these posts 

3482
02:40:05,591 --> 02:40:07,190
for like the huff post,
write these articles.

3483
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:12,400
We have to negate them by mocking them 
because I think it is hilariously 

3484
02:40:12,400 --> 02:40:15,611
stupid.
I think that that opinion is a fucking 

3485
02:40:15,611 --> 02:40:15,611
hilariously

3486
02:40:15,611 --> 02:40:19,340
stupid that he doesn't have the right to
say that he has concern for people that 

3487
02:40:19,381 --> 02:40:22,290
are a different gender than him that 
have a different ideology than him.

3488
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:27,500
They'd live in a different part of the 
world and him that have more melanin in 

3489
02:40:27,500 --> 02:40:27,500
their skin.
That's ridiculous.

3490
02:40:27,500 --> 02:40:31,521
And I think what we're doing here by 
mocking that is really what the correct 

3491
02:40:31,521 --> 02:40:32,370
response is.
The only correct response.

3492
02:40:32,520 --> 02:40:34,140
You're not going to get that response 
from the news.

3493
02:40:34,141 --> 02:40:35,520
You're not going to get that from the 
president,

3494
02:40:36,030 --> 02:40:41,030
but didn't you get that from people that
don't have a vested interest in 

3495
02:40:41,030 --> 02:40:43,791
supporting one particular tribe.
And I think that's one of the things 

3496
02:40:43,791 --> 02:40:47,391
that they talked about in this merchants
of doubt documentary that I have really 

3497
02:40:47,391 --> 02:40:51,231
resonated with me,
is that a lot of times when people talk 

3498
02:40:51,231 --> 02:40:54,051
about global warming or they talk about 
fucking chem trails or any of these 

3499
02:40:54,051 --> 02:40:57,621
things,
there is a tribe of people that have 

3500
02:40:57,621 --> 02:40:59,871
subscribed to that ideology and it's 
very important that you support that 

3501
02:40:59,871 --> 02:40:59,871
tribe.
And it might.

3502
02:41:00,170 --> 02:41:05,170
It can it.
It manifests itself as in ridiculous 

3503
02:41:05,170 --> 02:41:06,810
places like the tribe of people that are
like android phones.

3504
02:41:06,970 --> 02:41:09,510
They love android phones and they hate 
iphones.

3505
02:41:09,650 --> 02:41:11,520
I have a friend who fucking hate.
She's.

3506
02:41:11,700 --> 02:41:13,890
She's brilliant.
She's a brilliant director.

3507
02:41:13,891 --> 02:41:16,440
She writes movies.
She's fucking great.

3508
02:41:16,500 --> 02:41:18,570
She hates Mac.
I hate Mac.

3509
02:41:18,571 --> 02:41:20,430
Everybody uses Mac.
I won't fucking use apple.

3510
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:21,390
I use windows.
I'm like,

3511
02:41:21,391 --> 02:41:23,820
what are you talking about,
Patty Gimme a hug.

3512
02:41:25,510 --> 02:41:28,260
It's Goddamn computer.
Don't get viruses.

3513
02:41:28,261 --> 02:41:28,980
The other ones do.

3514
02:41:29,270 --> 02:41:32,090
You're such a powerful individual for 
not being a Mac person.

3515
02:41:32,091 --> 02:41:33,980
Right.
It's like taking your.

3516
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:39,040
Yeah,
your rebelliousness by going with the 

3517
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:39,040
world's largest computer company.

3518
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:39,210
She knows.
It's ridiculous.

3519
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:42,720
She laughs when I make fun of it,
but she just fucking sticks to her guns.

3520
02:41:42,780 --> 02:41:44,910
She fucking digs their heels in the 
ground.

3521
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:47,260
What about going?
Wraps are risks around a cord.

3522
02:41:48,410 --> 02:41:51,070
I'm not going anywhere.
Madness.

3523
02:41:51,550 --> 02:41:56,550
Those people who when a new product 
comes out and it's usually an apple 

3524
02:41:56,550 --> 02:41:56,560
product,
they'll go out and they'll camp for four

3525
02:41:56,561 --> 02:42:00,240
or five days in order to be the first 
person who gets the light.

3526
02:42:00,250 --> 02:42:05,250
I do not under.
It reminded me a little bit of when you 

3527
02:42:05,250 --> 02:42:05,350
were talking about your buddy who did 
the massive mess of marathon,

3528
02:42:05,351 --> 02:42:08,530
but then came in fourth.
I always like I was watching,

3529
02:42:08,980 --> 02:42:13,980
I was watching the today show or 
something where they were interviewing 

3530
02:42:13,980 --> 02:42:14,590
the people who were standing in line and
they'd been there.

3531
02:42:14,591 --> 02:42:15,280
You know,
they've all got.

3532
02:42:15,580 --> 02:42:18,790
They've got tents and they got sleeping 
bags like they were on fifth avenue,

3533
02:42:18,791 --> 02:42:21,730
like near Central Park and they're 
sleeping on the sleeping,

3534
02:42:21,731 --> 02:42:25,960
camping for 72 hours and they were and 
the correspondent was talking to someone

3535
02:42:25,961 --> 02:42:30,961
who was like the seventh in line or 
something and I was like,

3536
02:42:33,490 --> 02:42:35,890
yeah,
I can understand spending a week outside

3537
02:42:35,891 --> 02:42:38,780
in to get the new iphone if you're 
number one thing,

3538
02:42:39,160 --> 02:42:42,250
number seven,
even better than being like number 342.

3539
02:42:42,251 --> 02:42:43,120
What differences.
Oh,

3540
02:42:43,121 --> 02:42:44,440
I got the seventh iphone.

3541
02:42:45,170 --> 02:42:46,310
He's in the middle.
Like.

3542
02:42:47,110 --> 02:42:49,610
Do you think that that's what what,
what is,

3543
02:42:49,611 --> 02:42:54,611
what is it about people that are going 
to get something that doesn't even do 

3544
02:42:54,611 --> 02:42:54,611
anything different?
Yeah,

3545
02:42:54,611 --> 02:42:56,810
like the smartest person I know is this 
woman,

3546
02:42:56,811 --> 02:42:58,720
Dr Rhonda Patrick.
She does my podcast,

3547
02:42:58,730 --> 02:43:00,800
all podcasts all the time.
She's absolutely brilliant.

3548
02:43:00,980 --> 02:43:02,360
She has an iphone four.
Right?

3549
02:43:02,600 --> 02:43:05,390
It's an old piece of shit.
It's the size of my thumbnail.

3550
02:43:05,470 --> 02:43:07,250
It doesn't even like run,
run,

3551
02:43:07,620 --> 02:43:08,470
run.
And I like.

3552
02:43:08,471 --> 02:43:13,471
There's so many apps,
like even now until I recently didn't 

3553
02:43:13,471 --> 02:43:13,471
have any space on

3554
02:43:13,471 --> 02:43:14,350
my phone to five,
she's smarter than me.

3555
02:43:14,351 --> 02:43:17,380
I got a big fucking stupid six.
There you go.

3556
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,050
That's the new thing is the new thing 
one,

3557
02:43:20,080 --> 02:43:21,850
one generation back.
You know,

3558
02:43:21,890 --> 02:43:24,130
I didn't even realize there was a six.
Wow,

3559
02:43:24,190 --> 02:43:25,620
you're amazing.
I'm like that.

3560
02:43:25,630 --> 02:43:27,790
That's how cool I am.
The type of individual I am Joe.

3561
02:43:27,910 --> 02:43:32,910
I'm like,
I'm so like totes out of like the whole 

3562
02:43:32,910 --> 02:43:34,210
like keep up with the Jones' 
Gizmodo.com.

3563
02:43:35,350 --> 02:43:40,350
Live in Brooklyn and eat Kale.
Kale is even better because they don't 

3564
02:43:40,350 --> 02:43:43,150
grow Kale in Brooklyn.
We have it flown in from Brazil.

3565
02:43:46,170 --> 02:43:51,170
So this,
I didn't have any room on my phone to 

3566
02:43:51,170 --> 02:43:54,631
upgrade to the latest software.
So for ages I was still running the on 

3567
02:43:54,631 --> 02:43:56,650
the older software and gradually your 
apps just stop working.

3568
02:43:56,710 --> 02:44:01,710
Like stuff just doesn't even work.
Like you open up the American Airlines 

3569
02:44:01,710 --> 02:44:02,740
APP and it's like this is no longer 
supported by this software.

3570
02:44:02,741 --> 02:44:04,540
So they keep you up,
they keep you on your toes.

3571
02:44:04,610 --> 02:44:09,250
I still have an older software to have 
the newest software because I don't have

3572
02:44:09,260 --> 02:44:11,920
a new software on my computer either.
I heard fucking crashes.

3573
02:44:12,500 --> 02:44:14,090
Um,
I wait a long time.

3574
02:44:14,091 --> 02:44:16,930
Man may take some time.
There's A.

3575
02:44:16,930 --> 02:44:21,930
I was to be in a plastic surgeon in 
Australia about penile enlargement 

3576
02:44:21,930 --> 02:44:22,210
surgery.
Done.

3577
02:44:22,220 --> 02:44:24,880
Ask.
Is it work?

3578
02:44:25,150 --> 02:44:27,940
Is that done at the end?
I have,

3579
02:44:27,970 --> 02:44:29,220
but um,
yeah,

3580
02:44:29,360 --> 02:44:31,990
but they're a bit.
It has some side effects.

3581
02:44:32,020 --> 02:44:37,020
What's the side effects?
Your Dick flips around in weird ways 

3582
02:44:37,020 --> 02:44:37,020
when it.

3583
02:44:37,020 --> 02:44:37,020
That's when they cut the tendon.
Yeah.

3584
02:44:37,020 --> 02:44:39,700
That's not so it doesn't religion.
If you have a micro Dick,

3585
02:44:39,701 --> 02:44:40,990
what?
You're going to get an extra inch.

3586
02:44:40,991 --> 02:44:42,130
Woah.
Congratulations.

3587
02:44:42,131 --> 02:44:44,290
Now you have two inches.
It's mostly just for vain people.

3588
02:44:44,291 --> 02:44:47,200
It's not for micro Dick People,
but then also they can take fat out of,

3589
02:44:47,290 --> 02:44:51,570
out of other parts of your body and then
they'll put fat in around the edges,

3590
02:44:51,571 --> 02:44:54,100
but thins fat and smushy.
No one wants that.

3591
02:44:54,160 --> 02:44:55,960
Anyway,
my point is simply this,

3592
02:44:55,990 --> 02:44:59,140
I wasn't intending to talk about do a 
little Dick.

3593
02:44:59,141 --> 02:45:01,150
Dude's getting getting bigger dicks 
asteroids.

3594
02:45:01,210 --> 02:45:04,420
He said that there's a maximum in in 
medicine that you should never be either

3595
02:45:04,421 --> 02:45:07,510
the first nor the last to adopt a new 
procedure.

3596
02:45:08,090 --> 02:45:09,520
Hmm.
That's a good smart.

3597
02:45:09,521 --> 02:45:14,521
That's my way towards on phones.
I have my philosophy on technology on 

3598
02:45:14,521 --> 02:45:15,250
the basis of penile enlargement surgery.

3599
02:45:15,550 --> 02:45:17,650
Well,
I wait a little while,

3600
02:45:17,651 --> 02:45:22,120
but I'm not the last person to adopt,
but I'm probably like third.

3601
02:45:22,900 --> 02:45:25,370
I'm like in the third wave.
I'm not enough.

3602
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:28,160
I'm not waiting in line for shit.
I'll tell you that right now.

3603
02:45:28,161 --> 02:45:29,890
I'm not waiting in line for a fucking 
phone.

3604
02:45:29,910 --> 02:45:33,910
It's never ran out the kinks anyway.
Unless the phone does like holograms.

3605
02:45:33,940 --> 02:45:35,890
Once you put the phone down,
help me Obi wan.

3606
02:45:36,040 --> 02:45:41,040
You're my only hope like Amy Schumer 
pops up and fucking dances for you.

3607
02:45:41,141 --> 02:45:43,060
Then then I'll take it.
When that happens,

3608
02:45:43,061 --> 02:45:44,570
you're going to then realized that there
you go.

3609
02:45:44,610 --> 02:45:47,080
You'll be one of the first adopters and 
then they'll realize it gives you.

3610
02:45:47,081 --> 02:45:48,820
It's radioactive and it gives you cancer
and you'll die.

3611
02:45:50,040 --> 02:45:55,040
God Damn it.
Turn your smartphone into a three d 

3612
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:55,040
hologram.
Is this real?

3613
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:56,080
Oh my God.
So piece of glass.

3614
02:45:56,081 --> 02:45:58,170
You stick on your on top of your thigh.
Just tell us here.

3615
02:45:58,210 --> 02:46:03,210
That just popped in my head.
Why it makes a little hologram on your 

3616
02:46:03,210 --> 02:46:03,210
smart phone.
Seriously,

3617
02:46:03,210 --> 02:46:04,780
using glass.
Well,

3618
02:46:04,781 --> 02:46:09,781
we're really close to these new goggles 
that they're creating where even right 

3619
02:46:09,781 --> 02:46:09,980
now

3620
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:12,350
they look like ski goggles,
but eventually they're going to be like,

3621
02:46:12,380 --> 02:46:15,950
like sunglasses that are the new 
desktop.

3622
02:46:15,980 --> 02:46:17,210
That is incredible.
Look at that.

3623
02:46:17,211 --> 02:46:18,410
That's amazing.
That's cool.

3624
02:46:18,800 --> 02:46:21,350
What does that magic leap?
What does that,

3625
02:46:21,390 --> 02:46:23,570
that technology.
Was it called magic leap?

3626
02:46:24,140 --> 02:46:29,140
They're going to have that technology,
which is also like a Hologram that you 

3627
02:46:29,140 --> 02:46:29,690
can hold in your hand.
I don't know exactly how that works,

3628
02:46:29,691 --> 02:46:32,780
but there's another version of it that.
Is it just being fired out of your phone

3629
02:46:32,781 --> 02:46:33,860
or what?
Or out of a laptop.

3630
02:46:34,220 --> 02:46:37,340
They're being very secretive about it 
and they've shown some demonstrations of

3631
02:46:37,341 --> 02:46:42,341
it,
but only the demonstration in the fact 

3632
02:46:42,341 --> 02:46:44,411
that you can see like there's a little 
girl that's watching a ballerina on her 

3633
02:46:44,411 --> 02:46:45,590
bed dancing around the ballerina.
It's like four inches high.

3634
02:46:45,770 --> 02:46:47,710
It's incredible.
It looks amazing.

3635
02:46:47,711 --> 02:46:49,790
It looks like this,
like this is magic leap.

3636
02:46:50,210 --> 02:46:53,300
They don't explain it,
but that's going to be this.

3637
02:46:53,410 --> 02:46:54,860
Not Cgi.
It's not a real.

3638
02:46:54,870 --> 02:46:55,310
No,
no,

3639
02:46:55,311 --> 02:46:55,820
no,
no.

3640
02:46:55,821 --> 02:46:57,980
It's not CGI.
We're looking at a little.

3641
02:46:57,981 --> 02:47:01,830
We're looking at a little tiny total in 
the palm of someone's hand with a tinier

3642
02:47:01,850 --> 02:47:02,810
puppy.
Like,

3643
02:47:02,811 --> 02:47:05,960
look at this.
There's somehow they're going to be able

3644
02:47:05,961 --> 02:47:09,350
to broadcast holograms and it's not done
yet.

3645
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:14,760
This is like some technology that's 
proof of concept and it's in the middle 

3646
02:47:14,760 --> 02:47:18,460
of being developed,
but then there's another one that's 

3647
02:47:18,460 --> 02:47:21,910
similar but different.
What was the one that Google one with 

3648
02:47:21,910 --> 02:47:21,910
the goggles.
Jamie,

3649
02:47:21,910 --> 02:47:23,270
do you remember that one?
Microsoft Hollow Lens.

3650
02:47:23,300 --> 02:47:24,080
That's it.
Yeah.

3651
02:47:24,081 --> 02:47:25,460
Sorry.
I'm in.

3652
02:47:25,461 --> 02:47:28,850
The Hollow Lens is going to be able to 
change a room into a desktop.

3653
02:47:28,870 --> 02:47:30,740
Say like a video game that you're 
playing,

3654
02:47:30,741 --> 02:47:32,270
like say if you want to play like call 
of duty.

3655
02:47:32,500 --> 02:47:35,990
He play call of duty in an empty room 
and the whole room will be the desktop.

3656
02:47:36,410 --> 02:47:37,040
I'm like,
yeah,

3657
02:47:37,041 --> 02:47:37,460
yeah,
yeah.

3658
02:47:37,461 --> 02:47:39,590
They have.
Did they have demonstrations of that and

3659
02:47:39,591 --> 02:47:44,591
they have like,
like minority report that will you 

3660
02:47:44,591 --> 02:47:49,120
scroll and you.
You'll be able to spin cubes around the 

3661
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:49,580
air and hold them and Muslim like,
look at this.

3662
02:47:49,730 --> 02:47:51,890
This is real.
This is how they're gonna.

3663
02:47:51,891 --> 02:47:53,200
Be able to do it.
This is going to be,

3664
02:47:53,201 --> 02:47:55,730
you need to be aware of these.
You're going to be spread,

3665
02:47:55,790 --> 02:47:57,560
pinch,
walk around your house.

3666
02:47:57,561 --> 02:47:59,120
These fucking right now,
they're goofy.

3667
02:47:59,360 --> 02:48:02,250
They're these giant,
huge ski goggles.

3668
02:48:02,330 --> 02:48:04,520
So exciting when you get,
when you're actually going to be able to

3669
02:48:04,521 --> 02:48:09,521
have three dimensional interactivity 
with computer generated images.

3670
02:48:09,710 --> 02:48:14,710
I mean,
it's fairly inevitable if you think 

3671
02:48:14,710 --> 02:48:14,710
about,
look at this,

3672
02:48:14,710 --> 02:48:16,520
like how she's there,
she's already have something like this.

3673
02:48:16,521 --> 02:48:21,521
There's a virtual reality program that 
architects can use where they can walk 

3674
02:48:21,521 --> 02:48:23,330
through the house before it's been built
based on their designs and they can be.

3675
02:48:23,330 --> 02:48:24,140
Yeah.
And they can,

3676
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:26,480
they can do stuff like this where they 
can be like,

3677
02:48:26,481 --> 02:48:31,481
alright,
let's just extend this wool by another 

3678
02:48:31,481 --> 02:48:31,481
three inches and see what that looks 
like.

3679
02:48:31,481 --> 02:48:34,160
And then they can actually take people 
who are prospective buyers of properties

3680
02:48:34,430 --> 02:48:38,060
on three dimensional virtual reality 
tours of the house that isn't even built

3681
02:48:38,061 --> 02:48:38,900
yet.
Look at this.

3682
02:48:38,901 --> 02:48:43,150
This is showing an instructional from 
how to put together a pipe on a,

3683
02:48:43,151 --> 02:48:48,151
um,
a piece of plumbing and under your sink 

3684
02:48:48,151 --> 02:48:50,740
and it's showing like the,
the actual applications where you could 

3685
02:48:50,740 --> 02:48:52,160
use something for instructional 
purposes.

3686
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:54,470
So it's just amazing.
And this is,

3687
02:48:54,590 --> 02:48:59,590
this is almost inevitable,
just as crazy as what we were talking 

3688
02:48:59,590 --> 02:49:03,311
about before.
We could send videos to other parts of 

3689
02:49:03,311 --> 02:49:04,700
the world and skype instantaneously.
All this stuff is just next level stuff.

3690
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:06,320
It's probably not that far off as well.

3691
02:49:06,320 --> 02:49:11,320
This isn't like in the future.
This is the kind of stuff that we're 

3692
02:49:11,320 --> 02:49:11,490
going to be using and dealing with 
probably an in 10 years.

3693
02:49:11,670 --> 02:49:13,440
Look at what he just showed that was,
um,

3694
02:49:13,470 --> 02:49:17,580
that was a three d,
virtual reality version of the,

3695
02:49:17,750 --> 02:49:20,300
of the surface of Mars backup a little 
bit more.

3696
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:21,330
Jamie like,
look at this.

3697
02:49:21,630 --> 02:49:26,630
That's real too.
They're going to be able to send one of 

3698
02:49:26,630 --> 02:49:26,630
these rovers to Mars.
You're gonna.

3699
02:49:26,630 --> 02:49:28,590
Be able to walk around on Mars and see 
it as if it's really right there.

3700
02:49:28,830 --> 02:49:33,830
I'll tell you what will be a game 
changer for virtual reality and three 

3701
02:49:33,830 --> 02:49:36,501
dimensional stuff like this will be 
pulling be a game that when when you get

3702
02:49:37,591 --> 02:49:42,591
a virtual reality headset and some kind 
of like suit device that allows people 

3703
02:49:42,811 --> 02:49:45,420
to feel,
feel,

3704
02:49:45,421 --> 02:49:47,880
feel,
touches on actually some kind of like,

3705
02:49:48,020 --> 02:49:49,000
I don't know,
you know,

3706
02:49:49,030 --> 02:49:54,030
I messed up patient thing or they 
already on you then then get linked up 

3707
02:49:54,030 --> 02:49:56,880
to a virtual reality that actually looks
not like a three d robot human,

3708
02:49:57,090 --> 02:50:02,090
but kind of like an actual plausible 
human being that is going to make so 

3709
02:50:02,090 --> 02:50:02,090
much money.

3710
02:50:02,090 --> 02:50:03,300
Yes.
Yeah.

3711
02:50:03,301 --> 02:50:04,890
Well it's already.
It's already happened.

3712
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:07,400
They already have that.
What does that technology called again?

3713
02:50:07,420 --> 02:50:09,600
The one that Duncan's always ready to.
Oculus rift,

3714
02:50:10,830 --> 02:50:15,830
they put the goggles on.
They have for first person interactive 

3715
02:50:15,830 --> 02:50:19,641
porn where you put your Dick into a 
machine and the machine sort of strokes 

3716
02:50:19,641 --> 02:50:21,900
your deck and you're having sex with 
someone in first person.

3717
02:50:22,120 --> 02:50:23,130
Yeah,
they already have it.

3718
02:50:23,550 --> 02:50:24,840
It's crazy.
Not only that,

3719
02:50:24,841 --> 02:50:29,841
it coincides.
The movements coincide to a computer 

3720
02:50:29,841 --> 02:50:29,841
program that coincides with the action 
that you're seeing.

3721
02:50:29,841 --> 02:50:31,890
That's what you'd want it to actually 
feel.

3722
02:50:31,960 --> 02:50:33,900
I mean,
the advances that are coming in,

3723
02:50:33,901 --> 02:50:37,750
all of that kind of stuff in the next 
decade is going to be mind boggling.

3724
02:50:37,770 --> 02:50:42,770
Well,
I think that goes back to what we're 

3725
02:50:42,770 --> 02:50:44,030
talking about about future civilizations
that do these civilizations that exist 

3726
02:50:44,030 --> 02:50:48,471
out there in the cosmos,
they have radar or are they transcended 

3727
02:50:48,471 --> 02:50:48,471
that and they have.

3728
02:50:48,471 --> 02:50:51,240
They gone into virtual because I think 
once,

3729
02:50:51,270 --> 02:50:53,610
once we realized that virtual can be 
Avatar,

3730
02:50:53,611 --> 02:50:57,630
we can live inside some fantastic world.
It's so much more rewarding and exciting

3731
02:50:57,631 --> 02:51:02,631
and why bother with the regular carbon 
based life world?

3732
02:51:02,880 --> 02:51:04,710
Why do we need everything to be real?
Why?

3733
02:51:04,711 --> 02:51:06,960
Why?
Because I can knock on this table.

3734
02:51:07,080 --> 02:51:10,620
Why is this table better than a table 
that I feel like I can knock on,

3735
02:51:10,830 --> 02:51:13,320
but it's way better and every time I 
touch it it gives me love.

3736
02:51:13,380 --> 02:51:16,500
Well this is the problem that's raised 
by the film.

3737
02:51:16,501 --> 02:51:17,220
The Matrix,
isn't it?

3738
02:51:17,221 --> 02:51:19,860
I mean it become sort of a punchline of 
light blue pill,

3739
02:51:19,861 --> 02:51:24,861
red pill,
but it's actually a profound 

3740
02:51:24,861 --> 02:51:24,861
philosophical question.
Would you rather,

3741
02:51:24,861 --> 02:51:28,580
you know,
do what the bad guy does in the matrix 

3742
02:51:28,580 --> 02:51:31,251
when he sells them all out and decides 
that he's going to go back into the 

3743
02:51:31,251 --> 02:51:32,040
matrix and have his,
his memory of the Matrix,

3744
02:51:32,150 --> 02:51:35,420
it'd be a raised and he'll live like the
life of a road rich celebrity,

3745
02:51:35,810 --> 02:51:39,240
or do you prefer the tragedy of reality 
knowing that it's actually true,

3746
02:51:39,241 --> 02:51:42,600
but then what does it mean to say that 
reality is actually true or true,

3747
02:51:42,601 --> 02:51:44,240
uh,
than a matrix would.

3748
02:51:44,320 --> 02:51:45,930
Right?
And why does it have to be?

3749
02:51:45,960 --> 02:51:50,960
Why does,
why does everything that's real have to 

3750
02:51:50,960 --> 02:51:51,720
be real in only the way we understand it
today.

3751
02:51:51,960 --> 02:51:56,960
It's just as we've come accustomed to,
and even our own real of today has 

3752
02:51:56,960 --> 02:51:59,030
become very bizarre.
Like the real money,

3753
02:51:59,370 --> 02:52:04,370
the real of money used to be.
You had a leather sack filled with gold 

3754
02:52:04,370 --> 02:52:05,440
coins and you carry that around.
Someone could steal it from you.

3755
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:06,070
Now

3756
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:09,220
it's bitcoin and it's on your phone and 
it's just digits,

3757
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:11,260
digits that have no relationship to 
anything.

3758
02:52:11,540 --> 02:52:16,540
It's preparing us for this inevitable 
artificial weird world of something that

3759
02:52:17,351 --> 02:52:19,060
we have.
And it's not even artificial,

3760
02:52:19,210 --> 02:52:22,210
it's just a new level of life.
It's a new thing.

3761
02:52:22,270 --> 02:52:27,270
I think that's a really good point to 
point out that it's not artificial 

3762
02:52:27,270 --> 02:52:27,270
because look at what we're doing right 
now.

3763
02:52:27,270 --> 02:52:32,190
We're having a conversation which is 
going through technology that half 

3764
02:52:32,190 --> 02:52:32,410
century ago would have been 
inconceivable,

3765
02:52:32,411 --> 02:52:37,411
which is being viewed by people who are 
watching us in real time and also 

3766
02:52:37,411 --> 02:52:41,221
listened to by people who were carrying 
around devices in their pockets who are 

3767
02:52:41,221 --> 02:52:44,851
able to listen to us at any point in 
time after the fact and those devices 

3768
02:52:44,851 --> 02:52:46,060
would have been unimaginable a few 
decades ago.

3769
02:52:46,390 --> 02:52:50,650
And yet what we're actually doing is as 
authentic and as old as time.

3770
02:52:50,860 --> 02:52:51,940
Which is what happened to conversation.

3771
02:52:52,090 --> 02:52:57,090
Absolutely.
And we're having a conversation that's 

3772
02:52:57,090 --> 02:52:59,161
fueled by this digital interface that we
have in front of us that's allowing us 

3773
02:52:59,161 --> 02:53:03,511
to,
in real time get information in a way 

3774
02:53:03,511 --> 02:53:03,511
that was never possible just a couple of
decades ago.

3775
02:53:03,700 --> 02:53:06,160
We can get all this information and what
was that?

3776
02:53:06,161 --> 02:53:06,760
Jamie?
Boom.

3777
02:53:06,761 --> 02:53:09,320
He pulls it up.
We see it up on the big screens.

3778
02:53:09,321 --> 02:53:11,530
I mean,
we're living right now in the matrix.

3779
02:53:11,560 --> 02:53:15,160
We're living in like a baby matrix.
Do you think it matters though?

3780
02:53:15,380 --> 02:53:20,200
I mean I have visions of like people who
just spend all their days in the,

3781
02:53:20,201 --> 02:53:23,380
in their basements,
plugged into a virtual reality machine.

3782
02:53:23,580 --> 02:53:28,580
We'd like a drip in there.
I'm providing them with sustenance and 

3783
02:53:28,580 --> 02:53:29,230
just are off in this other universe of 
their own.

3784
02:53:29,690 --> 02:53:34,690
How is that then people that are 
listening to this while they're playing 

3785
02:53:34,690 --> 02:53:37,060
video games and drinking mountain dew,
I mean the idea that you have to live in

3786
02:53:37,061 --> 02:53:40,330
the real world in order to be valid,
like why?

3787
02:53:40,720 --> 02:53:42,550
Well,
I mean the only reason why is because we

3788
02:53:42,551 --> 02:53:45,130
have needs.
We have needs for companionship and love

3789
02:53:45,131 --> 02:53:48,460
and friendship and it's good to go 
outside and smell the fresh air,

3790
02:53:48,640 --> 02:53:51,850
but when they figured out a way to make 
oculus rift,

3791
02:53:51,851 --> 02:53:54,730
you put on a headset and it's way better
than regular fresh air.

3792
02:53:54,820 --> 02:53:56,530
I think you're onto something with 
companionship.

3793
02:53:56,560 --> 02:53:59,110
I think that gets to the nub of my 
concern about it,

3794
02:53:59,140 --> 02:54:04,140
that as long as that person who's laying
in their basement plugged into an ivy 

3795
02:54:04,140 --> 02:54:08,730
and living in a virtual reality world is
interacting with actual other human 

3796
02:54:08,730 --> 02:54:09,340
beings who were also in that virtual 
world.

3797
02:54:09,640 --> 02:54:12,640
I have less of a problem with it,
but if he's interacting with avatars who

3798
02:54:12,850 --> 02:54:17,850
aren't actual human beings but who give 
him all of the feedback that we need 

3799
02:54:17,850 --> 02:54:21,721
from companionship and he's living in a 
fake world where there is no 

3800
02:54:21,721 --> 02:54:25,111
reciprocation,
like I'm pretty confident that you 

3801
02:54:25,111 --> 02:54:25,111
actually have a consciousness.

3802
02:54:25,111 --> 02:54:26,890
You might be a robot,
but I'm pretty confident that what we're

3803
02:54:27,160 --> 02:54:28,710
doing in your imagination.
Yeah.

3804
02:54:28,720 --> 02:54:30,970
You might be.
He might be dreaming right now.

3805
02:54:31,030 --> 02:54:36,030
Yes,
but I'm pretty confident that you are a 

3806
02:54:36,030 --> 02:54:36,160
human being and that you are actually at
that.

3807
02:54:36,161 --> 02:54:38,980
I am currently engaged in an actual 
conscious exchange.

3808
02:54:39,370 --> 02:54:41,830
Whereas if you are an Avatar and I was 
in virtual reality,

3809
02:54:42,400 --> 02:54:44,320
I think that would be a loss.
What?

3810
02:54:44,321 --> 02:54:46,420
You know the concept of simulation 
theory,

3811
02:54:46,421 --> 02:54:47,320
I'm sure.
Right?

3812
02:54:47,380 --> 02:54:52,380
Yeah.
The concept being for those are not 

3813
02:54:52,380 --> 02:54:54,391
aware of it,
is that one day we were going to not 

3814
02:54:54,391 --> 02:54:55,450
wait because I'm dumb,
but someone way smarter than us.

3815
02:54:55,451 --> 02:54:58,570
He's going to figure out a way to create
this sort of oculus rift thing,

3816
02:54:58,571 --> 02:55:03,571
next level stuff that we're discussing 
right now to a point where it's you 

3817
02:55:03,951 --> 02:55:04,400
can't

3818
02:55:04,400 --> 02:55:06,740
tell the difference between this and 
reality.

3819
02:55:06,770 --> 02:55:11,770
It is inevitable.
They're going to eventually figure it 

3820
02:55:11,770 --> 02:55:14,441
out.
Just like the stuff that we're looking 

3821
02:55:14,441 --> 02:55:16,331
at right now is sort of the beginning 
stages of this inevitable technology 

3822
02:55:16,331 --> 02:55:20,231
that's going to transform via whatever,
whatever mode that they figured out how 

3823
02:55:21,231 --> 02:55:23,750
to do and you're going to be able to 
have an artificial reality.

3824
02:55:23,751 --> 02:55:26,180
It's indistinguishable from reality that
we currently experience.

3825
02:55:26,510 --> 02:55:31,510
If that's the case,
how do we know that we haven't already 

3826
02:55:31,510 --> 02:55:32,990
gotten there and why would they tell 
you?

3827
02:55:32,991 --> 02:55:34,340
Why would you not?
I mean if,

3828
02:55:34,440 --> 02:55:37,700
if you are in a virtual reality,
if you are in an artificial,

3829
02:55:37,701 --> 02:55:41,540
simulated version of the world we live 
in and it's so good,

3830
02:55:41,750 --> 02:55:46,750
you can't distinguish,
how do you know that it's not already 

3831
02:55:46,750 --> 02:55:49,181
happening?
How do you know what's going on right 

3832
02:55:49,181 --> 02:55:49,181
now?
You don't,

3833
02:55:49,181 --> 02:55:51,640
and there's one mode of strand of 
logical argument in that philosophy 

3834
02:55:51,640 --> 02:55:56,291
which says that big,
we're probably likely to invent that 

3835
02:55:56,811 --> 02:56:00,290
kind of technology and a fairly fairly 
early in the evolution of our,

3836
02:56:00,410 --> 02:56:03,560
of the human rights of our civilization.
If you think about the dinosaurs,

3837
02:56:03,590 --> 02:56:05,150
having lived for hundreds of millions of
years,

3838
02:56:05,151 --> 02:56:07,580
we've only been around for a few hundred
thousand or something,

3839
02:56:07,850 --> 02:56:10,070
then we're probably going to get to that
point really soon.

3840
02:56:10,550 --> 02:56:15,550
Then this argument says it's very,
very likely that we actually are in the 

3841
02:56:15,550 --> 02:56:19,991
simulation already because we've got 
hundreds of millions of years in the 

3842
02:56:19,991 --> 02:56:20,330
simulation and only maybe 100,000
years,

3843
02:56:20,331 --> 02:56:22,940
not in the simulation at the very,
very dawn of our species.

3844
02:56:23,180 --> 02:56:26,150
So odds are we're probably already in 
it,

3845
02:56:26,420 --> 02:56:28,360
which I don't really buy,
but I think as acute argument,

3846
02:56:28,390 --> 02:56:28,700
so

3847
02:56:28,780 --> 02:56:31,570
con that ladies and gentlemen,
that's the end of the podcast.

3848
02:56:31,690 --> 02:56:33,550
Thank you very much josh.
You're awesome.

3849
02:56:33,551 --> 02:56:38,551
And like I said,
it's very few people that I would do a 

3850
02:56:38,551 --> 02:56:38,551
podcast immediately after landing from 
Brazil,

3851
02:56:38,551 --> 02:56:40,120
but I always enjoy our conversations,
checkout way the people live,

3852
02:56:40,121 --> 02:56:41,410
WTP,
[inaudible] dot com.

3853
02:56:41,500 --> 02:56:46,500
It's a good podcast.
And twitter is WTP school alive or just 

3854
02:56:46,500 --> 02:56:49,960
send us an email and Paul Graham.
Then a dollar sign,

3855
02:56:49,990 --> 02:56:54,990
WTP,
underscore live at twitter and huff post

3856
02:56:55,991 --> 02:56:56,830
live.
Awesome.

3857
02:56:56,831 --> 02:57:00,760
Show and thank you.
We can do a thousand of these when I,

3858
02:57:01,250 --> 02:57:02,800
if I moved to La,
we'll just do it every week.

3859
02:57:02,840 --> 02:57:04,540
Are you thinking about it?
It's possible.

3860
02:57:04,600 --> 02:57:07,630
Move motherfucker.
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,

3861
02:57:07,631 --> 02:57:10,480
we'll be back.
We'll be back soon.

3862
02:57:10,930 --> 02:57:15,930
I forget when,
but I got a lot of good guests this 

3863
02:57:15,930 --> 02:57:15,930
week.
Stay tuned.

3864
02:57:15,930 --> 02:57:15,930
Freaks.
Alright.

3865
02:57:15,930 --> 02:57:16,570
See you soon.
Much love.

3866
02:57:16,750 --> 02:57:17,560
Big Kiss to everybody.

3867
02:57:17,630 --> 02:57:17,950
Wow.

3868
02:57:33,570 --> 02:57:33,730
Yeah.
