1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,980
Joe rogan experience podcast.

2
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,700
Why can't,
why can't that work?

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,100
It was.
The computer is restarted in it.

4
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,550
Every time this computer restarts,
all the sounds fucked up on it.

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,620
We will soon be free of this 
technological nightmare and into a new 

6
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,150
one.
And Gentlemen,

7
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:36,680
we've got to try castor coming.
We tried to order the Sony thing,

8
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:41,300
but it didn't work for us.
It just wasn't for streaming.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,990
It wasn't the right piece of equipment.
So we're getting a tri caster,

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,030
but John headphone don't give a fuck 
about that.

11
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:50,060
Ladies and gentlemen,
John have fraud comic standing.

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,640
Hilarious comedian.
It's been awhile.

13
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,080
It's been awhile since I've been on 
here.

14
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,820
It's been a while since I see you.
First Time I saw you at the store.

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,290
So we haven't seen each other in two 
years.

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:00,870
Three?
Yeah.

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,720
Yeah,
because I had to do that thing where you

18
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:03,940
tax them,
like who?

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,540
I don't even know what I mean.
And then like all my famous friends,

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,800
I never put their names in my phone as 
their real names.

21
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,750
Who am I?
I would probably,

22
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:17,380
I think probably don't tell me because 
then yeah.

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,130
Yeah.
So just just in case,

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,480
not that I'm,
I'm like,

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,720
but just in case you lose your phone,
like I was wondering like really famous 

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,101
people who have famous friends like 
Paris Hilton loses their phone all the 

27
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:33,330
time and then two people hack into it 
and get Lindsey Lohan summer.

28
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,350
I mean it's kind of hard to hack into an
iphone unless it's connected to the 

29
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:38,350
cloud.
Right.

30
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,100
Like if they got ahold of it,
probably be pretty difficult.

31
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:45,150
Crack your pass code.
They actually I think have programs I 

32
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,690
teach,
they're just logging in and I'd like 

33
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,201
taxi drivers I think do it and it turns 
off all the tracking and then they 

34
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:49,570
resell it like immediately.
Really?

35
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:50,710
Yeah.
Because I've had,

36
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:55,711
I've had the cloud on my girlfriend's 
phone and she left it in a car and like 

37
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:58,470
in five minutes it was already disabled.
It never turned back on.

38
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,180
Yeah.
Well the thing.

39
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,430
I bet you're right because the thing is 
they have a lot of places that buy cell 

40
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:04,430
phones now.
Yeah.

41
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,240
I don't know if they ask like,
is this yours?

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,490
I don't know.
But uh,

43
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,010
I've seen places that,
by cell phone.

44
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:13,560
Have you ever sold an old cell phone?

45
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,620
No,
because I'm paranoid because I know you 

46
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:18,620
can just take anything off a phone like 
that.

47
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,510
Like I could take her phone even though 
you've deleted it and even reused it for

48
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,570
six months.
I could still take stuff off of there 

49
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:26,570
for like two years ago.

50
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:26,570
Santana,
I keep mine.

51
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,170
But then I was thinking I'm going to do 
something with it.

52
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:30,720
Like I have every version of the IPAD.
I'm like,

53
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:34,200
well I'm just going to use this for my 
home security camera.

54
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,210
Like,
and it never,

55
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,700
this ipad it's only gonna be for pre 
show music and then I leave it at a club

56
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:46,191
and I used to try to do that too.
But I felt like I used to bring an 

57
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:46,191
actual ipod.
I was oil.

58
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,430
I want to have an ipod is by itself.
You don't just want to have my phone,

59
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,590
but now that's ridiculous because 
you're,

60
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,080
the new phones have 128 gigs.
Yeah,

61
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,370
come on.
You're not going to use all that.

62
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,510
If you do,
you're an asshole.

63
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,260
What's going on on your phone?
Yeah.

64
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,010
Movies on there.

65
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,140
Get the whole whole world plan on your 
phone.

66
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,810
John headphone.
So yeah,

67
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,760
so it's been a year and somebody just 
tweeted to,

68
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,800
uh,
they asked him.

69
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,250
Now I'm a little bit afraid because I 
haven't seen you in so long.

70
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,010
And then you invited me to be on a 
podcast.

71
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,520
People were worried on twitter that you 
were going to give me an intervention 

72
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,640
and that tells me I should quit comedy.
I would never do guys.

73
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,150
You're hilarious.
Standup comedian.

74
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,050
This is,
trust me.

75
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:31,051
I took that on my own.
He's joking around about a conversation 

76
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:33,580
that we had with Brendan Shabazz.
It was intense.

77
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,540
It was intense.
I still feel like shit feel like shit 

78
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:39,540
today.
I felt like shit while we're doing it.

79
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,040
There was um,
Brendan last.

80
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,030
He got beat up and stopped by this guy.
Travis Browne is one of the best in the 

81
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,561
world.
And you wanted to talk about it on the 

82
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:52,561
air.

83
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:52,561
You know,
I wanted to talk about what we felt like

84
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:55,080
on the earn and I asked him if he short.
He was like,

85
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,840
yeah,
absolutely.

86
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:56,860
I want,
I want to get it out there,

87
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,861
I want to get it out there.
I want to hear exactly what you really 

88
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:01,861
think.
And I mean,

89
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:05,590
I'm sure what he thought I would think 
and what I did think was different,

90
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,320
you know,
and then as we were talking I kind of 

91
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,801
realized like I feel like his 
perceptions of where he's at and the 

92
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:18,721
dangers of what has happened to him and 
the reality of where he's at and the 

93
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:20,860
dangers of what have happened to them 
were off.

94
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,880
And some people feel like I should have 
done that conversation off the air.

95
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,510
And I feel like I probably agree with 
you.

96
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,540
Um,
you know,

97
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,240
all,
all things said and done.

98
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,570
The only good thing about having it on 
the air is that other fighters can hear 

99
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:39,040
this and they can,
um,

100
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,430
they can form a,
I want to say educated opinion because 

101
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,330
I'm definitely not a doctor or a 
scientist or even smart.

102
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,070
But I know a lot of information about 
chronic brain damage from seeing it,

103
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,640
from talking to people who have it,
from talking to doctors who are experts 

104
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:01,921
on it too.
And to know that I don't see a lot of 

105
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:05,041
people that are at the front of the 
tunnel waving a light in mma saying,

106
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,250
hey,
you know,

107
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:09,160
you guys got to slow the fuck down.
We don't know what's up here.

108
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,690
And I think that that's the case with a 
chronic brain damage.

109
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:18,691
Nfl is just dealing with now these 
players from the seventies and eighties 

110
00:05:18,691 --> 00:05:21,190
and the nineties and even the two 
thousands that are just fucked up.

111
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,190
Now.
Look in the Buckeye player that just 

112
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,740
committed suicide a couple weeks ago 
from looking at him,

113
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,540
you know,
look at.

114
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,560
There's just a long list of players.
I watched some guy get k Oh the other 

115
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:35,080
day.
Oh my goodness.

116
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Somebody sent it to me on twitter.
It was a vine of these two football 

117
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,730
parents colliding helmets.
They just see that one.

118
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,190
Jeremy,
you're j.

119
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,180
you're fucking football freak.
Jamie.

120
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:47,740
Probably.
He'd probably want him.

121
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:49,860
It's fantasy football.
Street stakes.

122
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,710
Yeah.
Was I was reading from A.

123
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,330
Somebody tweeted about it and then I 
went to.

124
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:59,720
I don't even know what the website was.
And then had tweet about like,

125
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:00,980
why you were talking.
And,

126
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:05,981
and so I just read the tweets like 
somebody was paraphrasing what you were 

127
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:07,490
saying and without even really known the
story,

128
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,520
all I got out of it was you wanted him 
to just be careful with,

129
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,820
with getting smacked in the head because
that's not gonna work out.

130
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,820
Well,
it's not that I wanted them to be 

131
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,471
careful.
I'm one of them to consider ending it 

132
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:23,471
because I know he's going to end it.
He wanted,

133
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:27,551
it ended.
He was talking before this fight about 

134
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:27,551
like when he's going to get out after 
the fight.

135
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:30,560
He talked about two years.
So they had a 42 year idea,

136
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,190
you know,
and the reality of getting head trauma 

137
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,610
is cumulative and that guys who get 
knocked out a few times,

138
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:42,920
it becomes easier for them to get 
knocked out again.

139
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,580
And the damage is all compounding.
You're waiting.

140
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,850
It's like buying a bunch of shit on 
credit and you're waiting for the bill 

141
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,021
to come and you've,
you're driving around this nice car and 

142
00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:58,871
you have this cool watch.
But the reality is you owe a fuck load 

143
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:02,321
of money.
You're going to have to work your dick 

144
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:02,321
off to pay that shit.

145
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:02,321
You're not thinking about that right 
now.

146
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,040
Well,
the chronic brain damage things,

147
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,050
a debt that you can never pay,
like you're putting damage on your 

148
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,590
brain.
It doesn't manifest itself immediately.

149
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:11,600
Always.
It takes a while.

150
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,780
A lot of these players were fine when 
they retired and then you've seen them 

151
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,230
like Jim Mcmahon,
the sports illustrated article on,

152
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,090
Oh dude,
it's terrifying.

153
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,250
When I was a kid,
I didn't know shit about football,

154
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:25,310
but I don't know who Jim Mcmahon was.
He was goddamn legendary quarterback,

155
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,230
you know him and the bears and that 
whole,

156
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,440
you know the,
the superbowl shuffle and no one knew 

157
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,020
who those guys were.
He's Foxville now.

158
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:33,920
You know,
he,

159
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,100
he will find himself in the middle of 
his house not knowing how he got there.

160
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,340
He's just looking for his keys.
Are Looking for what,

161
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,370
what?
He doesn't know where he was going to 

162
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:45,370
do.

163
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:45,370
He forgets things all the time.
You know,

164
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,960
I was talking to Brian Stan,
we were text message and back and forth 

165
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,141
today and he was talking about people 
that he knows that got it from being 

166
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:57,710
soldiers from blasts and he's like,
it's horrible.

167
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,360
It's horrible.
Like these guys,

168
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:00,980
they,
they can't remember anything.

169
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,410
They have no energy.
They're depressed all the time.

170
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,020
It's not everybody and it's not.
I mean there's.

171
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,750
The thing about fighting is you never 
know when it's too late.

172
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,990
It's like some guys can get knocked out 
once and go on from that to have great 

173
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,131
careers.
Some guys can get knocked out a couple 

174
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:21,131
of times,
but they're still in their bunny.

175
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:22,670
They're just fighting beasts.
Like perfect example.

176
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,280
That is Michael Bisping gets knocked out
by Dan Henderson,

177
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:27,890
comes back,
very successful,

178
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,150
gets knocked out by Vito Belfort,
comes back after that beats the shit out

179
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:34,010
of Kung lean,
one of the best fights of his career.

180
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,220
You know,
like he's,

181
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,440
he's been Kao to a couple of times,
but it's only because he's fighting the 

182
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,750
elite of the elite at the top of the 
level and you know,

183
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,490
he's just smudge it off.
That's it.

184
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,750
I mean,
Michael Bisping is one of the best in 

185
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:48,750
the fucking world,
but I felt like we shop.

186
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,390
I was,
I was seeing that it was going to happen

187
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,460
more often and um,
I,

188
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,940
I fucking loved that dude.
He is a great guy.

189
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,260
I mean,
Brendan Schaub,

190
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,040
he's a really interesting character 
because he's this big,

191
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,980
hulking dude,
but he's a sweetheart.

192
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,990
He's like the nicest guy.
He jokes around about how he's like a,

193
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,800
a dolphin and a shark outfit on the 
outside,

194
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,500
but he's a dolphin on the inside.
He's hilarious.

195
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:20,100
He's really honest.
He's like really honest about everything

196
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:25,101
except like is fighting ability,
I think is fighting ability or his 

197
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:25,200
position.

198
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,200
He's got a slightly elevated sense,
but that's why he's a bad motherfucker.

199
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:35,211
You have to have this sense that's 
almost distorted in order to be a 

200
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:37,110
fighter in the first place because when 
you first started out,

201
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,230
how could you imagine ever getting to a 
championship level when you first 

202
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,171
started out and you're getting hit every
time you move forward and getting taken 

203
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:45,470
down every time someone wants you to.
It's,

204
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,100
it's weird,
you know,

205
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,220
it takes a long time.
So you have to have like almost this 

206
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,180
like crazed idea of yourself to be a 
fighter in the first place.

207
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:58,860
It's just extreme confidence and you 
know he's got that for sure.

208
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,380
And there's a lot of fighters to have 
that.

209
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,500
It's great when you're winning,
when you're winning that that extreme 

210
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,240
confidence is awesome because that 
extreme confidence like gives you like a

211
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,640
boost over some other people who don't 
have that.

212
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,620
You might have like a psychological 
boost.

213
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:19,130
Maybe it's in training,
maybe it's in how confident you feel 

214
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,260
before the fight so you don't get as 
nervous as he does.

215
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,490
There's all sorts of variables,
but when you start losing,

216
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,120
that's when that can be a motherfucker 
because that thing doesn't want to see 

217
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,451
the truth.
That ego is a tricky motherfucker 

218
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:34,260
because it can help you and a lot of 
ways they can push you to success,

219
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,710
but it can also fuck you up where you're
not seeing yourself the way you should.

220
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,720
You can't like you.
You don't see yourself in a,

221
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,870
in a negative way.
You don't allow it in so you don't look 

222
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,290
at the flaws.
You don't look at like.

223
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,910
Especially true in martial arts,
which is a hyper critical,

224
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,100
you're,
you have to be extremely self critical 

225
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,020
to be a competitive martial artists 
because the stakes are so high.

226
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,470
You're getting kicked in.
The face is one of the worst steaks and 

227
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,550
all of sports.
The possibility to this guide,

228
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,040
I'll say his name because I fucked it up
during the broadcast,

229
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:15,240
we're seeing salmon at some on police is
the correct pronunciation.

230
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,080
He won this weekend with this fucking 
destruction of the head kick.

231
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,810
He switched head kick the student the 
face and boom,

232
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:26,340
the lights go out and the guy went 
stiff.

233
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:30,450
It was one of those classic like worst 
case scenario,

234
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,970
the worst thing that can happen to you 
in the octagon,

235
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,770
and it was just a beautiful technique.
They've just shuffled that front leg and

236
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,790
Boehm Shin to the head,
you know that is the stakes.

237
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,390
So you have to be so fucking critical 
about your technique,

238
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,790
about your conditioning,
about your dedication,

239
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:52,791
your psychological outlook on fighting,
all those things you have.

240
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,340
Keep those in a row.

241
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,560
It's so fucking dangerous.
If you don't,

242
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,450
and when you start,
if you lose and you know,

243
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:03,970
you start looking at yourself in a 
delusional way,

244
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
it can hamper your ability to work on 
all those areas they can hit like 

245
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:13,120
anytime you have a delusional 
perspective and introspective outlook,

246
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:18,121
that's just not accurate.
You're not doing yourself a favor like 

247
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:18,880
you need someone else to give you 
advice.

248
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,850
You know what I'm saying?
Like you not see you're selling,

249
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,970
you're not seeing like things that you 
can correct and when you're in that 

250
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,321
state,
as a martial artist it becomes very 

251
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:33,421
dangerous and it's,
it's common to get to for fighters 

252
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:36,550
because being a fighter's extremely 
nerve wracking,

253
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,120
you know,
I am barely qualified to speak of it 

254
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,210
because I only did taekwondo tournaments
and some kickboxing,

255
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,770
but I just remember competing and being 
scared out of my fucking mind.

256
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,890
I was a kid,
you know,

257
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,990
it was 19 or 21 actually when I retired 
in between 18 and 21.

258
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:59,590
We're all the really dangerous fights 
like national level fights.

259
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,580
But you,
you,

260
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:07,610
you experienced these extreme fears and 
extreme highs and extreme lows.

261
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:13,111
Like when you win,
it's the greatest feeling in the world 

262
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:15,181
for these guys.
Like you see guys that win like Johnny 

263
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:15,730
Hendrix,
when he won the title drops down.

264
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,760
He's just fucking.
You see this rush of joy that goes 

265
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,460
through him that you and I are never 
going to experience.

266
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,370
I've never experienced that in a 
taekwondo tournament because it was.

267
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:27,400
It didn't mean as much.
That's what these guys are doing is like

268
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,730
this insane top of the mountain high.
And so when you get to that top of the 

269
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:36,760
mountain high,
the guys who have had those big wins,

270
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,170
like Brendan's had some big wins.

271
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,680
He knocked out Mirko Cro cop who's like 
a legendary cancer.

272
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,550
Mirko was legendary.
I mean he's a.

273
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,590
He was like one of the best kick boxers 
ever to enter into the glory days of 

274
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:49,640
pride.
You know,

275
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,190
when Mirko Mirko has like a head kick 
Kao highlight reel,

276
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,170
that's like one of the greatest of all 
times.

277
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,270
But if anything,
the Mirko Cro,

278
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:03,271
cop fight should prove my point to 
Brendan because if Mirko Cro cop and he 

279
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,710
fought back when Mirko Cro,
cop one,

280
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:10,711
the pride heavyweight Grand Prix,
that would have been a completely 

281
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:11,950
fucking different fight.
That was a different guy back then.

282
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,770
It was just a different guy and 
everybody knows it.

283
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:20,250
He fought Gonzaga in the UFC.
He fought a 80 Sanchez first beat him 

284
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,270
and they fought Gonzaga and he got cro 
copped essentially.

285
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:28,930
He got head kicked by Gonzaga,
who's a very strong guy.

286
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,090
Gonzaga's like,
oh,

287
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:35,250
he walks onto the stage like when they 
have to weigh in on Zaga sounds 

288
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,250
different than everybody else.

289
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,220
Sounds like it's made out of stone.
Just a big,

290
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:41,950
powerful fucking dude.
Gonzaga is a beast.

291
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,700
Gonzaga correct.
One off the side of his head.

292
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,880
And from then on,
man,

293
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,490
he just wasn't the same guy.
I think those two fights,

294
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,190
like in the UFC,
he was never the same.

295
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,620
His first two fights.
He had some good fights in UFC.

296
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,270
He was never the same as.
He wasn't pride.

297
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:04,390
You think a lot of fighters like stick 
it out longer than they should because 

298
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,300
there's no fallback.
There's like,

299
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:06,260
okay,
I'm a fighter.

300
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:06,920
I,
I don't.

301
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,160
I mean those guys have skills,
but like I don't have any like me as a 

302
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,551
comic.
If I ever decided I'm not going to be a 

303
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:15,551
comic,
I have zero other skills.

304
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:17,630
There's almost nothing that,
that I know how to do.

305
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,040
Yeah.
I even said when I was trying to like 

306
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,040
make an analogy,
I made a bad one.

307
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,220
I even said if I was a comedian,
you know,

308
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:27,950
and I was fucking terrible.
I would want everybody to tell me that I

309
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:32,951
should stop if there's something that 
happened to me and I wasn't funny 

310
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:32,951
anymore,
but I'll still going onstage.

311
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:33,710
I would want someone to come and tell 
me.

312
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,780
That's a terrible analogy.
Okay.

313
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:39,290
I was just looking for something and 
after I said I was like,

314
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,310
that's not good.
Obviously being a comedian,

315
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,440
it doesn't cause brain damage if you 
just suck at something,

316
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,240
you know the difference between sucking 
at fighting and I shouldn't even use the

317
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,060
term sucking.
Being unsuccessful at fighting and being

318
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:55,760
unsuccessful at like writing a book.
If you write a book and it sucks,

319
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:57,050
everybody goes through,
your book sucks,

320
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,050
but it doesn't,
it doesn't give you a concussion,

321
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,470
you know,
and it doesn't give you concussions and 

322
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:05,870
training that you kind of try to ignore,
you know,

323
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,630
dudes land on your fucking head and 
training,

324
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,970
you know,
even in grappling guys collide,

325
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,590
collide heads all the time and these are
all,

326
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,500
you know,
these are all points against your brain.

327
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,360
Every one of them points against your 
brain.

328
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,920
Every one of them points against your 
brain.

329
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,980
Obviously comedy doesn't have that.
If you think I suck,

330
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:26,600
that's,
I feel bad,

331
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,530
but it doesn't hurt me.
You know,

332
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,350
he had been losing fights lately.
Well,

333
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,410
he had a real bad fight with her lawsky.
It was like it was real clumsy and just 

334
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:43,900
look like both of them were just way out
of sync and are all.

335
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,030
Obviously it was super nervous because 
it was his first fight back in the UFC.

336
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,190
And then our last,
he subsequent performance,

337
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:51,050
he fought big foot Silva and looked 
fucking great.

338
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,420
Knocked him out in the first round and 
looked smooth,

339
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:58,421
so like he got over his jitters for his 
second fight back because he had been 

340
00:16:58,421 --> 00:17:01,871
out for eight years.
Our last was the UFC heavyweight champ 

341
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:04,751
at one point.
It's just Brendan looked super obvious 

342
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:05,150
like he was like telegraphing is shot.

343
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,980
I was worried about them and I'm also 
worried about him because he.

344
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:13,580
Before that he got knocked out by Ben 
Rothwell and then he beat,

345
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,010
what's his name?
Lefarge Johnson,

346
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:19,100
who's a beast of our Johnson's fucking 
scary.

347
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:24,340
He's a vicious puncher.
Beat Lavar by taking them down and just 

348
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,611
holding them down.
That's basically how he won that fight 

349
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:27,611
and even kind of said like,
Hey,

350
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:31,511
I'm not standing with that fucking guy.
Which is very intelligent of was a good 

351
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:35,051
win for them.
Fought Matt Mitrione and condom and it 

352
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:35,270
darce choke and put them to sleep,
which is a big one.

353
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,780
That was huge.
What I worry about is not those fights.

354
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,200
What I worry about is a fights where we 
get hit with Ben Rothwell hit him.

355
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,020
Ben Rothwell hit him with one left so I 
can just shut the lights out.

356
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,260
His body dropped and Roth was on top of 
him dropping bombs know,

357
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,910
and then he talked about it on the 
podcast.

358
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,910
He was saying that he actually got hurt 
before that in training sparring with 

359
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,141
Shane Carwyn.
Shane Carwood apparently heard I'm 

360
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:02,190
really bad with a punch.
So you have to factor in.

361
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:06,300
How many times did he sparely Shane car 
when my mind starts going,

362
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,320
hmm,
you're probably spawn with Shane Carwyn 

363
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,320
once a week.
At least.

364
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,220
Shane car one is a mother fucker.
You want to talk about a dude who's 

365
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,780
built for war.
I've met a lot of like freak athletes in

366
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,180
the UFC.
Like John Jones,

367
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,900
a freak athlete.
Daniel cormier has world class wrestler.

368
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,570
I met a lot of freaks,
but

369
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,140
you know,

370
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,020
if you,
if you think about like elite level 

371
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,870
fighters and elite elite level athletes,
you know,

372
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,900
there's,
there's so many of them that are so 

373
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,640
fucking good that it becomes,
you know,

374
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:49,641
it becomes a matter of whether or not 
you want to be the kind of guy who loses

375
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:56,301
five or six fights in a row or whether 
or not you want to take those five or 

376
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:56,301
six fights back now.

377
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,870
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

378
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:00,900
I want to.

379
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,820
I just think it.
I think it's,

380
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,840
it's scary that you're concerned with a 
friend because you work in the business 

381
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:13,570
and it's interesting to see where this 
new information comes in,

382
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,300
how danger it is,
how you can sit there and even be 

383
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:19,300
friends with anybody but

384
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,020
without.
It can be friends with a man because you

385
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:23,980
can take a certain amount of punches.
Just gotTa know when to get out.

386
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,260
Your friends got to know to let you out.
What I was saying about freaks,

387
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:28,990
man,
Shane Carwyn,

388
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,870
St Darwin has fists that I'm not 
shitting you.

389
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,510
They look like.
See that Marshall amp over there?

390
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,870
That's like Shane Carlin's fist.
They're the most ridiculous thing I've 

391
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,120
ever seen in my life.
He had like four or five xl gloves,

392
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,530
like it was always a big thing that 
brock lesnar had these giant fists until

393
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:50,980
he fought Carwyn.
Like Carlin actually had bigger fist and

394
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,590
lesnar.
I mean,

395
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,990
you're talking about things that don't 
even make sense.

396
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,680
It's like his.
His body structure is so odd.

397
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,800
He came into Jujitsu once.
I was training at a mall Easton's place 

398
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:02,800
in Boulder,
Colorado.

399
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,400
It's the best Jujitsu in Colorado in a 
mall has this beautiful gym where 

400
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:11,360
everybody's rolling,
we're in class and this guy walks in and

401
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:13,280
I go,
that's not even a fucking person.

402
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,570
Like,
what is that?

403
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:16,760
Right?
This guys got like a gene,

404
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,730
like a,
like a pair of jeans on and a like a tee

405
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:20,270
shirt.
You probably,

406
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:23,840
it's probably like a double xl,
but he's built like a fucking superhero.

407
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:25,830
Yeah.
So then I realized it's Corwin.

408
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,020
He don't realize how fucking big car 
when is until you see him out with 

409
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,871
regular people in a normal sort,
almost like everybody else has just 

410
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:39,221
walking around their normal clothes and 
then this guy walks in and it doesn't 

411
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:39,221
even look like he's a fucking human.
Yeah,

412
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:44,140
I mean just go villa.
And that guy was sparring with Brendan 

413
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,130
on a regular basis.
He hits

414
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:53,290
he,
he knocked Gabriel Gonzaga dead with a 

415
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:53,290
punch from like seven,
eight inches away.

416
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,570
Just just,
just crank,

417
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,190
boom.
I mean,

418
00:20:57,191 --> 00:21:02,191
he was a destroyer and so shane was 
getting in sparring sessions on a 

419
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:06,190
regular basis with Brendan.
So he's getting hit all the time.

420
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:08,590
There's Shankar wins.
Fists are on the right.

421
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:11,560
And Brock Lesnar's are on the left.
Yeah.

422
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,930
What is that?
He's a God damn gorilla.

423
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,910
He's a goddamn shaved down white 
gorilla.

424
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:21,480
He could hold that iphone plus that 
would have been a,

425
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,660
he would have been a champion.
You know,

426
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,730
he had a few issues.
One of them like back issues from um,

427
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,080
all of his years of playing football.
He had some serious like,

428
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,930
like stingers and discs issues and stuff
like that.

429
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:36,850
Those guys are just colliding into each 
other,

430
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,670
big giant dudes that size colliding into
each other,

431
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,970
but if he wasn't,
if he just went straight to mma,

432
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,360
wrestling and mma,
I think that dude would have been a 

433
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:48,360
world champion.

434
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,840
He was athletic freak because she was so
fucking strong,

435
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,490
you know,
it's just like he was one of those dudes

436
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:57,040
like you couldn't let him hit you if he 
hit you.

437
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,100
He fought Frank Mir and it was one of 
the most brutal beat downs I've ever 

438
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:04,750
seen in all my years because the way he 
did it,

439
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,080
he muscled Frank Mir up against the 
cage,

440
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,710
got him in like a collar tie or maybe a,
maybe a tight overtook.

441
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:16,711
I don't remember which one it was.
And then he starts blasting them with 

442
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:17,500
left upper cut.
It's just boom,

443
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,590
boom,
and you could see me or stock can't get 

444
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,980
out and can't take these shots.
And he's just.

445
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:29,130
He just sprinted at him,
just sprint out on him with bombs and 

446
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,971
the mirror went down and they finished 
them off on the ground and that was a 

447
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:32,971
brutal,
brutal knockout.

448
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,340
So Brendan was sparring with that guy on
a regular basis.

449
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:38,140
So it's not as fight.
I only got hit,

450
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,230
I got hit maybe twice in my life where 
like I thought I was done with like 

451
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,430
stars in that weird buzzing sound that 
happens.

452
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,590
One was a,
I've told this story before,

453
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:55,480
Danny bonaduce and then the other was a 
Stephan Bonner.

454
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,540
This was years and years ago.
We were sparring for some reason or he 

455
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,040
was sparring with Stephan Bonner.
He was at.

456
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,280
I don't remember the thing.
We were at Krav Maga.

457
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,320
He was there,
I think it was training for a movie or 

458
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,750
something and some of the guys,
the stunt guys were so anyway,

459
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:15,751
so we,
we started sparring and then he gets 

460
00:23:15,751 --> 00:23:18,271
into the sparring.
So I'm thinking oh he's probably just 

461
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,180
wants to know how to fight.
So I've been kind of bounced around.

462
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,120
Next thing I know I just heard ringing 
and whatever.

463
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:27,121
He kicked me in the thigh that not like 
to try to like we were sparring so he 

464
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:29,450
wasn't trying to full blast,
you know,

465
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,500
whatever is 30 percent is is my 150 
percent with the 40 year olds I box,

466
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,810
you know what I mean?
So it was nothing to do with him,

467
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,990
but that was the first time in 
everything was ringing and I'm like Oh 

468
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,690
God,
that was once.

469
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,040
It's too many look and imagine

470
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,450
that over 12 years and just not just 
those like football injuries to.

471
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,370
Brendan also played football I believe 
college and high school and you know,

472
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,660
he was a,
he was a fucking,

473
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,860
he still is a really good athlete and 
that's why he's become a good fighter.

474
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,040
But the difference between a good 
fighter,

475
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:09,250
I mean he's a very good fighter,
but the difference between that and the 

476
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,250
top of the heap guys,
there's a leak,

477
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,870
there's a leap,
but there's a bridge that you have to 

478
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:13,870
cross.
Could you cross that bridge physically?

479
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,311
You never.
I mean he's only 30 years old if he 

480
00:24:18,311 --> 00:24:19,520
became like super dedicated and went to 
a very strict Moitai camp.

481
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,620
And learned like really wicked,
wicked,

482
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:24,680
stand up and didn't fight for it.
But how do you feed yourself when you're

483
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:26,480
doing that?
You know when you're a pro athlete.

484
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,590
That would be really.

485
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:32,650
If he did that though,
if he just stopped only training and 

486
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,020
competing for fights and I know he works
on a skills as well,

487
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,350
but if you just completely dedicated 
himself to the scariest part,

488
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,790
which is the kickboxing,
that's the scariest shit.

489
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,510
That's the shit that everybody should.
If you're,

490
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,490
if you're,
if you're coming into it with nothing,

491
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,580
that's a shit you should almost 
concentrate on the most because it's the

492
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:49,100
most dangerous.
If you don't have it good defensively.

493
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,960
Like if you get submitted,
it's bad.

494
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:52,610
You know you can break your arm for 
sure.

495
00:24:52,611 --> 00:24:54,920
You can get choked out,
but they can fix your fucking arm.

496
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,280
You get too many knees to the head from 
a guy like alister over him.

497
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,710
You know you don't.
You don't want that.

498
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,880
You know the fighting is all about 
mitigating damage.

499
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,040
It's all about inflicting as much as you
can,

500
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,570
but mitigating as much as you can.

501
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:13,570
And one of the best ways to mitigate 
damage is technical proficiency and 

502
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,240
that's something that people don't think
about.

503
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,070
They want to think about strength and 
conditioning.

504
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,720
They want to think about running up 
hills.

505
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,170
The most important thing is technical 
proficiency.

506
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:25,550
It's the most important thing by far.
And there's some guys that unfortunately

507
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:29,630
for them,
they come into striking late in life,

508
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:35,130
like some guys come into striking and 
they have a background long background 

509
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:39,460
of wrestling and so they're.
They're not used to jumping forward and 

510
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,010
throwing combinations and footwork and 
drills and it's alien to them.

511
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,020
For whatever reason,
their body doesn't adapt to it.

512
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,090
You see a lot with white wrestlers.
Sorry,

513
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:48,560
white guys.
But it's true.

514
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:51,350
There's a lot of white wrestlers that 
for whatever reason,

515
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:56,250
there's just slow with their punches.
There's some guys that excel like it.

516
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,550
Jake ellenberger,
obviously Johnny Hendricks,

517
00:25:58,551 --> 00:26:01,100
obviously those guys started out as 
amateur wrestlers,

518
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,550
but learned along the way to blast power
punches.

519
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,560
But some guys never do.
You know,

520
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:11,561
there's guys like Ben Astron who I think
is one of the best hundred 70 pounders 

521
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:12,110
in the world.
He's a wicked wrestler.

522
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,840
But his stand up is just really to close
the gap.

523
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,660
It's just to close the gap and then he 
gets in on you and you're fucked.

524
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,100
He's just too good.
He just.

525
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,170
His wrestling is so much better than 
everybody else's.

526
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:23,330
He just,
when he gets in on you,

527
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,420
it's Foxville,
right?

528
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,750
So his thing is all just about getting 
it on you,

529
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,060
but,
but the,

530
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:32,490
but starting out with a deficit in 
strikings,

531
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:37,510
the most dangerous because if you're one
of those guys that doesn't have that 

532
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,571
fast twitch body,
like a tyron woodley body or Hector 

533
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:40,571
Lombard body,
but you started off as a Grandpa,

534
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:45,520
but you can pick up the strike and 
really quickly if you don't have that 

535
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:45,520
kind

536
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,780
of body and you don't have that kind of 
coaching and you know,

537
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:51,850
have that kind of training and the gym 
with her going over technique with you 

538
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:56,931
with a fine tooth comb.
It's a fucking dangerous aspect of 

539
00:26:56,931 --> 00:27:00,111
fighting.
It's the most dangerous aspect is the 

540
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:00,111
one thing that you don't want to suck 
out.

541
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:01,800
The one thing that you don't want to 
fail at is striking.

542
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,460
And if you fail at wrestling and you 
didn't just get taken down,

543
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,660
you know,
it's not good,

544
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:11,661
but it's a little bit better than 
getting fucking wheel kicked in the 

545
00:27:11,661 --> 00:27:13,110
head.
I was good at striking.

546
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:18,150
My problem was,
is I stopped striking about five inches 

547
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,050
away from your face,
so that's not good.

548
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,380
So I could never figure out how to get.
That was my thing.

549
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:30,381
I,
I'd always throw everything and you can 

550
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:30,630
literally just stick your face out and I
wouldn't hit you because I would never.

551
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:33,680
I was afraid to always take that,
you know.

552
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,790
Then I'm like,
what am I doing?

553
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,120
I'm doing this.
Well,

554
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:41,940
we talked about it before when you were 
sparring in class.

555
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:42,970
I was like,
how far?

556
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:48,050
Like you gotta be careful.
You told me that somebody had grabbed 

557
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:48,050
your foot,
you threw a kick that grab your foot,

558
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,050
held onto it and knocked you out.
Yep.

559
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,100
And I was like,
come on man,

560
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:53,030
you can't be doing that kind of spark.
I used to bring my box,

561
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:55,880
he stuff on the road and then I go to a 
bar,

562
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,000
you know,
a boxing.

563
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,790
I get a trainer for the day,
this is back when I was.

564
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,810
I would wake up,
but I.

565
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:05,130
I would go and do that and then sure 
enough they'd always say,

566
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:06,780
do you feel like sparring?
Keep in mind,

567
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:08,760
this was 10 years ago when I'm like,
yeah,

568
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:13,761
let's.
And then with defined out your comedian 

569
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:13,761
or whatever.
Then they just want to kill you.

570
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:16,110
It's a better story for them to knock 
you off.

571
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,550
Then too lightly spar just so people get
their sweat on you.

572
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,340
Right?
Yeah.

573
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:22,040
That's hilarious.
So,

574
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:27,130
so I stopped doing that.
Some people are rude with them and they 

575
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:27,130
don't think it's a big deal to Knoxville
me the fuck out.

576
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,270
So rude.
It's like,

577
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,460
you know,
it's fucking.

578
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:37,490
You could really damaged someone's head 
and I know that's the point of fighting 

579
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,100
and in a way it makes me a hypocrite.
I'm fully aware of that because I do 

580
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,070
enjoy fighting.
I love watching it.

581
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,800
I'm not going to not watch it.
I just.

582
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,800
I'm a big fan of brandon as a human 
being and Brendan Schaub is a guy with 

583
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:55,860
options.
He could do other things.

584
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,120
Brendan can.
He'd go on and people from your pod,

585
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:05,150
like I only know him from the podcast.
I didn't really even know him as a 

586
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:05,150
fighter,
you know,

587
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,680
they got money when he's a guest here.
He was always super entertaining to me.

588
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,080
He is always funny,
dude.

589
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:10,620
Yeah,
yeah.

590
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,710
He's a funny dude and he's a.
he's a really good dude and I think a 

591
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,831
lot of people don't understand him 
because of some of the hype surrounding 

592
00:29:18,831 --> 00:29:19,650
some of his fights.
He would talk a lot of trash,

593
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:24,651
like he talked about trust in this fight
and people get mad at him for that and 

594
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:24,651
they think he's that guy,
you know,

595
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:29,601
they'd get mad at them for maybe over 
assessing his possibilities being a 

596
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,220
champion,
but he's a fucking great dude.

597
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,990
He really is.
He could do anything.

598
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:39,330
He,
the dedication that led him to go from 

599
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,841
football to mma,
he could go from MMA to having like a 

600
00:29:41,841 --> 00:29:44,380
super podcast and career,
which is a real option now.

601
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,200
I mean,
even better and better.

602
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,750
Where's the fucking John Hef Rancho.
You know what?

603
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:53,050
I had one for like a second.
You and repad a show for me and her ipad

604
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:58,051
to show and then stopped doing it and 
then I stopped for a long time and then 

605
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:02,050
I started one called the state.
I'm in a and I was like,

606
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:07,051
I'm going to talk about what,
where I'm at physically and mentally 

607
00:30:07,051 --> 00:30:07,051
that'll be that way.
I've seen,

608
00:30:07,051 --> 00:30:07,440
you know,
so I don't have to figure out.

609
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,040
That's a good idea.
And then.

610
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,490
So I had like Martha Quinn on and I,
you know,

611
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,500
I had.
Did you interview her after she got out 

612
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:16,500
of jail?

613
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:16,800
Martha Quinn,
the MTV Vj.

614
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,630
Thinking of Martha Stewart.
Martha.

615
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,120
So it started off really,
really good.

616
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:27,300
And then I think it's been,
I think I'm up until a month and a half 

617
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,120
and I haven't recorded one.
So mark don't know how to do it by 

618
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,941
myself.
Like how bill does this podcast with 

619
00:30:32,941 --> 00:30:34,410
just him?
That's his art that I don't know.

620
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,860
His new special.
So good.

621
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,050
It's really funny man.
It's so him.

622
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,600
It's like the,
in my opinion,

623
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,980
the best one as far as capturing him 
doing like a regular set.

624
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,430
He so loose up there.
That's where like I,

625
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,910
I know I have three specials and I'm 
going to get ready to shoot my fourth.

626
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,070
I haven't done a special yet that I 
would go,

627
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:55,510
yeah,
that's how I am.

628
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:58,900
If you come and see me alive.
Who's the closest for me?

629
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,550
This last one's the closest.
And you did it in Denver at the downtown

630
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,620
or the comedy works downtown?

631
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,280
Yeah,
the little one.

632
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,690
There was 250 seats and stuff.
I've recorded two cds there.

633
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,610
It's the best.
It's the best.

634
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:17,611
It's one of the.
I mean there's no the best club in the 

635
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:17,611
country because there's a few clubs like
that,

636
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:19,450
like there's helium and Portland.
You know,

637
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:21,150
there's a,
there's the element,

638
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,470
helium and Philly,
that's another one.

639
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,810
The comedy works.
Original Room.

640
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,760
It's like one of the all time great 
rooms.

641
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,520
There's a bunch of those.
There's a bunch of foam.

642
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,560
That fucking place in Utah is really 
good.

643
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:33,510
Man.
Wiseguys.

644
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,260
Oh yeah.
Oh my goodness.

645
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,580
Utah Salt Lake City is filled with 
really fucking cool people.

646
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,670
That was weird.
Like I figured we're going to go to Salt

647
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:47,670
Lake City.
Everyone's gonna have their fucking 

648
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:47,670
pants pulled up to the rib cage is going
to be very weird.

649
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:52,130
They're all gonna,
have the straight and we met a few of 

650
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:52,130
them.

651
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:52,420
Like when I got there I met some lady in
the elevator and it was talking about it

652
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:57,421
on stage because you could tell just by 
how friendly she was and she was a 

653
00:31:57,421 --> 00:31:58,420
mormon,
like shoes.

654
00:31:58,421 --> 00:32:01,310
Either that or she was looking for Dick 
and she wasn't looking for deck,

655
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:06,690
so she was a mormon.
She was like a mom and we got in the 

656
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,390
elevator with her and she was just like,
hello,

657
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:08,980
where are you from?
How's everybody?

658
00:32:08,981 --> 00:32:10,210
How's,
how are you today?

659
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:15,410
Right.
There's this weird like as far as 

660
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,701
Cultco,
Mormons are some of the coolest 

661
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:17,701
motherfuckers.
They're like,

662
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:19,210
Jen,
they don't fuck with people.

663
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,420
They're gen generally.
Pretty friendly though.

664
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:24,970
It's like a really good call.
Yeah.

665
00:32:24,971 --> 00:32:27,640
I've met her many,
many moons ago.

666
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,450
Met a stripper who was Mormon,
was the whole thing.

667
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,870
Oh my goodness.
Like that's a mess.

668
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,490
And then she got kicked out of being 
Mormon.

669
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,450
Know that club that I worked at this 
year that I've ever been to Lexington,

670
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,720
Lexington,
off-broadway,

671
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,660
Lexington,
Kentucky.

672
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,960
I used to do the Improv there,
right.

673
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:51,170
So this place I believe it's like,
it's off Broadway.

674
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,200
It's in like a strip mall,
but the club's been there forever and 

675
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,570
it's one of those ones when you go and 
you see the head shots,

676
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,880
but they're from dudes from the 
eighties,

677
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,450
you know,
you see all that.

678
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,960
And then so in the place list lung 
shitty.

679
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:07,810
So in my brain I'm like,
oh,

680
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:12,910
okay.
It's give me one of those weeks every 

681
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:12,910
show.
It took me till show to,

682
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,620
to figure out why the audiences were so 
bad ass.

683
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,520
They don't serve food or nothing.
So it was when.

684
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,830
So you're taking out the element of 
people eating steak and mashed potatoes.

685
00:33:22,831 --> 00:33:25,400
It's terrible.
It was terrible for comedy,

686
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,960
which is still really fun.

687
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,070
I never would have thought like great 
shows.

688
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:31,660
Nobody healthily or nothing.
I know it's,

689
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:36,670
it's nice for people because they can 
get like a dinner and a show in at the 

690
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:38,240
same time.
It's good for them,

691
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,060
but like for the show itself,
the overall performance,

692
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:46,061
like sometimes you're,
you're looking down at the crowd and 

693
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:48,701
they were literally looking sideways,
like everybody's looking sideways and 

694
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:49,820
they're eating meals and you're doing 
standups like you're doing stand up in a

695
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:52,160
restaurant and this.
That's fucking weird,

696
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:52,980
man.
You are dinner,

697
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,660
whatever.
This past week I'm doing my stuff and 

698
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:58,660
I'm like,
why did I lose half the room?

699
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,280
And then you see two waitstaff with 
pieces of cake,

700
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,060
but they had like 20 pieces.
So they're passing out cake to everybody

701
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,210
at a birthday party or something.
Yeah,

702
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,020
like the guy.
But if you're going to eat cake,

703
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:10,070
you're not gonna pay attention.

704
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:15,070
Anytime cake runs around is usually when
the focus goes onto the cake no matter 

705
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,540
no matter what.
So it was Kinda.

706
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:21,310
That's the one benefit of doing a 
theater because you're doing a theater.

707
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:26,380
They have a bar in the very back.
You had to go through the doors to get 

708
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:26,380
to the bar and no,
there's no way.

709
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,140
Checks,
no checks,

710
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,180
no waitress.
Get your booze for the show.

711
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,310
Show generally starts about 15 minutes 
late.

712
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,800
Give everybody a chance to get back 
their seat,

713
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,910
their drinks,
and then just sit down.

714
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,050
Yeah.
You know there's.

715
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,210
There's something about comedy clubs 
though that's better.

716
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:43,410
The setup is better.
The low ceiling and the irony is the 

717
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:47,051
only way to make that setup work is 
you've got to make money and liquor and 

718
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,220
the only way to make money with liquor 
is you got to have waitresses to do it.

719
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,070
Theater,
you kind of.

720
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:55,540
It's like they're just very different.
It probably depends on what side you're 

721
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,070
on.
Like I do four to five clubs a year.

722
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,920
Let's say.
I would love to just do some theaters.

723
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,040
I would love to blow into a town.
Be there one night,

724
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,460
shoot the Wad,
take off the next day just because you 

725
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,760
just read today,
age or whatever.

726
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:14,360
When you go home,
I going to kill five days in Dayton,

727
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:16,400
Ohio.
Then the following week,

728
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:21,401
Toledo,
are you shitting on Dayton and Toledo 

729
00:35:21,401 --> 00:35:23,540
last order that I would like.
What?

730
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,100
Do you know what?
I know what you mean.

731
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,590
Well,
that's one of the reasons why you should

732
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:32,591
always like if you can take a friend on 
the road with you to open for you a 

733
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:35,160
giant and it changes the whole game to 
take a friend with her.

734
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:40,170
You're having a good time.
You know you and him are just the shit 

735
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:40,170
and laughing.

736
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:40,350
You can go to the movies.
You can do all kinds of shit.

737
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,390
Get to enter together.
Side note,

738
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,290
I mentioned kippah data because I'm 
obsessed with him.

739
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,480
Why?
He's obsessed with.

740
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,420
Okay,
I have to wait.

741
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:51,260
I have to watch what I say because 
here's what I'm obsessed with.

742
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,550
But he like,
he's been.

743
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,240
He goes after Internet trolls,
I guess from what I'm,

744
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,030
what I'm figuring out from other youtube
videos he puts out,

745
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,660
but he says people's names and phone 
numbers and he just goes and he does 

746
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:10,701
this whole thing going.
You can come to my website and post 

747
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,850
something bad about me.
Joe Rogan.

748
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,370
Well I will tell you,
don't use my name.

749
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:17,830
You call them candies,
but.

750
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:22,850
But he has like,
he has one video where he's talking 

751
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,460
about somebody pulls out a gun and he 
takes out all the bullets and then he 

752
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,950
kind of looks through the barrel wise 
talk.

753
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,220
He's like,
yeah,

754
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:34,221
maybe scary.
So that's why I'm obsessed with talking 

755
00:36:34,221 --> 00:36:35,940
about that off the airflow hanging from 
a thread.

756
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,090
Comedians,
we tend to be fucked up.

757
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:44,710
You think it happens when we get older?
Like we're talking about like your 

758
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:44,710
instance,
right?

759
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:48,560
Like there's a lot of guys that just the
older they get or is it just trauma 

760
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
somehow we get head trauma.

761
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,700
Well,
I think as the older people get,

762
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,830
you know,
they're more likely to go crazy anyway.

763
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:56,940
Yeah,
right.

764
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,960
So grandma and Grandpa weren't,
they weren't the same as when they were 

765
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,790
ready to call it a,
a life,

766
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,360
you know,
my grandfather before he died,

767
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,350
it was,
it was sad.

768
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:09,570
It was just like he was barely there.
You know,

769
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,440
they uh,
pupil people get real weird when they 

770
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:15,440
get old.
Yeah.

771
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:15,440
My,
yeah,

772
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,210
my grandma's 91 92.
And you have to ask her the same 

773
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,511
questions.
And then she started asking what my mom 

774
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:24,270
was doing.
My mom passed away so I didn't like.

775
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:29,271
Then I had to that conversation with her
and then she got legitimately sad is if 

776
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:31,620
she just found out this information.
I'm like,

777
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,360
this,
just this,

778
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,620
this,
uh,

779
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,980
when they get Alzheimer's that's really 
spooky.

780
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,530
Whether they really don't know where 
they are,

781
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:45,590
they'll wake up like in the middle of 
doing things and not be sure where they 

782
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,490
are and they don't know people that 
they've known for years.

783
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,870
Getting old sucks the fat one dude,
you know,

784
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,830
luckily we'll be young forever to tie it
into.

785
00:37:55,831 --> 00:38:00,831
What I was saying about Brendan is that 
all that shit is coming worse if you're 

786
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:06,861
dealing with head trauma,
all the other shit that everybody else 

787
00:38:06,861 --> 00:38:06,861
has to do with it was coming,
you know,

788
00:38:06,861 --> 00:38:09,120
threefold.
Hopefully not.

789
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,940
Hopefully it gets out now.
It'd be all right.

790
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,520
There's a video of Terry Norris,
somebody,

791
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:15,930
uh,
we were talking about on the podcast.

792
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:20,450
Somebody put it up on the message board,
I think it was or twitter,

793
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,460
one of those.
And I watched again Terry Norris when I 

794
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,870
was a kid.
When I was like in my early twenties,

795
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:30,180
Terry Martin Harris was the welterweight
champion I believe,

796
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:32,100
or 1:54,
I forget which way,

797
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,920
but God,
Tammy was good woo.

798
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,010
He had this

799
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,220
fucking lethal left hook man and.
But he would get tagged a lot and 

800
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:42,130
fights.
He would,

801
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,830
he would fight guys and get hit.
You get nailed.

802
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,400
It happened a few times with him.
He was a just a blood and guts super 

803
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:55,140
warrior boxer born with that,
right?

804
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,850
Like I don't know about that.
I was talking to them.

805
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,920
My point is that now he could barely 
talk.

806
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:05,010
He can barely formed sentences.
It's really hard to watch and you know,

807
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,570
he was,
he wasn't that old when you retired,

808
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,980
you know,
it wasn't like he was Bernard Hopkins 

809
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,701
fight and deep into his forties and then
Bernard Hopkins because of his skills 

810
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:16,060
doesn't really get hit that much.
So he's fine.

811
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,100
He's 49 years old and he's fine.

812
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,400
Huh?

813
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:24,710
I don't like reading books lately,
have just,

814
00:39:24,711 --> 00:39:28,550
I'm trying to get like that.
I've read this book called on combat and

815
00:39:28,551 --> 00:39:33,551
it's just basically talks about when 
you're in a combat situation would like 

816
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:37,751
guns and stuff,
like a lot of people get tunnel vision 

817
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:40,331
and then you get all and like how to 
work through that so you can not get 

818
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:41,420
paralyzed with fear,
you know?

819
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,640
Um,
and I just do not have that thing like,

820
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:49,850
you know what I mean when it comes from 
a lot of it comes from overcoming 

821
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:49,850
difficult things,
you know,

822
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:54,760
it's like the idea that you just get it 
and then you have it like a lot of guys 

823
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,460
that have it,
like,

824
00:39:55,461 --> 00:40:00,461
especially like martial arts fighters 
who talked to them like they've gone 

825
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:04,031
through a decade of college wrestling 
and high school wrestling and tried out 

826
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:09,821
for the Olympic team and wrestling and 
they're used to like high pressure type 

827
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:11,720
situations and they're used to being 
super uncomfortable.

828
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,780
That's one of the big keys to success in
athletics is you got to be willing to be

829
00:40:16,821 --> 00:40:18,500
super uncomfortable.
You know,

830
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:21,020
like you've got to get up and do 
training that you don't want to do.

831
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,050
You've got to work out when you're sore.
And especially in MMA,

832
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,780
you know you're going to get hit while 
you're tired of getting hit.

833
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,390
It's like there's a lot of factors going
on.

834
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:33,020
So these guys that can rise to the 
occasion,

835
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,950
they've risen to the occasion a lot 
their whole life.

836
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:37,910
You know what I mean?
It's,

837
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:42,911
it's a normal state for them.
So for a guy like you who hasn't had 

838
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:42,911
any,
you know,

839
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:47,710
amateur mma fights are doing Jujitsu 
class against black belts on a regular 

840
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:52,001
basis,
you're not experiencing like very 

841
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:52,001
difficult situation.
So they,

842
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:53,320
they tense you up,
you know,

843
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:57,020
they become alien.
Like Jujitsu is a perfect example.

844
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:02,170
Like I've seen people go from being a 
type of people that were like super 

845
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:07,421
timid and like had self confidence 
issues and then they started doing 

846
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:11,171
Jujitsu and they'd got to purple belt 
and Brown belt level and now black belt 

847
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:11,580
level.
And when you meet these guys,

848
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:13,340
like I have a bunch of friends that are 
like,

849
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,710
they're,
they're not big guys at all.

850
00:41:15,711 --> 00:41:20,711
Like they're,
they're very slight and very like you 

851
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:21,050
would never think that this guy's a 
fucking killer,

852
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:26,530
but their technique is so good and 
they've become that guy over the course 

853
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,650
of like a few of them of course with me 
knowing them,

854
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:32,890
they become this more confident person 
and it's just a matter of going through 

855
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,130
trials like getting,

856
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,140
getting beat down and then recovering,
getting like getting dominated.

857
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,220
Then you figure out a way to survive 
getting dominated and fit out,

858
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:46,270
figure out a way to turn it around a 
little bit and then you slowly keep 

859
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,871
raising your level of ability both 
physically and mentally to deal with 

860
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:54,730
various scenarios and challenges that 
come up with different guys you spar 

861
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,450
with.
I think even what we view as comics like

862
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,840
that can happen because I got a,
you know,

863
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:04,150
my shows when I go to them,
I usually people who maybe know who I 

864
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,150
am,
you know,

865
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:08,740
or they're my type of crowd,
but even whenever I saw you guys a 

866
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,671
couple of days ago at the comedy store,
I would show in my head like I went on 

867
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:16,670
stage in the first minute or two.
I felt my voice having that crack,

868
00:42:16,671 --> 00:42:17,550
which,
you know,

869
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,090
I've done this for 20 my voice usually 
it doesn't get,

870
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,830
but it's because I never performed 
there.

871
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:22,980
Uh,
the,

872
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,880
the crowd that was there necessarily 
didn't want to hear.

873
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:30,881
So I'm 44.
Here's some of the things I'm going 

874
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:30,881
through,
you know what I mean?

875
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:30,881
Because they were 20.
So I had,

876
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,740
I had a moment of that.
Then afterwards when I was driving home,

877
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,500
the show will end up going,
but I'm like,

878
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,530
yeah,
I need to,

879
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,920
I need to do that more.
Like throw myself in scenarios that are 

880
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,500
just in.
Just eat it.

881
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,430
Yeah.
You know?

882
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,480
Yeah,
absolutely.

883
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,790
He needs to eat it so I can like.
Yeah,

884
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,040
it's good.
Well that's one of the good things about

885
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:52,270
a place like the comedy store or any 
kind of show where you're practicing.

886
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,960
There's like eight guys on it and you 
can take some big chances with material.

887
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,840
You can.
You could.

888
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:01,870
I mean that's like one of the best 
places to come up with a completely new 

889
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:01,870
bit.

890
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,600
You have an idea in your car on the way 
over.

891
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,060
You know what?
Only one way to try.

892
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,120
Fuck it.
We'll just throw this out there and you 

893
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,041
know,
you sandwich it in between one good bit 

894
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:12,320
and then you slip this new one in there 
and he'd throw some water on it.

895
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,080
You see what you got?
What Ms Dot last time if you like.

896
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:19,100
When was the last time you ate?
Like ate it mentally in your head.

897
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,800
Maybe the audience like the audience 
sometimes doesn't know.

898
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,640
You know what I mean?
Right.

899
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,580
They think,
oh that was a great show in your head.

900
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:27,950
You're like,
I have those all the time.

901
00:43:27,951 --> 00:43:30,650
If I fuck up one bit,
I'm super hard on myself.

902
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:34,700
I had one last month I performed for 
Dale Earnhardt Jr.

903
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,280
Oh right.
And his race team.

904
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,920
WhOa.
And it was his birthday charity event.

905
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:40,160
Right.

906
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,770
So 600 people.
I get up there,

907
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,040
dAle earnhardt sr introduces me get on 
stage for I know no shit.

908
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,580
At least seven minutes,
seven minutes of bulletproof stuff,

909
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,850
stuff that's never,
you know,

910
00:43:57,851 --> 00:44:02,540
it's been tried and it's not even like 
giggle laughs,

911
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,010
right.
Stared at me.

912
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:09,380
I,
I talked for for at least five minutes 

913
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,350
of zero laughs and sweat bust out on my 
forehead.

914
00:44:12,351 --> 00:44:14,260
And I'm like oh my,
this is idle.

915
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:19,370
And for some reason at minute six I did 
a joke and everybody started applauding 

916
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,160
and laughing and then for the rest of 
the show,

917
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,600
you know,
they were cool.

918
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:27,530
How weird after like some of the people 
walk by and go,

919
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:32,531
yeah,
you were really funny and you started 

920
00:44:32,531 --> 00:44:34,571
off kind of slow.
Like that was the thing that's still in 

921
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:36,240
the guy who brought me this heffernan 
guy and no relation.

922
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,360
He said that they had What I thought.
Yeah,

923
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:42,220
right.
They sAid they had rape.

924
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:47,630
Um,
jeff foxworthy billing like other shows,

925
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,700
like they just had to listen to you and 
not maybe understand how you talk for 

926
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,870
the first six minutes of playing and 
talking fast.

927
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,380
Oh you talk like a foot.

928
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,480
But dude,
I was sweating and I'm like I have not 

929
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:03,480
had this happen.
And you know,

930
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,750
I remember we went to,
I think it was dallas,

931
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,710
no,
atlanta,

932
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,880
it was atlanta,
one of the first times I did the 

933
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,481
punchline down there and we did a radio 
station and they were asking us all 

934
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:14,760
these nascar questions and I was like,
what?

935
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,520
Like why would you think I would know 
anything about nascar?

936
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,750
And then I realized,
oh,

937
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,270
everybody knows everything about nascar 
down there.

938
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,510
And it's one of those things like when 
you find out about country music artists

939
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:25,870
that no,
never heard of,

940
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,330
but they sold $50,
million albums.

941
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,380
there's a lot of those.
TheRe's a lot that's a whole that south.

942
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:31,700
So a whole different culture,
man.

943
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,450
Whole thing,
whole different culture.

944
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:36,540
It'S a complete different world like our
world of,

945
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,590
you know,
you think like,

946
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,270
you know,
fill in the blank,

947
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,620
you know,
whatever band you like,

948
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:44,670
queens of the stone age and you know,
I heard the new iphones out there,

949
00:45:44,671 --> 00:45:46,370
fucking the new duck call came out.

950
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,110
They're all,
it's so realistic.

951
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,540
They're in their cars driving on the 
highway.

952
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:56,130
I mean it's just,
obviously I'm bullshitting,

953
00:45:56,131 --> 00:46:01,131
but there's parts of atlanta that are 
liked that parts of Georgia that are 

954
00:46:01,131 --> 00:46:02,730
like that.
Georgia is a fucking great country,

955
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,560
a great state court,
great country.

956
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:06,210
Atlanta,
Georgia is a great city,

957
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:11,700
but george's george is an interesting 
place because I'm like a lot of guys you

958
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:14,520
wouldn't think of or from Georgia like 
David Cross from Georgia,

959
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,620
that greeley smart,
sensitive,

960
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:19,110
intelligent guy.
He's from Georgia.

961
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,700
You know,
rem.

962
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,820
Rem.
Atlanta is a different kind of city man.

963
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:26,460
That's where belieber a taped is a 
special.

964
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,880
His netflix special.
That's outright now.

965
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:32,070
I please,
please get this.

966
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,040
If you're going to get a comedy special,
go get this.

967
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,580
Get mine too if you want,
but get his.

968
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:41,250
It's fucking great.
I'm a big bill burger fan.

969
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,170
I love that he's out there.

970
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:48,350
I love that.
He's always writing new shit and then 

971
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,700
he's just silly and fun and you know,
his act is,

972
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,740
it's a silly,
fun act.

973
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,660
He does his bit.
I don't want to give it away.

974
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,750
I'm not going to say anything about the 
bit,

975
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,600
but he does it bit about helicopters.
Yeah,

976
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,290
that's all I'm going to say.
It's so great.

977
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,260
It's so silly.
Fun,

978
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:05,250
man.
I really,

979
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:08,190
really enjoyed a set.
I just love him.

980
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:12,030
He's just a good dude.
He's a licker genuine good dude.

981
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,680
That's why I love performing with you 
guys a couple days ago cause you guys 

982
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,721
are all who you are.
So then lIke seeing you guys perform is 

983
00:47:20,721 --> 00:47:24,180
different than like when I'm on the road
and there's some little feature that the

984
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:25,890
local features,
I'm not saying don't suck,

985
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,320
but there's different conversations you 
have in the green room and the,

986
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:29,850
you know,

987
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,050
the,
the material is all kind of.

988
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:35,340
So it's nice.
Yeah,

989
00:47:35,341 --> 00:47:37,690
I know exactly what you mean.
I went to a headliner camp for like,

990
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,150
you know better.
Okay.

991
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:42,490
Then that's why I like doing those ice 
house shows.

992
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:43,290
Man.
The other day,

993
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,810
the ice house we had ready for this 
chris delea,

994
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,090
brian cowen,
bill burr,

995
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,480
tony hinchcliffe,
ian eDwards in me,

996
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,880
it was a motherfucker,
a motherfucker lineup,

997
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,920
but you guys wEre just murdering after 
murdering and for a few bucks to 15 

998
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:05,520
bucks,
what all of you cost individually on and

999
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,500
your theaters are clubs for the most 
part.

1000
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:10,670
Everybody you mentioned iS,
you know,

1001
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,770
a 20 dollaR plus ticket.
It's a sampler pack.

1002
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,190
Yeah.
But it's for 15 late shows actually cost

1003
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:21,460
me money because I take all the money 
that I get from those shows.

1004
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:25,600
I tip everybody out,
all the comics and that he usually,

1005
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:28,570
either I make 100 bucks or um,
our breakeven.

1006
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:29,980
Yeah.
I haven't always money every week.

1007
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,530
Yeah.
But they're there.

1008
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,800
So the place,
first of all,

1009
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:37,801
the ice house is a slice of heaven.
It's just one of the greatest buildings 

1010
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,740
in the free world.
It's amazing.

1011
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,040
Their club is magic.
It's like that club and the comedy store

1012
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,400
that.
But the ice house has magic in a whole 

1013
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:50,410
different way because it's pasadena.
It's not hollywood.

1014
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,660
So it doesn't have.
It's like full of itself vibes.

1015
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:55,000
So people like a little bit more chIll 
in pasedena.

1016
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:59,680
So oldest comedy club in the country,
the owner couldn't be nicer.

1017
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,730
I mean bob fisher is one of the nicest 
fucking people that's ever breathed air.

1018
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,880
He's just so sweet.
He's always liked that.

1019
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:09,490
He's got a great diy like always to 
everybody.

1020
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:14,491
You can walk up behind him.
He doesn't know you're there and he's 

1021
00:49:14,491 --> 00:49:14,620
talking to the manager or the wait 
staff.

1022
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,200
He's Always smiling.
He's just a sweetie.

1023
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:22,230
Just a sweetheart of a guy.
So like the staff there is awesome 

1024
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:23,920
because of that,
because of this like good vibe.

1025
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:29,100
Like all the waiters are so cool.
Like every time I go there I'm like 

1026
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:29,620
super happy to give everybody hugs.
It's just,

1027
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:31,750
it's,
it's a beautiful environment.

1028
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,840
And because of that,
like doing shows,

1029
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:36,460
there is like,
it's kind of special.

1030
00:49:36,461 --> 00:49:38,680
There's something special about it.
I'm there wednesday night.

1031
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,750
I love that fucking place.
We do.

1032
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:43,960
I do wednesday night at 10:00,
like every other week,

1033
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:46,540
every two weeks,
every three minutes just to set it up,

1034
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:51,870
just to,
just to fuck around there and have some 

1035
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,851
fun.
And also just to get people to keep 

1036
00:49:53,851 --> 00:49:53,851
going in that spot.
That spot.

1037
00:49:53,851 --> 00:49:55,480
It's awesome.
It's been some 19,

1038
00:49:55,481 --> 00:49:57,240
60 something.
What was the brand?

1039
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:01,000
It's been 53 years.
I think it is something crazy like that.

1040
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:03,880
So 61 or something like that when it 
opened.

1041
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:06,430
I can't think of it.
There's some really old school.

1042
00:50:06,431 --> 00:50:08,950
Huge comedy albums recorded there too.
Oh,

1043
00:50:08,951 --> 00:50:09,830
I'm sure.
Yeah.

1044
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,490
I want to do my next special there.
I'm committed.

1045
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:15,010
I'm committed to doing specials in 
comedy clubs.

1046
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,770
I'm committed to that.
That's a different thing then.

1047
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,910
Yeah,
that's what I'm trying to do,

1048
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,540
just because I think I might pay for 
this special all on my own.

1049
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:23,690
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1050
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,420
Film in a comedy club and just,
you know,

1051
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:28,100
so that's just cheaper and it's just as

1052
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,530
just as good as walking around a 
theater.

1053
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,740
Let me.
Theaters are nice too.

1054
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:36,870
I think it's better.
I think it's better just I'd have a 

1055
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:39,740
better show because it's,
it's what I normally do.

1056
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,780
Yeah.
I performed in theaters all the time.

1057
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,460
Then I would probably want to shoot.
Especially,

1058
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,140
although I have to say the burst 
special,

1059
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:50,141
he filmed at the tabernacle,
which is the same place that I felt my 

1060
00:50:50,141 --> 00:50:52,961
last special,
the one before this one and the 

1061
00:50:52,961 --> 00:50:53,510
tabernacle is a great spot for,
for doing standup.

1062
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:55,830
It's not too big.
I think it's only like,

1063
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,610
I want to say like 1300 or 1500.
It's not like a massey hall,

1064
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:04,400
which is like 3,400
and you get to that size theater,

1065
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,000
like joey diaz and I went to see Louis 
Black once we were,

1066
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:13,001
we were playing the next night.
We're playing on friday and he was 

1067
00:51:13,001 --> 00:51:14,630
playing at the same theater on thursday 
and we sat in the crowd and uh,

1068
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:19,690
it made me realize like there's certain 
shit that you can't hear the guy say 

1069
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:24,020
because everybody's laughing like you 
gotta be really careful with like subtle

1070
00:51:24,021 --> 00:51:24,410
shit.

1071
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:29,860
You got to make sure,
like you don't hear any laughter still 

1072
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,670
when you're doing something subtle.
So your timing kind of changes in those 

1073
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,700
really big rooms.
But the rush of the big room was like,

1074
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:40,930
yeah,
I think that most I've ever done was I 

1075
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:43,130
think 10,000
to some corporate event.

1076
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:44,390
It was,
it wasn't.

1077
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:49,391
People showed up to see me.
I was a sammy hagar was on and steve 

1078
00:51:49,391 --> 00:51:49,391
miller,
I was on.

1079
00:51:49,391 --> 00:51:51,140
Wow,
you worked a sammy hagar and steve.

1080
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:53,060
but what does steve miller looked like?
Did you even recognize him?

1081
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:57,270
A note because the album was only the 
white horse like,

1082
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,690
so by you know,
teenage years I've listened to me.

1083
00:52:00,691 --> 00:52:05,691
I've never saw what he looked like.
He looked like a dad with a blazer and 

1084
00:52:05,691 --> 00:52:06,980
jeans and just went out there.
That's the thing about steve miller.

1085
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:10,340
He is the least recognizable major.

1086
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,740
He walk around rockstar.
He could walk,

1087
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:15,950
run anywhere and it seemed like he never
tried to become famous.

1088
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:19,550
Or you're going to out him on the 
podcast that steve miller.

1089
00:52:19,551 --> 00:52:21,650
That's what it looks like now.
Dude.

1090
00:52:21,651 --> 00:52:24,260
He had some fucking jams.
Jungle love.

1091
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,060
that was that whole album.
Reminds me of high school.

1092
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,390
Take the money.
And this is still about billy joe.

1093
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,600
We thought we.
We thought we were cool too because 

1094
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,050
we're listening to classic rock that was
technically we're into this,

1095
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:42,650
not this new edition,
you know,

1096
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:47,680
it's really fucking weird man.
I went to high school in 1981 and in 

1097
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,190
1981 I started hanging out with these 
kids.

1098
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:54,191
I just moved into town into a newton 
upper falls and I started hanging out 

1099
00:52:54,191 --> 00:52:58,331
with my friend jimmy and jimmy and all 
of his friends were all from the other 

1100
00:52:58,551 --> 00:52:59,130
side of town.
They,

1101
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:04,140
they're all like the north part of 
newton and they were all like everyone 

1102
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:08,231
adores tee shirts and they were all 
smoking weed and it was like they 

1103
00:53:08,231 --> 00:53:10,670
introduced me to all this music that I 
didn't even know existed.

1104
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,060
But when I think about it now,
the shit was only 10 years old.

1105
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:16,310
Yeah.
Like the allman brothers,

1106
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:21,311
they were,
they were playing like some almond 

1107
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:21,311
brothers are some doors.
That shit is from like 1969,

1108
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:24,080
1970.
So at the time were talking.

1109
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,470
I went to high school in [inaudible] 
one.

1110
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:26,820
That was my freshman year.
This is,

1111
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:27,510
what is it?
Twelve,

1112
00:53:27,511 --> 00:53:29,490
13 years old.
Fuck nothing.

1113
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:34,140
That's like some music from 2001 that's 
contemporary,

1114
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:39,380
you know,
like a song from 2002 you could still 

1115
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:43,140
hear like on a regular basis that would 
be on a radio station that was eighties,

1116
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:47,110
nineties and male sex and can day.
Yeah.

1117
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:52,250
You can hear that.
You could eaSily hear that someone can 

1118
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,801
play that non.
Ironically on a regular radio station 

1119
00:53:54,801 --> 00:53:54,960
they wouldn't be saying,
oh you remember this shit.

1120
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:00,140
That would be a song they would play.
But that sex and candy song came out In 

1121
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:00,570
like like 99 or some shit.

1122
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,700
Yeah.
So think about that.

1123
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:03,780
Like that.
We wouldn't say,

1124
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:05,310
yeah man,
that was the classIc.

1125
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:10,430
Something fucking happened to time.
Time is not what it used to be 10 years 

1126
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:17,331
ago doesn't mean shit anymore.
But 10 years ago back then meant a lot 

1127
00:54:17,331 --> 00:54:22,190
when I was in high school.
And then in 1981 and 1970 car was a 

1128
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:27,141
mother fucker.
If you had a 1970 chevelle or a 1970 

1129
00:54:27,751 --> 00:54:31,110
barracuda you what?
A fucking sweet car.

1130
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:35,280
oh you got a classic muscle car.
It's only 10 years old.

1131
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:39,150
What the fuck happened?
And he does that when it happened.

1132
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:41,850
The acceleration,
just information.

1133
00:54:41,851 --> 00:54:46,851
We're pumped.
We're going to the library every single 

1134
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:46,851
second.
We look at her phone,

1135
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:46,851
you know,
that's what's happening,

1136
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:48,180
right?
That is what's happening.

1137
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:53,520
I was talking,
I talk about music onstage and I always 

1138
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:53,520
ask people in there are,
you know,

1139
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,100
people at the shows that are like 21 or 
all of their music has been digital 

1140
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,560
their entire life.

1141
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:04,310
Completely crazy.
There's like never physically touched 

1142
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:08,331
anything.
Just that's not even a a process that 

1143
00:55:08,331 --> 00:55:11,331
they have in their head.
I asked five people last night if they 

1144
00:55:11,331 --> 00:55:12,840
knew sissy space was and no one knew.
That's insane.

1145
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:18,620
If you haven't seen the original carrie,
you're doing yourself a massive 

1146
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,160
disservice.
That original carrie was a masterpiece.

1147
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,710
Is that brian depalma?
Who made that?

1148
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:24,770
God damn,
that was a good movie.

1149
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,900
That was like one of the best Stephen 
King adaptations and sissy spacey 

1150
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,720
knocked it out of the fucking park with 
a light saber.

1151
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,700
Just.
I mean,

1152
00:55:35,701 --> 00:55:40,170
she was so crazy in that movie,
like her character was.

1153
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:45,171
So it was.
There was something about the 

1154
00:55:45,171 --> 00:55:45,171
ridiculousness of someone having 
telekinesis,

1155
00:55:45,171 --> 00:55:47,520
but somehow or another she sold it like 
you bought it,

1156
00:55:47,521 --> 00:55:51,060
you believe when she came out there with
that fucking pig blood spoiler,

1157
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,390
she came out there and she had that pig,
but they don't pick blood on her head.

1158
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:58,950
They played a trick on her to get her to
think that she won the uh,

1159
00:55:58,951 --> 00:56:00,870
the prom.
They all voted for it just so they could

1160
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,610
dump blood on her head and she just tore
the city apart with her brain.

1161
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,980
And you're like,
get out of here with this stupid fucking

1162
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:08,370
movie.
Like,

1163
00:56:08,371 --> 00:56:10,910
that premise has been tried before and 
everybody goes,

1164
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,640
get the fuck outta here.
But in that movie it actually works.

1165
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,520
It's awesome.
That's a great movie.

1166
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:20,340
Do you ever watch that show?
It's now on netflix.

1167
00:56:20,341 --> 00:56:22,290
Carrie santa maria is the one that 
turned me on to,

1168
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,160
I believe in black mirror.
Black mirror.

1169
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,120
Have you?
Yes.

1170
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,200
Oh my god.
Great.

1171
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:28,960
Just watch the first episode on netflix 
and you'll be hooked.

1172
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:31,330
It's like twilight zone mixed with 
technology.

1173
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:36,630
It's beautiful.
In the first episode is one of my 

1174
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:36,630
favorites.
It's really good.

1175
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:37,420
I don't know why that is on in America.
Yeah,

1176
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,180
it's on bbc America,
right?

1177
00:56:39,181 --> 00:56:41,390
Yeah.
That's how I think I got it off of.

1178
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:46,060
I think I got it off a direct tv,
like one of those instant plays.

1179
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,710
You can do that.
It's on netflix.

1180
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,440
It's on netflix right now.
Yeah.

1181
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,890
That's a good show.
So amazing.

1182
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,390
Like mayor.
Yeah,

1183
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:58,190
I think it might be right about 
technology making like years seemed 

1184
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:01,900
quicker because we were watching an 
auction,

1185
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:02,530
you know,
one of those,

1186
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:05,200
uh,
those car auctions was on the tv show,

1187
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:10,201
the green room and uh,
it was in 2002 camaro and they rolled 

1188
00:57:10,421 --> 00:57:12,100
out this 2002 camaro and everybody's 
like,

1189
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,290
who fucking cares that thing out of 
here?

1190
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,830
nobody wanted it.
They were looking at is 2002.

1191
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,620
It only has 17 miles.
There's a reason for that.

1192
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,060
Do you know why would I get a 2002 
camaro?

1193
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,360
What'd you can get?
A 2014 and it's fucking dope.

1194
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:33,370
Or a 1969 and it's dope.
It's weird because I also,

1195
00:57:33,371 --> 00:57:38,371
I get jealous of new cars,
not because their new cars now it's 

1196
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,870
because of the gps is in their 
territory,

1197
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:42,460
their technology that's in it.
Like I want that car.

1198
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:43,200
Terrific.
I,

1199
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:48,260
I have a really nice expensive car but 
it's an old oh six.

1200
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:53,580
So the technology,
I cAn't even plug my phone into it and 

1201
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:53,580
well If you like the car,
you know,

1202
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,270
you can always just get aftermarket 
stereo.

1203
00:57:55,271 --> 00:58:00,271
Those are so much better anyway.
And the nav system now they updated and 

1204
00:58:00,271 --> 00:58:04,430
now embed it so much that I'm looking at
it right now to get the apple car play 

1205
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:06,270
and my old ford edge,
but they embed the sink in like sO I,

1206
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:10,570
I will lose so much if I get a factory 
or I'd take out the factory,

1207
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:15,571
like I'll get my oil change reports,
my emergency gps thing that kicks in if 

1208
00:58:16,511 --> 00:58:17,500
I've been in an accident.

1209
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:21,190
Oh all that's gone.
Well that's annoying.

1210
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:22,680
And then the,
the,

1211
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:23,670
so the,
the,

1212
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,320
you can't update the navigation system 
on those cars either?

1213
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:28,330
Absolutely.
Right.

1214
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:33,390
It reAlly pissed me off because with 
sync at least sync would update it 

1215
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:37,290
within like the first year,
like there'll be updates and there'd be 

1216
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:40,700
sync is the word,
but then they just gave up on it and 

1217
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:40,700
then I was like,
yeah,

1218
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:45,091
they just know they stopped giving any 
updates and so my shit's like doesn't 

1219
00:58:45,091 --> 00:58:46,690
even halfway work with my iphone 
anymore.

1220
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,520
Louisiana market.
I have an aftermarket stereo in the 

1221
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,990
porsche and I can download new maps and 
you can download updates.

1222
00:58:55,991 --> 00:59:00,991
It'll tell me.
it'll send me a signal and then I could 

1223
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:03,301
just download it through the,
through the wifi on my phone or the 

1224
00:59:03,301 --> 00:59:03,790
cellular connection on the phone.
It's a pretty slick.

1225
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,310
Let's talk about all fast technology.

1226
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:10,600
When you probably moved to los angeles,
he had a thomas guide.

1227
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,400
Yup.
Yeah.

1228
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:18,930
I'm surprised that they haven't really 
made a doc type thing where you just put

1229
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:24,181
in your like your ipad when you get into
your car and it turns into like a car 

1230
00:59:24,181 --> 00:59:25,870
stereo and it hooks up immediate 
automatically.

1231
00:59:25,871 --> 00:59:30,220
And bill burr had a fucking thomas guide
as recently as 2008.

1232
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:35,650
They'll do the hardest.
He fucking showed up at my house and I 

1233
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:35,650
go,
what is that?

1234
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:36,970
He had a map book on his front seat.
He goes,

1235
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,020
yeah,
I'm a fucking technology.

1236
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,970
I don't want it in my life.
I don't need it.

1237
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:43,180
I don't.
I don't need the gps.

1238
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:44,750
I don't need anybody.
No one where I'm going.

1239
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,730
Did you hear him?
But they know.

1240
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,930
They know that watching will.
You know they're watching you.

1241
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,490
They know what your fucking car is.

1242
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:51,980
Cool with that.
You're cool with them knowing where your

1243
00:59:51,981 --> 00:59:56,981
car is.
That last podcast I asked if he was 

1244
00:59:56,981 --> 00:59:56,981
still using mapquest.
He goes,

1245
00:59:56,981 --> 00:59:56,981
no,
I'd do it on the phone now.

1246
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:02,710
Finally gave up,
but he's got a phone that's like for 

1247
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:02,710
four years back.
Just the character man.

1248
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:07,930
Thomas guys were were like,
imagine telephone books with maps on 

1249
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,590
each page,
but then the find your street.

1250
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:14,650
Remember you had to go to the white and 
then you had to get a protractor and 

1251
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:14,690
fun,
but you would all.

1252
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,720
You do this all while you were driving 
by the way,

1253
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:22,130
not like members remember going on 
vacations or parents that they have like

1254
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:24,030
aaa triptiks where it's just like,
all right,

1255
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,580
turn next page.
Yeah,

1256
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:30,581
that's rIght.
I remember now I did this college tour 

1257
01:00:30,581 --> 01:00:34,391
when I was 20.
We had to go around the country and we 

1258
01:00:34,391 --> 01:00:34,391
had a game show.

1259
01:00:34,391 --> 01:00:37,550
It was called crack me up and you'd have
to pull a student.

1260
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:42,551
You'd be a student and I'd have to see 
you in a chair and then I would have a 

1261
01:00:42,551 --> 01:00:42,551
minute to make you laugh.
Oh,

1262
01:00:42,551 --> 01:00:42,950
I've seen something like that.
I can give you.

1263
01:00:42,951 --> 01:00:44,900
If you didn't laugh,
you got 25 bucks.

1264
01:00:44,901 --> 01:00:49,901
If you laughed you got tee shirt.
So I did maybe 200 dates of this tour 

1265
01:00:50,391 --> 01:00:54,260
just in a van with two other comics.
I'm driving around the country,

1266
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:59,380
but we had a big rand mcnally map and 
then you'd highlight it and then you 

1267
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:04,871
would drive and when you got 50 miles 
outside of the city you would go to a 

1268
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:08,130
payphone and then called the school.
Like it was such a.

1269
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:11,750
Like that was not that long ago,
you know?

1270
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:14,960
I know that sounds archaic there.
We got on the horse.

1271
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:18,260
Did you have a goto move for,
for that show?

1272
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:18,920
Oh my god.
Dude,

1273
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:20,660
it's a.
Yeah,

1274
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:22,550
I had a couple characters because we 
have props.

1275
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:24,370
How many seconds did you have to make 
them off?

1276
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,590
Uh,
I don't remember.

1277
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,610
Thirty seconds or a minute.
Seems like a lot.

1278
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,320
It could have been.
I don't remember.

1279
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,820
Are you comfortable telling us what you 
did?

1280
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,830
You're comfortable revealing your 
secrets.

1281
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:34,550
Okay.
Here's,

1282
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:39,580
here's the one that would get a.
I would do this guy called book report 

1283
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,220
guy.
Okay.

1284
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:46,030
Okay.
So I put on like a random funny hat and 

1285
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:49,841
then I was.
And then so we'd have like one of the 

1286
01:01:49,841 --> 01:01:52,541
comics would go now coming out and then 
you would say the character's name kid 

1287
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:56,741
given a book report on a book he didn't 
read and I would just literally make up 

1288
01:01:56,741 --> 01:01:58,160
a book report and just she would just 
wing it.

1289
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,720
Yeah.
And then they don't owe us.

1290
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,280
if people laughed,
doctor quam here.

1291
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:05,900
Here's character.
now coming out dr.

1292
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:10,990
Karma.
We had a japanese completely japanese 

1293
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:10,990
head thing.
You,

1294
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:11,960
you went japanese,
japanese,

1295
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,680
just a.
And I put on a doctor's thing and then I

1296
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:18,740
would move my lips and the comic behind 
the wall would talk.

1297
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,270
So it wasn't ever sink top.
Wow.

1298
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:22,460
Did it work?
You know.

1299
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:27,790
And,
and where it was scary is we would do 

1300
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:29,770
all these colleges in like if we thought
it was a,

1301
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:33,240
like a predominantly black school,
we knew we were dead in the water.

1302
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:38,610
Like a lot of times we go because we're 
like three white guys.

1303
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,430
one time,
I'll never forget mccook Nebraska,

1304
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:46,670
we did a show,
the basketball team comes and sits on 

1305
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:47,480
the front row.
Uh,

1306
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:50,300
one of the comics we're with,
um,

1307
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,500
was mixed.
It was half black,

1308
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:53,700
half white.
He went out,

1309
01:02:53,701 --> 01:02:56,140
he went after these guys just kind of,
you know,

1310
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:57,420
trying to make fun of them.

1311
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:59,100
Keep in mind,
this was nineties,

1312
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:03,420
so like def jam was kind of in people's 
brain that that's how comedy was,

1313
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:07,470
was that type of.
So he went after this a basketball team.

1314
01:03:07,471 --> 01:03:09,480
So we do the show,
we leave,

1315
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:13,640
we go to a local pool hall,
uh,

1316
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:18,890
why were in their seven of the 
basketball team come to the pool hall 

1317
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,160
and surrounded us and then they go to 
the other comic,

1318
01:03:23,161 --> 01:03:24,030
jason.
THey're like,

1319
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:27,360
don't ever say something in front of me 
again like that,

1320
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:27,720
but blah,
blah,

1321
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:28,530
blah.
I'm like,

1322
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:29,910
dude,
these guys are going to fight.

1323
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,010
we're dead.
we're,

1324
01:03:31,011 --> 01:03:33,350
we're completely dead.
So I remember I was racking,

1325
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,400
we were playing a nine ball.
I was racking and then I grabbed the 

1326
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,210
two.
You were ready to go to war.

1327
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,430
There was,
I thought we going to be killed.

1328
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,440
I thought we were going to.
So I'm like,

1329
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:43,980
here we go.

1330
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,810
So then,
uh,

1331
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,760
they said,
you better get out of town.

1332
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:50,160
You guys better leave or you're in a 
western,

1333
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:52,440
a western.
So in,

1334
01:03:52,441 --> 01:03:54,690
here's how I would handle myself in 
western.

1335
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:58,830
We ran back to the hotel as fast as we 
could through all of our clothes,

1336
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:01,140
just into one bag.
Jumped in the car.

1337
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:02,700
But we're in mccook,
Nebraska.

1338
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:05,340
It's all corn.
So as we're driving,

1339
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:10,610
we returned in,
you'd see headlights coming and you're 

1340
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:10,610
like,
okay,

1341
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:10,610
they're following us.
this is where,

1342
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:12,300
this is where we get shot.
Well they told you to leave.

1343
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:17,810
If they were going to do something new,
they wouldn't have told you to leave 

1344
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:17,810
there would say stay right here.
That's true.

1345
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,710
And then they would have just killed.
It was just beat your ass.

1346
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:24,890
The only reason why they would say you 
better get out of town as if they knew 

1347
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:25,430
that you were driving a long way and 
they could overtake you along the way,

1348
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,440
push you into a ditch,
and then their cousin who's the cop 

1349
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,250
would stall on the way over there and 
avoid some of the evidence.

1350
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:38,030
Who dodged the bullet?
There was some statistics somebody put 

1351
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:42,711
up about how many people get killed by 
cops and in what places like 

1352
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,720
albuquerque,
apparently albuquerque,

1353
01:04:45,721 --> 01:04:50,721
New Mexico is just like one of the most 
violent places for like police and 

1354
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:53,310
civilians.
Like cops in albuquerque.

1355
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:55,340
They've killed a gang of people like the
number.

1356
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,960
Like everyone is going crazy and 
berkeley.

1357
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,280
Have you guys been paying attention to 
this?

1358
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:02,070
They're stopping the highway like every 
night,

1359
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:07,500
like these kids are just blocking 
traffic on the highway and they're 

1360
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,041
getting arrested in their live tweeting 
while they're getting arrested and part 

1361
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:10,041
of me is like,
well,

1362
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:14,760
look,
at the very least they're making a big 

1363
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,240
fucking deal,
right?

1364
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:20,241
There's like a lot of eyes on this.
They're stopping the highway every 

1365
01:05:20,241 --> 01:05:20,241
night.

1366
01:05:20,241 --> 01:05:23,610
There's all these kids,
they're wandering through the street 

1367
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:23,680
signs.
They're fucking active,

1368
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,810
they're active,
they're making people think,

1369
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:31,410
and is it possible now?
I'm not in favor of shutting down the 

1370
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:31,630
highway because if you do shut down the 
highway,

1371
01:05:31,631 --> 01:05:33,670
there's some people that might be on the
way to the hospital.

1372
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:38,671
They might have some heart attack and 
you lose your grandpa because some kids 

1373
01:05:38,671 --> 01:05:41,020
thought it'd be cute to support that 
support the ferguson trial in the middle

1374
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:46,020
of the berkeley highway,
but is it possible that just knowing 

1375
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:50,190
that there's that much of a reaction,
that people freak out that much over 

1376
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:54,331
some shit that happened in Missouri that
it might make them second guess where 

1377
01:05:54,331 --> 01:05:55,330
they pull the trigger?
I say it probably does.

1378
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,580
Yeah,
probably does.

1379
01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:02,610
Right?
All the shit that you're seeing on the 

1380
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:03,490
news on a daily basis,
every time something happens,

1381
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,350
people get in trouble every time.

1382
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,730
Look at hollywood and highland.
No,

1383
01:06:06,731 --> 01:06:11,731
the other day I can't believe that guy 
got shot on right in the middle of 

1384
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:12,610
every.
You know,

1385
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:16,630
the center of hollywood in front of 
everybody and the only had a knife.

1386
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:19,840
What happened with that?
What is the official story?

1387
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:25,170
Do you know?
It's still being investigated because 

1388
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:28,450
I've heard all sorts of ridiculous 
conspiracy theories involved in costumes

1389
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:33,040
and that he was one of those players 
that pretends to be cosplay.

1390
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:38,310
Yeah.
Well there was a kid who was a cosplay 

1391
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:38,310
kid who got shot with a samurai sword.
Just see that.

1392
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:40,420
Yeah.
Some kid had a fucking samurai sword and

1393
01:06:40,421 --> 01:06:45,421
he was walking around pretending to be a
samurai and the cops fucking starts 

1394
01:06:45,421 --> 01:06:45,421
shooting at him.
Killed him,

1395
01:06:45,421 --> 01:06:47,370
you know,
and I don't think he threatened anybody.

1396
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,930
Do you think because it's aLl on the 
news now.

1397
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:55,170
Our cops like zero generation of cops 
that got really shitty training that 

1398
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:59,930
like shoot people first or do you think 
it's always gone at the same numbers?

1399
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:01,710
We have now,
it just,

1400
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:06,580
we've reached an age and with news and 
now I think it's more that they felt was

1401
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,890
all consistent.
Yeah,

1402
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:10,150
I think so.
I think if anything,

1403
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:15,151
it's probably less now than ever because
some places are starting to implement 

1404
01:07:15,151 --> 01:07:15,730
body cameras on the cops,
which should be mandatory.

1405
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:21,260
It's a crazy role to role of having 
ultimate power over another civilian.

1406
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:24,280
You know,
another another fellow citizen.

1407
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,940
That's a crazy role and that kind of 
power like the state.

1408
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:30,490
We've talked about this before,
but if you haven't heard this,

1409
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:35,820
google the stanford prison experiment 
and it's all about how they had a these 

1410
01:07:36,161 --> 01:07:41,161
kids and these one,
one group of kids would play security 

1411
01:07:41,161 --> 01:07:44,371
guards.
The other group of kids would be the 

1412
01:07:44,371 --> 01:07:45,130
prisoners and they fucking went bad.
Quick.

1413
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:50,490
People are gross like you can't.
he can't give that people that kind of 

1414
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:53,770
power like power,
like to shoot and kill other people.

1415
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,610
It's just people's default setting is,
is pretty shitty,

1416
01:07:57,611 --> 01:08:01,570
but we just have just enough.
We changed the stuff a little.

1417
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,450
You also have to think that if you're 
dealing with a cop,

1418
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:09,620
okay,
a cop is experiencing violence and 

1419
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:13,201
murder and theft and robbery and crime 
on a rate that the average person will 

1420
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:17,960
never know.
You will never know wHat it's like to be

1421
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:22,961
someone who every single night is just 
going to war every single night.

1422
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:28,120
You're dealing with bodies and people 
that had been shot and people that have 

1423
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:28,970
you fill,
fill in the blank,

1424
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:33,971
everything.
Rape and murder and child abuse and 

1425
01:08:33,971 --> 01:08:34,280
you're just constantly seeing horrible,
horrible things.

1426
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:37,370
So when something happens,
like a lot of these guys,

1427
01:08:37,371 --> 01:08:40,970
they're so ptsd out there,
they have just fucking trigger finger.

1428
01:08:40,971 --> 01:08:45,971
They almost can't control their.
They're experiencing like lifetimes of 

1429
01:08:45,971 --> 01:08:47,720
trauma in a year.
I mean,

1430
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:52,810
yeah,
if you're a cop and you're in a bad 

1431
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:54,281
neighborhood,
you're experiencing a lot of fucking 

1432
01:08:54,281 --> 01:08:57,101
shit and it affects people in different 
ways and I think it's just an 

1433
01:08:57,101 --> 01:08:58,660
unbelievably hard job to do.
Yeah.

1434
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:03,690
Yeah.
It's an unbelievably hard job to 

1435
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:03,690
instill.
THey get killed too,

1436
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:04,310
man.
You know?

1437
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:06,200
That's another thing you have to take 
into consideration.

1438
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:08,840
I think 53 people,
50.

1439
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:11,380
How many comps a year get killed?
I was reading the statistics.

1440
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:12,950
I don't want to.
I want to botch it.

1441
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,670
We just found,
um,

1442
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:18,850
I,
my grandpa,

1443
01:09:18,851 --> 01:09:23,090
I guess I've never met him.
He was a cop in detroit and was shot and

1444
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:28,091
we somehow came across the tIcket book 
that was in his pocket and there's a 

1445
01:09:28,091 --> 01:09:30,410
bullet hole going right through the 
parking ticket.

1446
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:31,790
The ticket book.
Yeah.

1447
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,310
Jesus christ tent.
Wow.

1448
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:39,590
Kind of a weird artifact to like locate 
though that 150 deaths per year.

1449
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:42,350
That's what it is.
One hundred 50 cops per year get killed.

1450
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,350
How many of you know?
Um,

1451
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:47,870
I don't know.
That's a good question.

1452
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,500
Okay.
900,000

1453
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:51,500
dollars.
900,000

1454
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:55,610
sworn law enforcement operators,
officers,

1455
01:09:55,611 --> 01:10:00,290
whatever you call them.
Well that's a lot.

1456
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,290
You know,
150 of them get killed in here a lot.

1457
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,560
A loT of fucking people.
They kill a lot of fucking people.

1458
01:10:06,561 --> 01:10:07,190
You're too.
Okay.

1459
01:10:07,191 --> 01:10:09,110
How many people did cops killed?
What's guessed that?

1460
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:10,220
How many people are cops?

1461
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,750
A lot of them.
Bad guys.

1462
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:12,830
Let's just.
We're not,

1463
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:14,780
this isn't a judgment thing.
We're just trying to find the number.

1464
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,960
How many people do cops kill every year?
I do want to get a 150 copies a year.

1465
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:28,730
A thoUsand 400.
Seems like 400 per year.

1466
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:32,840
$400.
I was going to say almost triple what?

1467
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:37,070
It was a couple of different sites that 
say it's 400 per year.

1468
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,080
So it seems like things low does it?
Yeah.

1469
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:46,540
Well,
I mean I guess half of them are still 

1470
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:46,540
like,
oh wait a minute.

1471
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:50,050
Hold on a second.
It says local police involved in 400 

1472
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:50,050
killings per year.
What the fuck?

1473
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,930
She's per city,
Washington dc.

1474
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,410
Oh my god.
Okay.

1475
01:10:54,411 --> 01:10:56,600
Nearly two times a week in the United 
States.

1476
01:10:56,601 --> 01:11:00,500
A white police officer killed a black 
person during a seven year period ending

1477
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:03,110
in 2012.
Whoa.

1478
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:07,960
That's fucking crazy.
That's a crazy statistic.

1479
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:13,890
Two times a week for seven years,
a white officer killed a black person.

1480
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:22,190
Like at what point in time do we have to
say that there might be a little bit of 

1481
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:22,650
a problem.
What?

1482
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:24,900
What?
How high do the numbers have to get with

1483
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:29,901
crime and police and police shootings 
and how high the numbers have to get 

1484
01:11:29,901 --> 01:11:31,650
before people go,
what the fuck is going on here?

1485
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:36,770
Like how,
how many black people are getting shot 

1486
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:39,681
by white cops?
How many black people are committing 

1487
01:11:39,681 --> 01:11:39,681
crimes?
How many white cops are looking to shoot

1488
01:11:39,681 --> 01:11:41,200
black people?
Like what are the answers?

1489
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:46,790
Like if you were the people that were in
charge of overseeing the police 

1490
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:47,460
department,
I don't know if they ask these questions

1491
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:50,370
but that will be like the first thing 
that I would want to address publicly if

1492
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:52,130
that fucking statistic.
You know,

1493
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,060
people started talking about that more 
often.

1494
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:59,480
Twice a week,
twice a week of white guys kill a black 

1495
01:11:59,480 --> 01:11:59,480
guy.

1496
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,650
That's,
that seems like a lot.

1497
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:03,900
I mean I don't want to laugh talking 
about that,

1498
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:07,500
but that seems like a ridiculous amount.
Like that's a good argument.

1499
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:09,480
And anybody that says that like you 
know,

1500
01:12:09,481 --> 01:12:13,440
that there's not at least the potential 
for racism.

1501
01:12:13,441 --> 01:12:16,920
Like how could you not look at that?
That number right there seems slow.

1502
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:20,640
I think Just in los angeles.
Twice to two cops.

1503
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:23,400
Shoot a black guy.
I don't know about that.

1504
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:28,430
Well,
they were talking about killing 18 

1505
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:30,471
percent of the blacks killed during 
those seven years were under the age of 

1506
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:33,471
21 compared to 18 or eight point seven 
of the whites.

1507
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:37,680
Man,
you know,

1508
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:38,460
and it's,
it's a,

1509
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:40,710
it's a double problem.
So this is the thing.

1510
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,840
Everybody wants to blame one side,
but there's,

1511
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:47,900
it's a double problem.
It's not simply a problem with the 

1512
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:49,080
police officers killing the black kids.

1513
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:54,530
It's definitely that,
but it's also crime ridden 

1514
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:56,010
neighborhoods,
how to stop the momentum of crime ridden

1515
01:12:56,011 --> 01:13:01,011
neighborhoods and kids that are coming 
out of those crime ridden neighborhoods 

1516
01:13:01,011 --> 01:13:01,011
that commit crimes.
Okay.

1517
01:13:01,011 --> 01:13:02,220
How do you stop that?
It's not,

1518
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:04,560
I don't believe it's the children's 
fault.

1519
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:09,620
I don't think it's the fault of a 16 
year old kid that grows up in an 

1520
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,260
unbelievably harsh environment and it 
becomes a criminal.

1521
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:15,261
I don't think it's his fault.
I think he's an unfortunate victim of a 

1522
01:13:15,261 --> 01:13:17,880
terrible situation.
I think nationally we have to figure out

1523
01:13:17,881 --> 01:13:22,881
what the fuck is causing that and if 
there's anything that they can do to 

1524
01:13:22,881 --> 01:13:26,931
mitigate that in some sort of way.
It's just a waste of resources and life.

1525
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:27,390
You're,
you're,

1526
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:30,970
you're asking people to grow up in an 
environment that's sold,

1527
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:34,030
likely going to fuck them up for live or
you.

1528
01:13:34,031 --> 01:13:34,350
Yeah.

1529
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:38,010
Or you have to do whatever the 
environment asks or you're dead.

1530
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,320
That a survival.
You're like,

1531
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:43,230
oh shit like that.
You really feel like doing this,

1532
01:13:43,231 --> 01:13:46,740
but you know,
no doubt man.

1533
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:49,020
No doubt is not.
And everybody goes,

1534
01:13:49,021 --> 01:13:50,000
well,
you go to choice.

1535
01:13:50,001 --> 01:13:51,330
You should fuck off,
man.

1536
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:54,660
If you live that guy's life,
then maybe you could judge,

1537
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,840
but you really don't know.
You don't know unless you live there.

1538
01:13:57,841 --> 01:14:00,240
And I'm just guessing.
I'm just totally guessing.

1539
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:01,800
No,
you know,

1540
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:06,860
I just think the whole thing,
ultimately it's a wakeup call for 

1541
01:14:08,251 --> 01:14:11,140
America.
I think there's a lot of people that are

1542
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,340
pretty fucking tired

1543
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:14,080
of the way things have been going in 
this country.

1544
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,660
You saw that video that,
that boy,

1545
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:20,620
like the boy with the pellet gun.
What did you know?

1546
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:25,621
My friend justin told me that that guy 
was fired from another police force and 

1547
01:14:25,621 --> 01:14:30,151
they picked him up because he had 
already gone through all this training 

1548
01:14:30,151 --> 01:14:32,431
and they picked him up and this forest,
but they had already decided this guy 

1549
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:33,670
might be like mentally unhung two 
seconds.

1550
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:36,240
So I think you see it.
Brian saw it,

1551
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,300
but I don't pull it up.
Jamie.

1552
01:14:37,301 --> 01:14:38,980
I don't want to watch it,
but I didn't want to watch.

1553
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:40,750
I didn't watch it.
I didn't watch it.

1554
01:14:40,751 --> 01:14:45,751
I just read it.
That two seconds they start shooting 

1555
01:14:45,751 --> 01:14:47,560
them like as the car is moving still 
don't get it man,

1556
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:52,620
I don't get it.
And then I read you read the comments 

1557
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:52,620
and it's always like,
well if you don't,

1558
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,640
if you don't want to be shot by the cops
then then don't do stuff.

1559
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:58,270
Like somebody was kind of like,
like bagging and it'll keep it as a kid.

1560
01:14:58,271 --> 01:15:02,420
I remember running around with guns cap 
guns and you know,

1561
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:07,060
playing war we go said let's play war.
And of course it's 12.

1562
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:12,120
Of course,
I definitely would have done it the 

1563
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,861
exact same thing and if I was in that 
situation and I was black and I was 

1564
01:15:13,861 --> 01:15:14,080
doing the exact same thing,
I might've got shot,

1565
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:19,590
they said he was scaring people and 
pointing the gun at him and he's 

1566
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,170
probably a disturbed little kid growing 
up in a fucked up place,

1567
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:22,330
you know,
it doesn't mean he has to get shot.

1568
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:27,510
We were like the last generation to 
actually have realistic army guns for 

1569
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:32,791
sale at toys r us at a point like in the
eighties we had guns that looked like 

1570
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:36,200
real uzis rob banks with those.
Yeah,

1571
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,480
yeah,
yeah.

1572
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,190
No orange,
orange thing.

1573
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:41,290
I think that was like in the nineties or
something.

1574
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:42,650
You can always cut that out.
Yeah.

1575
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:47,780
Yeah.
I know a dude with a drill for that 

1576
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,000
fucker out.
Make it look real.

1577
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,950
We had a game,
uh,

1578
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,440
I lived in a subdivision,
probably had like 40,

1579
01:15:53,441 --> 01:15:55,360
50 kids,
deep different ages.

1580
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:57,400
We,
I created this game called tag.

1581
01:15:57,401 --> 01:16:00,910
It was from a movie town,
the assassination game,

1582
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:06,410
and we had profiles.
We had everyone in high school or 

1583
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:10,200
whatever grade we were in your school 
pictures and then I'd write brian's 

1584
01:16:11,261 --> 01:16:13,120
home,
here's what bassy road,

1585
01:16:13,121 --> 01:16:18,121
here's his address,
and then you'd pass out those profiles 

1586
01:16:18,121 --> 01:16:20,680
and then you'd have to kill the guy that
whoever you got.

1587
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:23,260
And I remember the john dory come in my 
house,

1588
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:27,100
knocked on the door and my mind says 
somebody is there,

1589
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,800
open it.
It's during he pulled out a gun,

1590
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:35,400
you know,
like one of those ones that shot the 

1591
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,831
suction cups under the plastic with the 
pulled up black gun pointed right in my 

1592
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:38,140
head.

1593
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,780
Shot me right in the face with it.
My mom was standing right there.

1594
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:43,480
Didn't you know,
it's just like a son just got ya.

1595
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:45,930
You know.
But wall toy.

1596
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:47,980
Yeah.
We're all walking around with guns,

1597
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:51,190
knocking on people's doors,
pointing guns instead.

1598
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,410
You're doing it with all friends though.
Like you knew the dude,

1599
01:16:53,411 --> 01:16:54,790
right?
Some of the guys,

1600
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:59,791
like if you got the profile,
you didn't know him well and you just 

1601
01:16:59,791 --> 01:16:59,920
have to show up to him and shoot him.
But they were all playing the game.

1602
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,510
You all looked at it.
Yeah,

1603
01:17:01,511 --> 01:17:06,511
it was all like mob hits and that sounds
fun as long as someone's not genuinely 

1604
01:17:06,511 --> 01:17:07,540
mad,
like you know,

1605
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:10,290
someone like maybe like to grow up.
The other guy wound up where they are.

1606
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:15,730
The only rule we had was you couldn't 
shoot somebody on the way to school.

1607
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,860
Like that was our big thing just 
because.

1608
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:23,050
And I even bought a,
we had the spiderman things you put 

1609
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:25,190
around your wrist and you could shoot 
the rubber things through the spiderman.

1610
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:28,670
I wore that to school just in case 
somebody wanted to get shitty with me.

1611
01:17:28,671 --> 01:17:33,671
After school though.
It was actual weapons that you would 

1612
01:17:34,431 --> 01:17:39,431
push,
like where the spiderweb would come up 

1613
01:17:39,431 --> 01:17:41,650
and it would shoot the rubber bullets.
I'm talking about those rubber suction 

1614
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:42,660
cup guns.
Yeah,

1615
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:43,310
yeah,
yeah.

1616
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:44,990
It would shoot one of those so I could 
point.

1617
01:17:44,991 --> 01:17:46,760
So I had one shot.
It was like a derringer.

1618
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:51,880
Why do you have that up?
I was going to show you what he was 

1619
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,251
talking about.
They actually have to do a thing called 

1620
01:17:54,251 --> 01:17:54,251
street words where it's a whole city.
Thirty days,

1621
01:17:54,251 --> 01:17:56,510
24 slash seven water gun.
It's destination.

1622
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,040
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1623
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:00,560
That's a great idea.
That would be a fun thing.

1624
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:06,340
As long as you're doing it with cool 
people that aren't going to actually 

1625
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:06,340
kill you.

1626
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:09,220
I remember making the profile,
so I would take your picture and then I 

1627
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:10,120
would with stencil or whatever,
you know,

1628
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:15,160
home office stuff we had,
I would make a little profile and I 

1629
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,880
remember my dad going at wish you'd 
spend more time on your homework then.

1630
01:18:16,881 --> 01:18:19,040
Like I was obsessed with this game.
Yeah.

1631
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:21,690
But your dad was incorrect because uh,
you,

1632
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,260
you gravitated towards fun and now 
you're successful.

1633
01:18:24,261 --> 01:18:26,240
Standup comedian dad was totally 
incorrect.

1634
01:18:26,241 --> 01:18:27,920
Yeah.
Parents are often incorrect,

1635
01:18:27,921 --> 01:18:32,921
man.
Got to get out of your fucking kids way 

1636
01:18:32,921 --> 01:18:34,421
sometimes.
But then the other thing is I bet by 

1637
01:18:34,421 --> 01:18:36,020
like not encouraging you to do stand up 
comedy.

1638
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:41,290
Like you probably like,
like by saying like you gotta get your 

1639
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:44,351
shit together.
Why you spent all this time playing the 

1640
01:18:44,351 --> 01:18:44,351
stupid fucking game.
You should be doing your homework.

1641
01:18:44,351 --> 01:18:44,870
But by,
by doing that,

1642
01:18:44,871 --> 01:18:48,260
like they put a little pressure on you 
and it makes sure that I'll show you.

1643
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,680
Like some kids don't have that.
Yeah,

1644
01:18:51,681 --> 01:18:54,410
I'll show you because their parents were
always super supportive,

1645
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,140
so if shit goes wrong they don't know 
what the fuck to do.

1646
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:00,920
My parents didn't know my.
I did stand up for like five years.

1647
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:06,010
Really never even told them and then 
somebody saw me like at an open mic and 

1648
01:19:06,231 --> 01:19:11,231
asked my dad and then my dad goes and he
was you doing standup comedy and it was 

1649
01:19:11,661 --> 01:19:13,100
weird.
Like I was probably.

1650
01:19:13,101 --> 01:19:16,340
My dad was probably whatever the math is
my age now.

1651
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,990
So just like imagine like you then 
you're like,

1652
01:19:20,991 --> 01:19:25,250
it's so you think your dad was an hip 
and cool and wouldn't want to be,

1653
01:19:25,251 --> 01:19:28,910
but there is a major advantage to 
raising kids when you get older,

1654
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:32,690
you know you have your shit together at 
least a little bit better.

1655
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:37,520
Like when you're 20 or 21,
like I couldn't imagine raising a kid at

1656
01:19:37,521 --> 01:19:39,210
2116.

1657
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:41,690
That was a lot of people to do it.
my life wasn't 16,

1658
01:19:41,691 --> 01:19:44,600
17.
My wife was 19 when she had her.

1659
01:19:44,601 --> 01:19:46,820
God damn man,
that's crazy.

1660
01:19:46,821 --> 01:19:51,821
It's just what an unbelievable 
responsibility when you're barely and 

1661
01:19:51,821 --> 01:19:51,821
she's in rome,
nervous.

1662
01:19:51,821 --> 01:19:53,340
She was in the military and having a 
kid.

1663
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,910
It's crazy.
You're barely an adult.

1664
01:19:55,970 --> 01:20:00,970
Barely.
I mean as an 18 year old or an adult 

1665
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:00,970
technically.
Yeah,

1666
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:01,820
but we all know 18 year olds,
they're like children.

1667
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:04,970
You know the children that know a little
bit more than the average child.

1668
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:07,640
They're just experiencing life and 
they're still trying to figure.

1669
01:20:07,641 --> 01:20:08,010
I mean,
when I

1670
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,930
was 18,
I was a fucking moron.

1671
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:11,460
I was a moron last week.
Yeah,

1672
01:20:11,461 --> 01:20:11,940
yeah,
yeah.

1673
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:17,280
I was a moron a couple of hours ago.
Know you're 18.

1674
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:19,310
god,
you're fucking super duper moron,

1675
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,820
but are 18 was

1676
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,970
way dumber than today's 18?
Oh yeah.

1677
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:25,420
No,
a million times.

1678
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:27,870
No doubt about that.
We were dumber,

1679
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,000
heavier.

1680
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:31,590
Fuck.
it didn't have access to as much.

1681
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,930
They're super fucking experienced.
The kids of today,

1682
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:41,960
they're super experienced in like not 
just like physical experiences but 

1683
01:20:42,001 --> 01:20:47,001
experiences like understanding like all 
sorts of different points of view and 

1684
01:20:47,001 --> 01:20:48,360
different information,
different sides of things.

1685
01:20:48,361 --> 01:20:53,361
Like they're mOre informed.
They're just more on their brains are 

1686
01:20:53,361 --> 01:20:55,110
working at like a higher level.
I really believed that.

1687
01:20:55,111 --> 01:21:00,111
I've talked to some 20 year olds and I 
feel like I'm talking to like a young 

1688
01:21:00,111 --> 01:21:04,191
adult,
whereas if when I was 20 and I would 

1689
01:21:04,191 --> 01:21:04,880
talk to other 20 year olds,
I was talking to mo ron,

1690
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:10,580
other fellow morons who we would give 
each other advice and tell each other 

1691
01:21:12,211 --> 01:21:14,940
more ron facts that weren't real at all.
You know,

1692
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:20,000
that was back then.
I mean it's so nice to live like now if 

1693
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,470
you have a random trivia question,
are you like how many cops were shot?

1694
01:21:22,471 --> 01:21:25,860
SomeBody you have access to that but,
but like back in the day guys at bars,

1695
01:21:25,861 --> 01:21:28,520
it would have to debate it.
Like nobody knew that,

1696
01:21:28,521 --> 01:21:30,660
you know,
knew the answer to anythIng.

1697
01:21:30,661 --> 01:21:31,470
You would just have to.

1698
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:37,690
Yeah.
It's really interestingly if you play 

1699
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:39,611
video games nowadays because you're,
you're matched up with kids all the 

1700
01:21:39,611 --> 01:21:40,610
time.
So you're online talking to other adults

1701
01:21:40,611 --> 01:21:44,160
and then you have thIs like 22 year old.
That's an analytic guys I'm ready in its

1702
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:47,360
people are like havIng full on 
conversations with these kids.

1703
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:51,110
It's so weird.
They don't seem like kids anymore.

1704
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,440
Yeah,
I gave up playing.

1705
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,670
Yeah.
There's,

1706
01:21:53,671 --> 01:21:56,400
um,
there's just a new reality.

1707
01:21:56,401 --> 01:21:58,800
Men is a new reality that we're 
experiencing.

1708
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:00,140
I had this guy on last,
yes,

1709
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:04,490
less yesterday.
he's a futurist and he just a,

1710
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:09,670
just kind of a guy who's invested in the
idea of trans humanism and all this 

1711
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:12,720
advancement of technology,
but he was talking about how in 20 years

1712
01:22:12,721 --> 01:22:15,120
we may not even talk to each other 
anymore.

1713
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:20,300
Everything might be done through like 
mind interfaces that work like the 

1714
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:20,820
internet,
like this,

1715
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:25,980
this device that they recently tested.
They were able to transmit thoughts 

1716
01:22:26,370 --> 01:22:28,380
through the internet over like,
you know,

1717
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:32,040
500 miles or something crazy like that,
like a very far distance.

1718
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,890
And you wear this thing and like you 
think,

1719
01:22:34,891 --> 01:22:36,540
like,
say if you think of hello,

1720
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:38,280
you think hello?
Like you,

1721
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,200
you keep saying like hello,
hello.

1722
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,770
And it reads what your brain is doing 
when it says hello.

1723
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:49,100
And so then it recreates that.
So the person on the other end on the 

1724
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:52,050
internet has his helmet on and they hear
in their head hello.

1725
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:55,770
And you're not saying anything like 
you're not using your mouth.

1726
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,900
You're using your fucking brain.
Hey,

1727
01:22:57,901 --> 01:23:02,901
you're sending a word through your brain
to someone else's brain through the 

1728
01:23:02,901 --> 01:23:03,780
internet and it's really crude right 
now.

1729
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:08,810
Yeah.
I wonder if there's auto correct for 

1730
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:08,810
that.
Like think something switches.

1731
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:14,160
Right?
If someone's got like a deep like 

1732
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,110
chicago aksana and that's what I meant.
Shock each cac.

1733
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:22,540
What the fuck did you say?
I was thinking that technology to even 

1734
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,730
drive and I had a meeting today that was
just like,

1735
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,600
I thought I wish I could just hollow 
grandma.

1736
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,670
Like at this point I'm eating right?
Yeah,

1737
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:33,890
but that'll probably be in our lifetime.
Don't like.

1738
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:38,910
I've seen technology biff of like cisco 
was doing.

1739
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:42,310
Have you seen magic leap?
Seen tupac?

1740
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:44,620
Have you seen magic?
No.

1741
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:48,680
Magic leap is the new shit.
It's this ridiculous technology there.

1742
01:23:48,681 --> 01:23:53,681
There's a video that they show online 
where a guy's his hands out and there's 

1743
01:23:53,681 --> 01:23:56,851
a little baby elephant that is 100 
percent realistic and it's dancing in 

1744
01:23:56,851 --> 01:23:58,990
his hand.
So like some new hologram technology.

1745
01:23:58,991 --> 01:24:02,050
It's just they're just releasing part of
like this.

1746
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:02,920
It might.
Who knows?

1747
01:24:02,921 --> 01:24:04,090
It might,
It might be a hoax.

1748
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:09,570
The whole thing might be like pumping up
some fucking new movie that's coming 

1749
01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:13,471
out.
I actually think that this photo that 

1750
01:24:13,471 --> 01:24:13,471
you know,
or this video,

1751
01:24:13,471 --> 01:24:15,100
I think this was just maDe to like,
this is what it should be like,

1752
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:17,520
but I don't think it seems like they 
don't.

1753
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:21,340
They don't explain enough,
but watch this because it's so bizarre.

1754
01:24:21,341 --> 01:24:26,341
Dude.
This guy has his hands out and as his 

1755
01:24:26,341 --> 01:24:29,221
hands are out,
this elephant starts dancing around in 

1756
01:24:29,221 --> 01:24:31,861
his hands.
Were going to pull up the video part of 

1757
01:24:31,861 --> 01:24:31,861
it.
Yeah.

1758
01:24:31,861 --> 01:24:35,371
We'll just show it to over here.
It's really crazy to watch and there's 

1759
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:36,930
another one where there's a little girl 
like,

1760
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:41,940
look At this.
He opens his hands up and look at this 

1761
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:41,940
elephant dancing around inside of his 
hands.

1762
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:43,580
I mean,
come on son.

1763
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:45,790
Fuck.
is that the thing is making shadows.

1764
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:49,270
How's it making shAdows?
Like what is that?

1765
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:52,300
Find that dude.
Find out if that.

1766
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,480
Yeah,
it was the seventies.

1767
01:24:55,481 --> 01:25:00,481
We'd be at a bar and we debate it.
Why don't you google jamie google 

1768
01:25:00,581 --> 01:25:05,581
whether or not that's real,
because that sounds like no one knows 

1769
01:25:05,581 --> 01:25:06,730
some new technology,
some new technology.

1770
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:10,850
All right,
we'll figure it out motherfucker.

1771
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:16,760
Like five years from now we're going to 
be looking back at that and then it's 

1772
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:16,760
going to be something sIlly that I 
remember.

1773
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,580
We thought that was a real,
you know,

1774
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:21,160
what they're doing with this voice 
technology thing.

1775
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:26,190
If that really comes true and you really
can communicate through words in each 

1776
01:25:26,651 --> 01:25:30,310
other's minds without talking and then 
there's no more spoken language and then

1777
01:25:30,311 --> 01:25:32,680
there's like a universal language that 
everybody adopts.

1778
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:37,830
This is the idea that you're going to 
wear these fucking headset things and 

1779
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:38,890
you're going to go into a virtual 
reality,

1780
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:41,140
so you'll have this headset thing on.

1781
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:46,140
Then you'll have like an oculus rift on 
and you will like be in a meeting with 

1782
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:50,350
these people and you know they can have 
avatars to represent who they are.

1783
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:55,650
Like you can go into this three d,
virtual reality with this headset on and

1784
01:25:55,961 --> 01:26:00,961
see people and you don't even realize 
they're fake until you try to touch 

1785
01:26:00,961 --> 01:26:01,330
them.
I think it have couches set up.

1786
01:26:01,331 --> 01:26:06,331
They could have a room set up where you 
could have like a three d meeting and 

1787
01:26:06,331 --> 01:26:09,941
everything looks exactly the same on 
both sides as far as the furniture so 

1788
01:26:09,941 --> 01:26:10,160
the person can come in,
sit down,

1789
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:11,420
talk,
hang out with you,

1790
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:14,450
and you literally will feel like you 
were in the room with them and you won't

1791
01:26:14,451 --> 01:26:16,040
know you're not until you try to touch 
them.

1792
01:26:16,830 --> 01:26:21,830
I'm just going to be like the matrix 
where everything just going to be gray 

1793
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:23,480
and dingy,
but in your virtual world is going to be

1794
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:23,930
beautiful.

1795
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,100
That the life.
Yeah,

1796
01:26:25,101 --> 01:26:28,190
and then that seemed so silly.
That's going to happen,

1797
01:26:28,191 --> 01:26:29,170
right?
Well,

1798
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:31,700
it will definitely have ruin the 
environment,

1799
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:37,060
right?
If we ruin the environment and it seems 

1800
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:39,281
like we're kind of on that path.
I mean there's a lot of concern about 

1801
01:26:39,281 --> 01:26:42,491
the environment now and there's a lot of
people that are making all these big 

1802
01:26:42,491 --> 01:26:43,970
efforts so generation is going to get 
good at saving the environment.

1803
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,940
Well actually that's not true because 
Norway has zero,

1804
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:50,210
zero garbage now.
I believe it's Norway.

1805
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:55,420
They figured out how to completely 
recycle all their trash so they have 

1806
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:55,430
like,
I think it's Norway.

1807
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:59,270
Let me find out Norway and have to 
figure this out.

1808
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:00,640
Yeah.
Right.

1809
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:04,550
Years ago,
I think they use all of us.

1810
01:27:04,551 --> 01:27:08,330
I believe it's Norway,
Sweden,

1811
01:27:08,331 --> 01:27:10,550
Sweden runs out of garbage.
90 nine percent.

1812
01:27:10,551 --> 01:27:11,690
Sweden,
Norway.

1813
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:17,110
I'm going to stockholm there in january 
for a 99 percent of sweden's garbage is 

1814
01:27:18,621 --> 01:27:19,460
now recycled.

1815
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:23,210
That's fucking incredible.
That's incredible.

1816
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:28,900
I mean that is like almost zero trash.
One percent trash.

1817
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:31,970
It's amazing.
I saw something on water.

1818
01:27:31,971 --> 01:27:36,971
I think it was a documentary about los 
angeles or California running out of 

1819
01:27:36,971 --> 01:27:40,670
water and they had some plant that had 
sewage,

1820
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:45,700
like literally it was sewage water and 
an hour and a half later it was as clean

1821
01:27:45,711 --> 01:27:50,711
as bottled water drinking.
They have that drinking straw where you 

1822
01:27:50,711 --> 01:27:53,390
can just drink and it filters anything 
and they have like a guy,

1823
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:56,180
like a video of a guy drinking straight 
p out of it,

1824
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:58,670
filtering it.
How dare he.

1825
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:02,280
Have you seen ian candidate?
The moving?

1826
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:02,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

1827
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,720
The new one or the original one?
I think I've seen both.

1828
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:10,800
Yeah.
That's an interesting movie about how 

1829
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,780
they had implants put in and how they 
can control.

1830
01:28:11,781 --> 01:28:12,470
Um,
and yeah,

1831
01:28:12,471 --> 01:28:17,471
I think I fell asleep during the new one
for some reason I was probably tired 

1832
01:28:17,471 --> 01:28:22,151
when I was washing it,
but the first one was pretty 

1833
01:28:22,151 --> 01:28:22,151
interesting.

1834
01:28:22,151 --> 01:28:22,151
The idea is pretty interesting.
That's like an,

1835
01:28:22,151 --> 01:28:26,410
an idea that always gets bandied about 
and conspiracy theory circles like they 

1836
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:30,551
believe that someone could be in a 
manchurian candidate and like the guy 

1837
01:28:30,551 --> 01:28:30,551
who took out,
martin luther king didn't even know what

1838
01:28:30,551 --> 01:28:30,850
he was doing,
you know,

1839
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:31,840
that kind of shit.
Yeah.

1840
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:36,970
Jack ruby technology,
a cool story.

1841
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:40,700
My brother in law was a hit,
was blown up in Afghanistan.

1842
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:41,750
He blew off.
So.

1843
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:45,440
So his quad got blown off,
right?

1844
01:28:45,441 --> 01:28:50,441
Yeah.
so it is that you've topped muscle of 

1845
01:28:50,441 --> 01:28:50,441
your lake.
Kind of dumb about this.

1846
01:28:50,441 --> 01:28:50,441
Yeah.
So the,

1847
01:28:50,441 --> 01:28:51,860
the,
the quad got blown up.

1848
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:56,060
So he's been in a wheelchair for four 
years so far.

1849
01:28:56,061 --> 01:28:57,050
This is one that happened,
rIght?

1850
01:28:57,530 --> 01:29:02,530
Um,
gained a bunch of weight and then the 

1851
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:02,530
created this almost

1852
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:07,020
iron man bionic leg that he can put 
around his leg.

1853
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:10,830
And then there's like a computer where 
your knee would be and it,

1854
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:16,100
it moves his legs,
100 percent paralyzed in this bionic 

1855
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,130
leg,
moves his leg for him.

1856
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:18,850
And then it also has a,
uh,

1857
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:23,900
like a,
a fall feature where it senses if he's 

1858
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:27,681
going to fall,
then it locks up so it acts like a 

1859
01:29:27,681 --> 01:29:30,801
kickstand.
And then he was talking about that 

1860
01:29:30,801 --> 01:29:34,090
they're doing stuff like you were saying
where you could have thoughts and 

1861
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:35,940
eventually control it to say move 
forward or kick hard.

1862
01:29:35,941 --> 01:29:39,210
Like you can start to give it more now,
which is kind of like,

1863
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:44,890
you know,
stabilizes them so we can stand up and 

1864
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:44,890
he,
you know,

1865
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:45,810
he walks with that.
But I mean you got to like walk and hold

1866
01:29:45,811 --> 01:29:47,940
his wife's hand for the first time in 
four years,

1867
01:29:47,941 --> 01:29:51,570
like standing because he's a big dude.
And that's the biggest thing is,

1868
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:54,630
is he just said hates being in a 
wheelchair,

1869
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:59,840
like going out because people,
because he's always talking to people 

1870
01:29:59,840 --> 01:29:59,850
like looking.
You used to be in a big.

1871
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:02,430
But the technology is pretty bad ass.

1872
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,990
It's getting better all the time.
We,

1873
01:30:03,991 --> 01:30:08,991
uh,
we talked about that on the show 

1874
01:30:08,991 --> 01:30:08,991
yesterday that there's now a soft 
exoskeleton suit.

1875
01:30:08,991 --> 01:30:13,950
They used to be like,
they had these big hard exoskeletons 

1876
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:13,950
with like,
you know,

1877
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:17,561
like metal pipes are rods down the sides
of it and joints and hinges.

1878
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:20,360
The new ones are like way sleek.
They almost look like,

1879
01:30:20,361 --> 01:30:22,100
just like pants,
you know,

1880
01:30:22,101 --> 01:30:25,440
and there are those things that make you
like live like strong way stronger.

1881
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:26,520
They make us stronger.
You can,

1882
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,800
you can do things,
you can go longer,

1883
01:30:28,801 --> 01:30:30,900
you can go up hills.
Like for soldiers,

1884
01:30:30,901 --> 01:30:35,901
they're gonna enable soldiers to carry 
much larger packs and they're gonna be 

1885
01:30:35,901 --> 01:30:38,100
able to walk for much longer because 
it's going to barely take any effort.

1886
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:40,620
There'll be like 50 percent effort.
Yeah,

1887
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:41,710
pretty crazy,
right?

1888
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:43,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

1889
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:48,540
I mean there,
there's just an endLess amount of super 

1890
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:51,960
smart people out there that are 
constantly coming up with new inventions

1891
01:30:51,961 --> 01:30:55,530
that we're just like every now and then 
one pops up on your google news feed and

1892
01:30:55,531 --> 01:30:56,790
you're like,
what the fuck?

1893
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:57,420
Man?
It's like,

1894
01:30:57,630 --> 01:30:59,760
it's constant.
It's every day,

1895
01:30:59,761 --> 01:31:03,570
there's some new thing every day there's
some new breakthrough,

1896
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:08,780
new technology,
new discovery that now they're saying 

1897
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:09,120
there was something that I tweeted 
today.

1898
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:14,330
They're saying there might.
The big bang might have caused a 

1899
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:14,670
parallel universe where time moves 
backwards.

1900
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:20,040
So we mIght have a mirror universe like 
this universe is going this way,

1901
01:31:20,170 --> 01:31:25,170
right?
There's another universe that's going 

1902
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:25,170
on.
Exactly.

1903
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:25,170
Taken his sat,
hating it.

1904
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:25,530
No,
the opposite.

1905
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:31,030
It's like the fucking earth has ended 
and it's slowly forming back to the big 

1906
01:31:31,771 --> 01:31:32,700
bang.
oh,

1907
01:31:32,701 --> 01:31:37,701
okay.
So who knows what time it is in this 

1908
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:37,701
other one?
If it's backwards,

1909
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:42,560
I mean,
who knows where we are in the life of 

1910
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,271
the universe.
We know that we're like 14 point 7 

1911
01:31:44,271 --> 01:31:46,550
billion years,
so if we're for or whatever the hell it 

1912
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:48,651
is,
if the universe is 14 billion years old 

1913
01:31:48,651 --> 01:31:51,980
that this other one is 14 billion years 
and the total opposite direction is 

1914
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:56,530
right when we die,
we get reborn in the new world and we 

1915
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:56,530
never die maybe.

1916
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:57,520
Right?
Maybe qmap.

1917
01:31:57,550 --> 01:31:58,090
I mean,
we,

1918
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:01,990
we assume that this is how time goes,
that you know,

1919
01:32:01,991 --> 01:32:05,570
you do this aNd you do thAt and you move
forward and you cloSe your laptop to get

1920
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:10,580
in your CAR and you say goodbye,
but it's only because that's how we've 

1921
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:13,231
always lived.
Like the idea of everything going 

1922
01:32:13,231 --> 01:32:15,220
backwards is incomprehensible.
But if everything can go forwards,

1923
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:17,320
why can't it go backwards?
I meAn,

1924
01:32:17,410 --> 01:32:19,810
who's to say that things can't go back 
to their source?

1925
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:24,900
Who's to say that like you can't like 
start off in some sort of a neutral 

1926
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:28,411
position and have everything 
instantaneously be you when you're 90 

1927
01:32:28,411 --> 01:32:32,700
and then slowly go benjamin button style
back to zero again and crawling your 

1928
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:35,560
mom's pussy.
I mean,

1929
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:37,990
why not?
If you can come out of a person's pussy,

1930
01:32:37,991 --> 01:32:41,030
that's just as ridiculous as you going 
back in it and,

1931
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:46,040
and,
and reentering the hive of the universe 

1932
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:49,380
is just as bizarre to come out of a 
pussy than it is for you to become an 

1933
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:49,830
old man.
And then a child in,

1934
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:54,860
you have this other organism that you 
recognize as your mother that is going 

1935
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:56,200
to take you into its body and it's going
to absorb your soul,

1936
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,820
and then you pass into the next 
dimension.

1937
01:32:57,821 --> 01:33:02,410
Then you're born on earth in our time.
Start over and start all over again.

1938
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:10,320
Would you be happy if you knew you were 
going to live your life as john heffron 

1939
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,330
over and over and over again?
Would you be willing to do this again?

1940
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:18,570
If you knew that life really is like 
some kind of a bizarre video game where 

1941
01:33:20,801 --> 01:33:25,801
you're going to play the same character 
ad nauseum to the end of the time until 

1942
01:33:25,801 --> 01:33:25,940
you get it right?
Yeah.

1943
01:33:25,941 --> 01:33:27,640
Right?
Because so it is like a video game.

1944
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:32,641
If you don't make it past level one,
then you go back and eventually I would 

1945
01:33:32,641 --> 01:33:37,381
love that.
If there's a way you could talk to your 

1946
01:33:37,381 --> 01:33:39,310
future or your past self to let you know
that what you want to know.

1947
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,000
I don't know.
Sometimes I think that's what days you 

1948
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:45,000
have a movement.
Like if you haven't deja vu,

1949
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:45,940
it's because you've done this a billion 
times.

1950
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:47,180
No,
no,

1951
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:52,220
I don't think they.
I think they have a scientific 

1952
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:52,220
explanation for vu.
I forgot what it is.

1953
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:53,200
It's something about your eyes.
It just.

1954
01:33:53,201 --> 01:33:55,210
It's like a half secoNd.
Taking the info.

1955
01:33:55,290 --> 01:33:56,870
Are we guessing?
It's a backfire against.

1956
01:33:57,390 --> 01:34:02,110
Why are we guessing?
Explanation idiots,

1957
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:06,370
because we're all had passed at 70.
At a bar date.

1958
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:10,060
Your watch is going to go.
That's not what it is.

1959
01:34:13,330 --> 01:34:15,070
How stuff works.
What is deja vu?

1960
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:17,770
Here we go.
The term dejA vu.

1961
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:23,610
It's french and it means literally 
already seen those who have experienced 

1962
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:28,891
the feeling.
Describe it as an overwhelming sense of 

1963
01:34:28,891 --> 01:34:28,891
familiarity.
That's what we all feel.

1964
01:34:28,891 --> 01:34:28,891
Right?
Right.

1965
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,910
okay.
Let's see what the reason is.

1966
01:34:30,911 --> 01:34:34,810
The phenomenon is rather complex.
There are many different theories.

1967
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:36,400
Okay,
so no one really knows.

1968
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:41,490
Swiss scholar arthur hottest guys name 
ready for this swiss scholar,

1969
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:45,850
arthur funkhouser.
That's his fucking name.

1970
01:34:45,851 --> 01:34:47,590
Phone call.
He's my new favorite person.

1971
01:34:47,591 --> 01:34:50,200
Yeah,
arthur funkhouser.

1972
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:55,560
Oh,
that would be the greatest character in 

1973
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,451
a movie ever.
The funkhouser a classic rock dj arthur 

1974
01:34:57,531 --> 01:34:59,690
funkhouser was going to tell you about 
deja vu.

1975
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,530
how crazy is that?
Get them on your podcast.

1976
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:04,970
He says,
have that guy on.

1977
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:06,710
I know he will.
He lives in Switzerland.

1978
01:35:06,711 --> 01:35:07,640
Maybe I can.
Yeah,

1979
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:08,990
we won them over there.

1980
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:13,310
He asserts that in order to better study
the phenomenon,

1981
01:35:13,311 --> 01:35:16,100
the nuances between the experiences need
to be noted.

1982
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:20,690
The examples mentioned above.
funkhouser would describe the first.

1983
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,130
Oh,
so there's a bunch of.

1984
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,430
Okay.
They believe there are several different

1985
01:35:25,431 --> 01:35:28,920
deja experiences.
There's deja visit tei,

1986
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:33,180
which means already visited.
There's deja vec who,

1987
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:35,060
ecu.
I don't know if I'm saying it right,

1988
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:40,270
already experienced or lived through as 
much as 70 percent of the population 

1989
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:42,370
reports.
Having experienced some form of deja vu.

1990
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:47,480
A higher number of incidents occur and 
people 15 to 25 years of age.

1991
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,870
Huh?
That's bizarre.

1992
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:56,140
It's been firmly associated with 
temporal lobe epilepsy.

1993
01:35:57,350 --> 01:36:02,350
Reportedly,
deja vu can occur just prior to a 

1994
01:36:02,350 --> 01:36:05,260
temporal lobe seizure,
so it doesn't mean that it's exclusively

1995
01:36:05,901 --> 01:36:10,130
connected to temporal lobe epilepsy,
but that it's connected to to.

1996
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:15,131
I mean,
for some people have temporal lobe 

1997
01:36:15,131 --> 01:36:15,131
epilepsy,
they experienced age.

1998
01:36:15,131 --> 01:36:17,320
I will not necessarily the other way.
Just because you have deja vu,

1999
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:18,950
it doesn't mean.
I think that's what they're saying.

2000
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:20,480
Well,
what the fuck dude?

2001
01:36:20,690 --> 01:36:23,120
So they don't really know.
Not as romantic when people go.

2002
01:36:23,121 --> 01:36:25,850
I just feel like we've been here before 
together.

2003
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:27,800
It's instead of night,
go ahead.

2004
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:32,120
Kind of feels like a temporal lobe.
I think our software is just bugged.

2005
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:32,920
Yeah.

2006
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:37,300
I always associated with,
um,

2007
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:40,040
with,
with simulation theory,

2008
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:41,290
like,
uh,

2009
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,190
the idea.
First of all,

2010
01:36:43,191 --> 01:36:44,990
just the idea that you could have 
dreams,

2011
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:46,100
you know,
you can have dreams.

2012
01:36:46,101 --> 01:36:51,101
Like I wrote about this dream.
I'm an instagram because I was in vegas 

2013
01:36:51,101 --> 01:36:53,780
and I passed by this thing and they had 
this wall,

2014
01:36:53,781 --> 01:36:58,781
this hotel,
and they would write down famous quotes 

2015
01:36:58,781 --> 01:36:58,781
everyday on the wall and one of them 
said,

2016
01:36:58,781 --> 01:37:00,110
if you can dream it,
you can do it.

2017
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:01,250
Well,
I went to sleep.

2018
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:06,260
I took four alpha brain that day kind.
I went to sleep and I had this dream of 

2019
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:11,120
a sex dream with mermaids.
So I put it on my instagram.

2020
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:15,200
I had a dream that I could breathe 
underwater and I dove into the ocean and

2021
01:37:15,201 --> 01:37:17,150
found a civilization of beautiful 
mermaids.

2022
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:21,080
They all sang gloria songs and 
surrounded me with loving hugs.

2023
01:37:21,230 --> 01:37:26,230
One of them reached into my pants and 
start jerking me off under the day long 

2024
01:37:27,711 --> 01:37:31,250
continuous streams of beautiful flowers 
came out of my dick and filled the water

2025
01:37:31,251 --> 01:37:32,630
around us,
and then I wrote,

2026
01:37:32,631 --> 01:37:37,631
so yeah,
walt disney didn't know what the fuck 

2027
01:37:37,631 --> 01:37:37,631
you're talking about it.

2028
01:37:37,631 --> 01:37:38,030
It's like those dreams.
That's a real dream.

2029
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,730
Just think about that dream like that 
was a very realistic,

2030
01:37:40,731 --> 01:37:43,040
vivid dream,
a dream like that.

2031
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:46,100
What is what's going on there?
Okay.

2032
01:37:46,101 --> 01:37:51,101
Obviously it's not really happening,
but when you're having a really vivid 

2033
01:37:51,101 --> 01:37:53,150
dream that's completely ridiculous,
like you're in a fucking avatar dragon.

2034
01:37:53,151 --> 01:37:56,370
You're flying around while that's 
happening,

2035
01:37:56,410 --> 01:37:57,310
you're,
you're,

2036
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,830
you're essentially thinks,
yeah.

2037
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:01,140
While you.
While it's.

2038
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:06,141
I mean,
it just shows you how slippery regular 

2039
01:38:06,141 --> 01:38:09,231
reality really is.
If you can have these experiences that 

2040
01:38:09,231 --> 01:38:09,750
are totally ridiculous,
but yet while they're happening,

2041
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:11,340
you buy them.
You know you,

2042
01:38:11,341 --> 01:38:16,341
you buy that.
You and your friend really are running 

2043
01:38:16,341 --> 01:38:18,981
away from godzilla.
God's oh really is coming and the whole 

2044
01:38:18,981 --> 01:38:22,581
city knows and you're running into 
people that you knew from high school 

2045
01:38:22,581 --> 01:38:22,581
and you're saying sorry,
and you know dudes,

2046
01:38:22,581 --> 01:38:23,580
you got in fights with your hugging 
them.

2047
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:28,580
We're all Together on this now we're 
going to get the fuck away from 

2048
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:30,711
godzilla.
And then you hear and you hear that 

2049
01:38:30,711 --> 01:38:31,080
fucking thing coming over the hill.
You,

2050
01:38:31,081 --> 01:38:32,310
you're there,
you're there.

2051
01:38:32,311 --> 01:38:33,630
And then you wake up and you gotta pay,
you know,

2052
01:38:33,631 --> 01:38:37,350
like what the fuck is wrong with me?
I really thought god godzilla's is real.

2053
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:40,200
I had my,
I don't,

2054
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:45,260
I'm not stressed about anything but I 
had my reoccurring dream that I've had 

2055
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:49,581
since I was like a little kid.
It was basically somebody shows up at my

2056
01:38:50,431 --> 01:38:55,431
window suddenly like a appear in the 
window like that and I start running 

2057
01:38:55,431 --> 01:38:59,601
from him.
So I'll run up the stairs and then 

2058
01:38:59,601 --> 01:39:01,461
there'll be a ceiling panel and then 
I'll push it and then I'll pull myself 

2059
01:39:01,461 --> 01:39:04,941
up and then I'm in like an attic and 
then I'll run and there'll be another 

2060
01:39:04,941 --> 01:39:04,941
little door and I'll slide that.

2061
01:39:04,941 --> 01:39:08,820
So I'm consTantly running from somebody 
who's below,

2062
01:39:08,821 --> 01:39:13,821
but I have all these secret passages.
Then I was watching the discovery 

2063
01:39:13,821 --> 01:39:14,070
channel and they had a thing about 
ninjas.

2064
01:39:15,110 --> 01:39:17,640
This ninja house.
This guy got out,

2065
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:20,790
he would move a sliding panel and he 
went through and I go,

2066
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:22,710
that's it.
That's why I enjoy fighting.

2067
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:24,930
That's why I'm having this dream.
I was in ninja.

2068
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:30,170
Not kidding you.
The thing they showed in thing was the 

2069
01:39:30,170 --> 01:39:33,681
exact dream that I've had.
I think that that happens in almost 

2070
01:39:33,681 --> 01:39:36,990
every ninja movie.
I know you've seen ninja movies.

2071
01:39:36,991 --> 01:39:40,410
that is a much better explanation than 
you used to be.

2072
01:39:40,411 --> 01:39:43,230
A japanese dude back in the days where 
there really were ninjas.

2073
01:39:43,410 --> 01:39:45,420
That seems like a bunch of generations 
ago,

2074
01:39:45,421 --> 01:39:46,770
man.
What happened last life?

2075
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:52,220
You know?
How come you remember that shit was 

2076
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:52,220
probably what?
The forties.

2077
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:52,440
It was kind of boring.

2078
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:58,550
I think they have a photo.
There's a photo that was just going 

2079
01:39:58,550 --> 01:39:58,550
around recently.
Brian,

2080
01:39:58,550 --> 01:40:02,210
see if you can pull this up.
It's the last known photo of a samurai 

2081
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:04,530
and actual samurai before they somehow 
or another,

2082
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:06,600
the culture was abolished.
I don't know how they did that.

2083
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:11,650
I mean they made it illegal to walk 
around with swords or I don't know what 

2084
01:40:11,650 --> 01:40:11,650
they did,
but this is a.

2085
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:16,660
I think photographS were discovered or 
were figured out in the late 18 

2086
01:40:17,461 --> 01:40:18,480
hundreds,
I believe.

2087
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:19,620
Right?
was that right?

2088
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:24,480
Does that make sense?
So this guy existed with swords.

2089
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:29,740
You know,
I'm walking around with a sword in the 

2090
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:31,281
18 hundreds.
I'm pretty sure this is the google 

2091
01:40:31,281 --> 01:40:32,390
episode john had put them on.
I'm wondering,

2092
01:40:32,391 --> 01:40:35,230
you're dumber guests so I can't drop a 
lot of those.

2093
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:37,710
So not true.
That's not the photo that I saw,

2094
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:40,470
but it might be another one that's 
similar.

2095
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:45,470
This last known photo of a samurai.
See if you google that will look at 

2096
01:40:45,470 --> 01:40:45,470
that.
Dude,

2097
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:51,950
that's what I googled.
You ever see those ninja classes like 

2098
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:55,690
that ain't the one I saw,
but it's still pretty dope in martial 

2099
01:40:55,690 --> 01:40:56,410
arts,
like magazines or even online.

2100
01:40:56,411 --> 01:40:58,480
There's like guys that teach you how to 
be a ninja.

2101
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:04,920
They teach you how to send you a ninja 
black belt and then you have to promise 

2102
01:41:05,441 --> 01:41:06,910
you're going to watch the videos.
I'm serious.

2103
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:12,040
I saw like a native american martial 
art,

2104
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:14,260
it was like indian martial art,
but that's what the guy did.

2105
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:19,500
Oh yeah.
He sent you a black belt and then just 

2106
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:19,500
through the honor system in to watch the
dvds.

2107
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:23,940
That's so.
Well that's just people trying to make 

2108
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:25,711
money.
That's the one thing about martial arts 

2109
01:41:25,711 --> 01:41:25,711
is a.
You can.

2110
01:41:25,711 --> 01:41:28,840
You can definitely learn some things 
from a dvd as long as you get one on one

2111
01:41:28,841 --> 01:41:29,780
instruction as well.

2112
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:32,850
Like the originally get one on one 
instruction like it.

2113
01:41:32,851 --> 01:41:36,160
It's way quicker path.
If you have someone showing you where to

2114
01:41:36,161 --> 01:41:37,740
put your weight,
especially jujitsu,

2115
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:39,790
right.
It's hard to see what's going on.

2116
01:41:39,791 --> 01:41:44,791
like if you're watching the guys strike 
like you're seeing things in real life 

2117
01:41:44,791 --> 01:41:46,480
like you're seeing.
Whereas his chin is his placement.

2118
01:41:46,481 --> 01:41:51,481
It seems like there's less variables,
but when you're seeing jujitsu like you 

2119
01:41:51,481 --> 01:41:55,420
don't know understand like where he's 
his holding his balance and and how he,

2120
01:41:55,870 --> 01:41:59,260
how he passes the garden a certain way.
There's so many different things that go

2121
01:41:59,261 --> 01:42:04,261
along with like setting up a submission 
has all these steps along the way that 

2122
01:42:04,261 --> 01:42:08,071
are super critical because you've got to
know the defense of those steps and you 

2123
01:42:08,071 --> 01:42:11,161
got to know the counter to that defense 
and you've got to have two different 

2124
01:42:11,161 --> 01:42:11,161
paths out of there.
You can't just have one.

2125
01:42:11,161 --> 01:42:14,890
So like while you're teaching someone 
like a jujitsu,

2126
01:42:14,891 --> 01:42:17,980
like a setup for a submission,
you're also teaching them the defense of

2127
01:42:17,981 --> 01:42:22,981
that submission and you're also teaching
them like usually you're teaching them 

2128
01:42:22,981 --> 01:42:24,060
what the counter is,
you know,

2129
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:25,820
especially if they're like bluebell,
bluebell,

2130
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:26,740
leverage,
something like that.

2131
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:29,920
So there's just so many lIke to teach 
that with a dvd,

2132
01:42:29,921 --> 01:42:34,921
it's so hard to do.
You can kind of teach basics like real 

2133
01:42:34,921 --> 01:42:35,680
simple stuff and if you paid really 
close attention,

2134
01:42:35,681 --> 01:42:37,930
you can kind of learn that,
but way harder.

2135
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:40,900
it's way better to have somebody move 
you like show you like here,

2136
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:42,850
like not turn it like there and you're 
like,

2137
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:47,900
ooh.
Because it was like some like subtle 

2138
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:47,900
variations just in the way you hold a 
choke,

2139
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,540
right?
Because this guy who one in Brazil,

2140
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:51,520
one of the last,
uh,

2141
01:42:51,610 --> 01:42:52,480
cars that we did.
No,

2142
01:42:52,481 --> 01:42:52,800
no,
no.

2143
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:57,820
Mexico city.
He caught this dude in a good team and 

2144
01:42:57,820 --> 01:42:58,360
he did this new thing that a lot of guys
are doing called the pretzel grip.

2145
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:03,560
And like,
if someone doesn't show you how to do 

2146
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:03,560
that grip,
it seems.

2147
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:04,060
It seems real weird.
Cavan mimic you doing that.

2148
01:43:04,061 --> 01:43:06,160
Yeah.
My friend was watching you on video.

2149
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:09,640
My friend denny showed it to me,
but it seems goofy as hell,

2150
01:43:09,641 --> 01:43:11,800
but when you actually do it,
it really works.

2151
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:16,920
It's awesome.
It's like this crazy new grip that guys 

2152
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:19,371
are doing.
That's one of those things like 

2153
01:43:19,371 --> 01:43:19,371
someone's gotta like put your hands 
there.

2154
01:43:19,371 --> 01:43:19,930
You got to show it to you.
You got it done to you.

2155
01:43:19,931 --> 01:43:20,980
Yeah,
exactly.

2156
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:26,040
Exactly.
Getting it done to you is another big 

2157
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:28,111
one.
I've always been kind of like a workout 

2158
01:43:28,111 --> 01:43:29,260
equipment or video whore.
I'm not so much lately,

2159
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,820
but I would buy a lot of stuff.
And uh,

2160
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:35,290
this was years ago,
I actually bought a,

2161
01:43:35,291 --> 01:43:39,460
it was a russian martial arts video of 
how to fight and water.

2162
01:43:40,330 --> 01:43:41,740
I'm not kidding.
Whoa.

2163
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:42,310
Yeah.
Oh,

2164
01:43:42,311 --> 01:43:47,311
you told me about this.
we actually talked about it on the 

2165
01:43:47,311 --> 01:43:47,311
podcast,
I believe way back in the day.

2166
01:43:47,311 --> 01:43:47,311
oh,
good.

2167
01:43:47,311 --> 01:43:48,610
Mike,
I know you've told me this story though,

2168
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:52,030
how to fight in a shallow pool and then 
like

2169
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,380
there's different techniques.
If you're treading water,

2170
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,700
look at this.
This is a photo of a japanese dude about

2171
01:43:58,701 --> 01:44:03,701
to commit a ritual suicide.
Are that wonderfest real?

2172
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:07,610
I want to pretend it's real,
so I don't want to even research it.

2173
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:13,060
Find out if it's not real,
but this is all these different photos 

2174
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:15,440
from samurais 19th century.
So the 18 sixties,

2175
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,220
the photos were taken in the late 18 
sixties.

2176
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:23,210
Literally those guys.
Well,

2177
01:44:23,211 --> 01:44:25,070
they weren't very tall.
You know what I mean?

2178
01:44:25,071 --> 01:44:26,990
Japanese folks back then.
Especially.

2179
01:44:26,991 --> 01:44:28,970
Is that guy doing it to himself or is 
that a movie?

2180
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:31,250
It looks like a movie,
but supposedly through.

2181
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:34,060
Oh boy,
this chick was the same.

2182
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:34,850
Right?
That's pretty hot.

2183
01:44:34,970 --> 01:44:36,710
I bet they did take photos.
Oh,

2184
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:39,620
that chick samurais damn powerful chick,
samara.

2185
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:43,940
I bet they did take photos of them 
killing themselves.

2186
01:44:46,590 --> 01:44:48,020
Oh dude,
this one though.

2187
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:50,790
This guy's bleeding and this one,
look at this.

2188
01:44:50,791 --> 01:44:52,140
This guy's fucking bleeding,
man.

2189
01:44:52,141 --> 01:44:54,310
He's actually doing it.
She's,

2190
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:58,470
oh,
two data is dark.

2191
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:05,020
So there's a photo of them sitting 
around while this guy actually kills 

2192
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:05,070
himself and the blood's coming out of 
his,

2193
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:09,310
uh,
the top of his kimono and down into it's

2194
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:13,040
like leaking down into his crotch area.
You see it and I'm still looking for it.

2195
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:14,570
There's a lot of photos.
Yeah.

2196
01:45:14,571 --> 01:45:17,360
Go to the daily mail article.
Just it says,

2197
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:22,600
end of the samurai stunning portraits of
japan's warrior class just ended the 

2198
01:45:22,881 --> 01:45:27,881
samurai daily mail have ever taken a 
martial arts weapons training stuff.

2199
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:32,090
No,
I think we burned like on paper.

2200
01:45:32,091 --> 01:45:37,091
It's not like.
It seems like it'd be cool like David 

2201
01:45:37,091 --> 01:45:37,091
Lee roth does the samurai swords.
Yeah,

2202
01:45:37,091 --> 01:45:38,000
that will be awesome.
And then you scroll down,

2203
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:39,680
scroll down to one there,
right there.

2204
01:45:40,330 --> 01:45:45,330
That guy's killing himself.
We're hugging and they're all sitting 

2205
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:46,640
around just chilling.
It doesn't seem real.

2206
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,940
Teenagers might not be posed like it's 
like,

2207
01:45:49,941 --> 01:45:50,740
look at us,
we're,

2208
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:52,340
but it might be real.

2209
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:57,910
You know what I mean?
When you're dealing with someone that's 

2210
01:45:57,910 --> 01:45:59,870
going to do a ritual suicide,
like the kind of willpower and then they

2211
01:45:59,871 --> 01:46:04,871
had to be as gangster as possible when 
that guy is stabbing himself in the 

2212
01:46:05,691 --> 01:46:10,400
stomach and cutting his guts open with a
sword,

2213
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:15,730
it's probably.
That can be a real picture because it's 

2214
01:46:15,730 --> 01:46:16,210
probably colorized whoever,
colored eggs,

2215
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:16,600
like,
you know what?

2216
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:17,890
Add this little.
Yeah.

2217
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:20,160
Well I think that the whole photos got 
to be colorized,

2218
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:24,140
but they didn't have photos back then.
So this is all colorized.

2219
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:24,880
The,
uh,

2220
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:28,300
the photos that are black and white.
I kind of prefer a test.

2221
01:46:28,370 --> 01:46:31,100
I don't want to.
A shirley temple fakeness.

2222
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:32,510
Yeah.
I don't want to see that,

2223
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:37,680
that fake color.
I'd rather see a black and white and 

2224
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:40,310
know that that's what it looked like to 
the person that was holding that camera,

2225
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:42,980
that made that photograph and then 
developed it.

2226
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:49,060
It's really amazing when you think about
the fact that everything past like the 

2227
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:49,650
18 hundreds,
whenever it was,

2228
01:46:49,651 --> 01:46:50,280
when they invented

2229
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:53,190
cameras,
everything past that is accelerated.

2230
01:46:53,191 --> 01:46:56,150
Like our visual understanding of the 
world is accelerated in a,

2231
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:59,100
in a way that we don't really think 
about that much.

2232
01:46:59,101 --> 01:47:02,190
Like no one knew what the fuck africa 
looked like back then.

2233
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:06,300
Like if you were,
if you were living in Wyoming in 18,

2234
01:47:06,310 --> 01:47:11,310
20,
you have no idea what africa looked 

2235
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:11,310
like.
You had no idea.

2236
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:13,080
No it United States look like somebody 
tried to tell you.

2237
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:16,020
Somebody trying to tell you about the 
animals that were over in africa.

2238
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:18,360
They might as well be talking about like
people that live on the moon,

2239
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:23,880
what?
There's black people and there's other 

2240
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:23,880
plane and elephant.
Yeah.

2241
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:26,700
You know,
they didn't even know gorillas were real

2242
01:47:26,850 --> 01:47:28,890
until the beginning of the 19th or the 
20th century.

2243
01:47:28,891 --> 01:47:29,730
The 19 hundreds.

2244
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:35,880
No,
they didn't go marry.

2245
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:40,940
Well,
they were in the jungle and then like 

2246
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:40,940
one or two dudes that african people 
knew they were real.

2247
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:45,680
But I mean when we,
I mean us goofy white people to black 

2248
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:45,680
people.
We didn't know him.

2249
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,340
Yeah,
yeah,

2250
01:47:48,630 --> 01:47:50,160
yeah.
The discovery of the gorilla.

2251
01:47:50,161 --> 01:47:52,170
I'm pretty sure it was the early 19 
hundreds.

2252
01:47:52,171 --> 01:47:57,171
Hold on a second.
This is the google show gorilla.

2253
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:00,810
Great babe.
Okay.

2254
01:48:00,811 --> 01:48:04,060
Discovery of the gorilla.
Uh,

2255
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:05,370
they had to have known before.
Right?

2256
01:48:05,371 --> 01:48:09,420
Because has no to discovered in 19.
Oh,

2257
01:48:09,421 --> 01:48:14,421
two nuts discovered on October 7th,
19.

2258
01:48:15,511 --> 01:48:18,000
Oh,
two on the ridges of the volcanic.

2259
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:21,180
I don't know how to say this.
Virunga mountains by german explorer.

2260
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:26,960
Captain Robert Vaughn,
burying b e r I n g dot the mountain 

2261
01:48:27,241 --> 01:48:32,241
gorilla was named gorilla gorilla.
Been in gay.

2262
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:36,690
In honor of the captain.
Yeah.

2263
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:38,430
How fucking crazy is that?

2264
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:40,850
So weird.
Yeah.

2265
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:45,880
That was a conversation at work,
like the day after that were people are 

2266
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:45,880
like,
hey,

2267
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:48,030
did you see that there's a thing like us
has hair all over it?

2268
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:49,530
Well,
how about those dudes?

2269
01:48:49,531 --> 01:48:52,290
Those explorer dudes from the early 19 
hundreds,

2270
01:48:52,550 --> 01:48:54,190
you know,
that would show up and you know,

2271
01:48:54,210 --> 01:48:57,900
they have like fucking their wives would
be with them and they tried to like make

2272
01:48:57,901 --> 01:48:59,740
camps in the Congo,
you know,

2273
01:48:59,850 --> 01:49:02,790
like that was,
that was the subject of so many movies.

2274
01:49:02,990 --> 01:49:06,330
Like that was the subject of king kong.
Remember this is an explorer.

2275
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:11,750
They brought the actress and they showed
up with his island like and these like 

2276
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:12,900
the ghost in the darkness.
I remember that.

2277
01:49:13,170 --> 01:49:18,170
Yeah,
like the white people and all the black 

2278
01:49:18,170 --> 01:49:20,121
people working for them.
They're making a railroad and africa 

2279
01:49:20,121 --> 01:49:21,870
crazy.
Yeah.

2280
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:24,350
This is a.
They have his,

2281
01:49:24,351 --> 01:49:25,680
uh,
this is pretty cool,

2282
01:49:25,681 --> 01:49:26,010
man.

2283
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:30,240
They have is actual account of like,
of,

2284
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:33,110
of meeting a girl for the first time 
from our campsite,

2285
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:38,120
we were able to watch a herd of big 
black monkeys which tried to climb the 

2286
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:42,801
crest of the volcano.
We succeeded in killing two of these 

2287
01:49:42,801 --> 01:49:45,300
animals and with a rumbling noise,
they tumbled into a ravine which had its

2288
01:49:45,301 --> 01:49:49,900
opening and a north easterly direction.
After five hours of strenuous work,

2289
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,930
we succeeded in retrieving one of these 
animals using a rope.

2290
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:58,500
It was a big human like male monkey of 
one and a half meters in height and a 

2291
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:03,421
weight of over 200 pounds.
His chest had no hair and his hands and 

2292
01:50:03,421 --> 01:50:05,350
feet were of enormous size.
Unfortunately,

2293
01:50:05,351 --> 01:50:08,620
I was unable to determine its type 
because of its size.

2294
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:12,970
It could not very well be a chimpanzee 
or a gorilla.

2295
01:50:12,971 --> 01:50:16,630
So they did know some gorillas.
In any case,

2296
01:50:16,631 --> 01:50:21,631
the presence of gorilla had not been 
established in the area around the 

2297
01:50:21,631 --> 01:50:22,990
lakes,
so they didn't know what it was.

2298
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:25,870
This is so confusing.
Look at the photo brion pull.

2299
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:28,120
Pull that up because it's a crazy 
picture of this.

2300
01:50:28,390 --> 01:50:30,910
These people standing over this dead 
gorilla.

2301
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:34,540
This is one of the first gorilla.
So that's a mountain gorilla.

2302
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:36,100
So,
but he said gorilla.

2303
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:38,800
So that's kinda weird.
So what does that mean?

2304
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:41,710
Like when did they discover the actual 
gorilla?

2305
01:50:41,770 --> 01:50:44,010
So there's other kinds of gorillas other
than mountain gorillas.

2306
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:45,910
Then that's the only thing that makes 
sense to me,

2307
01:50:46,930 --> 01:50:51,400
right?
A physical characteristics,

2308
01:50:51,401 --> 01:50:53,010
discovery,
communications,

2309
01:50:53,011 --> 01:50:54,910
intelligence tool use interaction with 
humans.

2310
01:50:54,911 --> 01:50:55,300
Here we go.

2311
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:02,520
Okay.
Five hundred bc and implore explorer on 

2312
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:06,310
an expedition in the west african coast 
encountered a savage people,

2313
01:51:06,311 --> 01:51:11,311
the greater part of whom were women 
whose bodies were harry and who are 

2314
01:51:11,311 --> 01:51:11,920
interpreters,
called gorilla.

2315
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:15,340
The word was then later used as a 
species name.

2316
01:51:15,341 --> 01:51:20,341
And although it's unknown whether these 
ancient carthy gains encountered were 

2317
01:51:20,741 --> 01:51:25,741
truly gorillas,
another species of apes or monkeys or 

2318
01:51:25,741 --> 01:51:25,741
even humans.
Wow.

2319
01:51:25,741 --> 01:51:30,330
Okay.
So that was the first account of 

2320
01:51:30,330 --> 01:51:30,330
gorillas.
It's written down.

2321
01:51:30,330 --> 01:51:33,960
That was 500 years before christ.
So the first westerner to see a live 

2322
01:51:34,541 --> 01:51:39,541
gorilla was in 1856.
He brought dead specimens to the uk in 

2323
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:42,160
18,
61.

2324
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:47,920
The first systematic study was not 
conducted until the 19 twenties.

2325
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:53,070
So yeah,
I mean they kind of knew about gorillas 

2326
01:51:53,070 --> 01:51:53,070
back then that it seems like it wasn't.
Look at that thing.

2327
01:51:53,070 --> 01:51:55,090
Isn't that weird?
Fake god,

2328
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:56,500
that face looks fake.
Yeah.

2329
01:51:56,501 --> 01:51:58,810
But they couldn't do fake back then to 
fake that.

2330
01:51:58,811 --> 01:52:00,280
They had actually looks pretty real 
dude,

2331
01:52:00,281 --> 01:52:02,980
if you will look at that face that face,
like get close up on it.

2332
01:52:03,070 --> 01:52:06,280
Like that thing that's a dead monkey.
But those mountain gorillas,

2333
01:52:06,281 --> 01:52:07,900
they have those chest plates,
you know,

2334
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:14,160
plus you gotta,
you gotta realize that's like the worst 

2335
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:16,681
cell phone picture ever know.
That's what like the best pictures were 

2336
01:52:16,681 --> 01:52:17,980
back then.
The best pictures.

2337
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:19,270
I mean this is 18,
what?

2338
01:52:19,271 --> 01:52:20,440
It was at 18,
60.

2339
01:52:20,441 --> 01:52:21,250
What?
Yeah,

2340
01:52:21,251 --> 01:52:24,440
the dude had to set up that thing that 
they didn't have flashback.

2341
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:27,300
Now he's in 19,
19.

2342
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:27,980
Oh,
two nine.

2343
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:28,960
Oh,
that's the 19.

2344
01:52:28,961 --> 01:52:29,620
Oh,
two picture.

2345
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:32,260
Fuck man.
Yeah,

2346
01:52:32,261 --> 01:52:37,261
so that's the mountain gorilla.
So I guess like they had some different 

2347
01:52:37,261 --> 01:52:39,850
species of gorillas,
but it wasn't really until the 1800 that

2348
01:52:40,210 --> 01:52:42,490
us white people started figuring out 
that they were even real.

2349
01:52:43,050 --> 01:52:46,130
I think the first thing he does when he 
sees him as he tries to kill him,

2350
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:49,190
I know felt like the first like,
oh,

2351
01:52:49,191 --> 01:52:50,400
what's this?
I kill it.

2352
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:51,860
Don't you think that's what happened?
If,

2353
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:55,130
if aliens landed here,
I do think we shoot first.

2354
01:52:55,131 --> 01:52:55,820
They'll be like,
hey,

2355
01:52:55,821 --> 01:53:00,821
that's just what they.
Are there certain people that would 

2356
01:53:00,821 --> 01:53:00,821
definitely shoot for.
Yeah,

2357
01:53:00,821 --> 01:53:00,920
there's,
there's people out there,

2358
01:53:00,921 --> 01:53:05,921
man.
Like it goes back to what we're saying 

2359
01:53:05,921 --> 01:53:05,921
about cops.
Like there's some cops,

2360
01:53:05,921 --> 01:53:07,120
they're just getting out of the car 
shooting right there.

2361
01:53:07,130 --> 01:53:08,300
They're looking to shoot.
Right.

2362
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:13,840
And I think there's probably like some 
human beings that have aliens showed up,

2363
01:53:13,911 --> 01:53:14,690
would do the same thing.

2364
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:16,670
They would see the alien and they just 
start shooting.

2365
01:53:16,910 --> 01:53:21,910
They wouldn't even think about if they 
had a gun on them and they were worried 

2366
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:21,910
about their life off the alien.
Went like put,

2367
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:24,840
put his hand out,
you know,

2368
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:29,880
you,
you'd weird out if it was trying to 

2369
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:29,880
communicate with you,
like the,

2370
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:33,450
you would have to be so vulnerable to 
like allow an alien close enough to you 

2371
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:35,090
to communicate with it.
You'd have to assume that it's not going

2372
01:53:35,091 --> 01:53:36,440
to eat you.
Like,

2373
01:53:36,441 --> 01:53:37,990
how would you know?
Like,

2374
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,760
could you imagine how stupid you would 
feel if you came up to an alien?

2375
01:53:40,761 --> 01:53:41,690
You're like,
hello friend.

2376
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:45,210
And it's like throws a net on your 
cinches it uptight,

2377
01:53:45,570 --> 01:53:49,210
holds you up and take some selfies.
Yeah.

2378
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:51,360
Fucking throws you in the back of its 
spaceship.

2379
01:53:51,361 --> 01:53:52,460
And you'd be like,
fuck,

2380
01:53:52,461 --> 01:53:54,110
I should have shot him.
You know?

2381
01:53:54,111 --> 01:53:56,150
So who knows,
if they're like us,

2382
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:57,520
maybe we should fucking shoot them.

2383
01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:03,350
They're.
Or maybe that brain thing where you can.

2384
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:04,730
Your thoughts.
Good thing.

2385
01:54:04,731 --> 01:54:08,220
Maybe that's the piece of eQuipment we 
need to actually talk to them.

2386
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:12,260
Did you see a europa report is pretty 
interesting.

2387
01:54:12,590 --> 01:54:13,840
Uh,
it's um,

2388
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:19,270
it's a movie about these people.
It was a scifi movie about theSe people 

2389
01:54:19,270 --> 01:54:23,801
that go to europa.
Europa is one of jupiter's moons And it 

2390
01:54:23,801 --> 01:54:26,900
apparently has water on it.
I think it's jupiter's moon,

2391
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:28,280
right?
So julie's mom.

2392
01:54:29,150 --> 01:54:32,300
apparently it's frozen solid.
It's a ball of ice.

2393
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:35,750
And under the surface there's cracks on 
the surface.

2394
01:54:35,751 --> 01:54:38,330
It indicate there's some sort of flowing
water underneath.

2395
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:41,060
And so they,
they're trying to,

2396
01:54:41,061 --> 01:54:42,740
in this movie,
they go there.

2397
01:54:42,741 --> 01:54:47,741
I don't want to spoiler alert for 
anybody but they go there and have 

2398
01:54:47,741 --> 01:54:48,290
encounters.
But the way,

2399
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:49,550
uh,
it,

2400
01:54:49,670 --> 01:54:51,800
like,
you think about like someone coming from

2401
01:54:51,801 --> 01:54:53,600
another planet and landing on your 
fucking planet,

2402
01:54:53,810 --> 01:54:56,960
you're going to automatically assume 
they're hostile is fuck yeah.

2403
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:59,290
Like you're going to automatically.
Yeah,

2404
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:01,550
yeah.
Aliens are dead.

2405
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:07,120
They're dead or were dead.
That word that one of the other figure 

2406
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:07,730
there knows,
maybe they dIdn't.

2407
01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:11,300
Maybe they have really low testosterone.
Maybe they breed.

2408
01:55:11,390 --> 01:55:16,390
How about this?
What if aliens evolve to breed with no 

2409
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:19,541
sex?
So there's no competition for breeding 

2410
01:55:19,541 --> 01:55:21,310
and the competition is all about 
surviving against their elements and the

2411
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:23,600
predators and their area.
So they don't have,

2412
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:26,720
they don't have like this,
this male conquer thing like we do.

2413
01:55:26,721 --> 01:55:29,890
they're all androgynous.
That's why they don't have decks.

2414
01:55:29,990 --> 01:55:31,880
They don't have a giant,
they don't have big titties.

2415
01:55:31,940 --> 01:55:35,840
No aliens don't have beauty videos.
There's no twerking in the alien world.

2416
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:37,850
They don't care about sex.
It doesn't mean anything.

2417
01:55:37,970 --> 01:55:41,870
The number one thing to us is sex.
It's like we need.

2418
01:55:41,871 --> 01:55:46,871
We have this crazy desire to procreate.
We have this crazy desire to be with 

2419
01:55:46,871 --> 01:55:48,600
other people of the opposite or in some 
cases the same sex.

2420
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:52,110
It's a big factor for why people become 
successful.

2421
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:57,290
It's a big factor for why people sell 
items that use beautiful women to sell 

2422
01:55:57,290 --> 01:56:01,461
things and dudes with fucking six packs 
of cell genes and jimmy dean sausage 

2423
01:56:01,531 --> 01:56:02,760
isn't shit.
You know,

2424
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:06,210
that's just a reality of being a human 
being.

2425
01:56:06,211 --> 01:56:11,211
So it's really hard for us to separate 
that idea from living organisms.

2426
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:14,880
But like there's a lot of organisms that
don't have sex at all.

2427
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:16,970
You know,
there's plants and some,

2428
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:20,310
some fucking slugs and shit.
I guess they fucked,

2429
01:56:20,311 --> 01:56:22,200
but there they are,
the male and the female.

2430
01:56:22,201 --> 01:56:23,170
The male could fuck them.
They,

2431
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:28,310
they're both like,
I think a slug is like one of those 

2432
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:28,380
things is by its bisexual in a weird 
way,

2433
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:33,480
not like you're in the chicks,
but the way you have both sexes.

2434
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:35,360
They're hermaphrodites.
I got it.

2435
01:56:35,361 --> 01:56:37,620
Yeah,
and I mean we could have.

2436
01:56:37,650 --> 01:56:42,650
that could easily be the case with some 
being from another planet and if that's 

2437
01:56:42,650 --> 01:56:43,980
the case,
they might not understand aggression.

2438
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:47,790
They might not understand how locked out
we are and then they just show up.

2439
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,400
You know,
like if the aliens land and they show up

2440
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:54,780
very hippyish were just,
they might not understand violence.

2441
01:56:54,930 --> 01:56:59,930
They might have somehow another grown up
in this goldilocks zone that's like way 

2442
01:56:59,930 --> 01:57:01,890
better than our goldilocks zone where 
there's no predators.

2443
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:07,070
Everyone eats plants.
All procreation is all procreation is 

2444
01:57:08,701 --> 01:57:13,701
done through like this mutual experience
of the entire tribe gets together and 

2445
01:57:13,701 --> 01:57:17,781
has,
has babies together and that there's no 

2446
01:57:17,781 --> 01:57:17,781
sex involved and it's all just 
community,

2447
01:57:17,781 --> 01:57:22,010
friendship and love.
And then a child is born out of that 

2448
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:22,010
love.
That's just as look.

2449
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:26,840
How weird is it?
You shoot a load in someone's pussy and 

2450
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:26,840
that's what makes a person that's 
fucking ridiculous.

2451
01:57:27,410 --> 01:57:32,410
IT's so ridiculous.
It's not just as ridiculous to think of 

2452
01:57:32,410 --> 01:57:33,480
a community of evolved beings and all 
get together and hug,

2453
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:35,220
you know,
and then out of that hug,

2454
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:37,770
a tiny child appears and they all care 
for it together.

2455
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:39,950
That's just as possible.
And then they get lost,

2456
01:57:39,951 --> 01:57:43,620
show up on earth and we waste them 
within 15 minutes.

2457
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:44,910
Crazy.
Craziest pollen.

2458
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:50,120
how crazy is the fact that plants need 
bees to take pollen and pollinate their 

2459
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:50,860
fucking plants?
You know,

2460
01:57:50,990 --> 01:57:55,990
polly take flowers and distribute like 
literally genetic material from those 

2461
01:57:56,461 --> 01:57:59,760
plants distributed all around.
If that's a part of the whole ecosystem.

2462
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:04,940
You have these bees that are responsible
for these plants growing and if these 

2463
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:05,970
bees die off,
everybody's freaking out.

2464
01:58:05,971 --> 01:58:08,610
Like what kind of lose the bees were 
gonna lose society.

2465
01:58:08,611 --> 01:58:10,290
People are going to starve.
Like what?

2466
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:12,660
Hold on.
we got workers.

2467
01:58:12,661 --> 01:58:15,420
We got these little worker bees that 
they work for us.

2468
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:18,440
We don't even know about It.
Like we need them to feel like they're.

2469
01:58:18,730 --> 01:58:22,310
They're important for almonds.
Like what would be the other day,

2470
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:25,560
I didn't feel mother fucker,
you terrible person,

2471
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:28,920
terrible person,
but think about that.

2472
01:58:28,921 --> 01:58:33,360
That's an actual reality of nature is 
that bees pollinate plants.

2473
01:58:33,361 --> 01:58:35,520
It's a reality of nature.
It's so bizarre,

2474
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:38,970
but it's responsible for like the 
progression of plant life.

2475
01:58:38,971 --> 01:58:40,890
That's like a big part of how it goes 
down.

2476
01:58:41,470 --> 01:58:46,470
Like I think there could be an infinite 
number of different styles of life out 

2477
01:58:46,781 --> 01:58:51,781
there in the universe.
And that's one of the things is europa 

2478
01:58:51,781 --> 01:58:51,781
report thing was about,
wasn't the best movie,

2479
01:58:51,781 --> 01:58:54,670
but it held my attention.
It was interesting and it was about like

2480
01:58:55,750 --> 01:59:00,750
an alternative type of life that could 
exist on a predictive aliens land.

2481
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:06,030
It probably began to be skinny.
I would think they would be so slick 

2482
01:59:06,030 --> 01:59:06,700
that they would be right here.
Right now.

2483
01:59:06,701 --> 01:59:07,510
We'd have no idea.

2484
01:59:09,550 --> 01:59:14,550
I think they're hiding in the asians.
There's so many asians in China and 

2485
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:15,640
stuff,
a lot of places to hide.

2486
01:59:15,730 --> 01:59:20,730
Well,
that's because they had a landmass over 

2487
01:59:20,730 --> 01:59:20,730
there.
I think,

2488
01:59:20,730 --> 01:59:24,110
um,
that was one of my more stupid theories 

2489
01:59:24,110 --> 01:59:27,390
when I was into the idea that human 
beings are genetically engineered from 

2490
01:59:27,390 --> 01:59:30,871
aliens.
They took people and they added alien 

2491
01:59:30,871 --> 01:59:34,231
dna to people and that's why we're so 
different from all the other monkeys 

2492
01:59:34,231 --> 01:59:34,231
that exists.
All the other apes.

2493
01:59:34,231 --> 01:59:36,070
My big thing was that like they had like
different,

2494
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:41,460
different levels.
Like they'll put like a little less 

2495
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:41,920
alien,
some people and there'd be like a little

2496
01:59:41,921 --> 01:59:43,540
less,
a little hairier like doing it.

2497
01:59:43,550 --> 01:59:45,760
A lot of back hair with the.
Yeah.

2498
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:48,430
You ever go to the beach and see some.
Some fucking dudes are just.

2499
01:59:48,431 --> 01:59:53,431
Harry is iranian dude.
Get everyday the fucking iron sheik or 

2500
01:59:53,431 --> 01:59:54,190
see an asian guy.

2501
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:55,870
No hair at all.
You know,

2502
01:59:56,370 --> 01:59:59,050
the different,
complete different features.

2503
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:00,010
Smart,
very,

2504
02:00:00,011 --> 02:00:03,070
very little body hair.
Notoriously good at mathematics.

2505
02:00:04,210 --> 02:00:06,430
That was my stupid theory that they were
more alien.

2506
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:09,090
So dumb.
I,

2507
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:10,120
I'm,
I'm forward.

2508
02:00:10,121 --> 02:00:12,520
So you know who's for it?
Dennis mckenna.

2509
02:00:12,630 --> 02:00:15,280
Really?
Dennis mckenna thinks it's very possible

2510
02:00:15,281 --> 02:00:20,281
that some sort of other advanced life 
form has visited earth in the past and 

2511
02:00:20,441 --> 02:00:25,441
subtly or actively re-engineered or 
engineered human beings that they had 

2512
02:00:25,961 --> 02:00:30,961
some hand.
He said it's possible and he bases that 

2513
02:00:30,961 --> 02:00:34,201
on like a bunch of things like what we 
would do if we could do it like if and 

2514
02:00:34,201 --> 02:00:39,141
and the idea that we're a fairly young 
planet lIke earth is only like four and 

2515
02:00:39,791 --> 02:00:44,791
a half billion years old.
So the universe was around for 10 

2516
02:00:44,791 --> 02:00:47,260
billion years before earth was or 
somewhere abouts roughly.

2517
02:00:47,830 --> 02:00:51,220
That's a long time.
If something just had a 100,000

2518
02:00:51,221 --> 02:00:52,660
year headstart,
that's it.

2519
02:00:52,690 --> 02:00:54,520
That's all it needs.
100,000

2520
02:00:54,521 --> 02:00:57,190
year head start from where we are now 
without blowing yourself up.

2521
02:00:57,220 --> 02:01:00,100
Could you even imagine what kind of 
freaky shit we're going to be able to do

2522
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:02,710
and 100,000
years is a blink of an eye.

2523
02:01:02,950 --> 02:01:06,430
So if we could show up,
see if the Congo was a planet instead of

2524
02:01:06,431 --> 02:01:11,431
like the Congo with these guys show up 
and they start lighting these gorillas 

2525
02:01:11,431 --> 02:01:13,831
up.
What if there was a planet and we found 

2526
02:01:13,831 --> 02:01:16,861
this planet and it was all apes.
There was no people and we did like an 

2527
02:01:16,861 --> 02:01:17,800
accurate survey.
The planet like tom cruise style,

2528
02:01:17,801 --> 02:01:20,680
we land in this fucking little white 
outfits.

2529
02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:25,020
We've taken like biological for a guy in
a hot chick,

2530
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:25,750
hot chick,
right?

2531
02:01:25,751 --> 02:01:27,070
And uh,
that he tries to keep me,

2532
02:01:28,530 --> 02:01:31,030
saved her life.
She gets an injury.

2533
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:33,750
I mean,
that's just a scout parties.

2534
02:01:33,751 --> 02:01:35,230
You've got to do your own scale party.

2535
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:36,240
Yeah.
You know,

2536
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:41,280
maybe like you guys scale part of it 
likes to tAke naps and he saw something 

2537
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:42,380
but you didn't,
you file for sure.

2538
02:01:42,410 --> 02:01:43,930
False reports,
travel.

2539
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:49,430
And then there'll be like,
there'll be like a protagonist who's,

2540
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:54,460
who's the,
they would have to be a woman that's 

2541
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:54,460
like a powerful woman,
like sort of balances it out.

2542
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:57,830
Will you guys get that job done?
You're down on planet Congo,

2543
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:03,040
get the job done and get back up here.
And maybe there's like cylons moving in 

2544
02:02:03,230 --> 02:02:05,180
and we got to get back to the planet and
fucking.

2545
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:10,990
But point being,
if we landed on planet Congo and there 

2546
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:13,901
was only monkeys,
if we thought that they were just like 

2547
02:02:13,901 --> 02:02:13,901
the chimpanzees here,
for sure,

2548
02:02:13,901 --> 02:02:15,110
we'd steal a few.
RiGht?

2549
02:02:15,140 --> 02:02:17,210
Fuck yeah.
Are you kidding me?

2550
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:19,880
If they knew that they could land on a 
planet,

2551
02:02:19,881 --> 02:02:22,130
say if they found a planet,
you know,

2552
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:23,720
whatever,
a light year away,

2553
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:25,640
you know,
they figured out how to get somewhere in

2554
02:02:25,641 --> 02:02:30,641
a year and on that plan that they knew 
there was live primates that were 

2555
02:02:30,641 --> 02:02:30,740
exactly like chimps.

2556
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:31,750
they're like,
oh,

2557
02:02:31,770 --> 02:02:32,810
this is what it is,
man.

2558
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:38,200
These animals,
if you Give them enough time at this 

2559
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:38,200
temperature,
this is what you get.

2560
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:39,290
if the temperature's higher,
you get dinosaurs.

2561
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:44,410
If the temperature is lower,
you get woolly mammoths and you know 

2562
02:02:44,410 --> 02:02:45,380
what I mean?
Like what if it's like a universal thing

2563
02:02:45,381 --> 02:02:46,050
in,
in,

2564
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:49,910
in the cosmos said,
all you need is water and carbon and all

2565
02:02:49,911 --> 02:02:52,580
the building blocks and the same life 
forms exist everywhere.

2566
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:57,700
If we find that out and we show up 
someplace and we find monkeys were 

2567
02:02:57,700 --> 02:02:58,580
stealing them.
Yeah,

2568
02:02:58,610 --> 02:03:00,320
for sure.
And we find that we go there,

2569
02:03:00,321 --> 02:03:03,720
there's parrots and anaconda is what 
this is exactly like the rain forest,

2570
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:04,970
and they're like,
exactly,

2571
02:03:04,971 --> 02:03:09,971
exactly.
But pretty sure we'll fucking steal one 

2572
02:03:09,971 --> 02:03:09,971
of those monkeys.
Let's find out.

2573
02:03:09,971 --> 02:03:13,780
So there's the monkeys are the little 
monkey community and monkey school 

2574
02:03:13,780 --> 02:03:15,260
system and teaching each other what 
sounds for anaconda.

2575
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:20,260
What's the sound for,
for eagle that comes to steal you from 

2576
02:03:20,260 --> 02:03:22,961
the trees.
They try to teach and we just go along 

2577
02:03:22,961 --> 02:03:22,961
and go,
oh,

2578
02:03:22,961 --> 02:03:23,390
you're not smart enough for us to care 
about your community.

2579
02:03:23,490 --> 02:03:28,490
And so getting the cage hooker clink,
shut that fucking box.

2580
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:30,150
Push it into our space.
But.

2581
02:03:31,530 --> 02:03:34,700
And for the rest of their lives,
those chimps have to freak out.

2582
02:03:34,701 --> 02:03:37,190
Thinking about the time that this thing 
came,

2583
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:40,590
this metal disk and stole their mommy.
Go.

2584
02:03:41,150 --> 02:03:43,130
Yeah.
Some people wouldn't believe him.

2585
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:45,290
We would do it.
Don't you think of it in a second,

2586
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:48,080
but in a.
Do you think we would do it?

2587
02:03:48,140 --> 02:03:49,100
Yeah.
Yeah,

2588
02:03:49,370 --> 02:03:50,290
right.
If we were,

2589
02:03:50,330 --> 02:03:51,320
we knew,
oh,

2590
02:03:51,321 --> 02:03:53,540
they have bass,
large mouth bass on this lake.

2591
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:54,860
We're steAling some of those bass.

2592
02:03:57,020 --> 02:04:02,020
They'd be like a guy in Texas,
they would have like a special leG you 

2593
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:04,571
have to pay just to catch bass 
motherfucker and portraits of mars bass 

2594
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:09,890
that can totally be real.
Somebody tried to steal my dog out of my

2595
02:04:09,891 --> 02:04:12,410
backyard.
That's just here in America.

2596
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:17,440
Yeah.
so of course we were doing so many 

2597
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:17,440
different.
You catch him?

2598
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:17,440
Yeah.
That was a huge.

2599
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:21,851
Um,
my wife said margaret's gone and my 

2600
02:04:21,851 --> 02:04:23,810
other shepherd wasn't,
which is,

2601
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:25,220
you know,
if you're a person,

2602
02:04:25,221 --> 02:04:26,520
you know,
it's weird that they're.

2603
02:04:26,630 --> 02:04:29,510
Do hooligans always are with each other.
One not going to go.

2604
02:04:29,511 --> 02:04:32,690
I'm not going to leave.
So I was in New York,

2605
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:34,640
thought we lost it.
I'm cutting off too.

2606
02:04:34,641 --> 02:04:36,830
Sorry.
but I thouGht we lost our dog.

2607
02:04:36,831 --> 02:04:37,980
So it's day three

2608
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,080
and I'm just beyond bombed.
I'm like,

2609
02:04:40,081 --> 02:04:42,300
my doG got out and where I live up in 
the hills,

2610
02:04:42,301 --> 02:04:44,280
I'm like coyotes to doug.
She's kind of uh,

2611
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:46,040
so uh,
you know,

2612
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:49,320
she's probably dead.
So then before I go perform,

2613
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:53,300
I just go to craigslist just for,
I just type in craig's list.

2614
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:58,320
Then I go found or lost shepherd.
This ad pops up saying free dog and it's

2615
02:05:01,441 --> 02:05:04,590
a picture of my dog,
a super friendly,

2616
02:05:04,591 --> 02:05:06,900
well trained,
um,

2617
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:08,880
you know,
had a list of all of her things.

2618
02:05:08,881 --> 02:05:10,530
And then a phone number.
Oh my god.

2619
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:12,600
So then I called the guy and go,
hey bud,

2620
02:05:12,601 --> 02:05:13,890
like I'm excited.
Like,

2621
02:05:14,130 --> 02:05:15,230
yes,
you know,

2622
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:17,070
you found my dog.
Thank you.

2623
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:18,810
And the guy goes,
well,

2624
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:20,760
she didn't have a tag on her.
I'm like,

2625
02:05:21,210 --> 02:05:24,690
she always has a tag.
She must've got out and then the tay got

2626
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:29,780
got taken off or her collar,
which is in pot like that doesn't happen

2627
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:32,250
unless she hits a picket fence and rips 
it off.

2628
02:05:32,430 --> 02:05:34,950
So I go,
but you have my dog.

2629
02:05:34,951 --> 02:05:35,850
And he goes,
well,

2630
02:05:35,851 --> 02:05:37,920
it doesn't have a tag,
so I don't know if it's your dog.

2631
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:39,750
And I go,
it is my dog.

2632
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:44,190
And then I even sent the guy a picture 
of her that you would match up and go,

2633
02:05:44,191 --> 02:05:46,410
those are my dogs.
And then the guy says,

2634
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:52,120
uh,
well In a dog owner that lets their dog 

2635
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:56,001
get out,
probably doesn't deserve to have that 

2636
02:05:56,001 --> 02:05:56,001
dog.
So now I'm like,

2637
02:05:56,001 --> 02:05:57,690
motherfucker,
are you not going to give me my dog?

2638
02:05:57,691 --> 02:05:59,340
He goes,
I gave the dog away.

2639
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:04,720
I already,
somebody already called the door thing 

2640
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:05,160
and I go,
you had my had my fucking dog,

2641
02:06:05,161 --> 02:06:08,280
do we do,
can I have the number to the person that

2642
02:06:08,281 --> 02:06:09,900
you gave the dog to?
And he's like,

2643
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:13,830
no.
So now I'm going crazy.

2644
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:14,760
Like,
now I'm like,

2645
02:06:14,790 --> 02:06:15,900
motherfucker,
blah blah blah blah.

2646
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:17,520
So then I called my wife,
I go,

2647
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:20,940
I found the person who has a dog but 
they're not going to give it to her.

2648
02:06:21,390 --> 02:06:26,360
So then I even posted it on my fan page 
and there's some cops in,

2649
02:06:26,361 --> 02:06:29,760
in this area is like,
if you have his phone number,

2650
02:06:30,220 --> 02:06:31,260
we'll,
we can,

2651
02:06:31,340 --> 02:06:33,250
we can go to a guy's house and say,
I mean,

2652
02:06:33,370 --> 02:06:36,100
that's because somebody said that still,
you know,

2653
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:39,240
he has stolen property so you have a 
little bit of recourse.

2654
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:41,970
So,
uh,

2655
02:06:42,030 --> 02:06:44,280
I'm uh,
at gotham in New York,

2656
02:06:44,281 --> 02:06:45,990
you know,
the door guys that work there,

2657
02:06:45,991 --> 02:06:47,850
they're all old tops,
like great,

2658
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,310
great guy.
So he goes to one of the guys,

2659
02:06:50,311 --> 02:06:54,660
goes put the guy on the phone with me,
get me on the phone because I'm going to

2660
02:06:54,661 --> 02:06:59,661
tell him I would hate it.
It's too bad you committed suicide over 

2661
02:06:59,661 --> 02:07:00,030
the last doc.

2662
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:02,790
It's too bad you decided to like,
he was like,

2663
02:07:02,791 --> 02:07:05,190
this is how you talk to that guy.
You go stop being.

2664
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:11,060
So my wife calls him and then he ends up
giving the number two of who has my doG 

2665
02:07:12,991 --> 02:07:15,150
now to my wife,
right?

2666
02:07:15,151 --> 02:07:18,330
So then my wife calls this woman and 
this woman says,

2667
02:07:18,331 --> 02:07:20,640
well,
I've watched the dog for two days now,

2668
02:07:21,090 --> 02:07:22,530
um,
you know,

2669
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:24,470
I've spent a lot of money on food but 
boss.

2670
02:07:24,471 --> 02:07:25,920
So my wife goes,
this is,

2671
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:28,390
I didn't hear this conversation.
It wasn't happy about this.

2672
02:07:28,391 --> 02:07:30,120
She goes,
I'll give you.

2673
02:07:30,290 --> 02:07:35,290
I have 150 bucks cash on me.
Can I come anD get my dog and I'll give 

2674
02:07:35,290 --> 02:07:38,020
you 150 bucks because you were nice 
enough to watch the dog for.

2675
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:43,740
So my wife now keep in mind,
now I'm in New York and this is like 11 

2676
02:07:43,740 --> 02:07:45,220
o'Clock at night,
right?

2677
02:07:45,250 --> 02:07:46,690
La time.
So now I'm like,

2678
02:07:46,930 --> 02:07:49,390
don't drive to some random person's 
house,

2679
02:07:49,391 --> 02:07:50,620
you know,
you're crazy.

2680
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:52,870
So she does.
Anyway,

2681
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:57,160
I'm drives an hour and a half away.
So kate,

2682
02:07:57,190 --> 02:08:01,210
from where your podcast is that there's 
a doG park that's pretty close to here,

2683
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:06,260
right?
Would anybody be hanging out at the dog 

2684
02:08:06,260 --> 02:08:08,380
park here and then drive home an hour 
and a half.

2685
02:08:08,381 --> 02:08:11,650
You don't do that in los angeles,
like nothing's making sense.

2686
02:08:12,070 --> 02:08:15,070
So then she drives to this person's 
house by herself.

2687
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:18,130
Has my other shepherd in the,
in the jeep.

2688
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:21,880
This woman comes out with our doG and 
she,

2689
02:08:22,110 --> 02:08:24,910
the woman goes,
I still don't know if this is your dog.

2690
02:08:25,090 --> 02:08:28,180
And literally as the woman I guess as 
you're going to have to prove it,

2691
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:31,630
margaret bam just takes off,
you know,

2692
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:36,250
like lunges for my wife and was just 
whimpering and stuff like that.

2693
02:08:36,910 --> 02:08:41,910
The woman grabs a hold of margaret's 
collar and then my wife has the collar 

2694
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:45,490
and then my wife's like,
now I gotta throw it on with this bitch.

2695
02:08:45,490 --> 02:08:48,400
Like she goes,
I have to just start punching this older

2696
02:08:48,401 --> 02:08:53,401
woman in the face to get her to let go 
of my dog because now it's a so then my 

2697
02:08:53,401 --> 02:08:58,381
other shepherd jumps out of the jeep,
like the the driver's side window was 

2698
02:08:58,381 --> 02:09:02,941
open and the other shepherd jumps out of
that window because there's now there's 

2699
02:09:03,221 --> 02:09:07,600
kind of a fight going on and then my 
wife has 150 bucks cash.

2700
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:10,780
She throws it like she literally makes 
it rain.

2701
02:09:10,900 --> 02:09:15,900
She grabs,
she needs an extra hand to grab the 

2702
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:19,111
other dog now and the woman let's go of 
of my dog and starts like the money was 

2703
02:09:20,591 --> 02:09:25,591
going to disappear,
starts reaching for the money falling 

2704
02:09:25,591 --> 02:09:28,860
and my wife just grabbed both of them 
and threw them in a car and she said 

2705
02:09:29,031 --> 02:09:30,730
she.
She took off because she was like,

2706
02:09:30,731 --> 02:09:33,610
this is not.
This is not so long story short.

2707
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:36,340
That's crazy.
That dog in the guy.

2708
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:38,140
WHat dude?
I've never.

2709
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:43,320
I've never even had the thought of 
actually physically wanting to kill 

2710
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:43,320
somebody.
Like you say,

2711
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:48,241
I'll kill that guy,
but you never really like really think 

2712
02:09:48,241 --> 02:09:48,241
of it.
I'm like,

2713
02:09:48,241 --> 02:09:51,860
dude,
this dude came into stole my dog and is 

2714
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:52,690
now saying he won't and,
and I have his info now,

2715
02:09:52,691 --> 02:09:54,130
but now this guy knows where you live 
and uh,

2716
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:55,870
you know where this guy lives?
No,

2717
02:09:55,871 --> 02:09:57,460
we don't.
He doesn't know where I live.

2718
02:09:57,490 --> 02:10:00,640
I mean he made he Got your dog.
Well that's true if that like,

2719
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:01,760
but I don't know,
how am I,

2720
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:04,720
I have a privacy fence around my 
backyard.

2721
02:10:04,721 --> 02:10:07,870
So it's pretty dog friendly.
You as a dog,

2722
02:10:07,871 --> 02:10:11,300
you can't scale the wall or get out.
So someone had to get in.

2723
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:14,290
I don't have anY proof of any of that,
but something happened.

2724
02:10:14,470 --> 02:10:19,470
So you don't know if this lady is sold 
or this got sold that lady that dog or 

2725
02:10:19,470 --> 02:10:21,490
gave that lady that dog.
He said he gave it to her,

2726
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:24,100
but I think a or anywhere.
I think they were running a,

2727
02:10:24,110 --> 02:10:26,470
hey,
have your dog give me money.

2728
02:10:26,471 --> 02:10:31,471
Some money scam.
Even though that seems like a lot of 

2729
02:10:31,471 --> 02:10:31,471
don't know.
How would they do that?

2730
02:10:31,471 --> 02:10:35,341
Because you contacted them.
They'Re just hoping that you would find 

2731
02:10:35,341 --> 02:10:35,341
them.
YeAh.

2732
02:10:35,341 --> 02:10:36,470
So come on.
that's a ridiculous scam.

2733
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:39,020
They would maybe contact you and say,
hey,

2734
02:10:39,021 --> 02:10:44,021
I have your dog,
but anybody's going to run a scam like 

2735
02:10:44,021 --> 02:10:46,361
that.
They're not going to put it in 

2736
02:10:46,361 --> 02:10:46,361
craigslist or wherever you found it.
Yeah,

2737
02:10:46,361 --> 02:10:46,361
so we found it.
Yes.

2738
02:10:46,361 --> 02:10:50,460
I gained craigslist like random.
I just type the city I live in and 

2739
02:10:50,460 --> 02:10:51,710
shepherd and a picture of her,
she showed up.

2740
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:53,480
That's so crazy.
Right?

2741
02:10:53,630 --> 02:10:56,450
Or like I can't figure out like what 
happened.

2742
02:10:56,451 --> 02:11:01,451
Like none of like you said,
if it's somebody who's just trying to 

2743
02:11:01,451 --> 02:11:04,690
steal dogs and sell the,
the really shitty at it because there's 

2744
02:11:04,690 --> 02:11:04,690
a way easier way to do it.

2745
02:11:05,350 --> 02:11:10,350
Maybe it's all about that.
The movie lost and found with david 

2746
02:11:10,350 --> 02:11:10,920
spade.
Seven,

2747
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:15,960
seven psychopaths.
That's what the dude in seven 

2748
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:15,960
psychopaths did with the dog.

2749
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:16,770
Well,
I think it could be like,

2750
02:11:16,771 --> 02:11:18,040
well,
I eat that.

2751
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:22,380
I have people around me that sometimes 
will call and say,

2752
02:11:22,381 --> 02:11:23,910
your dogs are barking.
This.

2753
02:11:23,950 --> 02:11:28,260
This was a while ago,
there was a problem and then this person

2754
02:11:28,261 --> 02:11:33,261
would throw oranges from his side over 
into my yard or like eggs and stuff like

2755
02:11:33,811 --> 02:11:35,370
that.
And Then he would call and say,

2756
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:38,400
your dogs are back.
they're constantly barking.

2757
02:11:38,401 --> 02:11:39,690
And that would go,
yeah dude,

2758
02:11:39,691 --> 02:11:44,691
because you're throwing,
you're throwing shit at them and you're 

2759
02:11:44,691 --> 02:11:47,721
having conversations with them.
Of course they're going to bark at 

2760
02:11:47,721 --> 02:11:50,790
somebody on the other side of the fence.
So who knows if like a neighbor,

2761
02:11:51,150 --> 02:11:53,250
like had somebody.
I don't know.

2762
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:55,200
My,
my ex girlfriend,

2763
02:11:55,260 --> 02:12:00,260
crazy shit has happened.
My ex girlfriend had a dog and I think 

2764
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:02,550
because it barked all the time,
I think somebody poisoned it by throwing

2765
02:12:02,551 --> 02:12:07,551
a piece of food over the side of her 
fence and then the dog died or it would

2766
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:10,070
tell me what you think about that.
Speaking of tHat.

2767
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:12,320
All right.
so my dog,

2768
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:17,440
uh,
I would always put like if I was making 

2769
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:19,451
peanut butter sandwich or something,
I get like a scoop of peanut butter and 

2770
02:12:19,451 --> 02:12:19,451
I,
and I get the spoon.

2771
02:12:19,451 --> 02:12:20,930
I know you guys had never been to one,
have a spoon at my house.

2772
02:12:20,931 --> 02:12:24,860
But I would like turn this boon and the 
dogs would lick the peanut butter on the

2773
02:12:24,861 --> 02:12:28,160
spoon.
A kind of after all this happened,

2774
02:12:28,370 --> 02:12:33,370
I,
I will put out a spoon with peanut 

2775
02:12:33,370 --> 02:12:33,370
butter on it and show short towards 
margaret.

2776
02:12:33,370 --> 02:12:36,860
Her ears flip back and she takes off.
She won't even come by me.

2777
02:12:37,170 --> 02:12:39,800
Oh wow.
So right.

2778
02:12:39,801 --> 02:12:42,680
Because dogs learn something.
So something shady happened.

2779
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:43,930
Like you said.
I have.

2780
02:12:43,940 --> 02:12:44,630
No,
I have no.

2781
02:12:44,660 --> 02:12:47,630
Well those dogs are really smart to.
Shepherds are very smart.

2782
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:49,510
They're very quick.

2783
02:12:49,630 --> 02:12:50,550
Yeah,
they don't.

2784
02:12:50,630 --> 02:12:55,630
You don't got to tell him twice.
They usually those are dogs or you have 

2785
02:12:55,630 --> 02:12:55,630
to be like real active with.
Because they get bored,

2786
02:12:55,850 --> 02:13:00,850
you know,
that they can't just lay around like a 

2787
02:13:00,850 --> 02:13:00,850
bulldog,
like one of those english bulldogs.

2788
02:13:00,850 --> 02:13:00,850
Those are fat,
lazy dogs.

2789
02:13:00,850 --> 02:13:02,540
They'll just lay around.
Shepherds would be like,

2790
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:03,920
okay,
I gotta get out of this yard.

2791
02:13:04,070 --> 02:13:05,360
I got to figure out where it was.
Fucking yard.

2792
02:13:05,390 --> 02:13:07,160
They'll climb trees and shit.
You know,

2793
02:13:07,190 --> 02:13:08,570
they'll escape there.
Get bored.

2794
02:13:09,020 --> 02:13:10,880
Yeah.
Or smartest shit.

2795
02:13:10,910 --> 02:13:13,850
That's where the good police dogs,
shepherds and those other ones that look

2796
02:13:13,851 --> 02:13:16,640
like shepherds was belgian and ellen was
like,

2797
02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:18,260
oh yeah,
matt malamutes.

2798
02:13:18,270 --> 02:13:20,060
Malcolm was,
I think they're called the malamute,

2799
02:13:20,070 --> 02:13:22,550
two different dogs.
I've never owned shepherd prior to these

2800
02:13:22,551 --> 02:13:26,740
two nights and they're great.
I've had like golden retrievers like,

2801
02:13:27,150 --> 02:13:32,150
but my shepherd's aren't like,
people are afraid of them because they 

2802
02:13:32,150 --> 02:13:32,150
look,
you know,

2803
02:13:32,150 --> 02:13:32,150
if you see them,
you go,

2804
02:13:32,150 --> 02:13:32,150
uh,
that's

2805
02:13:32,170 --> 02:13:35,340
there.
That my brother and his wife,

2806
02:13:35,660 --> 02:13:38,300
they have rottweilers and I've never 
been in it for.

2807
02:13:38,370 --> 02:13:40,050
You just have mentally in your head 
like,

2808
02:13:40,051 --> 02:13:42,060
oh,
rottweilers are rough.

2809
02:13:42,330 --> 02:13:44,700
They couldn't be a nicer dog.
Those are good dogs.

2810
02:13:44,701 --> 02:13:49,701
Like if you raised right.
I had a buddy of mine who had a really 

2811
02:13:49,701 --> 02:13:49,701
good one.
It was a sweetheart.

2812
02:13:49,780 --> 02:13:52,170
The drunk kids like him,
five-year-old,

2813
02:13:52,171 --> 02:13:54,360
he earth.
He's three liaison.

2814
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:59,420
The rottweiler,
like he's watching tv and the dog will 

2815
02:13:59,420 --> 02:14:02,151
just sit there and I started wrestling 
with them a little bit or like tickle 

2816
02:14:02,151 --> 02:14:05,491
fighting.
The rottweiler came in between us and 

2817
02:14:05,491 --> 02:14:05,700
just kind of plopped down just to kind 
of go,

2818
02:14:05,701 --> 02:14:10,701
okay,
we've had enough of the tickle fight.

2819
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:16,220
Dogs are interesting because so much of 
a dog's personality is based on the 

2820
02:14:16,220 --> 02:14:18,300
breeder and how well the breeder takes 
care of the parents.

2821
02:14:18,301 --> 02:14:23,301
And the generations before,
like I got this dog that's a regency 

2822
02:14:23,301 --> 02:14:24,020
mast,
if you ever seen my tongue.

2823
02:14:24,170 --> 02:14:29,170
Yeah,
his dad was on fear factor and his dad 

2824
02:14:29,170 --> 02:14:30,810
was so chill.
He was just such a sweet dog.

2825
02:14:30,811 --> 02:14:34,410
He's just hanging out.
Like he was just like real calm and like

2826
02:14:34,411 --> 02:14:37,200
real sweet.
But then he used them as an attack dog.

2827
02:14:37,230 --> 02:14:42,230
Like he had a big dog.
So you like taken out people in those 

2828
02:14:42,230 --> 02:14:45,681
big attack dog suits and this guy,
he won't even breed dogs if they have 

2829
02:14:45,751 --> 02:14:48,930
any aggression towards people because 
any growlin or barking at eight,

2830
02:14:48,990 --> 02:14:53,990
like he'll try and take their food away.
He'll do all kinds of different things 

2831
02:14:53,990 --> 02:14:54,450
to test them and he'll,
he's always kind to them.

2832
02:14:54,451 --> 02:14:57,960
But if they show any sign of aggression 
towards people,

2833
02:14:58,110 --> 02:15:03,110
he doesn't breed them.
And so because of that he has is like 

2834
02:15:03,110 --> 02:15:03,110
really calm,
really sweet,

2835
02:15:03,110 --> 02:15:06,720
really confident dogs.
And a lot of like dog breeds depend upon

2836
02:15:06,930 --> 02:15:07,980
who's raising them.

2837
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:10,080
What qualities are trying to get out of 
the dog.

2838
02:15:10,081 --> 02:15:12,300
And if they're really strict like this 
guy joe was,

2839
02:15:12,870 --> 02:15:15,210
then you get like this amazing dog.
Like my dog,

2840
02:15:15,211 --> 02:15:17,160
johnny,
he's like the sweetest dog ever had.

2841
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:19,220
He's so friendly.
Like I,

2842
02:15:19,221 --> 02:15:19,720
I,
my,

2843
02:15:19,880 --> 02:15:22,470
my four year old will bring friends over
and they'll play with him.

2844
02:15:22,471 --> 02:15:25,080
I have no fear.
It's just a gentle giant.

2845
02:15:25,100 --> 02:15:26,830
Like he.
He's never even.

2846
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:29,250
I've seen dogs bite him and he doesn't 
even fight back.

2847
02:15:29,251 --> 02:15:29,700
He's like,
hey,

2848
02:15:29,701 --> 02:15:31,170
what the fuck man?
Why you whitened me?

2849
02:15:31,490 --> 02:15:33,480
No,
he's just a big sweetie.

2850
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:39,080
Just to kind kind dog that I have 
visions now because I'm looking at 

2851
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:43,551
property in the midwest.
Just for you doing john heffrons exit 

2852
02:15:43,551 --> 02:15:44,690
strategy.
Trying to fucking prep us.

2853
02:15:44,860 --> 02:15:49,860
Yeah.
You're a prepper where I just want to 

2854
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:51,660
sit in a lawn chair with one of the,
like those tennis about things.

2855
02:15:51,660 --> 02:15:55,650
We go to unc and it shoots the tennis 
ball and let my dog do sprints.

2856
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:58,830
So you jusT want to like train them.
I just want to sit there.

2857
02:15:58,831 --> 02:16:01,170
I think that would be the greatest.
Just spring day.

2858
02:16:01,171 --> 02:16:06,171
Just sit there.
I knew a dude who went through one of 

2859
02:16:06,171 --> 02:16:07,950
those.
Sun training is some that is.

2860
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:10,320
I try to do it with my,
with margaret,

2861
02:16:10,321 --> 02:16:13,140
but that they said she was too friendly,
like kit,

2862
02:16:13,170 --> 02:16:18,170
the agitator,
because you need to get a little bit of 

2863
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:18,170
it and they're like,
yeah,

2864
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:18,170
she doesn't.
That's fine.

2865
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:18,630
He just wants to.
Yeah.

2866
02:16:18,750 --> 02:16:20,280
How old was she when you try to do it to
her?

2867
02:16:20,790 --> 02:16:21,810
Whatever.
A year,

2868
02:16:21,811 --> 02:16:26,811
year and a half.
Like they say you shake your shake like 

2869
02:16:27,091 --> 02:16:32,091
a candle to make a lot of noise and some
dogs will take off and their dogs will 

2870
02:16:32,091 --> 02:16:33,040
go to it like so it all,
you know.

2871
02:16:33,190 --> 02:16:35,470
Hm.
LIke whether or not they're aggressive.

2872
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:36,730
Yeah.
Like if there.

2873
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:39,010
But there's levels of that training I've
seen.

2874
02:16:39,350 --> 02:16:41,320
Did you see that?
There's a facebook video.

2875
02:16:41,530 --> 02:16:46,530
This guy just says a couple of words and
there's a fight like so guys are 

2876
02:16:46,530 --> 02:16:51,060
fighting.
The guy says some words and then the 

2877
02:16:51,060 --> 02:16:53,450
shepherd runs to the baby and sits there
and then one,

2878
02:16:53,451 --> 02:16:57,010
one of the guys fighting turns to then 
go towards the baby.

2879
02:16:57,340 --> 02:16:58,630
The shepherd goes,
nope.

2880
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:01,350
And attacks to get like the guys in 
suits,

2881
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:04,150
but they're like doing drills and the 
train this.

2882
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:09,600
So they're like those.
You ever seen those a dupont registry 

2883
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:11,170
magazines.
It's like all like weird rich people.

2884
02:17:11,171 --> 02:17:13,720
Shit like watches the cost half a 
million bucks.

2885
02:17:13,721 --> 02:17:16,030
And rob report.
Robb report.

2886
02:17:16,031 --> 02:17:21,031
Exactly.
They always have those pages In there 

2887
02:17:21,031 --> 02:17:22,690
that are dedicated to these train german
shepherds and you see them sitting there

2888
02:17:22,691 --> 02:17:27,691
guarding a crib.
Loyal guardian and like what I do for a 

2889
02:17:27,691 --> 02:17:28,810
living that.
yeah,

2890
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:31,540
it was a lot of people out there that 
are just worried too.

2891
02:17:31,541 --> 02:17:36,541
I would totally staring out the windows 
was my fucking killers.

2892
02:17:39,210 --> 02:17:42,070
Tack dog.
You know what I watched the other day?

2893
02:17:42,310 --> 02:17:44,980
A elephant in the living room.
What are you guys doing over there?

2894
02:17:47,620 --> 02:17:48,590
Oh the.
Yeah.

2895
02:17:48,820 --> 02:17:52,240
The ads are on every one of them.
I used to get that magazine.

2896
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:57,270
The magazine itself was like an alien 
because it was just fun to like go 

2897
02:17:57,270 --> 02:18:00,631
through like what movie?
Oh fuck.

2898
02:18:00,791 --> 02:18:02,950
What was I going to say?
Elephant in the room.

2899
02:18:03,070 --> 02:18:03,940
Oh,
elephant in the room.

2900
02:18:04,150 --> 02:18:09,150
Elephant in the room is a movie about 
all these people that keep exotic pets 

2901
02:18:09,150 --> 02:18:11,350
in their home.
Like lions and shit.

2902
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:16,210
Like this guy had this weird 
relationship with this lion and it would

2903
02:18:16,211 --> 02:18:18,540
go in the cage with a lion and hug it 
and he's like,

2904
02:18:18,550 --> 02:18:19,300
this lion,
you know,

2905
02:18:19,330 --> 02:18:21,430
kept me alive.
If I didn't have this line,

2906
02:18:21,431 --> 02:18:22,750
I would have been dead.
You know,

2907
02:18:22,751 --> 02:18:25,240
I had my broke my back in a truck 
driving accident.

2908
02:18:25,241 --> 02:18:27,940
I was all fucked up on pills and I got 
this lion and it's like,

2909
02:18:28,180 --> 02:18:29,590
it's so weird.

2910
02:18:29,770 --> 02:18:31,660
It's so weird watching this.
It's like,

2911
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:36,720
don't they eventually kill you like a 
lion would even though you know you're 

2912
02:18:36,720 --> 02:18:37,120
friendly.
Anything just have a bad day.

2913
02:18:37,121 --> 02:18:40,840
And just sometimes they do.
Sometimes they do,

2914
02:18:40,841 --> 02:18:45,841
but I think if you pay attention to all 
these motherfuckers that have lines and 

2915
02:18:45,841 --> 02:18:46,090
how few of them actually wind up killing
them.

2916
02:18:46,510 --> 02:18:50,440
I think if you train them correctly and 
you were there all the time,

2917
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:55,680
it's probably at least reasonably safe 
when they seem to attack is when they 

2918
02:18:55,680 --> 02:18:58,390
get agitated.
like the siegfried and roy thing.

2919
02:18:58,510 --> 02:18:59,160
Yeah.
They're like,

2920
02:18:59,161 --> 02:19:04,161
I'm not there were thin.
We're thinking that it might've been 

2921
02:19:04,161 --> 02:19:06,451
because some lady in the audience had 
some crazy hat on and that the tiger 

2922
02:19:06,821 --> 02:19:09,730
might've seen that hat as like a cobra,
like something,

2923
02:19:09,990 --> 02:19:14,990
a peacock,
some fucking crazy animal like remember 

2924
02:19:14,990 --> 02:19:16,810
in jurassic park when the fucking Wayne 
Knight is trying to steal and that thing

2925
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:21,130
shows up in the car with them.
Like maybe that's what the tiGer thought

2926
02:19:21,131 --> 02:19:26,131
that hat was like something similar.
Like something alerting him that it was 

2927
02:19:26,131 --> 02:19:28,090
about to attack will show is talking the
whole time or just as

2928
02:19:28,090 --> 02:19:29,230
a performer.
The tigers,

2929
02:19:29,520 --> 02:19:34,520
you know what?
Fuck this second show friday they said 

2930
02:19:35,691 --> 02:19:40,691
that it wasn't even trying to kill him.
It was just dragging them out of there 

2931
02:19:40,691 --> 02:19:43,780
and that it didn't.
It had no idea like the biting him on 

2932
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:44,780
the neck would just crushes vertebrae 
because it's just so strong.

2933
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:46,250
It was trying to just get him out of 
there.

2934
02:19:47,020 --> 02:19:51,440
I don't know if I buy that and I think 
he just got sick of working for him.

2935
02:19:52,770 --> 02:19:57,770
It could have a guy got killed a couple 
of days ago or he got mauled,

2936
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:00,860
went into a line enclosure,
climbed in.

2937
02:20:00,861 --> 02:20:05,861
It's like the third guy this year,
there was an indian guy that got killed 

2938
02:20:05,861 --> 02:20:05,861
by that big white tiger.
Do you remember that?

2939
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:06,560
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2940
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:08,420
Oh my god.
That was the most ridiculous.

2941
02:20:08,421 --> 02:20:13,421
Whenever you guys on hIs knees,
like annoying the shit out of the tiger 

2942
02:20:13,421 --> 02:20:13,421
by praying.

2943
02:20:13,421 --> 02:20:14,640
He's like,
ooh,

2944
02:20:14,930 --> 02:20:16,520
he won't stop.
And finally tiger's.

2945
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:17,040
He's like,
hey,

2946
02:20:17,041 --> 02:20:22,041
you fucking annoying bitch pam.
He grabs him and just drag them over to 

2947
02:20:22,041 --> 02:20:23,540
the other side of the enclosure,
like he's a pillow.

2948
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:26,120
Have you seen it?
Know when to watch it.

2949
02:20:27,310 --> 02:20:30,080
Put It up on this thing here so we don't
get pulled from youtube.

2950
02:20:30,081 --> 02:20:32,900
We have a strategy now for,
what is it showing videos.

2951
02:20:33,570 --> 02:20:38,570
Oh yeah.
Well we keep getting pulled from 

2952
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:41,351
youtube.
Every time we show videos now we don't 

2953
02:20:41,351 --> 02:20:41,351
really show them,
so sort of show them over on that side.

2954
02:20:41,990 --> 02:20:45,170
So it's not the actual video playing on 
our youtuBe channel.

2955
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:47,690
Gotcha.
I get it.

2956
02:20:47,900 --> 02:20:50,040
You know,
they're trying to not have anybody steal

2957
02:20:50,041 --> 02:20:55,041
a views from them,
but I think it probably in the long run 

2958
02:20:55,041 --> 02:20:56,630
gets you more views Because people don't
want to see it just on the podcast.

2959
02:20:56,630 --> 02:20:58,070
They want to tell their friends about 
it.

2960
02:20:58,100 --> 02:21:03,100
Did you hear the link?
And then they're gonna go to the actual 

2961
02:21:03,100 --> 02:21:03,260
length.
But I get it.

2962
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:06,830
I guess they called fair use.
I don't know what Fair use is.

2963
02:21:07,180 --> 02:21:09,320
I'm not exactly sure.
It seems debatable.

2964
02:21:09,380 --> 02:21:13,040
There's like a debatable definition for 
fair use.

2965
02:21:13,220 --> 02:21:15,800
Anyway,
this fucking dude gets jacked.

2966
02:21:15,860 --> 02:21:17,230
That's what's important.
John fraud.

2967
02:21:17,540 --> 02:21:22,490
This guy gets fucking jacked and he's,
for whatever reason,

2968
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:27,320
he thinks it's smart to uh,
to fucking keep praying.

2969
02:21:27,700 --> 02:21:30,620
Like the tiger gets like right on top of
him and he just,

2970
02:21:30,890 --> 02:21:33,530
he doesn't stay still,
he doesn't play dead.

2971
02:21:33,740 --> 02:21:36,350
He just keeps bobbing back and forth and
up and down,

2972
02:21:36,351 --> 02:21:38,420
back and forth and up and down.
And eventually the tigers like,

2973
02:21:38,490 --> 02:21:41,690
all right,
I seen enough.

2974
02:21:41,910 --> 02:21:44,420
Yeah.
Oh we have to sIt through an ad.

2975
02:21:44,750 --> 02:21:49,310
It's an indian ad,
but these are americans.

2976
02:21:49,490 --> 02:21:50,930
What's going on?
They speak in english.

2977
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:54,910
What state farm is that?
What it is?

2978
02:21:56,080 --> 02:22:01,080
I always showing that I don't want to 
see this video as disturbing images not 

2979
02:22:02,021 --> 02:22:06,190
suitable for children de a lady.
this lady all excited to show this.

2980
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:11,130
Look at tHis fucking animal hovering 
over that dude.

2981
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:13,780
My god.
That's when it's killing him.

2982
02:22:15,460 --> 02:22:19,450
Like this is him dragging them off.
like you can kind of see it unpixelated.

2983
02:22:19,480 --> 02:22:21,090
well that you can get a better video,
brian.

2984
02:22:21,091 --> 02:22:23,140
You can get a real video.
You don't have to show this one.

2985
02:22:23,141 --> 02:22:26,910
There's real videos that show the actual
like thing in front of them like this,

2986
02:22:27,150 --> 02:22:31,950
but he's moving around.
But who fall Indiana jumped in.

2987
02:22:31,980 --> 02:22:35,670
I think he went to intuit it on his own.
Can find the other one.

2988
02:22:35,671 --> 02:22:39,890
You could actually see it because you 
see the guy like he's for whatever.

2989
02:22:39,891 --> 02:22:41,550
Right?
That's the upper one.

2990
02:22:41,551 --> 02:22:42,600
Yeah,
forever.

2991
02:22:42,660 --> 02:22:43,830
Whatever reason.
He's like,

2992
02:22:44,130 --> 02:22:46,590
he won't stop moving.
Yeah.

2993
02:22:46,591 --> 02:22:48,330
The daily motion is going to give you 
the real deal.

2994
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:51,870
Daily motion in live leak.
Those are dark websites.

2995
02:22:52,880 --> 02:22:53,820
Yeah.
Here it is.

2996
02:22:54,980 --> 02:22:56,480
Yeah.
Lively doesn't fuck around.

2997
02:22:56,820 --> 02:23:01,820
Look at this.
This guy is just sitting there and 

2998
02:23:01,820 --> 02:23:05,250
there's this giant beast look scenes 
constantly moving and the cat is like,

2999
02:23:05,311 --> 02:23:06,690
you're not supposed to be here.
fucker.

3000
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:09,540
Why you moving so much?
Yeah,

3001
02:23:09,960 --> 02:23:12,000
I mean it's.
What can you do there?

3002
02:23:12,050 --> 02:23:15,350
That feather in front of my cat.
My cat events.

3003
02:23:15,810 --> 02:23:17,180
Look at him.
Yeah.

3004
02:23:19,740 --> 02:23:21,750
Oh my god.
This is so hard to watch.

3005
02:23:22,110 --> 02:23:24,420
You're not getting out because if the 
tiger can't get out,

3006
02:23:24,450 --> 02:23:27,780
you can't get out.
That thing can jump 14 feet in the air.

3007
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:29,580
It can't get out.
You're fucked.

3008
02:23:30,390 --> 02:23:31,710
So you're just going to have to get 
eaten.

3009
02:23:31,720 --> 02:23:32,640
Son.
This is.

3010
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:34,770
I don't think there's any other way 
around it.

3011
02:23:35,610 --> 02:23:37,140
What do you do?
Do you get up and go,

3012
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:38,670
hey,
I'm going to go over here real quick.

3013
02:23:38,730 --> 02:23:41,910
Can you try to think of the zoo people 
will be coming out with.

3014
02:23:41,911 --> 02:23:44,220
They're like,
what the fuck they do in India?

3015
02:23:44,221 --> 02:23:45,740
That's probably one dude.
He's probably like,

3016
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:47,370
yeah,
cleaned the monkey cage right now.

3017
02:23:47,540 --> 02:23:52,540
He's over euros chick like it's a mine 
in the tiger cage.

3018
02:23:57,600 --> 02:23:58,590
What?
Hold on.

3019
02:23:59,340 --> 02:24:01,530
He's got a text.
Text comes in and he's to text her.

3020
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:02,910
Hold on,
I go back.

3021
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:04,900
there's a man at a tiger cage.
What?

3022
02:24:05,060 --> 02:24:06,600
This tiger is getting annoyed with this 
dude.

3023
02:24:08,310 --> 02:24:10,410
I think people were like yelling at him 
to like,

3024
02:24:10,411 --> 02:24:11,820
hey,
you get the fuck away from here.

3025
02:24:12,330 --> 02:24:17,330
Oh shit,
this is the tiger moved in these 

3026
02:24:17,330 --> 02:24:20,181
dummies.
They're focusing on people's sneakers 

3027
02:24:20,181 --> 02:24:23,070
because they're not paying attention.
See tHese fuckheads shitty video here.

3028
02:24:23,370 --> 02:24:24,480
Here it is.
Oh my god.

3029
02:24:24,481 --> 02:24:26,460
it's fucking him up.
So he goes down.

3030
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:30,670
Oh my god.
See that when it like pulled.

3031
02:24:30,870 --> 02:24:32,550
Oh,
and here's where it gets dark.

3032
02:24:32,910 --> 02:24:35,970
It just grabs him by the neck and just 
carries them away.

3033
02:24:36,030 --> 02:24:38,270
Look at that.
Look how easy It karen.

3034
02:24:38,390 --> 02:24:38,860
Yeah,
right.

3035
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:43,320
And that guy,
and he's like 130 pounds.

3036
02:24:43,321 --> 02:24:48,321
Probably 140 character is nothing jumps 
over ravine with them.

3037
02:24:49,230 --> 02:24:52,110
I mean it's got this enclosure,
it's like a swimming pool type thing and

3038
02:24:52,111 --> 02:24:54,480
it just goes right up the side of it.
Like it's nothing.

3039
02:24:55,290 --> 02:24:57,810
Oh,
what a way to die.

3040
02:24:58,370 --> 02:25:01,530
I mean,
what a dumb idea in a goofy way to die.

3041
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:07,550
But like lions,
there's a guy that made it into a line 

3042
02:25:07,550 --> 02:25:08,220
and closure and he was trying to convert
the lion to christianity.

3043
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:13,640
whereas yeah,
there's a video of that and alliance 

3044
02:25:13,640 --> 02:25:13,640
just start fucking him up.
Pull that,

3045
02:25:13,640 --> 02:25:18,351
pull that up.
LIon tries to convert man to 

3046
02:25:18,351 --> 02:25:18,351
christianity.
It's,

3047
02:25:18,351 --> 02:25:19,770
it's,
it just fucked this dude up.

3048
02:25:22,260 --> 02:25:23,980
It's hilarious.
There's

3049
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:27,250
people in 2014 still want to give it a 
try.

3050
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:29,170
Yeah,
just fucking.

3051
02:25:29,171 --> 02:25:32,920
I think I can get in there and just this
line needs to be done with jesus.

3052
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:36,490
Poor bastard.
Look at this.

3053
02:25:36,491 --> 02:25:40,480
He's out there proselytizing to lions.
Look is waving his hands.

3054
02:25:42,910 --> 02:25:44,950
I think this was in China.
Am I correct?

3055
02:25:45,570 --> 02:25:47,170
Yeah.
Okay.

3056
02:25:47,270 --> 02:25:52,270
This guy,
he's standing there just annoying the 

3057
02:25:52,270 --> 02:25:52,510
shit out of alliance.
They're not even fucking with them.

3058
02:25:52,930 --> 02:25:54,490
Look at that.
Oh my god.

3059
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:58,450
it just finally just sat down and he's 
getting a rash.

3060
02:25:58,480 --> 02:25:59,140
Like,
listen,

3061
02:25:59,141 --> 02:26:01,660
I know you're lashing out,
but it's because you don't have the lord

3062
02:26:01,990 --> 02:26:04,120
that lions scratch the shit out of him.
But look,

3063
02:26:04,121 --> 02:26:06,070
the lion doesn't want anything to do 
with them.

3064
02:26:06,490 --> 02:26:11,490
The lich not trying to kill him.
Just this fucking dummy just won't get 

3065
02:26:11,490 --> 02:26:11,490
ghost.
Yeah,

3066
02:26:11,490 --> 02:26:12,430
we get this.
Oh,

3067
02:26:12,431 --> 02:26:16,970
you bitch it just bit him.
oh motherfucker not.

3068
02:26:17,250 --> 02:26:19,450
Not trying to kill him.
He just doesn't want him.

3069
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:21,460
Does.
Doesn't want him around.

3070
02:26:22,810 --> 02:26:26,310
He needs to figure out a way to get the 
fuck out of dodge and then the white.

3071
02:26:26,311 --> 02:26:27,280
He's so stupid.
He.

3072
02:26:27,310 --> 02:26:28,360
Oh shit.
Oh,

3073
02:26:28,361 --> 02:26:30,280
it's clawing at.
It bites his leg.

3074
02:26:30,340 --> 02:26:32,200
Oh my god.
That has to hurt.

3075
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:36,870
Yeah.
Oh my god.

3076
02:26:36,930 --> 02:26:39,420
This guy's lucky.
That lion is like really sweet.

3077
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:43,980
That's a nice light.
They get lost a couple of times.

3078
02:26:44,270 --> 02:26:47,670
The line has to attack him.
I mean it's like lot.

3079
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:49,950
I don't remember either.
I don't think he does.

3080
02:26:49,951 --> 02:26:51,770
As a matter of fact,
I think he makes it through this,

3081
02:26:52,710 --> 02:26:56,800
but the lion actually just doesn't want 
him there and he standing there.

3082
02:26:56,810 --> 02:26:58,950
May christ compel you.
Oh,

3083
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,770
this guy's got a gun out.
Ready to shoot the line.

3084
02:27:01,790 --> 02:27:03,960
The case of the lion takes.
He should shoot that guy.

3085
02:27:04,170 --> 02:27:05,940
That's what he should do.
You fucking idiot.

3086
02:27:07,170 --> 02:27:09,600
by the power of christ.
The lion lies down in front of them.

3087
02:27:09,900 --> 02:27:12,610
Jesus made that lie and lie down.
Yeah.

3088
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:14,550
Now the guy's going to get cocky and 
walk forward.

3089
02:27:15,090 --> 02:27:17,220
Oh,
they're got a tranquilizer dart it.

3090
02:27:17,880 --> 02:27:20,430
They should just tranq him shooting him 
right in the dick.

3091
02:27:20,970 --> 02:27:23,970
Fucking retard.
What kind of a dumb ass.

3092
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:27,690
They got their stretcher ready.
They know this guy's bleeding profusely.

3093
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:29,100
Okay.
they tracked it.

3094
02:27:29,480 --> 02:27:33,540
They drank the cat's wow.
They trank the cats for a dumb ass.

3095
02:27:35,110 --> 02:27:37,870
look at him.
He's okay at a big ass bite and his leg.

3096
02:27:38,620 --> 02:27:41,050
They stitched him up.
What a dummy.

3097
02:27:45,580 --> 02:27:47,500
God damn.
people are silly.

3098
02:27:47,501 --> 02:27:49,540
Jon [inaudible].
What the fuck is that about?

3099
02:27:49,790 --> 02:27:54,790
That his wife was like next to him like,
are you going to beat this guy's ass or 

3100
02:27:54,790 --> 02:27:55,990
goodness.
Whose wife the the line.

3101
02:27:55,991 --> 02:27:58,760
I just pretended that that other line 
that was confused,

3102
02:27:58,810 --> 02:27:59,410
like,
how do You know?

3103
02:27:59,411 --> 02:28:01,720
There's like 10 people around.
how do you know who's married to who?

3104
02:28:01,721 --> 02:28:03,880
John half run with magical powers.
Do you have?

3105
02:28:03,910 --> 02:28:08,910
My wife called me out on that.
She used to watch the kardashians and 

3106
02:28:08,910 --> 02:28:11,200
I'd always just go.
It's just making it just it gum.

3107
02:28:11,201 --> 02:28:13,400
It makes you dumber than human being 
watching.

3108
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:16,930
But the one of the husbands on there,
I don't know enough,

3109
02:28:16,931 --> 02:28:21,410
the guy who looks like a psycho white 
dude with his slicked back hair.

3110
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:24,530
Do you guys know whatever,
whatever his name is,

3111
02:28:24,531 --> 02:28:26,660
but they know who I'm talking about.
He's married to the older sister.

3112
02:28:26,690 --> 02:28:29,720
Every time he would see that as a joke,
I will look at my wife and go.

3113
02:28:29,780 --> 02:28:31,670
If I ever saw that guy,
I would kick them right in the head.

3114
02:28:32,300 --> 02:28:34,460
The first thing I would do that to me so
much.

3115
02:28:34,610 --> 02:28:36,660
You have to watch it to see.
He kind of gets under your skin.

3116
02:28:36,661 --> 02:28:38,990
It seems like an unreasonable way to 
deal with people.

3117
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:39,910
So I would go,
man,

3118
02:28:39,950 --> 02:28:41,570
I would just.
I would kick the guy right in the head.

3119
02:28:41,571 --> 02:28:44,780
He just seems like a thing.
So we're in calabasas.

3120
02:28:45,050 --> 02:28:45,860
This was,
you know,

3121
02:28:46,130 --> 02:28:51,130
after me saying this,
every single time I've ever seen the 

3122
02:28:51,130 --> 02:28:51,170
show,
we're in calabasas at the bookstore.

3123
02:28:51,650 --> 02:28:56,650
I'm walking down the aisle with my wife.
He turns into the aisle and starts 

3124
02:28:56,961 --> 02:29:01,961
walking towards us.
And then the whole time he's walking 

3125
02:29:01,961 --> 02:29:01,961
towards us.
My wife has gone,

3126
02:29:01,961 --> 02:29:02,300
well,
here's your chance.

3127
02:29:02,780 --> 02:29:03,690
Here's your,
here's your chance.

3128
02:29:03,710 --> 02:29:08,710
BIg guys.
He's coming right now and then part of 

3129
02:29:08,710 --> 02:29:08,710
me was like,
okay,

3130
02:29:08,710 --> 02:29:12,281
do I got to kick him in the head just so
I get street cred with my wife or 

3131
02:29:12,281 --> 02:29:14,870
whatever when we obviously walked by him
and then my wife goes,

3132
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:16,880
I'll talk.
You just all talk.

3133
02:29:17,290 --> 02:29:19,850
Yeah,
that game's no fun because.

3134
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:24,960
Because last night we were at the comedy
store and louis ck was playing and we 

3135
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:29,071
have the same thing and my girlfriends 
is leonardo dicaprio and they fucking 

3136
02:29:29,071 --> 02:29:29,071
walks by leonardo.

3137
02:29:30,390 --> 02:29:35,390
Yeah.
You can't play that year over whatever 

3138
02:29:35,390 --> 02:29:35,390
It is,
whatever it's called,

3139
02:29:35,390 --> 02:29:36,500
they you get one celebrity to hook up 
with.

3140
02:29:36,620 --> 02:29:40,290
Not if you live in la because you have 
chances that you're going to run in.

3141
02:29:40,350 --> 02:29:41,780
That's you know.
No way.

3142
02:29:41,970 --> 02:29:46,970
If you're a leonardo dicaprio,
you probably can't live anywhere other 

3143
02:29:46,970 --> 02:29:50,091
than la.
Like leonardo dicaprio tried to move to 

3144
02:29:50,091 --> 02:29:50,091
Nebraska.
Like people would like.

3145
02:29:50,091 --> 02:29:52,260
There'd be like tours.
People would Fly out.

3146
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:55,500
Like that's where leonardo dicaprio is.
We'll go out to his.

3147
02:29:55,760 --> 02:30:00,760
He's got a farm up there in Nebraska.
Like I remember there was a thing about 

3148
02:30:01,110 --> 02:30:03,270
val kilmer,
like val kilmer had a uh,

3149
02:30:03,330 --> 02:30:08,310
a place that he put out in a New Mexico.
Yeah,

3150
02:30:08,490 --> 02:30:10,110
yeah.
He had some crazy ranch.

3151
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:15,200
I think he still does,
but like he just retired some ranch in 

3152
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:16,050
New Mexico and everybody would just be 
like walking around the ramps,

3153
02:30:16,060 --> 02:30:21,060
like a fucking batman lives in that 
place and he was fucking ice from top 

3154
02:30:22,141 --> 02:30:23,010
gun,
you know?

3155
02:30:23,011 --> 02:30:24,510
And yeah,
he lives in this,

3156
02:30:24,530 --> 02:30:27,180
this ranch that's like right there.
and everybody would be like,

3157
02:30:27,181 --> 02:30:32,181
what the fuck?
It's almost like you want to like go 

3158
02:30:32,181 --> 02:30:34,431
there just to see if it's real.
Like you'd want to like look over the 

3159
02:30:34,431 --> 02:30:34,431
hedges,
like what's going on over there.

3160
02:30:34,460 --> 02:30:36,530
I can imagine if you're him and you 
just,

3161
02:30:36,540 --> 02:30:41,540
every time you leave your house to a 
bunch of people peering over your 

3162
02:30:41,540 --> 02:30:41,540
hedges,
staring at you,

3163
02:30:41,540 --> 02:30:41,830
you have a.

3164
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:48,960
If you're really famous you have to stay
in la because then that way you get 

3165
02:30:48,960 --> 02:30:50,610
watered down a little.
LIke it just naturally you.

3166
02:30:50,850 --> 02:30:52,360
Well you definitely get watered down 
like,

3167
02:30:52,361 --> 02:30:52,770
yeah,
sure.

3168
02:30:53,020 --> 02:30:57,480
At to the gym that I used to go to,
I'd walk in there at any given time,

3169
02:30:57,660 --> 02:31:00,030
the rock would be there,
alec baldwin,

3170
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:03,000
the sweetlife life is zack and cody 
kids.

3171
02:31:03,240 --> 02:31:06,840
And then every famous porn star.
But it was really weird because you just

3172
02:31:06,841 --> 02:31:11,841
see and tHen you know,
you just signed a treadmill next to the 

3173
02:31:11,841 --> 02:31:12,120
rock and after like week two,
it was just like,

3174
02:31:12,890 --> 02:31:14,100
yeah,
you get used to some people.

3175
02:31:14,790 --> 02:31:19,790
I watched a guy go up to the rock,
the rock always did you have headphones 

3176
02:31:20,341 --> 02:31:22,020
on.
And when he's like lifting,

3177
02:31:22,050 --> 02:31:24,150
he kinda has this look of,
I'm,

3178
02:31:24,230 --> 02:31:25,580
I'm working out,
you know,

3179
02:31:25,590 --> 02:31:27,600
it kind of has to.
So uh,

3180
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:31,320
so this guy walks over to him and says,
hey,

3181
02:31:31,830 --> 02:31:33,630
could you,
could you help me out?

3182
02:31:34,050 --> 02:31:35,490
And you saw him,
he took off his head,

3183
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:36,720
you know,
he was mid workout.

3184
02:31:36,721 --> 02:31:39,750
He's like doing squats or something.
Ask somebody.

3185
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:44,610
But the rocks is probably one of the 
nicest guys I've ever seen.

3186
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:48,840
Like on a side note,
like I've seen him on flight at 6:00

3187
02:31:48,841 --> 02:31:53,841
in the morning tea with his head up 
against the window and hat down and 

3188
02:31:53,841 --> 02:31:55,110
little kids tapping on them and then he 
put his head up,

3189
02:31:55,270 --> 02:32:00,270
throw on the smile,
signed for the kid and then go back to 

3190
02:32:00,270 --> 02:32:03,591
sleep for a second to the next kid and 
he's never not seen him be cool like 

3191
02:32:03,591 --> 02:32:07,521
that.
So at the gym he walks over to the guy 

3192
02:32:07,521 --> 02:32:08,280
and I'm now I'm just like staring at the
guy goes,

3193
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:11,730
I'm going to do these preacher curves.
Can you tell me if I'm doing them right?

3194
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:16,860
Oh girls like the one,
like probably the only weight lifting 

3195
02:32:16,860 --> 02:32:21,351
technique.
You don't need actual post my like a 

3196
02:32:21,351 --> 02:32:21,540
squat.
You could go my doing tHis.

3197
02:32:21,541 --> 02:32:24,250
Okay.
But like a curl I felt so bad for.

3198
02:32:24,500 --> 02:32:27,780
And then mid curl can we be friends?
So what are you doing later?

3199
02:32:27,781 --> 02:32:32,781
I mean we need to go.
Let me leave a voice message from my 

3200
02:32:32,781 --> 02:32:32,781
wife.
Will you go facetime with my kids?

3201
02:32:34,860 --> 02:32:39,860
He's hercules.
Kids get very excited to facetime with 

3202
02:32:39,860 --> 02:32:43,320
hercules' girl's dead man.
That dude who jump on a stairmaster or 

3203
02:32:43,320 --> 02:32:45,360
whatever,
there was no nobody next to him.

3204
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:48,210
Within seconds there'll be dumb,
dumb,

3205
02:32:48,220 --> 02:32:48,640
dumb,
dumb,

3206
02:32:48,641 --> 02:32:48,990
dumb,
dumb.

3207
02:32:49,060 --> 02:32:49,720
Everybody.
Yeah.

3208
02:32:49,770 --> 02:32:52,590
He's a super huge dude.
He's gigantic.

3209
02:32:53,610 --> 02:32:58,610
Could you want me to.
I've seen them in different phases of a 

3210
02:32:58,610 --> 02:32:58,610
pussy magnet almost.
I mean,

3211
02:32:58,610 --> 02:33:02,720
it must be like a black hole,
like a singularity of sexual attraction.

3212
02:33:03,750 --> 02:33:05,560
He's like six foot three,
right?

3213
02:33:05,970 --> 02:33:10,970
Six threeish boarish.
Someone else built like a brick shit 

3214
02:33:10,970 --> 02:33:12,990
house and he's a movie star goes lower.
Seen those pictures that he would.

3215
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:16,620
Probably not that he posts pictures on 
instagram when he's working out.

3216
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:21,680
Yeah.
Like his cheat days are like the 

3217
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:25,880
legendary legendary for big,
huge pizzas and never seen anything like

3218
02:33:26,441 --> 02:33:27,860
that in your life.
Yeah.

3219
02:33:27,861 --> 02:33:30,970
IT's legendary.
What is this car?

3220
02:33:31,510 --> 02:33:34,680
That's just the part of the diet is just
like one day a week you can eat.

3221
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:36,150
Like,
I'm just like crazy man.

3222
02:33:36,340 --> 02:33:37,320
Yeah.
Some guys do that.

3223
02:33:37,321 --> 02:33:39,930
They're super strIct except one day and 
um,

3224
02:33:39,931 --> 02:33:42,300
one day they just go off your brow.
You know?

3225
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:45,810
Remember when eddie bravo yesterday and 
sunday,

3226
02:33:45,811 --> 02:33:48,390
I think it was,
and he would just the ice cream,

3227
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:51,330
huge sundaes pizza.
He would be like atkins,

3228
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:54,420
atkins for five days,
six days rather.

3229
02:33:54,510 --> 02:33:56,790
Sometimes you'd go five days to do like 
two cheat days,

3230
02:33:57,120 --> 02:33:59,250
but it would be super strict on those 
atkins days,

3231
02:33:59,251 --> 02:34:04,251
like all salads and meats and very 
little carbohydrate other than like 

3232
02:34:04,251 --> 02:34:06,060
natural carbs.
So would come from fruits and vegetables

3233
02:34:06,061 --> 02:34:07,160
and things like that.
Yeah,

3234
02:34:07,220 --> 02:34:10,320
and then the the last day was just 
donuts and pizza.

3235
02:34:10,321 --> 02:34:15,321
You go off like a rocket and you didn't 
give a fuck and he lived for those days 

3236
02:34:15,321 --> 02:34:17,770
and then they started starting those 
days like midnight on thursday,

3237
02:34:19,730 --> 02:34:21,340
three days and four.
Then it's like,

3238
02:34:21,341 --> 02:34:24,470
I'm on atkins one day a week.
They do it on mondays.

3239
02:34:25,080 --> 02:34:26,440
Atkins is weird,
man.

3240
02:34:27,130 --> 02:34:28,870
That's not.
Nobody really follows that anymore.

3241
02:34:29,430 --> 02:34:32,220
Like people would say that it gives him 
bad breath and I guess the.

3242
02:34:32,221 --> 02:34:34,760
The idea behind it is if you have no 
carbs like that,

3243
02:34:34,780 --> 02:34:38,470
your body just starts to living off fats
and you can do it I guess as long as you

3244
02:34:38,471 --> 02:34:43,471
like.
Really make sure you have the right 

3245
02:34:43,471 --> 02:34:43,471
amount of fats.
I tried it for a little while,

3246
02:34:43,471 --> 02:34:44,590
man,
and it made me really feel weak,

3247
02:34:44,860 --> 02:34:48,880
like I didn't feel good cutting out like
potatoes and all that stuff.

3248
02:34:49,870 --> 02:34:53,440
I think cutting it the best I've ever 
felt with like an experimental diet.

3249
02:34:53,590 --> 02:34:58,510
It was cutting out gluten and I know 
that's like a fad thing to say like that

3250
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:01,240
and it's so sad that people don't wanna 
admit anymore,

3251
02:35:01,540 --> 02:35:04,270
but the reality is this is the simple 
reality.

3252
02:35:04,540 --> 02:35:07,780
The reality about breads is they break 
down and become sugar.

3253
02:35:07,810 --> 02:35:10,510
Pasta becomes sugar.
That's the real issue.

3254
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:15,720
I think more so than like gluten 
intolerance and a lot of these other 

3255
02:35:15,720 --> 02:35:19,021
things that people claim.
I think the amount of gluten that we 

3256
02:35:19,021 --> 02:35:20,860
have in our diet from sandwiches and 
breads and pastas and things along those

3257
02:35:20,861 --> 02:35:25,861
lines,
the amount is a lot of sugar that goes 

3258
02:35:25,861 --> 02:35:26,950
into your body and that's just not 
healthy.

3259
02:35:27,130 --> 02:35:30,310
It's just spikes your levels.
Your insulin gets all out of whack.

3260
02:35:30,610 --> 02:35:35,380
It's just not healthy to have a regular 
sugar intake of processed wheat,

3261
02:35:35,650 --> 02:35:40,650
you know all that shit.
That's like a normal part of the 

3262
02:35:40,650 --> 02:35:41,710
american diet.
It's just not that good for you,

3263
02:35:42,190 --> 02:35:44,800
but you know a little bit every now and 
then was no big deal.

3264
02:35:44,890 --> 02:35:47,770
It's like if as long as you eat mostly 
like healthy foods,

3265
02:35:47,771 --> 02:35:50,680
you could fuck around a little bit every
now and then your body's getting all the

3266
02:35:50,681 --> 02:35:55,681
nutrients it needs and you just sort of 
rewarding it with that other stuff is 

3267
02:35:55,681 --> 02:35:59,581
the problem is when people have a diet 
that's primarily reward and then 

3268
02:35:59,581 --> 02:36:00,910
occasionally they fuck around with some 
lettuce.

3269
02:36:02,470 --> 02:36:06,010
You know what I mean?
Like that'S smoothie smoothie today.

3270
02:36:06,011 --> 02:36:11,011
Some good fucking people.
Especially if you're working all the 

3271
02:36:11,011 --> 02:36:11,011
time,
you're tired,

3272
02:36:11,011 --> 02:36:11,050
you know,
you're at the office.

3273
02:36:11,051 --> 02:36:13,090
I'm just going to grab some jack in the 
box the way over.

3274
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:15,120
You can get in that fucking,
you know,

3275
02:36:15,250 --> 02:36:17,660
I'm trying to figure out on the road.
This is the,

3276
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:18,320
how do.
I mean I'm,

3277
02:36:18,630 --> 02:36:21,010
I'm skinny,
but I'm starting to become skinny fat.

3278
02:36:21,190 --> 02:36:23,780
Like do workout big.
Um,

3279
02:36:23,800 --> 02:36:25,270
yeah,
do a little bit.

3280
02:36:25,330 --> 02:36:30,330
You don't box with anybody anymore.
You're saying stuff that I've kind of 

3281
02:36:30,330 --> 02:36:30,800
just a workout.
I don't know.

3282
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:35,940
I'm kind of bored with them,
so I'm trying to figure out what my new 

3283
02:36:35,940 --> 02:36:35,940
thing is.
When you get like a personal trainer and

3284
02:36:35,940 --> 02:36:36,610
in those towns,
you know,

3285
02:36:36,611 --> 02:36:38,560
you could do that.
find someone at the gym,

3286
02:36:38,561 --> 02:36:40,510
they'll put you through like a weight 
lift and work out.

3287
02:36:40,510 --> 02:36:42,640
That'd be fun.
You'll have forced you to do it.

3288
02:36:42,641 --> 02:36:44,530
So I need like a,
like a.

3289
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:45,620
Yeah.
Because my,

3290
02:36:45,640 --> 02:36:49,210
my new thing was I'm going to go thing,
I'm going to do pull ups,

3291
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:50,770
dips,
pushups,

3292
02:36:50,771 --> 02:36:55,771
and then I'm going to do sprints and 
then that's going to be it just in case 

3293
02:36:55,771 --> 02:36:57,280
I ever get arrested.
Then I've started my prison workouts.

3294
02:36:57,750 --> 02:36:59,580
Um,
just because I don't.

3295
02:36:59,650 --> 02:37:04,650
Yeah,
I got to figure out something because 

3296
02:37:04,650 --> 02:37:04,650
I'm at that line,
you know,

3297
02:37:04,650 --> 02:37:04,650
when,
when you go.

3298
02:37:04,650 --> 02:37:06,850
Okay.
I think everybody at some point,

3299
02:37:06,910 --> 02:37:11,910
if you look at them,
they look like they've given up and 

3300
02:37:11,910 --> 02:37:14,581
sometimes that decision is,
is later in their lives where I think 

3301
02:37:14,581 --> 02:37:16,070
I'm teetering at that,
at that decision

3302
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:21,070
going,
I might just give up one doughnut that 

3303
02:37:21,070 --> 02:37:22,380
never work out and just be done.
Um,

3304
02:37:22,550 --> 02:37:25,220
what was that book that you gave bill?
Some workout book?

3305
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:26,930
Bodyweight workout book?
Yeah.

3306
02:37:26,931 --> 02:37:30,200
It's just um,
her name is like,

3307
02:37:30,201 --> 02:37:35,201
it's a weird like della rae,
r I e like if you go visual workouts in 

3308
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:39,770
just type that name,
it's called visual workouts.

3309
02:37:39,950 --> 02:37:43,790
It's 100 at her book Is like a hundred 
body weight.

3310
02:37:44,030 --> 02:37:47,960
She's just rushing chick.
But what she does is she has,

3311
02:37:48,020 --> 02:37:51,680
she calls the workout like,
like movie titles,

3312
02:37:51,681 --> 02:37:56,300
like highlander on batman.
So then batman will be like 40 punches,

3313
02:37:56,660 --> 02:37:58,420
40 pushups,
you know,

3314
02:37:58,460 --> 02:38:02,090
she has a whole thing and then you have,
do you go through it three times?

3315
02:38:02,091 --> 02:38:07,091
Seven times.
So for me it's just like a fun no 

3316
02:38:07,091 --> 02:38:07,091
brainer.
I can do it in the,

3317
02:38:07,091 --> 02:38:11,560
in my hotel room.
I just turn the page and she gives away 

3318
02:38:11,560 --> 02:38:11,560
the book for free on our website.

3319
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:14,870
You can download the pdfs.
I ordered the book from amazon because I

3320
02:38:14,871 --> 02:38:16,550
didn't feel like printing it up on my 
printer.

3321
02:38:16,580 --> 02:38:17,960
That's so cool.
What's it called again?

3322
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:20,450
Go.
Um,

3323
02:38:21,170 --> 02:38:23,180
hold on.

3324
02:38:23,910 --> 02:38:27,680

Okay,

3328
02:38:31,730 --> 02:38:35,000
One video of hers.
She's like just rushing chicken.

3329
02:38:35,001 --> 02:38:37,800
She used to be a fighter.
She used to think,

3330
02:38:37,850 --> 02:38:41,710
do you know ne ne I l a?
Yeah.

3331

02:39:09,260 --> 02:39:14,260
I think.
Here's her thing where she gives like 

3340
02:39:14,260 --> 02:39:14,870
you'll see some of these workouts that 
have 500,000

3341
02:39:14,871 --> 02:39:19,871
downloads and then she has a a donate 
button and then she goes,

3342
02:39:20,211 --> 02:39:23,060
I don't try to sell you anything on here
if you ever feel like donating.

3343
02:39:23,180 --> 02:39:25,940
So I think it's a numbers game.
If 500,000

3344
02:39:25,941 --> 02:39:28,700
people downloaded her,
her ab challenge,

3345
02:39:29,390 --> 02:39:32,010
you know,
in a few of those people go,

3346
02:39:32,011 --> 02:39:37,011
you know what,
I'm going to throw her 20 bucks for 

3347
02:39:37,011 --> 02:39:37,011
giving out.
I bet you she does.

3348
02:39:37,011 --> 02:39:37,011
Okay.
Yeah.

3349
02:39:37,011 --> 02:39:40,140
Well now maybe she'll get more,
you know,

3350
02:39:40,190 --> 02:39:45,190
it sounds cool though.
I liked that last one you circled was 

3351
02:39:45,190 --> 02:39:47,090
the pillow one.
She has a lot of like weird stuff.

3352
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:52,120
Like I say like throw nice to the pillow
pillow strikes like you're walking a 

3353
02:39:53,661 --> 02:39:55,460
wall with a pillow pillow.

3354
02:39:55,460 --> 02:39:57,440
Lunges.
How weird.

3355
02:39:57,680 --> 02:40:02,680
But she does that with like your,
your carry on luggage and then she has 

3356
02:40:02,680 --> 02:40:05,981
these other workouts where you just put 
like four strips of tape on the ground 

3357
02:40:06,741 --> 02:40:09,260
and you do a bunch of stuff with that.
You do.

3358
02:40:09,620 --> 02:40:13,020
So I just,
paige and I pick whatever you.

3359
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:16,340
I flipped the book and I like do that.
Like throw a dart and guts.

3360
02:40:16,350 --> 02:40:18,120
Pretty dope.
Here's the love it man.

3361
02:40:18,540 --> 02:40:19,920
It's pretty good stuff.
Love it.

3362
02:40:20,610 --> 02:40:23,800
And then you can change up the,
you know,

3363
02:40:23,801 --> 02:40:28,801
the,
I haven't been able to do one of hers 

3364
02:40:28,801 --> 02:40:28,801
more than like three times through 
because then I,

3365
02:40:28,801 --> 02:40:29,460
then I get bored.
But uh,

3366
02:40:29,990 --> 02:40:34,990
you know,
he could add more challenges to it and 

3367
02:40:34,990 --> 02:40:34,990
stuff.
That's interesting.

3368
02:40:34,990 --> 02:40:39,080
I like that she's doing it that way,
that she's a releasing them for free 

3369
02:40:39,080 --> 02:40:42,021
online and ordering,
like having like a paypal button or 

3370
02:40:42,021 --> 02:40:42,021
something like that.

3371
02:40:42,021 --> 02:40:42,021
That's cool.
Yeah.

3372
02:40:42,021 --> 02:40:42,590
If you want to give her five bucks for 
it.

3373
02:40:42,630 --> 02:40:46,710
But she has like 90 day challenges where
she has one of those visuals everyday.

3374
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:48,970
You do some.
So she gives you these crazy.

3375
02:40:49,610 --> 02:40:51,600
Yeah.
I don't know what she's doing there.

3376
02:40:51,750 --> 02:40:54,390
Oh,
that's the wrong 2000,

3377
02:40:54,391 --> 02:40:58,080
250 pushups in seven days.
oh my god.

3378
02:40:58,850 --> 02:41:03,240
She don't want her choke you.
It was a fucking tremendous job.

3379
02:41:03,241 --> 02:41:04,080
Yes,
she used to do.

3380
02:41:04,081 --> 02:41:09,081
I think it keeps kickboxer in jujitsu or
something because she has a lot of 

3381
02:41:09,081 --> 02:41:09,420
fighting bodyweight exercises,
man,

3382
02:41:09,421 --> 02:41:10,940
just yoga.
If you know,

3383
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:13,200
I have a yoga book that I bring with me 
some time on the road now.

3384
02:41:13,210 --> 02:41:18,210
Also have yoga cards and I just started 
using it myself like 10 cards and go 

3385
02:41:18,210 --> 02:41:22,911
through these 10,
10 different poses for doing plug in 90 

3386
02:41:22,911 --> 02:41:24,630
count.
I like hold each pose for a 90 count.

3387
02:41:25,170 --> 02:41:27,310
We do a like an ipad one.
Oh yeah,

3388
02:41:27,340 --> 02:41:28,260
no,
there's a couple.

3389
02:41:28,370 --> 02:41:33,370
my wife,
we do yoga every night like we were 

3390
02:41:33,370 --> 02:41:33,370
stuck.
We started with ddp yoga.

3391
02:41:33,370 --> 02:41:35,670
Ddps good that that was my first thing.
I go,

3392
02:41:35,700 --> 02:41:36,720
okay,
I'm going to do yoga.

3393
02:41:36,721 --> 02:41:38,910
explain ddp do people don't know what 
you're talking about.

3394
02:41:38,940 --> 02:41:43,940
Ddp is diamond dallas page from 
wrestling fame and he had this yoga that

3395
02:41:45,211 --> 02:41:50,211
he created.
It was originally called like every guy 

3396
02:41:50,211 --> 02:41:52,791
yoga because the whole thing is.
It's not like artsy fartsy your momma's 

3397
02:41:52,791 --> 02:41:52,791
yoga.
Yeah,

3398
02:41:52,791 --> 02:41:53,830
exactly that.
Yeah.

3399
02:41:53,940 --> 02:41:55,230
And then,
but when you watch him,

3400
02:41:55,231 --> 02:41:58,260
he like actually is instructions really 
cool.

3401
02:41:58,261 --> 02:42:00,180
It's not.
You do like hulk out,

3402
02:42:00,181 --> 02:42:05,181
so you do like of this guy.
Then hawk it out and then you just do 

3403
02:42:05,620 --> 02:42:09,330
and then you stretch the whole and it's.
It's hard.

3404
02:42:09,530 --> 02:42:10,920
Oh,
it's definitely a lot of them.

3405
02:42:10,921 --> 02:42:12,660
I have to like,
I have to go to a knee and go,

3406
02:42:12,661 --> 02:42:17,661
okay,
and then you keep doing it for a couple 

3407
02:42:17,661 --> 02:42:17,661
of weeks.

3408
02:42:17,661 --> 02:42:17,661
You're like,
okay,

3409
02:42:17,661 --> 02:42:19,050
now I can hold its.
I think yoga out of.

3410
02:42:19,051 --> 02:42:24,051
I mean I'm not an expert at all,
but I think if you stick with yoga 

3411
02:42:24,051 --> 02:42:25,560
consistently your whole life,
you're going to be like staying,

3412
02:42:25,950 --> 02:42:30,950
you know,
at the end where you're not going to 

3413
02:42:30,950 --> 02:42:30,950
bust the hip when you're like 90.
You know what I mean?

3414
02:42:30,950 --> 02:42:34,470
Definitely something that's a lot more 
difficult to do than people think it is.

3415
02:42:34,730 --> 02:42:37,290
I can't really good word.
I can't do hardly anything.

3416
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:39,870
It's unbelievable how unflexible land.
Well,

3417
02:42:39,871 --> 02:42:44,871
yoga iS just,
it's a lot more difficult than people 

3418
02:42:44,871 --> 02:42:44,871
think it is.
It's like,

3419
02:42:44,871 --> 02:42:49,011
it seems like it would be easy to do.
Like all those indian dudes are all 

3420
02:42:49,011 --> 02:42:49,011
skinny,
you know,

3421
02:42:49,011 --> 02:42:49,770
and you look at chicks are all doing it.
You're like,

3422
02:42:49,771 --> 02:42:52,500
well this isn't going to be like fucking
running up a mountain.

3423
02:42:52,590 --> 02:42:53,550
But yeah,
It is.

3424
02:42:53,590 --> 02:42:56,820
It's own way.
My wife's a mom.

3425
02:42:57,940 --> 02:42:59,610
Oh she,
I don't know.

3426
02:42:59,700 --> 02:43:02,190
I don't want to operate,
but late sixties,

3427
02:43:02,191 --> 02:43:03,900
maybe even seventies,
japanese woman.

3428
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:06,610
She can.
She puts her hand like that and they can

3429
02:43:07,040 --> 02:43:11,140
go perfectly straight up just holding 
like,

3430
02:43:11,230 --> 02:43:12,000
that's incredible.
She's

3431
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:13,150
70.
whoa.

3432
02:43:13,240 --> 02:43:15,310
Yeah.
As long as you keep using it,

3433
02:43:15,311 --> 02:43:17,440
man.
I can fucking stallone.

3434
02:43:18,030 --> 02:43:21,560
I mean that's the most ridiculous 
example ever of a grampy.

3435
02:43:21,790 --> 02:43:23,980
He's like 67,
68 years old,

3436
02:43:23,981 --> 02:43:25,060
I think.
At least.

3437
02:43:25,360 --> 02:43:28,390
How old is that dude now you always got 
to be at least.

3438
02:43:28,710 --> 02:43:30,130
I would say 68,
right?

3439
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:31,960
Let's say 68.
Seventy two.

3440
02:43:32,110 --> 02:43:37,110
Seventy two,
72 while he's going to be eventually if 

3441
02:43:37,110 --> 02:43:38,110
you stayed in the law,
but when people like,

3442
02:43:38,111 --> 02:43:39,280
oh,
he's going to get off those steroids.

3443
02:43:39,281 --> 02:43:42,290
Like what are you talking about?
What's he's to what?

3444
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:43,660
Sixty eight,
68?

3445
02:43:44,030 --> 02:43:44,830
Yeah,
he is.

3446
02:43:44,860 --> 02:43:46,060
I mean,
it's ridiculous.

3447
02:43:46,061 --> 02:43:49,090
The Idea that if somehow or another he 
got off of them like what?

3448
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:53,110
He's going to like live 70 years,
got to run.

3449
02:43:53,200 --> 02:43:55,570
I'm doing all that stuff.
When I'm don't know.

3450
02:43:55,710 --> 02:44:00,710
I think I'm going to get myself a couple
more years and then I figure I can 

3451
02:44:00,710 --> 02:44:00,710
outrun all the side effects.

3452
02:44:00,710 --> 02:44:05,340
Well,
he broke his neck when he was filming 

3453
02:44:05,340 --> 02:44:08,380
the expendables and he was like 65 years
old.

3454
02:44:08,620 --> 02:44:13,620
He fucking fell like they were doing 
like some stunt and land on his fucking 

3455
02:44:13,620 --> 02:44:17,941
neck and snapped his neck.
And he's got like disks that are fused 

3456
02:44:17,941 --> 02:44:18,040
in his neck.
He liked put up an x ray online.

3457
02:44:18,041 --> 02:44:20,050
It showed it.
Here's the crazy shit ever.

3458
02:44:20,170 --> 02:44:23,020
It's going to a fused disc in his neck 
and he's 67,

3459
02:44:23,021 --> 02:44:26,620
68 years old.
What the fuck man?

3460
02:44:27,010 --> 02:44:30,940
Like when we were kids,
a 68 year old dude was basically dead.

3461
02:44:31,150 --> 02:44:32,010
Right.
You know,

3462
02:44:32,270 --> 02:44:34,870
it's like barely hanging on.
And when,

3463
02:44:34,871 --> 02:44:36,340
um,
when they come up with,

3464
02:44:36,540 --> 02:44:39,020
if you've seen that thing they're doing 
with mice that,

3465
02:44:39,021 --> 02:44:40,520
that gene doping.
No,

3466
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:40,880
no,
no,

3467
02:44:40,910 --> 02:44:41,560
no.
Blood,

3468
02:44:41,620 --> 02:44:46,620
just blood.
They're taking the mice have young mice 

3469
02:44:46,620 --> 02:44:47,580
and introducing it to old mice putting 
in an old mouse.

3470
02:44:47,580 --> 02:44:52,010
His body and the old mouse starts 
literally going back in time like,

3471
02:44:52,390 --> 02:44:54,160
yeah.
And they've started,

3472
02:44:54,310 --> 02:44:59,310
they've started doing clinical trials 
with people and are having positive 

3473
02:44:59,310 --> 02:44:59,480
results.
Eating babies would make us no,

3474
02:44:59,700 --> 02:45:03,490
no need transfusions,
but here's the thing,

3475
02:45:04,300 --> 02:45:08,770
there was an episode of a goddamn.
I quote this website,

3476
02:45:08,771 --> 02:45:13,771
this podcast all the time,
but it's not like I'm not like their 

3477
02:45:13,771 --> 02:45:13,771
publicist or anything.
I just really think it's awesOme.

3478
02:45:13,771 --> 02:45:16,180
Radiolab.
Radiolab is one of the best podcasts.

3479
02:45:16,181 --> 02:45:18,490
Amazing.
So informative and interesting.

3480
02:45:18,491 --> 02:45:20,950
It's like the sound effects,
like really well engineered.

3481
02:45:21,010 --> 02:45:23,530
IT's like the opposite of like how we do
it.

3482
02:45:23,531 --> 02:45:25,150
We just start and you know,
we fuck around,

3483
02:45:25,151 --> 02:45:27,010
we talk and then we end it with 
radiolab.

3484
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:32,040
Everything's planned out.
It's all really like well edited and 

3485
02:45:32,040 --> 02:45:35,040
research and they brIng in different 
sound effects and different people and 

3486
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:37,831
they have anyway,
they had this one on blood and the 

3487
02:45:37,831 --> 02:45:41,041
reality of like blood donating and then 
they sell your blood and a lot of the 

3488
02:45:41,041 --> 02:45:45,301
blood that you donate doesn't ever go to
patients and a lot of it doesn't go.

3489
02:45:45,551 --> 02:45:50,551
Like if you donate blood,
they're actually going to sell your 

3490
02:45:50,551 --> 02:45:50,551
donated blood to other hospitals for a 
profit.

3491
02:45:51,280 --> 02:45:53,830
Yeah,
it's crazy.

3492
02:45:54,130 --> 02:45:56,290
It's really crazy.
If you.

3493
02:45:56,460 --> 02:45:58,780
I'm trying to remember the episode here.
I'll,

3494
02:45:58,781 --> 02:46:00,820
I'll said radio lab.
Yeah.

3495
02:46:00,821 --> 02:46:03,760
Radio lab episode on blood.
I'll google that real quick.

3496
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:08,820
He always wondered about that because I 
used to give plasma like twice a week 

3497
02:46:08,820 --> 02:46:09,690
just to make money and I always wondered
if this was

3498
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:15,190
sold or just I was donating.
It never really Made sense that I was 

3499
02:46:15,190 --> 02:46:19,361
getting money for this.
IT's called blood and I think this one 

3500
02:46:19,361 --> 02:46:22,040
deals with uh,
aids as well because there was a guy who

3501
02:46:22,041 --> 02:46:27,041
had hiv and he was doing some art with 
his blood and he got labeled a 

3502
02:46:27,041 --> 02:46:29,450
terrorist.
I think it's one of the same ones,

3503
02:46:29,990 --> 02:46:32,120
but um,
it's really interesting.

3504
02:46:33,240 --> 02:46:35,180
I think that's the episode they would 
like.

3505
02:46:35,181 --> 02:46:35,970
What stuff?
I mean,

3506
02:46:35,971 --> 02:46:40,070
that's season 12 problems had 12 
seasons.

3507
02:46:41,050 --> 02:46:45,680
My god,
what steps can be ready for our bodies,

3508
02:46:45,681 --> 02:46:48,680
you know,
to go back in time a little by the tIme,

3509
02:46:48,681 --> 02:46:51,560
let's say add 20 years from now I'll be 
40,

3510
02:46:51,561 --> 02:46:53,630
50,
I'll be in only my fixtures,

3511
02:46:55,070 --> 02:46:58,730
but I'm hoping by then they'll have 
something go.

3512
02:46:58,731 --> 02:46:59,840
Yeah,
this is a new.

3513
02:46:59,841 --> 02:47:04,841
Yeah,
we figured out how to take your gums 

3514
02:47:04,841 --> 02:47:04,841
then.

3515
02:47:04,841 --> 02:47:04,841
Yeah,
no,

3516
02:47:04,841 --> 02:47:07,770
well what they're doing is apparently 
they're there,

3517
02:47:07,790 --> 02:47:12,790
you know you can take blood out of 
people and you can donate it and your 

3518
02:47:12,790 --> 02:47:15,260
body can produce extra blood.
Like if you take blood out,

3519
02:47:15,261 --> 02:47:18,830
your body replenisHes that blood and if 
you get a bunch of people to do that and

3520
02:47:18,831 --> 02:47:23,831
they sell that blood and say if they're 
young you get like a bunch of college 

3521
02:47:23,831 --> 02:47:25,870
kids to do that to their blood and then 
you take this 20 year olds blood and the

3522
02:47:25,871 --> 02:47:30,871
the introduced into your body or your 
body like literally reverses the aging 

3523
02:47:30,871 --> 02:47:31,160
process.
You start,

3524
02:47:31,161 --> 02:47:36,161
your memory starts working better and 
then conversely when you take old blood 

3525
02:47:36,161 --> 02:47:39,620
and you pour it into a young kid's body,
they start getting sluggish.

3526
02:47:39,740 --> 02:47:42,260
That's the thing that they're not doing 
that with people but they are doing that

3527
02:47:42,261 --> 02:47:43,310
with.
Maybe they are.

3528
02:47:43,550 --> 02:47:45,440
Maybe they aren't doing the people 
because they did it with mice.

3529
02:47:45,500 --> 02:47:47,870
I mean I don't think it would hurt them 
necessarily physically,

3530
02:47:47,871 --> 02:47:48,620
but it might,
you know,

3531
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:53,680
who knows.
We found out a gave kids like fucking 

3532
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:55,990
alzheimer's early or something crazy,
but they're taking old blood with mice 

3533
02:47:56,390 --> 02:47:59,350
and they're introducing it to the young 
mice and it fucks them up for you.

3534
02:47:59,390 --> 02:48:04,390
It sounds like a sCary movie where 
eventually we start harvesting 20 year 

3535
02:48:04,390 --> 02:48:07,901
olds,
so it's kinDa like logan's run in the 

3536
02:48:07,901 --> 02:48:10,691
sense of you can live until you're 20,
But during 20 through 30 or harvest and 

3537
02:48:11,451 --> 02:48:13,400
maybe some guy doesn't want to be 
harvested.

3538
02:48:13,430 --> 02:48:18,430
So he hides and runs well.
They're going to be able to Call it a 

3539
02:48:18,430 --> 02:48:22,300
harvest.
They're going to be able to make 

3540
02:48:22,300 --> 02:48:22,300
artificial organs if they haven't 
already.

3541
02:48:22,300 --> 02:48:22,590
They already can make artificial 
bladder,

3542
02:48:22,591 --> 02:48:27,591
so I know that they're taking skin cells
and they've created an artificial 

3543
02:48:27,591 --> 02:48:28,070
bladder.
If they make artificial organs,

3544
02:48:28,071 --> 02:48:33,071
they're eventually going to move from 
that to an artificial Body without a 

3545
02:48:33,071 --> 02:48:33,071
head.

3546
02:48:33,071 --> 02:48:33,920
You know they're going to have your 
fucking body,

3547
02:48:33,921 --> 02:48:38,921
like an exact version of your body with 
no head and they'll Be able to take 

3548
02:48:38,921 --> 02:48:38,921
stuff from it.
Take lungs.

3549
02:48:38,921 --> 02:48:40,580
Yeah.
These with a three d printer.

3550
02:48:40,581 --> 02:48:42,290
They just.
Which I'm going to get so bad,

3551
02:48:42,350 --> 02:48:43,910
buT I.
I don't know what I would print,

3552
02:48:43,970 --> 02:48:46,880
but it's one of those things and you're 
like,

3553
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:48,260
man,
it would be.

3554
02:48:48,350 --> 02:48:53,350
I saw some kid tHree d printed because I
follow three d printing,

3555
02:48:53,421 --> 02:48:56,150
whatever on twitter.
So they always like tweet,

3556
02:48:56,510 --> 02:48:58,310
you know,
shut some kid.

3557
02:48:58,790 --> 02:49:02,990
Three d printed a laser engraver for 50 
bucks.

3558
02:49:03,020 --> 02:49:06,470
So the laser engraver was like a couple 
thousand dollars.

3559
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:11,560
He printed it on a three d printer,
made it a plastic and then he engraves 

3560
02:49:11,560 --> 02:49:15,090
metal or whatever for some company that 
he just does out of his garage.

3561
02:49:15,091 --> 02:49:17,470
But he's like,
that's what I wantEd.

3562
02:49:17,480 --> 02:49:18,180
A three d printer.

3563
02:49:18,180 --> 02:49:19,330
You can print anything.
I just,

3564
02:49:19,331 --> 02:49:20,990
it would just sit there like a 
stairmaster,

3565
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:24,930
not be used like I wouldn't know,
but they sell it at a office depot.

3566
02:49:24,931 --> 02:49:29,931
They have this thing you put down and 
you can put an object and then it takes 

3567
02:49:29,931 --> 02:49:34,281
a three d picture that's like 2000 bucks
and then a three d printer is,

3568
02:49:35,041 --> 02:49:36,300
you know,
it's plastic.

3569
02:49:36,301 --> 02:49:37,280
It makes sense.
A plastic.

3570
02:49:37,410 --> 02:49:42,410
Yeah.
But now they have all this different 

3571
02:49:42,410 --> 02:49:42,410
stuff.
You can do it for food now,

3572
02:49:42,410 --> 02:49:44,430
like pastas you can create but are 
plastic or wood,

3573
02:49:44,431 --> 02:49:48,120
like they're coming for the future of 
olive garden or restaurants.

3574
02:49:48,121 --> 02:49:53,121
You're just,
the whole kitchen is just going to be 

3575
02:49:53,121 --> 02:49:53,121
printed like you order it.
And scott,

3576
02:49:53,121 --> 02:49:53,830
I want to three d print,
anything you,

3577
02:49:54,030 --> 02:49:55,200
anything that busts in here?
Dude,

3578
02:49:55,201 --> 02:50:00,201
you can just three d print and remake.
I bet it's the future of objects 

3579
02:50:00,201 --> 02:50:00,201
themselves.

3580
02:50:00,201 --> 02:50:01,300
I bet we're not going to log into going 
to have store.

3581
02:50:01,301 --> 02:50:03,900
So just going to download the plans for 
something like on itunes.

3582
02:50:03,960 --> 02:50:06,150
There's a,
you don't have to look up the video,

3583
02:50:06,151 --> 02:50:10,820
but there's the three d printed a house 
and this huge,

3584
02:50:10,870 --> 02:50:14,970
this huge thing that just comes in,
like build completely prints a house.

3585
02:50:15,410 --> 02:50:17,550
Seeing the nuts.
And then uh,

3586
02:50:17,640 --> 02:50:20,730
I saw my wife was looking at a shoe one 
where a company,

3587
02:50:20,731 --> 02:50:22,020
exactly what you said.
Go,

3588
02:50:22,050 --> 02:50:23,760
here's your shoes.
And then you go,

3589
02:50:23,761 --> 02:50:25,300
I want purple.
The,

3590
02:50:25,470 --> 02:50:25,980
you know,
I'm like,

3591
02:50:26,400 --> 02:50:28,530
I need a night shoot because I'm going 
on blah blah blah.

3592
02:50:28,531 --> 02:50:31,760
And you can,
you get the pair of shoes is printed,

3593
02:50:32,410 --> 02:50:33,930
you know,
this is like we're making it all work.

3594
02:50:33,940 --> 02:50:35,370
It's a big deal.
But in 10 years from now,

3595
02:50:35,371 --> 02:50:40,371
it's going to be like,
remember when we figured out smoke 

3596
02:50:40,371 --> 02:50:41,570
signals?
John heifer,

3597
02:50:41,650 --> 02:50:43,760
we're out of time.
A pleasure.

3598
02:50:43,770 --> 02:50:47,130
Always a pleasure.
My dare you.

3599
02:50:47,160 --> 02:50:49,260
