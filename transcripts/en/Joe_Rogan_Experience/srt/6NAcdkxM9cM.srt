1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,170
I interviewed this guy recently
talking about animal stuff.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,561
He,

3
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:07,950
uh,

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,950
he was doing his phd in University
of Pennsylvania and he was working in

5
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:13,651
psychology,

6
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:17,160
but there were chimps involved
in his research and so they,

7
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:17,400
like,

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,570
they would come into these cages,

9
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:21,690
but they had this big area
outside back behind the cages.

10
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:21,931
Right.

11
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:25,800
We're so like at night they would go hang
out and there were trees and stuff and

12
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:26,634
whatever.

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,960
So he would hang out until everybody
went home and he was alone.

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,650
And then he'd sneak back into
the area where the chimps were.

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,490
And he told this hilarious story
where he's with his champion.

16
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:39,960
He'd let go back there and you know,

17
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,520
smoke a joint at the end of the day.

18
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:42,360
And the chimps are wondering,

19
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:42,870
right.

20
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,770
And one day this chimp comes over and
sits down next to him and he's smoking a

21
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:48,490
joint and the chimp reaches,

22
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,873
no,

23
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,020
he has not get this champion.

24
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,020
The joke to the gym.

25
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:54,511
No,

26
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,470
it just hits it.

27
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:56,400
It gives it back to,

28
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:57,960
oh my God,

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,590
that,

30
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,630
that would be the greatest
video ever on youtube.

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,660
But Dude,

32
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,040
get,

33
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,200
there's one of a chimp fucking a frog.

34
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:04,901
Have you ever seen him at all?

35
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:06,120
I have is kind of sad.

36
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:06,954
Yeah.

37
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,180
Not for the chimp,

38
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,140
but,

39
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,950
but one of a chimp
smoking joint with a dude.

40
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,940
Especially a hippie.

41
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,311
Right.

42
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:16,260
Don't be the ultimate.

43
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,460
Don't bog garden man.

44
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,140
And if he did Bogart or
what are you going to do?

45
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,980
You know,

46
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,880
give the chimp to joint.

47
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:21,510
Shut the fuck.

48
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,990
Exactly.

49
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,950
Where rips your arms off.
