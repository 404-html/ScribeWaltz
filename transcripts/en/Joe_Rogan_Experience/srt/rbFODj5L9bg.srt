1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,860
Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,570
sort of like what you were talking about,

3
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,510
this people that have this simplistic
idea that all you have to do is get Donald

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,250
Trump high on dmt and
he's gonna see the light.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,160
That's not necessarily the case.

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,670
Not necessarily the case.

7
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,530
I think it would be wasted on him.

8
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,480
I think we would have to do at least

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,660
at least an indwelling catheter may be
two or three hours of continuous dmt.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,243
Fusion.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,293
Sorry,

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,270
wrong,

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:29,990
wrong term.

14
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,640
Why intravenous,

15
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:32,580
but it's very,

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,740
very freudian decided
to go through his dick.

17
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,360
That is hilarious.

18
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,573
No,

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,480
we'll.

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,630
We'll go through the vein.

21
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,980
No,

22
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,281
man.

23
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:44,990
I think he might have
nailed it the first time.

24
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,840
Might be the way to get it.

25
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,940
Maybe the way to get it to them in some
perfect Russian robot fuck doll who just

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,040
locks them up and you know.

27
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,090
Right when he gets inside.

28
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,483
There you go.

29
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,820
She gets them in full guard.

30
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,780
Locks in place and catheter delivery.

31
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,453
Wow.

32
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:05,541
Yeah.

33
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:06,810
Maybe they can program it like,

34
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,150
like Dmt,

35
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,090
like little nanobots that
go right through the hole,

36
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,390
right through the penis
hole right into the system.

37
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,580
They just run out of her
right in there and he's,

38
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,310
he just takes off.

39
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,420
But again,

40
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,160
there has to be something there.

41
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:23,940
Somebody animated that have an effect.

42
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:24,370
Please.

43
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,203
So many anime.

44
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,060
I know there's somebody out
there that wants to do it.

45
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,280
The Internet is sort of
exposed all this stuff.

46
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:34,170
So that was the end of it.

47
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:35,661
That literal use,

48
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:36,470
the end design and tall.

49
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,120
And how much has it
dropped off since then?

50
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,531
Well,

51
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:43,670
it's been estimated by people who
would know that there's maybe 20,000

52
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:44,840
scientologists right now.

53
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,100
What was it at its peak?

54
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,950
I think it was in the early nineties.

55
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:48,980
You bought 100,000.

56
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,730
Wow.

57
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,480
Yeah,

58
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,330
20,000.

59
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,513
That's like a,

60
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,680
a good Louis ck concert.

61
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,390
Well,

62
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,223
the thing is

63
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,890
most people I get that international
base are people who have been around for

64
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:04,401
25,

65
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:04,701
30,

66
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:05,181
35,

67
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:06,014
40 years.

68
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,483
And you think,

69
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,301
okay,

70
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:09,380
how could you live this way?

71
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,491
Look,

72
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:12,020
most people are not going to do what I do.

73
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,020
I was 76 one 76 years old when I left.

74
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:15,650
Okay.

75
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,930
And you were 75 when
they give you 75 gifts.

76
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,450
So you like this?

77
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:19,941
Not Enough.

78
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:20,990
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

79
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,070
I need.

80
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,903
No,

81
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,310
you mean not enough gifts to get in 76.

82
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:25,521
Right.

83
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,354
You got.

84
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,020
Listen,

85
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,853
I

86
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,021
actually,

87
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll tell you something that happened
and I brought this just to show you and

88
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,890
have a little.

89
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,670
What is that?

90
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,360
Kindle.

91
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,193
Okay.

92
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,790
Are you allowed to have those in there?

93
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,343
No.

94
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,333
Really.

95
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,380
You can't have a kindle
and I didn't know why.

96
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,510
I didn't know why.

97
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,820
What happened is this.

98
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,290
David gave me this Kendall

99
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,760
and the security guards were doing.

100
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:54,620
They're not trying to get it away from me,

101
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,800
but they wouldn't come in strong
army because David is the man.

102
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,400
So David gave it to you in the security
guards are trying to take it away from

103
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:03,640
you.

104
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,473
Why?

105
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,321
Okay.

106
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:05,980
I didn't know.

107
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,491
Did you tell them?

108
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:09,630
It was loaded up with l Ron
Hubbard books where it was.

109
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,480
It was his fiction books that
he put in your field earth?

110
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,141
No,

111
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:15,730
not battlefield or northern machinery,

112
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,290
but the other earlier fiction,

113
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,170
which I thought was pretty interesting,

114
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:21,004
but anyway,

115
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,420
they're trying to get the says,

116
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:22,571
Hey,

117
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:23,410
fuck you man.

118
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,041
They gave me,

119
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:24,790
this is mine,

120
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,400
you know.

121
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,560
Oh,

122
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:25,841
okay.

123
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:26,830
Ron Did back off.

124
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,910
Now one day I'm reading something and
there's a feature on here where you see

125
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,850
this is the camera on that now?

126
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,460
Yeah.

127
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,293
Okay.

128
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,170
You see this little

129
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,030
switch here that goes this way,

130
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,440
this way up.

131
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,030
Down and in.

132
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,460
So if you got a word that you'd like
to look up and get the meaning of,

133
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,190
you'd go to the library or not.

134
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:54,641
The library.

135
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:55,474
The dictionary,

136
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,990
and you'd select the award and pressure
to the right and it would say search

137
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,043
store.

138
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,480
I accidentally held it a little bit too
long and it went right past search store

139
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,033
to google.

140
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,700
I was on the Internet with

141
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,533
no filter.

142
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,780
It is a crazy little machines.

143
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,871
It's a big ass,

144
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:15,810
but you're not buying that shit.

145
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:16,820
Eddie nearly killed.

146
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,740
It looks like an explosion.

147
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,600
It's an a bomb

148
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,183
bomb.

149
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,980
Bomb went off.

150
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,940
That's the only song I know.

151
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:30,710
It's the biggest bomb that ever has
been dropped in war outside of a nuclear

152
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:31,544
bomb.

153
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,380
Well you don't believe non nuclear is

154
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,201
crazy.

155
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:39,590
I am.

156
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,423
Tell me.

157
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,970
I'm trying to figure
out what's the end goal.

158
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:45,320
Why are they showing us this?

159
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,491
That's what I'm thinking.

160
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:47,670
That's how crazy I am.

161
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:51,890
I'm fucking so anything when it becomes,

162
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,660
when it comes to military shit that's
blasted on the history channel or CNN,

163
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,700
I'm automatically.

164
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,810
What's their angle?

165
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:00,560
I don't.

166
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,150
Let me ask you this.

167
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:01,983
Have a conversation.

168
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,670
You need to have crazy dinosaurs.

169
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,420
I'm crazy.

170
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,470
Dinosaurs are real or not.

171
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,760
I don't trust that shit.

172
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,380
You don't just do that.

173
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,580
I love that triceratops because
everybody loves when the triceratops,

174
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,110
tyrannosaurus rex.

175
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,580
Everybody's rooting for the triceratops.

176
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,400
If you ruined for the tyrannosaurus
rex in that epic battle Douche bag.

177
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:21,820
Right?

178
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,211
You're right.

179
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:23,044
So you did those.

180
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:23,670
We'll do.

181
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,070
What about woolly mammoth?

182
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,760
Um,

183
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,040
I,

184
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,590
I,

185
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,390
I would say a yes.

186
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,720
Oh,

187
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,910
you got to fucking elephant.

188
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,771
You know what I mean?

189
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:34,680
It's the fucking elephant.

190
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,140
Tyranosaurs rex is a new one where
they're going to bring it back.

191
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,330
Source is a giant kangaroo.

192
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,230
That's what it is.

193
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,513
That's my guess.

194
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,940
It looks exactly the same.

195
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:48,620
It's kind of tail hops around on two legs.

196
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,613
Tyriana.

197
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,723
That's a fucking.

198
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,100
They found a giant kangaroo.

199
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,030
And when they figured it out,

200
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:53,241
they go,

201
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:53,510
dude,

202
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,550
it's a kangaroo with a guy like

203
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,750
Josh steps.

204
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,210
Today's sad day for
the last bill o'reilly.

205
00:05:59,230 --> 00:05:59,380
Oh,

206
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,510
I'm moaning at you.

207
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,610
Morning Joe.

208
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,690
I feel like I should be,

209
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:05,210
but I'm not one ton of loot.

210
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,260
What's that?

211
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,370
I said he made a ton of loot.

212
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,600
I mean since [inaudible] 96 when Fox
News launched and he was like the big.

213
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,700
I'm just making it up that
that's when Fox News launched.

214
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,750
Let's check out Jamie,

215
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,350
is that when Fox News launched 96 truck,

216
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,760
another trick,

217
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,140
he has pulled in so much money
for that network and for himself.

218
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,480
He was one of the bunch.

219
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,750
Was the main guy really?

220
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,210
He really was the main
guy in broadcasting.

221
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,750
They're going to find
another old to fill a spot.

222
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,480
They're going to have to know.

223
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,630
That's what people look
at that October seventh,

224
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:38,901
19,

225
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:39,411
96.

226
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:40,244
Ladies and gentlemen,

227
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,240
you're welcome.

228
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,073
America.

229
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,233
You'll were that.

230
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,560
He was on like hard copy
or something like that,

231
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:46,040
right?

232
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,761
I don't even know.

233
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:47,600
I was too young,

234
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,100
but I wasn't even here in the states.

235
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,560
I was a school child in Australia,

236
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,340
little child.

237
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,870
I don't remember him from anything else.

238
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:57,350
I just remember him being on
o'reilly and watching it and going,

239
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:01,160
what is like that longing
for in the Stall Gia thing?

240
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:01,331
You know,

241
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:03,500
you see an older gentleman
in a tie who just said,

242
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:04,520
well that's the way it is.

243
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,810
The tide goes in,

244
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,471
tide goes out.

245
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:07,304
Can you explain it?

246
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:07,640
Like,

247
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,680
what in the fuck is this guy doing?

248
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,940
That was when he was talking.

249
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,890
He was talking to an atheist resume.

250
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,371
Who was he?

251
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:13,760
Was it?

252
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:13,971
Oh,

253
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:15,170
I don't remember who was like,

254
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,230
maybe it was ricky Gervais' or some.

255
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:17,841
I can't remember,

256
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:18,674
but he was saying,

257
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,160
well maybe it was sam.

258
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,003
Could it have been saying?

259
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,620
I don't know who it was.

260
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,200
Someone was saying like I
was saying what he was like.

261
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,563
Bill was like,

262
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,720
I've got the absolute number one reason
why you have to believe in God because

263
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,453
tide goes in.

264
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,293
Tide goes out.

265
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,173
Always been that way.

266
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,840
Always will be that way goes
round or it spins around.

267
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,711
How do you explain that?

268
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:43,041
If not,

269
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:43,490
God?

270
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,390
It was just super obvious that he was
pandering because the guy went to fucking

271
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:47,841
Harvard.

272
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:48,171
Okay.

273
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:49,370
Bill O'reilly's not a dope.

274
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,540
He might be a Douche bag,

275
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,710
but he's not a dope.

276
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,680
He's,

277
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,930
I think religion makes people dopey and
they'd done that don't even know about.

278
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,130
I don't even think he's religious.

279
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,960
I think he's barely religious.

280
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,450
I think he's religious enough
to get by with the job.

281
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,970
I think he's innocent.

282
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,510
He has been in some 100 percent
because I think he's one of the.

283
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,171
Look,

284
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:10,130
I don't watch the show a lot,

285
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:10,761
so I'm not sure,

286
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:11,030
but I,

287
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,340
he's always struck me as one
of the more straight shooters.

288
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,383
I think he is.

289
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,520
He's smart,

290
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:17,510
but not wise.

291
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,380
Yes.

292
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:18,800
Uh,

293
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,041
you know,

294
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,730
he feels what he feels in his gut is
more important than what the data tells

295
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:23,380
him.

296
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,290
And I think he falls for a bunch of
fallacies that a lot of people fall for,

297
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,950
especially if they're religious,

298
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:32,510
like the idea that there was a certain
order to the cosmos and how could we all

299
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,300
have come about?

300
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,320
How could this whole thing around us
exist with all these butterflies and the

301
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,560
moon and the tide comes in and
the tide goes out and says,

302
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,371
he's me and Joe,

303
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:41,600
these spiritual creatures,

304
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,610
these beings sitting
opposite each other on a,

305
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,890
at a table in Los Angeles right now.

306
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,960
Some people just find that to
inexplicably to explain without a diety,

307
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:51,621
so they're like,

308
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:51,901
all right,

309
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:53,270
there must have been a big guy who did it.

310
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,760
Yeah.
