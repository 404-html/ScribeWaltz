00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,600
Hello freaks.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,060
This episode of podcast is
brought to you by on it.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,950
That's o n n I t on it is a
human optimization website.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,080

found that benefit you physically and

5
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:18,750
mentally like strength and
conditioning equipment,

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,820
healthy supplements and foods.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,430
I was camping in Alaska for a week,

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,780
hunting deer on Prince of Wales Island
and I ate about a thousand of these

9
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:29,130
fucking warrior bars.

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:29,490
They,

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,810
I lived off these things.

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,330
Buffalo meat with cranberries and pepper,

13
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:34,530
no antibiotics,

14
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:35,610
no added hormones,

15
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:36,450
gluten free,

16
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:39,600
no nitrates added all this shit's healthy,

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,980
no MSG.

18
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,310
Then it gives you 14 grams of protein
and only four grams of fat in a two ounce

19
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:49,380
serving with 140 calories.

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Super healthy and natural and it's one
of the things that we sell@onat.com as

21
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:59,610
well as things along the lines of
strength and conditioning equipment like

22
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:04,500
kettle bells and battle ropes and steel
clubs and maces and the guy that was

23
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:05,071
just here,

24
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:05,790

cardio workout series,

26

excellent workout resources.

27
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,220
We also have the Onnit academy
that's filled with inspiration,

28
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,900
all sorts of informative articles and
videos about strength and conditioning and

29
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:23,901
fitness and how it applies to things like
martial arts and athletics and various

30
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:24,900
pursuits.

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,000
If you go to [inaudible] dot com o

00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,620
Rejoice,

34
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,520
ladies and gentlemen,

35
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:40,521
because Anthony Kumi has flown in the
great metal tube from New York and he's

36
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:42,901
here.

37
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,700
Please cue the music.

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,353
Yeah,

39
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,143
experience.

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,240
That's nice man.

41
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,920
Dude started doing your show in your
basement while you were doing the opn

42
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:10,921
Anthony show and you set up like a pro
studio with a fucking green screen and

43
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:15,270
the real professional like
camera broadcast quality cameras.

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,060
I was like,

45
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,630
Woo.

46
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,280
To fucking do something like that.

47
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,540
And that's when Brian and I started out
with the youth stream shows directly

48
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,830
influenced by not just you
doing your show in Long Island,

49
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:31,030
but also the style of show that
you guys did an ob and Anthony.

50
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:31,390
Yeah.

51
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,250
Which was just pretty much a hangout,

52
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:33,551
you know,

53
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:35,170
talking like real people talk,

54
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,300
not professional broadcasters.

55
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,221
Hello,

56
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:39,190
you're on town,

57
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:39,581
you tell them.

58
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:40,414
Oh yeah,

59
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:40,820
yeah.

60
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,010
What are you talking about lately?

61
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,670
That's what I wanted to do with the light
from the compound especially is make

62
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:49,540
it look as professional as possible
and then have people watch and go,

63
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,740
why is this guy like,

64
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,480
did he hijack a new set?

65
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:53,530
Cause he's drinking,

66
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,240
he's talking about he's cursing,

67
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,880
he's talking about shit
that shouldn't be discussed.

68
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,960
And uh,

69
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,280
that's kind of why I wanted

70
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,360
it to look so good.

71
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:05,530
I wanted it to look a very professional
but be done very unprofessionally.

72
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,220
So,

73
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,910
well it is,

74
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,080
it's unprofessional,

75
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:09,130
but it is professional.

76
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:09,401
Yes,

77
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:10,061
exactly.

78
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:12,970
But not in a sense of what we see
everyday on the news and that,

79
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:13,390
that,

80
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,590
that phoniness that you just see every
day with those people that don't act like

81
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:18,424
real people.

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:18,710
Uh,

83
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,680
if something happens,

84
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,910
a mistake or a blooper or someone yells,

85
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,400
fuck in the background of
somebody doing a live shot,

86
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:24,890
uh,

87
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,290
the anchor loses his mind.

88
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,340
Like he just saw a murder.

89
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,810
They didn't freak out.

90
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,650
So,

91
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,100
uh,

92
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,361
I,

93
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:31,750
I just wanted to bring that look,

94
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:35,020
that professional slick look to me.

95
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,980
Who is just sitting there,

96
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:36,431
like I said,

97
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:36,911
drinking,

98
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:38,020
probably hung over.

99
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,970
Uh,

100
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,130
yeah,

101
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:39,360
I,

102
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,720
I made the show at 4:00 PM eastern
time just so I could sleep late.

103
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,220
I didn't even think like,

104
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,580
let me let me research and see what
the best time to do a live show.

105
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,380
It's like I could be up by four.

106
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,110
So that was pretty much
the criteria for that.

107
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,861
So it,

108
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,810
it really is being able
to do my own thing,

109
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:56,644
which uh,

110
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,650
I hadn't been able to do
for many years as well.

111
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:03,760
When you were doing it also while
you were doing oh and a much do have

112
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,400
management chagrin telling
you not to do it right?

113
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,030
Yeah.

114
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,331
Yeah.

115
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:07,700
They,

116
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,790
they wanted exclusivity.

117
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,391
And I was like,

118
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:14,050
this is completely different from
what I'm doing on the ONA show.

119
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,130
Um,

120
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,330
it's video based.

121
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,970
It's me alone in my house.

122
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,170
I'm not bouncing off of opn gym.

123
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,060
Um,

124
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,860
I rarely have guests.

125
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,281
Well,

126
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,050
the new show is a lot different
than life from the contract.

127
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,310
Cause like I do have guests,

128
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,144
but uh,

129
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,990
but back then they were getting on
me about exclusivity and it's like,

130
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:34,150
it's a completely different
thing and it's in my house.

131
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,500
I bought this shit.

132
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:36,640
Let me just have fun.

133
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,410
You weren't,

134
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,430
you had no agenda,

135
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:40,390
you're just having fun.

136
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,111
That was it.

137
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:42,310
I had no schedule,

138
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:43,001
no anything.

139
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,920
I would just pop on whenever I wanted to.

140
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:48,040
If I people over the house
singing karaoke with machine guns,

141
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,191
with machine guns.

142
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:50,560
That was crazy.

143
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,730
Gun Guy Karaoke and uh,

144
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,890
just anything.

145
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:57,850
But that is the freedom of being able
to do whatever you want like that.

146
00:04:57,851 --> 00:04:58,240
It's,

147
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,290
it's amazing,

148
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,190
uh,

149
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,581
when,

150
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:02,200
when you're able to do stuff like that,

151
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:07,201
you realize how tied up you were
when you worked for the man.

152
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,990
Yeah.

153
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,130
Do you ever see yourself going back to
serious and doing something like that

154
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:12,360
again?

155
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,450
Are you two free now?

156
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,380
It's,

157
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,213
you know,

158
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,320
once you let the dog out of the house,

159
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:17,830
man,

160
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,510
it's very hard to keep him,

161
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,460
keep him in and uh,

162
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,690
I'm loving this.

163
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,190
It's so much freedom.

164
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,540
It's a lot of fun.

165
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,693
Uh,

166
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,461
I'll be honest,

167
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:27,591
the,

168
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:29,560
the Gig at Sirius was great.

169
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,510
It was four hours a day.

170
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,400
I made a boatload of money and sat there
and the joked around with the likes of

171
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:40,930
Jim Norton and Opie and comics would
just come through and it was fantastic.

172
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,890
It was a lot of fun.

173
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,083
Um,

174
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,450
but then there were those little instances
where management would come in and

175
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:47,830
fuck the whole fun up.

176
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,000
Just fuck it up.

177
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,030
And now to have the ability
to just do anything,

178
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:53,020
talk about anything,

179
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,470
not have to go through all the logistical
red tape bullshit with management.

180
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,220
Keith,

181
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,010
the cop is my executive producer here.

182
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,360
He's never executive produced anything
but probably bruises on perps heads when

183
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:06,194
he was a cop.

184
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,750
But with three emails,

185
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,580
we set up a poker tournament,

186
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,360
uh,

187
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,781
over,

188
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:12,111
uh,

189
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:12,471
in,

190
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:13,220
in Kent,

191
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,731
Connecticut.

192
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:14,390
They're fucking,

193
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,560
where's the Foxwoods or Mohegan?

194
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,723
Mohegan.

195
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,630
Always get them confused.

196
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,010
W in no time.

197
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,580
And we had been trying to do
this with Sirius Xm for years.

198
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,280
Just let us get a poker
tournament together.

199
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,240
Nothing.

200
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,871
Oh this,

201
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:28,190
that we got to sell this,

202
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,210
this one got to talk to that one,

203
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:31,550
that and now it's just like,

204
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:31,821
Keith,

205
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:32,900
let's do a poker tournament.

206
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,471
Okay,

207
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,420
I'll call the guy and boom,

208
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:35,901
we're done.

209
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:36,680
We're set up.

210
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,660
I always feel like satellite radio was
the bridge from terrestrial radio to the

211
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:42,230
Internet.

212
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,450
Very good that it's this bridge
that allows people to see,

213
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,500
oh this is what it's like.

214
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:49,790
If you allow guys to come on and just
swear and say whatever the fuck they want

215
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,390
and talk.

216
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:55,100
The way they like what you guys did an
ONA is you would talk the way you would

217
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:56,600
talk if you were just hanging out.

218
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,230
Right.

219
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,180
And there was no other radio
show that was doing that.

220
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:03,410
Every radio show you would go on the
guy who was the host at a very clear

221
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:04,100
agenda.

222
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,570
He was pushing the conversation.

223
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:07,010
You were being interviewed.

224
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,870
They would ask you probing questions,

225
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:10,340
try to keep you on your heels,

226
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:10,851
you know,

227
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:12,920
try to manipulate the
conversation where it,

228
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:14,350
when on ona you got,

229
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:14,481
I mean,

230
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:17,510
you would ask questions if
you were curious and then
we would all just hang out

231
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,020
and talk.

232
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,351
Yeah.

233
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:21,800
It was just more like friends
hanging out and that's what,

234
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,663
you know,

235
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,860
especially with just a room full of guys,

236
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,180
that's what we do.

237
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,320
We hang out,

238
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,700
we goof on each other,

239
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,270
we hope to get a great line in that
makes the other guy look like an asshole.

240
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:33,700
And,

241
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,830
and the person you goofing on his laughing
more than the people that are goofing

242
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,430
on him.

243
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,990
That's what friends do.

244
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,460
That's how guys hang out.

245
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,430
And to have a show like
that is a very rare thing.

246
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,151
And,

247
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:44,660
uh,

248
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,900
I think you're absolutely right
about that bridge to the Internet.

249
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,620
When I was on terrestrial
radio early in my career,

250
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,490
uh,

251
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,920
you looked at satellite radio like watts,

252
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,910
who's listening to that?

253
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:56,421
Nobody.

254
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:56,631
It's,

255
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:57,110
it's,

256
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,500
you know,

257
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,630
it's the graveyard for radio.

258
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,321
Uh,

259
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:03,530
and then we ended up there
when we died in radio,

260
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,090
the sex for Sam thing.

261
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,163
Um,

262
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,930
and then went over to
satellite and it built,

263
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,850
you could feel it like
it was getting momentum.

264
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:11,960
People wanted this.

265
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,360
They wanted to hear people speak openly,

266
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:14,841
honestly,

267
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,520
and in real language.

268
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,240
Uh,

269
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,240
but then that again got fucked
by management and people
that they're beholden to

270
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,873
that they,

271
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,030
we couldn't speak about anything anymore.

272
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,421
Like,

273
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:31,910
I liked the idea of
speaking about anything,

274
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,560
anything and everything.

275
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,900
I think it's detrimental to not be able
to talk and to have people that want to

276
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:41,870
shut other people up based
on their ideology or,

277
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,923
um,

278
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,510
anything that they're saying.

279
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,590
If you want to take someone off the air
of shut them up or fire them from their

280
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:49,424
job,

281
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,350
I think that's copping out and saying,

282
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:51,561
look,

283
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:51,800
I,

284
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,870
I can't logically argue or,

285
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:56,250
or intelligently argue.

286
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,080
So I just want them quiet.

287
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,980
I want them silence.

288
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:01,350
Don't they know that by hamstringing you,

289
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:05,340
they fuck up their product and they open
up the door to the internet like the

290
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:05,561
Internet.

291
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:06,271
It's right there.

292
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:07,620
It's the wolf at the door.

293
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,060
It's right there.

294
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,590
It was just a matter of the
technology catching up to the,

295
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,120
the talent base out there.

296
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:15,970
Uh,

297
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,670
when,

298
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,940
when you're on regular radio,

299
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:21,270
you're heard by anybody in their car
that could just flip on the radio

300
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,231
satellite.

301
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:23,850
You needed a subscription,

302
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,391
you need it,

303
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:26,010
the cars to have the radio in it.

304
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,120
And in time that did build up and,

305
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,210
and there are many satellite listeners,

306
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,030
the Internet had that problem
with technology and that,

307
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:33,740
you know,

308
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,080
it,

309
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,190
you have the product,

310
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,730
you just couldn't get it out to everybody
in every location that they were in.

311
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,270
But now cars are Wifi enabled and uh,

312
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,360
people have their phones and they could
download podcasts and web shows and,

313
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,670
and play them in their cars.

314
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,140
They're going to work just
like they would radio.

315
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,340
So yeah,

316
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,660
it's right there.

317
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,583
They don't,

318
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,910
they don't see the danger to their
business and yet they keep making the same

319
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:59,940
mistakes to push people away
either hamstringing themselves.

320
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,691
It's amazing.

321
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:03,750
And they're doing it because they want
to save sponsors where they don't want

322
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:06,490
people to protest or
they want to save they,

323
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,740
they're a publicly traded companies
and get about all that stupid shit.

324
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,370
It's this phony ethical
vision that they want to have.

325
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,360
They think that people are looking at
them in a certain way and they won't

326
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,710
respect them if,

327
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:20,310
uh,

328
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,470
if they don't react to 'em.

329
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,040
But people like me,

330
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,820
you know,

331
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,750
and there was no,

332
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:31,800
there was really no outcry to
have me a booted from Sirius Xm.

333
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,910
No one said anything.

334
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,021
They just went,

335
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:34,350
wow,

336
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,850
well we have got to
come down to of strike.

337
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,151
Yes.

338
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:37,440
Preemptive racial things.

339
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,310
It's also a weird thing
like being on a network,

340
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:45,870
like a Sirius Xm type thing where you
have all these channels that are like

341
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,050
music and Christian radio and it's like
we're selling so much shit and on top of

342
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:54,530
that you've got something like Ona,

343
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,560
which should really be its own individual
entity because it's so uniquely

344
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:00,210
different from the rest of
the things you're having.

345
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,430
Things like if you're
a fucking going like,

346
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:05,340
let's see what's on Sirius
Xm and you click in,

347
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:08,850
right when Jimmy Norton's doing uncle
Paul tried to defend the seventh heaven

348
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:09,540
guy,

349
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,300
did you fucking hear him yesterday?

350
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:11,960
Hilarious.

351
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,793
Oh my,

352
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,790
he was defense uncle Paul is Jimmy Norton,

353
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,650
a Chogm Lester character that he
occasionally breaks out and he's like,

354
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,461
well first of all,

355
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:22,110
the guy with within doing nothing wrong.

356
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,850
It's an acting thing.

357
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,010
And he was practicing for acting.

358
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,750
He's in and he was,

359
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,201
oh,

360
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:32,490
he was telling me it was doing something
about having the kid licked the water

361
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,540
off the tip of his Dick,

362
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,470
like a sharable,

363
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,170
sharable has ethics and
then we mix the sound.

364
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:41,880
It was so awful and Opie was
cringing and Norton was fucking,

365
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,100
he his uncle Paul was
in full bloom yesterday.

366
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,600
It's,

367
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,910
it's despicable and hilarious.

368
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,690
And if you were flipping
through the channels,

369
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,750
you had no idea and you just let,

370
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,860
let's see what's on Channel One.

371
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:53,694
Oh,

372
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,610
what

373
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,443
is that?

374
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:56,710
Oh fuck.

375
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,490
Can you just get to that other,

376
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,580
what are they thinking in the first place?

377
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,621
You know,

378
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,610
you guys should be a
specifically different,

379
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,000
you mean should I should have been on
the Internet through two or three years.

380
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:07,834
Exactly.

381
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,853
The,

382
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,500
that's a prime example for context.

383
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:12,334
By the way,

384
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
everyone is held to this standard now of
the same like we are language on Sirius

385
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,221
XM satellite radio.

386
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:26,221
What we used to say on on the ONA show
was held in the same light as what an

387
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,830
anchorman would say on the evening news.

388
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,780
Like years ago you didn't
see Walter Cronkite being
held to the same standard as

389
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:36,640
George Carlin and vice versa.

390
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,150
Like you knew the context
of who was saying what.

391
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:40,841
Now,

392
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:42,940
no matter what you say in what context,

393
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:46,900
it's just held to this generic
standard of that's awful,

394
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,110
right?

395
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,960
So you get somebody like
Jimmy doing uncle Paul.

396
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,130
It's looked at like as if Tom Brokaw
got on and started just saying that,

397
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:54,520
yeah,

398
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,020
that's how outrageous we've lost the
ability to distinguish the differences in

399
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:03,730
context nowadays and that's what's
really fucking everything up.

400
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:05,740
I think it's absolutely is lost.

401
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,461
Also,

402
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:07,540
when you take it out,

403
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,890
your extract it and you put it in quotes
and put it on a blog or it's going to

404
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,930
look different than it was awful.

405
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:15,440
It looks terrible,

406
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:17,010
but a show like Ona,

407
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,530
what it is is a haven for like fun.

408
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:24,910
It's like one of the few remaining havens
where you can tune in and you can hear

409
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,721
awful,

410
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:30,580
ridiculous shit and you could hear
Jimmy defending a pedophile and that,

411
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:31,030
look,

412
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,811
I have daughters,

413
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,171
man.

414
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:32,411
I mean,

415
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,290
and I have little kids and I
thought it was fucking hilarious.

416
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,124
It's the,

417
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,720
because I know what it is.

418
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:38,890
He's being naughty.

419
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,180
He's being fun,

420
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:40,930
I think.

421
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,740
I think people don't want to know anything
about context anymore because they

422
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,950
don't want to believe that people
can hang out in a room like that.

423
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,700
Talk about stuff like that in
a funny way and laugh about it.

424
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,660
They don't want to think that people like
that exist and they don't want you to

425
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:56,650
be able to do that.

426
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:56,851
Right.

427
00:13:56,851 --> 00:14:01,060
You'd want to change your way of talking
and thinking and they want you to their

428
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:01,990
own social standards,

429
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,970
thinking that everyone can be changed.

430
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:05,380
Like we're all sick or something.

431
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,340
We're all ill if we laugh like that,

432
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,830
but there's hope for you.

433
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:14,020
If we just stop people from talking
like that and stop an airing them,

434
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,590
then it'll all be nice and
people won't speak like that.

435
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,820
Like the idea that if you stopped Jimmy
from making fun using the uncle Paul

436
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:22,510
character,

437
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,460
you're somehow or another
going to stop child molester.

438
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:24,581
Yeah.

439
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:26,100
You're going to stop
[inaudible] I haven't gotten,

440
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:26,261
no,

441
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:26,950
he was,

442
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,150
he was full boar balls
out for fucking kids.

443
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,010
Jesus and wrote books about it.

444
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,610
Oh,

445
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,443
he wrote books.

446
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,750
He wrote two books that supposedly what
started the whole thing because one of

447
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,780
his victims row read both of
his books and one of his books,

448
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:43,780
it's about sleeping with
like a babysitter or a,

449
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,980
it had something to do with like a
younger kid sitting baby actually.

450
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,110
Yeah,

451
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,210
the babysitter is hot.

452
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,990
19 year old baby who didn't
have fantasies about that.

453
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,943
John Rowe

454
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,210
isn't it?

455
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,180
It certainly is,

456
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,850
but he's a fucking real pig.

457
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,360
This guy,

458
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,193
real piece of shit.

459
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,290
Unbelievable.

460
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,000
He never,

461
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,230
he's one of those guys too that you never
really would have thought that seventh

462
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:14,390
heaven show and oh boy.

463
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:18,620
It's fascinating too that he admitted
to it all in therapy with his wife who

464
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:19,454
does that.

465
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:19,820
Like,

466
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,560
I really wants a divorce bad.

467
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,571
You know,

468
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:24,680
you just do this,

469
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,060
we'll get you out of the marriage.

470
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:30,260
But you got to kind of do this confession
thing with the wife is demanding it

471
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,440
and then it's like,

472
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:31,650
ah,

473
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,360
was this,

474
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,230
was this recorded?

475
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,770
Well she apparently without his knowledge.

476
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:37,070
Right?

477
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,903
Is that what happened?

478
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,930
I think what happened is is that the
one of the victims contacted the wife.

479
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,610
The wife then tried to figure out
what was going on in the navy.

480
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,740
They sign like all these papers about
like the whole thing deposition,

481
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,663
is that what it's called?

482
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,970
And then they recorded it
with him knowing I think they,

483
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:56,780
it was like,

484
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,640
I don't think he knew that
it was being recorded.

485
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:02,330
I think his wife recorded it because that
was part of the premise was that it's

486
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:05,150
legal for her to record it because he
was involved in committing what they

487
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:06,980
consider a violent crime,

488
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,780
but that's what also I films weird,

489
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,350
weird.

490
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,180
The use of the term violence,

491
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,610
like it's obviously a heinous crime.

492
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:16,130
He took a little kid's hand
and put it on his dick.

493
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,993
That's a crime.

494
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,200
But how has that violent,

495
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,340
like what,

496
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:19,641
what?

497
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:22,430
What made it isn't violent
is they're involved in it.

498
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:27,431
Definition of violence that it can be
mental or does it have to be a physical

499
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,091
assault?

500
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:29,451
I don't know.

501
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:31,670
Here's what's interesting
because the word assault,

502
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,450
that's another one that's getting thrown
around a lot and really weird ways like

503
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,190
sexual assault.

504
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,870
Like one of the things
that's coming up now,

505
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:42,080
a California just passed this
new law called yes means yes.

506
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,250
Well you have to get actual verbal consent
from someone before you have sex with

507
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:46,610
them.

508
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,440
Can we just get back to fucking,

509
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:49,280
no,

510
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,740
because the thing that
they're trying to push,

511
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:52,551
and this is a,

512
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:54,920
a feminine agenda in 2014,

513
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:57,080
is that if you have sex with
someone who's been drinking,

514
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,190
it's sexual assault.

515
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,230
They want to say that.

516
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:00,741
Well,

517
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:04,580
a guy got kicked out of Occidental
College because him and a girl had sex.

518
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:07,730
We had Thaddeus Russell on is a
professor there and he was going,

519
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:07,830
well,

520
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,170
he drives him fucking crazy.

521
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:10,070
But Guy was,

522
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:10,420
uh,

523
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,450
a guy and a girl,

524
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,550
young 18 year old freshmen.

525
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,990
They both were drunk.

526
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:17,480
They both were texting each
other back for the guy was like,

527
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:18,171
get over here.

528
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:18,681
The girl was like,

529
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:19,400
do you have a condom?

530
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,671
She said,

531
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,271
do you ever caught him?

532
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:20,571
He said,

533
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:21,320
yes.

534
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:21,711
She said,

535
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:22,371
I'm on my way.

536
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:23,390
She texts her friend,

537
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,980
I'm going to go have sex now.

538
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,270
Went to the guy's house drunk,

539
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,861
had sex with them.

540
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:30,500
They were both drunk and he got accused
of sexual assault and he got kicked out

541
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:31,960
of the college despite Christ.

542
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,871
All the evidence,

543
00:17:32,871 --> 00:17:34,010
despite the text messages,

544
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,060
she didn't get kicked out.

545
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:35,900
She didn't get expelled.

546
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,920
He did because he's the one with the
penis because it's sexual assault.

547
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:41,060
It does seem like drunk.

548
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,841
If she was,

549
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:42,200
you know,

550
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,220
with it enough to say,

551
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:43,401
hey,

552
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:44,270
you got a condom?

553
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,840
Yeah.

554
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,570
Text her friend and you know
that she knew what was going on.

555
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:47,811
Well,

556
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:51,360
it's also absolving someone responsibility
because they're drunk and only a

557
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,440
sexual context.

558
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,251
You don't do it.

559
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:54,084
It's driving.

560
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,160
You don't do it to like she
went out with a baseball bat,

561
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:58,560
just start fucking braining
people and it was like,

562
00:17:58,561 --> 00:17:58,831
look,

563
00:17:58,831 --> 00:17:59,670
I'm not responsible.

564
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,361
I was drunk.

565
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:00,661
Right,

566
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:01,080
right.

567
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,591
Yeah.

568
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:04,350
Why is it in that case it's a,

569
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,670
she's not responsible for it.

570
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:05,911
Well,

571
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:07,530
it's because feminists are pushing this,

572
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,130
the,

573
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:13,130
they're trying to demasculate men and
trying to take away masculine behavior and

574
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,450
masculine behavior is seeking sex.

575
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,500
That's right.

576
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,220
So they're trying to say that seeking
sex while the woman's intoxicated,

577
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:21,960
even if the mountains
is intoxicated as well,

578
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,230
that the man is being
sexually assault their,

579
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,930
the sexually aggressive and is
committing sexually assault.

580
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,180
That is spectacular ending sexual
assault because you're drunk.

581
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,390
How's it assault?

582
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,533
Uh,

583
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,910
how has it assault by the way?

584
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:36,780
It's sex.

585
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,070
It,

586
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,491
I don't know.

587
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:38,731
Yeah.

588
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:39,564
If it was,

589
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,860
I don't even know.

590
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,570
It's so confusing now what
happened at drunk fucking dry?

591
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,540
Everyone drunk.

592
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,021
Fox,

593
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:46,560
Saks.

594
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,080
It's got to have a little
bit at least to loosen up.

595
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:49,914
First of all,

596
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,150
it's fun at those,

597
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:51,570
uh,

598
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,670
inhibitions to kind of slither away.

599
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,260
Now you're having fun.

600
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,550
But this idea is that,

601
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,750
that those inhibitions are therefore
reason Anthony and sex is bad.

602
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:00,961
Well,

603
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:02,730
so are the male fucking,

604
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:04,860
I want to fuck instincts.

605
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,950
Those had been there for fucking
since we've been on the earth.

606
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,660
How are those denied now?

607
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,810
I love when people try to deny the fact
that we still have so many animalistic

608
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:17,610
tendencies that you know,

609
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:21,090
they get covered up by a suit or the
ability to use an iPhone and shit like

610
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:21,600
that.

611
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,030
But the fact is guys love to fuck and,

612
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,040
and they will do things that sometimes
aren't the most honest things to get

613
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:30,860
late.

614
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,450
And,

615
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,740
and this is just the way it is
and there's no changing that.

616
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,450
It's just the way it is.

617
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,540
That's another thing that they're trying
to push is the ability to withdraw

618
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,860
consent after the fact.

619
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:43,650
If you feel you were tricked
so you could say yes,

620
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:45,600
have sense of summoning a Connie's like,

621
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,170
guess what?

622
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,280
I didn't love Ya.

623
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:48,180
Hey.

624
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,030
And he leaves and that's
rate and that's now,

625
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,960
now it becomes rate becomes
rape after the fact where yes,

626
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:58,350
this is the new new rape is
what I like to call a new rape,

627
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,420
new definitions.

628
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,810
It's astounding what's
going on in this society.

629
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,793
Do you,

630
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,160
have we always been in like just on
the precipice of society failing or,

631
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,470
or is it worse now?

632
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,230
I cause you hear shit from
years ago and it's like,

633
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,760
that sounds pretty familiar.

634
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,420
You know,

635
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,220
I think we were always fucked.

636
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:20,790
Yeah.

637
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,350
But we're here and now,

638
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:26,010
so we see it as the most
important fuck that we're getting.

639
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:26,851
You know,

640
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,370
grandpa's fucking was
probably just as bad.

641
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:29,851
Yeah.

642
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:30,000
The,

643
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,090
everybody's always been
fucked and everybody's always
been thinking the society

644
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:33,924
is failing.

645
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,990
I was listening to this hunters
Thompson documentary recently.

646
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,990
He was talking about the state
of America in 1970 whatever,

647
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:41,790
and it was all falling
apart and I was like,

648
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:42,390
Huh,

649
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,830
here we are 40 years later.

650
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:44,664
It's okay.

651
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,480
Yeah.

652
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:45,781
Yeah.

653
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:47,800
We're always on the brink of,

654
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,070
of

655
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,540
just complete disaster.

656
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,060
And I think people like
to think that we are,

657
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,680
I honestly feel that just
based on your own mortality,

658
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,130
I think people like to think that
they're going to be the last of it.

659
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:00,970
You know?

660
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,050
Like if I'm dead,

661
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:02,401
I wouldn't,

662
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:03,910
I don't want this carry on without me.

663
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:07,330
So if there's a cataclysmic event,

664
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,030
then everyone goes and
I could be happy by,

665
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:10,331
you know,

666
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:11,290
I'm checking out too.

667
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,480
That's like part of the
Zombie apocalypse fantasy too,

668
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,080
right?

669
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,531
Yes,

670
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:14,961
exactly.

671
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:16,300
We all want to be part of that.

672
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,610
Yeah.

673
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,800
Mad Max style.

674
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,140
The total over the
second you dropped dead,

675
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,590
someone's alarm goes off and they go to
work the next day and the fucking earth

676
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:24,850
spins round and round,

677
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,190
but everyone wants to think
like we're on the brink.

678
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,790
Oh,

679
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,280
society.

680
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,081
America's gone.

681
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,570
Just look at it now compared
to years ago and it's like,

682
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:32,404
no,

683
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,040
no.

684
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,820
I think 200 years from now
someone's going to be going to La.

685
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,540
Fucking crazy.

686
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,400
Then we should still
have flying cars by now.

687
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,263
Right?

688
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,760
You don't want to

689
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,090
be the guy that's on his death
bed watching CNN and they're like,

690
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:45,680
utopia has been achieved.

691
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,710
Long life is forever on everyone's.

692
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:50,300
Dick will now grow six inches.

693
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,040
We're all billionaires.

694
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,330
Congratulations.

695
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,220
Three d printers have come up.

696
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:56,150
You can make your own house.

697
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:57,140
Whatever shape you want,

698
00:21:57,141 --> 00:21:58,220
material is free,

699
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:58,821
right?

700
00:21:58,821 --> 00:21:59,750
Everything's free.

701
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,460
The Internet has made everything free.

702
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:05,390
You just download the specs to whatever
device you want and now objects.

703
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,330
Materialism means nothing now because
you could have whatever you want whenever

704
00:22:08,331 --> 00:22:08,870
you want it.

705
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,510
There you are fucking check
in an hour and you're rotten.

706
00:22:11,511 --> 00:22:14,960
You're the fucking liver spots on
your hands are blowing up and shut.

707
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,060
I'd missed the boat when it happened.

708
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,040
I may stop boat,

709
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:24,230
but there's also like 40 years in the
context of hunter s Thompson in 1974 to

710
00:22:24,231 --> 00:22:26,450
compare it to where we
are today is nothing.

711
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:27,950
If you go back to like Rome,

712
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,610
like if you went back to ancient
Rome and any 40 year period,

713
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,120
they were like,

714
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,580
Eh,

715
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,413
we'll always be here.

716
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,290
No,

717
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:34,711
I know.

718
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:36,480
And that's what people bring up also.

719
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,220
They always bring up that Roman empire,

720
00:22:38,221 --> 00:22:38,760
you know?

721
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,030
It's like,

722
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:43,680
well that fell and that was a pretty
strong and long lasting and everything and

723
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,590
everyone got up.

724
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,900
I see it happen in though now,

725
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,220
but that's just the thing.

726
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:47,881
When they bring it up,

727
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:52,590
they think that now is the fall
part of the American empire.

728
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:52,941
Well,

729
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:54,860
they see Rome when Rome fell.

730
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:56,090
Well remember when we were kids we'd,

731
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,340
we'd hear about it was
always like the excess,

732
00:22:58,341 --> 00:22:59,630
the vomitorium.

733
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,390
Geez.

734
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,070
You know,

735
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,180
vomitorium is just like a
way to get out of the arena.

736
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,910
Like a vomitorium is not a
place where they go and vomit.

737
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:08,630
Really?

738
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,841
Yeah.

739
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:12,680
It was a pathway that the entire crowd
would go out of the arena had nothing to

740
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:13,440
do with Bob

741
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,400
because it's like,

742
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:14,620
yeah,

743
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,930
spelling the people.

744
00:23:15,931 --> 00:23:16,764
It's kind of,

745
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,161
oh,

746
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:18,360
that makes sense.

747
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,920
But it sounded funny as a kid
to just say like vomitorium.

748
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:22,401
Yeah,

749
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,130
well that's what we used to think that
it was like some place where they would

750
00:23:25,131 --> 00:23:28,760
all get together and fucking throw
up and then have orgies and shit.

751
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,870
It was just that whole concept of of get
bingeing and just eating everything and

752
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,160
that's the vomitorium.

753
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:36,701
Oh,

754
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:37,300
there you go.

755
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,160
That looks fine.

756
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,910
Just a passage doesn't look bad.

757
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,281
Yeah.

758
00:23:40,281 --> 00:23:44,150
It's a passage situated below or behind
a tier of seats in an amphitheater or

759
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:44,751
stadium too.

760
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:45,980
Which crowds can exit

761
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,540
rapidly at the end of a performance.

762
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,470
So when the lion kills the dude and then
everybody wants to get the fuck out of

763
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,820
there before it leaps in the stand,

764
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:54,290
they start to fucking up the Romans.

765
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,130
They would go through the vomitorium,

766
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:58,130
but I'd have to hear all
your not entertained.

767
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:00,531
Well,

768
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:01,010
they would,

769
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,281
you know,

770
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:02,690
we would always hear
about the vomit Torrens,

771
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,100
whether it gets what was bullshit,

772
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,120
but then we'd also hear
about the Christians versus
the lions or crazy shit they

773
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:12,320
would do and have people fight to the
death in front of everyone and the fucking

774
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:13,190
thumbs down.

775
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,690
You want that was society falling apart
and you compare it to today with our

776
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,080
fucking drones and war and the UFC
and all this chaos and fear factor.

777
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:27,320
I'm apart of a lot of things that you
really are the downfall of America.

778
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,180
Well of society in general.

779
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,520
That's what we would think of like,

780
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:31,671
oh,

781
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:32,690
this is a sure sign.

782
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:33,230
It's just,

783
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,080
it's fucking over it.

784
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:34,240
Yeah,

785
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,580
yeah,

786
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,150
yeah.

787
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,040
That's how people think because they want,

788
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,240
they want it to be over in a weird
way because of your own mortality.

789
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,590
If people lived forever,

790
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:43,940
you would never want it to be over.

791
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,220
Right.

792
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,080
So this is great.

793
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:46,370
You'll change it into something else.

794
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:48,080
Cool baby over time.

795
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,640
But I don't want it to be over.

796
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,080
But since you are a mortal
being and you have a lifespan,

797
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,790
you just want to be like,

798
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:56,240
yeah,

799
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,541
no,

800
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:57,080
I go,

801
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,190
everyone goes,

802
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:03,670
it's like the ultimate like flip the
board game over if you can't win.

803
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:07,750
Yeah.

804
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,080
Like someone with terminal cancer,

805
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:11,170
that fucking takes a machine
gun and heads until mall.

806
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:11,700
Right,

807
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:11,950
right.

808
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,783
It's opening up.

809
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,180
And that's another thing.

810
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:19,181
People have these ideas of what they
would do in certain situations and you

811
00:25:19,361 --> 00:25:19,460
know,

812
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:19,970
well,

813
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,920
if I found out I had cancer and stuff,

814
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:23,150
I'd fucking get a gun.

815
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:26,470
I'd head over to Siri and start
shooting nicest people and says like,

816
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,270
now you'd be in the hospital with no hair,

817
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,111
chemo,

818
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:33,320
fucking getting pity from your family.

819
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:35,600
And everyone has this idea,

820
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:35,901
this,

821
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:36,500
uh,

822
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,710
this notion about themselves
that are very rarely accurate.

823
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,311
Yeah.

824
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:42,590
It's all based on books and movies.

825
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,640
It's all based on romantic depictions
of what you would do in those scenarios.

826
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,200
It makes for a fun read.

827
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,710
Right?

828
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,981
Yeah.

829
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:49,700
Yeah.

830
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,380
And honestly,

831
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,410
we're very rarely that why there's a
beautiful thing about being influenced by

832
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,000
movies and books and songs and that
they provide us with entertainment and

833
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:02,690
inspiration.

834
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:07,690
But they also really distort the
shit out of realistic scenario life.

835
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:11,030
But I think you're supposed to be
able to distinguish between that.

836
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,540
Oh,

837
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:11,930
you know,

838
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,510
art is one thing in
reality is another art.

839
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:14,750
It's,

840
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,580
I think it's based on reality
and then we got a couple wins.

841
00:26:17,581 --> 00:26:19,520
Winces reality so much.

842
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,200
Yeah.

843
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,780
Yeah.

844
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,950
Especially with women.

845
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,450
How many women have these,

846
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,410
but especially young women that have
these distorted perceptions of Channing

847
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,243
Tatum movies.

848
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,710
Channing Tatum is,

849
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,750
that's how men behave and this is reality.

850
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,750
It's going to happen to me.

851
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,220
I just got to find my prints.

852
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,390
Yeah.

853
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,240
It's just not a bunch of
way want to come in you.

854
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,580
And so it really is out there.

855
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,950
They're just lying and both sides.

856
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,110
The,

857
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,271
the,

858
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:44,190
the aggressive male

859
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,700
side and the men who are pretending
they're not like all the other men cause

860
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:48,181
they want to come.

861
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:48,601
And you too.

862
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:51,690
And that's the only way they can go
about getting in there as being unique.

863
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,170
Yeah.

864
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:52,500
Or,

865
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,540
or just being like on your side,

866
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,620
men are shit.

867
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:55,981
Right,

868
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:56,281
right.

869
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:56,730
I'm all,

870
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,170
I'm horrified to be a man.

871
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,260
Made your shit

872
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,310
that on Twitter and
it's most archaic form,

873
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:06,510
which is the White Knight.

874
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:07,170
Yes.

875
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,600
I fucking love the light night.

876
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,360
I don't think I really verbally go,

877
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,650
oh yeah,

878
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,250
reading anything else but
white knights on Twitter.

879
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,680
When you bash somebody who's a girl,

880
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:19,890
uh,

881
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,170
and,

882
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:20,580
and,

883
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:20,940
and,

884
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,391
you know,

885
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,620
you call her out on something.

886
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:23,490
Uh,

887
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,050
and then some guys swoops in,

888
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,340
don't take that.

889
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:27,450
You are beautiful.

890
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:29,160
You're a beautiful person and this,

891
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:30,600
and he just like,

892
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:31,434
dude,

893
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:31,981
first of all,

894
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:33,360
you just want to fuck her.

895
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,130
You want to do the same thing,

896
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,620
the guy that's fucking bashed
in or if it wants to do,

897
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,480
he's just taking a different angle,

898
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,470
you know,

899
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,670
and you swoop in.

900
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:43,320
And what is their mindset?

901
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,220
Oh,

902
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,330
DM me.

903
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,920
You're a good man.

904
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,580
They just want to love love.

905
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,750
It's what love.

906
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:52,950
It's not going to get their way.

907
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,820
They just want love.

908
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,780
It just doesn't have it.

909
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,570
I've given up on the concept of love.

910
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,540
I honestly don't think it really exists.

911
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:02,430
And this is something a lot
of people have called me on.

912
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,300
I think love is a cross between,

913
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,353
um,

914
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:10,230
lust and an obsession.

915
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,250
Kind of a,

916
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,660
not really obsession.

917
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:13,620
I think maybe um,

918
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,581
a,

919
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:19,581
a fascination kind of just
this quick thing that happens.

920
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:20,880
It doesn't last long.

921
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,870
It could last maybe a couple of
few years to quite a few years,

922
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,340
but it's still the same thing.

923
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,580
It's lust and this fascination with the
person and that conjures up this mixture

924
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:36,580
that seems like something
that's love in the

925
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,471
fixing narrow.

926
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:39,150
You don't think that
people can be in love?

927
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,723
No.

928
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,770
I honestly don't see two people.

929
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,890
I think honesty would be like,

930
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,410
you just never argue.

931
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,030
You agree with everything.

932
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,580
There's never a snooty snippy moment,

933
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,290
so it just doesn't exist.

934
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,230
And in time it transmit,

935
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,270
it transfers into something more,

936
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,113
a habit,

937
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,700
a habitual thing.

938
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:04,990
The,

939
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,990
the lust turns into habit and the
fascination turns into comfort zone.

940
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,920
And then you're just together and you
continue to be together and you don't even

941
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,180
know about love anymore.

942
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,980
You're not coming home every day.

943
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,210
You're not at the office going,

944
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:20,931
fuck,

945
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:22,130
I want to be with her.

946
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,880
God.

947
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,840
When you first get together,

948
00:29:23,841 --> 00:29:24,350
you're like,

949
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,400
I can't even work.

950
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:26,420
I love this girl.

951
00:29:26,421 --> 00:29:27,440
I want to be with her.

952
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,440
I want to fucking smeller
hair and kiss her and hug her,

953
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,500
and then you've got to leave and you
go into the store for 10 minutes,

954
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:34,011
Sweetie.

955
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:34,191
Oh,

956
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:35,780
I love you all the one law.

957
00:29:35,781 --> 00:29:36,830
I wish I didn't have to go.

958
00:29:36,831 --> 00:29:37,491
Come with me.

959
00:29:37,491 --> 00:29:38,660
Come to the store.

960
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,460
It's just fucking crazy.

961
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,010
20 years of marriage

962
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,240
and you're still doing that bullshit
and you still love the person.

963
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,200
No,

964
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,650
you're now a habitual in
a habitual relationship.

965
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,910
I honestly believe that he is
fucking pissed all over everybody.

966
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,740
There's a bunch of people at
work right now listen to this.

967
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,583
Hmm,

968
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:05,140
well,

969
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,090
you definitely don't get the newness,

970
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,340
but you could still have
a great relationship,

971
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,331
but what is that?

972
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:10,990
It's not love,

973
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,880
but the falling in love park,

974
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,710
the falling in love.

975
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,500
The newness.

976
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:14,711
Well,

977
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:16,060
we know what the newness is.

978
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:20,880
The newness is a hormonal rush to make
babies and you're supposed to fuck time.

979
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,251
Yeah.

980
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:22,810
That's why relationships,

981
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,400
most relationships.

982
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,590
Peter out around three months in,

983
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,720
that's when the woman
hits her first trimester.

984
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:31,050
She's already supposed to be pregnant
and you're supposed to be out of there.

985
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:31,510
Right.

986
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,440
Bang in a new one.

987
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,040
Why?

988
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,070
Because people were getting eaten
by Jaguars in a daily basis.

989
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:40,160
He had a fuck as many people
as you possibly could in
order to ensure that this

990
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,140
species survived.

991
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,870
The problem is our high
mortality rate when the,

992
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,310
when human beings were in their infancy
are high mortality rate led to very

993
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:53,080
specific types of behaviors that
are ingrained in our genetics.

994
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:57,190
And those specific types of behaviors
are frowned upon by feminists now.

995
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:57,760
They,

996
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:57,881
the,

997
00:30:57,881 --> 00:30:58,051
the,

998
00:30:58,051 --> 00:31:02,200
the very thing that got us to
2014 they trying to curve back.

999
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:02,890
Yeah.

1000
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,710
This like deceptive behavior
in order to try to get laid,

1001
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,490
you know,

1002
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,120
any type of sex other than the sex
that they feel comfortable with.

1003
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,860
I'm happy that this happened.

1004
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:12,321
If,

1005
00:31:12,321 --> 00:31:12,540
if,

1006
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,500
if the man's happy,

1007
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,240
I fuck and I left pig,

1008
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,481
you know,

1009
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:20,080
it's anything that's not
along the lines of their,

1010
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,561
their,

1011
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:22,120
their ideal is,

1012
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,063
is a rape.

1013
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:23,860
Yeah.

1014
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,210
Yeah.

1015
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:24,330
And,

1016
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,151
and like you said,

1017
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:30,151
it's just biological for the
preservation of humanity early on.

1018
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,860
That's how we needed to add.

1019
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,270
Here's where it gets more fascinating.

1020
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,930
The women who are trying to tighten
this down as much as possible,

1021
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,450
no one wants a fuck.

1022
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:41,320
Yeah.

1023
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:41,501
Yeah.

1024
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:44,560
At the very top of the fucking machine,

1025
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,670
the very top of the machine
is run by troll agents.

1026
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:51,731
Sure.

1027
00:31:51,731 --> 00:31:52,564
All ladies,

1028
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,583
ladies,

1029
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,510
they're not like really sexy,

1030
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:58,090
attractive objects of desire.

1031
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:58,480
Yeah.

1032
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,313
You know,

1033
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,951
I think when,

1034
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:04,720
when they speak about like how like how
can a man dictate what happens to our

1035
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:06,070
bodies kind of a thing.

1036
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,760
It's the same thing as how can you
dictate what happens to a pretty girl?

1037
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,040
Like you are not a pretty girl,

1038
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,730
so you don't understand what it's
like to be that and to be able to,

1039
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:16,301
you know,

1040
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,460
manipulate men in such a fashion.

1041
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:18,931
So you,

1042
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:19,721
she should probably,

1043
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:24,460
the troll ladies should probably steer
clear of what they think attractive men

1044
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:26,440
and women should find amazing.

1045
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:28,450
Should hide the social justice,

1046
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:30,190
Social Justice Warrior,

1047
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:30,670
uh,

1048
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,450
people.

1049
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,450
One of the things that they love is when
transgender people go way overboard and

1050
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:40,100
become very overtly like

1051
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,290
high heels and a lot of makeup.

1052
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:43,370
You go girl.

1053
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,530
But if a woman does that,

1054
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,790
if a woman does that,

1055
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:49,580
she's playing into the gender stereotypes.

1056
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,480
That is brilliant.

1057
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:51,314
Yes.

1058
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:51,890
Wow.

1059
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,360
There's so many hypocrisy.

1060
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,463
That's a big one.

1061
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,240
But that is a giant one.

1062
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:56,870
Yeah.

1063
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,111
Yeah.

1064
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:57,741
That's great.

1065
00:32:57,741 --> 00:32:58,161
Woo.

1066
00:32:58,161 --> 00:32:59,060
Look at you.

1067
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:00,110
He's go girl.

1068
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:00,351
He,

1069
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:01,184
excuse me.

1070
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,460
He fucking asshole.

1071
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,210
Trying to be gender neutral.

1072
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,020
Better not be,

1073
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,170
uh,

1074
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:06,561
you know,

1075
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:09,080
I don't want people to be gender binary.

1076
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,070
Yeah.

1077
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,450
I like queer because we're is whatever.

1078
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,513
It's everything.

1079
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,180
Everything.

1080
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,013
It's all queer.

1081
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,201
Well,

1082
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,230
I like when I see an application
for something and it says,

1083
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:18,920
um,

1084
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,600
gender and it says male,

1085
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:21,410
female.

1086
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:21,890
Both.

1087
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,723
Neither.

1088
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,270
Hmm.

1089
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,310
Those are nice.

1090
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,670
Neither either.

1091
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,533
Really.

1092
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,180
I mean she just say chromosome.

1093
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:30,050
Can we get it down?

1094
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,610
Do you and your why in there?

1095
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:32,901
Okay.

1096
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:33,440
You're a dude.

1097
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,830
Next fucking woman.

1098
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,950
I betcha we can tell God anymore.

1099
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:40,910
They're pretty good at it.

1100
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,900
They fucking to do.

1101
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,280
I don't know if they're good at it.

1102
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,260
I'm not sure.

1103
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,243
I don't know.

1104
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,600
I definitely don't know.

1105
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:48,471
But uh,

1106
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:48,890
I mean,

1107
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,410
have you seen a photo
of a really good one?

1108
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,273
Have a really good

1109
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,261
spot though,

1110
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:54,950
right?

1111
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,790
It's in the wrong spot.

1112
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,901
Well,

1113
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:57,860
when you look a,

1114
00:33:57,861 --> 00:34:01,640
the vaginal canal is a little more upward.

1115
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:01,970
Right?

1116
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,300
And when you have to turn a penis
inside out to make a vagina,

1117
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,720
you see where the penis comes?

1118
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,820
It's a little more,

1119
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,820
actually the Trans Sexual
Vagina is exactly where you
thought it was before you

1120
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:15,980
saw a girl naked.

1121
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,940
And that's true,

1122
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:20,211
right?

1123
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:20,391
Yeah.

1124
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:20,781
Cause it,

1125
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:24,140
cause I don't remember the first few
times you're trying to get down to girl's

1126
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:24,980
pants and you're like,

1127
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,260
I am so far below the belly button.

1128
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:28,094
Now where is it?

1129
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,700
This is like God over here.

1130
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:32,181
Oh,

1131
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:33,860
what a great adventure that was.

1132
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,540
I remember my friend Paulie Hudson,

1133
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,240
he was the first one to
tell me that you had sex.

1134
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:38,510
You Go,

1135
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,070
you went up inside a girl.

1136
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:40,904
Right?

1137
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,160
That's like you just went straight,

1138
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,240
straight in.

1139
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,373
It's what I thought.

1140
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:45,681
I was like,

1141
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:47,060
you go up and he goes,

1142
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:48,240
you never even had sex.

1143
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:49,100
So yeah.

1144
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
Well Dude,

1145
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,600
I don't know what happens.

1146
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,660
You think back at some of
the misconceptions you have
in your youth about sex

1147
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:57,980
and it really is hilarious.

1148
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,170
I was under the impression that you
needed what was called at the time a scum

1149
00:35:02,171 --> 00:35:02,631
bag,

1150
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:03,920
which was a condom.

1151
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,670
A rubber.

1152
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,280
These are called,

1153
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,113
it was economy.

1154
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,940
That's where a scumbag comes from.

1155
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,571
It was called a,

1156
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:08,901
yeah.

1157
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,960
A condom was a scumbag
back in the old days.

1158
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,741
Wow.

1159
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:13,760
And this was when I was a kid.

1160
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:15,200
So I had never used that term.

1161
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:18,380
But I heard like my parents
say that my dad's friends,

1162
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:18,981
you know.

1163
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:19,401
Yeah.

1164
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:20,870
I didn't have a scumbag last night,

1165
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:22,550
so I fucking shit like that.

1166
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,640
I know.

1167
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,473
It's hilarious.

1168
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,830
So I thought you needed
one to get a girl pregnant.

1169
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:31,130
I thought the shit that was
on it got the girl pregnant.

1170
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,241
Yeah.

1171
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:33,074
Yeah.

1172
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,920
And uh,

1173
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,110
and I thought you had a fucker in the ass.

1174
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,100
Like I didn't know that

1175
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,940
there was a vagina.

1176
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:39,421
I just thought,

1177
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:40,090
you know,

1178
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,200
there is an ass you have,

1179
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,330
so you fucker in the ass.

1180
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,040
Why with a condom and she has a kid.

1181
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,553
Wow.

1182
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,123
Are,

1183
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,170
but the fucked up thing is now I fucked
girls don't want to have a kid so I

1184
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:53,850
don't wear a condom and I
fucked him in the policy.

1185
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:58,851
So it did have some kind of an influence
on my future when I was in high school,

1186
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:03,600
and I don't remember where I learned
this or if it was taught in class,

1187
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:06,430
but I specifically remember
something where it was,

1188
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:10,290
it was like a real source where they
were saying that in order for a woman to

1189
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,690
get pregnant that she
has to have an orgasm.

1190
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,580
Because when a woman has an orgasm,

1191
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:17,010
it opens up the canal
and the eggs get through.

1192
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,910
I remember like there's been some just
ridiculously ignorant shit that I was

1193
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:21,540
taught.

1194
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,111
Yeah,

1195
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:22,851
that is I,

1196
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:23,191
I would,

1197
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:25,880
I would think maybe
because of the moisture,

1198
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,481
you know,

1199
00:36:26,481 --> 00:36:30,590
it gives a little more fluid
for the sperm cells to swim up.

1200
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:32,510
But it was like a door
was open at that anyway,

1201
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,850
like a door was opening.

1202
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,280
There's like 1980s healthcare shit.

1203
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:39,710
I Dunno if they didn't know
back then or they just,

1204
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,580
it was an older even textbook
where they were just ridiculous.

1205
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,650
That sounds like something
you'd tell a girl like,

1206
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,543
so you could come,

1207
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:47,691
look,

1208
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:50,270
I won't give you an
Oregon and you'll be fine.

1209
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,230
As long as they don't make you calm when
I'm making any bays and then after I

1210
00:36:54,231 --> 00:36:54,680
come,

1211
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,640
I'll make you come.

1212
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:01,401
Yeah.

1213
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:02,850
There's nothing better than that.

1214
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:03,900
Well,

1215
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,370
as long as you do that in,

1216
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:05,820
in,

1217
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,400
you know you're a rapist
because then the woman can say,

1218
00:37:08,401 --> 00:37:10,500
I'm withdrawing consent
because he tricked me.

1219
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,530
I said I was going to get to come after
the fact and now I want to put them in

1220
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:13,950
jail.

1221
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,080
You can't withdraw consent.

1222
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,030
That's something that can't be done.

1223
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:19,010
It's you.

1224
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,000
You consented and it happened.

1225
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,260
Nope,

1226
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,093
not anymore.

1227
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,390
The rules have changed.

1228
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,430
The rules are changed.

1229
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,900
Male feminists have stepped in
and support and this as well.

1230
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,030
It's fucking dangerous.

1231
00:37:29,031 --> 00:37:29,864
Dangerous.

1232
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,400
It's dangerous because
people were actually like,

1233
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:32,671
it's,

1234
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:33,990
it's affecting people's lives.

1235
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:34,680
They're going to jail.

1236
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,560
Like this kid that got expelled
from Occidental College.

1237
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,700
Meanwhile the girl didn't.

1238
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,080
That's sexist.

1239
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,550
That is absolutely sexist.

1240
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:41,801
Yeah.

1241
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,180
Yeah.

1242
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,200
It's confusing.

1243
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,980
I saw the best White Knight
tweet once a guy said,

1244
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,430
ah,

1245
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,480
I'm going to stop calling
myself a feminist because
it's up to women to decide

1246
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:53,400
whether or not I do feminism correctly.

1247
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,983
Oh,

1248
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:55,741
tweeted it.

1249
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:56,490
He tweeted it.

1250
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,323
Wow.

1251
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,590
I'm putting it all out there,

1252
00:37:58,591 --> 00:37:59,100
girls.

1253
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,530
Yeah.

1254
00:37:59,530 --> 00:37:59,780
Yeah.

1255
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,360
He should just come over his head and
beat him to death with a brick just

1256
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,030
kicking his front door and just smash him.

1257
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,171
Fuck.

1258
00:38:07,171 --> 00:38:09,180
You're fucking up everything
with your nonsense.

1259
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:13,350
You're stretching the curve out
way past the boundaries of reality.

1260
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,400
You are out.

1261
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,091
You fringe.

1262
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:16,680
Fuck you fucking Weirdo.

1263
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,930
Do you think with that
first blow to his head,

1264
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:20,190
he'd know exactly why you were?

1265
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,333
Yes.

1266
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:22,963
He'd be like,

1267
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,090
you didn't have to say a word.

1268
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,070
You didn't sres that blocking and going,

1269
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,491
no,

1270
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:31,410
I'm trying to get laid.

1271
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,953
No,

1272
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,990
cause he can't possibly said anything.

1273
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,810
Let's with these puppies and read
it over and over and over again.

1274
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,670
Just like this.

1275
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,040
Ah,

1276
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,480
it would be a great ironic website.

1277
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:47,314
Like,

1278
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,550
if you were a guy that was pretending to
be a male feminist and you were saying

1279
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:53,390
like these really
preposterous things like that,

1280
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,270
just see my website,

1281
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,091
it's fucking hilarious.

1282
00:38:55,091 --> 00:38:55,750
Check it out.

1283
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,990
Just subtly sell like a faggot,

1284
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,230
kill Steen's genius.

1285
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:02,650
Then it's just subtle enough
to jail your way into it.

1286
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:02,840
Yeah.

1287
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,460
Yeah.

1288
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,470
It really is a amazing how,

1289
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,300
how easily people are bamboozled
online and we didn't know this.

1290
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:11,080
We really,

1291
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,080
we didn't have a good bead on
the masses before the Internet.

1292
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,890
We knew our friends,

1293
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,850
but they were pretty much like us because
that's how they become your friends.

1294
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,400
We didn't really know
just anonymous people.

1295
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,520
We knew movie stars and TV stars,

1296
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,450
um,

1297
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,790
and our friends and
that was pretty much it.

1298
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,440
Strange as you can see in the store.

1299
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:33,370
You'd might look and go,

1300
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,800
what an asshole and think.

1301
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,800
You'd never realize how many assholes
are out there until you got to see like

1302
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,240
everyone now has a voice
and their pictures,

1303
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:44,080
their families,

1304
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,220
how they live their lives,

1305
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:46,120
what they believe in,

1306
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:46,751
what they like,

1307
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:47,584
what they hate.

1308
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,800
And it really does open up
a open everybody up to see
like this world of Weirdos

1309
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,710
and strange people,

1310
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,450
but then where we are to them.

1311
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:58,810
You know,

1312
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,070
I understand that part.

1313
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,060
We're not these perfect beings
looking on where this asshole Joe,

1314
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,061
check the city,

1315
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:04,420
get out.

1316
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:04,570
Oh,

1317
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:04,771
we're,

1318
00:40:04,771 --> 00:40:05,140
we're up.

1319
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,950
Everyone's weird.

1320
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:06,281
Yeah.

1321
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:06,551
But,

1322
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:08,770
but to be able to see now,

1323
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:09,670
uh,

1324
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,750
what a lot of other people are thinking
and how they believe things and how they

1325
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:17,920
get tricked so easily how they
believe false news and uh,

1326
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,121
and uh,

1327
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:21,310
blogs that just like,

1328
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:23,050
they'll read a blog and,

1329
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,520
and believe it or the onion,

1330
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,260
an article from the onion,

1331
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:27,520
which is hysterical.

1332
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,020
It's a parody site and I have
gotten links and Anthony,

1333
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,200
check this out.

1334
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,450
I know you'll be talking about this.

1335
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,280
I can tell you it's a joke.

1336
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,570
It's just worse than the onion because
there's new ones that aren't even funny

1337
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,040
that just make shit up.

1338
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:44,230
But make sure you go to the website,

1339
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,240
they'll say it's a parody site
and there's a bunch of them.

1340
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,750
They're not even remotely
funny and just bullshit.

1341
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,920
They're just bullshit.

1342
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,870
My fucking sister calls me up and says,

1343
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:54,430
did you kill him out in line with a belt?

1344
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,510
I heard that one.

1345
00:40:55,511 --> 00:40:56,344
That was great,

1346
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,980
actually said you did.

1347
00:40:57,981 --> 00:41:00,730
That's pretty madly write
a fucking mountain line.

1348
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,680
I couldn't even kill a cat with a belt.

1349
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,840
Try to get a fucking house cat.

1350
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,790
Your cat Beavis you have a reserve.

1351
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,420
All right.

1352
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:08,660
Uh,

1353
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,640
it's a bangle.

1354
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:10,973
Yeah.

1355
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:11,651
Yeah.

1356
00:41:11,651 --> 00:41:11,921
It's,

1357
00:41:11,921 --> 00:41:12,210
it's,

1358
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,130
they're a little smaller than a
serval circles of fucking nuts.

1359
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:17,080
You can't even really have one in a house.

1360
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:18,040
They rip it apart.

1361
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,410
Really.

1362
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,840
The people that own servals,

1363
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,330
they have those houses that
you go into and you're like,

1364
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,931
oh yeah,

1365
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:23,261
okay.

1366
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:24,700
You really don't care about anything.

1367
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,330
I understand you'll live in the mountains
somewhere and stuff and that's cool.

1368
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,110
But uh,

1369
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:29,270
no,

1370
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,861
that's a bangle.

1371
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:30,470
It's like,

1372
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:30,940
it's,

1373
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,310
I think three generations
removed from an Asian

1374
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,500
leopard and a tabby mix.

1375
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,860
And then they breed
them with tabbies tabby,

1376
00:41:38,861 --> 00:41:39,291
tabby.

1377
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:43,160
And then you get this like
leopard spotted cool fucking cat.

1378
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,650
What does he do like around your house is,

1379
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,120
he's a maniac.

1380
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,930
He's fucking like really intense and,

1381
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,040
and just like,

1382
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:55,040
I'll come down the stairs
and I'll be pretty tired.

1383
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,870
Pajama pants on and shit.

1384
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,520
And it'll fly out of the dining
room and with all of his weight,

1385
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,720
throw the side of his body against your,

1386
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:06,980
you're a calf and then grab your leg.

1387
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,480
Like he's trying to throw you off balance
and then grabs you and sinks his teeth

1388
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:12,440
into you're a fucking leg.

1389
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,640
So He's trying to take you down.

1390
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:14,330
Yes.

1391
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:17,060
He's constantly trying to
take people down in the house.

1392
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,890
I've had a video of him,

1393
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,491
I guess.

1394
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:19,761
Yeah,

1395
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:20,700
there's a little beef.

1396
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,130
I guess he's outside there.

1397
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:24,620
I let them ask with always
in the Christmas tree,

1398
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:27,920
this is the one that amount a kitten when
you let him out when he was a kitten,

1399
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:28,681
then uh,

1400
00:42:28,681 --> 00:42:29,570
he goes crazy.

1401
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,650
He starts fucking,

1402
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:35,540
he gets this low slink walk and he's
constantly looking around and shit.

1403
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,190
It looks like a little wild animal.

1404
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,210
It's cool as fuck.

1405
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,313
Does he have balls?

1406
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:39,881
Uh Nah.

1407
00:42:39,881 --> 00:42:41,420
I had to cut those fuckers were right off.

1408
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,111
Yeah,

1409
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:42,531
they get,

1410
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:43,221
I've read that.

1411
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:44,210
It's just insane.

1412
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:49,070
They will piss off fucking pissing it
and like just fuck everything and come on

1413
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:49,904
shit and

1414
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,250
there great.

1415
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,090
He likes uh,

1416
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:58,120
he likes when girls have no shoes and
socks on bare feet walking around the

1417
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:02,180
house and he'll just attack and girls
are hilarious cause they just scream and

1418
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:03,290
run and he,

1419
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:03,561
you know,

1420
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:04,880
you run away from a cat.

1421
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:08,930
They fucking love that and they're
chasing them and I'll just laugh.

1422
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:10,910
And girls running around
the house getting a,

1423
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,440
how much does he weigh?

1424
00:43:12,441 --> 00:43:14,000
Like full grown now.

1425
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:14,631
Oh God,

1426
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:16,310
I don't even know what
the fuck would you say?

1427
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:19,430
He weighs about 16 pounds.

1428
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,293
Big fucking cat.

1429
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:20,511
Yeah.

1430
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:20,781
Yeah.

1431
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:22,040
He's pretty fucking big.

1432
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:22,431
He's,

1433
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:23,570
he's pretty cool though.

1434
00:43:23,571 --> 00:43:25,340
Like as far as a people cat goes,

1435
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:28,010
you'd come up to anybody that
comes to the door and you know,

1436
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,840
let's see you pet him and shit like that.

1437
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,670
He fetches honestly fetches not even like,

1438
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:32,910
you know,

1439
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,760
oh he'll sniff it or bring it somewhere.

1440
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,230
He brings the thing right back to you,

1441
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:41,180
sits there and waits again for you to
fucking throw it and brings it back to

1442
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:42,350
regular cat that did that.

1443
00:43:42,351 --> 00:43:44,020
It's pretty cold when a cat acts like,

1444
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,131
oh,

1445
00:43:44,131 --> 00:43:45,460
that's when he was a little ah,

1446
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,480
little little guy.

1447
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,160
He was trying to get my glasses off.

1448
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,170
Oh he's so cute now.

1449
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,070
And I saw his video.

1450
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:52,400
I'm like,

1451
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,960
I will put this online and
it will get a fuck load is,

1452
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,640
and it did so adorable.

1453
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:03,560
You can't beat a kitten
taking your glasses off if
you thought about getting him

1454
00:44:03,561 --> 00:44:04,394
a friend.

1455
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,360
Uh,

1456
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:05,820
well I,

1457
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,630
I have a friend who has a,

1458
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,490
uh,

1459
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:12,660
another bangle named Freddy and uh,

1460
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,570
she brings Freddy over the house and they,

1461
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,100
they brawl and shit.

1462
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,870
They have fun or they,

1463
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,130
they,

1464
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,450
they love fighting.

1465
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,460
It's like I have said,

1466
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:25,040
if you ever come to New York
and come up with a house,

1467
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,250
I would love for you to
call one of their fights.

1468
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:30,883
And then I just,

1469
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,250
I just come down like I had this thing
where I come downstairs because I hear

1470
00:44:35,251 --> 00:44:39,780
you calling a fight and I come down and
the cats are fighting on the floor and

1471
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:40,860
you're calling it and I just go,

1472
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:41,694
Joe,

1473
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,183
that's my couch.

1474
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:43,980
My cats,

1475
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,813
what are you doing?

1476
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,450
That would be cause they
brought in so fucking cold.

1477
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:48,631
Yeah,

1478
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:49,120
there you go.

1479
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,620
That's his little fetching
little fetch maneuver.

1480
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,270
It comes right back.

1481
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,380
Oh Wow.

1482
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:57,601
Oh,

1483
00:44:57,601 --> 00:44:59,190
he didn't want to be smart as shit.

1484
00:44:59,220 --> 00:44:59,521
Yeah,

1485
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:00,354
he's pretty.

1486
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,591
He's pretty cool.

1487
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:02,790
And then he catches too,

1488
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,573
like,

1489
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:05,851
well not that time.

1490
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:06,684
Great.

1491
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:07,560
Good.

1492
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:07,921
Thanks.

1493
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:08,221
Beep.

1494
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:09,054
You'll fucker.

1495
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,810
But that leopard a spot
pattern is really kind of,

1496
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:13,980
that sold me on it.

1497
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,350
What made you get them
the leopard pattern?

1498
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:17,930
I looked yet,

1499
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,890
I kinda,

1500
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,880
I guess I guess being alone
in a big house for that long,

1501
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:26,760
I needed something since
I don't believe in love.

1502
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,180
So it cat of,

1503
00:45:30,181 --> 00:45:31,014
you know,

1504
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,620
you'd dumped some food in the,

1505
00:45:32,621 --> 00:45:33,331
in the little,

1506
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:34,830
uh Oh,

1507
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:36,660
that was when you said he's smart.

1508
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,610
Here he is with his head stuck in the
trashcan lid and he thinks if he puts it

1509
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:42,444
back,

1510
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,710
fucking get back out of it.

1511
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,430
So it was kind of smart.

1512
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:46,820
Smart.

1513
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,760
That's a Freddy,

1514
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:48,840
his little pal.

1515
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,011
And then he,

1516
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:50,844
uh,

1517
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,810
he's frustrated.

1518
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,820
He does not like that at all.

1519
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:57,960
He figured out how to get it off.

1520
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:59,850
I took it off of him,

1521
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:00,690
the poor little guy.

1522
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,950
I feel bad for him when he gets
himself into dumb situations or bill,

1523
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:09,980
he'll jump up on the table that's been
like polished and shit and just fly right

1524
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:10,854
across it.

1525
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,040
And without any of that
cat grace that you've seen,

1526
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,420
hit the chair,

1527
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:16,141
fall down.

1528
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:18,570
He's bouncing off of things
like a pinball machine.

1529
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,540
It's really funny though to watch.

1530
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:23,900
And I'm a lonely cat guy in my house,

1531
00:46:23,901 --> 00:46:24,151
Joe.

1532
00:46:24,151 --> 00:46:24,984
Right.

1533
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,730
That's what it's come to.

1534
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,593
A lonely cat.

1535
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,251
You know,

1536
00:46:29,251 --> 00:46:31,800
I occasionally have some
bitches over though.

1537
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:32,634
You know,

1538
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,750
you gotta I tell I,

1539
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,310
I mean,

1540
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:36,480
like I said with this whole,

1541
00:46:36,481 --> 00:46:36,661
uh,

1542
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:38,010
I don't believe in love thing.

1543
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:42,630
I've had to convey to two girls
that do come over the house,

1544
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:43,290
um,

1545
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,030
that I am not a boyfriend.

1546
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,070
I'm not your boyfriend or anything.

1547
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:47,970
And it's so hard.

1548
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:48,803
It's a hard thing.

1549
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,420
You tell them so you're
not your boyfriend.

1550
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,950
I went through so many years,

1551
00:46:52,951 --> 00:46:53,700
Joe,

1552
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,770
of being with girls much too long,

1553
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,330
much longer than I should have.

1554
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:58,463
Um,

1555
00:46:58,570 --> 00:46:59,760
a couple of weeks.

1556
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:00,710
Yeah.

1557
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:01,440
Yeah,

1558
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:01,651
no,

1559
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:04,230
I was one of those fucking years guys.

1560
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:08,190
Like I've stayed in the marriage
that I hated for nine fucking years,

1561
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,390
nine years.

1562
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:13,260
I think radio was part of it because I
had gotten into radio halfway through the

1563
00:47:13,261 --> 00:47:13,890
marriage.

1564
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,350
So the second half I didn't
even pay attention to it.

1565
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,060
It was all about fucking radio.

1566
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,230
I mean radio is straight.

1567
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:19,650
I'm,

1568
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,780
I'm going to build this
in a concentrate on that.

1569
00:47:21,781 --> 00:47:26,460
So whatever burden she was was outweighed
by the pleasure of doing radio.

1570
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:27,541
Uh,

1571
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:28,410
but after nine years,

1572
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:28,771
that was,

1573
00:47:28,771 --> 00:47:29,500
that was it.

1574
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,040
So,

1575
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,360
but I jumped right from that into another
relationship that just lasted years.

1576
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:35,620
And then after that,

1577
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:39,040
when I started thinking
like maybe I shouldn't be,

1578
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,720
and to tell these girls like that,

1579
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:42,580
I feel for them so much,

1580
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:43,953
you know,

1581
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,460
and now I just say,

1582
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:46,294
look,

1583
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,800
understand what this is.

1584
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:50,050
We are not boyfriend and girlfriend.

1585
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,590
I am not in a relationship with you then.

1586
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:54,250
And it,

1587
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,083
it,

1588
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,620
it almost works.

1589
00:47:56,621 --> 00:47:57,430
I have to,

1590
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:58,660
I have to fine tune it.

1591
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,850
I'm almost there though.

1592
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,900
[inaudible] they don't get
the message and it's um,

1593
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:05,860
I start getting thing.

1594
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,240
But then when I stuck getting texts,

1595
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:07,930
I'd be like,

1596
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,520
these are girlfriend texts.

1597
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,650
We're not in a relationship.

1598
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,760
Yes,

1599
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:12,971
I go,

1600
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:13,980
this is a girl friend.

1601
00:48:13,981 --> 00:48:14,770
Texts look like.

1602
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:16,030
What's an example of a girlfriend?

1603
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,260
A girlfriend tax.

1604
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:18,250
Uh,

1605
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,230
you said I could do this.

1606
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:24,100
And then at the last minute you
told me that I can't do it with you.

1607
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,530
I can't go here or do this or something.

1608
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,520
I'm like,

1609
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,910
I change my mind or I have something
else where I made other plans.

1610
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,691
It happens.

1611
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:32,650
It fell through.

1612
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:34,031
Oh,

1613
00:48:34,031 --> 00:48:35,380
well you're treating me like shit.

1614
00:48:35,381 --> 00:48:35,980
This is,

1615
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,660
hey,

1616
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,150
no,

1617
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,520
that's a girlfriend that isn't a friend.

1618
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,410
If I call my friend Joe Curry,

1619
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,250
let's say,

1620
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:42,731
and I say,

1621
00:48:42,731 --> 00:48:43,300
Joe,

1622
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,190
this weekend I'm having
a party at the house.

1623
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:45,970
Come on over.

1624
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:46,331
It'd be like,

1625
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:46,990
okay.

1626
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,620
And then on Friday afternoon
I call them and say,

1627
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:51,160
Joe,

1628
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:51,993
no party.

1629
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:53,350
It's just not happening.

1630
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:54,370
I'm doing something else.

1631
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:54,911
All right,

1632
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:55,744
cool.

1633
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,330
That's like that.

1634
00:48:58,331 --> 00:48:59,980
Only if I could fuck Joe Curry.

1635
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,780
See the girls and you're trying
to make that you're trying to,

1636
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:07,990
I'm trying to make it
so they understand that,

1637
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:12,991
that they are one of my friends that are
girls that if we want to have sex and

1638
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:13,991
stuff,

1639
00:49:13,991 --> 00:49:14,830
that's great.

1640
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:16,000
It's cool and everything,

1641
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:21,330
but we can't have this relationship where
you live here and where where we are

1642
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:27,751
obligated to go out for certain
occasions because your mic top bitch or

1643
00:49:27,821 --> 00:49:29,440
something or whatever it is.

1644
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,180
What about them fucking other guys?

1645
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:32,021
Yeah.

1646
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:32,854
That doesn't happen.

1647
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,240
No,

1648
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,073
no,

1649
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:35,940
no.

1650
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,320
What were,

1651
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,153
you were an asshole.

1652
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,160
Who's this guy?

1653
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:39,461
No,

1654
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:39,741
they,

1655
00:49:39,741 --> 00:49:40,330
they,

1656
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:40,841
they could,

1657
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:42,160
I don't want to hear about it.

1658
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:42,491
Just like,

1659
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:43,810
I don't want to have
to tell them about it.

1660
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,440
Oh,

1661
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:44,651
I,

1662
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:45,700
I've heard this one like,

1663
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:46,020
oh,

1664
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,470
who are you going out with tonight?

1665
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,090
This is none of your business.

1666
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,620
It's none of your fucking business.

1667
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:51,161
Oh,

1668
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:51,431
is it?

1669
00:49:51,431 --> 00:49:52,810
This girl is at that one.

1670
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:53,500
Look up.

1671
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,221
I'm not telling you.

1672
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:55,000
Why would I tell you?

1673
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,870
Why wouldn't you?

1674
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,011
Oh God,

1675
00:49:57,011 --> 00:49:57,850
I don't want to hear this.

1676
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,110
I just don't want to hear it.

1677
00:49:59,500 --> 00:49:59,861
But that's,

1678
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:00,340
you know,

1679
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,470
there's certain patterns
in relationships to,

1680
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:05,110
people automatically fall into
and they think they're allowed to.

1681
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,220
Yes.

1682
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:06,701
These are,

1683
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:11,140
these are allowed because it's become
commonplace and that's what they've been

1684
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,370
used to their whole life.

1685
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:13,690
And that's what this,

1686
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:18,691
this a groove that the guys have fallen
into over the years where they know

1687
00:50:19,241 --> 00:50:19,510
like,

1688
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:20,230
oh my God,

1689
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,790
you just realize at one point you go,

1690
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:22,903
oh,

1691
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,400
I'm in a relationship.

1692
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:28,520
I didn't even want to be in one
when we were dating or something.

1693
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:29,600
Or just hanging out.

1694
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:30,291
Like,

1695
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:32,780
why does it always have to
turn into a relationship?

1696
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,180
And I've said to to girls before,

1697
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:35,690
I've said,

1698
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,080
relationships are the,

1699
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:37,790
the,

1700
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:41,900
the death knell for a good companionship.

1701
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:44,570
All of a sudden now there's obligations,

1702
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,190
responsibilities,

1703
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:47,750
accountabilities,

1704
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:50,900
all these things that come
along with a relationship,

1705
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:52,850
take away from the good
parts of hanging out,

1706
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:54,290
which is we're watching TV,

1707
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:54,861
we're drinking,

1708
00:50:54,861 --> 00:50:55,694
we're fucking,

1709
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:56,810
we're going out to dinner.

1710
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,110
We're not arguing about
anything because that my phone,

1711
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:00,351
oh,

1712
00:51:00,351 --> 00:51:01,184
I hope not.

1713
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,810
Oh Man.

1714
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,790
How did you manage to avoid your,

1715
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,390
so you avoided a,

1716
00:51:11,391 --> 00:51:12,500
you avoided children.

1717
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:13,291
You got no children.

1718
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:14,124
Yes,

1719
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,373
that's a big one.

1720
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,270
That is the biggest,

1721
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,960
because I almost had a kid with my wife,

1722
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,610
which would have just been,

1723
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,170
I'd have had to kill myself.

1724
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:26,540
I think I would still have to
do something to get out of it.

1725
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:27,570
Um,

1726
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:27,850
Eh,

1727
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:28,100
Eh,

1728
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,640
yeah.

1729
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,060
Yeah.

1730
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:29,630
She,

1731
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:30,441
she got first,

1732
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:32,420
she got one of those ectopic pregnancies,

1733
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,830
which happens in the Fallopian tube
and blows up and she started bleeding

1734
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,750
internally and a boy,

1735
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,590
if I had a future me came back at the
moment I was driving into the hospital,

1736
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:46,730
I may have made a stop at
Mcdonald's first or you know,

1737
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:49,490
I might've had to pick a few things
up while she was in the passenger seat

1738
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,353
bleeding to death.

1739
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,253
Oh my goodness.

1740
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,030
Oh,

1741
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:55,250
well you say this because she,

1742
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,420
she basically,

1743
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,111
I mean,

1744
00:51:57,111 --> 00:51:59,120
how much money did she
take over the years?

1745
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,290
There was a bad divorce.

1746
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:04,340
It's seven figures she took
and her long period of time to,

1747
00:52:04,341 --> 00:52:04,571
right.

1748
00:52:04,571 --> 00:52:04,760
Yeah.

1749
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,740
She got Dominic Barbara for her lawyer,

1750
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:07,641
you know,

1751
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:09,470
famed bloated Howard Stern attorney.

1752
00:52:09,471 --> 00:52:09,921
But Dominic,

1753
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:14,921
Barbara was her lawyer and he was
just so much fucking anger that I had.

1754
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:17,660
You think I'm angry now?

1755
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:18,650
People wow.

1756
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:19,640
Oh,

1757
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,473
was I angry?

1758
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,673
Um,

1759
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:22,671
and yeah,

1760
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:24,860
I hated them.

1761
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,360
I hated that whole camp.

1762
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,590
The lawyers,

1763
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,390
they'd come in and I,

1764
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,040
I had to pay her legal bills,

1765
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,920
which is another one of those great
fucking amazing feminist things.

1766
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,650
I had to pay our legal bills and mine.

1767
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,360
So she hires Dominic Barbara and he's
just this fucking way expensive attorney.

1768
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,141
And I think,

1769
00:52:42,141 --> 00:52:42,321
well,

1770
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:43,310
I got to save some money,

1771
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:44,990
so let me hire a cheaper attorney.

1772
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:45,741
Oh,

1773
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:46,551
that doesn't work,

1774
00:52:46,551 --> 00:52:47,384
Joe.

1775
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:49,050
That's ridiculous.

1776
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:53,900
I had a guy that would come in with
like a Manila folder into court and they

1777
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:54,320
were,

1778
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,050
they had hand trucks of,

1779
00:52:57,051 --> 00:53:02,051
of those big boxes of legal
briefs and stuff on their site.

1780
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,054
And I'm just,

1781
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,100
I was just like,

1782
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:04,251
oh,

1783
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:06,050
this is the worst thing ever.

1784
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,160
And uh,

1785
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:07,341
we,

1786
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:07,550
yeah,

1787
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:11,210
over the course of quite a few years I
had to keep paying her and paying her and

1788
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:11,841
then it was over.

1789
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:13,400
And I'm very happy with that.

1790
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,720
Do you ever communicate with her now?

1791
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:15,560
No.

1792
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,290
Thank God and I don't have to and
if I had kids I would have to,

1793
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,570
I don't understand how that happens.

1794
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,340
I like a lot of people say,

1795
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:22,941
well no,

1796
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:23,720
you know,

1797
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,500
over the years we've built
up a nice relationship.

1798
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:25,641
I'm,

1799
00:53:25,641 --> 00:53:26,100
I'm friends

1800
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,851
with my ex wife was like,

1801
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:27,600
no you're not.

1802
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:32,600
You had to develop something or you
would have killed her or yourself or

1803
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:33,984
everyone involved.

1804
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:38,820
You have a kid so you have to kind of
build some type of relationship with her.

1805
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:43,230
I have a buddy who's friends with his ex
girlfriend and his ex girlfriend is now

1806
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:46,590
married to another one of his friends
and they have kids together and they get

1807
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:47,970
all their kids together and play.

1808
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:48,923
That's weird.

1809
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,310
That's just odd.

1810
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,680
I don't think it ever goes away.

1811
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:54,510
I don't think that you fucked her.

1812
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:55,350
Ever goes away.

1813
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:56,251
No,

1814
00:53:56,251 --> 00:53:57,084
probably not.

1815
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,010
Probably not.

1816
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:58,830
The uh,

1817
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:01,470
the ex boyfriend and the new husband,

1818
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,220
they do have a little weird thing with
each other and the new husband will

1819
00:54:05,221 --> 00:54:09,750
occasionally criticize the ex boyfriend
and a little bit of an over excessive

1820
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:10,290
way.

1821
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:10,980
Wow.

1822
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,490
Cause he knows that it's kind of coasting,

1823
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,160
gone on their lip and
the Dick to the misses

1824
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:18,870
pretends to be cool with it.

1825
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:22,470
But we know he's a lot
of weirdness to it all.

1826
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:23,610
No weirdness.

1827
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:25,443
Oh,

1828
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,760
but you got a note hand tall.

1829
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,231
That's true.

1830
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:28,421
Yeah.

1831
00:54:28,421 --> 00:54:28,681
Yeah.

1832
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:29,071
Dominic,

1833
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:29,490
Barbara,

1834
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:33,390
the lawyer for why he came to my house,

1835
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:34,653
um,

1836
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,600
a couple of months ago for what?

1837
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:37,351
Knocked on the door.

1838
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:42,351
It came to the house because he heard
that I got fired from Sirius Xm and he was

1839
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:43,320
like,

1840
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,060
I just got out of rehab,

1841
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,430
drugs and alcohol ruined my life.

1842
00:54:47,431 --> 00:54:49,110
I no longer have a law practice.

1843
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:49,670
I'm,

1844
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:50,340
you know,

1845
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:54,780
he got arrested for stealing from one
of the stores of the Miracle Mile there

1846
00:54:54,781 --> 00:54:56,550
and a lot on long island.

1847
00:54:56,551 --> 00:54:57,690
And um,

1848
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,340
and he's just,

1849
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,600
he's destitute now.

1850
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,920
He was living on his friend's couch.

1851
00:55:01,921 --> 00:55:06,330
He went from that attorney that was always
on Howard's show and made millions of

1852
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:06,331
dollars,

1853
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:08,130
obviously made some off of me.

1854
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:08,851
Uh,

1855
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:10,410
and then he's just destitute now.

1856
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,071
So I,

1857
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:14,390
I read the stories in the paper before
I got fired and everything and ended,

1858
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:15,240
I'll always laughed.

1859
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:15,601
I thought,

1860
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:16,170
good,

1861
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:16,741
good for him,

1862
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:17,880
Karma motherfucker.

1863
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,073
Um,

1864
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:19,711
but,

1865
00:55:19,711 --> 00:55:20,161
and if you,

1866
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:21,450
if you crow about Karma,

1867
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:22,141
isn't that bad?

1868
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:22,974
Karmically,

1869
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:23,380
thanks.

1870
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,181
I think it is too.

1871
00:55:24,181 --> 00:55:24,740
So,

1872
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,050
Eh,

1873
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:25,860
whatever.

1874
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:26,693
Um,

1875
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,493
but uh,

1876
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:28,990
he,

1877
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:29,380
he,

1878
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:32,130
he knocked on my door and I'm looking at
the window like I think that's fucking

1879
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:32,964
Dominic Barbara.

1880
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,510
And he comes in and he was trying
to preach to me like he's saying,

1881
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:37,080
uh,

1882
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:37,310
uh,

1883
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,660
I read what happened and
I'm thinking maybe you know,

1884
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:42,780
you need help or something or
he wants to be your sponsor.

1885
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:47,810
Fuck what talking about probably a sees
you as an opportunity to get back into

1886
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:48,991
the limelight.

1887
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:52,050
And B feels bad that he
stole your fucking money,

1888
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,380
maybe it,

1889
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:55,140
and he might've been doing one of those,

1890
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,003
uh,

1891
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:00,660
12 step things where he's got to make
some kind of reconcile affiliation with

1892
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:01,220
me.

1893
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:01,500
Uh,

1894
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,340
so he came over,

1895
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:02,851
he did that,

1896
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:04,320
but then at the end he sees like,

1897
00:56:04,321 --> 00:56:05,520
so you've got the new show,

1898
00:56:05,521 --> 00:56:06,600
you're going to be starting up.

1899
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:06,811
I'm like,

1900
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:06,961
yeah.

1901
00:56:06,961 --> 00:56:07,470
He goes,

1902
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:07,891
you know,

1903
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:10,590
I know this advertising thing where this,

1904
00:56:10,591 --> 00:56:13,890
and then he's pitching some type
of advertising for the show.

1905
00:56:13,891 --> 00:56:15,060
So yeah.

1906
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,171
So he,

1907
00:56:16,171 --> 00:56:17,004
uh,

1908
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,210
he left his number let,

1909
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:18,670
and if people,

1910
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,730
you stole money from
me fucking out of here.

1911
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,081
Yes.

1912
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:21,901
And people were saying that.

1913
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:22,171
They're like,

1914
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:24,010
why did you even let them

1915
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,641
in your house?

1916
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:24,800
Why?

1917
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,633
You know,

1918
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,300
and they're saying you should've shot
him when he got in the house and say that

1919
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,560
he just trying to attack you.

1920
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,390
He's crazy.

1921
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,740
Who was on drugs,

1922
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,040
money.

1923
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,520
He's destined to look
at his fucking record,

1924
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:37,354
man.

1925
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,270
And,

1926
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,680
and check this knife out.

1927
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:42,390
Yes,

1928
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:43,840
it matches my cutlery set,

1929
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:45,590
but very well,

1930
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,170
very popular item.

1931
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:47,861
Yeah.

1932
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:50,440
So people were asking me
that and I don't know,

1933
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,870
I can't really do that.

1934
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:53,261
I don't know.

1935
00:56:53,261 --> 00:56:55,360
I'm not the get the fuck out guy.

1936
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:59,770
I'd rather just k come in and I had
a fan come to my fucking house once,

1937
00:56:59,771 --> 00:57:01,720
just knocked on the door and he's like,

1938
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:02,231
hey.

1939
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:03,220
And I'm like,

1940
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,293
hey.

1941
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:04,720
He goes,

1942
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:04,891
yeah,

1943
00:57:04,891 --> 00:57:06,220
I found out where you lived.

1944
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:07,241
I just thought maybe,

1945
00:57:07,241 --> 00:57:07,451
you know,

1946
00:57:07,451 --> 00:57:09,540
I can hang out and have a beer and,

1947
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:10,570
and I'm looking going,

1948
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:11,423
all right,

1949
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:12,940
I can do this two ways.

1950
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,620
I could fucking tell him,

1951
00:57:14,621 --> 00:57:16,270
get the fuck Outta here and,

1952
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:21,360
and he leaves pissed off and I have no
idea who he is or I can have him come

1953
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:22,690
into the backyard,

1954
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,750
grab a beer and interrogate
him pretty much.

1955
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,330
And that's what was done.

1956
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:29,243
That's came in,

1957
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,011
had a beer.

1958
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:31,660
We found out everything about him.

1959
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:32,860
I gave all the info to Keith,

1960
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:34,540
he ran them and you know,

1961
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:36,250
figured he didn't have any problems.

1962
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:39,100
He's a married guy with
kids and he lives out,

1963
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:39,520
uh,

1964
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,700
out on long island is stony
brook I think somewhere weird.

1965
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,440
Yeah.

1966
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,670
And so there are two ways
you could deal with that.

1967
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,530
And I had been wondering,

1968
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:47,830
you know,

1969
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:48,880
who was that guy?

1970
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:50,020
And now he's pissed.

1971
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:52,060
Now he's a disgruntled fan,

1972
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:52,871
you know,

1973
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:53,920
now I can pretty much tell them,

1974
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:54,011
hey,

1975
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:54,821
you had a beer at my house.

1976
00:57:54,821 --> 00:57:55,480
Shut the fuck up.

1977
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,313
Leave me alone.

1978
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,011
You know,

1979
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:57,461
and maybe,

1980
00:57:57,461 --> 00:58:00,580
but then there's that stalkerish
angle where I'm friends with them now.

1981
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,080
I could just come over any time.

1982
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:03,401
Did he ever do it?

1983
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:04,300
Did you ever come by again?

1984
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:04,601
No,

1985
00:58:04,601 --> 00:58:04,931
he didn't.

1986
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:07,030
But me and Keith saw him
at the Mexican place.

1987
00:58:07,031 --> 00:58:07,660
Uh,

1988
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:11,650
we were eating at about a month
ago and he came up and was like,

1989
00:58:11,651 --> 00:58:11,891
hey,

1990
00:58:11,891 --> 00:58:12,441
how you doing?

1991
00:58:12,441 --> 00:58:12,671
I was like,

1992
00:58:12,671 --> 00:58:13,151
Hey,

1993
00:58:13,151 --> 00:58:15,010
look at what is the fucking crazy guy?

1994
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,380
But he's married,

1995
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:19,240
he's got kids and New Orleans has,

1996
00:58:19,241 --> 00:58:22,300
he has a Facebook account
and I see his Facebook posts,

1997
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:25,690
his kid like rides horses
and why a nice place.

1998
00:58:25,691 --> 00:58:26,740
He's holds a job,

1999
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:27,590
you know,

2000
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:28,430
it's a fan.

2001
00:58:28,431 --> 00:58:28,840
So he,

2002
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,621
Jay turned out,

2003
00:58:29,621 --> 00:58:30,910
he was just a fan.

2004
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:31,744
And you know what,

2005
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,290
I really don't have any
problem with certain fans.

2006
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:39,280
A lot of the people that come over to my
parties were formerly just fans of the

2007
00:58:39,281 --> 00:58:41,380
show or people that were on the show,

2008
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,630
a crazy fucking big a.

2009
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:44,440
And a,

2010
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,090
and my buddy Dennis and,

2011
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:47,980
and all of my poker playing friends,

2012
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:52,180
they were pretty much fans of the show
that through one way or another hanging

2013
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:52,361
out.

2014
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:57,361
I figured they were pretty cool and a
responsible and I kind of shoot up or rob

2015
00:58:58,061 --> 00:58:58,631
my house.

2016
00:58:58,631 --> 00:58:58,991
So,

2017
00:58:58,991 --> 00:58:59,620
uh,

2018
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,670
they come over and,

2019
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:01,504
uh,

2020
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:04,240
when your house to be one of
the worst places to rob anyway,

2021
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:08,140
because you're armed to the teeth and
your fucking houses strategically set up,

2022
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,380
case breaks through,

2023
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:15,050
you're pressing fucking
buttons and safety,

2024
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:19,300
the magnetically locked
doors that are alarmed.

2025
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:20,163
I'm not kidding.

2026
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:21,820
And all kinds of,

2027
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:22,251
yeah,

2028
00:59:22,251 --> 00:59:23,630
magnetically locked doors,

2029
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:25,730
magnetically locked.

2030
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:27,560
They got separate alarm systems on,

2031
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,071
on them.

2032
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:29,630
Just a separate from the house.

2033
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:30,500
Uh,

2034
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,011
and you know,

2035
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:32,390
that's like the gun storage,

2036
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:33,260
shit like that.

2037
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,093
Cause you don't want,

2038
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:35,810
you don't want anybody guns.

2039
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:37,340
I'm not even sure.

2040
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:38,570
It's probably,

2041
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:39,890
I'm probably almost a hundred.

2042
00:59:39,891 --> 00:59:41,540
Maybe we're around there.

2043
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,120
That's a lot of rifles and stuff and uh,

2044
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:45,410
yeah,

2045
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:45,890
it's uh,

2046
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:47,870
but in New York it's
getting very tough to,

2047
00:59:47,871 --> 00:59:48,620
uh,

2048
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,860
to own rifles that anything
but a lever action.

2049
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:54,800
You're going to a gun store in New
York now it looks like 18 hundreds.

2050
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:56,320
It's all lender stanchion.

2051
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,850
Fucking the riflemen during actions,

2052
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:00,651
bolt actions,

2053
01:00:00,651 --> 01:00:01,371
a lot of those.

2054
01:00:01,371 --> 01:00:04,370
But ar fifteens you just
can't find them anymore.

2055
01:00:04,371 --> 01:00:06,590
Semiautomatics things like that.

2056
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,640
Um,

2057
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,260
and that's a whole nother discussion,

2058
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:09,820
uh,

2059
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:14,820
about the effectiveness of banning certain
weapons as a opposed to banning box

2060
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:15,400
ones.

2061
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,600
Didn't they make it so that the magazine's
size was literally non-existent.

2062
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:21,980
Like the legal magazine size for guns,

2063
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:26,480
they made it seven rounds and
magazines only come in five,

2064
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:27,290
10,

2065
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:27,980
15,

2066
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:28,813
things like that.

2067
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:29,600
Um,

2068
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:34,100
so by saying seven rounds and then
outlawing the 10 round magazine,

2069
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:34,700
this is,

2070
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:35,720
it was a very calculated,

2071
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,500
they said,

2072
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,780
we only want you to load
seven rounds in your,

2073
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:40,220
in your clip and your magazine.

2074
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:40,971
So you go,

2075
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:41,720
okay,

2076
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,450
and we're banning 10 round magazines.

2077
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:45,441
So it's like,

2078
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,680
so what you're saying is I can only
have five rounds because that's the only

2079
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:51,710
magazine available to
me that isn't over the,

2080
01:00:51,711 --> 01:00:53,120
the seven round limit.

2081
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:54,403
And uh,

2082
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:54,861
so they,

2083
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:56,300
they put the Kibosh on that.

2084
01:00:56,301 --> 01:00:57,710
They figured that was excessive.

2085
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:02,270
So now you're allowed to have the 10
round magazine and 10 rounds in it.

2086
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,350
You are allowed.

2087
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:03,940
Yes.

2088
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,150
She fought against it.

2089
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,430
They changed it.

2090
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:06,700
Yeah.

2091
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:06,921
Who,

2092
01:01:06,921 --> 01:01:07,754
who changed it?

2093
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:09,230
It was appealed the court,

2094
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:12,290
the Supreme Court in New
York over through that.

2095
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:13,550
And they're constantly,

2096
01:01:13,551 --> 01:01:14,750
all of the New York,

2097
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:15,200
uh,

2098
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:15,650
uh,

2099
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:17,660
chapters of the NRA and New York,

2100
01:01:17,661 --> 01:01:21,410
a rifle associations
are constantly battling,

2101
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:21,680
uh,

2102
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,580
legislation.

2103
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,520
Um,

2104
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,340
uh,

2105
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,240
supposedly gun control legislation,

2106
01:01:26,241 --> 01:01:27,074
gun safety.

2107
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:28,400
They always call it good stuff.

2108
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,400
Safe that this safety act,

2109
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:33,170
it's never taking away.

2110
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:34,820
Laws never are,

2111
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,220
uh,

2112
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:35,720
you know,

2113
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,240
anti gun law or take away
gun laws or it's not,

2114
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:40,640
it's a safety law.

2115
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,620
It's for your pleasure.

2116
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:43,610
It's everything.

2117
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:46,640
Everything that is given
to us by the government.

2118
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:47,211
Thank you.

2119
01:01:47,211 --> 01:01:48,044
Government,

2120
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:49,970
which is supposed to be the people.

2121
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,060
Everything that's given to
us is presented in a look,

2122
01:01:53,061 --> 01:01:53,151
oh,

2123
01:01:53,151 --> 01:01:54,950
we're giving you the,

2124
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,320
the marriage protection act.

2125
01:01:57,321 --> 01:01:57,561
You know,

2126
01:01:57,561 --> 01:01:57,901
you want to,

2127
01:01:57,901 --> 01:01:59,450
we was protect marriage.

2128
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:04,570
It's not the fuck the gaze law
and gays can't get married law.

2129
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:09,500
We're protecting something here and that's
how it's presented because they know

2130
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:13,440
that people are going to call
them out on being anti gay.

2131
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,480
So they're getting no,

2132
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:15,321
we're not anti gay.

2133
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:17,000
We're just pro marriage.

2134
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:20,070
It's the same thing with
everything government tries

2135
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,300
to present to you.

2136
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:22,350
It's convenient,

2137
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:23,041
it's nice,

2138
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:24,330
it's safety.

2139
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,560
And then you realize,

2140
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,050
how about the Patriot
Patriot Act is another one.

2141
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:28,561
I,

2142
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:29,640
if I don't agree with this,

2143
01:02:29,641 --> 01:02:30,830
I'm not a patriot.

2144
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,770
The Patriot Act,

2145
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:33,390
your Antonio and something good.

2146
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,650
And it's so,

2147
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:39,540
I mean the hacky thing obviously is to
bring up 1984 and the way language was

2148
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:42,390
used in that book and,

2149
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,400
and it's so real,

2150
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,530
it's crazier and it's all semantics.

2151
01:02:46,531 --> 01:02:49,740
It's crazier than 1984 then the bus.

2152
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:52,320
And I'm wonder what it's going
to be like 50 years from now.

2153
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:53,183
I really do.

2154
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:53,730
I Dunno.

2155
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,470
I think the end of the world's
come in like next week.

2156
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:58,650
Any day you could just see at
the downfalls society please,

2157
01:02:58,651 --> 01:02:58,891
please.

2158
01:02:58,891 --> 01:02:59,341
I hope so.

2159
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:00,060
I hope so.

2160
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:00,841
Like the Ebola thing.

2161
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:02,760
Everyone loves talking about Ebola.

2162
01:03:02,761 --> 01:03:03,690
I'm scared of the ball.

2163
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:05,310
I'm,

2164
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:08,610
I'm scared of the fact that
something like that exists.

2165
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:12,090
I'm not scared that there's going to
be a big outbreak here in this country.

2166
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:12,600
Why?

2167
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,320
Um,

2168
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,120
I,

2169
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,630
I think,

2170
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,790
I think it's,

2171
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,290
it's not,

2172
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:23,550
I think it's more sanitary
conditions than it is,

2173
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:24,443
uh,

2174
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,730
people getting it from each other.

2175
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:30,840
I think in West Africa you
have hard sanitary conditions.

2176
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,780
People are literally living in,

2177
01:03:32,781 --> 01:03:33,600
in Shit,

2178
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,680
the shit flowing down.

2179
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,980
You walk out of your little shack and
there's shit going down the street.

2180
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,060
And uh,

2181
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:43,530
I think those conditions and
eating bushmeat and shit like that,

2182
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:45,420
not what we consider Bushmeat,

2183
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:47,630
which I love here in devastates.

2184
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:53,250
You see what he just put up plain
detained over Las Vegas for fears pasture,

2185
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:54,270
heady bowl symptoms.

2186
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:55,201
Now the,

2187
01:03:55,201 --> 01:03:58,560
could that be the guy
that coughed on a plane?

2188
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,551
Some paranoia.

2189
01:03:59,551 --> 01:04:00,060
I Dunno.

2190
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:03,420
Some guy I just saw on the news before
he was coughing and then he goes,

2191
01:04:03,421 --> 01:04:03,601
oh,

2192
01:04:03,601 --> 01:04:04,351
I got Ebola.

2193
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,370
He said that to somebody.

2194
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,740
They pulled him off the
plane in space suits,

2195
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:10,200
they fall off the blight and spaces.

2196
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,850
That's like saying you have a gun,

2197
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:12,391
right?

2198
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:13,110
It's the new,

2199
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,520
I have a gun where,

2200
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:15,330
you know,

2201
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:19,110
through the airport security where you
put your bag on going to La and I hope

2202
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:20,430
they don't find the bomb in there.

2203
01:04:20,431 --> 01:04:21,210
Right.

2204
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:21,451
Hey,

2205
01:04:21,451 --> 01:04:22,620
we're going to have fun in Vegas.

2206
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:22,951
Yeah,

2207
01:04:22,951 --> 01:04:23,784
no you're not.

2208
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:28,530
You're going back here for the old
full body cabinet is no jokes in Vegas.

2209
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,740
You not allowed to have no jokes at
the security of the airport rather.

2210
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:32,110
Oh,

2211
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:32,611
that's amazing.

2212
01:04:32,611 --> 01:04:33,444
People still do that.

2213
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,880
And this guy said he
bullet and they came in,

2214
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,960
grabbed him and fucking
took them off the plane.

2215
01:04:39,961 --> 01:04:41,010
Space suits.

2216
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:41,791
Amazing.

2217
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:42,870
People are petrified.

2218
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:43,171
Well,

2219
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:48,171
it's so contagious and it does have a
100% mortality rate here in this country.

2220
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:49,400
Right?

2221
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,250
The one case.

2222
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:52,830
So there's two people that have it write,

2223
01:04:52,831 --> 01:04:56,430
a second person was brought
in to La from Liberia.

2224
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:58,020
They found out that he
doesn't have it though.

2225
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:58,690
Oh,

2226
01:04:58,690 --> 01:04:59,760
and this guy in Vegas,

2227
01:04:59,761 --> 01:05:00,301
supposedly,

2228
01:05:00,301 --> 01:05:02,610
he just got back from Africa
and he puked on the plane.

2229
01:05:02,611 --> 01:05:04,800
So that's why the Christ,

2230
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,460
the fucked up thing is like
planes make people puke.

2231
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:10,680
So you're picking on the plane.

2232
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:11,853
He,

2233
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,110
that's why they have a bag in front of
the seats in front of every person for

2234
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:16,830
Puke.

2235
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,040
I've never puked on a plane though

2236
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:18,161
of,

2237
01:05:18,161 --> 01:05:18,950
you know,

2238
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:19,910
neither pussies.

2239
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,730
He's puking on you got a boat?

2240
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:22,751
Uh,

2241
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:23,370
no I haven't.

2242
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:24,640
I've puked on boats.

2243
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:25,360
Yeah,

2244
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,193
yeah.

2245
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,371
It's socks.

2246
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:28,780
Cause I love boats,

2247
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:29,643
but it gets you.

2248
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:30,261
Yeah,

2249
01:05:30,261 --> 01:05:33,160
but like Keith's got
one and I go out on a,

2250
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:33,371
you know,

2251
01:05:33,371 --> 01:05:35,050
the great South Bay and Shit like that,

2252
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:35,610
um,

2253
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:37,520
on long island and it's cool.

2254
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:38,021
That's fine.

2255
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:39,100
I've got no problem with that.

2256
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:40,000
Uh,

2257
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,050
but so like going deep sea
fishing and which I love doing.

2258
01:05:44,051 --> 01:05:44,591
It's fine.

2259
01:05:44,591 --> 01:05:49,110
You're having a good time and then it's
so weird how it hits you seasickness

2260
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,140
cause you'll just be,

2261
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:50,930
yeah,

2262
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:51,540
fucking haggard.

2263
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,373
The whole,

2264
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:54,130
what the hell was that?

2265
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,100
And all of a sudden you just get sick.

2266
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:57,810
Yeah.

2267
01:05:57,810 --> 01:05:59,170
And you can't do anything.

2268
01:05:59,171 --> 01:06:00,130
He'd start puking.

2269
01:06:00,131 --> 01:06:00,964
It's terrible.

2270
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:01,331
Yeah.

2271
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:02,920
It doesn't get me for whatever reason,

2272
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:06,460
but I know people that does get some
weirdest visual inner ear thing.

2273
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:09,020
It's your whole vision combined with your,

2274
01:06:09,021 --> 01:06:11,710
your balance and how the two,

2275
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,110
if they're separated too much,

2276
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,660
if they're not in
compliance with each other,

2277
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:17,590
it's like,

2278
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:18,101
all right,

2279
01:06:18,101 --> 01:06:18,940
make them vomit.

2280
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:20,410
I don't know why.

2281
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,300
I guess they assume you've been poisoned.

2282
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:26,800
Your body assumes it's been poisoned
and needs to get the poison out.

2283
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,121
Just get it.

2284
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:30,100
If I'm sitting in the backseat of
a car and I'm reading something,

2285
01:06:30,101 --> 01:06:31,930
that style make you queasy.

2286
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:34,430
All the bumps and like
staring at something also.

2287
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:35,790
Yeah.

2288
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:38,770
We have that swallowing thing
with the saliva starts coming up.

2289
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,430
Awful,

2290
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:39,990
right?

2291
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:40,610
Yeah,

2292
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:40,970
yeah,

2293
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:41,520
yeah.

2294
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,180
I'm not a friend of a,

2295
01:06:43,181 --> 01:06:44,014
of puking.

2296
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:44,801
Here's what's funny,

2297
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:47,950
that the drug that they use to
keep you from getting seasick,

2298
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:49,150
the those little patches,

2299
01:06:49,151 --> 01:06:49,984
those little things,

2300
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:50,911
it's scope.

2301
01:06:50,911 --> 01:06:55,120
Paula mean that's that same drug
as the Columbian Devil's breath,

2302
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,000
that they blow on you and they
turn you into a fucking Zombie.

2303
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,050
Get the fuck.

2304
01:06:59,400 --> 01:06:59,890
Yeah.

2305
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:00,723
Really?

2306
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,480
Yeah.

2307
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,500
That's that same drug.

2308
01:07:02,501 --> 01:07:05,170
Vice did a documentary on
Columbian Devil's breath.

2309
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:08,680
It's the exact same drug that they
use to keep you from getting seasick,

2310
01:07:08,681 --> 01:07:11,260
yet it's just a seasick
version is a very low,

2311
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:11,921
low dose,

2312
01:07:11,921 --> 01:07:12,220
right?

2313
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:12,790
Yeah.

2314
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:13,720
The Colombians,

2315
01:07:13,721 --> 01:07:17,170
they'll take this stuff and then they
blow it in your face and it goes up your

2316
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:18,340
nose and you're gone.

2317
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:23,720
You wow blowing in your face and you
literally become a Zombie and you'll move

2318
01:07:24,011 --> 01:07:24,850
shit for them.

2319
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:26,710
Commit murder or fucking dig holes.

2320
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,000
Does it ever wear off?

2321
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:28,420
Yeah.

2322
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:28,700
Oh,

2323
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,380
okay.

2324
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,540
That would be frightening.

2325
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:31,660
You don't have any recollection,

2326
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,220
you have no recollection.

2327
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:33,431
Yeah.

2328
01:07:33,431 --> 01:07:33,911
This stuff,

2329
01:07:33,911 --> 01:07:38,590
Columbian Devil's breath of people been
arrested and use that as a defense.

2330
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:39,041
No,

2331
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:39,851
but it's a good idea.

2332
01:07:39,851 --> 01:07:43,780
They think that it's also might be one
of the reasons why Haiti is so a Ebola

2333
01:07:43,781 --> 01:07:46,300
was told 4,007 months,

2334
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,510
233 of them are healthcare work.

2335
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:51,100
That's a lot of fucking people.

2336
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:51,491
Dead.

2337
01:07:51,491 --> 01:07:52,780
4,000 people.

2338
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:54,370
That's a thousand more than nine,

2339
01:07:54,371 --> 01:07:56,320
11 and seven months.

2340
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:57,281
Look at that guy.

2341
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:59,620
He's just crawling on the ground.

2342
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:04,621
What that is some real
repugnant poverty over there.

2343
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:05,261
Well,

2344
01:08:05,261 --> 01:08:06,130
when I was in,

2345
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:06,640
um,

2346
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,260
when I was doing the sci fi show,

2347
01:08:08,261 --> 01:08:10,840
we did an episode on hemorrhagic viruses.

2348
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:15,740
We did an episode on what they call
weaponize with weaponry and uh,

2349
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:19,670
we talked to them at the CDC center
that they have down in Galveston,

2350
01:08:19,671 --> 01:08:20,450
Texas,

2351
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:22,190
where they have these fucking,

2352
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:23,120
we went into the building,

2353
01:08:23,121 --> 01:08:28,121
they have these four foot thick walls
with solid glass and concrete and these

2354
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,960
ventilation systems.

2355
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:31,010
It's suck everything out.

2356
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:32,450
And everyone's wearing space suits.

2357
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:34,310
They want to meet or wear a
space suit and get in there.

2358
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:34,701
And I was like,

2359
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:36,170
get the fuck out of here.

2360
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:37,693
Going in there,

2361
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:38,211
you know,

2362
01:08:38,211 --> 01:08:39,230
like it's solely safe.

2363
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:39,620
I'm like,

2364
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:40,071
there's no,

2365
01:08:40,071 --> 01:08:40,311
no,

2366
01:08:40,311 --> 01:08:41,420
it's not totally safe.

2367
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,600
It's reasonably safe if fucking earthquake
happens and you're just system breaks

2368
01:08:47,511 --> 01:08:51,440
while I'm in there and I have to fucking
take my mask off to work the gear.

2369
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:51,891
No,

2370
01:08:51,891 --> 01:08:52,724
I'm dead.

2371
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,780
Fuck you.

2372
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,980
You bleed.

2373
01:08:54,981 --> 01:08:55,271
You be,

2374
01:08:55,271 --> 01:08:57,140
you bleed from everywhere.

2375
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,580
Your eyes bleed,

2376
01:08:58,581 --> 01:08:59,750
your asshole bleeds,

2377
01:08:59,751 --> 01:09:00,261
your mouth,

2378
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,080
your nose,

2379
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:01,240
your,

2380
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,840
your body starts to liquefy.

2381
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:04,220
You just start oozing.

2382
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:04,860
Ah,

2383
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,980
just so one of the worst ways to die ever.

2384
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:07,730
Innards.

2385
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:07,941
Yeah.

2386
01:09:07,941 --> 01:09:08,900
It's fucking terrible.

2387
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:11,050
And then I guess the,

2388
01:09:11,051 --> 01:09:11,571
that guy,

2389
01:09:11,571 --> 01:09:12,150
uh,

2390
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:12,510
uh,

2391
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:13,260
Dunkin,

2392
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:13,620
uh,

2393
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:14,241
what was his name?

2394
01:09:14,241 --> 01:09:15,740
That guy that just recently died.

2395
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,030
They came over from Liberia.

2396
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:21,870
His family is now criticizing the hospital
saying that they might not have given

2397
01:09:21,871 --> 01:09:22,880
him the care that,

2398
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:23,960
what could he,

2399
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,730
they closed an entire floor.

2400
01:09:25,731 --> 01:09:28,310
He comes from Liberia through Brussels.

2401
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:29,840
Comes here gets,

2402
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:34,070
oh I do you think they weren't giving
him the most attention in that hospital

2403
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:37,340
out of any patient and
then the family was like,

2404
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:38,391
you know,

2405
01:09:38,391 --> 01:09:40,280
well we want an investigation.

2406
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:44,630
It's like you should be thanking
every doctor in that hospital.

2407
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:47,990
They should tell the family we're going
to have to kill you because you might be

2408
01:09:47,991 --> 01:09:48,470
contagious.

2409
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:49,310
Might be contagious.

2410
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:50,600
We'll just put the house on fire.

2411
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,980
Y'All in the house.

2412
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:52,311
Good.

2413
01:09:52,311 --> 01:09:52,790
Okay.

2414
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:55,610
Nobody allowed from Africa for a year.

2415
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,200
This has put a moratorium.

2416
01:09:57,201 --> 01:09:58,160
You keep your country.

2417
01:09:58,161 --> 01:10:00,320
We got ours come back one year.

2418
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,160
Yeah.

2419
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,300
I have friends that go to Africa
for hunting and they're still,

2420
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:05,450
and they're still going over there.

2421
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,010
Cameron Cameron Hanes.

2422
01:10:07,011 --> 01:10:09,050
You just went over there
and shot a bunch of shit.

2423
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:10,643
Their pictures,

2424
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:11,923
he Facebook,

2425
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:12,640
they don't,

2426
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,280
they're the type of person
that doesn't give a shit about,

2427
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:15,500
yeah,

2428
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,950
that doesn't give a fuck does every so
often those pictures come out and people

2429
01:10:18,951 --> 01:10:19,610
are like,

2430
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:20,410
oh,

2431
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:23,870
how dare you know what's interesting
and my friend Steve Rinella had a really

2432
01:10:23,871 --> 01:10:24,800
good point about this.

2433
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:29,030
The real outrage came when a
white girl was doing it through.

2434
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:33,770
It wasn't like some old fat man took a
picture of him with a line that he killed

2435
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,200
and everybody went crazy and
it got a million Facebook hits.

2436
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:36,770
No.

2437
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:40,430
There's old fat men that have Facebook
pages that are filled with fucking dead

2438
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:42,680
unicorns and no one gives a shit.

2439
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:43,370
No.

2440
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:46,790
It gives a shit because it's an old fat
man that nobody wants to have sex with,

2441
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:47,600
but they,

2442
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,460
you take one of those hot young chicks,

2443
01:10:49,461 --> 01:10:50,640
a cheerleader from Texas,

2444
01:10:50,641 --> 01:10:54,170
and she's got a pink bow which is
standing over a zebra and everybody loses

2445
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:54,890
their shit.

2446
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:55,610
Why?

2447
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:56,630
And sexism.

2448
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:57,081
Well,

2449
01:10:57,081 --> 01:10:58,100
that's how stupid is.

2450
01:10:58,101 --> 01:11:03,050
That was actually thought that Steven
Spielberg kill fucking triceratops

2451
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:08,230
lose,

2452
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:13,230
so fucking dumb people thought
that he killed a triceratops.

2453
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:14,250
People

2454
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,720
are so fucking stupid.

2455
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:19,720
I don't want you to use
on a triceratops around.

2456
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:20,750
Yeah,

2457
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:21,180
there's what,

2458
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:24,960
there's a lot of people that have those
websites where they go to Africa and

2459
01:11:24,961 --> 01:11:26,640
they kill animals and they
put them on the website.

2460
01:11:26,641 --> 01:11:27,474
Nobody gives a shit.

2461
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,020
Why is it that the hot young girl
with a pink bow and everything,

2462
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,330
she's the one that gets the,

2463
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:34,260
Oh you bitch,

2464
01:11:34,261 --> 01:11:35,910
you con well my friend Steve,

2465
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:37,500
he got a bunch of good points about it.

2466
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:38,400
One of the things you said,

2467
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:40,560
he said to believe a lot
of it is real sexism.

2468
01:11:40,561 --> 01:11:41,700
That's real sexism.

2469
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,770
Like if it's okay for a guy to do it,

2470
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:44,640
but if a girl does it,

2471
01:11:44,641 --> 01:11:48,870
everybody goes nuts and they don't want
pretty girls getting involved in that.

2472
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,070
Like for some reason.

2473
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:50,670
Wow.

2474
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:54,480
Like first of all there's a lot of people
that resent pretty girls cause they

2475
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:56,790
feel like girls have a fucking free ride.

2476
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:01,170
And especially if you're a chick that
maybe is unattractive and you're also

2477
01:12:01,171 --> 01:12:04,650
someone who loves animals and you see
some pretty girl with a fucking dead

2478
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:05,200
zebra.

2479
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,800
Oh you fucking cunt.

2480
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:11,320
Like she was a con already
just because she's privileged.

2481
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:15,420
She's got great bone structure and a big
juicy ass and everybody wants a common

2482
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:16,254
side of her.

2483
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:17,183
Fuck her.

2484
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:17,671
Right.

2485
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:18,690
And so there's that.

2486
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:19,291
There's that.

2487
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:19,981
But you have,

2488
01:12:19,981 --> 01:12:22,980
now you have a license cause she's
standing over a fucking leopard.

2489
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:26,370
She shot with a bow and Arrow
and like this fucking bitch.

2490
01:12:26,371 --> 01:12:28,410
I hope that animal eats you alive.

2491
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:29,940
I hope they make you suffer.

2492
01:12:29,941 --> 01:12:30,774
Yes.

2493
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,640
That is it.

2494
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:33,121
Because the,

2495
01:12:33,121 --> 01:12:35,010
she couldn't just call
her out for being pretty.

2496
01:12:35,011 --> 01:12:36,600
She'd look petty and exactly.

2497
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:40,590
And the marital and men who know that
that girl would never fuck them in a

2498
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:40,600
million years.

2499
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,640
Dane get angry too.

2500
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:42,300
Right.

2501
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:46,260
And then there's also the men that want
to go way overboard to show everybody

2502
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:48,300
that they really support animal rights.

2503
01:12:48,301 --> 01:12:48,880
And you know,

2504
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,340
people eat animals are assholes and
people shoot zebras or pull shit.

2505
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:54,343
Yeah,

2506
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,331
it's a fad.

2507
01:12:55,331 --> 01:13:00,090
It's a fascinating thing because you look
at all the restaurants everywhere you

2508
01:13:00,091 --> 01:13:00,241
go,

2509
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:01,590
you can get out of this office right now.

2510
01:13:01,591 --> 01:13:05,340
We could drive down the street and every
fucking place on the left and the right

2511
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:10,341
and the left and the right is failed with
the carcasses of animals that died in

2512
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:16,791
ways far more horrible than any fucking
zebra suffers when you double lung them

2513
01:13:18,181 --> 01:13:18,820
when the narrow,

2514
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:19,171
right,

2515
01:13:19,171 --> 01:13:19,411
right.

2516
01:13:19,411 --> 01:13:24,411
Oh these animals live their lives in
pens and cages bred specifically for

2517
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:26,034
consumption.

2518
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:27,930
Killed in horrible ways.

2519
01:13:27,931 --> 01:13:31,740
Fed other dead animals when they're
not even supposed to be eating animals,

2520
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:35,670
but just so they can get more protein in
tune to make them fatter and stupider.

2521
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,370
I mean were were horrible.

2522
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,690
It really is great when you
take the byproducts that
cannot be used for anything

2523
01:13:42,691 --> 01:13:43,370
else.

2524
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:46,170
Grind it up and feed it back to that.

2525
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:49,500
That's what they did with mad cow.

2526
01:13:49,501 --> 01:13:52,110
They fucking were feeding him
brain matter and that they got,

2527
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:55,230
they got diseases that
cannibals in New Guinea got.

2528
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:56,580
That's Scifi Shit.

2529
01:13:56,581 --> 01:13:56,761
Right?

2530
01:13:56,761 --> 01:13:57,150
It is.

2531
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:58,460
That's fucking dark.

2532
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:00,480
That's soylent green stuff.

2533
01:14:00,481 --> 01:14:01,140
Right.

2534
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,150
So fucking eat it.

2535
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,320
I mean back to them they use it.

2536
01:14:04,321 --> 01:14:05,190
They've already used it.

2537
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:08,550
They've always used different dog food
and animal food and things like that.

2538
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:12,220
Which I don't necessarily think it's
that awful cause dogs thrown is the lead.

2539
01:14:12,221 --> 01:14:13,540
Anything in each shit.

2540
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,630
They look into this balls
and then he's not picky.

2541
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,160
I mean does it have protein in it?

2542
01:14:18,161 --> 01:14:18,371
Yeah,

2543
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:19,181
it was probably good.

2544
01:14:19,181 --> 01:14:19,600
Yeah.

2545
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,171
I don't understand.

2546
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:21,004
Yeah.

2547
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:26,500
But the hunting thing in Africa is
even more exacerbated by the reality of

2548
01:14:26,501 --> 01:14:27,340
conservation,

2549
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,120
that these animals were on the verge
of extinction and now they're valuable.

2550
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:32,710
So because they're valuable,

2551
01:14:32,711 --> 01:14:36,040
there's far more of these animals
than they've ever been before.

2552
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:37,930
Like ever in recorded history in Africa,

2553
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:38,740
like they have,

2554
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,970
they have areas of high fence hunting
operations that have these once endangered

2555
01:14:42,971 --> 01:14:45,220
animals and they're just
fucking roaming free,

2556
01:14:45,221 --> 01:14:46,360
wild everywhere.

2557
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:50,020
And these hunters fly in and they
go to these spots and they kill him.

2558
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:51,550
So it's so fucked up.

2559
01:14:51,551 --> 01:14:52,750
It's like on one side,

2560
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,400
like you know Louis Theroux,

2561
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:56,650
the documentary in from England.

2562
01:14:56,670 --> 01:14:57,760
You ever seen these documentaries?

2563
01:14:58,210 --> 01:14:59,100
Fascinating guy.

2564
01:14:59,150 --> 01:14:59,471
Really,

2565
01:14:59,471 --> 01:15:00,310
really cool guy.

2566
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:03,670
And I had him on the podcast before
and we talk specifically about these

2567
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:06,430
operations cause he went over there and
he was staying with them for three weeks

2568
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:11,730
and he was saying that these people
have these hunting branches and without

2569
01:15:12,191 --> 01:15:13,120
these hunting ranches,

2570
01:15:13,121 --> 01:15:14,800
these animals would probably be extinct.

2571
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:19,180
But because they're valuable
and people fly in and hunt them,

2572
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,020
they're worth money.

2573
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:23,710
So he's talking to the guy and he's trying
to figure it out and the guy goes in

2574
01:15:23,711 --> 01:15:25,240
this fucking crazy rant.

2575
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:26,171
That guy goes,

2576
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:27,970
so you keep asking me the same question.

2577
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:31,390
I'm going to tell you what's
up Africa East fucked.

2578
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:32,980
You're not going to stand it.

2579
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:35,860
Efficacy is worth money or it's nothing.

2580
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,760
These animals that west
something so then that alive,

2581
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:41,140
if they went out alive,

2582
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:42,490
if they went with anything,

2583
01:15:42,491 --> 01:15:43,600
they wouldn't be alive.

2584
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:44,260
Africa,

2585
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,000
east fucked and he just was,

2586
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,980
he was in that South African accent.

2587
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:48,823
Wow,

2588
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,260
that guy is fucked.

2589
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,820
And he's this old guy that's been living
in Africa his whole life and he's just

2590
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:54,310
talking about,

2591
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:56,170
I would just grinds everything.

2592
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:58,030
Like if it's not valuable,

2593
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,440
it's not going to stay alive.

2594
01:15:59,460 --> 01:15:59,770
Yeah.

2595
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:04,330
Only reason why these animals even exist
still is because people can come over

2596
01:16:04,331 --> 01:16:04,870
and hunt them like,

2597
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:06,040
and how ironic,

2598
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,120
right isn't that?

2599
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:10,960
And they pay a lot of money and we go
over there and hunt these animals and then

2600
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:12,063
the money,

2601
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:13,420
from what I've heard,

2602
01:16:13,421 --> 01:16:15,100
I don't know how accurate it is,

2603
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:15,541
is it?

2604
01:16:15,541 --> 01:16:17,500
It's supposed to go to some conservation.

2605
01:16:17,501 --> 01:16:18,250
A lot of it does.

2606
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:18,980
A lot of it does.

2607
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:23,290
Well I would be suspect to anything that
goes over to Africa and that's supposed

2608
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:28,030
to go somewhere when you look at starving
nations and just plane loads of food

2609
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:31,000
or going over there and
there's still justice starving.

2610
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:31,360
Yeah.

2611
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,820
Someone's getting rich off of that and uh,

2612
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:34,361
yeah,

2613
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:34,951
it's not the,

2614
01:16:34,951 --> 01:16:35,251
the,

2615
01:16:35,251 --> 01:16:36,084
the people,

2616
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:41,370
well there's the numbers of people
that are in poverty are so high.

2617
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:43,420
It's almost like you're insane.

2618
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:44,350
What am I going to do with this?

2619
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:48,670
Like we showed an image the other day
on the podcast of what Africa looks like

2620
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:49,630
size wise,

2621
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,010
that you can fit pretty much every other
country in the world inside of Africa.

2622
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:56,460
Like it's a fucking enormous place.

2623
01:16:56,461 --> 01:16:59,340
Just the Congo itself
is as wide as American.

2624
01:16:59,350 --> 01:16:59,860
Yeah.

2625
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:01,380
Like dis imagine tree.

2626
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,340
Imagine the Congo,

2627
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:06,820
a fucking giant rain
forest filled with wild,

2628
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:10,970
crazy monkeys and some of them
that they were mythological

2629
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:11,870
until recently.

2630
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:13,640
Do you remember where we were on the show?

2631
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:14,690
We were on opie and Anthony,

2632
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,130
a lady called up.

2633
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,260
We were talking about the Bondo aid,

2634
01:17:18,261 --> 01:17:22,340
which has since been proven by DNA
and photograph and video evidence.

2635
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:25,790
But I was talking about it based on a
national geographic article and some woman

2636
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:27,530
who was a biologist,

2637
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:29,240
we called up and said it was bullshit.

2638
01:17:29,241 --> 01:17:30,800
And you guys don't know
what you're talking about.

2639
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:32,043
You know,

2640
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:32,931
getting angry at her.

2641
01:17:32,931 --> 01:17:33,171
I'm like,

2642
01:17:33,171 --> 01:17:34,190
I'm not making this up,

2643
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,020
bitch.

2644
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:35,990
This is the Congo.

2645
01:17:35,991 --> 01:17:37,490
The Congo is a crazy place.

2646
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:38,451
Imagine that though.

2647
01:17:38,451 --> 01:17:38,631
Yeah.

2648
01:17:38,631 --> 01:17:39,221
Well I like I,

2649
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:42,950
I just flew over the entire country and
you'll look down and you see America and

2650
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:43,580
your,

2651
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:48,380
imagine all of that being
a jungle full of wildlife.

2652
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,960
You don't know everything that's in there.

2653
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:55,460
And there are pockets of places where
there are little communities of one

2654
01:17:55,461 --> 01:17:55,821
animal,

2655
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:57,080
certain things they're,

2656
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:57,530
they're,

2657
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:58,130
uh,

2658
01:17:58,130 --> 01:17:59,990
diet dictates where they are,

2659
01:17:59,991 --> 01:18:00,950
their surroundings,

2660
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:02,720
whether they migrate or not.

2661
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:07,400
You're not gonna be able to keep tabs
on every fucking living thing in one

2662
01:18:07,401 --> 01:18:08,990
country on the continent.

2663
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:11,990
That is that big and that covered.

2664
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,610
It's just astounding that people are
surprised when new things get found.

2665
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:18,650
That that was a big one though.

2666
01:18:18,651 --> 01:18:21,530
A new primate in a big six foot tall,

2667
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:25,190
super aggressive chimpanzee
that occasionally walks upright,

2668
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,260
can wait as much as 400 pounds.

2669
01:18:27,261 --> 01:18:29,390
And they call them lion killers.

2670
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:30,350
Oh Man.

2671
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:31,670
They say there's two types of chimps,

2672
01:18:31,671 --> 01:18:35,360
tree beaters and lion killers and the
tree beaters are the smaller ones that go

2673
01:18:35,361 --> 01:18:36,830
up into the top of the trees and run it.

2674
01:18:36,831 --> 01:18:39,460
But the lion killers bed on
the ground like gorillas.

2675
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:40,480
What was she like?

2676
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,630
Planet of the apes type girl.

2677
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,830
We just jumped on the plane
with a fucking giant gun.

2678
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:46,550
The last one was not doing
the last one was pretty good.

2679
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:49,400
I can let my anger in their
anger in those monkeys.

2680
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:50,263
Oh yeah.

2681
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:51,050
Um,

2682
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:52,190
but this,

2683
01:18:52,191 --> 01:18:52,401
uh,

2684
01:18:52,401 --> 01:18:57,290
this area of the Congo was also were like
fucking all the cold trend comes from

2685
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:57,640
when they're,

2686
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,230
they're making cell phones out of stuff.

2687
01:18:59,231 --> 01:19:02,870
There's so much minerals and shit
that they extract from these areas.

2688
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:03,650
Yeah.

2689
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:04,483
It's,

2690
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:08,480
it's a very wealthy nation
as far as resources go.

2691
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:11,180
And it's the poorest not nation continent.

2692
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:11,900
Um,

2693
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,700
and it's the poorest continent,

2694
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,640
sub Saharan Africa on
the face of the earth.

2695
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:18,590
It's astounding to me.

2696
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:19,090
And,

2697
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:23,810
and I know it always gets
blamed on imperialism and,

2698
01:19:23,811 --> 01:19:24,450
uh,

2699
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:24,980
uh,

2700
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:25,311
you know,

2701
01:19:25,311 --> 01:19:28,910
every other country has come in and raped
and ravaged Africa and then left with

2702
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:30,170
the wealth and riches and blah,

2703
01:19:30,171 --> 01:19:30,351
blah,

2704
01:19:30,351 --> 01:19:30,710
blah.

2705
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:31,900
But I mean,

2706
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:32,211
it hasn't,

2707
01:19:32,211 --> 01:19:36,920
that happened with every country and
continent on the face of this earth pretty

2708
01:19:36,921 --> 01:19:38,690
much during some point in history.

2709
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:39,141
Well,

2710
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:44,090
unless someone comes along and revamps
their infrastructure and creates some

2711
01:19:44,091 --> 01:19:48,590
sort of a central government that's
democratically elected and gets rid of the

2712
01:19:48,591 --> 01:19:51,290
majority of their
corruption and their debt,

2713
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:56,530
the civilization there is so old and
the corruption and the violence is so

2714
01:19:57,681 --> 01:20:02,480
embedded in their system to
break the momentum of the Congo,

2715
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,440
that fucking,

2716
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:07,160
that fucking Kony 2012 guys remember?

2717
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:08,670
That's it.

2718
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:09,350
Where'd that go?

2719
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:09,781
That well,

2720
01:20:09,781 --> 01:20:11,220
when the fucking guy that was heading,

2721
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:13,950
it started beating off
naked on the street corner.

2722
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:16,710
That hashtag went into the old dust bin.

2723
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,570
That was so quick.

2724
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,130
That was a fast one.

2725
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:21,130
People cared.

2726
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:23,100
They didn't care like that.

2727
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:24,850
That is the Hashtag though.

2728
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:27,480
Like people care then they don't care.

2729
01:20:27,481 --> 01:20:27,670
Yeah.

2730
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:29,250
That was the biggest one.

2731
01:20:29,251 --> 01:20:30,160
It was huge peep.

2732
01:20:30,161 --> 01:20:31,570
Celebrities get involved.

2733
01:20:31,571 --> 01:20:32,730
And there was a kit,

2734
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:37,380
like there was a kit that you could
send for that on one day in April,

2735
01:20:37,381 --> 01:20:38,910
I think of that year.

2736
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:39,720
Uh,

2737
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:44,100
people were supposed to wake up and just
see Koni signs everywhere and you could

2738
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:47,640
send for these big kits where
the had Coney stickers and stuff.

2739
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,370
And one day people were supposed to get
out of bed and go to work and be like,

2740
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:51,420
what's happening?

2741
01:20:51,421 --> 01:20:52,350
Coney everywhere.

2742
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,310
And then the guy just started jerking
off naked on a corner in San Diego where

2743
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:00,150
they don't play no play in San Diego.

2744
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:01,000
You can't do that.

2745
01:21:01,001 --> 01:21:02,220
It's fucking conservative.

2746
01:21:02,221 --> 01:21:03,870
They're close to military bases,

2747
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:06,600
changes be jacking off with
a bunch of old rich people.

2748
01:21:06,601 --> 01:21:07,970
Donald Rumsfeld's neighborhood.

2749
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:08,251
Yeah,

2750
01:21:08,251 --> 01:21:08,540
yeah.

2751
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:08,970
The,

2752
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:11,130
all the slacktivist at
that point we're just like,

2753
01:21:11,131 --> 01:21:13,230
we need a new hashtag no hashtag.

2754
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:18,840
The point is like these warlords that
essentially control large parts of the

2755
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:19,321
Congo,

2756
01:21:19,321 --> 01:21:23,490
it's like to get them out and to revamp
the system and deal with the fact that

2757
01:21:23,491 --> 01:21:25,320
there's a jungle and there's no roads,

2758
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:26,220
no roads,

2759
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:26,670
uh,

2760
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:28,530
very fuzzy borders.

2761
01:21:28,531 --> 01:21:33,120
Like all of these borders are constantly
moving based on which warlord is

2762
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:35,840
warring with the other one and how
much land they take and killing,

2763
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:37,230
taking resources.

2764
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:42,630
Yet there needs to be some kind of
legitimate infrastructure put in place.

2765
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:43,464
But yeah,

2766
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:45,630
how's that ever going
to happen doing that.

2767
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,030
But that's another thing
we think about it like,

2768
01:21:48,031 --> 01:21:48,781
oh boy,

2769
01:21:48,781 --> 01:21:50,880
it's never happened in
the time we've been alive.

2770
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,410
So it won't happen.

2771
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:52,980
This shit takes thousands of years.

2772
01:21:52,981 --> 01:21:53,340
Does.

2773
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:53,640
Yeah.

2774
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,450
Yeah.

2775
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:55,283
Yeah.

2776
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:56,080
Well you look at,

2777
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:56,913
uh,

2778
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:58,551
some of the,

2779
01:21:58,551 --> 01:21:59,384
uh,

2780
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,010
Middle East with all their oil.

2781
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:02,731
I mean,

2782
01:22:02,731 --> 01:22:04,950
they were walking around
on that shit for years,

2783
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:05,813
not knowing it.

2784
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:09,930
It was pretty much more civilized,

2785
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,240
technically advanced cultures that said,

2786
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:13,200
hey,

2787
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,800
let's build these things and start
pumping fucking oil out of the ground made

2788
01:22:16,801 --> 01:22:17,634
them rich.

2789
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:21,930
But that's the infrastructure
that was put in place by the West.

2790
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:22,770
Uh,

2791
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:25,320
and kind of made them who they are now.

2792
01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:29,100
And why can't it happen in
Africa with all those resources?

2793
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,850
Because the second someone swoops in
from the West and decides that they're

2794
01:22:32,851 --> 01:22:34,170
going to start building things,

2795
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,660
it's instantly seen as taking advantage.

2796
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:38,370
And raping the land.

2797
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:39,571
But meanwhile,

2798
01:22:39,571 --> 01:22:42,090
jobs are created when you rape the land.

2799
01:22:42,091 --> 01:22:42,960
Sorry to say,

2800
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:47,370
but it does happen and I think that's
better than just having a population that

2801
01:22:47,371 --> 01:22:50,310
doesn't even know how to take
the shit out of the ground.

2802
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:55,520
And his is what literally walking on
gold and starving and dying of disease.

2803
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:57,370
Literally walking on goal.

2804
01:22:58,530 --> 01:23:00,750
But there's no roads
and there's also this,

2805
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:02,040
there's this problem,

2806
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:03,540
this fucking trees everywhere.

2807
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:06,040
Like you cut them down

2808
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,870
or else you're even when
it will go terribly.

2809
01:23:07,871 --> 01:23:10,090
Oh you bad person,

2810
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:11,140
you non green.

2811
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:13,780
But if you're in Dubai,

2812
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:14,890
you get to everything.

2813
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,960
Slap down a road and you're good to go.

2814
01:23:16,961 --> 01:23:17,760
Start chilling.

2815
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,071
All right,

2816
01:23:18,071 --> 01:23:18,671
we got cash.

2817
01:23:18,671 --> 01:23:19,480
What do you want to do?

2818
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,090
Let's build the biggest
fucking building ever.

2819
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:22,023
Let's do it.

2820
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:22,811
Go ahead.

2821
01:23:22,811 --> 01:23:24,220
You got 12 Leeann's twice.

2822
01:23:24,221 --> 01:23:26,100
Aliens and swellings and Dallas.

2823
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:27,190
Maybe mine.

2824
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:32,110
Maybe we should then just look at it for
what it is and not try to incorporate

2825
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,330
that into the world.

2826
01:23:34,331 --> 01:23:34,700
We,

2827
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:37,030
we know and we're familiar with,

2828
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:37,810
uh,

2829
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:41,260
and and just accept that for what it is
they are going to be people that live in

2830
01:23:41,261 --> 01:23:45,490
these places that cannot be industrialized
and they are going to have to suffer

2831
01:23:45,491 --> 01:23:47,440
the consequences of living there.

2832
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:51,970
I don't know what else there is unless
you want us to deforest build some roads,

2833
01:23:51,971 --> 01:23:55,150
get some big cat fucking
bulldoze in there.

2834
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:57,130
What's the answer there?

2835
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,450
This is not a lot of answers.

2836
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:01,210
Everywhere you go that
has a big jungles fucked.

2837
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,373
Yes.

2838
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,420
Once you get into the jungle,

2839
01:24:04,421 --> 01:24:07,420
like what is this fucking people
with the leaves over their dicks.

2840
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:08,650
When are we going to do here?

2841
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,950
When you're fucking around
as a kid in the woods,

2842
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:13,660
you have been in certain
situations we were like,

2843
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:13,841
oh,

2844
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:14,740
I'm in the stickers.

2845
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:16,450
I went off of the path.

2846
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:17,523
Oh I'm this.

2847
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:19,210
That's nothing.

2848
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:24,690
Like imagine that the size of the United
States and a thousand times worse now

2849
01:24:26,201 --> 01:24:30,100
do something in there
now live and no shit man.

2850
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,113
That's crazy.

2851
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:31,660
That is,

2852
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:35,410
that is fucking terrifying to be living
in the jungle to then you got to think

2853
01:24:35,411 --> 01:24:36,400
about the bugs,

2854
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:41,410
all the fucking light when you put a
little off on you and the backyard because

2855
01:24:41,411 --> 01:24:42,670
the mosquito I got bit.

2856
01:24:42,671 --> 01:24:43,150
Did you see this?

2857
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:43,983
I got bit.

2858
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:45,243
That's just

2859
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,140
fucking like those be
beards of mosquitoes.

2860
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,660
Well have you ever been
in Alaska in the summer?

2861
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,680
No I haven't.

2862
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:54,940
Alaska is incredible.

2863
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,860
You go outside like I'm not,

2864
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,030
I'm not exaggerating at all.

2865
01:24:58,031 --> 01:24:59,380
You get out of your car,

2866
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:04,120
you step out of your car and then a
swarm of mosquitoes will engulf you.

2867
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:09,410
Ari and I went fishing last year and
what we had to do is we pulled up to the

2868
01:25:09,411 --> 01:25:10,450
spot and there was,

2869
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,220
the boat was over there so we go,

2870
01:25:12,221 --> 01:25:12,521
all right,

2871
01:25:12,521 --> 01:25:12,970
you ready?

2872
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:13,900
I got the keys,

2873
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:14,680
you've got everything,

2874
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:15,640
got everything in your hands.

2875
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,533
Ready,

2876
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:17,170
go.

2877
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:18,250
And we would open doors,

2878
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:18,970
slam it,

2879
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:20,680
lock it and just start running.

2880
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:24,760
And you had to just run to where we were
running to the bow of the boat because

2881
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:25,960
if when she parked the car,

2882
01:25:25,961 --> 01:25:26,980
if you stand put,

2883
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,120
if you just stay there and
just get swarmed and then
they follow you everywhere

2884
01:25:31,121 --> 01:25:32,130
and they just staying in the,

2885
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,750
so once you get on the
boat and like pull out,

2886
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:35,481
they don't fuck with,

2887
01:25:35,481 --> 01:25:39,430
you can't find you once you ran
[inaudible] going down river.

2888
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:39,701
Yeah.

2889
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:41,620
If you stay put for a
while they'll find you.

2890
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:44,080
But the idea is that they breathe,

2891
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:46,940
they detect your carbon dioxide so right.

2892
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:48,280
They're coming to your mouth.

2893
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,830
It's the first thing that come to and
then they find that you're in the air and

2894
01:25:50,831 --> 01:25:52,390
they just start stinging
in the shit out of you.

2895
01:25:52,391 --> 01:25:57,391
I'm talking like thousands of mosquitoes
instantaneously arrive because there's

2896
01:25:58,901 --> 01:26:01,030
no like they have no time.

2897
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:01,830
They're,

2898
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:04,040
they're only alive for
like a couple of months.

2899
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,210
They're in high gear.

2900
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:05,460
Yeah.

2901
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:06,470
Everything they do,

2902
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,000
June rolls around man,

2903
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:09,260
they fucking roll out.

2904
01:26:09,261 --> 01:26:11,470
They hatch and they
just start going there.

2905
01:26:11,471 --> 01:26:13,190
Only live til like the end of August.

2906
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:14,500
August is over.

2907
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:15,860
It starts getting cold as shit.

2908
01:26:15,861 --> 01:26:16,694
And it's over again.

2909
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:17,743
Wow.

2910
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:18,590
Yeah.

2911
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:19,341
I uh,

2912
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:23,060
you see animals sometimes just sitting
there covered in bugs and they don't seem

2913
01:26:23,061 --> 01:26:23,560
to mind.

2914
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,141
I don't give a fuck.

2915
01:26:24,141 --> 01:26:25,190
Just amazing to me.

2916
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:25,620
Well,

2917
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:30,000
I know I am knowing that
tale may be it's awesome.

2918
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:31,190
Swap away.

2919
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:34,760
They could swat away flies within a
fucking two foot radius of their asshole.

2920
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,170
That's pretty much it.

2921
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:38,280
If it's on your fucking eyeball,

2922
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,593
your fuck.

2923
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,131
Thanks.

2924
01:26:40,131 --> 01:26:40,870
Have evolution.

2925
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:41,390
Yeah.

2926
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:42,223
Thank you.

2927
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:44,090
Fucking tail.

2928
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,190
Just fail a lot.

2929
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,033
Back and forth.

2930
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:48,620
Barely does a half assed job.

2931
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,580
No Pun intended.

2932
01:26:49,581 --> 01:26:52,190
At least they put it where they know
most of the flies are going to be going.

2933
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:53,900
Cause that kind of makes sense.

2934
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:57,890
Put it by his ass of make have tail.

2935
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:01,760
That's why a lot of animals have tails
that swat the flies away from their

2936
01:27:01,761 --> 01:27:03,310
shitty stinky ass

2937
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:10,020
can purposes tail serve an
account unless it's the Swat.

2938
01:27:10,021 --> 01:27:11,120
The fucking flies away.

2939
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:11,451
Yeah.

2940
01:27:11,451 --> 01:27:12,710
I mean it's not balancing it.

2941
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,450
They don't care either fucking cows.

2942
01:27:14,451 --> 01:27:14,931
You ever see that?

2943
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:19,931
They got like some Bush shit all over
their whole ants can green cow shit

2944
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:22,780
handled for fucking level.

2945
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:24,463
Good luck.

2946
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,150
There's another way to look at it.

2947
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:27,043
Good luck.

2948
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:27,471
Good luck.

2949
01:27:27,471 --> 01:27:28,310
Fucking a cow.

2950
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,510
Has it been a guy ever?

2951
01:27:29,511 --> 01:27:30,830
That's fuck to cow for sure.

2952
01:27:30,831 --> 01:27:31,160
Right?

2953
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,060
I am sure.

2954
01:27:32,061 --> 01:27:35,480
Every animal on the face of this
earth has been fucked by somebody.

2955
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:39,440
You imagine that people would get
animals pregnant if people were almost

2956
01:27:39,441 --> 01:27:39,980
pregnant,

2957
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:41,900
the world would look so strange.

2958
01:27:41,901 --> 01:27:43,400
There'd be half human,

2959
01:27:43,401 --> 01:27:44,300
half horse,

2960
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:45,470
half monkey,

2961
01:27:45,471 --> 01:27:46,630
half,

2962
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:47,463
half cats.

2963
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:48,081
We go,

2964
01:27:48,081 --> 01:27:48,914
we go,

2965
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:50,631
we go nuts.

2966
01:27:50,631 --> 01:27:52,070
Sometimes when we see,

2967
01:27:52,071 --> 01:27:52,281
you know,

2968
01:27:52,281 --> 01:27:53,840
mixing of the races,

2969
01:27:53,841 --> 01:27:54,920
people go crazy.

2970
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:55,820
Oh,

2971
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:57,890
imagine a fucking half horse person.

2972
01:27:58,450 --> 01:27:59,630
It's kind of walking around.

2973
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:00,560
Yeah.

2974
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,060
Nature figured that shit out.

2975
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,740
It doesn't work out mathematically.

2976
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:04,821
This,

2977
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:05,330
uh,

2978
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:06,440
does not compute.

2979
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:07,281
And if it does,

2980
01:28:07,281 --> 01:28:10,370
even if they're close enough to
breed the whatever they breed,

2981
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,201
whatever they fuck,

2982
01:28:11,201 --> 01:28:13,070
and they have a kid becomes sterile.

2983
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:14,120
Yeah.

2984
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:14,421
Yeah.

2985
01:28:14,421 --> 01:28:15,080
Like a what?

2986
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:16,290
Donkeys and mules.

2987
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:16,980
Yeah.

2988
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:19,550
A mule or donkey and a
horse or the laggers.

2989
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:21,200
Laggers are sterile.

2990
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:22,850
Kathline half tiger.

2991
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:23,420
It's,

2992
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:26,600
it does seem like there was
some type of plan put in place.

2993
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,370
They're a little bit do that.

2994
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:29,540
You could do that,

2995
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:31,280
but we're not going to
let it go any further.

2996
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:34,260
That's why we won't even
let get to that point.

2997
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:36,590
Cause somebody fucked a
chimp and it made a bit.

2998
01:28:36,591 --> 01:28:40,850
What if you could make like babies but
the baby's couldn't breed some half

2999
01:28:40,851 --> 01:28:41,450
person.

3000
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:42,660
Half chairperson.

3001
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:46,520
I mean how much different is
that than a cow or Alaina tiger.

3002
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:47,570
Fucking Elian.

3003
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:48,703
Yeah.

3004
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:52,580
I mean that's the idea behind
people breeding with neanderthals.

3005
01:28:52,581 --> 01:28:53,180
Right?

3006
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:53,541
Right.

3007
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:53,811
Yeah.

3008
01:28:53,811 --> 01:28:54,410
Yeah.

3009
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:59,300
They fucked and they made a some sort
of a half hybrid human neanderthal thing

3010
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:02,010
that just kind of petered down

3011
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:02,940
the line somewhere.

3012
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:03,893
Yeah,

3013
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:05,610
they were too thick.

3014
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:06,720
Yeah.

3015
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,010
You got another note over there.

3016
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:08,953
I don't know what that is.

3017
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,350
Vice Colombian donkey.

3018
01:29:10,351 --> 01:29:10,861
Oh yeah,

3019
01:29:10,861 --> 01:29:11,440
yeah.

3020
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,590
My show on the Colombian,

3021
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:13,650
a donkey fucker.

3022
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,000
Those poor bastards.

3023
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,400
He seemed to be enjoying it.

3024
01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:19,590
I saw the clip and he just,

3025
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,770
he was a little embarrassed is
literally a little embarrassed,

3026
01:29:22,771 --> 01:29:23,370
but barely,

3027
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:23,780
yes,

3028
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,320
the donkeys and convenient size.

3029
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:27,030
I want to know if someone
fucked the Giraffe,

3030
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:31,590
that gotta be a dude who got figured out
a way to get a draft to come near the

3031
01:29:31,591 --> 01:29:32,424
tree.

3032
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:33,300
And you just,

3033
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:35,910
I think if you're around
where there are giraffes,

3034
01:29:35,911 --> 01:29:37,890
there's so many other fuckable animals.

3035
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:38,170
Yeah.

3036
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:40,470
But there's gotta be a
guy who like had goals.

3037
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:42,660
There's dudes who climbed Everest.

3038
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:45,030
This people ran a sub four minute mile.

3039
01:29:45,230 --> 01:29:47,190
You gotta be a guy fucked everything else.

3040
01:29:47,191 --> 01:29:48,090
Like God dammit,

3041
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:49,570
I'm going to fuck a giraffe.

3042
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,780
I want to fuck a live giraffe
because it's not fair.

3043
01:29:54,781 --> 01:29:56,670
If you shoot a giraffe and then fuck it,

3044
01:29:56,671 --> 01:29:57,001
fuck it.

3045
01:29:57,001 --> 01:29:57,900
While it's still warm,

3046
01:29:57,901 --> 01:29:58,734
unethical,

3047
01:29:58,740 --> 01:29:59,490
it's rude.

3048
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:00,161
And most of,

3049
01:30:00,161 --> 01:30:00,680
uh,

3050
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:01,000
if,

3051
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,310
if the animal is a little taller,

3052
01:30:02,311 --> 01:30:03,900
I heard about animals being stumped,

3053
01:30:03,901 --> 01:30:05,150
broke where you,

3054
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:05,420
you,

3055
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:05,650
you,

3056
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:10,650
you train them and break them to backup
to a stump so you can stand on the stump

3057
01:30:10,861 --> 01:30:11,694
and fuck them.

3058
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:15,620
So the animal stumped broken
nose like meant to the stump.

3059
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:16,550
What?

3060
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:16,941
Yeah.

3061
01:30:16,941 --> 01:30:17,520
Yeah.

3062
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,960
What kind of animal gets stumped?

3063
01:30:18,961 --> 01:30:20,130
Broke horse.

3064
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:21,473
Of course.

3065
01:30:21,710 --> 01:30:22,860
If you're going to fuck a horse.

3066
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:24,391
I remember,

3067
01:30:24,391 --> 01:30:24,850
uh,

3068
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:25,110
I,

3069
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:26,370
cause I used to live out here,

3070
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,360
I actually used to live,

3071
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:31,080
here's the horse fucking here
is the horse fucking capital.

3072
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:31,711
It is.

3073
01:30:31,711 --> 01:30:35,990
I lived out in San Juan Capistrano and
I had horses and everything like that.

3074
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,950
It was always the joke about who,

3075
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:38,191
you know,

3076
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:41,820
stumped broke their horse cause it
didn't apply that you were fucking,

3077
01:30:41,821 --> 01:30:43,370
your horse was stumped.

3078
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,213
Broke.

3079
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:44,970
Yeah.

3080
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:47,250
And then there's that
other thing where you'd um,

3081
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,760
I guess a boot broke was the,

3082
01:30:49,761 --> 01:30:50,041
the,

3083
01:30:50,041 --> 01:30:51,930
you have your boots and you shoved the,

3084
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,390
the goat or the sheep's back legs in the,

3085
01:30:54,610 --> 01:30:56,730
in your boots and they
couldn't go anywhere.

3086
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,840
And then another one you was supposed
to go to the edge of an embankment or a

3087
01:31:00,841 --> 01:31:05,841
cliff and push at the sheep and it would
back up cause it would be afraid of

3088
01:31:06,571 --> 01:31:09,120
falling off the cliff and it
would back right into your Dick.

3089
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:09,780
Yeah.

3090
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:10,800
And you get a little action.

3091
01:31:10,850 --> 01:31:11,880
I haven't heard of that before.

3092
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,700
How insane.

3093
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,280
People get a lot of desperate.

3094
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:18,570
They get desperate.

3095
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:21,390
I've been without pussy grown up,

3096
01:31:21,391 --> 01:31:25,380
especially when it was really hard back
in the old days to get fucking laid.

3097
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:26,613
Uh,

3098
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:27,430
and,

3099
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:28,290
and you're desperate,

3100
01:31:28,291 --> 01:31:32,550
but you never look around at
an alternative live source,

3101
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:35,010
but you fuck you fuck everything at York.

3102
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,360
You grew up in Long Island,

3103
01:31:36,361 --> 01:31:36,630
right?

3104
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:37,710
Well Long Island and yeah,

3105
01:31:37,711 --> 01:31:40,350
out here but but long island as a kid.

3106
01:31:40,351 --> 01:31:40,560
Yeah.

3107
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,300
These are places where people are,

3108
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:43,710
there's a lot of people.

3109
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:47,310
You're on a farm somewhere in the middle
of Bolivia and there's no one around.

3110
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:50,100
You just get on a top of the
farm house and you look around,

3111
01:31:50,101 --> 01:31:52,860
you don't see shit for as
far as the eye can see.

3112
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:56,190
And you look at one of these sheep and
you look at the sheet vagina and you go

3113
01:31:56,191 --> 01:31:56,890
out,

3114
01:31:56,890 --> 01:31:58,000
let me just stick my finger in there,

3115
01:31:58,030 --> 01:31:58,863
fill it.

3116
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:01,990
You really do put things in perspective.

3117
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:07,320
I'm thinking from my own privilege terms
at the way in about an urban scenario,

3118
01:32:07,811 --> 01:32:08,500
right?

3119
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,333
Where you know,

3120
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,860
these are desperate fucks
living in hard times.

3121
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:14,530
He knows he's not going
to even see a girl.

3122
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:16,653
Poor bastard.

3123
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,501
You can get a shit,

3124
01:32:17,501 --> 01:32:19,030
roll the dice and live in the Congo.

3125
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:22,120
You could just wake up one
day and your feet are dirty.

3126
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:24,190
That and your house is made out of twigs.

3127
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:25,900
That was always the um,

3128
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:31,050
the intense fear of the
thought that reincarnation
might be true and even though

3129
01:32:31,271 --> 01:32:35,270
no one really remembers who they were
in a previous life or who they are going

3130
01:32:35,271 --> 01:32:36,850
to be in the next or something,

3131
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:37,720
you always like,

3132
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,040
I don't want to man,

3133
01:32:39,041 --> 01:32:40,990
I got a good one this time around.

3134
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:43,450
I got so fucking lucky.

3135
01:32:43,451 --> 01:32:46,810
New York males wide scale job.

3136
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,550
This fucking is,

3137
01:32:48,551 --> 01:32:51,760
I aced this and then you get reincarnated.

3138
01:32:51,761 --> 01:32:52,600
You're like fucking,

3139
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:53,530
you got Ebola,

3140
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:56,140
you're coughing your blood
up in front of a fucking guy.

3141
01:32:56,141 --> 01:32:58,820
Fucking a goat or you're a monkey or,

3142
01:32:58,821 --> 01:32:59,321
and you know,

3143
01:32:59,321 --> 01:33:01,540
you used to be a person but
you can't talk and you're like,

3144
01:33:01,970 --> 01:33:02,803
ah,

3145
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:04,340
and that's all you're getting

3146
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:07,480
bummed out.

3147
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,280
That would be a bummer.

3148
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:09,971
Beaten off.

3149
01:33:09,971 --> 01:33:10,650
Bummed down.

3150
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:11,111
No one.

3151
01:33:11,111 --> 01:33:12,490
You only have to be 10.

3152
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:14,651
I was fucking,

3153
01:33:14,651 --> 01:33:15,670
I was in New York,

3154
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:16,280
I was,

3155
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,410
it was a white guy.

3156
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:20,440
It was a white guy who had this whole
thing where I was telling chicks,

3157
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:21,850
no girlfriends,

3158
01:33:21,851 --> 01:33:22,630
girlfriends.

3159
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:24,490
It was crazy and they still came over.

3160
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,230
It's crazy.

3161
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:30,010
How many of you would think come over
because they think I'm going to fix him.

3162
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:33,010
This guy with his no girl shit.

3163
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:33,873
I think so.

3164
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:36,160
I think there've been
a few that think like,

3165
01:33:36,161 --> 01:33:38,710
oh well he just hasn't
found the right girl.

3166
01:33:38,711 --> 01:33:39,280
And they had,

3167
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,560
they'll say they go with
it in the beginning,

3168
01:33:41,561 --> 01:33:43,420
but then they start
getting angry with you.

3169
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:43,901
Yeah.

3170
01:33:43,901 --> 01:33:44,290
As it,

3171
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:45,160
as they realize,

3172
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:47,260
oh this motherfucker serious sin.

3173
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:48,280
Oh wait a minute.

3174
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:49,770
He meant that bullshit.

3175
01:33:49,830 --> 01:33:52,990
You guys say the same but
they can't pull it off.

3176
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:55,320
No one really means that when they say it.

3177
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:55,570
Fuck.

3178
01:33:55,570 --> 01:33:57,850
Do you think you are that
you could pull this off.

3179
01:33:59,020 --> 01:33:59,830
They get that.

3180
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:00,950
Oh yeah.

3181
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:01,330
Fuck.

3182
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:02,260
Do you think you are?

3183
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:03,293
Do you think you are?

3184
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:04,301
Who?

3185
01:34:04,301 --> 01:34:04,661
The WHO.

3186
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:05,530
It's a fuck you.

3187
01:34:05,531 --> 01:34:06,610
You fucking idiot.

3188
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:07,481
Exactly.

3189
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:07,590
He,

3190
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:10,350
while they already fucked you rape.

3191
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:11,403
Wait a minute.

3192
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:12,633
I take away,

3193
01:34:12,650 --> 01:34:13,810
take away consent.

3194
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:15,030
Consent.

3195
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:16,750
Draw a troll.

3196
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:17,920
Women have spoken

3197
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,390
the fucking cliff with a horn.

3198
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:25,570
We've found another one.

3199
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,930
You haven't fun.

3200
01:34:28,931 --> 01:34:30,910
What do you live in your
life by your own rules?

3201
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,680
What's said it's fuck you if they don't.

3202
01:34:32,681 --> 01:34:33,520
People don't like that,

3203
01:34:33,521 --> 01:34:34,000
I guess.

3204
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,390
Do you think in retrospect that
this whole firing was a good thing?

3205
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:38,231
Yes.

3206
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:39,070
In retrospect,

3207
01:34:39,071 --> 01:34:42,100
at first I was freaked out.

3208
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,650
It was just before a 4th of July,

3209
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:49,810
4th of July weekend I had this big fucking
party and now I got to like entertain

3210
01:34:49,811 --> 01:34:51,970
people as I'm just bummed,

3211
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:53,560
just completely bummed.

3212
01:34:54,050 --> 01:34:54,431
And,

3213
01:34:54,431 --> 01:34:54,740
uh,

3214
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:54,870
and,

3215
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:55,070
and,

3216
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:58,040
and another thing when we talk
about how dumb people are and

3217
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:02,570
you realize how stupid a lot of the masses
are by reading their comments on the

3218
01:35:02,571 --> 01:35:03,230
Internet,

3219
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:07,040
I took a picture the next day after I got
fired because it was the big party of,

3220
01:35:07,041 --> 01:35:07,270
uh,

3221
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:08,090
my buddy Carlton,

3222
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:09,560
who's a black guy and a,

3223
01:35:09,561 --> 01:35:10,800
we were in the pool and stuff and I,

3224
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:11,631
I was,

3225
01:35:11,631 --> 01:35:12,430
I had my arm around him,

3226
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:13,910
I'm doing a thumbs up and I'm like,

3227
01:35:13,911 --> 01:35:14,181
Hey,

3228
01:35:14,181 --> 01:35:14,930
look,

3229
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:15,590
look,

3230
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:17,180
people thought I was seriously,

3231
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:17,810
they said,

3232
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:18,141
you know,

3233
01:35:18,141 --> 01:35:20,030
the fact that he posted a
picture with a black guy,

3234
01:35:20,031 --> 01:35:21,890
he tried to let us know like,

3235
01:35:21,891 --> 01:35:22,161
look,

3236
01:35:22,161 --> 01:35:23,210
I have a black friend.

3237
01:35:23,530 --> 01:35:23,811
I was like,

3238
01:35:23,811 --> 01:35:25,610
but that was the Gulf that I was,

3239
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,620
I was parodying that uh,

3240
01:35:27,810 --> 01:35:28,643
you,

3241
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,073
uh,

3242
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:30,871
it doesn't matter.

3243
01:35:30,871 --> 01:35:32,430
Even if they know you were doing that,

3244
01:35:32,431 --> 01:35:34,440
they still want to call you
on it because it gives them,

3245
01:35:34,710 --> 01:35:36,540
it gives them a license to be upset.

3246
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,170
Yes.

3247
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:39,030
People are always looking online,

3248
01:35:39,031 --> 01:35:42,330
especially for a moment where
they're allowed to be mad.

3249
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:43,320
Isn't that great?

3250
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:44,070
Yeah.

3251
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:47,640
They want to be mad because
life sucks for most people.

3252
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:47,851
Look,

3253
01:35:47,851 --> 01:35:49,020
it doesn't suck for Anthony.

3254
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:51,180
You got to fucking beautiful house.

3255
01:35:51,181 --> 01:35:52,170
You make money.

3256
01:35:52,171 --> 01:35:53,430
You got your own show now.

3257
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:54,780
But for most people,

3258
01:35:54,781 --> 01:35:57,450
they're trapped in a
job that's unfulfilling.

3259
01:35:57,451 --> 01:36:01,500
They have to listen to a boss or a
fucking company that's probably way more

3260
01:36:01,501 --> 01:36:03,600
restrictive than what
Sirius was given you.

3261
01:36:03,601 --> 01:36:04,530
Oh hell yeah.

3262
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:06,960
And there's no fucking hope in sight.

3263
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:10,110
So anytime they get a
chance to vent this anger,

3264
01:36:10,111 --> 01:36:11,160
this frustration,

3265
01:36:11,161 --> 01:36:13,920
this existential angst at the very life,

3266
01:36:13,921 --> 01:36:18,060
they're fucking trapped in with
a majority of your time all day,

3267
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:20,130
all week is doing shit you hate.

3268
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:21,990
That's the majority of your life.

3269
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:22,860
So it,

3270
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:26,220
fuck this guy thinks he's going
to trick us with his black friend.

3271
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:33,580
You did describe a great bad life.

3272
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,473
It's a lot of,

3273
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:36,160
it was mine until I was,

3274
01:36:36,190 --> 01:36:37,780
that popped up at 35 years old.

3275
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:39,430
It was terrible.

3276
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:44,700
And then like last night we were flying
here in a beautiful new fucking Airbus.

3277
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:46,640
Uh,

3278
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:47,473
it,

3279
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:52,770
the TV is as big as most people's
house TVs were a few years back.

3280
01:36:53,290 --> 01:36:57,940
And I'm watching the new planet of the
apes and I'm sitting in a fully reclined

3281
01:36:57,941 --> 01:37:02,170
seat hurdling through the cosmos
coming here to Los Angeles in,

3282
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:06,250
in time that could only
be dreamt about years ago.

3283
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:07,810
And uh,

3284
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,110
my,

3285
01:37:08,110 --> 01:37:09,610
my screen was fucking up a little bit.

3286
01:37:09,730 --> 01:37:13,720
It kept pausing the movie and then
setting it back a little ways and stuff.

3287
01:37:13,721 --> 01:37:17,020
And I had to keep sitting up pressing
it and scrolling back to where I was in

3288
01:37:17,021 --> 01:37:17,854
the movie.

3289
01:37:17,950 --> 01:37:22,950
And I started for a second to
get pissed ice for a second.

3290
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:28,150
And then it all started
jelling where I was,

3291
01:37:28,151 --> 01:37:29,500
what I was doing.

3292
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:34,770
And if I'm getting pissed because my
fucking first run movie at 35,000 feet on

3293
01:37:37,901 --> 01:37:42,730
my way to Joe Rogan's show in Los
Angeles isn't working properly,

3294
01:37:42,910 --> 01:37:43,331
not even,

3295
01:37:43,331 --> 01:37:44,070
not working,

3296
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:45,910
it's not working good enough for me.

3297
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:48,580
I should have thrown
myself out of the plane.

3298
01:37:48,581 --> 01:37:49,780
So I didn't allow myself,

3299
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:53,110
I actually chuckled at myself
for starting to get mad.

3300
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:54,670
You checked your white privilege.

3301
01:37:54,671 --> 01:37:56,400
I check my white privilege,

3302
01:37:56,401 --> 01:37:58,650
which I implore all of you to do.

3303
01:37:58,651 --> 01:38:00,060
Please check your privilege,

3304
01:38:00,061 --> 01:38:01,020
check your privilege.

3305
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:03,360
That's a big thing that they
say on college campuses today.

3306
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:04,223
Of course they do.

3307
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:06,970
Kids are being indoctrinated
by the hard left.

3308
01:38:06,971 --> 01:38:09,580
It's running these
colleges and the hard left.

3309
01:38:09,581 --> 01:38:10,000
Once you

3310
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,900
check your privilege,

3311
01:38:10,901 --> 01:38:12,010
check your privilege.

3312
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:17,350
I still don't know what it is and I've
said what I believe white privilege is

3313
01:38:17,351 --> 01:38:19,240
and I've gotten a lot of shit for it.

3314
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:20,921
What do you believe?

3315
01:38:20,921 --> 01:38:21,754
White privileges?

3316
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,870
I think white privilege is
something that isn't a privilege.

3317
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:29,290
It's been earned over
the course of many years.

3318
01:38:30,010 --> 01:38:31,450
I know it's,

3319
01:38:31,451 --> 01:38:31,781
it's,

3320
01:38:31,781 --> 01:38:35,980
it's something where if
you act a certain way,

3321
01:38:35,981 --> 01:38:37,390
do certain things,

3322
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:41,920
you get certain prizes for that.

3323
01:38:41,921 --> 01:38:45,820
Certain gifts you don't
get followed in a store.

3324
01:38:45,850 --> 01:38:47,290
Life's not a fucking carnival.

3325
01:38:47,410 --> 01:38:48,243
I know,

3326
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:49,263
I know,

3327
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:51,730
but you know to be followed in a store.

3328
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:52,573
Let me tell you something.

3329
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:53,950
When I was a kid,

3330
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:57,370
when five of me and my friends and
everything would go in at eight,

3331
01:38:57,371 --> 01:38:59,650
nine years old to a candy store,

3332
01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:03,060
we got followed in the candy
store because the fucking Guy,

3333
01:39:03,061 --> 01:39:06,790
I knew that people that were stealing
candy where the eight year old fucking

3334
01:39:06,791 --> 01:39:08,290
kids that would come into his store.

3335
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:11,290
So he followed us to make
sure we didn't steal.

3336
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:12,723
Uh,

3337
01:39:12,850 --> 01:39:13,181
when,

3338
01:39:13,181 --> 01:39:15,520
when people go into stores
now and they are followed,

3339
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:19,030
they look at the people
that have been profiled yes.

3340
01:39:19,031 --> 01:39:23,410
Profiled over the course of
their loss prevention and say,

3341
01:39:23,470 --> 01:39:24,303
all right,

3342
01:39:24,310 --> 01:39:26,800
make sure you keep an eye on these.

3343
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:30,520
We can individually interview everyone
that comes in and find out what their

3344
01:39:30,521 --> 01:39:31,420
character is.

3345
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:36,720
So let's just take the slice of people
that have been doing the most damage to

3346
01:39:37,451 --> 01:39:40,810
our inventory and follow them
around a little or you know,

3347
01:39:40,910 --> 01:39:43,450
falling with the camera but
in the back room a yeah.

3348
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:44,380
Yeah.

3349
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:48,790
Because that's pretty much where we
have kind of fallen there and the,

3350
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:50,260
and the theft of a,

3351
01:39:50,710 --> 01:39:51,880
of goods at stores.

3352
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:56,780
When do what people want people to do
that do live in places where they do get

3353
01:39:56,781 --> 01:39:59,180
robbed all the time by black people.

3354
01:39:59,181 --> 01:40:02,720
I wonder what they expect the
store owners to actually do.

3355
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:03,710
I don't know.

3356
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:05,180
Just ignore it.

3357
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:05,901
Let it happen.

3358
01:40:05,901 --> 01:40:07,010
Let it happen.

3359
01:40:07,130 --> 01:40:07,963
Get robbed.

3360
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:09,073
Get robbed.

3361
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:13,280
Do you remember those Korean store owners
that were fighting back against the

3362
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:14,900
Reginald Denny Shit,

3363
01:40:14,901 --> 01:40:18,770
the ride during the riots and the
Rodney King David got some guns too.

3364
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:19,491
They had to,

3365
01:40:19,491 --> 01:40:23,090
I mean there was some crazy shit going
on where they had nothing to do with any

3366
01:40:23,091 --> 01:40:24,340
verdict and nothing,

3367
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:29,650
but it was a free ride is a free ride and
we got to see a very unique and almost

3368
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:39,250
almost like accepted form
of racial violence during
that time where like people

3369
01:40:42,410 --> 01:40:47,410
where we're literally targeting white
people and attacking them and no one was

3370
01:40:48,171 --> 01:40:49,004
being out.

3371
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:49,251
No,

3372
01:40:49,251 --> 01:40:50,810
there was an excuse for it.

3373
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:51,311
There was that.

3374
01:40:51,311 --> 01:40:51,771
Well,

3375
01:40:51,771 --> 01:40:54,170
you got understand the dre man,

3376
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,630
they're very angry,

3377
01:40:55,631 --> 01:41:00,580
very frustrated as they lob that planter
over that man's head who's laying on

3378
01:41:00,581 --> 01:41:01,414
the ground that,

3379
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:01,781
oh,

3380
01:41:01,781 --> 01:41:05,020
here comes the toilet bowl lid and
there's a lot of blood on the street.

3381
01:41:05,021 --> 01:41:08,530
But the anger is really the
story we have to look at here.

3382
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:11,920
It was accepted completely and I think,

3383
01:41:11,921 --> 01:41:12,750
um,

3384
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:13,940
we saw yes,

3385
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:18,950
sanctioned and we see a lot of stuff in
'em happen that happened in Ferguson.

3386
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:20,850
What does this say?

3387
01:41:20,850 --> 01:41:22,780
La Riots and the looting.

3388
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:24,010
That was crazy.

3389
01:41:24,011 --> 01:41:24,431
Crazy.

3390
01:41:24,431 --> 01:41:25,570
Looting is a weird thing.

3391
01:41:25,571 --> 01:41:25,870
Like,

3392
01:41:25,870 --> 01:41:26,171
oh,

3393
01:41:26,171 --> 01:41:27,130
something went wrong.

3394
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,960
It's time to steal TVs.

3395
01:41:28,961 --> 01:41:29,794
Yes.

3396
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:32,073
Yeah.

3397
01:41:32,350 --> 01:41:32,681
Yeah.

3398
01:41:32,681 --> 01:41:34,600
And it's a very festive thing.

3399
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:35,260
Like,

3400
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:35,740
like the,

3401
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:35,981
the,

3402
01:41:35,981 --> 01:41:40,981
the reason that the looting goes on is
very grim and it's usually a very awful

3403
01:41:41,171 --> 01:41:42,004
thing that happened.

3404
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:43,780
But then the looting itself,

3405
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,010
everyone's smiling.

3406
01:41:45,011 --> 01:41:46,070
Like they come out wall,

3407
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:47,950
they're like Colden stuff up.

3408
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:49,000
No one's mad anymore.

3409
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:52,630
Maybe it helps alleviate tension.

3410
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:55,180
Tension breaker dancing.

3411
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:56,100
Just dancing around.

3412
01:41:56,130 --> 01:41:56,681
Looting though.

3413
01:41:56,681 --> 01:41:57,514
He sees,

3414
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:58,420
yeah,

3415
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:00,170
they're stealing this huge drill

3416
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:03,833
dance

3417
01:42:05,410 --> 01:42:08,650
dance on dragging it on
the ground with a fuck.

3418
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:11,830
It's always been my dream
to make little wooden Wales

3419
01:42:14,830 --> 01:42:15,850
try sell them that.

3420
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:17,441
Yeah.

3421
01:42:17,441 --> 01:42:19,190
Where are you going to get
advance that Yo man can

3422
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:21,250
no,

3423
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:22,490
you gotta come get it homie.

3424
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:25,870
15 blocks.

3425
01:42:26,450 --> 01:42:28,870
The throwing up gang signs
where they're standing signs.

3426
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:31,090
That's a pretty good la riots,

3427
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:35,800
but I will never forget that photo or
the video rather of Jenny Denny getting

3428
01:42:35,801 --> 01:42:38,710
pulled out of his truck and
then that guy took that brick,

3429
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:44,320
smashed him in the head with it and then
did a little victory dance and Reginald

3430
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:45,670
Denny was just a truck driver.

3431
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:46,631
He didn't do anything.

3432
01:42:46,631 --> 01:42:46,990
No,

3433
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:47,801
he wasn't a cop.

3434
01:42:47,801 --> 01:42:49,060
He didn't beat anybody.

3435
01:42:49,061 --> 01:42:50,130
He's just what he did wrong.

3436
01:42:50,410 --> 01:42:51,380
Stepped on the breaks.

3437
01:42:51,381 --> 01:42:51,940
Yeah.

3438
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:55,040
That mother fucker shit fucking bog.

3439
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:58,083
Yeah.

3440
01:42:58,110 --> 01:42:58,943
Right.

3441
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:00,220
Don't you have a lock?

3442
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:00,790
What are you doing?

3443
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:01,091
Yeah.

3444
01:43:01,091 --> 01:43:01,631
What are you doing?

3445
01:43:01,631 --> 01:43:02,380
Getting out.

3446
01:43:02,380 --> 01:43:03,260
This is the video.

3447
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:03,550
Oh,

3448
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:04,151
there it is.

3449
01:43:04,151 --> 01:43:04,510
Yeah.

3450
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:05,950
Awful awful shit.

3451
01:43:06,010 --> 01:43:07,870
I remember watching this lie bastard.

3452
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:09,790
Yeah,

3453
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,050
take it away earlier.

3454
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:12,870
They just,

3455
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:16,840
when when things go bad
and people start writing,

3456
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:19,000
they just completely lose their humanity.

3457
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:23,170
Something that happens to human beings
when you get too much of us together and

3458
01:43:23,171 --> 01:43:26,500
they're mad about something
and chaos is going on,

3459
01:43:26,501 --> 01:43:29,170
like people are smashing
shit and stealing shit.

3460
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:31,360
It's just all the rules go out the window.

3461
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,530
It's accepts it.

3462
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,120
They call it a mob mentality,

3463
01:43:34,121 --> 01:43:36,100
but I think it's more
than just a mental thing.

3464
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:40,400
I actually think there's a
physical like pheromones or,

3465
01:43:40,401 --> 01:43:44,800
or there's something that's thrown off
by people in a group like that that just

3466
01:43:44,801 --> 01:43:46,090
makes everyone rabid.

3467
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:46,330
Yeah.

3468
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:49,990
Look at everybody like chasing after
the cars when the cars are slowing down.

3469
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:51,200
Like some cars,

3470
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:52,070
they're leaving alarm,

3471
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,630
but other cars have white people in them.

3472
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:55,940
They're chasing after the white people,

3473
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:58,100
I assume I would assume too.

3474
01:43:58,310 --> 01:44:02,870
And regimental Denny's truck just
breakdown or something like it doesn't it

3475
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:04,180
stop,

3476
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:04,550
right.

3477
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:06,470
Maybe people were in the crosswalk.

3478
01:44:06,471 --> 01:44:06,840
He don't know.

3479
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:07,101
You know,

3480
01:44:07,101 --> 01:44:08,060
you don't go out.

3481
01:44:08,210 --> 01:44:10,460
I don't think you think this
is going to happen to you.

3482
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:12,350
So maybe he stopped,

3483
01:44:12,351 --> 01:44:12,830
uh,

3484
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:14,630
to let people go through the crosswalk.

3485
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:15,231
Yeah.

3486
01:44:15,231 --> 01:44:15,590
Right.

3487
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:16,423
You know,

3488
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:17,773
a boy,

3489
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:20,210
they beat the fuck out of that.

3490
01:44:20,211 --> 01:44:21,140
They really did.

3491
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:23,263
She was driving.

3492
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:24,840
He was driving real slow.

3493
01:44:24,841 --> 01:44:27,840
I thought totally on that
move to move to the side.

3494
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:29,760
I could take him to the hospital.

3495
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:33,020
What did you pick him up off
the street all by yourself and,

3496
01:44:33,021 --> 01:44:33,500
and uh,

3497
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,340
get them in your truck?

3498
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:34,670
No,

3499
01:44:34,670 --> 01:44:37,220
he was already the other
part that they have to do.

3500
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:37,521
It's like,

3501
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:37,791
well,

3502
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:42,710
let's show who took him to the
hospital are black gentleman.

3503
01:44:43,070 --> 01:44:46,300
Let's show that everybody
that they're not all bad.

3504
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:48,140
Did this last more than one day?

3505
01:44:48,141 --> 01:44:49,260
I can't remember what your day.

3506
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:49,880
Yeah.

3507
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:50,481
This one on,

3508
01:44:50,481 --> 01:44:51,980
there were many deaths too.

3509
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:52,341
Well,

3510
01:44:52,341 --> 01:44:57,140
Anthony Bourdain's show was fascinating
about this because they talked to the

3511
01:44:57,141 --> 01:44:58,100
Korean folks.

3512
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,440
They talk about some
of the people that had,

3513
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:01,303
uh,

3514
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:03,080
shops that had been raided.

3515
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:04,820
I feel sorry for your mother town.

3516
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:06,770
Korea town got fucked.

3517
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:10,370
But there was like a line of
cops protecting Beverly hills.

3518
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:14,630
Like there's cop cars like
literally down the streets skeet.

3519
01:45:14,631 --> 01:45:15,010
Whoa.

3520
01:45:15,010 --> 01:45:15,843
That's funny,

3521
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:16,790
man.

3522
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:17,270
Yeah.

3523
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:17,391
Well,

3524
01:45:17,391 --> 01:45:18,730
wouldn't you fucking,

3525
01:45:19,010 --> 01:45:20,240
everything's on fire in Korea.

3526
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:20,931
Yeah.

3527
01:45:20,931 --> 01:45:21,111
Well,

3528
01:45:21,111 --> 01:45:24,860
they were also getting mad at Koreans
that were on top of the roofs with rifles.

3529
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:28,040
People at shotguns and shit and they
were protecting their businesses.

3530
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:28,641
It's like,

3531
01:45:28,641 --> 01:45:28,791
yeah,

3532
01:45:28,791 --> 01:45:31,670
they were protecting Beverly
hills and the wealthy areas,

3533
01:45:31,671 --> 01:45:32,210
but it's like,

3534
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:34,220
what do you put in your
safe in your own house?

3535
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:35,241
You don't put,

3536
01:45:35,241 --> 01:45:35,930
you know,

3537
01:45:35,930 --> 01:45:37,310
fucking candy bars in there.

3538
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:38,660
You put your valuables in there.

3539
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:39,830
It's the same thing.

3540
01:45:39,831 --> 01:45:41,810
They want the valuable stuff protected.

3541
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:42,711
Yeah,

3542
01:45:42,711 --> 01:45:44,570
and the people that are
spending all the money,

3543
01:45:44,571 --> 01:45:45,260
right.

3544
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:46,670
Paying all the taxes.

3545
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:47,391
Exactly.

3546
01:45:47,391 --> 01:45:52,220
It's just a larger scale of your own
personal little life that's you want to

3547
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:53,870
protect your investment.

3548
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:57,740
What do you think would happen
if the fucking raids and the the,

3549
01:45:57,741 --> 01:45:58,970
the people that were going crazy,

3550
01:45:58,971 --> 01:46:00,260
if they went into Beverly hills,

3551
01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:02,330
start pulling people out
of their houses and Shit,

3552
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:03,500
that would've,

3553
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:05,540
you would have absolutely seen the,

3554
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,380
the national guards start just
shooting people like it was Vietnam,

3555
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:10,780
I probably right.

3556
01:46:10,850 --> 01:46:11,210
Yeah.

3557
01:46:11,210 --> 01:46:12,043
Yeah.

3558
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:13,340
That just would have been,

3559
01:46:13,430 --> 01:46:14,181
it's not fucked,

3560
01:46:14,181 --> 01:46:15,014
unheard of.

3561
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:17,930
Korean people can get
fucked over like that,

3562
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:22,160
but the moment they move into the Jewish
neighborhoods and start yanking people

3563
01:46:22,161 --> 01:46:23,900
out of their houses and
the white neighborhoods.

3564
01:46:23,901 --> 01:46:24,070
Yeah.

3565
01:46:24,070 --> 01:46:24,470
Yeah.

3566
01:46:24,470 --> 01:46:25,520
That would be crazy.

3567
01:46:25,521 --> 01:46:26,241
Again though it's,

3568
01:46:26,241 --> 01:46:26,720
you know,

3569
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:27,553
it's,

3570
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:32,270
it's cost effective to protect
the wealthy neighborhoods.

3571
01:46:32,570 --> 01:46:33,730
That's still fuck though.

3572
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:33,951
You know,

3573
01:46:33,951 --> 01:46:37,580
you're using your police resources
to protect your other resources.

3574
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:38,990
There's a price on everything.

3575
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:44,140
Do you feel like now when situations
come up a racial situation,

3576
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:45,740
you have more freedom?

3577
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:49,770
You have like you don't have this
like filter that you throw up.

3578
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,180
Like you would have to like pause
before you would talk about like there's

3579
01:46:53,190 --> 01:46:54,900
certain things like this,

3580
01:46:54,901 --> 01:46:55,830
what we're just talking about.

3581
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:57,120
Like there's certain people that would,

3582
01:46:57,121 --> 01:47:01,350
might think it'd be racist if we're
showing that they're attacking this guy

3583
01:47:01,470 --> 01:47:06,470
simply because he's white by exposing
an obvious incident of pure racism,

3584
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,110
pulling a guy out because he's white,

3585
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:11,040
hit him in the head with a brick.

3586
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:12,240
You're being racist.

3587
01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:15,840
You're commenting on that and not
taking it all into perspective.

3588
01:47:15,841 --> 01:47:17,340
What about the context Anthony?

3589
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:20,640
Their life and the disenfranchised
Los Angeles neighborhood.

3590
01:47:20,670 --> 01:47:21,241
Exactly.

3591
01:47:21,241 --> 01:47:22,260
But then,

3592
01:47:22,290 --> 01:47:24,450
then we have like a nice debate,

3593
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,830
a nice little talk about it.

3594
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:26,903
Uh,

3595
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:28,290
that can be done.

3596
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:29,220
Why should,

3597
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:31,200
why should one side be silenced?

3598
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:31,890
I mean,

3599
01:47:31,890 --> 01:47:36,420
and I do feel more freedom to talk
openly and not have to walk on so many

3600
01:47:36,421 --> 01:47:39,120
eggshells when I'm trying
to present the point.

3601
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:39,960
Um,

3602
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:43,020
but that was what the most fucked up
thing about you getting fired was you

3603
01:47:43,021 --> 01:47:46,710
didn't even have an opportunity to
go on the radio and talk about it.

3604
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:47,160
No.

3605
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,530
And one of the things that I've talked
about on the show before a hundred times,

3606
01:47:49,531 --> 01:47:52,740
like your style of talking,

3607
01:47:52,741 --> 01:47:54,210
which is entertaining,

3608
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:57,180
is to rant and say crazy shit,

3609
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:58,620
swear a lot.

3610
01:47:58,621 --> 01:48:00,330
And that's exactly what you were doing.

3611
01:48:00,810 --> 01:48:01,860
I was stilling,

3612
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:02,521
I guess,

3613
01:48:02,521 --> 01:48:02,821
you know,

3614
01:48:02,821 --> 01:48:03,421
like you said,

3615
01:48:03,421 --> 01:48:05,810
if you put quotes around
it and print it does,

3616
01:48:05,811 --> 01:48:06,571
it looks different.

3617
01:48:06,571 --> 01:48:07,650
It looks a lot different.

3618
01:48:07,651 --> 01:48:12,180
But if you were on the show and you were
doing that and then Jimmy Norton starts

3619
01:48:12,181 --> 01:48:14,170
doing uncle Paul and then,

3620
01:48:14,510 --> 01:48:15,930
you know what I'm saying?

3621
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:19,980
And it was nothing different than I'd
done on their very airwaves for many

3622
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:20,280
years.

3623
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:23,520
And for them to throw me
out over over that was,

3624
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:24,330
it was ridiculous.

3625
01:48:24,330 --> 01:48:25,470
Make no sense whatsoever.

3626
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:28,260
And to demand an apology,

3627
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:29,940
a women and apology.

3628
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:30,181
Well,

3629
01:48:30,181 --> 01:48:32,730
there've been some people
who have demanded apologies,

3630
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:35,610
some people that think
I should have apologize,

3631
01:48:35,611 --> 01:48:37,380
let's say not so much demand at them,

3632
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:42,000
but think I should have apologized and
I have always stuck to the point that if

3633
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:45,270
I do something wrong I have
and will apologize for it.

3634
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:49,380
I was assaulted in New York City.

3635
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:49,920
I was,

3636
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,360
I was hit about the head.

3637
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:52,770
If people don't know the story,

3638
01:48:52,771 --> 01:48:56,010
there are certain people I'm sure that
are living listening to this that don't

3639
01:48:56,011 --> 01:48:56,720
know the story.

3640
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:57,450
Sure.

3641
01:48:57,450 --> 01:48:58,020
So let's,

3642
01:48:58,020 --> 01:48:59,800
let's give them the whole
brief for the story.

3643
01:48:59,801 --> 01:49:00,121
I was,

3644
01:49:00,121 --> 01:49:00,870
I was out,

3645
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:01,270
uh,

3646
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:06,270
I was taking some pictures early morning
pictures of Manhattan and I posted all

3647
01:49:06,361 --> 01:49:07,260
the pictures that I took.

3648
01:49:07,261 --> 01:49:07,890
It wasn't just,

3649
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:09,210
I was just creeping girls.

3650
01:49:09,211 --> 01:49:10,050
Like some people said,

3651
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:13,290
let's take an Manhattans and amazing
place at four in the morning.

3652
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:17,010
It's a giant lit up city
with barely anyone in it.

3653
01:49:17,370 --> 01:49:19,500
And the people that are
in it are a little off,

3654
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:20,131
uh,

3655
01:49:20,131 --> 01:49:21,150
including myself.

3656
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:23,910
Cause I was there with a camera
a and I was taking pictures.

3657
01:49:23,911 --> 01:49:24,744
It's amazing.

3658
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:25,230
Uh,

3659
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:26,880
and it's not the groundbreaking.

3660
01:49:26,910 --> 01:49:30,630
I mean other people have taken
amazing pictures of New York City,

3661
01:49:30,650 --> 01:49:31,140
uh,

3662
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:32,220
very early in the morning.

3663
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:36,570
So I was doing that and I took pictures
of a few of the ladies of the evening

3664
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:39,570
that walk around strippers that we're
leaving some of the strip clubs,

3665
01:49:39,571 --> 01:49:40,111
hookers,

3666
01:49:40,111 --> 01:49:40,531
whatever.

3667
01:49:40,531 --> 01:49:40,750
They're,

3668
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:41,580
they're hot.

3669
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:45,480
It looks great as they're walking on a
wet street with the lights behind them

3670
01:49:45,481 --> 01:49:47,890
and the nice shallow of field.

3671
01:49:47,891 --> 01:49:47,980
I

3672
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:48,161
mean,

3673
01:49:48,161 --> 01:49:50,770
it just looks like a
fucking amazing picture.

3674
01:49:51,190 --> 01:49:51,760
Uh,

3675
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:55,210
so I took a picture of this one woman
that was walking down the street.

3676
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:56,171
And again,

3677
01:49:56,171 --> 01:49:57,130
it was very early in the morning,

3678
01:49:57,131 --> 01:49:57,791
very quiet,

3679
01:49:57,791 --> 01:49:59,860
and it's a big fucking cannon camera.

3680
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:04,630
I wasn't with my iPhone and she hears
the shutter clicking and turns around to

3681
01:50:04,631 --> 01:50:05,320
look and she goes,

3682
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:06,153
ah,

3683
01:50:06,250 --> 01:50:07,870
you white motherfucker,

3684
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,610
don't you take my fucking picture?

3685
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:10,900
And she's coming at me,

3686
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:11,441
you know.

3687
01:50:11,441 --> 01:50:14,950
So I rattle off a couple of more
pictures because she's coming at me,

3688
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:15,820
uh,

3689
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:17,290
and just punches me right in the face,

3690
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:18,730
just punches me right in the face.

3691
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:19,571
No ifs,

3692
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:19,811
ands,

3693
01:50:19,811 --> 01:50:20,644
or buts.

3694
01:50:20,860 --> 01:50:21,520
And A,

3695
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:21,821
I'm like,

3696
01:50:21,821 --> 01:50:22,810
what the fuck are you doing?

3697
01:50:22,811 --> 01:50:24,220
I don't take my picture.

3698
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:25,240
I was like,

3699
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:25,451
well,

3700
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:26,410
you could have said that.

3701
01:50:26,411 --> 01:50:28,330
So we get into a little
argument about that.

3702
01:50:28,331 --> 01:50:29,220
I call her content.

3703
01:50:29,730 --> 01:50:30,563
Um,

3704
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:33,490
and she just keeps hitting me
and now out of the woodwork,

3705
01:50:33,491 --> 01:50:35,260
like fucking walking dead,

3706
01:50:35,410 --> 01:50:40,410
five black guys just start kind of kind
of walking around looking at the scene

3707
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:41,561
and one says,

3708
01:50:41,561 --> 01:50:43,030
you better not touch that girl.

3709
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:45,010
And I had my hand up.

3710
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:45,401
Uh,

3711
01:50:45,401 --> 01:50:47,660
I was just using it like my forearm to,

3712
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,050
to kind of let her bang into,

3713
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:51,880
I wasn't pushing her away or anything.

3714
01:50:51,881 --> 01:50:55,840
I just was trying to keep our at a
distance so I could see her fucking hands.

3715
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:56,711
Uh,

3716
01:50:56,711 --> 01:50:59,290
and she just was punching
me in the side of the head.

3717
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:00,460
It didn't hurt,

3718
01:51:00,610 --> 01:51:01,211
but it was just,

3719
01:51:01,211 --> 01:51:03,040
it was annoying me that
she was doing this.

3720
01:51:03,430 --> 01:51:04,263
Um,

3721
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:08,200
and then that's when I said one of the
most embarrassing things I think I ever

3722
01:51:08,201 --> 01:51:08,830
said.

3723
01:51:08,830 --> 01:51:10,270
I said to one of the black guys,

3724
01:51:10,271 --> 01:51:13,390
it said that I said back
off the saint to your show.

3725
01:51:16,590 --> 01:51:21,590
I'm Sergeant Barnes back off
this ancient the your show.

3726
01:51:22,450 --> 01:51:22,661
Yeah.

3727
01:51:22,661 --> 01:51:25,030
I'm Sergeant Barnes from
platoon to dropping the n bombs.

3728
01:51:25,330 --> 01:51:25,660
Uh,

3729
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:26,200
no,

3730
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:26,650
no.

3731
01:51:26,650 --> 01:51:27,371
That's one thing.

3732
01:51:27,371 --> 01:51:27,631
And I,

3733
01:51:27,631 --> 01:51:30,130
I didn't drop any in any
of my tweets or anything.

3734
01:51:30,131 --> 01:51:31,550
I just didn't say he was.

3735
01:51:31,570 --> 01:51:32,470
Who said that you did?

3736
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:36,400
Someone said that you did drop it in
by plenty of people that said I did and

3737
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:37,061
yeah,

3738
01:51:37,061 --> 01:51:37,720
people,

3739
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:40,450
most shit gets made up
in those situations.

3740
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:41,520
So,

3741
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:42,280
uh,

3742
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:42,640
she,

3743
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:45,430
I said I'm going to get a
fucking cop and she goes,

3744
01:51:45,431 --> 01:51:46,001
get a cop.

3745
01:51:46,001 --> 01:51:47,920
I'll just say you were
sexually harassing me.

3746
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:48,971
So now I'm like,

3747
01:51:48,971 --> 01:51:49,631
I'm looking around.

3748
01:51:49,631 --> 01:51:50,860
There wasn't any cops.

3749
01:51:50,910 --> 01:51:51,280
Uh,

3750
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:53,050
I wasn't exactly in time square.

3751
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:55,630
I was a little north of
Times Square at that point.

3752
01:51:55,950 --> 01:51:56,620
Um,

3753
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:56,991
but I,

3754
01:51:56,991 --> 01:51:57,400
I was,

3755
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:00,280
and I'm waiting to see a cop car just to
flag them down and tell them that this

3756
01:52:00,281 --> 01:52:03,160
fucking bitch is pounding
me on the side of the head.

3757
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:03,881
Uh,

3758
01:52:03,881 --> 01:52:04,840
but no cops showed up.

3759
01:52:04,841 --> 01:52:06,910
So we kind of break up a little bit.

3760
01:52:07,330 --> 01:52:07,571
Uh,

3761
01:52:07,571 --> 01:52:10,690
and I just start walking back
to my apartment and I'm pissed.

3762
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:13,600
And now within minutes of what happened,

3763
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:16,030
I'm actually communicating
to the outside world,

3764
01:52:16,180 --> 01:52:19,720
which years ago you would have time to
cool off and then make you maybe get on

3765
01:52:19,721 --> 01:52:20,770
your phone at home,

3766
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:23,500
call your friend and say these
fucking bitch was smacking me in that.

3767
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:26,290
But now minutes after I still
got the adrenaline going.

3768
01:52:26,291 --> 01:52:27,124
I'm angry,

3769
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:31,900
I'm pissed that this happened and I'm
voicing it on Twitter and this is what got

3770
01:52:31,901 --> 01:52:32,381
me in trouble.

3771
01:52:32,381 --> 01:52:32,980
And I say,

3772
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:37,300
I think my biggest crime here was the
fact that I was talking about the incident

3773
01:52:37,301 --> 01:52:38,200
and how pissed I was.

3774
01:52:38,350 --> 01:52:43,350
And then I also added a little social
commentary to the same conversation.

3775
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:46,220
So people put both of those
together and got the impression

3776
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:47,660
I was talking about all black people.

3777
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:48,501
Anthony said,

3778
01:52:48,501 --> 01:52:49,790
all black people are violent.

3779
01:52:50,210 --> 01:52:50,721
He said No.

3780
01:52:50,721 --> 01:52:51,021
I said,

3781
01:52:51,021 --> 01:52:54,710
there's a problem with violence in
some segments of the black community,

3782
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:56,810
which has been addressed by black leaders,

3783
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:58,700
reverends pastors,

3784
01:52:58,940 --> 01:52:59,810
community leaders.

3785
01:53:00,050 --> 01:53:00,640
It's been,

3786
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:01,130
it's,

3787
01:53:01,130 --> 01:53:02,390
it's just been out there,

3788
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:04,730
but you didn't check your white privilege.

3789
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,870
I didn't check my white privilege and I
brought it up that there was a problem.

3790
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:09,351
I said,

3791
01:53:09,351 --> 01:53:14,240
why did this woman jumped instantly
from zero to physical violence?

3792
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,500
There wasn't a talk.

3793
01:53:15,650 --> 01:53:16,011
I mean,

3794
01:53:16,011 --> 01:53:18,860
I could think of a lot of situations
where I would take a picture and someone

3795
01:53:18,861 --> 01:53:19,161
might go,

3796
01:53:19,161 --> 01:53:19,670
hey,

3797
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:21,320
I don't want my picture taken and I'd be,

3798
01:53:21,330 --> 01:53:21,570
oh,

3799
01:53:21,570 --> 01:53:22,130
okay.

3800
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:22,910
Whatever.

3801
01:53:22,910 --> 01:53:25,010
Without them instantly coming and,

3802
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:29,360
and resolution number one is
punched the person in the face.

3803
01:53:29,540 --> 01:53:31,250
That's one on the list.

3804
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:32,600
It's astounding.

3805
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:34,220
But she was probably a hooker,

3806
01:53:34,221 --> 01:53:34,610
right?

3807
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:35,060
Yeah,

3808
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:35,480
yeah.

3809
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:36,530
I'm thinking she was a hooker.

3810
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:37,610
Yeah.

3811
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:42,440
But I also took a picture of a white
hooker and it turned out to be a beautiful

3812
01:53:42,441 --> 01:53:42,950
picture.

3813
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:43,783
It was great.

3814
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:44,930
It was amazing.

3815
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:49,250
And she didn't catch me in the face and
she knew I was taking the picture and

3816
01:53:49,251 --> 01:53:50,060
she didn't mind.

3817
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:53,750
I got a picture of a black hooker once
was she pulled her tit out while she's

3818
01:53:53,751 --> 01:53:53,961
eating.

3819
01:53:53,961 --> 01:53:58,640
A meatball sub is one of the best
pictures ever taken in my life.

3820
01:53:58,830 --> 01:54:01,070
See if you can find it somewhere.

3821
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:02,810
It's in my wall.

3822
01:54:03,770 --> 01:54:07,550
I took it with an old phone to
look and Motorola flip phone.

3823
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:09,120
At the time it wasn't,

3824
01:54:09,220 --> 01:54:09,500
yeah,

3825
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:10,740
it wasn't a very town camera.

3826
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:12,830
Probably wasn't even a
one megapixel camera,

3827
01:54:13,190 --> 01:54:14,090
but the pictures,

3828
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:15,800
it looks like it was the sage.

3829
01:54:15,830 --> 01:54:17,690
It was the subject that really brought it.

3830
01:54:17,691 --> 01:54:19,820
You don't need good equipment
when you have a great subject.

3831
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:20,630
She's fat.

3832
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:21,830
She had a big giant tits.

3833
01:54:21,831 --> 01:54:24,110
She was eating a meatball
sub and she wore a wig,

3834
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:27,380
so all this was going on
and we're in downtown La.

3835
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:29,930
It's like one of the best pictures
I've ever taken in my life.

3836
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,233
It sounds it.

3837
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:32,600
And she was so happy though.

3838
01:54:32,630 --> 01:54:33,530
She was so happy.

3839
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:34,970
She didn't try to hit me at all.

3840
01:54:35,290 --> 01:54:36,123
Well,

3841
01:54:36,290 --> 01:54:36,801
I just go,

3842
01:54:36,801 --> 01:54:37,581
can I take a picture?

3843
01:54:37,581 --> 01:54:37,881
She goes,

3844
01:54:37,881 --> 01:54:38,601
go ahead baby.

3845
01:54:38,601 --> 01:54:42,050
And she pulls her tit out and I took
the picture and she had the sub in her

3846
01:54:42,051 --> 01:54:42,884
hand.

3847
01:54:43,070 --> 01:54:44,120
She pulled it it out.

3848
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:45,080
It was her idea.

3849
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:47,150
I wasn't say good for her.

3850
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:47,421
Yeah.

3851
01:54:47,421 --> 01:54:48,230
Nobody got hit.

3852
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:48,820
No one gets hurt.

3853
01:54:48,820 --> 01:54:49,180
Was it?

3854
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:50,300
I wasn't arm though.

3855
01:54:50,690 --> 01:54:51,411
That's the other thing.

3856
01:54:51,411 --> 01:54:51,481
Yeah,

3857
01:54:51,481 --> 01:54:53,150
that was the other thing that came up.

3858
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:53,481
Well,

3859
01:54:53,481 --> 01:54:53,661
they,

3860
01:54:53,661 --> 01:54:57,560
the Sirius XM fired me because they
said it wasn't the race racial thing.

3861
01:54:57,770 --> 01:55:02,770
They said it was the violent tone of
some of my tweets and it was because I

3862
01:55:03,261 --> 01:55:03,710
said,

3863
01:55:03,710 --> 01:55:08,710
I fucking hope some ha she mouths off
to some homeboy like that and he shoots

3864
01:55:08,991 --> 01:55:09,824
her in the face.

3865
01:55:10,370 --> 01:55:10,911
That's what I said,

3866
01:55:10,911 --> 01:55:12,080
because at that point,

3867
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:13,610
that's what I wanted,

3868
01:55:14,090 --> 01:55:18,650
because if this bitch is going to be
just Malvin often smacking people,

3869
01:55:18,770 --> 01:55:21,500
I'm sure she's gonna get her
ass handed to her at some point.

3870
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:23,180
If she'd mouths off to the wrong person.

3871
01:55:23,330 --> 01:55:24,350
I on the other hand,

3872
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:25,580
didn't hit her back.

3873
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:26,080
I,

3874
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:26,480
I,

3875
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:26,991
like I said,

3876
01:55:26,991 --> 01:55:30,500
I put my forearm up to just keep
her from getting closer to me.

3877
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:34,400
But that was the only contact and it
was her banging against my arm saying,

3878
01:55:34,401 --> 01:55:37,010
don't touch me and
punching me in the face.

3879
01:55:37,310 --> 01:55:41,600
So the violent tone of my
tweet is what they didn't like.

3880
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:42,560
Meanwhile,

3881
01:55:42,650 --> 01:55:43,200
yes,

3882
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:48,200
I am a privileged to be able to exercise
my actual right a second amendment

3883
01:55:49,291 --> 01:55:54,291
right to bear arms and carry a concealed
weapon in the city of New York.

3884
01:55:54,450 --> 01:55:54,621
Yeah,

3885
01:55:54,621 --> 01:55:56,580
you one of the very rare people,

3886
01:55:56,581 --> 01:55:56,791
I mean,

3887
01:55:56,791 --> 01:55:57,780
if she wanted a punch,

3888
01:55:57,781 --> 01:55:58,980
some dude in the head,

3889
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:00,330
that's not a cop.

3890
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:05,490
And think what are the odds this guy
has a fucking write a license to carry a

3891
01:56:05,491 --> 01:56:06,290
pistol,

3892
01:56:06,290 --> 01:56:08,310
a legal license to carry a pistol.

3893
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:09,750
How long did it take you to get that?

3894
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,010
It was a good year,

3895
01:56:11,070 --> 01:56:16,070
I guess a year and thousands of dollars
and I had to fess up with every bit of,

3896
01:56:17,090 --> 01:56:19,470
of record of my entire life.

3897
01:56:19,471 --> 01:56:20,700
Pretty much like,

3898
01:56:20,701 --> 01:56:21,210
here,

3899
01:56:21,210 --> 01:56:22,590
here's my tax forms,

3900
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:24,270
here's anything I ever did,

3901
01:56:24,271 --> 01:56:29,271
including a ticket and how it was
resolved in 1988 I got a speeding ticket.

3902
01:56:29,371 --> 01:56:30,320
Or like a parking,

3903
01:56:30,690 --> 01:56:32,160
like a parking ticket speed.

3904
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:32,341
No,

3905
01:56:32,341 --> 01:56:33,091
not parking tickets.

3906
01:56:33,091 --> 01:56:33,924
Speeding ticket.

3907
01:56:34,030 --> 01:56:34,863
Yeah.

3908
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:36,173
And uh,

3909
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:37,860
you know anything,

3910
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:40,110
you just put it in front
of them because they,

3911
01:56:40,111 --> 01:56:42,060
if they find something you didn't include,

3912
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:43,170
they will say,

3913
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:43,650
whoop,

3914
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:44,483
nope.

3915
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:45,361
So you've got,

3916
01:56:45,361 --> 01:56:47,160
you're playing this weird puzzle game,

3917
01:56:47,630 --> 01:56:47,940
uh,

3918
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:49,320
with them to try to get this.

3919
01:56:49,321 --> 01:56:51,090
And then you need a lawyer.

3920
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:52,650
You can't go in there yourself.

3921
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:53,491
Crazy.

3922
01:56:53,491 --> 01:56:55,740
So you've got to retain a
lawyer for probably five g's.

3923
01:56:55,770 --> 01:56:59,550
You need to get a lawyer to try to
get a concealed carry gun lawyer,

3924
01:56:59,610 --> 01:57:00,480
a gun lawyer.

3925
01:57:00,510 --> 01:57:01,343
Yeah.

3926
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:02,310
There she is.

3927
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:03,780
Oh that's my girl.

3928
01:57:03,781 --> 01:57:04,680
Fantastic.

3929
01:57:04,681 --> 01:57:05,840
Put a picture of her boobs.

3930
01:57:05,841 --> 01:57:08,050
So that's really cool
that I can make it out.

3931
01:57:09,490 --> 01:57:10,820
We'll look at that.

3932
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:11,310
Come on.

3933
01:57:11,310 --> 01:57:14,220
That is with the greatest picture of
ever taking them on as a good one.

3934
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:15,150
That girl,

3935
01:57:15,150 --> 01:57:17,280
she was a real woman and she was happy.

3936
01:57:17,310 --> 01:57:18,210
She was laughing.

3937
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:19,740
That is something.

3938
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:21,083
Wow,

3939
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:23,273
that's great.

3940
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:25,480
I hate this dog cause
I see Morgan and miss.

3941
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:27,270
I Miss Patrice so much,

3942
01:57:27,271 --> 01:57:28,530
which I do too.

3943
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:31,260
She's a meatball sandwich and her hand,

3944
01:57:31,261 --> 01:57:32,790
I mean it's just an amazing picture.

3945
01:57:32,850 --> 01:57:33,360
Hey,

3946
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:34,193
she got to eat.

3947
01:57:34,410 --> 01:57:34,721
Yeah.

3948
01:57:34,721 --> 01:57:36,930
And you're going to do it was
just as good as a picture gets.

3949
01:57:37,330 --> 01:57:37,770
Um,

3950
01:57:37,770 --> 01:57:38,770
so yeah,

3951
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:40,830
so it takes a long time.

3952
01:57:40,831 --> 01:57:41,664
A lot of effort.

3953
01:57:41,730 --> 01:57:44,820
And I think they bank on the fact that
a lot of people aren't going to go to

3954
01:57:44,821 --> 01:57:46,500
that length and a,

3955
01:57:46,501 --> 01:57:47,940
and they've turned down a lot of people,

3956
01:57:47,941 --> 01:57:48,774
a lot of uh,

3957
01:57:48,830 --> 01:57:49,440
uh,

3958
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:52,530
someone did an article a few years back
on who they turned it down and it was a

3959
01:57:52,531 --> 01:57:54,450
lot of people like on the mets and uh,

3960
01:57:54,451 --> 01:57:54,781
some,

3961
01:57:54,781 --> 01:57:58,050
some radio personalities and
some pretty big celebrities.

3962
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:59,580
So what did you say?

3963
01:57:59,581 --> 01:57:59,970
Like,

3964
01:57:59,970 --> 01:58:02,550
did you have to have a
reason that you wanted,

3965
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,680
it's pretty good if you have a reason and,

3966
01:58:04,681 --> 01:58:05,100
uh,

3967
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:06,800
as far as to protect your ego,

3968
01:58:06,810 --> 01:58:07,350
Amos.

3969
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:07,681
Yeah,

3970
01:58:07,681 --> 01:58:08,180
I've got,

3971
01:58:08,180 --> 01:58:09,780
I get a lot of uh,

3972
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:10,441
death threats.

3973
01:58:10,441 --> 01:58:11,490
He saved them up and things.

3974
01:58:11,670 --> 01:58:12,120
Yeah.

3975
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:12,953
Good.

3976
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:13,891
Have that.

3977
01:58:13,891 --> 01:58:15,510
You bring those in and stuff.

3978
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:15,810
Yeah.

3979
01:58:15,810 --> 01:58:16,290
Yeah.

3980
01:58:16,290 --> 01:58:18,360
Like a threat assessment,

3981
01:58:19,170 --> 01:58:22,980
threat assessment done
by security guy and um,

3982
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:23,761
and yeah,

3983
01:58:23,761 --> 01:58:24,600
you get these letters.

3984
01:58:24,601 --> 01:58:28,710
I get letters to mail directly to my
house that have just all kinds of Nazi

3985
01:58:28,711 --> 01:58:30,810
propaganda and you know,

3986
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:31,680
uh,

3987
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:36,030
just weird shit and tear your house to
my house so they know where you live.

3988
01:58:36,031 --> 01:58:37,790
Fucking 2014 PV.

3989
01:58:37,810 --> 01:58:39,750
You could find out where anyone lives now.

3990
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:42,280
It's no secret to you when,

3991
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:42,821
okay,

3992
01:58:42,821 --> 01:58:44,510
when you have all this stuff you,

3993
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:46,150
you bring it to them and you say,

3994
01:58:46,151 --> 01:58:46,481
look,

3995
01:58:46,481 --> 01:58:47,920
these are the threats that I get.

3996
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,450
So let your lawyer though it.

3997
01:58:49,660 --> 01:58:49,990
Yeah,

3998
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:50,920
they'll let the lawyer doe it.

3999
01:58:50,921 --> 01:58:51,641
You give it to him.

4000
01:58:51,641 --> 01:58:55,510
Everything he asked for the lawyer knows
what to kind of ask for is actually

4001
01:58:55,511 --> 01:58:59,590
shows that you were a good risk
to give that sort of a license to.

4002
01:58:59,590 --> 01:59:03,250
That's what they're doing because
you got hit by this woman.

4003
01:59:03,251 --> 01:59:03,460
Right,

4004
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:05,470
and you never want escalated.

4005
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:10,680
I never do not hit her thought about
it like because it's a huge fucking

4006
01:59:10,811 --> 01:59:12,520
responsibility having a gun.

4007
01:59:12,521 --> 01:59:16,030
It's an in something that
you never not think about.

4008
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:21,060
You need to know that you have this on
you and that kind of leads you into how

4009
01:59:21,401 --> 01:59:23,110
you handle certain situations.

4010
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:25,780
What would you have done if those
guys or five guys that were circling

4011
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:27,911
back off,

4012
01:59:27,911 --> 01:59:28,870
it's not your show.

4013
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:30,550
Those guys came in.

4014
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:32,290
I'd probably just tried to run.

4015
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:35,970
I've run into times square
where there were cops like they,

4016
01:59:35,971 --> 01:59:38,130
if if your light,

4017
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:38,920
if you're going,

4018
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:40,390
I have no way out of this.

4019
01:59:40,391 --> 01:59:42,580
I am fucked and I am going to die.

4020
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:44,020
Then the gun comes out.

4021
01:59:44,021 --> 01:59:44,950
So you would run,

4022
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:48,490
I would run my icing you and
they grabbed a hold of you once.

4023
01:59:48,490 --> 01:59:50,290
Once they grab a hold of you again.

4024
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:50,740
Yeah.

4025
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:54,640
It's life threatening
situations are very fluid.

4026
01:59:54,670 --> 01:59:56,260
They change by the second,

4027
01:59:56,530 --> 02:00:00,130
so based on what's happening
at that very second,

4028
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:01,750
if you use deadly physical force,

4029
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:02,920
you might be fucked.

4030
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:04,360
We might be justified.

4031
02:00:04,570 --> 02:00:05,403
That's how,

4032
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:10,560
that's how crazy it is to
try to get a hypothetical.

4033
02:00:10,690 --> 02:00:11,740
The legality of it.

4034
02:00:11,741 --> 02:00:12,151
Yeah,

4035
02:00:12,151 --> 02:00:15,100
so if you're in that situation and she's
hitting you and they close it and he

4036
02:00:15,101 --> 02:00:16,210
just pull the gun out.

4037
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:17,530
Yeah,

4038
02:00:17,530 --> 02:00:18,850
that's brandishing.

4039
02:00:20,030 --> 02:00:22,900
It could work my trouble.

4040
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:24,790
Someone else could pull on out and go,

4041
02:00:24,791 --> 02:00:25,001
yeah,

4042
02:00:25,001 --> 02:00:26,290
I've got one of those two mother fuckers.

4043
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:27,060
You know,

4044
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:27,970
it's you're,

4045
02:00:27,971 --> 02:00:30,790
you're putting a weird situation
where it absolutely is.

4046
02:00:30,791 --> 02:00:34,420
The last ditch effort to
save your life is that gun.

4047
02:00:34,630 --> 02:00:38,530
It's not your first fucking
way to try to save yourself.

4048
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:41,320
I'm not saying that your controls
amazing cause you didn't shoot her,

4049
02:00:41,321 --> 02:00:44,620
but you control is pretty
amazing that you didn't hit her,

4050
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:45,730
you didn't do anything.

4051
02:00:45,730 --> 02:00:46,060
Yeah,

4052
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:46,720
I'm harmer.

4053
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:47,140
I,

4054
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:47,973
I wasn't,

4055
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:50,650
I didn't feel like I was
really being injured.

4056
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:53,530
She was hitting me with
those kind of girl fish.

4057
02:00:53,531 --> 02:00:56,770
You had to make our fists weird because
she had the long nails so she really

4058
02:00:56,771 --> 02:01:00,310
couldn't make a fist and that she was
kind of doing this side of the head thing,

4059
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:02,710
like my ears a little and my cheek.

4060
02:01:02,980 --> 02:01:04,600
She wasn't really boxing me,

4061
02:01:04,601 --> 02:01:05,380
you know,

4062
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:08,800
so I never felt like I was on the
verge of being knocked out right.

4063
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:11,140
Or injured or even injured.

4064
02:01:11,410 --> 02:01:16,410
So I was able to keep going and keep
reassessing as it went on and realize I'm

4065
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:20,440
being kind of dumb
staying in this situation.

4066
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:22,480
Let me break this off and go home.

4067
02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:25,510
A lot of people that once
they get hit that's flipped.

4068
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:26,110
Yeah.

4069
02:01:26,110 --> 02:01:26,440
Yeah.

4070
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:28,960
The switch flips and then they hit back.

4071
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:30,430
If it was a guy,

4072
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:33,780
I would have reacted in
a second and hit him.

4073
02:01:33,830 --> 02:01:34,391
And that sounds like,

4074
02:01:34,391 --> 02:01:34,571
yeah,

4075
02:01:34,571 --> 02:01:35,680
let me tell if it was a dude,

4076
02:01:35,681 --> 02:01:40,460
I'd have been all over the flatter the
face thrown a or summit or a woman.

4077
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:42,770
But you can't punch a girl.

4078
02:01:42,771 --> 02:01:43,604
I don't know.

4079
02:01:43,790 --> 02:01:45,200
I would have loved to,

4080
02:01:45,290 --> 02:01:50,290
I have love to punch her right in the
fucking face would have made me so happy.

4081
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:53,360
But would you have punched her in
the face if she was punching you?

4082
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:54,050
She was like,

4083
02:01:54,050 --> 02:01:54,701
if she has,

4084
02:01:54,701 --> 02:01:55,920
she has a really punching me.

4085
02:01:55,921 --> 02:01:59,850
If she had like her knuckles up it had
to do some trying to knock you out.

4086
02:01:59,870 --> 02:02:00,020
Yeah,

4087
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:00,650
I would have,

4088
02:02:00,650 --> 02:02:03,230
I have to have done some defending you.

4089
02:02:03,231 --> 02:02:05,880
So I do a lot of what ifs.

4090
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:08,390
That's a hard situation
because when you're in it,

4091
02:02:08,391 --> 02:02:11,060
you know for just from fighting,

4092
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:12,291
when you're in it,

4093
02:02:12,291 --> 02:02:15,140
it's different than when you're
thinking what you would do in a fight.

4094
02:02:15,170 --> 02:02:16,003
It's weird.

4095
02:02:16,130 --> 02:02:18,080
You know what everyone
thinks it's going to be like,

4096
02:02:18,081 --> 02:02:18,530
you know,

4097
02:02:18,530 --> 02:02:23,150
some fucking action movie fight or leg
kicks come out cause it's like you're not

4098
02:02:23,151 --> 02:02:24,400
even hitting her in the head.

4099
02:02:24,401 --> 02:02:27,380
Just one solid one right above the knee.

4100
02:02:27,381 --> 02:02:28,450
That meaty part,

4101
02:02:28,700 --> 02:02:29,630
the shins,

4102
02:02:30,730 --> 02:02:33,530
just one one fucking really hard.

4103
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:39,400
Nobody expects that chicken high heels
to go running to turn the hip over.

4104
02:02:39,650 --> 02:02:41,090
But then I want to eat into it.

4105
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:44,240
Then I might have to deal with
the five little helpers there.

4106
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:45,770
That would have been a problem.

4107
02:02:46,220 --> 02:02:46,910
True that.

4108
02:02:46,910 --> 02:02:48,020
So you did the right thing.

4109
02:02:48,050 --> 02:02:48,950
You know I was,

4110
02:02:49,010 --> 02:02:51,590
I was really waiting for a fucking cop.

4111
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:55,160
I would love to him had
a cop drive by and go,

4112
02:02:55,161 --> 02:02:55,940
hey,

4113
02:02:55,940 --> 02:02:56,181
you know,

4114
02:02:56,181 --> 02:02:57,170
but I had to just,

4115
02:02:57,171 --> 02:02:57,411
you know,

4116
02:02:57,411 --> 02:03:01,520
whatever and kind of backed off and
started walking home and tweeting and

4117
02:03:01,521 --> 02:03:04,220
tweeting my anger that that gets me fired.

4118
02:03:04,370 --> 02:03:09,370
And then the thought that I should
apologize that anyone that just heard the

4119
02:03:09,411 --> 02:03:14,060
story second hand or anything thinks that
I should then apologize for anything I

4120
02:03:14,061 --> 02:03:15,740
tweeted in that angry moment.

4121
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:19,760
Twitter isn't a fucking
representation of anything,

4122
02:03:19,761 --> 02:03:22,400
but how I'm feeling at that
moment that I'm tweeting.

4123
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:24,740
It's an open forum of that.

4124
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:29,200
It's just not a good form for you
because you're so animated in should,

4125
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:30,500
it should be.

4126
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:31,071
It should.

4127
02:03:31,071 --> 02:03:36,071
I should be allowed to post
just outrageous things as
should any body and end.

4128
02:03:36,441 --> 02:03:38,360
If it captures the mood I'm in,

4129
02:03:38,750 --> 02:03:39,620
then deal with it.

4130
02:03:39,650 --> 02:03:41,150
This is what just happened to me.

4131
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,800
Holy Fuck this.

4132
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:43,551
Read this.

4133
02:03:43,551 --> 02:03:46,220
And you could really feel
how Anthony feels right now,

4134
02:03:46,370 --> 02:03:48,530
or this guy or that guy
based on what that feels.

4135
02:03:48,710 --> 02:03:50,090
Why is that bad?

4136
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:51,590
Why is it so bad?

4137
02:03:51,591 --> 02:03:55,190
I don't think I hurt anyone's
feelings to be honest.

4138
02:03:55,370 --> 02:03:59,480
I've gotten into many debates with people
and didn't use a horrible language or

4139
02:03:59,481 --> 02:04:00,690
insult anybody and,

4140
02:04:00,691 --> 02:04:03,350
and I pissed them off
just by debating them.

4141
02:04:03,650 --> 02:04:07,520
So by really expressing how
angry I was at that moment.

4142
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:09,410
How is that a bad thing?

4143
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:11,420
How is that a firing offense?

4144
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:12,291
Well,

4145
02:04:12,291 --> 02:04:14,030
they just protect their brand.

4146
02:04:14,031 --> 02:04:14,930
That's all it is.

4147
02:04:14,931 --> 02:04:17,060
Any criticism that might
be able to come their way,

4148
02:04:17,061 --> 02:04:17,894
my dropdown,

4149
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:18,650
their stock,

4150
02:04:18,650 --> 02:04:20,810
they're all about brand of uncensored.

4151
02:04:20,830 --> 02:04:21,331
Uh,

4152
02:04:21,331 --> 02:04:23,820
on an unrestrained entertained,

4153
02:04:24,210 --> 02:04:29,210
look out with crazy Joel Olsteen doing
his religious show on a fucking channel.

4154
02:04:30,531 --> 02:04:34,550
Now who's that it Joel
Olsteen always O'Steen,

4155
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:34,911
I dunno,

4156
02:04:34,911 --> 02:04:38,190
but they'd been playing commercials
forum nonstop on series.

4157
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:39,040
He's one of these,

4158
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:39,600
uh,

4159
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:43,440
Christian Church guys that get everybody
to put their hands up and big arenas

4160
02:04:43,441 --> 02:04:44,430
and close their eyes.

4161
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:47,310
It's fucking insane.

4162
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:48,361
It's insane.

4163
02:04:48,361 --> 02:04:51,480
And he's now has a show
on Sirius on serious.

4164
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:51,991
And I'm like,

4165
02:04:51,991 --> 02:04:52,660
who?

4166
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:53,910
Why he's a huckster.

4167
02:04:54,060 --> 02:04:54,570
Yes.

4168
02:04:54,570 --> 02:04:55,860
A fucking huckster.

4169
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:59,490
One of those guys stealing money
from people by using this huckster.

4170
02:04:59,491 --> 02:05:00,360
Cause I'm sure the huckster,

4171
02:05:00,370 --> 02:05:00,571
yes.

4172
02:05:00,571 --> 02:05:02,580
For donations of course,

4173
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:03,600
donations,

4174
02:05:03,810 --> 02:05:08,810
arenas full of misguided people with
their hands stretched up to God,

4175
02:05:09,930 --> 02:05:10,830
their eyes closed,

4176
02:05:10,831 --> 02:05:15,360
cry in their eyes out poor kids that
you see standing next to these mutants

4177
02:05:15,361 --> 02:05:16,650
thinking they're fucked.

4178
02:05:16,651 --> 02:05:19,050
They don't even have a
chance to receive Jesus camp.

4179
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:19,800
Oh yeah.

4180
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:24,690
What a great documentary that tastic one
and the woman justifying the fact that

4181
02:05:24,691 --> 02:05:28,680
they're training these kids because in
Islamic countries they're training these

4182
02:05:28,681 --> 02:05:29,940
kids to be jihadists.

4183
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:30,200
Yeah.

4184
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:31,950
So we need to do that with Christians.

4185
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:33,413
Really,

4186
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:34,700
really fun.

4187
02:05:34,701 --> 02:05:35,041
I do.

4188
02:05:35,041 --> 02:05:35,874
We,

4189
02:05:36,090 --> 02:05:39,450
is that the solution we need
Christian suicide bombers.

4190
02:05:39,570 --> 02:05:41,050
I played a clip of a,

4191
02:05:41,290 --> 02:05:46,290
of some church gathering and there was
this guy dressed like one of the dancers

4192
02:05:47,731 --> 02:05:50,970
from the old Lawrence Welk
show and he had two girls,

4193
02:05:50,971 --> 02:05:51,061
uh,

4194
02:05:51,061 --> 02:05:56,061
women next to him similarly dressed
and they were doing this song and dance

4195
02:05:56,761 --> 02:05:57,750
number two,

4196
02:05:57,751 --> 02:06:00,060
like some weird hip hop beat.

4197
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:02,520
And they were white as
fucking white could be.

4198
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:04,290
And it was about Jesus and everything.

4199
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:08,130
And then I play like some
isis videos and I'm like,

4200
02:06:08,131 --> 02:06:08,401
see,

4201
02:06:08,401 --> 02:06:11,970
this is what they're doing
and this is what we're doing.

4202
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:13,260
And I swear to you,

4203
02:06:13,261 --> 02:06:16,740
I don't know what's more
dangerous or horrific to watch.

4204
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:18,193
It was,

4205
02:06:18,540 --> 02:06:21,360
it's like that's our version of,

4206
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:22,980
of extremists.

4207
02:06:23,010 --> 02:06:25,980
Religious extremists is just this,

4208
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:27,540
everything has god.

4209
02:06:27,541 --> 02:06:30,150
You ever hang out with somebody
that that is a born again,

4210
02:06:30,151 --> 02:06:35,070
like completely into God and
Jesus and it's 24 hours a day.

4211
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:39,150
Like I'm into a lot of shit and I'm
really heavy into a lot of shit,

4212
02:06:39,330 --> 02:06:39,860
but,

4213
02:06:39,860 --> 02:06:41,550
but I take a break sometimes.

4214
02:06:42,690 --> 02:06:44,880
I love my radio control helicopters.

4215
02:06:44,881 --> 02:06:46,380
You love Beavis by love.

4216
02:06:46,381 --> 02:06:49,590
Beavis and we talked about
little beav and stuff like guns.

4217
02:06:49,591 --> 02:06:50,730
I love guns,

4218
02:06:51,150 --> 02:06:52,440
but you know what,

4219
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:54,420
it's not 24 hours a day,

4220
02:06:54,421 --> 02:06:55,290
but you hang out with it.

4221
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:57,660
That's why you can't hang
out with people like that.

4222
02:06:57,690 --> 02:06:58,620
You'd like to think like,

4223
02:06:58,740 --> 02:06:58,911
hey,

4224
02:06:58,911 --> 02:06:59,850
he's got his beliefs.

4225
02:06:59,851 --> 02:06:59,961
I,

4226
02:06:59,961 --> 02:07:00,870
I'm cool with that.

4227
02:07:00,871 --> 02:07:01,681
We'll hang out,

4228
02:07:01,681 --> 02:07:02,940
play some cards and stuff.

4229
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:06,590
Jesus would have fucking
folded a jack and eight.

4230
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,500
Have you ever seen June two diesel?

4231
02:07:10,530 --> 02:07:12,630
Jim Covey's Ligo played
the passion of the Christ.

4232
02:07:12,631 --> 02:07:13,470
He played Jesus.

4233
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:14,100
Oh Wow.

4234
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:16,440
He's fucking all in.

4235
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:17,330
All is,

4236
02:07:17,330 --> 02:07:18,050
hey Jesus,

4237
02:07:18,050 --> 02:07:20,610
what's he [inaudible] the movie do it.

4238
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:21,270
I don't know.

4239
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:23,100
That was part of the
other one or the other.

4240
02:07:23,130 --> 02:07:25,950
I may might've been
before and is more so now.

4241
02:07:25,951 --> 02:07:29,970
But he does these interviews with these
religious shows and start talking about

4242
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:32,700
how it hurt him in Hollywood,

4243
02:07:32,701 --> 02:07:35,830
has religious beliefs and his belief
in Jesus and his belief in God.

4244
02:07:35,831 --> 02:07:36,290
Like,

4245
02:07:36,290 --> 02:07:36,431
no,

4246
02:07:36,431 --> 02:07:36,521
no,

4247
02:07:36,521 --> 02:07:36,940
no,

4248
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:37,660
this hurt you.

4249
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:38,800
This right here,

4250
02:07:38,801 --> 02:07:39,250
what you do,

4251
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:40,360
you're on a show,

4252
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:45,640
a wacky Jesus show and you're talking
about the impending apocalypse who talking

4253
02:07:45,641 --> 02:07:47,350
about like Armageddon.

4254
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:47,850
And,

4255
02:07:47,850 --> 02:07:48,621
and the,

4256
02:07:48,621 --> 02:07:49,271
the fucking,

4257
02:07:49,271 --> 02:07:50,110
the reckoning,

4258
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:52,510
the my favorite though this uh,

4259
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:57,540
in this day and age now
and it's relatively new for
the religious community is

4260
02:07:57,731 --> 02:07:59,380
the people and dinosaurs.

4261
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:01,600
That is my favorite thing.

4262
02:08:01,630 --> 02:08:04,540
Do you know Sarah Palin
said when she was running,

4263
02:08:04,630 --> 02:08:05,411
she was in Alaska.

4264
02:08:05,411 --> 02:08:09,130
She told the school teacher up there
that dinosaurs and people lived together.

4265
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:09,340
Yeah.

4266
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:12,580
And that she saw a photo on the Internet
have a footprint of human footprint

4267
02:08:12,581 --> 02:08:13,900
inside of dinosaur footprint.

4268
02:08:13,930 --> 02:08:14,620
Ah,

4269
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:15,453
that's nice.

4270
02:08:15,610 --> 02:08:18,970
And then the human and
the human said dinosaur.

4271
02:08:18,971 --> 02:08:22,730
Why did you abandon me during the my
most needful times and the dinosaur?

4272
02:08:22,731 --> 02:08:23,051
I said,

4273
02:08:23,051 --> 02:08:23,261
no,

4274
02:08:23,261 --> 02:08:25,930
that's when I was carrying you footprint.

4275
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:27,610
Dinosaur footprints in the sand.

4276
02:08:28,270 --> 02:08:31,180
Hashtag dinosaur footprints
side friends has,

4277
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:34,150
has there been any pests though
that have seen this hook?

4278
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:36,280
A street meat or lady that uh,

4279
02:08:36,370 --> 02:08:37,900
or any officers that go,

4280
02:08:37,901 --> 02:08:38,170
you know what,

4281
02:08:38,170 --> 02:08:41,350
it looks like a girl we arrested
a couple of weeks ago or nothing.

4282
02:08:41,351 --> 02:08:41,491
No,

4283
02:08:41,491 --> 02:08:41,981
nothing.

4284
02:08:41,981 --> 02:08:44,110
She valence footage or nothing.

4285
02:08:44,140 --> 02:08:45,010
People have said to me,

4286
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:48,550
I'm so surprising she hasn't come forward
and tried to get something from this

4287
02:08:48,551 --> 02:08:48,911
or anything.

4288
02:08:48,911 --> 02:08:49,051
And,

4289
02:08:49,051 --> 02:08:49,900
and I just,

4290
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:51,970
I know she knows nothing.

4291
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:54,460
She has no clue what she has wrought.

4292
02:08:54,870 --> 02:08:55,300
Uh,

4293
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:55,850
she,

4294
02:08:55,850 --> 02:09:00,790
she's just some fucking dumb hooker
who knows nothing about the news,

4295
02:09:00,791 --> 02:09:02,920
knows nothing about what's
going on in the world.

4296
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:05,040
She knows money and Dick,

4297
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:06,450
that's it.

4298
02:09:06,450 --> 02:09:10,900
You know her corner now and her time that
she works at and I would move around.

4299
02:09:10,930 --> 02:09:11,763
You might be dead.

4300
02:09:11,950 --> 02:09:12,970
She might be dead,

4301
02:09:13,590 --> 02:09:14,110
you know,

4302
02:09:14,110 --> 02:09:14,520
whatever.

4303
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:15,353
Don't last long.

4304
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:16,601
Maybe some home.

4305
02:09:16,601 --> 02:09:17,530
He shot her in the face.

4306
02:09:20,290 --> 02:09:21,220
You're getting fired again.

4307
02:09:21,221 --> 02:09:22,360
Now I know.

4308
02:09:22,361 --> 02:09:24,280
Fire yourself of that fire myself.

4309
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:25,690
I was saying when a,

4310
02:09:25,700 --> 02:09:26,620
I'm never,

4311
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:28,570
since it's my own show now,

4312
02:09:28,750 --> 02:09:29,800
the Anthony Kamia show,

4313
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:31,660
I'm never taking vacation.

4314
02:09:31,690 --> 02:09:35,560
I'm going to say something so outrageous
and then suspend myself for a week.

4315
02:09:36,030 --> 02:09:37,180
That way I can go away,

4316
02:09:37,181 --> 02:09:39,220
come back and go fucking boss

4317
02:09:41,020 --> 02:09:41,853
asshole.

4318
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:45,550
Do you have any desire to try
to go back with opie and Jimmy?

4319
02:09:45,551 --> 02:09:49,360
Do you try to talk to them until like
your sweet side of the woods that you're

4320
02:09:49,361 --> 02:09:49,630
in now?

4321
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:50,351
Well when,

4322
02:09:50,351 --> 02:09:51,160
uh,

4323
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:56,160
when they were still working
out a contract because
they're contract went until

4324
02:09:57,281 --> 02:09:58,114
October,

4325
02:09:58,210 --> 02:09:59,620
which they just resigned.

4326
02:09:59,650 --> 02:10:00,220
So they did,

4327
02:10:00,220 --> 02:10:01,120
they did resign,

4328
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:02,740
but I got fired in July.

4329
02:10:02,770 --> 02:10:04,090
So from July to October,

4330
02:10:04,091 --> 02:10:05,230
there was a lot of speculation.

4331
02:10:05,231 --> 02:10:07,120
What's going to happen in
October when the contract's up?

4332
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:08,133
Are they going resign?

4333
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:08,831
Those two?

4334
02:10:08,831 --> 02:10:10,090
Are they going to bring Anthony Back?

4335
02:10:10,110 --> 02:10:11,950
Are they just going to tell
everyone to go fuck themselves?

4336
02:10:12,240 --> 02:10:12,880
Um,

4337
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:14,270
and Jimmy and,

4338
02:10:14,271 --> 02:10:14,951
and Oop,

4339
02:10:14,951 --> 02:10:15,970
we're under contract.

4340
02:10:15,971 --> 02:10:17,110
So they couldn't just leave.

4341
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:18,400
That's a fucking breach.

4342
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:18,860
Right.

4343
02:10:18,860 --> 02:10:19,270
Uh,

4344
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:21,070
they couldn't just leave
because I was fired.

4345
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:22,353
Um,

4346
02:10:23,230 --> 02:10:24,550
but they did resign.

4347
02:10:24,551 --> 02:10:25,384
I think they,

4348
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:27,760
they squeeze more money out of him.

4349
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:30,700
I think it was very easy to take my money.

4350
02:10:31,270 --> 02:10:32,890
You could take half of my money.

4351
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:33,531
Right.

4352
02:10:33,531 --> 02:10:35,030
Do you ever eat that up into,

4353
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:36,920
give it to Jimmy and Oop,

4354
02:10:37,190 --> 02:10:38,570
now they pocket the rest.

4355
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:39,330
They,

4356
02:10:39,330 --> 02:10:40,071
Jimmy and I'll be like,

4357
02:10:40,071 --> 02:10:40,251
hey,

4358
02:10:40,251 --> 02:10:43,590
we got a raise and the
show's fucking money air.

4359
02:10:44,020 --> 02:10:44,540
Right.

4360
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:44,871
So,

4361
02:10:44,871 --> 02:10:45,260
you know,

4362
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:47,150
I don't fault them for it at all,

4363
02:10:47,330 --> 02:10:49,820
but I wasn't sure what was
going to happen in October.

4364
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:51,320
And that's why I,

4365
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:56,590
I was so adamant about getting this
up and running so fast as was Keith.

4366
02:10:56,870 --> 02:10:59,180
I was mourning on the couch for like two,

4367
02:10:59,181 --> 02:11:01,070
three days after I was fired.

4368
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:01,431
I'm like,

4369
02:11:01,431 --> 02:11:02,264
fuck,

4370
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:03,200
oh fuck,

4371
02:11:03,201 --> 02:11:04,010
fuck.

4372
02:11:04,010 --> 02:11:05,240
Keith comes over and he's like,

4373
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:07,280
that's all you got to fucking
studio in your basement.

4374
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:08,360
It's so true.

4375
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:09,193
Chop Chop.

4376
02:11:09,290 --> 02:11:10,880
You already had it set up.

4377
02:11:11,090 --> 02:11:15,470
I was the crazy guy that was building
the bomb shelter that all the neighbors

4378
02:11:15,471 --> 02:11:19,250
pointed and laughed at that are banging
on the door when the bombs are dropping.

4379
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:20,350
Hey,

4380
02:11:20,350 --> 02:11:23,960
let us have you thought about doing
something in Manhattan though?

4381
02:11:24,020 --> 02:11:26,210
Because it's probably tough to get
people to come out to long island.

4382
02:11:26,230 --> 02:11:28,190
It is tougher to get
people out on long island.

4383
02:11:28,191 --> 02:11:28,821
We've had two,

4384
02:11:28,821 --> 02:11:29,570
uh,

4385
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:30,860
is sent cars for people,

4386
02:11:30,861 --> 02:11:31,491
but I've had,

4387
02:11:31,491 --> 02:11:33,680
I've had a few pretty fun guests.

4388
02:11:33,681 --> 02:11:35,300
Andrew dice clay came out.

4389
02:11:35,350 --> 02:11:36,200
Oh,

4390
02:11:36,470 --> 02:11:36,651
what?

4391
02:11:36,651 --> 02:11:37,550
His whole family,

4392
02:11:37,580 --> 02:11:38,770
big fat fucking,

4393
02:11:42,290 --> 02:11:42,561
he,

4394
02:11:42,561 --> 02:11:43,070
uh,

4395
02:11:43,070 --> 02:11:45,560
and he demanded a super stretch limo.

4396
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:47,420
He demand like it was the 80s.

4397
02:11:47,850 --> 02:11:49,400
They cost does that anymore?

4398
02:11:49,401 --> 02:11:49,870
You're going to say.

4399
02:11:49,870 --> 02:11:52,790
So I guess for a black one,

4400
02:11:52,940 --> 02:11:56,120
I want the sunroof so I could
poke out like the kid in big

4401
02:11:58,970 --> 02:12:02,650
fucking that is a genius daisy.

4402
02:12:03,210 --> 02:12:04,043
Nice.

4403
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:07,010
He came over with his whole
family and we did the,

4404
02:12:07,020 --> 02:12:11,600
the good thing about this is it's my
fucking house and I could put the cameras

4405
02:12:11,601 --> 02:12:12,051
anywhere.

4406
02:12:12,051 --> 02:12:13,310
So I set the cameras up,

4407
02:12:13,450 --> 02:12:13,700
uh,

4408
02:12:13,700 --> 02:12:17,180
at the back table by the pool and
we did the whole interview outside.

4409
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:19,970
I got some really hot girl to tend bar.

4410
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:23,060
We had a little rollout bar by the
pool and she just kept coming over and

4411
02:12:23,061 --> 02:12:24,980
serving drinks and stuff like that.

4412
02:12:24,981 --> 02:12:26,720
And it was just a fun,

4413
02:12:26,750 --> 02:12:31,490
real relaxed hang the little waterfall
of the pool and everything made a really

4414
02:12:31,491 --> 02:12:32,840
cool atmosphere.

4415
02:12:33,110 --> 02:12:34,220
And then Colin Quinn,

4416
02:12:34,221 --> 02:12:35,900
I had him over and uh,

4417
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:38,660
I set the cameras up by the
bar that I got in the house.

4418
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:41,510
So we were just sitting there
at the bar and it wasn't like,

4419
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:44,450
it doesn't have to be in
the studio is what it is.

4420
02:12:44,670 --> 02:12:45,503
Um,

4421
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:46,630
I want to,

4422
02:12:46,630 --> 02:12:48,710
I have Kevin Pollak come in at some point,

4423
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:49,550
um,

4424
02:12:49,550 --> 02:12:54,550
and do that from the movie theater and
play like an old Colombo episode and

4425
02:12:54,681 --> 02:12:55,401
we'll just talk.

4426
02:12:55,401 --> 02:12:58,370
And then every so often refer
to the show and you know,

4427
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:00,320
cause he does an amazing Colombo.

4428
02:13:00,321 --> 02:13:01,250
It's hilarious.

4429
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:02,690
And just fuck around like that.

4430
02:13:03,020 --> 02:13:05,510
My whole house has become location.

4431
02:13:05,930 --> 02:13:06,800
You do it anywhere.

4432
02:13:07,130 --> 02:13:08,480
The camera's are they remote?

4433
02:13:08,510 --> 02:13:13,510
Like how does big fucking expensive
cameras and I have a lines that I just run

4434
02:13:15,771 --> 02:13:18,020
down to the tri caster in the studio.

4435
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:19,180
I runned.

4436
02:13:19,180 --> 02:13:20,150
They're not portable.

4437
02:13:20,450 --> 02:13:21,090
Why did you go?

4438
02:13:21,090 --> 02:13:23,540
We were actually talking about wireless,

4439
02:13:23,541 --> 02:13:26,930
high def high def photos
or high def video.

4440
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:27,200
Yeah,

4441
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:27,751
but you,

4442
02:13:27,751 --> 02:13:29,060
you prefer the tri caster.

4443
02:13:29,061 --> 02:13:30,140
You think that's the way to go?

4444
02:13:30,350 --> 02:13:31,350
The one I have,

4445
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:32,160
uh,

4446
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:33,720
I'm pretty satisfied with it.

4447
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:35,550
I'm always looking into something,

4448
02:13:35,730 --> 02:13:36,301
see what it is.

4449
02:13:36,301 --> 02:13:37,290
But I like the control.

4450
02:13:37,291 --> 02:13:41,310
I like the fact that I could roll
video and audio and it's very easy,

4451
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:42,150
um,

4452
02:13:42,150 --> 02:13:43,790
integrates well with the,

4453
02:13:43,910 --> 02:13:45,060
my computers and stuff.

4454
02:13:45,061 --> 02:13:46,020
So yeah,

4455
02:13:46,050 --> 02:13:46,890
I kinda like it.

4456
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:51,600
So you run it down to the tri caster in
someone else's working it down in the

4457
02:13:51,601 --> 02:13:55,440
basement where the studio is and then
you have the cameras are just operated on

4458
02:13:55,441 --> 02:13:56,460
long cords.

4459
02:13:56,640 --> 02:13:57,000
Yeah,

4460
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:57,630
yeah.

4461
02:13:57,630 --> 02:13:57,841
I've,

4462
02:13:57,841 --> 02:13:58,651
I've run them right out,

4463
02:13:58,651 --> 02:13:58,891
you know,

4464
02:13:58,891 --> 02:13:59,341
through my,

4465
02:13:59,341 --> 02:13:59,790
uh,

4466
02:13:59,790 --> 02:14:00,110
uh,

4467
02:14:00,110 --> 02:14:04,240
my oil burner closet out
the vent in the back yard.

4468
02:14:04,290 --> 02:14:05,280
But we're having a,

4469
02:14:05,281 --> 02:14:09,030
the whole thing set up
where I have sockets where I
could plug them in and then

4470
02:14:09,380 --> 02:14:10,290
we'd go outside,

4471
02:14:10,291 --> 02:14:12,140
there'll be a little bay
where I could pop all my,

4472
02:14:12,150 --> 02:14:12,660
uh,

4473
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:15,150
uh Jackson and get everything done.

4474
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:15,850
Mike.

4475
02:14:15,850 --> 02:14:16,683
Nice.

4476
02:14:16,720 --> 02:14:17,130
Yeah.

4477
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:18,270
So I could put it anywhere,

4478
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:20,790
but I am going to get a wireless also,

4479
02:14:20,791 --> 02:14:21,451
so it will,

4480
02:14:21,451 --> 02:14:21,900
uh,

4481
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:25,650
put the video signal wirelessly so I
could do something from the Jacuzzi and

4482
02:14:25,651 --> 02:14:26,191
shit like that.

4483
02:14:26,191 --> 02:14:27,024
Cause we're having a,

4484
02:14:27,230 --> 02:14:29,370
having a Laneys bring in one of our,

4485
02:14:29,371 --> 02:14:29,490
uh,

4486
02:14:29,490 --> 02:14:30,360
porn stars.

4487
02:14:30,470 --> 02:14:31,300
Oh,

4488
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:32,730
so yeah.

4489
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:37,290
So we're gonna I want to do it naked
from the fucking Jacuzzi naked.

4490
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:41,520
I want to just fucking turn
on some bubbles so we could
keep it family friendly

4491
02:14:41,521 --> 02:14:43,170
sorta except for her tits.

4492
02:14:43,171 --> 02:14:44,400
Just sticking out there.

4493
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:47,401
And then,

4494
02:14:47,401 --> 02:14:47,611
uh,

4495
02:14:47,611 --> 02:14:47,851
you know,

4496
02:14:47,851 --> 02:14:48,684
do it like that.

4497
02:14:48,930 --> 02:14:49,500
How do you,

4498
02:14:49,500 --> 02:14:50,550
what do you stream it with,

4499
02:14:50,551 --> 02:14:51,590
with service to use?

4500
02:14:51,680 --> 02:14:51,900
Uh,

4501
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:56,900
it goes through live stream but then it
also then goes to a service that we have

4502
02:14:57,420 --> 02:14:58,230
set up with the,

4503
02:14:58,230 --> 02:14:59,640
some guys down in like Tennessee.

4504
02:14:59,641 --> 02:15:00,241
It's very,

4505
02:15:00,241 --> 02:15:01,530
very crazy.

4506
02:15:01,860 --> 02:15:02,160
It,

4507
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:06,270
the logistics of this was the hardest
part cause I already had the studio built

4508
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:07,313
pretty much.

4509
02:15:07,410 --> 02:15:11,040
It was weird cause it was a trial and
error over the course of years that I'd

4510
02:15:11,041 --> 02:15:11,761
been building this.

4511
02:15:11,761 --> 02:15:12,360
So I,

4512
02:15:12,360 --> 02:15:13,710
I usually set something up,

4513
02:15:13,711 --> 02:15:15,360
it worked or I wanted something better.

4514
02:15:15,361 --> 02:15:16,140
I'm like fuck,

4515
02:15:16,140 --> 02:15:16,980
rip that out.

4516
02:15:16,981 --> 02:15:18,030
Put something else in.

4517
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:21,600
And I was constantly building it and it
just looked like linguine all over the

4518
02:15:21,601 --> 02:15:22,030
floor,

4519
02:15:22,030 --> 02:15:22,950
wires everywhere.

4520
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:23,671
And then,

4521
02:15:23,671 --> 02:15:24,120
uh,

4522
02:15:24,120 --> 02:15:25,260
when we got this rolling,

4523
02:15:25,261 --> 02:15:28,890
we got some tech guys in there to kind
of rip it apart and put it back together

4524
02:15:28,891 --> 02:15:30,330
again the way it's supposed to be.

4525
02:15:30,700 --> 02:15:30,900
A,

4526
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:31,621
but for the most part,

4527
02:15:31,621 --> 02:15:33,900
everything was already
there except for that,

4528
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:34,291
you know,

4529
02:15:34,291 --> 02:15:37,840
we could do the show now we've got to
get it out to the masses and it's there.

4530
02:15:37,841 --> 02:15:41,100
We're going to be a lot of people
that needed to get this immediately.

4531
02:15:41,460 --> 02:15:41,670
Uh,

4532
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:44,100
so we didn't want crash
issues and things like that.

4533
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:47,940
Are you having a hard time growing
it because it's a pay service?

4534
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:48,471
It,

4535
02:15:48,471 --> 02:15:50,280
cause I'm sure you've got an initial rush.

4536
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:50,521
Right,

4537
02:15:50,521 --> 02:15:50,761
right,

4538
02:15:50,761 --> 02:15:51,120
right.

4539
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:54,630
You get that initial rush and then
it's constantly growing though.

4540
02:15:54,660 --> 02:15:54,991
It's,

4541
02:15:54,991 --> 02:15:56,360
it's initially it,

4542
02:15:56,420 --> 02:15:57,840
it really took off,

4543
02:15:58,160 --> 02:15:58,993
um,

4544
02:15:59,130 --> 02:16:03,090
got a lot of subscribers and I needed
to do a subscriber based show because I

4545
02:16:03,091 --> 02:16:03,720
knew,

4546
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:04,950
I knew I had an audience.

4547
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:06,330
I was keeping a cheap enough,

4548
02:16:06,331 --> 02:16:08,250
I wasn't going to charge
people a lot of money.

4549
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:08,740
Um,

4550
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:09,030
for,

4551
02:16:09,030 --> 02:16:09,863
for the show.

4552
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:12,540
What did you like six bucks a month
or something like seven bucks a month?

4553
02:16:12,570 --> 02:16:13,290
Uh,

4554
02:16:13,290 --> 02:16:14,640
and then if you do six months,

4555
02:16:14,641 --> 02:16:15,960
it goes down to like $6,

4556
02:16:15,961 --> 02:16:18,300
and then a year it's
like five bucks a month.

4557
02:16:18,570 --> 02:16:19,050
So,

4558
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:19,291
uh,

4559
02:16:19,291 --> 02:16:19,621
it's,

4560
02:16:19,621 --> 02:16:20,450
it's relatively cheap.

4561
02:16:20,450 --> 02:16:21,510
I think 60 bucks a year,

4562
02:16:21,540 --> 02:16:23,670
it's like 48 cents an episode.

4563
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:24,690
Um,

4564
02:16:24,690 --> 02:16:26,940
and those pork little African kids,

4565
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:28,410
that takes like 50,

4566
02:16:28,470 --> 02:16:31,870
so it's cheaper than feeding
starving African children.

4567
02:16:32,550 --> 02:16:33,790
So get right it,

4568
02:16:33,850 --> 02:16:35,230
that's my slogan by the way.

4569
02:16:36,430 --> 02:16:39,130
That's my slogan how it is rude.

4570
02:16:39,310 --> 02:16:39,730
Uh,

4571
02:16:39,730 --> 02:16:40,563
but

4572
02:16:44,090 --> 02:16:46,600
I kept the cost low and um,

4573
02:16:47,220 --> 02:16:47,920
Eh,

4574
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:49,120
and happy with the growth.

4575
02:16:49,150 --> 02:16:49,930
It's growing well.

4576
02:16:49,930 --> 02:16:50,351
Yes.

4577
02:16:50,351 --> 02:16:50,810
Yeah.

4578
02:16:50,810 --> 02:16:51,011
I'm,

4579
02:16:51,011 --> 02:16:52,930
I'm very happy with the way things,

4580
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,190
it's like I would love,

4581
02:16:54,191 --> 02:16:54,670
you know,

4582
02:16:54,670 --> 02:16:55,001
hey,

4583
02:16:55,001 --> 02:16:58,300
here's another fucking
hundred thousand people.

4584
02:16:58,301 --> 02:17:00,250
Let's get them all on board right now.

4585
02:17:00,390 --> 02:17:00,760
Uh,

4586
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:04,000
but it takes time after
you get that initial boost.

4587
02:17:04,001 --> 02:17:08,170
What made you decide to go subscription
base instead of decide to have

4588
02:17:08,171 --> 02:17:09,004
advertisers?

4589
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:10,060
Uh,

4590
02:17:10,060 --> 02:17:10,331
well,

4591
02:17:10,331 --> 02:17:13,540
I'm kind of doing both
because I'm a greedy fuck.

4592
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:14,913
So I do,

4593
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:17,500
I do reads during the show,

4594
02:17:17,710 --> 02:17:19,360
I have a few live reads,

4595
02:17:19,730 --> 02:17:20,560
um,

4596
02:17:20,560 --> 02:17:21,670
just a couple actually.

4597
02:17:21,730 --> 02:17:25,120
And then we have other ways that
we're advertising on the website.

4598
02:17:25,121 --> 02:17:26,980
And things like that that aren't quite,

4599
02:17:27,430 --> 02:17:28,263
um,

4600
02:17:28,390 --> 02:17:29,223
live reads.

4601
02:17:29,260 --> 02:17:33,010
But we also have the ability with the
video to pop up those intrusive little

4602
02:17:33,011 --> 02:17:35,200
things like you see on TBS coming up.

4603
02:17:35,201 --> 02:17:37,570
Seinfeld like those can be sold.

4604
02:17:37,780 --> 02:17:38,613
Um,

4605
02:17:39,310 --> 02:17:43,030
the video screen behind me with a logo
and the great thing that the advertisers

4606
02:17:43,031 --> 02:17:47,320
like is they could send videos of their
stuff over and play it as I'm doing the

4607
02:17:47,321 --> 02:17:48,154
read.

4608
02:17:48,220 --> 02:17:50,410
And most of them don't care what I do.

4609
02:17:50,620 --> 02:17:51,101
So,

4610
02:17:51,101 --> 02:17:51,490
uh,

4611
02:17:51,490 --> 02:17:52,330
we had this guy,

4612
02:17:52,331 --> 02:17:54,280
we got this Guy Dale Bond Danza,

4613
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:56,970
he does this a Dale
Bond Danza dot comedies,

4614
02:17:56,980 --> 02:18:01,250
this former fat guy that got skinny
and he calls himself a former fat fuck.

4615
02:18:01,250 --> 02:18:01,930
And,

4616
02:18:01,930 --> 02:18:02,391
but I,

4617
02:18:02,391 --> 02:18:03,520
I just decided to,

4618
02:18:03,521 --> 02:18:03,800
you know,

4619
02:18:03,800 --> 02:18:08,800
he's Dale Bong Danza it's an extremity
things based on the old Tony Danza bit

4620
02:18:10,030 --> 02:18:10,870
from years ago.

4621
02:18:10,990 --> 02:18:11,890
And he loves it.

4622
02:18:11,891 --> 02:18:12,724
Like they just,

4623
02:18:12,850 --> 02:18:15,640
the advertisers know and
I'm not tied to them.

4624
02:18:15,910 --> 02:18:18,220
They know if the I do
something they don't like that,

4625
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:18,761
I could just say,

4626
02:18:18,761 --> 02:18:22,390
well later I forgot about
that Tony Danza bit.

4627
02:18:22,450 --> 02:18:24,580
Oh God fucking killed me.

4628
02:18:24,581 --> 02:18:27,690
Once you had this v there was a,

4629
02:18:27,691 --> 02:18:32,340
an audio rather have this old lady
who was in love with Tony Danza.

4630
02:18:32,341 --> 02:18:32,800
Yes.

4631
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:35,070
And you were talking about
getting her into the green room.

4632
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:38,710
She was online for the Tony Dan's a
talk show that was on for a week or two.

4633
02:18:39,130 --> 02:18:39,963
And uh,

4634
02:18:40,090 --> 02:18:44,560
and she was online waiting outside
at one of the studios in Manhattan.

4635
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:47,300
And Iraq went down with a phone call,

4636
02:18:47,301 --> 02:18:48,730
drop us and said it was,

4637
02:18:48,930 --> 02:18:49,900
she went down the line,

4638
02:18:49,901 --> 02:18:50,051
said,

4639
02:18:50,051 --> 02:18:51,130
you want to talk to Tony?

4640
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:51,911
And they were like,

4641
02:18:51,911 --> 02:18:52,331
yeah,

4642
02:18:52,331 --> 02:18:52,900
yeah.

4643
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:55,150
So he hands her the phone and I was like,

4644
02:18:55,151 --> 02:18:56,080
well this is Tony,

4645
02:18:56,081 --> 02:18:57,160
how are you doing?

4646
02:18:57,630 --> 02:18:58,140
And,

4647
02:18:58,140 --> 02:19:02,650
and she thought it was Tony Danza and the
conversation got worse and worse as it

4648
02:19:02,651 --> 02:19:03,310
went along.

4649
02:19:03,310 --> 02:19:04,330
So you enjoy the show.

4650
02:19:04,331 --> 02:19:07,360
Did you like me on taxi
and things like that.

4651
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:08,710
And then it started being like,

4652
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:09,011
well,

4653
02:19:09,011 --> 02:19:10,750
I could use some relaxation in the,

4654
02:19:10,751 --> 02:19:11,050
uh,

4655
02:19:11,050 --> 02:19:12,070
in my dressing room.

4656
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:14,140
How about you come back
when you come in and,

4657
02:19:14,530 --> 02:19:14,770
you know,

4658
02:19:14,770 --> 02:19:17,890
maybe you'd give Tony a massage
and she's laughing like,

4659
02:19:17,891 --> 02:19:18,101
all,

4660
02:19:18,101 --> 02:19:19,060
I would do that.

4661
02:19:19,180 --> 02:19:20,530
And then it got to the
point where it's like,

4662
02:19:20,650 --> 02:19:20,931
you know,

4663
02:19:20,931 --> 02:19:23,980
I could use a hand job
was something and she,

4664
02:19:24,010 --> 02:19:25,240
they never broke.

4665
02:19:25,390 --> 02:19:25,961
They were always like,

4666
02:19:25,961 --> 02:19:27,180
oh,

4667
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:28,340
like it was they,

4668
02:19:28,430 --> 02:19:29,041
they sewed,

4669
02:19:29,041 --> 02:19:31,040
didn't want to be disillusioned,

4670
02:19:31,041 --> 02:19:34,400
but there their celebrity crush.

4671
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:37,730
It doesn't want to just went with
her think that he was a perv.

4672
02:19:37,730 --> 02:19:40,130
Did they ever find out that it was jus uh,

4673
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:40,521
no.

4674
02:19:40,521 --> 02:19:41,354
Not those people.

4675
02:19:41,720 --> 02:19:45,740
The people at the Tony Danza
show did and what did they do?

4676
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:50,030
They started having security walk the
line and Iraq picking rocks picture was

4677
02:19:50,031 --> 02:19:50,864
put up,

4678
02:19:52,170 --> 02:19:56,570
did do not let this man near
the people coming in about that.

4679
02:19:56,571 --> 02:19:59,420
That was one of the funniest fucking
things I ever heard on the radio.

4680
02:19:59,421 --> 02:20:01,250
That was a good one park.

4681
02:20:01,340 --> 02:20:04,100
I parked somewhere and I was crying,

4682
02:20:04,101 --> 02:20:07,040
laughing and I had to go inside for a
meeting and I sat in my car for like an

4683
02:20:07,041 --> 02:20:08,700
extra 10 minutes just listening to that.

4684
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:09,643
Yeah.

4685
02:20:09,890 --> 02:20:11,720
There was one point where
I said something and,

4686
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:14,120
and everyone knew what the
next line with and I was like,

4687
02:20:14,300 --> 02:20:14,601
oh,

4688
02:20:14,601 --> 02:20:15,081
hold on.

4689
02:20:15,081 --> 02:20:15,950
IATSE kids.

4690
02:20:15,951 --> 02:20:16,790
Here it comes

4691
02:20:19,190 --> 02:20:20,270
all the listeners like,

4692
02:20:20,271 --> 02:20:20,631
yes,

4693
02:20:20,631 --> 02:20:21,590
we know it's,

4694
02:20:22,970 --> 02:20:27,970
that was some funny shit we used
to be and that's what XM was.

4695
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:31,490
We were at Xm radio with
that when the merger

4696
02:20:33,170 --> 02:20:34,340
merger happened.

4697
02:20:34,341 --> 02:20:37,400
That's like when you remember
when Germany merged with Poland?

4698
02:20:39,190 --> 02:20:39,650
Yeah,

4699
02:20:39,650 --> 02:20:42,620
the merger happened with a serious,

4700
02:20:42,650 --> 02:20:45,050
they completely took over and did,

4701
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:45,350
uh,

4702
02:20:45,350 --> 02:20:50,350
did away with all the people at Xm that
were show friendly and things like that

4703
02:20:50,421 --> 02:20:50,740
and,

4704
02:20:50,740 --> 02:20:55,610
and just put us in their building instead
of the building we were in where we

4705
02:20:55,611 --> 02:20:58,910
were able to go out in the
street and just do fun shit.

4706
02:20:58,911 --> 02:21:03,290
We did box a Cox that day
where we put up a box,

4707
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:08,920
we lined it with a gay porn
and just dildos in it and
fake rubber dicks and then

4708
02:21:10,551 --> 02:21:14,900
we close the box and put a free kittens,

4709
02:21:14,901 --> 02:21:15,800
please take,

4710
02:21:15,801 --> 02:21:18,110
give them a home and left it
in the middle of the sidewalk.

4711
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:19,551
And then we were just,

4712
02:21:19,551 --> 02:21:20,870
and we didn't even have a video.

4713
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:21,440
We were,

4714
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:22,910
we just had audio of like,

4715
02:21:22,911 --> 02:21:24,440
I think Danny was down on the street.

4716
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:25,161
We were upstairs.

4717
02:21:25,161 --> 02:21:28,730
We were watching out the window watching
people walk by going all she's looking

4718
02:21:28,731 --> 02:21:28,881
at,

4719
02:21:28,881 --> 02:21:32,120
she's looking at the box and then they'd
open the boss see of kittens are in

4720
02:21:32,121 --> 02:21:33,620
there and the reaction was hilarious

4721
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:36,680
and we were doing this on radio.

4722
02:21:36,681 --> 02:21:40,370
It wasn't even a video to it and we were
just describing it in the fact that we

4723
02:21:40,371 --> 02:21:41,600
were laughing so hard.

4724
02:21:41,601 --> 02:21:45,950
People really could kind of get what
was happening and they just stopped all

4725
02:21:45,951 --> 02:21:46,781
that with serious.

4726
02:21:46,781 --> 02:21:49,940
So it kind of conversations did they have
with you guys as far as like what you

4727
02:21:49,941 --> 02:21:52,040
could and couldn't get
away with that was just it.

4728
02:21:52,070 --> 02:21:52,820
Nothing.

4729
02:21:52,820 --> 02:21:55,940
They never had conversations
with us when we would ask.

4730
02:21:56,180 --> 02:21:58,130
It was always this weird.

4731
02:21:58,280 --> 02:22:03,230
They point to the ceiling and talk
about the people upstairs and be like,

4732
02:22:03,231 --> 02:22:03,441
yeah,

4733
02:22:03,441 --> 02:22:04,011
well you know,

4734
02:22:04,011 --> 02:22:05,570
they think and I'm like,

4735
02:22:05,660 --> 02:22:07,580
who the fuck are you pointing at?

4736
02:22:07,790 --> 02:22:09,050
Like I want to name,

4737
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:10,850
I want someone to talk to and say,

4738
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,470
how can we do this?

4739
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:14,060
Not that we can't do something,

4740
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:15,950
please work with us and say,

4741
02:22:15,951 --> 02:22:17,120
how can we do it?

4742
02:22:17,180 --> 02:22:18,013
Maybe?

4743
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:18,471
Well,

4744
02:22:18,471 --> 02:22:19,050
we got to,

4745
02:22:19,050 --> 02:22:19,401
you know,

4746
02:22:19,401 --> 02:22:22,820
run it through up the old flag pole
and run it through this and we'll,

4747
02:22:22,850 --> 02:22:27,850
we'll greenlight that as we skylight
this and get just middle management

4748
02:22:28,471 --> 02:22:32,310
bullshit that would shine us on every day.

4749
02:22:32,490 --> 02:22:35,220
And we'd realize months and
months would go by and we go,

4750
02:22:35,340 --> 02:22:35,521
you know,

4751
02:22:35,521 --> 02:22:36,540
we haven't done anything.

4752
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:38,430
We haven't gone out to do an appearance.

4753
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:39,870
We haven't done a poker tournament.

4754
02:22:39,871 --> 02:22:40,350
We haven't,

4755
02:22:40,350 --> 02:22:41,520
we want it to do a cruise.

4756
02:22:41,521 --> 02:22:45,180
We want to do a big O and a
cruiser promoted a year in advance,

4757
02:22:45,330 --> 02:22:49,940
a cruise ship with all the comics
and fans and fucking Q and A's and,

4758
02:22:49,941 --> 02:22:51,570
and shit on stage at,

4759
02:22:51,660 --> 02:22:52,650
on a cruise ship.

4760
02:22:52,980 --> 02:22:55,080
5,000 fucking people and,

4761
02:22:55,170 --> 02:22:55,771
and do that.

4762
02:22:55,771 --> 02:22:57,660
And serious came up to us and said,

4763
02:22:58,500 --> 02:22:58,681
yeah,

4764
02:22:58,681 --> 02:22:59,430
that's great.

4765
02:22:59,430 --> 02:23:03,630
We want $1 million up front
to allow you to do this.

4766
02:23:03,660 --> 02:23:04,110
What?

4767
02:23:04,110 --> 02:23:04,590
Yeah,

4768
02:23:04,590 --> 02:23:07,400
because it was going to be done with the
same promotion company that did our a

4769
02:23:07,410 --> 02:23:08,520
virus tour and everything.

4770
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:10,980
So they came to us serious,

4771
02:23:10,981 --> 02:23:11,880
wasn't involved at all.

4772
02:23:12,030 --> 02:23:13,610
It was going to be sold and that and,

4773
02:23:13,611 --> 02:23:14,221
and you know,

4774
02:23:14,221 --> 02:23:19,221
everyone was going to make money and if
serious had a notion to sell that would

4775
02:23:19,441 --> 02:23:23,340
be able to sell that and make money
off of it instead of shaking down the

4776
02:23:23,341 --> 02:23:24,174
talent,

4777
02:23:24,360 --> 02:23:24,840
uh,

4778
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:29,840
to give them $1 million upfront
to allow us to do a Gig.

4779
02:23:30,151 --> 02:23:31,050
That would be huge.

4780
02:23:31,290 --> 02:23:34,680
They wanted you guys to
give them $1 million,

4781
02:23:34,681 --> 02:23:35,970
$1 million.

4782
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:36,241
How much,

4783
02:23:36,241 --> 02:23:38,160
what was the profit potential for this?

4784
02:23:38,230 --> 02:23:42,060
It was a lot less with
$1 million up front,

4785
02:23:43,310 --> 02:23:44,430
just to serious,

4786
02:23:45,460 --> 02:23:47,700
it was going to be a pretty lucrative,

4787
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:48,780
pretty lucrative.

4788
02:23:48,810 --> 02:23:51,110
But to that extent and the,

4789
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:53,640
just the nerve of your,

4790
02:23:53,641 --> 02:23:55,170
your company coming to you and saying,

4791
02:23:55,260 --> 02:23:58,920
we want to shake you down for 1
million bucks to allow you to do this.

4792
02:23:58,921 --> 02:24:02,130
It's fucking mafia tactics and,

4793
02:24:02,510 --> 02:24:03,343
and there's a,

4794
02:24:03,380 --> 02:24:04,060
there's a,

4795
02:24:04,060 --> 02:24:07,170
an ability for them to make
money on an appearance like that.

4796
02:24:07,710 --> 02:24:08,610
Sell the shit out of it.

4797
02:24:08,611 --> 02:24:08,781
You,

4798
02:24:08,781 --> 02:24:09,160
you,

4799
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:09,520
you,

4800
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:10,780
you sell with the cruise line,

4801
02:24:10,810 --> 02:24:11,643
you do this whatever.

4802
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:12,870
I don't know the ins and outs,

4803
02:24:12,871 --> 02:24:15,840
but I know in terrestrial radio
when we used to do appearances,

4804
02:24:15,930 --> 02:24:17,490
it wasn't coming out of our pocket.

4805
02:24:18,090 --> 02:24:19,170
That's unbelievable.

4806
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:19,321
Yeah.

4807
02:24:19,321 --> 02:24:20,400
$1 million,

4808
02:24:20,490 --> 02:24:21,870
1 million bucks.

4809
02:24:22,140 --> 02:24:23,880
Like fucking Dr Evil.

4810
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:26,490
They just dying on the vine.

4811
02:24:26,970 --> 02:24:27,540
Uh,

4812
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:28,373
I,

4813
02:24:28,440 --> 02:24:32,910
it's easy for me to say based on the fact
that I was thrown out of there to say

4814
02:24:32,911 --> 02:24:33,301
yes,

4815
02:24:33,301 --> 02:24:35,670
they are like we were talking about
the end of the world and stuff.

4816
02:24:35,790 --> 02:24:36,211
Yeah,

4817
02:24:36,211 --> 02:24:37,410
it's happening tomorrow.

4818
02:24:37,730 --> 02:24:38,563
Uh,

4819
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:40,073
but uh,

4820
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:45,440
I can't see them sustaining a
themselves based on what they're doing.

4821
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:48,570
It's just a lost cause.

4822
02:24:48,571 --> 02:24:48,990
They're,

4823
02:24:48,990 --> 02:24:53,670
they're showing themselves to be as much
regular radio as they were trying to

4824
02:24:53,671 --> 02:24:53,761
be.

4825
02:24:53,761 --> 02:24:57,160
The alternative of they're
showing themselves to be the,

4826
02:24:57,180 --> 02:25:00,990
the corporate guy and not
the cool show that you know,

4827
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:06,210
gets away with stuff and
the concepts so archaic.

4828
02:25:06,211 --> 02:25:08,550
When you have the internet
and you have like a provider,

4829
02:25:08,551 --> 02:25:10,170
like your situation,

4830
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:10,710
you're,

4831
02:25:10,710 --> 02:25:11,400
you're just,

4832
02:25:11,400 --> 02:25:13,180
you and Keith and that's it.

4833
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:14,630
You don't need it.

4834
02:25:14,631 --> 02:25:15,780
Don't need it anymore.

4835
02:25:15,810 --> 02:25:16,380
People,

4836
02:25:16,380 --> 02:25:17,970
you don't need it your own ads.

4837
02:25:18,140 --> 02:25:18,590
Yet.

4838
02:25:18,590 --> 02:25:22,080
You guys could both solicit
companies to advertise.

4839
02:25:22,081 --> 02:25:22,231
Like,

4840
02:25:22,231 --> 02:25:22,471
look,

4841
02:25:22,471 --> 02:25:24,370
I've got x amount of thousands

4842
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:25,390
of people every fucking day.

4843
02:25:25,391 --> 02:25:26,770
They listening and watching.

4844
02:25:26,950 --> 02:25:28,480
You can sell your products to that,

4845
02:25:28,540 --> 02:25:29,260
boom.

4846
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:30,790
And then you cut out all the nonsense.

4847
02:25:30,791 --> 02:25:33,130
All you need is an agent to
handle that stuff for you.

4848
02:25:33,460 --> 02:25:35,200
So like this idea of having this,

4849
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:35,770
I mean,

4850
02:25:35,770 --> 02:25:37,300
I've been to the ONA studios,

4851
02:25:37,450 --> 02:25:40,840
you guys are in a fucking
shiny building in Manhattan.

4852
02:25:40,841 --> 02:25:43,030
That must cost fuckloads of money.

4853
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:43,990
Unbelievable.

4854
02:25:43,991 --> 02:25:44,824
It's gotta be,

4855
02:25:44,950 --> 02:25:46,660
it's gotta be sound crazy.

4856
02:25:46,720 --> 02:25:48,880
It's way the fuck at the
top of this building.

4857
02:25:48,881 --> 02:25:52,390
You gotta show your Id and they
give you a fucking sticker.

4858
02:25:52,391 --> 02:25:53,560
My name is Ba.

4859
02:25:53,561 --> 02:25:55,750
You go through the thing
and go up to the floor.

4860
02:25:55,900 --> 02:25:58,090
I mean it's crazy how
much money is involved.

4861
02:25:58,180 --> 02:25:58,721
You go there,

4862
02:25:58,721 --> 02:26:03,340
this receptionist and people walking
back and forth and all they're doing is,

4863
02:26:03,750 --> 02:26:04,930
I mean they have music.

4864
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:05,380
Yeah.

4865
02:26:05,380 --> 02:26:06,610
But with you guys,

4866
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:08,770
I mean that's one of the reason why
you guys should be a separate entity,

4867
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:09,221
right?

4868
02:26:09,221 --> 02:26:10,360
Cause you don't need any of that

4869
02:26:10,760 --> 02:26:15,140
live talk aspect of it
is something different.

4870
02:26:15,470 --> 02:26:15,771
And,

4871
02:26:15,771 --> 02:26:20,771
and the worst part for them is the fact
that the most important logistical part

4872
02:26:22,071 --> 02:26:23,690
of their whole setup is

4873
02:26:23,890 --> 02:26:25,270
outer space.

4874
02:26:26,830 --> 02:26:29,470
Like if something fucks up at the house,

4875
02:26:30,070 --> 02:26:34,270
we can pretty much go to radio shack
and patch something together and fix it.

4876
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:36,070
There shits in space.

4877
02:26:37,720 --> 02:26:39,820
If something breaks on
one of their satellites,

4878
02:26:39,821 --> 02:26:40,600
what are you going to do?

4879
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:40,721
Well,

4880
02:26:40,721 --> 02:26:44,620
how has fucking Scott Greenstein
up there to fucking fix it?

4881
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:45,873
Good luck.

4882
02:26:46,090 --> 02:26:46,211
Yeah.

4883
02:26:46,211 --> 02:26:48,910
They can be wiped out by a
solar flare and solar flare.

4884
02:26:48,911 --> 02:26:49,930
Fucking meteors,

4885
02:26:49,931 --> 02:26:50,764
whatever,

4886
02:26:50,780 --> 02:26:51,321
whatever.

4887
02:26:51,321 --> 02:26:52,910
Some errant Russian fucking,

4888
02:26:55,430 --> 02:26:56,263
I don't know.

4889
02:26:56,450 --> 02:26:57,980
Uh Oh yeah.

4890
02:26:57,981 --> 02:26:59,360
Well power outage.

4891
02:26:59,480 --> 02:27:00,111
Yesterday we did,

4892
02:27:00,111 --> 02:27:02,050
we had a power outage
at the house yesterday.

4893
02:27:02,060 --> 02:27:02,720
The generator,

4894
02:27:02,720 --> 02:27:04,100
they have a generator.

4895
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:06,560
I have a giant fucking generator.

4896
02:27:06,561 --> 02:27:09,260
It's the size of a truck
and it's in my backyard.

4897
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:11,000
And when the power goes off,

4898
02:27:11,450 --> 02:27:15,490
this thing will automatically
automatically kick in and,

4899
02:27:15,580 --> 02:27:20,450
and I could run everything in my house
and probably two more houses with this.

4900
02:27:20,480 --> 02:27:21,313
For how long?

4901
02:27:21,590 --> 02:27:26,480
Until the fucking to 1000
gallon propane tanks run out.

4902
02:27:26,660 --> 02:27:28,190
That RN took it up yet?

4903
02:27:29,380 --> 02:27:30,213
Yeah.

4904
02:27:30,260 --> 02:27:31,093
So,

4905
02:27:31,220 --> 02:27:31,431
oh,

4906
02:27:31,431 --> 02:27:32,660
so you power just went out.

4907
02:27:32,870 --> 02:27:34,610
I went out yesterday and stayed off.

4908
02:27:34,850 --> 02:27:38,840
I did the rest of the show
from an iPhone in my kitchen

4909
02:27:40,770 --> 02:27:42,670
then to a battery backup perfect.

4910
02:27:42,730 --> 02:27:45,610
And my laptop to show videos and uh,

4911
02:27:46,060 --> 02:27:46,630
and uh,

4912
02:27:46,630 --> 02:27:50,470
Keith having a writing down the sponsors
and shit that I have to talk about.

4913
02:27:50,710 --> 02:27:51,341
It was great.

4914
02:27:51,341 --> 02:27:55,960
It was like we went from the
most technical technologically
advanced studio to

4915
02:27:56,110 --> 02:27:59,940
pretty much a bin Ladin in the cave is,

4916
02:27:59,970 --> 02:28:00,291
yeah.

4917
02:28:00,291 --> 02:28:00,581
Yeah.

4918
02:28:00,581 --> 02:28:04,690
It was weirder when you run and crouch
behind them than if you just walk,

4919
02:28:04,691 --> 02:28:05,570
you're just lost.

4920
02:28:05,930 --> 02:28:07,490
Get done saying how this is,

4921
02:28:07,940 --> 02:28:09,620
this is the opposite of serious.

4922
02:28:09,621 --> 02:28:10,431
You don't have to do that.

4923
02:28:10,431 --> 02:28:11,264
Yeah,

4924
02:28:13,480 --> 02:28:14,980
I can't hear you when you say that though.

4925
02:28:15,230 --> 02:28:20,230
The yellow that sat on either when
we're at our house doing it and he's on

4926
02:28:20,591 --> 02:28:21,170
camera,

4927
02:28:21,170 --> 02:28:22,003
I have to crouch on

4928
02:28:22,030 --> 02:28:22,980
the ice.

4929
02:28:23,230 --> 02:28:23,841
That's true.

4930
02:28:23,841 --> 02:28:24,890
He does crouch.

4931
02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:28,640
But there are times too where people
are at the house and they're talking and

4932
02:28:28,641 --> 02:28:30,230
the doors open and I don't care.

4933
02:28:30,231 --> 02:28:33,740
Like I liked kind of this ambient
noise that people are hanging out.

4934
02:28:34,170 --> 02:28:35,003
There's some people get,

4935
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:39,470
I got used to doing like live reads
with people talking all the time.

4936
02:28:39,471 --> 02:28:41,900
When come when commercials
would happen on the ONA show,

4937
02:28:42,110 --> 02:28:45,470
I would do the live reads and
people don't stop talking.

4938
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:46,790
And that was yesterday.

4939
02:28:47,390 --> 02:28:48,710
That was yesterday phone.

4940
02:28:48,711 --> 02:28:49,030
Geez.

4941
02:28:49,030 --> 02:28:49,910
What's the power out?

4942
02:28:51,820 --> 02:28:53,680
It's amazing that you
could stream like this.

4943
02:28:53,770 --> 02:28:54,250
Yeah.

4944
02:28:54,250 --> 02:28:55,780
So you're doing it all to you in four G.

4945
02:28:56,050 --> 02:28:56,883
Yup.

4946
02:28:57,160 --> 02:28:58,210
That's amazing.

4947
02:28:58,630 --> 02:29:03,630
This has taken forever because of red
tape with these stupid fucking a town.

4948
02:29:05,480 --> 02:29:05,740
Uh,

4949
02:29:05,740 --> 02:29:08,020
and there's zoning and
permits and everything.

4950
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:10,270
It's a good commercial for
the show here on your shelf.

4951
02:29:10,390 --> 02:29:13,870
So while the is what went on
and it would have been great,

4952
02:29:14,740 --> 02:29:15,011
Keith,

4953
02:29:15,011 --> 02:29:17,640
I do believe if you go to the
alarm system and punch the code in,

4954
02:29:17,860 --> 02:29:19,930
all the alarms were
going off in the house,

4955
02:29:20,110 --> 02:29:22,000
Cook for a battery backup and everything,

4956
02:29:22,140 --> 02:29:23,160
but it worked out.

4957
02:29:23,340 --> 02:29:23,850
You know,

4958
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:25,320
I'll get the generator on at some point.

4959
02:29:25,321 --> 02:29:26,160
The neighbors are gonna hate it.

4960
02:29:26,161 --> 02:29:30,330
It's got like a turbo
diesel truck engine in it.

4961
02:29:32,050 --> 02:29:32,883
Nice.

4962
02:29:34,980 --> 02:29:35,281
Yeah.

4963
02:29:35,281 --> 02:29:36,180
When I was in Colorado,

4964
02:29:36,181 --> 02:29:38,190
we had one of those would
kick in all the time.

4965
02:29:38,191 --> 02:29:39,510
Cause the power up there sucked.

4966
02:29:39,630 --> 02:29:39,930
Yeah.

4967
02:29:39,930 --> 02:29:42,000
Long Island's sucks
because the wind blows.

4968
02:29:42,130 --> 02:29:45,260
And for some reason where the only place
on the face of the earth now that's

4969
02:29:45,261 --> 02:29:47,730
still has wires strung on poles.

4970
02:29:47,731 --> 02:29:50,930
Like it's fucking like 1850 and,

4971
02:29:51,540 --> 02:29:53,790
and they're all between
the property lines.

4972
02:29:53,791 --> 02:29:53,871
Yeah.

4973
02:29:53,871 --> 02:29:54,990
Why did they underground?

4974
02:29:55,170 --> 02:29:56,010
I don't know.

4975
02:29:56,190 --> 02:29:57,090
That's so stupid.

4976
02:29:57,091 --> 02:29:59,310
And they put them between
the property lines of,

4977
02:29:59,330 --> 02:30:00,163
of uh,

4978
02:30:00,390 --> 02:30:01,290
everyone's house,

4979
02:30:01,470 --> 02:30:05,700
but then also in between the property
lines are trees cause you want like trees

4980
02:30:05,940 --> 02:30:07,320
and trees and wires.

4981
02:30:07,321 --> 02:30:08,370
They don't fucking men.

4982
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:11,070
So the second it gets too windy,

4983
02:30:11,071 --> 02:30:14,350
the wires rip out of
the fucking works and,

4984
02:30:14,351 --> 02:30:15,420
and you lose power.

4985
02:30:15,420 --> 02:30:15,720
So,

4986
02:30:15,720 --> 02:30:17,370
so you get this set up here,

4987
02:30:17,371 --> 02:30:19,680
back that up a little bit better.

4988
02:30:19,681 --> 02:30:20,240
Look at it.

4989
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:21,073
That's beautiful.

4990
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:22,440
That's the background.

4991
02:30:22,441 --> 02:30:24,360
Is that all screens or
is that your actual,

4992
02:30:24,390 --> 02:30:25,710
that's a green screen.

4993
02:30:25,740 --> 02:30:26,573
And that's my,

4994
02:30:27,150 --> 02:30:28,860
that's my pool in the backyard.

4995
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:29,141
Uh,

4996
02:30:29,141 --> 02:30:29,650
done,

4997
02:30:29,650 --> 02:30:29,970
uh,

4998
02:30:29,970 --> 02:30:30,960
on the green screen.

4999
02:30:31,110 --> 02:30:32,370
But I can put anything back there.

5000
02:30:32,400 --> 02:30:33,600
So there's a green screen,

5001
02:30:33,601 --> 02:30:35,040
but it's all broken up.

5002
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:37,080
Like you have some of it's green screen,

5003
02:30:37,830 --> 02:30:39,810
an entire greenscreen everything.

5004
02:30:39,811 --> 02:30:41,130
The fake screen behind me,

5005
02:30:41,131 --> 02:30:41,821
the desk,

5006
02:30:41,821 --> 02:30:42,780
it's all fake.

5007
02:30:43,770 --> 02:30:44,700
It's all fake.

5008
02:30:44,910 --> 02:30:48,480
So I sit there at a desk and a console,

5009
02:30:48,630 --> 02:30:49,680
but you don't see it.

5010
02:30:49,710 --> 02:30:50,461
You see that?

5011
02:30:50,461 --> 02:30:52,380
And the reflections are in the desk.

5012
02:30:52,381 --> 02:30:54,180
It's all computer magic.

5013
02:30:54,270 --> 02:30:55,110
That's amazing.

5014
02:30:55,111 --> 02:30:58,560
The reflections and the desk
are also manipulated fake.

5015
02:30:58,620 --> 02:30:59,620
And uh,

5016
02:31:00,540 --> 02:31:03,030
I could put any video on those screens.

5017
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:04,890
So that's what I use
when I'm showing video.

5018
02:31:04,891 --> 02:31:06,330
Who built the a desk for you?

5019
02:31:06,600 --> 02:31:07,433
Uh,

5020
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:08,640
that isn't a real desk.

5021
02:31:08,641 --> 02:31:09,260
The fake desk.

5022
02:31:09,260 --> 02:31:13,150
The desk is faith hold as being
a fake right here I'm sitting,

5023
02:31:13,650 --> 02:31:18,650
I'm sitting in a chair in a
very relatively small room
with a green behind me.

5024
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:21,990
That's why when something happens,

5025
02:31:22,050 --> 02:31:22,540
um,

5026
02:31:22,540 --> 02:31:22,790
and,

5027
02:31:22,790 --> 02:31:26,160
and like they were showing some of
the rioting and Ferguson and stuff and

5028
02:31:26,161 --> 02:31:29,280
they'll just play that on the
green screen behind me and I'll be,

5029
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:30,870
I'll be in the crowd going like,

5030
02:31:30,890 --> 02:31:31,340
ah,

5031
02:31:31,340 --> 02:31:32,173
don't hurt me.

5032
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:36,510
So the desk being faked.

5033
02:31:36,511 --> 02:31:38,580
So do you have green screen
in front of you as well?

5034
02:31:38,610 --> 02:31:38,911
No,

5035
02:31:38,911 --> 02:31:40,410
it knows how to layer.

5036
02:31:40,440 --> 02:31:44,310
That's the thing about the tri has that
I like it knows how to just layer things

5037
02:31:44,311 --> 02:31:45,570
like you would in Photoshop.

5038
02:31:45,880 --> 02:31:46,171
Uh,

5039
02:31:46,171 --> 02:31:46,531
where,

5040
02:31:46,531 --> 02:31:48,240
where the background is the back layer.

5041
02:31:48,300 --> 02:31:48,600
Uh,

5042
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:53,310
my live video is middle and then the
front layer is that desk and whatever else

5043
02:31:53,311 --> 02:31:54,144
is in front of me.

5044
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:56,700
So with the odd thing is I could never,

5045
02:31:58,050 --> 02:32:00,180
I could never reach over
the front of the desk.

5046
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:01,590
It's always in front of me.

5047
02:32:01,770 --> 02:32:03,540
So no matter how far I lean,

5048
02:32:03,570 --> 02:32:05,340
I can never reach over it.

5049
02:32:05,430 --> 02:32:05,581
Oh,

5050
02:32:05,581 --> 02:32:06,450
that's hilarious.

5051
02:32:06,480 --> 02:32:06,840
Yeah.

5052
02:32:06,840 --> 02:32:09,990
But it looks like I'm fussing with stuff
behind it all the time and I put my

5053
02:32:10,020 --> 02:32:15,020
beer down there or I have my Obama bobble
head doll and I'm talking politics or

5054
02:32:15,750 --> 02:32:16,111
you know,

5055
02:32:16,111 --> 02:32:16,471
it just,

5056
02:32:16,471 --> 02:32:19,680
everything could kind of be behind the
desk and it looks like I have what people

5057
02:32:19,681 --> 02:32:20,041
actually,

5058
02:32:20,041 --> 02:32:21,270
they come down to the studio and go,

5059
02:32:21,300 --> 02:32:22,133
this is it.

5060
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:23,153
That's it.

5061
02:32:23,610 --> 02:32:25,860
It looks like a giant complex,

5062
02:32:25,861 --> 02:32:26,820
a studio.

5063
02:32:26,821 --> 02:32:28,260
And it's really pretty simple.

5064
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:29,190
Wow,

5065
02:32:29,190 --> 02:32:30,030
that's amazing.

5066
02:32:30,060 --> 02:32:30,450
Yeah,

5067
02:32:30,450 --> 02:32:30,990
it's fun.

5068
02:32:30,990 --> 02:32:31,261
Man,

5069
02:32:31,261 --> 02:32:31,501
I,

5070
02:32:31,501 --> 02:32:34,320
I've always been into a video and,

5071
02:32:34,321 --> 02:32:35,154
and uh,

5072
02:32:35,640 --> 02:32:37,800
I used Adobe after effects.

5073
02:32:38,020 --> 02:32:38,230
We,

5074
02:32:38,230 --> 02:32:42,510
it's like Photoshop for video and a just
been fascinated with keying and green

5075
02:32:42,511 --> 02:32:43,710
screening and stuff like that.

5076
02:32:43,711 --> 02:32:44,640
And you know,

5077
02:32:44,670 --> 02:32:44,931
the,

5078
02:32:44,931 --> 02:32:49,260
the equipment that's available to people
now as opposed to even just a few years

5079
02:32:49,260 --> 02:32:49,261
ago.

5080
02:32:49,261 --> 02:32:52,920
Is unfucking believable even
just when you first started,

5081
02:32:52,921 --> 02:32:53,160
right?

5082
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:53,431
Yeah,

5083
02:32:53,431 --> 02:32:58,020
when I first started I was just grabbing
a few cameras there at B and h a and

5084
02:32:58,500 --> 02:33:02,940
popping it up and doing a show and then
slowly trial and error figuring out how

5085
02:33:02,941 --> 02:33:03,840
to do things.

5086
02:33:04,170 --> 02:33:04,411
Uh,

5087
02:33:04,411 --> 02:33:08,400
it's left a lot of electronic waste
and a lot of closets around my house.

5088
02:33:09,460 --> 02:33:11,040
So I got these lights don't work.

5089
02:33:12,210 --> 02:33:16,320
What made you decide to do like a video
based show as opposed to like the way

5090
02:33:16,321 --> 02:33:16,981
ONA was,

5091
02:33:16,981 --> 02:33:18,870
which is primarily audio base,

5092
02:33:18,871 --> 02:33:20,620
but you used to have pal talk and,

5093
02:33:20,910 --> 02:33:21,210
yeah.

5094
02:33:21,210 --> 02:33:21,541
Yeah.

5095
02:33:21,541 --> 02:33:21,780
I,

5096
02:33:21,780 --> 02:33:25,270
well I've always been into
more of a visual aspect to,

5097
02:33:25,310 --> 02:33:26,143
to a show.

5098
02:33:26,290 --> 02:33:26,680
I,

5099
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:28,410
and especially nowadays,

5100
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:30,420
everything is so visual,

5101
02:33:30,690 --> 02:33:31,020
uh,

5102
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:32,580
live leak and youtube and stuff.

5103
02:33:32,581 --> 02:33:36,600
People like watching videos of
something and then talking about it.

5104
02:33:36,870 --> 02:33:40,830
So I'll just pull videos all
day and all night and um,

5105
02:33:40,980 --> 02:33:43,090
put them in folders and uh,

5106
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:44,680
put him on the Tri Caster,

5107
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:48,390
play them and be able to
just discuss it with people.

5108
02:33:48,391 --> 02:33:49,224
So,

5109
02:33:49,270 --> 02:33:49,531
uh,

5110
02:33:49,531 --> 02:33:49,821
it,

5111
02:33:49,821 --> 02:33:51,390
it adds a whole nother dimension.

5112
02:33:51,391 --> 02:33:54,620
It is weird in the fact that I
can't just roll out of bed and,

5113
02:33:55,400 --> 02:33:57,750
and go downstairs without
showering something,

5114
02:33:57,751 --> 02:33:57,971
you know,

5115
02:33:57,971 --> 02:33:58,804
a shaving.

5116
02:33:58,940 --> 02:33:59,211
I mean,

5117
02:33:59,211 --> 02:34:00,990
I don't want to be a complete disaster.

5118
02:34:01,140 --> 02:34:02,430
I didn't have any hair gel today,

5119
02:34:02,431 --> 02:34:03,360
so I'm a little frizzy.

5120
02:34:03,870 --> 02:34:04,310
Uh,

5121
02:34:04,310 --> 02:34:07,320
so it is weird to be on
camera the whole time.

5122
02:34:07,410 --> 02:34:08,730
I'd find that kind of strange.

5123
02:34:09,220 --> 02:34:09,720
Uh,

5124
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:14,720
and then one of the things I learned
is you can't play a song parodies or

5125
02:34:15,511 --> 02:34:19,420
anything on a visual thing because you're
just kind of sitting there listening

5126
02:34:19,421 --> 02:34:20,140
to music.

5127
02:34:20,140 --> 02:34:21,150
We were playing an old,

5128
02:34:21,151 --> 02:34:25,120
I'm an old reverend Al Song
that I did years ago and,

5129
02:34:25,150 --> 02:34:25,391
uh,

5130
02:34:25,391 --> 02:34:26,950
I realized I'm just sitting there going,

5131
02:34:28,430 --> 02:34:28,601
well,

5132
02:34:28,601 --> 02:34:29,171
this is it.

5133
02:34:29,171 --> 02:34:29,890
Are you listening?

5134
02:34:29,890 --> 02:34:30,760
It was kind of weird.

5135
02:34:30,970 --> 02:34:31,300
You,

5136
02:34:31,300 --> 02:34:31,590
you,

5137
02:34:31,590 --> 02:34:33,610
that video that you just showed Brian,

5138
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:33,791
the,

5139
02:34:33,791 --> 02:34:35,350
you guys are sitting
right next to each other?

5140
02:34:35,710 --> 02:34:36,071
Yeah.

5141
02:34:36,071 --> 02:34:36,460
Yeah.

5142
02:34:36,460 --> 02:34:39,460
Is that weird having a conversation where
you sitting right next to each other

5143
02:34:39,461 --> 02:34:40,210
like that?

5144
02:34:40,210 --> 02:34:40,770
No,

5145
02:34:40,770 --> 02:34:42,190
you get used to it.

5146
02:34:42,970 --> 02:34:47,350
It's where you kind of address each other
and then the camera and it's a little

5147
02:34:47,351 --> 02:34:48,130
odd,

5148
02:34:48,130 --> 02:34:48,851
a little odd,

5149
02:34:48,851 --> 02:34:50,440
but you get used to it pretty quickly.

5150
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:51,081
And then we're,

5151
02:34:51,081 --> 02:34:54,400
we're adding more cameras
to the studio itself.

5152
02:34:54,490 --> 02:34:55,151
But a lot of times,

5153
02:34:55,151 --> 02:34:55,511
like I said,

5154
02:34:55,511 --> 02:35:00,160
I'll do it from out by the bar or out by
the pool or upstairs by the fireplace.

5155
02:35:00,161 --> 02:35:00,490
What,

5156
02:35:00,490 --> 02:35:01,150
wherever.

5157
02:35:01,150 --> 02:35:03,370
Do you think you'll eventually
have a place in New York?

5158
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:04,480
And they said they would like to,

5159
02:35:04,481 --> 02:35:08,140
I would like to rent a place
and have somewhere to go to do,

5160
02:35:08,141 --> 02:35:08,890
uh,

5161
02:35:08,890 --> 02:35:09,880
interviews or,

5162
02:35:10,480 --> 02:35:11,313
um,

5163
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:12,513
yeah.

5164
02:35:12,670 --> 02:35:17,230
And I think it'd be a lot more convenient
for me not having cameras strewn all

5165
02:35:17,231 --> 02:35:18,490
over my house and lights.

5166
02:35:18,670 --> 02:35:22,510
My house is strewn with
cameras and lights everywhere.

5167
02:35:23,110 --> 02:35:23,441
Oh look,

5168
02:35:23,441 --> 02:35:23,891
I look at it.

5169
02:35:23,891 --> 02:35:24,720
You got it outside.

5170
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:24,860
Yeah,

5171
02:35:24,860 --> 02:35:27,100
that's outside with me and Jimmy Norton,

5172
02:35:28,030 --> 02:35:28,750
uh,

5173
02:35:28,750 --> 02:35:29,560
hanging out.

5174
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:29,861
Just,

5175
02:35:29,861 --> 02:35:30,540
it's just,

5176
02:35:30,540 --> 02:35:31,373
uh,

5177
02:35:31,690 --> 02:35:32,523
go anywhere.

5178
02:35:32,620 --> 02:35:33,340
It's,

5179
02:35:33,340 --> 02:35:35,230
it doesn't have to be just in the studio.

5180
02:35:35,231 --> 02:35:35,410
No.

5181
02:35:35,410 --> 02:35:38,560
Have you had any conversations
with serious since the firing?

5182
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:39,370
Uh,

5183
02:35:39,370 --> 02:35:41,020
they send me an email when they fired me,

5184
02:35:41,021 --> 02:35:46,021
it was an email and I called Greenstein
who is the kind of boss over there and

5185
02:35:47,231 --> 02:35:52,090
said really fucking email after
10 years with you and you know,

5186
02:35:52,091 --> 02:35:54,130
years before with the XM and stuff,

5187
02:35:54,310 --> 02:35:55,380
but an email and he's,

5188
02:35:55,470 --> 02:35:55,981
wow,

5189
02:35:55,981 --> 02:35:56,111
look,

5190
02:35:56,111 --> 02:35:56,351
you know,

5191
02:35:56,351 --> 02:35:57,000
I,

5192
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:57,790
I can,

5193
02:35:57,790 --> 02:35:59,260
I was like no explanation,

5194
02:35:59,350 --> 02:36:00,183
nothing.

5195
02:36:00,370 --> 02:36:00,641
No.

5196
02:36:00,641 --> 02:36:02,100
Come in and talk and you know,

5197
02:36:02,110 --> 02:36:03,490
give your side or anything.

5198
02:36:03,910 --> 02:36:04,451
Well we,

5199
02:36:04,451 --> 02:36:06,100
and he just didn't have anything.

5200
02:36:06,400 --> 02:36:06,671
I said,

5201
02:36:06,671 --> 02:36:06,911
okay,

5202
02:36:06,911 --> 02:36:07,744
so I'm,

5203
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:08,770
I'm fired and that's it.

5204
02:36:08,771 --> 02:36:09,280
He goes,

5205
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:09,581
yeah,

5206
02:36:09,581 --> 02:36:10,361
there's really nothing.

5207
02:36:10,361 --> 02:36:10,630
I go,

5208
02:36:10,630 --> 02:36:11,350
okay,

5209
02:36:11,350 --> 02:36:11,771
thank you.

5210
02:36:11,771 --> 02:36:15,700
You'll hear from my lawyer cause I have
to sew him for the rest of my money.

5211
02:36:16,180 --> 02:36:16,960
Are you suing?

5212
02:36:16,960 --> 02:36:17,220
Yeah.

5213
02:36:17,220 --> 02:36:20,440
Why wouldn't I would like my contract?

5214
02:36:20,441 --> 02:36:21,274
Yeah.

5215
02:36:21,450 --> 02:36:23,650
I don't think they had
legitimate reason to fire me.

5216
02:36:24,100 --> 02:36:25,660
It had to be something that,

5217
02:36:25,661 --> 02:36:26,494
um,

5218
02:36:27,310 --> 02:36:27,730
di,

5219
02:36:27,730 --> 02:36:28,810
what does that word,

5220
02:36:29,380 --> 02:36:31,810
when you do something to
accompany that makes the company,

5221
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:33,400
puts the company in a bad light?

5222
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:34,870
The company itself,

5223
02:36:34,871 --> 02:36:36,220
like disparage,

5224
02:36:36,270 --> 02:36:37,103
uh,

5225
02:36:37,240 --> 02:36:37,451
uh,

5226
02:36:37,451 --> 02:36:39,130
if I have something in there that said,

5227
02:36:39,131 --> 02:36:43,150
if I disparage the company now that's
me going on and saying serious socks.

5228
02:36:43,360 --> 02:36:45,160
Don't fucking subscribe to them.

5229
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:45,851
Uh,

5230
02:36:45,851 --> 02:36:46,750
Howard Sachs,

5231
02:36:46,751 --> 02:36:47,351
this sucks.

5232
02:36:47,351 --> 02:36:49,210
Everyone sucks with the
bosses are assholes.

5233
02:36:49,210 --> 02:36:50,110
They don't know what they're doing.

5234
02:36:50,380 --> 02:36:51,940
Like that's disparaging the company.

5235
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:57,360
Me expressing my thoughts that I had
expressed on their airwaves for years is

5236
02:36:58,871 --> 02:37:00,160
not disparaging their company.

5237
02:37:00,161 --> 02:37:00,850
So,

5238
02:37:00,850 --> 02:37:01,230
uh,

5239
02:37:01,230 --> 02:37:03,340
I say you owe me from July to October.

5240
02:37:04,370 --> 02:37:06,610
So see up motherfucker.

5241
02:37:06,670 --> 02:37:07,451
When he does that,

5242
02:37:07,451 --> 02:37:08,260
go to court,

5243
02:37:08,260 --> 02:37:08,591
uh,

5244
02:37:08,591 --> 02:37:09,460
they're working on it already.

5245
02:37:09,461 --> 02:37:10,600
My agent and uh,

5246
02:37:10,660 --> 02:37:12,970
one of the lawyers is this
all on top of that shit.

5247
02:37:13,180 --> 02:37:14,110
It won't go to court.

5248
02:37:14,320 --> 02:37:15,800
All these things just settle.

5249
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:16,281
It's like,

5250
02:37:16,281 --> 02:37:16,401
yeah,

5251
02:37:16,401 --> 02:37:17,420
I'll take some fucking,

5252
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:18,770
I'll take some cash.

5253
02:37:19,150 --> 02:37:20,090
All their money.

5254
02:37:20,420 --> 02:37:20,601
I mean,

5255
02:37:20,601 --> 02:37:22,130
did they have a lot of subscribers?

5256
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:23,033
How's it work?

5257
02:37:23,330 --> 02:37:23,870
Uh,

5258
02:37:23,870 --> 02:37:25,550
their subscriber.

5259
02:37:25,580 --> 02:37:29,480
I don't know how many subscribers they
actually have at what they say they

5260
02:37:29,481 --> 02:37:33,410
subscribe at because they count things
like when you buy a new car and you get a

5261
02:37:33,411 --> 02:37:34,580
free subscription,

5262
02:37:34,581 --> 02:37:36,230
they count that as a subscriber.

5263
02:37:36,350 --> 02:37:40,520
A lot of people were canceling
their subs for when they fired me.

5264
02:37:40,610 --> 02:37:41,720
They were very cold.

5265
02:37:41,721 --> 02:37:42,231
A lot of people.

5266
02:37:42,231 --> 02:37:42,970
That's fucking,

5267
02:37:42,970 --> 02:37:43,803
yeah,

5268
02:37:43,970 --> 02:37:44,610
not me.

5269
02:37:44,610 --> 02:37:45,021
No,

5270
02:37:45,021 --> 02:37:45,231
no.

5271
02:37:45,231 --> 02:37:45,680
Sorry.

5272
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:45,861
I,

5273
02:37:45,861 --> 02:37:46,340
you know,

5274
02:37:46,340 --> 02:37:47,173
I hung in there.

5275
02:37:47,860 --> 02:37:48,693
Thank you.

5276
02:37:49,350 --> 02:37:50,183
I'm not,

5277
02:37:50,540 --> 02:37:52,310
I wouldn't hold it against any potential.

5278
02:37:52,870 --> 02:37:53,703
Um,

5279
02:37:56,190 --> 02:37:57,200
but they uh,

5280
02:37:57,201 --> 02:37:59,090
they canceled and everyone was saying,

5281
02:37:59,091 --> 02:37:59,331
wow.

5282
02:37:59,331 --> 02:38:01,490
They called me back and said
they're going to give me,

5283
02:38:01,820 --> 02:38:02,091
you know,

5284
02:38:02,091 --> 02:38:06,440
a year subscription for like a
third of the price and stuff.

5285
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:07,990
And that just adds up as subs.

5286
02:38:07,991 --> 02:38:11,510
So when they go in front
of their shareholders,

5287
02:38:11,810 --> 02:38:13,460
when they give their quarterly reports,

5288
02:38:13,461 --> 02:38:13,821
they say,

5289
02:38:13,821 --> 02:38:14,211
well,

5290
02:38:14,211 --> 02:38:15,530
ladies and gentlemen,

5291
02:38:15,950 --> 02:38:17,540
the subs are up.

5292
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:18,950
We're doing great.

5293
02:38:18,951 --> 02:38:21,020
We went from this many subs to this many.

5294
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:21,681
Now meanwhile,

5295
02:38:21,681 --> 02:38:23,690
if you went from that
many or that many paying,

5296
02:38:23,900 --> 02:38:25,880
and now they're paying
a third of the price,

5297
02:38:26,450 --> 02:38:27,710
you're kind of losing money.

5298
02:38:27,860 --> 02:38:29,420
They never tell how much money.

5299
02:38:29,480 --> 02:38:30,560
It's always the money.

5300
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:30,921
Actually,

5301
02:38:30,921 --> 02:38:32,480
they always tell is that a loss?

5302
02:38:32,660 --> 02:38:34,370
But there's subs always going up.

5303
02:38:34,400 --> 02:38:36,410
It's amazing how that works.

5304
02:38:36,740 --> 02:38:37,670
The subs,

5305
02:38:37,850 --> 02:38:39,410
so many subs we have,

5306
02:38:39,411 --> 02:38:41,210
it's just a very strange business.

5307
02:38:41,240 --> 02:38:41,511
It has,

5308
02:38:41,511 --> 02:38:42,350
it's not ratings,

5309
02:38:42,351 --> 02:38:42,561
you know,

5310
02:38:42,561 --> 02:38:45,710
SharePoint's things like that
that I remember from a radio.

5311
02:38:46,120 --> 02:38:47,360
It's a way we need subs.

5312
02:38:47,480 --> 02:38:48,830
And I remember the boss of the company,

5313
02:38:48,831 --> 02:38:49,790
the actual boss,

5314
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,140
I don't even remember his fucking name.

5315
02:38:51,141 --> 02:38:52,550
That's how little I dealt with him.

5316
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:53,271
Uh,

5317
02:38:53,271 --> 02:38:54,800
I dealt with Scott all the time,

5318
02:38:54,801 --> 02:38:55,970
but this boss Guy,

5319
02:38:56,330 --> 02:38:56,691
he,

5320
02:38:56,691 --> 02:38:57,524
uh,

5321
02:38:57,740 --> 02:38:58,491
he pat us up,

5322
02:38:58,491 --> 02:39:00,350
we met with him once and he goes,

5323
02:39:00,351 --> 02:39:00,710
he goes,

5324
02:39:00,710 --> 02:39:02,120
I don't care what you guys do,

5325
02:39:02,121 --> 02:39:02,954
what you say.

5326
02:39:03,110 --> 02:39:03,441
He goes,

5327
02:39:03,441 --> 02:39:04,274
to tell you the truth,

5328
02:39:04,430 --> 02:39:07,400
I barely ever even listened to your show.

5329
02:39:07,401 --> 02:39:07,641
He like,

5330
02:39:07,641 --> 02:39:08,780
he didn't even know what we did.

5331
02:39:08,810 --> 02:39:10,550
He thought this was good
to tell us by the way.

5332
02:39:10,970 --> 02:39:12,140
And then he goes,

5333
02:39:12,230 --> 02:39:15,260
all I care about our subscriptions.

5334
02:39:15,410 --> 02:39:18,290
That's what I want subscription.

5335
02:39:18,830 --> 02:39:21,740
And it just reminded me of twilight
zone where an old boss was like,

5336
02:39:21,741 --> 02:39:22,574
you've got to push,

5337
02:39:22,610 --> 02:39:23,031
push,

5338
02:39:23,031 --> 02:39:23,864
push.

5339
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:27,500
And the guy's like fucking
sitting there in black and white.

5340
02:39:27,501 --> 02:39:28,160
All crazy.

5341
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:29,650
All I care about is subscriptions.

5342
02:39:29,690 --> 02:39:30,231
That was it.

5343
02:39:30,231 --> 02:39:31,610
And that just told me right there like,

5344
02:39:31,611 --> 02:39:32,444
oh boy,

5345
02:39:32,810 --> 02:39:33,860
this isn't good.

5346
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:34,760
It's just,

5347
02:39:34,760 --> 02:39:35,810
it's too archaic.

5348
02:39:35,960 --> 02:39:36,490
It's history.

5349
02:39:36,490 --> 02:39:37,640
It's just too archaic.

5350
02:39:37,670 --> 02:39:40,430
The idea that like I'd
get a podcast on the,

5351
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:43,220
on my phone and I can stream it live.

5352
02:39:43,250 --> 02:39:47,750
Like immediately I press a button on my
phone and it starts playing in my car.

5353
02:39:47,780 --> 02:39:48,613
I was that not true.

5354
02:39:48,670 --> 02:39:50,060
This thing and I can pause it.

5355
02:39:50,310 --> 02:39:50,780
Yeah.

5356
02:39:50,780 --> 02:39:53,230
And I could start the all things
that I can't do with serious.

5357
02:39:53,231 --> 02:39:53,510
Yeah.

5358
02:39:53,510 --> 02:39:54,343
This is all things,

5359
02:39:54,470 --> 02:39:57,070
this idea of a show is on when it's on,

5360
02:39:57,080 --> 02:39:58,280
that's when you have to be tuned again.

5361
02:39:58,460 --> 02:39:59,420
That's ridiculous.

5362
02:39:59,660 --> 02:40:00,500
That's our cake.

5363
02:40:00,530 --> 02:40:00,831
Well,

5364
02:40:00,831 --> 02:40:03,200
I think their hope is that hey,

5365
02:40:03,410 --> 02:40:06,200
people still turn on their
fucking radio in their car.

5366
02:40:06,380 --> 02:40:06,800
They do.

5367
02:40:06,800 --> 02:40:07,950
And you know I do.

5368
02:40:09,850 --> 02:40:10,490
Yeah,

5369
02:40:10,490 --> 02:40:12,260
like the uncle Paul thing.

5370
02:40:12,290 --> 02:40:15,930
I heard about it because I was just
flipping through the dials and because I

5371
02:40:15,931 --> 02:40:17,670
turned it on when it was happening,

5372
02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:21,180
you know it when I was in my car
was right when Jimmy was doing that.

5373
02:40:21,210 --> 02:40:23,190
If I had watched listen
from the beginning,

5374
02:40:23,191 --> 02:40:25,290
I might not have made
it to that part I made.

5375
02:40:25,291 --> 02:40:28,260
It might've gotten to my destination
and not hurt the whole show.

5376
02:40:29,070 --> 02:40:29,690
Yeah,

5377
02:40:29,690 --> 02:40:30,730
there's something to that.

5378
02:40:30,760 --> 02:40:35,280
People still listen to just FM radio
that just put that fucker on ab and it's

5379
02:40:35,281 --> 02:40:35,521
still,

5380
02:40:35,521 --> 02:40:35,760
well,

5381
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:37,380
you know the ratings is still there,

5382
02:40:38,240 --> 02:40:40,320
but they're the weirdest
ratings of all time.

5383
02:40:40,321 --> 02:40:44,610
Those books at the handout
that diary Nielsen Diary,

5384
02:40:44,611 --> 02:40:46,560
we need carpet tron diaries.

5385
02:40:46,560 --> 02:40:51,030
I wrote it in and I represent
10,000 people and we,

5386
02:40:51,210 --> 02:40:54,750
well not enough diaries got
returned from the urban areas,

5387
02:40:54,751 --> 02:40:59,280
so we're going to flood them with diaries
the next month and then at the end of

5388
02:40:59,281 --> 02:41:03,240
three months we average it to
get who came up with this shit.

5389
02:41:03,570 --> 02:41:06,810
It's 2014 they're using
fucking the same system.

5390
02:41:06,811 --> 02:41:07,011
The,

5391
02:41:07,011 --> 02:41:07,161
the,

5392
02:41:07,161 --> 02:41:07,331
the,

5393
02:41:07,331 --> 02:41:12,331
the mercantile used in little house
on the prairie Wilson's mercantile.

5394
02:41:12,480 --> 02:41:14,190
It is the Nielsen is a goofy,

5395
02:41:14,191 --> 02:41:16,350
but the arbitragers are even more goofy.

5396
02:41:16,410 --> 02:41:16,710
Yeah.

5397
02:41:16,710 --> 02:41:17,311
That book,

5398
02:41:17,311 --> 02:41:18,300
that rating the John,

5399
02:41:18,301 --> 02:41:18,841
that was the one,

5400
02:41:18,841 --> 02:41:19,100
yeah.

5401
02:41:19,100 --> 02:41:19,530
Yeah.

5402
02:41:19,530 --> 02:41:20,430
That's the goofiest.

5403
02:41:20,431 --> 02:41:21,510
That's the go feet book.

5404
02:41:21,540 --> 02:41:24,210
They send you a book and they sing
it like a dollar or something.

5405
02:41:24,390 --> 02:41:26,310
How do they know he's listening?

5406
02:41:26,550 --> 02:41:27,121
They can't,

5407
02:41:27,121 --> 02:41:27,750
no,

5408
02:41:27,750 --> 02:41:28,590
no they can't.

5409
02:41:28,860 --> 02:41:29,820
They really can't.

5410
02:41:30,090 --> 02:41:30,781
To serious.

5411
02:41:30,781 --> 02:41:31,740
Now who's listening?

5412
02:41:31,800 --> 02:41:32,850
Did they have any idea?

5413
02:41:33,450 --> 02:41:35,310
I think they do in some way,

5414
02:41:35,311 --> 02:41:35,940
shape or form.

5415
02:41:35,940 --> 02:41:37,080
They have to write,

5416
02:41:37,590 --> 02:41:38,340
don't they?

5417
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:42,120
I would imagine with that technology
they have to know who's turned into a

5418
02:41:42,121 --> 02:41:42,541
channel.

5419
02:41:42,541 --> 02:41:45,180
I would imagine it would be
like an IP address on a website.

5420
02:41:45,181 --> 02:41:45,450
Like,

5421
02:41:45,450 --> 02:41:45,631
oh,

5422
02:41:45,631 --> 02:41:48,030
there's 40,000 people listening to,

5423
02:41:48,080 --> 02:41:50,190
I've always said it's like one way,

5424
02:41:50,191 --> 02:41:53,700
but they've always said
it's like a one way signal.

5425
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:55,140
They send it to your radio,

5426
02:41:55,141 --> 02:41:57,180
but your radio doesn't
send anything back to them.

5427
02:41:57,420 --> 02:41:57,870
When you,

5428
02:41:57,870 --> 02:42:01,440
when you subscribe you'll have to do it
from either the phone or a computer with

5429
02:42:01,441 --> 02:42:02,670
your radio number.

5430
02:42:03,060 --> 02:42:04,470
So you can't just go to your radio and go,

5431
02:42:04,471 --> 02:42:04,801
Hey,

5432
02:42:04,801 --> 02:42:05,700
I'm subscribing.

5433
02:42:05,701 --> 02:42:09,000
Click Kevin Smith was telling me that
they know who's listening to what.

5434
02:42:09,150 --> 02:42:09,983
Yeah.

5435
02:42:10,020 --> 02:42:11,250
I don't know how he knows.

5436
02:42:11,370 --> 02:42:12,240
I don't know either.

5437
02:42:12,870 --> 02:42:14,160
I've never heard a number.

5438
02:42:14,161 --> 02:42:15,480
They've never given us a number.

5439
02:42:15,481 --> 02:42:17,070
I think cause they know
it would be a barber,

5440
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:19,500
a bargaining chip for a negotiation.

5441
02:42:19,530 --> 02:42:23,830
I would think that just the information
that shows like on your display it,

5442
02:42:23,831 --> 02:42:25,140
I says like you know guests today,

5443
02:42:25,141 --> 02:42:25,861
blah blah blah.

5444
02:42:25,861 --> 02:42:26,160
Right.

5445
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:31,160
That there's something sending out that
separate from the signal or something,

5446
02:42:32,870 --> 02:42:34,550
but it's not because that's sent this,

5447
02:42:34,560 --> 02:42:37,470
they're doing that with a regular
radio too now with HD radio.

5448
02:42:37,471 --> 02:42:38,190
That's true.

5449
02:42:38,190 --> 02:42:40,410
If you listen to regular
radio that it's part,

5450
02:42:40,420 --> 02:42:42,930
it's embedded in the signal
that they're broadcasting.

5451
02:42:43,290 --> 02:42:44,640
What else has embedded in that

5452
02:42:46,690 --> 02:42:47,600
folk can go over them.

5453
02:42:47,601 --> 02:42:49,290
It's the harp system.

5454
02:42:53,220 --> 02:42:54,210
I love Jesse.

5455
02:42:54,211 --> 02:42:54,391
Oh,

5456
02:42:54,391 --> 02:42:55,224
what a nut.

5457
02:42:55,590 --> 02:43:00,080
What about nine 11 nine
11 what about patriot?

5458
02:43:01,430 --> 02:43:04,320
If you don't think they
brought the building down

5459
02:43:06,150 --> 02:43:10,980
that that was embarrassing incident
with him and Jimmy Norton who was

5460
02:43:10,990 --> 02:43:11,823
embarrassing.

5461
02:43:11,950 --> 02:43:12,220
Thank

5462
02:43:12,220 --> 02:43:13,330
you for your service.

5463
02:43:13,450 --> 02:43:14,350
He was embarrassing.

5464
02:43:14,380 --> 02:43:15,150
He really was.

5465
02:43:15,150 --> 02:43:15,431
He just,

5466
02:43:15,431 --> 02:43:16,660
it was such a blowhard.

5467
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:17,501
Yeah.

5468
02:43:17,501 --> 02:43:19,150
Well that's the like him before that.

5469
02:43:19,330 --> 02:43:19,661
Yeah.

5470
02:43:19,661 --> 02:43:22,030
I think something happened to him age,

5471
02:43:22,120 --> 02:43:23,050
like age.

5472
02:43:23,051 --> 02:43:23,321
Yeah.

5473
02:43:23,321 --> 02:43:24,410
There might've been some kind of,

5474
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:25,311
well,

5475
02:43:25,311 --> 02:43:26,530
some kind of brain thing,

5476
02:43:26,560 --> 02:43:28,210
a little snaps thing or,

5477
02:43:28,630 --> 02:43:32,350
I think it's also people that get
really conspiratorially minded.

5478
02:43:32,351 --> 02:43:33,960
They start getting really nutty with that.

5479
02:43:33,970 --> 02:43:34,803
That starts,

5480
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:37,750
it starts becoming something
they just automatically go to.

5481
02:43:37,930 --> 02:43:38,763
Yeah.

5482
02:43:38,950 --> 02:43:39,550
What?

5483
02:43:39,550 --> 02:43:44,550
Automatically there's no room for
reasonable discussion on a topic anymore.

5484
02:43:45,071 --> 02:43:46,150
It automatically goes to,

5485
02:43:46,151 --> 02:43:46,984
well,

5486
02:43:47,290 --> 02:43:51,670
what about nine 11 nine 11
explained to be the Patriot Act.

5487
02:43:52,750 --> 02:43:54,670
They had it ready to go look.

5488
02:43:54,671 --> 02:43:55,720
All fucked Tonkin.

5489
02:43:56,260 --> 02:43:56,651
Yeah,

5490
02:43:56,651 --> 02:43:56,950
right.

5491
02:43:56,950 --> 02:43:57,480
Another one.

5492
02:43:57,480 --> 02:43:58,120
Gotcha.

5493
02:43:58,120 --> 02:43:59,810
Operation Northlight

5494
02:44:05,650 --> 02:44:06,520
fucking hilarious.

5495
02:44:06,960 --> 02:44:11,960
I think also they get real high on
finding conspiracies and things like just

5496
02:44:13,030 --> 02:44:17,890
several people that I follow online that
will find anything that's online and

5497
02:44:17,891 --> 02:44:21,130
think that there's some fucking
grand scheme behind it all.

5498
02:44:21,130 --> 02:44:22,960
Like some guy was going on the other day.

5499
02:44:22,961 --> 02:44:26,980
About what Isis really was
with some Israeli plot.

5500
02:44:27,010 --> 02:44:27,850
Some fucking,

5501
02:44:28,660 --> 02:44:29,493
that's how stress,

5502
02:44:29,730 --> 02:44:30,130
well,

5503
02:44:30,130 --> 02:44:31,300
it's just always something,

5504
02:44:31,301 --> 02:44:31,601
man.

5505
02:44:31,601 --> 02:44:32,434
It really is.

5506
02:44:32,590 --> 02:44:33,040
They just,

5507
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:35,500
they also don't acknowledge real facts.

5508
02:44:35,501 --> 02:44:39,820
Sometimes they just throw them away if
they can't put a conspiracy to a fact.

5509
02:44:40,180 --> 02:44:41,710
It just never existed like,

5510
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:42,160
uh,

5511
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:44,800
well why didn't they find any
plane parts of the Pentagon?

5512
02:44:44,830 --> 02:44:45,041
Well,

5513
02:44:45,041 --> 02:44:45,880
they did.

5514
02:44:46,330 --> 02:44:47,200
They did.

5515
02:44:48,020 --> 02:44:48,401
No,

5516
02:44:48,401 --> 02:44:48,611
no,

5517
02:44:48,611 --> 02:44:48,761
no,

5518
02:44:48,761 --> 02:44:49,160
they did.

5519
02:44:49,160 --> 02:44:49,500
Ah,

5520
02:44:49,500 --> 02:44:50,080
okay.

5521
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:51,040
It was a missile that hit,

5522
02:44:51,041 --> 02:44:51,850
it wasn't a plane,

5523
02:44:51,850 --> 02:44:53,530
so they found this,

5524
02:44:53,531 --> 02:44:54,370
they found an engine.

5525
02:44:54,371 --> 02:44:54,881
They found it,

5526
02:44:54,881 --> 02:44:55,091
you know,

5527
02:44:55,091 --> 02:44:58,090
apart from American Airlines here
on the fucking lawn and stuff.

5528
02:44:58,390 --> 02:44:58,811
Nah,

5529
02:44:58,811 --> 02:44:59,650
they didn't find anything.

5530
02:44:59,740 --> 02:44:59,951
Oh,

5531
02:44:59,951 --> 02:45:00,520
okay.

5532
02:45:00,520 --> 02:45:01,890
Now I saw a website,

5533
02:45:01,930 --> 02:45:02,400
bro.

5534
02:45:02,400 --> 02:45:02,590
The,

5535
02:45:02,590 --> 02:45:05,500
I saw a website and the
website said to the contrary,

5536
02:45:05,650 --> 02:45:06,483
right.

5537
02:45:06,490 --> 02:45:08,200
Or you don't think the fucking,

5538
02:45:08,240 --> 02:45:09,370
the right there at the Pentagon,

5539
02:45:09,371 --> 02:45:12,220
you don't think they could have
laid plane parts out on the lawn.

5540
02:45:12,760 --> 02:45:14,740
That's a much smaller truck pulls up.

5541
02:45:14,741 --> 02:45:15,670
The guy gets out.

5542
02:45:15,671 --> 02:45:20,671
Just fucking throw in plain fucking pies
out of video of a guide you in that.

5543
02:45:22,210 --> 02:45:22,960
Just like,

5544
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:23,261
you know,

5545
02:45:23,261 --> 02:45:27,400
you ever see those trucks that farmers
have with a spray seeds at the back of

5546
02:45:27,401 --> 02:45:28,530
the truck that they,

5547
02:45:28,580 --> 02:45:31,540
with that just chuck and
play and playing parts.

5548
02:45:32,990 --> 02:45:33,340
Yeah.

5549
02:45:33,340 --> 02:45:35,110
That's a piece of a tail light gas.

5550
02:45:35,111 --> 02:45:36,810
We need a fucking turbine of a,

5551
02:45:37,670 --> 02:45:38,110
yeah.

5552
02:45:38,110 --> 02:45:42,550
There's never a logical explanation for
anything and the easiest explanation is

5553
02:45:42,551 --> 02:45:44,320
never the one that it could be.

5554
02:45:44,440 --> 02:45:48,970
It's always got to be a very complicated
something that would've taken planning

5555
02:45:48,971 --> 02:45:51,550
on the lines of a movie.

5556
02:45:51,950 --> 02:45:52,450
Uh,

5557
02:45:52,450 --> 02:45:53,650
but you know,

5558
02:45:53,770 --> 02:45:56,590
and once they get it in their
head that there is a conspiracy,

5559
02:45:56,591 --> 02:45:59,650
they'd look only for everything
that supports that conspiracy.

5560
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:00,190
Yes.

5561
02:46:00,190 --> 02:46:05,190
We had this episode on Chem trails
at all that Scifi shows we did.

5562
02:46:05,380 --> 02:46:09,920
That was the one that more people
got so fucking angry chem trails.

5563
02:46:09,921 --> 02:46:14,921
One because we had a guy on who was
explaining in very clear scientific terms

5564
02:46:15,980 --> 02:46:17,480
that jet engines,

5565
02:46:17,750 --> 02:46:21,020
when you fly through
condensation in the atmosphere,

5566
02:46:21,021 --> 02:46:22,220
create clouds.

5567
02:46:22,280 --> 02:46:22,821
There you go.

5568
02:46:22,821 --> 02:46:26,420
They create artificial clouds
and these artificial clouds,

5569
02:46:26,910 --> 02:46:29,750
you could do it over and over
and over again all day long.

5570
02:46:29,990 --> 02:46:31,670
All you have to do is fly
through and they were like,

5571
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:31,941
yeah,

5572
02:46:31,941 --> 02:46:36,500
what about one time there's a video
that shows the plane and it's flying and

5573
02:46:36,501 --> 02:46:38,480
it's creating a cloud and then no cloud,

5574
02:46:38,481 --> 02:46:39,680
and they turned the jet off.

5575
02:46:39,681 --> 02:46:40,910
Did he turned it on again?

5576
02:46:41,360 --> 02:46:45,050
Or you know how you look up at
the sky and there's a cloud here.

5577
02:46:45,390 --> 02:46:47,000
There's not a cloud here.

5578
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:47,570
Yeah,

5579
02:46:47,570 --> 02:46:52,400
because the level of condensation
atmosphere very varies and it's different.

5580
02:46:52,401 --> 02:46:53,680
And if there's a lot of

5581
02:46:57,100 --> 02:46:57,933
Barium,

5582
02:46:58,910 --> 02:47:03,910
what about 911 if you squeeze
the air that has moisture in it,

5583
02:47:04,340 --> 02:47:06,950
that's not visible as a cloud right now,

5584
02:47:07,160 --> 02:47:08,720
but you've run it through a jet engine,

5585
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:10,850
it's going to come out
the other end as a cloud.

5586
02:47:10,850 --> 02:47:11,540
Yeah,

5587
02:47:11,540 --> 02:47:13,220
but let me tell you what it is.

5588
02:47:13,850 --> 02:47:17,990
It's a weird thing that people want to
believe that the government is spraying

5589
02:47:17,991 --> 02:47:20,930
the skies and they're down here too,

5590
02:47:21,470 --> 02:47:25,100
but they're just spraying those skies
and have they been doing that since

5591
02:47:25,101 --> 02:47:26,420
there's been jet engines?

5592
02:47:26,421 --> 02:47:28,940
Because there's been con trails,

5593
02:47:28,941 --> 02:47:29,410
which is,

5594
02:47:29,410 --> 02:47:31,190
that's the thing people
don't want to admit.

5595
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:35,450
They want to pretend that there weren't
these contracts back when we were young.

5596
02:47:35,570 --> 02:47:37,520
They used to dissolve very quickly.

5597
02:47:37,810 --> 02:47:40,820
We fly and then the
controls dissipate quickly.

5598
02:47:40,821 --> 02:47:45,821
Those are normal controls the controls
are seeing today or chem trail ride.

5599
02:47:45,880 --> 02:47:46,020
Oh,

5600
02:47:46,020 --> 02:47:46,770
okay.

5601
02:47:46,770 --> 02:47:48,710
It's aluminum and barium aluminum.

5602
02:47:48,711 --> 02:47:49,370
Barium.

5603
02:47:49,370 --> 02:47:49,790
Meanwhile,

5604
02:47:49,790 --> 02:47:51,200
if you fucking sprayed aluminum,

5605
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:52,820
it wouldn't look like a goddamn cloud.

5606
02:47:53,010 --> 02:47:54,710
You need something that's moisture,

5607
02:47:54,740 --> 02:47:55,150
right?

5608
02:47:55,150 --> 02:47:56,690
A cloud that needs to be vapor.

5609
02:47:57,020 --> 02:47:58,880
Like aluminum is never
going to be a fucking vapor.

5610
02:47:58,881 --> 02:47:59,950
It's hell no,

5611
02:48:00,130 --> 02:48:00,630
it's,

5612
02:48:00,630 --> 02:48:01,790
it's all so dumb.

5613
02:48:01,820 --> 02:48:01,930
Uh,

5614
02:48:01,930 --> 02:48:04,250
another thing I love is the fact that,

5615
02:48:04,251 --> 02:48:04,690
uh,

5616
02:48:04,690 --> 02:48:04,910
how,

5617
02:48:04,910 --> 02:48:09,910
how UFO phenomenon has just disappeared
with the advent of everybody having a

5618
02:48:10,431 --> 02:48:12,080
phone and a camera and stuff.

5619
02:48:12,290 --> 02:48:12,590
Like,

5620
02:48:12,590 --> 02:48:15,020
I think that killed the UFO thing.

5621
02:48:15,130 --> 02:48:15,530
It,

5622
02:48:15,530 --> 02:48:18,260
cause now anything that
happens is on camera.

5623
02:48:18,590 --> 02:48:19,423
Anything.

5624
02:48:19,430 --> 02:48:21,350
You can't do anything
without it being on camera.

5625
02:48:21,590 --> 02:48:23,750
The second something happens to 20 people,

5626
02:48:23,751 --> 02:48:25,970
at least they're holding
their fucking phone up.

5627
02:48:26,540 --> 02:48:29,360
Now you would think if you have photos
were gone around with everybody having a

5628
02:48:29,361 --> 02:48:34,361
camera now there would be so many
great UFO videos and there's none.

5629
02:48:34,850 --> 02:48:36,380
There's a few fake ones.

5630
02:48:36,650 --> 02:48:38,750
There's like fake wines
that have been done,

5631
02:48:38,950 --> 02:48:39,200
um,

5632
02:48:39,200 --> 02:48:40,650
on after effects and you know,

5633
02:48:40,880 --> 02:48:44,840
great production companies that put out
great shaky fucking things and it looks,

5634
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:45,830
it looks pretty cool,

5635
02:48:46,280 --> 02:48:50,690
but there are no fucking like
go to youtube and go authentic.

5636
02:48:50,870 --> 02:48:52,490
Like it's just not happening.

5637
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:52,940
No.

5638
02:48:52,940 --> 02:48:54,260
You would think it'd be great.

5639
02:48:54,261 --> 02:48:55,940
Like finally everyone's got a camera.

5640
02:48:55,941 --> 02:48:58,370
We're going to see these
motherfuckers gone.

5641
02:48:58,460 --> 02:48:59,150
It's true.

5642
02:48:59,150 --> 02:48:59,821
It's so true.

5643
02:48:59,821 --> 02:49:00,080
I mean,

5644
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:04,010
we're seeing videos of mountain lions
and fucking parking lots and crazy.

5645
02:49:04,250 --> 02:49:06,590
There was a mountain line in
San Jose on someone's car.

5646
02:49:06,591 --> 02:49:07,060
They caught it.

5647
02:49:07,060 --> 02:49:08,340
A security camera is standing

5648
02:49:08,340 --> 02:49:09,300
on the hood of his car.

5649
02:49:09,870 --> 02:49:10,890
That's scary.

5650
02:49:10,920 --> 02:49:11,910
Cat Man.

5651
02:49:11,911 --> 02:49:12,900
A big Beavis,

5652
02:49:12,901 --> 02:49:14,490
a big giant beavers.

5653
02:49:14,670 --> 02:49:16,680
You'll see the Hawk that
took out the little drone.

5654
02:49:17,010 --> 02:49:17,430
No,

5655
02:49:17,430 --> 02:49:19,410
that's one of the videos up today.

5656
02:49:19,440 --> 02:49:24,440
I think it just today or yesterday down
in some fucking guy has gone what is

5657
02:49:24,811 --> 02:49:28,800
drawn and you see a hawk kind of going
around this thing comes at the drone

5658
02:49:28,950 --> 02:49:30,480
clause fucking out.

5659
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:32,640
Wham hits the fucking thing.

5660
02:49:33,120 --> 02:49:33,953
It's great.

5661
02:49:34,260 --> 02:49:35,093
It's great.

5662
02:49:35,100 --> 02:49:35,970
Let's end on that.

5663
02:49:36,150 --> 02:49:36,331
Yeah.

5664
02:49:36,331 --> 02:49:37,400
If you could find it,

5665
02:49:38,010 --> 02:49:38,843
you'd love it.

5666
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:42,580
It's nature saying fuck
you technology off.

5667
02:49:42,680 --> 02:49:44,160
I'll show you his boss up here.

5668
02:49:44,780 --> 02:49:46,500
It's arrival.

5669
02:49:46,501 --> 02:49:46,831
Yes.

5670
02:49:46,831 --> 02:49:49,080
It's a rival for another hawks affections.

5671
02:49:50,330 --> 02:49:51,690
That's fantastic though.

5672
02:49:51,691 --> 02:49:52,110
Man.

5673
02:49:52,110 --> 02:49:55,020
Walks by my house while
he's fuck with the crows.

5674
02:49:55,170 --> 02:49:55,621
Yeah.

5675
02:49:55,621 --> 02:49:57,660
Hawks and crows to fuck with
each other because hawks,

5676
02:49:57,661 --> 02:49:58,450
we eat crows.

5677
02:49:58,450 --> 02:49:58,890
Yeah,

5678
02:49:58,890 --> 02:50:00,720
I saw a hawk stole one of my chickens.

5679
02:50:00,900 --> 02:50:01,540
Oh really?

5680
02:50:01,540 --> 02:50:01,830
Man.

5681
02:50:01,830 --> 02:50:05,100
One of my chickens vanished and I think
it was probably a hawk because I let

5682
02:50:05,101 --> 02:50:07,430
them roam and do most of
the area where they are.

5683
02:50:07,431 --> 02:50:11,250
These are the protected under the canopy
of oaks so the hawks can't really swoop

5684
02:50:11,251 --> 02:50:11,730
in,

5685
02:50:11,730 --> 02:50:14,190
but if the chickens get
stupid and they'd go out here,

5686
02:50:14,191 --> 02:50:15,024
the yeah,

5687
02:50:15,180 --> 02:50:16,020
you sit throughout that,

5688
02:50:16,021 --> 02:50:17,790
that drop cam that it gave you.

5689
02:50:17,791 --> 02:50:19,620
It has night vision and then it will show.

5690
02:50:19,650 --> 02:50:22,230
You could just watch it anytime
you went to a show you like,

5691
02:50:22,231 --> 02:50:25,990
it will notify you if something crazy
is happening and styles are great HD.

5692
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:26,551
Yeah,

5693
02:50:26,551 --> 02:50:27,720
that's probably a good idea.

5694
02:50:28,140 --> 02:50:30,540
I saw a big hawk fly
cross Canoga last night.

5695
02:50:30,690 --> 02:50:31,080
Yeah,

5696
02:50:31,080 --> 02:50:31,913
it was pretty cool.

5697
02:50:31,920 --> 02:50:32,041
Oh,

5698
02:50:32,041 --> 02:50:32,874
hawks are around here.

5699
02:50:32,880 --> 02:50:33,690
They just fuck it.

5700
02:50:33,690 --> 02:50:35,550
Dove down and then back up into the trees.

5701
02:50:35,551 --> 02:50:36,450
I thought instantly,

5702
02:50:36,451 --> 02:50:39,420
I thought it was a bad cause it was night
and that would have been a big fucking

5703
02:50:39,421 --> 02:50:39,960
bat.

5704
02:50:39,960 --> 02:50:41,820
They have big fucking owls out here.

5705
02:50:41,880 --> 02:50:42,510
Owls.

5706
02:50:42,510 --> 02:50:43,410
Oh my God.

5707
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:43,990
That would require,

5708
02:50:43,990 --> 02:50:44,730
maybe it was,

5709
02:50:44,730 --> 02:50:47,490
I'm not a bird owls out here
that I'm not bullshitting.

5710
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:48,420
Were like two and a half,

5711
02:50:48,421 --> 02:50:49,201
three feet tall,

5712
02:50:49,201 --> 02:50:52,080
standing on a post for days
on end just sitting down.

5713
02:50:54,010 --> 02:50:55,240
We have rubber ones,

5714
02:50:55,260 --> 02:50:56,000
subtle flavors,

5715
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:57,810
houses to keep away stupid birds.

5716
02:50:58,350 --> 02:51:00,060
We can't figure out that really knocked,

5717
02:51:00,130 --> 02:51:00,963
knockdown them.

5718
02:51:01,080 --> 02:51:05,070
Fucking guy won't leave
most uncalled Al ever.

5719
02:51:05,130 --> 02:51:07,800
Have you ever thought about setting up
out here now that you don't have to be in

5720
02:51:07,801 --> 02:51:08,440
New York?

5721
02:51:08,440 --> 02:51:08,940
Uh,

5722
02:51:08,940 --> 02:51:10,510
you know I don't have to be in New York.

5723
02:51:10,511 --> 02:51:11,760
No one that is very cold.

5724
02:51:11,761 --> 02:51:12,481
No winter.

5725
02:51:12,481 --> 02:51:13,020
I know,

5726
02:51:13,020 --> 02:51:13,853
I know.

5727
02:51:14,310 --> 02:51:14,900
I do.

5728
02:51:14,900 --> 02:51:19,800
Collaboration's shows
anytime fucking fucking,

5729
02:51:19,880 --> 02:51:21,360
but I'll take you to the range.

5730
02:51:21,650 --> 02:51:22,680
You got guns together.

5731
02:51:24,410 --> 02:51:26,700
Do you do spin a nice yarn there?

5732
02:51:27,180 --> 02:51:27,541
I,

5733
02:51:27,541 --> 02:51:27,960
uh,

5734
02:51:27,960 --> 02:51:29,250
if I did move,

5735
02:51:29,251 --> 02:51:33,750
I would consider a few other
places just because of like,

5736
02:51:33,770 --> 02:51:33,970
I,

5737
02:51:33,970 --> 02:51:38,370
I can't go to another state that just
has ridiculous gun laws like New York.

5738
02:51:38,400 --> 02:51:38,671
Well,

5739
02:51:38,671 --> 02:51:40,950
this place has better
gun laws in New York,

5740
02:51:40,980 --> 02:51:41,813
believe it or not.

5741
02:51:41,870 --> 02:51:43,400
And you him easily.

5742
02:51:43,401 --> 02:51:43,950
No Way.

5743
02:51:43,950 --> 02:51:44,131
Yeah.

5744
02:51:44,131 --> 02:51:46,020
You think you think it would be harder,

5745
02:51:46,021 --> 02:51:49,470
but you can't even walk into a gun store
in New York if you don't have a pistol

5746
02:51:49,471 --> 02:51:52,590
license for New York state in the city.

5747
02:51:52,591 --> 02:51:53,400
Forget about it.

5748
02:51:53,400 --> 02:51:54,270
In New York state,

5749
02:51:54,271 --> 02:51:55,650
let's say you go into a
gun store and you're like,

5750
02:51:55,830 --> 02:51:56,041
oh,

5751
02:51:56,041 --> 02:51:58,050
I want to see what that
Walther Ppk is like,

5752
02:51:58,051 --> 02:51:58,651
can I hold it?

5753
02:51:58,651 --> 02:51:59,370
No.

5754
02:51:59,370 --> 02:52:02,250
You can't even hold a gun
in a gun store and like,

5755
02:52:02,251 --> 02:52:02,611
Oh wow,

5756
02:52:02,611 --> 02:52:04,800
that's kinda cold without a gun license.

5757
02:52:04,801 --> 02:52:05,890
You've got show them first.

5758
02:52:05,950 --> 02:52:06,220
Yeah.

5759
02:52:06,220 --> 02:52:07,900
New York is way more,

5760
02:52:07,960 --> 02:52:09,070
way more California,

5761
02:52:09,190 --> 02:52:13,000
but California has more a cake
hunting laws in California.

5762
02:52:13,001 --> 02:52:13,480
They don't,

5763
02:52:13,480 --> 02:52:16,930
they don't all allow them to hunt a
lot of animals that are really problem

5764
02:52:16,931 --> 02:52:19,120
animals like bears and cougars,

5765
02:52:19,270 --> 02:52:19,511
these,

5766
02:52:19,511 --> 02:52:21,010
these dogs to hunt bears.

5767
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:22,630
If you don't use dogs to hunt bears,

5768
02:52:22,790 --> 02:52:23,170
there's,

5769
02:52:23,170 --> 02:52:23,950
there's really,

5770
02:52:23,950 --> 02:52:26,410
there's three ways to
hunt bears spot and stalk,

5771
02:52:26,411 --> 02:52:27,310
which is really tough.

5772
02:52:27,580 --> 02:52:28,900
You got to find them and stock them.

5773
02:52:28,901 --> 02:52:29,550
And Woods,

5774
02:52:29,550 --> 02:52:30,383
it doesn't work.

5775
02:52:30,600 --> 02:52:34,870
Use It on like hillsides and in areas
where they're gonna be out eating berries

5776
02:52:34,871 --> 02:52:39,280
or like grizzlies in large Tundra
areas or you gotta use bait.

5777
02:52:39,430 --> 02:52:42,250
We have to leave bait out for them to
bear is completely vague and then you tell

5778
02:52:42,251 --> 02:52:43,240
them it's the only way to do it.

5779
02:52:43,540 --> 02:52:45,310
Like it's cheating when
you use bait for fish,

5780
02:52:46,580 --> 02:52:47,560
that's cheating too.

5781
02:52:47,930 --> 02:52:49,240
He's got fucking answer.

5782
02:52:49,240 --> 02:52:49,721
I love it.

5783
02:52:49,721 --> 02:52:51,190
I mean it is kind of cheating,

5784
02:52:52,480 --> 02:52:56,180
but how else are you gonna
get him a really good beer?

5785
02:52:56,940 --> 02:52:59,470
You don't use bait for most animals.

5786
02:53:00,490 --> 02:53:02,860
Most animals it's illegal.

5787
02:53:02,890 --> 02:53:03,011
Well,

5788
02:53:03,011 --> 02:53:06,070
there's some like Texas that kind of
allow you to do with it or fuck you want,

5789
02:53:06,100 --> 02:53:08,160
you could use bait for
deer like they have,

5790
02:53:08,430 --> 02:53:10,960
like you'll leave out corn and fucking
shoot him in the head and they go to,

5791
02:53:11,440 --> 02:53:14,110
I think it's fair if you put
the bait for the bear on a hook,

5792
02:53:14,710 --> 02:53:15,251
the land,

5793
02:53:15,251 --> 02:53:16,084
I'm like a fish

5794
02:53:18,680 --> 02:53:23,680
caught on his lip that big fuck it's
gone under the leaves smartbear.

5795
02:53:25,350 --> 02:53:27,410
We're gonna need a bigger tree stand.

5796
02:53:28,140 --> 02:53:28,973
Yeah.

5797
02:53:29,340 --> 02:53:29,920
Um,

5798
02:53:29,920 --> 02:53:30,920
but outlines,

5799
02:53:30,940 --> 02:53:34,150
they stopped hunting them altogether
and there is so prevalent now that the a

5800
02:53:34,151 --> 02:53:38,080
six year old kid get attacked and
fucking Cupertino with a fucking apple

5801
02:53:38,081 --> 02:53:39,520
campuses in Cupertino.

5802
02:53:39,640 --> 02:53:40,260
Wow.

5803
02:53:40,260 --> 02:53:41,620
Same town as the apple campus.

5804
02:53:41,621 --> 02:53:43,270
A six year old got attacked
by a mountain lion.

5805
02:53:43,660 --> 02:53:44,493
They're everywhere.

5806
02:53:44,540 --> 02:53:44,880
Yeah.

5807
02:53:44,880 --> 02:53:46,690
There's this one ranch that I hunt at.

5808
02:53:46,810 --> 02:53:50,800
They have a trail cam up at this ranch
and they caught 16 different mountain

5809
02:53:50,801 --> 02:53:52,000
lions on camp,

5810
02:53:52,001 --> 02:53:52,834
on the calves.

5811
02:53:52,930 --> 02:53:54,540
16 different mountain.

5812
02:53:54,541 --> 02:53:55,091
It's right.

5813
02:53:55,091 --> 02:53:55,381
And,

5814
02:53:55,381 --> 02:53:58,360
and people that get eaten
by the mountain lions,

5815
02:53:59,310 --> 02:54:01,900
they're doing exactly what
the mountain lion loves,

5816
02:54:02,140 --> 02:54:03,760
like running or biking.

5817
02:54:03,761 --> 02:54:04,570
It's always like,

5818
02:54:04,570 --> 02:54:04,751
yeah,

5819
02:54:04,751 --> 02:54:06,100
I took a jog in the hills,

5820
02:54:06,330 --> 02:54:07,600
but mount line just sees like,

5821
02:54:07,780 --> 02:54:08,171
oh,

5822
02:54:08,171 --> 02:54:09,004
this is great.

5823
02:54:09,070 --> 02:54:10,600
They can be throw something for your toy.

5824
02:54:10,630 --> 02:54:10,960
Yeah.

5825
02:54:10,960 --> 02:54:13,990
Throw a toy to a cat and
I'm watch what he does.

5826
02:54:14,110 --> 02:54:16,450
They're so God damn strong to Q magic,

5827
02:54:16,480 --> 02:54:20,110
the cat that's as strong as a house
cat but weighs a hundred pounds.

5828
02:54:20,140 --> 02:54:20,700
Yeah,

5829
02:54:20,700 --> 02:54:22,900
just it fucks things up all day.

5830
02:54:22,901 --> 02:54:23,770
That's what it does.

5831
02:54:23,830 --> 02:54:26,800
It sound like this is the first time
it's ever killed anything when it's face.

5832
02:54:27,100 --> 02:54:30,310
It's been getting it's food delivered
like Beavis has and a nice little aluminum

5833
02:54:30,311 --> 02:54:31,144
tray.

5834
02:54:31,240 --> 02:54:31,571
No,

5835
02:54:31,571 --> 02:54:32,000
it's,

5836
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:33,010
it's fucking food.

5837
02:54:33,011 --> 02:54:36,160
As he catches his food with
its face catches fucking food.

5838
02:54:36,570 --> 02:54:39,280
You see that the guy that got
in the cage with the tiger?

5839
02:54:39,370 --> 02:54:39,750
Yes.

5840
02:54:39,750 --> 02:54:40,040
And,

5841
02:54:40,040 --> 02:54:40,930
and he was,

5842
02:54:41,170 --> 02:54:45,370
he was cowering in the corner with
the tiger like two feet away from him,

5843
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:48,820
just staring at him for 15
minutes before the tiger,

5844
02:54:49,090 --> 02:54:53,020
bit him that 15 minute looking at that.

5845
02:54:53,050 --> 02:54:55,150
There are times I look at
Beavis his face and go,

5846
02:54:55,151 --> 02:54:55,810
oh shit,

5847
02:54:55,810 --> 02:54:56,800
I don't even want to fuck with them.

5848
02:54:57,010 --> 02:54:59,650
And it's a cat because
he's got those fucking,

5849
02:54:59,740 --> 02:55:03,260
his eyes turned completely black and
he's got that look on his face like,

5850
02:55:03,261 --> 02:55:03,381
yeah,

5851
02:55:03,381 --> 02:55:04,220
I could just lunge it.

5852
02:55:04,221 --> 02:55:05,330
Your eyeballs right now,

5853
02:55:06,050 --> 02:55:07,520
imagine up tiger head,

5854
02:55:07,521 --> 02:55:09,830
which is if you've seen
a full grown tiger,

5855
02:55:09,860 --> 02:55:11,720
they heads are fucking bizarre.

5856
02:55:11,720 --> 02:55:12,490
Big,

5857
02:55:12,490 --> 02:55:16,400
just from side to side and
and that thing just like,

5858
02:55:16,640 --> 02:55:16,881
all right,

5859
02:55:16,881 --> 02:55:17,714
is it still there?

5860
02:55:17,720 --> 02:55:18,131
You'll look at it.

5861
02:55:18,131 --> 02:55:18,320
Yeah,

5862
02:55:18,320 --> 02:55:18,990
it's still,

5863
02:55:18,990 --> 02:55:22,370
he was also praying a lot
and we his hands up and down.

5864
02:55:22,490 --> 02:55:23,323
He was like being with,

5865
02:55:24,660 --> 02:55:27,050
I'd find God at that point somehow.

5866
02:55:27,110 --> 02:55:27,450
I don't know.

5867
02:55:27,450 --> 02:55:27,831
What are we?

5868
02:55:27,831 --> 02:55:28,520
God,

5869
02:55:28,520 --> 02:55:29,750
there's nothing you can do.

5870
02:55:29,780 --> 02:55:30,830
The amount of power,

5871
02:55:30,880 --> 02:55:33,080
that's just unbelievable power,

5872
02:55:33,140 --> 02:55:33,973
that muscle.

5873
02:55:34,580 --> 02:55:36,800
We are very weak and the animal world.

5874
02:55:36,801 --> 02:55:41,480
If we didn't have a a few fucking
sparkles of miracle up in our head,

5875
02:55:41,481 --> 02:55:42,440
we would be done.

5876
02:55:42,530 --> 02:55:42,651
Well.

5877
02:55:42,651 --> 02:55:47,390
The idea is those sparks of miracle with
sent us down this road of decay for our

5878
02:55:47,391 --> 02:55:49,430
bodies develop this fucking soft,

5879
02:55:49,431 --> 02:55:52,610
fleshy outer layer that
tears on rocks and twigs.

5880
02:55:53,030 --> 02:55:55,250
Just looking like look at a chimpanzee.

5881
02:55:55,251 --> 02:55:57,320
Just fucking going through trees,

5882
02:55:57,321 --> 02:55:58,910
hitting sharp branches,

5883
02:55:59,060 --> 02:55:59,781
nothing there.

5884
02:55:59,781 --> 02:56:02,540
Made a leather Temaze leather with muscle,

5885
02:56:02,541 --> 02:56:07,070
crowded fucking thick tendons and we
don't even understand like they have

5886
02:56:07,071 --> 02:56:09,200
tendons that are so
much stronger than ours.

5887
02:56:09,260 --> 02:56:09,521
Oh yeah.

5888
02:56:09,521 --> 02:56:11,350
You think they ever wake up just out.

5889
02:56:11,600 --> 02:56:12,050
Ah,

5890
02:56:12,050 --> 02:56:12,760
when often,

5891
02:56:12,760 --> 02:56:12,881
oh,

5892
02:56:12,881 --> 02:56:17,120
what happened now they grab a branch and
launch themselves into the air with it.

5893
02:56:17,460 --> 02:56:22,460
They throw themselves through the sky
will catch things and wash skin like

5894
02:56:23,481 --> 02:56:24,780
fucking easy rider.

5895
02:56:26,150 --> 02:56:27,380
So different than us.

5896
02:56:27,410 --> 02:56:29,330
We're just bags of Jello.

5897
02:56:30,100 --> 02:56:31,910
Just fleshy.

5898
02:56:32,330 --> 02:56:36,380
I had a two year old chimp on
news radio once it was an episode.

5899
02:56:36,410 --> 02:56:38,420
I don't think we will even
wound up using the scene,

5900
02:56:38,421 --> 02:56:39,500
but they are adorable,

5901
02:56:39,530 --> 02:56:40,190
adorable.

5902
02:56:40,190 --> 02:56:43,760
But it was a tiny little champ and it
fucking slap me in the back and I was

5903
02:56:43,761 --> 02:56:43,971
like,

5904
02:56:43,971 --> 02:56:45,410
Holy Shit.

5905
02:56:45,760 --> 02:56:46,760
It was hanging on to me.

5906
02:56:46,761 --> 02:56:47,594
It was being cute.

5907
02:56:47,720 --> 02:56:51,200
But then it just whacked me in the back
and I couldn't believe how hard it hit

5908
02:56:51,201 --> 02:56:51,351
me.

5909
02:56:51,351 --> 02:56:51,860
I was like,

5910
02:56:51,860 --> 02:56:53,270
this is fucking crazy.

5911
02:56:53,271 --> 02:56:54,021
Even the small,

5912
02:56:54,021 --> 02:56:55,490
cause we had one on the ONA show,

5913
02:56:55,491 --> 02:56:56,030
Jimmy.

5914
02:56:56,030 --> 02:57:00,200
Jimmy had worked with a chimp on some
MTV thing and he found out that the chimp

5915
02:57:00,201 --> 02:57:01,034
was in town,

5916
02:57:01,130 --> 02:57:03,800
so they invited the chimp
on the show and it was,

5917
02:57:03,801 --> 02:57:04,100
uh,

5918
02:57:04,100 --> 02:57:06,110
probably a couple of years old,

5919
02:57:06,111 --> 02:57:06,950
maybe three.

5920
02:57:07,370 --> 02:57:10,280
And you could just feel
like you feel his shoulder.

5921
02:57:10,400 --> 02:57:10,940
It's different.

5922
02:57:10,940 --> 02:57:15,500
And it's this rock muscles
tight fucking muscle.

5923
02:57:15,590 --> 02:57:16,670
It's totally different.

5924
02:57:16,970 --> 02:57:17,330
Yeah,

5925
02:57:17,330 --> 02:57:17,990
we're weak.

5926
02:57:17,990 --> 02:57:18,180
We're,

5927
02:57:18,180 --> 02:57:19,910
but we have guns and we went,

5928
02:57:19,911 --> 02:57:23,870
we have guns and we'd holdings
tactics and backup generators,

5929
02:57:23,871 --> 02:57:24,980
propane tanks,

5930
02:57:25,590 --> 02:57:26,490
iPhone os,

5931
02:57:26,540 --> 02:57:27,200
sonar,

5932
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:28,550
electric toothbrushes.

5933
02:57:29,730 --> 02:57:32,210
I got quince stuck in
my head now listen man.

5934
02:57:32,240 --> 02:57:33,430
I'm glad we got to,

5935
02:57:33,440 --> 02:57:34,191
we're out of time,

5936
02:57:34,191 --> 02:57:35,660
but I'm glad you're doing your show.

5937
02:57:35,661 --> 02:57:38,570
I'm so glad you're doing it
the way you're doing it too.

5938
02:57:38,571 --> 02:57:41,630
And not just getting hired by some other
radio station that's going to fucking

5939
02:57:41,840 --> 02:57:42,530
hamstring.

5940
02:57:42,530 --> 02:57:42,830
Yeah,

5941
02:57:42,830 --> 02:57:43,910
it'd be in the same boat.

5942
02:57:43,911 --> 02:57:45,030
I'd be in the same boat in,

5943
02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:45,741
in no time.

5944
02:57:45,741 --> 02:57:46,131
I think.

5945
02:57:46,131 --> 02:57:49,390
So it's kind of Nice that
this worked out and it's,

5946
02:57:49,391 --> 02:57:53,750
it is odd that the inspiration that you
got for this from me doing the compound

5947
02:57:53,751 --> 02:57:58,310
show and then you doing this was an
inspiration to go back to actually do the

5948
02:57:58,340 --> 02:58:02,010
full show on a scheduled basis because
I think it was you that told me at some

5949
02:58:02,010 --> 02:58:02,843
point you got to,

5950
02:58:03,060 --> 02:58:05,760
you got to put these
things on at the same time.

5951
02:58:05,761 --> 02:58:06,870
Like if you're going to do it,

5952
02:58:06,871 --> 02:58:07,621
like when I'm going to do it,

5953
02:58:07,621 --> 02:58:10,590
it's gotta be from four
to 6:00 PM Eastern,

5954
02:58:10,710 --> 02:58:11,610
the be the keys.

5955
02:58:11,620 --> 02:58:12,660
It's just consistency,

5956
02:58:12,661 --> 02:58:13,494
distance,

5957
02:58:13,620 --> 02:58:16,500
make sure that people get into it
and it becomes a part of their day.

5958
02:58:17,070 --> 02:58:19,470
And it's very rewarding for you too,

5959
02:58:19,471 --> 02:58:19,951
I'm sure.

5960
02:58:19,951 --> 02:58:20,161
Right?

5961
02:58:20,161 --> 02:58:20,460
Yeah,

5962
02:58:20,460 --> 02:58:21,030
absolutely.

5963
02:58:21,030 --> 02:58:23,370
Back to it's fucking coal.

5964
02:58:23,400 --> 02:58:24,960
It's just fun to do.

5965
02:58:25,230 --> 02:58:30,150
I don't think I ever did so much
preparation for any other show.

5966
02:58:30,151 --> 02:58:30,960
I did.

5967
02:58:30,960 --> 02:58:31,141
I,

5968
02:58:31,141 --> 02:58:31,801
and I'm honest,

5969
02:58:31,801 --> 02:58:32,081
it's,

5970
02:58:32,081 --> 02:58:35,280
it's like I would go in and not that
I would phone it in or anything,

5971
02:58:35,281 --> 02:58:40,170
but it was kind of easy to sit there
with the likes of a Jim Norton and bounce

5972
02:58:40,171 --> 02:58:43,470
shit back and forth and just
start laughing our asses off.

5973
02:58:43,750 --> 02:58:44,870
Goofin um,

5974
02:58:45,030 --> 02:58:45,863
when,

5975
02:58:46,350 --> 02:58:47,850
when it's your show though,

5976
02:58:48,660 --> 02:58:49,650
I want stuff.

5977
02:58:49,650 --> 02:58:51,690
I want to know that
I'm talking about this,

5978
02:58:51,691 --> 02:58:51,931
this,

5979
02:58:51,931 --> 02:58:54,570
that I want to be very
interactive with the audience.

5980
02:58:54,571 --> 02:58:55,650
We're doing a pal talk,

5981
02:58:55,950 --> 02:58:56,310
um,

5982
02:58:56,310 --> 02:58:56,871
thing where,

5983
02:58:56,871 --> 02:58:58,320
where pal talk is joining us.

5984
02:58:58,510 --> 02:58:58,680
Uh,

5985
02:58:58,680 --> 02:58:59,550
so subscribers,

5986
02:58:59,551 --> 02:59:01,470
we'll be able to go to a room in pal talk.

5987
02:59:01,650 --> 02:59:03,810
Now I'll be able to just
pull up their cameras,

5988
02:59:03,811 --> 02:59:07,950
put him on my virtual screen and have a
discussion with these people instead of

5989
02:59:07,951 --> 02:59:09,690
just primarily going to the phones,

5990
02:59:10,050 --> 02:59:11,100
we get interactivity.

5991
02:59:11,101 --> 02:59:12,500
Or if I could just want to surprise them.

5992
02:59:12,501 --> 02:59:14,610
If someone was just
sitting there jacking off,

5993
02:59:14,700 --> 02:59:15,121
Bam,

5994
02:59:15,121 --> 02:59:16,170
we can pop that off and go,

5995
02:59:16,171 --> 02:59:16,730
hey Nance,

5996
02:59:16,730 --> 02:59:17,563
all want to get done.

5997
02:59:17,700 --> 02:59:21,300
And then Jimmy stopped.com go watch it.

5998
02:59:21,550 --> 02:59:22,360
Subscribe.

5999
02:59:22,360 --> 02:59:23,121
Be a part of it.

6000
02:59:23,121 --> 02:59:23,730
It's only seven.
