1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,930
All right,
we're live.

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,920
All Right,
ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:03,270
Vinny shoreman.
How are you buddy?

4
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,110
Hello.
I'm fine.

5
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:04,440
How are you?

6
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,120
Good,
good.

7
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,790
Pull that microphone right up.
Get it right up there.

8
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,510
Um,
we just did a hypnosis is hypnosis 

9
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:13,540
session.
I will.

10
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,180
How would you call it?
Hypnotic session.

11
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,180
Just a sexual stuffed mental training 
mind stuff.

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,010
I'm vinny is the man that,
uh,

13
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,510
Joe Schilling,
uh,

14
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:26,790
experienced,
uh,

15
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,810
some fantastic results doing this with 
you.

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,450
Joe Schilling,
who's the world champion,

17
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:37,451
kickboxer beltour fighter guy who's been
in here before and he told me about you 

18
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:42,911
and you and I went back and forth on 
twitter and email and then we finally 

19
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:44,300
got together today and today's hypnosis 
session.

20
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,050
And I'm here to tell Ya,
hypnosis is real.

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,000
It does.
You definitely go under.

22
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,250
There's something happens.
You go to some weird dream.

23
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:54,280
Stay at la La land.
How long was that?

24
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:54,620
Under four.

25
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,250
Four and a half days now.
You were hungry to be honest about,

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,890
I'd say 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes.

27
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:04,900
Maybe 20 minutes.
Thirty minutes.

28
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,990
You can kind of get lost in it too,
you know,

29
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,900
it seems like it seemed like five.
No,

30
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,100
it was longer than that.
Yeah,

31
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:11,620
it was good enough.

32
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,790
It was like I remember the beginning 
part and then all of a sudden it was 

33
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:16,790
over.
I was like,

34
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,121
whoa.
And there was some weird dream state 

35
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,620
stuff going on in the middle where you 
were talking about some things,

36
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:24,900
but I was thinking about other shit,
but I was.

37
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,400
When I was thinking about shit,
I was like,

38
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:31,401
wow,
I'm in a weird state of mind right now 

39
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:31,401
while I'm thinking about these other 
things.

40
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:33,390
Like I better get back on track about 
what vinny?

41
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,100
No,
probably not.

42
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,160
I think it's funny because it's.
I've done everything that I do with my 

43
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,651
clients and you've experienced,
I've experienced and he put it right is 

44
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:42,651
weird.
Yeah.

45
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:46,290
It's weird because it's.
It works definitely works well.

46
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,010
There's different states that the brain 
operates in.

47
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:52,770
We all know that are states when you're 
stressed out their states,

48
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:57,771
when you're super happy,
there states when you're very focused 

49
00:01:57,771 --> 00:02:00,770
the states and you're in danger of the 
states and you're in love and we all 

50
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,840
know that these are weird places that 
your brain can go to.

51
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:06,990
Weird frequencies are weird vibrations,
whatever you would call it,

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,240
but to be able to manipulate it like 
that,

53
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,930
to be able to put someone into a state 
like that or help them,

54
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,390
assist them getting into a state like 
that.

55
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:20,850
That's a very,
very unique skill.

56
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,050
Yeah.
I mean,

57
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,810
oh hell hypnosis yourself at Nell's.
He's anyway,

58
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,020
so you do it.
I just guide you into it,

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,080
you know,
and give you ways of just going into 

60
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,480
hypnosis is a natural state.
Although he said,

61
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,520
we said it was talking earlier like you 
know you're driving and all of a sudden 

62
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,320
you end up there and you think shit out 
to get there.

63
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,300
I don't do that because I'm rubbish at 
driving,

64
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,520
but you know other things where you 
just.

65
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,010
It just seems it.
Televisions,

66
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:48,450
hypnosis,
music set.

67
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:53,451
Notice that all different states and 
we're all in different states all the 

68
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:53,451
time.

69
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:57,940
So I'm,
I'm like a movie that just captures you 

70
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:57,940
and you don't even realize you're 
watching it.

71
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,190
You're just totally.
You're

72
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,940
inside,
you're completely absorbed in the film.

73
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,360
That's almost like a hypnotic state.
Definitely mean clumping for Superman 

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,930
for instance.
We know safe mother's next six exist,

75
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,100
fortunately,
I'm sorry to break in one's let's mom,

76
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,160
but you know,
it's just a part and parcel of using 

77
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,330
your imagination to get you to a place 
where you want to change.

78
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,420
So,
but,

79
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,950
but that state that you achieve when 
you're,

80
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,010
when you hypnotize someone,
when you put someone in this really 

81
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,221
relaxed place and you have them focus on
very specific things and you get them to

82
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:41,791
this weird state where your mind is 
drifts off into dreamland.

83
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,760
That's very different than a movie are 
very different than driving home in your

84
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:46,990
car.
It's,

85
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:47,610
uh,
it's,

86
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,660
it's pretty intense.
Yeah,

87
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:51,730
it is.
They're all,

88
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,890
they're all imaginative processes 
anyway.

89
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,060
You know,
they're all my cheeses.

90
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,190
Processes.
But with hypnosis,

91
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,950
you focusing on a specific properly.

92
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,930
Normally,
you know,

93
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,700
you focus on a specific treatment.
So lit is the lead into it.

94
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:08,200
It depends.
It depends on what the client is.

95
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,060
Um,
I don't always use hypnosis.

96
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:12,630
I am a mind coach.
Don't class myself as a hypnotist.

97
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,170
Although hypnotherapy is part and parcel
of why date,

98
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,750
I class myself as a mind coach because 
he's different facets to it.

99
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,800
These different ways of leading people 
into fairies things and considerations 

100
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,081
about what they say,
especially using language when it's out 

101
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:29,740
of sync sort of thing.
Does it make sense?

102
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,280
And then you might have to make sense of
it and then unconsciously you 

103
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,670
unconscious mind deciphers it and gets 
you the best results really.

104
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,440
Well,
it's,

105
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:42,441
it's fascinating to me because for the 
longest time mine coaches were sort of 

106
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:46,890
unheard of in combat sports.
It was almost like it was a,

107
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:49,790
uh,
a scarlet letter or a,

108
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,150
you know,
a mark against you because you were so 

109
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,581
weak that you needed someone to figure 
out how to hypnotize you or how to talk 

110
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:01,690
you into being strong.

111
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,790
You needed a car.
You should just be a fucking man and get

112
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,200
out there and do it.
Right.

113
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:07,150
Like that was the attitude that a lot of
people had.

114
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,350
Yeah.
In England say dealt with a fucking soft

115
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,830
Glendale or.
I say that in America too.

116
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,030
Yeah.
But they don't say it with that show to 

117
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,220
say with the same company to company 
telling them from the north.

118
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,070
What I mean,
it was a yeti solid macho,

119
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,330
you know,
don't you know,

120
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,140
get on with it,
blah,

121
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:23,620
blah,
blah.

122
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,500
I've seen more people,
a lot of very,

123
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:29,730
very skilled get beat by their own self.
You say not,

124
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,670
you know their own minds and then they 
can be very.

125
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,420
It can be very hard for people.
The reason why I was going to bring that

126
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:42,421
up because I think that fighting in 
particular is probably the most 

127
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:48,781
difficult of all chosen endeavors 
outside of being a soldier is the most 

128
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:55,231
difficult of all chosen,
chosen endeavors as far as chosen goals 

129
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,280
that you're trying to accomplish.

130
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,550
What you're trying to accomplish is you 
try to use your body,

131
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,850
use your bones and your muscle to defeat
other people who are also using their 

132
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,480
bones and muscle and the techniques are 
all readily available.

133
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:14,330
There's no secrets anymore.
I mean there's a few secrets.

134
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:16,550
If you have a really good coaches,
you can get some tips,

135
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:18,710
but essentially everybody knows how to 
punch.

136
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:23,711
Everybody knows how to kick and you're 
just trying to figure out how to 

137
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:28,931
maximize your possibilities,
maximize your potential for victory and 

138
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:34,601
how to not get in your own way,
not how to not trip over your own fears 

139
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:38,951
and anxiety.
And that's where this mind coach thing 

140
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:40,370
comes into play.
And that's where I think it's applicable

141
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:45,371
not just for fighting,
but also for just life in general 

142
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,990
because I think that for a lot of 
people,

143
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,050
their success or failure,
a big part of it is predicated on how 

144
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:59,861
they view life and how they view 
themselves and how they approach each.

145
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,300
Each thing,
each obstacle,

146
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,010
each,
uh,

147
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,080
each goal,
each endeavor that they,

148
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:08,690
they,
they're attempting to,

149
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:12,020
uh,
to solve or to give their own expression

150
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:17,021
too.
And I think that if it works on 

151
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,080
fighting,
it'll probably work on anything.

152
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,380
And if you can get someone to a better 
place mentally where they can become a 

153
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,760
more effective fighter and stay out of 
their own way,

154
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,310
has terms of their anxiety and their 
fears,

155
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:33,290
like the reality of fighting is you're 
probably going to get hurt at some point

156
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,630
in time.
It's just part of what you're doing.

157
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:37,940
You're in the hurt business,
this is the hurt game,

158
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,590
and somewhere along the line you're 
going to get hit and you're,

159
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,591
you're hopefully going to hit the other 
person more than they're going to hit 

160
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:48,620
you.
But bad things happen to great fighters.

161
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,730
We've all seen it.

162
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,740
Yeah,
I mean,

163
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,620
Ace is part and parcel of everything.
You know,

164
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:56,040
if I could make.
It's not just about fires.

165
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,410
I mean I'll do what with fights is 
because I come from a background.

166
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:01,990
I've been involved in it a long time,
30 years now.

167
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,270
And um,
it's,

168
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,080
you have to find things out as you know.
Well,

169
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,110
of course,
but finding yourself as well as an 

170
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,601
opponent as well as trying to listen to 
Econ as well as hearing people scream 

171
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:18,160
your name or other people screaming for 
them or the person to kick your ass.

172
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,700
It's difficult.
You have to,

173
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,260
you have to kind of go with it,
you know,

174
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,320
and,
and control everything that you do and 

175
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,320
then try and impose what you've got to 
do on the other person.

176
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:33,350
You had doubts and fear.
They're extra weights that you carry 

177
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,950
into the ring,
yeah,

178
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,100
or into the cage and in life and again 
it's analogous to life doubts and fears 

179
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,520
on top of the reality of the difficulty 
of what are you're trying to do.

180
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,190
Whatever you're trying to do,
those doubts and fears,

181
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,400
they're like,
it's like a heavy weight vest that 

182
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,591
you're carrying on top of the burden of 
whatever you're trying to accomplish in 

183
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:57,880
the first place and for fighters it can 
be just smothering it,

184
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,450
getting it.
I mean we've.

185
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,480
We've had many instances of guys 
backstage that either didn't fight or 

186
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,320
almost didn't fight because they're 
having anxiety attacks because they were

187
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:12,321
freaking out because the moment was 
finally there and their mind was just 

188
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:15,990
running away from them.
Just your mom was trying to figure out a

189
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:18,390
way out of this.
We can figure out a way out of this.

190
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,570
All we have to do is just go crazy here 
and the doctor will come over and you 

191
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,500
know,
how about you have a few heart 

192
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:27,500
palpitations and fall down and you can't
breathe,

193
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:27,500
and then the doctor's going to rescue 
you.

194
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,960
Fighting to find something wrong.
With me,

195
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,970
because a male,
everyone's considered though I did the 

196
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:35,970
same thought,
you know,

197
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,741
if he sees something male,
male and then you don't have to go in 

198
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:40,300
there,
but you know,

199
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,680
it's about controlling the fight so it 
wouldn't last in the changing rooms 

200
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,640
sometimes.
A lot of the time,

201
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,010
you know,

202
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,690
be the most self confident you can be 
the most confident motherfucker on 

203
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,160
earth.
But if you're fighting Anderson Silva 

204
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,781
and his prime and you're not that good,
you're probably still going to get lit 

205
00:09:58,781 --> 00:09:59,900
up and that's a problem.

206
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,060
I mean,
you can make yourself look as bad as you

207
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:04,490
could as you would if you didn't do 
anything about,

208
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,300
you know,
maybe you know,

209
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:09,560
there's only so much.
Yeah,

210
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:10,400
there is.
Yeah,

211
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:10,970
there is.
I mean,

212
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:13,340
not everyone's going to be a champion.
That's fact.

213
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,590
That is a finale,
you know,

214
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,390
but they don't throw these belts around 
day.

215
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,880
The UFC and the WBC boxing,
they don't just give you about,

216
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,780
you know,
and there's always.

217
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,460
But from my point of view,
I like seeing people conquer,

218
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,240
share that really debilitating.
Whether they win,

219
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:32,750
lose or draw.
Sometimes it's respective.

220
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,940
It's the experience,
all of them saying,

221
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,500
I did lot better than I thought I would 
do when you know and and all that sort 

222
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:40,500
of stuff,
and they can live with it.

223
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,580
Some people lose and they just never 
forget it and it can hold them for real.

224
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:45,830
That's not real.

225
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,470
Yeah.
They defined themselves.

226
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:53,530
That's a real issue with human beings.
They define themselves with their past 

227
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,071
failures.
Even though they've learned from those 

228
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:57,071
mistakes,
they always look at themselves.

229
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:57,320
It's like,
God,

230
00:10:57,321 --> 00:11:01,270
I'm the guy who did this.
I'm the guy who shit his pants.

231
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,800
I'm the guy who got in that car 
accident.

232
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:06,170
I'm the guy who showed up late and got 
her.

233
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:11,190
I got fired from my job and you become 
instead of a human being who has a 

234
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:17,290
lifelong,
just a giant string of experiences,

235
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,720
a lot of them that you've learned from 
and that you're better because of 

236
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,170
instead you have the sting,
like the emotional sting of those 

237
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,590
failures that just haunt people and 
that's very common with people that they

238
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,600
get haunted.
That's why some people are haunted by 

239
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:34,600
high school,
by,

240
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,130
by grammar school and high school 
bullies being bullied,

241
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,430
like define them during their formative 
state.

242
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,730
And uh,
you know,

243
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,290
I've known a lot of fighters who,
they've carried chips on their shoulders

244
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,790
deep into their forties from being 
bullied when they were in high school.

245
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,900
Funny Story,
um,

246
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,220
when I lived in a place in England 
called Michael's field and it's on a big

247
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:57,850
hill where I used to live on a scene.
The guy who's lived next door to me,

248
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,040
his mom use limits,
tells me Easter lived out as well.

249
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:05,041
He was 60 something like that and I seen
him at the top of the road and he was 

250
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,821
sort of surprised and he was looking 
down at the bottom of the road like 

251
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:10,921
this.
He was looking again and he just stood 

252
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:10,921
there and I understand what you're 
doing.

253
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:15,580
And when these two guys down there,
they used to bully me at school and my 

254
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,080
firm to go 60,
60 years of age still I'm waiting for 

255
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,260
them.
He was waiting for them to go.

256
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:25,261
Billy's name is.
And he was just stood there and waited 

257
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:27,031
for them to go that I,
I liked to change and I will look to a 

258
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,010
change.
It's sad.

259
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,470
Think about it.
It's a long time,

260
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:30,130
you know,
for him to,

261
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,610
you know,
and he's so small town Michael's feel 

262
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:35,610
worries to live.
So he's probably bumped into them.

263
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,380
It's probably avoided them in the store 
and shops or whatever for 42,

264
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,300
43 years.
He says maybe,

265
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,800
maybe,
maybe more because before then.

266
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,710
And I hate that.
I just,

267
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,600
you know,
it's sad,

268
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:47,470
it's real sad

269
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:53,010
situation,
but it also seems to be bizarrely and 

270
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,891
cruelly,
a part of human nature and common part 

271
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:56,770
of animal nature with the animals.
Fuck with other animals.

272
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:02,070
They try to find the pecking order and 
it motivates the weak ones to be strong.

273
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,260
It motivates people to stand up for 
themselves.

274
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,530
And that's where the bullying is a 
horrible thing.

275
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:11,590
But bullying is also the reason why a 
lot of great fighters exist.

276
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,230
Guys like George St Pierre.
I mean he's pretty open about it.

277
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:19,231
Like the reason why he became a great 
fighter because he was tired of people 

278
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,560
fucking with him and he might not have 
ever become the guy who he became if it 

279
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,511
wasn't for that pressure,
if it wasn't for those obstacles that 

280
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:27,700
are thrown in front of his face,
you know,

281
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:30,160
and that's,
it's a very,

282
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,290
it's,
it's,

283
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,740
it's unfortunate that it happens.
But objectively,

284
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:38,950
if you step back and look at just life 
itself,

285
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,540
it seems to be an inexorable part of our
existence on this planet.

286
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,390
There's a pull and a push and if there's
no one pushing,

287
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:48,390
there's no Poland and if there's no,
you know,

288
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,930
you know what I'm saying?
If there's no,

289
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:55,150
there's no negative.
Oftentimes the positive doesn't reach 

290
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,150
the same heights.

291
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,190
No,
it doesn't.

292
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,010
Um,
and a lot of cases.

293
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,820
But if he can chip away at it or at 
least change some perspective on it for 

294
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:07,770
a person.
This is why someone said to me,

295
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:12,771
one,
certainly want it to be a mind coach 

296
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:12,930
that I'm only gonna work with athletes.
I'm not going to,

297
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,620
I'm going to do therapy.
So all therapy cell therapy,

298
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,340
regardless if fighters,
it's not always about them being noticed

299
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,350
about fight in the finders and scatter.
It might be something to do with the 

300
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:24,350
girlfriend,
a loss of a family member,

301
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,440
whatever,
you know,

302
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:29,490
it goes back way back to solve part of 
people's journeys.

303
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,830
It's all part of people being who they 
are.

304
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:37,310
Therapy has a negative connotation in a 
lot of people's minds because they 

305
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,390
connected to self indulgence.
Like go,

306
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,400
you're going to go to therapy every day 
and just whine and bitch about your 

307
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:43,400
life.
And Yeah,

308
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,820
we've all met people that are doing 
that.

309
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:50,230
You know,
we've all met people that are just 

310
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,311
locked.
So for them it's sort of more about 

311
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:54,440
having opportunity to use someone to 
talk about themselves.

312
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:59,441
It's an ego trip in a lot of ways.
Instead of trying to solve whatever,

313
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,390
whatever influences that they have 
control over them.

314
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:05,780
Say that again.

315
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,930
He gets to know as a mind coach.
She gets to know who will do carry on 

316
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,510
doing that behavior,
that secondary gay.

317
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,790
Some people do their behavior just for,
again,

318
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,850
just to,
you know,

319
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,840
get themselves where they want to get is
get really.

320
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:23,841
Once again,
it's a kind of decide from that I don't 

321
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:24,210
really,
I don't play that game.

322
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
I just kept them,
you know,

323
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,300
really,
you know,

324
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,880
and it just kind of,
they can be kind of tough with it,

325
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,800
but you know,
if you want them to change,

326
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:33,420
if they don't want to change,
nothing you can do,

327
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,050
you know,
I don't want,

328
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,700
I don't have these dragged out long 
therapy sessions of and then this and 

329
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:44,880
this and this happened in the up and I 
try and get right to it,

330
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,310
right to the right to the core of it.
And I'm like,

331
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,820
because the way I was trained,
I was trained by a guy called Collin Mci

332
00:15:50,821 --> 00:15:54,060
who's absolutely like Yoda,
you know,

333
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:57,870
my teacher and I was trained.
I was trained that way and they see us.

334
00:15:57,871 --> 00:15:58,710
Good success.

335
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,520
And you,
how did you get involved with him?

336
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,000
Um,
I got involved with Colin.

337
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,740
Uh,
I started,

338
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,160
I went to a seminar many years ago by a 
guy called Keith Mayer and I was a bad 

339
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:16,100
time in my life,
been a bit of an idiot in snow,

340
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,430
in dancing powder,
etc.

341
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:19,810
I wasn't being the best it could be 
under.

342
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,910
I went to a seminar,
Keith Mayer loved it,

343
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,630
felt great,
didn't know why.

344
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:25,920
I just really started reading books,
everything,

345
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,020
Dr.
Wayne Dyer and all sorts of things like 

346
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,020
that.
And then,

347
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,020
um,
I got older,

348
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,950
I wanted to do a course with a,
with a company and the company was gone,

349
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,970
but I found out about colin and that was
it.

350
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,170
Since then he's become a friend and 
we're like east,

351
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,390
just small,
super small.

352
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,460
Well,
it's interesting because your main 

353
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,030
pursuit with this or your main focus 
with this as fighters,

354
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:58,210
so you're,
you're dealing with a very concentrated 

355
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,791
version of this kind of problem solving 
because of the fact that the existence 

356
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:03,440
is so intense.
It's so difficult.

357
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:08,441
Psychologically.
It's so difficult emotionally and it's 

358
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:09,620
very difficult physically as well.
There's so many dIscipline.

359
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,040
There's.
So,

360
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,940
there's so many factors involved in,
in being a successful fighter.

361
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,440
And you were involved in probably like 
the most,

362
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,040
the most concentrated form of dealing 
with anxiety and problem solving and the

363
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,580
ability to see results.

364
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,360
It's,
yeah.

365
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,610
To be honest,
I never thought of it like that.

366
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,970
I didn't because I've been around it so 
long.

367
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,820
I never really thought of it like that.
I just do what I do.

368
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,030
Well,
if you think about it,

369
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:41,031
like the person,
like say if a guy was I'm a banker or an

370
00:17:41,251 --> 00:17:42,840
insurance salesman or something like 
that,

371
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:47,841
and they had a bunch of issues that are 
Keeping theM back from being successful 

372
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:47,910
in their chosen endeavor.
The,

373
00:17:47,911 --> 00:17:48,650
their,
you know,

374
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,220
their failure pro

375
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,080
or con is only financial,
you know,

376
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,260
relative to them,
isn't it?

377
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,330
It is relative to that.
The intensity of it.

378
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:02,370
Yeah,
like the intensity of a guy going into 

379
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,341
battle like yourself about to go and 
trying to find coughs and reasons why 

380
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:07,941
someone's going to step in and rescue 
you from what is ultimately your entire 

381
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:12,351
focus for the last six to eight weeks.
You've been ready for this one moment 

382
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,140
and the moments here and you're ready to
get the fuck out of there.

383
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:18,470
Right.
There's nothing like that in the world 

384
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,470
of noodles.
Bankers suppose is not because I've been

385
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,700
around so long.
It's been around it a way.

386
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,840
Tie sound.
So many scenes.

387
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:25,710
How many read he could fight isn't a 
gym.

388
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,850
I also think in pot shop clenched.
Every famous sweet spiring was on point 

389
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,960
and then just to see this different.
I think of it like they should.

390
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,990
I really like making a really nice 
wedding cake and then when you can show 

391
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,670
it to the people are going to the 
wedding just fucking squash yet.

392
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,950
So I always felt like,
to me it's just like just destroyed our 

393
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,061
own creation.
All the stuff that they've done in the 

394
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:50,061
gym.
Maybe a better analogy is you will,

395
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,070
you will that wedding cake out and it 
melts instantly under the hot lights on 

396
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,871
the stage,
which is really what it is because when 

397
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,941
you have it in a regular room,
the lights aren't that hot and when you 

398
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:01,941
have someone in the gym,
I mean,

399
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,960
there's a lot of pressure sparring and 
the gym of course,

400
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,680
you know,
there's a lot of,

401
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:07,770
uh,
there's great fighters.

402
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,580
You're working out with people who were 
very dangerous.

403
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,060
There's a lot of expectatIons and 
anxiety,

404
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:14,670
but it's nothing compared to an actual 
fight itself.

405
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,100
That's when everything's ramped up.
Yeah,

406
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,170
I mean,
especially like you said,

407
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:24,171
there's people that I've been bullied as
well and you have to consider who you 

408
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:27,471
are.
You have to consider everything about 

409
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:27,471
yourself,
you know,

410
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:28,140
going on that stage,
going into that lion's den,

411
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:29,120
so to speak.
And you know,

412
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,340
the gladiatorial sort of archetype of it
all.

413
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,240
But um,
it's,

414
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,170
it's difficult,
but there is techniques at work really,

415
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:42,171
really well maintained techniques that 
work really well to get the person out 

416
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:46,641
of these negative states of mind,
these negative patterns to get them to 

417
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:49,941
get them because what can happen as you 
can go away with a train of thought so 

418
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:53,230
it might be five and goes on and on gets
bigger and bigger and bigger than the 

419
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,211
south salt gets really intense so it 
trips you up completely and then can 

420
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,720
overthrow you to make you a minimum of 
what you can actually achieve.

421
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,340
You know what I mean?
And you've recently started working with

422
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:09,600
my friend ian mccall,
who was another great ufc fighter.

423
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,460
He's very excited about the results.
Very happy about the results.

424
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:14,940
All right,
good.

425
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:16,230
I'm glad about that.
He loves it.

426
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:21,231
Yeah.
We were talking about it and he was 

427
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:21,231
like,
I'm 100 percent sold a real,

428
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:21,231
you know,
when I first try,

429
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:22,920
he said when he first started doing it,
he was like,

430
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,150
eh,
we'll see.

431
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,780
But then,
you know,

432
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,110
once he really experienced it,
he was like,

433
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,970
okay,
I'm going to be doing this from now on.

434
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:30,670
Yeah,
he's,

435
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,000
I really like him because he's a real 
nice guy.

436
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,860
Um,
we've not done that much.

437
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:37,110
Rarely did you work with them after his 
last fight?

438
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,380
Did you work with them after the.
I've only been,

439
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,630
I actually don't know because,
you know,

440
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,140
no disrespect to the avid followed us.
I know.

441
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:47,410
I'm sorry,
I'll leave now,

442
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,980
but I'm finished my coffee first.
But uh,

443
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,260
but he's like,
you know,

444
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:55,960
um,
I think it was after his last loss.

445
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,800
He said he was feeling things.
Yeah.

446
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,140
Was that the guy?
A little stocky guide and just winning 

447
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,140
shots in jada?
I,

448
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,140
I,
yeah,

449
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,320
I did see that.
And um,

450
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,380
since working with them it's just,
it's just about finding out who they 

451
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,611
are.
Everyone is different and that's why I 

452
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:14,611
liked to work with people once I want to
do seminars.

453
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:15,970
I'm over here doing some else at the 
moment,

454
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,910
but like to work with people to find out
what makes them tick,

455
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,420
to find out what stimulates them and 
what doesn't,

456
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:23,830
you know.
And we'll hold them up.

457
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,240
Yeah,
definitely.

458
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:27,640
But ian mccall's a lovely guy.
I really,

459
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,010
really liked him.
And joe,

460
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,150
same thing.
Yeah.

461
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,030
Same people.
Same deal.

462
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:33,220
Yeah.

463
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,350
Yeah.
And you work with ross pearson as well 

464
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:38,350
as another

465
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:38,350
done.
I worked with ross person.

466
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,020
I was,
I did some stand up.

467
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:44,021
I used to teach my tie.
It was at a gym called salford moitai 

468
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:44,021
on.
I'm just holding pads.

469
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,010
And so I kind of fell out of love with 
it,

470
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:46,970
really teaching,
etc.

471
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,480
because mine coaching took over it.
But yeah.

472
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:51,140
What would ross as well,
he didn't have a super guy.

473
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,240
So you're not doing muay thai training 
anymore.

474
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:56,050
You basically do an online coach stuff 
now.

475
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,500
Commentary for infusion.
And for folks who don't know,

476
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,200
vinnie useD to do commentary for each 
shoW time,

477
00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:07,020
which is one of the bigger kickboxing 
events in the world before it was bought

478
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:09,220
out by glory.
And uh,

479
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,370
and um,
now it's,

480
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:16,371
uh,
gloria is struggling a bit and uniteD 

481
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:16,371
states,
unfortunately,

482
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:16,440
I don't know why.
It's just to me,

483
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,420
I'm such a huge fan of it.
I think,

484
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:18,870
uh,
you know,

485
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:22,950
you watch a fight like simon marcus 
versus um,

486
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,440
a arts and levin is a fucking great 
fight.

487
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:27,900
I was watching it this morning again,
and the gym was amazing.

488
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,880
Amazing fight.
Five rounds.

489
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,020
Went to a draw.
Yeah.

490
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,080
I mean he's just a fucking war between 
two of the very best guys in the world.

491
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:35,670
So exciting high level stuff.

492
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:41,020
I've never seen anyone trailer.
I was in America last year with my 

493
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,780
friend brian dobler from fontana.
I was,

494
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,620
he was training their assignment was 
trading at his gym.

495
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:49,290
I've never seen anyone train like men.
She really,

496
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:49,850
you know.
Oh,

497
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,900
well,
he looks like a machine.

498
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:51,210
Yes.
Yeah,

499
00:22:51,211 --> 00:22:51,560
it does.

500
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,830
Yeah.
And his fight with joe schilling.

501
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:54,910
Holy shit.
What a fight.

502
00:22:54,911 --> 00:22:56,240
That was.
What a fight.

503
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,900
Yeah.
And joe wound up knocking him out in the

504
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:01,120
fourth round.
They went three rounds.

505
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:06,121
It was a draw after three rounds and joe
knocked him out in the for this fucking 

506
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:06,121
crazy

507
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:09,830
joselyn get salt.
This jail shit is like the guy up 

508
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:09,830
halloween,
Michael Myers came down.

509
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:14,431
He's getting buck up and he's special.
And you were working with him before 

510
00:23:14,431 --> 00:23:19,381
that fund was?
I worked with them before the first 

511
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:19,381
glory.
When he won it.

512
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:20,120
Would it be the altima?
Yeah,

513
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,020
I,
I,

514
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,290
I asked him.
I asked him.

515
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,700
I met joe.
uh,

516
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,260
it,
it was kind of,

517
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,450
I don't know,
I'll be honest with you,

518
00:23:28,451 --> 00:23:29,790
gerard,
a bit of a chip on his shoulder.

519
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,280
He was angry and stuff,
you know what I mean?

520
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,710
He won't mind me telling you this 
because he said I can swap beat me up.

521
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,000
And um,
he,

522
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,140
yeah,
he was,

523
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:40,840
um,
It was a bit like that and I seen him at

524
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:43,330
k one because I did k one in los angeles
while ago.

525
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,950
I was talking to him.
I said,

526
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,330
your miles better than what you come 
across on the internet.

527
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,980
You're much better person than what you 
act on it.

528
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,780
Kind of stuck home with him.
He made me a friend on facebook and then

529
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:54,860
a concept statement said,
you know,

530
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,910
joe,
want me to work wIth you?

531
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:56,870
And he went,
yeah,

532
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:57,500
sure.
Cool.

533
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,170
And then we got on.
He's so smart.

534
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,760
He picks things up so quickly,
so open to stuff.

535
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:09,340
We've done some really,
really cool stuff that's I can 

536
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:09,560
experiment on joe,
if,

537
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,000
if that makes sense.
You know,

538
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:15,380
some things I want to try.
I a dude him and he seems to work really

539
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:17,820
well on him.
So can you give us an example?

540
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:19,620
Like what do you mean?
Like things that you want to explain it.

541
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,040
It's really strange,
but he's like,

542
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,180
I had to think about,
because I'm,

543
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,660
I'm english of sir galahad.
They night gala hearts,

544
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,490
you know,
the knights of the round table,

545
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:35,670
you know,
king arthur and joel didn't want to get 

546
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:35,670
injured because he was gonna fight.

547
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,560
I think you've robert something or 
other.

548
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:38,810
He was fought on,
on gloria and then he was going to fight

549
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:43,580
on ballots or against melvin mom have 
any anyway to come out unscathed.

550
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,640
So we persuaded his unconscious mind to 
have armor likes the gullah heart.

551
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,350
So I talked in hypnosis about the 
archetype of knights,

552
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,220
of the knights of the round table.
And he will struggle a heart.

553
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,490
Not literally obviously,
but you know,

554
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:04,190
so we had armor so he didn't come.
So we come out on injured,

555
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,820
you know the words,
I'm not saying it's going to work for 

556
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:09,820
everything,
you know,

557
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,460
like I'll get,
you know it bullets and stuff like that,

558
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:11,420
you know what I mean?
But it was just,

559
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,580
it was getting his mindset into that,
into that sort of the way of thinking.

560
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,650
He was so worried about getting injured.
So the,

561
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,380
is that why it was effective?

562
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,860
Because it mitigated the stress that he 
worried about getting injured.

563
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,340
A sideline can fuck you.
God,

564
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:30,920
I don't get her.
I'll get her to that getting hurt.

565
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,830
He's in the back of your mind replaying 
over and over and over again.

566
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:34,720
yeah,
indeed.

567
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:39,810
There was one instance,
liam harrison was fight and it's cycled 

568
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,870
cal some that I need for him before and 
got stopped in Jamaica and john wayne 

569
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,970
power for,
against ballpark walk out.

570
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,980
Pulper moc and I'm leaving had been 
stopped and it was a forefront with low 

571
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,351
kicks.
So we did a hypnosis to make him called 

572
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,450
hypnosis in a triggered was warrior.
You know,

573
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:59,620
we kept this work because liam's,
if you ever seen liam harrison fires,

574
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:04,630
incredible fire.
And along with Jordan Watson and andy 

575
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,630
house and all them from bud company in 
england.

576
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,420
And um,
what,

577
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,160
what we did was we did,
they said no,

578
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:12,161
she said when I was coming saying on the
show because he was fighting unaware in 

579
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:13,220
round four and it just freaked me out 
really to be honest.

580
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,400
He looks at me and he looked me straight
in the eye and he went worrier and then 

581
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,180
beat shit out of anyone when I'm points 
and yeah,

582
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,160
afterwards I said,
you remember saying worry anyway.

583
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,580
No,
I didn't remember it.

584
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,730
So it was that stuCk in his hat.
That was that.

585
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,810
Well,
in all fairness,

586
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:31,580
he probably got hit in the head a bunch 
of charts.

587
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:38,610
No,
I have no fucking idea who I am.

588
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:44,150
I mean,
how many times is a fighter won a fight 

589
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:44,150
and then asked what happened?
Yeah.

590
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:44,160
That

591
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,160
does happen.
But I feel that I just state as well as 

592
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,160
both,
right?

593
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

594
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,430
We Saw them up a state that had not 
extended it.

595
00:26:52,431 --> 00:26:53,130
Yeah,
that's what I.

596
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:56,850
Isn't it in the japanese martial arts,
I think you said it's a state.

597
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,090
Did mohammed ali talk about it when 
muhammad ali fought cleveland williams,

598
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,170
he was in that side kind of state.
You know what's my favorite ali fight?

599
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:06,820
I'm so glad you brought that up,
is just any breathtaking.

600
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,560
I've played that fight on this podcast 
at least three times in a state.

601
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:15,561
It was in this flow and that's before he
went away for three years before they 

602
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:18,540
took away his ability to fight cause he 
wouldn't fight in the Vietnam war.

603
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,910
And then he came back and he was never 
the same again.

604
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:25,911
That cleveland williams fight to me is 
like quintessential and people should 

605
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:25,911
watch,
let's just showed his,

606
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:26,490
his full potential.

607
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,470
But yeah,
he was in that sort of flow state,

608
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,120
but now way to get the same,
you know,

609
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,680
he's the way he's.
I mean he,

610
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,110
there's one fight,
harold brazier,

611
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,580
he moved up to light welterweight to 
remember and he slipped,

612
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,770
slipped out of debit.
I can't do it by like they slipped,

613
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,080
slipped and they just steps around him 
and pat him on the ass and I'm like,

614
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:45,540
come on now.
That's ridiculous skill.

615
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,410
Yeah.
Well,

616
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,440
whittaker is one of those guys that 
people kind of forget about,

617
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,200
you know,
like everyone wants to talk about julio,

618
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:54,720
cesar chavez and some great fighters 
from that era.

619
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,230
You just have as that I think you want 
as well.

620
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:03,680
But uh,
he was one of those guys that for 

621
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,080
whatever reason,
people have kind of forgotten about him.

622
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:09,081
Meldrick taylor,
a lot of people have forgotten about 

623
00:28:09,081 --> 00:28:10,531
them.
Algebra taylor taylor were meldrick 

624
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:10,531
taylor.

625
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:12,500
I shouldn't say this.
When meldrick taylor last to christina 

626
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,340
spanner and I think he fought in Ireland
or somewhere.

627
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,550
Oh no,
it was on.

628
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,190
They raise the roddick and lennox lewis.
Bill.

629
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,010
I cried.
I loved meldrick taylor.

630
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,140
He was like my everything.
It was,

631
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,550
I shouldn't say that.
She was like,

632
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,580
oh no,
no.

633
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:31,581
But he was just.
I loved watching him fight with chavez 

634
00:28:31,581 --> 00:28:32,340
was just classic.
Yeah.

635
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:35,340
Well chavez changed him.
He was never the same after that fight.

636
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,490
No,
after he got stopped in the twelfth with

637
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:43,491
like seconds to go,
richard blow to something else and that 

638
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:45,270
he was swallowing his own blood from the
mouth cuts.

639
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,990
But it was just,
it was heartbreaking because after that 

640
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,961
he was just literally never the same.
And I remember right now race destroy 

641
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:57,900
interiors is bouncing on his feet and,
and then Terry Terry,

642
00:28:57,901 --> 00:28:59,120
now he's fucking out.

643
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,760
They're both fucked it just training,
training,

644
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,460
training.
Golovkin isn't who his trainer.

645
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:09,330
Abel sanchez.
He's now training them up in big.

646
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,420
I love,
love,

647
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:16,670
love can explain how he fights.
He always talks about how he feels and 

648
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:22,660
emotion.
He talks about how he feels and 

649
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:22,660
everything.
You see him,

650
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,610
even when he's in the park,
he seemed feeling the shot,

651
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,500
you know,
he said he,

652
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,720
he can see him every single part of them
considering everything that he does.

653
00:29:29,721 --> 00:29:31,950
And apparently he's even beats people 
up.

654
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,040
I think kai,
that kovalev at last,

655
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,230
at last have left that gym because of 
gennady golovkin.

656
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,760
It really drops into the body shot.
Yeah.

657
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:43,420
He's a monster Who fights 15 pounds.
Heavier.

658
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,760
Real.
I'm not saying it's rumors.

659
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,040
Spread it up,
spread it.

660
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:54,100
Even england anymore in liverpool.
I've moved kovalev and knocking on the 

661
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,820
doors.
It was joe rogan's fault.

662
00:29:56,821 --> 00:29:57,980
He made me say it.

663
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,540
Kovalev was a monster to incredible and 
will quite dear to bernard hopkins.

664
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,900
That was pretty shocking,
pretty shocking to see bernard hopkins 

665
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,710
and fully defensive survival mode.
Especially in round 12.

666
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:09,450
I fought,
I fought,

667
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:10,160
it,
looked like it.

668
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:15,470
He let him off a bit in rounds,
rather thought I thought he was chasing 

669
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:17,020
him down.
I didn't know was very.

670
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,160
At least it's on my friend's facebook 
and it yet I think names,

671
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,380
but he,
um,

672
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,310
was before he was famous and uh,
but he seems to like violent stuff,

673
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,160
you know,
it's a scary guy.

674
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,790
He's a very,
very scary guy.

675
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,830
Well,
he killed the guy in the ring one,

676
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,580
a guy died and one of his fights.
I didn't seem to affect him at all.

677
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,800
You know,
a lot of times like with raymond sini 

678
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:41,800
or,
um,

679
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,760
emil griffith,
there's a lot of fighters.

680
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,940
They'll kill somebody if I remove 
quickened did as well.

681
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,640
Didn't it can kill somebody as well.
It didn't remember that.

682
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:53,670
Yeah.
But if something happens to them after 

683
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,260
that where they're never quite the same.
Ben,

684
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,850
ben was the same night.
It's interesting,

685
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,870
again,
general mcclellan fund,

686
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:05,150
if you listen to that,
at the end of it he said says the first 

687
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:08,881
person I'd like to thank paul mckenna,
hypnotizing me and making me believe in 

688
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:12,331
myself,
and I met nigel been about two months 

689
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:13,960
ago and I said that after you watch it,
the first thing you said,

690
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:18,961
I'd like to thank paul mckenna for 
hypnotize me and I can believe him 

691
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:19,360
though,
because they apparently had a separation

692
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,870
of his wife and his girlfriend now fucks
people up,

693
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,010
you know,
so there's a,

694
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:24,510
there's a grief attached to it,
isn't that,

695
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,780
you know,
and um,

696
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,840
yeah.
Nigel and I mentioned that to nigel 

697
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:30,840
banks have massive fan and I mentioned 
that.

698
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,800
I said I got into mind coaching because 
partly it's because of how,

699
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,800
you know what,
let me go out the ring.

700
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:38,050
He got knocked out of the ring the first
round.

701
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:42,310
The mcclellan was just a monster.
Now was in his prime and to destroy your

702
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:43,960
back then.
And they were,

703
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,840
everyone was talking about mcclellan 
eventually fighting Roy Jones jr.

704
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,150
It was the big super far that was on the
horizon,

705
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,700
sort of like,
you know,

706
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,710
people are anticipating all the 
different fights right now for golovkin 

707
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,820
anticipating possibly kodo kodo.
Maybe one day I'm canelo canelo alvarez.

708
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,360
Yeah,
that's a possibility and that's how they

709
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:09,361
were looking at him until the nigel band
fight and it looked like he was just 

710
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:11,410
going to kill nigel benn just just 
beating the fuck out of him,

711
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:13,270
but two things.
One,

712
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,480
the weight cut issue.
There was a big issue because a general 

713
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,050
mcclellan was huge and he was cutting a 
lot of weight to get down that week 

714
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,260
class and that was back when you know 
people weren't doing it well.

715
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:28,290
They weren't rehydrating with ivs and 
particularly in boxing that the weight 

716
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:33,131
cutting mentality and wrestling is a 
totally different mentality because you 

717
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:35,440
could wrestle dehydrated and although 
your performance will probably suffer,

718
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:40,310
you are not as concerned about head 
trauma and the head trauma

719
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,010
that these guys get when they're 
dehydrated is very,

720
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:47,660
very dangerous because the bleeding on 
the brain is just way more devastating.

721
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:52,100
Apparently all the deaths that have ever
occurred or almost all the desks ever,

722
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:55,010
ever occurred in boxing have occurred 
outside of the heavyweight division.

723
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:59,960
And the reason being that those are the 
guys that are cutting the weight and the

724
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:02,570
heavyweights aren't.
But there's this one guy that got really

725
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:05,900
fucked up on hbo like I want to say a 
year or two ago.

726
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,180
Um,
he fought that cuban kid.

727
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,130
Uh,
was it Eric Perez that he fought?

728
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,270
Is that the guy's name?
He fought.

729
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,680
I don't remember.
I'm not doing a good job of remembering 

730
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,701
it,
but it was a rare instance of a 

731
00:33:18,701 --> 00:33:21,140
heavyweight being like really badly 
concussed in a fight and having bleeding

732
00:33:21,141 --> 00:33:23,180
on the brain and having to get an 
operation.

733
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,570
He was a russian guy anyway.
Point being,

734
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,020
but it was pretty crazy

735
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,870
when they did the documentary on a 
general mcclellan was,

736
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,770
you know,
a fun of gentleman.

737
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,870
Cloudinary was knocked out.
Julian jackson,

738
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:43,350
not sealing chucks.
I think it was like seven rounds maybe 

739
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,080
knocked him out in like one or whatever.
But he sat on the second fight and the 

740
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,840
interview afterwards,
when I fall,

741
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:49,420
either first time I had a headache for 
three weeks.

742
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,910
I had a headache for three weeks after 
fight,

743
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,500
you know,
there isn't a good sign,

744
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,600
you know,
that isn't a good side.

745
00:33:55,601 --> 00:34:00,601
And all of the,
all of the documentaries of mr out 

746
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:02,410
because I watched it and I thought I 
remember because I just,

747
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:07,470
you know,
something sticks in your head and his 

748
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:07,470
fault.
He's not mentioned.

749
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:07,470
They never mentioned that he was 
apparently the,

750
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,030
the spot really hard and all that.
Boys from crunk.

751
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:10,550
Yeah.

752
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,810
No,
they don't cry jim.

753
00:34:12,811 --> 00:34:15,450
Not only do they not play these to crank
that temperature up.

754
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:20,470
Yeah.
He was manual steward would crank it up 

755
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:20,470
like 100 degrees in that place.
It was like a sauna.

756
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,300
He couldn't have no rap music,
any swearing as well.

757
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:26,110
And even believed in light.
When lennox lewis for oliver mccoll,

758
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:31,530
they made oliver mccoll were white box 
in because he thought that it made him 

759
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:31,530
move quicker.

760
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,100
Hmm.
Strange.

761
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,130
it's strange stuff.
Yeah.

762
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,870
Emmanuel steward is an interesting guy 
because you so nice.

763
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,770
He's so personable as nice.
It was nice to know sadly,

764
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:51,490
but he was such a nice guy and when a,
when a trainer is such a nice guy like 

765
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:56,291
that,
oftentimes it seems like the fighters 

766
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:56,930
want to fight harder for them.
Like they want to win more.

767
00:34:56,931 --> 00:35:01,931
Like they have this more of like there's
nothing worse than a fighter that has a 

768
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:02,270
contentious relationship with their 
trainer.

769
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:07,630
And then there's like gang,
there's some sort of animosity between 

770
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:07,630
the two of them.
They leave,

771
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,910
they come back and you see a lot of that
and it really trips a lot of fighters up

772
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,610
that those contentious relationships 
they have with their trainers.

773
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,700
He doesn't think.
I think a lot of the times though with 

774
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,101
fires,
sometimes it may take the position of a 

775
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:21,101
father figure,
you know,

776
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:22,670
or,
or an elder brother or you know,

777
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,130
especially a father figure because a lot
of like have come from,

778
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,980
you know,
not the best start in life.

779
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:28,900
You know,
it's a main site.

780
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,730
A lot of them come from a place with no 
father in the percentage that date,

781
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,410
you know.
So,

782
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,720
you know,
I always outlie trainers.

783
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,020
I looked up to them and why it's a 
place,

784
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:43,260
it's just,
I just think it's part and parcel of it 

785
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,981
really.
It is and I think that's why I got like 

786
00:35:45,981 --> 00:35:48,321
emmanuel steward was so successful,
not just because of his deep knowledge 

787
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:48,660
of boxing and his understanding of 
technique,

788
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:53,870
which all were certainly there,
but also just because he was such a 

789
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,480
great guy.
He was one when he fought thomas.

790
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,160
When thomas [inaudible] sugar ray 
leonard.

791
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,460
I remember reading a manual steward and 
tommy hearns lot the cells away for two 

792
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,690
weeks and just cried.
Wow.

793
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:07,020
It's passion.
True passion house.

794
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,970
No,
I know.

795
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Ring me and ring me and I was only 11.
Were there any back then?

796
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:19,671
Were there any.
Did anybody use a mental coach back 

797
00:36:19,671 --> 00:36:19,671
then?
Do you know of anything?

798
00:36:19,671 --> 00:36:21,810
Is that when,
when did it start in combat sports?

799
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,900
I don't know.
I'm the only one in the world and not 

800
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,120
saying no.

801
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,110
I don't know.
I just actually,

802
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,560
I've never heard of anyone that does it.
I know these scenes is seen sports 

803
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:38,970
psychologists and stuff.
I know that steve collins,

804
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:41,190
before he fought chris,
you started going about boxing.

805
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,570
I love boxing.
KeeP going.

806
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,600
And when steve collins for chris eubank,
he came in with their phones in and now 

807
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:52,641
in the ring and it played with you,
but sad because nigel bennett used to 

808
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:56,550
hypnotherapists paul mckenna to go from 
old to beat general mcclellan and then 

809
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,330
you bank because he enjoyed,
uh,

810
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,810
Michael Watson so badly that he had.
And he saId steve collins is like,

811
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,480
they see.
Well no,

812
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:05,370
when he's hurt because we're getting 
such a state,

813
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,560
he won't know when he's beat.
You know what I mean?

814
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:11,190
He was worried that was going to take 
too much punishment.

815
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:13,800
Yeah.
Or whatever the whatever the game was.

816
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:14,880
But eight worked for collins.

817
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,970
Collins beat chris eubank twice.
We might've beat him anyway.

818
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,000
Might be.
It might be a voice shenanigans isn't,

819
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:21,360
uh,
it's,

820
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,230
it's,
it's,

821
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,000
um,
it's mind games.

822
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,460
Yeah.
It's like the,

823
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:30,470
the fragile psyche of a person that's 
about to go into,

824
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,640
on armed combat like that.
It's really interesting because most 

825
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,571
people would think of them as fearless,
who just the toughest motherfuckers on 

826
00:37:38,571 --> 00:37:39,720
the planet about to step in between 
those ropes,

827
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,120
duke it out,
but meanwhile there's a press,

828
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:44,490
they're bouncing back and forth and 
there's,

829
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:49,850
there's doubt and fear and all these 
different things that are playing on 

830
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,380
their mind.
Um,

831
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,470
you've seen the Mike Tyson movie,
right?

832
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,970
Yes.
The documentary.

833
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,760
Yes.
That one thing that he did,

834
00:37:56,761 --> 00:38:01,761
that speech where he described what it 
was like to walk into the ring and what 

835
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:06,291
he felt like and now he had all these 
doubts until he got into the ring and 

836
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:06,291
then we'd gone into the ring.

837
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:09,180
He was a god.
He hit me to used hypnotherapy.

838
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:14,181
Didn't know diddy customer always to.
I hit out in yolo show because I didn't 

839
00:38:14,181 --> 00:38:15,580
know I had one of your guys said,
I don't know.

840
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,380
He was speaking to you guys.
Remember?

841
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,940
I know.
I wish I could remember.

842
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,330
Remember,
remember latter my feet law sometimes.

843
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,590
But um,
yeah,

844
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,060
he was talking.
He said that customer,

845
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,920
you use it,
use it will.

846
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:30,921
Custom model was certainly one of the 
first and most prominent to talk about 

847
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:37,011
psychology to a fighter and it was a 
main point of focus in like interviews 

848
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:43,021
about tyson,
where he would talk about the things 

849
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,550
that d'amato told him and mano in the 
footage that they have of him.

850
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,050
You know,
there's many,

851
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:51,840
many different speeches that he gave to 
tyson that we're on recording.

852
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:56,890
Yeah.
And you know the one about fire being a 

853
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:56,890
friend.

854
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,710
Yeah.
Figures.

855
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,310
Like I'll tell you,
I really like,

856
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,580
I liked freddie roach,
of course.

857
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,560
Produce credit already liked coming to 
pick us up,

858
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,300
whether it was over the moon.
It's like a little kid.

859
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,480
He's a very nice guy.
Very,

860
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,110
very,
um,

861
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,020
very,
uh,

862
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,110
accommodating.
Well virgil hunter,

863
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:19,290
if we just want virgil hunter sets a got
metaphors which it learning stories.

864
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:24,791
He eight and he eight.
He says a lot of cool things I like 

865
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:27,130
about life and about.
I think if you've got experience of life

866
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:32,131
and connect,
you can convey it in such a way that it 

867
00:39:32,131 --> 00:39:33,700
helps that stops more policy or I think.
Yeah,

868
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,500
I mean and,
and moved To,

869
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,480
you know,
from the female side,

870
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,860
the way she trained kirkland,
you know,

871
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:43,900
there's probably very few trainers as 
ferocious in the world.

872
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:45,040
Is that woman.
yeah.

873
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,950
Some of the training that she used to 
have that guy do that.

874
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:53,590
The big one,
punch knockout,

875
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,730
cheeky fucking bad.
she could've shot.

876
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:01,910
That was a chick that christy martin 
avoided lecture was on fire get away 

877
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:05,941
from me.
She didn't want to have nothing to do 

878
00:40:05,941 --> 00:40:07,561
with that and wolf and there's a great 
video of an wolf driving a truck and 

879
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,660
harness on the front of it with a heavy 
bag hanging from,

880
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:12,400
say,
kirkland's backing up.

881
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:14,550
Doing is heavy,
bag it up.

882
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,560
It's fucking fat.
Anything when he fought canelo didn't 

883
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,450
have her in the call,
but like that shock canelo he went down.

884
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,610
We're all,
well,

885
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:26,690
he didn'T train with her and he didn't 
have her in his corner and she was 

886
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,210
actually still managing them too.
It waS just,

887
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:30,760
the whole thing was a mess.
That's unfortunate,

888
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:35,761
but you know what canelo might have done
that to him anyway because it was a 

889
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:37,390
motherfucker I'm telling he's dangerous 
and is all there is a whole lot,

890
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:39,600
but he's like,
you know,

891
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,130
think it's prince doesn't even.

892
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,220
It was amazing and it back in his day 
when he left blend angle,

893
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,360
they had a really close relationship 
from seven and you know,

894
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,930
old irish guy and he has got loads of 
still racing,

895
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,780
you know,
metaphors and blah blah blah.

896
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,500
And when he left wink a bank,
which in sheffield,

897
00:40:55,501 --> 00:40:58,030
it's not far from me.
He wasn't the same.

898
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,640
He wasn't saying like tyson and kevin 
rooney.

899
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:06,210
It just seems to have a gel.
They seemed to know another system that 

900
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:06,210
works.
We'll look.

901
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,260
Tyson was incredible.
I felt like kevin.

902
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:12,490
Well kevin rooney was still a part of 
the custom model legacy.

903
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:13,130
Yeah.
No,

904
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,990
he had trained under demato as well and 
they kind of carried over,

905
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:22,140
but he didn't have the same relationship
with kevin rooney that he had with 

906
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,350
custom model where it was he wanted 
custom happiness.

907
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,960
You want a custom models?
Love,

908
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:29,860
he wanted a custom model to father 
figure.

909
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,950
I mean really literally was,
I mean he took him in,

910
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,070
but again,

911
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,980
it comes back to what you do and what 
your focus is,

912
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:41,981
where it is really about mental states,
that mental state of wanting to please 

913
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:46,190
the father,
wanting to please this mentor wanting to

914
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,330
this person that you love and care so 
much about their opinion and their,

915
00:41:50,331 --> 00:41:54,620
their idea of you,
that it becomes a significant motivating

916
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:58,520
factor and that tapping into these 
factors,

917
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:03,790
tapping into whatever it is that allows 
you to achieve that amazing state of 

918
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:04,220
success.

919
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,720
Well,
that's why I like to get my clients.

920
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,960
I like to get to noma clients in a,
in a,

921
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,420
in every way because then you get the 
best from them.

922
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:14,000
Then there's a saying that's less than 
100 percent.

923
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:19,020
Support is sAbotage,
so if you're not getting 100 percent 

924
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,510
with them and then giving you 100 
percent but never going to get what you 

925
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:22,550
know,
what you can really achieve,

926
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:27,551
but it's like,
I like to really get to know them and 

927
00:42:27,551 --> 00:42:30,040
understand them.
Once you to client elo is going to be a 

928
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,040
client forever,
you know,

929
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,360
I've got a support system where again,
as the same lit off,

930
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:33,260
colin is like,
you know,

931
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:38,261
they,
they get back to on a regular basis and 

932
00:42:38,261 --> 00:42:40,691
I never keep out of touch with them 
because you always want them to know if 

933
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:40,950
they need me,
you know,

934
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,880
I'm not needy,
I don't need to be needed,

935
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:49,030
but I like,
I like stating concept with them right 

936
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,030
when I'm successful of it.

937
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:53,220
Well,
you also develop a project and you 

938
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,340
develop a relationship with this person.
That person becomes a project.

939
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:59,390
Yeah.
And so you seem to get a great thrill 

940
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:03,481
out of other people becoming successful,
which is a great quality and that's the 

941
00:43:04,301 --> 00:43:07,420
exact quality that you need in order to 
be a mentor,

942
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:12,650
you know,
in order to be a coach in order to be 

943
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,130
the best coaches are clearly the coach 
that gets personal enjoyment,

944
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:19,870
has a real deep investment in the 
student getting better.

945
00:43:19,871 --> 00:43:20,020
Yeah.

946
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,250
I just like,
I have a lot of.

947
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,520
I get a lot of praise of coaches.
Mark,

948
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,520
mark anthony's,
mark kamora who's jealous coach.

949
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:34,870
Um,
I was talking to joel facetime and then 

950
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:34,970
mark says you've done a really good job.
I,

951
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,940
I really like that.
I,

952
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,660
I,
I don't know,

953
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,680
my son,
my son will come across a bit.

954
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,210
Um,
I dunno gushy,

955
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,880
I just love it.
I really love it.

956
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:48,450
I just love the way fi is.
I like people achieving.

957
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,060
I like people getting out of darkness.
I know.

958
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:51,180
No,
it's like to be there.

959
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,600
You know what I mean?
And it's nothing more of a relief.

960
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:56,220
The not being a,
you know what I'm saying?

961
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,460
Just put the right direction.
See people just glow and they think you 

962
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,120
only get that eureka moment,
the light bulb moment where they've done

963
00:44:03,121 --> 00:44:08,121
something wicked or they've done 
something they didn't think they could 

964
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:08,121
do that for me.
Priceless.

965
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:09,360
Do you get paid for it?
Of course it's a job,

966
00:44:09,361 --> 00:44:11,790
but it's priceless to me.
Priceless.

967
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,410
Well,
that's probably why you're drawn to it.

968
00:44:14,411 --> 00:44:15,880
One,
that's why you're good at it.

969
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:18,880
And that's what you,
you kinda have to be that right in order

970
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:23,881
to be good at that job.
like the worst thing you could ever be 

971
00:44:23,881 --> 00:44:26,560
as a mentor is be jealous of the success
of your students.

972
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,030
Yeah.

973
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,180
Or to hope that your student doesn't do 
as well,

974
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,520
but we've all seen,
we've all seen that from coaches.

975
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:36,270
I mean everyone's seen self sabotage 
from coaches.

976
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,590
That's dark shit.

977
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

978
00:44:38,591 --> 00:44:39,660
It is.
There is,

979
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:44,690
there is an element of,
there is an element of jealousy and the 

980
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:45,490
or whatever in some and sergeant and 
people.

981
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:48,190
It's a lot of times it's like former 
competitors.

982
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,670
You know,
you know,

983
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,620
I,
I think,

984
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,390
I don't know if you agree with this,
but I think when a,

985
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:57,420
when a coach has been a fighter,
there's a transition from him being 

986
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,870
still a fighter to a coach.
You know,

987
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,100
I've got a friend called frankie elders.
It's got a really good jimmy and women's

988
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:04,480
shelter in manchester and I see that 
with him now.

989
00:45:04,481 --> 00:45:05,830
He was a fighter.
Very good one.

990
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,400
And I can see the transition now of how 
he is.

991
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,230
I've been a coach.
He's like all these kids that look up to

992
00:45:11,231 --> 00:45:13,690
him and you know,
like a Jordan watson's coach,

993
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:18,691
Richard Smith.
He is the same and they got this sort 

994
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:21,421
of,
you can see the transition because they 

995
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:23,110
were fighters and then they'd be gone.
Mentors and coaches that I like watching

996
00:45:23,111 --> 00:45:24,070
that.
That's interesting.

997
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,790
It's an interesting um,
metamorphosis.

998
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,100
Yeah,
it is.

999
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:34,130
And it is an important metamorphosis too
because if you always identify with 

1000
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:35,670
being a fighter,
you never going to be a great coach.

1001
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:41,030
You have to accept this new stage of 
your life and embrace it the same way 

1002
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:45,441
you embrace being a fighter to do it 
with 100 percent of your ability and 

1003
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:46,660
your focus.
It's hard for some people because at the

1004
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:51,661
end it becomes not about them.
It becomes about them helping other 

1005
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:53,160
people and some personalities and not 
really suited for that.

1006
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,960
Well,
some well fires are about them.

1007
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:00,470
I mean it's know certain.
Not all of them but certain amounts of 

1008
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:03,300
it has to be about them because they're,
the ones are taking the risk.

1009
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,360
They're the ones that to get in the 
beats aren't me go in the ring and take 

1010
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:08,640
the,
take the shocks and take the,

1011
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,050
take the pain,
you know,

1012
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:11,310
the main.
So it's,

1013
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,290
it is difficult for a person to 
transition,

1014
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:16,860
but that's with the change of values.
As you get older,

1015
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:20,280
your values change in you,
you start to shift from volume to value.

1016
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:26,210
Do you like it?
Do you have longterm goals as far as 

1017
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,320
like what you're trying to do with 
mental coaching?

1018
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,430
Um,
yeah.

1019
00:46:30,431 --> 00:46:35,431
I mean I would like to get into coaching
people to be mined coaches.

1020
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,520
I want elite people.
I don't want bullshit.

1021
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,050
I don't want that.
I want people are as passionate as me,

1022
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:49,330
so we're going to be doing that in 2016.
Mccollins got a um,

1023
00:46:49,871 --> 00:46:51,810
a thing now.
So if anyone wants to know about,

1024
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:56,820
they can get me on my website,
[inaudible] dot com or facebook or 

1025
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,310
whatever because hypnosis page under can
tell them about ace.

1026
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:03,120
Got a,
a new sort of a series of videos where,

1027
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:06,460
and go step by step to learn to be a 
mind coach from my,

1028
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:11,550
my long term goal is just to get,
just keep improving and keep getting 

1029
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,301
better myself because I love it.
Read and all the time a bottom quite 

1030
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:16,000
boring really.
It's going on about it to people.

1031
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,260
Um,
my long term goal is,

1032
00:47:18,261 --> 00:47:23,261
well,
look how well Mike Doyle say stone 

1033
00:47:23,261 --> 00:47:23,261
movies,
dire.

1034
00:47:23,261 --> 00:47:23,560
You know,
I'd like to be that.

1035
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:26,170
I'd like to get that to be the,
the,

1036
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:27,440
the,
the,

1037
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:31,420
the months ago to the goto guy.
I'm not enough of a people that have the

1038
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:32,950
same passion,
you know,

1039
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:37,951
regardless of if it's fighting and all 
people that just want to achieve or at 

1040
00:47:37,951 --> 00:47:40,210
least get something better a little bit 
further.

1041
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:41,830
If not,
it's really far.

1042
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,360
How many people do you work with it or 
not?

1043
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,510
Fighters?
Quite a lot.

1044
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:47,950
Yeah,
quite a lot.

1045
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,840
What's a common thing that they come to 
you with?

1046
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:52,420
Confidence.
Everything is confidence.

1047
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:56,920
90 nine point nine percent of stuff.
It's confidence and just,

1048
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,660
yeah,
confidence and people.

1049
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,850
People come to me,
it's always the same thing.

1050
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,240
They come In because I work from home or
to work on scale,

1051
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,670
skype or face time and they always talk 
about what they don't want that.

1052
00:48:07,671 --> 00:48:12,671
so first thing out of everyone's mouth 
to talk about what they don't want and 

1053
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:12,671
we asked them what they do want.

1054
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:13,240
They still talk about what they don't 
want,

1055
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,150
so you have to change the direction of 
the thought pattern because they're just

1056
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,760
so focused on sates up rock and roll,
the rock,

1057
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:19,390
the rock,
the rock,

1058
00:48:19,391 --> 00:48:22,810
and you have to just move them to where 
they want to go and then say,

1059
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:27,040
now what you want instead of focusing on
that now where do you want to go now?

1060
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:28,610
What you're doing,
what you okay,

1061
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,270
and we deal with that and in in various 
ways,

1062
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:33,520
timeline therapy or hypnosis or 
whatever,

1063
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,070
and then we move them towards where they
want to go to.

1064
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:41,740
So when you're dealing wiTh someone and 
their issue is confidence,

1065
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,410
what are the myths?
What are the factors?

1066
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,920
What are like the things that are 
holding people back?

1067
00:48:47,921 --> 00:48:52,921
Are there common factors that you find 
over and over again with people that 

1068
00:48:52,921 --> 00:48:54,040
keep them from being confident?

1069
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:57,100
No shit.
Sherlock syndrome,

1070
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,380
I call it this way.
You have to be like sherlock.

1071
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,760
I have to like thinking holmes english 
and he has to think about things.

1072
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:08,290
What really is going on in there?
That's that sweet.

1073
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:13,291
So cool.
That's why it's so exciting because 

1074
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:13,291
everyone's different and out there sort 
of,

1075
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:17,770
you know,
a thing that keeps them back or 

1076
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:17,770
whatever.
It is strange.

1077
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:21,751
Everyone's different.
it's whether it'd be a past 

1078
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:21,751
relationship,
whether it be a,

1079
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:22,180
like you said,
bullying,

1080
00:49:22,181 --> 00:49:24,140
whether it be parents,
whatever,

1081
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,740
or a current relationship or a current 
relationship.

1082
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:27,110
Yeah.
That,

1083
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,280
that's,
that's toxIc and they shouldn't be in 

1084
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,901
it.
I don't tell them not to because It as 

1085
00:49:33,901 --> 00:49:35,500
ecologically it's not right ecologically
that mulhall psychological,

1086
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,350
psychological,
not right and good for the environment.

1087
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,590
It's not good for the environment.
Oh,

1088
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:44,630
by violent language,
screaming and fighting with the message.

1089
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,710
But um,
no,

1090
00:49:45,711 --> 00:49:48,660
I just think that they have to figure it
out.

1091
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,150
And you kind of know anyway,
you,

1092
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:55,530
we've met people that you think and you 
shouldn't fucking bananas or bananas or 

1093
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:57,160
whatever.
When I was young,

1094
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:01,360
I used to try to talk to help those 
people are just to try it or tell them,

1095
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,790
hey man,
you shouldn't be in that relationship.

1096
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,920
You don't get no facts wIth to figure 
that shit out for yourself.

1097
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:08,400
You don't get no thanks.
So everyone's going to be mad at you.

1098
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,280
Her,
him,

1099
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:10,690
everybody.
Yeah.

1100
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,380
So,
so,

1101
00:50:12,381 --> 00:50:17,381
so it's about the environment,
the environment around them is 

1102
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,060
ecological sort of in some ways.
Yeah.

1103
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:24,061
And it's also many times whatever is 
holding them back is also with led them 

1104
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:29,221
to be in that relationship,
that toxic relationship in the first 

1105
00:50:29,221 --> 00:50:29,221
place.

1106
00:50:29,221 --> 00:50:29,600
Yeah.
unfortunately.

1107
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:30,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

1108
00:50:30,651 --> 00:50:35,651
I've met people that their relationships
is really essentially like a carryover 

1109
00:50:35,651 --> 00:50:37,580
of their mother.
And that's always so odd.

1110
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:42,670
It's like I have friends who can't do 
anything and unless they check in with 

1111
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:46,721
their wife,
they have to ask their wife for every 

1112
00:50:46,721 --> 00:50:46,721
purchase.
They have to ask her why before,

1113
00:50:46,721 --> 00:50:47,960
any decision,
anything they want to do.

1114
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,790
They can't say hey,
uh,

1115
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,860
I want to go to the game with mike,
you know,

1116
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:56,861
you can't say that.
You have to go and ask permission and 

1117
00:50:56,861 --> 00:50:58,140
see if it's okay.
And would it be alright if.

1118
00:50:58,141 --> 00:51:01,220
I mean he is a people that aren't even 
married but you.

1119
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:06,370
But because you travel and I travel 
because I know come and st infusion and 

1120
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:10,170
y'all college stuff you.
If you let a girl friend of mine scenes 

1121
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,000
can be in my life getting married in 
august,

1122
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,300
if you want that sort of lag,
you're going who you're with and blah,

1123
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:14,930
blah,
blah.

1124
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,700
You're not goIng to.
You're never going to eat.

1125
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,980
It can't work.
I've had those before.

1126
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,690
They're brutal.
Horrible.

1127
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,610
Yeah.
It's horrible on both sides.

1128
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:23,840
You know?
It's brutal.

1129
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:28,841
It's brutal for the man's brutal for the
woman and it's brutal for the woman 

1130
00:51:28,841 --> 00:51:29,900
that's asking the man where you going?
What are you doing?

1131
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:35,220
What?
It's a terrible mindstate for her to be 

1132
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:35,660
into a smaller about them than it is 
about,

1133
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:41,070
you know,
it's more about then what that company 

1134
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:41,150
through that insecure is that I've done 
that myself.

1135
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,510
I have to not myself.
We feel that it's,

1136
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,650
well,
it's very difficult to,

1137
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:50,710
to grow inside of a relationship because
it seems like you have to have your own 

1138
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:53,420
shit together before you can attract 
someone with their shit together.

1139
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:58,750
So if you don't have your shit together,
you usually wound up with wind up with 

1140
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,190
someone who also doesn't have their shit
together and it's very difficult to,

1141
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,590
for the two of you together to work it 
out.

1142
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:04,490
Yeah.
Like attracts like.

1143
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,370
Yes.
So oftentimes people like they really do

1144
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:10,670
have to break up in order to get on with
their own life.

1145
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:14,810
The potential.
That was shit that they work.

1146
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,930
Let's bring it to the next one.
And then it becomes a cyclic behavior.

1147
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,590
It's difficult.
Well that's the weirdest one.

1148
00:52:21,591 --> 00:52:24,870
When you get involved with someone and 
then somewhere early in the relationship

1149
00:52:24,871 --> 00:52:26,420
with her screaming at you and you're 
like,

1150
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:27,030
whoa,
whoa,

1151
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,820
whoa.
What the fuck is going on here?

1152
00:52:28,821 --> 00:52:30,740
Like what is this?
Is this what you do?

1153
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:31,730
Let's boundaries,
isn't it?

1154
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:38,570
If you've not have,
you know the on overstep the boundary 

1155
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:39,980
and all this technical further back and 
then you end up not being used.

1156
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:45,220
It is.
And it's also patterns that people fall 

1157
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,701
into because life is very confusing and 
because life is very stressful and 

1158
00:52:48,771 --> 00:52:50,180
there's a lot going on.

1159
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:55,180
So they fall into these patterns of 
making the same mistakes over and over 

1160
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:59,381
again from one relationship to the next 
because there's comfort in those 

1161
00:52:59,381 --> 00:53:02,891
patterns and you recognize it early on 
because there aren't any real issues 

1162
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:05,330
like we've only known each other for a 
short amount of time.

1163
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,370
You already fucking screaming at me for 
nothing.

1164
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,560
Why are you screaming at me screaming at
me?

1165
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:13,880
Because there's some other shit.
You've got the trapped dealt with it.

1166
00:53:13,881 --> 00:53:18,881
It's an unconscious behavior.
It's an unconscious reaction to a 

1167
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:20,090
situation that's not been resolved and 
they think it's normal.

1168
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:25,120
It's normal to scream because maybe they
grew up with people screaming at each 

1169
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:25,630
other or hitting each other or whatever.
Like,

1170
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:27,160
yeah,
yeah,

1171
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,990
it was easy.
And then you tolerate it.

1172
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,970
Then that increasingly it gets worse.

1173
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:36,510
Yeah.
And it's interesting how those sort of 

1174
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,740
relationships can become.
You can drown in them.

1175
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:39,940
Yeah.
You know,

1176
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:42,950
both parties can drown because you just 
can't get out of them and you're.

1177
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:47,980
You're constantly involved in conflict 
or the worst is conflict and resolution.

1178
00:53:48,761 --> 00:53:50,960
Conflict and resolution.
Conflict and resolution.

1179
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:55,961
And they get trapped in thIs high of,
of making up and fighting and then 

1180
00:53:56,171 --> 00:53:57,730
making up fighting and making it up.

1181
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,060
And meanwhile,
you're life's going.

1182
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,670
Yeah,
you're losing days is time.

1183
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:07,090
Time is a time is something you just not
going to get back at the.

1184
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:07,680
Hey,
you knoW,

1185
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,370
regardless how rich you are.
I went to,

1186
00:54:10,371 --> 00:54:15,371
um,
a seminar by a lady called dolores ask 

1187
00:54:15,371 --> 00:54:15,371
off.
No whiskey.

1188
00:54:15,371 --> 00:54:15,371
Who's,
um,

1189
00:54:15,371 --> 00:54:17,390
this is part of the thing called the 
severance of light,

1190
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:19,640
which is an eastern cervical belief 
school.

1191
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,080
Servants of light.
yeah.

1192
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:22,560
I hate it.
Already know.

1193
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,750
I know they state,
they say it's an easy thing.

1194
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:27,530
Still fun to do with me.
I didn't name it that.

1195
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:32,531
Don't play me some of the things that 
she said that some of the things in the 

1196
00:54:32,531 --> 00:54:33,530
seminar said very relevant.
You know,

1197
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:38,531
she was talking about um,
so tell a story about time saying that 

1198
00:54:38,531 --> 00:54:38,531
when she was in,
um,

1199
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:44,230
he lived in jersey,
which is just south of england and they 

1200
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:44,800
went in 1940 something or other.

1201
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:47,960
The germans were coming to invade and 
she had to evacuate.

1202
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,670
So I said,
well look,

1203
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:50,620
you know,
you're not gonna,

1204
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,670
I'm not gonna buy anything for your 
birthday.

1205
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:57,671
We're gonna have to use all the money to
be evacuated because it's going to go 

1206
00:54:57,671 --> 00:54:57,671
and live in has wall,
which is near me and liverpool.

1207
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:58,490
And he said,
well,

1208
00:54:58,491 --> 00:55:03,491
what I'll do is I'll give you a,
a bulk with paper and I'll give you a 

1209
00:55:03,491 --> 00:55:06,521
time.
so every time you write a check he 

1210
00:55:06,521 --> 00:55:06,521
writes that you want to be with me and 
that time.

1211
00:55:06,521 --> 00:55:11,061
And he honored that time all the time.
So it made me think about how important 

1212
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:11,930
time is.
We just don't get a lot of it.

1213
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,820
You know,
I'm 45 now,

1214
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,530
21 yesterday,
you know,

1215
00:55:15,531 --> 00:55:16,430
in my eyes,
you know,

1216
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,520
my mom died in,
when was it?

1217
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:21,830
February now,
august,

1218
00:55:21,831 --> 00:55:23,090
last year.
Bomb.

1219
00:55:23,091 --> 00:55:23,930
You know,
your mom's there.

1220
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:28,940
All of a sudden the garden,
they smarter in Poland and yet we get 

1221
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:28,940
tight,
I think.

1222
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:28,940
Anyway,

1223
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,140
it's everything.
Yeah,

1224
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,430
hundred percent.
It's every.

1225
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:35,440
It's also very difficult to stop and 
take account of what's going on in your 

1226
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:41,211
life and try to figure out whether or 
not it's serving you to the best of its 

1227
00:55:41,211 --> 00:55:42,420
ability.
It was as If time is serving,

1228
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:44,670
you have,
you are serving your own life.

1229
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,990
If you're your,
the your focus and what you're doing,

1230
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,780
your actions are serving your own 
existence to the best of your ability or

1231
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:56,781
whether or not you're trapped in 
momentum because that's often the case 

1232
00:55:56,781 --> 00:55:59,910
of people being trapped in momentum.
Could rob you of your life and you won't

1233
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:03,510
even realize until it's too late.
Isn't any of that 60 year old guy on the

1234
00:56:03,511 --> 00:56:05,460
hill looking down at the guy's boeing

1235
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,140
can out the window with the blanket.
I going bust it.

1236
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:09,940
Can I go again?
No,

1237
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:10,900
you can't.
There's no.

1238
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,360
There's no second floor with the 
diocese,

1239
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:12,930
the,
you know.

1240
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:14,970
Yeah.
It's just the way it is,

1241
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:20,070
but it's also really hard to figure out 
if you're trapped in an environment 

1242
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:23,851
where the people around you haven't 
figured it out and there are stuck in 

1243
00:56:23,851 --> 00:56:24,220
some patterns,
alcoholism

1244
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:29,220
and cigarettes and all the bullshit 
that's involved with whatever they've 

1245
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,091
got going on in their life.
Crime or drama or whatever the fuck it 

1246
00:56:33,091 --> 00:56:33,091
is.
This environment,

1247
00:56:33,091 --> 00:56:36,230
this environment that you're not sure in
the patterns that you develop,

1248
00:56:36,231 --> 00:56:38,470
that's really hard for people to break 
out of.

1249
00:56:38,471 --> 00:56:43,110
The patterns that they grew up in.
It is and it's.

1250
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,120
But it's part and parcel of the job.
You can't say any more part and parcels 

1251
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,570
said got loads of time.
Five.

1252
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:53,320
I did a podcast the other week and I 
kept saying all the time.

1253
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:57,460
Yeah,
that like is one that drives me crazy.

1254
00:56:57,461 --> 00:57:01,420
Like if I catch myself saying like if 
you like,

1255
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:04,330
I don't know,
like there's maybe like a way to like,

1256
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,730
oh,
shut the fuck up and if I catch me,

1257
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:11,140
if I killed myself over liking or 
overing you knowing,

1258
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:12,730
you know there's like,
you know,

1259
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,580
it's like the worst is,
you know what I'm saying?

1260
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:17,640
Like that's a rapper thing?
Yeah.

1261
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:20,900
Well,
like in england you don't get rappers.

1262
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:24,690
You have right screw downs,
prep poems.

1263
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:29,950
You can over there daily with hip hop.
You should get them into douggie fresh.

1264
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,520
Oh my goodness.
Okay.

1265
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:36,880
Fresh and doug e fresh and not saying 
big rat.

1266
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,960
Remember roxanne?
About being on picky with.

1267
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,440
Come on sunday.
That's good.

1268
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,450
Good.
You know the greatest,

1269
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,520
the greatest.
That without a doubt.

1270
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:48,400
The best that ever did.
It was indeed wasn't a.

1271
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,930
It was the motherfucker right there.
What do you want me saying?

1272
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,150
How dare you?
Biggie,

1273
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:55,880
biggie,
biggie.

1274
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,280
Can't you see sometimes hypnotize me.
I just listened to classical music.

1275
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:05,281
You don't.
Don't kick in the door waving the full 

1276
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:06,550
for all you heard was pumping.
No hitting.

1277
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:07,950
No more.
Mr.

1278
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,940
Why do you think I should have been a 
rapper?

1279
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:13,120
I think shield.
I think you were shitty mind coach.

1280
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,320
If you really believe that maybe we 
should swap.

1281
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,660
Have you ever told someone that they 
should be doing something different?

1282
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:20,860
If you ever told someone,
hey man,

1283
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:25,330
you need to fucking quit your job and 
become a rock and roll star or anything.

1284
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:26,620
No.
No,

1285
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:31,650
no,
I've told people they shouldn't fight 

1286
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,070
really because they're not good at it or
because they take too much damage.

1287
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,350
Oh,
okay.

1288
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:39,460
We know that you've seen say fucking.
Well I.

1289
00:58:39,461 --> 00:58:42,430
Oh,
I thought about only had one fight.

1290
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:45,250
I don't fight mba class and b class in 
england.

1291
00:58:45,251 --> 00:58:46,630
You can meet to the hat.
Oh,

1292
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,970
fun bd class.
And like not the best idea ever.

1293
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,420
No.
say it nicely.

1294
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,720
So you,
you told them they shouldn't fight 

1295
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:57,720
because they're coaches were shit?
No,

1296
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,310
not coaches,
but yeah,

1297
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:01,690
just so risk.
It's an early,

1298
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:04,360
early risk.
And why would you tell them that instead

1299
00:59:04,361 --> 00:59:08,270
of telling them to get a better coach,
you do invest in it.

1300
00:59:08,271 --> 00:59:13,271
Lee.
He just pushed him in the right 

1301
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:15,241
direction.
So then some people just know some 

1302
00:59:15,241 --> 00:59:17,440
people shouldn't fight and never really 
get it.

1303
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:22,441
Put it together.
Well you did what I do for the ufc for 

1304
00:59:22,441 --> 00:59:22,441
it's showtime for

1305
00:59:22,441 --> 00:59:25,970
many other kickboxing fights.
And when you do that,

1306
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:28,760
you do see people that kind of don't 
have a chance.

1307
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:29,990
Yeah.
You see,

1308
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:34,880
you see a bunch of issues,
know whatever it is.

1309
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,310
They're just there.
They're so far off.

1310
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:39,280
Where they need to be like

1311
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:42,130
crushes an must.
Tavi sometimes.

1312
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,130
Yeah.
Nsa's contrast tv.

1313
00:59:45,131 --> 00:59:48,280
But like it's.
He says palm possibly.

1314
00:59:48,281 --> 00:59:49,300
What they did it again,

1315
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:50,630
you parked.
I just did it again.

1316
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:53,620
Sorry.
But like I'm like,

1317
00:59:53,621 --> 00:59:56,320
mismatches.
Trouble me more than almost anything.

1318
00:59:56,321 --> 01:00:01,321
I know.
It's one of the things that I really 

1319
01:00:01,321 --> 01:00:01,321
like about mma as opposed to boxing is 
boxing.

1320
01:00:01,321 --> 01:00:02,490
Guys would get tuned up,
fights start,

1321
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,610
catch weight,
think about,

1322
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:07,570
I don't get the cat's weight thing,
catch weights for mma.

1323
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:10,930
It's usually because someone got a last 
minute fight,

1324
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:14,620
right and a short notice fight and they 
don't want to cut all the weight.

1325
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:17,810
Like say if a guy fights at 1:55,
like a glace and bow.

1326
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:21,940
He fights at 1:55,
but he really walks around about 185 and

1327
01:00:21,941 --> 01:00:26,941
he cuts a lot of fucking weight and so 
he has a process to cut that weight and 

1328
01:00:26,941 --> 01:00:27,790
he has to.
It's pretty scientific.

1329
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,770
They've got to kind of stay with that 
process.

1330
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:33,610
And if they don't like benson henderson,
when he fought brendan fache,

1331
01:00:33,611 --> 01:00:36,040
princeton henderson,
former ufc lightweight champion,

1332
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:38,770
took a fight at one 70 because it was a 
short notice fight,

1333
01:00:38,771 --> 01:00:43,771
stepped in and fought at one 70.
And the reason why I fight at one 70 is 

1334
01:00:43,771 --> 01:00:47,791
because he.
This way you wouldn't have to cut the 

1335
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:48,670
weight and he really wouldn't be able to
take a short notice fight at 1:55.

1336
01:00:48,671 --> 01:00:53,671
It's just too hard to lose the weight.
Like they have to do it over a long 

1337
01:00:53,671 --> 01:00:57,001
period of time.
Otherwise they're significantly 

1338
01:00:57,001 --> 01:00:57,001
weakened.
You know,

1339
01:00:57,001 --> 01:00:57,220
they get down to a certain,
you know,

1340
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:00,190
10,
15 pounds away and then they dehydrate

1341
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:01,530
themselves.
Don't get why.

1342
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:06,900
You know,
when cattell fought daniel gale weeks 

1343
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,970
ago,
why they made daniel gale lay lie 

1344
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:10,860
ariette cattails got the middleweight 
title of one 60.

1345
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:14,970
I didn't get that.
What they agreed to,

1346
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,340
they agreed to.
It was 1:54,

1347
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:18,390
right?
Something like that.

1348
01:01:18,391 --> 01:01:21,870
I'm just thought I didn't get it.
Strategy.

1349
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:23,750
Yeah,
I understand that strategy.

1350
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,760
And stanley said business,
but when was the days when that's what 

1351
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,640
your way he waits.
He was the champion at that would've 

1352
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,040
gillware would see walking around a 
lighter weight middle bite.

1353
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,190
I don't know if he's a big middle.
Well,

1354
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:39,060
maybe kudos thinking about fighting 
floyd.

1355
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:43,620
And so he's working on ms dot fay 
fighting lighter and lighter guys.

1356
01:01:43,621 --> 01:01:48,621
and it's payday right in dates,
but it's like one 60

1357
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:53,120
champ at one 60.
And also there's the golovkin fight,

1358
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:56,390
which is one 60 that he might be next in
line for gfi.

1359
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,140
Have they decided,
is it going to be code?

1360
01:01:58,141 --> 01:01:59,380
Oh,
a canelo.

1361
01:01:59,381 --> 01:01:59,390
Well,

1362
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:04,520
I think the big fight,
the big fight because I do think that 

1363
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,640
cuts out when mayweather.
It'll sell.

1364
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,310
I don't think so.
No,

1365
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,640
but I think canelo and canelo cotto was 
a big,

1366
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:13,250
big fight.
Converse.

1367
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:14,850
He's mexican,
so he's big isn't it?

1368
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,760
They don't lIke each other for some 
strange reason.

1369
01:02:16,761 --> 01:02:18,890
You don't so that,
that'd be good.

1370
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,250
So to speak the same language.

1371
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:25,250
I don't get an addy.
Do you think it will all console?

1372
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:29,970
It's hard to tell.
Um,

1373
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:33,340
cotto certainly has taken more beatings,
you know,

1374
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:36,330
a lot more weapons.
Yeah,

1375
01:02:36,331 --> 01:02:39,210
we hits a lot harder.
He's a scary fuck areas,

1376
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,380
you know,
you,

1377
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,880
you know the margarito fight I think 
took a lot out of kodo.

1378
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,880
It was a fucked up fight.
When you find out his history of,

1379
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:49,680
of loading up as his raps,
it was hot.

1380
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,080
Yes.
They fight wasn't easy.

1381
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:54,340
No,
it wasn't a real heartfelt yes,

1382
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:59,750
but the margarito fight was fucked.
When you find out that he most likely 

1383
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:02,310
loaded up his gloves with plaster,
what does this say?

1384
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:06,240
Cotto canelo winter to fight glove in 
november.

1385
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:07,980
RighT now they haven't officially booked
it.

1386
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:09,690
Ooh,
I'll see that.

1387
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:11,070
Fuck yeah.
Cotto.

1388
01:03:11,071 --> 01:03:13,140
Canelo will be a great fighter and a 
great fight.

1389
01:03:13,141 --> 01:03:13,830
Rather in the winter.

1390
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:18,830
Fighting golovkin would be giant,
but nobody wants to fight golovkin 

1391
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:19,560
because only boxing fans know who 
golovkin is.

1392
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:21,690
Every mexican on the planet knows what 
canelo is.

1393
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:25,230
You know a lot of spanish fans and 
boxing fans know khan.

1394
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:27,610
Canelo is not ready to deal with that 
left hook.

1395
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,460
Some motherfucker,
dude,

1396
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,150
boom.
Yeah,

1397
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:32,160
he's a motherfucker.
He hits very hard,

1398
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:35,790
but really for me,
it highlights my appreciation for me.

1399
01:03:35,791 --> 01:03:40,791
Whether it's technique,
maybe say what you want about him as a 

1400
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:40,791
human being.
He seems to be,

1401
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:42,270
you know,
a less than favorable human being,

1402
01:03:42,271 --> 01:03:44,190
man.
But goddamn as a boxer,

1403
01:03:44,191 --> 01:03:45,780
he's magnificent.
Bull.

1404
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:48,060
Admire his talent.
He's magnificent animal.

1405
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,470
He's a magnificent.
I mean,

1406
01:03:49,471 --> 01:03:51,750
he's,
he's the best ever in my opinion.

1407
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:54,360
I don't think he's the most exciting 
ever.

1408
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,760
I don't think he's the most fan 
favorite,

1409
01:03:56,761 --> 01:03:59,100
but it's the art of hitting and not 
getting hit.

1410
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,020
Who the fuck is better?
you know,

1411
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:02,990
like I had this conversation with max 
kellerman about.

1412
01:04:02,991 --> 01:04:04,950
It was like sugar ray robinson is so 
much better than him.

1413
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,620
I'm like,
sugar ray robinson lost a jake lamata.

1414
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:11,040
You're telling me that floyd mayweather 
would lose to jake lamata I'd tell you,

1415
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:16,041
you're out of your fucking mind.
I don't think jake lamata would lay a 

1416
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:18,651
glove on him.
I think Florida be all over the fucking 

1417
01:04:18,651 --> 01:04:18,651
place.
He'd be slipped into the lab and slipped

1418
01:04:18,651 --> 01:04:22,380
into the right and popping that jab and 
lead right hands and tying them up and I

1419
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:27,381
just can't see him.
He's always the way that wasn't at 

1420
01:04:27,381 --> 01:04:27,381
fault.
Hit me,

1421
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,020
blah,
blah blah.

1422
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,540
They always do that,
they always do that,

1423
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:33,180
but I just think sugar ray took a lot 
of.

1424
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,300
He was an amazing fighter,
but it was a different era,

1425
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,690
different mentality,
different style of fighting back then,

1426
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:44,870
different knowledge database.
People knew more about the effects of 

1427
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:49,050
fighting.
Isn't it always will and always will.

1428
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:49,710
Yeah,
definitely.

1429
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:54,740
That's one of the most exciting things 
about mma today is that you're seeing 

1430
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:58,071
these guys like these higher rodriguez.
He's young kids that are coming up 23 

1431
01:04:58,071 --> 01:05:00,150
years of age and have so many fucking 
tools.

1432
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:03,840
It's like you compare them to young 
people coming up 10,

1433
01:05:03,841 --> 01:05:07,440
15 years ago.
There's no comparison in mma.

1434
01:05:07,441 --> 01:05:11,790
It's a much larger jump than boxing.
We've got uninfused your life.

1435
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:16,970
We've got a couple of kids called allied
mohamad your to too.

1436
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:23,100
Two moroccans.
You train moroccans and they can fight 

1437
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:26,300
that moroccan magic.
I call it days ago,

1438
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:31,480
bought her hurry up,
but us psychosis of compensating them 

1439
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:36,211
loads and loads of science or I could 
just stay out of jail and stopped 

1440
01:05:36,211 --> 01:05:36,460
breaking people's legs and shit.
Yeah.

1441
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:38,220
You know,
he's just behaving.

1442
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:43,240
Self stop being.
The reason why he's so good though is 

1443
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,171
he's a fucking psycho.
It's part of the reason why he's so 

1444
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:46,171
good.
He's made.

1445
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:48,730
I'm not gonna say anything derogatory 
about it because no might find me.

1446
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:49,300
Well,
my,

1447
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:54,420
the derogatory things that I'm saying 
are all positive to psycho stuff is the 

1448
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:55,210
reason why he's so fucking good.
Yeah.

1449
01:05:55,211 --> 01:05:59,250
It's the most exciting kick boxer in the
world was so aggressive.

1450
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:03,190
Have a look at your writer and then he 
asked belied yet they don't see them.

1451
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,450
Kickboxing is kickboxing at a higher 
level now than it was 20 years ago.

1452
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,330
much higher.
You know,

1453
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:12,130
I'd say the miles,
they generally has 19.

1454
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:16,310
You know,
leo says a generalized 19 yesterday.

1455
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:17,590
No,
les is 18.

1456
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,910
18,
19 only young kids.

1457
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:25,380
They've had 210 fights.
Phone line,

1458
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:25,870
you know,
um,

1459
01:06:25,871 --> 01:06:30,871
her and that was know the so nice kits,
the so nice.

1460
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:37,210
But getting in them rings and they just 
fight like fuck.

1461
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,980
And then when they get out that treats 
like,

1462
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:40,120
hey,
hey,

1463
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,610
look at it and hamburgers and fries and 
very happy.

1464
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:43,780
And you're like,
no,

1465
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:46,660
I'd rather people that like celebrating 
and getting drunk and all that.

1466
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:48,570
That just chips.
Wow.

1467
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:51,360
Wow.
Keep them away from pussy.

1468
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,620
Well,
I'm not going to sell it starts.

1469
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:56,410
Yeah.

1470
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:02,430
It starts with you already have this 
super,

1471
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:03,850
really,
really good kids.

1472
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:08,851
You know,
he's just so fast and sharp and 

1473
01:07:08,851 --> 01:07:11,190
technique and everything.
Well that's one of the things that 

1474
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:13,500
perturbs me.
The mondo that were disturbed me the 

1475
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:13,500
most about about glory.
It's like I just,

1476
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,890
I see it,
I see the level,

1477
01:07:14,891 --> 01:07:17,110
like the nikki holt skins and you know,
the,

1478
01:07:17,111 --> 01:07:17,460
the,
the,

1479
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:22,510
the high level of fighters got into 
boxing now I think is he's doing that 

1480
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,100
every student as well or he's going into
it.

1481
01:07:24,101 --> 01:07:28,770
But I know he's boxed a few times now so
he might become a boxer in state a.

1482
01:07:28,771 --> 01:07:33,771
And I know he's still in it though and 
it's not really common for a dutch 

1483
01:07:33,771 --> 01:07:36,460
fighter to go into box.
And I will think tyrone's dabbling with 

1484
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:36,460
it.
Say so as well.

1485
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:41,170
I'm not really.
Holland has not really got many boxes.

1486
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:46,500
well,
tyron fought his last fight because it 

1487
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:46,500
was recovering from his broken leg.
Broken saki.

1488
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,250
Yeah.
Which was devastating.

1489
01:07:48,251 --> 01:07:52,570
It's really rare to see a high level 
kickboxer break his leg like that.

1490
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:54,010
That was unusual.
Yeah.

1491
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,100
But he,
um,

1492
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:58,390
I remember him saying to me years ago at
showtime in brussels,

1493
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,630
he said that he wanted to fight david.
Hey.

1494
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:03,400
He said I want to fight david.
Hey,

1495
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,900
I want to do boxing.
I will fight.

1496
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:09,910
David haney said that to him.
David haye seems to me to be a really 

1497
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:10,720
good fighter,
but a little too small.

1498
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,370
Yeah.
To beat a guy like,

1499
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,660
like vladimir.
Yeah,

1500
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,430
like the klitschkos just fucking these 
giant guys.

1501
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:18,830
He can't really reach them now.
You know,

1502
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:23,990
now he's in a lot of them.
His next fight will be against tyron 

1503
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:25,040
fiori fiori from,
from england.

1504
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:27,050
Who's the,
who's the funniest guy ever.

1505
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,600
His tweets are funny and hilarious.

1506
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:33,320
Makes I have a chance.
Do you think he has a chance?

1507
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,260
I hope so.
I hope so.

1508
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:37,700
I don't know.
I don't know.

1509
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:42,730
What I thought was interesting about 
vladimir klitschkos last fight is with 

1510
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:43,610
the referee was admonishing him for 
holding and he was taking,

1511
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:48,630
he was saying same was going to take a 
point away from him for holding that 

1512
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:48,640
fucked this whole game up because whole 
game was like,

1513
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:53,650
pop that jab,
pop that right hand tie you up roughly 

1514
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:53,650
povetkin.
Yes.

1515
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:57,520
And that was like bop bop,
jump and grab and pushes it down and 

1516
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,700
starts this whole game.
And as soon as that goes away,

1517
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:02,150
then he's forced to stand with guys in 
trade and exchange.

1518
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,370
And you know,
he's been knocked out a few times.

1519
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:09,400
I don't really do that against fillery 
because fuel is bigger than him is 

1520
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,530
actually bigger than I am.

1521
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:14,720
I hope she stays for the same area as 
me,

1522
01:09:14,721 --> 01:09:15,590
so.
Right.

1523
01:09:15,591 --> 01:09:20,591
But that's just nationalism.
If you take away that objective 

1524
01:09:20,591 --> 01:09:21,410
objectively,
do you think you can beat him?

1525
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,060
It's not easy.
Not easY.

1526
01:09:23,061 --> 01:09:24,140
So that's a no.
I'll say,

1527
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:28,530
I'll say no,
but he could also flooded basement.

1528
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,870
You know,
it was the last person.

1529
01:09:29,871 --> 01:09:31,930
Knock him out.
Was it corey sanders?

1530
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:36,940
No.
Someone knocked him out after corey 

1531
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:36,940
sanders.
Right?

1532
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:36,940
What was his name?
I don't know.

1533
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,710
I remember at 4:00
in the morning for no reason.

1534
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:42,010
Like a black guy.
American.

1535
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:44,420
Um.
Embrace.

1536
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:48,170
Yes.
He knocked him out after corey,

1537
01:09:48,171 --> 01:09:48,470
right?
Yeah.

1538
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,750
It seems like to knockout losses in a 
row,

1539
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:53,850
wasn't it?
But he just on that.

1540
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:55,730
Just consummate professionals.
Well,

1541
01:09:55,731 --> 01:09:58,250
that's another manual stewart success 
story.

1542
01:09:58,251 --> 01:10:01,280
Emanuel steward figured out how to get 
him to box.

1543
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:02,700
Right.
And you know,

1544
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:05,690
probably engineered that whole style 
that he's developed to this.

1545
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:07,550
Just pop and grab style.
Well,

1546
01:10:07,551 --> 01:10:09,090
none of.
None of manuals.

1547
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:10,900
Students with the left hook as well.
Haley.

1548
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,710
It was all long job,
right?

1549
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:13,160
Ons,
you know,

1550
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:16,080
like hearns.
It wasn't really like big left hook is.

1551
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,160
And what about mccallum?
Didn't mccallum fight under a manual?

1552
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:24,220
Mike mcconnell in the body.
Snatcher maybe famous left hook to 

1553
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:24,220
Donald Curry.
Left to the body.

1554
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:28,671
And the left upstairs was he.
Was he just do it that I believe he was 

1555
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:32,400
a drunk guy.
I believe mccowen because he's a video.

1556
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:35,650
There's a video of um,
inspiring with mcclellan.

1557
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:39,680
Oh,
that's just the nice classic.

1558
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:41,510
This live.
It's so,

1559
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,550
so amazing to watch cheese,
isn't it?

1560
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:50,770
It really is an art,
but it's also an art with a very short 

1561
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:54,640
amount of time.
You could pursue it and the very limited

1562
01:10:54,831 --> 01:10:56,790
number of times you can get hit,
you know,

1563
01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:00,080
and I think I got to show as a shallow 
existence.

1564
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:04,820
That's one thing that used to disturb me
most about mma gyms maybe say 10,

1565
01:11:04,821 --> 01:11:08,200
15 years ago.
These guys really didn't have a.

1566
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:13,310
There was a shouldn't say these guys.
Some gems really didn't have the best,

1567
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:14,040
most

1568
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:19,040
tactical striking coaches that had a 
deep knowledge and understanding of 

1569
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,071
striking.
So these guys would be beating the fuck 

1570
01:11:22,071 --> 01:11:25,071
out of each other,
just like the throwing bombs at each 

1571
01:11:25,071 --> 01:11:27,570
other in the gym and you would watch it 
and they weren't working on technique.

1572
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:32,810
They weren't working,
they weren't sparring to get better at 

1573
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:34,470
the art of hitting and not getting hit.
They were just wailing on each other.

1574
01:11:34,471 --> 01:11:35,520
Yeah.
And you know,

1575
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,430
that was toughening them up in quotes,
air quotes,

1576
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:42,540
and then they would go into the gym or 
go into the ring and fight and they were

1577
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:46,650
carrying all the damage that they were 
accumulating in the sparring sessions.

1578
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:50,760
And a lot of these guys now are kind of 
speaking up like jamie varner,

1579
01:11:50,770 --> 01:11:55,770
who's a former wec champion,
a top lightweight contender in the ufc 

1580
01:11:55,770 --> 01:12:00,471
just recently retired.
And he's talking about the amount of 

1581
01:12:00,471 --> 01:12:00,471
sparring that he did and how fucked up 
it was.

1582
01:12:00,471 --> 01:12:05,450
Also,
he was sparring with much larger guys 

1583
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:05,450
who was sparring with ryan bader have 
fights at two.

1584
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:06,270
Oh five.
And he's fighting at 55.

1585
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:08,940
And bRian baiters class at two.
Oh five.

1586
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,460
So he's fighting a guy 50 fucking pounds
heavier than him.

1587
01:12:11,461 --> 01:12:13,590
He sparring.
I'm in The gym is madness.

1588
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:14,880
It's still Texas wedding.
Sad,

1589
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:19,990
doesn't it?
Fuck you in the kitchen studies debut 

1590
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:20,740
last year.
Say that I think it was in Brazil,

1591
01:12:20,741 --> 01:12:21,870
was that.
I know.

1592
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:26,880
Anyway,
dot ringtail from ace from just the 

1593
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,621
same.
It relates to on the same road as made 

1594
01:12:30,621 --> 01:12:30,621
lives in Brazil.
Now darren,

1595
01:12:30,621 --> 01:12:34,410
tell east goodman a south by is very,
very good kid as what child for him,

1596
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,240
there's a lot of good talent.
Now.

1597
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:39,270
this is an amazing time for mma.
I mean this is such a.

1598
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:44,490
It's such a young and blossoming sport.
There's the level of striking is slowly 

1599
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:49,110
and steadily getting faster and faster 
and better and better.

1600
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,450
It's so.
It's really an amazing thing to watch.

1601
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:53,550
The jujitsu is getting better.
Everything's getting better.

1602
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,740
There's no comparison whatsoever.
I mean,

1603
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:58,650
I don't know what the difference between
1993 kickboxing was.

1604
01:12:58,651 --> 01:13:03,651
I mean I know there's,
if you watch like andy hook or mike 

1605
01:13:03,651 --> 01:13:04,530
bernardo,
there were very good,

1606
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:06,470
but they're probably not as good as badr
hari.

1607
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:11,510
Right?
But the difference between say fighters 

1608
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:15,081
from ufc one and fighters today,
I mean you're talking about a massive 

1609
01:13:15,081 --> 01:13:18,180
evolution like generations of evolution,
like a thousand years of growth,

1610
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,970
sort of amazing.
It was no comparison whatsoever.

1611
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:25,270
It's going to scan it all,
letting very quickly from mistakes.

1612
01:13:25,271 --> 01:13:30,271
So what people have done Before learning
very quickly and also accumulating the 

1613
01:13:30,271 --> 01:13:34,701
techniques from other disciplines,
because a lot of the guys who started 

1614
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:35,400
out,
they're really only good at one thing.

1615
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:38,460
Either they're really good at striking 
or they're really good at grappling.

1616
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:41,550
That was basically it.
But you're getting these guys today that

1617
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:46,551
are great at everything and that's just 
a small complaint isn't a complete.

1618
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,880
It was fragmented,
wasn't an first ufc started.

1619
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:54,890
It was fragmented with people at a jiu 
jitsu and male smith was it was he pat 

1620
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:59,130
smith best ones and he was the one dutch
guy.

1621
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:04,230
Which guy?
Blind alando v or whether it be books in

1622
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,270
lifetime.
Twice.

1623
01:14:06,271 --> 01:14:10,870
He was just on all the dunks and yeah,
he was dangerous.

1624
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:15,920
Same traIners.
Ramon decker called calamities with 

1625
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:16,300
glory.
Now he's the matchmaker for glory.

1626
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,720
He.
He trained him.

1627
01:14:17,721 --> 01:14:19,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

1628
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:24,120
He was an interesting guy.
Early on in the beginning were very 

1629
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:24,120
good.
Thai boxer,

1630
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:29,011
but a good example,
the guy who didn't know how to grapple 

1631
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:29,050
and he would get take down to the ground
and just smashed he in.

1632
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:31,160
They got beat by a dutch kid,
wasn't it?

1633
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:33,400
The elbow wasn't.
Yeah,

1634
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:36,990
goddammit.
Rem co pardue.

1635
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:39,850
Yeah.
Rem co got hIm in a headlock,

1636
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,400
took him to the ground and just blasted 
his brains out with elbows.

1637
01:14:43,401 --> 01:14:45,230
I mean he elbowed him like four or five 
times.

1638
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:51,650
Guy got chills mixed.
That was an important fight for people 

1639
01:14:52,301 --> 01:14:57,301
to realize that ninjitsu is bullshit.
A lot of people really believed they 

1640
01:14:57,301 --> 01:15:01,291
were going to karate chops on people.
Yeah.

1641
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:04,860
The,
the level in compare.

1642
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,880
Well,
that's also one of the reasons why 

1643
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:09,880
performance enhancing drugs are so 
prevalent in mma.

1644
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,110
It's because there's so many different 
things that you have to work on.

1645
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:12,970
Like if you're a boxer,
okay,

1646
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:18,120
what do you have to do if you do your 
road work and then you're gonna do your 

1647
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:18,120
boxing work.
You know,

1648
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,630
you do your sparring or your pad work.
I mean,

1649
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:22,000
that's what you do.
Spar x amounT of days per week.

1650
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:23,980
The other days you're,
you're hitting pads,

1651
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,660
work in the bag and doing your 
combinationS,

1652
01:15:25,661 --> 01:15:28,570
but you're only working on one skill an 
mma.

1653
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:33,750
You're not even just working on boxing 
when it comes to striking you gotta 

1654
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:34,180
train elbows,
you gotta train kicks,

1655
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:39,450
you gotta train knees.
You've got to train a different stance 

1656
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:40,570
because you're worried about being taken
down,

1657
01:15:40,571 --> 01:15:42,670
so you have to work on your sprawl.
You have to work on.

1658
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:44,980
You take down defenSe under hooks,
wizard,

1659
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,200
step away from the cage.
How to get back up.

1660
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:50,200
Then you have to work on your jujitsu,
you have to work on sweeps,

1661
01:15:50,201 --> 01:15:53,310
you have to work on actual submissions 
and you have to figure out like what,

1662
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,780
what,
how much can I do like,

1663
01:15:54,781 --> 01:15:56,350
yeah,
and you have to get fat as well.

1664
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:58,810
Exactly.
You see a guy like cain velasquez,

1665
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,940
you never see tHat guy attempt to 
submission,

1666
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:06,090
never attempted to submission and all of
those ufc fights because it's the only 

1667
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:06,090
so much shit you can do.

1668
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,170
So he takes guys down.
He just beats him up,

1669
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:10,950
you know,
instead of trying to like,

1670
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,360
you know,
learn all the chokes and all the.

1671
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:15,040
I mean,
I'm sure he probably knows them,

1672
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,860
but applying them in an actual fight 
situation,

1673
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:20,200
it's almost like there's too much to 
learn.

1674
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:24,490
And so when I went to,
when ncfc,

1675
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:29,580
when russ pearson fault columella at,
then I realized how dangerous these guys

1676
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:31,900
now I thought,
shit,

1677
01:16:31,901 --> 01:16:34,840
I can just kick.
He can get you on the floor.

1678
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,200
Right?
You know,

1679
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:39,370
not topic now is don't kill me.
Yes.

1680
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,560
Basically don't break my arm.
Dope.

1681
01:16:41,561 --> 01:16:42,850
Right?
My leg don't kill.

1682
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:48,330
That's very um,
macy's reality isn't real.

1683
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:50,170
It's real kumbaya,
isn't it?

1684
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,960
It certainly is.
Yeah.

1685
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:57,030
And that's one of the reasons why mma is
become so popular is because it's so 

1686
01:16:57,030 --> 01:17:00,130
difficult to go from that to like floyd 
mayweather versus pack.

1687
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:01,950
Yeah.
Or it's not much happened.

1688
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:04,120
It was like a lot of movie,
which I loved.

1689
01:17:04,121 --> 01:17:05,740
I loved that fight.
But the,

1690
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:10,780
the reality of the variables,
like the different variables that exist 

1691
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:12,030
in mma where god can take you down and 
garden,

1692
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:14,730
kick your legs so I can do so many 
different things to you.

1693
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:17,840
Can't just stand in front of him and 
shoulder roll and box and then clench.

1694
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:21,380
Just so much more going on.
The clench is just the beginning.

1695
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:26,650
I'm going to press the up against the 
cage and the pull your ankles out from 

1696
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:26,650
andrea.
They're going to mount you,

1697
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:27,220
elbow you the face going to cut you 
open.

1698
01:17:27,221 --> 01:17:32,221
It's going to be a lot going on.
It's not nearly as simple to defend 

1699
01:17:32,221 --> 01:17:32,570
yourself as it is in a boxing ring.

1700
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:36,200
hey straight.
Because I mean it's just like looking at

1701
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:39,540
the most.
They deserve the belt to get the belt,

1702
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:41,410
the ufc belt.
He must deserve it.

1703
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,630
Stuff.
They have to go for it to get that to,

1704
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:46,530
you know,
to get where they want to get together.

1705
01:17:46,531 --> 01:17:48,270
Once a gaze.
Ridiculous.

1706
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:53,410
Well there's just the beat the fucking 
murderers row you have to go through to 

1707
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:58,271
get to any shot at the title.
It's like the guys you have to go 

1708
01:17:58,271 --> 01:18:02,171
through today.
Anybody that's fighting for a title 

1709
01:18:02,171 --> 01:18:02,171
today,
like fuck man,

1710
01:18:02,171 --> 01:18:06,581
you gotta earn that just goddamn massive
group of contenders in every way class 

1711
01:18:08,661 --> 01:18:11,570
that are dangerous shit.
The way got the right mindset.

1712
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,700
Yeah.
You've got the right mindset.

1713
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:19,660
Do you anticipate that this mental 
training thing is going to be a part of 

1714
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:26,890
every fighter's camp in the future?
do you think it should be okay?

1715
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:29,870
I think it should be because you can 
get,

1716
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,090
you know,
it can be in shape.

1717
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:33,440
ThEy can,
you know,

1718
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:37,190
the strength and conditioning the right 
day and then if their ads are not right,

1719
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:38,420
the body didn't perform.

1720
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:43,760
Now what about applying that to kids?
What about applying that to kids in 

1721
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,130
school?
Not fighters,

1722
01:18:44,131 --> 01:18:45,750
just people in,
in school.

1723
01:18:45,751 --> 01:18:50,751
Um,
especially in high school or in college 

1724
01:18:50,751 --> 01:18:53,571
where you're about to go out into the 
world and so much of your success or 

1725
01:18:53,641 --> 01:18:57,420
failure is predicated on your attitude,
your mindset,

1726
01:18:57,421 --> 01:19:02,421
and how your,
how your brain is organized and 

1727
01:19:02,421 --> 01:19:02,421
inflammation.
Yeah.

1728
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:03,230
Yeah.
I think.

1729
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,760
I think a lot of it is just,
it's not really.

1730
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:11,820
It should be.
There's so much stuff that you can do 

1731
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:15,951
that that's,
that can help people learn and take in 

1732
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:18,100
information differently than just the 
cliche.

1733
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,110
Read that.
That's what you gotta do.

1734
01:19:20,111 --> 01:19:20,900
You know what I mean?
Is.

1735
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:25,930
But it's that many phase.
So that's why it's so interesting 

1736
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:27,010
because these people are so many 
different types of people,

1737
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:29,050
siemens ways of thinking,
you know,

1738
01:19:29,051 --> 01:19:31,180
like we did earlier.
We did the larger member.

1739
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:33,100
Why?
We want to explain what that is.

1740
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:36,590
How come I always,
I'm a slight self-induced.

1741
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:41,830
All hypnosis is self induced haka.
We say self-induced hypnosis thing where

1742
01:19:41,831 --> 01:19:43,480
you,
you basically,

1743
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:46,070
you find a spot on the wall that's 
higher than your eyeline.

1744
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,230
So you'd imagine that you're looking 
through your middle of your eyebrows and

1745
01:19:50,231 --> 01:19:52,510
what you do is you focus on a spot on 
the wall,

1746
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,960
um,
and you just allow yourself to just 

1747
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,530
imagine that you can see all the way to 
the left and all the way to the right.

1748
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:05,010
You can imagine,
you can see really high above self and 

1749
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:07,891
below yourself.
And then you can imagine that you can 

1750
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:07,891
see 360 degrees.
And what it does,

1751
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:09,990
it opens your periphery,
opens your peripheral vision,

1752
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:13,410
so it gives you a slight hypnotic state 
and it's a slight,

1753
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,680
a more feeling of wellness in a way,
you know,

1754
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,530
how relaxing,
what that feeling.

1755
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,670
And what we did was,
you were,

1756
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:27,300
you were telling me to concentrate on 
that spot and then visualize magnet.

1757
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:28,810
Yeah,
that was,

1758
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:31,230
that was different what,
um,

1759
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:36,240
what we did was we did hakalau first to,
to kind of lead you into a hypnotic 

1760
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:36,660
state,
um,

1761
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:38,290
to,
to get you to cause you know,

1762
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:39,580
you know,
you don't go,

1763
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:42,070
you say these things on these rapid 
inductions.

1764
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:44,290
And I went on a course of rapid 
inductions were,

1765
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,380
and what does that robert inductions as 
a color snap induction.

1766
01:20:47,381 --> 01:20:49,330
So what they do is,
if it's a slight,

1767
01:20:49,331 --> 01:20:50,910
you put,
um,

1768
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:55,600
it's like a shock shock.
The system shock them and then they,

1769
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:58,780
then you go sleep or whatever and it 
puts them under very quickly.

1770
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:01,420
You see it can see it on youtube and all
sorts of adult.

1771
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:05,860
I can do them.
I'm a very showy techniques as well.

1772
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,650
Um,
but I don't really dig them.

1773
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,240
How does it work,
like shocked induction,

1774
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:13,520
your sleep because your mind needs 
information,

1775
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,250
your mind needs you,
your unconscious needs information

1776
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,880
so you can like.
There's one way you shake hands with 

1777
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,590
someone so when they go to shake your 
hand that your hand,

1778
01:21:24,591 --> 01:21:27,830
you break the pattern and make them look
at their own hand and then you say,

1779
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:28,730
look at me,
look at that.

1780
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:32,720
Focus on that is a confusion technique 
and then you say just focus on your hand

1781
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:37,160
or that government had sleep on nigga 
wonder just like that.

1782
01:21:37,161 --> 01:21:37,550
Yes sir.

1783
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,860
Why or why do they go under?
Why don't they go,

1784
01:21:40,861 --> 01:21:42,180
what the fuck you doing in my hand,
man?

1785
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:45,830
Well there is always that possibility.
Hand smelt it.

1786
01:21:45,831 --> 01:21:47,160
What?
I've seen it done,

1787
01:21:47,161 --> 01:21:47,850
I have done it.

1788
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:51,940
I'm with people,
but it's all I've done it when I've been

1789
01:21:51,941 --> 01:21:56,500
in therapy with the client already 
because I'm sulking hypnotic language in

1790
01:21:56,780 --> 01:22:00,730
and do various things and stuff and just
maneuver them into that state.

1791
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:05,940
So I really,
you see people walking up on the street 

1792
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:08,491
and these cheap hypnosis and all up,
which is street hypnosis is a few guys 

1793
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:09,790
that do street didn't know.
She's a very good.

1794
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,720
Vince lynch is very good.
Did

1795
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:17,170
he do it like was doing in the street in
vegas?

1796
01:22:17,171 --> 01:22:21,000
He was making people's hand stick to 
walls and why?

1797
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:21,970
It's really.
Yeah.

1798
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:25,370
I don't see god and it's,
it's.

1799
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,830
Have you ever seen it?
No.

1800
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:27,730
Oh yeah,
they do it.

1801
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,500
Yeah.
It's this street hypnosis.

1802
01:22:29,501 --> 01:22:31,990
I've seen street magic.
He's not street hypnosis,

1803
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:32,950
huh?
Yeah.

1804
01:22:32,951 --> 01:22:37,450
So they make people forget their names 
or removed the number four.

1805
01:22:37,451 --> 01:22:38,320
So they go one,
two,

1806
01:22:38,321 --> 01:22:39,670
three,
five,

1807
01:22:39,671 --> 01:22:40,330
six,
seven,

1808
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:42,130
eight,
nine slash 11.

1809
01:22:42,131 --> 01:22:44,890
But uh,
it's fun to watch,

1810
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:50,050
but I know there wasn't an interest to 
you because what you're trying to do is 

1811
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:52,990
improve people or help them live their 
lives.

1812
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,100
It looks stupid.
Know?

1813
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,800
Well,
when I was a kid,

1814
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,900
when I was first starting out doing 
standup,

1815
01:22:58,901 --> 01:23:03,901
there was a guy in Rhode Island named 
Frank Santos and he was an r rated 

1816
01:23:03,901 --> 01:23:04,450
hypnotists.
And up untIl that point,

1817
01:23:04,451 --> 01:23:05,890
I thought hypnosis is bullshit

1818
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,740
until I saw this guy over and over 
again,

1819
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:09,460
many,
many,

1820
01:23:09,461 --> 01:23:09,970
many,
many,

1821
01:23:09,971 --> 01:23:14,971
many times.
He had a night once a week at stitches 

1822
01:23:14,971 --> 01:23:17,791
comedy club in boston.
So I saw him dozens and dozens of times 

1823
01:23:17,791 --> 01:23:21,930
and he would hypnotize giant and he knew
when people were under and when they 

1824
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:22,180
were bullshitting,
he would get guys who would look at them

1825
01:23:22,181 --> 01:23:22,780
and you go,
no,

1826
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:24,250
you're not mean,
this is not working.

1827
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:25,180
You're faking it.
Come on.

1828
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,660
And he would take them off the stage.
He knew when people are under a new,

1829
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:31,450
when they weren't.
But he could get a whole group of people

1830
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:36,250
maybe like bring 10 people on stage and 
by the time he's done hypnotized them,

1831
01:23:36,251 --> 01:23:38,800
six or seven of them would be totally 
under.

1832
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:40,990
And he'd have them doing all kinds of 
ridiculous things.

1833
01:23:40,991 --> 01:23:44,230
Like they thought they were having sex.
They would come in their pants like,

1834
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:49,350
like really amazing.
I mean I know for you you're thinking 

1835
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,040
like,
this isn't helping anyone.

1836
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:54,370
What he wasn't trying to do that he was 
trying to put on a show.

1837
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:55,150
It was,
you know,

1838
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:56,780
people pay to see it.
It was funny

1839
01:23:57,090 --> 01:23:59,930
pay to see it and they want to go on 
stage freewill.

1840
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:06,180
Um,
I've done it before we part and parcel 

1841
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:06,180
of

1842
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:06,330
part and parcel of,
of itch.

1843
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:08,040
Is that coffee,
coffee,

1844
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,410
coffee,
coffee.

1845
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:11,280
Well anyway,
sorry,

1846
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:14,800
don't worry about that.
So I don't,

1847
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,520
I don't think that it just doesn't do 
anything,

1848
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,760
but how are they doing that?
Um,

1849
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:23,610
because it's,
they,

1850
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:29,500
if you go to a hypnotherapist and they 
say you can hypnotize me brand fuck off,

1851
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:34,080
what did you come fall right now?
What's the point?

1852
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:36,100
you know,
you've got a piece or to buy a pizza,

1853
01:24:36,101 --> 01:24:37,950
you know what comes here.
He comes,

1854
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:39,100
get hypnotized,
you know,

1855
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:42,060
half go along with it anyway,
you know,

1856
01:24:42,061 --> 01:24:42,600
and,
and it,

1857
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:47,740
and it helps.
If the client's got an issue they want 

1858
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:50,121
to change,
then the more likely to change if they 

1859
01:24:50,121 --> 01:24:50,121
want to change with you,
you know,

1860
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:51,860
um,
but the,

1861
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:54,300
the people that do on the stage,
they just,

1862
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:57,510
they want it to happen sooner than they 
don't mind looking daft.

1863
01:24:57,511 --> 01:25:02,511
So that's cool.
But why did with you is we did the 

1864
01:25:02,511 --> 01:25:06,291
modern as well,
which was just logistically stood way 

1865
01:25:07,261 --> 01:25:12,261
because we did the peripheral vision and
then we just imagined that there was a 

1866
01:25:12,261 --> 01:25:14,790
magnet that could say negative energy 
from your body and what that does is you

1867
01:25:14,791 --> 01:25:17,280
use your own imagination to take that 
negative energy out.

1868
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,340
You do move is because it a weird

1869
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:21,600
still for what is happening there 
really,

1870
01:25:21,601 --> 01:25:26,601
because obviously there's no magnet and 
your mind thinking that negative energy 

1871
01:25:26,601 --> 01:25:30,551
is being pulled out of your body.
Is that just an adjustment of your 

1872
01:25:30,551 --> 01:25:32,530
attitude or an adjustment of your 
perceptions knows?

1873
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:33,180
Who knows?

1874
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:34,640
Who knows,
but it will.

1875
01:25:34,641 --> 01:25:38,520
Alls I know is it works very,
very well on east relaxing and

1876
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:43,720
is that related at all to what Frank 
Santos used to do by getting an entire 

1877
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,340
group of people think that they were 
doing wacky shit in front of an audience

1878
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:47,210
because it's.
Yeah,

1879
01:25:47,211 --> 01:25:51,630
it's the installation of what is the 
installation that's different.

1880
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:57,440
You know,
there was no matter she sat and not 

1881
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:57,440
having sex.
It's an installation and it's

1882
01:25:57,930 --> 01:25:59,610
right.
But I didn't really think that there was

1883
01:25:59,611 --> 01:26:00,390
a thing.
Yeah,

1884
01:26:00,391 --> 01:26:00,450
yeah,

1885
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,710
I know.
Of course they don't,

1886
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:06,370
they don't.
They go on there for that experienced or

1887
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:11,680
thankful for the experience,
but it sort of respected where they 

1888
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,070
believe there's is the end result if you
feel more relaxed.

1889
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,360
Right.
It's almost like a placebo effect.

1890
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:16,560
Right?
Yeah.

1891
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:22,520
So the placebo effect or the mind 
perceiving this change and then 

1892
01:26:23,071 --> 01:26:26,280
adjusting your attitude accordingly.
Yeah.

1893
01:26:26,370 --> 01:26:27,690
That,
that's what it is.

1894
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:33,010
He says just a redirection of thought,
redirection of focus.

1895
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:36,830
But that was different than the hypnosis
part because the hypnosis part,

1896
01:26:36,831 --> 01:26:39,050
when you hypnotized me,
like I was definitely hypnotized.

1897
01:26:39,051 --> 01:26:44,051
Like I definitely could see.
I could listen to your voice and I knew 

1898
01:26:44,051 --> 01:26:47,561
that I was hearing your voice,
but I was in this weird sort of dream 

1899
01:26:47,561 --> 01:26:47,561
state.
Yeah,

1900
01:26:47,561 --> 01:26:48,040
I was aware of it,
but not aware of it.

1901
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:49,520
Yeah,
like if you took my pants off,

1902
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,050
we'd have a problem.
I would be,

1903
01:26:51,051 --> 01:26:56,051
I would have woke up.
And what the fuck's this guy trying to 

1904
01:26:56,051 --> 01:26:56,051
pull?
But you know what I'm saying?

1905
01:26:56,051 --> 01:26:56,440
Like he's trying to pull you out.
It wasn't true,

1906
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:58,460
but I wasn't,
uh,

1907
01:26:58,461 --> 01:27:01,790
I wasn't eating it.
It's a weird state because you're not,

1908
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,130
you're not totally there,
but you're kind of there.

1909
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:07,940
Is that a good way of describing it?
Yeah.

1910
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:10,380
Yeah.
But you still dry.

1911
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,680
You're not gonna do anything that's 
against your values anyway.

1912
01:27:12,681 --> 01:27:14,450
Really.
But you're going to do anything.

1913
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,370
Yeah.
Well like,

1914
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:16,820
but wouldn't anyway because I'm not like
that.

1915
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:19,760
I'm not like that as a hypnotherapist or
as a mind coach.

1916
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:22,070
And um,
what we did with you is we,

1917
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,540
uh,
we,

1918
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:28,750
we got you to focus on your thumb.
That film didn't say your thumb,

1919
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,920
thumbs.
He disassociate yourself.

1920
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:35,950
Instead of saying your thumb thumb,
we focus on that film and then you just 

1921
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:38,870
get your focus on that.
And then there was a structure like a,

1922
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,510
as you want to free yourself for.
It's for,

1923
01:27:41,511 --> 01:27:42,830
it's called to do that one,
two,

1924
01:27:42,831 --> 01:27:43,460
three,
four.

1925
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:44,580
You know,
see,

1926
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:47,340
see it just like counting down as well.
No,

1927
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,910
do you account we know but using 
numbers,

1928
01:27:49,911 --> 01:27:52,580
you know,
bright say so cause assault of,

1929
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:54,560
you know,
focusing on that.

1930
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:57,180
If you're focusing on that then your 
unconscious mind.

1931
01:27:57,181 --> 01:28:02,181
So you folks in that not,
and I'm talking to you with language 

1932
01:28:02,181 --> 01:28:05,081
that,
that your unconscious mind recognize it 

1933
01:28:05,081 --> 01:28:05,081
to be relaxing.

1934
01:28:05,081 --> 01:28:06,370
Are you aware of all at all rather have,
um,

1935
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:09,760
like the concept of like a manchurian 
candidate?

1936
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:11,560
Yeah.
What do you think about that?

1937
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:14,300
Um,
have you ever watched derren brown,

1938
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:16,790
derren brown hypnotist,
brown?

1939
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:17,120
Yeah.
He's,

1940
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:17,620
yeah,
he's a,

1941
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:19,040
he's a,
he's an entertainer.

1942
01:28:19,041 --> 01:28:21,020
He's a magician as well,
but he's fantastic.

1943
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:24,500
And he did one called the experiments 
that you can watch them on youtube.

1944
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:29,360
And he did one where they shot Stephen 
Fry.

1945
01:28:29,361 --> 01:28:31,080
Stephen fry is like a,
uh,

1946
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:35,930
english,
a comedian guy and a very posh,

1947
01:28:35,931 --> 01:28:36,680
very,
very,

1948
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:39,200
very intelligent guy,
member of mensa herbal,

1949
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:41,540
super smart.
And they,

1950
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:44,180
uh,
he got this certain guy,

1951
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:45,730
they did a lot of,
uh,

1952
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:47,240
elimination techniques,
you know,

1953
01:28:47,241 --> 01:28:52,241
to see what was most susceptible and 
they use a certain guy to go and shoot 

1954
01:28:52,241 --> 01:28:52,310
Stephen Fry.
No,

1955
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:55,010
not with a real gun obviouSly,
but just whether,

1956
01:28:55,011 --> 01:28:57,200
I don't know.
I don't know.

1957
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:58,940
It's interesting.
I don't know.

1958
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:01,860
There's a case where I,
uh,

1959
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:07,130
what he assassinated,
someone who needs said definitely I was 

1960
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:07,900
under hypnosis and everybody's just 
saying that while he's in prison,

1961
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:08,630
don't know,
you know.

1962
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:11,550
Wow.
So do you think it's possible?

1963
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:13,220
Um,
we,

1964
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,460
you,
you would know,

1965
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:19,520
right?
Probably more than 99 percent of the 

1966
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,401
people on the planet.
I think if it's against your deep level 

1967
01:29:22,401 --> 01:29:22,401
of value,
you won't do it.

1968
01:29:22,401 --> 01:29:24,870
But what if you're fairly shady but 
innocent?

1969
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:26,790
Oh,
that's darkness.

1970
01:29:27,410 --> 01:29:29,010
That's very right.
I mean,

1971
01:29:29,011 --> 01:29:32,430
if you find a guy who's not maybe never 
killed anybody,

1972
01:29:32,431 --> 01:29:37,431
but maybe he's done a few fucked up 
things and you can talk back guy and 

1973
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:39,660
doing something like that through 
hypnosis.

1974
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:45,680
Possibly.
Maybe because you're essentially 

1975
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,430
steering someone towards a crime that 
they ordinarily would have avoided.

1976
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:49,950
What did you say the,
it's again on youtube,

1977
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,450
uh,
italian.

1978
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:56,820
A hypnotist and took money off the 
cashier.

1979
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:58,620
She got just took money out of the 
register.

1980
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:03,680
No,
still not derren brown played on 

1981
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:03,680
television.
No,

1982
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:04,970
he did it.
It was captured on cctv camera.

1983
01:30:04,971 --> 01:30:06,120
Oh,
so it was a thief.

1984
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:07,150
Yes.
And they were,

1985
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:09,330
there was one where devin brown paid 
with paper,

1986
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:14,900
so what it did is it got gets paper,
which is the same as like dollar bills 

1987
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:17,430
that's just blank paper and he said 
there's a confusion technique,

1988
01:30:17,431 --> 01:30:19,830
so he said,
don't quote me on this,

1989
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:24,860
on the script,
but you sat down and I just moved into 

1990
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:27,731
the town,
I just got off the train and I don't 

1991
01:30:27,731 --> 01:30:30,201
know whether to go with that way or that
way because my friend said you have to 

1992
01:30:30,201 --> 01:30:30,780
get the terrain but don't know where to 
go that way or that way or that way.

1993
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:32,280
But do you know where the station is?
But he said,

1994
01:30:32,281 --> 01:30:33,180
get the tanks.
Just take it,

1995
01:30:33,181 --> 01:30:35,250
it's fine.
And then when he's,

1996
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:37,200
when he's said said,
just take it,

1997
01:30:37,201 --> 01:30:37,560
it's fine.

1998
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:40,200
So confused as the people say that way 
or that way.

1999
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:42,810
So just mixed directing your thoughts.
He's moving his hands everywhere.

2000
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:44,400
She thinking,
what's this guy on about?

2001
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:46,110
Then he's saying take it,
it's fine.

2002
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,960
So when he's giving them money,
he's like,

2003
01:30:48,961 --> 01:30:49,320
look.
He sAid,

2004
01:30:49,321 --> 01:30:50,010
oh,
can I buy that?

2005
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:53,190
And he just gives them paper and that,
that's still confused,

2006
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,190
not for long because they assume 
comradery,

2007
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:57,960
but it confuses them to st.
Take it.

2008
01:30:57,961 --> 01:30:58,780
It's fine.
Take it.

2009
01:30:58,890 --> 01:30:59,670
It's fine.
So these.

2010
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,030
I've worked at a,
um,

2011
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,760
like an ice cream place when I was a 
kid,

2012
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:08,910
sort of ice cream and hamburgers was 
supposed called newport creamery.

2013
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:14,300
And I remember they had someone came in 
and they called a flim flam artist or 

2014
01:31:15,331 --> 01:31:18,750
someone would come in and they'll give 
you $20 and they'd say,

2015
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,860
can you give me,
um,

2016
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:24,150
a 10,
a five and five ones?

2017
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:25,650
And then they would say,
okay,

2018
01:31:25,651 --> 01:31:27,300
okay,
actually can you give me a 10,

2019
01:31:27,301 --> 01:31:29,310
five,
five ones and four quarters,

2020
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:29,790
no,
you know,

2021
01:31:29,791 --> 01:31:32,280
what,
give me two tens.

2022
01:31:32,281 --> 01:31:35,130
And then they would start to tens of 
five and four quarters now.

2023
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:40,280
And then all of a sudden you,
you'd have More than $20 that you'd be 

2024
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:43,050
giving them for their them.
and the manager closed the,

2025
01:31:43,051 --> 01:31:44,220
uh,
the register.

2026
01:31:44,221 --> 01:31:45,330
They went,
hold on a second,

2027
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:50,360
what is going on here?
And they shut the register and they had 

2028
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:53,581
like this sort of weird eye to eye 
moment with this guy who was trying to 

2029
01:31:53,761 --> 01:31:57,150
hustle this kid that was working the 
cash register.

2030
01:31:57,151 --> 01:31:58,710
It was,
it was really fascinating.

2031
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:00,130
It was like a guy

2032
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:01,960
who was a con man.
And I remember I was,

2033
01:32:01,961 --> 01:32:03,490
um,
I was near it.

2034
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:06,460
I wasn't involved in leo wasn't,
I wasn't working on the cash register,

2035
01:32:06,461 --> 01:32:08,470
but I was close to it.
Forget what I was doing,

2036
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:10,510
but I remember watching this going,
what's going on?

2037
01:32:10,511 --> 01:32:13,840
What is something happening here?
And then they had like a little meeting.

2038
01:32:13,841 --> 01:32:16,270
They explained when you're working the 
cash register,

2039
01:32:16,271 --> 01:32:21,271
you have to be careful.
People that start asking you for weird 

2040
01:32:21,271 --> 01:32:21,850
things,
asking you to,

2041
01:32:21,851 --> 01:32:26,851
you know,
because they start twisting your brain 

2042
01:32:26,851 --> 01:32:29,161
and confusing you and your memory gets 
all fucked up and you're trying to 

2043
01:32:29,161 --> 01:32:29,161
memorize what they're asking for.
And before you know it,

2044
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,510
you've given someone $30 for $20.

2045
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:33,460
Yeah.
At that,

2046
01:32:33,461 --> 01:32:38,461
someone did the Iowa.
It's a health club quite a few years 

2047
01:32:38,461 --> 01:32:38,461
ago.
And I'm like,

2048
01:32:38,461 --> 01:32:39,900
I came in and he went,
it's frankin.

2049
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,070
It was the owner.
I said no.

2050
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:45,790
He said all his chain for his wife and 
mentioned his wife's name.

2051
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:47,920
Uh,
okay.

2052
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,500
It's 20 quid.
So I went,

2053
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,710
alright,
give them 20 quid.

2054
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:55,900
That was it.
How many walks out and then front 

2055
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:55,900
combines,
you know,

2056
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:59,860
paid for that repair of that bracelet 
and what you donate.

2057
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:02,050
He'd come in a talk to someone at the 
battery bones.

2058
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,610
He works at isa bond.
Your front was from shorter?

2059
01:33:05,611 --> 01:33:06,100
no,
frank,

2060
01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:08,710
what's his wife's name?
Whatever her name was.

2061
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:13,870
And then they said the reception is the 
money.

2062
01:33:13,871 --> 01:33:15,220
Anything else?
You know,

2063
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:16,370
it was done.
So mesa,

2064
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:18,170
they.
So he gave you like a shitty change?

2065
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:20,620
Yeah,
but I just went over and gave him 20.

2066
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:21,670
You know,
that's.

2067
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:22,050
Yeah,

2068
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:26,340
that's a weird hustle,
that hustle of trying to confuse people,

2069
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:31,580
but there must be patterns that they try
to tap into and the way people recognize

2070
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:37,710
money or the way people count things as 
they try to disrupt and cars

2071
01:33:38,170 --> 01:33:39,780
numbers,
words,

2072
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:44,960
especially words that can confuse people
and send them off guard or we did a 

2073
01:33:45,391 --> 01:33:48,450
thing when we did the masters were 
neurolinguistic programming and we did a

2074
01:33:48,451 --> 01:33:51,560
thing called quantum linguistics,
which is really interesting.

2075
01:33:51,561 --> 01:33:56,561
It's really cool.
Makes you laugh because it's just makes 

2076
01:33:56,561 --> 01:33:58,200
it doesn't make no sense and one of the 
best language patterns I was saying.

2077
01:33:58,201 --> 01:33:59,850
I always,
when I was,

2078
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:02,140
when I was younger,
I was always self sabotaging.

2079
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:02,520
I said,
hell,

2080
01:34:02,521 --> 01:34:07,521
we sell sabotage,
and a guy called chris mannix did my 

2081
01:34:07,521 --> 01:34:11,091
masters with and I said as much and 
there's a wasp nest and I've got a 

2082
01:34:11,091 --> 01:34:16,071
stick.
Don't go near it because you'll get 

2083
01:34:16,071 --> 01:34:16,071
stung,
but because it was your.

2084
01:34:16,071 --> 01:34:16,110
I always thought,
fuck.

2085
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:21,150
anyway,
he'll get stoned and just see what 

2086
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:21,150
happens.
I'll fight.

2087
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:21,810
He's stupid.
A young read after anya and he said,

2088
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,850
what wouldn't happen if it pretended not
to do it?

2089
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:30,100
So when you said what wouldn't happen if
you pretended not to do it right?

2090
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,970
And I was like whoa.
And it just makes sense.

2091
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,650
Nobody sends your mind in it,
especially when you did not.

2092
01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:40,890
so that wouldn't happen if we pretended 
not to do it.

2093
01:34:40,921 --> 01:34:45,921
So if you pretend not to do it.
So if you're pretending not to do what 

2094
01:34:45,921 --> 01:34:47,700
you're doing,
but what wouldn't happen?

2095
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:53,020
Well you wouldn't get stuck.
It doesn't happen as you wouldn't get 

2096
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:53,020
stung.
Yeah.

2097
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,090
But what,
what tended not to do it.

2098
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:58,090
That's the sort of stone thing in that 
it's like what would not need

2099
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,120
to learn how to talk better?
Motherfucker.

2100
01:35:00,121 --> 01:35:03,320
You're talking crazy in that situation 
where you,

2101
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:05,270
when you,
when it's dropped on,

2102
01:35:05,271 --> 01:35:10,271
you know,
don't knock on top on the shoulder and 

2103
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:11,711
say,
well we'll never be done in the cliche 

2104
01:35:11,711 --> 01:35:15,971
therapy thing and the therapy situation 
and it's when it's put into its glided 

2105
01:35:15,971 --> 01:35:20,360
and with language works so smoothly.
Do you pay attention at all to cults?

2106
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:25,840
Do you pay attention to it?
Because I'm fascinated by people's 

2107
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,070
ability to control people,
other people's minds,

2108
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:33,280
behavior.
And I always wondered whether or not 

2109
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:37,120
like when you see like these,
you've seen the scientology documentary 

2110
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:37,120
going clear.
I've started watching it.

2111
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:41,000
I started watching.
It's fucking fascinating,

2112
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:41,560
man.
I've,

2113
01:35:41,561 --> 01:35:43,690
I've watched it three times.
I can't look away.

2114
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,670
I might watch it again.
Watch it.

2115
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:48,840
It's fucking crazy.
I love to watch it.

2116
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:49,360
It.
Well,

2117
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:50,400
I had experience.
I have,

2118
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:55,510
I've known several people that were 
scientologists but one of them was one 

2119
01:35:55,510 --> 01:35:56,990
of my neighbors and uh,
you know,

2120
01:35:56,991 --> 01:36:00,500
he and I had some weird exchange about,
his wife was going clear,

2121
01:36:00,501 --> 01:36:01,950
so I needed $50,000.

2122
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:05,150
I want 50 fucking grand.
Like whoa,

2123
01:36:05,151 --> 01:36:06,200
what's going on?
There was like,

2124
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:11,860
they're gonna do some ceremony and his 
wife will no longer be influenced by 

2125
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:16,750
outside pressure or outside thoughts or 
any anybody's criticisms or negativity 

2126
01:36:18,441 --> 01:36:20,480
should no longer.
They're no longer affect her.

2127
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:24,770
And they needed 50 grand for that.
And also what the fight.

2128
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:29,920
But he fucking look in his eye.
He was telling me like oranges have 

2129
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:29,920
vitamin c in them,
you know,

2130
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,020
for him it was like pretty 
straightforward obviously.

2131
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:38,110
And I've always been fascinated like 
what the fuck is going on with my friend

2132
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:41,570
named aiden perez?
He was into scientology.

2133
01:36:41,571 --> 01:36:43,490
I'm not really still is.
I don't think he is.

2134
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:45,730
But he went to pflag,
whIch is the base,

2135
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:49,220
the base where that at the scientologist
half the main place,

2136
01:36:49,221 --> 01:36:53,240
what they have.
And tom cruise's sister is named ada.

2137
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Sorry,
tom cruise's sister's child is named 

2138
01:36:59,000 --> 01:36:59,000
aiden after him.

2139
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,770
Whoa.
So he was into it.

2140
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:06,280
I went to it.
I went to a couple of times years and 

2141
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:10,330
years ago and then I creep me out of it.
But I don't know if whatever floats your

2142
01:37:11,091 --> 01:37:12,620
boat,
if it's not causing you any,

2143
01:37:12,621 --> 01:37:14,430
but I haven't seen that government class
out welding.

2144
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:19,700
So say I agree with that as well.
If it's not hurting you and what do I 

2145
01:37:21,381 --> 01:37:23,630
give a fuck?
I agree with that as well.

2146
01:37:23,930 --> 01:37:26,120
Until you start watching these 
documentaries,

2147
01:37:26,121 --> 01:37:27,890
you go,
well clearly it's hurting some people.

2148
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,020
It's definitely hurting people.
It's breaking up families.

2149
01:37:30,021 --> 01:37:30,310
It's,
it's,

2150
01:37:30,311 --> 01:37:32,810
it's really fucked up the way they 
attack some people that,

2151
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:35,660
that dissent or that leave or do.
I mean,

2152
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:40,690
if the people that are on the show,
the documentary that are telling if 

2153
01:37:40,690 --> 01:37:42,170
they're telling the truth and that's 
debatable,

2154
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:42,780
you know,
uh,

2155
01:37:42,870 --> 01:37:44,020
own the only thing.
No,

2156
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:45,170
and the people that they're talking 
about,

2157
01:37:45,171 --> 01:37:50,171
no,
there's some mind control going on 

2158
01:37:50,171 --> 01:37:50,171
there.
There's some,

2159
01:37:50,171 --> 01:37:51,350
there's some absolute definite mind 
control going on there.

2160
01:37:51,351 --> 01:37:55,470
And I wonder,
is that related in any way to hypnosis?

2161
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:56,010
The,
the

2162
01:37:56,010 --> 01:38:01,010
ability to these people have to 
manipulate these folks into the hitler 

2163
01:38:01,010 --> 01:38:01,680
speech,
mind camp,

2164
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:02,740
right?
Hitler did,

2165
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:08,350
you know,
some people maybe a search of for 

2166
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:10,761
something to be influenced you not so 
main sewings always going to be a lot 

2167
01:38:11,311 --> 01:38:12,000
easier,
you know,

2168
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:15,780
so I was going to be that I was going to
be susceptible people.

2169
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:18,180
There is always going to be susceptible 
people,

2170
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:23,310
but his cult like when you see like a 
jim jones speech or you know,

2171
01:38:23,311 --> 01:38:28,311
when,
when someone is giving some sort of a 

2172
01:38:28,311 --> 01:38:30,651
cultish speech,
is that similar in some ways to 

2173
01:38:30,651 --> 01:38:32,640
resonate?
It doesn't resonate with,

2174
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:34,110
with the,
with the person,

2175
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,940
with the paypal.
Um,

2176
01:38:36,390 --> 01:38:41,390
I won't say hypnosis,
but you'll say us to resonate with what 

2177
01:38:41,390 --> 01:38:41,630
they believe in and you know,
they,

2178
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:44,550
they,
they take floats the boat of gas,

2179
01:38:44,551 --> 01:38:46,050
you know what I mean?
It could again latch on.

2180
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:48,760
So it's like cold,
cold,

2181
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,820
cold reading,
cold reading,

2182
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:53,040
psychics,
you know,

2183
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:58,580
say stuff like I'm cold reading and 
halting by no means a different script.

2184
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:05,200
Still trying to think,
talking about how it's different 

2185
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:07,020
readings different.
I went to a couple of years ago was,

2186
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:09,210
you know,
it was roads in Greece.

2187
01:39:09,211 --> 01:39:10,500
Anyway,
I digress.

2188
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:15,700
And um,
we went over and we got stung by the 

2189
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:19,290
time share people and they deal anyway,
no one was going on and on to me and she

2190
01:39:19,321 --> 01:39:19,740
said,
uh,

2191
01:39:19,741 --> 01:39:23,700
what do you do in english?
And I'm a psychic psychic.

2192
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:24,600
Oh,
right.

2193
01:39:24,630 --> 01:39:29,630
I said,
you ought to know you had an accident 

2194
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:29,940
near walter,
a scam maybe before he was 10.

2195
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:33,050
I'm getting 10 for some reason.
While he was 10,

2196
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:34,080
she went,
yeah,

2197
01:39:34,081 --> 01:39:34,770
yeah,
you're right.

2198
01:39:34,771 --> 01:39:35,510
You're right.
Yeah,

2199
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:37,260
he did.
He got a scar on one of your knees?

2200
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:39,900
Yeah,
I've got a scar on my left knee.

2201
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:40,560
I thought.
Yeah,

2202
01:39:40,561 --> 01:39:42,570
I thought you did.
Do you know what I mean?

2203
01:39:42,571 --> 01:39:44,340
And you know,
you've been really,

2204
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:45,510
you've been,
you've had some,

2205
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:47,820
you know,
you've got some limelight,

2206
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:51,240
but you don't mind other people and 
you've asked a lot of close friends.

2207
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:52,830
You've got,
you've got a lot of friends.

2208
01:39:52,831 --> 01:39:54,510
we've only got a certain amount of 
clothes ones,

2209
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:56,730
so everyone resonates with that.
Like horoscopes.

2210
01:39:56,731 --> 01:39:59,730
Everyone saw like clings onto that and 
you know,

2211
01:39:59,731 --> 01:40:02,550
this is all sorts of psychics and people
say,

2212
01:40:02,590 --> 01:40:04,880
oh wow,
they knew this crazy.

2213
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:10,220
Yeah.
I have a friend who believes that 

2214
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:10,220
easily.
He went to somebody.

2215
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:10,220
He's like,
man,

2216
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:10,580
they told me all about my grandmother.
I'm like,

2217
01:40:10,581 --> 01:40:15,581
bitch,
don't you know about your grandmother 

2218
01:40:15,581 --> 01:40:18,500
telling you some shit you already know.
Kind of psychic is that it doesn't make 

2219
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:22,830
any sense and I never understood it 
until we had this guy.

2220
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:24,630
do you know who bannon check is?
Yes.

2221
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:28,260
A headband check on the scifi show,
joe rogan questions,

2222
01:40:28,261 --> 01:40:31,690
everything.
He was brilliant and stunning and scary.

2223
01:40:31,850 --> 01:40:35,430
It was scary how good he is at,
but also super honest.

2224
01:40:35,431 --> 01:40:36,450
He said,
I'll Tell you right now,

2225
01:40:36,451 --> 01:40:37,760
I don't.
I'm not a psychic,

2226
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:42,770
I don't have any psychic ability at all.
This is all bullshit and I hate when 

2227
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:46,590
people steal from people and rob them.
What I'm doing is entertainment and it's

2228
01:40:46,591 --> 01:40:50,280
a show and I have very specific 
techniques that I use to achieve this.

2229
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:51,060
Yeah,
that's why I don't.

2230
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:53,400
I can't think of anything else.
That's why I can't.

2231
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,100
That's why I don't fuck

2232
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:57,560
around when hypnosis and do this.
No,

2233
01:40:58,130 --> 01:40:59,070
no,
no.

2234
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:01,570
Well,
he was not the game is it?

2235
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:06,690
He wasn't doing hypnosis.
He was just pretending to be able to 

2236
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:08,110
read your mind and be able to put it.
It was all,

2237
01:41:08,111 --> 01:41:10,870
but he was really,
really clear about it.

2238
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,730
Saying,
these are just techniques.

2239
01:41:12,731 --> 01:41:16,930
I am not really seeing anything that 
other people can't see.

2240
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:21,100
I don't have any special ability,
but the people that do claim that like,

2241
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:22,660
god,
I don't know how it is in england,

2242
01:41:22,661 --> 01:41:27,661
but in California in particular,
you'll drive down the street and you'll 

2243
01:41:27,661 --> 01:41:30,250
see I'll say four or five of these 
fucking psychic readings kind of baptism

2244
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:32,530
that there's loads of chiropractors as 
well as low.

2245
01:41:32,531 --> 01:41:35,080
It's an american chiropractic bullshit.
Is that what you're saying?

2246
01:41:35,081 --> 01:41:40,081
Is the chiropractors,
and I see that tarot and driving on the 

2247
01:41:40,081 --> 01:41:41,220
street and counterparts,
they don't see that many in england.

2248
01:41:41,290 --> 01:41:43,510
A lot of people think chiropractors are 
bullshit too.

2249
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:46,270
Like a lot of reputable people think 
it's bullshit,

2250
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:50,320
but just moving your neck around and 
it's like click and killed.

2251
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,610
Yeah,
across a lot of money to go to 150 bucks

2252
01:41:54,611 --> 01:41:57,040
and then just getting twisted around pop
in your back.

2253
01:41:57,430 --> 01:42:02,430
But then some people say like there's 
certain things that chiropractors do 

2254
01:42:02,430 --> 01:42:03,100
that really are beneficial.
So the fuck.

2255
01:42:03,101 --> 01:42:04,950
Do you believe?
The ones I've.

2256
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:07,450
I've been to a couple of times.
They would have been here.

2257
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:13,880
They've been god's fellow right 
afterwards where there's this one guy 

2258
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:17,131
that used to work with a lot of fighters
and he was what they call a zone healer 

2259
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:20,760
and his idea was that he was like sort 
of tricking your body into healing 

2260
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:22,780
because he was sort of using the placebo
effect,

2261
01:42:22,781 --> 01:42:27,040
telling you that he was healing you by 
popping your neck or moving your body in

2262
01:42:27,041 --> 01:42:27,700
a certain way.

2263
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,790
But he really wasn't doing anything 
other than shit of normal chiropractor.

2264
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,720
I don't know.
Try not to pay attention to that shit.

2265
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:39,780
That stuff drives me nuts because it's 
deception and whether or not it's 

2266
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:41,410
effective or not is debatable because it
deception can be effective.

2267
01:42:41,411 --> 01:42:43,660
Right.
And isn't that sort of part of what,

2268
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:46,130
you know,
what the placebo effects,

2269
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:51,710
this is what I'm against in the next 
thing really is the point was trying to 

2270
01:42:51,881 --> 01:42:54,760
make it.
I don't fuck around with people,

2271
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:57,070
you know,
they come here for help.

2272
01:42:57,071 --> 01:43:02,071
The genuinely want your help.
You genuinely wants to get where they 

2273
01:43:02,071 --> 01:43:02,890
want to get to heaven.
You can't fuck around with people.

2274
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:04,200
Right.
It's not fair.

2275
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:04,850
They pay.
Yeah.

2276
01:43:05,190 --> 01:43:10,190
They looking for you to help them out.
I both effect because then the chief 

2277
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:10,540
something together,
you know,

2278
01:43:10,541 --> 01:43:15,541
it's good.
I like that there's a lot of these of 

2279
01:43:15,541 --> 01:43:19,250
shit and everything that went through 
there is more shocking shafts and good 

2280
01:43:19,631 --> 01:43:19,930
ones.

2281
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:21,310
You know what I mean?
And isn't that.

2282
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:27,280
It was also a lot.
There's a lot of manipulation and a lot 

2283
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,440
of charlatans and so almost every line 
of work.

2284
01:43:29,690 --> 01:43:31,450
Right.
But isn't that,

2285
01:43:31,550 --> 01:43:35,890
it's sort of relative to what we're 
talking about.

2286
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,800
It's like what is your focus like?
What are you trying to achieve?

2287
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:40,480
What are you trying to achieve as a 
coach,

2288
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:45,870
as a coach,
you're trying to help people and make 

2289
01:43:45,870 --> 01:43:47,701
them better.
What are you trying to achieve as 

2290
01:43:47,701 --> 01:43:49,471
whatever you're doing as a salesperson?
Are you trying to sell people something 

2291
01:43:49,471 --> 01:43:50,710
that's an actual great product,
like a really nice car,

2292
01:43:50,910 --> 01:43:52,880
like this is a car.
If you enjoy cars,

2293
01:43:52,881 --> 01:43:57,881
you will enjoy this car is great.
Or are you selling them a fucking shit 

2294
01:43:57,881 --> 01:44:01,970
box?
it's been taped together and it's going 

2295
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:01,970
to fall apart the moment they get it out
of the driveway.

2296
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:03,740
You know,
what is your ultimate goal?

2297
01:44:03,741 --> 01:44:08,741
You're trying to help people.
You're trying to have a beneficial 

2298
01:44:08,741 --> 01:44:12,281
mutually agreeable relationship or 
you're trying to read their poem and get

2299
01:44:12,471 --> 01:44:17,300
money out of their fucking with them on.
I amazing fucking amazing.

2300
01:44:17,301 --> 01:44:22,301
Like I never,
you know that success at joe's hot show 

2301
01:44:22,301 --> 01:44:25,070
shelling and the success that many of my
clients have had.

2302
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:30,490
I don't go.
It was me know because it's all about 

2303
01:44:30,490 --> 01:44:30,490
the client.
They do it,

2304
01:44:30,490 --> 01:44:35,290
I liked the,
I liked winning and of course there's 

2305
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:35,290
some sort of pat on the back for myself 
by me,

2306
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:38,770
but I don't run around like I amazing 
tile back.

2307
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:41,410
Or is it just an appreciation for the 
method,

2308
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:44,180
appreciation of the method and 
appreciate,

2309
01:44:44,181 --> 01:44:49,181
you know,
it doesn't stop shocking me how well it 

2310
01:44:49,181 --> 01:44:49,490
works at times,
you know,

2311
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:53,150
above 99 point nine percent of the time.
It's just a shock.

2312
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:58,360
Even now.
Even now that I've been involved in it 

2313
01:44:58,360 --> 01:44:58,360
eight years now,
he's just,

2314
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:03,640
I don't know,
it's just that light bulb goes off that 

2315
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:03,640
you can sell.
It pulls off and stopped around.

2316
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:05,570
AbouT how many years have you been doing
it full time,

2317
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:07,700
full time eight?
No,

2318
01:45:07,701 --> 01:45:10,400
I'm half and half,
but training as well.

2319
01:45:10,401 --> 01:45:11,830
Training fighters.
I was,

2320
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:14,330
and then I was trying to fight as it got
kind of bored of it.

2321
01:45:14,380 --> 01:45:19,380
I was at the chief what I wanted to 
fight as it reached a level and I was 

2322
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:22,550
getting bored and I wasn't giving him 
the attention I should do,

2323
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:26,630
so I decided to stop that and then I had
a regular job anyway.

2324
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:31,340
And then then I just started to get my 
coaching and word of mouth,

2325
01:45:31,341 --> 01:45:35,120
like you got to know me through word of 
mouth and then it just spread from there

2326
01:45:35,121 --> 01:45:38,200
and,
and it continues to do so still come and

2327
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:40,370
say no,
I still come and say it as well.

2328
01:45:40,371 --> 01:45:42,340
I'll come and say for infusion and from 
yoko,

2329
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:45,900
a moitai shells and smash moy tai as 
well as in england.

2330
01:45:45,930 --> 01:45:50,930
She's good shows and I still do de gea 
at gfc and you know,

2331
01:45:51,650 --> 01:45:56,650
different things like that.
But I still call and say it a lot for 

2332
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:58,400
your car when infusion and it's much 
more so I just do that as well.

2333
01:45:58,490 --> 01:46:00,890
But I just,
I got a lot of clients from America now.

2334
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:04,850
I'm gonna put stupid o'clock in the 
morning on skype,

2335
01:46:04,851 --> 01:46:05,850
but it's great.
Yeah.

2336
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:08,310
Was there an eight hour,
10 hour difference trina?

2337
01:46:10,470 --> 01:46:12,620
I genuinely bills that.
I love the.

2338
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:14,930
I like it.
Well that's great.

2339
01:46:14,931 --> 01:46:16,580
I mean that's really what life is all 
about.

2340
01:46:16,581 --> 01:46:21,581
Finding something that you really enjoy 
that you get that buzz off of and 

2341
01:46:21,581 --> 01:46:24,671
pursuing that.
And if You can make a living like an 

2342
01:46:24,671 --> 01:46:24,671
assignment.
And he can tell you animated by what you

2343
01:46:24,671 --> 01:46:25,450
do.
Well,

2344
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:30,600
I'm lucky that I found a bunch of 
different things that I really enjoyed 

2345
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:30,600
doing.
It just like this,

2346
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:31,280
that you could as well.
Well there.

2347
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:35,750
How about this?
The ability or the opportunity rather to

2348
01:46:35,751 --> 01:46:40,751
have a conversation like this regard.
like you sit down for hours totally 

2349
01:46:40,751 --> 01:46:42,080
uninterrupted.
It's very rare to get this.

2350
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:47,140
It's almost like the only way to get 
these kinds of conversations is to have 

2351
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:48,590
this kind of conversation where,
you know,

2352
01:46:48,591 --> 01:46:51,120
it's being broadcast because otherwise 
we'd be checking our phone.

2353
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:52,800
Would it be talking,
you know,

2354
01:46:52,801 --> 01:46:53,550
do you want a beer?

2355
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:58,550
Do you want to do this nadar this 
fucking guy is annoying and this thing 

2356
01:46:58,550 --> 01:47:00,340
is happening to me and I got a part and 
parcel with that.

2357
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:02,130
You wouldn't,
you probably wouldn't do that.

2358
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:04,350
But you know what I mean,
like this is this.

2359
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:09,351
The only way you have these intense one 
on one conversations is in a podcast 

2360
01:47:09,351 --> 01:47:13,851
form.
So in a lot of ways this podcast has 

2361
01:47:13,851 --> 01:47:14,270
been incredibly educational.
It's been like a,

2362
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:19,720
like a,
almost like a very varied university 

2363
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:22,740
course on a bunch of different 
disciplines and interests.

2364
01:47:22,810 --> 01:47:23,970
I appreciate it.
It's like,

2365
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:29,000
you know,
you said about Mike Mccullough and the 

2366
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:29,000
left hook and alIgned,
you know,

2367
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:29,000
and I went,
oh yeah,

2368
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,561
I forgot about him and like I'm not 
egotistical enough to think I know 

2369
01:47:33,561 --> 01:47:33,561
everything,
you know,

2370
01:47:33,790 --> 01:47:36,660
you know,
don't I seen,

2371
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:39,990
like I said,
a rapid induction course and the guy was

2372
01:47:39,991 --> 01:47:41,940
just like,
he was doing this hypnosis gun,

2373
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:43,690
he's going to sleep and this other guy 
was good.

2374
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,830
Right?
but isn't that similar like that fucking

2375
01:47:46,850 --> 01:47:49,050
those bullshit kung fu guys.
They're like,

2376
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:52,510
students fall to the ground.
I can do.

2377
01:47:52,650 --> 01:47:57,650
Don't you think that's.
Is that hypnosis to what is going on 

2378
01:47:57,650 --> 01:47:57,650
with that?
It is bullshit,

2379
01:47:57,970 --> 01:48:02,970
but is it just happening with the 
student cause this break the students 

2380
01:48:03,331 --> 01:48:05,380
though they're falling to the ground and
switching to a.

2381
01:48:05,390 --> 01:48:08,020
everybody's just daft out.
They are,

2382
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:13,140
they are they under the hypnosis power 
of suggestion that maybe it's a 

2383
01:48:14,941 --> 01:48:15,730
suggestion?
Well,

2384
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:17,730
maybe it's just the,
all of that.

2385
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:23,480
These.
There is a lot of way at people about 

2386
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:26,840
how idiots and you went to state in the 
middle of change.

2387
01:48:28,021 --> 01:48:30,420
The trajectory of the rocket that would 
have got me in trouble.

2388
01:48:30,450 --> 01:48:31,590
That is the problem,
right?

2389
01:48:31,591 --> 01:48:34,380
Like some people have big noses and some
people are idiots.

2390
01:48:34,381 --> 01:48:36,320
Some people got gray and some people.
Yeah.

2391
01:48:36,410 --> 01:48:40,620
It's like the genetics very.
There's not everybody could be einstein.

2392
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:41,350
No,
no,

2393
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:46,510
no.
Some people you go high and they follow 

2394
01:48:46,510 --> 01:48:46,510
the ground.

2395
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:51,620
I've,
I've seen some videos of fake kung fu 

2396
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:53,991
and it's fucking amazing.
Like there's this one dude and he was 

2397
01:48:53,991 --> 01:48:57,690
teaching this class and he had this,
this girl and he was moving her back and

2398
01:48:57,691 --> 01:48:59,930
forth and back and forth like,
like,

2399
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:05,040
like a comedy.
Like it was a comedy but it was real 

2400
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:05,100
and,
and he,

2401
01:49:05,101 --> 01:49:10,101
you know,
he'd make her dance and shock her and 

2402
01:49:10,101 --> 01:49:11,040
then she would fall to the ground and 
she was one.

2403
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:16,420
Now that guY gets his students like a 
big bellied guy gay on.

2404
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:21,510
And then she does this,
gave him an oscar.

2405
01:49:21,511 --> 01:49:26,511
That was a right performance.
And seniors like flops on the deck and 

2406
01:49:26,511 --> 01:49:29,181
he's our flu.
Indiana was propofol naming because I'm 

2407
01:49:29,181 --> 01:49:29,181
here at the moment in America.
We,

2408
01:49:29,181 --> 01:49:29,181
Jordan Watson,
who's a,

2409
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:34,310
like super tight and we was watching it.
He was pacing ourselves often is 

2410
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:34,470
phoning.
Well,

2411
01:49:34,471 --> 01:49:35,940
there's a lot of that out there,
man.

2412
01:49:35,941 --> 01:49:38,700
There's a lot of that fake kung fu stuff
out there.

2413
01:49:38,710 --> 01:49:43,200
Less and less now than there was in 1993
when the ufc came along.

2414
01:49:43,201 --> 01:49:45,570
That's one of the things that the ufc 
has done that's amazing,

2415
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:48,370
is eradicate a of the bullshit martial

2416
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:53,370
arts.
There's a lot of fake practitioners out 

2417
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:53,370
there.
And you know,

2418
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:57,480
eddie bravo has this hilarious story of 
this fake kung fu teacher that he was 

2419
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:58,810
taking lessons under.
you know,

2420
01:49:58,811 --> 01:50:00,340
he's a young kid.
He didn't know any better.

2421
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:05,580
And uh,
the guy was going to China to study 

2422
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:05,580
under his master and he rang,
eddy,

2423
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:10,411
ran into them at the supermarket when 
the guy was supposed to be in China to 

2424
01:50:10,411 --> 01:50:13,370
fuck.
And they didn't realize that isn't 

2425
01:50:13,370 --> 01:50:13,370
taking conch food.
Just making shit up.

2426
01:50:13,370 --> 01:50:16,510
Like everything he was doing was just 
totally made up.

2427
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:22,940
Karate chop of people on top of the head
and saying you'd kill them if you hit 

2428
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:24,160
them correctly,
but it's that,

2429
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:29,190
that sort of make dojo type fake martial
arts stuff was really,

2430
01:50:29,950 --> 01:50:34,950
really,
really prevalent a few decades ago if I 

2431
01:50:34,950 --> 01:50:38,020
grew up with drunken master there and 
all of them in all the,

2432
01:50:38,021 --> 01:50:38,590
uh,
run run,

2433
01:50:38,591 --> 01:50:39,310
shaw,
mavis,

2434
01:50:39,311 --> 01:50:40,360
you know,
golden harvest.

2435
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:44,050
Well those are fun to watch,
to pretend you know,

2436
01:50:44,051 --> 01:50:48,460
you watched an old jackie chan movie and
it's fucking crazy shit.

2437
01:50:48,461 --> 01:50:51,520
But the chunk of masters,
that one.

2438
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:52,970
Yeah,
I was beating them over.

2439
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:55,520
See,
it's out some seed.

2440
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:58,460
It's funny comedy though.
It seems funny.

2441
01:50:58,461 --> 01:50:59,500
Yeah.
But it's still,

2442
01:50:59,501 --> 01:51:00,030
it's still,
uh,

2443
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:01,360
still there.
and I tell you,

2444
01:51:01,361 --> 01:51:03,520
I really liked police story with jackie 
chan.

2445
01:51:03,521 --> 01:51:05,260
The first one.
That was good.

2446
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:06,510
That was wicked.
That was,

2447
01:51:06,530 --> 01:51:11,530
he managed jackie shanghainese.
But a lot of those movies had people 

2448
01:51:11,530 --> 01:51:14,671
believe in it.
There were people out there that had ci 

2449
01:51:14,671 --> 01:51:14,671
and depth touch and try,
you know,

2450
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:16,570
when,
when you want.

2451
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:17,540
I just,
I mean,

2452
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:20,910
to bring it back to what you do.
Do you,

2453
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:23,680
do you think there's any of that?
That's hypnosis.

2454
01:51:23,681 --> 01:51:28,681
Is there anything that's similar to what
I said Frank Santos used to be able to 

2455
01:51:28,681 --> 01:51:28,681
do?

2456
01:51:28,681 --> 01:51:29,980
Um,
I don't know.

2457
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,370
Is it the only slide?
I don't know.

2458
01:51:32,430 --> 01:51:35,600
Devotion that they have towards their 
sensei or there?

2459
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:36,690
There's,
yeah,

2460
01:51:36,730 --> 01:51:38,280
it's bananas.
Honestly.

2461
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:41,190
It's crazy.
They believe what he says.

2462
01:51:41,191 --> 01:51:42,140
So he's like,
oh yay,

2463
01:51:42,141 --> 01:51:44,550
you can do this and,
but how is that different than a guy who

2464
01:51:44,551 --> 01:51:49,551
thinks like,
I watched a guy who thought he was 

2465
01:51:49,551 --> 01:51:51,651
having sex with madonna and he came in 
his pants because Frank Santos put that 

2466
01:51:51,651 --> 01:51:54,300
in his head and he did that.
I wAtched it and the guy was like,

2467
01:51:54,301 --> 01:51:59,301
he didn't know.
He came in and I mean this guy wasn't 

2468
01:51:59,301 --> 01:51:59,301
that good of an actor.
He just wasn't.

2469
01:51:59,301 --> 01:52:00,120
He was embarrassed.
You know what to do.

2470
01:52:00,540 --> 01:52:05,540
Hey,
kinda like slumped over and sat and 

2471
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:05,540
acquaint.
If he was,

2472
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:06,540
if he was a ham,
he would have spent.

2473
01:52:06,630 --> 01:52:10,310
It just was,
you could tell this guy really bad it

2474
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:15,660
at that particular time where he was at 
that particular in that particular 

2475
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:15,660
place.
He did believe it.

2476
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:20,161
I mean,
you've seen people with needles when 

2477
01:52:20,161 --> 01:52:20,630
they need,
you know,

2478
01:52:20,650 --> 01:52:23,990
they have a needle and they don't feel 
the pain you can do,

2479
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:29,730
you can do that.
And there's an interesting one called 

2480
01:52:29,730 --> 01:52:33,151
pain paradigm,
which I'll talk to you about another 

2481
01:52:33,151 --> 01:52:33,151
time on,
um,

2482
01:52:33,151 --> 01:52:35,070
anticipation next week it was.
And um,

2483
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:40,640
you know,
I mean just at least there's all sorts 

2484
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:43,861
of things that we,
who knows what the mindscape we'd only 

2485
01:52:43,861 --> 01:52:46,610
just now I'm only a postman of 
information.

2486
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:47,360
Rarely,
I mean,

2487
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:50,270
what really can meet it,
what will he develop it.

2488
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:51,950
That's an interesting way to describe 
it.

2489
01:52:51,951 --> 01:52:54,000
A posted minimum from asphalt.
Keith miami,

2490
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:56,230
first teacher said we just posted one of
information.

2491
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:57,340
I like that.
Yeah.

2492
01:52:57,660 --> 01:52:58,250
Um,
I,

2493
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:01,370
I just,
I'm really fascinated by the,

2494
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:06,880
the full spectrum,
for lack of a better term of 

2495
01:53:07,730 --> 01:53:11,330
possibilities of suggestion that you can
go from,

2496
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:15,440
you know,
fake psychics and fake healers.

2497
01:53:15,441 --> 01:53:19,490
And like my friend Brian and I were the 
comedy store last night.

2498
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:24,670
Did you see that?
Were you there when you saw the woman 

2499
01:53:24,670 --> 01:53:24,670
was trying to do the reiki healing on 
us?

2500
01:53:24,670 --> 01:53:29,020
It was hilarious because I knew I was 
going to talk to you today and I knew 

2501
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:30,170
she was full of shit.
She probably thinks it's real,

2502
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:32,210
but she was like,
can you feel the energy?

2503
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:34,820
I'm like raving.
Like she said,

2504
01:53:34,821 --> 01:53:36,150
put your,
put your left hand out.

2505
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:36,310
[inaudible]

2506
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,960
left hands are more sensitive,
more susceptible or.

2507
01:53:38,970 --> 01:53:43,970
Okay.
So I had my hand out and she is like 

2508
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:45,240
running her hand over the top and the 
bottom line.

2509
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:48,140
Not touching my hand,
but getting close to it like,

2510
01:53:48,141 --> 01:53:49,610
do you feel it?
Do you feel anything?

2511
01:53:49,611 --> 01:53:51,140
And I'm like,
nope,

2512
01:53:51,230 --> 01:53:53,300
I'm trying.
I'm trying to be open minded but I don't

2513
01:53:53,301 --> 01:53:55,370
feel anything.
But some people would be like,

2514
01:53:55,371 --> 01:53:56,600
yes,
I do feel it.

2515
01:53:56,780 --> 01:54:00,210
I think it's what you want to believe.
My believes like,

2516
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:03,320
like people that say kicks nico to cds,
tarot card readers,

2517
01:54:03,330 --> 01:54:05,960
etc.
If they give people comfort,

2518
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:09,170
I make some people feel better and you 
know,

2519
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:10,970
right.
Got more power to him.

2520
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:12,150
Right.
More power to them.

2521
01:54:12,151 --> 01:54:15,360
They believe at the time if they believe
that there's this reiki,

2522
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:21,520
and then if they believe it and it works
and people are happy doing it and we 

2523
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:21,710
might meet,
might go,

2524
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:23,320
well,
it's,

2525
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:24,800
where's the line drawn?

2526
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:27,530
Is the line drawn when you're taking 
money from them?

2527
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:31,280
There is pissed take isn't the world.
And they piss take piss takers.

2528
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:33,070
What does,
um,

2529
01:54:33,390 --> 01:54:34,550
you know,
taking the piss.

2530
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,360
Well,
okay,

2531
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:38,840
you guys are fucking with somebody 
taking the piss.

2532
01:54:40,510 --> 01:54:41,320
Yeah.
But um,

2533
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:46,420
but more so than that,
someone who is pretending to be healing,

2534
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:50,300
but they're stealing money from you.
They're not really healing you nice.

2535
01:54:50,410 --> 01:54:55,410
But it's like anyone that sells a 
vitamin that have this snake oil,

2536
01:54:56,130 --> 01:54:57,000
snake oil,
yeah,

2537
01:54:57,410 --> 01:54:59,990
snake all take this and you'll 
definitely changed.

2538
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:03,050
But what about fucking the real placebo 
effect?

2539
01:55:03,051 --> 01:55:08,051
That's where it gets really weird 
because like there are some placebos 

2540
01:55:08,051 --> 01:55:11,720
they have introduced to people and 
they've told them it's a placebo and 

2541
01:55:12,291 --> 01:55:15,410
then the,
but the act of doing something,

2542
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:20,740
the act of taking something actually has
a more beneficial effect than not doing 

2543
01:55:20,740 --> 01:55:21,800
anything.
Which is again,

2544
01:55:21,801 --> 01:55:26,801
the power of the mind,
like the placebo effect is a real 

2545
01:55:26,801 --> 01:55:26,801
effect.
You give someone something,

2546
01:55:26,801 --> 01:55:30,290
you tell them this is medicine,
this is going to fix whatever ails you.

2547
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:33,650
And it actually does work on a certain 
percentage,

2548
01:55:33,651 --> 01:55:38,651
a statistically significant percentage 
of the people that are like crystals and

2549
01:55:39,230 --> 01:55:41,990
shit was like a lot of people believe 
in.

2550
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:44,120
They pull up with around and they were 
getting good

2551
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:45,750
luck.
Good luck coin.

2552
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:47,880
Yeah.
I've got my lucky quarter dumbo,

2553
01:55:47,881 --> 01:55:48,400
isn't it?
You know,

2554
01:55:48,410 --> 01:55:48,770
the,
the,

2555
01:55:48,930 --> 01:55:50,280
the,
a feather.

2556
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:51,830
Lucky further,
you know,

2557
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,810
and he believes he can fly with it.
They're lucky feather.

2558
01:55:53,830 --> 01:55:56,640
It comes down to how the rest,
um,

2559
01:55:57,260 --> 01:55:57,780
yeah,
he sold it,

2560
01:55:57,781 --> 01:56:00,780
I think sold down to your business all 
down of what you put into your intention

2561
01:56:00,781 --> 01:56:02,400
and what you want to belief for 
yourself.

2562
01:56:02,401 --> 01:56:03,630
You know,
isn't it

2563
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:07,500
weird that we have these minds that have
such amazing potential,

2564
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:12,830
but there's no fucking real good 
guidebook that anybody's handed and 

2565
01:56:12,830 --> 01:56:17,181
you're sort of supposed to figure it out
on your own or based on if you're lucky.

2566
01:56:17,371 --> 01:56:22,371
You have parents that have their shit 
together and they sort of give you a 

2567
01:56:22,371 --> 01:56:24,840
rough outline of how you should live 
your life or live by example,

2568
01:56:24,841 --> 01:56:29,841
but we're not talking about like 
goldfish or swans or anything fucking 

2569
01:56:30,421 --> 01:56:35,421
simple.
We're talking about human beings with 

2570
01:56:35,421 --> 01:56:37,191
complex languages in mathematics and 
culture and society and laws and and,

2571
01:56:37,390 --> 01:56:41,600
and money and all of the weirdness that 
comes with being a person in it.

2572
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:43,460
Good.
Though it is

2573
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:48,680
select site in.
Well that is six assignment from a 

2574
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:49,980
bloodline of merlin and sherlock.
Yes,

2575
01:56:50,010 --> 01:56:51,990
and melon homes.
Real estate.

2576
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:54,120
But that's.
I just liked that.

2577
01:56:54,350 --> 01:56:54,930
I didn't,
I just,

2578
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:56,640
I liked the,
I liked the mystery.

2579
01:56:56,850 --> 01:57:00,820
I do too because you can see.
You're probably saying,

2580
01:57:00,821 --> 01:57:02,310
well,
I like that.

2581
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:03,990
It's interesting and that's what keeps 
you,

2582
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:09,320
keeps you going in life.
I think when you find something 

2583
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:09,320
interesting and yet you're trying to,
you know,

2584
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:12,720
it's always better to be interested,
interested instead of interesting.

2585
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:13,790
Oh yeah,
no,

2586
01:57:13,940 --> 01:57:18,940
for sure.
I mean that's one of the things that I 

2587
01:57:18,940 --> 01:57:21,041
appreciate most about being able to do 
this podcast is that I'm constantly and 

2588
01:57:21,041 --> 01:57:24,300
consistently inspired and curious.
I'm always learning like this use,

2589
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:27,470
you can't know everything.
It is not possible.

2590
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:30,470
There's too much going on and once you 
accept that,

2591
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:35,500
then you just looking for stuff that you
find stimulating and then find more and 

2592
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:39,971
more things that you find fascinating 
and this podcast has given me this 

2593
01:57:39,971 --> 01:57:43,901
really unique opportunity to talk to 
people like you or know anybody who has 

2594
01:57:43,901 --> 01:57:45,980
some information that I'm not really 
aware of.

2595
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:51,390
Pro.
Massively honored to be on air because 

2596
01:57:51,390 --> 01:57:51,390
you know,
I'm from.

2597
01:57:51,390 --> 01:57:52,420
I'm from liverpool,
I'm from newton.

2598
01:57:52,450 --> 01:57:52,900
Yeah,
I know,

2599
01:57:52,910 --> 01:57:54,070
but you know,
I'm just like,

2600
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:54,480
yeah,
but you,

2601
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:57,430
nobody's going in there.
And then joe says so nice things in.

2602
01:57:57,431 --> 01:58:02,431
Mccall says nice things and I get to do 
seminars and get to meet people and I 

2603
01:58:02,431 --> 01:58:04,560
love it.
I'm just bold enough about them.

2604
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:09,820
well that's what life is all about,
really is finding something like that 

2605
01:58:09,820 --> 01:58:10,760
that you really enjoy doing and then 
pursuing it and then if you can,

2606
01:58:11,210 --> 01:58:12,860
god,
if you can make a living doing that,

2607
01:58:12,861 --> 01:58:14,210
what a,
what a great way to be,

2608
01:58:14,270 --> 01:58:14,750
you know?

2609
01:58:15,030 --> 01:58:15,930
Yeah.
I like people.

2610
01:58:15,931 --> 01:58:18,720
I like,
you know,

2611
01:58:18,721 --> 01:58:23,721
I like people like I don't like everyone
on as a client because some people just 

2612
01:58:23,721 --> 01:58:23,721
think.
No,

2613
01:58:23,721 --> 01:58:23,890
no.

2614
01:58:25,780 --> 01:58:30,330
Have you had like people that are like 
shitty or just not appreciative,

2615
01:58:30,350 --> 01:58:33,730
kind of suss them out quickly?
Do you try to explain to them why you're

2616
01:58:33,731 --> 01:58:36,070
not doing this and maybe give them like 
some

2617
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:37,710
uh,
yeah,

2618
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:39,540
I hope future.
Yeah.

2619
01:58:39,630 --> 01:58:42,070
I just,
yeah,

2620
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:47,080
I just say well I can't.
Or embassy or just the normal stuff and 

2621
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:49,270
you know,
it depends on what it is.

2622
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:51,010
It's not often.
I'll be honest with you.

2623
01:58:51,011 --> 01:58:53,940
It's not often that happens,
but um,

2624
01:58:54,590 --> 01:58:55,510
yeah,
it does happen.

2625
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:58,740
I just handed her the,
you know,

2626
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:01,420
these one guy saying it was one guy 
recently.

2627
01:59:01,421 --> 01:59:02,080
He's like,
yeah,

2628
01:59:02,980 --> 01:59:07,980
everyone in my team thinks I'm rubbish.
I can't fight and I can't talk to you 

2629
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:08,430
now.
My wife's in bed and just like,

2630
01:59:08,431 --> 01:59:09,500
oh,
that don't know.

2631
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,350
Right.
You know,

2632
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:12,250
just loads of things you have to stop.
No,

2633
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:16,000
that's too much work.
Like if you can't see what she has salt,

2634
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:18,610
no sovereignty.
I see much hustle.

2635
01:59:18,770 --> 01:59:20,810
Yeah.
But like on the docks triumphant,

2636
01:59:20,870 --> 01:59:25,870
I like that everyone had a gym.
I know people that went didn't win 

2637
01:59:25,870 --> 01:59:26,820
fights on the door jams and they went 
under me.

2638
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:27,820
I like,
ah,

2639
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:30,550
casey,
she's good.

2640
01:59:30,670 --> 01:59:32,970
So then I would just give them that 
boston,

2641
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:34,370
you feel good about it,
you sort of thing.

2642
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:39,390
Yes,
I've achieved something that other 

2643
01:59:39,390 --> 01:59:39,390
people didn't like that.
Right?

2644
01:59:39,390 --> 01:59:40,780
Yeah.
The ability to help people.

2645
01:59:40,870 --> 01:59:45,870
And the,
the satisfaction that comes from other 

2646
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:46,560
people benefiting from your efforts?
Yeah.

2647
01:59:46,690 --> 01:59:47,710
Is a very nice thing.

2648
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:53,430
A light.
It's in a question lady called donna 

2649
01:59:53,430 --> 01:59:55,650
tainter at the minute.
She's soft got where she is somewhere in

2650
01:59:55,651 --> 01:59:56,960
the states and she's,
they rarely.

2651
01:59:56,970 --> 01:59:59,880
Well it's just a transformation has been
incredible.

2652
01:59:59,881 --> 02:00:00,480
And she's,
you know,

2653
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:04,420
all the students are so much better to 
have sponsors like really warm inserters

2654
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:09,490
you ride in better and stuff like that.
And he's just moving things out of 

2655
02:00:09,490 --> 02:00:09,660
people's way is kicking out.

2656
02:00:09,700 --> 02:00:11,800
All right.
So if people want to get ahold of you,

2657
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:15,550

2658

Vinny shoreman.
What is it?

2659
02:00:17,071 --> 02:00:17,960
What do they need?
Shelter.

2660
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:23,820
The reason why it's called shelter,
I'm it's not perverted in 69 shell time 

2661
02:00:23,820 --> 02:00:25,790
as I used to be a comment say for 16 
hours.

2662
02:00:25,820 --> 02:00:27,940
The arrows bond.
Oh no,

2663
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:29,930
that's a problem,
right?

2664
02:00:30,030 --> 02:00:31,120
Isn't it?
That number.

2665
02:00:31,121 --> 02:00:34,540
So it's gonna have to change that.
I think a lot of great cars.

2666
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:37,450
