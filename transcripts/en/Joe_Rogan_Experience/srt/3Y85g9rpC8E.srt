1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,860
Okay rogan

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,920
experience

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,603
paradise.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,540
Why are you right now?

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,610
And uh,

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,240
I was gonna I was gonna Watch the Bisping
fight the Bisbing Kelvin guests limb

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,700
fight live and uh,

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,570
do like sort of a breakdown
of it while it was happening.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,690
But the shit was going on at like two
o'clock in the morning out here and

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,203
it wasn't happening.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,320
I have been eating like
a pig and drinking.

12
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:42,880
I've been doing vacation type shit.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,320
I'm a strong believer in that
you need to do vacation time.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,250
Like vacation time is important.

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,170
You can't just be working all the time.

16
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,050
Occasionally you have to just fuck off.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,360
And so that's what I've been doing.

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,410
I just been fucking off.

19
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:00,190
So I,

20
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,520
I was tired and I decided I
am not going to stay up late.

21
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,410
And so I watched it in the morning.

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,260
I watched it this morning and I've
got a couple of thoughts on it.

23
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:10,130
First of all,

24
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,600
um,

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,010
Brennan Chub said this on his
Instagram and I could not agree more.

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,760
I don't think you should be allowed to
fight three weeks after you have a brutal

27
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:25,850
fight like Michael Bisping did with GSP.

28
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,230
He got rocked,

29
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,470
he got choked unconscious and then
three weeks later he's fighting a really

30
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:34,364
dangerous,

31
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:35,730
yeah,

32
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,450
young and up and coming Kelvin
gas alum and Calvin is a beast.

33
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:43,140
He's gotten nasty boxing and that
is what he showed in that fight.

34
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,470
He hit him with a beautiful straight right
jab and a right hand behind it and oh

35
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:50,671
my goodness.

36
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:51,504
It was just,

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,250
that kid is just on fire.

38
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:53,591
He's,

39
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,230
he's just on another level right now.

40
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,070
I'm super,

41
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:57,420
super impressed with Calvin.

42
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,590
Calvin has got lightening
fast hands and he's,

43
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,620
he's an interesting guy because
he's what I would call a tweener.

44
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,600
And what that means is that I don't,

45
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,950
I mean I think Kelvin

46
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,433
in

47
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,510
in the best,

48
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,350
best of times,

49
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:20,550
like if Calvin has the best camp
and the the best performance,

50
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:23,760
it's entirely possible that he
could beat anybody at 185 pounds.

51
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,640
But should he be at 185 pounds?

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:27,751
Boy,

53
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:31,740
I don't know because Chris
Weidman is that 185 pounds.

54
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:33,840
And when Chris Weidman
got Calvin to the ground,

55
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:36,690
it really did look like you're talking
about two completely different weight

56
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:37,524
classes.

57
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,720
And Chris Weidman was
able to show Calvin out.

58
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:44,721
And obviously Weidman is a former champion
and there's absolutely no shame in

59
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,290
losing to Chris Weidman,

60
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,180
but it's just the way

61
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,990
it looked when you were
watching the fight.

62
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:54,810
To me it looked like two
different weight classes.

63
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:55,831
And,

64
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:56,664
um,

65
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,970
there's a lot of people that think that
really Calvin should be fighting at 170

66
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,190
pounds if he got the proper diet.

67
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,430
And he was doing that for a while.

68
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,190
Uh,

69
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,510
it was at one point in time,

70
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:08,500
he was,

71
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,423
uh,

72
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:10,751
uh,

73
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:11,110
no,

74
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,080
dolce was working with
them for a while and,

75
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:14,321
uh,

76
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:18,850
he had his diet in line and
he looked fantastic and then,

77
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,721
you know,

78
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:23,800
just things happen and he didn't
want to pay the dolce money.

79
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,431
And,

80
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,264
uh,

81
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,990
I dunno who he's working with
right now as a nutritionist,

82
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,340
but I just,

83
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:31,174
uh,

84
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,210
I think he's a phenomenal fighter.

85
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,810
I just don't know if 185 pounds is,

86
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,400
is the right way class form.

87
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,653
It could be.

88
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,081
I mean,

89
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:45,100
it could be that maybe what he really
needs to do is just lose some body fat,

90
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,810
put on some muscle and maybe 185
pounds will be his weight class.

91
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:54,811
It's just that constant debate of whether
or not you should weaken your body and

92
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,800
dropped down to the minimum weight you
can or whether or not you should fight at

93
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:05,170
a natural way and have a healthy body.

94
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:05,880
It's,

95
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,970
it's a real good argument.

96
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,880
And I'm pausing right now
because I'm pulling something up.

97
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,113
Uh,

98
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,270
there's a girl that
just died in Australia.

99
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,080
Uh,

100
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,010
she died

101
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,220
very recently.

102
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,453
Uh,

103
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,040
she was preparing for a
Moitai fight and it's just,

104
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,520
it's just part of what
this sport is about.

105
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,020
Unfortunately.

106
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:31,450
It did really bothers the
fucking shit out of me.

107
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,190
I think it's the scariest thing.

108
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,180
Uh,

109
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,751
I think,

110
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:35,584
um,

111
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,341
yeah.

112
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:36,791
Here it is.

113
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,200
Teenager dies training.

114
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,470
Here it is.

115
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,090
Um,

116
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,350
the,

117
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,480
the girl's name,

118
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,590
she was 18 years old and uh,

119
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,050
her name was Jessica Lindsey and she
died while she was cutting weight.

120
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,630
She was an amateur
kickboxer and Australia.

121
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,693
Um,

122
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,580
I cut weight a bunch of times when I
was doing taekwondo tournaments and,

123
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:57,850
uh,

124
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,780
it is brutal.

125
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,890
It's,

126
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,820
it's terrible.

127
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,110
I was bad at it too.

128
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:03,370
I didn't do it correctly.

129
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:07,900
I just worked out real hard the night
before and more rubber suits and the whole

130
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:12,640
deal and dehydrated myself and I
didn't rehydrate myself well either.

131
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:15,340
So I felt like shit the next
day when I was fighting.

132
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,391
And,

133
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:16,581
uh,

134
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:19,660
a lot of wrestlers back in the
day used to do the same thing.

135
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,650
Um,

136
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,650
my weight cut though was nowhere near as
extreme as some of the MMA fighters do.

137
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,670
Some MMA fighters.

138
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:28,210
I mean,

139
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,460
they're getting on death's door and,

140
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:31,294
um,

141
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,313
I just,

142
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,980
I just think it's a,

143
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:39,070
one of the most disturbing and a
most unfortunate aspects of MMA.

144
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:40,930
Uh,

145
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,520
Kevin Lee said before his last
fight with Tony Ferguson that,

146
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:45,731
you know,

147
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:46,570
he felt like he was,

148
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,430
he was dying when he was cutting weight
and he made the weight Habib number go

149
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:50,801
Madoff,

150
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:51,634
who is the,

151
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,320
if not the best,

152
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:56,020
one of the very best
lightweights in the world.

153
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,080
Um,

154
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,010
undefeated

155
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,400
had his body shut down last time.

156
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:04,790
He tried to make the weight and
couldn't make the Tony Ferguson fight.

157
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,800
They pulled him out and
took him to the hospital.

158
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,431
I mean,

159
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:07,990
I'm,

160
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,210
I'm beating a dead horse here cause
it's something that everybody knows.

161
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:13,970
Everybody's aware that it's a terrible,

162
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,160
terrible aspect of our sport.

163
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,210
And in my mind it's contrary to what
martial arts is supposed to be about.

164
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,560
So in that sense,

165
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,130
I encourage Kelvin to stay at 185 pounds
because obviously the guy's knocked out

166
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:31,940
Vidor Belford at one 85 he just
knocked out a former champion,

167
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:34,370
Michael Bisbing at 185 pounds.

168
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:34,641
I mean,

169
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:39,641
he could knock on anybody at one 85 but
a guy like Chris Weidman who is very

170
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:43,040
smart about cutting weight,

171
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,570
he cuts a lot of weight,

172
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,830
but he does it the right way.

173
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:48,680
Rehydrates the right way and
he's just a fucking beast.

174
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:49,880
He's just so much bigger.

175
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,660
And when he got Kelvin to the ground and
submitted him with a head and arm choke

176
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,681
boy,

177
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,470
it just really seemed like that's
the wrong way class for Calvin.

178
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,020
And then you see Calvin next fight,

179
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,110
fight Bisbing and just fucking
lights him up in the first round.

180
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Now would he have been able to do
that if he fought the Bisbing that was

181
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:11,330
training for George Saint Pierre.

182
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,080
I mean,

183
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,830
if Bisping did not have the George Saint
Pierre fight and it just went right

184
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:19,520
into the Calvin Gasland fight
with the same result of happen,

185
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,190
it could very well have
the way Calvin hits,

186
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,720
he's fast as fuck.

187
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:24,890
His hands are beautiful.

188
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,490
He throws really crisp straight punches.

189
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,510
And in this sport it's,

190
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,480
there's not a whole lot
of guys who have crisper,

191
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,680
sharper hands at 185 pounds.

192
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:38,514
Then Calvin,

193
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:38,931
I mean,

194
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:43,931
he just has beautiful head movement and
boxing and when he moves in for the kill

195
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:44,960
with those hands,

196
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,040
whoa.

197
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,600
When you saw the Vito Belfort fight,

198
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,760
I mean he just fucking be tore up,

199
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:54,640
but those straight punches and he throws
them efficiently and they have snapped

200
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,101
to them.

201
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:55,934
And just,

202
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,110
and on top of that,

203
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,400
he's a very good wrestler.

204
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:58,851
I mean,

205
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:02,360
a lot of people forget how good his
wrestling skills are on top of all that.

206
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,210
He's just a real threat at 185 pounds.

207
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Fascinating thing because it's
just such a wide open division.

208
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:11,510
He just called out,

209
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,883
um,

210
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,873
Robert Whitaker,

211
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,100
who was the interim champion of course,

212
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,210
and a call that Whittaker
and wants Whitaker to,

213
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:20,600
uh,

214
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,890
to fight him next.

215
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,353
But of course,

216
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,870
Robert Whitaker is a
waiting for the big pay day.

217
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:29,690
I would too if I was him
to fight George St Pierre.

218
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:31,640
So it's a,

219
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,250
it's a wide open division now
that Saint Pierre choked out.

220
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:37,730
Michael Bisbing and then
Gelt Kelvin just lights up.

221
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,573
Bisping.

222
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,970
And of course,

223
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,210
you've got to think that
Weidman is still in the mix.

224
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,601
I mean,

225
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:47,030
even though why been lost to Yoel Romero.

226
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,000
And then last two gig garden was saucy.

227
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,260
He's still in the mix.

228
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:51,780
Uh,

229
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,990
he was winning that Yoel Romero fight,

230
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,650
in my opinion until he got caught,

231
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:57,060
was that wicked flying knee.

232
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,300
But that's the danger
of fighting Gol Romero,

233
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,760
you all Romero could do that
to anybody in the world.

234
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:04,980
He's just such a fucking freak athlete.

235
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,660
Uh,

236
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,493
so really,

237
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,200
really wide open division.

238
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:14,040
I'm bombed as fuck that
gay guard went over.

239
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:14,971
And,

240
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,210
uh,

241
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,021
decided to,

242
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:16,200
uh,

243
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,160
fight for bell tour,

244
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:17,994
but I get it,

245
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,541
you know,

246
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:23,160
I mean these guys got to go where the
money is and at Pella tour he easily could

247
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:23,791
be a champion.

248
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,010
I think he could be a
champion in the UFC as well.

249
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,950
And maybe we will see
him in the UFC again.

250
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:29,161
I mean,

251
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:33,420
he could easily find a year or two over
in the UFC and then come back over.

252
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,130
K guard is still relatively young,

253
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,980
but it's nice to have competition.

254
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:41,400
I think competition is good
for everybody and I think it,

255
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:42,060
uh,

256
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,740
I think it really elevates the sport.

257
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:45,210
It elevates the level of sport.

258
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:45,951
I end it,

259
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:50,951
you could see by the results that a
lot of these UFC fighters are having.

260
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:51,750
Um,

261
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,780
especially Lorens Larkin who is very good,

262
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:55,471
he's a very,

263
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:56,460
very good striker.

264
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,690
He loses to Lima in a bid for
the title and then loses by,

265
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:04,590
knock out to the always
dangerous pol daily.

266
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,410
So I think Bella tore it.

267
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:07,831
And now,

268
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:09,720
especially in that 170 pound division,

269
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:13,860
you've got Rory McDonald bell tours
really showing they have absolute world

270
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:14,970
championship caliber,

271
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,100
caliber talent over there.

272
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,740
So to get back to that fight,

273
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,580
uh,

274
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,150
I agree entirely with a,

275
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,630
to get back to the Bisbing and,

276
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:24,810
uh,

277
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,130
Calvin Gasol and fight,

278
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,640
I agree 100% with what
Brendan Schaub said,

279
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,570
that you really have to protect
a fighter from themselves.

280
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,340
You really can't be letting a guy fight
three weeks after an absolutely brutal

281
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:38,941
fight like that.

282
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:40,440
It just does not make sense.

283
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,940
It just does not make sense.

284
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,260
Um,

285
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,310
I don't think it's smart.

286
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:44,671
I mean,

287
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:48,990
I understand that UFC needed someone
to fill in and short notice because

288
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:53,910
Anderson Silva tested positive
for performance enhancing
drugs and they did not

289
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:55,440
want to lose the,

290
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:55,860
uh,

291
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,390
Shanghai main event.

292
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,920
So it turns into an even bigger fight
when you've got the former middleweight

293
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,630
champion right off of his last
three weeks later fighting again.

294
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:07,464
But

295
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,630
it's just not smart.

296
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,490
I know Bisping wanted to do it.

297
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:13,680
I know Bisping would probably
do it again if you asked to do,

298
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:13,930
if you,

299
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,080
if you ask Bisbing to fight in
a couple of weeks of probably,

300
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,130
probably do it again.

301
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:17,964
And,

302
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:18,631
and,

303
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:19,464
um,

304
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,220
someone was talking about
him fighting in England,

305
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,300
I believe in March,

306
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,134
which

307
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,150
boy,

308
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,511
I mean,

309
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:28,620
that's less crazy,

310
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,790
but still crazy,

311
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,300
right?

312
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,631
Because,

313
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:30,960
uh,

314
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,940
we're basically an into December.

315
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:35,520
So you got December,

316
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:35,520
January,

317
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,000
February,

318
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,380
three months off really,

319
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,491
and then march.

320
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:42,880
But of course during that time he's
going to be sparring and you know,

321
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,231
you know,

322
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,741
Bisping,

323
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:44,730
he's a fucking animal.

324
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,440
He's not going to train easy.

325
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:47,880
He's not gonna take much time off.

326
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,931
And,

327
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:49,740
uh,

328
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,010
there's a lot of debate as to how much
time a fighter should be forced to take

329
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:57,340
off after they get knocked out.

330
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,660
And here's the thing about that.

331
00:11:59,580 --> 00:11:59,830
You're,

332
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,090
you're seeing guys

333
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,020
when they're fighting and you're seeing
them getting knocked down and you're

334
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:06,040
seeing them fighting,

335
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:06,881
you know,

336
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:08,200
x amount of months later.

337
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,490
So you saw Bisping,

338
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:11,230
he didn't get knocked out
by George Saint Pierre,

339
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,300
but he's certainly got
rocked with that left hook.

340
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,110
And then,

341
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,320
uh,

342
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,640
he got choked out when
he was on the ground.

343
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,483
I now,

344
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,450
for people who don't know a lot about MMA,

345
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,460
getting choked out is not nearly
as bad as getting knocked out.

346
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:24,760
It's,

347
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,960
there's almost nothing to it.

348
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,580
The way to look at it is if you look at
a garden hose and you know how to give

349
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:31,450
Ben the garden hose,

350
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,930
crimp it down and it stops
the water from coming out.

351
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,820
That's exactly what happens to your
fucking brain when you get choked out.

352
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:40,930
When you get choked out,

353
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:42,280
it's basically cutting off the blood.

354
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:42,761
Your brain,

355
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,170
you wake up and you're fine.

356
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,690
You don't have memory issues,

357
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,760
you don't have balance
issues for the most part,

358
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:50,830
especially if you've only been
out for a couple of seconds.

359
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:51,640
Um,

360
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,850
it happens all of the time in training.

361
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,660
Uh,

362
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,770
I've seen many,

363
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:58,750
many guys get choked unconscious.

364
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,520
I've choked people unconscious.

365
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:01,870
They come back and they're fine.

366
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,030
It's not that big of a deal,

367
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,780
but you got to realize before
he got choked unconscious,

368
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:10,180
he got hit with a big
fucking lefthand and hurt.

369
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,160
And it was a great fight before that.

370
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:12,790
Uh,

371
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,790
both guys were were giving and tanking
fighters need time off after fights.

372
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,540
So you're seeing that,

373
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:19,781
right?

374
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:23,890
You're seeing the actual competition
between George Saint Pierre,

375
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:24,491
Michael Bisping.

376
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:27,820
What were you not seeing is how many
times he got hit during training?

377
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,320
Did he get rocked ever?

378
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,390
Did he get clipped and dropped a,

379
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:35,050
did he get dropped and heard and take a
couple of days off and then get back to

380
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:35,884
training again?

381
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,210
Only he knows.

382
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:40,240
Only his camp knows and most of
the times they're not talking.

383
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,920
But you hear about it all the time.

384
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,911
And matter of fact,

385
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:44,710
I was talking to Forrest Griffin wants,

386
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,140
and Forrest was telling me that
before he fought Anderson Silva,

387
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,590
he was knocked unconscious
twice in training.

388
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,360
That's fucking crazy.

389
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,590
I mean,

390
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,700
here he is

391
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,820
about to fight the greatest pound
for pound fighter of all time.

392
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:04,900
Next to,

393
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,500
I mean if there's,

394
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:05,740
there's,

395
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,630
there's three guys in that debate,

396
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:08,464
right?

397
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,980
My,

398
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,500
my number one guy right
now is mighty mouse.

399
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,700
I think just he,

400
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,560
he represents the highest skill level.

401
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,000
But does he represent the
highest competition level
in terms of like the guys

402
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:19,834
he's faced?

403
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,400
I don't think so.

404
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,490
I think number one competition
level is Jon Jones.

405
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,930
Jon Jones has choked out
Liotta Machida rampage Jackson.

406
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,880
He's beat Rashad Evans.

407
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,730
He beat Alexander Gustafson,

408
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,150
he'd beat Glover to sharer.

409
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,640
He beat Vitor Belfort.

410
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,760
He beat Daniel Cormier twice.

411
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,930
I mean fuck,

412
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,760
he's beating everybody.

413
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,830
I think you look at competition wise,

414
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,240
Jon Jones is a very strong argument
for the greatest of all time,

415
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,700
but Anderson Silva's
fucking bright there too,

416
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:53,001
man.

417
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:54,680
Anderson Silva in his prime.

418
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,750
I think when you look at
the way he knocked out,

419
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:58,970
Vitor Belfort with that
front kick to the face,

420
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,030
when you look at the way he fought,

421
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:03,900
Forrest Griffin in,

422
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,480
in that fight that we
were just talking about,

423
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:10,070
and k owed him like a magician the way
he fought Stephan Bonner and literally

424
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:11,510
put his back up against the cage.

425
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,343
They again,

426
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,660
Stephan Bonner and
Forrest Griffin to just,

427
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,940
no disrespect,

428
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:22,270
they're not at the same level as a Leo
Machida or Glover to sharer or some of

429
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:25,940
the guys that Jon Jones has faced,

430
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,460
but it's the way Anderson beat them.

431
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,180
I mean,

432
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,920
Anderson was just in his prime.

433
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:32,630
He was off fucking master,

434
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,950
like a real master.

435
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,893
Uh,

436
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,180
so Forrest Griffin fighting Anderson
Silva after being Kao twice in training

437
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:43,400
camp is just insane.

438
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,900
But these are the things that
fighters do when they have to do them.

439
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:48,231
You know,

440
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:50,150
you're talking about a giant pay day,

441
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,590
you're talking about a big fight.

442
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,880
You give the guy a chance like,

443
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:53,630
do you want to fight?

444
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,441
Do you think you could fight?

445
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:54,711
Yeah,

446
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:54,880
I,

447
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,221
I,

448
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:55,431
yeah,

449
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:55,911
I could do it.

450
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:56,744
I could do it.

451
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,020
And they go out there and
they're compromised and
they get clipped and you see

452
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:00,591
it immediately.

453
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:01,424
Sometimes.

454
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,080
Sometimes you see guys,

455
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,810
they get clipped and you
don't know what I mean.

456
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,890
They get hit with something
and look at any day,

457
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,550
any time when a person is throwing a
punch or kick at you and it connects,

458
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,780
it can put you out.

459
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,450
But there's no doubt at all,

460
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,560
no doubt about it,

461
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,980
that the resiliency of a fighter
after they'd been KOD is compromised.

462
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,720
There's just no doubt about it.

463
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,130
When you see a guy who's been KOD
and then you see them get hit weeks,

464
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:31,970
months later,

465
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,070
they cannot take a shot at the same way.

466
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,050
Their brain is still recovering,

467
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:38,480
their body is still recovering
from the concussion.

468
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,733
And uh,

469
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,080
you have to figure out a way to balance
being a risk taker and seizing an

470
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,261
opportunity,

471
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:53,261
which is a huge opportunity versus
concentrating on having a long and healthy

472
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:55,154
career.

473
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,080
Now that said,

474
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,190
for Michael Bisping,

475
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,820
he's kind of at the end of his career.

476
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,180
I mean,

477
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,700
he said essentially that he wants
to fight one more time in England,

478
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,820
which would be beautiful for
him and I hope they give him,

479
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,300
uh,

480
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,601
you know,

481
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:09,680
a good matchup.

482
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,600
So it'd be a good fight for the fans.

483
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,730
And I hope they give
Michael some time off.

484
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,750
You know,

485
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,550
give the man some time to really relax
and then go through a real nice three,

486
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:20,780
four month training camp,

487
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:23,750
get an excellent shape and give
his best effort for one more.

488
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,320
Go at it.

489
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,340
I would like to see that,

490
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,850
but it might be the hardest shit in the
world to talk a fighter into retiring or

491
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:35,450
to for a fighter to
figure out when to retire.

492
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,060
I was just talking to Matt Brown.

493
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,750
Um,

494
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,690
he came to see me in Denver
and I was telling him,

495
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:41,991
I was like,

496
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:42,321
dude,

497
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:44,390
that fight that you
have with Diego Sanchez,

498
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:45,740
what a perfect way to go out.

499
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,731
Beautiful,

500
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:48,090
spectacular knockouts,

501
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,340
Classic Matt Brown fight.

502
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,510
Just blood and guts.

503
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:56,010
He's one of my all time favorite fighters
to watch for sure because he's so

504
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:57,810
fucking for Roche's.

505
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,200
You knew when you were going to
go to see a matte brown fight.

506
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,280
If Matt Brown was fighting,

507
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,061
anybody win,

508
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:03,960
lose or draw,

509
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,620
that guy was going to have to face hell.

510
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,990
Matt Brown would bring it in.

511
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,020
The four Rosti intensity that that guy
would bring inside the octagon is just

512
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:16,614
unrivaled.

513
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,780
And I think about Matt is,

514
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:19,170
he's,

515
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,670
he's not like an unbelievably
physically gifted guy.

516
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:25,610
He's not like some Kevin
Randleman character.

517
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,040
You know,

518
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,500
there's been guys that
are just physical freaks.

519
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:28,801
You know,

520
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:30,180
Anthony Rumble Johnson,

521
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,270
there's a,

522
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,520
you know Brock Lesnar,

523
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:32,790
there's,

524
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,650
there's guys that are just physically,

525
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:35,850
they're just freakish.

526
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,340
They can do things that are
just incredibly unusual.

527
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,730
And then there's guys that
their mind is just unbreakable.

528
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:48,831
They're just off fucking warrior
to the core down to the cells.

529
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,100
That's Matt Brown and Matt Brown can lose.

530
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:54,270
He's lost before,

531
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,590
but he just loses because
his body gives out.

532
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,870
It's never because his mind gives out.

533
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,130
I mean that guy is coming to fucking
kill you every time he gets into that

534
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:05,964
octagon.

535
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,440
And I loved that about him.

536
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,080
I mean it's one of my all time
favorite fighters to watch for sure.

537
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,520
And when I was telling
him a congratulations,

538
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,860
I mean it's an amazing
way to cap off a career.

539
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,520
He's like,

540
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,570
might not be the last one.

541
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:19,290
So he's still,

542
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:19,950
you know,

543
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,680
even after going through all those wars,

544
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,191
you know,

545
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:24,420
he's in his thirties now,

546
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:29,421
I believe he's like 35 I think
he is maybe 36 and you know,

547
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,810
still wondering.

548
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,640
I think he's 36 it's still wondering like
is this it to go one more do one more,

549
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,833
one more.

550
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,870
Cause the thrill that you experience.

551
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,810
I mean obviously I've never fought
inside the octagon so I'm just guessing.

552
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:45,390
But the thrill of just
fighting in general,

553
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:50,420
it's such a much higher level of
danger and excitement than most people

554
00:19:52,711 --> 00:19:57,711
experience in everyday life and it's
incredibly addictive and it makes regular

555
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:02,190
life seem dull and gray in comparison.

556
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,170
When those guys get into the octagon,

557
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:08,670
when a guy like Matt Brown smashes an
elbow down on Diego Sanchez and Diego

558
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:11,640
slumps and goes limp and
the crowd goes insane.

559
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,930
And you know when just when
Matt got into the octagon,

560
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,120
there's a crazy video of the fight
while we're watching the fight,

561
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,390
Matt steps into the octagon steps
through the cage and fucking roars.

562
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,770
I mean raw bars,

563
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,750
like you see it in his face,

564
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,010
you see it in his eyes.

565
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:36,810
He just opens his mouth and screams
that mother fucker was there to fight.

566
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,980
That's what he loves to do.

567
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,470
And it was finally there.

568
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:41,460
It was finally happening.

569
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,890
It gets to the training camp
steps into that octagon.

570
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:44,640
It's go time.

571
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,290
That is is exciting as life
is going to be for him or for,

572
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,640
for any combat sports athlete.

573
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,890
And it is incredibly,

574
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:55,840
incredibly hard to give that up.

575
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,570
Once you've experienced that man,

576
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,170
I mean,

577
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,250
you see it in these guys.

578
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:03,430
It's so hard for them to
know when to walk away,

579
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,330
but I think it's incredibly critical to
balance out the glory of Combat Sports,

580
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:15,691
the glory of giving your all and
going out on your shield sometimes and

581
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:20,170
sometimes winning with vicious
knockout or incredible submission,

582
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,440
but knowing when the
body has taken enough,

583
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:28,210
knowing when your vehicle is damaged
to the point where you should not be

584
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:30,010
engaging in competition anymore.

585
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,030
And it's different for everybody
and it's so hard to figure out when,

586
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,500
and some guys just know,

587
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,970
some guys just know and they'll go,

588
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:37,451
you know what?

589
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:38,050
I'm good.

590
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,883
It's it,

591
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:39,551
uh,

592
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:40,480
I don't feel it anymore.

593
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,440
I'm going to step away.

594
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,023
Um,

595
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,730
Tj grants a good example of that.

596
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,130
Here's a guy that was supposed
to be fighting for the title.

597
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,240
He's about to fight for the
UFC lightweight title and
nobody ever heard from him

598
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:52,541
again.

599
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,460
He was suffering from concussion syndrome.

600
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,690
He just had real hard time recovering
from a concussion that he gotten training

601
00:21:59,290 --> 00:21:59,980
and uh,

602
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,970
never fought again.

603
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,570
Took a regular job,

604
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,640
but he's done some training,

605
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:04,870
training fighters and stuff,

606
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:08,260
but never decided to get
back into the octagon again.

607
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,340
Chris Holdsworth and other
example got a training injury,

608
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,670
get hit in the head and training real bad,

609
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,190
got a concussion and um,

610
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,630
decided to stop.

611
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,613
And that was it.

612
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,090
Very hard for these
guys to figure out when.

613
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,381
So,

614
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:27,214
um,

615
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,270
next Saturday,

616
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,890
December 2nd,

617
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,570
there's a big fight.

618
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,940
It's the rematch between
Max Holloway and Josie Aldo.

619
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,900
You also have Alistair Overeem
and Francis in Ghana on that card.

620
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:41,763
Whoa.

621
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,790
Henry said Udo and Sergio Pettis,

622
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,640
Eddie Alvarez,

623
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,830
and just engaging who?

624
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:53,170
Just those four fights,

625
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,740
right?

626
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,350
Their whole Lee Shit.

627
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,970
Holy Shit.

628
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,351
I know a,

629
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:02,440
I talked about Holloway
versus all though before.

630
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,161
Um,

631
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:06,160
what I like about this
fight is first of all,

632
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:07,750
the first fight was very good until,

633
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,350
although,

634
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,183
um,

635
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,170
ran out of gas and Holloway took over.

636
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,250
Um,

637
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,940
all those camp was saying that going
into that fight all though had a leg

638
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:16,774
injury,

639
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,390
which kind of makes sense because you
really didn't throw many leg kicks,

640
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:22,720
but he also didn't throw very many
leg kicks against Frankie Edgar.

641
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,920
I think the strategy for then for that
fight though was that he was worried

642
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:28,450
about the takedowns of Frankie Edgar.

643
00:23:28,451 --> 00:23:30,970
So he had decided to
avoid being taken down.

644
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,140
One of the best ways to do it would be
just to avoid kicking and just outbox

645
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:35,321
him.

646
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:39,310
And he did that very well in that
fight and won a pretty clear unanimous

647
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:40,144
decision.

648
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,550
This is going to be a different fighter.

649
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:45,100
I mean Max Holloway is in his prime.

650
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,100
He beat,

651
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,770
although the first time around isn't he?

652
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,650
And he's incredibly confident there's
going to be able to beat all the second

653
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:52,230
time.

654
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,750
All go though said that he had this
leg injury and it prevented him from

655
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:58,970
throwing leg kicks but
that it's better now.

656
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,820
And that's one of the reasons why he's
excited about fighting Holloway again.

657
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,870
Now if that is the case and if
all though is in tremendous shape,

658
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:08,390
cause he took this fight
on relatively short notice,

659
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:10,640
he did not get a full two,

660
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:12,080
three month training camp.

661
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:14,450
I think it was five weeks out,

662
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,620
maybe more.

663
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,450
I'm sorry if I'm wrong about that.

664
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,410
I'm not looking at it right in front
of me but I know it wasn't a full camp

665
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:26,411
cause I know it was supposed to be
Frankie Edgar Edgar got injured and so all

666
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:27,644
those steps in,

667
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,670
so we're gonna find out,

668
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,480
we're going to find out if Aldo can make
the proper adjustments and whether or

669
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:36,290
not the ability to throw leg kicks is
going to make a difference because all

670
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:41,090
those leg kicks classically in history
have been some of the very best in the

671
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:41,420
game.

672
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,340
If you look at his fight with Uriah Faber,

673
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:45,770
it's one of the very best uses,

674
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:50,930
uses best use of leg kicks maybe
in the featherweight division ever.

675
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,080
And just smash Uriah Faber,

676
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:54,230
his leg to the point where,

677
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,520
I mean it's one of the all time grossest
and injuries and MMA you rise left leg

678
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:03,200
was like twice the size of his right leg
and had to do a bunch of crazy therapy

679
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,320
to recover from him hyperbaric chamber.

680
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:07,070
And you know,

681
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,120
he documented it.

682
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:08,954
Your eyes.

683
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,980
He's such a cool dude.

684
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,903
He's uh,

685
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,160
I loved that he did this.

686
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:12,680
He,

687
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,010
he documented a lot of the injury
online to show everybody like,

688
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:17,660
look how fucked up my leg is.

689
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,063
And uh,

690
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,840
that's all done at its best
is although the same guy now,

691
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:28,841
I mean he's gone through 29 professional
MMA fights at the highest level.

692
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:32,870
He's been a champion for
a long time and you know,

693
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:33,860
he's had some wars.

694
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,380
The second fight with
Chad Mendez was a war.

695
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:39,780
Of course he got stopped
quick by Conor Mcgregor.

696
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,680
The fight with Max Holloway was a war.

697
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:42,891
I mean,

698
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:43,910
he's been through some,

699
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,470
some really tough fights.

700
00:25:45,471 --> 00:25:47,720
Does he still have that same level?

701
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,583
You know,

702
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,460
we really don't know.

703
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,840
And we're going to find out,

704
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,840
hopefully we're going to
find out from a an inch.

705
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,141
I mean,

706
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:57,020
I don't know what kind of
camp he was involved in,

707
00:25:57,021 --> 00:26:01,550
like how hard he was training rather
before he entered into camp for this

708
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,170
championship fight.

709
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,740
I'm hoping that he was in good shape and
that's one of the reasons why he was so

710
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:07,820
eager to take the fight.

711
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,490
And we're gonna find out we're
going to fly out on Saturday night.

712
00:26:10,491 --> 00:26:11,390
And that's very interesting.

713
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:15,980
But maybe even more interesting is
Alistair Overeem and Francis in Ghana,

714
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,570
because Alistair are over.

715
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:20,720
Overeem was one of the most
experienced guys in the division.

716
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,260
Of course,

717
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,770
Overeem is the former
dream heavyweight champion,

718
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:29,771
former Strikeforce heavyweight champion
and former k one grand Prix champion.

719
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,320
One of the very best kick boxers to
ever fight in MMA without a doubt.

720
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,960
But you want to talk about a guy who has
been in wars like let's Google Allister

721
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,630
overall record because it's
gotta be fucking crazy.

722
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,320
As far as the number of
times he's been stopped.

723
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:52,800
I mean,

724
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,390
it's really fucking bananas.

725
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,920
Let's go and look.

726
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:58,000
We'll first look at his MMA career.

727
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,230
We'll count this up and this
is no disrespect to him.

728
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:05,280
I'm a huge Alistair Overeem fan and
I'm not saying that he should retire or

729
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:06,570
anything crazy like that,

730
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:11,870
but let's just take a look at
how many times he's been stopped.

731
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,650
Just an MMA.

732
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,221
Okay.

733
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:17,670
So he won two fights in a row,

734
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,610
a fantastic victory over Mark Hunt.

735
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,640
It Kod him with knees and one a split
decision over for breezy over doom.

736
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,270
Um,

737
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,710
or actually a majority decision.

738
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,070
One,

739
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,791
one of the referees,

740
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:32,100
I guess call or one of the
judges called it a draw.

741
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,490
I thought that was a very close decision,

742
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:37,680
but I thought that [inaudible]
was going to get the nod.

743
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:38,514
Quite honestly.

744
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,163
Let's look at the,

745
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,580
the times he's lost though.

746
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,370
Steep.

747
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:42,561
Amy.

748
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:42,781
Oh,

749
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:43,500
chip.

750
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,760
When he fought for the title,

751
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,600
knocked him out.

752
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,433
Okay.

753
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,340
Before that,

754
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,620
Ben Rothwell knocked him out before that
Travis Browne knocked him out before

755
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:55,710
that Antonio big foot
Silva knocked him out.

756
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:56,730
Brutal knockout.

757
00:27:56,731 --> 00:28:01,731
So that's just within the
last four years in the UFC.

758
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,460
He suffered for brutal knockouts
before that surrogate Keratan off,

759
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,361
knocked him out.

760
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,130
Brutal knockout in 2007,

761
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:11,964
10 years ago,

762
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,760
Mauricio Shogun Hua knocked them out.

763
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:16,260
Also in 2007,

764
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,220
uh,

765
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,930
he lost to Ricardo Arona.

766
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,300
He got stopped in that fight.

767
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,850
He tapped two strikes,

768
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,250
a Ho Geria Nogueira uh,

769
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,041
stopped him.

770
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,330
Little Nog stopped him.

771
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:31,561
Uh,

772
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:32,880
his corner stopped it by,

773
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:33,870
it's a Tko.

774
00:28:33,871 --> 00:28:35,280
That was in 2006.

775
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,770
He got stopped by Fabrizio over doom,

776
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:39,870
but that was a Komora and
that was a submission.

777
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,213
Um,

778
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,230
Shogun who,

779
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:44,010
uh,

780
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,000
stopped him,

781
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,223
uh,

782
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,260
the first time in 2005 so
shogun knocked him out twice.

783
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,750
He TKO them in 2005 and Kayo them in
2007 before that little Nog beat him by

784
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:06,051
decision chocolate dealt k owed him
and a fantastic fight where overin was

785
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,490
really coming on strong against chuck.

786
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,481
And then,

787
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:09,750
uh,

788
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,320
chuck caught him with some
brutal punches and killed him.

789
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,800
That was in 2003 before that,

790
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:18,120
Bobby Hoffman,

791
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,010
a lot of people forgot about
Bobby Hoffman way back and rings.

792
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,110
Um,

793
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:29,110
Kay owed him in 2000
and that's it for MMA.

794
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,650
So just MMA chaos,

795
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,190
right?

796
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,900
The first Kale loss.

797
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,960
We have Bobby Hoffman
than we have chocolate,

798
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:40,794
Dell.

799
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,330
Then we have shogun,

800
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,650
then we have a little Nog,

801
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,320
then we have a Rona,

802
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,450
then we have shogun again.

803
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,820
Then we have Keratan off.

804
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,391
Okay.

805
00:29:55,391 --> 00:29:57,730
We already have seven that's Keratan off.

806
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,660
Then we have big foot Silva,

807
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,220
eight Travis Browne,

808
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:05,260
nine Ben Rothwell,

809
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,330
10 steep Emile Chick,

810
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:12,070
1111 stoppage losses in MMA.

811
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:12,401
I mean,

812
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:14,680
holy fucking shit.

813
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,970
That's crazy.

814
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,930
11 knockout or stoppage losses in MMA.

815
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,960
Then you'd go to kickboxing.

816
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,041
Badr.

817
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:29,041
Hari stopped him in the k
one Grand Prix final in 2009.

818
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:31,330
He stopped him.

819
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,493
Um,

820
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:39,060
he got stopped by Glob a Tosa in,

821
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,203
um,

822
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,270
kill Kachin versus k one 2004,

823
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:44,190
he got Kod.

824
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:49,890
He got stopped by Bernard
Paris and k one Holland.

825
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,360
That's in 2001,

826
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,330
so one,

827
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,320
two,

828
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,680
three k o losses and kickboxing on
top of all the other MMA losses.

829
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:05,980
So that's a lot of fucking
stoppage losses folks.

830
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:11,610
And it's led people to question
the durability of the current guy.

831
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:19,050
But what we do know is that Allister is
extremely crafty and one of the things

832
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:25,111
that I like about Allister these days
as since he's gone over to Jackson

833
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,120
Winkeljohn in Albuquerque,

834
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,700
he has become much more elusive,

835
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,600
um,

836
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,610
much slicker on his feet,

837
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,930
moves around a lot more and
doesn't just try to smash people.

838
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,340
The Uber Ream,

839
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:44,080
the guy that we saw fight
Brock Lesnar when the,

840
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:46,750
in his UFC debut that
was like classic Uber,

841
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:51,780
which is Jack to the tits smash and people
running through people he would meet

842
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:53,500
force with greater force.

843
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,800
Now what you're seeing is we're seeing
as the ouster over him the fuck junior

844
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:00,850
dos Santos who farted,

845
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:02,260
incredibly clever fight,

846
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,490
moved around.

847
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:04,324
Well,

848
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,140
um,

849
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,640
he was very,

850
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:07,540
very slick,

851
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:12,070
very difficult to hit and then started
scoring on junior and then eventually

852
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:14,890
caught him with a beautiful
left hook and Kale at him.

853
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:20,550
That's that to me is the interesting
Andre Arlovski as tea today.

854
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,040
A guy who realizes that perhaps you can't
take a punch like you did when he was

855
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:26,710
younger.

856
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:26,950
You know,

857
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,180
he's been in a lot of really,

858
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:31,510
really tough fights as we
just went over and realized,

859
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:31,811
it's like,

860
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:32,021
hey,

861
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:33,040
now I have to be smart.

862
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,570
Now I have to be clever.

863
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,820
I have to move around a lot
and I have to use my skills.

864
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,620
And his skills are substantial.

865
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,621
In my opinion.

866
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:40,460
He's the best,

867
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:40,901
I mean,

868
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:43,250
right up there with mark on of course,

869
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,090
um,

870
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,990
who he just beat the best heavyweight
kickboxer every money it comes to

871
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:48,740
credentials.

872
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,341
He's the best.

873
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:51,410
Kevin heavyweight kickboxer ever in MMA.

874
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,060
Really a no,

875
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:56,290
no heavyweight kickboxer other
than him and hunt have everyone,

876
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,460
the k one Grand Prix and hunt one it,

877
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,950
he stepped into the
finals as an alternate.

878
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:02,450
He had lost earlier that night.

879
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,291
Uh,

880
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,300
not to take anything away
from hunt because of course,

881
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:10,130
Mark Honda is still just one of the all
time greats when it comes to kickboxing.

882
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,260
But when Mark Hunt One,

883
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,090
um,

884
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,290
he one,

885
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:17,180
we can go to that record right here,

886
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,650
Mark Hunt One,

887
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,240
um,

888
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,740
the k one grand Prix he wanted,

889
00:33:21,741 --> 00:33:23,630
he had lost that night.

890
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,360
Um,

891
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:25,940
see,

892
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,121
see,

893
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:26,421
he's,

894
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,430
he's fought the Caitlin
Grand Prix a couple of times.

895
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:30,630
He lost a semi shelt uh,

896
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,680
he got a Tki owed by a
spinning back kick and he won.

897
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,613
Um,

898
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,630
why don't I say God damn,

899
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,460
he's fought a lot of fucking
awesome kickboxing fights too.

900
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:46,930
So he lost to race CFO in
2001 and the semifinals.

901
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,570
And then he won that night.

902
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,550
He beat Stefan Leco.

903
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,550
Yeah.

904
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,560
So he lost to Ray Sefo.

905
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,590
Ray Sefo apparently couldn't continue
and then he came back to win from getting

906
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:06,410
that right.

907
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,130
Yeah.

908
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,070
It looks like he beat Stefan Leco

909
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:11,851
in the,

910
00:34:11,851 --> 00:34:12,390
uh,

911
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:15,930
75 watts has semifinals says winds,

912
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:18,660
k one Grand Prix championship 2001.

913
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:19,790
Oh,

914
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,430
okay.

915
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:23,400
He fought Francisco Filio but that was in,

916
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,110
I'm looking at a different date.

917
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:27,800
That was in,

918
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,550
uh,

919
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:33,050
2002 or 2001 he'd be feeling,

920
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,913
anyway,

921
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,450
I'm rambling.

922
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,140
Did you notice?

923
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,973
Yeah,

924
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:37,880
I'm talking too much.

925
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,390
Um,

926
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:38,960
but,

927
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,520
so he's fighting Frances,

928
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:45,020
Frances and Ghana and Francis and Ghana
who is right now 10 and one of the UFC

929
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:45,760
10,

930
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,100
uh,

931
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,890
ten one with a zero draws.

932
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:51,590
So 10 wins and it's just
been smashing everybody.

933
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,010
And if he looked at his last
fight against Andre Arlovski,

934
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,260
that was a fight where it's like
probably one of the first fights where we

935
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,130
really got tested.

936
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,780
We really got to see what happens
when he fights a former champion,

937
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:07,640
a former really world class fighter and a,

938
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,750
it was a good test,

939
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,800
but now a bigger test is in front
of them when he's going to fight.

940
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:13,790
Alistair Overeem,

941
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,610
I mean we've seen him so far,

942
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,190
four times inside the octagon.

943
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,360
Uh,

944
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,600
he stopped Curtis blades by knockout.

945
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,460
He stopped bull hon.

946
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,410
I don't know how to say
this guy's name again.

947
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,220
Me.

948
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,850
I owe Vich me how you've,

949
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,590
I don't remember how to get bullion.

950
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,640
Mihailo Vich I do remember
how to say homeboy's name.

951
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,953
Um,

952
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,180
then he stopped Anthony Hamilton,

953
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:42,900
uh,

954
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,050
by submission showing that he
has submission skills as well.

955
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,340
And then of course just knocked out
Andre Arlovski in his last fight.

956
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,930
It's a very interesting fight because the,

957
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,300
the question is,

958
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,900
is in Ghana ready for a guy who's
got the skills of Alistair over him?

959
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:00,804
The skill,

960
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,910
the experience at the highest level,

961
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,020
the craftiness,

962
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,140
is he going to set traps and is Frances
and gone going to be fall for those

963
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:10,710
traps?

964
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,880
The other question is,

965
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:17,300
can all can Alster Overeem take a shot
from in Ghana and Ghana has legitimate

966
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,450
absolute one punch knockout power,

967
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,630
extreme confidence and he's fresh and
in his prime right now actually entering

968
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:28,674
his prime,

969
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:33,420
I mean arguably he hasn't even reached
its prime yet because in Ghana was one of

970
00:36:33,421 --> 00:36:38,130
those guys that had 31 years of
age is near his physical prime,

971
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,300
but it's still learning.

972
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:44,190
He's still getting better at the sport
and as he fights better and better

973
00:36:44,191 --> 00:36:45,090
competition,

974
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,820
you're going to see more of a skill shine.

975
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:52,170
You're going to see where the holes are
in his game and you're going to see how

976
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,610
he responds to adversity.

977
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,820
Hopefully we're going to get a chance
to see all those things in his fight.

978
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:57,660
Um,

979
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,980
if Overeem wins,

980
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:01,890
there's a very good argument for
him being next in line to fights.

981
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:02,760
Deep Abo chip.

982
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,730
The real question about
the heavyweight division,

983
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,260
the real question other than,

984
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,153
um,

985
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:08,761
you know,

986
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:10,200
who's next for Steve Bay?

987
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,380
The real question is the
health of Cain Velasquez.

988
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,460
Cain Velasquez,

989
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:15,181
in my opinion,

990
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:18,390
is without a doubt one of the
greatest heavyweights of all time.

991
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,733
Um,

992
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,130
he's just a force of
nature when he's in shape.

993
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:23,850
When you,

994
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,640
when you see the Cain Velasquez
that beat Ben Rothwell,

995
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:30,930
when you see that Cain Velasquez
that just stormed the division,

996
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:35,490
when you see him in the second and
third fight with junior dos Santos,

997
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,190
that Cain Velasquez is a fucking monster.

998
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,601
The question is,

999
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:40,980
after all the surgeries,

1000
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:41,910
back surgery,

1001
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:42,750
knee surgery,

1002
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:43,770
shoulder surgery,

1003
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,980
can he come back and be that guy again?

1004
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:47,963
Um,

1005
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,171
as a fan,

1006
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:50,610
I most certainly hope we can,

1007
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,260
but we're really not going to know.

1008
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,640
Um,

1009
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,520
another fight in the car that's
very interesting is Henry.

1010
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:59,010
So Hutto and Sergio Pettis.

1011
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:04,140
Sergio Pettis is the
younger brother of showtime,

1012
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:04,531
Pettis,

1013
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:05,281
Anthony Pettis,

1014
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:07,950
who was the former lightweight
champion and Henry.

1015
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:11,130
So Hutto of course is a
former Olympic gold medalist,

1016
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,710
the number two ranked
fly weight in the world.

1017
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,890
And Henry is coming off of an absolutely
spectacular Kao of Wilson Hayes.

1018
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,440
I was blown away by him in
that fight and that fight,

1019
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:27,900
he looked like some
sort of a karate master.

1020
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,973
I mean that was a,

1021
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,850
it was a very,

1022
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:30,990
very interesting fight.

1023
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,800
Before that he lost a Benevidez and
benefit is of course one of the most

1024
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,351
experienced,

1025
00:38:35,351 --> 00:38:38,170
one of the best guys in the
division and he lost it very,

1026
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:39,160
very close fight.

1027
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:43,300
A fight where I've talked to his coaches
afterwards and they were really pissed

1028
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:46,870
off by the decision they thought
so Hutto could have gotten the nod,

1029
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,900
but he rebounded and he rebounded
versus Wilson Hayes and looked like a

1030
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:54,520
completely different fighter.

1031
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,850
The thing that excites
me about this fight,

1032
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,781
it's two things.

1033
00:38:58,781 --> 00:38:59,380
One,

1034
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,510
the potential of Sergio Pettis.

1035
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,030
Sergio Pettis is a young kid.

1036
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,700
He's one of the youngest
guys in the division.

1037
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:11,590
He's the extremely talented younger
brother of another extremely talented

1038
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:12,340
fighter.

1039
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,100
So he's had martial arts in his life.

1040
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:15,880
You know,

1041
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,800
most of the time growing up,

1042
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:19,420
he's 24 years old now.

1043
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,380
He trains under the Great Duke Roufus
who in my opinion is one of the very best

1044
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:27,790
guys in the division in terms of
his ability to coach fighters.

1045
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:28,870
He's fucking fantastic.

1046
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:30,970
Doof not to division.

1047
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:31,210
I mean,

1048
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:31,900
I should say in,

1049
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,733
in,

1050
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,673
in the sport.

1051
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,180
Uh,

1052
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,250
Duke Roufus has just an
amazing striking coach.

1053
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,950
He's a former world Moy
Thai champion himself,

1054
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:44,130
outstanding kickboxer and
extremely knowledgeable
about both kickboxing and MMA

1055
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:49,960
and one of the best guys in the
world at training kickboxers for MMA.

1056
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:50,531
I mean,

1057
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:51,580
he's just fantastic.

1058
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,270
And what we've seen from young Sergio,

1059
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:56,920
we saw him get,

1060
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,370
um,

1061
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,570
submitted by Alex,

1062
00:39:58,571 --> 00:40:03,571
get Sarah's early on in
his career and Alex is,

1063
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:03,820
uh,

1064
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,100
just slicker and caught him on the ground.

1065
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,600
And uh,

1066
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,750
and then we saw him lose
again to Ryan Benoit.

1067
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,480
I think that these losses,

1068
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:14,770
especially for a young fighter,

1069
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:16,150
are absolutely critical.

1070
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,530
I think you find out what you're really
made of you and you see what you need to

1071
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:21,281
improve upon.

1072
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:24,130
And in fighting tough guys early on,

1073
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,170
like Alex Caceres,

1074
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,550
like Ryan Benoit,

1075
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:28,384
I mean,

1076
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,170
and we're talking about two
years ago he fought Benoit.

1077
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,210
He was 21 years old then,

1078
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,310
so or 22 years old,

1079
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:37,144
he's 24 now.

1080
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,800
So He's a really young kid,

1081
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,521
still learning,

1082
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:42,260
still growing on the job and uh,

1083
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,630
has looked fantastic.

1084
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,730
And his last few fights looked really
good against John Moraga and looked even

1085
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:51,760
better against Brandon
Marino in his last fight,

1086
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,950
which was a five round,

1087
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,660
unanimous decision victory.

1088
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,330
So this is my opinion,

1089
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,900
is going to be the toughest fight
of his career because Henry,

1090
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:06,901
so Hutto just has that Olympic
gold medal winner mindset,

1091
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:13,020
the mindset of a galaxy Hutto I mean this
guy is focused on being a champion 24

1092
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:15,160
hours a day.

1093
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:19,570
And if you look at the way he
fought against Wilson Hayes,

1094
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:20,670
I mean if,

1095
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:25,670
if that's indicative of the kind of
improvement that this guy can make and

1096
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,220
carrying Gibbons who,

1097
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:27,850
um,

1098
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:28,211
is,

1099
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:28,570
uh,

1100
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,210
another fucking phenomenal
Muay Thai coach,

1101
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:36,350
he told me that this kid is just a
sponge and just can learn so fast that a

1102
00:41:36,351 --> 00:41:37,250
ridiculous way.

1103
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:42,430
And I think you looking at
athletic prowess in Henry pseudo,

1104
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,410
but I think maybe perhaps
more important than that,

1105
00:41:45,411 --> 00:41:46,610
you're looking at his mind.

1106
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:51,790
His mind is just ultra sharp and focused
and determined and he's just got that

1107
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:54,860
championship mindset.

1108
00:41:54,861 --> 00:41:58,220
I mean that's why he is an Olympic
gold medalist and a wrestling.

1109
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,630
So he's got unparalleled
wrestling skill in the division.

1110
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,950
And then on top of that,

1111
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,540
if you look at the Wilson Hayes fight,

1112
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:08,540
you look at radical improvements
in his striking and movement.

1113
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,960
I mean he looked like a combination of
a Prime Leo Machida and Conor Mcgregor

1114
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,630
versus with his movement
against Wilson Hayes.

1115
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,540
I think a lot of guys are
realizing that karate style,

1116
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,570
if you have all those other bases covered,

1117
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,190
if you have great wrestling,

1118
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:26,330
if you have submissions,

1119
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,710
good takedown defense and good
boxing skills as well as moy,

1120
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:30,110
Tai,

1121
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:30,830
everything else,

1122
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,510
that karate stance,

1123
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,770
that sideways stance that we see employed
all the time by Wonderboy Thompson

1124
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,760
that we see.

1125
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,593
Um,

1126
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,853
um,

1127
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:40,541
we've seen a,

1128
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:41,720
a bunch of different fighters.

1129
00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:42,141
Of course,

1130
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:42,831
Leo Machida,

1131
00:42:42,831 --> 00:42:46,160
a bunch of different fighters use
that stance inside the octagon.

1132
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,653
Conor McGregor,

1133
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,570
it's a very difficult stance to deal with.

1134
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:50,961
It's a,

1135
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:53,180
if you're good at it and if
you're good at that movement,

1136
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,490
that in and out side to side movement,

1137
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:55,720
uh,

1138
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,330
Michael Venom page has a
very unusual take on that,

1139
00:42:59,360 --> 00:42:59,930
uh,

1140
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:00,880
fighting and Bella tore.

1141
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,210
He likes to fight like that too.

1142
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,420
And of course he's a former
point fighting champion.

1143
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,510
That style is fucking hard to deal with.

1144
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:12,290
It's really hard for guys to judge
and if you're dealing with a guy like,

1145
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:17,210
so Huda whose lightning fast on top of
that and starts moving like that with

1146
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,720
those worldclass wrestling
skills with excellent striking,

1147
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,380
um,

1148
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:21,621
you know,

1149
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:23,660
classic striking boxing and kickboxing,

1150
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,550
very difficult to deal with.

1151
00:43:25,551 --> 00:43:29,610
I'm very interested to
see what style he takes a,

1152
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:33,020
or how he approaches this
fight with Sergio Pettis.

1153
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,140
He's quite a bit older
than Sergio being 30.

1154
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,250
Um,

1155
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,690
that's a really interesting fight.

1156
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,640
I'm very curious.

1157
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:41,120
I,

1158
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,100
I just do not know how that
one's going to play out.

1159
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,530
One fight that I don't know how to,

1160
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,760
it's going to play out,

1161
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:51,940
but I'm fucking beyond pumped for it is
Eddie Alvarez and just engage you just

1162
00:43:53,571 --> 00:43:54,051
engage.

1163
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:56,820
He is a fucking savage

1164
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,440
and so's Eddie Alvarez.

1165
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:04,670
Eddie Alvarez is a beast and I think a
lot of people are looking past Alvarez.

1166
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:10,180
Alvarez had just come off of
that brutal knockout loss,

1167
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,283
uh,

1168
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:17,380
kind of a humiliating knockout
loss to Conor McGregor.

1169
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,760
And then after that he is involved in the,

1170
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:24,230
the no contest,

1171
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:25,070
uh,

1172
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,330
versus um,

1173
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:27,770
Dustin poor yet.

1174
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,480
I believe that was an eye poke.

1175
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:30,870
Um,

1176
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,070
that is,

1177
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,070
I'm trying to remember
how that fight went down,

1178
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:35,904
but I do not,

1179
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,860
I feel like someone got poked in the eye.

1180
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,510
Uh,

1181
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,310
either way it's a no contest.

1182
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:46,311
So that obviously doesn't move him up
the ladder any and he's got to regroup.

1183
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:50,230
Yeah,

1184
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,220
no contest.

1185
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:52,054
Here it is.

1186
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:54,873
Yeah.

1187
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,083
Yeah.

1188
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,200
This was a,

1189
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:00,621
okay,

1190
00:45:00,621 --> 00:45:01,760
now I remember what it was.

1191
00:45:01,761 --> 00:45:02,810
It wasn't an eye poke.

1192
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:08,050
It was a knee to a downed opponent and
it was a fucking phenomenal fight while

1193
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,560
it played out against Dustin Poirier.

1194
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:12,980
Yay.

1195
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,570
They were going back and forth.

1196
00:45:14,571 --> 00:45:14,781
Now,

1197
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:19,781
I remember the fight and poor ea had
Alverez in some deep trouble and Alvarez

1198
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,430
rebounded.

1199
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,120
And Alvarez I believe,

1200
00:45:26,121 --> 00:45:30,620
hit Dustin employee Aa with
a knee while he was down.

1201
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:33,323
Yeah,

1202
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,030
that's exactly what happened.

1203
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,780
And interesting.

1204
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:43,960
Yeah.

1205
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,590
See,

1206
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,490
this is what happened.

1207
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,031
Pour.

1208
00:45:46,031 --> 00:45:46,600
Yay.

1209
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,433
Um,

1210
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,700
Alvarez,

1211
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:52,110
you know,

1212
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,120
Herb Dean was Safat defending it,

1213
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:56,310
saying that Alvarez didn't
intentionally need pour.

1214
00:45:56,311 --> 00:45:56,730
Yay.

1215
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:57,361
And if I remember,

1216
00:45:57,361 --> 00:46:00,240
the fight is a crazy war.

1217
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:00,721
Uh,

1218
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:02,130
Alvarez had been rocked.

1219
00:46:02,131 --> 00:46:03,060
[inaudible] had been,

1220
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:06,410
Brock poet was bloodied and um,

1221
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,020
Alvarez hit him with
an unintentional knee,

1222
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,100
um,

1223
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,390
that could have resulted in a
disqualification when for poor.

1224
00:46:15,391 --> 00:46:16,224
Yay.

1225
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:18,960
And Paula was saying that
he looked at it as a win,

1226
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:19,861
which is,

1227
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:20,070
uh,

1228
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:20,903
interesting.

1229
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,393
Um,

1230
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,680
so anyway,

1231
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:29,520
pull a rebounded from
that fight obviously,

1232
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,120
and uh,

1233
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:35,120
stopped Anthony Pettis in his last fight
so that the division is just crazy in

1234
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:37,080
me.

1235
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,670
Unbelievably hot right now.

1236
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,630
Um,

1237
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,420
and everybody waiting to see what
the fuck happens with Conor McGregor

1238
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:42,961
rebounding.

1239
00:46:42,961 --> 00:46:46,410
But Eddie Alvarez with a no contest.

1240
00:46:46,411 --> 00:46:47,280
And before that,

1241
00:46:47,281 --> 00:46:51,030
the Kale lost econom McGregor
desperately needs a win.

1242
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:56,160
And he's coming in there against one
of the most fucking savage guys in the

1243
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:56,994
division.

1244
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:57,870
Just engaging,

1245
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:01,140
showed in that Michael Johnson fight what
he's made of and a lot of people were

1246
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:03,270
very excited to see
him inside the octagon.

1247
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,660
He had been fighting in the world
series of fighting and looking like an

1248
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:07,890
absolute monster,

1249
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:13,580
but against what a lot of people
thought was just not the same caliber of

1250
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:16,380
competition as the UFC offered.

1251
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,450
And so they wanted to see what would
happen if he fought a real world class

1252
00:47:21,451 --> 00:47:21,960
fighter.

1253
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,150
And what we saw in the
Michael Johnson fight,

1254
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:25,040
it's adjusting gauge.

1255
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:25,874
He who fights,

1256
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,240
uh,

1257
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,500
I don't want to say reckless,

1258
00:47:28,501 --> 00:47:32,590
but he puts himself in danger and it's
one of the things that makes him so

1259
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:33,010
exciting.

1260
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,780
He forces his will on people.

1261
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,160
He's a ferocious striker and a,

1262
00:47:38,161 --> 00:47:39,790
an excellent wrestlers as well,

1263
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:42,790
and just fucking puts it on fighters.

1264
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,860
He tests there will,

1265
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:47,530
he puts tremendous pressure on fighters.

1266
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:48,930
And the,

1267
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:53,920
the fight with Michael Johnson
was just a pleasure to watch,

1268
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:57,220
just so much fun and so fucking crazy.

1269
00:47:57,221 --> 00:47:59,320
There was so much chaos in that fight.

1270
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,540
And a lot of people were introduced
to just engage you from that fight.

1271
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:08,110
The hardcore fans had known him already
from the world series of fighting and

1272
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:10,030
had heard about him through the Internet.

1273
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:12,830
But the UFC fans and uh,

1274
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,890
the people that were watching that night,

1275
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:18,410
they really got a chance
to be treated too.

1276
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,680
Does the kind of chaotic fight that
is really going to bring like a of the

1277
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:29,200
casual fan when they see a
guy like just engaging fight.

1278
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:32,830
It's really gonna make
you a fan of this kid.

1279
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,600
Just his style is just,

1280
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,370
there's very few guys,

1281
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,240
I mean other than,

1282
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,180
I mean Matt Brown who
I talked about before,

1283
00:48:40,181 --> 00:48:44,560
but even Matt Brown is capable of
winning so many different ways.

1284
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:49,420
Whereas Gagey he's gonna probably
try to knock you out or get,

1285
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:49,721
I mean,

1286
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:52,450
he's even said himself that
he might get knocked out.

1287
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:54,130
You're probably going to
see me get knocked out.

1288
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:54,964
He said,

1289
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:55,271
uh,

1290
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:57,880
over the next few years
he's got that mindset,

1291
00:48:57,881 --> 00:49:00,250
this kill or be killed mindset.

1292
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,001
And,

1293
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:01,420
uh,

1294
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:05,800
it's just absolutely fascinating to
see this kid compete inside the octagon

1295
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:10,860
because he's so fucking crazy because
he's such a fucking animal inside the

1296
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:11,914
octagon.

1297
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,750
He just got this,

1298
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:14,584
uh,

1299
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:18,850
undeniable killer instinct
and indomitable spirit.

1300
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,420
And there's levels to this game.

1301
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:23,980
There's levels physically,

1302
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,020
and he's at a very high level physically,

1303
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,150
but there's also levels mentally.

1304
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:31,210
And that's what excites
me about Justice Gagey is,

1305
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:31,871
is the,

1306
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:33,010
the mental level.

1307
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:38,440
He just has zero quit in
him and he's 100% ferocious.

1308
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:43,570
So him fighting a fucking
animal like Eddie Alvarez,

1309
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,780
that's just a recipe for a good time.

1310
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,560
And we're going to get to see that and
we're going to get to see that next

1311
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,120
Saturday night live on paper view.

1312
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,100
Woo.

1313
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,930
So how long have you been doing
this here for nine minutes.

1314
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,580
Black and fucking talk a lot.

1315
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:01,414
Huh?

1316
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,471
So,

1317
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:02,920
uh,

1318
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,000
also on the undercard,

1319
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:04,931
here's another five.

1320
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:05,760
That's a big fight.

1321
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,460
Um,

1322
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,091
this is,

1323
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:07,924
uh,

1324
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,570
Charles all Avera verses Paul Felder.

1325
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,670
Paul Felder continues to impress.

1326
00:50:12,671 --> 00:50:13,360
I'll tell you what,

1327
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,370
Paul Felder's a fucking phenomenal,

1328
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,121
uh,

1329
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:17,380
commentary guy too.

1330
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:19,420
He did commentary guy,

1331
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:20,620
color commentator.

1332
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,800
He did a fantastic job doing commentary
for Dana White's Tuesday night fight

1333
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,510
show and as [inaudible]
Tuesday night contenders show.

1334
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,290
And uh,

1335
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,720
he's done some a UFC events now as well.

1336
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,400
And just excellent,

1337
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,990
great enthusiasm,

1338
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,040
very knowledgeable,

1339
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:37,910
great talker,

1340
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:38,421
smart,

1341
00:50:38,421 --> 00:50:39,350
articulate guy.

1342
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,310
And he's fighting Charles
all of Vera Saturday night.

1343
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:43,940
Now,

1344
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,650
Charles all Avera is a guy who has had
mixed success inside the octagon and his

1345
00:50:48,651 --> 00:50:49,250
best.

1346
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:54,250
He's been incredible and he shows a great
range of very technical striking and

1347
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,001
very,

1348
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:57,770
very solid Brazilian Jujitsu,

1349
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,460
but he's had some tough losses.

1350
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:01,631
The,

1351
00:51:01,631 --> 00:51:02,930
the Kale lost a cub.

1352
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:03,860
Swanson,

1353
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:04,890
um,

1354
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:07,170
is he burst onto the scene with a,

1355
00:51:07,171 --> 00:51:08,390
an amazing victory,

1356
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,273
um,

1357
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:13,371
way,

1358
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:14,390
way back in the day.

1359
00:51:14,391 --> 00:51:14,571
See,

1360
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,770
this is not even Efrain.

1361
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:19,220
Escudero was his second fight
inside of the octagon actually,

1362
00:51:19,221 --> 00:51:21,650
and he got him by
standing rear naked choke.

1363
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,790
That was a big fight because
Efrain Escudero had won
the ultimate fighter and it

1364
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,121
was just,

1365
00:51:26,121 --> 00:51:27,500
it was a big victory for him.

1366
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,130
And he went down,

1367
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,560
he lost to cowboy Serone.

1368
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:34,550
Um,

1369
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:38,370
he got a coyote and the first round he,

1370
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:38,570
uh,

1371
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:39,770
lost to Jim Miller.

1372
00:51:39,771 --> 00:51:40,970
He got submitted.

1373
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:43,160
And then the cub Swanson Kao,

1374
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:46,820
he got beat up by Frankie
Edgar in a very fun fight.

1375
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,670
Three Round New Anna
you unanimous decision.

1376
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:55,030
Then a Max Holloway put it on him
and stopped him in the first round.

1377
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,310
Then Anthony Pettis submitted him.

1378
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:01,010
So he's had some,

1379
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,570
some ups and downs.

1380
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,413
Ricardo Lamas,

1381
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:03,980
Kod,

1382
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:04,813
em,

1383
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:05,210
uh,

1384
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:05,690
excuse me.

1385
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,090
Ricardo Lamas finished in by
submission in the second round,

1386
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,770
so he beat,

1387
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:13,610
we'll Brooks by submission in the first
round of his last fight and got back on

1388
00:52:13,611 --> 00:52:14,001
track.

1389
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:16,790
Looked excellent in that
fight and fought that fight.

1390
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:17,830
You know,

1391
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:18,663
it was like,

1392
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,110
it was a real do or die
fight for him against,

1393
00:52:21,111 --> 00:52:23,870
we'll Brooks a guy who was
coming over from Bella tour,

1394
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:28,190
a guy who was very talented and a
Oliveira wound up submitting him.

1395
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,150
There was a big victory
for him and in my opinion,

1396
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,440
this is one of the most dangerous fights
for him right now at this stage of his

1397
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:36,771
career.

1398
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:39,200
Because Paul Felder is a fucking killer.

1399
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,550
He's an animal.

1400
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:41,391
He's very,

1401
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:42,830
very strong physically.

1402
00:52:42,831 --> 00:52:45,110
He's a big 155 pound doors.

1403
00:52:45,111 --> 00:52:45,321
All.

1404
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:48,050
Avera is a smaller 155 pounder.

1405
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,210
I guy was fought at one 45 before,

1406
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,640
but just really had a hard
time making that weight.

1407
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,103
Um,

1408
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:55,010
fell.

1409
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:58,850
Just going to have a power and strength
advantage and all Avera is going to have

1410
00:52:58,851 --> 00:53:00,860
to be crafty and in my opinion,

1411
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:03,260
his best way to win this fight is
to get this fight to the ground.

1412
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:06,080
And that's going to be a tall order,

1413
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,100
a very tall order.

1414
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:07,880
Um,

1415
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,210
Felder's just a very aggressive,

1416
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:16,211
very durable and extremely
aggressive guy and 155 pounds.

1417
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,650
Can I say aggressive one more time.

1418
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:19,580
Um,

1419
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,650
I really loved his fight against,

1420
00:53:21,651 --> 00:53:22,484
um,

1421
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:23,570
well he's got,

1422
00:53:23,571 --> 00:53:26,040
had some amazing fights
inside the octagon,

1423
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:28,110
but what would I liked?

1424
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,360
I liked his fights against,

1425
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:35,370
I like his fight against Barboza because
the Barboza fight showed him against

1426
00:53:35,371 --> 00:53:39,450
one of the very best strikers in the
division and he'd got out struck.

1427
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,010
He lost that fight,

1428
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:45,360
but he was in it every second of the fight
and he was trying to win up until the

1429
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:46,194
very end.

1430
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:47,363
Um,

1431
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,890
he's had some ups and
downs inside the octagon,

1432
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,960
but he's won two in a row,

1433
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:55,830
both by knock out both
in the first round and,

1434
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:56,664
um,

1435
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:01,820
the Barboza fight and the Ross Pearson
fight or to decision losses that he got a

1436
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,810
split decision against Ross Pearson.

1437
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:08,560
He beat Danny Castillo and a spectacular
spinning back fist knock out,

1438
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:09,450
um,

1439
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,490
Jason's saga before that.

1440
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,330
I mean,

1441
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:17,330
and the Barboza fight I think was just
a good example of like where this guy's

1442
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:24,090
hard is that fought against one of the
best and fastest strikers in the division

1443
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,200
and was in it to the end.

1444
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:29,640
It was a real learning experience for
him and that was a also fight of the

1445
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,300
night.

1446
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:35,010
So I think Felder at this stage of his
career is really coming into his own.

1447
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,600
I don't think he's in his prime yet.

1448
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,231
I think,

1449
00:54:37,231 --> 00:54:38,040
uh,

1450
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,480
at 33 years of age,

1451
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,250
we're starting to see
the very best of him.

1452
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:41,850
And he's,

1453
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,590
he's got an incredibly bright future,

1454
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,430
but also you gotta realize
that 33 years of age,

1455
00:54:46,431 --> 00:54:47,730
she kind of got to get after it.

1456
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:48,564
Right now.

1457
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:51,210
I mean this is the time for him and,

1458
00:54:51,211 --> 00:54:52,020
uh,

1459
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:57,020
for Olivera Oliver has got to capitalize
on that victory that he just had over.

1460
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,780
We'll Brooks and you know,

1461
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,290
he's a little bit younger at 28 and
still got massive potential and an

1462
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:08,070
incredible amount of experience
for a guy who's a 28 years old.

1463
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,380
So this fucking card is just stacked.

1464
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:12,690
This card is stack from top to bottom.

1465
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:13,741
I mean,

1466
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:18,741
you've got 'em cowboy Oliveira versus
Yancey Madeiros is on that fight and David

1467
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,210
Tamer is on that fight,

1468
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:24,660
the fight card as well
against drug car clothes.

1469
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,000
Now that's a fucking sleeper.

1470
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:29,520
That's the big sleep or fight their cause.

1471
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:33,720
David Tamer is a fucking vicious Stryker,

1472
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:34,801
I mean,

1473
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:39,801
real world class striker
and he's only 28 years old.

1474
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:44,880
And David Tamer really let everybody
know what the fuck is up when he fought

1475
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:45,780
Landover Nada.

1476
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,600
A lot of people had no idea who he was,

1477
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:49,030
uh,

1478
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:50,010
up until that fight,

1479
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:51,210
even though he had one,

1480
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,660
two fights in a row by Kao in the Octagon.

1481
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,280
Um,

1482
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:01,280
when you got to see that kid compete a
against a really talented striker like

1483
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:05,460
land Vanatta and just out strike
him every step of the way,

1484
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,380
you really got to see how good he is.

1485
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:08,371
And again,

1486
00:56:08,371 --> 00:56:09,450
at 28 years of age,

1487
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,100
I don't think we've seen
the best of him yet.

1488
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,310
I think he is a,

1489
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,490
he has just got a massive,

1490
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:18,290
massive amount of potential and that's
the fight that I think is the big sleep

1491
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,210
or fight on this car that
a lot of people are just,

1492
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:21,960
you know,

1493
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,010
not quite aware of it.

1494
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:28,170
And the guys fighting Dzhokhar close
eight to know with one draw and very

1495
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:31,090
fucking dangerous fighter as well.

1496
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:31,601
You know,

1497
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:34,510
he's coming from two victories in a row,

1498
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:35,403
uh,

1499
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,760
in the UFC and uh,

1500
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:38,890
this will be his,

1501
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,740
probably his most dangerous
fight against Tamer.

1502
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:44,200
Tamer is just a wild,

1503
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:49,201
fast dynamic striker with legit
worldclass kickboxing Muay Thai skills.

1504
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:51,723
Very,

1505
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,020
very fun card.

1506
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,700
So that's going to be next Saturday night.

1507
00:56:54,701 --> 00:56:55,061
Also.

1508
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:57,550
Teesha Torres is going to
be fighting the karate.

1509
00:56:57,551 --> 00:56:58,384
Heidi,

1510
00:56:58,450 --> 00:56:59,283
Heidi,

1511
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:01,900
karate hottie Michelle Waterson.

1512
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,090
That should be a fun fight as well.

1513
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:05,140
Teesha Torres,

1514
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:05,621
who's a,

1515
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:08,830
an outstanding striker
and Michelle Waterson who,

1516
00:57:08,831 --> 00:57:09,640
uh,

1517
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,600
employs a lot of that karate styles,

1518
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:14,170
whether we're talking about that
side where it's sideways stance,

1519
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,170
she's got good kickboxing skills as well.

1520
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:19,620
Good submission skills and uh,

1521
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,750
Teesha Torres is going to most likely
try to keep this fight on the feet.

1522
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:24,130
There should be a lot of fun.

1523
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:24,910
I mean,

1524
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:25,743
um,

1525
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:27,910
Michelle lost her last fight to rose,

1526
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:28,744
Nama Eunice,

1527
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:29,171
but,

1528
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:29,340
uh,

1529
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:33,010
she'd be Paige vanzant by
submission before that in a a very,

1530
00:57:33,011 --> 00:57:34,090
very impressive fight.

1531
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,253
Uh,

1532
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,220
Angela McGauna,

1533
00:57:36,221 --> 00:57:39,790
she'd beat her by submission
before that and Jessica Pinay,

1534
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,560
she beat her in Invicta,

1535
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:42,090
uh,

1536
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:44,020
by decision before that.

1537
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:44,650
Uh,

1538
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:45,640
and you know,

1539
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:46,510
she's a,

1540
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:51,040
she's got a lot of hype behind her one
because of she's got a unique style.

1541
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:53,410
She's fighting out of Jackson's,

1542
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:53,830
uh,

1543
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:54,880
in Albuquerque,

1544
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:55,601
New Mexico,

1545
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:58,180
and she's also a very
beautiful young lady.

1546
00:57:58,181 --> 00:57:59,440
And of course people like that.

1547
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:01,390
That's a very interesting fight.

1548
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:01,840
Um,

1549
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,673
the whole car,

1550
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,740
this is like a great
card from top to bottom.

1551
00:58:04,741 --> 00:58:05,710
It should be a lot of fun.

1552
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:06,461
But again,

1553
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:07,211
the sleep or fight,

1554
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:08,044
like I said,

1555
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,520
is David Tamer.

1556
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:10,540
And your car close.

1557
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,680
Keep an eye on tamer.

1558
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:13,270
That mother fucker is wild.

1559
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:13,800
Uh,

1560
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,180
all of air versus Felder
should be a lot of fun.

1561
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:18,490
Alvarez versus gauge,

1562
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,110
do not go to the bathroom,

1563
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,810
do not get popcorn while
that fight is going on.

1564
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:24,190
As long as it lasts,

1565
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:26,050
I fight will be chaos.

1566
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:26,830
Um,

1567
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:27,491
I think so.

1568
00:58:27,491 --> 00:58:31,570
Hutto versus pedis is going to be a very
interesting test to see where pedis is

1569
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:35,830
at this stage of his career and to see
if so Hutto can continue to show these

1570
00:58:35,831 --> 00:58:40,480
massive jumps and leaps of improvement
that he showed in his last fight against

1571
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:41,380
Wilson Hayes,

1572
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,930
the Overeem and Gyno fight.

1573
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:44,590
Fuck.

1574
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,220
Amen.

1575
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,510
That could be chaos.

1576
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:51,540
I am interested to see whether or not
Francis in Gando can catch Alistair

1577
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:57,120
Overeem or whether or not he finds
himself against a guy who's far too crafty

1578
00:58:57,311 --> 00:58:58,630
for him at this stage of his career.

1579
00:58:58,631 --> 00:58:58,841
I mean,

1580
00:58:58,841 --> 00:58:59,830
we really don't know.

1581
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,520
Um,

1582
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,910
he fought our Laskey in his last fight,

1583
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:05,620
but with all due respect,

1584
00:59:05,621 --> 00:59:10,060
I do not believe that [inaudible]
is in the same category as over him.

1585
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:13,000
I think Overeem represents
another level of danger.

1586
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:17,530
And on top of that over is a very good
ground game that a lot of people are

1587
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,750
forgetting about Overeem one,

1588
00:59:19,751 --> 00:59:23,780
the Abu Dhabi European trials
he submitted Vito Belfort.

1589
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,140
I mean,

1590
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,140
Overeem has legitimate
submission skills submitted,

1591
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:28,610
Mark Hunt over in,

1592
00:59:28,611 --> 00:59:29,480
can submit guys,

1593
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,940
he's got good wrestling skills as well.

1594
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:35,540
You've got to remember he took Stephan
struve to the ground with a beautiful

1595
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:37,790
take down that Teekay owed him
when he got him to the ground.

1596
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:38,540
Um,

1597
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:41,480
he may choose to try to take
Francis and Ghana to the ground.

1598
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:41,780
We might,

1599
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,740
we might see that.

1600
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,083
We don't know.

1601
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:44,720
Um,

1602
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,200
it's just,

1603
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,200
it's a very interesting fight to see
where in Ghana is at this stage of his

1604
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:53,201
career and the biggest test of his career
so far and a fight that Overeem was

1605
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:54,321
looking for.

1606
00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:59,321
Overeem believes that he has the
skills to put in Ghana in his place and

1607
00:59:59,811 --> 01:00:02,780
reestablish himself as the number one
contender in the heavyweight division.

1608
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,071
That makes,

1609
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:04,460
uh,

1610
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,990
that makes me very
happy to see that fight.

1611
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:06,740
I'm very pumped.

1612
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:10,490
And then of course for all the
marbles in the featherweight division,

1613
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,970
Max Holloway versus Josie motherfucking,

1614
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:15,200
although for the title,

1615
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:15,890
you know,

1616
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:17,190
with a guy like all know,

1617
01:00:17,191 --> 01:00:21,530
you got to remember you're talking
about a guy who was the best ever at

1618
01:00:21,531 --> 01:00:24,140
featherweight for a long fucking time.

1619
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,220
You're talking about a god that up until
that Conor McGregor fight had beaten

1620
01:00:28,221 --> 01:00:30,020
everybody that they put in front of him.

1621
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,790
He rebounded fantastic from that fight
with the Frankie Edgar fight and then got

1622
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:36,290
beat down by Mac Holloway.

1623
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:38,690
I want to see where he's at right now.

1624
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,670
I want to see whether or not he can
read browned and I want to see after 29

1625
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,610
professional MMA fights
at the highest level,

1626
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:48,350
at 31 years of age,

1627
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:52,220
does he still have what it takes to fight
it a world championship level and can

1628
01:00:52,221 --> 01:00:53,540
he come back better than ever.

1629
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:55,220
Now with Max Holloway,

1630
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:56,054
he is.

1631
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:57,500
He's a fucking killer.

1632
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:01,220
Max Holloway has everything
you want to see in a champion,

1633
01:01:01,221 --> 01:01:02,510
a championships mindset,

1634
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:06,740
and the way he wanted to go
down at 25 years of age too.

1635
01:01:06,741 --> 01:01:06,981
I mean,

1636
01:01:06,981 --> 01:01:08,810
just keeps getting better.

1637
01:01:08,811 --> 01:01:10,280
He's not even near his prime,

1638
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:16,030
the way he wanted to go down to
Brazil and beat Joe's I Aldo in Rio.

1639
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:18,020
And the way he said it,

1640
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,660
that he wanted to fight
him in his country,

1641
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:21,261
then that,

1642
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:22,610
and that's what kings do.

1643
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:26,090
They go to the other person's
kingdom and take their throne.

1644
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,740
And that's what he did.

1645
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,270
Very exciting fight.

1646
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,220
So I'm fucking pumped
for next Saturday night.

1647
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:32,190
Um,

1648
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:35,130
now to answer some of the
criticisms and questions,

1649
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,000
a lot of people have been saying,

1650
01:01:36,001 --> 01:01:36,570
hey man,

1651
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:38,010
you should probably do this with guests.

1652
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,950
I am absolutely going
to do this with guests.

1653
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:45,980
The only reason why I didn't do this
one with a guest is because of my pitch.

1654
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,350
I'm on vacation and I felt
like I owed everybody want,

1655
01:01:49,351 --> 01:01:51,210
cause this is how it was going to
do one of these things every week.

1656
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:52,140
But the next one I do,

1657
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:54,450
I will bring in a guest
and I'm going to bring in,

1658
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,340
I'm going to try and
bring in more fighters.

1659
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:57,481
Um,

1660
01:01:57,481 --> 01:02:02,481
I think this is the best way I
think to do a fight or podcasts,

1661
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:03,594
not just,

1662
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,440
I mean I'm definitely gonna do more like
where I just sit down and do a regular

1663
01:02:07,441 --> 01:02:10,380
podcast with them for the jre podcast.

1664
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,020
But when it comes to just
a straight MMA podcast,

1665
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:15,780
I'm going to do quite a few of these,

1666
01:02:15,781 --> 01:02:19,530
bring guys and bring some guys in
that are interesting that don't think,

1667
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:20,364
uh,

1668
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,130
maybe uh,

1669
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:21,963
um,

1670
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:25,220
maybe some of you folks who've
never heard talk before so that,

1671
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,010
that'd be cool.

1672
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:26,770
Um,

1673
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:30,500
I'm also going to ask questions or a,

1674
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:31,740
have you guys ask questions?

1675
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,180
So what I'm going to do is,

1676
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:33,720
um,

1677
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:38,720
for the next one I'm going to put a post
up on Instagram and allow you guys and

1678
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:42,540
Gals and non-binary folks to put,

1679
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:43,320
um,

1680
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,900
how long do we have to
say that for non binary,

1681
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,960
how many of you are out
there that are non-binary?

1682
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:50,580
Is it really important to address you?

1683
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:51,601
Do you feel left out?

1684
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,910
If I don't humans,

1685
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:59,060
I'm going to allow all of you
humans to ask questions and we'll,

1686
01:02:59,221 --> 01:02:59,580
uh,

1687
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:03,810
pick some good ones and throw those
out there as well in the podcast.

1688
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:06,150
So that's it for now.

1689
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:06,871
Uh,

1690
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:07,950
next week I got,

1691
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,120
I got some good guests.

1692
01:03:09,121 --> 01:03:11,430
This week I've got some
really fucking funny people.

1693
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,860
I have CT Fletcher who's a,

1694
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:14,880
I'm sure he's funny,

1695
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:16,500
but he's also a power lifting legend.

1696
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:17,970
He's going to be here.

1697
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,590
Um,

1698
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:20,431
Owen Smith,

1699
01:03:20,431 --> 01:03:23,100
the guy that I've been telling you
folks about who's in my opinion,

1700
01:03:23,101 --> 01:03:26,610
one of the funniest motherfuckers on the
planet earth and a guy who people are

1701
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:27,570
sleeping on.

1702
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:30,480
People just don't know
how good Owen Smith is.

1703
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:31,770
He'll be here.

1704
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:32,910
Um,

1705
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:35,160
Brian Keaulana will be here this week.

1706
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,600
I got a lot of good guests this week,

1707
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,760
so that's it for now,

1708
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,773
friends.

1709
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:40,471
And,

1710
01:03:40,471 --> 01:03:41,304
um,

1711
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:46,370
thank you for tuning into episode
two of the J r e m m a show.

1712
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:47,371
And,

1713
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:47,600
uh,

1714
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,450
I'll talk to you guys soon.

1715
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:49,220
Okay.

1716
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:49,680
All right.

1717
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:49,861
Bye.

1718
01:03:49,861 --> 01:03:50,100
Bye.
