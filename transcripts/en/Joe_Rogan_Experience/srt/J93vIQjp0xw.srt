1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,590
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,250
It's funny because the things that I
thought used to be my weaknesses in this

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,140
new environment are actually
your biggest strengths.

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:10,560
Like I was kind of deeply insecure
back when I was a journalist.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,140
Now I'm a journalist again
cause the congressional thing,

6
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:16,260
I think that was a little delusional on
my part to think that you can jump in

7
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:18,240
there and hope to have any kind of chance,

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,290
uh,

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:19,591
to,

10
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:20,640
to be taken seriously.

11
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,360
But,

12
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,193
uh,

13
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,730
now that I'm back to doing journalism,

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,450
the things that I used to be really
insecure about that I wasn't working for a

15
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:29,070
TV network and didn't have,

16
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:29,251
you know,

17
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:31,440
New York Times or NBC News after my name.

18
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,960
Those are actually your biggest
strengths today because people go,

19
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,171
Oh,

20
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:34,440
if,

21
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,880
if this guy knows about something,

22
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,140
he's not going to hold back.

23
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,510
He's going to do the research
and put it out there.

24
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,510
And the other thing that I'm not afraid
to do that I think more journalists

25
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,344
should do,

26
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,120
it's put things into
perspective for people.

27
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:45,960
People are busy.

28
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:46,521
You know,

29
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:46,640
I,

30
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,790
I sat there reading for this
boring national security
stuff and then I'm able to

31
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,310
pick out what's important
and tell people this matters.

32
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,980
And then sometimes people will tweet me
something that seems like a really big

33
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:57,360
deal and I'll debunk it.

34
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:57,571
I'm like,

35
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:00,030
actually it's problematic but it
probably doesn't matter because of a,

36
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:03,840
B and c and people need that cause
there's no sense of perspective anymore.

37
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:07,170
You go to the home page of Yahoo
and it's something about Obama,

38
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,890
some huge meeting with Merkel and Germany.

39
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,390
And then the next line,

40
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,670
right next to it is Kim Kardashians baby.

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,670
And then the line below that is
the Duggar family or the Doug,

42
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:17,881
ours,

43
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:19,500
whatever they're called that have 19 kids.

44
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,970
The reality TV horse,

45
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,721
it's them.

46
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:23,310
And so it fucks with your
mind cause you're like,

47
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:25,410
are these things all equally important?

48
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,280
These,

49
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,280
this is what's most important in the
world today are these three stories.

50
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,790
And you need people who are
not compromised by the system,

51
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,950
who have a no paycheck coming directly
from a news organization to just say,

52
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:38,101
yeah,

53
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:38,940
this is really important.

54
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:39,870
People should pay attention to it.

55
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:40,830
Or this is bullshit.

56
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:42,990
It's just being hyped and
it's not that big a deal.

57
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:43,601
Well,

58
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:46,270
essentially there's always going
to be a need for junk food.

59
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:46,780
Yeah.

60
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,600
And there's gonna be a need for
intellectual junk food as well.

61
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,150
And much like actual food.

62
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,640
If you offer people
intellectual junk food,

63
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,730
there's a certain group of us,

64
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,510
and I lump me in there as well that
will self sabotage and they will,

65
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,540
they will eat junk food and they will
have a cheeseburger and then this should

66
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:11,980
really have a salad and they will watch
intellectual junk food when maybe it

67
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:15,370
would do them better to sit down and
read a book or to watch Nova or to,

68
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:16,180
you know,

69
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,500
see a documentary.

70
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,420
There's sometimes you don't
want to watch a documentary.

71
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,120
You want to watch a bunch of
assholes bid on storage space,

72
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:22,841
you know,

73
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:23,210
and it doesn't,

74
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,850
it doesn't make any fucking sense.

75
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,321
And that's,

76
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:26,021
that's good too.

77
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,570
Like there's no reason that you have
to do serious stuff all day long.

78
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,230
You're right.

79
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:29,531
I,

80
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:29,920
uh,

81
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,750
I certainly don't subscribe to that,

82
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,360
but you're a balanced person.

83
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,980
And if you're an inbound person,

84
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,810
much like people would
just eat cheeseburgers,

85
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,850
you're going to have
intellectual junk food,

86
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:39,271
24,

87
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:39,660
seven.

88
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,680
You're going to be comforted.

89
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,350
Your mind will be occupied by nonsense.

90
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,610
And that's what we really need.

91
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:48,450
Our minds are designed to be
occupied by the pursuit of food,

92
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,190
sustenance and sexuality.

93
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:51,270
That's what we're after.

94
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:55,500
We're trying to find a place to arrest
someone to fuck something to eat,

95
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,401
keep going,

96
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:56,881
ready,

97
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:57,990
go get up in the morning.

98
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:58,621
Are you awake?

99
00:02:58,621 --> 00:02:59,230
Okay,

100
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,870
fill the needs and now
those needs are filled.

101
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:05,470
Instead you're plugged into a fucking
video game and you're playing football

102
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:09,370
with some digital characters and you're
eating pizza that some guy actually

103
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,020
walked up to your fucking door and all
you need to do is give them some paper

104
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,190
that means almost nothing.

105
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,910
And he gives you pizza and you stuffing
your fat face and go right back to your

106
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:19,744
stupid game.

107
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,000
And it's so easy to do that.

108
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,110
It's so easy to do that.

109
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:27,730
As long as you can do enough to justify
enough ones and Zeros coming into your,

110
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,740
whatever your bank account is these days.

111
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:30,940
It's not the vault.

112
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,440
The vaults are filled with paper.

113
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,270
You know what's in that fucking fault?

114
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,440
It's vault filled with paper that's
promising something he promises inside.

115
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,030
Jason,

116
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,930
what kind of car do you drive it?

117
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:42,710
Dude,

118
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,710
I don't have a car and one
of those mother fuckers.

119
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,440
I'm in New York or New York.

120
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,921
You don't,

121
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:50,420
you don't drive cars.

122
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,220
I mean,

123
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,340
when I lived here I had a car.

124
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:54,020
I want to ask you about that Tesla.

125
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh my God.

126
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:57,670
Is that the coolest thing of all time?

127
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,070
Incredible.

128
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,881
And they're only gonna get better.

129
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:01,240
I think they were about to release like
the third or fourth generation now.

130
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,990
Martine Rothblatt had one
and when I interviewed her
and I got to meet her robot

131
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:06,980
Bina 48.

132
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,270
Yeah.

133
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,821
You ever seen that?

134
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:08,070
Her,

135
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,350
her spouse as a robot,

136
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,730
Martine Rothblatt.

137
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,890
Fascinating story was a man,

138
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:13,843
wasn't man,

139
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,151
uh,

140
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:15,770
founded Sirius satellite radio,

141
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:16,551
got a sex change,

142
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:17,390
became a woman,

143
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,920
and then created a robot
that is a direct copy,

144
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:23,360
a duplicate of her spouse,

145
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,210
and it could really be how good it looks.

146
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:26,721
Well,

147
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:27,620
there she's there too.

148
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,010
Oh,

149
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,310
okay.

150
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,881
She's there as well.

151
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:29,390
I mean,

152
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,290
she just loves her,

153
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,610
so she made a robot for,

154
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,780
that's so sweet.

155
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,021
Yeah.

156
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:33,561
It's interesting.

157
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:36,110
Liberace making that guy
changed his face to him.

158
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,183
Whoa.

159
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:37,961
You really do that.

160
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:38,300
Yeah.

161
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,133
You really do that.

162
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,250
They don't get plastic surgery.

163
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,600
Did you really do look more like Liberace?

164
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,620
That's hilarious.

165
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,940
He really is out in that the HBO thing.

166
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,390
Yeah.

167
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,690
I always wondered why Matt
Damon and Michael Douglas
were willing to do that and

168
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,740
if they have pictures of those,

169
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:50,141
too blown.

170
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:50,974
Yeah.

171
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,280
That's the only thing that makes sense.

172
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,860
Whether they agreed to do a live,

173
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,670
like if they came up to you when you were,

174
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,500
you were Matt Damon when they said,

175
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:57,621
hey,

176
00:04:57,621 --> 00:04:57,951
listen,

177
00:04:57,951 --> 00:04:58,460
man,

178
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,780
I know those Bourne identity movies,

179
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:00,670
they were really big and everything,

180
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:00,801
Blah,

181
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:00,941
blah,

182
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:01,061
blah,

183
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:01,181
blah,

184
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:01,370
blah.

185
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:01,940
Listen,

186
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,760
you're going to play Liberace's but buddy,

187
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,180
are you done made for TV made for TV?

188
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,580
Liberace,

189
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,810
his longtime lover,

190
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,011
but buddies,

191
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:13,671
very offensive.

192
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:13,950
By the way,

193
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,571
my gay friends,

194
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:15,410
and I apologize for that,

195
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,643
but pirate,

196
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,130
you guys are so immature.

197
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,330
I mean if you said that a
girl was your vagina pal,

198
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,310
does that be rude but giant of power?

199
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:25,570
No,

200
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,403
just be embarrassing.

201
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,403
Be Rude.

202
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,380
But isn't it interesting that a girl
can call a guy a dick and there's no

203
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:31,370
repercussions at all?

204
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,470
Their argument essay
and she can even say a,

205
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:35,304
I'm here to get,

206
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,010
get some good Jason Silva Dick.

207
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,810
And you wouldn't have
any problem with that.

208
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:39,201
You'd be like,

209
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:39,441
Yep,

210
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:40,760
I'm dishing it out honey.

211
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,500
But if a guy says,

212
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:42,771
oh,

213
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:44,300
I'm here to get some sweet Mary Pussy,

214
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:44,661
she'd be like,

215
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:45,494
what the fuck?

216
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,663
Cause really,

217
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,901
that's who I am.

218
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,190
I'm sweet Mary Pussy.

219
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,840
You don't think that's gross?

220
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,500
And you're like,

221
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,071
oh my God,

222
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:52,910
you're not really my friend.

223
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,980
Can't even joke around with you.

224
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,061
Jason,

225
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:57,170
what do you think's going to happen?

226
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,250
These checks Android's.

227
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,600
What do you see as the future?

228
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,250
Well,

229
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:00,930
I think,

230
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,610
I think the sex does sex technology
will probably be the pioneer.

231
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:05,930
I mean just like with porn,

232
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,531
the porn industry,

233
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,550
Pioneer Dvds.

234
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:08,600
When DVDs were first the thing,

235
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,010
who do you think was
doing the most advanced?

236
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:11,750
Like multi-angle interactive.

237
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,010
The experiences was the point of this,

238
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:13,190
right?

239
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,180
I mean we always had phones wasn't going
to go with that old style of video.

240
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,170
All the porters like,

241
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,410
cool,

242
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:18,950
we'll have to,

243
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,191
yeah,

244
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:19,800
exactly.

245
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,220
I never did the rest of them totally.

246
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:24,950
I mean we're always going to be
driven by sort of our sexual desires.

247
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,340
Kurzweil says we'll be able to tap into
each other's nervous systems and become

248
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:30,250
each other when we have sex with her.

249
00:06:30,251 --> 00:06:33,360
That's girl finding with
someone actually merging.

250
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:33,891
Well,

251
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:34,191
but no,

252
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:34,971
but some people say,

253
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:35,151
you know,

254
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:36,080
the Kama Sutra talks about,

255
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:38,750
we've been wanting to merge with
our lovers at the beginning of time.

256
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,590
I want to become one,

257
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:42,140
but it says in Him we can actually
scramble our nervous systems together.

258
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,850
Imagine allision man device or whatever.

259
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:45,141
I remember.

260
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:45,560
That's good.

261
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,060
That could be a real mind fuck though.

262
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:50,030
If you just find out that you
aren't like the worst in bed ever,

263
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:52,400
you feel what it's like
to be fucked by you?

264
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,353
Shit,

265
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,341
look at me.

266
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:56,560
I'm this og.

267
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,770
Why am I doing?

268
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,823
That's

269
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,443
even better.

270
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,790
Say it all like it takes

271
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,150
over.

272
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,301
Like,

273
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:12,590
why am I choking myself?

274
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,900
I won't you let me prove me.

275
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,640
Or even worse,

276
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:18,020
what if you get into her mind?

277
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,810
Like if you can access your girlfriend's
needs and desires and you got one now

278
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:23,170
what you want and you get into her mind.

279
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,730
It's just a river of black cock.

280
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,830
She's sleepy river of disembodied
black cops just shooting,

281
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,570
shooting sperm like a,

282
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,980
like a psychadelic dream.

283
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:36,890
You're brining a river
of dark black coffee,

284
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,881
black caucus,

285
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,750
slippery bro,

286
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,680
hip bull Cox to allow for a lot
of creativity in sort of our,

287
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:44,901
our,

288
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:49,901
our sexual consciousness to
a multiplicity of dimensions.

289
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:52,560
And we can't even imagine it's
the yellow and black psychedelics.

290
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:23,570
Oh,

291
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,403
it is already.

292
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,490
What the fuck's on?
