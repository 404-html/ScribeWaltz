1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,271
All right.

3
00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:06,440
We're live ladies and gentlemen
with a whole new set up a yeah.

4
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:06,681
Yeah.

5
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:08,030
When they listen ma'am,

6
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,130
I'm very irresponsible.

7
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,740
You're not going to be really cool is
when we get something right back here.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,433
That's the next step.

9
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,690
We're trying to figure out
what to put right back there.

10
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,780
Most likely is going to be a green screen
cause I'm looking at this right now.

11
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:23,330
I'm like how dope would it be if
we were in fucking space right now?

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:23,700
Yeah.

13
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,700
[inaudible]

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,600
so Adderall give you clarity.

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,640
That's hilarious.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,310
Cause my kids are trying to get me off it.

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,590
Why you're trying to get math.

18
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,240
My fucking kids like that.

19
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:45,500
I put through Rehab,

20
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,120
give me shit about my fucking
hair all tell me it's like no,

21
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,120
it's not like I've never
done math except for,

22
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,480
you know,

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,220
two times guys married to Tom Arnold.

24
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,960
But aside from that,

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,650
you know I've never,

26
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,600
I would never get into math.

27
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,780
It would be very strange if one day it
was proven that we are really living in

28
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:05,430
some sort of self created reality.

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,300
It would be like a really traumatizing
for a lot of people that have fucked it

30
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:09,830
up.

31
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:10,290
You'd be like,

32
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,123
this is what I made.

33
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:11,671
But it's like,

34
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,550
remember when you were in school and like
there was a project and you had to use

35
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,880
your hand and make a Turkey
and you put your hand down.

36
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,990
He drew around and then you know,

37
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:21,840
everybody did their own little Turkey
painted it and then the teacher would put

38
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:22,191
him up in the,

39
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:23,280
and I'll look at them and some people's,

40
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:24,780
Turkey's looked like dog shit.

41
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:25,441
I looked,

42
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:27,210
I didn't know what the
fuck a Turkey looked like.

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,340
They didn't even know how
to draw around their hand.

44
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:30,750
Like everything was a disaster.

45
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,710
And other people that beautiful darkies
well your life is a work of art.

46
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,020
Your,

47
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,250
your life is like a hand Turkey
that you make in grade school.

48
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,030
It's,

49
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,510
you could do whatever
you want with that thing.

50
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,700
You can make it super dope.

51
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,070
Yeah.

52
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,720
You know you can,

53
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,360
you can make it so it looks really cool
if you put the effort and time into it.

54
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:46,380
If you really focus on it.

55
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,390
John Travolta met a single handedly,

56
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:53,280
made more men gay just from this music
and from singing and dancing and getting

57
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,114
people to dance.

58
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,320
He probably personally,

59
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,780
it was probably his total overall goal,

60
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:59,920
which is to say nothing
of his bath house work.

61
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,940
Do you mask your farts when you
should shit in a public restroom?

62
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,430
No.

63
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:03,720
No.

64
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,290
Let it out.

65
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,340
You gotta do what you were going
to hold up to the left girl.

66
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,053
An idiot.

67
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:09,841
Jesus Christ.

68
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:10,830
You have it on your phone.

69
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,480
I love girl farts.

70
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:12,960
Yeah.

71
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,711
40 year old man.

72
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:14,580
He's got it on his phone.

73
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,700
Jesus Christ.

74
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,100
Oh yeah.

75
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,860
Anybody who says it doesn't
go in your asshole shut it.

76
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,060
He's clearly looking at
that and just being like,

77
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:24,331
yeah,

78
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:25,040
you fucking,

79
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,890
it's well,

80
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:27,840
you know it doesn't always go in.

81
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:29,170
Sometimes it just hits the taint.

82
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,830
Sometimes it's just the that would hurt.

83
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:32,291
That would hurt.

84
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,730
You got a good grip on the upper deck
and it doesn't actually get in the

85
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,613
asshole.

86
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,010
He's just calling the lit up,

87
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,310
pulling the lit up on the
macaroni and cheese container.

88
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,530
Just get the steam out.

89
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,161
Yeah,

90
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:46,020
just Tupperware in that motherfucker.

91
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,950
But sometimes it goes
in the asshole freakiest

92
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,130
thing is you know how to rope off
everything at a Times Square when uh,

93
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,510
when the ball is going
to drop or whatever.

94
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:54,950
Yeah.

95
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,420
And there's a certain time you
can't go past the barricades.

96
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,980
One night I was there and

97
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,700
the guy said,

98
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,290
well you remember the
Church of Scientology?

99
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,040
And I said,

100
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,873
yeah,

101
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,550
and he let me in through the barricade.

102
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,451
Real Story.

103
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:07,900
Dude,

104
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,733
real story.

105
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,660
He probably just wanted to fuck you

106
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
[inaudible] handsome guy.

107
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,420
But that's what they told me.

108
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:27,020
So like that would probably be
like 7% or something like that.

109
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:27,970
If I was,

110
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,551
I was super,

111
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:32,990
super lean but not doing compared to
these guys with these guys are doing,

112
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,790
I was,

113
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,880
I was working out with these guys are
doing is like getting real close to death

114
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,500
while keeping giant muscles.

115
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:41,090
It's fucking madness.

116
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,970
Like this is the nuttiest
fucking sport of all time.

117
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,131
Yeah.

118
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:45,070
It's performance art.

119
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,930
This duck,

120
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,570
I will rip your Dick
[inaudible] ass doors.

121
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,940
Those bank fault ass doors of his
shit looks like charge our bags.

122
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,910
My grandmother like Moans,

123
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,811
like she's,

124
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:01,370
she's hurt so bad.

125
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:02,204
She can't move.

126
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,800
She had an aneurysm 12 years ago,

127
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,450
so she's just lying in bed like that.

128
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,333
Hello.

129
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,281
Here is a man.

130
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,920
She was in just paying the one time.

131
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,790
She does.

132
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,110
She's done from the aneurism on.

133
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,790
They gave her 72 hours to live.

134
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,020
She lived for 12 years.

135
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,760
Yeah,

136
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,170
and it wasn't a good 12 years.

137
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,460
It wasn't a good 12 years,

138
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:19,650
but see,

139
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,770
your grandfather was getting zero action.

140
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,900
I'd probably do whatever you want it.

141
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,140
This is exactly what I was saying earlier.

142
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,180
GRANDPA's coming in.

143
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,860
You can hide the fucking canola eas,

144
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,850
but you're not high net fucking bloom.

145
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,990
Hey,

146
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,500
she's going to be hairy guy.

147
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,900
That fucking God goes,

148
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,020
oh,

149
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,020
she got a big fucking juicy guy
who she's saying at the end of it,

150
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,970
that's when you know you're done.

151
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,820
When you hit the Gaga.

152
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:06,020
Good.

153
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,400
On this broad,

154
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,650
what I fucking do,

155
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:10,970
you should say of her,

156
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,073
my brother,

157
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't know if she's moaning
because of the aneurism.

158
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,910
Gogo Kellogg

159
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,470
from Kellogg cereal.

160
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:25,304
Right.

161
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,203
He had a thing.

162
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,133
He was very,

163
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,233
you ever see that?

164
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,700
People who masturbate you
gotta thing about that.

165
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,250
I mean the whole thing
with the corn flakes,

166
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,540
the reason corn flakes were invented
was to stop boys from masturbation.

167
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,111
How was it?

168
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:40,460
How was the idea behind that?

169
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:42,340
We do that explained
this to us before then.

170
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,580
The idea is that spicy foods excite
the sensibilities and so if you eat

171
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:47,960
something that tastes interesting,

172
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:48,890
you're going to want to come.

173
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,203
So they,

174
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,760
they embed and also Graham crackers.

175
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,490
Graham was another,

176
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,340
these big ante masturbation
evangelizers so invent these really

177
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,320
intentionally bland foods.

178
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,140
They like to keep the teenage boys from
jerking off so that when they finger,

179
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:06,980
they're assholes.

180
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:08,210
They immediately calm.

181
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,743
Exactly

182
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,933
veal.

183
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,670
Keep them in the dark.

184
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,260
Oh yeah,

185
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,870
cow could milk itself.

186
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:21,800
That would be bad.

187
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,370
And she goes,

188
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,203
Oh,

189
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,220
I'm not the problem with money anymore.

190
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,740
Your father's the one who
spends all the money now.

191
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,791
And then she pointed my,

192
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,390
Dan goes,

193
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,050
tell him,

194
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,370
tell him what you spend your money on.

195
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:34,840
And I've already clicked
what this won't be.

196
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:35,440
And I've gone,

197
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,230
oh wait,

198
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,050
look,

199
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:37,780
I want to know.

200
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,590
I don't want to know.

201
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,520
And then it goes,

202
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,440
your father gets prostitutes

203
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,523
and I've gone,

204
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,790
oh,

205
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,960
just shut up.

206
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:51,961
Both of your police and she's gone
yet every Wednesday your father,

207
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:57,070
before he goes to play lawn bowls goes
off and gets himself a prostitute.

208
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,810
And then my dad went,

209
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,550
not every Wednesday.

210
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,530
Do you have a catch phrase when you hunt,

211
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:06,923
when you hit one?

212
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,933
I need one.

213
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:09,950
Well,

214
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,783
yes.

215
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,990
Blam Blam we eating ham.

216
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,350
I'm not sure if he's going to answer.

217
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,003
Yeah,

218
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,550
you're on the radio.

219
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,070
You're live on the podcast.

220
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,640
Fucking doors over there.

221
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,300
That's all I love.

222
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,390
Say I love you.

223
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,911
I love you man.

224
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:56,481
We love you too,

225
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:57,314
man.

226
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:58,930
No,

227
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,810
that's how you impregnate.

228
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:02,030
The Sun would come

229
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,550
up a black hole.

230
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,170
We don't know what to
do about a black hole.

231
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,750
We can get an infinite amount
of Dunkin's to come in it.

232
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,001
Well,

233
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:10,211
it's,

234
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:10,740
you know,

235
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,890
mass broken down to the smallest,

236
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:13,724
right?

237
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,620
It's not going to stop an
infinite amount of come.

238
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,723
Trust me,

239
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,730
there's a whole other universe inside.

240
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:22,420
They're still not big enough
for infinite amounts of calm.

241
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,353
Sorry.

242
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,470
The black hole is like,

243
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,520
what the fuck?

244
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:28,770
So

245
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,910
this is one of the things,

246
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,820
especially talking to college
students that I love bringing up,

247
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,781
which is that,

248
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:34,690
and I'm the first to a minute,

249
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:36,480
like I have no fucking
clue what I'm doing.

250
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,950
99% of the time,

251
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,540
especially when I got started,

252
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,590
I still don't know.

253
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:40,891
And I've,

254
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:42,150
I've come to realize like,

255
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,980
and I've got,

256
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:44,231
I've got,

257
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:45,960
I've been lucky enough to meet
some pretty like successful,

258
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:46,621
impressive people.

259
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:48,390
But like you dig under the surface,

260
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:49,260
we're all just hacking it.

261
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,720
Like we're all just expertise,

262
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:51,080
experience,

263
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,930
those things all help.

264
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,420
But like every one of
us is a fallible human,

265
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,540
all the and rules and status quo we know
were created by other fallible humans.

266
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,421
Yeah.

267
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:02,220
And there's no reason not
to look at that and go,

268
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:02,730
Huh,

269
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,810
does it have to be that way?

270
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:04,920
Or why is it that way?

271
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,360
And if the reason why is,

272
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,380
well that's the way it is.

273
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,700
Well that's a terrible reason,

274
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:09,661
you know?

275
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:10,494
And,

276
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,720
and when you see the world
as being that hackable,

277
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,583
so to speak,

278
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,790
like you start to realize,

279
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,001
all right,

280
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:15,421
well let's just,

281
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,650
let's actually question stuff.

282
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,673
Tell,

283
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,230
did you see a special roadwork?

284
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,981
I heard it's awesome.

285
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:20,640
So funny.

286
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,001
But he,

287
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:21,240
um,

288
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,240
I was sitting at the table with my dissing
rounds of venture female comics and

289
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:26,490
we were like eating dessert.

290
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,750
It was like a really like,

291
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:28,360
sad moment.

292
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,841
He just walks up.

293
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:29,011
We're like,

294
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:29,581
hey Dave.

295
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:30,270
He's like,

296
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:30,421
oh,

297
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:32,210
what are you guys having
no boyfriend mode?

298
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,340
Tell him what does that tell a story?

299
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,680
We're all from about keep Kimbo slice.

300
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,450
Kimbo slice on ultimate fighter.

301
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:41,580
Yeah.

302
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,560
When you were guys were doing that,

303
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,220
they didn't even show this on there.

304
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,040
So this guy,

305
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm not going to mention
his name on the show.

306
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:50,210
He lost and you can drink all that
alcohol you want in the house.

307
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,141
And there's only,

308
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:52,610
at the time there's only four of us left,

309
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:54,560
still fighting and one of
the other guys is hammered.

310
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,221
Hammered.

311
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:55,851
He's lost,

312
00:09:55,851 --> 00:09:56,121
right.

313
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:56,870
Hammered,

314
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,703
wasted.

315
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,060
All of a sudden this guy gets super racist
in the house and there's all bunch of

316
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:02,894
black guys in the house.

317
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,250
I'm sleeping.

318
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,660
And I thought it was a dream.

319
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,800
Kimbo slice and,

320
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,190
uh,

321
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,270
Marcus Jones and this and this
d'amico and this demicco Rogers,

322
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,720
uh,

323
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,471
comes in my room.

324
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:12,800
They go,

325
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,070
Yo,

326
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,550
shop,

327
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:13,881
get up,

328
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:14,540
dog.

329
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,230
Get up man.

330
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,620
I'm like,

331
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,130
Huh,

332
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,890
why are there three large
black guys run my bed?

333
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,761
Kim Goes,

334
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:20,594
Yo man,

335
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,640
this dude's down there
talking about our people.

336
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,230
We're about to jack him up.

337
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,551
I literally,

338
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:26,180
I thought I was in the gym.

339
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,540
I go,

340
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,373
excuse me,

341
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,790
it's talking about our people dog.

342
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,830
Let's go eff this dude up and like,

343
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,250
listen,

344
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,020
uh,

345
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,040
you guys realize I said,

346
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:34,181
I'm,

347
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:35,540
I'm told I'm not down with the race thing.

348
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,980
I'm totally down to fuck this dude up.

349
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,330
But you realize I'm not black,

350
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:38,571
right.

351
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,350
Kim Goes,

352
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,183
you ain't

353
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:41,791
no bad.

354
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,530
He goes,

355
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,071
damn,

356
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,940
that's crazy.

357
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,620
Turn around and leave.

358
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:47,180
And I hear that's why a lot shop,

359
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:48,420
you can't tell what the hell he is.

360
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,960
I go eight Kimbo that's racist dog,

361
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,660
Ypo.

362
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,910
Just cause I'm athletic and
can file you gotta be black.

363
00:10:58,911 --> 00:10:59,241
He goes,

364
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,400
you could be and cute

365
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,571
I guess.

366
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:03,321
But here's the other thing.

367
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:03,630
I mean,

368
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:03,900
I,

369
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,510
I don't even know if the
word is trick and I'll,

370
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,690
I mean I totally fell for him.

371
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,753
The shit out of you.

372
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,470
I feel like,

373
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,060
I guess it is trek,

374
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,650
but it's also once he was like,

375
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,270
why would I question that in my life?

376
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:16,580
No one's ever lied about where
they went to school that I knew of.

377
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,210
Right.

378
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,240
These are not lies that in society
we're told to look out for.

379
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:21,380
It'd be one like everyone's like,

380
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,250
does he have another family?

381
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,800
I wouldn't even think
about like your school.

382
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:25,431
Like who cares?

383
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:26,620
It's like lying about your blood type.

384
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,920
Disruption in a competitive
market is actually very,

385
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,650
very enticing to the,

386
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,190
to the second and third tier players
because they don't have an advantage.

387
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:39,230
There are too small to
compete against the big guys.

388
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,390
But if they see this
disruptive technology,

389
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:41,631
I think,

390
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:45,410
well maybe if I hit your ride on
that I'm going to overtake everybody.

391
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,490
Um,

392
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,510
and you know,

393
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:50,930
I can be the blockbuster
or it can be the Netflix.

394
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,530
I can be the tower records

395
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,420
or I can be the iTunes.

396
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,050
And we've seen this happen in
technology racist before of course,

397
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,690
but I meant like when you're not
doing this and you said five hours,

398
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,100
five hours maybe.

399
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,260
Is that because you all juiced
up with nicotine all the time?

400
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,870
I think cause I'm old and my prostate
tells me it's time to get up.

401
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,330
I take a leak five hours and you're good.

402
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,140
Um,

403
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,920
if I'm lucky,

404
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,753
you know,

405
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,290
get some palm palm juice.

406
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,940
Have you tried some of
those pills that help?

407
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,710
What is this doctor Oz who gives a shit?

408
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,810
It's like we were just watching
heavy metal and there's like a,

409
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,520
a Caribou carcass here.

410
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:25,851
It's like,

411
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:29,210
have you ever thought of
like who gives a shit?

412
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,970
It's part of getting
old guys get used to it.

413
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,170
Get used to it.

414
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,870
Let's say that

415
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,030
they somehow cooptive and we sell that.

416
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,043
Right?

417
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,250
Tony also replace Alex Jones.

418
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,851
He's waiting.

419
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:40,511
He's in Austin,

420
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,260
Texas.

421
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,400
You say you're the number one,

422
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:43,600
but I've got the statistics.

423
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,300
I've got the documents right
here and show you're a liar.

424
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:49,060
Jank you're a new world order puppet.

425
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,360
He seems like he's out there
working for the people.

426
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:55,030
He's not working for the
people who went for MSNBC.

427
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:55,810
Ladies and gentlemen,

428
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,680
you don't get to Msnbc unless you
sell your soul to David Ike's.

429
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:03,860
Reptilians I you see I use a
prop on my first open mic and uh,

430
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,540
I didn't realize it was racist.

431
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:06,770
I'm just race.

432
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,121
What was it?

433
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:10,180
A black like join the cross burning.

434
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,310
I mean as a monkey with a fucking
jockey outfit on and a basketball,

435
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,350
his hat on backwards with
a boombox and his shoulder.

436
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,393
I had no idea

437
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,660
it was a punching.

438
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:25,991
None.

439
00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:29,830
Picking cotton in blackface
chained to a plantation stare.

440
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,460
It was open Mike Nights.

441
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:33,850
Sorry.

442
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,020
Is robbing a white man.

443
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,140
Hey Batman book,

444
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,160
Fat Albert's friend with
the hat over his face open.

445
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,030
Dabu Hey,

446
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,930
no dues.

447
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,813
Racist.

448
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,661
I'm sorry.

449
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:53,410
What were you saying?

450
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,011
I've had sex.

451
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:58,420
Why life sold after the woman left
because he thought I was rational.

452
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,440
You thought it was rational?

453
00:13:59,620 --> 00:13:59,801
No,

454
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:02,080
cause I remember she was like
scratching this area of her body.

455
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,341
When she left.

456
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:04,650
I was like freaked out so hard.

457
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,070
But I went into my bathroom,

458
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:09,520
I started Lysol hauling my legs
like shape and then dish soap.

459
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:10,980
And then Lysaght and the next day I,

460
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,070
speaking of 12 step meetings,

461
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:15,970
I went to my first and only
sex addicts anonymous meeting.

462
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,571
I was just like,

463
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:17,590
something's got to change.

464
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,600
To look at your face was awesome,

465
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,020
but you know,

466
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,571
there's no,

467
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:27,201
there's very little,

468
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:27,250
well,

469
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,130
the way for you to convince yourself that
you're just like a young man swinging

470
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:30,410
around,

471
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,210
having a good time,

472
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,830
engaging in the regular sexuality of all
human beings when you're spraying Lysol

473
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:36,664
on here.

474
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,651
And so now,

475
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:38,931
you know,

476
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:40,180
it's still use faggot in the column.

477
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,630
I'm not one of those uh,

478
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,940
gay rights activists who,

479
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,171
you know,

480
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:47,500
when David Spade or Jonah Hill or Alec
Baldwin uses Faggot like falls down and

481
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:48,970
screams and yells and
calls for their heads.

482
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,931
I've actually,

483
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,111
you know,

484
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,540
I defended David well a million years
ago from glad when they were after him.

485
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,420
I think Louis C K does it a
hilarious things with faggot.

486
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,860
So I don't think that it's not a hate
word anymore if you can't let straight

487
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:03,030
people use it when the case,

488
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:03,410
when the,

489
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,060
their intent is clearly not hateful.

490
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,300
And so I feel like it shouldn't
be a problem for people
to use the t word tranny

491
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,050
in a non hateful context.

492
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:15,160
But so many trans people are so
invested right now politically in uh,

493
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,960
in stopping its usage at all ever.

494
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,000
And uh,

495
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:20,541
you know,

496
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,460
in deference to their
delicate sensibilities

497
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,880
stopped Ari Shaffir has so
many stories about China.

498
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:28,610
We talked about so many other things
besides his stories about China,

499
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,840
which is how we have to keep going.

500
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:32,180
So you have bout to tell
some crazy noodle story.

501
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,250
So they had these noodles is
treat noodles you can get,

502
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,720
I was advised the first day,

503
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,730
like you don't want those
and show them this video.

504
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,700
What they would do is they
would go to the sewer,

505
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,100
they would take raw sewage out of the
sewer and then boil it down the way they'd

506
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:47,690
make wax hash wax,

507
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,720
they'd boil off the sewage and whatever
was left that's cooking oil that they

508
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:55,664
would use.

509
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,140
It's super fucking harmful.

510
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,870
And then sell to like a lot
of the street noodle guys.

511
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,681
Yeah.

512
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:02,750
That face is what I made that same face.

513
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,580
They were cooking with sewer oil,

514
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:05,414
Bro,

515
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,950
I think we've been parasitized by an
astonishing farm of political correctness.

516
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,360
I mean what does Pressa ties
lighten there like a parasite that,

517
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,213
oh right.

518
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,340
So in the same way that I like that word
that viruses can enter your body virus,

519
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,940
viruses of the Mike and
also take over your,

520
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:28,210
I mean religion is an example of a Mima
plex form of some people would be upset

521
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:28,821
by what I'm saying,

522
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,850
but a form of parasite that
kind of rewires your thinking.

523
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,340
And so political correctness is a,

524
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,670
an astonishing form of parasitic thinking
where everything is viewed through the

525
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:43,310
lens of I should not offend anyone.

526
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,290
And so common sense and just reason goes
out the window in the pursuit of non

527
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:48,890
offense.

528
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,630
This is not a subject I'm really into,

529
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,280
but there is a woman,

530
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:56,480
this German woman who does shit porn where
people shit on her and she's like the

531
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:57,590
queen of Shit Porn.

532
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,930
Don't ask me how I know that somebody
posted it on my message board and I

533
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:03,650
followed a fucking all over link hole.

534
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,480
I went from link to link to link to,

535
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:07,330
I got to her site and
watch some of her videos.

536
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:07,701
Your side.

537
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:08,840
Good egg.com.

538
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:11,571
Uh,

539
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:12,500
I feel like,

540
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,300
um,

541
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,680
if you tell me in the
past what's the core age,

542
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:20,150
what's the opposite of courage?

543
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:24,860
I want to say cowardness because either
you tough enough to challenge and to

544
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:28,280
fight or to or in their new
car and then you chicken out.

545
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,130
So that's in the past was like the,

546
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:30,301
the,

547
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:30,970
the,

548
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,240
the,

549
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,600
the opposite of,

550
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,130
of,

551
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,790
of courage is very high to
measure this in those days.

552
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,640
And I believe the opposite
of college should they,

553
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:41,630
is conformity.

554
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,171
You know,

555
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:43,490
his people get conformed.

556
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,031
Oh,

557
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:44,141
I,

558
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:46,610
I don't like my wife
the way I used to like,

559
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,000
but I'm never going to divorce because
I'm afraid to lose my house or the

560
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:52,980
situation is so established
so I'm going to keep,

561
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,490
so I don't like this job but I got to
keep here because better than he is.

562
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,130
So [inaudible] not the hands of the few.

563
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,500
If you get caught on that
kind of compromise to,

564
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,770
to maintain because you
were you afraid to risk,

565
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,800
that's keep you like one
step behind from you,

566
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,300
follow your heart,

567
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,440
follow your ambition.

568
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:15,470
So that's kind of pretty much where keep
you from be at your best because if you

569
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,830
willing to sacrifice,

570
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,060
if you're willing to,

571
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,560
to broke new new challenges.

572
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,050
If you really chew you in
the stage of liveliness and,

573
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:29,370
and excitement and unpredictability,

574
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,920
who make you feel like you're in heaven

575
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,180
even though her neck will fuck though
she was determined to do nominate people

576
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,410
shit like go across and

577
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,980
like go across the track too fast.

578
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,340
Right.

579
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,320
And once I see she had a 64 Chevy,

580
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,050
they used to bounce and
she loved like old music.

581
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,280
So we're not just bouncing,

582
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:49,770
listen to BB king and
she gonna beat the train.

583
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,080
That bitch hit that first
tracking and net went back.

584
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,230
She's like come and muscles to slap
the shit out of her knee and then went

585
00:18:57,271 --> 00:18:58,630
through the stern way.

586
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:03,630
Oh we know I had to jump out to sea in
Hola Nica washy drive across the track.

587
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,140
So you pull out your pitches,

588
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,881
hit me too hard.

589
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:07,830
Muscles like miss the train was coming.

590
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,940
Oh my God,

591
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:09,774
you bitches.

592
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,403
Sorry.

593
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:16,030
What's weird when anybody PR like when
a guy is like working in an angle and

594
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:21,031
trying really hard to like
position himself as better
than he positioned himself

595
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:25,510
as being like different
than every other guy.

596
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:25,890
Right.

597
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,200
I'm,

598
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,670
you know,

599
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,870
there's a lot of guys out there
to doing really negative things.

600
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:31,180
Like I read this one guy's
fucking Twitter page of the day.

601
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:32,050
It was amazing.

602
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,011
It was just like,

603
00:19:33,011 --> 00:19:33,241
he's,

604
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:34,840
he might be the ultimate White Knight.

605
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,400
I don't want to give out his Twitter page.

606
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:36,790
Yeah.

607
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,480
But he,

608
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,820
he might be like the
greatest I if I met him,

609
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:44,230
he probably has almost no blood in his
veins is blood sugar is probably zero.

610
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,850
He'd probably faints all day long.

611
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,420
It was so weak.

612
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,390
But one of the things he said is he said,

613
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,233
all,

614
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,930
he said,

615
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,690
although I still practice feminists,

616
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,700
I still practice feminism.

617
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,350
I no longer,

618
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:02,950
um,

619
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,750
associate I no longer,

620
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:04,970
well,

621
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:05,501
what'd he say?

622
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:10,501
Advertise myself as a feminist because
I feel like it's up to women to decide

623
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:13,360
whether or not I'm doing
feminism correctly.

624
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:14,860
Oh,

625
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,693
Jesus Christ.

626
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,820
So I'll still practice feminism,

627
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,360
but I will no longer advertise
myself as a feminist.

628
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,733
Jesus Christ.

629
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:27,883
That's a,

630
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,870
I actually don't even know
what to say about that.

631
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,120
Male feminism is a very strange thing,

632
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,700
but we would sit up there all night.

633
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,810
It would be me,

634
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:36,351
Norton,

635
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:37,850
mainly Keith and Patrice.

636
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,650
Just Smith.

637
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,520
Billie birther,

638
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,200
fucking Billy comes into the seller,

639
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,843
right?

640
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,241
And she says,

641
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:45,350
I'm going to the world series.

642
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,340
It's when the mets were
playing the in the world share.

643
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:49,174
He's a subway.

644
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:49,901
He goes,

645
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:50,591
I'm going to the game.

646
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:50,801
We go,

647
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:51,251
how the fuck?

648
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,090
How do you get tickets?

649
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:52,931
He goes,

650
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:53,031
wow,

651
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:58,031
these dudes hired me to do a show under
a bus on the way and are given and right

652
00:20:58,121 --> 00:20:59,020
when he said that,

653
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,520
everybody's eyes lit up.

654
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,553
We're fucking

655
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,783
we.

656
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,280
We did shit like this.

657
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,660
You guys are a good crowd.

658
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,080
And off the bus we beat him to
sweat was pouring down Billy's head.

659
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:14,914
He didn't do it.

660
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,250
He gave the Gig away.

661
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,640
He didn't do it again because
we beat them down so hard.

662
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,770
It just fucking animals.

663
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,561
I tell him,

664
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:28,394
my daughter,

665
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,001
a couple of,

666
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:31,170
I made me two months ago about a,

667
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,720
there's an old Spanish proverb that says,

668
00:21:32,721 --> 00:21:33,060
Whoa,

669
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,560
um,

670
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,840
habits begin is cobwebs
and end up as chains.

671
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,100
Way Easier to break in the
beginning than later off.

672
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,351
Right.

673
00:21:39,351 --> 00:21:40,011
Way To put it.

674
00:21:40,011 --> 00:21:40,880
It's a great way to put it.

675
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,600
Wow.

676
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,440
And uh,

677
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,460
anyway,

678
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,150
she just,

679
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,140
she just brought this up,

680
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:45,321
uh,

681
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:45,741
you know,

682
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:46,490
um,

683
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,320
that we were talking about
someone she knew and,

684
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:51,170
and something that she didn't
like that they did and she said,

685
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:51,321
yeah,

686
00:21:51,321 --> 00:21:53,180
but they're still pretty
much in the cob web phase,

687
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,430
so they can probably
still change it at him.

688
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:55,850
Was like,

689
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,010
well,

690
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,601
I even,

691
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:57,170
I didn't remember.

692
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:57,501
She's like,

693
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:57,741
Oh yeah,

694
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:58,970
the cob webs and change things.

695
00:21:58,971 --> 00:22:00,690
Like she really sunk
in her and she's like,

696
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:00,780
yeah,

697
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,610
five societaly.

698
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,590
We're so resistant to looking at mental
illness the same way we look at physical

699
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:08,424
illness.

700
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,241
We're so,

701
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:10,320
it's so easy.

702
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,830
Paul Gil Martin just made this point
when he was on my podcast last week.

703
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:19,410
If you went up to somebody with diabetes
type one diabetes and you were like,

704
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:20,250
what the fuck dude?

705
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,170
Why don't you just think more positively
so that your pancreas makes insulin?

706
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,340
Like what's wrong with you?

707
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,890
Why can't you just make more insulin?

708
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,971
It's like they'd be like,

709
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:31,140
what are you talking about?

710
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,120
It's the same thing with depression.

711
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,610
People put the onus on you like they,

712
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,100
they look at it like
it's a disease of will,

713
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,240
but it's not.

714
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:39,631
It's a,

715
00:22:39,631 --> 00:22:44,631
it's a biological illness and that's just
very hard for people to understand and

716
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,750
so what you end up doing is carrying
around a lot of guilt and shame and a lot

717
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:49,321
of feelings like,

718
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:50,041
I'm not good enough.

719
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:53,190
I can't will myself out of this
if I just think more positively.

720
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:54,330
It's not about that,

721
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,830
and I did that for years,

722
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,023
years.

723
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,950
You just deal with it and I destroyed.

724
00:22:59,010 --> 00:22:59,310
Oh,

725
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,690
so many relationships.

726
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,260
The feeling of being a self,

727
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:03,790
the feeling that we call I,

728
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:08,791
the feeling of being an ego in the head
is what it feels like to be thinking

729
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,540
without knowing that you're thinking.

730
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,021
It's the,

731
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:13,570
it's the feeling of this next thought,

732
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,610
capturing consciousness.

733
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,530
So when you say that thoughts,

734
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,050
you are identical to thoughts.

735
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:21,820
So if you're thinking something
really fucked up like a,

736
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:22,601
I'm fat,

737
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,500
I'm a loser,

738
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:24,760
I'm always going to be a loser.

739
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:29,200
Like that is identical to who you are
because you are sort of framing yourself

740
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,130
in this thought,

741
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,130
these thoughts that you're
carrying around your mind there,

742
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,980
what's occupying your
consciousness and the,

743
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:39,670
if those thoughts are on the forefront
of your consciousness that they identify

744
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:40,180
you,

745
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,661
you are,

746
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:44,050
that you are those thoughts and
you are identical to that idea.

747
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:44,561
Yeah.

748
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:47,450
And their and their driving behavior
and they're driving emotion and they're

749
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:50,420
driving each subsequent train of thought.

750
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,051
So it's,

751
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:51,380
it's,

752
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,560
it's determining the,

753
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:53,801
the,

754
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:57,560
the future expressions of your
consciousness and your body as well.

755
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,250
Those guys,

756
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,560
I mean it's not easy if for example,

757
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:05,360
Brock was furious when Vince told him
that he wanted him to beat the undertaker

758
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:05,721
that day.

759
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:07,730
Like in real life like Betty was.

760
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:08,960
And you were there to see it.

761
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:09,501
No,

762
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:11,030
but I talked to somebody who was,

763
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,770
but he was honest with you.

764
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,510
It's not like they lie all day.

765
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:15,344
Every day.

766
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,060
Tony is going to talk to some people.

767
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:17,751
Let me tell you a little,

768
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:18,470
I'll tell you what.

769
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,000
Brock was actually mad.

770
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,740
He was really mad.

771
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,090
He read the script and
you just like bullshit.

772
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,130
I'm not picking up.

773
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:26,521
Fuck you.

774
00:24:26,521 --> 00:24:27,370
Don't undertake undertaker.

775
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,850
Some of the guys that work,

776
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,380
unlike the technical side
for the UFC work for the WWE,

777
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,130
ARD,

778
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:34,963
Brock was crying.

779
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,073
That's what I heard.

780
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:39,800
That's went to the hospital
with the undertaker.

781
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,721
Cried so hard.

782
00:24:40,721 --> 00:24:42,740
He dehydrated himself for that match.

783
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,820
They had to give him an IV

784
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,790
to replenish his teasing thought he
killed the undertaker from that concussion

785
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,793
was bad.

786
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,540
Bad.

787
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,141
It was real.

788
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:53,370
The concussions are real.

789
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,643
You can't,

790
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,030
I don't even buy it was a real concussion.

791
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,470
I probably faked a concussion.

792
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,771
Then dot.

793
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:01,060
Jt,

794
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,760
I'm not take her to the hospital.

795
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,210
He's got up Bobo and
even on the real booboo.

796
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:06,661
Folks,

797
00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:07,321
if you don't take,

798
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:07,931
it's a real boob.

799
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:08,110
La,

800
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,720
show you the fucking band aid on it

801
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,780
for your own belief.

802
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,460
Pitching something at four year olds,

803
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,860
so booboo,

804
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,470
it is a booboo and needs up their day.

805
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,321
Honey,

806
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:28,890
there's no,

807
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,880
he's not even bleeding.

808
00:25:29,881 --> 00:25:32,250
You don't need a bandaid bandaid.

809
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,940
Okay,

810
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,440
well bandaid make you feel better.

811
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,660
We'll get you a bandaid.

812
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:37,750
Did took the undertaker
and put a bandaid on him.

813
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,020
Tony Hinchcliffe in a gold
suit holding the script.

814
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,340
I can't believe it's our real poop.

815
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:50,070
He's jumping up and down in circles and
Vince Mcmahon is standing there shaking

816
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:50,904
his head.

817
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,530
Got Color of purple.

818
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,410
I'll fucking pent up with rage.

819
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,510
That's how I wrote it

820
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,000
out.

821
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,833
It's a booboo.

822
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:07,723
Look at the bandaid.

823
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,490
It's real.

824
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,410
It's a real bandaid.

825
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,111
Ladies and gentlemen,

826
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:11,130
if you doubt it.

827
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,021
What else do you like?

828
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:13,800
That sucks.

829
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,730
Um,

830
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,570
I was driving,

831
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,340
I live on the east side and I was driving,

832
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,500
I was riding on a TV show for a little
while and I was driving to work one

833
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:27,030
morning and I couldn't get to work because
there was so much traffic and I was

834
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:27,301
just like,

835
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:28,620
what the fuck is going on?

836
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:28,860
It's,

837
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,830
it's 9:45 AM on Hollywood boulevard.

838
00:26:31,831 --> 00:26:33,060
Why is the show backed up?

839
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,930
And then I saw people like walking
around with these shirts on that said our

840
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:38,010
wounds are still open

841
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,880
and I feel like a real,

842
00:26:41,881 --> 00:26:43,830
I know I'm an asshole before say this.

843
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,600
I thought it was some kind of record

844
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,523
released

845
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,400
and I was getting so mad.

846
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:50,330
I thought like a rapper,

847
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,510
like a release day is going on.

848
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,590
It was still open.

849
00:26:57,591 --> 00:26:58,250
Our mouth,

850
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,010
I'll close is moving.

851
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,630
I rustled my toes

852
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,683
pretty,

853
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,300
my teeth is gold.

854
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,360
You're trying to buy my album,

855
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:16,361
but the shit's already sold out on
free style 2014 we won much love.

856
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,060
I've been trying to understand
this American phenomena
is southern Baptists and

857
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,230
one of the things that I think is the key
to this is that I think when they talk

858
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:32,460
about being born again,

859
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:34,800
originally baptism was just that.

860
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:35,761
I mean no,

861
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:38,340
you can get this through
DMT in five minutes,

862
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,050
but at the time of John The baptist,

863
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:42,330
you get it in five minutes
through being droned.

864
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,090
People were lining up on
the bank of the Jordan.

865
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:45,930
They go in,

866
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,010
he holds them under.

867
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,990
If he held him under just long enough,

868
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,810
you could actually induce
and near death experience.

869
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,250
New Life Review at the drowning
man sees his life pass before him,

870
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:01,050
hold them out of just long enough and
they'd have a near death experience almost

871
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:01,884
guaranteed.

872
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,240
I mean occasionally they might,

873
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:04,440
he might've done it too long,

874
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:08,290
but that was before litigation that
you might've lost four litigate.

875
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,470
Yeah.

876
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,980
Good theory actually.

877
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,910
And then you see they
come back and they said,

878
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,800
I've died.

879
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,820
I've seen the light.

880
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,350
I'd been born again.

881
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,090
I'm no longer afraid of death.

882
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,820
My life has been
transformed in five minutes.

883
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,160
And the baptists were the people who
revived baptism by total immersion in the

884
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:32,240
16th century and probably know in,

885
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,153
in America,

886
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,020
we don't hold the amount of that long
cause this is post litigation now.

887
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,190
But you know when,

888
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:39,930
when the Baptist first got going,

889
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,600
this idea of holding people
aren't as long enough.

890
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:47,250
All their language is the language
that relates to near death experiences.

891
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,360
And I don't think that to start with
baptism by total immersion was just

892
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:52,194
symbolic.

893
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,580
I think it was drowning.

894
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:54,811
Exactly.

895
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,940
It's a beautiful sensual ally.

896
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And I've had to deny myself that central
ally for the last three years because I

897
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,460
abused it because we want to
spark up a joint right now.

898
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,133
I

899
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,270
want to dive in right now.

900
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:09,601
Of course,

901
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:10,201
the Gel,

902
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:10,770
you're like,

903
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,930
you're like the serpent
in the garden of Eden.

904
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,750
Sure.

905
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,620
You want yes.

906
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,023
You sure?

907
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,511
Why not?

908
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:19,620
I don't want to force you into anything.

909
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:19,951
You're not,

910
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:20,784
you're not forcing me.

911
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,320
An interesting mix went na na,

912
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:22,591
na,

913
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:22,741
na,

914
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:22,951
na,

915
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:23,241
na that.

916
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:24,074
I'm going to go,

917
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,850
I'm going to go live on Joe Rogan.

918
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:27,840
Is that bad?

919
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,171
No,

920
00:29:28,171 --> 00:29:29,004
that's not bad.

921
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,181
That's the way to do it.

922
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:31,014
If you want to dive in,

923
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,441
we'll go.

924
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:32,250
A little baby hit.

925
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,330
So what I was getting into was,

926
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,613
um,

927
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,663
this,

928
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,050
this teller here,

929
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,830
American shit too.

930
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:42,040
That's

931
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,700
not that crappy.

932
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,533
Get in England.

933
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,030
That's made by American
scientists and botanists.

934
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,030
They all drive muscle
cars and they do steroids.

935
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,090
That's so familiar.

936
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,030
That's such a nice feeling.

937
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,120
But do they allow like
porn sites like in dorms?

938
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,860
Can kids get download porn?

939
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:57,311
Well,

940
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:58,001
I mean there's,

941
00:29:58,001 --> 00:29:58,510
I mean,

942
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,520
Jamie sent me up to go to a site no more.

943
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:02,561
Well,

944
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:02,890
yeah,

945
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:03,940
I mean you don't,

946
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:06,700
but you could always just download
it right from like a torrent.

947
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,250
Well you could just Google
porn and it'll be right there.

948
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,790
Right?

949
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,623
That's true.

950
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:11,351
Yeah.

951
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,184
But I'm just wondering

952
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,190
Monday giving out tips,

953
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:14,024
guys,

954
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,213
what's your favorite

955
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:20,983
one?

956
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,490
The one behind,

957
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,520
you know

958
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,423
it's right there.

959
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,161
It is.

960
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:28,994
Right.

961
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:32,930
We'll know what to do it again to
start all over again with Noah.

962
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:33,350
Sam,

963
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,010
same deal.

964
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,290
And he also had all of those
animals to fuck to no one.

965
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,170
We probably couldn't fuck the animals
cause he's had a fuck his kids and make

966
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,210
sure it made more kids.

967
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,790
Am I going to make people get saved?

968
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,481
Those loads.

969
00:30:44,481 --> 00:30:45,620
He was 500 years old.

970
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:48,260
I really felt that that should
have been the Russell Crowe movie.

971
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,250
Yes.

972
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,810
And just him fucking his kids.

973
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:51,763
You know what I mean?

974
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,810
Just two hours of Russell Crowe fucking
his daughter while the fucking rock

975
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:58,190
monster's guard over them.

976
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:58,551
Yeah.

977
00:30:58,551 --> 00:31:00,020
I liked the Hollywood
executive with this guy.

978
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,940
Like make me one of
them kid fucking movies.

979
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,553
Get a Bible

980
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,523
lesson.

981
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,090
If they have a better explanation,

982
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,980
let them write the script.

983
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:11,150
Hire a couple of Jews,

984
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,570
maybe a kid fucking moving

985
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,880
the idea of speaking about anything,

986
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,550
anything and everything.

987
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,310
Uh,

988
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,890
I think it's detrimental to not be able
to talk and to have people that want to

989
00:31:22,891 --> 00:31:25,890
shut other people up based
on their ideology or,

990
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,963
um,

991
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,530
anything that they're saying.

992
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,900
If you want to take someone
off the air of shut them up,

993
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,300
uh,

994
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:31,560
or,

995
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,120
or fire them from their job,

996
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,340
I think that's copping out and saying,

997
00:31:35,341 --> 00:31:35,551
look,

998
00:31:35,551 --> 00:31:35,940
I,

999
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,850
I can't logically argue or,

1000
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:40,260
or intelligently argue.

1001
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:42,090
So I just want them quiet.

1002
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,990
I want them silence.

1003
00:31:42,991 --> 00:31:45,360
Don't they know that by hamstring you,

1004
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:48,690
they fuck up their product and they
open up the door to the Internet.

1005
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,100
Yeah.

1006
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,591
Like the Internet.

1007
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:50,281
It's right there.

1008
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:51,630
It's the wolf at the door.

1009
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,110
Oh,

1010
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,620
it's right there.

1011
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,430
Right there.

1012
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,480
And really,

1013
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:54,721
you know,

1014
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:57,780
I was born deaf on one
side without a right or,

1015
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:58,651
and,

1016
00:31:58,651 --> 00:31:58,950
uh,

1017
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,130
in a family that wasn't very supportive.

1018
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,331
And,

1019
00:32:03,331 --> 00:32:04,164
um,

1020
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:09,090
I thought that success was going to be
the key to contentment and happiness.

1021
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:13,860
And like a lot of other people thankfully
became successful only to find out

1022
00:32:13,861 --> 00:32:15,600
that didn't change anything.

1023
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,090
And then the struggle becomes,

1024
00:32:18,091 --> 00:32:18,660
okay,

1025
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,100
what's it gonna take to be happy?

1026
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,680
The most I ever offered a sex worker was,

1027
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,933
um,

1028
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,833
10 grand.

1029
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,703
She wasn't,

1030
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,001
this is a,

1031
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:28,260
this is some vampire shit.

1032
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,020
This is like when
someone's not a sex worker.

1033
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:31,441
Yeah.

1034
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:31,801
It's like,

1035
00:32:31,801 --> 00:32:32,220
hey,

1036
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:32,970
like,

1037
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:33,750
hey,

1038
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,000
not in the Asian guys don't
want to fuck you at all.

1039
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,000
Like I have no desire to
fuck you and you're really,

1040
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:39,980
you're

1041
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,210
a Douche bag your crude.

1042
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:41,451
And I go,

1043
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:41,751
okay.

1044
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,584
So since,

1045
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,360
since I'm not denying any of that,

1046
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,820
um,

1047
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,320
so this is real money.

1048
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,550
Like this isn't a joke.

1049
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:50,690
Like,

1050
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:50,990
you know,

1051
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,560
I'm going to,

1052
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,970
I'm going to turn you into a horror.

1053
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,083
I'm sorry,

1054
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:54,531
I'm going to turn,

1055
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:54,750
you know,

1056
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,400
sex worker.

1057
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,233
Did you say that to her?

1058
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,800
So she's doesn't believe me.

1059
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,720
And then I take a picture,

1060
00:32:59,721 --> 00:32:59,901
I go,

1061
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:01,430
I'm holding 10 grand right now.

1062
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,271
And she goes,

1063
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:02,721
fuck you.

1064
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:03,441
You piece of shit.

1065
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,540
Like you think you think
like you can buy me.

1066
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,453
I go,

1067
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,191
all right,

1068
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:07,401
fine.

1069
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:08,090
Whatever.

1070
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,170
I don't think much about it.

1071
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,580
She calls me two months later.

1072
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,443
The text is,

1073
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,220
is the offer still good?

1074
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,223
I don't even,

1075
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,270
I don't even know who the

1076
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:15,661
girl is.

1077
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:16,080
I go,

1078
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,860
who is this and what?

1079
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,760
What are you talking about?

1080
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,050
She calls me and she goes,

1081
00:33:19,051 --> 00:33:19,890
you offered me tenure,

1082
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,683
and I go,

1083
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,290
no,

1084
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,160
it's five grand now.

1085
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,293
And she goes,

1086
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,240
you piece?

1087
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,530
I go,

1088
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,400
I offered you 10 grand
when I was horniest.

1089
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,260
Then I was like,

1090
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,120
I was playing a game and
I wanted it that bad.

1091
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:30,570
I'm like,

1092
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,440
when you said no,

1093
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:32,274
it's five grand.

1094
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,810
What'd she say that she said,

1095
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:34,680
go fuck yourself.

1096
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,000
Then she didn't have no,

1097
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:39,510
then she called me back and then she came
and she fucked me and then she didn't

1098
00:33:39,511 --> 00:33:42,000
take the money and she left
and I thought she forgot.

1099
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:42,271
I said,

1100
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:43,104
hey,

1101
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,580
you didn't take the money
and still on the thing.

1102
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:44,911
She said,

1103
00:33:44,911 --> 00:33:45,744
go fuck yourself.

1104
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,660
And then we have a weird,

1105
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,640
and we still fuck now we
have a weird relationship.

1106
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,150
The record at its core is about love.

1107
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,840
You know,

1108
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,150
being like this one universal truth.

1109
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,060
You get a lot of people look to religion.

1110
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,540
A lot of people look to drugs and I'm
not saying you can't get really spiritual

1111
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,100
experiences from all of those things,

1112
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:10,101
but I think love at the end of the day
is the one thing that really I've ever

1113
00:34:10,321 --> 00:34:13,560
found forced me to want to wake up and
really try to be a better human being

1114
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:14,160
every day.

1115
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,940
You know?

1116
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,880
So that was the main point of the album
and the turtles thing was just kind of,

1117
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,920
it's a way of saying if you get into an
argument with somebody and you realize

1118
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,780
it's just pointless and
you're going back and forth,

1119
00:34:24,781 --> 00:34:27,690
it's turtles all the way down because
like nobody really knows shit,

1120
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:28,524
you know?

1121
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,360
And we're all just trying
to not kill each other.

1122
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,030
So I don't know,

1123
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,790
I decided it would make
a good country song.

1124
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,160
Didn't you have like plans on being some
sort of a marine biologist or something

1125
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:40,671
at some point?

1126
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:41,440
Yeah,

1127
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,220
I tell people that story
because this is funny.

1128
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,331
On Twitter.

1129
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,560
I found this rock,

1130
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:48,920
my daughter found this rock on the
beach in Santa Barbara and how all these

1131
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,890
holes in it and we're trying to figure
out what the fuck it was was an asteroid

1132
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:52,161
or something.

1133
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:52,911
I put on Twitter.

1134
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:53,390
I go,

1135
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:58,340
what's this rock Joe fucking Perry is
the first guy to answer me on Twitter and

1136
00:34:58,341 --> 00:34:59,810
tells me it's a see stone.

1137
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:03,560
Like these animals had to like burrowed
into this stone and create a little

1138
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:05,330
homes really well.

1139
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,233
Um,

1140
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,483
well anyway,

1141
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,363
uh,

1142
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:12,381
oh,

1143
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:13,214
here's a great story.

1144
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,200
They landed a fucking comment.

1145
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,630
They landed on a comet and uh,

1146
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:22,690
the guy who landed on the comet was
wearing a shirt that had all these photos.

1147
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,790
Are these drawings of women on it?

1148
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,320
Yeah.

1149
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,153
Look at this.

1150
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,623
I don't care if you landed.

1151
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,463
It's

1152
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,840
fucking beautiful.

1153
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,800
I should hire like a real shower.

1154
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,340
Expensive

1155
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,620
tailor to make me an awesome suit of that.

1156
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,730
Yeah.

1157
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,860
The jacket and the pants with a vast,

1158
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:45,270
it ties the whole thing.

1159
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:45,531
Oh,

1160
00:35:45,531 --> 00:35:46,364
that would be awesome.

1161
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,400
They have the inside of the vest,

1162
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:48,930
like the ones that UFC made me,

1163
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:52,290
they have like little skull and crossbones
and the sat and we could have it all

1164
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,124
little dicks,

1165
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,880
little ticks and some,

1166
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,320
and even there was a
recent report on Hitler.

1167
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,490
Hitler himself was on uh,

1168
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,220
a litany of medication
and one of them was math.

1169
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,510
They were giving a math.

1170
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,500
They would give,

1171
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,500
do people back down,

1172
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,380
fault him for that dude.

1173
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,990
The amount of energy that that
guy put out during his speeches,

1174
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,010
he needed something to level off.

1175
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,363
Forget about,

1176
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,680
forget about the screaming and yelling.

1177
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,210
Just sitting that still

1178
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,240
waiting for the right moment.

1179
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:22,090
Building them into that,

1180
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,120
that frenzy.

1181
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,560
Do you ever watch that Michael Jackson
documentary right before he died,

1182
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,490
when he drove,

1183
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,770
just freeze after he did a dance move.

1184
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,970
Let it simmer,

1185
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:30,660
let it simmer.

1186
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,660
That's Hitler ship sitting
in that fucking chair.

1187
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,070
Just getting them crazy.

1188
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:38,070
Just wanting to hear
or see the next thing.

1189
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,060
What's he going to do?

1190
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,913
It's timing.

1191
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,500
Is it fucking timing the
balls to do that on stage?

1192
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,680
The Michael Jackson Hitler simmer moment.

1193
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,410
You would have to.

1194
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,280
We got to do that tonight
at the comedy still.

1195
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,430
Alright.

1196
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:50,690
We go.

1197
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,080
Okay.

1198
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,913
We've got to have this.

1199
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,300
You've got to have a dude.

1200
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,540
If we had some of the technology,

1201
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:58,740
I could be in your ear telling me you
had to keep a straight face after a

1202
00:36:58,741 --> 00:36:59,340
punchline.

1203
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,140
As you're looking down
at some fucked up pose,

1204
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,220
I'm just going to let it simmer.

1205
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,113
Let it simmer,

1206
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,890
let it simmer and release.

1207
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,660
So my dad was great.

1208
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:10,561
Yeah,

1209
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,394
I had a bird,

1210
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,850
had bird feeders out I bought recently
and they found out about it and now they

1211
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:16,020
won't leave my house alone.

1212
00:37:16,021 --> 00:37:17,060
They're there like every day.

1213
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,780
You amazing.

1214
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,040
That's cool dude.

1215
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:20,874
That's pretty dope.

1216
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:21,361
Yeah.

1217
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:23,100
They're loud too loud that
they're annoying as fuck.

1218
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,113
No,

1219
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,060
you didn't hear flows on put that will
let them into your spiritual compass.

1220
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,640
How is it that it's illegal if
you don't clean up after your dog,

1221
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:35,160
but you're allowed to just have
your fucking horse shit everywhere.

1222
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,833
Empty.

1223
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,610
It's giant asshole.

1224
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,780
1200 pound body of stewed grasses.

1225
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,431
I'm sorry.

1226
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:51,430
Is this cobblestone?

1227
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
This is a dirt road.

1228
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:53,011
You farmer.

1229
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:53,840
Fuck.

1230
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,650
Pick up after that donkey.

1231
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,481
Your donkey.

1232
00:37:57,481 --> 00:37:58,081
Just Shit.

1233
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:59,280
All of my Prius

1234
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:01,600
dog,

1235
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,730
he's not that green.

1236
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,950
This is contributing to global warming.

1237
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,210
Donkey was dirty ass.

1238
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:11,900
All Brian said he didn't
like Paris in his name.

1239
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,240
He's in bed with the chicken

1240
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:15,700
mark.

1241
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,480
Like I never said anybody.

1242
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,750
I only done this before.

1243
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,600
Oh my God.

1244
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:26,610
Of course.

1245
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,453
I always work on

1246
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,480
bringing the fucking
parents into the courthouse.

1247
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:49,620
We would now like to call
a prosecution witness.

1248
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,850
The Burbank Paris.

1249
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,200
I've never seen this before.

1250
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:54,590
No.

1251
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,270
Roofie what are you talking about are,

1252
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,133
you

1253
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,300
know,

1254
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,620
two heads is fine.

1255
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:08,370
I take two hits all the time
and I drive an ingrown hair.

1256
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,290
You know,

1257
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,950
all you need to do is you need
to do shit with that stuff.

1258
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,040
Kills everything.

1259
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,040
It'll tell ah,

1260
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,580
Eddie and that worked out at 24 hour
fitness and there's this dude who was the

1261
00:39:28,581 --> 00:39:29,051
manager there.

1262
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:29,721
It was a cool guy.

1263
00:39:29,721 --> 00:39:31,340
We just talked to them and uh,

1264
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,370
they had sent him over from
the Santa Monica Place.

1265
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,920
He was like a real personable,

1266
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,000
real friendly guy.

1267
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:38,481
Like he,

1268
00:39:38,481 --> 00:39:38,721
you know,

1269
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:39,800
real easy to like.

1270
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:40,701
And so,

1271
00:39:40,701 --> 00:39:40,881
uh,

1272
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:44,600
the Santa Monica police brought him in
because they needed to get that place

1273
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:48,410
cleaned out because he had
basically become just a fuck house.

1274
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,273
Yeah,

1275
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,600
the close the shower hose them down.

1276
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,410
Everyone that'd be common condos.

1277
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,130
But my buddy ended up working,

1278
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:01,791
that's how I found out I,

1279
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:05,330
but I ended up working at the same place
and they used to have to trap nudes,

1280
00:40:05,331 --> 00:40:07,370
gay dudes that were fucking
in the sauna and stuff.

1281
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,423
And

1282
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,020
I told the cop came cause it was
right next to a police station.

1283
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,910
How people die,

1284
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,744
Bro.

1285
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,350
Don't trap me in the Sauna.

1286
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,213
Make me fuck.

1287
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,033
I will do it.

1288
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:26,803
Are you ready?

1289
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,291
You Ready?

1290
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,130
You better let me out of here,

1291
00:40:28,131 --> 00:40:28,490
man.
