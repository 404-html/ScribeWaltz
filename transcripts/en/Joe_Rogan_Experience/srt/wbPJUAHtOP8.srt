1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,570
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,710
I was just on the phone with Alex Van
Halen and talking to him about we're going

3
00:00:05,711 --> 00:00:09,490
to be playing at the Tokyo Dome
work playing at the big arenas.

4
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:10,480
They're in Japan.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:10,820
Yeah.

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,820
And I wanted to remind him of exactly
what you just described that in the United

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,070
States and in Europe you have
was like an idling cheer.

8
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:24,110
A screen that's Ms. Lynch.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,850
It's constant like a car idling.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,763
Yeah.

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,613
Idols.

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,940
Like a drag racer.

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,320
Pluto to be bad,

14
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,450
like you depend on it the
way you do your Shpiel,

15
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:36,111
your talk,

16
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:37,310
your punctuation,

17
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,880
you know these delays be eating pudding.

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,230
You let them go.

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,710
Do you stand now?

20
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:46,260
Say the next thing that
you're going to say.

21
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:47,094
You know,

22
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,700
um,

23
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,580
so you're listening with that and uh,

24
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,220
when American just cheer there's,

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,390
it's like a car like,

26
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:55,980
well I think it's called blower wine.

27
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,453
Right.

28
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,550
And it goes for a long time and if you're
waiting like to say something next or

29
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:07,691
whatever,

30
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:11,270
you're listening for that and you're
listening for it to hit a certain point.

31
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,490
Volume wise.

32
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:16,660
Your duration wise that you interrupt.

33
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,530
No,

34
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,710
it's a little bit like
a dance you follow up.

35
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:20,730
Otherwise,

36
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,720
if people are making the long noise,

37
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:23,770
they enjoy them shops,

38
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:24,101
great.

39
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:25,450
Let them enjoy themselves.

40
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,640
They love hearing their own power.

41
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,331
Yes,

42
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:29,920
we are strong or wonderful.

43
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:30,910
We're young and skinny

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,100
is that night in Japan,

45
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:37,720
you don't get that correct.

46
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,280
You get the Yes,

47
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,403
yes.

48
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,560
Like it's,

49
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,320
it's sort of like a cheering for the ball,

50
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:47,890
getting spiked in a volleyball
tournament and it's quick,

51
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,120
very quick.

52
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:50,170
And I had said to Al,

53
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:51,250
you got to remember,

54
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:56,310
think back how fast the cheer is here
that we can't depend on that idling screen

55
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,230
and you know,

56
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,230
and the comedy show and be weird
where we get it laughing like,

57
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,420
ah,

58
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:04,680
I,

59
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,210
you know,

60
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,040
I call it rat pack style,

61
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:07,340
but it's,

62
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,540
it's just where you've made a
connection with the audience,

63
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,000
if pretty much no matter what you say,

64
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,880
as long as it's delivered in the right
tone with the right mood is you're a

65
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:19,520
host,

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:19,880
right.

67
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,730
The worst that I can
be on stage is a host.

68
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,670
The best is a really funny house.

69
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:26,990
Right.

70
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,820
Or are really smart house there.

71
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:29,654
They'd have fun.

72
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,270
You're there to help them.

73
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,200
Exactly.

74
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,940
So the worst that the least
I can do is be a good host.

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,760
And that means keep the
spirit you have to pay.

76
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,350
No,

77
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,710
especially if something goes wrong.

78
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,341
Oh my God,

79
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:43,630
the plumbing just exploded,

80
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,653
cried,

81
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,180
then everybody did.

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,570
Everybody's instantly,

83
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:49,961
okay,

84
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,291
great.

85
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,220
It's an adventure,

86
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,061
you know,

87
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:52,791
as opposed to,

88
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:53,990
Oh shit,

89
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:54,630
no,

90
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,080
no,

91
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,860
no.

92
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,693
That's horrible.

93
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,760
Oh my God,

94
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,594
this is,

95
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,740
I want to be here.

96
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:00,580
This isn't fun.

97
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,630
This is now turning into something
other than that's up to the host.

98
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,240
Right.

99
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,280
On a good night.

100
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,610
If you get everybody kind of Holman and
bubbling and well fed and watered and

101
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,963
you know,

102
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,470
then,

103
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:13,810
uh,

104
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,430
pretty much anything you say can be,

105
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:15,720
yeah,

106
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
it's a little bit funny.

107
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,200
Right.

108
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,940
And every now and then I hit a moment.

109
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,300
What?

110
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,480
I'm just Sammy Davis.

111
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,630
Did you ever end up at
all when you were done?

112
00:03:29,631 --> 00:03:30,570
Just straight standup?

113
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,311
You ever tried to do that?

114
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,144
Ever have?

115
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,351
Yeah.

116
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:34,350
I don't think I have the,

117
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,330
I don't have a dining.

118
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:36,620
I got the cards for it.

119
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,150
It's crazy because you,

120
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,630
you kind of do it a little on stage.

121
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,060
Yes.

122
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,060
It's just a tiny bit enough to sneak
up and tap the door and run back.

123
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,080
Yeah.

124
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,180
And then that immediately hit the music.

125
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:50,730
Boy,

126
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,563
I'm fatigued.

127
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,680
I always have those trapdoors built
every like Felix the freaking cat.

128
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,670
I can draw that door anywhere
on thin air and go look a song

129
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,990
he had about that fucking
brick I just laid out there.

130
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,330
You guys don't have that doors.

131
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,570
So,

132
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,520
but all of my,

133
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:12,270
uh,

134
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,690
greatest respects to
the job you have chosen,

135
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:16,471
uh,

136
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:17,304
for me,

137
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,121
there's always,

138
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:21,320
it doesn't even have to
wind up funny right from me.

139
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,570
It doesn't even have to
wind up clever or anything.

140
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:26,670
Just shut up Dave B the House.

141
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,053
Okay.

142
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:55,590
You Ready?

143
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,320
Of course recording.

144
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:57,651
Oh,

145
00:04:57,651 --> 00:04:58,484
it is already.

146
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,570
What the fuck's on?
