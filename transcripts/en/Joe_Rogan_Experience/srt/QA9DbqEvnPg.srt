1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,630
Three,
two,

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,800
one,
boom,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,390
and we're alive.
What's happening?

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,940
I,
I'm just stoked to be here because I'm

5
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:11,990
stoked to have you here.
Man.

6
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,490
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I love your show.

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,630
Thank you.
It's fun.

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,030
It's a fun fucking car show.
It really is,

9
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:17,720
man.
It is.

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,370
I tell people I might be the smartest
guy in the world.

11
00:00:19,371 --> 00:00:21,170
I figured out how to drink beer and play
with cars.

12
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,560
Paid for.
Yeah,

13
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,220
but it's like,
it's a fun show.

14
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:27,380
It's like you're not taking yourself too
seriously.

15
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:30,290
You having a good time,
you know you're buying and selling

16
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,960
awesome cars.
Oh yeah.

17
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,880
For sure.
It's was a dream of mine to get it done.

18
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:39,020
It took eight years to get it sold,
but here we are now.

19
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,040
Did it really?
Yeah,

20
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,850
it started to.
I started pitching the show in 2004.

21
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,130
We didn't start till 2008 or 2012.

22
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,220
What were you doing before that?
Uh,

23
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,360
before television or before gas monkey?
Yeah.

24
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,510
I kind of had two stages in life.
I was a firefighter police officer medic

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
before I was old enough to drink.
I mean,

26
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,340
I'm talking 19 years old carrying a gun,
probably want the smartest thing for

27
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:03,680
them to let me do.
And then I'm to let you know when you

28
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:06,110
were 19 I had a badge.
I was a cop.

29
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,050
I mean literally I was a police officer
and uh,

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,330
so by the time I was $20,
it's also a firefighter and a.

31
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,560
So I did that for awhile and then moved
into printing and advertising and then

32
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:22,550
sold that and got into this.
So was it just like something you just

33
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:25,550
always into cars and that's what led you
to the show,

34
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,490
you know,
how would I tell the story

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,170
diplomatically?
Um,

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,770
realistically I was watching the shows
that were on TV at the time.

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,010
I'm always been a car nut and a
motorcycle guy and what have you.

38
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:41,300
And I realized one night that my kids
are never in the room watching it and my

39
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,040
wife's not in the room watching it,
you know,

40
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,380
and uh,
the shows that we're on,

41
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:49,440
we're a little bit too much bravado and,
and I'm a tough guy and you know,

42
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,460
so I dug it and all my buddies dug it,
but the wives and stuff and I was like,

43
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,260
golly,
they're missing a big chunk of the

44
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:56,870
market here.
If you could tone down that part of it a

45
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:59,870
little bit and still have a cool brand
and still be a cool guy,

46
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,930
you know,
and get the moms and the kids in the

47
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:05,450
room,
hopefully it's a lot more successful.

48
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:09,110
And so that's kind of where the idea
came from and I just went out and

49
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,920
started it.

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,380
That's interesting.
So the marketing side,

51
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:15,200
have you kicked in?
So the marketing side of you went,

52
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,750
ah,
I think there's another way to do this.

53
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,180
I mean,
I'm still a tattooed guy with some

54
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,110
jewelry,
but you know,

55
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,150
I got a pit bull or poodle on a leash,
not a pit bull on a chain.

56
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,340
The show,
it doesn't seem compromised.

57
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,210
That's what's interesting about it
because it seems like a kind of a guy

58
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:32,660
show.
I never thought about it that way.

59
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,930
Well,
the way I approached it was just like

60
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:37,910
when I was a kid and my dad had a
garage,

61
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:43,130
a not a not open for public garage.
What do you have plays that we kept his

62
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:46,700
car and the neighbors would come over
and they tinker and they drink beer and

63
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:49,130
that's what our guys do.
So we kind of took that approach of

64
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,940
that's what gas monkey does.
We just drink some beer and play some

65
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,430
cars and goof around.
It's just like Saturday afternoon,

66
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:58,170
but all week long.
Did you have any background in,

67
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,010
in automobile

68
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,490
knowledge?
Did you know,

69
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:04,390
like how to fix things or did you.
Yeah,

70
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:07,360
I've never really been the full
fabricator.

71
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,291
Uh,
you know,

72
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,640
I understand everything and networks
works,

73
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:14,440
but I'm probably more of a business guy.
So I was able to go out and hire good

74
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:17,350
guys to do the fabricating stuff and
we've got a great team.

75
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,310
But I did have the car knowledge and I
and I had had the eyeball for what was

76
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:24,790
good and keeping up with what was going
to be happening and things like that.

77
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,770
And that's kind of my strong suit is
saying okay,

78
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,800
Porsche's are fixed to be popular so
we're going to get into 3:56 is or

79
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,840
broncos like the he drove it is you
know,

80
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,090
or what have you.
And I keep my eye on the market.

81
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,120
That's interesting.
But you still do keep your eye on the

82
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:41,210
market.
I saw that 68 that you have outside of

83
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,170
the 68 Chevelle.
Sixty eight,

84
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,060
68 convertible.
God Damn,

85
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:46,530
that's a nice car.
It's a good.

86
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,000
It's probably the best one I've ever
seen.

87
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,430
I mean from an original standpoint.
Yeah.

88
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,650
It's meant.
I mean it's got a little scuffs out.

89
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:53,730
It's,
it's driven,

90
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,550
you know,
but it's,

91
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,240
it's in perfect condition.
It doesn't have any dents or anything

92
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:59,730
wrong with it is literally a little old
lady from Pasadena.

93
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,360
I mean the lady bought it brand new and
she passed away a couple of years ago

94
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:05,340
and I bought it from her grandson.
Wow,

95
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:06,174
what a cliche.

96
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,180
Fifty 2000 original miles and never been
read old lady from Pasadena is a cliche.

97
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,940
It was technically Pomona,
but you know,

98
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,860
same shit.
Wow.

99
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,760
Yeah.
That car,

100
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:20,280
those uh,
I mean I've said this on the show a

101
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:23,460
million times.
I'm a giant fan of like the time period

102
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:28,020
of 1965 to somewhere around like 71.
They fell apart.

103
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,790
Yeah.
Know like you still get a 71 challenger

104
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,940
[inaudible] 71.
Barracuda is still pretty sweet for

105
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:35,490
sure.
But then you get into like 72,

106
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,470
73.
They had to start putting.

107
00:04:37,471 --> 00:04:42,471
The big bumpers are there with
everything just fell apart and he got

108
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:46,680
the gas crunch and then everything got
four cylinders and it was,

109
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,080
it was a bad time in the late seventies
for sure.

110
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,930
It was a bad time,
but it's a good time now.

111
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:54,810
It's a really interesting,
really interesting time now for muscle

112
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:56,820
cars.
It's the racist,

113
00:04:56,821 --> 00:05:01,500
so crazy that they're putting out street
legal cars you could buy from a dealer

114
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,250
with 700 plus horsepower and almost
every dealer has one now.

115
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,180
Oh yeah,
for sure.

116
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,580
I mean,
I've got a demon myself.

117
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,350
Eight horsepower.
It's fucking crazy.

118
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,250
Now.
The new GT,

119
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:13,470
$500 out,
that's going to have over 700

120
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:18,471
horsepower.
You know you have the Camaro l a m,

121
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,680
what is it?
One Ellie know.

122
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,733
What

123
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,940
was it?
[inaudible] one.

124
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:28,790
Ellie know what?
What the fuck is the name of the one?

125
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,390
Zero.
Zero.

126
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,470
One one ellie,
which is 650 horsepower and then the new

127
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:37,770
M,
Z are one at 750 horsepower.

128
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,060
This is preposterous.
Oh,

129
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:40,580
it's,
it's A.

130
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,370
I think it could be a little dangerous.
You know what everybody out there

131
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:44,761
thinking,
Hey,

132
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:49,150
I can drive a 700 horsepower car because
it's completely different than a normal

133
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:49,981
one.
Well,

134
00:05:49,981 --> 00:05:53,640
did you see the video of the guy from
one of the head guys at gm who took it

135
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:55,710
on track?
Like one of the first days of the

136
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:58,010
release in the car and he spun out on
the first

137
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,340
turn and slammed into the wall.
I can't say much.

138
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,840
I wrecked a brand new hell cat the other
day.

139
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,580
Race in Woodward.
Did you really?

140
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,950
Oh No.
I went to Woodward Dream cruise and they

141
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:11,840
had a little celebrity match up and I
was racing and just lost it and hit the

142
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:13,790
wall.
Took the whole side of the car.

143
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,940
Were you on a track or where you want to
strip?

144
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,380
It was a street track,
uh,

145
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,510
that they had right there on Woodward
Avenue.

146
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,050
So they put up the blocks and you take
off

147
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,450
those,
uh,

148
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,370
those hell cats are beautiful,
but they're not,

149
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,370
they're not that great at corner.
And that's still a giant car.

150
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,560
Big Car.
Yeah.

151
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,210
Mustang and the Camaro going to do
better in the corners for sure.

152
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,460
Yeah,
the hell kind of so much front.

153
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,470
There's so much out in front.
I mean,

154
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:42,890
it really does remind you more than any
of those other cars though,

155
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:45,020
of those 1970 cars,
you know,

156
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,840
really has that,
that shape is more I can like,

157
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:51,500
if you look at it,
1969 Camaro and then you look at a 2019

158
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,090
Camaro you like,
ah,

159
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,690
I don't see it.

160
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,170
That's not the same thing.
But the challenger really does look like

161
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,460
that old car.
Well,

162
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,110
Kim and Tim can discuss,
killed it.

163
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,290
I mean that was his whole passion
project the whole time he was running

164
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,010
dodge and he just absolutely nailed it.
Yeah,

165
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:09,110
no they did.
They made a great looking modern muscle

166
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:11,420
car.
The other ones are just great looking

167
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:12,580
cars.
I mean they,

168
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:14,780
they are still muscle cars,
but they don't really think.

169
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,960
You don't really think about the old
days when you see him now.

170
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,450
They've tried but they didn't get it as
good as dodge.

171
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,960
Now you guys make some fucking great
built to,

172
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,030
you know,
you guys have done some really sweet

173
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:30,410
custom builds like you were telling me
outside that the longest you do a build

174
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:35,411
for us 25 days a week.
Got It down to about 25 from 32 ish when

175
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:36,400
we started.

176
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,450
Uh,
so when you see a car on the show,

177
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,720
um,
if it's a single episode that we built

178
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,520
that car in 25,
26 days,

179
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,830
that's crazy.
Start to finish paint interior

180
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,240
everything.
How do you do it so quick?

181
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,550
A lot of planning and we've learned over
seven years now and 130 of them that um,

182
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,660
you know,
we've just got a process in and the crew

183
00:07:56,661 --> 00:08:00,350
that I have at the shop now is
unbelievably phenomenal and there's only

184
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:02,480
six guys doing it.
There's six guys that do it,

185
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,330
25 days we're done.
That's insane.

186
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:08,990
But what about like if you're going to
do custom suspension or you know,

187
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,480
art more Morrison Chassy or something
like that.

188
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,540
It just takes some planning.
So literally what we do is we build the

189
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,270
car three times.
This is what I tell everybody will say,

190
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:19,310
okay,
we're going to build this 68 Chevelle

191
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,130
and so we decide how we're going to
build it and what kind of parts we're

192
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,720
going to use,
what kind of suspension wheels,

193
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:24,130
motor.

194
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,690
We,
we put all that down on paper and then

195
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,600
if it works mathematically for the
project we want to do,

196
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,070
then I go find the car.
Then when I find the car,

197
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,660
we order every single part and we don't
start that car until every single thing

198
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,680
that was on that list is in house has
been checked and we're ready to go.

199
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,090
So now we've got his actual fabrication
time and human error and we're ready to

200
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:48,500
go.
Still.

201
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:51,410
Seems like such a short amount of time
and all the bills that I've seen take

202
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:52,880
seven months,
nine months,

203
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:54,980
a year.
It's just the shops are set up

204
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,390
differently.
It may be one or two guys or maybe

205
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:59,010
they've got kind of,
you know,

206
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,810
assembly programs going on or what have
you,

207
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:03,450
but we get in there like you'll love the
way we're building right now.

208
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,930
We're building a 77 international scout
and started with a really nice one.

209
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,710
Orange,
white stripes,

210
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:15,040
plaid interior.
I mean the whole ball of wax whack the,

211
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,680
the chassis out from under it put in a
full Chris Austin chassis works chassis

212
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,480
with only two wheel drive and it's all
2018 hellcat.

213
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,720
Eight speed automatic Jesus in it and
slammed on the ground,

214
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,200
but it's still removable top.
And what?

215
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,470
It was a great California truck,
I guarantee you that.

216
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,400
Oh Wow.
So you made it.

217
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,660
So you lowered it?
Yeah.

218
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:34,740
We're calling it the health gap.

219
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,750
Uh,
wow.

220
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,040
That's pretty bad ass it.
It's going to be wicked Gar.

221
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,250
Yeah.
Those a hellcat.

222
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:43,970
Chassies um,
uh,

223
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,430
Jonathan Ward,
the same guy who's doing this is who,

224
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,790
who did my bronco.
The icon there.

225
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,570
Doing that with a one of the.
I think it's a super bird.

226
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,980
One of the,
one of those iconic mopars Yep.

227
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,360
From the late sixties,
early seventies.

228
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,750
They're doing a full hellcat chassis and
the whole deal with that.

229
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,900
Oh really?
Yeah.

230
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,410
Um,
what,

231
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,560
what company was the first one to really
get stupid with these cars?

232
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,400
I guess it was Kinda corvette with the
Zr one with horsepower figures.

233
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,180
Yeah,
for sure.

234
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,990
Corvette guy stepped out there with the
CR one and started cranking it up.

235
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,820
Uh,
everybody was kind of in production.

236
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,700
You had,
you had the resurgence of shelby?

237
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,391
Yeah,
there it is.

238
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,690
There's Jonathan Wards or outlook or
that thing that's good looking.

239
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,320
That is like literally like trying to
have a block,

240
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,100
like a city block on wheels.
They take around a corner.

241
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:39,520
Look how long that got him thinking is.
Yeah,

242
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,500
that's going to be a fresh card for
sure.

243
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,840
Bad Ass.
He does some awesome shit over there

244
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:45,090
too.
He's a.

245
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:46,330
he's doing well.
He's doing one.

246
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,040
I don't think you can talk about.
I think he's.

247
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,170
He's keeping it under wraps,
but he's got a bunch of cool shit.

248
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:50,950
Yeah,
for sure.

249
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,960
He's never been there.
I have not been straight down the

250
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:53,980
street.
I know.

251
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,220
Go visit afterwards with my.
I don't think I'm going to make my

252
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:58,480
flight.
When's your flight?

253
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,110
I don't know.
I've got a couple of Martin hold notice.

254
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:05,230
I said say I got a couple on hold
because I don't think I make enough

255
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,830
money for a plane yet.
Going to talk to disco and that was like

256
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:10,120
a private plane,
is that what you're saying?

257
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,990
Yeah,
I don't.

258
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,880
I mean we're all scrambling for
something.

259
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,900
Yeah,
that's the ultimate scramble.

260
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:17,110
The private jet money,
but that,

261
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,260
that is just so much fucking money.
That seems ridiculous.

262
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,870
Yeah,
but I'd like to have a tricked out one

263
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,560
gas monkey on it.
Big Old monkey on the tail gas with a

264
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,290
keg in it somewhere.
Oh yeah,

265
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,520
for sure.
Now when you do these shows and you

266
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,180
bargain people down and then they
watched the show to people ever get

267
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:38,980
pest.
I've had a few.

268
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,020
And uh,
in the first,

269
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:44,670
uh,
first few years they were just excited,

270
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,160
you know,
that we were going to be doing something

271
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:49,840
with the car and it was always an
element of a,

272
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,690
of a sentiment to it,
you know,

273
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:55,390
it was their dads or their moms or
grandmas or whatever and they want to

274
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:58,900
see it go to a good home.
So you got several different kinds of

275
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:01,750
people.
They want you to not do anything or if

276
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:03,100
you're going to fix it up,
we want to see it,

277
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:04,840
you know,
all kinds of things like that.

278
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:09,490
But nowadays it's a little more harder
for me to get a decent deal because,

279
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,970
because we will know the success of the
show and I show up and they're like,

280
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,100
oh,
you're that guy on TV.

281
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,630
Not,
I didn't say $10,000.

282
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:17,850
I said 13.
Uh,

283
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,290
yeah.
Yeah.

284
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,570
Well I would imagine when people see
what you sell them for after you fix

285
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:24,220
them up,
then they get a little upset.

286
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,630
Yeah,
they can.

287
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,350
But I mean they don't understand the
amount of work and time and money that

288
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,820
we've put into it.
Most of the cars that we're building on

289
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:33,430
the show now,
we're putting elite 100 grand in and

290
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,590
sometimes as much as $300.
Really,

291
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,960
you know,
I mean we're building everything we're

292
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:41,800
building now.
When the new season comes out in June,

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,890
people are going to be amazed because
we're building this kind of stuff.

294
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,650
Wow.
It's wicked cool when you're doing that

295
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:48,880
in 25 days.
Yeah.

296
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,310
Fuck man.
Just put together a good plan and

297
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,420
execute it.
Well,

298
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:56,560
it must be like a thing now because the
show that people want to get a gas

299
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:58,960
monkey bill car.
They do.

300
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,220
But um,
how would I say this diplomatically?

301
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,770
If it weren't for employees,
vendors and customers,

302
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:08,650
business would be great.
So we,

303
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,370
we,
uh,

304
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,710
we don't do a lot for the,
the customer,

305
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,440
uh,
until we built it for ourselves and then

306
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:17,380
we sell it to them,
but as far as coming in off the street,

307
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,200
we just liked building what we want to
build,

308
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,160
honing our skills.

309
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,300
And then we find a buyer every once in
awhile I'll have god come in and go,

310
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:26,134
look,
I can,

311
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,790
this is what I want,
but I can,

312
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,070
I won't call you.
I won't come in there with a new

313
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:31,230
steering wheel,
you know,

314
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,010
it's like,
it gets.

315
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,990
That's why a lot of times cars do take
seven months or a year or cause the guy

316
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:40,090
that's happened,
it's built is in there every other

317
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:41,230
weekend going up.
I don't know,

318
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:43,300
maybe we move this over here and paint
it purple.

319
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh yeah,
I get it.

320
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,020
Yeah.
No,

321
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:48,940
it does seem like it would be way better
to just build it.

322
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,550
How you like it and then sell it.
Well,

323
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:53,170
yeah,
I mean it's still a business decision.

324
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:55,750
I'm trying to build it to where I think
it's gonna do the most,

325
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,600
you know,
the most money at the end of the day and

326
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:03,250
stay true with what's going on as far as
that particular car and what's going on

327
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:05,740
in the marketplace and technology and
what have you.

328
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,230
Um,
and we do get a lot of calls where

329
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:09,130
people come in and go,
okay,

330
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:12,700
I want that exact same thing and so
we'll build another one.

331
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:17,410
Well sometimes you do buy cars and then
just sell them without doing anything to

332
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:18,244
it,
right?

333
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,980
Yeah.
That's what we call our bs stories.

334
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,800
Will buy something and bring it in.
Maybe just put some wheels on it or

335
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:25,570
whatever.
But usually it's just clean it up,

336
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,390
get it running,
sell somebody else's dream because not

337
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:31,990
everybody can afford a fully built car
and slash or they want to do it

338
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:34,210
themselves.
So we get them a good project.

339
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,110
I don't think people realize how much
money is involved in a fully built car.

340
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,100
Like if you ever seen those revegy
mustangs.

341
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,760
I was looking at those last night.
It was pretty intensive build.

342
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,350
Really,
really interesting stuff.

343
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,420
Has got to take.
It's,

344
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,710
it's essentially not really a mustang.

345
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,920
I mean it's kind of licensed by Ford.
It looks exactly like a Mustang and also

346
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:59,280
a mustang parts,
but he's got everything new is just

347
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,510
brand new,
like a brand new suv.

348
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:05,960
You take the kids to soccer except
really fast and fun to drive.

349
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,610
And 19,
66,

350
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,440
65,
66.

351
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,090
He's got a GT 3:50.
That's a,

352
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,150
it's not really a 66,
GT,

353
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:16,820
3:50 every part of it.
All the fenders,

354
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,260
everything's all newly fabricated steel.
We're going to do that this season to

355
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,350
where I'm going to build a car back to
the original,

356
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,490
like a 60.
I was sad.

357
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,080
I'm going to do Mustang or if we're
going to do a Camaro,

358
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,760
but there's this guy's cars.
I mean,

359
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,670
come the fuck on.
That is beautiful.

360
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,020
Well,
we're going to build one that never

361
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:35,930
existed.
Look how pretty that God damn thing is.

362
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,300
He's killing it.
I'd want to see what one of those things

363
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:39,200
is like in real life.

364
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,180
He's even got pushed.
Buttons start,

365
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,540
you know,
um,

366
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,860
it senses when you're near the,
uh,

367
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,670
the car.
So it will unlock for you,

368
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,740
but it's the just,
it seems like super high quality built

369
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:56,300
to mean look how fucking pretty that is.
The trick is,

370
00:15:56,301 --> 00:16:01,230
is how much work goes into it because
yes they do make these parts aftermarket

371
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,070
and what have you,
but a lot of times that's not the best

372
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:06,320
stuff in the world.
So you ended up fabricating that and

373
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:08,840
massage and it in and making all the
gaps right.

374
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:13,340
And so you can't just expect that you're
going to buy a set,

375
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:15,770
a new,
a new front end it vendors and hood and

376
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:18,710
everything going to work out perfect.
You're going to always have to massage

377
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,420
it and get it right.
Well I've been paying attention to this

378
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:24,890
guy for awhile and essentially what he's
been doing is honing the process over

379
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:29,620
the last few years and he's got a
company now that makes a thing,

380
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,030
it's called dynacore that makes all the
parts.

381
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,440
They make everything in terms of like
the body's body stamps.

382
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:37,130
Yeah.
And you know,

383
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,330
he's got his whole process down,
but you know,

384
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,100
when you watch them drive the cars,
it seems like he's.

385
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,740
I mean it,
it sounds perfect,

386
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,980
like everything inside of it seems like
completely locked down.

387
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,330
No squeaks and rattles is really like a
modern car for sure.

388
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,170
And there's a lot of shops that do an
amazing job at doing that stuff.

389
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,810
That's what I like,
what I don't like.

390
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,050
I mean I liked the way they look.
If I look at like an old,

391
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:05,420
like a 67,
gt 500.

392
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:08,330
I liked the way they look,
but if you try to hit the brakes on one

393
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:11,270
of those things or if you try to make a
turn with those old tires,

394
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,710
everything's fucking that skinny and you
know,

395
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,760
the balance is all wonky.
Nineteen 67 car balance.

396
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,460
We get a lot of that.
I've built a few cars for,

397
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,540
for a contest and somebody when they're
like,

398
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,410
oh,
I want this car,

399
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,800
and then they're like,
it's,

400
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,680
this is horrible.
I'm like,

401
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,210
that's because it's a stock 65 bus thing
and what have you.

402
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:38,090
Because if you don't realize what you're
buying and then yeah,

403
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,370
it can be a disappointing process.
Yeah.

404
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:42,740
Those old cars man mean we've come a
long way.

405
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:45,410
It's,
it's pretty amazing if you go back from

406
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,250
1970 car to a 2019 car and you drive and
you hit the brakes

407
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,230
and he do all the numbers like stopping
60 to zero and handling.

408
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,230
I mean the cars of today are pretty
ridiculous.

409
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,740
It is absolutely amazing.
The technology that's out and the fact

410
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:03,840
that we can use that technology so much
easier.

411
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,920
I mean you can build these kinds of cars
or anything you dream up because you can

412
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,500
literally do it right here with your
google and your pocket.

413
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,280
Yeah.
Okay.

414
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,710
I want to do this and this and what have
you.

415
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:18,180
So it ends up being the cars that we're
putting out are definitely just like a

416
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,940
brand new car yet,
but it's a really interesting time to,

417
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:24,570
for Resto mods because so many people
are into that now.

418
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,870
They realized that they liked the looks
of those old cars,

419
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:30,300
but they're not really into the way they
drove.

420
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,390
Correct.
Everybody's about comfort and Bluetooth

421
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:35,340
and all that kind of stuff.

422
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,020
So I'm not really that way.
I'm a 32 ford nut and I kinda like cars

423
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:43,740
the way that they more or less came out.
I mean I'm all for maybe some disc

424
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:48,060
brakes or safety or whatever,
but I like the squeak it and having to

425
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:52,760
learn how to drive it and figure it out.
And the character of transmissions.

426
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,180
Exactly.
Yeah.

427
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,040
How much longer before the manuals dead?
I think it's already got the nails in

428
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,650
the coffin.
Seems like it.

429
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:01,860
But then,
you know,

430
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:04,560
like American cars,
they'll come out with cars like the GT

431
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,720
3:50.
You can't even get it with an automatic

432
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:07,830
fuck off.
Yeah.

433
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:09,550
They won't even sell it to you.
Yeah.

434
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,400
And they're going to hold on with that
as long as they can.

435
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,990
But you know,
your big competition cars,

436
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:14,010
porsche,
Ferrari,

437
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:15,540
Lambo,
Mercedes,

438
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,890
that you know,
it's,

439
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,350
you can't get them in a manual.

440
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,000
Wow.
Everybody wants that nurburgring time.

441
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,910
You know,
want that super fast nurburbring time.

442
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:26,010
And unless you have a double clutch
transmission,

443
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,980
unless you have paddle shifts,
you're going to miss a second here and

444
00:19:29,981 --> 00:19:33,630
second there and then people are gonna.
Look at it when it's so ridiculous.

445
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:37,230
The people that look at those times,
Jack is the average joe it and going out

446
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:41,120
there and doing that.
I mean the modern cars mean like the Zl

447
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:45,720
one that we were talking about earlier.
I think they're down to the one lie I

448
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:50,721
think is down to a seven minute and real
low seconds Nurburg green time,

449
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:55,620
which is fucking crazy.
That's faster than a gt three Rs from a

450
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:58,930
couple of years ago for sure.
For $60,000 car that you could buy the

451
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,450
Chevy dealership,
eh?

452
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,890
Probably close to 80,
but yeah.

453
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,930
Yeah,
I think it's like 78.

454
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,160
Okay.
Yeah.

455
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,320
But they're loaded.
But nominal car,

456
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:08,030
it's,
it's,

457
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,250
uh,
I agree that that corvette and probably

458
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,800
the demon or,
or two cars that are the most bang for

459
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:16,700
the buck.
I mean just get in and go to zero.

460
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,680
One in or the Zr one rather is almost
too stupid.

461
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,190
It's almost too ridiculous.
It seems like if you're a regular person

462
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,560
and you,
you buy that and you try to take it

463
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:28,170
somewhere for you to understand the
limits of the grip,

464
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,530
how much gas you can apply for you to
have an educated foot.

465
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,851
Yeah,
for sure.

466
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:33,240
I mean,
I,

467
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,860
I,
those where they first started making

468
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:37,380
those.
How was it seven or eight years ago?

469
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:40,260
Maybe a little longer.
I had a client have me get one.

470
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,580
He brought it back the next day scared
to death because I just sell it because

471
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,710
I'll never drive it.
He does that.

472
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,800
That is just stupid.

473
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,790
Yeah.
I saw a picture of one the other day in

474
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,710
my Google newsfeed that someone had
bought and wreck the next day.

475
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,500
Smashed it.
I was just reading today.

476
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,334
Uh,
uh,

477
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,760
somebody sent me a link.
Uh,

478
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,590
did you see the episode where we built
the [inaudible] look at that fucking.

479
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,490
It's fucking wicked.
I'm doing something with that right now

480
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:07,324
that,
uh,

481
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,680
I guess I can imagine everything you see
there,

482
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:12,610
the styling,
the,

483
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:14,560
the,
the carbon fiber points,

484
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:16,570
the lift in the front and everything
that we

485
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,870
all have it,
but we're doing it with a 72 river boat

486
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:23,770
tail.
What?

487
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,530
Yeah,
it's going to be frickin sick.

488
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,410
We've already chopped the top and
brought it down so that it doesn't have

489
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:34,411
that clam mouth and looking windshield.
And so we're taking all of the bunch of

490
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:40,261
our styling cues in our and definitely
all of our driving components ideology

491
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,040
and we're cramming it into a 72.

492
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,290
Ruby,
how has that fit?

493
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,420
Huh?
How's that going to fit?

494
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,150
Well,
we're not taking the chassis and putting

495
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:52,570
it over there and we were making our own
and we've worked with Chris Austin on it

496
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:56,620
also using that transmission,
that independent suspension.

497
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,570
Whoa.
A independent rear.

498
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,150
Got a video.
You're a faggot.

499
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,650
Isn't the 72 riviera like a million
pounds.

500
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:04,480
How much is the thing way?
It's a lot,

501
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:07,360
but we're clearing all of that out.
We're working with a speed core and

502
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:10,770
we're doing a lot of the tops going to
be carbon fiber and so will the hood

503
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,990
trunk and maybe even the full front clip
speed core did a nasty 1970 Mustang for

504
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:22,210
Robert Downey junior that I just saw
online the other day with a supercharged

505
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:26,770
coyote engine in it.
Like a weird color to like a beige,

506
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,650
like a weird kind of yellowish,
funky,

507
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,350
funky colors.
The crazier the better.

508
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,450
Yeah.
I just let it.

509
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:36,370
Like the art car is going to be like a
weird,

510
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:41,371
muted gray with a red and chrome and
Carmen and I mean we're,

511
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,010
we're getting pretty crazy with it.
We were about halfway through,

512
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,930
so it's a 72 boat tail Riviera CV and
find one of those.

513
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,240
I'm trying to picture that.
I have.

514
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:54,040
I had a riviera when I was in high
school.

515
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,770
No,
I didn't have to skylar.

516
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,390
So yeah.
Here you go.

517
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,760
Whoa.
That's a stock one.

518
00:23:00,761 --> 00:23:02,920
But then it'll turn into what?
Look at that.

519
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,690
We just started chasing it.
Yeah.

520
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,170
So that's a,
you know,

521
00:23:06,171 --> 00:23:07,600
a few people have built them into hot
rods,

522
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:10,900
but wow.
If you stay on that video,

523
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:13,300
it'll just feed to where what it's gonna
look like when it's done.

524
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,610
Oh,
I see what you did.

525
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,900
So you have.
Oh Wow.

526
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:18,700
That is crazy.
It's gonna be nuts.

527
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,510
It'll probably be at sema this year in
bare metal.

528
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,220
Whoa.
That's a beautiful car.

529
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,860
Don't have wagon wheels on it.
Like that stupid thing though.

530
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,120
Yeah.
I'm not a fan of those,

531
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,450
those uh,
that was a thing for awhile.

532
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,350
That's going to be pretty,
pretty bad ass.

533
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,110
Pretty ass.
Yeah.

534
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,970
You don't see those now.
You never see that car.

535
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,170
Like that's a rare car now.
And we found a one owner with zero hits,

536
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:45,790
zero rust.
I mean the metal launch.

537
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,090
That's perfect.
What are those Australian cars that were

538
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:49,750
in Max now?
Woo.

539
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,070
Damn.
That is going to look pretty nasty.

540
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,980
It's going to be slammed like that and
it's got to be nasty to.

541
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,680
We're probably going to bring him in for
around 1300 horsepower.

542
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,030
We're building that one just for sheer
shits and giggles of her phone because

543
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,890
nobody does that.
Well.

544
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:11,150
Someone who's going to want it for sure.
I hope they have a lot of money.

545
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,560
That's like a money pit right now.
Yeah.

546
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:17,090
How much does something like that cost
to build?

547
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,730
Three 50.
Wow.

548
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,780
Yeah.
To build.

549
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,510
And then how much would you like to make
what you want to try to.

550
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,550
I always try to make at least 20
percent.

551
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:26,570
I mean,
it's kind of a goal,

552
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,790
right?
But uh,

553
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,070
that's reasonable.
Yeah.

554
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:34,220
Especially considering all the creative
time and putting them together and yeah,

555
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:36,110
we do everything in house.
I mean it's,

556
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,660
except for interior,
we're doing every single thing in house

557
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:40,280
now.
I mean we've come a long way since the

558
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:42,380
beginning.
And when you have that kind of

559
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:44,270
horsepower,
what kind of rubber you're going to have

560
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:45,104
on that thing?

561
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,140
Oh,
it'll have 15 inches on each side.

562
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,250
It'll have,
I think we went with 24 hours and 20

563
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:54,470
twos and super,
super wide.

564
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,630
Wow.
Yeah.

565
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,660
You kind of have to.
Right.

566
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,150
And even then,
it's probably gonna spin out everywhere

567
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,670
now because we're using all the
technology,

568
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:04,340
we're using the independent suspension,
we're using all of the sensors,

569
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:09,050
all the stuff that's in that brand new
vet application control as well.

570
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,010
Wow.
How do you adapt that over to an old car

571
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,620
like that?
You just go through the systems.

572
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,140
We've got a guy working for us now that,
uh,

573
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:22,280
helped us run our standalone hill
hellcat that they said couldn't be done

574
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:25,760
when we were.
We built a sharp cat and uh,

575
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,320
so he just gets the whole thing and
starts eliminating sensors or adding or,

576
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,270
you know,
and we ended up with all the same

577
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,800
technology.
So the sensors understand when a wheel

578
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:41,801
spinning and then they compensated with
breaks or horsepower breaks,

579
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,560
you know,
they'll get your stupid stupid light,

580
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,420
you know,
you can't do that.

581
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,070
You've got.
So we'll be able to turn it all on and

582
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:50,390
off.
Just like a brand new car.

583
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,820
Oh.
So will you have different modes,

584
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,680
like a race mode,
street mode like that?

585
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:57,020
Yeah.
But what a lot of people try to do that

586
00:25:57,021 --> 00:26:00,290
I can't stand is they'll take the
something with that idea and they'll go,

587
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,000
okay,
I'm just going to pull the body off and

588
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,370
cram this under there and welded
together and hope it works.

589
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,580
And we make everything adapt to the old
car.

590
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,850
Still work though the way it's supposed
to.

591
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:12,770
And I'm brand new car.
Yeah.

592
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,850
I've seen,
you know,

593
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:15,860
there's a,
there's a guy online that has,

594
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:20,480
I'm on instagram gt 500 super swap.
He took a,

595
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,870
an old gt 500 body and put it on a gt
500 from a modern chassis and piece it

596
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:30,350
together like that.
But I was always thinking with a,

597
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:33,140
with a setup like that,
you probably can't have airbags,

598
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,023
right?

599
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,080
You can.
There's actually ways to added into

600
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:38,440
there.
But you get into the air.

601
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:39,320
It is,
yeah.

602
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,980
You get into the geometry,
uh,

603
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,560
in the direction of the airbag.
So beautiful.

604
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,640
That looks so.
Yeah.

605
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:49,060
But you don't want to play with the R
and d of trying to put an airbag into

606
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,340
something like that unless you really,
really know what you're doing because

607
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,100
you don't know refraction of an inch off
of,

608
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,860
of being where it needs to be.
That airbag could do more damage than

609
00:26:58,861 --> 00:27:01,800
good it.
It's weird though because you're dealing

610
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:05,220
with a totally different size body too.
So I wonder how he's doing this.

611
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,460
It's easy isn't.
It?

612
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,300
Doesn't sound easy,
but it is,

613
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,610
isn't really.
Have you done that before?

614
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:12,870
We haven't,
but I,

615
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,000
I,
I understand the process and really it's

616
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,070
just got massage,
move in,

617
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:17,980
move out,
you know,

618
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,160
because there's a company called Mag
Motors.

619
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,750
You ever heard of them?
I don't think I have.

620
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,210
Go to a MAG motors.com.
They have a.

621
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,320
What they're doing is they're putting a
carbon fiber body on a modern gt 500,

622
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,440
but they're using a 67 like eleanor
body,

623
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,540
but they're making it out of carbon
fiber.

624
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,400
So it's a.
That one's gross.

625
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,690
Go to the silver.
One white one looks to hate the eleanor

626
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:44,880
body.
So you're really overplayed.

627
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,040
How dare you?
It's just,

628
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,750
it's just been done so many times,
but who cares?

629
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,450
It's amazing.
Yeah.

630
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,481
Go.
Yeah,

631
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:52,500
that's,
those are the images,

632
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:54,900
but go to get it,
get it from the side so you get a better

633
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:57,300
look at it.
That's a beautiful car.

634
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,500
See?
To me it sits weird.

635
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,370
It looks like it sits a little too high
and it looks like they're worried,

636
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,000
like I don't know anything about them,
but to me looking at it it's like you

637
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:09,180
need to get it down a little bit,
get a little more agitated,

638
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:10,740
get a deeper dish on the wheel.

639
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,320
Um,
well I think what they're doing is

640
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:16,950
trying to use all the geometry of the
modern car.

641
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,390
Correct.
So you ended up with something.

642
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:23,160
It looks like it could go four wheeling
a little bit,

643
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,690
right?
Yeah,

644
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,550
it's not,
it's definitely not slammed.

645
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,700
Yeah.
In terms of looks right.

646
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,670
Yes.
I mean I'm sure the car runs and drives

647
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:36,480
and performs unbelievably,
but it's missing a little to me it's

648
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,000
missing some.
Um,

649
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,320
you know that our company,
classic recreation's never seen them.

650
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,630
No,
I don't think so.

651
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,700
They do.
They're doing similar cars like that

652
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:47,190
too.
But they're doing it from the ground up.

653
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,930
There's a lot of people doing it because
it's with technology coming the way that

654
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:52,740
it has,
it's,

655
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,120
it's not as hard to do as it used to be.
Um,

656
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,290
it's still the laborer's task,
don't get me wrong,

657
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:01,350
but you know,
you can make all those systems work in

658
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:04,080
anything and see a guy like you that's a
car guy.

659
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,990
You look at an eleanor and you look at
it like it's played,

660
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,440
but a person who doesn't see them all
the time,

661
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:13,650
it was not in a car industry.
When was the last time you saw one of

662
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,240
those fucking things on the street?
Shit,

663
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:17,700
I would never say Jackson.
There was like five of them for sale.

664
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,620
That's the thing if you go there,
but like fusion motorsports there,

665
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,100
there are down the street here.
They make,

666
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,240
they're the only licensed dealers.
They have some deal with the woman who

667
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:31,440
was the,
she was the wife of the guy who wrote,

668
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:33,780
gone in 60 seconds or producing or
something like that.

669
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:37,740
And so they make a car,
go to fusion.

670
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,570
Eleanor.
They make some pretty sick once.

671
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,360
But you think there's a plate out
personally?

672
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:45,430
Yeah.
I'm just not an eleanor car fan.

673
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,280
That is fucking beautiful.
Why do you hate America?

674
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,500
Richard?
How could you,

675
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,160
how could you not love that?
It's just there's hundreds if not

676
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:56,290
thousands of them out there.
Come on,

677
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:57,430
Bro.
You must say to America,

678
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,390
no way,
man.

679
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,910
Currently,
and I love the mustangs.

680
00:30:00,911 --> 00:30:02,620
I've got three of them,
myself included,

681
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,640
a real 68 shelby.
But uh,

682
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,710
um,
is it the shape or the color scheme?

683
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,030
I think it's the shape.
I mean,

684
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,450
to me it's,
it's such a popular car in the movie

685
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:14,320
that,
you know,

686
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,680
too many people did it and now
everybody's doing it and it's what have

687
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,170
you.
Yeah.

688
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:21,760
But I mean,
how many of them are out there in

689
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:26,750
comparison to like say a modern Zr One?
It was probably nearly as many of those

690
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,490
thousands of those.
I think so,

691
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,020
yeah.
There's different companies making tons

692
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:35,980
of them all car people say that they say
to cars that they think are played out

693
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:40,030
69 Camaro's and these things,
like everybody does a 69 Camaro and

694
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:40,510
everybody does.

695
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,480
Eleanor and the,
um,

696
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,410
the dukes of hazzard card.
Oh yeah.

697
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,490
Same thing.
Yeah.

698
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,190
Now a bad ass 69 charger.
Don't get me wrong,

699
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,910
but painted orange with a flag on top.
That's played out.

700
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,410
You can't do that anymore.
That flag.

701
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:56,860
It's fucking
for sure.

702
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,430
You believe they pulled that show off?
The air did?

703
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,020
Yes.
Because the flag that shows off the

704
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,400
showed on like some weird obscure cable.
Jim pulled it off a TV land.

705
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,610
That's TV land.
I wrote a whole thing about it on

706
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:11,860
Instagram,
how ridiculous it was and I don't know

707
00:31:11,861 --> 00:31:15,700
if I agree with that.
I mean it's like trying to erase history

708
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:16,760
or whatever.
Yeah.

709
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,790
Yeah.
Well you live in Dallas though.

710
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,780
It's a little easier to get by with a
confederate flag and towels.

711
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,760
Oh yeah.
We don't have a bunch of Matcha tea

712
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,990
drinkers and what have you like we do
out here in California.

713
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,550
I,
I,

714
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,630
you know,
living in Dallas,

715
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:36,460
I have to do my business with the people
out here in La and it's,

716
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,770
you know,
I'm getting off work before they've had

717
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:42,220
their two chai lattes and walk their dog
and showed up to the office.

718
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,620
I'm like,
come on guys,

719
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,540
get up and get to work and I get accused
of like,

720
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,740
have you been drinking?
And I'm like,

721
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,810
yeah,
it's 7:30 in the night here.

722
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,050
I've been off for two and a half hours.
People get upset at you if you've been

723
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:56,790
drinking?
No,

724
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,620
when I'm trying to conduct some of the
business calls that we do in the

725
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:01,960
evenings because they haven't gotten to
work yet.

726
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,510
And they asked you if you've actually
been drinking sometimes.

727
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,720
Really?
Well she's.

728
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,780
Because they know you from the show.
Well we all,

729
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,350
I'm talking about my agents and managers
networks and whatever.

730
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:12,460
I'm like,
yeah,

731
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,130
because I've been off since 5:00 eyes.

732
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,690
Most people have a couple beers and sit
around the shop.

733
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,230
Well,
most people there.

734
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

735
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,950
It's a different world out here.
A little bit of a culture shock.

736
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,360
It is A.
I don't,

737
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,680
I don't know.
I mean,

738
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,030
I like it.
It's okay,

739
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:31,100
but I think if I was going to move a gas
monkey anywhere,

740
00:32:31,101 --> 00:32:34,120
it would probably be Scottsdale.
Scottsdale is nice.

741
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:37,150
It's freaking cool.
It's about a million degrees in the

742
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,650
summer though.
You ever go there?

743
00:32:38,651 --> 00:32:42,120
But it's a dry heat and
sauna.

744
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,120
It's fucking preposterous.
We went outside.

745
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:49,010
I was in the,
it was in Phoenix last July and we went

746
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:50,800
outside.
We just stood there for a second.

747
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:51,510
Oh,
this is.

748
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,850
This is ridiculous.
We should get used to this because this

749
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:56,900
is what global warming is going to be
like an la a few years.

750
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,120
Yeah.
You guys are going to either be on fire

751
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:02,150
from the,
from the volcanoes or global warming or

752
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:06,190
whatever or sliding into the ocean,
but I really like Scottsdale.

753
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:10,190
Fun Fact.
Next week they have any plan in the

754
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,460
Scottsdale opening,
the Waste Management Open in the

755
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:15,170
celebrity program.
Oh yeah.

756
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,500
Do you golf?
I absolutely suck at it horribly.

757
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,550
I've been a member of the same country
club for about 19 years and I probably

758
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:25,820
played about 50 rounds of golf in my
life and they've caught me playing in

759
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:30,620
the pro am the celebrity thing and
unlike we've ever gets teamed out with

760
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:33,470
me as in big trouble.
You're going to tighten up before you

761
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:34,940
go.
Are you going to take some lessons or

762
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:35,930
anything?
No Way,

763
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,620
man.
I'm sweating because.

764
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,890
Because the way I look at it as,
oh,

765
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:42,050
I'm going to do.
Then it's like be pissed off that I

766
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:46,070
can't do what the guy told me to do.
You're going to get much better.

767
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,510
And then it's like what I tell them on
it,

768
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:49,250
but on top of that is I'm like,
okay,

769
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,860
you think you're so good at golf because
you can shoot 72,

770
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,060
you know,
or whatever.

771
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,550
Well,
mathematically this is an 18 shot game,

772
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,440
right?
You can figure it out mathematically.

773
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,590
Yeah.
I mean if you had some insane ability.

774
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,960
Well yeah,
but you don't have to have in st ability

775
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,930
to figure out the mathematics of it.
So because it's an 18 shot game guys,

776
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,530
but no one's ever done that.
So how is it an 18 child game?

777
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:19,160
Just mathematically
is a one punch fight?

778
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,121
Well,
no,

779
00:34:20,121 --> 00:34:24,620
it's more like saying that because more
fights are one punch fights than ever.

780
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,790
A golf game is an 18 shot golf game.
I'm saying mathematically propulsion

781
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,070
direction,
etc. And so forth.

782
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,790
You cAn get that ball from that spot to
that whole thing every time it's

783
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,800
possible with enough power,
right?

784
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,470
Yeah.
But in what have you.

785
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,890
But that's literally like saying every
fight is a one shot fight.

786
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,240
No way.
Why?

787
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,800
Because a lot of fights are one shot
fights,

788
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:50,180
but there's never been an 18 hole game
that's played with 18 shots,

789
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,320
but there are whole ones.

790
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:55,430
So all you need is never happened.
That was of the human race.

791
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,220
I think the most I've ever done in an
actual real tournament is to.

792
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,820
Someone's done to I think somebody down.
I'd have to look it up.

793
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:03,560
But uh,
Yeah.

794
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,020
So one shot fight,
they'd probably be,

795
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,570
you fighting me,
you just hit me and I'd go down.

796
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:13,430
There's been quite a few in the that
I've called one punch and the beginning

797
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:14,270
of the fight,
bam,

798
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:17,330
someone gets hit and they go down at
least three or four in the history of

799
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:20,000
the fai.
Duane ludwig like six seconds.

800
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:21,290
First.
First punch you through.

801
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,170
That probably made me.
We already talked about working out.

802
00:35:24,171 --> 00:35:27,950
So you're not to go down pretty quick.
I can't believe you've never worked out

803
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:29,450
ever in your life.
I really haven't.

804
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,570
I mean I'm just thinking about starting
more,

805
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:35,360
like just cardio and stuff.
I turned 50 in two months so

806
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,180
you know,
I am a little bit.

807
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,090
It's weird number,
right?

808
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,820
It's a weird number.
plus I look at my dad and you know,

809
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:44,920
he's 23 years old than me and I'm like,
god,

810
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,260
I got 20 years left.
holy shit.

811
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,780
Yeah.
Well working out definitely holds off

812
00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:53,910
the grim reaper a little bit.
Oh yeah.

813
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,460
It keeps your body working better,
but it takes effort.

814
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,960
You got to be willing to do it.
Well,

815
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,010
like I said,
I just hope things work out.

816
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:04,440
Just hire a hot trainer.
Hire a chick that's going to you.

817
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,540
You'll be motivated.
Who are embarrassed,

818
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,380
you'll be embarrassed and that will get
you motivated.

819
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,190
is chicks like looking at me going,
what is wrong with you,

820
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,000
man?
Are you kind of man?

821
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,380
That is some embarrassing shit.
What a chicken lift more than you.

822
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,130
Yeah,
well I'm sure there's a lot of.

823
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,090
Oh,
there's a lot of them.

824
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:25,500
There's a lot of them around the block.

825
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,610
Yeah.
Well,

826
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:30,180
right around the corner is a giant
fucking bodybuilding gym for chicks,

827
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,540
for guys,
for everybody.

828
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,880
Right.
It's just savages.

829
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,730
I dunno.
I like an athletic build on and grow,

830
00:36:38,731 --> 00:36:41,540
but I don't know if I want her to have
giant muscles and yeah,

831
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:43,890
there's a,
there's a point I wanted to take bigger

832
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:46,490
crunches than me.
Yeah,

833
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,050
there's a,
there's a point where it gets creepy.

834
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,170
There's like,
um,

835
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,090
yeah,
rollover,

836
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,220
holding her from behind little spoon and
I'm like,

837
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,280
oh,
this set you joe veins,

838
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:01,440
right?
Like veiny forearms on chicks.

839
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:04,350
Like something about some,
about like veiny chest,

840
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,320
like a girl with a veiny veiny pecs.
Yeah.

841
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,243
No,
no,

842
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,840
it's,
it's a mistake.

843
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,310
They're not supposed to have pecs
anyways.

844
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,330
Just that boobs.
Yeah.

845
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,990
But they have boobs combined with pack,
so that's where it gets real weird when

846
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:18,540
they have fake boobs,
but they also have back muscles and you

847
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,280
can feel the muscles underneath the fake
boob.

848
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,160
Like this water balloon that's floating
on top of his cgu.

849
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,280
Yeah,
that's too crazy.

850
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,450
That's one thing I do like about
California.

851
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:30,961
You know,
the,

852
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:33,330
uh,
the southern California little blonde

853
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:36,780
with all the tattoos and you know it.
A little bikini on the beach.

854
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:38,640
One ab.
You take out those in Texas though?

855
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,740
Not as many.
They don't.

856
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,491
Yeah,
we got them,

857
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:44,850
but not as many.
I'm on instagram too much.

858
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,910
it seems like every girl from Texas on
instagram has tattoos all over the

859
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:52,080
place.
Yeah.

860
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:53,460
But that's,
you know,

861
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:55,280
there's 20 of them.
Not 100,

862
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:56,443
right?
Yeah.

863
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,540
Out here,
this thousands.

864
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,030
They're everywhere.
Go to like venice Beach.

865
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,850
It's hard to find a girl doesn't have a
tattoo that's unique these days.

866
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,460
That's a real rebel.
Yeah.

867
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:09,000
Girl with no piercings and no tattoos.
It's either rebel or boring.

868
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:15,710
Probably both.
She's rebelling against being exciting.

869
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,970
I think the girl bodybuilder though,
what happens is people get into

870
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:23,850
something and they forget how weird it
is for everybody else.

871
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,010
So as they get deeper and deeper into
it,

872
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:29,460
they just want to excel at it and they
want to lift more weights and you know,

873
00:38:29,461 --> 00:38:32,700
they're trying to put more on the squat
rack or they're dead lift in their neck

874
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:33,540
gets big.
And,

875
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,680
and,
and uh,

876
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:36,010
I had

877
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,500
a girl that worked for me for a long
time that was real into.

878
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:39,750
She was like this.
Uh,

879
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,170
I don't know what competition she does,
But it was body sculpting and stuff at

880
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,170
this girls over there measuring florets
of broccoli or to scale.

881
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,740
That's when they fucked up.
One little.

882
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,230
Oops.
Yeah.

883
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,380
Once they start measuring their food and
counting their macros,

884
00:38:56,381 --> 00:39:00,160
like settled down,
once you're in some gigantic

885
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:02,020
competition.
Cheers.

886
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,110
Cheers sir.
Fixing breakout some tequila for you in

887
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:06,940
a minute.
Break it out,

888
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:07,870
man.
We have cups.

889
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,960
Oh yeah.
you brought cups to list.

890
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,370
This guy comes prepared.
Oh,

891
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,000
you have gas monkey tequila.
get the fuck outta here.

892
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:17,530
You got your own tequila.
Dude,

893
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:20,100
can I get a gas monkey tee shirt?
You have one I brought you on.

894
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,020
I fucking love that logo.
I got some of this crap down here.

895
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:28,120
Did I put one on right now?
I don't give a fuck to look at that.

896
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,670
Ooh,
got a couple of them here.

897
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,780
That jamie.
Huh?

898
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,470
Nice.
Cool.

899
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,650
Yeah.
You guys have like a whole apparel line.

900
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:48,220
Do we have everything?
I mean we've got tools.

901
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:50,410
We've got.
I saw a bathmat the other day at like

902
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:53,070
home goods or something and I'm like,
I don't even remember it.

903
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:56,200
Proven that
is it for sure.

904
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:59,680
Yours.
it's a licensed product.

905
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,320
Well that's part of the thing,
right?

906
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:05,050
You guys came up with a cool logo.
Yeah.

907
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:06,460
ANd the monkeys,
you knoW,

908
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:11,020
he's that lovable character that's also
a pain in the ass and kind of in there

909
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:14,130
messing stuff up all the time.
But you can't shoot him because he's

910
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,550
just,
that's what he does.

911
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,090
And What happened.
So we did the gas monkey sentiment

912
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:20,190
tequila.
This is a,

913
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,570
it's cinnamon.
Yeah,

914
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,950
it's a 100 percent blue.
A gavi.

915
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,400
Just swirled with a little bit of
cinnamon and nice.

916
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:31,450
My kids got a soccer game after this.
I'm going to be fucked up time.

917
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,250
Well salou,
it's good way to get through the game.

918
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:34,120
Yeah,
for sure.

919
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,360
That's actually good.
It's good stuff.

920
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,840
Don't tell I'm ron white,
but I think your tequila is better.

921
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,750
He'll get mad.
You get mad at me.

922
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,170
He loves his tequila.
We came up with this because this is the

923
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,900
only tequila over finances made in
America.

924
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,160
Really?
Because you have to do sco,

925
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,300
you know,
real blue golf.

926
00:40:57,301 --> 00:41:02,301
A tequila is always at your America from
elise co to get around that.

927
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,700
I ship it in and tankers and then I do
it here.

928
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,470
So we're switching built.
Our distributors are just distillers

929
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:16,210
right now and will be made in Texas.
So you can't grow it in America.

930
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:18,880
You can't grow the economy in America.
You could,

931
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:21,940
but a real tequila just like champagne
in France,

932
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,940
you know,
real tequila is always from elise go

933
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:28,960
area and what have you.
How weird is that?

934
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,250
It's like burgundy,
right?

935
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,740
These from your burrito burrito.

936
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,790
Exactly.
But uh,

937
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,190
that didn't,
that's funny.

938
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:37,720
I didn't,
I,

939
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,290
I kinda,
I guess I kind of knew that.

940
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,570
I didn't think about that.
That's weird.

941
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,660
Can make anywhere.
We're literally sold out right now

942
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,070
worldwide.
Yeah,

943
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,060
I took it to the troops.
We went and did a deal with the px

944
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:55,061
exchanges on all the bases in the world
and they wiped me out and so we're

945
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,600
having to make it right now.
We're completely sold out everywhere.

946
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,270
That's fucking great.
I had to borrow a couple of bottles from

947
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:05,540
somebody with hoarding them.
That is a fucking dope logo though.

948
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,480
That monkey with the tongue hanging out
that you have that on the outside of

949
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:10,460
your garage.
You get a bunch of looky loos and find

950
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,750
out where you guys are.
Oh,

951
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:13,690
we do it on purpose.
We've got a little spot where people

952
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,840
come by and see the cars.

953
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,270
We've got a building there and then
we've got a a merch shop,

954
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:21,260
and inside the mertz shop you can go in
the back and there's like a party area

955
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:23,450
where you can have a,
don't sell beer or alcohol,

956
00:42:23,451 --> 00:42:27,380
but you can have a gas monkey energy
drink or water and that will be like

957
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:32,381
you're in the experience and you let
people just come on down and say hi,

958
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,670
get dressed.
Yeah.

959
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,170
Now everybody can come out.
There's probably were on earth camera

960
00:42:39,171 --> 00:42:40,280
right now.
Pull up earth cam,

961
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:42,500
gas monkey.
We can see how many people are there.

962
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,900
Do you get stopped by weirdos because of
the tv show?

963
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:45,920
Oh yeah,
yeah,

964
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,680
yeah.
You know what really freaking sucks in

965
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:50,030
Texas.
This is no bullshit.

966
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:52,550
I didn't find this out until we got
random.

967
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:56,810
What really sucks.
Somebody comes on my property and

968
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:59,990
they're weird and I got to tell them to
leave or they're aggressive or whatever

969
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,930
and I'll get the hell off the property.

970
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:08,050
Get out of bed for the next 24 hours.
I'm responsible for them if they like,

971
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:13,430
if they leave and get run over at the
corner or whatever because I made them

972
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:15,650
leave.
I forced them from the property.

973
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,090
They're my responsibility.
What?

974
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,500
It fucking sucks.
So if a guy shows up drunk and you say,

975
00:43:21,501 --> 00:43:23,060
hey man,
you gotta get the fuck out of here,

976
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,190
and the guy leaves and gets in a car
accident,

977
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,240
he could say,
hey,

978
00:43:26,241 --> 00:43:29,490
they made me leave.
Yeah.

979
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,280
You know,
so the drunk ones,

980
00:43:31,281 --> 00:43:33,650
I'll put them in an uber,
but I'm talking about just the crazy

981
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:34,670
ones.
You know,

982
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,390
we've got a homeless problem in dallas.
It's starting to get to be about as big

983
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:41,330
as you guys are having here.
And they'll wonder onto property and

984
00:43:41,331 --> 00:43:41,721
were like,
hey,

985
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:44,890
you got to beat it.
And then if they go down the street and

986
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,130
gets hit,
yeah,

987
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,890
I'm responsible for their medical bills
can be.

988
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,350
It's the stupidest freaking law and the
planet.

989
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,970
What waS that like a hospitality law,
like what's,

990
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,610
I don't sell alcohol,
but it's because I'm a business and I've

991
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,660
made them leave.
They came to see me and I made them

992
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:01,520
leave.
They didn't leave on their own accord,

993
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,020
so we have to call the cops to get them
to carry those people out.

994
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,700
That's so weird.
I went to jay leno's garage and he's

995
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:10,610
telling me that,
uh,

996
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,230
you know,
jay leno's garage,

997
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,710
not jay leno's garage.
Jaylin was 11 garages.

998
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,280
Oh,
I know.

999
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,230
I've been there.
I've done the jay leno show.

1000
00:44:18,231 --> 00:44:20,390
It's written daisy.
I mean,

1001
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:23,570
I knew that guy was a car nut,
but I didn't know the magnitude until

1002
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:25,730
you go and you see these 11 warehouse
buildings,

1003
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,410
just full,
full cars.

1004
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,720
He's got a real problem now.
He's got a great problem.

1005
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:32,880
He's a great problem.

1006
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,550
I'm only up to two buildings.
I need to start adding buildings.

1007
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:37,840
How many cars do you personally own?
Um,

1008
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:41,730
iT's hard to answer because I've owned
gas monkey and so we have inventory.

1009
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,530
I have to,
I tell everybody,

1010
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:48,531
I usually keep between 50 and 60 cars
that are yours that are sort of for

1011
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:50,130
sale,
you know?

1012
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:52,380
So there's some comes along,
man,

1013
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:53,480
I need that car.
and you're like,

1014
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,920
there's a map,
there's about 10 that I won't sell,

1015
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,480
period.
What won't you sell?

1016
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,780
I won't sell my thomas crown affair
mustang shelby a couple.

1017
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,860
What Is that?
A year?

1018
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,140
60 eight.
You could probably find a picture of

1019
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:08,160
that on the net,
but it's a,

1020
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,880
it's a remake of the one they used in
thomas crown affair with pierce bronson

1021
00:45:11,881 --> 00:45:13,860
when he's on the Island and it's got all
the.

1022
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,120
I never saw that moment.
It's all lifted on bf goodrich.

1023
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:20,220
Never seen appears bronson movie a dude.
Thomas crown affair is a remake of

1024
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:22,970
another thomas crown affair movie.
And uh,

1025
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,380
uh,
the mustangs just wicked cool.

1026
00:45:25,381 --> 00:45:28,020
So I had a client,
a friend of mine had me build it for

1027
00:45:28,021 --> 00:45:29,010
him,
good friend.

1028
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,400
and I wanted the car.
Of course I couldn't afford it then.

1029
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:36,810
We didn't even have the tv show yet.
And so I built in this perfect

1030
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,630
rendition.
60 eight shelby convertible mustang.

1031
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,030
Put bf goodrich is on it,
raised it all up high.

1032
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,680
I mean it's perfect California cruiser.
And uh,

1033
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,820
then when I got the show I call him up
and I go,

1034
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,350
hey,
can I borrow the car buddy?

1035
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,400
Cause I want stuff sitting around the
shop that,

1036
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:54,030
that I built.
I don't want other people'S stuff here.

1037
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:54,871
He goes,
oh yeah,

1038
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:56,370
man.
Just sit in the truck down to pick it

1039
00:45:56,371 --> 00:45:57,204
up.

1040
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,990
This is three years later.
I send the truck down.

1041
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,250
It gets back.
The cars got 42 miles on it.

1042
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,710
It's been sitting there doing nothing in
his garage.

1043
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,560
He's down in new orleans,
so it's got some of that haze and shIt

1044
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:11,070
from the salt air and gas is there.
It is.

1045
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,410
The gas is bad.
Oh wow.

1046
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:15,450
That is really high.
It looks like you're going four wheeling

1047
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:18,030
in that fucking thing.
What is going on with the tire on the

1048
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:19,710
trunk?
That's the spare.

1049
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,640
Um,
I know,

1050
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:23,340
but it's,
that's an odd placement.

1051
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,650
That's just how it wasn't a movie.
Really?

1052
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:26,910
Yeah.
Wow.

1053
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:27,930
And uh,
god,

1054
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,130
leah,
my fat there are.

1055
00:46:29,131 --> 00:46:30,420
What is that?
You?

1056
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,740
I don't know.
I don't know.

1057
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:35,820
That's not the one I built that,
that's another guys car.

1058
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,880
So I'm just not quite right.
Mine is more absolutely perfect to the

1059
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:44,070
movie.
That's somebody else's rendition of it.

1060
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,480
Um,
but anyways,

1061
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:46,291
I called my buddy,
I go,

1062
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:47,760
let me borrow the car,
et cetera.

1063
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:50,910
It gets there with 42 miles on it after
three years it doesn't run.

1064
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,300
The gas Is bad.
Carpenters all fucked off and of course

1065
00:46:54,301 --> 00:46:56,880
I called him and go,
you're really shitty car owner.

1066
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,980
I said,
this thing is freaking bad ass.

1067
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,860
Look what you've done to it.
Well,

1068
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,190
he has a considerable amount of money,
so the next day the title shows up in

1069
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:06,420
the mail and he goes,
you're right.

1070
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,940
I'm a shitty car owner.
Chairs.

1071
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:11,430
He gave it to you.
Jesus christ.

1072
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,090
It helps to have a close friends that
have a lot of cash.

1073
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,750
Massage,
obviously like you to god.

1074
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:19,750
We're real good friends.
He's.

1075
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,150
He's a.
He's a bad motherfucker.

1076
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,470
Well,
I want to see what it actually looks

1077
00:47:22,471 --> 00:47:25,230
like without the fat guy driving.
No disrespect fat guy.

1078
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,240
Yeah,
looking at it Because I could see where

1079
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,020
if you don't work out at all,
how do you stay thin?

1080
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,560
Because you're a thin guy.
I got.

1081
00:47:33,561 --> 00:47:35,410
It's just metabolism.
I do eat right.

1082
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,630
I don't eat fast food,
but you drink.

1083
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,450
I don't do sodas.
I haven't done sodas or anything like

1084
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:45,250
that and two decades.
And how often do you drink every day?

1085
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,330
DoeSn't that cancel out all the uh,
no.

1086
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:50,980
Sodas?
I don't know.

1087
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,260
I mean maybe it says it doesn't have as
much sugar,

1088
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:56,650
but you must have like a beer drinkers
metabolism.

1089
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,790
You just,
you know how to do it.

1090
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:58,751
Yeah.
It's,

1091
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,000
it takes a lot of practice to get to
this point.

1092
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,150
Your body's ready.
I'm ready to go the fuck to do.

1093
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,290
I was like a marathon runner.
Like everybody can't run fucking 15

1094
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,780
miles a day with someone who runs 50
miles a day.

1095
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,950
Can do it.
Yeah.

1096
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,440
I,
I,

1097
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,380
there's,
that's one thing that's just monotonous

1098
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:16,360
to me running my,
uh,

1099
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,540
my wife's a runner and a,
I'm like,

1100
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:21,310
that's just silly.

1101
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,740
Like why do you want to get out and go
run 20 miles?

1102
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:29,230
I don't run 20 miles,
but I run hills a run for four is the

1103
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:32,410
most I run,
but I run like pretty steep hills.

1104
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:37,411
There's your car,
is that the one that's the same fat guy

1105
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:38,590
right there,
jamie.

1106
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:42,010
There's a couple versions of it and a
lot of the websites are pulling.

1107
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,870
Dropped down to the one right below
that.

1108
00:48:43,871 --> 00:48:46,420
Where your cursor that there is,
that's the real one.

1109
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:47,560
It's that one right there.
Yeah,

1110
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:51,490
that's a not zero and yeah,
it was a nice car.

1111
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:55,600
It's so much fun and I a bang in stupid
sound system in it.

1112
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:58,420
So you know,
it'd be borrowed the whole deal.

1113
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,370
It'd be a great carter cruise around
California.

1114
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,780
What kind of engines you put in that
thing?

1115
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:05,080
Just the typical small buckets of gt
3:50.

1116
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,920
So it's got a small block,
three or two and um,

1117
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,930
what have you.
it's a pretty fun time.

1118
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:13,720
We get to a lot of heads.
And then we were talking about cars.

1119
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:15,640
I wouldn't say I got that.
I got a 52 fleet line.

1120
00:49:15,641 --> 00:49:18,580
That was the first car we ever built as
gas monkey garage.

1121
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,410
What does a fleet land?
I don't even know what that is.

1122
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,390
It's a,
you can type in 52.

1123
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:24,790
Fleet line gas monkey.
It's a,

1124
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:29,260
the fastback version of [inaudible].
Fifty two chevy kinda has the slope

1125
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:31,360
back.
Some people call it a torpedo back.

1126
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,030
A look at that thing.
Yeah.

1127
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:36,380
The not that one.
The picture on the far corner.

1128
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:38,170
Yeah.
That's us.

1129
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,920
And uh,
it's all patina it out and kind of,

1130
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,061
you know.
Oh,

1131
00:49:42,061 --> 00:49:43,600
so you kept it like that?
Yeah.

1132
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:47,100
That was the original body.
We chopped it though and it's got a,

1133
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,360
uh,
people love that.

1134
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:53,890
Like the original patina it out body,
like I'm icon does that,

1135
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:55,990
they call them derelicts.
That's a good picture of the car.

1136
00:49:55,991 --> 00:49:56,470
Yeah,
yeah,

1137
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:56,730
yeah,
yeah.

1138
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:00,010
Derelicts.
And then we got a lead ops we have,

1139
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,730
I got my first car I ever bought.
I won't sell that as part as the first

1140
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,590
one I ever bought for me.
What is it?

1141
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,221
Five,
nine,

1142
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:08,020
nine gtb 2009.
Oh,

1143
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,120
that's a nice car.
Super good car.

1144
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,820
And uh,
you know,

1145
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,860
then I had a couple of other friends but
I'd probably sell those,

1146
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:17,560
but that one first one just probably
never will.

1147
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,650
And just because it's like a benchmark,
like you,

1148
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:25,360
I'm a big proponent and believer in
forcing yourself,

1149
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,450
you know,
and so forth sell it to,

1150
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,950
to want more to do more,
to,

1151
00:50:29,951 --> 00:50:32,690
to give yourself motivation.
A lot of people just save and save and

1152
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:34,010
save and I'm more like,
okay,

1153
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:37,550
I'm going to do something that I
probably shouldn't do right now so that

1154
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:39,860
I know I got to work hard to make sure I
don't have to give it up.

1155
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,070
I'm wiTh you.
Yeah,

1156
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,760
that's me.
I talk my friends into that shit.

1157
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:46,400
I talked to my friend tony into buying a
corvette when he can't afford it.

1158
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,220
Taught my friend brendan and about a gt
three rs.

1159
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:51,200
So it's the same thing.
I mean,

1160
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:53,210
I bought the car when I probably
shouldn't,

1161
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,910
but the show was going and I was like,
this will make me work hard on this,

1162
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:58,340
you know,
it sits in the corner when I'm doing it.

1163
00:50:58,341 --> 00:50:59,840
I get up in the morning,
I look at it,

1164
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,940
I got it.
I got to make sure that I can afford

1165
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:03,770
that,
so let's go do it too.

1166
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:06,650
And I believe in that wholeheartedly and
people say you're ridiculous.

1167
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:07,484
And I go,
yeah,

1168
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:08,750
yeah,
exactly.

1169
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:09,591
Well,
when I was young,

1170
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:11,710
I was a.
When I first got into printing and

1171
00:51:11,711 --> 00:51:14,630
advertising at shit,
I could barely make rent.

1172
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,890
I think I was buying my suits it,
you know,

1173
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,950
a resell shop,
but I would go to neiman's and look

1174
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,470
around and you know,
and,

1175
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,290
and think about what I was going to buy
it.

1176
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,520
Just putting the motivation in my head,
you know,

1177
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:27,980
I guess there's a big movement now with
making your imagination board or

1178
00:51:27,981 --> 00:51:28,814
whatever.
Well,

1179
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,050
those people are assholes.
Yeah.

1180
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:34,220
My shit just wanted to reel in your head
that I had that vision board.

1181
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,070
I get it.
If you're 20 and you're doing that,

1182
00:51:37,071 --> 00:51:39,080
you don't know any better.
My vision boards,

1183
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:41,350
you know,
the old poster of the rock band with his

1184
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:45,830
weed and you know,
it looks like a great mission.

1185
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,720
Yeah.
That's the real vision board.

1186
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,920
I,
yeah.

1187
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,160
I,
I'm a big believer in doing this is what

1188
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:56,090
I say to someone who can buy.
If you can actually buy a ferrari.

1189
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:57,141
I'm like,
listen man,

1190
00:51:57,141 --> 00:51:59,360
if you don't,
who will,

1191
00:51:59,361 --> 00:52:02,000
if you're an 18 year old kid and you got
no money,

1192
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,050
and he said,
man,

1193
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:06,170
find enough to buy a ferrari.
Oh god,

1194
00:52:06,171 --> 00:52:08,420
I'd be so happy I'd buy that thing.
Well,

1195
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:10,550
you should do it if you can.
You can.

1196
00:52:10,551 --> 00:52:11,840
You should do it.
And is it,

1197
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,030
is it too much money?
Yeah,

1198
00:52:13,031 --> 00:52:14,510
it's,
it's definitely too much money.

1199
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,120
That's part of the whole part point of
the whole thing.

1200
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,220
Correct?
Yeah,

1201
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,103
it's,
it's.

1202
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:21,260
To me,
I use it more as motivation.

1203
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,300
I know,
can I afford this?

1204
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:24,620
And then if you.
If terrell chef.

1205
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:25,071
No,
you go,

1206
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:29,120
well then I'm going to.
I'm going to afford it to figure it out.

1207
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,950
Exactly.
I feel that way about everything.

1208
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:33,440
So do I.
That's been my mantra forever.

1209
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,430
That's people are like,
oh,

1210
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,370
you know,
you got lucky.

1211
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,870
I worked my fucking ass off my whole
life.

1212
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,240
Well you definitely got lucky.
He didn't get hit by a meteor.

1213
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,230
You got lucky for a lot of things.
Lucky he didn't get home invaded.

1214
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:47,210
You got a lotta lotta luck.
Luck.

1215
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,440
But I'll tell you your,
your,

1216
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:51,080
your past guests of mr.
Elan musk there,

1217
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:54,650
he kind of ruined it for us because now
we actually have a possibility of

1218
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:57,410
getting in a car wreck and space.
Yeah.

1219
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:59,960
You could get in a car wreck and space
because that car is just floating around

1220
00:52:59,961 --> 00:53:02,570
out there.
What if that car slams into a fucking

1221
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:05,330
alien?
Spaceships is coming to save us and elon

1222
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:08,630
musk just frivolously shot that fucking
thing in the orbit.

1223
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:11,240
He did.
He just shot it up there and they'd let

1224
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:13,400
him with a robot sitting in the front
seat.

1225
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:14,960
You know?
We were joking around about like,

1226
00:53:14,961 --> 00:53:19,340
what if that guy in the front seat is
actually a guy who fucked his wife and

1227
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:22,370
he decided to kill that guy and stick
him in a fucking space suit.

1228
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:23,710
Shoot him into orbit.
See,

1229
00:53:23,711 --> 00:53:25,830
I don't get that.
Why do you want to be at the guy if he

1230
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:27,240
does that?
You got to be mad at your wife.

1231
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,350
I agree.
I'm with you on.

1232
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,970
I'm with you on that to be mad.
If I came home and a dude who's banging

1233
00:53:32,971 --> 00:53:34,140
my wife,
I will listen bro.

1234
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,300
I get it.
You go,

1235
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:38,540
you gotta go.
You're to.

1236
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,810
Depends on what he looks like too.
I mean,

1237
00:53:42,811 --> 00:53:46,020
if he's like aqua man to her,
I'd tell her I get it.

1238
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,030
Yeah.
Sometimes you got to do that.

1239
00:53:48,031 --> 00:53:48,950
Yeah.
But uh,

1240
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,370
but uh,
yeah.

1241
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,270
Oh,
we're going again going again,

1242
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:55,104
bro.
This doesn't.

1243
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:59,730
This devil sneak up on you.
I could getting snuck up on since the

1244
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:00,563
eighties.
Solute

1245
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:05,290
per.
Ooh.

1246
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,890
It's so good though.
It is good.

1247
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:10,020
It's smooth.
I like the cinnamon too.

1248
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:10,621
Yeah,
yeah.

1249
00:54:10,621 --> 00:54:14,550
Yeah.
And it's funny drink for a real tequila

1250
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,770
enthusiasm though.
Is that like sacrilege?

1251
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,140
Is that like an electric mustang?
Oh yeah.

1252
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,390
But that's what the monkey has always
done.

1253
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:23,340
You know,
it's like a play on the golf thing.

1254
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:28,740
I decided to launch gas monkey golf
apparel line and so I'll be wearing a

1255
00:54:28,771 --> 00:54:31,080
golf shirt out there and It's pretty
crazy.

1256
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:33,270
It's got a skull and all kinds of crap
or whatever.

1257
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,910
But uh,
where I'm pushing the envelope as the

1258
00:54:35,911 --> 00:54:38,880
monkey is,
our tagline is snap and teas and filling

1259
00:54:38,881 --> 00:54:39,714
holes.

1260
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,700
Now when you bring that to the country
club,

1261
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:45,570
do people say,
sir,

1262
00:54:45,571 --> 00:54:48,690
that attire is unforgivable here.
Oh yeah,

1263
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,730
for sure.
I've been thrown out of my own country

1264
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:52,200
club plenty of times.
He really.

1265
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,140
And I've bought a lot of golf carts
because I've crashed because I thought

1266
00:54:55,141 --> 00:54:59,040
it was fun and thrown out of your own
country club a bunch.

1267
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:02,390
It's really for what?
Just raising too much hail,

1268
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,730
you know,
almost like the old rodney danger

1269
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:06,741
movies,
you know,

1270
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:07,521
it's like,
sorry,

1271
00:55:07,521 --> 00:55:08,700
you can't do that in here.
And I was like,

1272
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:10,350
oh,
I'm going to do it twice.

1273
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:14,070
Caddyshack all time.
Exactly.

1274
00:55:14,071 --> 00:55:16,050
Yeah.
Now what did they say to you?

1275
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,200
Just,
you know,

1276
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:21,160
they usually just take me home because I
live on the course,

1277
00:55:21,161 --> 00:55:23,400
so they'll drop me down there.
So you,

1278
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,440
you have a house on the course?
I did.

1279
00:55:25,441 --> 00:55:26,880
I lived downtown in dallas now.

1280
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,330
But uh,
I'm the worst one was I decided to drive

1281
00:55:30,331 --> 00:55:34,020
my harley home on the golf course.
One grass.

1282
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,790
No,
I stayed to the cart path.

1283
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,850
I'm not a complete asshole.
but uh,

1284
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,880
I did drive it home at about 1:30 or two
in the morning in my house is probably

1285
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:46,830
the furthest house from the clubhouse.
And that thing is frigging loud when

1286
00:55:46,831 --> 00:55:47,780
you're in that,
you know,

1287
00:55:47,781 --> 00:55:50,170
this trench of a golf course.
Right.

1288
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:51,960
The cops were waiting on me when I got
home,

1289
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,990
but thank god they were reading the
cops.

1290
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,250
I was like,
you can't do anything.

1291
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,400
I'm going inside fate.
Golf course cops.

1292
00:55:58,401 --> 00:55:58,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

1293
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,210
You know,
the community cops,

1294
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,640
community cubs.
That's adorable.

1295
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:05,100
I had a good one for you.
I actually got arrested at this country

1296
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:05,820
club.
Well,

1297
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,570
at my house for it.
I wouldn't say arrested Because they

1298
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,880
ended up letting me go,
but they did come cuff me and put me

1299
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:13,070
away.
Um,

1300
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,160
the um,
we're coming home uh,

1301
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:19,810
from a christmas extravaganza,
which I do with my buddies every year.

1302
00:56:19,811 --> 00:56:23,650
Right before christmas we get a big
garden pile in and we go christmas

1303
00:56:23,651 --> 00:56:23,980
shopping

1304
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,400
for our families and what have you
coming home loaded.

1305
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:33,590
I supposedly through a burrito from taco
bell or something and hit the guard.

1306
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,300
So there's four,
three or four of my buddies.

1307
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:40,330
We get to my house,
we pig out on shitty taco bell food,

1308
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:43,000
you know,
until everybody passes out.

1309
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:46,270
And the next thing I know the cop lights
are on banging on the door,

1310
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,050
get out of here.
I come to the door going,

1311
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,133
hey,
why?

1312
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:50,690
You know,
after you've been drinking,

1313
00:56:50,691 --> 00:56:53,380
did you do a bunch of food?
You're fucking gone.

1314
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:56,350
And uh,
so long story short,

1315
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,550
they said,
well,

1316
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,910
you're going to be arrested for assault
if you don't get at it and say you're

1317
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:03,370
sorry to this guy salt with a burrito.
Correct.

1318
00:57:03,371 --> 00:57:04,460
Right.
And by the,

1319
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,650
so if you charge a man with a salt
because he throws a burrito at you,

1320
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:10,720
you should,
you should turn in your card.

1321
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,930
But if we were to tape it was not like
throwing it at him.

1322
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,180
It's not like I've barely with a
baseball right here.

1323
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,920
I like chunked it to him to eat,
but he didn't see it coming and so I

1324
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:22,180
slapped him and Fell down.
So they cuffed me.

1325
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,950
They take me down to the guard house.
Yeah,

1326
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,200
they put me in the back of the cop car
coffeecake oh,

1327
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,360
these are real.
It's so real.

1328
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:32,350
Yeah.
He fileD a report and so this is how

1329
00:57:32,351 --> 00:57:35,470
stupid it gets shaped by then.
I'm so fricking loaded.

1330
00:57:35,471 --> 00:57:38,170
Right.
And I get there and the burrito stiLl on

1331
00:57:38,171 --> 00:57:38,681
the ground,
I'm like,

1332
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:41,560
it's evidence or some shit.
And they're telling me I got to

1333
00:57:41,561 --> 00:57:44,710
apologize to this guy and all I can
focus on is there's a perfectly good

1334
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,800
vegan burrito.
I'm going to eat this burrito.

1335
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:52,390
So sit down and literally start eating
the burrito and you're like,

1336
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,590
please just tell her you're sorry.

1337
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:55,300
So you go back home.
And I'm like,

1338
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:57,640
okay.
So I tell him I'm sorry I'm still eating

1339
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:01,180
a burrito and they just left me there
like a mile from my house at the.

1340
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:07,060
You walked home with mild drug.
Do you see the guy since then?

1341
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:09,483
Oh gosh,
no.

1342
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:10,271
I was like,
dude,

1343
00:58:10,271 --> 00:58:13,240
that was perfectly back.
This was in the days before the

1344
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:15,880
sprinters are so popular.
So it was like a stretch limo,

1345
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:16,400
which is,
you know,

1346
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,790
you just really don't ride it anymore.
And I was like,

1347
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,000
that's a hell of a shot.
Came out of the back window,

1348
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,530
120 inches up to the front,
hit the gas squared,

1349
00:58:24,531 --> 00:58:27,320
the fucking chest.
I should get a medal for that.

1350
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,930
Assault
might be a plus in here.

1351
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:35,050
Assault with a burrito is probably the
first time we've had that.

1352
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,220
And you're a little a podcast room.
I definitely think it's the first time

1353
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,070
it seems like you'd just be able to say,
hey,

1354
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:44,470
I just throw it to you because I was
drunk.

1355
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:47,020
I thought you were hungry.
This is really what it was.

1356
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:49,120
This is what I mean.
You can hear me on the video going,

1357
00:58:49,121 --> 00:58:50,170
hey,
you want a burrito?

1358
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:54,400
And uh,
it was pretty ridiculous.

1359
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,530
The guy got a bankcard yang for sure.
Yeah.

1360
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:58,990
What someone calls us salt,
like how dare you.

1361
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:04,080
Some people get beaten to a pulp and you
call him a taco bell burrito flying your

1362
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:06,260
way.
That thing costs a dollar 99 dude

1363
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,560
and it's barely meet.
We were going over like how much of

1364
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:19,240
a ruling on how much meat.
It actually has to be where you can call

1365
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:21,740
it a beef burrito,
but there's fillers

1366
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,270
in that shit.
Like what is the filler was like

1367
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:28,010
silicone or something like that.
But it's something ridiculous like 34

1368
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:31,270
percent of it is not actually meet.
That's why.

1369
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:36,330
I mean that was 10 years ago,
80 percent for the internet.

1370
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,970
They can pretend it's me.
Well,

1371
00:59:40,971 --> 00:59:43,220
the cool thing,
taco bell now starting to open all their

1372
00:59:43,221 --> 00:59:45,740
ones up with bars inside there.
What?

1373
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:48,740
Yeah.
Well that's good for business to get

1374
00:59:48,741 --> 00:59:50,660
people more drunks.
I don't care where the food tastes.

1375
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:52,070
Exactly.
Get them all tanked up,

1376
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,780
feed them some burritos and send them on
their way.

1377
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:58,870
Haven't even taco bell in decades.
It's been since then I have some real

1378
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:01,850
legitimate because we're in la.
You're in Texas,

1379
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:03,530
but there's legit mexican places near
you,

1380
01:00:03,531 --> 01:00:04,440
I'm sure.
Oh yeah,

1381
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,930
but like there's legit tuckerias here
where you know,

1382
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:10,010
you go in there and mexican soap operas
are playing.

1383
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:13,070
Nobody speaks english.
You got to a point this shit and say

1384
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:15,620
thing.
You gotta roll your r's language.

1385
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:17,380
Language idea.
Yeah.

1386
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:20,400
You to speak the lingo.
See I can't do the linguists stuFf that.

1387
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:21,860
The tongue,
right?

1388
01:00:21,861 --> 01:00:23,750
Yeah.
I can't do the shit.

1389
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,390
Don't ever have it.
I have tried everything.

1390
01:00:26,391 --> 01:00:27,141
I mean.
Oh man.

1391
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:30,920
You gotta try elk tongue tacos.
I just.

1392
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:34,490
Why For fucking delicious.
So good.

1393
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,960
It's the,
it's the most.

1394
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,730
One of the most tender meat you could
ever have.

1395
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,490
Like the most tender Pot roast ever.
Really.

1396
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,530
It's amazing.
If I ever get a chance,

1397
01:00:42,531 --> 01:00:46,430
there's a place right here on canoga,
like maybe a few miles away from here.

1398
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:47,900
How good is that place,
jamie?

1399
01:00:47,901 --> 01:00:50,210
When I come to California,
I'm not trying to get some elk tongue.

1400
01:00:50,211 --> 01:00:51,044
I promise you.
Well,

1401
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:55,760
I'll help tons in the freezer.
But the cow tongues what they have out

1402
01:00:55,761 --> 01:00:56,240
here.

1403
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,130
Yeah.
Calton elk tons mined.

1404
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:01,280
But a language case,
ideas,

1405
01:01:01,281 --> 01:01:03,600
you know,
you don't fuck with that language talk.

1406
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:05,450
No,
and I don'T do the uh,

1407
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,370
whatever that milk drink is,
what do they call it?

1408
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:08,150
Oh,
horchata.

1409
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:11,000
Yeah.
Know which hat is rough because you

1410
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:13,160
know,
there's no fucking safety standards that

1411
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:17,260
no one knows what's in there.
It's like really shitty eggnog and

1412
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,560
eggnog is shitty.
It's at least six percent is too at,

1413
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:25,580
for sure,
depending on who's working there and how

1414
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,150
disgruntled.
Yeah.

1415
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,190
Um,
but you do cardio sada right?

1416
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:30,530
Yeah,
yeah,

1417
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:31,490
yeah,
yeah.

1418
01:01:31,491 --> 01:01:32,810
I've got a,
I've got a couple of bars and

1419
01:01:32,811 --> 01:01:35,990
restaurants down in Texas and so we sell
a lot of tex mex.

1420
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:38,480
Fusion tex mex is a different kind of
flavor.

1421
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:39,700
It's a different thing.
yeah.

1422
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:43,680
Like people that don't know,
like a what a keto is,

1423
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,280
you know,
like case.

1424
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:47,180
Oh,
in Texas it's like a staple.

1425
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,320
Correct.
Yeah.

1426
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,880
Out here.
No one knows what the fuck case.

1427
01:01:49,881 --> 01:01:52,080
Oh is he?
I want to get some and chips.

1428
01:01:52,081 --> 01:01:53,440
So like what the fuck are you talking
about?

1429
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,810
Any trade shows does a few places.
Okay.

1430
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:01,400
So legit.
A real good legitimate lotus and the

1431
01:02:01,401 --> 01:02:03,710
corn with the a's and the.
Yeah.

1432
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:06,200
Cream in there.
I could get doWn on some of that for

1433
01:02:06,201 --> 01:02:08,690
sure.
Texas is a different fucking country.

1434
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:11,420
It really is.
Well it where I'm at now in dallas,

1435
01:02:11,421 --> 01:02:12,920
uh,
literally I can go to the corner gas

1436
01:02:12,921 --> 01:02:16,520
station and there's a lady there just
saw on the corn off the cob and puts it

1437
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:20,100
in the styrofoam cup and squirts all the
crap in there and I can make

1438
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,880
myself sick on that stuff.
Yeah.

1439
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:23,910
Yeah.
There's tea.

1440
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:27,900
I'm wondering what texts y tex mex is so
much different because there's no

1441
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:29,880
California max.
Right.

1442
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:33,150
But tex mex is.
I would never allow that word to be said

1443
01:02:33,151 --> 01:02:35,880
anyway.
California max is probably just pissed

1444
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:37,320
off.
Seventy 2000 people.

1445
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:42,450
That's just a regular podcast.
He said,

1446
01:02:42,451 --> 01:02:44,730
California mix.
Try ordering.

1447
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:49,740
Lat line is Mexico asshole and he's
stolen from the mexicans.

1448
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,820
Exactly.
know what do you think about this wall?

1449
01:02:56,821 --> 01:02:59,400
Bullshit.
Opening little.

1450
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,230
Those poor people in here give them
jobs.

1451
01:03:01,231 --> 01:03:02,520
I don't give a fuck.
tax it.

1452
01:03:02,521 --> 01:03:03,354
Yeah.
I.

1453
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:06,990
I mean I don't want criminalS.
I don't want criminals coming through.

1454
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,420
How do we filter out gang members and
criminals?

1455
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,660
Just.
I wish there was a way to tell there was

1456
01:03:12,661 --> 01:03:15,600
a way that there's not.
I wish there was a way to tell whether

1457
01:03:15,601 --> 01:03:17,340
someone's a piece of shit and a
criminal.

1458
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:22,430
I wish there was and or someone just
poor because there's a lot for sure.

1459
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:25,950
Both sides are right.
This is how I look at it.

1460
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,320
For sure.
The people that don't want criminals

1461
01:03:28,321 --> 01:03:29,430
coming in here or.
Right.

1462
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:32,490
For sure.
the people that want border control to

1463
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:35,670
keep out gang members and drug dealers
and evil people there.

1464
01:03:35,671 --> 01:03:36,930
Right?
100 percent.

1465
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,033
Look,
I'm.

1466
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:41,580
I'm a fucking american taxpayer.
I have a family.

1467
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,400
I fucking salute,
right?

1468
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:49,440
I,
I believe in the law.

1469
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,980
I believe in all those things,
but also my,

1470
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:55,860
my grandparents were immigrants.
All of them,

1471
01:03:55,861 --> 01:03:59,550
everybody that I that is related to me
came over from europe.

1472
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,770
They all came over from Italy and
Ireland.

1473
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:03,600
All of them.
They all came over because their

1474
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,160
livestock,
they want a better place.

1475
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,760
If someone walks here from Guatemala,
they don't walk here because they're

1476
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,100
lazy.
They walk here because they want a

1477
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:12,400
better life.
This kid,

1478
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:14,250
america's made for it,
so I say let them in.

1479
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:17,220
I say let him into,
but I wish there was a better way to

1480
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:20,610
screen out the ones.
If there was a better way to screen out

1481
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:24,840
the real shitty human beings to stop
that would be.

1482
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:28,470
That would be ideal.
We need to cut screener screeners.

1483
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,650
The way to go.
I'm going to tag that doesn't exist

1484
01:04:31,651 --> 01:04:32,070
right now.

1485
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:35,940
One of my people are listening.
Make sure you buy that whole thing that

1486
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:39,420
all these fucking government workers are
getting paid right now because of a

1487
01:04:39,421 --> 01:04:41,430
wall.
Oh jesus.

1488
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,780
And this is a billionaire.
Donald,

1489
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:48,210
you believe in the wall that much.
Take $5 billion out of your fucking

1490
01:04:48,211 --> 01:04:50,900
account.
Shove those shackles towards the

1491
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:52,500
billion.
How much do they have anything?

1492
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:54,780
They say he's got three,
but it's all paper.

1493
01:04:54,781 --> 01:04:59,210
I think you're right.
It's like smooth ones and zeros

1494
01:04:59,211 --> 01:05:00,660
somewhere.
It's like his hair,

1495
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:06,270
but you know what?
We elected him.

1496
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:08,260
We got to deal with it.
Yeah.

1497
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:11,340
Yeah,
and in our case he was the better

1498
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:14,340
choice,
so he was a better choice of this is why

1499
01:05:14,341 --> 01:05:16,650
he's the better choice because to
realize that our system is completely

1500
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:18,090
hosed it like

1501
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,690
that.
This guy could get in there and build

1502
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:22,050
that wall,
lock her up and everybody's like,

1503
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:25,530
check.
It's.

1504
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,400
It's a.
It's a good.

1505
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:30,790
It's a good example of how our system is
the best,

1506
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:35,640
best system in the world for sure.
This whole experiment and self

1507
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:38,200
government is the best on the planet
earth,

1508
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:40,990
but without a doubt.
But this guy,

1509
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,870
it's not his fault.
That is who he is,

1510
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,510
but he exploited it.
He showed everybody.

1511
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:49,540
He showed everybody the holes in this
fucking goofy system.

1512
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:52,090
I know,
but he's a reality star and that can be

1513
01:05:52,091 --> 01:05:55,090
president one day and you could you and
me

1514
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,420
the ticket,
if logan rawlings ticket,

1515
01:05:58,470 --> 01:06:00,820
we,
we could win and I'm not bullshitting.

1516
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:01,541
You know,
we could,

1517
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:04,780
when I could do that too.
They did some fucking vegas odds and

1518
01:06:04,781 --> 01:06:09,340
they found out that I have better
chances of winning then a lot of people.

1519
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,410
That would be fricking rad.
Yeah.

1520
01:06:11,411 --> 01:06:13,770
There's like a whole list of people who
had better.

1521
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:15,760
Just like throwing them out.

1522
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,890
I got this,
but it's,

1523
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:23,630
you know,
I mean no one's gonna work.

1524
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:25,950
The most fun in that I'm having,
right?

1525
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,890
This second is not even in this room,
so I'm managing my pr person or back

1526
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:33,890
there to fuck up on talking about
politics.

1527
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,380
See,
I don't have one of those.

1528
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,790
My manager is awesome and my pr person
is nonexistent.

1529
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:43,780
So let's get round three going.
Let's go.

1530
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:45,850
Here we go.
Salute.

1531
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,500
Salute.
Marika.

1532
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:51,810
Marika.
Woo.

1533
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:53,890
I'm telling you,
it just keeps getting better.

1534
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:54,521
Yeah,
it does.

1535
01:06:54,521 --> 01:06:56,920
Keep getting better.
Good whiskey or tequila or whatever the

1536
01:06:56,921 --> 01:06:58,210
fuck it is.
I forget now.

1537
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,940
Yeah,
to politics or the.

1538
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:03,550
That is the one thing that people say
you shouldn't talk about,

1539
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,600
but I like,
isn't that what helps us to talk about

1540
01:07:07,601 --> 01:07:10,180
it?
It's just that people are so fragmented.

1541
01:07:10,181 --> 01:07:12,730
People fragment out everything you say.
And they're like,

1542
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:13,720
well,
you know,

1543
01:07:13,721 --> 01:07:15,760
it's like,
it's like you said something,

1544
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:17,980
but then they turned it into this one
little sentence going,

1545
01:07:17,981 --> 01:07:20,800
wait a second.
He said these two scripted averages in

1546
01:07:20,801 --> 01:07:23,850
this fucking noun and verb and look at
what he said.

1547
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:25,570
He said,
screening.

1548
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,800
Yeah,
you heard him.

1549
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,160
I told my pete,
what about cut screening.com.

1550
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:33,100
I don't know what I'm going to do with
it,

1551
01:07:33,101 --> 01:07:34,210
but we're going to use it.
Well,

1552
01:07:34,211 --> 01:07:37,060
if we could just figure out a way to put
microchips and everybody will know

1553
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:40,120
everybody is what everybody did and that
way we'll know if you're a cut.

1554
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,690
He walked past this little thing and it
goes beep.

1555
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,670
You'll walk by.
He throws burritos,

1556
01:07:48,671 --> 01:07:53,110
but he's a good guy.
I'm going to get 50 cars a.

1557
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,760
Well,
a lot of them are for sale,

1558
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,110
but uh,
we have some pretty cool stuff in there.

1559
01:07:59,111 --> 01:08:00,790
Um,
but I'm a big 32 ford guy,

1560
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,340
so I've got all the 30 to 40.
What is 32 four.

1561
01:08:03,341 --> 01:08:05,350
Why does that one?
Because that's like,

1562
01:08:05,351 --> 01:08:08,830
um,
to most guys like myself.

1563
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,750
Anyways,
that's what started the hot rod

1564
01:08:10,751 --> 01:08:12,520
movement.
They were cheap.

1565
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:15,970
They were plentIful.
The guys came back from ww two and you

1566
01:08:15,971 --> 01:08:16,160
know,

1567
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:21,160
they bought a $20 32 ford and stuffed v
eight in it and that became the hot rod

1568
01:08:23,121 --> 01:08:28,121
scene and right because like in 47,
32 ford was like the old used car that

1569
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:33,140
he bought that thing for like 20 bucks
and maybe even 10 or five,

1570
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:36,740
you know,
now we're paying $50 for one that needs

1571
01:08:36,741 --> 01:08:38,270
everything.
What was your fIrst car?

1572
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:43,850
my first car was a 73 mercury comment.
My first car was a [inaudible] 73

1573
01:08:43,851 --> 01:08:46,940
chevelle.
Well that's way cooler than a pIss green

1574
01:08:46,941 --> 01:08:50,600
mercury comet.
I promised last I drove it from,

1575
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:53,510
the guy bought it from,
I got it home and the next day the

1576
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:56,390
engine blew.
That's operator error.

1577
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,720
No
shit box.

1578
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:04,190
It was just terrible that a six cylinder
straight six cylinder.

1579
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:05,750
So it wasn't fast,
it wasn't cool,

1580
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:08,840
it was,
it was piss green from the seventies and

1581
01:09:08,841 --> 01:09:12,520
it was pea green interior and uh,
you know,

1582
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:15,050
the ladies didn't like it and it had the
squeaks and stuff,

1583
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:15,680
you know,
going,

1584
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,110
I'd be pulling into high school and
going over the speed,

1585
01:09:18,111 --> 01:09:22,000
but I was like,
shit,

1586
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:24,230
this is not cool at all.

1587
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,250
But by the time I graduated,
because I always worked hard,

1588
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:28,490
mowed yards,
rake leaves,

1589
01:09:28,491 --> 01:09:30,120
whatever I could do.
Um,

1590
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:35,030
I was a hustler.
So by my senior year I was driving a 77

1591
01:09:35,031 --> 01:09:35,930
bandit,
trans am.

1592
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,090
Woo.
Now the lady started paying a little

1593
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,610
more attention.
That's legit.

1594
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,940
Those cars are still legit.
Those bandit trans ams,

1595
01:09:43,941 --> 01:09:46,250
that movie just revolutionized trans
ams.

1596
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:50,840
It revolutionized a cars in movies when
you had burt reynolds on your car,

1597
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:51,733
on your show,
rather.

1598
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:55,430
I have to say that I got sad when I saw
him walk out.

1599
01:09:55,431 --> 01:09:57,050
I was like,
oh man,

1600
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,110
that's burt reynolds baggies that broken
down.

1601
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,190
You know,
he was really bad broken down at that

1602
01:10:04,191 --> 01:10:06,530
point in time,
but towards the end of his life,

1603
01:10:06,531 --> 01:10:09,410
he came back kind of full circle.
He was a whole different kind of person

1604
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:11,120
about a year and a half,
two years later,

1605
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:12,530
how,
I don't know,

1606
01:10:12,531 --> 01:10:14,360
but he,
I don't know if he was just going

1607
01:10:14,361 --> 01:10:17,990
through a bad spot,
but towards the end he was hip.

1608
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:19,520
Cool.
We did a lot of different things

1609
01:10:19,521 --> 01:10:21,530
together that you'll see a real,
you know,

1610
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:22,790
and uh,
what have you.

1611
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:26,360
But the cool thing that not a lot of
people know in my office,

1612
01:10:26,361 --> 01:10:30,910
I have the hat,
the hat with all the feathers and the,

1613
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:33,990
and the what have you.
Yeah.

1614
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:37,100
So when I was filming at his house,
he comes out,

1615
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:38,690
he goes,
hold on a second,

1616
01:10:38,691 --> 01:10:41,120
how I get you something.
And he goes in,

1617
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:43,070
comes back out,
and he goes,

1618
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:45,640
I didn't ever know who I was going to
give this to as the fuck.

1619
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:49,520
It's not that one.
It's the one from smoking vent to.

1620
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:52,980
But um,
that is to um,

1621
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:57,350
well fuck it too much.
He is sitting in there and I've got a

1622
01:10:57,351 --> 01:10:59,800
picture of him giving it to me.
And um,

1623
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:01,970
I had like man tears.
I mean,

1624
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:04,250
I had like,
my hair was growing on my arms and

1625
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:04,691
stuff,
but,

1626
01:11:04,691 --> 01:11:05,900
you know,
standing up and I'm like,

1627
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:07,280
dude,
I can't take that.

1628
01:11:07,281 --> 01:11:07,791
And he goes,
oh,

1629
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:09,140
you will.
And I'm like,

1630
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,240
okay,
let me just going to tell burt reynolds

1631
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:12,690
know.
And uh,

1632
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:13,920
so sits there

1633
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:19,160
as kind of a memorial and he was a super
cool guy and he was really a car guy

1634
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:21,450
and,
but also there it is.

1635
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:26,820
And he was just giving you his hat and
shit.

1636
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:29,100
Yeah,
he was a bad ass man.

1637
01:11:29,101 --> 01:11:31,230
I mean he didn't have a cane at this
point in time.

1638
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:34,530
So whatever it was that he,
he must have some surgery or something

1639
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:35,364
like that.
It was,

1640
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:37,380
I don't think so.
I think it was just frail at the time.

1641
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:38,400
Um,
and he,

1642
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,140
yeah,
he was,

1643
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:44,480
this was four years ago maybe.
And now,

1644
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,180
um,
you know,

1645
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,280
he just passed away.
But uh,

1646
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,540
he,
he came around,

1647
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,160
you know,
he does the barrett jackson and stuff

1648
01:11:50,161 --> 01:11:52,650
wIth us and uh,
I've got a friend of mine that owns

1649
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:54,510
company restorative muscle car that
does,

1650
01:11:54,511 --> 01:11:56,970
uh,
just transient type stuff.

1651
01:11:57,030 --> 01:12:00,960
And it was cool those smokey and the
bandit years were when I was in

1652
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,790
highschool,
81,

1653
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:04,170
I was a freshman in high school.

1654
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:07,560
I was 84,
so I remember watching those,

1655
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,250
watching those movies and,
and saying like,

1656
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:14,700
this guy,
he's like having fun,

1657
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:17,130
smiling.
And he was like,

1658
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:19,620
he was silly.
That's the secret to get smoky.

1659
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:22,500
I'm fucking having a blast.
It's not a big fucking deal.

1660
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:23,900
Um,
and,

1661
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:27,110
and did you look at all the other ones
that people don't talk about?

1662
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:29,980
A lot like hooper or stroker ace,
you know,

1663
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:32,160
not to mentIon cannon ball and all the
other ones.

1664
01:12:32,161 --> 01:12:36,030
I mean they were literally a group of
guys that kind of took our overhaul.

1665
01:12:36,031 --> 01:12:39,700
He would for a small period of time and
just had a blast.

1666
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,430
Just had good times.
they were like,

1667
01:12:41,431 --> 01:12:43,830
hey,
this might be fun to go film this movie

1668
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,780
for two weeks across America and fuck
shit up.

1669
01:12:45,781 --> 01:12:46,770
Let's go do It.
All right,

1670
01:12:46,771 --> 01:12:48,510
cool.
Well he was just silly.

1671
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:51,450
He was always smiling and silly.
And he had.

1672
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:54,000
Jackie gleason was the enemy.
Like,

1673
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:55,230
come on man.
What do you got?

1674
01:12:55,231 --> 01:12:57,310
Jackie gleason is the evil guy,

1675
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:00,180
you got a goddamn great movie.
That's silliness.

1676
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,350
I need a dr.
Pepper.

1677
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,720
Yeah.
And diablo sandwich and make it a fast.

1678
01:13:06,721 --> 01:13:08,630
I'm an ra.
I mean it was just.

1679
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:12,180
I mean,

1680
01:13:12,181 --> 01:13:13,590

1681
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,520

You so bitch.

1682
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:22,350
Those are great.
Fucking sally fields is the girlfriend.

1683
01:13:22,351 --> 01:13:24,240
I mean it was just fucking amazing,
man.

1684
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,330
You go.
I'd love those movies,

1685
01:13:27,331 --> 01:13:28,260

Dude.

1686
01:13:28,261 --> 01:13:32,420
And getting to shave and my goatee often
and dress like that and,

1687
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:37,580
and do the show that I did was
absolutely second to none.

1688
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:39,270
I'm like,
this is as cool as it gets.

1689
01:13:39,271 --> 01:13:40,150
You know,
I,

1690
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,110
I'm done.
Cool.

1691
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,280
I do with that car.
Did you sell it?

1692
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:46,740
You have.
We actually gave it away on discovery.

1693
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,730
Oh really?
Yeah.

1694
01:13:47,731 --> 01:13:49,650
So somebody's got it.
It's a good car.

1695
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:52,350
It was really nice car.
Great looking car man.

1696
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:56,400
God damn those old.
Those trans ams from that year that with

1697
01:13:56,401 --> 01:13:58,950
the firebird on the fucking hood.
God there.

1698
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,540
So as heavy though,
man.

1699
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:02,120
I mean to.
You can't.

1700
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:05,100
It doesn't matter how good a driver you
are.

1701
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:08,100
That thing is asked heavy.
It'll come around on you in a heartbeat.

1702
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,390
Of course.
Mine,

1703
01:14:09,391 --> 01:14:11,130
I bought a.
My dad was actually,

1704
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,100
they said my

1705
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,620
parents told me that I couldn't get it
because they said they couldn't afford

1706
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:17,830
the insurance and everything and they
didn't know I was always hustling and

1707
01:14:17,831 --> 01:14:21,370
doing stuff and what have you.
So I just showed up at home one day with

1708
01:14:21,371 --> 01:14:23,710
it and they were like,
we told you,

1709
01:14:23,711 --> 01:14:27,100
I said I paid cash and I paid for a
year's where the insurance up front.

1710
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:28,570
And they were like,
my dad's like,

1711
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:31,220
where the fuck did you get that money
working?

1712
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:32,700
He goes,
how much money you got?

1713
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,180
RIght.
So I take him to a room.

1714
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:37,870
I showed him my shoe box and he's like,
which is more than I make

1715
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:41,890
will we do to make that money?
Oh dude.

1716
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:46,060
I was a hustler back then selling car
stereos out of my truck,

1717
01:14:46,061 --> 01:14:49,150
you know,
so anything anybody would buy,

1718
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,070
raking leaves,
mowing yards.

1719
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:53,230
I mean,
I was kind of a geeky kid at the time

1720
01:14:53,231 --> 01:14:55,960
and a little bit on the small side,
so I had a lot of free time.

1721
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,210
I wasn't exactly banging the
cheerleaders or anything,

1722
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:04,320
so I knew I'd just always kind of was a
hustler.

1723
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:07,480
Wanted to make money and how to respect
that.

1724
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:08,600
Oh,
he did.

1725
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,370
He did.
He was,

1726
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:10,700
he was actually very impressed.
He was like,

1727
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:11,861
he goes,
he goes,

1728
01:15:11,861 --> 01:15:13,630
we don't have that much in our family
bank account.

1729
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,890
Wow.
You know.

1730
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,680
And uh,
I was like,

1731
01:15:16,681 --> 01:15:17,380
well,
that,

1732
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,500
you know,
and uh,

1733
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,610
but my dad was a,
it is a phenomenal dude.

1734
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,180
Worked three years,
uh,

1735
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:25,080
you talk about a good dad,
you know,

1736
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,770
you're a dad.
And so my,

1737
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:28,050
but a good dad.
I mean,

1738
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:33,160
my mom left when I was two,
ditched my dad with me at two and my

1739
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:36,820
sister at six or so and uh,
you know,

1740
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:39,790
it was the seventies.
So you would think that,

1741
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:41,440
uh,
my dad would be like,

1742
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,870
I'm going to smoke this weed and drive
away.

1743
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:47,320
But instead he buckled down and got,
got two jobs and worked.

1744
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:51,730
He worked two jobs Pretty much my whole
life and provided for us and we

1745
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:55,660
defInitely didn't have much,
but we had a roof and we had food and

1746
01:15:55,661 --> 01:15:58,180
shit.
He's still in contact with your mom now?

1747
01:15:58,181 --> 01:16:00,770
Not really.
I hate to say that,

1748
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:01,680
you know,
but mom's,

1749
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,450
uh,
she lives down in Florida.

1750
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:08,580
I'm sure she's a whatever she is,
but a little too much for me.

1751
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:12,610
The exact opposite story.
Oh yeah,

1752
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:15,220
yeah.
My mom left my dad when I was five and I

1753
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:20,080
haven't even spoken a word.
My dad went on til from seven years old

1754
01:16:20,081 --> 01:16:21,590
on no kid.
Yeah.

1755
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:24,370
Well I've actually,
I've kept up with my mom and we talked

1756
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,850
about every two or three years and it
reminds me of why I don't talk to her

1757
01:16:26,851 --> 01:16:29,390
anymore.
So then I'm good.

1758
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,160
I'm sure if I met my dad would be the
same thing,

1759
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,990
but I have a stepdad.
He's a great guy.

1760
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:39,130
I got real lucky.
I had a stepmom and it didn't turn out

1761
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,290
super great,
but she did teach me a little bit about

1762
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:45,220
math and you know,
to how to run books because she was

1763
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,670
basically a thief.
But so

1764
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:54,580
I at least learned for the explosion one
step mom until I moved out of house

1765
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:56,050
until I was out of high school.
yeah.

1766
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:59,830
then my dad went on to marry like a
series of super,

1767
01:16:59,831 --> 01:17:02,680
really fricking just eft up
individually.

1768
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,350
He just started running through them and
I was like dad,

1769
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:10,040
married,
any of them come with

1770
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:15,100
two or three of them
about people to get married like five,

1771
01:17:16,401 --> 01:17:17,660
six,
seven times.

1772
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:18,950
I,
I respect that.

1773
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,740
This is what I respect.
I respect people that keep fucking

1774
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:22,820
swinging,
you know,

1775
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:25,160
even though you go down and the fifth,
you know,

1776
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:29,190
you get back up and you go down the six
go down to the seventh there,

1777
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,310
you know,
my dad was like that.

1778
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:31,821
He was like,
ah,

1779
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:35,330
it's fucking good party.
So come on out and I'm getting married.

1780
01:17:35,331 --> 01:17:38,660
You know,
he had one wife one time.

1781
01:17:38,661 --> 01:17:42,860
I get there for like family christmas on
either christmas eve or whatever.

1782
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:46,070
It's like going to the dad's house with
the young kids and what have you.

1783
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:48,680
And we get there and she's all doped up
on,

1784
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:52,190
you know,
whatever pills were popular at the time.

1785
01:17:52,191 --> 01:17:53,120
And she's like,
hey,

1786
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:55,870
can I take your shirt off?
Oh

1787
01:17:57,580 --> 01:18:00,650
yeah.
When she's crawlinG around on the floor

1788
01:18:00,651 --> 01:18:04,490
and try and take off her clothes and the
whole family sitting there like,

1789
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:09,020
what the hell Is this dad?
And so now he's,

1790
01:18:09,021 --> 01:18:10,250
uh,
he's in,

1791
01:18:10,251 --> 01:18:10,740
uh,
uh,

1792
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:12,560
an alzheimer's home.
But,

1793
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:13,953
but,
uh,

1794
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,740
yeah,
that's the part of what's scary about

1795
01:18:15,741 --> 01:18:17,810
turning 50.
But he's like in,

1796
01:18:17,811 --> 01:18:20,290
they're nailing all these chicks.
We come,

1797
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:24,430
we go in there and he's like making out
with some girl with a nasal cannula on

1798
01:18:24,431 --> 01:18:27,680
and carrying her oxygen bottle.
And he's convinced that they've been

1799
01:18:27,681 --> 01:18:28,514
married for a few.

1800
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:35,120
I have a bin in my act about the
outbreak of stds in nursing.

1801
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:37,490
It's out of control.
It's viagara.

1802
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:39,020
Oh,
it's not only just that,

1803
01:18:39,021 --> 01:18:39,854
these people,
I mean,

1804
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:45,070
I mean my dad has really advanced
alzheimer's and he knows that he misses

1805
01:18:48,561 --> 01:18:50,480
his mustang.
Uh,

1806
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:53,330
I took all those bicycles away and I
need to get laid.

1807
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,520
That's it.
And he's in there just running around

1808
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,310
with it.
If we got called my sister and I take

1809
01:19:01,311 --> 01:19:06,170
care of my data in that manner.
And so we get called to tHe home,

1810
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:08,480
almost like being called to the
principal's office as a,

1811
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:09,800
as a parent.
They're like,

1812
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:11,840
your dad'S literally in here.
Fucking everybody

1813
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:22,910
literally had the feeling of getting
janked in there to the,

1814
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,880
to the principal's office.
Like Your kids.

1815
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:26,720
Fuck up your,
your dad's fucking.

1816
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:33,280
But you had to be proud
of what do y'all care?

1817
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:37,220
That's my point.
That's What I say about him in my acts

1818
01:19:37,221 --> 01:19:38,001
like,
come on man.

1819
01:19:38,001 --> 01:19:39,620
How do you want these people die out?
What?

1820
01:19:39,621 --> 01:19:41,360
Their hardest top where they're playing.
Bingo.

1821
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:44,180
Yeah,
have a good time.

1822
01:19:44,181 --> 01:19:46,240
Just don't want him hurt each other.
We'll see.

1823
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:48,530
I mean,
I'm in the healthcare business also home

1824
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:50,030
health care.
And so I know,

1825
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:51,620
yeah,
I've got a lot of different ventures.

1826
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,390
But what,
what do you in how you in the home

1827
01:19:53,391 --> 01:19:55,250
healthcare business,
a home health care with,

1828
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:56,450
uh,
with my wife.

1829
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:58,160
Uh,
we 16,

1830
01:19:58,161 --> 01:20:00,290
17 years ago,
maybe longer.

1831
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:02,420
uh,
so in the state of Texas,

1832
01:20:02,421 --> 01:20:05,660
it's probably the second or third
largest home health care.

1833
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,980
But I'm talking a real home healthcare.
Like you got to get shots,

1834
01:20:07,981 --> 01:20:09,200
you've got to get therapy,
you got,

1835
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:12,950
these are trends that are going in and
they're not people you go into bathe

1836
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:14,490
grandma,
what is your business?

1837
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:17,910
You hire a bunch of nurses to take care
of people that are at home.

1838
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:19,380
Yeah,
it's prescribed,

1839
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,570
uh,
like through medicare or insurance or

1840
01:20:21,571 --> 01:20:26,190
whatever to where maybe somebody gets a
knee or a shoulder replacement or maybe

1841
01:20:26,191 --> 01:20:29,550
it's an injury or cancer or what have
you.

1842
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,530
And so it's a very rewarding business.
We probably have 3000 to 2,500,

1843
01:20:34,531 --> 01:20:38,070
3000 patients at any given time all
around the state of Texas.

1844
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:40,020
And uh,
so it's,

1845
01:20:40,021 --> 01:20:40,360
uh,
it's,

1846
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:44,460
it's a fun business to be in that you're
really getting help people.

1847
01:20:44,461 --> 01:20:46,800
But at the same time,
that shit out there,

1848
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:48,960
it's crazy.
These guys are,

1849
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,530
they're getting after it.
He'd go into the nursing home and it's

1850
01:20:52,531 --> 01:20:53,600
like,
damn,

1851
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:55,740
dude,
this 78 year old dudes had more ass than

1852
01:20:55,741 --> 01:20:56,880
I had last week.

1853
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,760
Yeah.
Why not?

1854
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:05,430
Why not?
Why not?

1855
01:21:05,431 --> 01:21:06,840
My thought is why not?
Well,

1856
01:21:06,841 --> 01:21:08,160
I bought my dad a,
you know,

1857
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:10,080
he's got his room.
That's kind of like an apartment or

1858
01:21:10,081 --> 01:21:12,390
whatever.
And I bought him stripper sheets are not

1859
01:21:12,391 --> 01:21:13,420
stripper sheets,
but uh,

1860
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:17,610
a twister,
twister sheets with all red and blues

1861
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:21,080
and greens and I hug a board thing up
behind his bed.

1862
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:21,541
I'm like,
dad,

1863
01:21:21,541 --> 01:21:23,130
if you're getting after you guys will
have fun.

1864
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:26,520
I mean fuck bingo or freaking whatever.
SO when,

1865
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,730
because he has alzheimer's,
does he remember when he gets after it?

1866
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:33,260
I think it said he's just so focused on
and he just,

1867
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,060
he was kind of,
what would you call him?

1868
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:36,980
Accustomed nuba.
he was,

1869
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,390
he,
my dad got some serious ass my whole

1870
01:21:39,391 --> 01:21:43,350
life.
I mean as a teenager I was like god damn

1871
01:21:43,351 --> 01:21:47,850
it as like bang and everything.
But when your wife leaves you with kids

1872
01:21:47,851 --> 01:21:49,110
when you're young,
you just realize,

1873
01:21:49,111 --> 01:21:52,230
okay,
forget about this longterm shit.

1874
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,000
Yeah,
let's just enjoy the moment.

1875
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:55,830
Yeah.
But I mean my dad was straight up

1876
01:21:55,831 --> 01:21:57,950
products of the sixties and seventies,
you know,

1877
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:01,050
so he,
he like dyed his hair blond and his

1878
01:22:01,051 --> 01:22:04,410
eyebrows blonde and shit.
Walk around looking like matthew

1879
01:22:04,411 --> 01:22:06,630
mcconaughey.
Dazed and confused.

1880
01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:07,590
Alright,
alright.

1881
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:10,540
I'll try driving his mustang.
You know,

1882
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:15,450
can come pick me up from school,
what kind of back then it was like a 72

1883
01:22:15,451 --> 01:22:16,440
fast back,
you know,

1884
01:22:16,441 --> 01:22:19,920
red and black with a four speed and he'd
be hammering it and I'm like,

1885
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:20,731
you know,
five,

1886
01:22:20,731 --> 01:22:24,000
six years old of age,
I'd fall on the floor because nobody

1887
01:22:24,001 --> 01:22:26,560
wore a freaking seatbelt back then.
And uh,

1888
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,220
his idea of afterschool care was the
skating rink because he knew that thing.

1889
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:34,810
It'd be open till nine,
so drop us off at the skating rink and

1890
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:39,810
ninety nine cent corn dog meal and uh,
he come pick us up usually around 10 or

1891
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:43,340
11 and with some irate skating rink
owners sitting there pissed off and

1892
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:45,300
like,
wow,

1893
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:48,390
he was a bad ass.
It is a bad ass still.

1894
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,250
I mean,
he's nailing chicks in a nursing home.

1895
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:55,320
Come on.
It's so weird when You become an adult,

1896
01:22:55,321 --> 01:22:56,760
isn't it?
Oh yeah.

1897
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:57,990
You know,
when you think about,

1898
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,220
oh,
round four,

1899
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:02,490
we got to drink water from rawlings,
raymond rawlings,

1900
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:05,740
Raymond Miller,
rawlings mother fucker.

1901
01:23:05,741 --> 01:23:08,650
That ever lived.
So I looped for sure.

1902
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,870
I mean,
I guarantee you he got more acid than

1903
01:23:14,871 --> 01:23:16,540
you and I did this all week.
I believe it.

1904
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:18,850
He's freaking probably banging one right
now.

1905
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:19,841
it's like,
hey,

1906
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:23,420
what's that noise in the back?
Sounds like my son is the tv plus the

1907
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:25,240
goal.
the goal is like,

1908
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:27,910
or the bonus rather is that they can't
get pregnant.

1909
01:23:28,890 --> 01:23:31,300
You got that mean it's over.
Yeah.

1910
01:23:31,301 --> 01:23:34,600
Well that's uh,
that's not happening,

1911
01:23:34,601 --> 01:23:36,460
but you can still get some diseases and
stuff.

1912
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:38,620
And they do.
Yes they do.

1913
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,150
But the thing is where they getting
them.

1914
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,290
Well somebody had it and then the next
thing you know,

1915
01:23:43,291 --> 01:23:45,760
all 100 people in that building have
done it right.

1916
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:50,790
But did they have it already or they're
getting it from the building now.

1917
01:23:51,311 --> 01:23:52,930
They had it already.
He had already.

1918
01:23:52,931 --> 01:23:56,230
So you're dealing with herpes or you're
dealing with the real weird ones like

1919
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:58,030
syphIlis and gonorrhea and shit.

1920
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,250
The syphilis and gonorrhea is like,
hey,

1921
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:02,710
you got to treat thIs.
Where are you getting this?

1922
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:03,920
Oh no,
it's,

1923
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:04,900
it's,
it's prevalent.

1924
01:24:04,901 --> 01:24:05,621
It's everything.
Right.

1925
01:24:05,621 --> 01:24:07,600
But the question is,
are they getting it from outside

1926
01:24:07,601 --> 01:24:09,040
sources?
Maybe.

1927
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:10,420
Maybe.
I mean,

1928
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:11,560
who knows yet that,
that,

1929
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:13,840
that uh,
unfortunately they just had the baby,

1930
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:16,960
you know,
that it's been invalid for a 20

1931
01:24:16,961 --> 01:24:18,490
something years.
That's crazy.

1932
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:20,390
Somebody,
somebody dr.

1933
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:25,490
F and I'm trying to.
Two thousand 11 chlamydia infections

1934
01:24:25,511 --> 01:24:27,400
amongst americans.
60 five and over.

1935
01:24:27,401 --> 01:24:31,210
Increased by 31 percent and syphilis by
52 percent.

1936
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:34,240
Yeah.
But the problem with that is 52 percent.

1937
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:35,123
All right.
Okay.

1938
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:40,170
Let's say there's 100 cases and then the
next year there's a 150.

1939
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:45,430
Alright.
That's 52 percent.

1940
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,310
No big tins of that $100.
Million?

1941
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,660
Yeah,
a million thousand.

1942
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,170
My dad's probably in their gun.
Come on baby.

1943
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:56,380
I'm going to buy some though.
I don't like the number of percent

1944
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,580
because if there's four people and then
the next year there's six.

1945
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:02,830
That's 50 percent increase.
And what I'm saying,

1946
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:04,810
I don't like numbers like that because
you could make.

1947
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,970
Oh my god,
it's an epidemic I want,

1948
01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:10,270
I want,
I want numbers like human beings.

1949
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:12,340
Yeah.
Well I'm sure it's out there on the web,

1950
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:14,890
but like I said,
my dad's probably thinks committee as a

1951
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:15,910
flower.
He's given me.

1952
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:20,080
He's given this girl,
I'm going to get you some ideas and

1953
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:21,340
we're going to have a good time.
Yeah,

1954
01:25:21,341 --> 01:25:23,380
there's no condoms in nursing homes.
You know,

1955
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:28,690
we got 3000 reported case of committee
among people.

1956
01:25:28,691 --> 01:25:29,800
40th five and older.
Okay.

1957
01:25:29,801 --> 01:25:32,590
But I'm 45 and older.
That's normal.

1958
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:35,450
Forty five and older people are walking
around meeting new people.

1959
01:25:36,410 --> 01:25:38,730
Forty 3000.
Seems like a very low number.

1960
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,180
Super low.
That's what I'm saying.

1961
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:44,380
That's why I don't like these percentage
numbers gonorrhea had see from doing

1962
01:25:44,381 --> 01:25:46,480
this podcast all these years.
I've.

1963
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:50,830
I understand when people can make things
seem greater than they really are.

1964
01:25:50,831 --> 01:25:51,690
Go back to that.
Jamie,

1965
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:54,060
do you have your arp card?
No,

1966
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:58,600
but someone set one to us to me and run
to the comedy store,

1967
01:25:58,601 --> 01:26:01,860
but I think that was some asshole
thousand.

1968
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:03,490
Sounds low.
Yeah.

1969
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,040
Primary and

1970
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,670
secondary syphilis.
Five thousand 650 cases were reported in

1971
01:26:07,671 --> 01:26:10,670
this age group.
40th five.

1972
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:15,470
The thing about 45 and older is 45 year
old people in 2019.

1973
01:26:15,471 --> 01:26:18,040
It's not like 45 year old people in tHe
sixties.

1974
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,330
Absolutely.
These animals are out there fucking

1975
01:26:20,331 --> 01:26:22,820
hitting the gym and doing squats and
flying to Thailand.

1976
01:26:22,821 --> 01:26:25,070
They're probably getting it from the
sweat on the gym bench.

1977
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:30,071
They could get staff.
I know a lady who almost died from staff

1978
01:26:30,681 --> 01:26:32,840
from the gym.
She ignored.

1979
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:37,250
She had some weird rash on her leg and
no one told her that it was a staph

1980
01:26:37,251 --> 01:26:40,090
infection and she.
She went into shock and had fucking

1981
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:45,050
seizures from staff and she's 36,
37.

1982
01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:47,660
She's fucking.
She's my wife's friend.

1983
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:49,280
That's crazy.
Dark shit.

1984
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:55,350
That dark dark staff from a gym.
That's why I don't go to the gym.

1985
01:26:55,850 --> 01:26:57,710
That's what I tell everybody.
no staff.

1986
01:26:57,770 --> 01:26:59,480
You've got to get it.
you go to go to the gym,

1987
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:01,050
dress like a superhero.
You got work,

1988
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:05,190
tights
going to call myself.

1989
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:10,730
Zero
cards and fucking spray and all the.

1990
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:14,050
All the chemicals everywhere.
Yeah.

1991
01:27:14,051 --> 01:27:17,530
Like two guns to spray guns in each hand
of alcoholic.

1992
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:19,610
She everything.
No,

1993
01:27:19,611 --> 01:27:20,210
I,
I,

1994
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:23,660
I like the spray gun with alcohol,
but it's one akila and one.

1995
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:27,710
So
do some fucking chin ups.

1996
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:29,930
One of the mouse.
Yeah.

1997
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,320
I've got staff twice from jujitsu.
Oh yeah?

1998
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:35,600
Yeah,
ringworm.

1999
01:27:35,601 --> 01:27:38,850
Three times.
At least staff twice and they'd be

2000
01:27:38,851 --> 01:27:41,020
wearing once.
It's rough ringworms.

2001
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,490
okay.
But ringworms basically athlete's foot.

2002
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:44,810
Do you know the same?
More or less?

2003
01:27:44,811 --> 01:27:45,261
Yeah.
You know,

2004
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:47,760
you piss on your feet to make athletes
foot go away.

2005
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:48,890
Yes.
Yeah.

2006
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:52,910
Girls go because girls can't aim with
their pis.

2007
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:54,110
No,
I can.

2008
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:59,230
I can help them grow this.
Pat did just coming up with this gas

2009
01:27:59,601 --> 01:28:00,440
monkey funnel.

2010
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:04,850
Remember the fundal thing that,
that they came up with the sheet.

2011
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:05,691
No.
Yeah,

2012
01:28:05,691 --> 01:28:09,170
there is a thing that girls can use.
They stuff in their crotch that they can

2013
01:28:09,171 --> 01:28:12,680
pee standing up.
I just think that's probably not very

2014
01:28:12,681 --> 01:28:16,760
sanitary.
Well you're in is not really unsanitary.

2015
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,940
It's not really that bad.
It's not a dangerous thing.

2016
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,940
Poking golden shoWer.
Maybe they haven't,

2017
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,090
but I wouldn't be scared of it.
Not scared to piss.

2018
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:27,350
They'd go.
ms dot rogan.

2019
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:32,410
This is don't pay till he gets home.
This is the thing about a jujitsu.

2020
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:35,690
You're so used to dude's sweating on
you.

2021
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:38,210
Like,
cause you're always looked.

2022
01:28:38,211 --> 01:28:40,010
Yeah.
I wouldn't like sweating like there was

2023
01:28:40,011 --> 01:28:41,630
one time,
just one time that I was.

2024
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,050
I was rolling with a friend of mine and
he got on top of me,

2025
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:46,880
mounted me,
and he was sweating in my fucking face,

2026
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:50,640
like his chest sweat was dripping in my
face and we were laughing about it.

2027
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:51,411
I was like,
dude,

2028
01:28:51,411 --> 01:28:53,570
what the fuck?
You're sweating in my mouth.

2029
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:56,150
Basically.
This is starting to get weird.

2030
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:58,130
Well,
it's just part of like learning how to

2031
01:28:58,131 --> 01:29:03,131
kill people,
deal with the of training for Texas.

2032
01:29:03,151 --> 01:29:04,550
We just use guns.
No,

2033
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:06,360
that's not true.
There's a lot of jujitsu schools in

2034
01:29:06,361 --> 01:29:08,070
tech.
I'm looking at the stats on the std

2035
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:11,940
thing for older people,
and this is an article I found said only

2036
01:29:11,941 --> 01:29:16,580
five percent of adults are using
medicare to take the std tests,

2037
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:20,010
so it could be way higher if you're just
not getting tested.

2038
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,180
It's way high.
They're like,

2039
01:29:21,181 --> 01:29:23,220
suck it up.
I was in Vietnam.

2040
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,400
Come on.
It's just a rash.

2041
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:28,590
Yeah,
I mean the thing is like who's trying to

2042
01:29:28,591 --> 01:29:31,560
stop these people?
Who stopped those people,

2043
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:32,730
they're going to die.
Let them,

2044
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,790
let them drop them.
I'd be going in there and passing out

2045
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:39,860
all kinds of lube and toys and get after
it math.

2046
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:41,460
No,
I wouldn't do that.

2047
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:44,630
Why not try it?
If you're going to try matthew,

2048
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:46,830
try when you're 90.
Yeah.

2049
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,140
That's an easy way out.
Well,

2050
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,280
it's not even a way out.
It's just a way forward.

2051
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:53,000
We gave uh,
these,

2052
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:54,960
uh,
ladies and my family,

2053
01:29:54,961 --> 01:29:57,360
uh,
weed for the first time when they turn

2054
01:29:58,250 --> 01:30:00,000
18 years old.
they've never done anything,

2055
01:30:00,001 --> 01:30:02,250
so we give them some brownies.
Wow.

2056
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:03,760
And uh,
we told don't,

2057
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:06,850
don't eat all the brownies at once,
just eat a little bits,

2058
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,000
wait an hour or so.
Yeah.

2059
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:10,110
You feel blah blah.
They're like,

2060
01:30:10,111 --> 01:30:10,890
well,
we're trying it.

2061
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:12,360
We don't feel anything.
We don't feel anything.

2062
01:30:12,361 --> 01:30:13,890
We don't feel anything.
Next thing you know,

2063
01:30:13,891 --> 01:30:16,050
it's like only an hour later and they've
made the whole pan.

2064
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:19,800
Now they think it's the greatest thing
since sliced bread.

2065
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:21,750
Like,
just bring brownies,

2066
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:24,990
thanksgiving dinner.
Just bring brownies,

2067
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:27,750
just bring brownies.
and they just like melt with the

2068
01:30:27,751 --> 01:30:28,584
universe.

2069
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,590
We just tricky in Texas though,
right?

2070
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,900
Yeah.
It's not legal yet.

2071
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:36,960
It's going to be.
I'm in California though.

2072
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:41,250
It's right here.
I got that elan musk trouble.

2073
01:30:41,251 --> 01:30:43,020
We'd.
What Is that?

2074
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:45,390
This is a,
this is what's called a,

2075
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:50,230
a blunt.
It's a tobacco on the outside and um,

2076
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:53,130
marijuana on the inside and nurtured the
car.

2077
01:30:53,330 --> 01:30:57,540
Shit dropped tesla stock six percent one
day.

2078
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:58,590
Oh my,
uh,

2079
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:02,520
my manager and pr person out there.
I just literally shitting their pants

2080
01:31:02,521 --> 01:31:04,740
right now.
But it's legal.

2081
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:05,630
Well,
it's legal here,

2082
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:07,320
right?
There you go.

2083
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:12,690
I believe in the law.
It's 100 percent legal.

2084
01:31:12,691 --> 01:31:16,140
Here
it is.

2085
01:31:16,141 --> 01:31:18,200
A hundred percent.
Who's the dude that I'm.

2086
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:21,060
Oh,
Mike Tyson just brought you some of his

2087
01:31:21,061 --> 01:31:24,240
weed.
Is that how it comes?

2088
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,820
This is the box of death and life right
here.

2089
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,280
Well,
mike tyson's box of death in life.

2090
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:30,270
Yeah.
Look,

2091
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:34,590
this is how hard Mike Tyson roles look
at the sides of these fucking joints he

2092
01:31:34,591 --> 01:31:37,470
gave me.
I know the camera's not gonna be able to

2093
01:31:37,471 --> 01:31:38,520
follow me,
but I'll be right back.

2094
01:31:38,521 --> 01:31:41,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
look at this shit.

2095
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:50,780
Look at the fucking size.
Oh,

2096
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,580
that's just insane.
That's you,

2097
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:54,300
bro.
I can't take that.

2098
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:59,480
I can't take it with you on the plane.
How do I get on the plane?

2099
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:03,880
Then you just think thinking you'll
appear in seat four c.

2100
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:09,810
That's the key.
I would recommend any meaning more than

2101
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,360
enough for me.
Alright,

2102
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,310
jamie,
we'll take one more.

2103
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:16,840
Yeah,
he gave me these joints that would make

2104
01:32:16,841 --> 01:32:20,350
you think about people you fingered in
highschool and want to find them on

2105
01:32:20,351 --> 01:32:24,790
facebook and apologize.
Just what is that?

2106
01:32:24,791 --> 01:32:27,400
That's a goddamn cigar of marijuana.
That's outrageous.

2107
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:32,260
That's tyson has a whole ranch.
He has a hole put in this new one.

2108
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:35,670
He has this uh,
uh,

2109
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,260
tyson ranch.
These growing marijuana and he's going

2110
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:42,920
to have like a resort desta destination
or he's going to have like fitness

2111
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:45,430
classes,
like tip toe through the tulips.

2112
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:49,090
Exactly
who this you'll live.

2113
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:54,580
He's um,
he's got a place down in palm beach.

2114
01:32:54,581 --> 01:32:56,080
Where was it?
PAlm springs,

2115
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:57,580
palm springs,
palm springs,

2116
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:59,860
palm beach in Florida,
palm springs,

2117
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:03,370
California out in the desert.
They're developing this enormous

2118
01:33:03,371 --> 01:33:06,430
property where they're going to grow
weed and they're also going to have this

2119
01:33:06,431 --> 01:33:09,640
huge place where people can go and have
this resort,

2120
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:11,560
like a weed amusement park.
Literally,

2121
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:14,560
they're going to have concerts there,
like coachella type events,

2122
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:16,780
what do they call it,
the kush fest or some shit

2123
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:23,630
fucking around the people.
People behind it have deep pockets and

2124
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:27,790
they're going hard because what people
have seen in Colorado and people are

2125
01:33:27,791 --> 01:33:30,360
starting to see in Washington state and
now in California,

2126
01:33:30,390 --> 01:33:33,940
there's just an enormous amount of money
involved in marijuana,

2127
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:35,710
like crazy,
ridiculous,

2128
01:33:35,711 --> 01:33:36,544
silly profit.

2129
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:39,790
If you're doing it and you're taxing it
and you're doing it responsibly.

2130
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:42,070
The way I look at it,
it's no different than going to the

2131
01:33:42,071 --> 01:33:45,070
store to buy beer.
It's all combined too much beer and do

2132
01:33:45,071 --> 01:33:48,400
something stupid.
We've had four shots in an hour on a

2133
01:33:48,401 --> 01:33:50,910
radio show.
I have a driver driver.

2134
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,380
That's good.
That's the way to do it responsibly.

2135
01:33:53,710 --> 01:33:55,190
That's right.
I mean,

2136
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:57,460
owning,
owning a tequila company in,

2137
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:57,930
in,
uh,

2138
01:33:57,930 --> 01:34:00,010
in bars and restaurants.
You kind of have to.

2139
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:02,200
Yeah.
It takes the fun out of it because I'm a

2140
01:34:02,201 --> 01:34:03,190
driver.
I'm a car guy.

2141
01:34:03,191 --> 01:34:05,350
Everything else.
But yeah,

2142
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:07,570
but be responsible.
Always be responsible.

2143
01:34:07,810 --> 01:34:08,710
And the,
you know,

2144
01:34:08,711 --> 01:34:13,030
the thing is also
if you are a person who likes fun,

2145
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:17,920
like what are you trying to stop fun?
Like if someone's To smoke a little

2146
01:34:17,921 --> 01:34:19,570
weed,
have a little tequila,

2147
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:20,740
drink a couple of beers.

2148
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:22,960
You should.
Is that unless people are being

2149
01:34:22,961 --> 01:34:23,920
responsible.
Yeah.

2150
01:34:23,921 --> 01:34:27,610
I don't see a drastic difference between
the alcohol or marijuana.

2151
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:31,720
As long as you're obeying the laws being
responsible for paying your taxes.

2152
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:33,370
Yes.
I 100 percent agree.

2153
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:37,210
I also talk about it this way.
Imagine if all the people in the world,

2154
01:34:37,211 --> 01:34:41,350
but you,
me and jamie and if jamie had decided

2155
01:34:41,351 --> 01:34:45,130
that he.
He thought that we were criminals and

2156
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:48,040
we're not allowed to drink alcohol
anymore.

2157
01:34:48,041 --> 01:34:51,700
Jamie's getting installed prohibition in
our small community.

2158
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:53,290
He'll be ridiculous.
We would be like,

2159
01:34:53,291 --> 01:34:56,590
fuck you man.
Well that's literally like the

2160
01:34:56,591 --> 01:34:58,820
government telling you you can't do
mushrooms.

2161
01:34:58,870 --> 01:35:00,740
Are the government telling you you can't
smoke weed?

2162
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:05,340
Like it's just a grown man telling other
grown men they can.

2163
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:07,880
Based on what?
It's not based on what we voted on.

2164
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:11,390
Like if people really knew the
information involved in the safety of

2165
01:35:11,391 --> 01:35:12,560
marijuana,
does it freak you out?

2166
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,040
Yeah,
of course it does because it makes you

2167
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:18,350
paranoid 100 percent.
But does alcohol make you an asshole?

2168
01:35:18,351 --> 01:35:19,960
Fuck yes it does.
Oh Yeah,

2169
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:21,890
but do I think that everybody should
have all of it?

2170
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:26,780
Cbs rejects superbowl that based on the
benefits of medical marijuana.

2171
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:30,530
Well,
In their defense there's probably a

2172
01:35:30,531 --> 01:35:34,370
bunch of people or stockholders and
there's a lot of decisions that are made

2173
01:35:34,371 --> 01:35:38,030
that are made by lawyers.
I just want it just before people get

2174
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:40,370
angry about something that cbs decided
to do.

2175
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:45,580
You have to understand the cbs is
responsible for the employment of untold

2176
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:49,370
thousands of human beings.
They're going to have bud light ads

2177
01:35:49,371 --> 01:35:51,690
right next to this.
They will or whatever they will.

2178
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:53,180
They will,
but bud light,

2179
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:56,000
bud light ads are not going to affect
anyone's bottom line.

2180
01:35:56,150 --> 01:35:58,190
I dOn't agree.
I don't agree,

2181
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:00,020
but I just want people to understand
that.

2182
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:04,550
Part of the problem is that the business
aspect of this has not been fully

2183
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:06,530
established.
Once it's fully established,

2184
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:10,310
cbs and all these people are going to
realize it isn't any different than bud

2185
01:36:10,311 --> 01:36:12,200
light.
It's not any different than anything you

2186
01:36:12,201 --> 01:36:15,740
can get fucked up on bud light if you
just drink 20 of them,

2187
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:18,590
you can get fucked up.
You could walk inTo trees,

2188
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:19,580
you do it on,
you know,

2189
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:21,310
cough medicine or what else?
Oh,

2190
01:36:21,311 --> 01:36:22,570
that stuff's out there.
anything.

2191
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:24,740
I mean,
how many pharmaceutical drugs can you

2192
01:36:24,741 --> 01:36:27,650
get fucked up on and do we deny that
some people love,

2193
01:36:27,651 --> 01:36:30,740
like serious injuries benefit greatly
from pain pills?

2194
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:32,150
No,
they definitely do.

2195
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,660
The thing about it at all,
all is you got to be honest and let

2196
01:36:35,661 --> 01:36:39,260
people form their own opinions.
and part of being honest about it,

2197
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:42,440
about these things is tell them the pros
and the cons.

2198
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:47,000
Everything has a pro and a con including
whole people banging it out and nursing

2199
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:49,350
home.
Exactly.

2200
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:51,120
Getting committee,
uh,

2201
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,690
you know,
that's not good.

2202
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:53,380
The,
the,

2203
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:56,720
the pro and the con is my dad's a pro
banging old ladies in nursing home,

2204
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:00,380
but the con is he's probably got some
stuff on his little winter down there,

2205
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:04,310
probably passing some biological
footballs,

2206
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:06,680
but he's not getting pregnant.
Yeah,

2207
01:37:06,681 --> 01:37:09,770
he's not getting pregnant.
No one's getting pregnant and listen

2208
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:11,180
folks,
people get colds.

2209
01:37:11,181 --> 01:37:13,670
TheY get the flu.
all sorts of weird things happen when

2210
01:37:13,671 --> 01:37:17,150
people corral around are the people.
What are we supposed to live like john

2211
01:37:17,151 --> 01:37:20,410
travolta and the boy in the plastic
bubble and fucking lock ourselves in

2212
01:37:20,570 --> 01:37:23,480
hermetically sealed chambers and never
touch each other again.

2213
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:27,320
Get the fuck out of this true.
Just take your penicillin back it off,

2214
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:29,390
but that's what napoleon did.
Walk up.

2215
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:33,680
Gladys,
I think you might've given him a thing

2216
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,480
or two.
Just hit the massengill.

2217
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:36,920
You'll be good.
I wonder.

2218
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:40,370
I wonder who's delivering these venereal
diseases.

2219
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:42,440
It's like,
that would be fascinating if we found it

2220
01:37:42,441 --> 01:37:46,370
was primarily women.
It was like 78 percent of women are the

2221
01:37:46,371 --> 01:37:49,310
original source of the venereal disease.
Well,

2222
01:37:49,311 --> 01:37:50,450
they pulled the apple down,
right?

2223
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:54,530
I don't believe that happened.
I think there was a bitch ass man who

2224
01:37:54,531 --> 01:37:59,531
blamed it on the chick
when I heard that adam and eve story.

2225
01:38:00,631 --> 01:38:01,500
I was like,
yeah,

2226
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:03,930
right.
Maybe adam was a bitch.

2227
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:07,560
She blamed it on eve and he wrote,
he was the guy who could write.

2228
01:38:07,561 --> 01:38:10,830
So he wrote things down.
He was like either drop a and do shit.

2229
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:14,550
I'm a good listener.
He probably ate the apple first.

2230
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:17,030
I probably gave it to eve.
You know,

2231
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,720
history is written by the winners.

2232
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:21,900
This is correct.
And a lot of women just to let that shit

2233
01:38:21,901 --> 01:38:23,490
go.
Let them talk.

2234
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:25,950
Yeah.
Right down the night that I will fuck

2235
01:38:25,951 --> 01:38:26,640
you.
And he's like,

2236
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,490
fuck you.
And adam and eve,

2237
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:31,650
I don't see adam and eve having that New
York accent

2238
01:38:33,630 --> 01:38:35,340
where they get it in New York.
Wasn't there yet.

2239
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:38,970
I feel like adam and eve would talk like
british people because anytime they have

2240
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:41,490
a movie where people talk like old
timey,

2241
01:38:41,491 --> 01:38:42,780
whether it's gladiator,
whatever.

2242
01:38:42,781 --> 01:38:45,330
Everyone talks with an english accent.
Do you ever notice that?

2243
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:48,870
If we have to,
right?

2244
01:38:48,871 --> 01:38:50,450
If we have to,
uh,

2245
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:52,680
there's like the suspension of
disbelief.

2246
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,110
Like we don't know,
latin and latin,

2247
01:38:55,111 --> 01:38:56,610
who the fuck knows?
That sounded like.

2248
01:38:56,611 --> 01:38:57,960
Right.
So when,

2249
01:38:57,961 --> 01:39:01,710
when you watching some old ass movie
about people talking lot and they'll

2250
01:39:01,711 --> 01:39:04,170
speak english,
but they'll speak it with an english

2251
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:05,810
accent.
Right.

2252
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:10,190
That only speak proper.
They always have some weird old timey

2253
01:39:10,490 --> 01:39:13,290
movie.
What's ever watched the movie otherwise?

2254
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:14,790
Right.
But you.

2255
01:39:14,791 --> 01:39:16,260
Right.
But why is that?

2256
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:19,030
Because it's got to make it watchable.
That's why they ruined stories.

2257
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:23,640
What t two english people is that played
out like eleanor's are played out to

2258
01:39:23,641 --> 01:39:24,640
him.
Do you know what I'm saying?

2259
01:39:24,650 --> 01:39:26,250
Absolutely.
Like to english people,

2260
01:39:26,251 --> 01:39:28,950
they hear that accent every day.
That's a normal accent.

2261
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:30,420
But to us it's like,
oh,

2262
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:32,680
this is like an old timey language.
Hangul.

2263
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:36,540
Why is russell crowe talking like he's
from fucking london?

2264
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:37,770
This is bullshit.
Yeah.

2265
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:40,620
I got a friend of mine,
a big chris,

2266
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:44,160
and he likes to say,
well we invented the english language

2267
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:45,021
and I'm like,
yeah,

2268
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:46,100
and he fucked it up.
Yeah,

2269
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:48,090
you guys made it so that people don't
understand it.

2270
01:39:48,091 --> 01:39:49,770
That's stupid.
That's not smart.

2271
01:39:49,771 --> 01:39:50,640
We've made it better.

2272
01:39:50,730 --> 01:39:54,000
We really did.
I just say that my rebuttal to him was

2273
01:39:54,001 --> 01:39:54,511
like,
oh yeah,

2274
01:39:54,511 --> 01:39:58,380
well somebody from your town still
trying to be a rapper in their defense

2275
01:39:58,381 --> 01:40:00,630
though,
they will always say to you like,

2276
01:40:00,631 --> 01:40:01,560
yeah,
but listen,

2277
01:40:01,561 --> 01:40:04,320
you guys respect our language more than
you respect yours.

2278
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:06,570
And it's true.
Like american english is not as

2279
01:40:06,571 --> 01:40:10,620
respectable as english english because
that's why they use those english people

2280
01:40:10,621 --> 01:40:13,500
to sell like late night mops and shit.
Right.

2281
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,980
Call me dude.
They fucking nonstick frying pans.

2282
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:19,590
It's always some man with a proper
accent.

2283
01:40:19,730 --> 01:40:22,290
You look at this,
I can just find these eggs and they

2284
01:40:22,291 --> 01:40:26,210
slide right onto the plate.
Believable.

2285
01:40:26,830 --> 01:40:29,250
Throw back a nickels in there and
scratch it up.

2286
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,390
Nope,
not a scratch.

2287
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:34,080
If that was a guy from jersey that was
selling you that you'd be like,

2288
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:38,750
look at this asshole trying to lie to me
about his bullshit frying pan right.

2289
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:43,260
And his fucking shitty mop.
But something about like english accents

2290
01:40:43,261 --> 01:40:46,110
get us foR sure.
They have a better.

2291
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:48,810
They have a more respectable version of
our language,

2292
01:40:48,811 --> 01:40:51,210
but our sounds better.
You could say it easier.

2293
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,010
I understand it.
They understand us.

2294
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:56,650
We don't always understand them.
That was lIterally just on a phone call

2295
01:40:56,651 --> 01:40:57,484
with a,
uh,

2296
01:40:57,490 --> 01:41:01,900
a lady in europe before I got in here
and I couldn't understand a word she was

2297
01:41:01,901 --> 01:41:03,080
saying.
The thing is though,

2298
01:41:03,081 --> 01:41:04,940
here's where I'm wrong,
here's where I'm wrong.

2299
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:07,580
They understand each other.
They fucking,

2300
01:41:07,850 --> 01:41:11,180
they'll start.
I was in belfast,

2301
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:15,380
northern Ireland,
which is mind will be in the cantina

2302
01:41:15,381 --> 01:41:18,260
scene in star wars.
These motherfuckers,

2303
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:22,370
they barely speak english.
They speak english for sure.

2304
01:41:22,371 --> 01:41:24,050
They understand each other a 100
percent.

2305
01:41:24,051 --> 01:41:26,630
But to me,
I was talking to this guy and he was

2306
01:41:26,631 --> 01:41:28,050
drunk out of his fucking mind.

2307
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,290
We were drinking dark beer.
just me and this dude,

2308
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:34,250
this is like early 2003,
early ufc,

2309
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:36,080
ufc in dublin.
I all,

2310
01:41:36,081 --> 01:41:38,270
I remember this guy saying how to fight
any man.

2311
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:40,910
He was hammered.
How tiny man,

2312
01:41:41,030 --> 01:41:42,910
I'm telling you,
your child and your fucking.

2313
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:45,600
Show them how.
Show them right now.

2314
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:49,160
He says to him,
he was making perfect sense.

2315
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:53,150
All I caught was I'll fight any man.
This motherfucker might've said that a

2316
01:41:53,151 --> 01:41:55,910
hundred times and just kept buying
drinks.

2317
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,800
Hammered with me.
And some dude from belfast,

2318
01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:01,130
we will.
You understood lIke 20 percent of what

2319
01:42:01,131 --> 01:42:04,880
each other was saying.
You got to use the translate thing on

2320
01:42:04,881 --> 01:42:06,170
your phone.
WoulDn't work.

2321
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:08,030
I'd fight anyone.
Oh,

2322
01:42:08,031 --> 01:42:08,980
what is this color?

2323
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:14,410
This guy?
You're saying,

2324
01:42:14,411 --> 01:42:15,590
whoa,
you skipped to kill.

2325
01:42:15,740 --> 01:42:20,240
This guy is simply going to fight me
to the hospital.

2326
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:22,910
You'd be puttIng off to the side if he
like,

2327
01:42:22,930 --> 01:42:24,400
it ain't finished.
But if you're promoting,

2328
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,080
pause it.
Now.

2329
01:42:26,081 --> 01:42:29,110
Imagine being hammered.
Post ufc event,

2330
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:32,770
trying to mingle with the locals were
drinking dark beer and whiskey.

2331
01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:38,010
There's maybe 30 people around me that
are yelling like that and I'm talking to

2332
01:42:38,561 --> 01:42:40,390
this dude.
So all the people around me,

2333
01:42:40,391 --> 01:42:44,320
who are you drunk?
No one knew.

2334
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:46,150
No one knew what anybody next to him was
saying.

2335
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:49,120
Everybody's loud and hammered and this
guy is fucked up.

2336
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:50,310
And he's telling me this.
How did.

2337
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:51,173
Hi,
my name's john.

2338
01:42:51,410 --> 01:42:52,300
And I'm like,
okay,

2339
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:55,300
you go fight him.
That's so funny.

2340
01:42:55,930 --> 01:42:58,030
We've.
We've put up this video before that

2341
01:42:58,031 --> 01:43:01,670
exact guy video a long time ago.
He.

2342
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:04,050
What is this one was really old.
You talking about this?

2343
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:07,330
Me telling me about this guy
right here,

2344
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:16,100
eight years ago or some shit.
What is that from right at the same time

2345
01:43:16,510 --> 01:43:19,470
from an old.
There's two things going on in the

2346
01:43:19,471 --> 01:43:20,790
background.
Did you hear it?

2347
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:25,200
Damn,
I had a beard back then.

2348
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,970
That's the same guy.
That's hilarious.

2349
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:29,010
Now that's like pikey language,
right?

2350
01:43:29,550 --> 01:43:30,400
Yeah.
I guess.

2351
01:43:30,401 --> 01:43:32,510
I mean it says you.
The first video I pulled up the study

2352
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,570
was from.
I think I typed in belfast or something,

2353
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:36,710
but here's the thIng,
here's where I'm wrong.

2354
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:39,140
They fucking understand each other 100
percent.

2355
01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:42,940
They understand every word they say so
wrong.

2356
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:45,020
I just.
I'm just not in that environment.

2357
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,530
What do you hang out and you'll get it.
It's got a flavor though.

2358
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:50,990
They have a flavor that we don't have,
right?

2359
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:55,370
It's a dark old world flavor.
Hey listen mate,

2360
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:59,300
that's fucking dude who just came over
on a boat and shooting arrows at people.

2361
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:04,630
They kept that same language
and they're always looking to fIght out

2362
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:08,120
of fucking fight homeready.
Oh,

2363
01:44:08,121 --> 01:44:12,290
I'm sure you get a bunch of that shit.
I'm a pretty friendly guy,

2364
01:44:12,350 --> 01:44:14,000
so most,
most of that stuff.

2365
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:18,110
I don't get the guys that I get are
people that want to be like professional

2366
01:44:18,111 --> 01:44:21,020
fighters and then want to just talk
about it a little bit and they're always

2367
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:24,980
very friendly.
You'd be amazed like people that aspire

2368
01:44:24,981 --> 01:44:28,640
to be professional fighters are some of
the nicest fucking human beings you're

2369
01:44:28,641 --> 01:44:32,840
ever gonna run across because they've.
They've figured out their own ego

2370
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:36,020
through competition to the point where
they're not really.

2371
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:37,910
They're not.
They're not worried about like putting

2372
01:44:37,911 --> 01:44:39,110
out an image.
They know who they are.

2373
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:40,580
Correct,
and they were like real friendly,

2374
01:44:40,850 --> 01:44:44,420
like some of the nicest people that have
ever met ever a professional fighters.

2375
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:48,680
That's a weird thing for people to hear,
but I think that for men there's

2376
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:54,070
something about trial through combat and
just just be just being understanding

2377
01:44:54,471 --> 01:44:56,180
like what,
what it's like to overcome,

2378
01:44:56,181 --> 01:45:00,410
like an insurmountable obstacles for the
average person just makes them calmer.

2379
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:03,290
There's a different kind of human.
The more chill

2380
01:45:03,990 --> 01:45:08,390
they are.
My or not my hairdresser for 15 years

2381
01:45:08,410 --> 01:45:11,440
been cutting my hair.
He probably don't have this problem I'm

2382
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:14,820
used to.
It was a real struggle.

2383
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:19,480
He's a,
he's a bald head and he's a fighter and

2384
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:24,710
you trust them.
I wouldn't take my and he's a fighter

2385
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:29,730
and he's going to give me a z.
Some muscles is shit like hacking away

2386
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:31,080
with my head.
I'm like,

2387
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:34,650
this is not really trustworthy at all.
Yeah,

2388
01:45:34,651 --> 01:45:35,690
there was a video out there.

2389
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:37,160
Someone showed me.
Was it you?

2390
01:45:37,190 --> 01:45:39,680
Did you show me jamie?
Some of the,

2391
01:45:39,681 --> 01:45:40,580
the,
the uh,

2392
01:45:40,581 --> 01:45:43,480
I didn't even ask me what it was for us.
The drunk we are,

2393
01:45:43,910 --> 01:45:45,380
um,
someone took a phone,

2394
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,580
we had a sound like a hair cutter and
it,

2395
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:53,790
and they run It by people's heads.
I never run away and people freak out on

2396
01:45:53,791 --> 01:45:54,360
them.
Oh,

2397
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:56,820
there's nothing wrong with that.
They've run it up the back of a girl's

2398
01:45:56,821 --> 01:45:58,220
head.
It's a good practical joke.

2399
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:00,000
I mean,
it'd be way better with a real razor.

2400
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:02,910
So main would be.
But that's a,

2401
01:46:02,911 --> 01:46:05,550
that's a big deal for people can be
cutting off their hair.

2402
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:07,320
So yeah,
I've always wanted to shave my head at

2403
01:46:07,321 --> 01:46:10,380
least once in life and I never just get
a crew cut.

2404
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,040
You're a beautiful man.
Thank you.

2405
01:46:12,041 --> 01:46:13,530
Perfect.
Shaved head,

2406
01:46:13,531 --> 01:46:15,260
you've got a nice thick head of hair.
Yeah.

2407
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:16,051
No,
but,

2408
01:46:16,051 --> 01:46:17,940
uh,
now know contracts with crap.

2409
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:18,880
They tell you what,
whoa,

2410
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:19,370
whoa,
whoa.

2411
01:46:19,370 --> 01:46:22,500
Got to keep the same style man.
Continuity really?

2412
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,750
Which I kind of called continuity
because it's like,

2413
01:46:24,930 --> 01:46:27,990
do these people really believe I just
did this in an hour or was it over the

2414
01:46:27,991 --> 01:46:29,090
course of a few days?

2415
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:32,130
Okay.
Well I'll just tell him.

2416
01:46:32,131 --> 01:46:34,530
I'm like,
what do y'all think as,

2417
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:37,440
as,
as producers and networks and whatever,

2418
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:40,080
how,
how bad the I think the american public

2419
01:46:40,081 --> 01:46:40,920
is.
I mean,

2420
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:45,060
how unintelligent that You have to do a
scene where I just walked in your door

2421
01:46:45,061 --> 01:46:48,630
and sat down here and put on my
headphones and then they flipped me over

2422
01:46:48,631 --> 01:46:49,950
somewhere going,
you asshole.

2423
01:46:49,970 --> 01:46:51,840
I walked in the door and put on my
headphones.

2424
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:55,630
I mean,
it's so insane and it's like,

2425
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:57,900
it's like the recipe.
It's like you have to tell them

2426
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:01,350
everything you do and then I set up for
the shot and I have to walk out the

2427
01:47:01,351 --> 01:47:02,184
door.
They're like,

2428
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:03,420
well,
the audience won't know where you came

2429
01:47:03,421 --> 01:47:05,130
from.
it's my fucking shop.

2430
01:47:05,131 --> 01:47:07,050
I'm here.
What do you mean

2431
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:11,010
they won't have any idea?
That would be so confused.

2432
01:47:11,190 --> 01:47:14,640
It's insane and I've tried so hard to
change the recipe a little bit.

2433
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:17,280
I understand you have to do certain
things,

2434
01:47:17,281 --> 01:47:19,680
but why do you have to tell the audience
what they just saw?

2435
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:22,890
Period.
You're noT stupid.

2436
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:24,810
You.
If you make them stupid,

2437
01:47:24,811 --> 01:47:27,690
you can make them stupid.
You'd never challenge him ever.

2438
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:30,450
I think that as a society we might be on
our way to that.

2439
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:31,500
What?
What was that show?

2440
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:35,610
Idiotic.
Because I argued all the time.

2441
01:47:35,611 --> 01:47:37,530
I love my show and I love what we do,
but I'm like,

2442
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:40,880
why do I got to come out of the door,
put my headphones on and then go.

2443
01:47:41,130 --> 01:47:43,020
So I got there and I put my headphones
on.

2444
01:47:43,070 --> 01:47:45,810
It was unbelievable,
especially after I came through the

2445
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:50,130
door,
so fucking stupid,

2446
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:53,130
but they've always done it that way and
I think of it at the same way.

2447
01:47:53,131 --> 01:47:55,470
I think about cbs and their medical
marijuana ads.

2448
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,470
There's like a bunch of people that are
just trying to protect jobs.

2449
01:47:58,780 --> 01:48:00,240
They're just like,
we're going to make it easier,

2450
01:48:00,270 --> 01:48:03,660
easier for people to know.
You can't have anything left to chance.

2451
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:06,330
The,
the kinda filled her numbers where they

2452
01:48:06,350 --> 01:48:09,390
had such a bad thing that they can't
show that commercial,

2453
01:48:09,391 --> 01:48:13,410
but at the same time we're selling boxes
that say this will kill you.

2454
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:14,730
Yeah,
exactly.

2455
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:18,870
And people are buying them.
Why do you think they still break up

2456
01:48:18,871 --> 01:48:21,990
shows with commercials?
Wouldn't it be more effective if they

2457
01:48:21,991 --> 01:48:24,390
didn't do that?
It's just a monetization problem,

2458
01:48:24,391 --> 01:48:27,240
I'm sure,
but I think you could get a little more

2459
01:48:27,241 --> 01:48:29,950
bang for your buck by having this
episode bias.

2460
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:33,690
So instead of a 100 percent,
not only that,

2461
01:48:33,691 --> 01:48:37,380
I think they,
instead of having like two or three ads

2462
01:48:37,381 --> 01:48:40,170
every five minutes or whatever they make
it do.

2463
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:42,600
How about you just have a couple of
product placements?

2464
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:44,790
Correct.
Show and have them cost more.

2465
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:48,270
Exactly what you put in the.
Then you got to put it into the recipe.

2466
01:48:48,271 --> 01:48:51,900
So some guy like us,
it's car guys that are watching the show

2467
01:48:51,901 --> 01:48:53,160
and I'm like,
holy shit.

2468
01:48:53,161 --> 01:48:56,070
He just bought that porsche and then it
goes commercial and it's like I'm

2469
01:48:56,071 --> 01:48:59,490
getting a beer and I'm going to sit back
down on the couch and in the next five

2470
01:48:59,491 --> 01:49:02,940
minutes has been going.
So I went to la and I bought a porsche.

2471
01:49:04,130 --> 01:49:07,110
You already wasted that guy's tie.
Exactly.

2472
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:10,110
Exactly.
And the only reason we have to do It,

2473
01:49:10,111 --> 01:49:13,830
because you imagine that people are
coming in from these breaks,

2474
01:49:14,190 --> 01:49:17,010
it just jumping in the middle of it and
might,

2475
01:49:17,070 --> 01:49:19,920
they might be doing that.
How about make them figure it out,

2476
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:21,900
figure it out,
bitch.

2477
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,880
Well,
figuring out what they need to get rid

2478
01:49:23,881 --> 01:49:26,310
of the nielsen whole bullshit.
I mean,

2479
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:28,440
does that real?
They're still counting cable boxes.

2480
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:31,090
Are they even counting cable boxes and
not doing anything?

2481
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:32,490
You have a nielsen box,
right?

2482
01:49:32,491 --> 01:49:35,640
So it's not even like cable box.
There's only like a few thousand or

2483
01:49:35,641 --> 01:49:37,770
whatever.
And then they decide what the rating is

2484
01:49:37,771 --> 01:49:38,660
and it's like,
are you kidding me?

2485
01:49:38,661 --> 01:49:40,050
Because I'll see you in my ratings.
And I'm like,

2486
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:43,400
I know it was more than that on the
energy company,

2487
01:49:43,401 --> 01:49:44,610
you know?
So,

2488
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,320
uh,
I own a social media company.

2489
01:49:46,321 --> 01:49:47,170
I'm like,
oh,

2490
01:49:47,171 --> 01:49:48,050
we had way more than

2491
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:50,920
that.
I wonder how they do really know and

2492
01:49:50,921 --> 01:49:53,860
whether they just accept the fact that
even if they don't know the real

2493
01:49:53,861 --> 01:49:56,710
numbers,
at least they have a reliable percentage

2494
01:49:56,711 --> 01:50:00,010
that everyone can agree on.
The problem that everyone agrees on it,

2495
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:01,840
they'll,
they'll set their advertising rates

2496
01:50:01,841 --> 01:50:06,841
based on that agreement more or less.
But the real ideology of it is we have

2497
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:12,790
the access because all these devices and
everything else to have the real number,

2498
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:13,870
right?
Like the real,

2499
01:50:13,871 --> 01:50:16,090
real number.
But everyone will have to give it up,

2500
01:50:16,091 --> 01:50:18,730
right?
Like verizon would have to give it up

2501
01:50:18,850 --> 01:50:20,980
and then I'm going to give it to each
other and they want to say,

2502
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:23,680
yeah,
I think they just need to remap the

2503
01:50:23,681 --> 01:50:27,610
program and so they can really see how
many people there are.

2504
01:50:27,611 --> 01:50:31,870
Because right now in the industry and
people think the viewers are way down

2505
01:50:31,871 --> 01:50:33,790
and I actually tend to disagree.

2506
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:37,950
I think they're up just the way that we
count them or bad debt.

2507
01:50:38,020 --> 01:50:43,020
It's definitely not good because I've
never been counted fucking filled out a

2508
01:50:43,991 --> 01:50:46,720
nielsen thing.
I've never used the nielsen box.

2509
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:48,790
I don't know anybody who has I need to
do.

2510
01:50:48,791 --> 01:50:49,580
I,
you know,

2511
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:50,930
I met with.
I met one boy.

2512
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:53,530
You'd once said that his brother was
like,

2513
01:50:53,650 --> 01:50:55,630
can you find a picture of the nielsen
box?

2514
01:50:56,130 --> 01:51:00,010
Just like you know that directv has some
numbers,

2515
01:51:00,011 --> 01:51:02,080
right?
They must have some digitaL.

2516
01:51:02,081 --> 01:51:04,080
Hell yeah.
They got numbers down to the way.

2517
01:51:04,081 --> 01:51:06,550
Why wouldn't they know?
Even if they're not using it as some

2518
01:51:06,551 --> 01:51:10,090
sort of a rating system that affects the
ratings of a television show,

2519
01:51:10,091 --> 01:51:13,690
you would think that they would want to
know how effective their product is.

2520
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:17,200
If you can measure that,
why wouldn't you measure that and

2521
01:51:17,201 --> 01:51:19,780
they've just never changed it.
They really do need to though.

2522
01:51:20,050 --> 01:51:22,600
It'd be way cool if they did.
It would be weird.

2523
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:25,060
Be weird if you find out what everybody
was watching.

2524
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:26,620
What if like keeping up with the
kardashians,

2525
01:51:26,621 --> 01:51:28,380
like a billion people in episode.

2526
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:35,740
most of the world is going,
what the fuck?

2527
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:37,000
Yeah,
exactly.

2528
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:39,460
Actually the world is still.
It looks at and goes,

2529
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,690
what the fuck?
Yeah.

2530
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:43,450
But what if most of the world,
what if you know what?

2531
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:48,570
What do you think is like the biggest
disparity has gotta be it's gotta be

2532
01:51:50,411 --> 01:51:51,730
satellite and cable.
Right?

2533
01:51:51,731 --> 01:51:53,530
Because they don't.
They're not aLlowed to measure those.

2534
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:57,970
The mobile phone thing,
like mobile phones or they say netflix

2535
01:51:58,120 --> 01:51:59,650
specials,
like comedy specials.

2536
01:51:59,790 --> 01:52:01,870
they said 40 something percent of
people.

2537
01:52:01,871 --> 01:52:04,020
Plus watch them on their phones.
Yeah,

2538
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:07,810
I mean I've started to watch everything
on my ipad and my phone.

2539
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:12,960
I don't really watch tv anymore.
I watched the ufc on my phone on espn

2540
01:52:13,301 --> 01:52:15,400
plus I was like,
wow,

2541
01:52:15,401 --> 01:52:17,740
this is crazy.
I'm watching live fights on my phone

2542
01:52:17,741 --> 01:52:19,170
with a regular connection.
Not,

2543
01:52:19,210 --> 01:52:22,000
not wifi.
This is a weird time.

2544
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:22,630
Yeah.

2545
01:52:22,630 --> 01:52:26,470
I remember when we were younger,
we spent thousands of dollars for the

2546
01:52:26,471 --> 01:52:30,550
giant tv.
When the box it had the projectors.

2547
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:33,200
Well,
the thing about the phone is this kind

2548
01:52:33,201 --> 01:52:35,830
of selfish.
It's like personal,

2549
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:38,020
like if you're watching a movie on your
phone,

2550
01:52:38,021 --> 01:52:39,690
it's just you watching that movie.
Yeah.

2551
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:41,770
You're not going to get.
You can't like sit next to your wife and

2552
01:52:41,771 --> 01:52:44,620
watch a movie on your phone.
No one's going to deal with that.

2553
01:52:44,621 --> 01:52:46,310
Even if you're on a plane,
that would suck.

2554
01:52:46,730 --> 01:52:50,180
Exactly.
but watching a fight on the phone is

2555
01:52:50,181 --> 01:52:52,340
like,
it's way less interesting than watching

2556
01:52:52,341 --> 01:52:54,260
it on the big screen,
but you can take it everywhere,

2557
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:59,290
so eventually they're going to get that
into some large thing like a hologram or

2558
01:52:59,511 --> 01:53:00,470
some shit.
That's what I.

2559
01:53:00,471 --> 01:53:04,700
Or ar augmented reality.
It's not going to be too much longer

2560
01:53:04,701 --> 01:53:08,600
before they're doing all the ai and
augmented reality I think is really

2561
01:53:08,601 --> 01:53:08,860
what's.

2562
01:53:08,860 --> 01:53:10,700
What's interesting to me.
Wait,

2563
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:14,200
netflix doing something with that right
now with that one show they have out or

2564
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:17,090
you can pick the different endings.
Oh yeah,

2565
01:53:17,140 --> 01:53:17,973
yeah.
The

2566
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:21,160
black mirror show.
Yeah.

2567
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:24,440
Yeah.
We go back to that article again.

2568
01:53:24,441 --> 01:53:26,290
What was the kind of new articles saying
that.

2569
01:53:26,291 --> 01:53:28,240
An example of one I was going to say
like that.

2570
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:30,710
So the tvs are there,
have been known to.

2571
01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:33,620
They would screen.
They watch what's on your screen and

2572
01:53:33,621 --> 01:53:38,270
send that data back to a database based
off of like everything that's currently

2573
01:53:38,271 --> 01:53:40,220
live on tv.
It's the same thing happens with audio

2574
01:53:40,221 --> 01:53:43,970
streams and shizam or like there's a
couple of different companies that do

2575
01:53:43,971 --> 01:53:45,710
that.
So they sell your data?

2576
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:48,290
Yeah.
Then so that they'll sell that back to

2577
01:53:48,291 --> 01:53:51,290
advertisers sort of like the same way.
What's happening with some of these

2578
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:52,393
apps.
That's how that.

2579
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:56,330
That's how people found out that
companies are tracking you because

2580
01:53:56,331 --> 01:53:59,210
there's third party companies that are
selling that data once they have it

2581
01:53:59,211 --> 01:54:01,070
because they don't,
they don't need it for everything.

2582
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:04,730
See the person with the problem with
this kind of shit with people is that

2583
01:54:04,970 --> 01:54:08,360
that's not what the agreement was.
The agreement wasn't that you tell

2584
01:54:08,361 --> 01:54:11,030
people that I'm watching the agreement
was I buy a tv from you.

2585
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:13,580
That was the agreement.
Like when You say,

2586
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:15,980
oh,
we're going to sell the data from the

2587
01:54:15,981 --> 01:54:17,840
people that are watching your tv,
you're like,

2588
01:54:17,841 --> 01:54:19,310
okay,
well yeah,

2589
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:23,180
but the cables that guarantee it's
buried in your cable deal.

2590
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:23,750
Yeah,
the south.

2591
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:26,180
We get to keep it prop south park.
Have a bid oN that,

2592
01:54:26,181 --> 01:54:27,830
that whole human setup pad,
they once you,

2593
01:54:27,890 --> 01:54:29,810
the terms of service,
like no one's reading it,

2594
01:54:29,811 --> 01:54:32,910
but you're agreeing to becoming seen
that episode because could becoming a

2595
01:54:32,930 --> 01:54:34,280
fucking thing.
So what,

2596
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:35,030
how's it going?
I'm sorry.

2597
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:36,890
Like just just agreeing to the terms of
service,

2598
01:54:36,891 --> 01:54:39,440
like you don't know what you're doing.
And like the joke on that was that your

2599
01:54:39,441 --> 01:54:41,480
agreement to become a human centipede.

2600
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:48,570
I never saw a human centipede either
to a couple bars I've seen.

2601
01:54:52,410 --> 01:54:53,720
Yeah.
Um,

2602
01:54:53,890 --> 01:54:57,470
they're going to get us in weird ways,
but they're just trying to find out

2603
01:54:57,471 --> 01:54:58,820
who's watching what.
The thing is like,

2604
01:54:58,821 --> 01:55:03,140
should your tv be able to just watch.
You should be able To have a line on

2605
01:55:03,141 --> 01:55:06,170
what you're watching.
Because I know people now that just use

2606
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:09,420
netflix and they don't have anything.
They didn't have an internet connection

2607
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:12,410
is hooked up to their television.
Television connects to netflix

2608
01:55:12,411 --> 01:55:14,330
automatically.
It's like one of the native apps.

2609
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:16,430
Yeah.
But if you're connected to the internet,

2610
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:17,930
you're getting watched.
You know,

2611
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:19,460
is what most people would say.
I,

2612
01:55:19,530 --> 01:55:22,460
I'm so paranoid about it.
I have a little piece of duct tape over

2613
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:24,320
my camera on my ipad.
Good move.

2614
01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:25,610
Yeah,
good move.

2615
01:55:25,611 --> 01:55:28,250
I don't need that on there,
but the thing is it's like.

2616
01:55:29,150 --> 01:55:32,750
Yeah,
but why are you selling data?

2617
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:35,840
Wants to buy it.
Yeah,

2618
01:55:35,841 --> 01:55:38,450
but why are you allowed to just collect
data from people?

2619
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:40,840
It's pretty much in the contract you
sign.

2620
01:55:40,841 --> 01:55:43,470
I get shit.
Literally there should be two prices.

2621
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:47,190
This should be one where you're allowed
to collect data.

2622
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:52,250
You can collect data for me,
but it costs like 50 bucks more a year.

2623
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:56,520
And the other one where you know,
I,

2624
01:55:56,521 --> 01:55:59,170
you can't collect my data,
I have to pay a little bit more money.

2625
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,140
That's,
that's kind of happening.

2626
01:56:01,141 --> 01:56:03,480
There are apps you can use that'll track
how many,

2627
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:06,540
how much are walking in exchange for
letting them,

2628
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:09,930
letting you turn on that.
They'll give you stuff out,

2629
01:56:09,980 --> 01:56:11,640
like whatever.
If it's useful to you.

2630
01:56:11,641 --> 01:56:11,900
I don't.

2631
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:14,200
What are you talking about?
Like if you walked by mcdonald's,

2632
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:15,920
they can serve you,
but mcdonald's ad

2633
01:56:16,010 --> 01:56:17,400
for sure for sure.
Yeah.

2634
01:56:17,890 --> 01:56:20,000
Yeah.
Well that's the ultimate goal,

2635
01:56:20,001 --> 01:56:21,740
right?
Is to figure out where you are and

2636
01:56:21,741 --> 01:56:23,600
target you with something.
Yeah.

2637
01:56:24,350 --> 01:56:26,510
Yeah.
So my friend animal green tree was on

2638
01:56:26,511 --> 01:56:29,660
here and we were talking about he lives
in Australia and he lives.

2639
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,880
He goes,
he travels like deep into the outback

2640
01:56:31,881 --> 01:56:34,550
where it takes us three days to drive in
and I said,

2641
01:56:34,551 --> 01:56:37,340
everybody has toyota trucks because
those fucking things never break.

2642
01:56:37,341 --> 01:56:38,330
They don't.
They don't.

2643
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:41,900
And so he gets ads all of a sudden out
of nowhere on his phone.

2644
01:56:41,901 --> 01:56:44,810
Every time he goes to a website that
says toyota trucks,

2645
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:45,920
he's like,
what the fuck?

2646
01:56:45,921 --> 01:56:47,000
He goes,
I didn't google it.

2647
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:48,650
It was a cook cookies.
Well,

2648
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:51,860
it's kinda called cookies,
but it's not something that came from a

2649
01:56:51,861 --> 01:56:55,190
search.
It's something that came from something

2650
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:59,600
in his phone is listening.
We said the word toyota trucks it,

2651
01:56:59,601 --> 01:57:03,710
registered it and added it to his queue
of is google.

2652
01:57:03,711 --> 01:57:06,640
So many messages.
Were they listening?

2653
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:08,860
So many messages from people that
brought.

2654
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:11,470
We brought this up the other day.
I go to these signs and messages like

2655
01:57:11,471 --> 01:57:14,180
you guys mentioned,
do they think it's real estate x?

2656
01:57:14,181 --> 01:57:16,100
And they started getting served ads for
that.

2657
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:18,480
Like I said,
I Just said columbia,

2658
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:21,820
I don't know,
penicillin.

2659
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:25,250
he tried to buy stock.

2660
01:57:26,290 --> 01:57:29,620
It's like he's got so much chlamydia,
we're going to sell him all the benefits

2661
01:57:29,710 --> 01:57:34,380
that it would be smart to.
My assistant just said,

2662
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:37,050
just bought a stock

2663
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:42,580
screener.com.
We actuallY own gas actually

2664
01:57:43,310 --> 01:57:44,390
screener.com.
Now

2665
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:50,450
we'll get.
That's a border.

2666
01:57:50,451 --> 01:57:53,510
The border wall is a fucking tough
question because it is a certain amount

2667
01:57:53,511 --> 01:57:56,540
of people just going to be mad at you.
You fucking cooks which go over there

2668
01:57:56,541 --> 01:57:59,170
and soak all those marks can dirks aBout
that.

2669
01:57:59,210 --> 01:58:01,190
Some people are going to get,
they're going to get there,

2670
01:58:01,490 --> 01:58:02,410
they're going to get angry.
I

2671
01:58:02,410 --> 01:58:05,320
might go down and chasing a latina
ladies for sure.

2672
01:58:06,010 --> 01:58:07,190
It's a,
you know,

2673
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:09,400
such a hot,
hot topic.

2674
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:11,440
But that's also,
you know,

2675
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:14,500
few open yourself up to comments.
Well somebody brought one up the other

2676
01:58:14,501 --> 01:58:17,560
day that was a general discussion
question and it said,

2677
01:58:17,950 --> 01:58:19,870
you know,
why don't we just do dna?

2678
01:58:19,990 --> 01:58:21,730
Let's say your board,
we take your fingerprints,

2679
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:23,920
we take everything else,
we check you all out.

2680
01:58:24,010 --> 01:58:28,420
Why don't we just do the dna and I get
the privacy part of it for later on,

2681
01:58:28,870 --> 01:58:32,590
but at the same time you're solving a
lot of problems with the very beginning.

2682
01:58:32,591 --> 01:58:35,590
Okay,
this person just came out of here and

2683
01:58:35,591 --> 01:58:36,990
they've done nothing.
Right?

2684
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:40,900
So now if they ever do anything we know
to go shoot him in the back of the,

2685
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,340
well,
we certainly

2686
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:46,240
could do that,
but we would have to place a gigantic

2687
01:58:46,241 --> 01:58:51,190
priority on getting the very best people
in law enforcement.

2688
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:54,340
You would have to eliminate all
shitheads.

2689
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:58,630
You'd have to pay those cops way more
and treat them with the respect that

2690
01:58:58,631 --> 01:59:02,920
they deserve as people that literally
are protecting you from violent

2691
01:59:02,921 --> 01:59:05,680
criminals.
I was what I know mean I'm a huge

2692
01:59:05,681 --> 01:59:06,890
supporter of cops.
I've.

2693
01:59:06,950 --> 01:59:10,420
I've been around cops most of my life
because of martial arts.

2694
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:14,410
I know a lot of cops,
and this is a weird issue with people

2695
01:59:14,411 --> 01:59:18,940
where they fuck the police.
Know if you're saying fuck the police,

2696
01:59:18,941 --> 01:59:20,590
you might as well say,
fuck the humans.

2697
01:59:20,650 --> 01:59:23,770
If someone does something bad,
if someone does something bad to

2698
01:59:23,771 --> 01:59:24,970
someone,
we don't say,

2699
01:59:24,971 --> 01:59:27,690
fuck all humans.
If someone murdered someone,

2700
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:29,290
we say,
fuck that guy,

2701
01:59:29,530 --> 01:59:32,890
and then you start breaking it down to
whatever group you're not a part of,

2702
01:59:32,891 --> 01:59:37,891
so it's fuck that x generation guy,
fuck that lebanese guy or whatever

2703
01:59:38,411 --> 01:59:41,500
nationality he is,
fuck that straight guy.

2704
01:59:41,710 --> 01:59:42,370
Or if,
uh,

2705
01:59:42,370 --> 01:59:44,920
if he's gay and he killed somebody,
fuck that gay guy.

2706
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:49,720
But it's just humans.
we're all individuals no matter what it

2707
01:59:49,721 --> 01:59:51,940
is,
no matter what we're talking about.

2708
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:55,120
And as soon as you start breaking down
into groups like,

2709
01:59:55,150 --> 01:59:56,980
oh,
fuck these people,

2710
01:59:57,910 --> 02:00:01,600
you can't do that with everybody.
Then just because what's that?

2711
02:00:01,630 --> 02:00:03,490
Then it just becomes a fight.
Everybody's touching.

2712
02:00:03,610 --> 02:00:05,110
It's,
you can't do that.

2713
02:00:05,230 --> 02:00:08,950
You can't do that.
We're all fucking in this thing

2714
02:00:08,951 --> 02:00:10,120
together.
Correct.

2715
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,320
God damn,
we're drunk,

2716
02:00:13,321 --> 02:00:16,210
right?
Probably too drunk or not drunk yet.

2717
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,150
You'll have one here that we had all I
needed,

2718
02:00:21,170 --> 02:00:22,710
so I'm probably going to be in trouble
for that.

2719
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,780
Did they give you a hard time about
that?

2720
02:00:24,810 --> 02:00:29,810
Who knows if it's legal in California
where I'm at.

2721
02:00:30,570 --> 02:00:32,340
So it's legal.
Exactly.

2722
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:36,630
You know how many people used to go down
to Mexico to watch or whatever or do

2723
02:00:36,631 --> 02:00:39,720
whatever.
I'm amazed that people are still

2724
02:00:39,721 --> 02:00:43,320
bringing in weed from Mexico.
That shows me have a real lack of

2725
02:00:43,321 --> 02:00:45,330
american engine nudity.
That's outrageous.

2726
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,940
Well,
the canadians are the ones that are

2727
02:00:48,550 --> 02:00:53,080
now [inaudible] dot com currently or
where you redirect you to this spot.

2728
02:00:53,110 --> 02:00:53,943
Okay.

2729
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:01,840
Oh,
that is so stupid.

2730
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:06,530
The internet is undefeated.
I gotta give a shout out to my people.

2731
02:01:06,531 --> 02:01:08,990
They said that.
That's amazing.

2732
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:13,640
If people did that that quickly.
You got some rocks off automatically

2733
02:01:13,641 --> 02:01:18,641
directed to cut screener.
I hope discovery channel doesn't get hit

2734
02:01:18,651 --> 02:01:22,930
with a wave of protests.
Which mou on discovery?

2735
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,590
Yeah.
It just discovered they have a giant

2736
02:01:24,591 --> 02:01:25,400
network though,
right?

2737
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:28,420
Like they have like how many different
channels or on the discovery network

2738
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:31,500
channels I think is like 80 or 90 years.
That's crazy.

2739
02:01:31,610 --> 02:01:34,190
It might be more than that.
That's crazy.

2740
02:01:34,250 --> 02:01:37,160
I mean they have some channels that I've
never even heard of like you know the

2741
02:01:37,161 --> 02:01:41,450
brick wall channel or I have idea.
It's just insane stuff.

2742
02:01:41,570 --> 02:01:43,490
They divided all down.
I think there needs to be a little

2743
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:46,250
consolidation in the market.
Yeah.

2744
02:01:46,251 --> 02:01:47,090
Well,
you know,

2745
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:50,090
it's everybody loved top gear,
right?

2746
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:53,780
Like top gear is probably like one of
the greatest car shows of all time.

2747
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:56,780
I never really watched it.
How dare you.

2748
02:01:56,850 --> 02:01:58,790
I'm telling you,
how dare you.

2749
02:01:58,791 --> 02:02:01,060
Richard rawlings,
but it's a.

2750
02:02:01,130 --> 02:02:03,870
Is it dead now or is it still there?
The grant.

2751
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:06,080
What is the grand tour or something like
that.

2752
02:02:06,110 --> 02:02:08,930
Something like on amazon.
Amazon picked it up.

2753
02:02:08,931 --> 02:02:10,700
I haven't watched a single episode of
the new one,

2754
02:02:10,730 --> 02:02:14,180
but the old one was shit and part of it
that was fun was that,

2755
02:02:14,690 --> 02:02:17,870
you know,
those guys were kind of nuts.

2756
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:18,890
Yeah,
exactly.

2757
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:20,480
Yeah.
That's what we do.

2758
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:21,351
You know,
gas monkey.

2759
02:02:21,351 --> 02:02:22,580
We cut them loose.
We'd have fun.

2760
02:02:22,581 --> 02:02:24,710
We'd light stuff on fire,
break it,

2761
02:02:24,711 --> 02:02:25,670
whatever.
yeah.

2762
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:29,200
And there was some violence.
What's the uh,

2763
02:02:29,210 --> 02:02:30,800
what's his name?
The head guy?

2764
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:32,240
Uh,
clarkson.

2765
02:02:32,241 --> 02:02:35,330
Was it jeremy clarkson got into some
producer,

2766
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:36,081
right?
Oh,

2767
02:02:36,081 --> 02:02:36,914
trust me.

2768
02:02:37,710 --> 02:02:39,680
Yeah.
I don't know if that producer deserved

2769
02:02:39,681 --> 02:02:43,070
it or not.
Had to reserve myself quite a few times.

2770
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:45,530
People get crazy.
You know,

2771
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:47,360
you're putting a show together.
It's

2772
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:50,020
especially,
you know,

2773
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:51,320
those guys,
the producers,

2774
02:02:51,321 --> 02:02:52,670
the camera guys,
the sound guys,

2775
02:02:52,671 --> 02:02:56,210
the people that are sitting in the
discovery offices and they have jobs.

2776
02:02:56,690 --> 02:02:59,180
This is my life I'm putting on every
single day,

2777
02:02:59,390 --> 02:03:02,000
you know,
and so not only do I have my whole life

2778
02:03:02,001 --> 02:03:05,600
on it and in it,
but then I had to deal with filming it

2779
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:09,260
and I've tried to explain it to them
because they don't care to a point if

2780
02:03:09,261 --> 02:03:12,380
the show does well or bad because
there'll be another richard on the road.

2781
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:16,010
But yeah,
there's a lot of high volume approach

2782
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:19,280
when it comes to those kind of like a
cable shows,

2783
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:22,580
you know,
they just try to bang out as many as

2784
02:03:22,580 --> 02:03:23,870
they can.
High voLume,

2785
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:26,450
you know,
and they have a formula that they try to

2786
02:03:26,451 --> 02:03:31,400
file when they have a lot of like set up
scenarios where people get in trouble

2787
02:03:31,401 --> 02:03:33,050
for things where they're not really
getting in trouble.

2788
02:03:33,050 --> 02:03:35,290
So it's all set up in advance,
you know,

2789
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:37,190
it's almost scripted,
right?

2790
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:39,290
A lot of reality shows.
Some of them can be.

2791
02:03:39,850 --> 02:03:41,780
You just know that just poured the fifth
shot.

2792
02:03:41,781 --> 02:03:44,510
How dare you,
or is it fit?

2793
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:48,590
I think it was the fifth,
but um,

2794
02:03:48,950 --> 02:03:50,220
I think it's that they,
um,

2795
02:03:51,190 --> 02:03:54,140
I was telling myself this morning I
should cut back on drinking.

2796
02:03:55,260 --> 02:04:00,260
I tell myself that every morning,
but it's so wild because I've known as

2797
02:04:02,001 --> 02:04:04,670
the guy that likes to drink some cold
miller lites and hang out in the garage.

2798
02:04:05,030 --> 02:04:06,960
So even,
you know,

2799
02:04:07,110 --> 02:04:08,750
my own bars and restaurants and stuff
and they'll come in,

2800
02:04:08,751 --> 02:04:09,770
they're like,
I'm buying you a beer.

2801
02:04:09,771 --> 02:04:10,281
And I'm like,
sir,

2802
02:04:10,281 --> 02:04:11,840
you really don't have to.
I own the place.

2803
02:04:12,130 --> 02:04:13,100
Oh,
I'm buying it.

2804
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:14,630
I'm like,
you really don't have to.

2805
02:04:14,750 --> 02:04:15,270
They're like,
nope.

2806
02:04:15,270 --> 02:04:17,280
Buying it.
Like ringing up sally.

2807
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:19,400
Well,
it makes people feel good.

2808
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:21,320
People like buying people's shit like
that.

2809
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:25,460
That's a beautiful thing about booze.
People like buying people that drink.

2810
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:27,250
Let me buy you a drink.
All right.

2811
02:04:27,590 --> 02:04:30,120
It's like a niCe gesture.
ExactlY.

2812
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:32,060
Don't bite people's sandwiches,
right?

2813
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:33,220
They buy people drinks.
Oh,

2814
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:34,940
I'm down for pizza sandwich.
Anything.

2815
02:04:34,941 --> 02:04:37,680
Anytime I'm going to buy you an herbal
tea.

2816
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:38,100
No one's

2817
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:39,220
ever said that.
Yeah,

2818
02:04:39,230 --> 02:04:40,063
no.
Well,

2819
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:42,210
we're in California,
I'm sure they're saying it right now.

2820
02:04:42,230 --> 02:04:44,310
You'd probably say,
would you like macho or just the regular

2821
02:04:44,311 --> 02:04:48,240
herbs or like people probably said that
just try to appear spiritual.

2822
02:04:48,270 --> 02:04:53,270
I'd like to buy you an herbal tea
juice you with bitcoin and herbal tea.

2823
02:04:57,660 --> 02:04:59,670
I had a girl asked me the other day.
She goes,

2824
02:04:59,790 --> 02:05:03,090
you're laura seems different.
Interesting,

2825
02:05:03,380 --> 02:05:04,780
interesting.
Uh,

2826
02:05:04,970 --> 02:05:07,440
I'm like,
I don't get that lady that all.

2827
02:05:07,470 --> 02:05:07,860
She goes,
well,

2828
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:08,910
I see you every year here.
Barrett,

2829
02:05:08,930 --> 02:05:10,080
jackson,
and you just,

2830
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:10,820
your,
your,

2831
02:05:10,820 --> 02:05:13,270
your glow is different clothes
different.

2832
02:05:13,660 --> 02:05:14,640
I'm like,
well,

2833
02:05:14,641 --> 02:05:17,970
I'm still using the same tom ford axe
body spray thing.

2834
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:21,390
People have weird things.
They say to people to fuck with them.

2835
02:05:22,410 --> 02:05:24,870
Or you gaining weight?
Gaining weight.

2836
02:05:24,871 --> 02:05:26,760
Richard,
your rs.

2837
02:05:26,850 --> 02:05:27,391
Different.
Yeah.

2838
02:05:27,391 --> 02:05:28,920
You look so thin.
Are you?

2839
02:05:28,921 --> 02:05:30,210
Is your diet okay?

2840
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:31,530
How's your diet?
Okay,

2841
02:05:31,890 --> 02:05:36,600
my diet's great.
What's your or has different trying to

2842
02:05:36,601 --> 02:05:38,460
figure out what's wrong.
He not happy.

2843
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:40,130
Are you not happy?
Oh,

2844
02:05:40,131 --> 02:05:42,120
I'm perfectly abby.
What's wrong?

2845
02:05:42,150 --> 02:05:43,620
What's wrong?
What's wrong with you?

2846
02:05:44,270 --> 02:05:45,900
Fuck it up.
They're hoping.

2847
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:51,950
They're hoping you're ready to crack.
Fucking just juking you.

2848
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:56,310
Come on.
I know you're scared exactly the trick

2849
02:05:56,350 --> 02:05:58,800
and you tricky and revealing some shit
here.

2850
02:05:58,830 --> 02:06:00,390
Aras off,
richard.

2851
02:06:00,570 --> 02:06:03,720
Something's wrong with your aura.
You should probably be able to punch

2852
02:06:03,721 --> 02:06:06,090
people that say that we should
definitely go,

2853
02:06:06,091 --> 02:06:08,550
hey,
fuck off or as aren't real bitch.

2854
02:06:08,551 --> 02:06:10,740
You need to draw the aura.
Show me what to watch.

2855
02:06:10,930 --> 02:06:12,450
You get.
You've got to have some science behind

2856
02:06:12,451 --> 02:06:14,820
this.
The whole ideology of fuck off is my

2857
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:17,790
thing.
So the gas mcgee ring underneath says,

2858
02:06:17,791 --> 02:06:20,970
fuck off.
I'm shaking your hand and

2859
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:28,860
you should always be able to say fuck
off if you can't say fuck off,

2860
02:06:28,890 --> 02:06:30,780
but you have to be judicious,
right?

2861
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:33,870
You have to say fuck off when fuck off
is appropriate,

2862
02:06:33,871 --> 02:06:37,470
but you have to also salute people when
they're not full of shit.

2863
02:06:37,530 --> 02:06:38,520
Yeah,
yeah.

2864
02:06:38,700 --> 02:06:40,770
You say you're definitely not the person
I'm telling to fuck off.

2865
02:06:40,771 --> 02:06:42,000
You're a.
You're a good dude.

2866
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:43,590
You're all right,
man.

2867
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:46,380
You got to have positive and negative.
Like someone is telling you they're

2868
02:06:46,381 --> 02:06:47,770
reading.
They're all your auras.

2869
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:50,820
Okay.
You might be able to.

2870
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:52,350
I mean,
I don't know what the fuck you're

2871
02:06:52,351 --> 02:06:53,940
seeing.
I barely know what I'm saying.

2872
02:06:53,970 --> 02:06:57,360
I have no idea of what I'm seeing is
really even remotely similar to what

2873
02:06:57,361 --> 02:06:59,130
you're seeing.
I'm just assuming.

2874
02:06:59,730 --> 02:07:01,400
There you go.
It's just a guess like,

2875
02:07:01,430 --> 02:07:03,900
like some people like weird fucking
cars,

2876
02:07:03,901 --> 02:07:07,380
right?
Like some people are really into certain

2877
02:07:07,381 --> 02:07:08,071
cars.
You go,

2878
02:07:08,071 --> 02:07:09,240
I don't get it.
Yeah.

2879
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:12,090
Like a pinto hatchback or something.
Some people are really into.

2880
02:07:12,090 --> 02:07:16,230
Those are popular with some groups.
Some people are really into like gross

2881
02:07:16,231 --> 02:07:18,050
look and shit.
Yeah.

2882
02:07:18,070 --> 02:07:20,520
I don't know what they're seeing.
Maybe they're seeing something different

2883
02:07:20,521 --> 02:07:21,400
than me.
Well,

2884
02:07:21,420 --> 02:07:23,740
it's probably a combination of their
childhood,

2885
02:07:23,741 --> 02:07:25,020
their upbringing,
what have you,

2886
02:07:25,710 --> 02:07:30,180
but isn't like.
Is it possible that like personal taste

2887
02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:35,210
is a lot like sprinting speed.
Like not everybody is going to be Carl

2888
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:37,150
Lewis,
right?

2889
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:42,180
Not everybody is going to be some who's
another fast guy who's st bull.

2890
02:07:42,850 --> 02:07:45,430
Hussein bolt is the fastest ever
supposed to be.

2891
02:07:45,431 --> 02:07:46,570
Yeah,
he's the fastest.

2892
02:07:46,571 --> 02:07:48,280
However,
not everybody could do that.

2893
02:07:48,580 --> 02:07:52,600
So isn't it possible that that would
also apply to taste?

2894
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:56,110
That there's,
there's people out there that really get

2895
02:07:56,111 --> 02:08:00,430
what's wrong with your fucking shitty
taste and there's other people out there

2896
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:02,410
that likes fox body.
Mustang.

2897
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:07,540
Fox body I think is the best looking
carval's it's the best ever.

2898
02:08:07,541 --> 02:08:10,480
I just left barrett jackson and when you
see something real across the stage and

2899
02:08:10,481 --> 02:08:14,500
you're just like,
why in the hell is somebody that I don't

2900
02:08:14,501 --> 02:08:16,960
get it and they're over.
They're clapping and they're all happy

2901
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:18,850
ordering drinks for their friends.
Look,

2902
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:23,710
I just bought an 81,
a thunderbird turbo mustang.

2903
02:08:23,711 --> 02:08:24,640
Five point.
Oh,

2904
02:08:24,641 --> 02:08:26,740
like vanilla ice had in this video.

2905
02:08:29,330 --> 02:08:33,130
We're going into dangerous waters there.
Mad my buddy sold when it barrett last

2906
02:08:33,130 --> 02:08:35,540
year.
High scar.

2907
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:39,400
It's not the worst car in the world,
but if you had to compare,

2908
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:42,850
what is that like 87,
88.

2909
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:44,750
Like what was that car?
What year was that?

2910
02:08:45,610 --> 02:08:47,630
[inaudible] 89.
80 nine

2911
02:08:49,720 --> 02:08:52,120
mustang.
Five point maybe it was 87.

2912
02:08:52,180 --> 02:08:54,430
He's.
He had to drop top down so his locks can

2913
02:08:54,431 --> 02:08:55,264
flow.
Didn't he?

2914
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:57,940
Something like that.
You know,

2915
02:08:57,941 --> 02:09:00,700
he grew up just up the street from where
I grew up.

2916
02:09:00,790 --> 02:09:03,070
I met him at a ufc,
I believe.

2917
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:05,710
I believe he was very nice.
There it is.

2918
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:07,360
Bam.
My uh,

2919
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:09,520
my friend kevin,
jason had one of those but he didn't

2920
02:09:09,521 --> 02:09:14,170
have a convertible rolling in dough.
We were like fucking 20 years old.

2921
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:19,750
That car back in the day was the shit.
If you had one of those cars,

2922
02:09:19,751 --> 02:09:21,130
you are a fucking hero.

2923
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:22,190
It was fast.
It was,

2924
02:09:22,510 --> 02:09:26,830
it was also like it was a,
the car to have 230 horsepower and it

2925
02:09:26,831 --> 02:09:28,090
really,
I know,

2926
02:09:28,650 --> 02:09:30,400
I wonder,
it might not have had any more,

2927
02:09:30,430 --> 02:09:33,070
but it was good because we were all
stupid and we didn't know how to drive

2928
02:09:33,071 --> 02:09:36,460
anyway.
But those cars were that at that time

2929
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:38,970
for whatever reason,
like what,

2930
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:42,370
whatever was wrong with people.
That was a good looking car.

2931
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:46,090
But if you look at that car could pick
like a 69 mach one,

2932
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:49,780
like get the fuck outta here.
How did you do this?

2933
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:54,820
Go to a 69.
Mach one black 1969.

2934
02:09:54,821 --> 02:09:56,560
Mach one.
Absolutely best car ever.

2935
02:09:56,770 --> 02:09:59,290
It's one of them.
I mean,

2936
02:09:59,291 --> 02:10:01,150
there's some arguments out there of one
of the,

2937
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:06,180
but it's in fucking race for sure.
It's in the top three to five black,

2938
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:10,720
69.
Mach one mach piece of shit.

2939
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:12,760
I had a real and it's true.
It's true.

2940
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:15,400
That is rest of my.
But this shape is an order.

2941
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:16,333
That's good.
That's

2942
02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:20,740
good.
That is the one down there at the big

2943
02:10:20,741 --> 02:10:21,750
picture.
Oh,

2944
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:24,440
is it a 78 year old.
Got to have your headlights on the 16th.

2945
02:10:24,710 --> 02:10:26,740
That's right.
This is the missing sidelights.

2946
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:30,400
Seventy one.
Mach one was what?

2947
02:10:31,030 --> 02:10:35,030
Keanu reeves had he wished he had a
chevelle.

2948
02:10:35,031 --> 02:10:38,720
Didn't he know he had a chevelle after
they stole his fucking mustang?

2949
02:10:40,690 --> 02:10:42,890
Dude,
they did the ultimatum.

2950
02:10:42,950 --> 02:10:45,470
Okay.
They killed his dog and they stole his

2951
02:10:45,471 --> 02:10:46,580
mustang.
Very.

2952
02:10:46,581 --> 02:10:47,630
You go,
you got to go kill.

2953
02:10:47,631 --> 02:10:49,120
This.
Began to kill some russians.

2954
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:52,310
I actually did some promo for that show
was pretty good.

2955
02:10:52,430 --> 02:10:55,490
That fucking movie.
Here's what's there it is.

2956
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:57,370
There's the john wick mustang.
There it is.

2957
02:10:57,410 --> 02:11:00,930
The guy was talking to him and rust in
russian about as much.

2958
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:02,600
Fuck,
that's a good car.

2959
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:06,070
This show is great because the kid was
just a total fuck up.

2960
02:11:07,250 --> 02:11:08,660
What do I do with this?
Yeah.

2961
02:11:08,690 --> 02:11:13,310
Do I kill my kid or kill this dude?
And then he came with what I said we

2962
02:11:13,311 --> 02:11:15,380
were talking about your shovel.
You're 68 chevelle.

2963
02:11:15,710 --> 02:11:18,500
I go between 68,
69 and those 1970.

2964
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:21,230
Sometimes I look at those 70 zero.
God damn,

2965
02:11:21,231 --> 02:11:23,300
that's the perfect car.
They look a little tougher.

2966
02:11:23,810 --> 02:11:26,060
IT's a mad man's car.
Look at that one.

2967
02:11:26,090 --> 02:11:27,560
Woo.
I need one.

2968
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:29,630
Look at that god damn thing that mock
one.

2969
02:11:29,631 --> 02:11:31,670
60 nine.
We're going to build one on the show.

2970
02:11:32,750 --> 02:11:35,570
Hopefully this year.
That's a fuck a beautiful car.

2971
02:11:36,980 --> 02:11:37,940
Yeah.
Sixty nine.

2972
02:11:37,941 --> 02:11:41,070
Mach one.
And the boss for 29 to get Into

2973
02:11:41,090 --> 02:11:44,840
buildings over these movie cars because
I've seen some of them up close and

2974
02:11:44,841 --> 02:11:49,670
they're their shit.
Go to classic recreation's boss for 29.

2975
02:11:49,700 --> 02:11:51,440
Go to this.
You need to see this.

2976
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:52,310
Uh,
he,

2977
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:57,310
he made this murdered out 1969 boss.
And it's.

2978
02:11:57,950 --> 02:12:00,500
Look at that day.
How dare you.

2979
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:01,460
Now.
That's perfect.

2980
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:04,730
That's perfect.
Christ.

2981
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:08,270
And get that goddamn car ever ruins that
right now.

2982
02:12:08,271 --> 02:12:09,104
Give me a call.
I'm like,

2983
02:12:09,410 --> 02:12:11,960
holy shit.
That's pretty awesome.

2984
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:17,150
That's about as ameriCa as an eagle
killing a terrorist.

2985
02:12:17,270 --> 02:12:18,500
Exactly right.

2986
02:12:22,790 --> 02:12:24,590
Look at that fucking car,
man.

2987
02:12:24,591 --> 02:12:26,240
Don't go away from that picture.
Jamie.

2988
02:12:26,241 --> 02:12:29,210
Go back to that picture.
Good lord.

2989
02:12:29,890 --> 02:12:33,170
Might be pretty good.
There's not a better looking car.

2990
02:12:33,410 --> 02:12:37,310
There's just different.
Nothing's better looking than that

2991
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:41,300
doesn't exist.
I don't give a fuck what anYbody says.

2992
02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:43,970
There's nothing better looking than that
car.

2993
02:12:44,490 --> 02:12:46,070
There's just different.
I agree.

2994
02:12:46,610 --> 02:12:48,830
We've had a few balls for $29 through
the shot,

2995
02:12:48,831 --> 02:12:53,090
but that was not a modern one like that.
There's a rat gang of evil cars from

2996
02:12:53,091 --> 02:12:55,530
that day,
but there's not a better looking one.

2997
02:12:56,150 --> 02:12:56,960
I mean the,
the,

2998
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:59,360
the manufacturers,
we're just trying to one up each other.

2999
02:12:59,361 --> 02:13:03,200
I mean just kind of just the wild west
of automobile and like I'm going to

3000
02:13:03,201 --> 02:13:04,550
reach out to you now.
I'll tell you,

3001
02:13:04,551 --> 02:13:07,580
and I wish you know,
we're sort of in that again right now.

3002
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:10,610
Yeah.
Right now dodge chevy and a ford are

3003
02:13:10,750 --> 02:13:12,290
kind of doing the same thing right now.

3004
02:13:12,350 --> 02:13:14,480
They are,
and it's also elevated everybody's

3005
02:13:14,481 --> 02:13:17,000
interior game,
which keep that up there.

3006
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:19,640
Don't you take that down.
That's like shutting down porn.

3007
02:13:19,650 --> 02:13:23,750
What's wrong with everybody's interior
game stepped up to because it used to be

3008
02:13:23,751 --> 02:13:27,170
like the germans.
The japanese had much higher build

3009
02:13:27,171 --> 02:13:30,890
quality with the interiors,
but corvette has had to step up.

3010
02:13:30,891 --> 02:13:33,960
Its considerably.
The new corvettes are very nice

3011
02:13:33,961 --> 02:13:36,780
interior.
Tony hinchcliffe has one standup

3012
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:38,400
comedian,
extraordinary tony hinchcliffe.

3013
02:13:38,820 --> 02:13:42,240
He's got a grand sport,
whiCh a lot of people think is the best

3014
02:13:42,241 --> 02:13:46,170
of the because it's not too overpowered.
Still got the wide body,

3015
02:13:46,470 --> 02:13:49,470
but I look at the interior go.
This is a nice interior men.

3016
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:52,530
It's not like it used to be.
It used to be the car as fast as fuck.

3017
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:54,690
It's put the seat and there's nothing in
it.

3018
02:13:55,650 --> 02:13:59,580
You have a two spoke steering wheel that
when you can actually bend it,

3019
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:00,630
you know,
those,

3020
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:02,910
those cars were terrible.
I just noticed her,

3021
02:14:02,911 --> 02:14:04,690
these fake clouds in the air.
Yeah.

3022
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:09,030
What they are is these lights that used
to have clear covers.

3023
02:14:09,450 --> 02:14:12,780
Instead,
we got this thing from octo lights and

3024
02:14:12,781 --> 02:14:14,130
they're a company that makes,
uh,

3025
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:18,480
it's,
it's like a photograph of clouds that

3026
02:14:18,481 --> 02:14:23,460
you could see through.
So we put it over the top of the light

3027
02:14:23,461 --> 02:14:26,150
itself.
Did octo mom start that until lights?

3028
02:14:26,350 --> 02:14:27,183
No.
Gotcha.

3029
02:14:30,570 --> 02:14:34,870
Because there's only six lights in here.
Not a well in the old place we had them.

3030
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:36,940
They were stars,
but the news place,

3031
02:14:36,941 --> 02:14:39,480
the lights,
these led lights are just not as bright

3032
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:43,200
so we had to change it to clouds,
but it looks at the new roles with the

3033
02:14:43,201 --> 02:14:46,120
star.
I've got A wraith,

3034
02:14:46,210 --> 02:14:48,630
um,
and it's got the shooting star every

3035
02:14:48,631 --> 02:14:49,890
once in awhile.
And really?

3036
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:52,020
Yeah.
So a lot of people don't know that the

3037
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:56,520
star pattern that they put in the
headliner in the car is the exact star

3038
02:14:56,521 --> 02:15:00,510
pattern from,
I guess the original factory or

3039
02:15:00,511 --> 02:15:01,710
whatever.
Oh wow.

3040
02:15:01,740 --> 02:15:02,970
And uh,
it,

3041
02:15:02,971 --> 02:15:03,661
uh,
what have you,

3042
02:15:03,661 --> 02:15:06,490
but a unbelievable.
You're riding along.

3043
02:15:06,491 --> 02:15:09,150
You got stars above you.
It's freaking rad.

3044
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:10,650
Yeah.
My neighbor has one of those.

3045
02:15:10,730 --> 02:15:14,130
That car is epic.
It's a two door,

3046
02:15:14,490 --> 02:15:17,370
four door knock at the door and get in
it.

3047
02:15:17,370 --> 02:15:19,110
And you go with this car is
preposterous.

3048
02:15:19,450 --> 02:15:22,830
It's so quiet.
It's like you're barely connected to the

3049
02:15:22,831 --> 02:15:24,410
outside world.
There you go.

3050
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:29,640
Those suicide doors.
Look at the fucking ceiling.

3051
02:15:29,641 --> 02:15:32,880
Men.
You're barely connected to the world.

3052
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:34,470
Barely.
YOu barely paid attention.

3053
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:35,340
No,
I jump in there.

3054
02:15:35,341 --> 02:15:37,320
And uh,
my uh,

3055
02:15:37,380 --> 02:15:40,440
poodle fifi jumps in and I got a
standard Black poodle.

3056
02:15:40,441 --> 02:15:42,030
This big,
big girl,

3057
02:15:42,430 --> 02:15:45,270
if she jumps in there and just like rods
around looking at people.

3058
02:15:45,450 --> 02:15:49,170
Did theY develop poodles for some
specific hunting reason?

3059
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:50,940
So they were hunters.
Yeah,

3060
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:54,000
like people think of poodles.
They think of poodles is like a,

3061
02:15:54,270 --> 02:15:56,760
like a rich person's to beverly hills
dog.

3062
02:15:57,150 --> 02:15:58,260
The ballet.
I poodles

3063
02:15:59,870 --> 02:16:01,400
brand as hunters.
And what happened?

3064
02:16:01,450 --> 02:16:02,350
A matter of fact,
mine,

3065
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:03,120
uh,
uh,

3066
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:07,080
I called her fifi as her name and she
brought a rabbit in.

3067
02:16:07,170 --> 02:16:10,200
One nighT she comes to bed,
I'm laying there and I'm like,

3068
02:16:10,230 --> 02:16:13,410
what is she messing with?
So I reached down in the dark and pull

3069
02:16:13,411 --> 02:16:15,410
up this rabbit.
I'm like,

3070
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:19,200
what the frick and a.
But they soft mouth,

3071
02:16:19,201 --> 02:16:20,034
don't they?
They,

3072
02:16:20,100 --> 02:16:22,050
they're,
it's in their genes.

3073
02:16:22,051 --> 02:16:26,880
They don't kill them.
They bring them to the master as a sign

3074
02:16:26,881 --> 02:16:29,040
of respect,
show respect,

3075
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:30,160
plus they don't

3076
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:33,120
kill it.
So she brought a live rabbit into my

3077
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:37,720
who's like a rabbit.
Must've been having a tough day.

3078
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:39,250
Oh dude.
But it went off.

3079
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:42,710
It went all freaking possum on you.
It just laid there and I carried it

3080
02:16:42,740 --> 02:16:44,730
down,
put it down to the runaway.

3081
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:48,400
Actually about 10 minutes is what it
took it to come out of frozen state.

3082
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:51,280
I mean it just got eight by poodle and
brought into bed with me.

3083
02:16:51,460 --> 02:16:53,560
It probably feels like as long as it's
alive,

3084
02:16:53,561 --> 02:16:58,020
just to go with this,
just go limp and hope you're just a toy.

3085
02:16:58,090 --> 02:16:59,380
Just hope it happens.
Yeah.

3086
02:16:59,381 --> 02:17:02,020
That's the good thing.
She's got her own instagram.

3087
02:17:02,021 --> 02:17:05,920
She's doing well.
She's always showing off domestic dogs,

3088
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:07,660
right?
Like they don't need to eat.

3089
02:17:08,170 --> 02:17:10,100
They don't need to kill you to eat.
So they're,

3090
02:17:10,101 --> 02:17:11,710
they're only,
they're only grabbing you.

3091
02:17:11,711 --> 02:17:15,080
So rabbit's probably just keep it
together and he'll eventually get bored.

3092
02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:16,900
Exactly.
Has really want to eat you.

3093
02:17:16,990 --> 02:17:19,570
What does that to a poodle?
16,

3094
02:17:19,571 --> 02:17:22,300
49.
An engraving.

3095
02:17:22,310 --> 02:17:24,700
Okay.
How about in 16?

3096
02:17:24,701 --> 02:17:27,520
40 nine?
They already fucked dogs up to that

3097
02:17:27,521 --> 02:17:32,521
point because all dogs come from wolves.
That's what one of the favorite read

3098
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:34,800
are.
They one of the biggest.

3099
02:17:36,130 --> 02:17:41,130
One of the weirdest stories that came
out of a genetics is understanding that

3100
02:17:41,230 --> 02:17:44,200
all dogs came from wolves.
They didn't think that.

3101
02:17:44,201 --> 02:17:47,740
I think I'm pretty sure they thought
that all dogs.

3102
02:17:47,741 --> 02:17:52,240
We're like a combination of a bunch of
different things like wild dogs and

3103
02:17:52,241 --> 02:17:55,750
different things that eventually became
like a mass diff or something,

3104
02:17:56,110 --> 02:18:01,030
but now they realize no,
every single dog from a chihuahua to a

3105
02:18:01,031 --> 02:18:03,580
great dane comes from a wolf.
Yeah,

3106
02:18:03,581 --> 02:18:06,160
but I mean there are some dogs that.
What do you do with them?

3107
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:10,050
I meaN you've got 150 pound massive that
just lays there and slobbers.

3108
02:18:10,150 --> 02:18:13,210
I had 140 pound master if he lived to be
13 years old.

3109
02:18:13,211 --> 02:18:14,870
He was awesome.
He's a greaT dog now.

3110
02:18:14,871 --> 02:18:18,600
They're great dogs with this air and
they're smart.

3111
02:18:18,910 --> 02:18:21,070
TheY're smart and they're big and I
don't like take.

3112
02:18:21,130 --> 02:18:22,330
I don't.
I don't mind.

3113
02:18:22,390 --> 02:18:23,830
I mean,
especially here in California,

3114
02:18:23,831 --> 02:18:25,730
you got to pick up the dogs crap.
But yeah,

3115
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:28,810
you don't want to pick up a crap that's
bigger than mine.

3116
02:18:29,030 --> 02:18:30,130
Texas.
You find dog.

3117
02:18:30,131 --> 02:18:33,430
She just shoot it.
Now you got to pick it up.

3118
02:18:33,431 --> 02:18:34,090
It's,
it's,

3119
02:18:34,090 --> 02:18:37,810
it's everywhere.
There's people walking along and that

3120
02:18:37,811 --> 02:18:38,830
just cracks me up.
I'm like,

3121
02:18:38,831 --> 02:18:41,950
I'm going to follow this giant animal
around and pick up and shit.

3122
02:18:42,010 --> 02:18:44,560
That's the least of your worries.
The real problem is it doesn't

3123
02:18:44,561 --> 02:18:48,150
understand how big it is.
and it knocks people downstairs and you

3124
02:18:48,190 --> 02:18:50,920
gotta be real careful.
If you have steep stairs and a big dog,

3125
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:53,290
you have to really train that
motherfucker correctly.

3126
02:18:53,560 --> 02:18:54,281
You have to let them know,
hey,

3127
02:18:54,281 --> 02:18:58,000
you can't jump on the four year old at
the top stair you fucking dummy.

3128
02:18:59,140 --> 02:19:01,990
But he's a dog.
He's just loves you.

3129
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:03,220
They love you.
Get a,

3130
02:19:03,310 --> 02:19:04,240
you know,
bIg dogs.

3131
02:19:04,241 --> 02:19:08,530
Like my friend Johnny Cash was my dog.
He's um,

3132
02:19:08,770 --> 02:19:12,190
and uh,
my friend joe sold it to me and he was a

3133
02:19:12,191 --> 02:19:14,320
trainer of dogs for movies and shit.
Like,

3134
02:19:15,010 --> 02:19:15,761
you know,
the movie,

3135
02:19:15,761 --> 02:19:20,350
the incredible hulk with the one with
eric bana when nick nolte,

3136
02:19:20,351 --> 02:19:22,540
he plays his dad and nicole is the bad
guy.

3137
02:19:22,541 --> 02:19:26,830
And he's like a scientist and he sticks
the hulk serum into these dogs and he

3138
02:19:26,831 --> 02:19:29,480
turns these dogs,
these big giant hoking mastiffs.

3139
02:19:29,630 --> 02:19:34,630
While the original dog was actually my
friend's dog and he was a trainer of

3140
02:19:34,911 --> 02:19:38,360
these dogs and he brought them to fear
failure and on fear factor.

3141
02:19:38,361 --> 02:19:41,930
These doctors just laying around like
super chill like that.

3142
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:45,020
That's the cartoon dog.
But there was lIke a real dog before

3143
02:19:45,021 --> 02:19:46,520
that.
His name the dog was,

3144
02:19:46,850 --> 02:19:50,660
he's a regency massive and his name was
curly.

3145
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:53,690
So anyway,
this guy,

3146
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:58,240
he developed these.
He raised these dogs and made them too.

3147
02:19:58,780 --> 02:20:02,120
He bred them to this place where they
just had no aggression,

3148
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:06,290
no aggression to dogs,
no aggression to people like this dog

3149
02:20:06,291 --> 02:20:09,560
was like a hulk,
just a giant mass muscle.

3150
02:20:09,650 --> 02:20:11,560
But you can come up to it.
Anybody come up to him,

3151
02:20:11,570 --> 02:20:13,790
pet it.
Little kids were petting it and he was

3152
02:20:13,791 --> 02:20:17,060
like gently kissing their face.
He was the sweetheart of sweethearts.

3153
02:20:17,550 --> 02:20:20,630
We run in here and look at one more.
We got more people out there.

3154
02:20:20,810 --> 02:20:24,110
I'm good.
But anyway,

3155
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:26,300
he's a big dog.
But he was a super sweetheart.

3156
02:20:26,450 --> 02:20:29,130
It's all about like breeders know,
like how they breed them.

3157
02:20:29,140 --> 02:20:29,973
Yeah,
for sure.

3158
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:33,170
What kind of dogs do you have?
Just a fifi.

3159
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:35,000
The poodle.
Standard poodle.

3160
02:20:36,250 --> 02:20:38,990
How much does fifi way?
Probably 60.

3161
02:20:39,140 --> 02:20:42,320
So reasonable shit.
You're cleaning up a reasonable handful.

3162
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:46,580
I know several times a day.
It's like if you have like an english

3163
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:48,490
mastiff.
No,

3164
02:20:48,510 --> 02:20:50,290
you got.
You don't have the one bag,

3165
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:53,240
two bags a hunk of shit.
Then you've got to figure out how to

3166
02:20:53,241 --> 02:20:58,241
roll this one and roll with this and
got a pot roast of shit that comes ouT

3167
02:20:58,731 --> 02:21:01,550
of that animal's asshole every few
hours.

3168
02:21:01,790 --> 02:21:03,270
It's insane.
Yeah.

3169
02:21:03,300 --> 02:21:06,890
That's a poor.
Fellows and gals don't live very long

3170
02:21:06,891 --> 02:21:08,150
though,
unfortunately.

3171
02:21:08,380 --> 02:21:10,970
That's what's sad.
Those really big dogs like eight,

3172
02:21:10,971 --> 02:21:12,080
nine years.
They're done.

3173
02:21:12,140 --> 02:21:14,480
Mine lived to be 13,
which was extraordinary.

3174
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:17,560
That's pretty old,
but he was hurt and I had,

3175
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:22,400
I couldn't walk.
I would have to carry him to his food

3176
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:24,200
and then carry him back outside.

3177
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:25,850
So you can go to the bathroom.
It was bad

3178
02:21:28,860 --> 02:21:32,540
trials and tribulations of big dogs.
They're just on the jra.

3179
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:35,460
Uh,
you can tune in on a screener document,

3180
02:21:42,530 --> 02:21:44,810
might be one of the greatest things
that's ever happened in the history of

3181
02:21:44,811 --> 02:21:48,020
this show.
Is [inaudible] dot com trending yet?

3182
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:50,780
For sure.
For sure.

3183
02:21:50,781 --> 02:21:54,230
and people are going to be mad at us.
Why didn't you have to use a derogatory

3184
02:21:54,231 --> 02:21:55,890
term for months?
China?

3185
02:21:56,080 --> 02:21:58,280
Well,
I call it a big deck screener.

3186
02:21:58,400 --> 02:22:00,980
He's guys are dicks.
They're assholes.

3187
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:03,880
Dixon assholes.
And yet you chose con.

3188
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:06,430
Wait,
we were thinking about manhole,

3189
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:10,760
but it's the same.
But Australia has the proper use of the

3190
02:22:10,761 --> 02:22:14,690
word cunt and too much reverence to that
word in America.

3191
02:22:14,900 --> 02:22:17,180
people get confused about it.
And Australia,

3192
02:22:17,181 --> 02:22:20,700
they just throw that bitch around like
it's a beach ball concert.

3193
02:22:20,850 --> 02:22:22,400
I've some australians on mY show.
Yeah.

3194
02:22:22,410 --> 02:22:23,760
It's like even,
you know,

3195
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:24,681
I'm from Texas.
I'm like,

3196
02:22:24,681 --> 02:22:26,820
holy shit.
He's saying that we're a lot of these

3197
02:22:26,830 --> 02:22:29,250
fucking cunt.
He's a good can't.

3198
02:22:29,430 --> 02:22:31,130
That's my favorite.
He's a good cat.

3199
02:22:31,170 --> 02:22:33,210
He's a good cat.
And they made that like,

3200
02:22:33,240 --> 02:22:37,380
you might as well Be replacing the word
cunt for dude because it's all about

3201
02:22:37,381 --> 02:22:39,540
intent to them.
It's basically saying,

3202
02:22:39,541 --> 02:22:40,321
hey,
he's a good dude.

3203
02:22:40,321 --> 02:22:42,850
He's a good dude and there's not as good
con.

3204
02:22:43,110 --> 02:22:45,390
There you go.
It's not bad.

3205
02:22:48,290 --> 02:22:50,420
Got to have a set of these.
That steel though.

3206
02:22:50,460 --> 02:22:52,960
This is a plastic sell.
Their company that,

3207
02:22:52,961 --> 02:22:55,030
uh,
is uh,

3208
02:22:55,130 --> 02:22:58,210

3209
02:22:58,420 --> 02:23:00,060

these are hand painted little kid.
Yeah.

3211
02:23:03,011 --> 02:23:04,210
This guy's a beast,
man.

3212
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:09,190
A plastic sell on instagram.
He makes all the stuff that's pretty

3213
02:23:09,191 --> 02:23:09,911
rad.
No,

3214
02:23:09,911 --> 02:23:10,840
he's,
he's wicked.

3215
02:23:11,560 --> 02:23:15,320
He made one for my dog.
Oh,

3216
02:23:15,340 --> 02:23:16,930
he did?
John wick and his dog.

3217
02:23:17,020 --> 02:23:20,200
that's from john wick dose.
Not john brick.

3218
02:23:20,230 --> 02:23:21,700
Uno function.
I'm twisted.

3219
02:23:26,490 --> 02:23:29,070
Can I have to couch surf from john wick
one?

3220
02:23:30,730 --> 02:23:32,640
I'm wrong.
Moves from john wick one that he had the

3221
02:23:32,641 --> 02:23:33,421
pit bull.
Yeah,

3222
02:23:33,421 --> 02:23:34,770
it was.
Yeah.

3223
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:35,971
Yeah.
John wick two.

3224
02:23:35,971 --> 02:23:39,930
They killed the beagle and then he had
the pit bull and they started going and

3225
02:23:39,931 --> 02:23:42,480
killing spree.
It doesn't have it three out now.

3226
02:23:42,770 --> 02:23:45,210
They're another one working on it.
It's coming out soon.

3227
02:23:45,470 --> 02:23:46,201
Yeah,
he's a cool cat.

3228
02:23:46,201 --> 02:23:50,490
I ran into him at a deus ex machina down
in santa monica,

3229
02:23:50,491 --> 02:23:54,150
venice area.
And he was on one of his bikes and super

3230
02:23:54,151 --> 02:23:55,140
cool,
rad dude,

3231
02:23:55,141 --> 02:23:55,771
just,
hey,

3232
02:23:55,771 --> 02:23:59,220
what's up?
And keanu reeves must be one of the

3233
02:23:59,221 --> 02:24:01,200
nicest,
coolest people in the planet because no

3234
02:24:01,201 --> 02:24:03,750
one has a bad word to say about that guy
ever.

3235
02:24:04,290 --> 02:24:06,950
He might.
He might be what we should all surprised

3236
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:09,510
or be.
We should all aspire to be keaNu reeves

3237
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:13,080
who you might have sOme really crazy
secrets that he's the nicest.

3238
02:24:13,110 --> 02:24:15,780
It seems like everybody runs into him,
you know,

3239
02:24:15,781 --> 02:24:17,250
like,
I'm sure there's some people that ran

3240
02:24:17,251 --> 02:24:21,060
into you or they call you the wrong way
and they're all went sideways for a

3241
02:24:21,061 --> 02:24:21,930
little bit.
Nah,

3242
02:24:21,931 --> 02:24:22,890
not really.
I mean,

3243
02:24:26,140 --> 02:24:30,510
but no fucking keanu reeves got it going
on.

3244
02:24:30,540 --> 02:24:32,400
But the point,
what I was going to get to is one of the

3245
02:24:32,401 --> 02:24:37,401
things that those movies did was they,
they elevated the profile of those

3246
02:24:38,041 --> 02:24:42,360
muscle cars because people saw that
movie and they went this guy for.

3247
02:24:42,361 --> 02:24:44,520
There's something about him.
I know he's murdering people.

3248
02:24:44,521 --> 02:24:45,900
I know he's the best at murdering
people.

3249
02:24:45,901 --> 02:24:48,000
I know he killed three guys in a bar
with a pencil.

3250
02:24:48,030 --> 02:24:50,970
I know that.
But look how fucking cool he looks.

3251
02:24:51,090 --> 02:24:53,340
He's got.
He's got the dopest suits.

3252
02:24:53,490 --> 02:24:56,160
He's killing people.
He's not killing people in an under

3253
02:24:56,161 --> 02:24:57,280
armour rash guard.
Okay?

3254
02:24:57,281 --> 02:25:00,990
He's killing people in the dopest suits.
He stabbing people in the neck and he's

3255
02:25:00,991 --> 02:25:05,860
driving a seventY chevelle ss.
But the trick is unlocks your fore

3256
02:25:05,861 --> 02:25:09,060
mentioned in loved eleanor.
It wasn't plasticized.

3257
02:25:09,061 --> 02:25:12,090
It was a real fricken muscle car.
Didn't have shit hanging all over it.

3258
02:25:12,091 --> 02:25:13,710
And extra side pipes.
YOu're right,

3259
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:16,800
you're right.
But you're also wrong because eleanor,

3260
02:25:16,860 --> 02:25:19,290
look at that.
God dammit,

3261
02:25:19,590 --> 02:25:21,890
I'm going to kill somebody.
I'm doing it just like that.

3262
02:25:21,930 --> 02:25:23,820
God,
come on,

3263
02:25:23,830 --> 02:25:24,070
it gets

3264
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:26,350
out of his shoe.
He's got craters on it.

3265
02:25:26,980 --> 02:25:29,610
Chevelle.
Ss from 1970 with krieger's.

3266
02:25:29,670 --> 02:25:31,910
It's torque for us.
Look at our control or this.

3267
02:25:32,060 --> 02:25:35,000
Yeah,
look how good he looks with that craig

3268
02:25:35,010 --> 02:25:36,810
or style,
um,

3269
02:25:37,230 --> 02:25:40,480
that.
That's a classic white wall tire.

3270
02:25:40,481 --> 02:25:41,410
I mean,
come on man.

3271
02:25:41,411 --> 02:25:44,140
Or white letter tire.
Raised white letters.

3272
02:25:44,170 --> 02:25:45,500
Come on.
That's class.

3273
02:25:45,550 --> 02:25:48,670
Or you can get your own.
Now you can get your name on it.

3274
02:25:48,730 --> 02:25:51,880
You could do anything because of gas.
There's a time that sells these

3275
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,830
stickers,
monkey tires.

3276
02:25:53,890 --> 02:25:57,280
I should,
but you can actually order stickers now

3277
02:25:57,281 --> 02:25:59,850
that,
that are the rubber letters that fused

3278
02:25:59,851 --> 02:26:03,250
themselves into the rubber on your tire.
So you end up with a white letter like

3279
02:26:03,251 --> 02:26:05,410
that and you put anything on there.
Wow.

3280
02:26:05,470 --> 02:26:08,890
Like joe roGan or you know,
constantly.

3281
02:26:10,410 --> 02:26:15,410
Pretty
sure someone's going to send you and me

3282
02:26:16,390 --> 02:26:17,810
photos of their car.

3283
02:26:17,810 --> 02:26:21,320
A 1970 chevelle rolling around with
screener.com.

3284
02:26:21,370 --> 02:26:24,140
Another company that does.
It's going to send a sets for our car.

3285
02:26:25,790 --> 02:26:28,150
I don't think.
I don't think they'll let you in the

3286
02:26:28,151 --> 02:26:30,250
golf course that she had after the
burrito incident.

3287
02:26:30,310 --> 02:26:33,010
I guarantee you they'll make it on small
little golf cart tires.

3288
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:38,440
I need a set of tires for 10 inch wheel.
Need a smaller font?

3289
02:26:38,441 --> 02:26:42,280
Please try to fix this electric golf
cart.

3290
02:26:42,670 --> 02:26:44,140
That's all.
I'Ve got a golf cart.

3291
02:26:44,141 --> 02:26:45,610
I dragged my neighborhood.
That's insane.

3292
02:26:45,611 --> 02:26:49,390
It's a polaris like four cedar with the
little truck bed.

3293
02:26:50,230 --> 02:26:52,630
and uh,
I drive it all around the neighborhood

3294
02:26:52,631 --> 02:26:55,000
because I got a nice little neighborhood
and get to the grocery store.

3295
02:26:55,001 --> 02:26:57,040
I get to get something to eat,
could go to the bar or whatever.

3296
02:26:57,340 --> 02:27:00,310
And uh,
so I raised total hell with this thing.

3297
02:27:00,370 --> 02:27:01,860
I dropped through people's yards,
you know,

3298
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:03,430
I'm,
I'm a great neighbor because I'm really

3299
02:27:03,431 --> 02:27:05,320
fun and if I do accidentally fuck
something up,

3300
02:27:05,321 --> 02:27:08,440
I will definitely pay for it.
But at the same time they're like,

3301
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:11,410
okay,
does it have to have 32,000 speakers on

3302
02:27:11,411 --> 02:27:13,240
it?
And a 50 inch television screen.

3303
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:20,830
A white wall.
Tires don't exist.

3304
02:27:20,831 --> 02:27:24,520
What happened to white wall tires?
But the only exists on classic cars.

3305
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:26,620
Oh yeah.
You're not going to see him or anything

3306
02:27:26,621 --> 02:27:28,660
new,
but the lettered tires are starting to

3307
02:27:28,661 --> 02:27:32,500
get more popular with brand new ones.
But the white wall now remember the four

3308
02:27:32,501 --> 02:27:33,980
or five inch white wall.
All right.

3309
02:27:33,981 --> 02:27:35,260
I'm going to tell you,
I'm going to talk to you about a

3310
02:27:35,261 --> 02:27:36,850
polarizing issue.
Yeah.

3311
02:27:37,820 --> 02:27:39,010
Ready?
Raw.

3312
02:27:39,070 --> 02:27:40,060
Well,
porsches,

3313
02:27:41,830 --> 02:27:43,150
I have no idea what you're talking
about.

3314
02:27:43,430 --> 02:27:44,360
I'm talking about.
Nope.

3315
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:49,560
those wide body weird japanese style
body kits they put on old porsches,

3316
02:27:51,580 --> 02:27:56,140
liberty walk shit or giant white ass
bodies are a.

3317
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:59,200
You got it.
I don't know anything about here is r a

3318
02:27:59,201 --> 02:28:02,800
u h w e l t.
How the fuck do you not know about this?

3319
02:28:03,870 --> 02:28:07,270
Can afford collecting porsches,
but none of these are old cars.

3320
02:28:07,390 --> 02:28:10,600
These are not the most expensive cars.
The one that's an old accordion bumper

3321
02:28:10,601 --> 02:28:13,240
that's been smoothed out.
And so it's like 78,

3322
02:28:13,300 --> 02:28:16,040
79.
But you see the bolt on bumpers or the.

3323
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:17,740
Excuse me,
the bolt on fender flares.

3324
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:19,420
I like that we in the front.
Yeah.

3325
02:28:19,660 --> 02:28:21,890
Well this gentleman out of Japan

3326
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:27,550
and he does all of these raw welt cars
by hand and uh,

3327
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:30,830
go to him.
What is the guy's name?

3328
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:32,900
So I could uh,
give the guy that his props.

3329
02:28:33,050 --> 02:28:35,930
But that dude right there with the.
I love r w t shirt on.

3330
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:39,560
He's a,
his name is kierra and the chi and he

3331
02:28:39,561 --> 02:28:41,960
all raw.
Well cars he does himself.

3332
02:28:41,961 --> 02:28:45,140
So he'll fly out from Japan.
He saw cells,

3333
02:28:45,141 --> 02:28:50,141
you're fucking fenders off.
Puts these flares on the front and the

3334
02:28:50,241 --> 02:28:52,700
rear.
There's some amazing videos of him

3335
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:56,930
because he's a real character.
He's chain smoking cigarettes the entire

3336
02:28:56,931 --> 02:29:00,110
time and he's like measuring the shit.
He does it all by hand.

3337
02:29:00,290 --> 02:29:04,440
He lays the caulking around the edge by
weather sealing.

3338
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:05,510
That's the guy right there.

3339
02:29:05,550 --> 02:29:08,280
I'm going out on a limb,
then I'm going to invite him to come to

3340
02:29:08,281 --> 02:29:13,270
Texas and do my rave.
I will in porsche.

3341
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:15,750
Well,
I've been considering doing a wide body

3342
02:29:15,751 --> 02:29:20,340
on my race just for the hell of it.
And I would let him go do it if he would

3343
02:29:20,341 --> 02:29:22,770
be interested in it.
That would be amazing episode.

3344
02:29:22,860 --> 02:29:25,910
But if you wanted to just do what he
does and,

3345
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:27,290
and,
and you know,

3346
02:29:27,690 --> 02:29:30,180
get a porsche,
like that's kind of his style,

3347
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:34,440
but he takes these things and makes them
fucking cartoonish wide.

3348
02:29:34,810 --> 02:29:36,930
Well fuck.
That just cracks me up.

3349
02:29:36,931 --> 02:29:40,790
You're dealing with like 20 inch tires.
That's fricken super close.

3350
02:29:40,850 --> 02:29:43,950
They're outstanding.
My deal with gas monkey,

3351
02:29:43,951 --> 02:29:44,701
like you say,
okay,

3352
02:29:44,701 --> 02:29:46,620
well I could actually tell you,
yeah,

3353
02:29:46,621 --> 02:29:48,000
we can do that,
but I'm like,

3354
02:29:48,330 --> 02:29:51,120
this guy's known for bringing us as in
let's have some fun.

3355
02:29:51,420 --> 02:29:55,300
Let's watch his talent.
I gotta I gotta I gotta situation there.

3356
02:29:55,320 --> 02:29:58,200
That's what rutledge from top gear,
you know,

3357
02:29:58,201 --> 02:29:59,530
rutledge would,
uh,

3358
02:29:59,540 --> 02:30:01,290
I know the name,
he's a nice guy,

3359
02:30:01,291 --> 02:30:03,120
super nice guy.
He's been on this podcast before.

3360
02:30:03,121 --> 02:30:06,890
He's doing one of those cars and he's
doing it with a,

3361
02:30:06,891 --> 02:30:10,170
an ls swap.
So instead of using an air cooled

3362
02:30:10,171 --> 02:30:11,370
engine,
we already did it.

3363
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:12,690
Oh,
you already did that.

3364
02:30:14,730 --> 02:30:17,280
It's a good move.
Why is it so prohibitive?

3365
02:30:17,850 --> 02:30:18,571
Oh,
I don't know.

3366
02:30:18,571 --> 02:30:19,950
It's a porsche people,
you know,

3367
02:30:19,951 --> 02:30:21,930
the scientists,
the seinfelds of the worlds and god

3368
02:30:21,931 --> 02:30:23,430
bless you side.
They're like,

3369
02:30:23,460 --> 02:30:25,290
ah,
it's not original purists.

3370
02:30:26,130 --> 02:30:31,130
We did a nine slash nine slash 2000 2001
convertible and did the ls swap.

3371
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:37,040
And we finished that in 2000 late 2016.
And I had a brand new 2017,

3372
02:30:39,271 --> 02:30:41,300
nine slash 11 turbo s,
uh,

3373
02:30:41,310 --> 02:30:44,160
in the signal green.
And if I didn't mess with the buttons,

3374
02:30:44,220 --> 02:30:47,610
if I didn't turn off all the stuff,
I could not get away from that car till

3375
02:30:47,611 --> 02:30:50,430
about 140 miles an hour.
I couldn't get away.

3376
02:30:51,100 --> 02:30:54,360
Look at this thing.
This is it.

3377
02:30:54,510 --> 02:30:56,160
Look at that.
Who is lord?

3378
02:30:56,670 --> 02:30:57,820
We went freaking.
Oh,

3379
02:30:57,821 --> 02:30:59,600
you changed the headlights to so nine,
nine,

3380
02:30:59,620 --> 02:31:00,451
six.
He went with a nine,

3381
02:31:00,451 --> 02:31:01,380
nine,
seven headlines.

3382
02:31:01,850 --> 02:31:06,850
That car was so frigging
with nine slash 11 gt three.

3383
02:31:09,031 --> 02:31:11,550
The front where the bumper is.
Open vents.

3384
02:31:11,610 --> 02:31:13,600
Oh my goodness.
Car was fricking great.

3385
02:31:13,610 --> 02:31:15,660
Dairy really tear it up.
That's beautiful.

3386
02:31:15,661 --> 02:31:18,390
Where is it?
A friend of mine owns it.

3387
02:31:19,140 --> 02:31:20,130
I told him,
I said,

3388
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:21,660
you can buy the car,
but if you ever sell it,

3389
02:31:21,661 --> 02:31:23,580
you've got to ask me first.
He would fuck him.

3390
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:24,710
I know,
right?

3391
02:31:24,710 --> 02:31:25,880
Fuck him,
tony.

3392
02:31:26,250 --> 02:31:27,420
Tony,
you suck.

3393
02:31:27,450 --> 02:31:29,220
You have that car.
The thing about those,

3394
02:31:29,820 --> 02:31:32,340
it's so weird that you're not allowed to
do that,

3395
02:31:32,810 --> 02:31:33,860
but.
But hell,

3396
02:31:35,860 --> 02:31:37,440
that was three years ago,
man.

3397
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:41,610
Oh my goodness.
There's not again.

3398
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:43,740
All right.
Put that right next to the mustang.

3399
02:31:43,741 --> 02:31:46,020
Mach one.
It's not better.

3400
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:48,080
It's just different.
Yeah,

3401
02:31:48,120 --> 02:31:51,630
there's whole fucking credible.
They both have the same reaction like

3402
02:31:51,631 --> 02:31:54,210
that car,
which is a 2001.

3403
02:31:54,240 --> 02:31:56,090
That was like a zero or a one.
Yeah.

3404
02:31:56,140 --> 02:31:58,500
Was that car?
The way it's modified,

3405
02:31:58,501 --> 02:32:01,650
the way it's put together,
it is so fucking pretty.

3406
02:32:01,890 --> 02:32:04,530
If you had that next in that 69 mach
one,

3407
02:32:04,890 --> 02:32:07,950
they're just a different taste.
It's a different feel,

3408
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:11,940
but that's a fucking amazing car and
maybe in the future you might look at

3409
02:32:11,941 --> 02:32:14,370
that one even better when you consider
the performance.

3410
02:32:14,460 --> 02:32:15,810
That's my other car.
A tuner.

3411
02:32:15,811 --> 02:32:17,700
We built the down there,
the two 80.

3412
02:32:17,701 --> 02:32:18,990
See the green one.

3413
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:26,190
I always wanted to 40,
but that's a to 80 with 13,000 original

3414
02:32:26,191 --> 02:32:31,191
miles and we went nuts with that.
And did the whole a lexus swap as 22

3415
02:32:31,711 --> 02:32:32,750
jays,
whatever.

3416
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:34,370
Let her tires.
Oh yeah.

3417
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:38,880
Bringing them back at car was cool.
I sold it to a customer,

3418
02:32:38,881 --> 02:32:43,881
no bullshit for a pretty amazing amount
of money for a to a to z and it was

3419
02:32:44,791 --> 02:32:47,700
being shipped and the truck burn to the
fucking ground.

3420
02:32:49,490 --> 02:32:50,850
Yeah.
What happened?

3421
02:32:51,030 --> 02:32:53,970
Who knows?
But the whole trailer burn to the

3422
02:32:53,971 --> 02:32:54,511
ground.
Well,

3423
02:32:54,511 --> 02:32:58,500
you know how there's been these fires
out here in the northeast,

3424
02:32:58,501 --> 02:33:01,860
but still do you know about California
has had some pretty crazy fires.

3425
02:33:02,070 --> 02:33:03,540
There's a guy up the street that are
really nice.

3426
02:33:03,541 --> 02:33:08,500
Three series bmw burned to the ground.
It's still sitting there.

3427
02:33:08,501 --> 02:33:11,190
I took pictures of it.
I put it on my instagram out.

3428
02:33:11,191 --> 02:33:12,150
You need to tell him to call me.

3429
02:33:12,150 --> 02:33:15,720
Here's what I think we do because there
have been some really amazing cars that

3430
02:33:15,721 --> 02:33:18,660
have burned with the fires that happened
this past year.

3431
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:21,200
The panels are still good though,
right?

3432
02:33:21,390 --> 02:33:23,280
Don't worry about the panels.
We take them.

3433
02:33:23,370 --> 02:33:26,040
I need to make you this in here.
This conference table.

3434
02:33:26,310 --> 02:33:30,720
You take it and that's it.
So you take the real special car that

3435
02:33:30,721 --> 02:33:32,670
burned down.
You blow everything out,

3436
02:33:32,671 --> 02:33:34,800
you clear coated so it doesn't stink and
what have you.

3437
02:33:35,100 --> 02:33:40,100
We put a glass top on it and you have a
conference table called burning up the

3438
02:33:40,501 --> 02:33:45,501
competition who are whatever,
but I think I think some of those really

3439
02:33:45,631 --> 02:33:47,760
expensive burned out cars would make
really cool.

3440
02:33:47,761 --> 02:33:49,050
Conference tables.
Yeah.

3441
02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:51,000
Good art projects.
Yeah,

3442
02:33:51,030 --> 02:33:51,811
for sure.
Background.

3443
02:33:51,811 --> 02:33:54,250
You got lucky bitch.
Just having a big plaque.

3444
02:33:55,480 --> 02:33:57,840
You got lucky bitch.
You weren't in the wrong place.

3445
02:33:57,841 --> 02:33:59,520
The wrong time.
Yeah,

3446
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:01,260
I.
I'm a big fan of those.

3447
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:06,320
E 46 m three's those 2000 ish.
I do not know him.

3448
02:34:07,201 --> 02:34:09,750
I don't know,
can I be a w dot?

3449
02:34:10,360 --> 02:34:11,800
There you go.
Good.

3450
02:34:11,810 --> 02:34:14,790
I'm in american hot.
Rodder customs silver.

3451
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:16,870
He forTy six m.

3452
02:34:18,030 --> 02:34:20,500
he was saying so many numbers.
I was worried you were baiting me to see

3453
02:34:20,501 --> 02:34:21,490
if I'd like that.
Yeah,

3454
02:34:21,491 --> 02:34:23,920
those are cool.
There was no 40 6:00 PM.

3455
02:34:23,921 --> 02:34:25,360
Three 46.

3456
02:34:26,030 --> 02:34:29,960
It's a super well balanced.
Fifty slash 50 balance car from like

3457
02:34:30,020 --> 02:34:34,180
2002,
three and many people think it's like

3458
02:34:34,220 --> 02:34:38,510
the gold standard for [inaudible]
because [inaudible] there's something

3459
02:34:38,511 --> 02:34:41,840
that happened at [inaudible] and right
now I liked the fact that it [inaudible]

3460
02:34:41,870 --> 02:34:46,700
became an m for like stay right there.
Don't move [inaudible] muscular car.

3461
02:34:46,760 --> 02:34:50,180
That's a fucking good looking car
because the [inaudible] is a totallY

3462
02:34:50,181 --> 02:34:53,370
different thing than an m three.
It's beautiful and it's amazinG.

3463
02:34:53,371 --> 02:34:57,980
Like an [inaudible] from bmw is a,
an amazing driver.

3464
02:34:58,010 --> 02:34:59,840
like if you want to drive that car every
day,

3465
02:34:59,841 --> 02:35:04,190
you'll be super pleased.
That performance is unprecedented in the

3466
02:35:04,191 --> 02:35:08,090
edm world and most of the car world,
the only things that are faster like

3467
02:35:08,091 --> 02:35:11,480
fucking gtrs and corvettes that are zr
one zero,

3468
02:35:11,490 --> 02:35:15,690
zero six as a shit.
But it's different because in m three

3469
02:35:15,830 --> 02:35:19,790
was really light,
it was really light and uncomplicated.

3470
02:35:19,820 --> 02:35:22,600
There wasn't any traction control or if
there was,

3471
02:35:22,601 --> 02:35:26,180
it was minimal.
Mostly it was just antilock brakes and

3472
02:35:26,181 --> 02:35:27,320
it was a,
you know,

3473
02:35:27,410 --> 02:35:32,410
3000 pound car and it had 333 horsepower
and is perfectly balanced for the right

3474
02:35:32,811 --> 02:35:36,800
amount of thrust,
the right amount of grip with the tires

3475
02:35:36,801 --> 02:35:39,680
because they weren't the widest tires,
but they were wide enough.

3476
02:35:39,681 --> 02:35:42,350
they a little bit of fender flare that
made them wider than a standard three

3477
02:35:42,351 --> 02:35:45,050
series.
And it's just a perfect understated

3478
02:35:45,051 --> 02:35:48,080
looking car.
When you look at that [inaudible] 46 and

3479
02:35:48,081 --> 02:35:50,060
three,
you look at that car like that sudden

3480
02:35:50,120 --> 02:35:53,120
that's a fucking good neutral zone.
LIke they nailed it.

3481
02:35:53,570 --> 02:35:56,300
Cool.
If anybody has one of those I'm buying,

3482
02:35:57,870 --> 02:36:00,320
you can reach me to cast mucky duck,
sell it,

3483
02:36:02,510 --> 02:36:03,350
sold it,
right?

3484
02:36:03,410 --> 02:36:06,320
Well what we do is we buy like 10 or 20
of them and then we sell one at auction

3485
02:36:06,321 --> 02:36:08,420
for like 15 times what they normally
bring them.

3486
02:36:08,421 --> 02:36:10,400
Then we sell the rest of them.
But look at that car.

3487
02:36:10,610 --> 02:36:12,920
That's pretty damn good.
It's good car

3488
02:36:13,110 --> 02:36:15,060
you want,
but there's a balance.

3489
02:36:15,061 --> 02:36:18,630
That car.
It's not like a ferrari for 88 or some

3490
02:36:18,631 --> 02:36:21,210
shit like that where it's so outrageous.
Everybody goes,

3491
02:36:21,270 --> 02:36:22,500
everybody gets light.

3492
02:36:22,940 --> 02:36:24,860
no,
see you got me there because I don't

3493
02:36:24,861 --> 02:36:27,020
like rear engines.
Oh,

3494
02:36:27,021 --> 02:36:29,900
you don't?
Not in the ferrari tyPe stuff because to

3495
02:36:29,901 --> 02:36:33,860
me know if you get a friend engine b12
you're a sore.

3496
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:35,510
Look at that.
If you've got one behind you.

3497
02:36:35,570 --> 02:36:38,210
Oh,
you just got a contract of some sort and

3498
02:36:38,211 --> 02:36:40,370
you might not have that car next week.
Look at that car.

3499
02:36:41,660 --> 02:36:42,560
Alright.
Do you own one?

3500
02:36:42,670 --> 02:36:44,330
No,
I think I need to.

3501
02:36:44,900 --> 02:36:47,330
Cool.
I need to eat 46 m three in my life.

3502
02:36:47,331 --> 02:36:48,470
Look at that.
That's a.

3503
02:36:48,990 --> 02:36:52,340
It might be.
It's perfectly understated and yet

3504
02:36:52,341 --> 02:36:54,740
flashy.
It's like a balance.

3505
02:36:54,741 --> 02:36:57,020
So what's the value on that right now?
Because I'm serious.

3506
02:36:57,021 --> 02:36:59,900
I don't watch that kind of car.
They're not crazy.

3507
02:37:00,080 --> 02:37:02,780
They're not crazy becauSe I think people
overlook them.

3508
02:37:02,810 --> 02:37:06,550
They overlook them for more extravagant,
like [inaudible],

3509
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:09,190
which is the v eight years.
So if you go buy one,

3510
02:37:09,290 --> 02:37:12,520
what would you pay for one right now?
Let me just a nice California wine.

3511
02:37:12,530 --> 02:37:15,320
No rust.
I have brain damage so I've critical

3512
02:37:15,650 --> 02:37:16,070
thinking,

3513
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:17,470
see,
know off.

3514
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:20,250
I'd have to call my buddy dennis on
something like that because I just don't

3515
02:37:20,300 --> 02:37:21,290
know.
Those kinds of cars.

3516
02:37:21,330 --> 02:37:24,590
There's something about that car that's
very appealing because it's a balance

3517
02:37:24,591 --> 02:37:26,900
issue.
It's not like there's something about

3518
02:37:26,901 --> 02:37:28,790
the mach one that's like,
holy shit,

3519
02:37:28,820 --> 02:37:30,680
you know,
like America.

3520
02:37:30,820 --> 02:37:34,160
Fuck yeah.
So here's what,

3521
02:37:34,190 --> 02:37:35,000
here's what we do.
We,

3522
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:39,050
we put it out to the people listening.
Bring us a nice one owner,

3523
02:37:39,051 --> 02:37:41,420
low mile in three that it hasn't been
dragged out.

3524
02:37:42,470 --> 02:37:46,160
Six 46,
46 m three that it hasn't been dragged

3525
02:37:46,161 --> 02:37:49,640
out and I'll bid against you and we'll
see who gets it.

3526
02:37:49,970 --> 02:37:54,860
I had to m three's in a row at least two
and three's in a row from bmw for the v

3527
02:37:54,890 --> 02:37:58,250
eight years because it was so good.
It was my daily driver.

3528
02:37:58,251 --> 02:38:00,050
It was so good.
After I would get out of it,

3529
02:38:00,051 --> 02:38:01,640
I was like,
this car is everything.

3530
02:38:01,640 --> 02:38:04,700
I like.
It's understated and yet it's wicked,

3531
02:38:05,030 --> 02:38:08,560
it's got veto power,
but yet it's not preposterous.

3532
02:38:08,570 --> 02:38:12,710
Like the wheels don't break loose every
time you hit the gas it has a double

3533
02:38:12,711 --> 02:38:15,590
clutch transmission,
so it's good and traffic and it also has

3534
02:38:15,591 --> 02:38:19,760
a whale because it's got this high
revving va and in so many things that I

3535
02:38:19,761 --> 02:38:22,670
liked.
I got them in a row so they're going to

3536
02:38:22,671 --> 02:38:25,890
send this one on the inter webs and then
we'll send the shit.

3537
02:38:26,940 --> 02:38:30,490
I got a pretty good reach.
I think I can get ahold of bmw.

3538
02:38:30,550 --> 02:38:31,910
No,
I couldn't get ahold of the people that

3539
02:38:31,911 --> 02:38:36,320
own one in their garage right now that
are probably a at the golf club.

3540
02:38:36,590 --> 02:38:40,050
So we'll just bid against each other.
So you'll get to.

3541
02:38:40,120 --> 02:38:43,370
Because I don't know what will happen.
I'll let you get it by a different one.

3542
02:38:43,430 --> 02:38:45,800
I'm not that stupid pro.
How about we do this?

3543
02:38:48,200 --> 02:38:50,770
Let's buy two of them and race.
Um,

3544
02:38:50,780 --> 02:38:53,490
I'm not good at racing.
Straight line.

3545
02:38:54,010 --> 02:38:58,580
I don't care who gets there first.
I just like driving and no bullshit,

3546
02:38:58,610 --> 02:39:03,610
no bullshit from your wife.
But for real,

3547
02:39:09,980 --> 02:39:11,990
I don't.
I like watching racing,

3548
02:39:11,991 --> 02:39:13,760
but I really don't care if you get there
first.

3549
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:19,000
All I care is about going sideways and
correcting and hitting the target proper

3550
02:39:19,161 --> 02:39:24,161
apex and stomping on the gas and knowing
when to brake and knowing when to like

3551
02:39:24,330 --> 02:39:25,970
dig in.
If you get ahead of me,

3552
02:39:25,971 --> 02:39:27,710
I don't give a fuck.
I really don't.

3553
02:39:27,860 --> 02:39:30,560
I'm just trying to have fun because I'm
not a professional racer.

3554
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:34,310
NeIther of if that's all I wanted to do.
If I was danica patrick,

3555
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:37,370
then that's what I'd be into.
But I'm not and I,

3556
02:39:37,371 --> 02:39:39,590
I don't.
I really just like driving cars.

3557
02:39:39,650 --> 02:39:40,310
Yeah,
me too.

3558
02:39:40,310 --> 02:39:42,230
I'm not a racer at all.
If you and I drove,

3559
02:39:42,440 --> 02:39:44,030
I would let you win because I'd like
you.

3560
02:39:44,330 --> 02:39:48,280
Oh
yeah.

3561
02:39:48,570 --> 02:39:51,350
I'd let you win because I like you.
So we're just going to be sitting at the

3562
02:39:51,710 --> 02:39:56,560
starting line.
Look at that.

3563
02:39:56,570 --> 02:39:57,530
Look at that.
Look at that.

3564
02:39:57,550 --> 02:39:58,770
Two thousand,
140 6:00 PM.

3565
02:39:58,771 --> 02:40:02,230
Three
25.

3566
02:40:02,330 --> 02:40:04,070
I don't want to convertible.
Yeah,

3567
02:40:04,071 --> 02:40:05,600
I think that uh,
if you're going to drive it,

3568
02:40:05,601 --> 02:40:07,700
drive a car,
then you don't want to start with I have

3569
02:40:07,701 --> 02:40:10,940
one convertible.
I have a 1965.

3570
02:40:10,970 --> 02:40:13,680
It will find that hey,
let's find one on there and I'll buy it

3571
02:40:13,681 --> 02:40:14,190
right now.

3572
02:40:14,190 --> 02:40:17,100
I called the guy
I know.

3573
02:40:17,101 --> 02:40:21,820
Go sell them one of those.
Well you got 100 $8,500.

3574
02:40:22,470 --> 02:40:26,160
We'll get that 46,
six speed.

3575
02:40:26,400 --> 02:40:28,230
Low miles.
$13,000.

3576
02:40:28,290 --> 02:40:31,470
You can't even buy a 69 mach one for
anywhere near that.

3577
02:40:31,471 --> 02:40:33,540
Not even near that.
That's a good car too.

3578
02:40:33,920 --> 02:40:35,580
I would love that.
Caused some stereo.

3579
02:40:35,581 --> 02:40:37,650
He keeps it covered.
I'm a fan.

3580
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:42,750
I'm a fan.
I just think that there's some years

3581
02:40:43,310 --> 02:40:44,410
palace.
Virtus.

3582
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,330
Super close.
Okay.

3583
02:40:46,331 --> 02:40:49,170
If he can be here in the next uh,
20 minutes before we get it done or

3584
02:40:49,171 --> 02:40:51,750
however you want that close.
It's basically a long beach.

3585
02:40:51,800 --> 02:40:55,350
It's like an hour and a half.
Long term here is like four hours.

3586
02:40:55,351 --> 02:40:56,550
Three?
Yeah.

3587
02:40:56,551 --> 02:40:57,990
Three pm.
It's four hours.

3588
02:40:58,170 --> 02:40:59,850
Yeah.
It was sad that.

3589
02:40:59,851 --> 02:41:00,690
What do they got?
long beach.

3590
02:41:00,790 --> 02:41:02,160
Nothing.
His last queen,

3591
02:41:02,640 --> 02:41:04,620
the queen.
A queen elizabeth.

3592
02:41:04,621 --> 02:41:05,880
Whatever.
The queen mary.

3593
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:07,050
the queen mary.
Yeah.

3594
02:41:07,051 --> 02:41:08,940
There's a laugh factory down there in
long beach.

3595
02:41:08,940 --> 02:41:12,000
There's a lot of things.
A lumpy cfo always wanted to try comedy.

3596
02:41:12,330 --> 02:41:13,530
Really?
I,

3597
02:41:13,531 --> 02:41:14,341
I,
I,

3598
02:41:14,341 --> 02:41:16,470
um,
I just want to try it tonight.

3599
02:41:16,500 --> 02:41:18,970
No,
I'm not exactly prepared.

3600
02:41:19,390 --> 02:41:21,680
I can make it happen.
I just don't know how.

3601
02:41:21,681 --> 02:41:22,220
I mean,
I,

3602
02:41:22,220 --> 02:41:23,950
I know that it's a,
I mean,

3603
02:41:24,090 --> 02:41:27,090
it's a very rigid process and you have
to really refine.

3604
02:41:27,420 --> 02:41:29,700
And I've looked at it,
I've studied it and I'm like,

3605
02:41:29,820 --> 02:41:33,540
I think I could probably a funny dude.
I think you could do it 100 percent.

3606
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:35,490
No bullshit.
You 100 percent.

3607
02:41:35,491 --> 02:41:38,380
Could be a comedian.
I needed to go to comedian school does.

3608
02:41:38,550 --> 02:41:39,990
Doesn't exist.
Oh really?

3609
02:41:40,050 --> 02:41:42,240
Yeah.
This is what you gotta do you gotta make

3610
02:41:42,241 --> 02:41:44,910
friends with professional comedians?
Will be honest with you.

3611
02:41:45,820 --> 02:41:48,900
Like this is like what?
One of the beautiful things about comedy

3612
02:41:49,050 --> 02:41:52,470
is that it's very much a,
a brothership and a sister for sure.

3613
02:41:52,470 --> 02:41:53,260
I've seen it.
Yeah.

3614
02:41:53,260 --> 02:41:57,120
There's a brotherhood and sisterhood
that exists with comedies where there's

3615
02:41:57,121 --> 02:42:00,390
no institutions.
Even though it's like one of the

3616
02:42:00,391 --> 02:42:03,120
favorite things of people.
People love to laugh.

3617
02:42:03,270 --> 02:42:06,510
It's one of the rare things that gives
you a very specific reaction.

3618
02:42:06,930 --> 02:42:10,800
Like if you go to see a movie and it's
like a rock movie like jumanji or

3619
02:42:10,801 --> 02:42:11,880
something.
It's fun.

3620
02:42:11,940 --> 02:42:14,250
Sometimes it's funny.
Sometimes it's exciting,

3621
02:42:14,490 --> 02:42:17,160
but it's a bunch of shit going on.
You go to a c stand up,

3622
02:42:17,370 --> 02:42:21,390
you got to see Kevin Hart standup you.
You're going there because Kevin Hart is

3623
02:42:21,391 --> 02:42:22,590
drug dealer.
Okay.

3624
02:42:22,591 --> 02:42:26,370
That drug is laughter.
He's here to hit you with some fucking

3625
02:42:26,371 --> 02:42:30,680
high level gigantic arena laughter.
And you get to walk out of there going,

3626
02:42:30,690 --> 02:42:32,070
holy shit.
That was fun.

3627
02:42:32,071 --> 02:42:33,050
Yeah.
Woo.

3628
02:42:33,090 --> 02:42:35,050
Like he gave you some drugs.
Ah,

3629
02:42:35,051 --> 02:42:35,461
no.
I,

3630
02:42:35,461 --> 02:42:39,420
I think I might try one day.
You can do an open mic.

3631
02:42:39,690 --> 02:42:40,630
Go out there and go.
Hey,

3632
02:42:40,631 --> 02:42:42,930
I'm,
I'm richard from a screener.com.

3633
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:49,680
You can do it.
There's a lot of places.

3634
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:51,880
Addison improv.
Good spot.

3635
02:42:51,900 --> 02:42:53,070
Yeah.
Addison improv is great.

3636
02:42:53,100 --> 02:42:54,270
It's a great spot.
Not only that,

3637
02:42:54,390 --> 02:42:58,080
not only is that great,
right next door is the cobi steakhouse.

3638
02:42:58,110 --> 02:43:00,120
Yes.
And you can get out of the chop shop and

3639
02:43:00,121 --> 02:43:02,070
if you get hammered you can go to that
piano bars.

3640
02:43:02,071 --> 02:43:04,230
That piano bars till their piano bar is
still there,

3641
02:43:04,231 --> 02:43:07,450
but I'm the right next to coby is the,
uh,

3642
02:43:07,560 --> 02:43:08,880
memphis.
Uh,

3643
02:43:08,940 --> 02:43:13,090
it'S a lounge memphis lounge and that's
always a time I have met a few of my

3644
02:43:13,091 --> 02:43:13,924
wives there.

3645
02:43:17,010 --> 02:43:19,600
I've worked at many times.
That's a fun place to work.

3646
02:43:19,660 --> 02:43:22,690
I used to love to do that circuit.
What I would do is cap city in austin

3647
02:43:22,900 --> 02:43:27,900
and I would do the improv.
Well when did the.

3648
02:43:28,030 --> 02:43:31,120
There is an improv and addison,
but there's another improv to write

3649
02:43:31,121 --> 02:43:32,770
that.
I haven't done that in fort worth.

3650
02:43:32,920 --> 02:43:35,830
I think so.
I think there's one like 40 minutes

3651
02:43:35,831 --> 02:43:36,410
away.
Yeah,

3652
02:43:36,410 --> 02:43:39,850
it's like fort worth.
And then there was a laugh stop in

3653
02:43:39,851 --> 02:43:42,850
houston and that was the run.
We'll see.

3654
02:43:43,670 --> 02:43:44,503
Dallas,
you need to,

3655
02:43:44,610 --> 02:43:49,190
you need to do gas monkey live.
I hold about 2007 people.

3656
02:43:49,191 --> 02:43:51,060
And what is it?
You have a concert place?

3657
02:43:51,220 --> 02:43:52,660
Yeah,
I've had motley crue there.

3658
02:43:53,050 --> 02:43:54,270
Dude.
I graduated high school in [inaudible]

3659
02:43:54,271 --> 02:43:56,650
87 and somebody had told me two things.
One,

3660
02:43:56,651 --> 02:43:59,860
you're going to build a car.
That hot wheels is going to make and to

3661
02:44:00,060 --> 02:44:01,270
you're going to a motley crew at your
bar.

3662
02:44:01,510 --> 02:44:02,380
I'm like,
no way.

3663
02:44:02,490 --> 02:44:05,770
That's incredible.
So is this the place that you were

3664
02:44:05,771 --> 02:44:07,270
building on your show?
Yeah.

3665
02:44:07,271 --> 02:44:09,950
Yeah.
You have a 2000 seat place there?

3666
02:44:10,660 --> 02:44:13,710
Yeah,
I think we're 22 now.

3667
02:44:13,830 --> 02:44:17,200
What's,
what's really bitching about this is uh,

3668
02:44:17,250 --> 02:44:20,260
the,
the stage is solid concrete.

3669
02:44:20,261 --> 02:44:23,920
It's not raised.
So the reverb and the and the sound that

3670
02:44:23,921 --> 02:44:26,950
we get out of there.
Even the guys from crew when they played

3671
02:44:27,250 --> 02:44:29,690
it was a deal with dodge and me and them
and bob,

3672
02:44:30,070 --> 02:44:33,700
they were supposed to come in and play
like 41 minutes or something and they

3673
02:44:33,701 --> 02:44:35,230
played for like an hour and a half and
we're like,

3674
02:44:35,231 --> 02:44:37,180
we hadn't played anything like this in
decades.

3675
02:44:37,181 --> 02:44:41,380
And the sound is fucking insane.
That is so cool.

3676
02:44:41,381 --> 02:44:43,600
Dude.
You're like an uber businessman.

3677
02:44:43,900 --> 02:44:47,590
He just dip your toes in everything.
I call myself an entrepreneur because I

3678
02:44:47,710 --> 02:44:50,640
always put my hands into shit shit.

3679
02:44:54,420 --> 02:44:56,290
So yeah,
I didn't run across the street.

3680
02:44:57,590 --> 02:45:00,190
You got a restaurant bar.
You're making music.

3681
02:45:01,660 --> 02:45:02,630
Music venues?
Yeah.

3682
02:45:02,650 --> 02:45:04,750
I were doing an energy drink,
gas monkey energy

3683
02:45:06,450 --> 02:45:09,950
in it.
We're in every 7:11 in the us with the

3684
02:45:10,110 --> 02:45:12,730
gas monkey energy.
It's not energy drink.

3685
02:45:12,760 --> 02:45:16,930
It's powered with all kinds of b
vitamins and we where our sugar,

3686
02:45:16,931 --> 02:45:20,230
we use real honey.
Better deal all the way around.

3687
02:45:20,260 --> 02:45:21,840
Wow.
You get it from slave bees?

3688
02:45:22,140 --> 02:45:22,940
Uh,
yeah.

3689
02:45:22,940 --> 02:45:27,340
Well I didn't know if there was any
other crack the whip box b.

3690
02:45:27,390 --> 02:45:29,950
I had a bit about that,
about how you're a vegan.

3691
02:45:29,951 --> 02:45:31,750
One of the most crazy things about being
a vegan.

3692
02:45:31,751 --> 02:45:34,630
It's you can't eat honey.
Did you?

3693
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:40,120
Probably the oldest substance for
nutrition in the world.

3694
02:45:40,270 --> 02:45:42,730
It's one of them.
It's definitely the top million,

3695
02:45:43,210 --> 02:45:48,190
but that these bees are not like your
slaves.

3696
02:45:48,430 --> 02:45:50,770
You can't just force them to make honey.

3697
02:45:51,280 --> 02:45:53,740
Yeah.
You can stick them in the box.

3698
02:45:53,770 --> 02:45:55,420
They don't care.
They don't.

3699
02:45:55,540 --> 02:45:58,260
They don't even know what's going on.
Do you think there's any honeybee

3700
02:45:58,270 --> 02:45:59,830
trafficking going on?
Yes,

3701
02:45:59,920 --> 02:46:01,450
for sure.
And it's awful.

3702
02:46:01,830 --> 02:46:04,030
it needs to stop and it's mostly by
white people.

3703
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:09,830
I was living in la the other day and
this lady had like 24 eggs and they were

3704
02:46:09,831 --> 02:46:11,530
scanning on a.
Well,

3705
02:46:11,540 --> 02:46:14,420
you never know someone's.
They make fake eggs.

3706
02:46:14,720 --> 02:46:17,210
They do and you could put drugs in that
fake egg.

3707
02:46:17,620 --> 02:46:18,830
No bullshit.
Yeah.

3708
02:46:18,890 --> 02:46:20,330
Yeah.
It really is.

3709
02:46:20,540 --> 02:46:21,860
Look,
if you're a drug dealer and you're

3710
02:46:21,861 --> 02:46:24,740
making millions of dollars off cocaine
and ag of coke,

3711
02:46:24,920 --> 02:46:29,370
imagine how fucking how valuable an egg
filled with coke would be there.

3712
02:46:29,371 --> 02:46:30,800
Yeah,
like a rocker coke.

3713
02:46:30,801 --> 02:46:32,630
That big.
Take a guest jamie.

3714
02:46:33,380 --> 02:46:38,380
how about like an ostrich egg filled
with coke austrian tank full of coke?

3715
02:46:39,730 --> 02:46:42,830
Yeah,
a good goose egg.

3716
02:46:42,831 --> 02:46:44,350
I haven't done anything like that and
says,

3717
02:46:44,360 --> 02:46:44,871
oh,
they're really,

3718
02:46:44,871 --> 02:46:48,440
really small job.
Ostrich egg filled with coke.

3719
02:46:48,441 --> 02:46:50,710
Google that.
Don't be scared.

3720
02:46:50,750 --> 02:46:54,190
It probably comes up.
That's the problem with google is like

3721
02:46:54,680 --> 02:46:56,900
you're sitting there thinking with your
buddy or shoot the shit and you're like,

3722
02:46:56,901 --> 02:46:58,190
oh,
I just thought of something really cool

3723
02:46:58,191 --> 02:46:59,024
and googling like,
nah,

3724
02:46:59,060 --> 02:47:01,310
fuck.
It's probably someone getting arrested

3725
02:47:01,311 --> 02:47:05,510
for having an up their ass.
Did you see that cia spy kit where they

3726
02:47:05,511 --> 02:47:08,210
had to stick it up their ass?
Fugitive.

3727
02:47:08,211 --> 02:47:11,920
Ostrich farm fraudster martin.
Every extra dime.

3728
02:47:15,190 --> 02:47:17,660
Is that kind of an ostrich egg up his
ass?

3729
02:47:17,661 --> 02:47:19,180
Is that what you're doing?
And this berg,

3730
02:47:19,200 --> 02:47:21,980
he was doing drug dealing with ostriches
oh,

3731
02:47:23,480 --> 02:47:26,170
how did he get the drugs in the ostrich?
Uh,

3732
02:47:28,420 --> 02:47:30,520
uh,
it would be beak,

3733
02:47:30,550 --> 02:47:31,560
not nostrils.
Well,

3734
02:47:31,590 --> 02:47:33,120
they have nationals.
Can weird man.

3735
02:47:33,350 --> 02:47:34,310
I knew a guy,
you know,

3736
02:47:34,340 --> 02:47:38,570
you haven't done a lot of the world
rallies and I'm the gumball.

3737
02:47:38,571 --> 02:47:42,980
$3,000 of the bull runs and all this.
So one guy appeared on the scene for a

3738
02:47:42,980 --> 02:47:45,950
few years and it was kind of weird.
He was there but he wasn't there and he

3739
02:47:45,951 --> 02:47:50,060
was kinda not really competing,
but he had all these expensive cars.

3740
02:47:50,400 --> 02:47:53,030
It turns out that that's all he'd been
doing for four or five years,

3741
02:47:53,270 --> 02:47:55,850
was shipping these cars from town to
town,

3742
02:47:56,210 --> 02:48:00,260
uh,
on regular shipping trucks full of drugs

3743
02:48:00,330 --> 02:48:03,050
because who's going to search a
lamborghini?

3744
02:48:03,070 --> 02:48:04,700
Mercy lacoe.
Right.

3745
02:48:04,960 --> 02:48:07,190
Would just assume he's there for the
gumball rally.

3746
02:48:07,730 --> 02:48:09,170
Meanwhile,
he's a dope dealer.

3747
02:48:09,260 --> 02:48:11,140
Exactly.
Now that guy,

3748
02:48:11,240 --> 02:48:14,450
I think he's in the jail now.
One of the things about cars,

3749
02:48:14,451 --> 02:48:15,320
right?
It's like cars.

3750
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:16,670
They,
they,

3751
02:48:16,690 --> 02:48:21,110
uh,
men's baser instincts respond to cars.

3752
02:48:21,410 --> 02:48:22,540
You know,
it's something about like,

3753
02:48:22,810 --> 02:48:24,210
like a lamborghini,
like,

3754
02:48:24,211 --> 02:48:26,600
ah,
there's something about those cars.

3755
02:48:26,601 --> 02:48:31,590
It's like you want to kind of slightly
slightly escape from society's

3756
02:48:31,610 --> 02:48:33,290
constraints.
Oh yeah.

3757
02:48:33,291 --> 02:48:35,240
But I'm not a,
I'm not a fan with the,

3758
02:48:35,270 --> 02:48:37,760
those cars.
I do it with the old cars.

3759
02:48:37,820 --> 02:48:39,410
Yeah,
like the old shit.

3760
02:48:39,411 --> 02:48:42,020
I mean I have some new stuff.
Don't get me wrong logos either.

3761
02:48:42,170 --> 02:48:46,380
It's just something about,
well there's some weird so wide and big

3762
02:48:46,381 --> 02:48:49,010
and crazy and it's so can't get in and
out.

3763
02:48:49,280 --> 02:48:51,780
I mean,
it's so rich too.

3764
02:48:53,720 --> 02:48:56,360
Every now and then on sunset,
front of the comedy story seeking these

3765
02:48:56,361 --> 02:49:01,361
guys was
flying by the comedy store and the cars

3766
02:49:02,261 --> 02:49:05,710
are like five fucking miles wide.
Each cars,

3767
02:49:05,740 --> 02:49:07,290
they're super wide.
Yeah.

3768
02:49:07,320 --> 02:49:07,980
And you always know

3769
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:10,350
the asshole that doesn't know what he's
doing because he's pushing in the

3770
02:49:10,351 --> 02:49:12,660
collection.
There's no catch.

3771
02:49:12,661 --> 02:49:13,560
There's no clue.
Well,

3772
02:49:13,590 --> 02:49:15,780
not anymore.
He's putting this neutral and doing it

3773
02:49:15,840 --> 02:49:18,240
literally doesn't exist.
These guys that drive around and they're

3774
02:49:18,241 --> 02:49:19,800
like,
you know,

3775
02:49:19,810 --> 02:49:20,910
look at me now.
I'm like,

3776
02:49:21,020 --> 02:49:22,410
dude,
just travel car.

3777
02:49:22,650 --> 02:49:26,040
You don't ever get the satisfaction and
washed them stall out anymore though.

3778
02:49:26,880 --> 02:49:31,120
Like someone who doesn't know how to do
this is true.

3779
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:36,520
I sold out my bronco and I was everybody
around me that was looking at this car

3780
02:49:36,541 --> 02:49:38,640
that got jealous.
That's for you feel better about

3781
02:49:38,641 --> 02:49:40,910
yourself.
I'll fucking stalled out to lose.

3782
02:49:42,030 --> 02:49:43,050
Ah fuck.

3783
02:49:46,170 --> 02:49:48,630
Everybody had to wait an extra 30
seconds and they're all like,

3784
02:49:48,631 --> 02:49:52,530
you fucking loser.
Nah,

3785
02:49:53,050 --> 02:49:55,350
pretty bad ass bronco.
It's about as bronco,

3786
02:49:55,560 --> 02:49:57,720
but you ever been to los anica boulevard
right?

3787
02:49:57,721 --> 02:50:00,420
When it hits sunset,
that's a steep ass.

3788
02:50:00,421 --> 02:50:01,050
Hell,
bro.

3789
02:50:01,050 --> 02:50:05,010
You got to come around to dudes with
manual stall out on that motherfucker.

3790
02:50:05,460 --> 02:50:07,770
Yeah,
we started the gumball 3000 there one

3791
02:50:07,771 --> 02:50:08,604
time.
Oh really?

3792
02:50:08,610 --> 02:50:11,250
We started on that hill.
You had to clear that light just to go.

3793
02:50:12,260 --> 02:50:14,670
That's a good move to these screwed up
all the top.

3794
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:17,920
That's a good move.
They should've never mowed down the

3795
02:50:18,260 --> 02:50:21,540
blues though while they voted down.
Here's the thing,

3796
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:23,860
I agree with you 100 percent,
but yeah,

3797
02:50:23,861 --> 02:50:24,630
yeah,
yeah.

3798
02:50:24,630 --> 02:50:25,463
I'm not scared.

3799
02:50:27,570 --> 02:50:28,920
Round number.
What is this?

3800
02:50:30,210 --> 02:50:33,450
The thing about the house of blues,
that was bad ass though when it went

3801
02:50:33,451 --> 02:50:34,800
away.
So I live with my friend.

3802
02:50:34,840 --> 02:50:35,880
Yes sir.
A new friend.

3803
02:50:36,430 --> 02:50:41,430
So you're going to teach me comedy.
[inaudible] 100 percent help you out.

3804
02:50:42,120 --> 02:50:43,500
Um,
when it was down,

3805
02:50:43,501 --> 02:50:45,480
when they tore it down from the comedy
store,

3806
02:50:45,481 --> 02:50:47,970
you could see across and you see all the
beautiful lights,

3807
02:50:48,330 --> 02:50:52,590
like the lights in the hollywood hills.
I had a buddy of mine bought a house in

3808
02:50:52,620 --> 02:50:55,830
a off a doe heaney,
which is like way above the hill.

3809
02:50:56,670 --> 02:50:59,280
You'd go to his backyard.
He would look out the lights.

3810
02:50:59,281 --> 02:51:01,560
You'd be like,
this doesn't even seem real.

3811
02:51:01,590 --> 02:51:05,520
It's like blade runner,
like most people see the lights when

3812
02:51:05,521 --> 02:51:09,030
you're down in them.
But when you're above hollywood career,

3813
02:51:09,031 --> 02:51:11,850
looking down,
it's one of the most spectacular views

3814
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:13,290
in all of history.

3815
02:51:13,410 --> 02:51:18,030
It's way better than any New York city
view because you have a view on top.

3816
02:51:18,060 --> 02:51:19,320
Look at that.
That's what you see.

3817
02:51:19,680 --> 02:51:20,640
And I'm telling you,
man,

3818
02:51:20,641 --> 02:51:23,400
this is dog shit compared to my friend
larry's house.

3819
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:25,470
You'd look out there,
you look at that and you go,

3820
02:51:25,471 --> 02:51:27,390
holy shit.
That's incredible.

3821
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:31,080
It was mesmerizing.
The image was stunning.

3822
02:51:31,640 --> 02:51:33,750
That's pretty good.
A couple people that have houses up

3823
02:51:33,751 --> 02:51:36,240
there.
I know dane cook's got a crazy house up

3824
02:51:36,241 --> 02:51:37,980
there.
Like a lot of guys have houses up there

3825
02:51:38,190 --> 02:51:40,530
that looked down like I've always wanted
to meet him.

3826
02:51:40,531 --> 02:51:42,210
He's a rad dude.
Yeah,

3827
02:51:42,211 --> 02:51:44,790
he's at the comedy store all the time.
Well he's.

3828
02:51:44,850 --> 02:51:47,520
What was that show?
He did my best friend's girl or

3829
02:51:47,521 --> 02:51:49,140
whatever.
I think it was a movie.

3830
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:52,050
Yeah.
Movie that is probably one of the

3831
02:51:52,051 --> 02:51:54,090
veterans that was out there.
It's pretty fucking hilarious.

3832
02:51:54,300 --> 02:51:57,070
What's your all time favorite movie if
you had a.

3833
02:51:57,130 --> 02:51:59,220
If there was one,
one move.

3834
02:51:59,490 --> 02:52:01,450
Smokey the bandit.
God damn.

3835
02:52:02,220 --> 02:52:05,040
Every time.
And,

3836
02:52:05,110 --> 02:52:06,190
and if I had to get an in depth

3837
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:08,690
and think about it,
I might go with stroker ace where the

3838
02:52:09,370 --> 02:52:10,580
giant uh thing,
uh,

3839
02:52:10,600 --> 02:52:13,270
the smoke tower failed.
He goes right under it because these

3840
02:52:13,271 --> 02:52:15,130
guys were doing their own stunts.
That shit was real.

3841
02:52:15,131 --> 02:52:20,131
That when cgi and they were doing it.
What was that one movie with the girl?

3842
02:52:20,290 --> 02:52:23,320
Her name was domino.
Uh,

3843
02:52:23,350 --> 02:52:27,320
he was a detective called domino.
Was it called domino?

3844
02:52:27,820 --> 02:52:28,990
I don't remember who.
Was that?

3845
02:52:28,991 --> 02:52:31,060
What it's called?
Are we talking about with burt reynolds?

3846
02:52:31,220 --> 02:52:31,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

3847
02:52:31,700 --> 02:52:33,550
You know like the,
what's it called?

3848
02:52:33,551 --> 02:52:37,000
Domino during cannibal run.
When they drove the car into the pool.

3849
02:52:37,340 --> 02:52:39,190
Oh yeah,
like the nascar looking thing.

3850
02:52:39,370 --> 02:52:40,990
Yeah.
They did that because they were fucking

3851
02:52:40,991 --> 02:52:43,420
drunk.
They were loaded and they were partying

3852
02:52:43,510 --> 02:52:45,560
and the camera's just having to be
rolling that.

3853
02:52:45,570 --> 02:52:47,680
And that wasn't planned.
It wasn't part of the script.

3854
02:52:47,890 --> 02:52:49,750
They did it because they thought it was
funny.

3855
02:52:50,160 --> 02:52:51,550
What is it called?
Sharkey's machine.

3856
02:52:51,580 --> 02:52:53,680
That's right.
Sharkey's machine.

3857
02:52:54,070 --> 02:52:56,200
God damn what years?
That 81.

3858
02:52:56,201 --> 02:52:59,020
I was 14 years old.
I remember watching this movie on tv.

3859
02:52:59,021 --> 02:52:59,890
I was like,
god damn,

3860
02:52:59,891 --> 02:53:04,891
I wish I was burt reynolds
and the woman who was his girlfriend.

3861
02:53:05,890 --> 02:53:07,540
Oh my god.
She was so hot.

3862
02:53:07,600 --> 02:53:10,980
Look at her
leg warmer days.

3863
02:53:11,890 --> 02:53:12,790
That's when they.
Yeah,

3864
02:53:12,791 --> 02:53:15,370
they had a leg warmers back then.
No one had a.

3865
02:53:15,371 --> 02:53:19,490
Nasa didn't even figure out
when they figured out assets,

3866
02:53:19,530 --> 02:53:20,410
sir.
Mix a lot,

3867
02:53:20,500 --> 02:53:23,020
ladies and gentlemen,
why people were in the days.

3868
02:53:23,110 --> 02:53:25,780
We didn't even know what to ask was sir.
Mix a lot.

3869
02:53:25,781 --> 02:53:28,750
Came along and changed the game.
He came along with baby,

3870
02:53:28,751 --> 02:53:30,460
got back and we were like,
wait,

3871
02:53:30,461 --> 02:53:31,120
wait,
wait.

3872
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:32,170
Oh my god,
that is better.

3873
02:53:32,350 --> 02:53:35,860
It was like everybody just got smelling
salts under their nose and then the

3874
02:53:35,861 --> 02:53:37,790
kardashians fucked it up for all this.

3875
02:53:38,080 --> 02:53:40,030
Everybody woke up,
I think did,

3876
02:53:40,031 --> 02:53:43,060
but they didn't.
They exploited a hole in the system.

3877
02:53:43,510 --> 02:53:47,110
You know like Jennifer Lopez had strong
ass game way before them,

3878
02:53:47,380 --> 02:53:52,180
but it was a legit latina asking.
Correct from years of dancing and

3879
02:53:52,181 --> 02:53:55,410
fucking running upstairs and shit.
Right?

3880
02:53:55,590 --> 02:53:57,100
Correct.
Whatever the fuck she did.

3881
02:53:57,160 --> 02:54:00,070
Well also she's like four foot two
machine.

3882
02:54:00,280 --> 02:54:02,800
It's just pretty short.
She's probably five foot one or

3883
02:54:02,801 --> 02:54:06,610
something and she was pretty short pack
it all in small area.

3884
02:54:06,700 --> 02:54:10,450
He got to get it in.
But those movies,

3885
02:54:10,451 --> 02:54:12,370
man,
like burt reynolds movies for whatever,

3886
02:54:12,400 --> 02:54:14,800
deliverance doesn't get the respect it
deserves.

3887
02:54:15,040 --> 02:54:20,020
That is one of the all time greatest
drama movies of all time.

3888
02:54:20,050 --> 02:54:22,830
I actually have a picture when I was
filming with burton's house,

3889
02:54:23,070 --> 02:54:24,760
a similar in my phone.
I'll never find it.

3890
02:54:24,850 --> 02:54:25,780
Uh,
but um,

3891
02:54:26,470 --> 02:54:31,470
I was in his memorabilia room which also
doubled as a weight room and just there

3892
02:54:31,530 --> 02:54:33,580
was stuff everywhere and I was texting
away,

3893
02:54:33,610 --> 02:54:37,360
I was dealing with a problem and
somebody snapped a picture of it and the

3894
02:54:37,361 --> 02:54:42,250
deliverance,
a canoe is laying up against the wall

3895
02:54:42,251 --> 02:54:44,950
and there's all these different
memorabilia things in there.

3896
02:54:44,951 --> 02:54:48,160
And when I say memorabilia like that,
it was like a hoarding room.

3897
02:54:48,260 --> 02:54:51,370
There was just.
Everything was in there and it was

3898
02:54:51,371 --> 02:54:53,170
unbelievable.
It's like the most surreal thing because

3899
02:54:53,171 --> 02:54:57,790
I'm hammering away and there's like
everything behind you do that.

3900
02:54:57,791 --> 02:54:59,810
Did you.
Here's the other thing about that movie.

3901
02:54:59,811 --> 02:55:00,970
And by the way,
burt reynolds,

3902
02:55:00,980 --> 02:55:03,800
university of Florida played football
was a fucking

3903
02:55:04,850 --> 02:55:06,120
dud.
Yeah.

3904
02:55:06,470 --> 02:55:09,170
That movie introduced me to the world of
compound bows.

3905
02:55:09,380 --> 02:55:12,170
I didn't even know what a compound bow
was until I saw that movie.

3906
02:55:12,260 --> 02:55:16,430
I don't know what a combo is now for
bowhunting pro pro man

3907
02:55:18,180 --> 02:55:21,380
bell.
Ronald burt reynolds reynolds.

3908
02:55:21,381 --> 02:55:22,550
I was taking a bow.
Hey,

3909
02:55:22,551 --> 02:55:24,440
uh,
jackson needs you to Barbara Reynolds.

3910
02:55:24,441 --> 02:55:28,130
Dr. Jackson.
I was going to say it's also a big

3911
02:55:28,240 --> 02:55:30,000
bowhunter,
but something about that movie.

3912
02:55:30,001 --> 02:55:32,510
Like when,
who was the guy who was getting fucked

3913
02:55:32,570 --> 02:55:34,790
when they squealed like a pig?
What was his name?

3914
02:55:35,060 --> 02:55:37,960
The actor?
Yes.

3915
02:55:38,030 --> 02:55:38,511
Yes,
yes,

3916
02:55:38,511 --> 02:55:39,410
yes.
Ned beatty.

3917
02:55:39,411 --> 02:55:40,580
Thank you.
Ned beatty.

3918
02:55:40,610 --> 02:55:43,400
Got damn good actor.
Holy shit.

3919
02:55:43,401 --> 02:55:45,650
You were so scared for him.
Well,

3920
02:55:45,690 --> 02:55:46,580
uh,
what's his face?

3921
02:55:46,581 --> 02:55:48,270
Did it later on in the movie?
Was it.

3922
02:55:50,330 --> 02:55:52,550
Who was the other actor that didn't
another.

3923
02:55:52,551 --> 02:55:56,550
Maybe later on.
Was it fiction or Bruce Willis?

3924
02:55:57,030 --> 02:55:59,170
Nah,
he got caught and he's down there.

3925
02:55:59,171 --> 02:56:00,950
He's like,
we're never going to talk about this

3926
02:56:00,951 --> 02:56:01,784
again.
right?

3927
02:56:02,330 --> 02:56:04,160
What was that?
Pulp fiction.

3928
02:56:04,300 --> 02:56:06,410
But because the gap came out.
yeah,

3929
02:56:06,411 --> 02:56:06,861
yeah,
yeah.

3930
02:56:06,861 --> 02:56:08,120
That was what it was.
Yeah,

3931
02:56:08,121 --> 02:56:09,380
that's right.
That's right.

3932
02:56:09,920 --> 02:56:13,640
We're never going to talk about this.
This didn't happen.

3933
02:56:14,060 --> 02:56:17,000
Do you think quinn tanti would come on?
Yeah,

3934
02:56:17,001 --> 02:56:17,421
for sure.
What?

3935
02:56:17,421 --> 02:56:19,730
He's got that new movie coming out.
Definitely wins this new movie coming

3936
02:56:19,731 --> 02:56:21,950
out.
I think they're either just wrapping,

3937
02:56:21,951 --> 02:56:24,050
filming it right now or it's like
they're getting close to.

3938
02:56:24,051 --> 02:56:25,790
Maybe they just finished.
On a scale of one to 10,

3939
02:56:25,791 --> 02:56:28,610
how high do you think he's willing to
get blast off?

3940
02:56:29,960 --> 02:56:31,020
Why not?
Let's see.

3941
02:56:31,021 --> 02:56:32,150
Does doesn't?
I know that he doesn't,

3942
02:56:32,151 --> 02:56:35,390
but he does.
What else is he going to do?

3943
02:56:36,330 --> 02:56:40,340
You go through life pretending.
Just come in and talk about movies.

3944
02:56:40,341 --> 02:56:41,330
He loves movies.
Good.

3945
02:56:41,420 --> 02:56:43,340
Me too.
I love his movies.

3946
02:56:46,850 --> 02:56:48,830
It's 3:10.
Should we wrap this bitch up?

3947
02:56:48,950 --> 02:56:50,150
I don't know man.
What do you got?

3948
02:56:50,180 --> 02:56:53,520
I'm trying to see if any of my social
crap is.

3949
02:56:53,830 --> 02:56:55,980
Don't look at that stuff.
Listen,

3950
02:56:56,390 --> 02:56:59,690
might something good to talk about.
You introduced to a new dimension of

3951
02:56:59,691 --> 02:57:03,590
social media within the last three hours
and I suggest you leave your phone alone

3952
02:57:03,980 --> 02:57:06,230
much more often.
I wAs just checking to see if they gave

3953
02:57:06,231 --> 02:57:07,310
us anything good.
