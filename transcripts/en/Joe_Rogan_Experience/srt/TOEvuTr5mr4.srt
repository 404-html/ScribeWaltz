1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,680
Good experience.
I guess this is a good time to bring it

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:05,650
up as any.
Um,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,370
you know,
obviously Anthony Bordain took his life

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,380
last week and um,
he was a friend of mine and it was real.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,210
That was real hard.
Friday was real hard.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,290
I woke up and um,
I got a text from my friend Maynard from

7
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,380
tool.
Um,

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,480
maynard said so much for the Keenan
verses Bordain Celebrity Jujitsu match.

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,150
And he was like,
fuck.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,530
And I was like,
oh no,

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,130
what does that mean?
And so then I googled it and I saw it.

12
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:37,380
I was like,
Oh shit man,

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,580
I can't fuck what.
Yeah,

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,570
just hung himself.
Like,

15
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:45,120
what?
Yeah,

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,190
I don't know.
Were you,

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,910
did you know his demons?
Was friends with them,

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,290
hung out with him,
got fucked up with them.

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,840
Did you get a feeling that he had that
in him?

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,250
I didn't know that,
but it was really weird.

21
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,830
It was like he'd been saying really
recently that he'd never been happier.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,630
He was talking about his girlfriend and
saying that it never been happier.

23
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:09,690
Didn't know it could be that happy.
Didn't know someone could make them that

24
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:10,920
happen.
Oh Man,

25
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,080
I'm so terrible.
Well,

26
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:14,190
who knows?
They might have.

27
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,890
They might have broken up.
Who knows?

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,180
I mean,
who knows?

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:18,961
I don't know.
I don't know.

30
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:20,010
I don't.
I don't know.

31
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,270
I mean sometimes people when they say,
I've never been that happy,

32
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:26,400
you're catching them on these ups and
downs,

33
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:27,080
you know,
some,

34
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,890
some people,
you know,

35
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:29,990
people get manic,
right?

36
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,830
I don't know if he was,
but some people get,

37
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,990
they get up and down.
I'll tell you what,

38
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:36,420
he,
he liked to get fucked up.

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,360
Yeah.
Like he liked to drink.

40
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,290
Yeah.
You know,

41
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,230
and he enjoyed it.
It was,

42
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,030
it was something that he enjoyed.
But we,

43
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:47,070
um,
we did an episode of this show.

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,540
We went hunting for pheasants in
Montana.

45
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,130
We cooked over this campfire.
He cooked fantastic.

46
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,190
And really,
and then afterwards we drank whiskey and

47
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,520
smoke weed and he goes deep.
He goes deep.

48
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,830
Really?
Where I'm sitting down,

49
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:10,200
I'm like,
I'm going to just try to catch myself

50
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:13,200
real at the world spinning,
deep breath,

51
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,420
deep breath.
He's like,

52
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,500
where's the fucking weed?

53
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,640
They just kept going.
Just kept going.

54
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,300
But I knew he drank,
I didn't know he smoked weed.

55
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,620
Yeah.
He,

56
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:27,110
um,
he had a heroin problem.

57
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:30,510
Yeah.
When he was younger and he kicked it.

58
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,600
But he didn't feel the need to just be
sober.

59
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,480
Yeah.
That was kind of interesting about them.

60
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,450
That's a,
that's a thing you bright would get

61
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,690
sober from a drug.
They feel like they have to get sober

62
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:43,640
from everything.
Yeah.

63
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,810
That did not feel like that.
And he,

64
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:49,320
by the way,
like he would drink,

65
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,010
but when he was home,
like with his kid and he's homeless,

66
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,380
he didn't drink at all.
Like he would only know that he would

67
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:57,060
only do that when he would do beyond the
road.

68
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,770
Right.
So He'd want me to show stretches of

69
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:03,640
time and he didn't drink at all and he
was addicted to Jujitsu.

70
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,620
It was like,
Oh really?

71
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,730
Yeah,
he was doing Jujitsu,

72
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:09,910
like literally every day when I was
hanging around with him,

73
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,460
he was,
he went,

74
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,120
we were in Montana.
He went to Bozeman to find a local

75
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:18,940
Jujitsu club and trained with them in
the morning.

76
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,220
She just trained with everybody.
I never,

77
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,640
I hardly ever did that on the road,
find a place I would just go to the gym

78
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:29,641
and workout wouldn't,
but he was so into learning and getting

79
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:33,260
better at Jujitsu.
I feel like there's a fundamental

80
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,650
problem with the way people approach
ideas and uh,

81
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,460
I think it goes back to what we were
talking about earlier about right versus

82
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:44,461
left or Republican versus Democrat.
They're not thinking of the consequences

83
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:48,180
of arguing for or against the
possibility that climate change is a

84
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,540
human caused thing.
They're not thinking of the

85
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,890
consequences.
They just want to win.

86
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,880
Right,
right.

87
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:53,740
And what their side to be ready to be.

88
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,491
Right.
And you know,

89
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:58,030
what bums me out is they don't
understand the consequences of that for

90
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:01,390
the both the American enterprise and the
human enterprise.

91
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,320
Right.
I mean because you know,

92
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,940
if you,
if you keep calling one branch of

93
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:08,170
science,
a hoax,

94
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,930
then what's to say the other branches
like,

95
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,180
well,
you know,

96
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,810
then you just,
you're,

97
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,530
you're rolling down this slippery slope
where like the other countries,

98
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:14,850
you know,
like.

99
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,880
So most of the,
of the Nobel Prizes Americans have one

100
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,640
where people from other countries,
they came here to do their science

101
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:23,980
because we had the best scientific
enterprise.

102
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,500
The next generation just go somewhere
else,

103
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:27,680
they'll go to China,
you know,

104
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,690
so,
um,

105
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,610
there's that part of it and the other
parties like,

106
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:31,900
dude,
it's just science.

107
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:35,500
It doesn't care about your political
views and you know,

108
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:39,700
it's not fair to use the cell phone and
take the antibiotics and then turn

109
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:41,830
around and like,
and then suddenly treat this thing as if

110
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:44,380
it was another thing in your bucket of
ideologies.

111
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,730
I think also people think that if you
somehow or another compromise industry's

112
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,620
ability to,
to work,

113
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,220
that you're going to kill jobs and
you're gonna damage the economy and

114
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:55,930
that's more important.
Yeah.

115
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,370
But I think it's the exact opposite.
Right?

116
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:58,570
And if people really saw,
right,

117
00:04:58,571 --> 00:04:59,430
I mean,
um,

118
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,700
you know,
again,

119
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,890
just like I'm saying,
climate change shows how powerful people

120
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,550
become and also shows how powerful are
our enterprise.

121
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:09,730
Right?
We did this by building businesses,

122
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:14,140
by building enterprise bi,
and we built this world curdling machine

123
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:16,020
of civilization.
And it,

124
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,830
you know,
it,

125
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,380
the planet actually noticed,
why do you like that term world girdling

126
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,820
because that's,
it gives me the girdle wrapping around.

127
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,530
I think it's because it's from like a
Shakespeare,

128
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:30,940
like from a Caesar or something.
There's a lot of guys you could take out

129
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:31,774
there that are,
um,

130
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,960
track and field guys or football players
and you could get them to fight better

131
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:40,570
than him and a couple of weeks right?
Easily because they're athletes,

132
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,540
they're athletes.
They would understand how to shift their

133
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,650
weight,
throw a punch.

134
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:45,484
And

135
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,290
yeah,
the,

136
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,370
the sparring videos that I saw was,
I think it was from his first fight,

137
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:51,540
but even then,
like he wasn't,

138
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,920
he signed for like two years before he
had his first fight or something that

139
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,800
there's no way that you're six years
deep in the game.

140
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:58,110
And yet

141
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,200
he was still at that bad,
you know what I mean?

142
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,000
He doesn't have any talent.
It's all,

143
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,510
it is.
He just doesn't have physical talent or

144
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:06,600
whatever for whatever reason.
Whether it's a,

145
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,000
he,
his approach,

146
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,250
his intensity,
whether it's,

147
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,340
it's not as coaching.
So at Duke fucking Rufus,

148
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,960
you know,
I mean,

149
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,510
how's the,
with cushman that he talks about Duke

150
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,430
Roufus and one of the put pre fights,
he said,

151
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:21,450
uh,
how do you see this fight?

152
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:21,771
It's like,
oh,

153
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:24,190
I really like a head kick.
Duke would love to see a head kick and

154
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:25,850
like,
I don't think that's going to happen.

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,300
Oh,
that's so crazy that.

156
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,280
So that's such a crazy thing to say,
you know,

157
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,490
Duke's a beautiful person.
He's a great guy in every,

158
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,180
every sense of the word.
He just says he's a great guy.

159
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,920
He did his best.
You know,

160
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,970
there's only so much you could do.

161
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,560
I know.
I mean,

162
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sure you would love working with
Duke.

163
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:46,850
I'm sure he would love working with you
if you and duke work together.

164
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,570
I'm sure you guys would have a great old
time because you're Joe fucking

165
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,640
chillings right?
And he's Duke fucking relevance,

166
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,930
you know,
let them know.

167
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,151
But,
you know what I mean?

168
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:57,860
I mean,
you have to have something to work with.

169
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,670
You know,
I mean if duke just grabbed some dude

170
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,140
from a gas station that has been,
uh,

171
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,360
drinking beer and smoking cigarettes his
whole life and had him in a fight in six

172
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,580
months,
how much can you possibly expect?

173
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,360
But I would rather see that fight
against these other ones.

174
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:16,080
Right?
Let's find out how that would go.

175
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:16,941
Well,
a guy,

176
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,270
you can find it.
A gas station,

177
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,970
beer and cigarettes.
What's interesting is they both,

178
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,980
both guys fought micky gall first.

179
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,230
It was weird.
Did you see his instagram?

180
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,130
Mickey's?
Yeah,

181
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,150
he did like his own pre-fight,
uh,

182
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,810
with the analysis of how it was going to
go.

183
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:31,040
It was really good.
Yeah.

184
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,400
Well,
for the little bit that these articles

185
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:36,260
get right about him,
it's that he's helping men.

186
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:38,900
He is also helping women,
but yes,

187
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,040
he is helping men.
Men need their shit together.

188
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,820
Need Framework for sure.
I mean,

189
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:46,840
people need this,
this thing about discipline and you

190
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,690
know,
you are,

191
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,820
you.
Are you aware of,

192
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:50,960
you know,
you're aware of Jocko willink.

193
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,060
Discipline equals freedom.
It's like one of the best catchphrases.

194
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,540
It's so accurate.
Empowering.

195
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,930
It's so empowering.
Get your shit together and then you the

196
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:03,890
time that you have for recreation,
you'll appreciate it so much more.

197
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,160
You don't appreciate rest when you're
fucking off all day.

198
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,500
You're appreciate.
Rest when you've worked hard,

199
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,240
that's when it means something to you.

200
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,960
When you've accomplished goals,
that's when this celebration is

201
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,690
something that you get a good feeling
from it.

202
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,290
Do you have a part in your life that you
feel like is lacking in that department?

203
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,290
In what department and just like getting
your shit together,

204
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,220
like not slacking on that.
Yeah,

205
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,760
that's what I do.
I mean,

206
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:31,340
I do a lot of shit.
They're the only way I could ever do as

207
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:34,100
many different things as I do is if I
just get after it.

208
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,830
Yeah.
I get after it pretty fucking good.

209
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,750
Yeah,
and I'm not.

210
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,290
I'm not insecure in that.
I mean whether it's through martial arts

211
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:47,291
or any kind of exercise or work,
I just take pride in getting things

212
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:50,360
done.
I take pride in working,

213
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,510
you know,
especially working towards things that

214
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:55,620
are important to me.
Whether it's working on set,

215
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,920
working on my standup,
whether it's working on a podcast,

216
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:03,921
whether it's working on my martial arts
or fitness or yoga or whatever I get

217
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:05,040
after it.

218
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,750
Man,
did you got to?

219
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,090
Yeah,
and for me it's not a matter of whether

220
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,280
or not it's an option.
It's like brushing my teeth.

221
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,350
I don't decide one day,
oh,

222
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:16,740
I don't want to brush my teeth today.
I just fucking brushed my teeth.

223
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,290
And when there's days where I'm doing
fasted cardio,

224
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,750
when that alarm goes off,
it's not a matter of whether or not a

225
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:26,060
shut the alarm off.
That's not an option.

226
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,940
You Get up,
you put your fucking shoes on,

227
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,510
you get the dog and you go running
because that's what you do and if you

228
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:37,430
just decide that's what you do,
then you get things done and then a

229
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,760
month later you're like,
oh shit,

230
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,500
we did this all month,
and then six months later it's like,

231
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,480
oh,
I did this half a year.

232
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,880
And then if you're doing Jujitsu,
you like,

233
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:47,661
Oh shit,
look,

234
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:48,500
I got a blue belt.

235
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,450
Oh Shit.
Now I'm a purple belt.

236
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,200
And that's how you become a black belt.
Yeah.

237
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,270
You just,
you know,

238
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,410
and I got the good type of progressive
because it gets progressively easier to.

239
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,270
I told you I'm doing that.
It doesn't though,

240
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,200
doesn't get ease,
you know,

241
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,000
think so because can hard every time
that alarm goes off like fuck you for

242
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:09,380
you now then right when you started,
I don't know because you know the reward

243
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:10,340
of it,
you know that,

244
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:13,490
that reward some enforcement.
There's no enforcement in the success

245
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:18,290
that I've had in completing these tasks.
But every fucking time I go to yoga

246
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,760
class and my God,
Jesus,

247
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,300
Ninety minutes in a 100,
four degree temperature with these all

248
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:24,830
these women that are going to humiliate
me,

249
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,740
they can definitely do things that you
can do.

250
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,170
Well,
this is tough man.

251
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,720
There's a lot of these older ladies that
are fucking tough.

252
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,501
Yeah.
You know,

253
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:35,780
they just gutted out.
I was just one lady that goes there.

254
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:38,660
She's like 60 years old.
She doesn't even bring water and this

255
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:41,480
lady's in there for 90 fucking minutes.
Sweated out.

256
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:42,650
She's there.
Every time I go,

257
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:43,310
I'm like,
Gee,

258
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,960
she's not bringing water.
You sure she's 60.

259
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:47,920
She can be like 20 and hydrated.
Oh,

260
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,920
she's gray haired and tough as shit.
She drinks water before she drinks it

261
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:53,600
after,
but when she's in that class,

262
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:55,220
she's just tough.
It's just,

263
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,130
you know,
it's never easy to do.

264
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,080
You know,
it gets a little bit easier when you get

265
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:02,120
better at it,
but then you just try harder and it

266
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:04,490
makes it more difficult.
If you're always giving 100 percent

267
00:11:04,491 --> 00:11:05,780
effort,
it's always going to be hard.

268
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,660
You know,
you take some pride in the fact that now

269
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:11,930
I can go two miles through the hills and
you know,

270
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:15,020
and reach the point of exhaustion where
before it was one or whatever,

271
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,290
whatever your little little progress
markers are,

272
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,790
you get some satisfaction that.

273
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,410
But it's always difficult to get going.
The hardest step is the first step is

274
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:26,750
not the 30th staff or the hundredth
step.

275
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:29,510
It's the fucking first one.
It's getting on the trail.

276
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,280
Getting going.
It's the hardest thing.

277
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,150
The hardest weight to lift is the first
one because once you get going like,

278
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:36,710
okay,
I'm a half hour into my workout,

279
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:38,540
I'm writing things down that I'm
supposed to be doing.

280
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,374
Now I got,
you know,

281
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,760
Twenty Chin ups and burpees and then all
you have to do it,

282
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,000
you just have to do it and so many
people have a hard time doing it.
