1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,513
Okay.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,980
Oh fuck yeah,
here we go.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,550
Tony Hinchcliffe lives in the house.
Brian Redman is in the house.

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,210
Dun Dun Dun done Dun.
And we've been talking about turning

5
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:21,180
your come off with a light switch as I
work.

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,820
It's like a little switch that's in your
inner leg or something like that.

7
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:29,050
And if you want to make a baby it turns
on your income or your sperm.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,900
So it's like a sperm switch,
but they made it look like a light

9
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:34,960
switch instead of having it like some
weird button.

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,760
Put it up on the screen again please.
It's so it's in between your legs.

11
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:42,580
Like what if you're jogging this.
Just go on and off and on and off.

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,930
Yeah.
Oh my God.

13
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:45,280
It is a light switch.
Come on.

14
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:47,850
This isn't real.
Dare you.

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,620
Why am I seeing that guy's Dick?
Huge.

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,860
Why is he big?
He semi.

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,700
Okay.
Look at this.

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,340
All right.
So what they're showing us is,

19
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:58,600
uh,
can we hear this?

20
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,770
Is it okay?
We're here is combined with seminars

21
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,100
like India.
Hold on,

22
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:05,350
I love this guy's accent.
Please start from the beginning because

23
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:07,960
it makes it even better.
He speaks in the slightly broken English

24
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,350
every day.
Andy Richter,

25
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,100
during his brother,
in order to begin the medical approval

26
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:17,360
procedure,
the human males testicles produce

27
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:19,610
millions of sperm cells.
Everyday.

28
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,420
These cells flow through the spermatic
ducts and then combined with seminar

29
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,263
related.

30
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,100
It would be so disappointed if he saw
what his technology was being used for.

31
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,150
Thomas Edison invented Dick Switches,
switches,

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,620
power on and off.
It's why is it more humorous?

33
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:43,780
Because this gentleman has an accent
mate.

34
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,320
Why would they spend so much time making
the texture of the balls and the Deq

35
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:50,020
that realistic?
Because they want you to know they're

36
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:53,680
not playing games.
So this is insane.

37
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,820
You can feel the switch and you can flip
it back and forth.

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,110
That is so fucking crazy.
And what are the odds that a girl who

39
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:06,030
wants a baby is not going to reach back
and click that switch right while you

40
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:08,460
were,
while she's rubbing your balls and when

41
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,670
did.
There would be the perfect time to hit

42
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,110
the switch.
If you really wanted to make a baby,

43
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,880
like let them release the hounds and
whenever there'd be comes still on the

44
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:16,601
tube,
you know,

45
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:18,970
like they ended the tube like hmm,
good question.

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,160
Yeah,
I think that is a,

47
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,023
that's an issue,
right?

48
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,230
Doesn't it like stay inside your decal?
It doesn't all come out one blast and

49
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,030
sometimes it can come out in the next
blast.

50
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,650
Yeah,
that's what do I know?

51
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,690
If it's fake,
that's craziness.

52
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,370
I mean,
I don't understand if you got an

53
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:35,110
operation to get all that stuff,
put it in,

54
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:37,030
just get a vasectomy.
Make a decision.

55
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,220
Stand by it.
Yeah.

56
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,260
It seems like in America,
um,

57
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,410
this,
this,

58
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,130
these type of things are becoming more
and more attractive to us.

59
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,820
Like an instant solution to like
anything that we got going wrong.

60
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,290
Oh,
we're going to come up with a new

61
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,490
retinas.
These retinas,

62
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:53,580
they're artificial retinas.
You put them in your eyes and you could

63
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,570
see 2100 or 20,
uh,

64
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,520
what,
what is,

65
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
what's,
that's not good.

66
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,560
Like 2100 and be terrible.
Yeah.

67
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,500
Like 20,
45,

68
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,020
20 slash 20 is normal,
right?

69
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,091
Right.
40,

70
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:05,230
20.
No,

71
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:06,140
that's worse too,
right?

72
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,720
Isn't that better?
That's twice.

73
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,310
I don't think it is.
I'm not sure.

74
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,580
I don't think.
I think it's always been like low

75
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:15,610
numbers are really good.
Like pilots would say I have 20 slash 15

76
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:18,730
vision.
See an eagle attack assignment from a

77
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,180
mile away.
You know like people were always like

78
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,500
super proud of their vision,
like really good vision.

79
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:25,150
Like whoa.
Amazing.

80
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,460
You see clearly so lower would be
better.

81
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,840
Like four slash 20 would be the best for
20.

82
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,020
No it's too high on one side.
I don't know what's perfect on one side.

83
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:36,430
Write 20th,
20 slash 20 slash 20.

84
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,890
Right.
What the fuck does that even stand for?

85
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,290
Maybe we should know that.
What you see at 20 feet,

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,670
the first 20 is what normal person sees
at 20 feet and then what you see at 20

87
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:47,980
feet.
So you see if you have 2100,

88
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:51,400
you see what a normal person sees at 200
feet or 20 feet because your vision

89
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:52,360
sucks.
Oh,

90
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,470
okay.
That makes sense.

91
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,500
That actually totally makes sense.
I want to drag.

92
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,793
Yeah.

93
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,503
Yeah.
Do you have good,

94
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,550
perfect vision.
And Tony,

95
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,790
my vision is unbelievable.
I can,

96
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,840
I can read anything from like,
it's like insane.

97
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,360
That's cool.
A lot of fun.

98
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,400
Have you always had that?
He should probably be really good at

99
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,780
something like darts or something like
that.

100
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,010
Maybe.
Yeah,

101
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,720
I would think that something along those
lines where you.

102
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,690
It'd be like super precise.
Like when you're throwing up,

103
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,460
you're like,
I don't play darts,

104
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,320
but I would imagine that it's probably
pretty fun with all that pressure to get

105
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:34,000
a bowl side.
It seems kind of silly.

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,560
He's throwing a metal stick at a thing,
but those dudes seem to be having a good

107
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:39,850
time.
I'm a hell of a shot.

108
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,870
Is a natural with a dartboard with,
with an actual gun,

109
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,070
with like.
Oh really?

110
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:46,430
Yeah,
just shot,

111
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,850
like discuss one time.
Is that what it is?

112
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,140
What do they come?
Pigeons.

113
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,220
Pigeons,
clay pigeon.

114
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:56,020
And I was like 13 or 14 and I was
clipping him and I remember this group

115
00:04:56,021 --> 00:05:01,021
of old guys were standing behind my
mom's boyfriend that took me just like,

116
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:04,120
Holy Shit,
I'm terrible with the shotgun.

117
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,860
I did Bert Kreischer show.
We had one of those clay shoot off

118
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:10,060
things.
I hit like one.

119
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,860
How do you get good at a shotgun now you
just practice.

120
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,350
You just have to understand how you're
orientating the um,

121
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,800
the site on it,
it's a little more tricky than like a

122
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:25,801
hunting rifle or the site is magnified
with a shotgun for the most part,

123
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,970
unless it has a scope on it.
Most of the times they don't,

124
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,850
you're,
you're using the barrel of the gun to

125
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:32,890
line up where the bullets are going to
go.

126
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:37,630
But any variation upward down by the
slightest amount results in a big

127
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,540
deviation of the intended path of the
weapon.

128
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,140
So like if you're trying to shoot
straight and your,

129
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:44,220
your thing is just,
it,

130
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,770
lets kind of add them but not really.
It'll go over his head.

131
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,950
So you have to line up this little thing
in the front which is like a little

132
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:55,730
tiny,
like a nub and,

133
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,010
and then the thing in the back,
the thing in the back is

134
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,860
the you and you're looking,
you're trying to align the two of them

135
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,600
up.
So there's like this little v and you're

136
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:05,990
trying to put this pin in between the
Little v and hold it there as you

137
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,400
squeeze the trigger and don't flinch.
So it's,

138
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,330
there's a lot involved in it.
It takes practice.

139
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,210
But once you get,
it's like anything else like archery or

140
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:15,350
bowling,
you know,

141
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,060
once you understand the technique behind
it,

142
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:19,040
then it's just a matter of drilling it
over and over again.

143
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,610
Like you ever seen a really good bowler?
Like Ari's friend Tommy.

144
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,980
What is that guy's name?
Tommy Tolo.

145
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,210
And whoa,
what the fuck is this?

146
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,220
He gave me a damage.
He gave me a uh,

147
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,460
sorry.
I already,

148
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,440
you'll find it right,
right.

149
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,740
Uh,
he gave me a really good dude.

150
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,060
Whoever that guy is.
Ballerina,

151
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,960
right?
No,

152
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,450
no,
no.

153
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,260
Tommy.
Jamie.

154
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,640
We'll figure it out.
Let him figure it out.

155
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:41,474
We'll,
we'll,

156
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,950
we'll talk.
But um,

157
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,460
if he taught you how to bowl,
like if you watch him bowl,

158
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,550
like those guys,
they throw like that curve ball where it

159
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:52,590
comes spinning and it smashes into
everything,

160
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,050
like had an angle and they can do it
consistently over and over and over and

161
00:06:57,051 --> 00:07:01,760
over again until the point where they'll
bowl like pretty close to perfect games

162
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:05,450
a lot where they'll get like real close
to making eight,

163
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:06,950
nine strikes in a row.
And you're like,

164
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,540
what the fuck?
When a guy like you were,

165
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,640
I don't know how you boil.
I bullet shit,

166
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,290
I just shut that fucking thing.
Totally dilutes.

167
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,700
Tommy dilutes great guy by the way.
Super fucking Nice Guy.

168
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,660
He's hung out with us a couple of times
and he's a pro bowler.

169
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,930
So if that guy taught you how to bowl,
like he could teach you the technique,

170
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,590
then it would just be a matter of you
wanting to keep working at it.

171
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,520
Whether it's,
whether it's archery or that's darts or

172
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,354
anything,
man,

173
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,970
it's just a matter of someone showing
you how to do it.

174
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:40,460
You figured it out what's best for you.
And then numbers.

175
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,040
That's what that's why people don't like
to get good at shit.

176
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,080
The numbers involved or nuts.
If you want to be a professional golfer,

177
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,600
do you know what kind of numbers you
have to put in?

178
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,760
Good Lord all the practice and all the
fucking knock and then he like,

179
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:57,110
man,
this isn't gonna work out.

180
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,540
Okay.
If you say it's not gonna work out,

181
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,300
but I guess it's not going to work out
because it fucking worked out for tiger

182
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,610
woods.
Fucking worked out for Jack Nicholas.

183
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:08,060
How come it fucking worked out for them?
Because they got nutty because someone

184
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,750
taught them the technique.
They started to compete and then they

185
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:12,820
got nutty.
Yeah.

186
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,360
You just got to decide whether or not
you want to get nutty and getting that.

187
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,870
He's not the best idea in the world
either.

188
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,810
A lot of those guys want to fucking
hitting the rocks.

189
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,020
They never stopped at the beach.
Just fucking keep that cast going.

190
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,740
It's like stand up in a lot of ways.
Yeah.

191
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,820
I think it's like everything.
Everything that represents you,

192
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,920
you know,
you focus on it and the more you focus

193
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:38,420
on it,
the better it gets at it and if you

194
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,040
don't focus on it,
it doesn't get better.

195
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,240
And if you do,
it does.

196
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:44,210
And it's a matter of how much do you
want to focus on where you can enjoy the

197
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:45,430
rest of your life.
What,

198
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,150
what percentage of your life does it
become?

199
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,660
It always amazes me that people that get
like so great at video games.

200
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,030
No,
you never.

201
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,960
Did you ever meet Robert?
The dude who was the old

202
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,100
manager at the comedy store.
Um,

203
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,920
what was his job there?
Do you remember?

204
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,830
He was like talent.
Was He booking talent?

205
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,050
I don't know if he was doing that for
awhile.

206
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,360
Maybe he was doing that for awhile
anyway.

207
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,310
Really good magic.
I write magic.

208
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:12,660
The gathering.
He was addicted to that.

209
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,820
He was addicted to Everquest,
I believe at first.

210
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,590
Maybe it was magic.
The magic.

211
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:18,030
The gathering is a card game though,
isn't it?

212
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,650
It's also a video game.
It's video again to.

213
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,860
I'm pretty sure he was a everquest
junkie.

214
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,320
Bad Man.
Like bad.

215
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,870
And he would come to the comedy store
and you'd be depressed,

216
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,860
like he would get out of his house when
he could and when he could,

217
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,470
he would come out and hang out with,
with us in the real world.

218
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,940
I'll never forget this.
We were in the back bar and it was just

219
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:40,740
me and him and uh,
you know,

220
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,550
it was,
uh,

221
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,630
you know,
the back bar here,

222
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,150
we're just,
a lot of times comedians gathered there

223
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:50,040
and talk and he just goes,
it's just so weird that I can be so good

224
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:54,450
at making money in my online life and so
bad at it in my real life.

225
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,110
He goes,
I'm so good at being successful in this

226
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,650
artificial life,
but I can't get it together in my real

227
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:04,560
life.
And he was tired and he looked pale.

228
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,090
And I'm like,
this is a great guy.

229
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:08,000
He's like a really nice guy.
I'm like,

230
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,360
fuck man.
Like this game is like a vampire.

231
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,980
He was making money on it.
No,

232
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,620
you make money in the game.
Like you may collect gold coins.

233
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:19,530
He combined magic.
Said I worked by saying that,

234
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:19,951
right?
Yeah,

235
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:20,500
sure.
Yeah.

236
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,700
You level up the more he played,
so he was like king of kings,

237
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,350
you know,
he had like a crazy player and

238
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:26,680
everything like king of King.
Well,

239
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,010
when you get really good right in
everquest,

240
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,350
like the higher you get,
the more you can fuck people up.

241
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:32,770
He could do whatever you want,
right?

242
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,460
You just become like invincible.
Like,

243
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,870
oh my God,
if you're on that shit 24 hours a day

244
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:38,580
for 10 years,
no one fuck with you.

245
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,670
They just can't fuck with you.
Isn't that how world of warcraft death?

246
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,050
They're encouraging addiction.
It's so obvious.

247
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,830
It's so obvious.
They're there.

248
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,970
They're very clever,
but this is a money vampire.

249
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,130
I figured out a really entertaining
money vampire just sucks it out of

250
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,920
south park.
Did one on it and it's just like

251
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,350
unbelievably hilarious.
You know what's interesting?

252
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,360
The concept that you can get better at
it the more time you put in it because

253
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:09,540
you get more stuff.
Like that's a really weird concept

254
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,650
because that's not how it is in any
other game and in any other game.

255
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:15,780
What's cool about playing quake?
Right?

256
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,990
I hate to harp on quick all the time,
but I used to love playing it,

257
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,890
um,
was that you both start out like she,

258
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,370
you guys were going to have a death
match.

259
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,430
He was both start out with 150 life
points,

260
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,460
the same amount of access to weapons,
you know,

261
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:32,940
you have like a little pistol,
like you have a little blaster and then

262
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:35,220
you run around the map to try to find
where the other weapons are.

263
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,800
So you have to know the map,
you have to know where the weapons are

264
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:41,940
and when they spawn because the,
they spawn in increments like every 15,

265
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:43,590
20 seconds or something like,
I forget what it is,

266
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,620
maybe a minute for some weapons,
maybe some weapons spun differently.

267
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:51,621
So these guys had programs in their code
where it would alert them when,

268
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,950
uh,
the rocket launcher was about spawn.

269
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,830
So they had it timed into their,
their code.

270
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,510
So they would receive little messages up
on their screen that would let them know

271
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:03,490
that rocket launchers,
we're about to spawn.

272
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,550
So they'd run to get to the rocket
launch because he who gets a rocket

273
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:10,750
launcher first most likely wins a death
match because these guys know the maps

274
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,380
and they start blasting each other.
Well then they,

275
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,840
everybody starts.
Even everybody starts even it's.

276
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:17,740
So that's what's exciting about it.
It's a mad scramble if you got to a

277
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:22,741
point where you could just fog people up
and turn their cities into dust and

278
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,440
bring down fire and brimstone.
That's too much.

279
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,570
And we get.
Everybody's got to be even more your

280
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,900
games bullshit.
He just got a giant addiction thing.

281
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:33,370
Go.
You got an addiction pyramid scheme

282
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:35,020
going on,
right?

283
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,870
And you're talking to yourself in third
person as if it wasn't you that did all

284
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,723
this.

285
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,970
Well sort of.
But I'm thinking about Robert because

286
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:47,971
I'm thinking about the game of everquest
and this is way more addictive element,

287
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,850
like the element of the long you do it,
the more power you have and the more you

288
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:57,430
can accomplish,
the more dragons you can slay and what

289
00:12:57,431 --> 00:13:00,920
have you.
What I was into was a these crazy

290
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,840
one-on-one death matches.
They were so fun and I,

291
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,440
I was never good at them,
man.

292
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,070
I used to get fucked up.
Like it wasn't a matter of like me being

293
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:11,260
successful at quake.
It was the opposite.

294
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,280
Like I could never catch up.
I could be able to beat dudes who were

295
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:19,510
clueless if some dude was clueless and
he got into one of those maps with me,

296
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:21,910
I could fuck them up,
but most of the time I got fucked up.

297
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,020
Most of the time you're getting fucked
up with these young kids were so good.

298
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:28,140
They're fucking hand.
Eye Coordination is like,

299
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,740
it's designed through the game because
as they were a bit hesitant were

300
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:35,470
children.
They're using a mouse and keyboard as

301
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:39,730
their little brains were forming
connections with their fingertips.

302
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,340
A lot of what it involved moving a
mouse.

303
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,270
Obama,
right.

304
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,091
Does he?
Yeah.

305
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:48,890
He's like on one of those like halo or
something like that.

306
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,900
What's one of those popular one?
Halos.

307
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,880
Popular Halo is bad.
I think it might be,

308
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:55,210
but he plays.
It's A.

309
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,530
I always think that that's like so crazy
to think that Obama is.

310
00:13:58,531 --> 00:14:02,070
Sometimes it's just chill and just
getting a lit up by like some seven year

311
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:04,020
old kid.
You know what I mean?

312
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:09,130
Obama please.
Titanfall tight xbox one.

313
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,030
It's similar to call of duty.
Right?

314
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,730
So is it a war game?
So you're like running around and you

315
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:20,320
can jump in a big machines Mac or in the
game like transformers,

316
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,120
robotech.
Wow,

317
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,670
that's wild.
Who would have ever thought that?

318
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:27,400
So this is like that movie with fucking
a wolverine.

319
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,510
What's his name?
What's the Wolverine Guy's name?

320
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,470
Hugh Jackman.
Mike Australian.

321
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,380
Isn't that amazing?
So hides his accident so.

322
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,320
Well,
it's always weird.

323
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,540
One of those guys talks in a regular
accent.

324
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,510
You're like,
Whoa,

325
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:41,991
whoa,
Whoa,

326
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:43,660
whoa.
Like did you ever watch homeland?

327
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,410
There's a guy named brody who's in
homeland and he plays the dude who was

328
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:50,860
kidnapped and tortured by the
terrorists.

329
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:52,330
Then comes back to America and he's
like,

330
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,720
kind of like a,
you know,

331
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,690
he's like acting as a pawn for the
terrorist is like,

332
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,930
it's very far fucking crazy.
But he sounds like a,

333
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,710
like a regular,
almost like a southern American,

334
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:07,040
like a Texan,
like a slight Texas accent on the show.

335
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,000
And then in real life he talks with like
this crazy English accent and you hear

336
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:13,100
him talk and you can't believe it's the
same man.

337
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,170
One of my favorite actors right now who
I'm like obsessed with because I saw him

338
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:19,540
on this show bloodline.
You heard of this show?

339
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,210
Bloodline.
What's bloodline is a netflix original

340
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:26,620
series that came out like six months ago
and it's basically about like this rich

341
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:30,760
family that takes a vacation.
They like have this vacation in Hawaii

342
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,200
and they all get together and shit just
goes down with this family and they're

343
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,400
all doing like,
you don't know who's covering up what

344
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:41,890
and it's just all these diabolical
characters.

345
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,170
Anyway,
there's this guy named Ben Mendelsohn

346
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,190
who is a monster.
He's one of those guys that's just so

347
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:51,190
compelling to watch.
Like his face is always moving.

348
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:56,191
He plays like a bad guy in everything
and I watched like six or seven of his

349
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:59,950
movies going back and they're all
amazing.

350
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:03,340
It's one of these like real actors and
then I found out that he's just

351
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,810
Australian,
but complete Australian dude,

352
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,490
total Australian accent,
and he was my favorite American actor up

353
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:14,110
until I found out he's from Australia.

354
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,460
There's a lot of killer actors from
Australia.

355
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,530
Russell Crowe's from Australia,
right?

356
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,463
Isn't it?
Yeah.

357
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,910
That guy there.
That's monster.

358
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,073
How many

359
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,980
fucking Australian accents?
Mel Gibson.

360
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,490
Australian.
Thank you.

361
00:16:27,491 --> 00:16:29,310
How many of those guys?
What's Tom Hardy?

362
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:31,020
English.
English.

363
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,180
Tom Hardy's a bad ass.
He's a bad motherfucker.

364
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,880
Just so many of them from over there.
It's incredible.

365
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,030
Sometimes I don't even realize I was
watching a Tom Hardy movie until the end

366
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,710
of the movie and his name comes up and
I'm like,

367
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:43,630
who was Tom Hart?
Oh my God.

368
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:45,310
He was the main character the whole
time.

369
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,260
Like he has some.
He's another one.

370
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,760
One of the only other guides.
It's funny,

371
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:52,060
bring him up because he's another one
where I literally will look up their

372
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:54,850
name in Vr because you can.
Some of these guys,

373
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:59,110
you can actually read the scripts and
pick the things that they want to do.

374
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,500
Well,
he can at this point,

375
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,970
right?
Yeah,

376
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,761
yeah,
yeah.

377
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:05,030
He's a bad motherfucker.
That guy can act his ass off.

378
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,500
It's sometimes he's like a ripped
monster,

379
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:11,070
like in Mad Max and then sometimes he's
built like me in these movies and it's

380
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,130
like,
how the hell like he,

381
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,740
he's one of those guys that cuts weight
and puts it on and really gets into

382
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:18,060
character.
He plays a,

383
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,310
I can't remember the name of it,
but one of these things,

384
00:17:20,311 --> 00:17:22,020
he's,
he's a twin,

385
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,110
so he's playing the two lead characters
because he's,

386
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,290
it's him and his twin the entire time

387
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,101
playing the,
uh,

388
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:30,580
the Kray brothers right there.
Remember that movie?

389
00:17:30,581 --> 00:17:35,581
The craze that was out a long time ago.
It was basically on the same brothers,

390
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,800
two brothers who were into organized
crime in England.

391
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:41,080
They're legendary and he's playing both
of them.

392
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,940
The last time they did,
I think they had two actual twins in the

393
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:48,970
last version of it,
which is probably they had to,

394
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,390
for whatever actors they could get that
we're twins.

395
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,440
Tom Hardy's one of these guys that I
didn't even know about until my

396
00:17:55,441 --> 00:18:00,120
girlfriend who's like a huge movie buff,
kept showing me movies like,

397
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,340
and she's,
she would always talk about like how hot

398
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:04,080
he is and this,
and she's just like,

399
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:07,470
this guy's fucking amazing and I'm like,
you're just making me watch these Tom

400
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,420
Hardy movies because you have a crush on
him.

401
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,690
And sure enough,
this fucker won me over like big time.

402
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,860
That's really no,
he's good.

403
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:14,700
Right?
So where you're like,

404
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,230
oh,
you know what?

405
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,820
It's fucking great man.
Fuck it.

406
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:18,060
Fuck

407
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:23,060
my girlfriend.
How many guys do you think have ever

408
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:26,640
played themselves in a movie like side
by side?

409
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:27,600
Like twins,
like that.

410
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,780
So you're playing like,

411
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,330
what I want to know is does he get paid
double for that?

412
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,170
Is that all done?
That only seems fair,

413
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:36,711
right?
Well,

414
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:39,230
he's got to be getting a shitload of
money for this because that's half of

415
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,810
the movie is seeing if they can pull
that off.

416
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,130
Right?
Because you're dealing with

417
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,570
Agi.
They're combining somehow or another.

418
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:49,380
I don't know how they're doing it.
I would imagine what they can do now,

419
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:54,430
this is just my guess is that you can
get a guy like you and you and Brian

420
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:59,140
could have like a tussle and as long as
you wear the same size,

421
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,980
you could superimpose his features on
you.

422
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,110
There's a way they could do that with
CGI.

423
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,360
Well,
what's interesting is that if the camera

424
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:11,470
was locked off than up until,
I'm sure this movie,

425
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:13,390
it's not locked off on everything.
What does that mean?

426
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:18,391
Locked off completely.
Not moving stabilized then it was always

427
00:19:19,811 --> 00:19:21,820
easier to do that.
I think,

428
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:23,710
you know,
the CGI type of things where you can put

429
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:27,550
somebody into things,
but this is like a real movie with real

430
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:28,380
dialogue.

431
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,150
I don't think that.
I think they're doing it all with

432
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:31,170
computers.
Yeah,

433
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,981
yeah,
exactly.

434
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:35,190
I think that if.
But he's got to act both sides of it.

435
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:37,050
Right?
So he's got to somehow or another act

436
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,690
both sides of it and he has to.
I mean,

437
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:42,360
I'm only assuming he,
he's physically in contact with someone.

438
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,200
They would have to somehow or another
get him to act out those scenes and

439
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,860
replace his face on the other person's
body or something.

440
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,850
Well,
they just did like,

441
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,990
if they're doing a tussle,
they're just doing the thing where like,

442
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,820
you know,
it's just the back of the head and then

443
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:54,800
they just flip,
you know,

444
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,640
when they're wrong around where it's
like a smaller,

445
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:58,860
weird,
creepy version of them that I did it

446
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:01,650
with,
that Pepsi Spice Commercial where I just

447
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:05,190
pretty much recorded the same two things
and then just split right down the

448
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:05,911
middle.
That's right.

449
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:09,120
I forgot about this.
This was like 15 years ago I did this.

450
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,430
Yeah.
These are hilarious myself.

451
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:14,210
This looks exactly like the commercial
for that.

452
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,430
Tom was talking about.
This is hilarious.

453
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,440
I forgot about that this morning and it.
Look,

454
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:22,110
I even put that in the Coffee Cup and
then I grabbed the coffee cup.

455
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,880
Look at that.
Boom.

456
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,390
That's actually cool.
Dude.

457
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:29,430
That was one of your finest,
finest hours.

458
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,190
The Pepsi Spice Days,
and I did that on paintbrush,

459
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,520
but what would you do if you had to have
like a confrontation?

460
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,140
Does he have a confrontation with his
brother?

461
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,420
I'm assuming he does.
Probably.

462
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,620
That's the only thing that I would think
would be the issue.

463
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:47,890
It was like you fighting with you

464
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,370
because that'd be really hard to mesh
together,

465
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,150
but otherwise if it's just you in a
separate scene,

466
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,990
are you in a scene with two of you?
Is You just have to do the scene twice?

467
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,640
It's still.
They have to combine it.

468
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,930
If you have to do one and then probably
they play back your thing when you're

469
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:09,030
talking to it.
Put shut.

470
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,220
God.
You ever seen Bronson?

471
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,630
Yes.
Amazing.

472
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,600
Amazing.
Yeah.

473
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,493
Yeah.
I saw that.

474
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,350
He was really good in that he's giving
everything.

475
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,100
He's just one of those guys.
He just knows how to just knows how to

476
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:22,110
do it.
Yeah.

477
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,550
Yeah.
It's a weird type of um,

478
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:31,090
like a respect we have for people also
that come from other countries.

479
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,300
Mean Americans love Americans,
but we also hold people from other

480
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:38,950
countries.
Have you have an English accent?

481
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:40,300
Will cut.
You all lost.

482
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,480
My God,
we love slack.

483
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,140
No
major raise.

484
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,590
It's everybody.
Everybody everywhere.

485
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,530
There's British accents everywhere,
everywhere,

486
00:21:53,531 --> 00:21:57,130
every show.
Because I only watch normal TV when I'm

487
00:21:57,131 --> 00:22:00,010
at a hotel and I've been doing the road
a lot lately,

488
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,170
so I've been stuck watching commercials
for the first time anyway.

489
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Every I watched world problems.
I watched this James Corden or whatever

490
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:12,700
they've been.
Yeah,

491
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,550
he was in.
He's the guy that just took over for

492
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:16,940
Craig Ferguson.
Oh,

493
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,350
what's also had an accent.
Everybody has an accent now on

494
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:21,450
everything.
Don't you think?

495
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,860
Craig Ferguson was good though.
I liked Craig Ferguson.

496
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:25,270
He was really good.
Totally good.

497
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,800
He brought a different element when it
was the Brittany spears thing when that

498
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:32,560
Brittany spears thing was going on and
she was shaving her head and he was

499
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:33,670
like,
why aren't we doing this?

500
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:36,670
Like why?
Why would we like attack this girl?

501
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,700
And I think in a lot of ways like his,
like sort of reasonable approach to

502
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,730
addressing the subject instead of like
cracking jokes about it when it was like

503
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,600
she was shaving her head and just like
you're,

504
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,010
you're looking at a person that's having
some,

505
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,950
some serious stress and mental problems
probably.

506
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,680
And all we're doing is just piling onto
that.

507
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,030
And he made this like really reasonable
measured plea and I remember thinking

508
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:01,571
like,
wow,

509
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:04,070
that was a genuine thing.
Like that wasn't a,

510
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,570
that didn't seem like some of fake
pumped up pr move to try to get people

511
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:15,520
to view him a different way.
It seemed very genuine.

512
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,430
And um,
unfortunately Brittany spears wasn't

513
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:21,650
watching Craig Ferguson messages never
got throats.

514
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,290
You know,
people did leave her alone.

515
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:26,230
They kind of leave her alone now.
But she was obviously having some sort

516
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:27,390
of a breakdown.
Yeah,

517
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,100
she was something going on.
There was,

518
00:23:29,101 --> 00:23:31,600
she was.
And I don't know if anybody could ever

519
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:36,601
be expected to respond well to the kind
of stress that someone in her position

520
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,490
and doors.
She's like some stupid,

521
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:43,720
crazy superstar,
like a beyonce type character or Jamesy

522
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,130
like that of stress.
Level's

523
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,700
got to be insane.
She's calmed down a lot.

524
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:51,980
Right?
She does that thing in Vegas now.

525
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,740
She does like a vegas show.
Did you,

526
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,890
were you a fan of Craig Ferguson show?
He's good.

527
00:23:57,891 --> 00:23:59,510
Do you know the robot?
The Guy,

528
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,880
the guy that played the robot in his
name is Josh,

529
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:05,330
Robert Thompson.
And he played the robot for whatever,

530
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:07,790
11 years on that show or however long
the show is,

531
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,110
he kinda got screwed by the show because
no one knows who he was.

532
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:13,580
They never said,
hey,

533
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:14,630
by the way,
this is him.

534
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:16,700
So this guy,
he's on periscope all the time.

535
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,720
Really interesting guy.
A check him out.

536
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:24,380
He's just really,
it's really sad though as names Josh,

537
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,750
Robert Thompson.
And it's just like imagine being on a

538
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:30,530
fucking tonight show or no one knew who
you were the whole time.

539
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,010
So does he just complain about this on
it's Paris.

540
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,960
He does seem like he's always getting
screwed.

541
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:40,610
Like he made.
He just released this new video the

542
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:43,220
other day with George Lucas and it has
her friend,

543
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,780
uh,
what's the guy with the really built

544
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:45,690
body?
Uh,

545
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,470
uh,
that used to be a writer on that show.

546
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,920
He's been on killed Tony before.
Fuck,

547
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:55,190
I can't really good body member.
He always takes off his shirt and like a

548
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:57,740
six pack of.
Oh,

549
00:24:57,741 --> 00:24:58,720
Bob.
Yeah.

550
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,630
Bob.
So bob did a video with a.

551
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,120
never thought you were talking about Bob
Osha Gay porn star that's infiltrated

552
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:11,360
the comments,
preparing myself for future encounters.

553
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,720
Like why is this is what Brian considers
a guy with a good body pop.

554
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,730
You see Tommy,
he's very fit.

555
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,200
He might be the nicest guy that's ever
lived.

556
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,120
Totally.
If he's not the nicest,

557
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:28,520
he's in the top 10 of the nicest people
of all time.

558
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,200
I love him.

559
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,070
Nah,
but anyway,

560
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,760
he made a video with Josh.
Robert Thompson where they.

561
00:25:32,761 --> 00:25:34,740
Josh,
Robert Thompson Played George Lucas

562
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:39,620
after you on his ranch and he looks just
like a George Lucas.

563
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,100
Wow.
Fun Little.

564
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,570
Oh yeah.
I think I saw some of that.

565
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,580
Yeah,
Dude.

566
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,900
Dude,
he's a funny fucking guy.

567
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:47,050
Bob Osha.
I love him.

568
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,370
One of the best.
He should be doing a podcast.

569
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,420
I think

570
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,330
I was supposed to start mine with him.
He was going to be my cohost and then I

571
00:25:54,331 --> 00:25:57,810
decided not to have a cohort.
It's that the last time he also really

572
00:25:57,811 --> 00:25:58,260
busy.

573
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,270
You don't.
It's not like you have 52 different

574
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,180
things you have to do all day long.
You could do another podcast once a week

575
00:26:03,181 --> 00:26:04,060
with him.
Yeah.

576
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,600
I said great guy to where he could do
one on his own is one of the great guy.

577
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,070
He's such a good dude and kill Tony
Sharp.

578
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,880
Such a.
He just loves joke writing so much does

579
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,640
and so when these guys come in with a
premise or whatever,

580
00:26:20,641 --> 00:26:21,520
he'll just go,
you know,

581
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:22,331
if you go Bah,
Bah,

582
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:22,561
Bah,
Bah,

583
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:27,050
Bah Bah and band the crowd that already
heard that premise and punchline,

584
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,390
but it's all restructured.
He just repeats it back because he has

585
00:26:30,391 --> 00:26:32,540
that math brain.
It's just like dit dit,

586
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:32,781
dit,
dit,

587
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:33,614
dit,
dit,

588
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,160
one of the notoriously like one of the
most respected comedy writers around

589
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:40,560
town and the and the writing gigs that
I've done.

590
00:26:40,561 --> 00:26:44,250
He's come up in every writer's room and
everybody around the table

591
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,760
that are working together always ends up
talking about where and when they worked

592
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:49,860
with Bob [inaudible] and how cool and
nice he is.

593
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,900
That's awesome.
That's so good to hear.

594
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,590
Always a good say.
Good stomach back.

595
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:00,200
Always organically.
Not Mcguire stomach.

596
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,930
I'm using mcguire.
It's mcguire who?

597
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,080
Chris Mcguire.
Oh Chris Mcguire.

598
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,943
STOIC,
how's that?

599
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,810
I've never seen Chris.
He's a normal guy.

600
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,840
The only one I ever seen Chris Mcguire,
stomach reference like that might be the

601
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:18,000
most difficult to put your head around
because if you don't know Chris Mcguire,

602
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,160
funny,
standup comedian.

603
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:21,710
He's not.
He doesn't have like an unusual stomach.

604
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,750
It's normal stuff.
He looks like a normal guy.

605
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:29,390
If he's standing there,
it's stupid to be sure that that was

606
00:27:29,391 --> 00:27:31,760
his.
Like if you had like if you saw joey

607
00:27:31,761 --> 00:27:33,620
Diaz,
his stomach and like a side view you

608
00:27:33,621 --> 00:27:34,131
like,
yeah,

609
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:34,870
that looks like.
Well,

610
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,170
right.
That's about joey.

611
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,960
If you saw silhouette and someone said
whose stomach is that?

612
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,850
He wouldn't go.
Tony Hinchcliffe know.

613
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,890
But Chris Mcguire.
Fuck man.

614
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,780
It can be.
It can be Jamie.

615
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,710
We,
Chris Mcguire.

616
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,490
Now I want to know now.
I want to see it.

617
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,440
I wish he'd
let me see.

618
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,860
Yeah,
he's um,

619
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,480
he's a great guy to Christopher Dwyer,

620
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,750
him,
Greg Fitzsimmons and I started out like

621
00:27:57,751 --> 00:27:59,880
within a week of each other.
That's so crazy.

622
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,040
It's interesting.
It's interesting.

623
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:05,520
All these years later,
I have that same thing with a few guys

624
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:08,850
and it's amazing because there's
definitely like a special bond that

625
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:09,740
happens when,
you know,

626
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,670
this started around the same time.
Yeah,

627
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:12,810
for sure.
You hadn't,

628
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:17,370
you'd known each other through the whole
process of being fucking horrible,

629
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,770
totally incompetent,
but just starry eyed for the,

630
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,650
the idea of being a comic and chasing
these dreams together and there's

631
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:28,950
nothing more fun than when you see one
of those guys doing something cool,

632
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,740
you know.
But it's cool to see in comics do

633
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:34,350
something cool.
And we all been talking about this at

634
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:38,310
the store lately that this is one of the
things about this generation and this,

635
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:40,710
uh,
this era as it were,

636
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,170
is that a good thing to say this era of
comedy,

637
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:47,280
but this time is that people like comics
are real supportive of each other and I

638
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:50,940
don't think that ever existed before.
There wasn't like a bunch of comics

639
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:54,510
promoting each other on shows like the
way people are now.

640
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,630
It didn't really exist before because
there were so few spots.

641
00:28:57,631 --> 00:28:59,610
Like if you got on tv,
you had a coveted,

642
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,720
you had it,
this is mine,

643
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:05,520
it was like this famine mentality,
but now that a lot of what we're doing

644
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:08,240
is internet driven,
whether it's your Netflix special

645
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,590
which comes out this Friday,
January eight,

646
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,580
18th,
January,

647
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,423
fifth,
15th,

648
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,400
one shot.
It's available this Friday.

649
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,580
Whether it's stuff like that which is
Internet based in which is almost all of

650
00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:24,320
the fucking specials that you're hearing
about now,

651
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:29,180
are these Internet based specials and
television shows that are Internet

652
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:30,740
based.
I mean Netflix is just.

653
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,900
They have so much fucking programming
now.

654
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:36,710
There's so many different things that
you can watch that are Internet based,

655
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,080
but I think comics have,
like most of us have gotten to podcast a

656
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:41,980
giant amount of

657
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,790
us and he realized like this is way more
fun and way easier to do than a

658
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:49,870
television show.
And through that everybody says you

659
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,130
should do it too and you should do it
too.

660
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:55,360
And they all do it together and he
developed this weird network and this is

661
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,560
like a network of supporters.
So I think when we all see someone who's

662
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:01,180
doing really good,
you know,

663
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,830
it's uh,
it's interesting.

664
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,450
It's interesting to watch like,
Ooh,

665
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:06,060
it's happening again.
Yeah.

666
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,880
You know,
it's amazing.

667
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,420
Brian,
your new podcast was the top 15.

668
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Yeah,
it got down to seven.

669
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,810
Really?
Yeah.

670
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,670
That's amazing.
St Francis.

671
00:30:14,671 --> 00:30:17,170
It's really amazing.
We had among the second episode it

672
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,021
awesome.
Dude.

673
00:30:18,021 --> 00:30:21,800
I'm so glad you decided to do it too
because you know,

674
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:25,550
you have a very unusual sense of humor
that a lot of people like.

675
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,090
It's like trying to find the right
vehicle for it.

676
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,610
It's like,
I think the right vehicle for you is

677
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:33,950
just do your own thing,
do your own thing,

678
00:30:33,951 --> 00:30:35,560
and when you do do it,
it's a,

679
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,750
it's fucking fun because you get to be
free.

680
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:40,370
You get to be,
you know,

681
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,960
you're just such a silly Weirdo

682
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,040
and I'm trying to lose 40 pounds in
three months.

683
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:49,180
The first three months of the episodes I
weigh in every episode and today I

684
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,660
weighed in a 14 pounds less since
January first.

685
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,690
Wow.
That's awesome.

686
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,630
I love doing these with you too.
I mean,

687
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,190
it's always fun.
We always have a good time.

688
00:30:57,191 --> 00:31:00,070
It's always silly,
but I'm really glad you're doing your

689
00:31:00,071 --> 00:31:02,470
own as well because I think that it's
going to be.

690
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,230
I think it's got to be real successful.
It's going to be.

691
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,250
It's,
it's all,

692
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,010
it's,
it's something that you can pursue and

693
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:11,800
like you could say,
I want to talk to this interesting

694
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:14,050
person.
I want to talk to this cool guy,

695
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,930
like maybe I can get him on my podcast
and then all of a sudden you get them

696
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:19,660
and you're sitting there talking to this
person and as a Pir,

697
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,750
as a human being,
like if you're allowed to pursue your

698
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:26,530
interests like that.
It's very enriching and I think what the

699
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:29,620
audience gets out of it.
That's such a fucking pompous word,

700
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,850
but that is what it's like.

701
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,280
It's like enriching and what the
audience gets out of it.

702
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:38,170
It's like they get to go on this like
really cool adventure with you and some

703
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:41,410
of the best aspects of the adventure,
like having conversations with these

704
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:44,470
cool and funny and interesting people.
They get to be in on them.

705
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,210
They get to sit there and be a part of
like your little adventure through

706
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:53,110
choosing your interests and so that's
what I think everybody should have every

707
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:57,250
like comic who has any interest in
whatsoever should have a podcast because

708
00:31:57,251 --> 00:32:00,340
you get to see them go down there a
little.

709
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,100
The adventure of their interests,
you know,

710
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,860
like if you listen to bill birth
podcast,

711
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,060
like I don't pay attention to football,
so the only part I can't listen to it

712
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:10,270
when he started talking about football
and they should've done this and the

713
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:13,210
defense was that I'd done because he's a
football fanatic,

714
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:18,420
but the rest of it is just bill talking
about how he's living his life and how

715
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,560
he's going through his life.

716
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,820
And it's really interesting.
It's really interesting to follow

717
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:29,400
someone follow their interests.
Follow like what make,

718
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,910
what's,
what's curious to them.

719
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,240
Like when you don't have any other
agenda like in your agenda isn't man

720
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,510
what we need to get good ratings.
We're going to need to get some people

721
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:39,950
in here that are doing some things that
people are aware of.

722
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,740
Which is how you think of like every
other talk show,

723
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:45,890
right?
They all become almost generic in a way

724
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:50,270
because even like letterman who was like
fiercely independent and very smart and

725
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:54,770
just overly critical of like shitty
stuff and a smart guy like didn't like

726
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:56,780
his own stuff.
Half the time he would do his own show

727
00:32:56,781 --> 00:32:58,070
and it would be brilliant and he'd be
like,

728
00:32:58,071 --> 00:33:01,040
fuck,
I hate myself that he was crazy like

729
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:01,461
that.
Right.

730
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:04,100
That was like the thing about Letterman,
but who would he have on his show?

731
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,580
He's like regular people,
man who sell on a fucking movie,

732
00:33:07,581 --> 00:33:09,800
who selling a song,
who selling to this,

733
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,440
who's got a TV show and it does the same
thing.

734
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:17,030
And so David have humorous or a
conversation with these people and say

735
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:19,460
funny stuff,
but the bottom line is that's not who he

736
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:21,920
chooses.
That's not what he wants to do.

737
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,701
Right?
If he,

738
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:25,010
if you could say,
all cost aside,

739
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:28,130
all consideration of ratings aside,
who would you want to talk to Dave?

740
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:32,030
Then you would get a chance to see,
but the way the system is set up,

741
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,020
even though it's a fantastic system,
if it works out and you get something

742
00:33:36,021 --> 00:33:38,900
like the Jimmy Fallon tonight show,
which I think is excellent,

743
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,180
I think Jimmy Fallon's the best tonight
show guy ever.

744
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,360
I have a showcase for it tonight.
I think he's the best.

745
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,153
He's fucking great.

746
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,890
I can't talk about anything that I've
been working on and that's what's funny

747
00:33:49,891 --> 00:33:51,180
though.
I have this brand new,

748
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:54,900
a 15 minute chunk that I'm just in love
with right now,

749
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:58,530
like it's just expanding and breathing
and I'm talking about crazy,

750
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,280
crazy shit,
but I thought I was thinking about it on

751
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:03,780
the way here because I just got the
call.

752
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,800
My manager is like,
Hey,

753
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:07,230
are you available to do a tonight show
showcase tonight?

754
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,580
And I'm literally like,
yeah,

755
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,480
heck yeah blah,
blah blah.

756
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:12,030
And I'd get off the phone and I start
thinking about everything I've been

757
00:34:12,031 --> 00:34:15,090
working out and I know for a fact I
can't do any of it.

758
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,260
Not a single bit.

759
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,870
That sucks.
Yeah.

760
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,760
You get these new weapons.

761
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,210
Oh yeah.
And they're right there and I know I

762
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:24,850
would kill harder than anybody else on
this.

763
00:34:24,851 --> 00:34:27,700
I don't even know who's on it,
but I just know like how I feel about my

764
00:34:27,701 --> 00:34:31,000
material right now is like I'm in like
championship mode.

765
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,880
And uh,
with this new stuff though,

766
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:37,360
that's what's crazy is I'm going to have
to really figure out and fanangle

767
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,890
thank [inaudible].
Well let's look at it this way.

768
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:42,860
But think of the tonight show with no
censorship.

769
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,830
Think of the tonight show on Netflix.
Lead with that show.

770
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:48,470
But totally.
How good would that show be if someone

771
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:53,000
like Jamie Foxx could go on and sit next
to the couch and say whatever the fuck

772
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,230
you want,
you know,

773
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,980
someone like Mike Tyson swearing,
you know some.

774
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,780
Why don't I go with two black people.
I love your Jamie Foxx.

775
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:01,190
Love.
I love that guy.

776
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,380
I think Jamie Foxx is amazing.
If you heard his interview with Tim

777
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:06,770
Ferriss,
you would,

778
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,570
you would look at him in a different
life.

779
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,120
Like I've always thought he's insanely
talented.

780
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,330
I like the fact that he could play Ray
Charles and then he played that.

781
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,140
I'm the guy with mental illness that was
a homeless guy who was a musician and

782
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:22,040
the Robert Downey jr movie,
and he can act his fucking ass

783
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,230
and he's singing in Django unchained.
I mean,

784
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,123
unbelievable.

785
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,240
When you,
uh,

786
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:31,140
you listened to his,
the way he talks to tim first,

787
00:35:31,141 --> 00:35:33,600
you kind of get an understanding of why
he's the way he is.

788
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,240
Just a bad motherfucker.
Just a super talented,

789
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:38,100
super,
super sharp thinking.

790
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,690
Dude.
Interesting.

791
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,110
I love that guys like that exist.
You know,

792
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,010
like,
do,

793
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,200
you don't necessarily want to do what
they're doing,

794
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,160
but just knowing that there's people
like that that exists,

795
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:51,150
you're like,
wow,

796
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,750
yeah,
real rock stars,

797
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:57,840
redos or just they're operating on a
fucking super high level with a lot of

798
00:35:57,841 --> 00:36:00,480
different things.
Like Jamie Foxx can sing his ass off.

799
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,190
Like he's saying,
he's a really good,

800
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,430
totally insane.
Like he could have,

801
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,280
he could just do,
he could do any one of those careers

802
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,960
regularly.
I know it's interesting,

803
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:11,490
right?
It's interesting.

804
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,320
He,
I don't know how much standup he does

805
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,740
anymore though.
I don't know.

806
00:36:14,741 --> 00:36:17,610
I think he got to doing too many
different things.

807
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,890
Standups.
Definitely one of those things where

808
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,060
you've got to be doing just that.
Yeah.

809
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,700
Yeah.
Got To work at.

810
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,580
If you're not doing it,
if you're not doing it all the time,

811
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,990
boy,
it gets slippery,

812
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,853
Huh?
Yeah.

813
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:33,570
I just took a four nights off in a row
for the first time in forever.

814
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,820
Four nights in a row.
I should feel.

815
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,350
I have felt.
I came back.

816
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,850
Shay was reinvigorating.
Animalistic.

817
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:47,590
I just saw last night was my first spot
and four nights and I'm just standing in

818
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:49,800
the back of the room with just fucking
like.

819
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,140
I was like,
I'm crazy.

820
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:53,900
You know what I mean?
I just love crazy.

821
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:59,100
You're so silly or crazy,
but literally like I go up there and uh,

822
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,010
it was at the Irvine Improv.
It was insane.

823
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:06,840
This lady stood up during my set at one
point because I'm talking about this one

824
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:11,910
part of one thing where I talk about how
trump's going on win this shit and

825
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:13,350
here's why.
You know what I mean?

826
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:17,850
And,
and basically like this lady stands up

827
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,880
and you can tell that I'm a comedian on
a stage and everybody else could.

828
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,970
But this one lady out of 200 stands up
and starts waving her arms and she's

829
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:27,691
like,
stop,

830
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:28,950
stop,
stop.

831
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:30,930
I'm like,
Oh shit.

832
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,730
But I'm still like staying in the
pocket.

833
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:35,610
Go on with the joke.
But for another like 10 seconds.

834
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:36,870
But she's still like,
stop,

835
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:37,950
stop.
And it's.

836
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,880
My jokes were killing so I'm like,
you motherfucker.

837
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,770
So I bailed out and I go,
what the fuck is your problem,

838
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:44,760
lady?
What is the what?

839
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,780
What's going on?
She's like,

840
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:48,570
Donald trump will never be our
president.

841
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,590
Oh my God.
What makes your opinion so big that

842
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:55,140
you're talking?
And none of these other 200 people are

843
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,850
yelling right now.
I go,

844
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:59,430
what the fuck makes sure vote such a big
deal.

845
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:00,900
What do you do for a living?
And she goes,

846
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:02,640
well basically I'm A.
I go,

847
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:06,330
what the fuck do you do for a living?
Crowd's going crazy.

848
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,171
She goes,
well,

849
00:38:07,171 --> 00:38:08,680
right now I'm unemployed.
I go,

850
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:10,830
then your vote doesn't even fucking that
art.

851
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,840
You're not even paying taxes.
Wow is this whole crazy thing?

852
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,720
But she ended up leaving.
Of course you should have been kicked

853
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:21,450
out because I'm going to end up in
interrupt a bit in the middle of the

854
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,550
bed.
You stand up at a movie and say,

855
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,310
don't kill a solo.
You don't do it right.

856
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,540
You don't do it.
It's so stupid.

857
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,700
Stupid.
She was flipping me off.

858
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:36,310
It was so great.
I was just destroying her entire long

859
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,090
walk out of the Irvine Improv.
It's a long walk too.

860
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,720
Yeah,
Dude.

861
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,730
Come on.
So much fun.

862
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,230
People to stop.
Hecklers need to fucking just not ever

863
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:50,410
go see shows.
They need to stop Ron Guy.

864
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,270
When you make that our drive to Irvine,
it's just.

865
00:38:53,271 --> 00:38:56,440
They don't know man.
I think people just don't know how

866
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:58,570
ridiculous it is.
You know?

867
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,430
You just don't think they realize that
it's you're in the middle of this piece

868
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,940
and this piece is a lot of places that
it has to go to.

869
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,940
You have to go left and you have to go
right and you have to trick them a

870
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:13,900
little bit and then you bring it home at
the end and this woman is like in the

871
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,170
middle of this thing screaming out and
it's interesting because I'm,

872
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,350
I never,
and I've tried here and there with jokes

873
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:21,111
over,
you know,

874
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:25,900
the eight years of doing this,
but I'm never really a a political guy,

875
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:29,230
but with this new election thing that
I'm doing right now,

876
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:33,820
I feel really good about it,
but it's amazing how the different

877
00:39:33,821 --> 00:39:38,821
reactions that you get around the
country doing this dust is a charged

878
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:40,414
subject.

879
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,600
It's a charged subject in a weird time.
This is probably the weirdest selection

880
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:50,830
ever because this is the only election I
can ever remember where there's only one

881
00:39:50,831 --> 00:39:54,400
candidate that his supporters are really
fucking excited about them.

882
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,640
And then there's a bunch of other people
that you're like,

883
00:39:57,641 --> 00:39:58,900
man,
I don't know.

884
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:02,020
I don't know.
I mean like Bernie Sanders seems like a

885
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:03,460
really Nice Guy,
you know?

886
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,410
I mean,
he doesn't seem evil at all.

887
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,011
Right?
I mean,

888
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:11,011
maybe he's the best of all the choices
available except for people make money.

889
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,730
I'd love it if you got in.
I'd love it if he just interesting won

890
00:40:15,731 --> 00:40:17,170
the election.
It was just like,

891
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,090
oh,
I was just fucking with you guys the

892
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:19,924
whole time.
I'm a,

893
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,720
I'm an old white man.
Go fuck yourselves.

894
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,650
Back to the old system,
you know?

895
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,560
Well,
I don't think he would survive.

896
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,210
I mean,
he already looks like he's done a few

897
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:29,650
terms,
you know what I mean?

898
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,483
Like does,
right.

899
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,070
All these other presidents go in there
looking good,

900
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:35,560
you know,
dark brown hair and then they all come

901
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:37,480
out looking like,
like,

902
00:40:37,481 --> 00:40:39,640
uh,
what's his name?

903
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,550
But not who we're talking about Obama.
Look at Obama.

904
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,160
We,
we've,

905
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,230
we've shown side by side images of him
from 2009 to 2015.

906
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,530
It's crazy.
He looks like he's aged like 20 plus

907
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,364
years.
Yeah,

908
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,290
easily.
It's hard job,

909
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,420
man.
I don't think anybody can do it.

910
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,380
I think at one point in time we're going
to realize that the idea that we keep

911
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:03,910
clinging to have a single guy that's in
charge of the whole country is stupid.

912
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,930
It doesn't make any sense.
Like why would you have one person be in

913
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:10,600
charge of anything?
Why don't have like a giant,

914
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,720
gigantic team of people and why not have
the influence of the public a daily

915
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:19,720
basis be tuned into this gigantic group
of people with,

916
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:24,721
of course reasonable filters for
hysterics when something crazy happens

917
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:27,570
and all of a sudden people want to nuke,
you know,

918
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,610
some country or something like that
system to change.

919
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:34,100
What's amazing is like,
I think that we would have to have

920
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:39,110
basically a trump as a president for
people to really have a discussion over

921
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:41,420
four years about how things have to
change because of,

922
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,690
you know,
it depends on how he does at the same

923
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:45,730
time.
Well,

924
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:49,460
there's some of the things he says like,
I actually can,

925
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,840
like the other day,
I don't know,

926
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:54,170
I was just walking out of a hotel and
the news was on the TV and it says,

927
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,110
you know,
trump says that Germany terrorist

928
00:41:57,111 --> 00:41:59,360
attacks or because they let those people
in.

929
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,360
That's all that I saw at first.
I'm like,

930
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,160
yeah,
what an idiotic thing to say.

931
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,510
And then I thought about it and it's
like,

932
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,130
well,
they did let what,

933
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:09,920
like a million people in or something
crazy.

934
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:10,720
Well,

935
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,790
there's a real issue in Germany.
Yeah,

936
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:17,850
and the mayor of Cologne,
which is in this insane move was telling

937
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:25,150
women how they should behave around
these men and that they should stay

938
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:29,290
within arm's length.
It's fucking crazy.

939
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,260
It's victim blaming.
I mean they're resorting to victim

940
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:36,610
blaming to try to take focus away from
the fact that what they've done is

941
00:42:36,611 --> 00:42:39,670
they've led in a bunch of people from
another culture who behave differently.

942
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,720
It's maybe not their fault.
Maybe let's look at it this way.

943
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,780
This is the way they lived in their
other country.

944
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,530
They're coming into your country.
They're going to behave the way they've

945
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:53,050
behaved all 37 years of their life
because that's what they do,

946
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,830
and so now you have to deal with that in
your culture and the way to deal with is

947
00:42:56,831 --> 00:43:00,970
not to say women should fucking stay
arms length away from these people is to

948
00:43:00,971 --> 00:43:03,760
educate these people about the rules of
this place.

949
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:07,030
You can't do that.
You can't just sexually assault women.

950
00:43:07,031 --> 00:43:09,280
They're going to get drunk.
Girls could dress however the fuck they

951
00:43:09,281 --> 00:43:12,280
want and you can't tell those girls.
Now you're on your own.

952
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,410
You just have to stay arms length away
from somebody.

953
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,440
You can't because everybody's so scared
of being racist.

954
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,650
Everybody's so scared of being
Islamophobic that they don't want to

955
00:43:20,651 --> 00:43:25,510
point out the forget about ideologies or
forget about skin color,

956
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,910
people of origin.
You have some people that are doing

957
00:43:27,911 --> 00:43:31,300
something that's not good to some people
that haven't had these things done to

958
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:33,670
them like this before.
You got to figure out what to do.

959
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,300
You got you let in a different culture.
It's not,

960
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,220
it's not their fault,
but it is.

961
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,720
It is what it is.
You know what?

962
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:41,381
I'm saying,
I mean,

963
00:43:41,381 --> 00:43:43,900
it's not,
you can't deny that it exists.

964
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,250
It is,
it is a thing,

965
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,670
and there's a lot of people,
uh,

966
00:43:48,671 --> 00:43:53,671
that were pointing to,
they're pointing to letting people like

967
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:55,950
that in this country and they're saying,
well,

968
00:43:55,951 --> 00:43:57,040
you know,
what are we going to do?

969
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,860
What are we going to do?
Have Syrian refugees coming to America?

970
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,070
I was just gonna invite a million Syrian
refugees in America.

971
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:06,910
And if you look at the history of
America,

972
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,310
that's what people have always done.
We've always led in.

973
00:44:09,311 --> 00:44:10,960
People from other countries are trying
to get away.

974
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:12,400
I mean,
that's how this country got founded.

975
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,470
So ideally we'd all want to say,
yeah,

976
00:44:14,471 --> 00:44:17,800
these are the people that are running
away from the people that are doing

977
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:20,620
terrible things to them,
but you're going to get some shitheads

978
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,210
who definitely going to get some
shitheads.

979
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,370
So how do you deal with that?
That's a good question.

980
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:25,840
I don't think that's a question for one
person.

981
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,820
I mean,
even in one person at a cabinet and when

982
00:44:27,821 --> 00:44:31,980
one person has veto power and what man,
I think there

983
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,750
should be.
I fucking team of phds and Super Smart

984
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:41,610
motherfuckers with who get evaluated on
a regular basis for ego problems,

985
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:43,410
alcoholism,
all of the above.

986
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:44,244
I mean,
you should have,

987
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:48,420
if you're testing mixed martial arts
fighter to see if they're on steroids,

988
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,940
you should be testing congressmen and
senators.

989
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:52,850
See if they're fucking crazy.
Right?

990
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,510
See if the what?
What are they on?

991
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,280
You know,
what kind of fucking antidepressants are

992
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:57,770
you on?
It's affecting your judgment.

993
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,760
What you know.
How often do you take volume?

994
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,190
How often do you take ambien to go to
sleep?

995
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:03,570
What do you.
What happens?

996
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:05,340
You lose a sleep cycle there.
Something.

997
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,610
Is there some wacky non sleep that's
going on when your ambient out of your

998
00:45:08,611 --> 00:45:09,390
head?
Oh yeah.

999
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:12,570
Viagara these congressmen.
What are they doing with all the blood

1000
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:16,710
rushing down and we'll be doing with
them whenever tony making their wieners

1001
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:18,870
bigger.
Sure.

1002
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,733
Yeah.
I think,

1003
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,180
yeah.

1004
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,020
Congressmen and Senators and
representatives.

1005
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:33,990
State representatives is a
representative government.

1006
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:38,070
It's all a pot.
Weird popularity contests like Arnold

1007
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:40,800
Schwarzenegger was.
The governor like that doesn't make any

1008
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:41,910
sense,
but it does.

1009
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,830
He's a fiscal conservative guy who's
open minded in a sense of like socially

1010
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:51,831
open minded like as in terms of how he
views a gay people and and even

1011
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,150
recreational drug use and things along
those lines is a very open minded almost

1012
00:45:57,151 --> 00:46:00,060
like with a libertarian bent but a
Republican,

1013
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:03,120
so it actually wasn't a bad choice.
It didn't do a great job,

1014
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,080
but guess what,
if you're dealing with a bunch a shit,

1015
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,690
a bunch of red tape and bullshit and if
you ever hear him describe his time in

1016
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:11,940
office,
it's pretty interesting stuff like you

1017
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:14,220
don't realize,
I think from the outside like some like

1018
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:19,360
Uri have zero political aspirations or
motivations or once you get in man,

1019
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:26,570
you're dealing with this insane system
of like how things get done and how

1020
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:32,940
people will filibuster and people will
block this because it'll anger their

1021
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:36,720
constituents because these people are
paying for that and these people are

1022
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:39,390
paying you to make sure that this
doesn't pass through because that'll get

1023
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:40,710
that through watch house of cards.

1024
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,890
Yeah.
I just started.

1025
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,890
Oh my God.
That's my favorite thing.

1026
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,220
I don't know how accurate it is,
but if it's even fucking 10 percent,

1027
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,760
we're doing fact.
Ten percent.

1028
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,030
It's a great show though.
Kevin Spacey is a bad motherfucker.

1029
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:57,000
I love it when he looks at the camera
and just starts talking.

1030
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,520
He's another one.
He's a different guy in this.

1031
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,540
He's a different guy in the show with a
very distinct accent and you buy it.

1032
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,060
You're not going like,
that's Kevin Spacey,

1033
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,080
right?
It's.

1034
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,600
He just becomes.
That person becomes another person.

1035
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,300
Frank Underwood.
What's going on with that shirt?

1036
00:47:12,301 --> 00:47:13,320
Brian?
What is that?

1037
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:14,780
Right?
Oh,

1038
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:17,020
the security guard shirt.
Is that what it is?

1039
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:21,060
Thrift stores.
It's funny when I wear it because I went

1040
00:47:21,061 --> 00:47:23,670
to starbucks and Mexicans gave me double
looks real quick.

1041
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:27,090
It was pretty funny how rude.
That's so racist,

1042
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,980
but it happened twice.
Today.

1043
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,913
Happened twice

1044
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:34,000
when.
Why is it that they chose a blue color

1045
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:37,120
with like a dark blue pocket thing for
security.

1046
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:40,660
That's universal.
It looks like he got his badge ripped

1047
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:44,320
off of them and because it's maybe did
it himself when he quit.

1048
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,370
Fuck this job.
Yeah,

1049
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,550
that's what you want to do when you quit
the sheriff's department.

1050
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:50,560
Right.
Pull that star off and you throw it on

1051
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:51,580
the ground.
I've done.

1052
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,160
You've watched making a murderer,
right?

1053
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,350
I have not watched waking.
Wow.

1054
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,340
I know.
I keep hearing that.

1055
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,440
Wow.
I watched soaked in bleach.

1056
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,980
That's good.
Yeah.

1057
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:01,933
Yeah.
Drop it.

1058
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,640
You think about that soaked in bleach.

1059
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,350
Um,
there's a lot in that movie,

1060
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:10,790
man.
It's the movie that alleges that

1061
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,920
Courtney Love was involved in some way
and Kurt cobain's death.

1062
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,630
Too Long of a movie.
But yeah,

1063
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,900
it's too long.
If you watch the other movie and then

1064
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:21,910
watch that movie each other.
Moving to the,

1065
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:24,910
the official one with his daughter made
Francis.

1066
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:26,410
What is it called again?
Montage.

1067
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,630
Montage of heck yeah,
that's the HBO one.

1068
00:48:28,631 --> 00:48:29,120
Right,
right,

1069
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:29,830
right.
That's,

1070
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:34,150
that seems more like closer to what I
think really happened,

1071
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:37,180
you know,
I didn't even see that drugs and it

1072
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:39,070
doesn't make it look like he's
murdering.

1073
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:41,290
It just looks like he wanted to kill
himself the whole time.

1074
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:43,570
And he put it in his lyrics.
He wrote about it.

1075
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,550
He,
he was,

1076
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,960
you know,
it was like it was going to happen.

1077
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:51,790
I mean that's what that movie made it
seem more like it's so hard to decipher

1078
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,950
when someone's gone,
what they were,

1079
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,220
what they actually thought and what they
actually were like.

1080
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:01,090
Because when you put it through the
filter of what we know about how we

1081
00:49:01,091 --> 00:49:04,300
describe other people,
it might be off about something or how

1082
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:09,190
people describe the past and they try to
idealize certain aspects of it.

1083
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,300
Like if it was made by his daughter,
she wasn't alive when he was doing that.

1084
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,570
So she's getting it from other people
who were there who,

1085
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,430
you know,
he's getting it from her own,

1086
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,750
his own journalistic music and
journalism has a whole movies and it has

1087
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,240
everything in it like that.
It's pretty much,

1088
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,600
I believe that montage of heck is like a
documentary about Kurt cobain and soaked

1089
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:36,151
in bleach is a documentary about the
possibility of Courtney and I'll tell

1090
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:38,350
you this,
is that no matter what happened,

1091
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:42,310
it's unbelievable how bad the Seattle
Police Department dropped the ball on

1092
00:49:42,311 --> 00:49:46,150
that to walk in on some guy just killed
himself.

1093
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,360
That's worth,
God only knows what I mean.

1094
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,950
I don't even know if they say during
that,

1095
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:54,130
but you know,
his collection has to be worth at least

1096
00:49:54,131 --> 00:49:56,380
$100,
million dollars or something crazy.

1097
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:57,263
Well,
it was just a.

1098
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:59,320
A bad police department.
Yeah.

1099
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:03,100
It was just what it was is a high
profile case in a bad police department,

1100
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:06,640
but now imagine that they had probably
been running that police department in a

1101
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:11,110
shitty way for as long as that guy had
been running it because as long as

1102
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:14,620
you're a regular person that doesn't
have the public's eye paying attention

1103
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:16,900
to the case with extreme scrutiny.
And again,

1104
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:18,520
this was in 1994,
right.

1105
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,130
You know,
today it would be a different animal

1106
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:23,140
today.
It would be in social media and it would

1107
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,760
blow up,
but it'd be gigantic.

1108
00:50:24,761 --> 00:50:27,470
It'd be way more scrutiny,
but back then they can kind of

1109
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:28,220
consolidate

1110
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,740
everything.
They can compartmentalize everything and

1111
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:33,950
they just shifted the whole thing up.
They did their fucking.

1112
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:36,500
Their accounts different from the first
responders accounts,

1113
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:40,160
their description of the room deferred.
There's so much of it that was off.

1114
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,900
It was that they are,
they're terrible,

1115
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,990
and it was just,
they had never done a high profile case,

1116
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:48,350
so they're,
they're terrible police work hadn't been

1117
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:51,440
revealed to anybody that wasn't like the
victim of it.

1118
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,281
You know,
someone who who.

1119
00:50:52,281 --> 00:50:54,740
I mean,
I'm assuming that if they fucked up this

1120
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:56,030
case,
he probably fucked up other ones as

1121
00:50:56,031 --> 00:50:56,240
well.

1122
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,100
You're going to shit yourself when you
watch this show,

1123
00:50:58,101 --> 00:50:59,810
man.
You should just cut all the shows off

1124
00:50:59,811 --> 00:51:02,870
right now and just watch the first
episode and you will making a murderer.

1125
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:03,800
Yeah,
you will go crazy.

1126
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:04,750
You'll,
you will,

1127
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,550
you'll have podcasts.
Scared,

1128
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:11,740
scared to dive deep into this fucking
guy's poor guy's life.

1129
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,640
It's crazy.
It's unbelievable.

1130
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,700
Amen.
Police officers or people.

1131
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:18,190
That's it.
There's going to be real good ones and

1132
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:19,510
bad ones.
There's no,

1133
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,240
no doubt about it.
And just because you get through the

1134
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,330
fucking academy tasks and get into the,
uh,

1135
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:27,940
the position,
that doesn't mean you've got your shit

1136
00:51:27,941 --> 00:51:30,670
together or you're worthy.
It just means you didn't fuck up yet.

1137
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:33,400
And just because you're a cop doesn't
mean you're a bad person.

1138
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:34,900
There's a lot of cops that are fucking
awesome,

1139
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:37,530
they're great people,
and that's a job that they think is

1140
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,600
important.
It's a job that they think is very

1141
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:44,650
beneficial to our society and they do it
the best they can and those people are

1142
00:51:44,651 --> 00:51:46,810
important.
Those people were the ones that get

1143
00:51:46,811 --> 00:51:50,880
overlooked and when you see terrible
cops doing terrible things terrible.

1144
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:52,720
When you see terrible people doing
terrible things,

1145
00:51:52,721 --> 00:51:54,610
do you give up on people?
Do you say,

1146
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,660
fuck man,
I hate people.

1147
00:51:55,661 --> 00:51:57,610
Now.
Some guy just stomped a kitten to death

1148
00:51:57,611 --> 00:51:59,890
on a youtube video.
I hate people.

1149
00:51:59,891 --> 00:52:00,760
I hate people.
I can't.

1150
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,590
I fucking.
I don't want to talk to anybody anymore.

1151
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,920
That's ridiculous because most of us
would never do that and I think that's

1152
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:08,860
the same thing with cops.
There's a lot of fucking cops and

1153
00:52:08,861 --> 00:52:11,420
they're dealing with a lot of
interactions every day,

1154
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,900
every day,
all day long.

1155
00:52:13,901 --> 00:52:15,760
You're dealing with people stealing
things,

1156
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,810
people doing things to people and people
who might do things to you and they're

1157
00:52:19,811 --> 00:52:22,330
fucking.
They're just overwhelmed with stress all

1158
00:52:22,331 --> 00:52:22,960
the time.

1159
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,290
Especially now that the media is coming
hard.

1160
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,320
God Bad.
I just spent a couple of days on a top

1161
00:52:29,321 --> 00:52:32,240
secret project,
but with cops and uh,

1162
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,380
it is,
I learned so much.

1163
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:38,830
You learn a lot immediately about the
current perception,

1164
00:52:38,831 --> 00:52:39,610
like,
you know,

1165
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:41,100
they're very,
you know,

1166
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,800
defensive and it's,
it's incredible to watch.

1167
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,500
But like,
so it got me more into like I've been

1168
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:50,440
watching a lot of these police shootings
and things.

1169
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,690
There's not many where,
you know,

1170
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:56,620
if you're going for a gun or if you have
your hand in your pocket and they're

1171
00:52:56,621 --> 00:52:58,510
like,
take your hand out of your pocket,

1172
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,820
you have to take your hand out of your
pocket.

1173
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,160
I don't,
I don't have any sympathy for anyone who

1174
00:53:03,161 --> 00:53:04,720
doesn't do that immediately.
And I get it.

1175
00:53:04,721 --> 00:53:08,500
There's like mental health issues and
stuff and I think that's the exception

1176
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:09,660
to it.
And yeah,

1177
00:53:09,661 --> 00:53:11,380
sometimes it's totally,
like you said,

1178
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:14,290
incident to incident,
but the media really,

1179
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,990
really messed up the cops.
Man.

1180
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,010
Everybody's on edge with them right now.

1181
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:22,290
Well,
how can you see the media mess them up

1182
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:26,340
when there's all these videos of cops
shooting people for no doing terrible

1183
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,420
shit.
Like planting evidence that God throws

1184
00:53:28,421 --> 00:53:31,680
the Taser down when he shoots that guy
who's running away from them.

1185
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:36,710
There's a lot of really hardcore video
evidence of cops doing terrible things.

1186
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,240
I think they just have to look at it in
a balanced perspective.

1187
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:41,520
The media is not doing anything wrong by
reporting these things.

1188
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:45,000
They're making those cops accountable,
but I think what we have to be really

1189
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:47,430
careful as blaming all cops.
Exactly,

1190
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:51,330
and that's where it's fun to fats were
like the media makes it a little bit

1191
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:55,800
blander than just the specific guy that
they use the word police instead of

1192
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,090
officer Blah Blah Blah.
Well,

1193
00:53:57,091 --> 00:53:57,980
how about this?
Like if you.

1194
00:53:57,981 --> 00:54:01,710
If you saw something and you saw a cop
like on a youtube video,

1195
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:04,350
do something.
You did something terrible.

1196
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,630
When you see another cop,
that guy,

1197
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,690
you're not in the same city.
You don't even know this guy.

1198
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,850
This guy is just a person.
You don't.

1199
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:15,420
You don't make him responsible for
something that some guy did in North

1200
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,120
Carolina,
but kind of people do kind of.

1201
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:21,420
People do.
If you go and watch some youtube video

1202
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:24,660
of some cop doing some horrible shit and
the Oakland subway and then all the

1203
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,110
sudden you're in downtown La and some
cop looks at you funny like fucking pig,

1204
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,450
you know,
like you hate that guy because of

1205
00:54:30,451 --> 00:54:33,870
something that someone else did that's
in his organization that he most likely

1206
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:36,510
has never met in his life.
Imagine if we did that with people.

1207
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:40,950
Imagine if some person did something
fucked up in New York and you're down in

1208
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:43,130
Florida and you're like,
fucking piece of shit and this guy's

1209
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,160
like,
what are you talking about?

1210
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:45,180
I know what you are,
man.

1211
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,560
You're a fucking person.
You're a regular dude.

1212
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,300
The deq and you.

1213
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,640
I know what that guy did in New York and
you're just like him.

1214
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:52,520
Like was one cop told me,
you know,

1215
00:54:52,521 --> 00:54:56,490
like a kid ran up to him the other day,
like he's walking down a sidewalk or

1216
00:54:56,510 --> 00:55:00,840
Sarah or whatever,
donut shop or somewhere and a little kid

1217
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,810
walks up and is like,
Hey,

1218
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,950
hi Mr. Officer.
Like a little like,

1219
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,220
you know,
three or four year old and some lady

1220
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:11,550
walks over and she's,
she grabs her little boy and it's like,

1221
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:15,070
no,
you stay away from these murders like

1222
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:20,090
that and had an in depth talk with this
police officer and it's like not only is

1223
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:25,170
that terrible that they're being called
a murder,

1224
00:55:25,171 --> 00:55:29,970
but imagine the feeling of knowing that
that's the next generation and that's

1225
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:31,950
the type of,
you know,

1226
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:35,220
things that they're being taught about
police officers right now.

1227
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,800
I think that there's two ways I look at
it.

1228
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,880
I think in one way I look at it that the
police are necessary and we need police

1229
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:44,970
because we have too much crime and we
have too much violence and it's just,

1230
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:50,160
it's the way it is now.
It's like there are shield that protects

1231
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:54,270
us from bad people,
but another part of me looks at it and

1232
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:59,271
says that
the dynamic of a person in control with

1233
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:04,580
ultimate lethal power and then everyone
else around them is a bad dynamic.

1234
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,220
It's not an.
It's the dynamic in and of itself can

1235
00:56:08,221 --> 00:56:12,600
create conflict because there's always
going to be resistance to this idea of

1236
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:17,601
someone who lives amongst you who has
ultimate power over you and who.

1237
00:56:18,151 --> 00:56:22,710
If the chips go down the wrong way,
they might shoot you and kill you and

1238
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:23,710
they can away with that

1239
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,130
and they could say you attack them,
or you were reaching for something they

1240
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:30,190
thought was a gun.
Who knows what kind of personal vendetta

1241
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:33,600
that they might have against you?
Who knows what kind of stress that they

1242
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,110
might have been under when they pulled
the trigger,

1243
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:38,800
but they could do to you.
They're allowed to have a gun on them

1244
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,600
and you you can't.
Even.

1245
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:42,880
If you're a guy who's never done
anything wrong and you're walking

1246
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:44,440
around,
you're going to feel weird around cops

1247
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,960
like you.
You'll maybe you respect them

1248
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,310
intellectually.
You'll say,

1249
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,620
thank you for your service.
I appreciate everything you guys are

1250
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:51,670
doing.
Stay safe,

1251
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,750
but in the back of your head you fucking
know that if things got ugly,

1252
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:59,110
they could shoot you.
Like if somehow or another you got in an

1253
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,930
altercation with them,
you,

1254
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,460
you,
you go towards them and you're in

1255
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:06,160
somehow or another way threatening or
physical,

1256
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,680
they'll gun you down.
You know the gun,

1257
00:57:08,681 --> 00:57:10,650
your dog down.
If your dog starts running at them at

1258
00:57:10,651 --> 00:57:13,300
barking,
we've seen videos of that adrenaline

1259
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,210
and that really just puts a blanket on
your head that's like when you say,

1260
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,730
when people say,
get your hand out of your pocket,

1261
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:21,980
man,
that guy's adrenaline's overtaken his

1262
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:24,010
body to the point he doesn't understand
words.

1263
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,250
Man,
I got robbed.

1264
00:57:25,251 --> 00:57:27,170
I had no idea what was going on.
Exactly.

1265
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,333
Exactly.

1266
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:30,430
That's a real good point.
Really good point.

1267
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:33,680
As far as the people they pull over when
you get a

1268
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:34,980
dude,
I got to the.

1269
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,340
Yeah,
and I,

1270
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:39,320
I feel like I'm shady when the cop comes
up and I was like,

1271
00:57:39,321 --> 00:57:41,080
nothing even going.
You know what I mean?

1272
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,560
I'm just like,
no.

1273
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:45,140
And then all of a sudden I'll be like
turning down the radio and they're like,

1274
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,940
take your hand out of the middle of
there,

1275
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:47,930
put your hand on the car.
I'm like,

1276
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:50,390
Oh God.
Then I cans go up.

1277
00:57:50,391 --> 00:57:52,970
You know what I mean?
Instead of I said the steering wheel,

1278
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:53,690
you know,
and it's like,

1279
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:56,760
I haven't even seen this guy yet.
And I'm the.

1280
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:58,130
It is.
It's really.

1281
00:57:58,131 --> 00:57:59,600
It just takes over everything.

1282
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,180
Yeah.
And imagine you know,

1283
00:58:01,181 --> 00:58:03,490
you,
you pull someone over and there's some

1284
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:07,000
brock lesnar looking motherfucker
sitting in the driver's seat and he

1285
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:08,860
doesn't want to make eye contact for you
and says,

1286
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:10,180
what did I do wrong?
Officer?

1287
00:58:10,181 --> 00:58:11,790
And you're like,
oh shit.

1288
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:13,390
Yeah.
Oh Jesus.

1289
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,330
You know,
if this guy gets out of the truck,

1290
00:58:16,331 --> 00:58:18,340
he's just going to literally rip you to
pieces.

1291
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:21,040
Or he might pull out a machine gun under
his car seat.

1292
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:22,930
Start gunning you down.
Who knows?

1293
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,000
Who knows when you're pulling some guy
over,

1294
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,250
you don't know if he's got a body in the
trunk.

1295
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,850
You don't know if he's got 100 kilos of
cocaine in his spare tire.

1296
00:58:30,851 --> 00:58:33,150
You don't know shit.
How much is the home?

1297
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,810
That seemed like a lot.
One hundred kilos,

1298
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:39,820
but 220 pounds or something like that.
Two hundred 22 kilos of acid paper

1299
00:58:40,841 --> 00:58:41,890
asset.
Oh my God,

1300
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:44,860
that's enough acid to kill the world.
Right.

1301
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:47,350
But you don't know.
Maybe you pull somebody over.

1302
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:49,060
Even a woman,
she could be some crazy bitch.

1303
00:58:49,061 --> 00:58:52,010
You just got done killing her entire
family and he's.

1304
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:53,800
She's driving her mom's house to kill
her too.

1305
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:58,010
Did you see the video that was released
like two days ago from Boston?

1306
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:03,040
Have a guy recording his ex girlfriend
just breaking his windows,

1307
00:59:03,471 --> 00:59:05,960
scratching his car.
Then he goes outside.

1308
00:59:05,961 --> 00:59:06,710
You'd be like,
look,

1309
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,490
look what she did.
She like crushed my bumper and then have

1310
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:13,340
nowhere.
She just comes from behind going like 50

1311
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:16,460
miles an hour and hits him.
Know he misses just by an inch,

1312
00:59:16,461 --> 00:59:20,900
but it hit his car and if Jamie could
pull up that video you will freak.

1313
00:59:20,901 --> 00:59:22,310
I mean the,
the anger,

1314
00:59:22,311 --> 00:59:26,720
this crazy woman and that right there,
she's supposedly has already gone to

1315
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:30,590
court twice and said that he has hit her
and done all this shit.

1316
00:59:30,591 --> 00:59:32,330
But just watching this video go,
oh no,

1317
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,220
look at this poor guy.
What he's dealing with.

1318
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,950
That guy needs to get one of those.
That guy needs to get one of those

1319
00:59:36,951 --> 00:59:37,880
sperms switches.

1320
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:42,150
Make sure you
and you will wind up fucking her again.

1321
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:44,600
She's that crazy.
You know what kind of pussy she must be

1322
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:48,080
thrown around.
Just fucking illiquid thunder.

1323
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,690
She wants.
She's been wrecking that dude.

1324
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,550
Oh yeah.
God.

1325
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:53,211
And He.
Yeah,

1326
00:59:53,211 --> 00:59:55,240
he couldn't leave his house and just had
to.

1327
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,710
He was like kid,
like it was scary being in that

1328
00:59:57,711 --> 01:00:00,530
situation because she seemed like she
would pull out a gun and just start

1329
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:02,990
shooting them or what.
Anybody tries to hit you with a car,

1330
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:03,920
right?
That's,

1331
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:07,640
you might as well be shooting at me
trying to hit someone with a car that's

1332
01:00:07,641 --> 01:00:08,590
death.
Oh yeah.

1333
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:09,890
Tim,
let's give some volume.

1334
01:00:09,891 --> 01:00:12,830
Young champions.
This is what he's showing what she did.

1335
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:17,910
So you just keep this out of my car.
I actually just got painted over because

1336
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,650
I was lousy guess.
Jeez God.

1337
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,660
Oh my God.

1338
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:27,780
He's got a Mercedes.

1339
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,180
And what does he have?
A Honda,

1340
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,190
which she tried to hit him.

1341
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:35,040
What could she just tried to hit him
with the car and then if you saw the

1342
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:36,260
beginning of it,
she is outside.

1343
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:37,940
Just smashing windows and stuff.
But dude,

1344
01:00:37,941 --> 01:00:40,000
he didn't even know she was coming.
No,

1345
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,230
he wasn't even looking and she almost
killed him.

1346
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:44,450
She's coming.
She's coming back.

1347
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,633
No Way.

1348
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,210
Oh my God.
My vehicle into my neighbor's vehicle.

1349
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:53,890
This is crazy.
Back that ass up.

1350
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,640
Who wrote who?
What is she going to do

1351
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,450
going inside because I want to avoid any
further if she rammed.

1352
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:05,540
Okay.
I think she's gonna Finish her Mercedes

1353
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:07,550
into his Honda.
She's finishing up on the car.

1354
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,313
How you treat me,
right?

1355
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,560
Oh my God.
She's coming out with a crowbar and

1356
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:15,301
broke his back.
No,

1357
01:01:15,301 --> 01:01:17,160
she has just smashed my window.

1358
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:22,730
My rear windshield.
Oh my God.

1359
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,490
Yeah.
And at the beginning he,

1360
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:33,180
she broke windows in his house and he's
in the house like she's breaking my

1361
01:01:33,181 --> 01:01:35,220
windows in my house now.
A whoa.

1362
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,700
It's a freaking video.
Does that make your blood pressure go

1363
01:01:38,701 --> 01:01:41,460
up?
Jesus crying when she got out of her car

1364
01:01:41,461 --> 01:01:42,510
with the Crowbar.
I was like,

1365
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:45,000
Oh shit,
this just got real as fuck.

1366
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,470
That's how people does.
She got him.

1367
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,930
She got him arrested earlier,
like previous because she was at her

1368
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,370
brother's house or something and she
just said like he was beating her up and

1369
01:01:53,371 --> 01:01:54,750
the cops came and arrested him.
Yeah,

1370
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,630
it's been tormenting him for a long
time.

1371
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:02,660
I hope that does advocate too.
What if she's telling the truth and he

1372
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:07,320
was beaten and robbed and she's like,
enough of this punk ass mother fucker.

1373
01:02:07,321 --> 01:02:08,640
I'm going over his house with a crow
bar.

1374
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,650
I'm going to run this bitch over with a
fucking truck.

1375
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:12,000
Right.
And fun fact,

1376
01:02:12,001 --> 01:02:14,460
if you google her name Jamie or his
name,

1377
01:02:14,461 --> 01:02:17,940
I don't know if you can find this,
but they actually were a rap duo and

1378
01:02:17,941 --> 01:02:19,080
they have rap videos.

1379
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:24,510
Oh my God,
what have you done?

1380
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,520
What spiral have you let us down?
I hope you at least did something good.

1381
01:02:29,521 --> 01:02:32,550
You know what I mean?
Like banged a supermodel or something

1382
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,550
because you know it.
I'd be really disappointed to find out

1383
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:39,150
that like he left her with a bill,
like red lobster or something like that.

1384
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,330
She was furious.
Yeah.

1385
01:02:42,331 --> 01:02:45,840
What could have possibly been that bad
that she wanted to kill him with a car?

1386
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,230
Well,
to ram a Mercedes into his Honda is

1387
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:50,011
like,
you know,

1388
01:02:50,011 --> 01:02:53,130
it's like throwing fucking money at
somebody's face.

1389
01:02:53,131 --> 01:02:54,810
Like you piece of shit.
I hate you.

1390
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:59,310
That's a pump moved though.
That's a pumped up move that is pumped

1391
01:02:59,311 --> 01:03:01,010
up.
Fucking throwing money in someone's head

1392
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:02,880
off.
Fuck.

1393
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,820
Didn't someone did someone did that to
like two P diddy.

1394
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:08,400
It was like a story and some article
about,

1395
01:03:08,401 --> 01:03:10,350
uh,
some violence that had broken out in

1396
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:11,010
this club.

1397
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:15,390
People getting shot because some guys
showed up at one of these things,

1398
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:17,700
you know,
p diddy's famous for going to these

1399
01:03:17,701 --> 01:03:21,530
clubs and he'd have the velvet rope and
all this money and all those bottles.

1400
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,450
That was his whole thing.
His whole thing was flossing and some

1401
01:03:24,451 --> 01:03:27,540
guy came up to him and like through $100
bills in his face.

1402
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:28,800
Oh,
that had to hurt.

1403
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:31,970
I bet.
I bet one of his eyes got puffy and then

1404
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:36,000
puff daddy joke right there.
That's maybe when it became diddy didn't

1405
01:03:36,001 --> 01:03:40,140
like coffee and maybe that was.
Maybe they corresponded.

1406
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:43,020
Yeah.
Depends.

1407
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,750
Yeah,
but something happened and that was a.

1408
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,490
I think somebody gets shot that
incident,

1409
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:49,350
right?
Didn't tell him to get shot or trampled

1410
01:03:49,351 --> 01:03:51,990
or something like that.
I'm pretty sure I'm trying to look it up

1411
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:54,480
right now.
I think Chris Brown was involved and

1412
01:03:54,481 --> 01:03:56,830
there was something about a bottle
getting broken in someone's eyes.

1413
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:57,840
Oh,
that's a different one.

1414
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,010
I think that's a different one.
No,

1415
01:03:59,011 --> 01:04:00,360
that's a different one.
That's a recent one.

1416
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,640
The P diddy one.
He might even been puff.

1417
01:04:02,641 --> 01:04:05,850
Daddy was in New York.
That other one was out here,

1418
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:10,650
but I mean I'm sure there's been a lot
of incidents with drake at a club to p

1419
01:04:10,651 --> 01:04:13,350
diddy.
Who One please tell me drake.

1420
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:15,600
I don't know.
It was over a girl.

1421
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:18,030
Oh Man.
Fighting over chicks.

1422
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:21,330
I just sent you the video.
The music video of the two people.

1423
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:24,240
Jamie,
throwing money in a guy's face is a

1424
01:04:24,241 --> 01:04:25,190
real.
I mean,

1425
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:28,320
that's like the ultimate,
like hitting a man with a glove or

1426
01:04:28,321 --> 01:04:29,820
whatever,
like starting at dual.

1427
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:31,890
It's,
that's the energy that he's put out to

1428
01:04:31,891 --> 01:04:34,830
the world.
It's perfect because like if you see P

1429
01:04:34,831 --> 01:04:39,630
diddy walking down the beach with a dude
who's holding an umbrella over his head,

1430
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:40,950
I was seeing that.

1431
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:42,150
No,
you haven't seen that.

1432
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:46,020
He has a man.
Servant Servant will follow him around

1433
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:47,970
with an umbrella.
Oh my God.

1434
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:49,140
Oh yes.
Here we go.

1435
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:53,830
Jamie,
his name was barnes the apparently

1436
01:04:53,831 --> 01:04:55,400
that's amazing.
He's a,

1437
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:58,140
he's a character in a spiderman comic
book.

1438
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:00,570
Bonds with.
Can I have my unparallel please?

1439
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:04,410
I mean if for p dot diddy was like some
diabolical.

1440
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,880
Look at this.
He's got a guy following him around with

1441
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:10,490
an umbrella.
Oh my.

1442
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:14,280
The gentleman has a bow tie on.
Why wouldn't you have a girl do that?

1443
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:17,230
You know,
like if I win the powerball I'll have

1444
01:05:17,231 --> 01:05:18,010
that.
But a girl

1445
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,960
and she has to wear a bikini.
I don't know man.

1446
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:25,150
Well it's a weird position,
but maybe it's a really good gig.

1447
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,200
Like maybe he just gets to jet all over
the world and wear bow ties and just

1448
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:32,290
allowing us to hold an umbrella.
How fucking hard is that in a fake

1449
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:34,750
world?
What if p diddy liked guys and that was

1450
01:05:34,751 --> 01:05:37,960
a way to have his boyfriend always with
him in a fake world,

1451
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:43,270
a thinly veiled
Farnsworth.

1452
01:05:45,101 --> 01:05:49,150
Bentley attends the 2003 MTV music video
was

1453
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:54,490
gotten to work and hanging out with
snoop dog quite a bit and he has an

1454
01:05:56,260 --> 01:06:01,260
Asian guy who his only job and he's the
best at it is rolling blunts and he just

1455
01:06:04,781 --> 01:06:08,830
rolls blunts and he's just the best
blunt roller and it just comes up and

1456
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:09,281
it's like,
Hey,

1457
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:10,210
this is,
you know,

1458
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:11,860
I don't remember his name exactly,
but it's like,

1459
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:15,070
this is bubba.
He's the blonde girl or guy and he just.

1460
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:17,360
And when you hit it,
it just is like you.

1461
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,810
It's like our rate laser coming at you.
You know how the end of A.

1462
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:24,550
Anything Cherries up.
It's always even,

1463
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:27,390
it's like perfect.
Like it does it with his hands.

1464
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,170
Yeah,
like a science.

1465
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,400
Like he really like really like Cubans
massages that you could tell that he

1466
01:06:33,401 --> 01:06:35,710
really takes his time.
Very adhesive,

1467
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:38,800
perfect cylinder,
Tam hand rolled.

1468
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:41,290
You can almost tell that it was just
rolled.

1469
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,570
There's no substitute for quality and
craftsmanship.

1470
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:44,730
It's true.
And you know,

1471
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:45,720
I understand it.
Yeah.

1472
01:06:45,721 --> 01:06:49,600
You're snoop Dogg,
you smoke blunts all day continuously

1473
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,750
and he does like,
you know,

1474
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,340
you see all the,
all these different celebrities of their

1475
01:06:54,341 --> 01:06:55,360
things and you're like,
oh,

1476
01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:57,910
I bet he doesn't.
He doesn't really like that offstage.

1477
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:01,600
Like snoop just,
he's unbelievably hilarious when it

1478
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:02,920
comes to smoking.

1479
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:05,510
Yeah.
You would think that the balance of

1480
01:07:05,511 --> 01:07:08,810
wonder what kind of paper they using,
are they using like legit blunt,

1481
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:13,640
which is what a blunt is for folks who
are not aware is they take a cigarette,

1482
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:18,200
um,
or rather a cigar and take the tobacco

1483
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,960
out and then put weed in and roll it up
together.

1484
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:25,280
And I never had one until I hung out
with Charlie Murphy and his cousin rich.

1485
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:29,230
They find daughter Lauder,
first of all,

1486
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,280
because you're breathing in the tobacco
smoke,

1487
01:07:31,281 --> 01:07:33,980
which is an added element in it.
It does something,

1488
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,610
it opens up your capillaries in your
lungs,

1489
01:07:36,611 --> 01:07:38,770
that the tea more thc gets in your
blood.

1490
01:07:38,771 --> 01:07:38,930
It

1491
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,420
also has an effect of its own.
You know,

1492
01:07:41,421 --> 01:07:45,380
the nicotine in the tobacco leaf.
It has an effect of its own and it's

1493
01:07:45,381 --> 01:07:49,130
also unusual in the fact that that
tobacco leaf is generally not inhaled

1494
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,520
you.
When you smoke tobacco a cigar,

1495
01:07:52,521 --> 01:07:56,780
you puff it,
but you don't take the big deep inhaling

1496
01:07:57,350 --> 01:08:01,310
like long filling breaths that you do
when you smoke weed.

1497
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:04,580
So if you smoke a blunt,
really kind of the only time you're

1498
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:07,430
breathing that smoke in and it's a
serious irritant,

1499
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,320
I,
I think that's real unhealthy for you to

1500
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:14,570
smoke those tobacco leaves all the way
down.

1501
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,080
Right?
I think you can't do that every day.

1502
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,550
That's why.
That's why the Geno's little that

1503
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:25,190
electronic cigarette blind that tastes
great and you don't have to get the

1504
01:08:25,191 --> 01:08:26,450
nicotine part of,
you know,

1505
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,750
Geno's the shit at La speed weed.
He knows what he's doing.

1506
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:31,520
Man.
He got pulled down from instagram was

1507
01:08:31,521 --> 01:08:35,570
then hilariously instagram deleted his
account or suspended as account or

1508
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:39,910
whatever the hell they did because he's
a weed related like Geez,

1509
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,820
operating within the California laws,
he's selling something to everybody

1510
01:08:43,821 --> 01:08:47,330
loves how come you have all these wind
companies that have instagram accounts

1511
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,670
and all these beer companies,
which I like wine.

1512
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:51,390
I like beer.
We all do well.

1513
01:08:51,391 --> 01:08:52,790
Why?
What's wrong with weed?

1514
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:53,420
Well,
you know,

1515
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:56,720
services like the greatest thing ever,
by the way he should get back at

1516
01:08:56,721 --> 01:09:01,721
instagram by making a promo that's like
they instagram special were like,

1517
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,010
you get a gram of pot,
like within 10 minutes,

1518
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,560
some type of crazy promotion where it's
like,

1519
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:09,300
hey,
did you hear about the instagram thing?

1520
01:09:09,301 --> 01:09:11,820
Just use them as a marketing thing.
Yeah.

1521
01:09:11,821 --> 01:09:13,740
That's funny.
Instagrams bitches,

1522
01:09:13,741 --> 01:09:14,560
man.
I can't believe that.

1523
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,620
It's great.
It's to.

1524
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,010
It's just a.
they're a company.

1525
01:09:17,011 --> 01:09:18,510
They're trying to fucking make some
money.

1526
01:09:18,511 --> 01:09:20,880
I get it.
How is it though that twitter,

1527
01:09:20,881 --> 01:09:23,790
you're allowed to see both holes,
but instagram you can't even see

1528
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:24,840
nipples,
you know,

1529
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,880
like twitter because of the fact that
you can see all that stuff.

1530
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:33,690
There's like a more,
maybe more of a limit in as far as her

1531
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:38,130
kind of as they'll get.
Whereas maybe instagram because they've

1532
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,300
been proactive in censoring people's
material,

1533
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:45,090
censoring the images and stuff that
you're allowed to put up,

1534
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:46,860
you know,
maybe there'll be an.

1535
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:49,260
They could sell more of those sponsored
instagram ads.

1536
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:51,300
That way they have a lot of those
sponsored ads.

1537
01:09:51,301 --> 01:09:52,710
Yeah.
You see them all the time now in your

1538
01:09:52,711 --> 01:09:55,260
feed.
You can have a problem with it.

1539
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:58,230
You get shipped potholes on twitter.
You can do whatever you want onto think

1540
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:02,640
sponsored ads on instagram are probably
the least offensive ads ever because

1541
01:10:02,641 --> 01:10:05,850
they take a fucking half of a second to
go through.

1542
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,190
I agree.
Whereas in the ad on TV is the most

1543
01:10:08,191 --> 01:10:10,680
offensive.
You're watching the walking dead and

1544
01:10:10,681 --> 01:10:14,350
they're about to get jack by zombies and
it fucking fades to black and it's,

1545
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:18,120
don't you want your car to shine light
new

1546
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:26,570
believeable fuckers.
You fuckers have ruined the entire mood

1547
01:10:26,671 --> 01:10:31,440
of this awesome show to sell me a some
wax or whatever the fuck yourself.

1548
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:34,260
Yeah.
The artist took time to set a tone and

1549
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:36,990
feel so much better if you watch it on
itunes.

1550
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:40,840
Crazy to me,
like I remember when we were making the

1551
01:10:40,841 --> 01:10:41,460
show,
uh,

1552
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,980
that burn a couple of years ago on
comedy central,

1553
01:10:43,981 --> 01:10:48,130
Jeff Ross show and I wrote and produced
it and uh,

1554
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:49,370
you know,
you've,

1555
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,840
I've,
it was the only show that I ever watched

1556
01:10:51,841 --> 01:10:56,220
on tv because I was always doing standup
and stuff and I didn't even have a TV,

1557
01:10:56,221 --> 01:10:58,080
you know,
that's back like this is like four or

1558
01:10:58,081 --> 01:11:00,410
five years ago anyway.
Uh,

1559
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:05,250
but every after every day going into
every commercial break during this

1560
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:09,210
comedy show that's at 10:30 at night,
it was always a life alert commercial,

1561
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,980
like straight into like,
I've fallen and I'm,

1562
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:13,800
I need help.
I'm here.

1563
01:11:13,801 --> 01:11:16,710
You know what I mean?
Like who's going to save your grandma if

1564
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:18,480
you don't have life alert?
And it's like,

1565
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:21,750
then it's like now back to your comedy
experience.

1566
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,360
Yeah.
It's like the worst type of stuff.

1567
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,830
Well,
we all know that from doing standup or

1568
01:11:27,831 --> 01:11:29,480
from going to the movies,
you don't.

1569
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,300
If a movie got interrupted every 15
minutes for commercial,

1570
01:11:32,301 --> 01:11:35,150
you know how fucking pissed you would be
at the end of that movie.

1571
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:40,100
The problem with network television is
the model they're using where you

1572
01:11:40,101 --> 01:11:42,950
interrupt shows and show these
commercials.

1573
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,920
It sucks.
It sucks and you're stuck with it.

1574
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:50,720
You got to figure out a whole new way to
show ads because people are done.

1575
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:52,730
And so the idea was,
well,

1576
01:11:52,731 --> 01:11:55,640
we'll just make ads more interesting.
We'll just make ads more creative.

1577
01:11:55,641 --> 01:11:58,790
And they did that to a certain extent,
but they still suck.

1578
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,610
Nobody wants to see him.
He did.

1579
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:04,250
Even if it's the most awesome ad ever,
it's interrupting whether or not fucking

1580
01:12:04,251 --> 01:12:05,900
Rick is going to get jacked by the
zombies.

1581
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:07,550
Right?
Right.

1582
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,520
And that's their cable that's even more
fucked up.

1583
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:13,070
He's like AMC and uh,
you know,

1584
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:17,210
the independent film channel,
IFC and all these different channels or

1585
01:12:17,211 --> 01:12:18,860
cable,
they can do whatever they want,

1586
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,450
like they have to,
they have to censor themselves to ensure

1587
01:12:23,451 --> 01:12:27,890
that they get the right ads.
So they self sensor just to get ads.

1588
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,530
It's not like the ABC,
CBS,

1589
01:12:30,531 --> 01:12:33,410
NBC,
those are governed by the FCC.

1590
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:36,890
And so when,
when you're on television,

1591
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,500
you're not allowed to swear.
You're not allowed to.

1592
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,970
Like there's,
there's a law,

1593
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:44,660
but on cable there's no fucking laws.
That's why they say shit.

1594
01:12:44,661 --> 01:12:49,610
Now Llc c asshole leads a lot of shows.
They get real close to st fuck you.

1595
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:53,780
But they don't really say fuck you.
But they get real close and it's because

1596
01:12:53,781 --> 01:12:55,550
they're on cable.
The only reason why they don't do

1597
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,790
everything full nudity do ever do they
want is ads.

1598
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,670
That's it.
That's why hbo gets away with just going

1599
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:06,920
buck wild no ads,
but to try getting people to pay for

1600
01:13:06,921 --> 01:13:09,590
shit today.
Like if they don't produce things like

1601
01:13:09,591 --> 01:13:13,160
game of thrones,
if they don't have like specials like

1602
01:13:13,161 --> 01:13:15,680
Whitney Cummings special.
They don't have like a lot of original

1603
01:13:15,681 --> 01:13:17,930
content,
Amy Schumer's last special,

1604
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:21,200
a lot of original content where people
are going to seek it out specifically,

1605
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:24,920
but big time fights whenever they have a
big time fights on Hbo.

1606
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,370
If it's not that it's hard getting
people to pay today.

1607
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:29,230
Yeah,

1608
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:30,670
it really is.
I mean,

1609
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:35,700
but at the same time it sort of isn't
like I feel like it's hard for like the

1610
01:13:36,641 --> 01:13:39,610
middle of the country I think is making
the transition now,

1611
01:13:39,611 --> 01:13:44,611
but Netflix is up to over $75 million
subscribers or something like that.

1612
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:49,810
It's going up by millions and HBO is I
think at like 25 million households

1613
01:13:52,151 --> 01:13:54,940
right now.
So it's nuts.

1614
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,930
I mean I,
I personally I run completely off of.

1615
01:13:58,931 --> 01:14:03,490
I have netflix and I have hbo go and
that is yet like if there's a sporting

1616
01:14:03,491 --> 01:14:06,100
event on the TV then I have to go to a
local,

1617
01:14:06,101 --> 01:14:09,100
you know,
bar or something or restaurant to check

1618
01:14:09,101 --> 01:14:11,080
it out.
That's just how I roll.

1619
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:13,750
You just don't want cable or satellite
or anything like that,

1620
01:14:13,751 --> 01:14:14,584
you know,
young.

1621
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,290
I don't ever use it.
The only thing that might come on,

1622
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:20,770
it's like a college football game or the
UFC or something like that.

1623
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,960
You,
but you got the UFC pass now like I,

1624
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:25,570
I mean I cut the cable bill.
I haven't looked back at all,

1625
01:14:25,571 --> 01:14:27,100
you know,
with Hulu plus.

1626
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,830
And you have the UFC app where it's
just,

1627
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:32,140
that's all you need.
A lot of people go in that direction.

1628
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:34,390
No,
that's what they think the future is.

1629
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,040
They think the future is not going to be
television,

1630
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:41,340
especially now that TV's hookup to a
Hcmi cables that hookup to computers

1631
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:44,440
right away and a lot of tvs and not
getting online,

1632
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:47,110
like a lot of tvs out of the box of
online ability.

1633
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:48,970
And so they act as a small computer.

1634
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:52,570
So you'll just be able to go straight.
I like my tv by itself.

1635
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:56,380
Go straight to youtube.
I can go to youtube like what the fuck?

1636
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:59,830
Like you through Itunes,
you do everything.

1637
01:14:59,831 --> 01:15:01,900
Itunes connect you to Netflix,
apple,

1638
01:15:01,901 --> 01:15:04,420
uh,
apple TV connects you to Netflix.

1639
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,640
Did you get the new one yet?
I tell you that's worth the upgrade.

1640
01:15:06,641 --> 01:15:11,080
It's one of my favorite things ever.
Just being able to go a Steve Martin and

1641
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:13,780
it pulls up every single Steve Martin
who they talked to him.

1642
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:14,614
Yeah.
You just tell it,

1643
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:18,350
so you're like a walking dead and then
you click on walking down.

1644
01:15:18,351 --> 01:15:22,240
It says available on Hulu or itunes or
Netflix and it just takes you right

1645
01:15:22,241 --> 01:15:23,630
there.
So googling.

1646
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:26,230
Yeah,
that's what puff daddy as barns worth.

1647
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:30,340
Do something walking dead worth.
Does he?

1648
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:32,920
Does he have to massage his feet at the
end of a long day?

1649
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:36,010
I totally get the lotion but okay.

1650
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:37,570
But if it's barnes,
words choice,

1651
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:40,690
particularly save barnes worth was like
living in Columbus News,

1652
01:15:40,691 --> 01:15:43,380
working at a tire factory.
That was just like.

1653
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:45,520
And then all of a sudden this guy came
into town and go,

1654
01:15:45,521 --> 01:15:47,200
dude,
I've been looking for a guy to carry my

1655
01:15:47,201 --> 01:15:48,970
umbrella.
I'll pay you a million dollars a year.

1656
01:15:49,530 --> 01:15:52,090
You've got to go with me to Paris,
France and all over the world,

1657
01:15:52,091 --> 01:15:56,050
but you'd be with me 24 hours a day and
you are at my beck and call and you must

1658
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:58,570
massage my feet the end of every night.
I'd be like,

1659
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,380
he'd be like,
I'm a millionaire and I don't work at a

1660
01:16:00,381 --> 01:16:03,400
tire factory.
Pinky in.

1661
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:04,640
I think he's out.

1662
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:07,730
Oh,
in him.

1663
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,640
He's asking for that.
No,

1664
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:13,420
I just don't understand why you want to
have a girl.

1665
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:17,280
But because he would probably start
fucking her and she would interfere in

1666
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,330
his business and you know,
if she was hot,

1667
01:16:19,331 --> 01:16:21,430
especially in they're around each other
all the time.

1668
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,400
At a certain point in time she started
complaining about not getting a new

1669
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:25,590
deck.
Like,

1670
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,411
ah,
these guys.

1671
01:16:26,411 --> 01:16:28,090
I don't know what's wrong.
I mean,

1672
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:29,800
it's just not allowed to talk and have
sex with me.

1673
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:33,080
You're going to talk to these girls.
You know,

1674
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:34,810
you're,
you're finding an acumen that you want,

1675
01:16:34,811 --> 01:16:37,120
you'd want as a robot,
you know,

1676
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,580
you want a replicant like blade runner
style,

1677
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:41,740
which we're going to have.
It's going to happen.

1678
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,600
It's 20 years away.
We're 20 years away from going over

1679
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,050
someone's house and they have a
replicant.

1680
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:50,560
You're going to go over your buddy's
house and he's going to have a Chinese

1681
01:16:50,561 --> 01:16:54,140
lady with giant ridiculous tits and a
waste.

1682
01:16:54,141 --> 01:16:58,240
That doesn't seem to be possible for the
size of her tits and ass that's out of

1683
01:16:58,241 --> 01:17:01,270
this world and she's going to be cleaned
it up and you're not going to be sure if

1684
01:17:01,271 --> 01:17:04,930
she's really not going to be like,
um,

1685
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:07,150
what's that?
Is that a person?

1686
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,160
Is this a person or is that a replicant?
And he'll pull you into

1687
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,140
the fucking kitchen and they'll explain
it to you.

1688
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:15,460
Do you think,
do you think when we get close to that,

1689
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:19,670
that they're going to first just let
them out into the world and try to fool

1690
01:17:19,671 --> 01:17:22,190
everybody to see if they can do it?
Like a Beta test?

1691
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:23,460
No,
they're too expensive,

1692
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,540
but they're tracking them.
I like hardcore.

1693
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:26,670
I think we'll.
No,

1694
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:28,470
no,
I think we'll know when they develop

1695
01:17:28,471 --> 01:17:31,290
one,
when they get one to the point where

1696
01:17:31,291 --> 01:17:34,530
it's almost like a person we're going to
know and it's going to be terrifying

1697
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:39,900
when they sit that one down on
television and we have a robot that

1698
01:17:39,901 --> 01:17:43,140
adjusts his clothes and goes,
so what would you like to know?

1699
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:45,630
You're going to go,
oh my God,

1700
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:49,720
what have we done?
Like what the fuck have we done and how

1701
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:51,660
do,
what do we know about what this thing

1702
01:17:51,661 --> 01:17:54,330
has done to protect itself?
What do we know about what this thing

1703
01:17:54,331 --> 01:17:57,630
has done to ensure that the idea is that
it has,

1704
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,290
will continue and in some other form and
the most important question,

1705
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:03,720
how do you fuck it?
Oh,

1706
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:06,930
you're gonna be able to fuck it.
Like you would a normal woman if they're

1707
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:08,610
going to be able to have artificial
skin.

1708
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:11,670
They have artificial skin that they've
already developed.

1709
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:15,690
So they've been able to develop skin in
um,

1710
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,360
in a,
like a,

1711
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:21,270
like some sort of an experiment where
they recreated a woman's bladder,

1712
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:24,210
they use stem cells and they recreated
her bladder.

1713
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:28,620
They created a new bladder and then they
put it back into her body and it acts as

1714
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:30,600
a functioning bladder like they're going
to,

1715
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,210
they're going to be able to develop
artificial skin.

1716
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:37,220
So when these are lab created skin,
when these robots that you can fuck

1717
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:42,140
become like easily accessible,
how much longer until women go extinct.

1718
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,610
How much longer until you go over your
ex's house.

1719
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:51,660
Your ex is like 60 years old.
She's dressed like the wife on three's

1720
01:18:51,661 --> 01:18:54,740
company,
the one you know with Mrs. She dress

1721
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:59,770
like Mrs. Frilly and behind her are an
army of seven foot tall black guys with

1722
01:19:01,621 --> 01:19:04,890
giant dicks and there's just stroking
their shafts all day.

1723
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:06,540
Shuts that door.
She goes,

1724
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:07,560
yeah,
I just put it over there.

1725
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:12,070
She shuts that door back to work and
they just fucking stuff or all day and

1726
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:17,110
she takes Mr Hurley's money and she
invested in these gigantic Bob Sapp

1727
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:21,690
looking mandingo warrior dudes with
giant Ebony Dicks.

1728
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:25,650
They're so she comes to the door and uh,
yeah,

1729
01:19:25,651 --> 01:19:29,310
I'll thank you Mr. ups driver and the
ups driver takes a look down the hallway

1730
01:19:29,311 --> 01:19:31,650
over her shoulder and sees all these
guys just stroking it,

1731
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:33,900
staring out the window with glowing
eyes.

1732
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:37,670
Oh yeah.
Do you think a big crazy vibrating

1733
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,230
robotics?
Oh yeah.

1734
01:19:39,231 --> 01:19:40,910
Why would they,
why wouldn't they vibrate?

1735
01:19:40,911 --> 01:19:42,530
Of course.
Punch.

1736
01:19:42,531 --> 01:19:44,820
You multiply switches on these fucking
thing.

1737
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:48,470
They whip like a whip push.
Do you think you'd have to clean the

1738
01:19:48,471 --> 01:19:51,920
comment out of it or if it would just
reuse the comfort tiers later?

1739
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:54,090
You know,
like it was that advanced where it is

1740
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:59,030
useful,
lives off come ideally stays alive,

1741
01:19:59,031 --> 01:20:01,310
so that has to constantly be trying to
turn you on.

1742
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:04,970
I sure would love a good charging this
morning from behind.

1743
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:08,130
Please put it in my palm.

1744
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,430
Oversensitive people right now will be
tuning in and going,

1745
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:15,090
I can't believe what they're saying.
I can't believe Tony Hinchcliffe is

1746
01:20:15,091 --> 01:20:19,920
saying that women would go extinct if
someone made a perfect artificial woman

1747
01:20:19,921 --> 01:20:22,500
that did everything that a man wants.
No nagging.

1748
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:26,850
Why don't you want the nagging right?
You want a real woman because all women

1749
01:20:26,851 --> 01:20:31,851
don't have a mute button badge.
You Mute and clean.

1750
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:34,680
All right,
I'll be back in a couple hours by bed.

1751
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,900
Well,
think about all the negative aspects of

1752
01:20:36,901 --> 01:20:37,590
people,
right?

1753
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:41,070
Jealousy and anger and that lady fucking
they're homicidal.

1754
01:20:41,071 --> 01:20:43,140
Rage,
smashing into that dude's car and then

1755
01:20:43,141 --> 01:20:45,990
break those windows.
Think about all this negative aspects of

1756
01:20:45,991 --> 01:20:47,100
being a person.
Now,

1757
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:50,190
think of all the positive aspects of the
great things people can do when they're

1758
01:20:50,191 --> 01:20:53,160
wonderful and they're nice and
supportive and loving and friendly and

1759
01:20:53,161 --> 01:20:56,700
caressing and affectionate and just get
rid of the bad stuff and then you have

1760
01:20:56,701 --> 01:20:57,540
this perfect person.

1761
01:20:57,570 --> 01:21:01,070
Maybe Barnes worth is a robot and we
just don't know anybody.

1762
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:03,990
Maybe P diddy.
He's just a man of the possible that

1763
01:21:03,991 --> 01:21:07,820
there's something super shady about the
guy that holds an umbrella for a living.

1764
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:10,500
They've always existed though.
I mean,

1765
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:13,710
that's the Butler and fucking Batman.
He never wants to kick ass.

1766
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:14,820
He never is like,
look,

1767
01:21:14,821 --> 01:21:16,200
I'm tired of this bullshit,
dude.

1768
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:18,330
You leave me.
You get all this fucking press.

1769
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:20,340
You're out there kicking ass.
Nobody even knows me.

1770
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:21,990
I'm down here and vent and shit.
No,

1771
01:21:21,991 --> 01:21:24,150
he doesn't care.
I wonder if there's always been that

1772
01:21:24,151 --> 01:21:24,984
guy.
Yeah,

1773
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,090
right.
There's always been the man servant role

1774
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:28,740
and those,
those television shows.

1775
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:31,860
I wonder if anybody's ever gone to p
diddy's house and accidentally left the

1776
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:36,861
door open and Barnes was born in a barn.
Worth be a great law.

1777
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:39,420
You son of a bitch.

1778
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:41,310
I mean,
if you're only

1779
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:44,490
winning roads,
butlers,

1780
01:21:44,491 --> 01:21:46,860
or a weird thing,
right on man standing there with a

1781
01:21:46,861 --> 01:21:49,620
little white towel over his arm with his
hand,

1782
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:53,550
like upright in a very correct and
proper posture.

1783
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:54,413
Good day,
sir.

1784
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:57,450
May I help you?
So like someone falling around,

1785
01:21:57,451 --> 01:22:00,120
getting things Barton's worth,
please fix me a drink.

1786
01:22:00,121 --> 01:22:04,140
Scotch,
two cubes of ice and a turn the music up

1787
01:22:04,141 --> 01:22:09,141
very low and please close the door when
you leave right away.

1788
01:22:09,361 --> 01:22:14,210
So come in and take care of you.
Imagine getting a woman rattled in

1789
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:19,220
better managing.
Also like switching of roles would have

1790
01:22:20,521 --> 01:22:24,120
like you with a really,
really wealthy guy and you had you had

1791
01:22:24,121 --> 01:22:27,030
yourself,
a barnes worth and barnes worth did a

1792
01:22:27,031 --> 01:22:29,850
wonderful job,
but bonds with had ambitions of his own

1793
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:33,270
and barnes worth left and he left to
start his own business and that business

1794
01:22:33,271 --> 01:22:35,880
was ultimately a gigantic success.
Boy,

1795
01:22:35,881 --> 01:22:39,360
it took off,
but your business or the internet came

1796
01:22:39,361 --> 01:22:43,920
along and got it and record companies
just weren't making any money anymore.

1797
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,460
Those records stores,
they don't exist and you owned a chain

1798
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:50,550
of them and that's how you had barnes
worth and they went under,

1799
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:53,100
but barnes worth.
He created napster.

1800
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,290
Yeah.
Barns were started bawling.

1801
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,070
Barnes worth was he figured out how to
make money off of youtube ads and barnes

1802
01:22:59,071 --> 01:23:00,570
worth.
You know what he did,

1803
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:02,520
man.
He starts selling mp3s,

1804
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:07,210
sort of putting that shit on itunes now.
Worth hundreds of millions of dollars

1805
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,730
in Farnsworth wants to hire you to be as
butler.

1806
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,920
What do he do that?
That sounds like a great movie idea.

1807
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,540
Yeah,
like a face off trading,

1808
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:20,450
trading,
trading phases.

1809
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:24,490
Well,
people who have butlers would hate to be

1810
01:23:24,491 --> 01:23:27,040
a butler.
Like once you have a butler,

1811
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,840
you never want to go to being a butler.
Yeah,

1812
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:32,740
that would be.
That would be diabolical.

1813
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:34,990
Yeah.
Once you have some dude who stands there

1814
01:23:34,991 --> 01:23:37,570
like a,
like a night in front of a castle with

1815
01:23:37,571 --> 01:23:41,290
his little white perfect Tuxedo looking
jacket on though.

1816
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:46,120
Tuxedo shirt and I would love that.
The few times that I've gotten to fly

1817
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:49,750
first class,
I mean having just having somebody come

1818
01:23:49,751 --> 01:23:52,600
up once in a while and be like,
is there anything I can get for you?

1819
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:55,660
Anything at all?
It's always just the greatest feeling.

1820
01:23:55,661 --> 01:23:57,910
I can't imagine having a fulltime barnes
worth.

1821
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,190
They would grow to hate you.
They would tase you.

1822
01:24:00,191 --> 01:24:01,024
Look,
David spades.

1823
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:04,720
Guy tasered him,
but I totally think that David spade out

1824
01:24:04,721 --> 01:24:07,660
of barns worth any tasered him tapped
him.

1825
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:08,950
What?
Yeah.

1826
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,740
Tacked him.
Allegedly I wasn't there.

1827
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:15,790
Allegedly tasered him fucked him up.
It was like a big case.

1828
01:24:15,791 --> 01:24:19,960
It was in the news.
I think the dude just got enough.

1829
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:25,620
David spade at Butler.
He had an assistant which is a milder

1830
01:24:25,991 --> 01:24:27,770
version of a barnes worth.
Yeah.

1831
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:31,960
Follows you around and tells you when
you're supposed to be somewhere skippy.

1832
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:33,003
Skippy.

1833
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:37,480
Skippy.
Do you guys remember skippy from family

1834
01:24:37,481 --> 01:24:40,420
ties?
Your numbers keep you from family ties?

1835
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:42,670
Yeah.
He was on that show with Michael J.

1836
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:47,290
Fox and then went from that into standup
and he would be like on the road and

1837
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:50,740
like places we were like uh,
in the early,

1838
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:52,250
early days.
But now,

1839
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,860
I don't know,
that's hard,

1840
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:55,610
like,
screech did that for awhile to write

1841
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:58,030
from seeing by the bell.
I had to roast them one time.

1842
01:24:58,031 --> 01:25:00,960
We did one of these roasts of the uh,
no,

1843
01:25:00,961 --> 01:25:04,780
it was the roast of Ron.
Jeremy and I had to roast screech.

1844
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:08,200
Oh my God.
It was so much fun that he's completely

1845
01:25:08,201 --> 01:25:10,030
out of his element.
But it was so much fun,

1846
01:25:10,031 --> 01:25:11,100
like a.
I told them,

1847
01:25:11,101 --> 01:25:13,450
uh,
nowadays when I watched episodes of

1848
01:25:13,451 --> 01:25:15,100
saved by the bell,
I think to myself,

1849
01:25:15,101 --> 01:25:16,960
why couldn't there be a school shooting
back then

1850
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,440
too soon?

1851
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:28,840
Too soon.
I guess he stabbed someone at a,

1852
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,310
at a nightclub in,
um,

1853
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:33,130
Minnesota.
Did he stab someone or was he involved

1854
01:25:33,131 --> 01:25:34,780
in a stabbing?
I had heard about it.

1855
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:37,840
He was at a bar or some dude was fucking
with his check.

1856
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:39,790
He pulled out his knife.
Oh my God.

1857
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:42,070
I was actually talking to him like the
day before that happened.

1858
01:25:42,071 --> 01:25:44,120
And then like a day after that happened.
Yeah.

1859
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:45,213
Really?
Yeah.

1860
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,470
What's he like?
He's nice.

1861
01:25:47,471 --> 01:25:48,850
I like him a lot.
So you're good guy.

1862
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,520
You called him or he called you.
Did you reach out to the

1863
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,520
DMD,
each other?

1864
01:25:56,530 --> 01:25:58,960
Jamie's clearly had too much.
I mean,

1865
01:25:59,220 --> 01:25:59,931
Tony's clearly,
uh,

1866
01:25:59,931 --> 01:26:01,710
too much weed today.
Yeah.

1867
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,190
Reach out to the screech owl

1868
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,450
came out of your mouth.
You know,

1869
01:26:07,451 --> 01:26:10,640
it's funny.
Is last time I did a podcast with you,

1870
01:26:10,641 --> 01:26:14,720
we talked about um,
puns and I defended puns and I said,

1871
01:26:14,721 --> 01:26:15,890
people make,
uh,

1872
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:18,640
you know,
only people that can't make puns like

1873
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,850
say that puns or hacky because everybody
loves puns when they're good.

1874
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,980
And so I've been getting,
like,

1875
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:29,150
smashed in my twitter mentions a in a
great way.

1876
01:26:29,151 --> 01:26:33,380
Like people sent me like funny things
that they thought of and it's like my

1877
01:26:33,381 --> 01:26:35,510
favorite thing now people are like,
Hey,

1878
01:26:35,511 --> 01:26:36,950
this happened today,
crazy pun,

1879
01:26:36,951 --> 01:26:37,451
right?
Like Blah,

1880
01:26:37,451 --> 01:26:37,671
blah,
blah,

1881
01:26:37,671 --> 01:26:38,740
blah.
And they sent me the thing.

1882
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:39,690
That's funny.
Yeah,

1883
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:42,750
you love those.
Those two are like little gifts that the

1884
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:45,610
universe gives you and you know,
they're corny because as you're saying

1885
01:26:45,611 --> 01:26:46,390
them,
I see your,

1886
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:49,180
your,
your smile starts to turn up as you're

1887
01:26:49,181 --> 01:26:49,760
saying it.

1888
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,960
It's my favorite thing fucker.
It's so like,

1889
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,700
because they're always in the moment.
I always love stuff that's like,

1890
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,910
right,
that just happened and only it can last

1891
01:26:57,911 --> 01:27:00,340
a second.
Fleeting.

1892
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:04,560
Fleeting.
So this is the special that comes out

1893
01:27:04,561 --> 01:27:08,130
this Friday is the one that you did at
our world famous Ice House Comedy Club.

1894
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:11,580
Our favorite spot or one of our favorite
spots next to.

1895
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,530
Oh,
let's play the trailer or your trailer.

1896
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:15,000
Yep.
Let's play the trailer.

1897
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:20,090
That'll something powerful.
Tony Hinchcliffe entrepreneur.

1898
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:24,180
That's me.
That's how it starts.

1899
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:27,690
This is how it starts.
It's one complete shot and this is

1900
01:27:27,691 --> 01:27:31,950
what's really cool about it.
You follow Tony from the outside where

1901
01:27:31,951 --> 01:27:36,660
he's smoking in front of headliner spot
and the parking lot into the club and

1902
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:40,680
onstage and it never misses a beat.
One continuous take.

1903
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:44,670
No cuts,
no editing,

1904
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:47,110
but there is a cut right there in the
trailer,

1905
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:50,440
unfortunately.
Or else you'd see joey as bringing me

1906
01:27:50,441 --> 01:27:51,760
up,
which was awesome.

1907
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,450
Why'd you throw your cigarette on the
ground?

1908
01:27:54,451 --> 01:27:54,540
Yeah,
right at

1909
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,420
the beginning of their videos.
You're fucking slobs.

1910
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:58,980
I'm done.
Because you're littering done.

1911
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:03,360
I had a Farnsworth there to pick it up.
Just wanted to be the cool guy.

1912
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:03,941
Josh.
Josh,

1913
01:28:03,941 --> 01:28:06,990
Josh.
Josh and Mark Barnes worth,

1914
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,600
we've got to call him Barton's and her
now.

1915
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:15,180
I have no idea why these guys call me
bonds who have now.

1916
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:18,540
I was with somebody the other day and I
was like,

1917
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,020
who was your favorite comic on the
night?

1918
01:28:20,021 --> 01:28:22,740
And had josh on the show and she goes,
oh,

1919
01:28:22,741 --> 01:28:24,990
Josh Martin was my favorite,
but josh really,

1920
01:28:24,991 --> 01:28:26,280
you like Josh and goes,
Dude.

1921
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:29,160
He says rape with a w.
That was hilarious.

1922
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,150
He's absolutely murdering.
I've been randomly,

1923
01:28:36,151 --> 01:28:37,350
you know,
Monday nights are weird.

1924
01:28:37,351 --> 01:28:41,280
I randomly once in a while just to check
in at like 10:00 PM whenever we're done

1925
01:28:41,281 --> 01:28:45,000
with the podcast every time and he's
always on because he just got done with

1926
01:28:45,001 --> 01:28:47,550
our podcast,
so he has a thing where he always gets

1927
01:28:47,551 --> 01:28:50,670
to go on right when we're done.
So he goes downstairs and that's always.

1928
01:28:50,671 --> 01:28:53,190
I always say hi to a few people and then
I'm in there.

1929
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:55,200
He's murdering right now.
Josh.

1930
01:28:55,201 --> 01:28:58,960
That like has that speech impediment
with his gun?

1931
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:01,560
He followed Rogan on the secret the
other day,

1932
01:29:01,561 --> 01:29:04,290
like 300 people.
He had to go up right after Logan.

1933
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:06,640
It was great to see you.
Okay,

1934
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:08,730
stay alive,
stay alive,

1935
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,760
you know,
and he's only been doing it how long

1936
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:13,290
now?
A two and a half years.

1937
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:16,560
I fell in love with him the first time
that I saw him,

1938
01:29:16,561 --> 01:29:19,620
I was,
I was hosting that night and they were

1939
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:22,980
making like some little promo video for
the comedy store and it was the first

1940
01:29:22,981 --> 01:29:26,780
time that I ever saw him on stage and I,
it,

1941
01:29:26,910 --> 01:29:29,310
they asked me to interview,
you know,

1942
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:32,400
just walk around and explain how potluck
works because they wanted to make a

1943
01:29:32,401 --> 01:29:33,750
little two minute video for the comedy.

1944
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,460
So I think it's still on their website
actually.

1945
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:39,440
And I talked to him and I met him that
night and he goes,

1946
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:40,650
I go,
what do you do for work?

1947
01:29:40,651 --> 01:29:44,150
He has,
I'm a manager at a Mcdonald's a like an

1948
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:48,480
hour outside of La San.
So that something like you have such an

1949
01:29:48,481 --> 01:29:53,481
interesting look and you sound so funny
that if you get good at this you are

1950
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:59,271
going to be on fucking stoppable.
And I'm starting to see this fucking

1951
01:30:00,241 --> 01:30:03,120
like when the car starts to turn over
and it's like,

1952
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:04,830
you're like,
Ooh,

1953
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:07,710
there's a fucking engine in here.
I'm seeing it every Monday.

1954
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:10,290
And like I said earlier,
like there's nothing more fun than

1955
01:30:10,291 --> 01:30:12,570
watching people that you know,
and that like,

1956
01:30:12,571 --> 01:30:15,960
you're in you root for just fucking
start ripping it.

1957
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:18,450
And he's doing it right now.
It's so cool.

1958
01:30:18,451 --> 01:30:21,030
Especially since he has such a defined
style.

1959
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:22,230
Like he literally,
you know,

1960
01:30:22,231 --> 01:30:24,480
they say it takes 10 years to find your
voice,

1961
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:27,840
but he has his voice like literally it's
going to.

1962
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:30,150
It is as long as he keeps doing it.
And why?

1963
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:32,400
No speech therapy.
You don't think so.

1964
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:32,850
Oh,
I see.

1965
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:34,680
Oh no way.
I say you fix that.

1966
01:30:34,681 --> 01:30:36,180
You're crazy.
Look at that.

1967
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:39,060
This was like literally,
I think his first time at the comedy

1968
01:30:39,061 --> 01:30:42,210
store and he's bombing,
so it's probably really quick.

1969
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:42,870
Oh,
let's,

1970
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:45,300
we don't want to watch them bomb.
There's no reason.

1971
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:49,230
There's no reason to watch that.
But this was his first time and I go,

1972
01:30:49,231 --> 01:30:51,060
dude,
you gotTa fucking get in the game,

1973
01:30:51,061 --> 01:30:52,660
Bro.
And sure enough he did well,

1974
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:53,820
we worked with the store.
No.

1975
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:55,590
Yeah,
he's worked there for and he's been the

1976
01:30:55,591 --> 01:30:59,220
producer of kill Tony.
I mean this guy fucking hustles and he

1977
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:01,140
tries to do as many spots as possible.

1978
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,030
He's gotten,
you know,

1979
01:31:03,031 --> 01:31:06,030
like you,
I've watched him grow on and off stage

1980
01:31:06,031 --> 01:31:09,030
because like he used to like start
arguments with people and just talk

1981
01:31:09,031 --> 01:31:10,290
shit.
And it's one of the guys,

1982
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:12,660
you know,
like so many others where you get to

1983
01:31:12,661 --> 01:31:17,540
watch them grow as a human.
Some for some people doing standup

1984
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:19,890
comedy,
all of a sudden you're in a social

1985
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,140
setting for the first time ever.
Well,

1986
01:31:22,141 --> 01:31:22,974
it just,
it can be,

1987
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,560
it can be a real bad scene.
You know,

1988
01:31:25,561 --> 01:31:27,540
when you're struggling and you're young
and you,

1989
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:28,910
you know,
look,

1990
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:31,380
you have no future lived in his car for
awhile.

1991
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:34,860
Paid paid dues for while,
like over a year.

1992
01:31:34,861 --> 01:31:38,850
He lived in his car one time.
Brian Moses on the way to the ice house.

1993
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:40,560
Uh,
he had to pee.

1994
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:44,190
I was in the car for that and it was the
most unbelievable thing ever.

1995
01:31:44,191 --> 01:31:48,390
So Josh is driving in the car that he
sleeps in his house.

1996
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,700
We're going to the ice house for one of
these Friday night shows.

1997
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:55,730
I'm sitting shotgun and our good pal
Brian Moses host a roast battle is

1998
01:31:56,491 --> 01:31:59,930
sitting in the backseat and we get off
as soon as we're.

1999
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,100
It's like we're almost.
There were like five minutes away.

2000
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,930
It's like a 25 minute drive,
right?

2001
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,900
All of a sudden Moses is like,
Oh fuck man,

2002
01:32:07,901 --> 01:32:09,700
I gotTa pee bad.
Like real bad.

2003
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:11,320
Oh fuck.
I'm peeing.

2004
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:14,200
And me and Josh are both like,
what?

2005
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:17,620
What are you rallies like,
I can't stop it now I'm paying.

2006
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:22,680
And they were like this out of nowhere.
Moses doesn't mind me telling this

2007
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:26,770
story.
It's funny.

2008
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:29,710
Sorry guys.
You're cool.

2009
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:30,820
You're cool,
you're cool.

2010
01:32:30,821 --> 01:32:32,780
You can handle this.
But.

2011
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:35,430
And what?
But what's unbelievable about this story

2012
01:32:35,431 --> 01:32:39,790
is who cares that he peed himself?
What are the odds that a guy peed

2013
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:43,960
himself that never pays himself ever?
What are the odds that he peed himself

2014
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:46,740
in the back seat of where this kid's
sleep?

2015
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:49,990
Now he has to.
No matter where he's staying,

2016
01:32:49,991 --> 01:32:52,650
has to put his feet on that end of the
backseat.

2017
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:57,510
Hey,
by the way,

2018
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:01,230
just giving a few minutes of warning.
We get a gun

2019
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:05,560
so quick.
Whoever,

2020
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:09,010
God,
how great this story really was on the

2021
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:09,340
Ice House,
right?

2022
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:11,670
Because they came right to the ice house
and then Brian just says,

2023
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,210
I just had to go.
It just came out of nowhere.

2024
01:33:13,211 --> 01:33:16,720
I just had to go and you could tell it.
Even he as it was happening,

2025
01:33:16,721 --> 01:33:17,440
like he's like,
yeah,

2026
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,350
this never happens.
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

2027
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:21,200
Well,
that's.

2028
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,120
It happens when people pooped
themselves.

2029
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:25,400
Right.
That deck almost makes more sense.

2030
01:33:25,401 --> 01:33:27,020
Like sometimes people get diarrhea and
you're like,

2031
01:33:27,021 --> 01:33:29,570
oh God.
Like I remember just a couple of weeks

2032
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:31,310
ago,
I barely made it to the toilet.

2033
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:36,170
I had these insane pains in my lower
stomach and I was climbing.

2034
01:33:36,171 --> 01:33:38,060
I was going upstairs.
When I started to have them,

2035
01:33:38,061 --> 01:33:39,320
I'm like,
oh no,

2036
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:44,350
this is like a real battle.
So I was squeezing right now.

2037
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,400
I couldn't talk to anybody in my.
I can't talk,

2038
01:33:46,401 --> 01:33:47,234
can't talk,
excuse me,

2039
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:51,920
and I had to push past my kids and get
to the toilet and I shut the door.

2040
01:33:51,921 --> 01:33:52,581
Like,
Daddy's got to go.

2041
01:33:52,581 --> 01:33:54,740
Hold on.
I'll be right out in the Mr. asking me

2042
01:33:54,741 --> 01:33:56,510
questions and shit,
and I sit down.

2043
01:33:56,511 --> 01:34:00,440
I had a lock that door because they
start working the knob five year old

2044
01:34:00,441 --> 01:34:02,020
saying,
give a fuck if you have to go to that.

2045
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:03,590
This isn't.
Doesn't register with them.

2046
01:34:03,591 --> 01:34:05,180
Like Daddy,
I've talked to you about some stuff like

2047
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:06,014
hold on,
hold on.

2048
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:10,220
And just were
rushed out of me like a hoard of

2049
01:34:10,221 --> 01:34:13,820
barbarians,
just swinging broadswords fucking

2050
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:17,330
pushing the enemy over the cliff.
It was insane how it was coming out.

2051
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,250
I can't even imagine.
You must have like real man shit.

2052
01:34:20,251 --> 01:34:24,840
It's like I could never.
My little tiny dear droplets come out.

2053
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:30,020
You're starting to eat meat now.
Tony to meet now has a different diet.

2054
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:32,930
I've been eating meat for a few weeks
and I am pumped about it.

2055
01:34:32,931 --> 01:34:36,170
I'm excited about it at a whole chicken
breast yesterday.

2056
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:39,410
That's great.
You went from being a Vegan to being a

2057
01:34:39,411 --> 01:34:40,530
carnivore?
Yeah,

2058
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:43,910
sandwich for dinner last night.
Chicken breasts for lunch.

2059
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:45,560
What was it?
What pushed you over the top?

2060
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:48,470
It was,
besides the mocking of everyone around

2061
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:50,253
it was

2062
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:55,360
I wanted to have friends again.
My Dad,

2063
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,260
I haven't,
I didn't get to go back to youngstown

2064
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:02,780
where I'm from for a few years.
I've just been,

2065
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:04,310
you know,
it's blah,

2066
01:35:04,311 --> 01:35:04,551
blah,
blah,

2067
01:35:04,551 --> 01:35:05,390
blah.
But anyway,

2068
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:09,290
I went into my dad's restaurant.
He owns a great Italian restaurant where

2069
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:12,380
I'm from in Youngstown and a cable to
plug.

2070
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:16,710
Well,
I actually shouldn't this idea.

2071
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:19,170
Yeah,
I've talked about other stuff about in

2072
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:20,330
another podcast.
Anyway,

2073
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:22,660
uh,
um,

2074
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:24,580
what's his restaurant?
Applebee's.

2075
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:25,410
It's,
it's,

2076
01:35:25,410 --> 01:35:27,590
it's a,
it's an independent great Italian

2077
01:35:27,591 --> 01:35:31,040
restaurant.
But he looked at me so disappointed when

2078
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:32,120
he.
He goes,

2079
01:35:32,121 --> 01:35:33,500
all right,
what do you want me to make for you?

2080
01:35:33,501 --> 01:35:35,460
I'm going back,
I'm going to make something like that.

2081
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:36,650
And I go,
uh,

2082
01:35:36,651 --> 01:35:37,730
whatever you want.
I just,

2083
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,920
I,
I don't eat meat and I don't eat dairy.

2084
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:42,770
And the look he gave me,
like it was like,

2085
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:47,000
I could see it was like emperor
palpatine electricity that like out of

2086
01:35:47,001 --> 01:35:49,610
nowhere and you're just like,
oh my God,

2087
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,760
31 years,
this guy has been my dad and I've never

2088
01:35:52,761 --> 01:35:54,500
gotten a look of.
Like,

2089
01:35:54,501 --> 01:35:58,460
he stopped and looked at me confused and
sort of turned his head like a dog.

2090
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:01,220
Like,
are you fucking kidding me?

2091
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,040
So was your dad like Sebastian?
Totally.

2092
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:07,670
Yeah.
My Dad's like a complete perfect hybrid

2093
01:36:07,671 --> 01:36:12,650
of Sebastian and dice.
That's my dad fleet hybrid of those two

2094
01:36:12,651 --> 01:36:13,880
guys.
Are you

2095
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:17,670
kidding me?
So then there you quit.

2096
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:20,940
No,
he waited until we got back in the day.

2097
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:21,660
Got Back.

2098
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:24,990
Well nobody out of all the years out of
everything it's been,

2099
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:26,790
you know,
it was like five or six years of

2100
01:36:26,791 --> 01:36:28,230
vegetarianism,
veganism.

2101
01:36:28,231 --> 01:36:31,680
But I eat fish so it's like pescatarian,
but I don't eat dairy so it's weird.

2102
01:36:32,010 --> 01:36:34,830
Anyway,
nobody's busted my balls more about it

2103
01:36:34,831 --> 01:36:38,520
than Brian Red band here.
And our very good friend Pete,

2104
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:41,160
uh,
because I hang out with them all the

2105
01:36:41,161 --> 01:36:44,370
time and so something happened but blah
blah.

2106
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:47,430
And I just sorta like after the few days
of being back and being like,

2107
01:36:47,431 --> 01:36:51,390
I wonder how good my dad's.
I mean the seafood pasta that he made

2108
01:36:51,391 --> 01:36:54,900
for me was the most mind bending seafood
pasta I've ever had in my life.

2109
01:36:54,901 --> 01:36:58,100
But there was something about the look
that he gave me in which it's like,

2110
01:36:58,110 --> 01:36:59,850
do you have any idea what you're missing
out on?

2111
01:36:59,851 --> 01:37:02,000
You fucking idiot.
I'll make you the seafood.

2112
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:04,130
Positive face looks fuller.
Yeah.

2113
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:05,900
Yeah.
His body looks forward to.

2114
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:09,480
It looks like you've,
you've stopped this growth stunt.

2115
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:14,190
Like you had to maybe like a bend in a
garden hose and just opened it up and

2116
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,450
niosh time you seen.
But lately.

2117
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:19,770
But he's got a new boy.
You got a little bit you to show me your

2118
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:23,450
book.
You do seem like.

2119
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:26,330
Are you really standing up to show your
but don't listen to him.

2120
01:37:26,670 --> 01:37:30,930
Was looking to see if I had a.
But I wasn't showing you.

2121
01:37:30,931 --> 01:37:33,090
I was looking to see if I have.
Could you check?

2122
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:35,730
How can you be sure?
It's a terrible angle that there's no

2123
01:37:35,731 --> 01:37:40,500
way to be sure to see that little poof.
You lifting weights or something?

2124
01:37:40,530 --> 01:37:44,110
Oh yeah.
Squats now know squat.

2125
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:46,730
Um,
I just have a couple of dumbbells.

2126
01:37:46,731 --> 01:37:49,870
I just work shoulders and press and
curl.

2127
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:50,000
You should

2128
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,250
go to a trainer.
Yeah.

2129
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:55,040
I should be a funny show.
You and Brian Losing weight and gaining

2130
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:55,980
weight both

2131
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,990
of you together and then now and call it
in and out.

2132
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:01,750
What's creating every team should do
that.

2133
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:07,230
It helps muscles recover and it helps
them grow and it helps them retain water

2134
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,300
in some people.
When you take too much of it,

2135
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:11,590
it gives you kind of like a puffy look
cause you,

2136
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,920
uh,
you will retain a little bit more water

2137
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:16,440
apparently.
I'm not allowed to talk out of school,

2138
01:38:16,441 --> 01:38:18,450
but it's a bit.
It's definitely been shown to be

2139
01:38:18,451 --> 01:38:20,620
beneficial for gaining muscle.
Yeah.

2140
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:23,280
And it's also something that they
measure.

2141
01:38:23,281 --> 01:38:26,570
If you are overtrained you can have
cree,

2142
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:29,490
I think it's called creatinine.
I think it's a little bit of a different

2143
01:38:29,491 --> 01:38:30,510
thing,
but it's a,

2144
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,000
it's,
it's something that shows the damage of

2145
01:38:33,001 --> 01:38:35,430
your muscles.
So like if you're like grossly

2146
01:38:35,431 --> 01:38:37,650
overtrained,
you might have really high levels of

2147
01:38:37,651 --> 01:38:40,530
this stuff and then like I know if a guy
is a guy,

2148
01:38:40,531 --> 01:38:42,810
I think it was pulled out of a fight
because of it,

2149
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:47,160
like they tested him and he tested
really high for this Korea to stuff.

2150
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:51,600
I want to say tim can,
I know it's harder for me to remember,

2151
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:54,990
but there's another organization outside
of the UFC a long time ago.

2152
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:57,300
I don't remember that.
Remember that.

2153
01:38:57,790 --> 01:39:02,790
But a creatine works illegal to it.
What's your energy like five hour energy

2154
01:39:04,111 --> 01:39:07,650
before doing your work for you?
Because I know I'm so paranoid with my

2155
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:10,110
[inaudible] this thing like tracks your
heartbeat all times.

2156
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:11,970
And it's like,
well the milligrams caffeine,

2157
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:15,630
if you look at a five hour energy drink,
I think it's only a little bit over 200

2158
01:39:15,631 --> 01:39:17,610
milligrams caffeine.
It's vitamin B 12,

2159
01:39:17,611 --> 01:39:19,500
which is healthy for you.
You get some uh,

2160
01:39:19,770 --> 01:39:21,750
some stimulation from that.
It's a lot of vitamin B,

2161
01:39:21,751 --> 01:39:24,090
12 about a vitamin B,
12 is water soluble.

2162
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:26,160
It goes right out of your system and in
and out.

2163
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:29,490
It's not like you'd have to like take
like a giant amount of it for a long

2164
01:39:29,491 --> 01:39:31,320
period of time to have any negative
effects.

2165
01:39:31,530 --> 01:39:36,370
So like using it as a stimulant or a
potential energy source like that in a

2166
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:38,360
five hour energy drinks fun.
It's not bad for you.

2167
01:39:38,361 --> 01:39:40,020
The only thing with the five hour
energies,

2168
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:42,750
you could have a niacin flush.
You ever have one of those?

2169
01:39:42,751 --> 01:39:44,160
Oh yeah.
Well I take um,

2170
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:48,180
I take and I'd take flash Niacin which
makes my whole skin tingle.

2171
01:39:48,181 --> 01:39:53,181
It makes me fucking Shit's really bad.
Happened before I went on this five hour

2172
01:39:53,191 --> 01:39:57,540
energy.
I thought five hour energies were just

2173
01:39:57,541 --> 01:40:02,541
the greatest thing for awhile and uh,
maybe like my 10th or 15th one over like

2174
01:40:04,351 --> 01:40:08,460
a couple months and one of those hit me
and it just freaked me out.

2175
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,780
Oh,
you got a nice and flat.

2176
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,180
Yeah.
See that's nothing compared to taking

2177
01:40:12,181 --> 01:40:15,630
the actual nice and you'd take actual
nice and it's nuts,

2178
01:40:15,631 --> 01:40:17,670
man.
The feeling you get the tingling on your

2179
01:40:17,671 --> 01:40:18,030
skin.

2180
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:19,920
Like it freaks some people out.
It freaked me out.

2181
01:40:19,921 --> 01:40:20,820
What is it?
I like it.

2182
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:23,190
It's a supplement.
I like it because I know it's not going

2183
01:40:23,191 --> 01:40:23,890
to kill me,
but it's,

2184
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:24,620
it's,
you're,

2185
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:26,940
you're feeling the reaction of this
nutrient.

2186
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:31,050
Like it makes you your skin tingle and
flush.

2187
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:32,400
Yeah.
They call it flash.

2188
01:40:32,401 --> 01:40:33,990
Nice.
And um,

2189
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,330
but it's an essential nutrient really
good for your body.

2190
01:40:36,331 --> 01:40:38,730
A lot of people are low in it,
good for sex.

2191
01:40:38,731 --> 01:40:42,840
I imagined the shit she a son.
Well it's also,

2192
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:47,430
that's what that stuff like.
I'm a nitrous oxide,

2193
01:40:47,431 --> 01:40:50,900
which a lot of people take like
different pump up phones.

2194
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:56,200
Those things they have a effect to
Viagra and cialis.

2195
01:40:56,410 --> 01:41:01,410
They have a similar effect and being
like somehow or another it aids the

2196
01:41:02,081 --> 01:41:04,720
blood flow or it stimulates the blood
flow.

2197
01:41:05,410 --> 01:41:09,460
Like um,
a lot of those same drugs are banned in

2198
01:41:09,461 --> 01:41:13,360
the Olympics like Viagra and Cialis is
banned in the Olympics because it's

2199
01:41:13,361 --> 01:41:15,250
actually a performance enhancing
supplement.

2200
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:19,080
Not The judge you on your fucking,
but that they your muscles at selleck.

2201
01:41:19,090 --> 01:41:20,530
When the reason why your Dick,
it's harder.

2202
01:41:20,531 --> 01:41:21,790
Everything gets bigger.
Like you,

2203
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:23,140
you,
you get like harder.

2204
01:41:23,141 --> 01:41:28,141
You get your body like has more
resources available for a brief amount

2205
01:41:28,181 --> 01:41:29,680
of time.
At least they determined enough to make

2206
01:41:29,681 --> 01:41:32,050
it illegal in the Olympics.
Pretty interesting stuff.

2207
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:34,810
You know,
I wonder if there's any sports or having

2208
01:41:34,811 --> 01:41:37,700
a boner actually helps you at the time.
Like Jerry Seiner.

2209
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:39,840
Oh yeah.
Wrestling freaked.

2210
01:41:39,841 --> 01:41:42,350
The other guy just let him know.
Yeah,

2211
01:41:42,790 --> 01:41:45,340
to the death.
It's having.

2212
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:48,640
Taking salaries and biographies sucks
when you're working out though because

2213
01:41:48,641 --> 01:41:50,850
you can't control it when you're on the
treadmill and stuff,

2214
01:41:50,851 --> 01:41:55,030
so you just have crazy boners are all
these guys tap homeboy down,

2215
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:57,290
tack them down right now.
You have to have some type jammies.

2216
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,630
You can't.
Yeah.

2217
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:02,470
You can't be wearing those boxer shorts
that you wear fucking hard slapping

2218
01:42:02,471 --> 01:42:03,580
against the inside of your thigh.

2219
01:42:03,610 --> 01:42:05,680
There's a guy,
there's a guy about those dirty girls

2220
01:42:05,681 --> 01:42:09,350
that you know.
Here's a guy at the gym that's that

2221
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:11,900
muscle.
There's a guy that has that muscle,

2222
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:15,040
like the crazy builder,
but it's so ridiculous.

2223
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:17,890
Like it looks like heat pumps.
The gelan tonight.

2224
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:21,040
It's so uncomfortable when he's around
now they do do that.

2225
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:25,120
You know about that stuff,
that there's this stuff called synth oil

2226
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:29,710
that I'm some crazy people shoot into
their bodies to make it look like they

2227
01:42:29,711 --> 01:42:32,080
have giant muscles,
but they don't really have giant

2228
01:42:32,081 --> 01:42:35,110
muscles.
They have these oil swollen limbs that

2229
01:42:35,111 --> 01:42:37,930
don't look real,
so it looks like they have fake boobs on

2230
01:42:37,931 --> 01:42:40,000
their arms,
fake boobs and their shoulders,

2231
01:42:40,001 --> 01:42:43,360
fake boobs and their boobs.
There's a weirdness to it where you can

2232
01:42:43,361 --> 01:42:48,361
tell that the guy's not really strong,
but he has these crazy fake giant arms

2233
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:51,280
that don't look real at all and dread
giant traps.

2234
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,020
Like there's this one.
Luckily this guy get out a.

2235
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:57,340
yeah,
that's a synthol.

2236
01:42:57,370 --> 01:42:59,290
That's what the guy looks like at my
gym.

2237
01:42:59,530 --> 01:43:00,840
It's scary looking.
Yeah,

2238
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:02,380
it looks like.
Look at that guy.

2239
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:06,370
If you cut that guy open,
he would spill out like a bottle of

2240
01:43:06,371 --> 01:43:08,320
olive oil.
That's exactly what he looks like.

2241
01:43:09,110 --> 01:43:13,720
That's so creepy that these guys make
their entire lives around like the size

2242
01:43:13,721 --> 01:43:16,360
of their bodies to the top right.
One is this guy.

2243
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:22,360
This isn't even.
Isn't that ridiculous?

2244
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:24,250
Insane.
Oh my God.

2245
01:43:24,251 --> 01:43:25,300
Look at his arms,
man.

2246
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:27,370
Get his neck boob.
Well,

2247
01:43:27,371 --> 01:43:31,510
that's all that synthol because like
look at his abs and look at his chest

2248
01:43:31,511 --> 01:43:33,860
like it doesn't even make any sense.
He has a built in neck pillow.

2249
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:36,610
Must be fun to fly with.
What was that other one that you just

2250
01:43:36,611 --> 01:43:38,200
showed?
Is that the guy who we used to look

2251
01:43:38,201 --> 01:43:39,011
like?
Oh,

2252
01:43:39,011 --> 01:43:40,720
photoshop face.
She that guy.

2253
01:43:40,721 --> 01:43:43,070
That's a real body builder body.
That guy.

2254
01:43:43,071 --> 01:43:44,710
That's just steroids and lifting
weights.

2255
01:43:45,850 --> 01:43:48,910
You can tell the difference when you see
those synth oil bodies is a video of

2256
01:43:48,911 --> 01:43:50,800
one.
Find the video of the Brazilian dude.

2257
01:43:50,810 --> 01:43:52,970
There's a Brazilian dude,
he's got his shirt off and he's dancing

2258
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:55,730
and it's so weird,
man.

2259
01:43:55,731 --> 01:44:00,650
You're looking at his tits move and his
shoulders move and his biceps move and

2260
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:03,590
you're like,
what the fuck is why?

2261
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,320
They get crazy,
but it's just like Anorexia,

2262
01:44:06,321 --> 01:44:07,790
man.
You don't know what you look like.

2263
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:10,460
Your mind gets warped.
Oh yeah.

2264
01:44:10,461 --> 01:44:13,020
Body dysmorphia is 100 percent real.
People's,

2265
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:16,160
their mind gets warped and they just
decide I'm not skinny enough and they

2266
01:44:16,161 --> 01:44:19,430
just keep starving themselves,
so there's nothing left that happens

2267
01:44:19,431 --> 01:44:21,950
with people that get all kinds of crazy
shit done to them.

2268
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,100
GC,
amy,

2269
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:25,320
that documentary on Amy winehouse.

2270
01:44:25,570 --> 01:44:26,890
I didn't want.
I didn't want to watch.

2271
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:28,870
That's another one.
Unbelievable.

2272
01:44:29,890 --> 01:44:32,200
Someone was sitting next to me.
Maybe it was Ian.

2273
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:33,640
We're on the plane.
Was it you,

2274
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:37,600
Jamie?
We're watching it and I looked over a

2275
01:44:37,601 --> 01:44:38,381
little bit of it.
I'm like,

2276
01:44:38,381 --> 01:44:41,980
I don't want to watch this kid.
Like having a great time having all this

2277
01:44:41,981 --> 01:44:45,400
talent and then turn into a junkie and
fall apart and an alcoholic.

2278
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,710
It just makes me sad.
Yeah,

2279
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,300
it's depressing.
Well,

2280
01:44:49,301 --> 01:44:52,820
the main thing is that she had
dysmorphia and she was totally believe

2281
01:44:52,821 --> 01:44:55,630
that the entire time,
and it's probably basically what sorta

2282
01:44:55,631 --> 01:44:58,420
killed there is like her body was just
uncomplete shut down.

2283
01:44:58,421 --> 01:44:59,710
When you get to that point,
you know,

2284
01:44:59,711 --> 01:45:02,990
her face started swelling up like
there's crazy things that happened deep

2285
01:45:02,991 --> 01:45:06,540
into bulemia Goddamn.
And towards the end she had bulimia.

2286
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:09,010
Oh,
she had it the whole time and it was

2287
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:11,110
like a huge part of everything.
She was always.

2288
01:45:11,111 --> 01:45:13,180
She would always just throw up
everything that she had,

2289
01:45:13,210 --> 01:45:15,520
but amazing documentary.
Oh my God.

2290
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:17,620
Really?
It starts with this.

2291
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:21,880
There's so much old video footage of her
and it starts with her hanging out with

2292
01:45:21,881 --> 01:45:25,030
their friends and they're singing happy
birthday to one of their friends.

2293
01:45:25,031 --> 01:45:28,480
There's like five girls all hanging out
and they're just like little girls like,

2294
01:45:28,481 --> 01:45:28,991
I don't know,
10,

2295
01:45:28,991 --> 01:45:33,850
11 or 12 and they're all singing happy
birthday and then she keeps going on

2296
01:45:33,851 --> 01:45:37,000
this solo and you're like,
oh my gosh.

2297
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:41,410
Already like totally a star.
She has that amy winehouse fucking voice

2298
01:45:41,411 --> 01:45:43,930
that just kills.
And No,

2299
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,640
I love it.
Also the documentary,

2300
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:49,540
because she was amazing.
She has had pipes and she has that cool,

2301
01:45:49,541 --> 01:45:53,650
like old bluesy fucking big band feel.
That just gets me pumped up.

2302
01:45:53,710 --> 01:45:54,680
I've been listening to a lot of it.

2303
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:56,080
Yeah,
I listened to her a lot.

2304
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:57,700
Um,
I've always been a big fan of hers,

2305
01:45:57,701 --> 01:46:01,630
but she has this like an authenticity to
the sound of her voice.

2306
01:46:01,650 --> 01:46:02,060
Right?

2307
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:03,200
Totally,
totally.

2308
01:46:03,201 --> 01:46:05,150
Standalone.
Almost there with like an ella

2309
01:46:05,151 --> 01:46:07,670
fitzgerald type or like,
have you ever heard of

2310
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:11,790
Raye Montague Montague?
So I know how you say his name though.

2311
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:13,700
I can't remember what he,
what he's done.

2312
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:17,270
This fucking guy.
I'm rose at the comedy store.

2313
01:46:17,450 --> 01:46:18,283
She,
uh,

2314
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,130
out of nowhere she goes,
um,

2315
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,440
we,
we're leaving.

2316
01:46:21,650 --> 01:46:24,470
Everybody's leaving and she pulls into
the parking lot and she's like,

2317
01:46:24,471 --> 01:46:26,280
you gotta hear this fucking Song?
She goes,

2318
01:46:26,281 --> 01:46:27,290
you've got,
you've got to hear this guy.

2319
01:46:27,291 --> 01:46:28,124
I go,
who?

2320
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:29,930
And she goes to this guy just out of
nowhere.

2321
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:32,990
She's like,
this Guy Ray Montague and he's got this

2322
01:46:32,991 --> 01:46:35,290
song.
I'm trying.

2323
01:46:35,350 --> 01:46:36,230
No,
not trouble.

2324
01:46:36,231 --> 01:46:38,500
It's not trouble.
He's got this jolene.

2325
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:40,940
See if he could find jolene.
Um,

2326
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,080
so she,
um,

2327
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:44,210
she plays this song.
Yeah,

2328
01:46:44,211 --> 01:46:45,020
there it is.
Jolene,

2329
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:46,760
that's like his,
his most famous one.

2330
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:48,830
Where do you hear this?
Motherfucker's voice

2331
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:54,540
don't play until you get everything in
line because I don't want it to.

2332
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:58,380
I don't want it to like half play and
then play again because this guy,

2333
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:02,760
his voice is so good.
It deserves to be uninterrupted for the

2334
01:47:02,761 --> 01:47:04,620
brief amount that we don't do a live
version.

2335
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:07,530
Do the studio version is the studio
version?

2336
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:08,340
Yeah.
Okay,

2337
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:09,800
cool.
I cut this off at Youtube.

2338
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,040
Okay.
Here.

2339
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:17,060
This real quick.
Well,

2340
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:26,050
he fills as loud as you can.
Just listen to it.

2341
01:47:50,690 --> 01:47:53,440
Mom.
Mom,

2342
01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:55,260
mom.

2343
01:47:56,950 --> 01:47:59,400
It's amazing.
Like he's a bad motherfucker.

2344
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:00,790
Listen this.
What's this?

2345
01:48:31,090 --> 01:48:34,420
That's a bad motherfucker.
That's undeniable bad motherfucker.

2346
01:48:34,730 --> 01:48:37,270
I get.
He's got like a touch of that Rod.

2347
01:48:37,271 --> 01:48:41,040
Stewart raspiness,
but not like all the way Rod Stewart

2348
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:43,390
just him is him.
You know,

2349
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:44,560
whatever.
It's kind of Raspy,

2350
01:48:44,561 --> 01:48:47,800
but I wouldn't love to anybody else.
It's not like a rod stewart.

2351
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:49,570
He's got his own vibe going on,
man.

2352
01:48:49,571 --> 01:48:52,650
That's a crazy song to song about a
junkie that's just talent.

2353
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:55,420
His love.
I'm not going straight like this is it?

2354
01:48:55,450 --> 01:48:58,730
I'm fucking riding it out.
Woo.

2355
01:48:59,020 --> 01:49:01,870
That's a dark song.
It's fucking soul to it.

2356
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:04,360
Is that a guy that's still alive or.
Yeah,

2357
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:05,261
he's still alive.
I mean,

2358
01:49:05,261 --> 01:49:07,060
it's just a song.
He's not a junkie for real.

2359
01:49:07,090 --> 01:49:07,360
No,
no,

2360
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:07,661
no,
no.

2361
01:49:07,661 --> 01:49:09,520
I mean,
I mean he actually might be,

2362
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:13,690
might be kind of fucked up real then.
That's another thing about the ame thing

2363
01:49:13,691 --> 01:49:14,620
is it's like.
Yeah,

2364
01:49:14,830 --> 01:49:16,490
and Kurt Cobain,
Tim,

2365
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:17,810
it's like,
Whoa,

2366
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:21,400
what is that connection?
We're like these freaky,

2367
01:49:21,401 --> 01:49:26,401
freaky both both vocal wise and they
write their songs like it makes you

2368
01:49:28,091 --> 01:49:30,670
wonder like,
why is there always like this crazy

2369
01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:33,310
adverse effect on the other end are like
heroin.

2370
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:34,150
Yeah,
yeah.

2371
01:49:34,150 --> 01:49:38,620
Or yeah,
well heroin has some sort of connection

2372
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:43,860
to like this deep moody pain that a lot
of blues singers and a lot of jazz

2373
01:49:44,291 --> 01:49:48,360
musicians and a lot of a lot of and roll
stars figured

2374
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:53,360
out a way to tap into and find some
resource of creativity in that realm is

2375
01:49:53,891 --> 01:49:56,380
just so destructive to your body while
you're there.

2376
01:49:56,410 --> 01:49:57,850
It's so,
so devastating.

2377
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:00,610
The fact that you're a junkie,
you're not taking care of your health,

2378
01:50:00,611 --> 01:50:04,000
and it's not even necessarily even
primarily the effects of heroin,

2379
01:50:04,001 --> 01:50:06,700
but the side effects of the lifestyle of
being a junkie,

2380
01:50:06,701 --> 01:50:09,470
that the lack of sleep and the terrible
life and the,

2381
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:13,150
the terrible food and just the chaos,
you know,

2382
01:50:13,151 --> 01:50:15,600
that's,
that's what cripples them all,

2383
01:50:15,650 --> 01:50:17,980
crushes them all.
There's people that are like functional

2384
01:50:17,981 --> 01:50:21,790
junkies that exist for a long time.
They can live for a long time.

2385
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,240
It's weird,
but it's like even being an alcoholic,

2386
01:50:25,241 --> 01:50:28,990
it's not just the alcohol,
it's also the lifestyle that you live

2387
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:31,000
this unhealthy,
lack of sleep,

2388
01:50:31,001 --> 01:50:32,740
lack of recovery,
you know,

2389
01:50:32,741 --> 01:50:35,200
lack of nutrients.
It's not just the alcohol,

2390
01:50:35,201 --> 01:50:38,580
it's the fact that because of you're
throwing all this alcohol down your shit

2391
01:50:38,581 --> 01:50:40,150
hole or your,
your mouth hole,

2392
01:50:40,330 --> 01:50:41,160
you're,
it's,

2393
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:42,070
it's coming.

2394
01:50:42,330 --> 01:50:44,400
It's,
it's affecting your whole body like

2395
01:50:44,401 --> 01:50:46,720
that.
Those decisions to drink that much booze

2396
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:48,880
that affects everything you do.
You're not gonna,

2397
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:51,260
you're not gonna.
Drink that much booze and also eat like

2398
01:50:51,261 --> 01:50:56,020
an incredibly nutrient rich organic diet
and you got to go to Erewhon and get

2399
01:50:56,021 --> 01:50:57,450
fucking salad bar.
You know,

2400
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,410
you're not going to do that or a drunk.
Yeah,

2401
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:03,700
I think it all goes bad and I think with
a lot of these junkies they just give in

2402
01:51:03,710 --> 01:51:08,680
to the fucking sound that given to the
siren to given to the song of that beast

2403
01:51:08,710 --> 01:51:10,530
to takes it into its veins.

2404
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:17,880
Then you sing a song like that.
That's another thing with amy is like,

2405
01:51:17,971 --> 01:51:22,971
you also see that she had this amazing
voice to her whole growing up and she

2406
01:51:23,221 --> 01:51:26,100
wanted to be a musician and she was
doing good and she was doing good and

2407
01:51:26,101 --> 01:51:27,090
good and good.
Good.

2408
01:51:27,091 --> 01:51:30,900
And then she,
then she started heroin and then it's

2409
01:51:30,901 --> 01:51:32,550
like immediately,
you know,

2410
01:51:32,551 --> 01:51:34,320
even the documentary shows and it's
like,

2411
01:51:34,321 --> 01:51:35,760
all right.
And she started doing heroin.

2412
01:51:35,761 --> 01:51:39,810
All of a sudden it goes from these tiny
little jazz clubs to like amphitheaters

2413
01:51:39,811 --> 01:51:41,190
to hold new songs,
you know,

2414
01:51:41,191 --> 01:51:42,670
Rehab the album,
uh,

2415
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:47,430
back back to black or back in black,
which is just all hits like out of this

2416
01:51:47,431 --> 01:51:50,700
world.
And it made me wonder.

2417
01:51:50,701 --> 01:51:51,570
It's like,
wow,

2418
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:56,040
I just wish there was like a,
a like some kind of a,

2419
01:51:57,060 --> 01:52:00,720
what's the word?
Like fake system or a prototype or

2420
01:52:00,721 --> 01:52:01,830
something that you could try.

2421
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:04,940
That would be like,
what would I write if I was on heroin?

2422
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:09,660
You get to peak.
We shouldn't try to open up the present.

2423
01:52:09,690 --> 01:52:13,440
We should all get together like a
professional issue in any drugs with you

2424
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:19,630
do some heroin ride the white snake,
whatever broken pot with you is probably

2425
01:52:20,130 --> 01:52:24,360
45 percent of the time.
Why would anybody want to do heroin with

2426
01:52:24,361 --> 01:52:27,120
you?
That's what do you understand?

2427
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:31,200
I always love that you never come to any
of those mushroom trips with us either.

2428
01:52:31,201 --> 01:52:34,470
Like it makes me think like you know
something about yourself that you don't

2429
01:52:34,471 --> 01:52:35,460
want to solve it.
No,

2430
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:36,360
no,
it's just,

2431
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:39,050
you know,
when I'm on mushrooms and stuff I,

2432
01:52:39,051 --> 01:52:42,900
I like hanging out and not being a
retard and not having like a bunch of

2433
01:52:42,901 --> 01:52:46,070
people around me.
Like I like I like just know one

2434
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,000
other person,
you know,

2435
01:52:47,001 --> 01:52:49,610
either a girlfriend or like a best
friend.

2436
01:52:50,270 --> 01:52:54,170
I don't need 20 people getting in like
20 different things that could go wrong.

2437
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:55,100
Well,
not only that,

2438
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:57,380
at least one of them's going to have a
problem.

2439
01:52:57,540 --> 01:53:00,740
Yeah.
Every time you have a group of six or

2440
01:53:00,741 --> 01:53:03,680
more people that are doing mushrooms,
one person freaks out.

2441
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:06,260
They always freak out,
become your problem if you don't watch

2442
01:53:06,261 --> 01:53:06,741
out,
you know,

2443
01:53:06,741 --> 01:53:08,330
like I,
I like being quiet.

2444
01:53:08,350 --> 01:53:11,780
Not just fold them your problem,
but there's some people that when you're

2445
01:53:11,781 --> 01:53:14,810
on trips with them,
they want to dedicate the trip to their

2446
01:53:14,811 --> 01:53:17,060
trip.
They want to dedicate your trip to their

2447
01:53:17,061 --> 01:53:18,830
trip.
They want your trip to be about their

2448
01:53:18,831 --> 01:53:19,371
trip.
Dude,

2449
01:53:19,371 --> 01:53:21,200
I'm seeing this and do this as
happening.

2450
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:22,310
Dude.
I'm feeling this like,

2451
01:53:22,311 --> 01:53:24,050
Hey,
I'm over here doing my own thing,

2452
01:53:24,051 --> 01:53:26,810
man.
I don't want to constantly be involved

2453
01:53:26,811 --> 01:53:29,660
in your reporting of your trip while I'm
tripping.

2454
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:31,850
So like if you have too many people
together,

2455
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:34,100
you can't.
Like you gotta have you gotta trip with

2456
01:53:34,101 --> 01:53:35,360
someone who knows how to shut the fuck
up.

2457
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:36,830
Right?
That's a big part.

2458
01:53:36,831 --> 01:53:40,310
And that's what's incredible,
is that that always blows my mind is

2459
01:53:40,311 --> 01:53:43,220
that's how it ends up happening when we
take our little,

2460
01:53:43,221 --> 01:53:47,060
like the holiday that are shipped,
fear started streaming fest.

2461
01:53:47,061 --> 01:53:50,840
So once a year we go out there in the
middle of the beautiful desert.

2462
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:53,540
You wait until the moon set its
brightest of the year,

2463
01:53:53,541 --> 01:53:57,650
the supermen.
And it's always incredible how quiet and

2464
01:53:57,740 --> 01:54:00,830
beautiful it gets.
All these guys like six slash seven,

2465
01:54:01,370 --> 01:54:02,960
I guess it's normally like five,
six,

2466
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:06,380
seven comedians that spend every other
night talking,

2467
01:54:06,620 --> 01:54:08,990
just you see them.
We all end up scattering.

2468
01:54:08,991 --> 01:54:12,140
It's not like we're sitting by a
campfire or anything and you see little

2469
01:54:12,141 --> 01:54:14,060
story outlines of like,
oh,

2470
01:54:14,061 --> 01:54:16,640
that's Ryan Mervis over there just
standing there and you.

2471
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:19,160
It is.
It's amazing how quiet that beautiful

2472
01:54:19,161 --> 01:54:24,161
desert can be with these personalities.
You almost feel like the power of it a

2473
01:54:24,891 --> 01:54:28,260
little bit.
It's a potent psychedelic drug man.

2474
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:32,180
And if you use the right intention,
if you have the right ideas going into

2475
01:54:32,181 --> 01:54:33,140
it,
and if you can handle it,

2476
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:35,690
you can get some wild thoughts out of
it.

2477
01:54:36,350 --> 01:54:39,500
They're very beneficial and people will
dismiss people like,

2478
01:54:39,510 --> 01:54:40,940
you know,
people that have done it.

2479
01:54:40,970 --> 01:54:41,930
They'll say,
well,

2480
01:54:42,050 --> 01:54:43,550
you know,
I don't even like what he does.

2481
01:54:43,630 --> 01:54:45,320
He's done mushrooms and why would I do
it?

2482
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:49,700
It ain't.
It's not disputable.

2483
01:54:49,730 --> 01:54:52,310
Like the experience is not disputable.
It's powerful.

2484
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:55,310
It's undeniably powerful.
It might not be for you.

2485
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:57,110
I don't know you.
It cares.

2486
01:54:57,111 --> 01:54:59,510
People have depression cures,
people of addiction,

2487
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:01,130
cures,
people of cigarette addiction,

2488
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:02,060
cures,
people of Alcohol,

2489
01:55:02,061 --> 01:55:03,300
addiction,
curious people.

2490
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:05,510
It's give.
It gives you a chance to look at

2491
01:55:05,511 --> 01:55:09,080
yourself in a way that you probably
would never be able to get to without

2492
01:55:09,081 --> 01:55:10,820
it,
and it'll give it to you for a short

2493
01:55:10,821 --> 01:55:14,030
window to get to see yourself.
You get to see live.

2494
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:17,930
You get to see intention.
You just see the past.

2495
01:55:17,931 --> 01:55:21,290
You get to see the present.
You get to see it all combined together

2496
01:55:21,291 --> 01:55:24,620
and some strange light of this other
worldly intelligence.

2497
01:55:24,621 --> 01:55:29,621
It's weird,
like overwhelmingly powerful new thought

2498
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:33,830
process that's going on in your head or
just overwhelmed and you're seeing

2499
01:55:33,831 --> 01:55:37,520
things and the visualizations when you
close your eyes are spectacular.

2500
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:40,550
And uh,
somehow or another it's illegal.

2501
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:43,980
Insane as the best part about

2502
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,180
it.
It's so stupid.

2503
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,160
It's the stupidest thing to have illegal
ever.

2504
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:48,300
Yeah.
Like this.

2505
01:55:48,301 --> 01:55:50,380
The one thing that makes people better,
like we,

2506
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:52,920
we know it,
like it's John Hopkins University did

2507
01:55:52,921 --> 01:55:55,080
the whole thing.
They did a thing on people that are

2508
01:55:55,081 --> 01:55:57,540
dying.
People that have had.

2509
01:55:58,620 --> 01:56:00,300
No,
actually it was a personality that was a

2510
01:56:00,301 --> 01:56:02,700
different one.
They did one on people that are dying.

2511
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:07,940
They gave them a silicide ben and
significantly alleviated their stress

2512
01:56:08,221 --> 01:56:11,670
levels.
And then they did another one on people

2513
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:16,230
that John Hopkins one was,
they had these people do a psychedelic

2514
01:56:16,231 --> 01:56:18,540
experiment,
psychedelic experience.

2515
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:22,230
And then like over a decade later,
they were still saying that the quality

2516
01:56:22,231 --> 01:56:24,540
of their life significantly changed.
After that experience.

2517
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:27,590
A lot of them were saying it.
There's a lot of benefits.

2518
01:56:27,610 --> 01:56:30,000
There's a lot of these different things
that they made illegal in 1970.

2519
01:56:30,001 --> 01:56:31,410
We just got to face up to the facts.

2520
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:34,050
We've got fucked by the same people that
had Nixon in power,

2521
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:38,040
Lyndon Johnson and those types of people
that we shouldn't be held prisoner these

2522
01:56:38,041 --> 01:56:39,570
old ways of thinking.
Totally.

2523
01:56:39,571 --> 01:56:42,000
You know,
but I think that law enforcement and

2524
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:43,070
the,
you know,

2525
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:45,870
a lot of people that control laws and
have laws in place,

2526
01:56:45,871 --> 01:56:49,140
they're very reluctant to give up a law
or to admit that all the arrests that

2527
01:56:49,141 --> 01:56:53,640
they made were unjust because it opens
up this giant bow backs of,

2528
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:54,600
of Shit.
You know,

2529
01:56:54,601 --> 01:56:58,080
like looking at all these people that
are in jail for nonviolent drug crimes.

2530
01:56:58,081 --> 01:57:00,900
Now those drugs are legal.
What the fuck do you do with all those

2531
01:57:00,901 --> 01:57:03,030
people in jail?
You know?

2532
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:04,530
Yeah.
It's crazy.

2533
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:05,783
Once Seattle,
they,

2534
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:08,100
they're letting people out there letting
people,

2535
01:57:08,101 --> 01:57:10,890
people that were in for pot and people
that were selling pot,

2536
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:12,900
they're dropping their cases

2537
01:57:13,570 --> 01:57:15,320
and you know,
it's one of those things too where,

2538
01:57:15,350 --> 01:57:16,780
you know,
what's crazy is like,

2539
01:57:17,570 --> 01:57:19,220
I guess you haven't seen making a
murder,

2540
01:57:19,221 --> 01:57:21,350
but it's like,
I know the premise though,

2541
01:57:21,380 --> 01:57:23,240
but the pain,
the premise is that like,

2542
01:57:23,241 --> 01:57:26,570
you know what?
He was in prison for all those years,

2543
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:29,390
so maybe he did do this and if he did do
this,

2544
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:32,770
he did it because he learned these bad
ways in prison.

2545
01:57:32,771 --> 01:57:35,420
Yeah.
Which brings it back to the jug people

2546
01:57:35,421 --> 01:57:36,920
is.
It's like they might go in,

2547
01:57:36,921 --> 01:57:41,540
be in a pot dealer and come out being a
rapist murderer because they jerked off

2548
01:57:41,541 --> 01:57:44,660
for months to their bunk mates fantasy
that he told them,

2549
01:57:44,661 --> 01:57:47,270
oh yeah,
I tied this bitch up and it was the most

2550
01:57:47,271 --> 01:57:48,530
fun,
you know?

2551
01:57:48,531 --> 01:57:49,370
And they're like,
wow,

2552
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:52,310
that sounds interesting.
And they get out and just start doing

2553
01:57:52,311 --> 01:57:53,144
crazy stuff like that.

2554
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:54,310
That.
Yeah,

2555
01:57:54,770 --> 01:57:55,340
that,
that.

2556
01:57:55,340 --> 01:57:56,770
There's a lot of those things,
right?

2557
01:57:56,860 --> 01:57:58,140
[inaudible].
I mean,

2558
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:01,400
that's the recidivism rate of these
presences.

2559
01:58:01,470 --> 01:58:04,920
Insane because.
And I did all this research on it when

2560
01:58:04,921 --> 01:58:08,520
Jeff Ross did his prison special for
comedy central.

2561
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:10,620
I learned all about this stuff.

2562
01:58:10,940 --> 01:58:12,830
Jeff had a really powerful thing about
that,

2563
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:13,840
that he.
He didn't like,

2564
01:58:14,030 --> 01:58:17,090
it wasn't an interview or what it was.
I tweeted it,

2565
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:20,600
I forget what it was,
but he was talking about like what he

2566
01:58:20,601 --> 01:58:24,110
learned about the prison system and how
hopeless it is for the people that get

2567
01:58:24,111 --> 01:58:27,410
stuck inside of it and then you hear
about things like that guy in

2568
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:31,160
Pennsylvania,
that judge that was sending these kids

2569
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:34,880
to a juvenile detention setting these
kids up the river for like nothing

2570
01:58:35,090 --> 01:58:38,300
because he was getting paid for it now,
God that he's in jail now,

2571
01:58:38,570 --> 01:58:41,330
but he was selling children to
prisoners,

2572
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:43,060
to prisons,
to private prisons.

2573
01:58:43,090 --> 01:58:44,110
Essentially.
That's what he was doing.

2574
01:58:44,380 --> 01:58:45,520
It was.
There was a scam.

2575
01:58:45,521 --> 01:58:48,700
He was being paid off to continue to
supply them with prisoners.

2576
01:58:48,970 --> 01:58:52,330
So he was taking these kids and just
ruining their lives.

2577
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:54,340
Wow.
Like ruined countless people's lives.

2578
01:58:54,341 --> 01:58:57,400
Took people for minor offenses that
should have never done time.

2579
01:58:57,401 --> 01:59:01,810
They just kids and just locked him up
and fucked him over and then he kept

2580
01:59:01,811 --> 01:59:04,390
them trapped and imagine how terrified
you'd be your 15,

2581
01:59:04,391 --> 01:59:07,570
16 year old kid and you do some normal
kid shit and all sudden you get

2582
01:59:07,571 --> 01:59:11,230
railroaded through this justice system
and this guy who corrupt sends you to a

2583
01:59:11,231 --> 01:59:14,050
detention to get you away from your
parents and all of a sudden you're

2584
01:59:14,051 --> 01:59:17,470
locked up and some fucking juvenile
center somewhere with a bunch of real

2585
01:59:17,471 --> 01:59:18,490
legit criminals.

2586
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:22,480
Yeah.
That's like insane.

2587
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:24,880
It doesn't mean that all judges are bad.
Right?

2588
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:25,773
Right,
right.

2589
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:27,130
It doesn't mean all judges would do
that,

2590
01:59:27,131 --> 01:59:30,010
but fuck,
fuck.

2591
01:59:31,070 --> 01:59:32,120
GotTa gotta come up with

2592
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:35,150
better system for dealing with people
because it's almost like when someone

2593
01:59:35,151 --> 01:59:36,620
does something wrong,
we just write them off.

2594
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:40,340
Just write them off and send them to
this hole and lock them up in this cage

2595
01:59:40,341 --> 01:59:41,810
where Shit's just going to get way
worse.

2596
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:44,210
And if you.
If you don't want shit to get way worse,

2597
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:50,160
you have to follow by the rules or you
get stuffed into a concrete and metal

2598
01:59:50,711 --> 01:59:54,790
box forever.
Craziness.

2599
01:59:55,330 --> 01:59:56,800
It's insane.
But what do you do?

2600
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:01,600
What do you do with someone who is like
a lifelong criminal and is broken

2601
02:00:01,601 --> 02:00:04,000
mentally,
like how do you fix that person?

2602
02:00:04,270 --> 02:00:08,290
I think you've put them in a
stormtrooper type of setup and just make

2603
02:00:08,291 --> 02:00:12,580
them a soldier and ship them around the
country and program them to only be able

2604
02:00:12,581 --> 02:00:15,100
to do certain things like robocop
program.

2605
02:00:15,101 --> 02:00:17,970
Yeah.
Like Hobo Cop.

2606
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:23,080
Like have like these fucking.
You got to there just because you had

2607
02:00:23,240 --> 02:00:26,440
hobo copy of your head down.
You said Robocop.

2608
02:00:26,450 --> 02:00:28,750
I
wouldn't,

2609
02:00:29,370 --> 02:00:31,860
I wouldn't set myself up for a Hobo cop
that.

2610
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:38,620
But uh,
what movie was that were they reprogram

2611
02:00:38,621 --> 02:00:40,420
people's mind returning.
Ah,

2612
02:00:40,580 --> 02:00:42,200
that's it.
Thank you John.

2613
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:47,200
The answer to that.
And the other guy,

2614
02:00:47,230 --> 02:00:48,580
not just van dam.
The other guy.

2615
02:00:48,670 --> 02:00:49,570
Yes.
Thank you.

2616
02:00:50,170 --> 02:00:52,150
Yeah.
Universal soldier was shit.

2617
02:00:52,510 --> 02:00:53,610
That was a good movie.
Yeah,

2618
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:54,880
it turned them into.
That's right.

2619
02:00:54,940 --> 02:00:56,260
That's exactly what it was.
Look,

2620
02:00:56,261 --> 02:00:59,650
that's totally possible.
That's probably possible before they

2621
02:00:59,651 --> 02:01:01,240
even figured out how to do the robot
thing.

2622
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:03,370
Yeah.
I probably figured out how to program

2623
02:01:03,371 --> 02:01:04,860
people's minds.
Oh yeah.

2624
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:09,130
No Man.
It's just a matter of time,

2625
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:11,050
you mean?
Yeah.

2626
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:14,290
It seems like Schunk glove and dum,
dum,

2627
02:01:15,610 --> 02:01:16,091
dum,
dum,

2628
02:01:16,091 --> 02:01:19,690
dum.
We got laser design.

2629
02:01:19,790 --> 02:01:23,680
It must be serious.
It was so hilarious.

2630
02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:26,920
What's that?
Oh yeah.

2631
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:30,580
Tiny Lester in the background.
That's hilarious.

2632
02:01:31,690 --> 02:01:34,750
Those movies were fun.
I roasted tiny list are at that same

2633
02:01:34,751 --> 02:01:36,340
roast with a.
That screech.

2634
02:01:36,341 --> 02:01:38,110
Was that what?
Let me ask you this.

2635
02:01:38,170 --> 02:01:39,500
If someone came along.
Okay.

2636
02:01:39,501 --> 02:01:40,190
Like what if somebody

2637
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:44,120
was in a motorcycle accident and they
were essentially brain dead and some

2638
02:01:44,121 --> 02:01:49,121
doctors came along and said that they
have the ability to turn this guy into a

2639
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:53,040
soldier robot and you can go fight for
his country like your,

2640
02:01:53,041 --> 02:01:53,751
your,
your,

2641
02:01:53,751 --> 02:01:55,070
you know,
your brother's Dad,

2642
02:01:55,071 --> 02:01:56,520
Tony.
But uh,

2643
02:01:56,780 --> 02:01:59,720
we can keep them alive and have them go
defend his country.

2644
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:01,580
I'm going to send them over to
Afghanistan.

2645
02:02:02,860 --> 02:02:03,630
I mean,
hey,

2646
02:02:03,630 --> 02:02:05,480
might as well better.
They haven't buried,

2647
02:02:05,481 --> 02:02:06,470
right?
Do you think so?

2648
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:11,210
Isn't that what deadpool does?
Deadpool comic isn't think I love.

2649
02:02:11,590 --> 02:02:13,820
Isn't that what?
Isn't he have like a super powers or

2650
02:02:13,821 --> 02:02:15,560
some shit?
They gave him some sort of bad ass

2651
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:18,020
powers.
He was going to die or he's given

2652
02:02:18,021 --> 02:02:19,160
terminal.
Oh,

2653
02:02:19,161 --> 02:02:21,050
see,
that's a comic book that I was never

2654
02:02:21,051 --> 02:02:23,180
aware of.
So when this one comes out,

2655
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:26,120
I am completely out of my element.
I don't know anything about.

2656
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:27,500
That was a marvel though,
right?

2657
02:02:27,501 --> 02:02:29,990
It was a marvel comic arguing for it
too.

2658
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,490
That's pretty good.
He didn't dress well.

2659
02:02:31,491 --> 02:02:33,200
This is a movie that almost didn't get
made,

2660
02:02:33,390 --> 02:02:35,990
but then they made a really cool like
trailer.

2661
02:02:35,991 --> 02:02:39,740
Someone made a fun trailer and the
interest for it picked up.

2662
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:42,980
So they decided to make the movie.
What's the movie?

2663
02:02:43,290 --> 02:02:45,980
Deadpool,
they made this fake Valentine's Day.

2664
02:02:46,890 --> 02:02:50,450
Tried to trick some people a true love
never dies.

2665
02:02:50,451 --> 02:02:51,284
Valentine's Day.

2666
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:58,670
Romcom style posters and Ryan Mental.
Just taking full advantage.

2667
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:01,310
Oh yeah man.
It's going to be interesting.

2668
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:05,600
We're gonna have.
There's gonna come a time where they can

2669
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:11,500
sort of re reanimate a human body,
put an artificial brain and it might be

2670
02:03:13,071 --> 02:03:15,470
the first thing they do before they go
to artificial intelligence.

2671
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:17,840
Take some dude because his head blown
off.

2672
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:19,500
It's like that dead dog.
It was hard.

2673
02:03:19,990 --> 02:03:21,760
It's still hanging on.
Not,

2674
02:03:21,830 --> 02:03:24,000
not,
not thought out yet or not.

2675
02:03:24,001 --> 02:03:26,270
Uh,
not thickened up.

2676
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:28,820
Yeah,
they just keep it going to slap some

2677
02:03:28,821 --> 02:03:30,360
robot head on there.
Screw it down

2678
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:35,420
like robocop style,
like a pit crew.

2679
02:03:38,510 --> 02:03:42,800
Isn't it funny how like Robocop,
when you watch that movie back in the

2680
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:45,050
day it was like this is so never going
to happen.

2681
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:46,730
Right,
but today you're like,

2682
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:50,360
well I bet they could probably do it
there,

2683
02:03:50,361 --> 02:03:54,740
but we're probably pretty close to being
able to come up with some artificial

2684
02:03:54,741 --> 02:03:58,940
limbs that are more strong and more
dynamic and they just have to have some

2685
02:03:58,941 --> 02:04:01,970
sort of a power source.
There is robocop.

2686
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:05,140
Wow.
He had a dope outfit to the new robocop.

2687
02:04:05,580 --> 02:04:07,910
I never saw.
I wasn't really into the new outfit that

2688
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:10,190
you just didn't.
This is the new one.

2689
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:12,710
Did you watch the new one?
No,

2690
02:04:12,711 --> 02:04:14,390
I didn't know either.
I think that is the new one.

2691
02:04:14,391 --> 02:04:15,920
I met that dude.
Yeah.

2692
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:17,270
Yeah.
See why?

2693
02:04:17,271 --> 02:04:19,320
Why does he have his hands covered?
I'm gonna Chop your hands off,

2694
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:22,820
which we've got to have your hands
covered.

2695
02:04:22,850 --> 02:04:24,470
How come you.
Your mouth isn't covered either.

2696
02:04:24,510 --> 02:04:27,020
Shoot you right in the mouth one
identified the weak spots.

2697
02:04:27,330 --> 02:04:29,600
Yeah.
You don't want to have an exposed mouth

2698
02:04:29,601 --> 02:04:31,040
hole one.
Yeah.

2699
02:04:31,190 --> 02:04:32,870
Why would you ever have your exposed
mouth?

2700
02:04:33,670 --> 02:04:36,920
He's got his whole face.
His whole faith is ready to be shot

2701
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:38,400
because I'm assuming

2702
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:39,690
there's a brain back there,
right?

2703
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:41,580
You got skin.
So there's,

2704
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:43,350
you know,
I'm gonna shoot the right to your

2705
02:04:43,351 --> 02:04:45,390
eyeballs in your brain.
So stupid.

2706
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:47,940
You know,
like he's got like a regular human

2707
02:04:47,941 --> 02:04:49,110
mouth.
Why would you have that?

2708
02:04:49,111 --> 02:04:51,840
When everything else is protected,
you can't project.

2709
02:04:51,870 --> 02:04:53,820
You'll have some sort of a speaker on
the outside.

2710
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:58,340
There's so many veins and important
arteries that run around equity or how's

2711
02:04:58,341 --> 02:05:00,620
it gonna eat with no teeth.
It's gonna get shot in the face with a

2712
02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:03,010
Canon in Detroit to do,
you know,

2713
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:05,700
it seems like the best place to put it
today.

2714
02:05:05,701 --> 02:05:06,181
It is.
Yeah.

2715
02:05:06,181 --> 02:05:08,400
Right.
No one seems to have seen this movie.

2716
02:05:08,401 --> 02:05:09,840
It must have been a robo flop.

2717
02:05:12,970 --> 02:05:17,140
He out.
He had it.

2718
02:05:17,141 --> 02:05:19,900
He delivered it.
You were stunned and now you're

2719
02:05:19,901 --> 02:05:20,734
defensive.

2720
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:23,780
True.
I actually went and saw the movie and I

2721
02:05:23,781 --> 02:05:26,260
eat a lot of popcorn during it.
I was a Robo slop.

2722
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:27,230
Oh,
come on,

2723
02:05:27,231 --> 02:05:28,330
Robo.
Stop

2724
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:36,190
cleaning house in here.
Somebody grab us a robo mop.

2725
02:05:39,380 --> 02:05:43,970
Your guys' expectations are too high,
right elbow.

2726
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:48,140
This is a pun battle battle.
But red badges.

2727
02:05:48,141 --> 02:05:51,050
One to you.
One to me.

2728
02:05:51,190 --> 02:05:52,023
He did.
Oh,

2729
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:57,160
why do you keep making this?
What I do?

2730
02:05:57,161 --> 02:06:02,030
I go,
how would you like me to react?

2731
02:06:02,031 --> 02:06:03,500
I'll do whatever you like.
I don't know.

2732
02:06:03,501 --> 02:06:04,091
Like,
oh,

2733
02:06:04,091 --> 02:06:06,990
la La,
la,

2734
02:06:07,050 --> 02:06:07,900
la,
la,

2735
02:06:07,910 --> 02:06:08,743
la,
la.

2736
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:12,740
That's the pun.
Laugh.

2737
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:20,260
Could you imagine
cracks upon on stage and the whole

2738
02:06:21,021 --> 02:06:22,710
cargo.
Ah,

2739
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:24,370
LA,
la.

2740
02:06:24,940 --> 02:06:26,820
That would be awesome.
Dude.

2741
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:28,430
Fucking manifested.
You better.

2742
02:06:28,431 --> 02:06:31,040
Be careful what you wish for full.

2743
02:06:31,090 --> 02:06:35,930
But you wishful young Tony.
Tony's going to be with me Friday night

2744
02:06:35,931 --> 02:06:40,931
and then land in my special comes out
and then Saturday night and Tampa,

2745
02:06:41,061 --> 02:06:43,490
you will already be a star by the time
you get on stage.

2746
02:06:43,491 --> 02:06:46,760
It'll already have launched and people
will know and you'll be doing all new

2747
02:06:46,761 --> 02:06:47,650
material.
Yeah,

2748
02:06:47,900 --> 02:06:51,410
that's the beautiful thing with this.
You did this a few months back,

2749
02:06:51,411 --> 02:06:52,510
like how many months?
March.

2750
02:06:52,590 --> 02:06:54,890
March.
So it's almost a year.

2751
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:55,910
Yeah.
So,

2752
02:06:55,911 --> 02:06:58,400
um,
and in that time you've got a whole new

2753
02:06:58,400 --> 02:06:59,233
hour.
Uh,

2754
02:06:59,590 --> 02:07:01,820
I have a new,
yeah,

2755
02:07:01,821 --> 02:07:04,550
30,
35,

2756
02:07:04,551 --> 02:07:06,230
somewhere in there.
It's ever changing.

2757
02:07:06,231 --> 02:07:08,210
You know,
sometimes I've been realizing lately.

2758
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:09,080
I don't know.
Yeah,

2759
02:07:09,370 --> 02:07:11,330
it's wibbly wobbly.
So you about your,

2760
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:15,950
bounced some of it out and started going
all knew as soon as I taped it.

2761
02:07:15,980 --> 02:07:18,690
A lot of guys I guess like start when
uh,

2762
02:07:18,890 --> 02:07:19,723
when it comes out.
Yeah.

2763
02:07:19,770 --> 02:07:20,890
Yeah.
But like I,

2764
02:07:21,380 --> 02:07:23,920
I was ready to move on anyway.
Well you already,

2765
02:07:23,921 --> 02:07:24,810
you knew,
um,

2766
02:07:24,860 --> 02:07:27,350
also the,
you were going to try to get this on and

2767
02:07:27,351 --> 02:07:29,090
you get ahead of the game,
right?

2768
02:07:29,180 --> 02:07:30,980
Going out of the bat knew.
Yeah,

2769
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:34,520
I just did the fighter and the kid and
it actually came up that like they're

2770
02:07:34,521 --> 02:07:35,030
like,
you know,

2771
02:07:35,030 --> 02:07:36,130
are you doing all new stuff

2772
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:37,330
now?
And I talked about how,

2773
02:07:37,670 --> 02:07:39,160
you know,
working with you being,

2774
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:42,850
you're one of the few guys in the whole
game that also,

2775
02:07:42,851 --> 02:07:46,060
you know what I mean,
like generates not also you're one of

2776
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:50,330
the few comedians that has like a new
hour a year or you know,

2777
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:55,320
and so like working with you even though
you've never said to me personally like

2778
02:07:55,330 --> 02:08:00,220
you need to write more material.
Like it naturally I think rubs off that,

2779
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:03,020
you know,
were you got to just keep going and plow

2780
02:08:03,021 --> 02:08:04,190
and like if um,
if you,

2781
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:08,170
if you can do it with an hour and a half
or two hours after my half hour than I

2782
02:08:08,171 --> 02:08:10,060
should be doing it with my half hour,
you know.

2783
02:08:10,061 --> 02:08:11,440
So it's,
it helps a little.

2784
02:08:11,460 --> 02:08:14,490
When you do a longer sets,
longer sets on the weekends helps,

2785
02:08:14,580 --> 02:08:16,920
you know what.
But anytime you can get it in a half

2786
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:18,390
hour,
if you can get in a half an hour set,

2787
02:08:18,690 --> 02:08:20,910
you know,
the real problem with La is if you're

2788
02:08:20,911 --> 02:08:23,100
going to do a spot in La,
you probably going to get 15 minutes.

2789
02:08:23,130 --> 02:08:25,080
Right?
And when you get those 15 minutes spots,

2790
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:29,700
most likely you'll have room for one or
two new ideas and you'll have,

2791
02:08:29,730 --> 02:08:31,580
you know,
I always try to balance it out if I'm

2792
02:08:31,590 --> 02:08:33,670
doing new stuff,
unless I did like I did stand up on a

2793
02:08:33,671 --> 02:08:37,020
spot last night,
which is obviously all adlibbed and that

2794
02:08:37,021 --> 02:08:39,350
was really fun.
But when you do new stuff you've got to

2795
02:08:39,351 --> 02:08:40,650
kind of like,
it's,

2796
02:08:40,690 --> 02:08:43,260
it's hard to decide like when to start
the new stuff.

2797
02:08:43,261 --> 02:08:46,200
Do you open with the new stuff or do you
open with something established?

2798
02:08:46,201 --> 02:08:48,420
Get the ball rolling and then introduced
the new stuff.

2799
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:51,320
You don't have a lot of time to fuck
around and like 15 minutes set.

2800
02:08:51,660 --> 02:08:52,620
Yeah.
And I also,

2801
02:08:52,621 --> 02:08:55,460
you know,
I like to bounce in and out once in a

2802
02:08:55,461 --> 02:08:57,660
while of crowd work,
you know,

2803
02:08:57,661 --> 02:09:01,510
and him improvising stuff onstage and
uh,

2804
02:09:02,610 --> 02:09:07,140
said that's also mixed into things.
And that's also part of the reason why I

2805
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:12,200
shot this in one shot because I just
went with my gut and I'm like,

2806
02:09:12,661 --> 02:09:16,830
if things go off the track,
that's normally when I shine is like

2807
02:09:16,831 --> 02:09:18,510
you,
you see like sometimes when we do our

2808
02:09:18,511 --> 02:09:21,960
shows that those big theaters,
like I'll do a thing where our roast

2809
02:09:21,990 --> 02:09:23,220
people,
a group of people,

2810
02:09:23,221 --> 02:09:25,680
if they come in late and I warned the
crowd in the beginning.

2811
02:09:25,681 --> 02:09:27,570
Like if somebody comes in late I'm going
to light them up,

2812
02:09:27,571 --> 02:09:28,650
our little secret.
Okay.

2813
02:09:28,651 --> 02:09:30,900
And the place just loves it.
And I love that,

2814
02:09:30,901 --> 02:09:32,430
you know,
just improvising in the moment.

2815
02:09:32,431 --> 02:09:35,460
I love that pressure.
I love that feeling of like,

2816
02:09:35,461 --> 02:09:39,000
you know like being a quarterback and
you feel like that line backer coming,

2817
02:09:39,001 --> 02:09:40,530
but you still have to get rid of the
ball.

2818
02:09:40,530 --> 02:09:44,850
You have to just stay calm and deliver.
And I think part of the reason why I did

2819
02:09:44,851 --> 02:09:47,760
it all in one shot is because I knew
that if something,

2820
02:09:47,761 --> 02:09:51,510
which it didn't at all and I didn't end
up doing any crowd work and I sort of

2821
02:09:51,511 --> 02:09:54,240
was half planning,
like I was on the towing the line right

2822
02:09:54,241 --> 02:09:55,650
before I went on,
like,

2823
02:09:56,190 --> 02:09:57,850
you know,
you know,

2824
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:03,120
anything can happen.
I knew that I only had one show which is

2825
02:10:03,121 --> 02:10:07,740
rare in itself when shooting a special
to only have one show in one audience

2826
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:11,730
and one camera and I was ready to do
crowd work,

2827
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:15,960
but I just sort of,
you'll see in like the first 15 seconds

2828
02:10:15,961 --> 02:10:17,130
I just sorta like,
you know,

2829
02:10:17,550 --> 02:10:20,790
just saying hello.
And then I go right into material.

2830
02:10:21,330 --> 02:10:23,770
You get into it,
you wouldn't do it like a regular show,

2831
02:10:23,771 --> 02:10:24,210
right?

2832
02:10:24,210 --> 02:10:26,550
Yeah.
I ended up just doing material and it

2833
02:10:26,610 --> 02:10:29,360
sort of stayed on track.
There was a part where uh,

2834
02:10:29,410 --> 02:10:30,870
like,
I dunno like 35,

2835
02:10:30,871 --> 02:10:33,710
40 minutes in or something.
My throat goes dry,

2836
02:10:33,711 --> 02:10:36,500
which like never happens.
But like I was like sorta like,

2837
02:10:36,530 --> 02:10:39,290
choked up a little bit.
And I take a sip of my water that's

2838
02:10:39,291 --> 02:10:41,660
sitting there.
Now you'll most comedians do a.

2839
02:10:41,770 --> 02:10:44,780
most comedians take a sip of their drink
when they're getting a huge applause

2840
02:10:44,781 --> 02:10:47,000
break.
This is a special special.

2841
02:10:47,630 --> 02:10:49,810
Then they just giggled because they all
know that,

2842
02:10:49,850 --> 02:10:50,730
hey,
I gotta take a leak.

2843
02:10:50,731 --> 02:10:52,840
I'm so sorry to interrupt you,
but I've been holding this in for awhile

2844
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:54,950
for some strange reason.
So Brian talked to him real quick.

2845
02:10:55,830 --> 02:10:56,630
Tony.
Wow.

2846
02:10:56,630 --> 02:10:58,880
Normally you bust my balls when I have
to pay

2847
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:05,720
Brian White.
Uh,

2848
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:08,560
yeah.
It was cool that they're doing the one

2849
02:11:08,561 --> 02:11:09,351
shot.
Did you,

2850
02:11:09,351 --> 02:11:11,690
after it was done,
did you think like,

2851
02:11:11,750 --> 02:11:14,000
oh,
I wish I would have done that different

2852
02:11:14,001 --> 02:11:16,100
or this different?
Was there anything that you kind of wish

2853
02:11:16,130 --> 02:11:17,960
now looking at it that you did
different?

2854
02:11:18,080 --> 02:11:20,870
Other if you had the chance?
Of course.

2855
02:11:20,871 --> 02:11:22,280
I mean naturally,
you know,

2856
02:11:22,281 --> 02:11:25,330
after doing that,
I mean there's always like,

2857
02:11:25,550 --> 02:11:28,730
you know,
things that change are different.

2858
02:11:28,760 --> 02:11:31,070
Like for example,
like I close with,

2859
02:11:31,190 --> 02:11:34,580
you know,
even in March I had a different version

2860
02:11:34,610 --> 02:11:39,610
of the cosby thing that I do now.
But it totally different joke entirely.

2861
02:11:40,190 --> 02:11:41,990
You were like,
Bill Cosby's innocent.

2862
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:44,560
I know it's true.
Well,

2863
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:49,010
sort of it was because now in my cosby
joke now has everything to do with how

2864
02:11:49,011 --> 02:11:53,770
he admitted to giving girls Quaye lutes
and rape them and the cosby joke that's

2865
02:11:53,780 --> 02:11:54,710
on one shot.

2866
02:11:54,760 --> 02:11:59,510
It just covers the fact that like
basically it's all these little white

2867
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:03,890
girls that hooked up with a rich black
man for the first time and they just

2868
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:06,920
felt dizzy because his dick was so good.
That's right.

2869
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:09,950
So I just ruined the ending.
Is that A.

2870
02:12:09,951 --> 02:12:12,500
is that a real curl?
If you show the camera,

2871
02:12:12,510 --> 02:12:17,030
your curly hair with this one,
it looks like it's like a tightly curled

2872
02:12:17,610 --> 02:12:20,770
up in.
Sometimes if you have a bow now it's

2873
02:12:20,780 --> 02:12:25,190
just my curly Italian hair sometimes.
I remember when I had long hair.

2874
02:12:25,250 --> 02:12:26,083
Yeah,
that's right.

2875
02:12:26,110 --> 02:12:28,520
He's going to from my apologies.
All good.

2876
02:12:28,610 --> 02:12:29,990
That was a close one.
Oh,

2877
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:32,570
it was interfering with my ability to
form conversation.

2878
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:33,853
I was like,
Ooh,

2879
02:12:34,780 --> 02:12:36,380
yeah.
Maybe he's Brian Moses Story.

2880
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:40,580
Turn it planted the seed.
Maybe just let it go.

2881
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:42,350
Yeah.
That's not a good idea.

2882
02:12:42,660 --> 02:12:44,680
Imagine if we come in here and it smells
like piss everyday.

2883
02:12:45,350 --> 02:12:47,730
ASPARAGUS piss.
Hmm.

2884
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:49,070
Have you repeat herself?
Oh,

2885
02:12:49,071 --> 02:12:49,970
for sure.
Yeah.

2886
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:52,940
Who hasn't?
I mean and then had to wear your pants

2887
02:12:52,941 --> 02:12:53,810
for a long period

2888
02:12:53,870 --> 02:12:58,700
car once in a like a mountain dew bottle
or something like that.

2889
02:12:58,710 --> 02:13:00,690
Like whatever.
I had like some sort of a soda bottle

2890
02:13:01,030 --> 02:13:04,240
got pissed all over my Fiat.
It's really hard to do because you don't

2891
02:13:04,241 --> 02:13:09,241
realize that you need to have enough
extra air around it or else it just

2892
02:13:09,761 --> 02:13:13,150
sprays back at you.
I've done that three bottles.

2893
02:13:13,151 --> 02:13:14,410
Good.
Gatorade's good.

2894
02:13:14,411 --> 02:13:15,460
Yeah.
It's very girthy,

2895
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:17,073
gatorades.

2896
02:13:17,370 --> 02:13:20,730
Other ones you have to also use two
hands because you want to hold your Dick

2897
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:23,550
over the hole and you want to hold the
bottle and you can't do that while

2898
02:13:23,551 --> 02:13:27,180
you're driving so you're trying to like
get your Dick in between your two

2899
02:13:27,181 --> 02:13:32,181
fingers and then use your ring finger
and you're to kind of hold the bottle

2900
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:36,720
while you're squeezing your dick through
and don't put your balls in either,

2901
02:13:36,721 --> 02:13:38,340
just to keep those out when you're doing
it.

2902
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:39,580
There's no reason to put your policy in
there.

2903
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:42,540
Well,
you Brian can actually falls into a

2904
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:46,650
bottle of mountain dew unless you have a
moonshine jug and your truck.

2905
02:13:46,930 --> 02:13:50,460
Imagine if that's how you died.
You hit a bump in the moonshine jar,

2906
02:13:50,461 --> 02:13:53,040
broke and cut a vital artery under your
cock because you turn to

2907
02:13:54,530 --> 02:13:56,720
the mountain dews a dangerous bottle.
The pen,

2908
02:13:56,721 --> 02:13:59,680
because it's green,
so you may have forgotten that,

2909
02:13:59,681 --> 02:14:00,550
uh,
you know,

2910
02:14:00,551 --> 02:14:01,340
you peed in it.

2911
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:02,330
That's true.
That would be.

2912
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:03,650
You're just one of those fucking
Weirdos.

2913
02:14:03,651 --> 02:14:05,430
It picks up bottles on the floor of
your,

2914
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:08,870
your car and just start drinking warm
liquid and you can fuck up.

2915
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:11,690
Yeah.
I used to know this guy who would take a

2916
02:14:11,691 --> 02:14:14,990
mountain dew bottle of mountain dew or
Ginger Ale and he,

2917
02:14:15,020 --> 02:14:18,380
one of those green plastic bottles.
He would fill it up with booze and he

2918
02:14:18,381 --> 02:14:20,750
would drink it all day long.
He was like a serious,

2919
02:14:20,751 --> 02:14:24,680
serious alcoholic that I worked with on
this construction site when I was a kid.

2920
02:14:25,130 --> 02:14:25,911
It was weird,
man.

2921
02:14:25,911 --> 02:14:28,220
He would just drink all day.
It scared me,

2922
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:31,760
scare me watching him because this guy
who just drink this stuff all day and it

2923
02:14:31,761 --> 02:14:34,940
was only going a day or two into the job
that I realized that it was booze,

2924
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:38,840
talking to people that it was,
he would drink malt liquor and just all

2925
02:14:38,841 --> 02:14:39,830
day,
all day,

2926
02:14:39,831 --> 02:14:40,870
just drink a fucking.

2927
02:14:40,870 --> 02:14:43,370
And he lived in this house.
The house had no electricity,

2928
02:14:43,750 --> 02:14:45,320
um,
most of the windows were out,

2929
02:14:45,550 --> 02:14:47,720
like we were working on it.
We were renovating this house and he

2930
02:14:47,721 --> 02:14:51,410
lived in it while we were renovating it
and it was real weird and he was like a

2931
02:14:51,411 --> 02:14:53,630
construction guy.
He worked,

2932
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:57,380
he worked with the guy who owned the
construction company that was renovating

2933
02:14:57,381 --> 02:15:00,650
the House and I'm pretty sure as hard as
foggy to remember because I was a

2934
02:15:00,651 --> 02:15:02,480
teenager,
but I'm pretty sure the guy who was

2935
02:15:02,481 --> 02:15:04,940
renovating the house also owned it.
It was just like fixing it up.

2936
02:15:05,150 --> 02:15:08,930
And so this guy was living in it at the
time when it was like gutted out,

2937
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:13,140
just raw wood and no insulation.
Some windows are missing and just don't.

2938
02:15:13,310 --> 02:15:17,870
Some of the floor was missing and Scott
would just get wasted all day,

2939
02:15:17,871 --> 02:15:22,871
just drink and shake hands,
would shake any on hammer and nails and

2940
02:15:23,001 --> 02:15:26,770
shit and his hands are shaking,
carrying things out and it's just,

2941
02:15:26,870 --> 02:15:30,680
he,
he was just deep in the web of

2942
02:15:30,681 --> 02:15:31,760
addiction.
Yeah.

2943
02:15:32,190 --> 02:15:34,520
Did you ever see anybody like that when
you're young because you grew up in a

2944
02:15:34,521 --> 02:15:35,390
rough neighborhood,
right?

2945
02:15:35,850 --> 02:15:36,720
I,
uh,

2946
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:39,120
yeah.
I'm actually very close to somebody who,

2947
02:15:39,270 --> 02:15:41,930
who am I?
My oldest brother uh,

2948
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:47,720
became a slowly over time,
a big alcoholic and he's been a three

2949
02:15:48,211 --> 02:15:51,960
months sober now,
which is a miracle.

2950
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:56,100
Like it's unbelievable.
And because it seemed like he was never

2951
02:15:56,101 --> 02:16:01,101
going to stop and when he stopped
drinking he was shaking so

2952
02:16:01,861 --> 02:16:05,220
uncontrollably that he had to.
He couldn't even walk.

2953
02:16:05,730 --> 02:16:08,160
He would just fall down and he's a
strong guy.

2954
02:16:08,161 --> 02:16:11,880
This is a guy who like,
I remember going to Venice beach with

2955
02:16:11,881 --> 02:16:15,330
them when I came and visited,
just to check this place out when I was

2956
02:16:15,331 --> 02:16:16,890
18 to visit our other brother.
We,

2957
02:16:16,950 --> 02:16:19,140
me and my other,
me and my brother came out to visit our

2958
02:16:19,141 --> 02:16:23,250
brother that lived here and they played
basketball on Venice beach and they were

2959
02:16:23,251 --> 02:16:26,910
just balling all over everybody,
like he's an amazing athlete and this

2960
02:16:26,911 --> 02:16:28,680
and that and what he was doing that he
was drinking.

2961
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:30,070
Yeah,
but even still on that,

2962
02:16:30,071 --> 02:16:32,230
he was drinking at night.
Not during the,

2963
02:16:32,310 --> 02:16:33,190
the,
I mean,

2964
02:16:33,220 --> 02:16:34,600
yeah,
they were drinking during the day too.

2965
02:16:34,601 --> 02:16:37,570
It was so much booze that his body was
just completely hooked on it.

2966
02:16:37,630 --> 02:16:42,630
Totally Day every single day and night
because he was a professional bartender

2967
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:44,440
and in Columbus,
Columbus,

2968
02:16:44,441 --> 02:16:49,160
Ohio even has a big drinking culture,
like huge drinking culture park.

2969
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:51,710
Europe does huge.
And um,

2970
02:16:51,790 --> 02:16:55,210
he was like at the helm of it,
he's like the head bartender at all the

2971
02:16:55,211 --> 02:17:00,211
best places in Columbus over the past 20
years or whatever and that even Columbus

2972
02:17:01,181 --> 02:17:03,340
as a culture for it.
But also I don't think a lot of people

2973
02:17:03,341 --> 02:17:05,860
know that the restaurant industry has a
real,

2974
02:17:05,861 --> 02:17:07,360
real,
real culture for it.

2975
02:17:07,450 --> 02:17:11,680
Everybody that works in fine dining
restaurants goes out and gets shit faced

2976
02:17:11,681 --> 02:17:12,700
every year,
like 80,

2977
02:17:12,701 --> 02:17:16,240
90 percent of the people because you're
taking care of people all the time.

2978
02:17:16,660 --> 02:17:18,250
You need to get fucked up.
You need to.

2979
02:17:18,251 --> 02:17:20,800
You need to go get treated.
They walk in shot beer,

2980
02:17:20,801 --> 02:17:23,440
shot beer and then starting with
restaurant workers.

2981
02:17:23,441 --> 02:17:24,130
Right?
Huge,

2982
02:17:24,130 --> 02:17:25,600
huge.
Jeff's waitresses,

2983
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:29,200
bartenders,
huge culture of it and I'm sure Barnes

2984
02:17:29,201 --> 02:17:30,850
worth has to get liquored up once in a
while.

2985
02:17:30,851 --> 02:17:32,380
You know what I mean?
Barnes worth probably does.

2986
02:17:32,381 --> 02:17:36,580
Estrogen locks the door and just takes
extra shots,

2987
02:17:37,870 --> 02:17:39,460
drinks it.
But yeah,

2988
02:17:39,461 --> 02:17:40,360
to watch my,
you know,

2989
02:17:40,361 --> 02:17:43,540
physically powerful.
A brother will not watch,

2990
02:17:43,541 --> 02:17:46,300
but I heard about it because he's in
Columbus and I'm here,

2991
02:17:46,301 --> 02:17:48,310
but those dark.
But luckily he's.

2992
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:50,860
He's doing really good three months
sober,

2993
02:17:50,950 --> 02:17:53,770
which I,
if you would've told me three months ago

2994
02:17:53,771 --> 02:17:55,530
that he had actually stopped drinking.
You know,

2995
02:17:55,531 --> 02:17:57,190
I've gotTa said that's very hard to do.

2996
02:17:57,250 --> 02:18:00,790
I wonder if mushrooms were legal and if
they had real treatment centers,

2997
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:03,550
how many people would be curative
diseases like that.

2998
02:18:03,700 --> 02:18:05,710
I want to say diseases,
addictions like that.

2999
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:07,790
How many people would be cured of,
uh,

3000
02:18:08,170 --> 02:18:11,410
a lot of different things that they've
been struggling with psychologically,

3001
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:14,440
if they could use Ibogaine here in
America,

3002
02:18:14,470 --> 02:18:18,280
which is super effective in Mexico and a
lot of other countries where it's legal,

3003
02:18:18,281 --> 02:18:20,410
where they use it for treatment for
addictive diseases.

3004
02:18:20,530 --> 02:18:24,970
It's supposed to be incredible for
kicking people off of pills and opiates

3005
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:28,720
re literally reprograms your addictive
tendencies in your system.

3006
02:18:28,721 --> 02:18:31,660
Somehow with molly,
molly,

3007
02:18:32,050 --> 02:18:34,900
molly related,
they said that too about ptsd for

3008
02:18:34,901 --> 02:18:36,850
soldiers.
That molly's giant for that

3009
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:40,010
the government paid for tests on
psilocybin.

3010
02:18:40,011 --> 02:18:44,900
It like Carnegie or Harvard or Cornell
or some stuff and they kept finding that

3011
02:18:44,901 --> 02:18:49,901
it cured chronic depression on people
that like they had given up and just

3012
02:18:49,911 --> 02:18:51,020
said,
it's for life.

3013
02:18:51,021 --> 02:18:53,220
You're going to be depressed for life
programs.

3014
02:18:53,270 --> 02:18:58,050
Totally see why I'm reprograms your
brain apps.

3015
02:18:58,070 --> 02:19:01,040
It's like a shower for your brain,
like when everything's just too

3016
02:19:01,041 --> 02:19:04,220
cluttered and dirty.
It's the only real analogy that I think

3017
02:19:04,250 --> 02:19:06,740
is effective for mushrooms.
It's like a brain shower.

3018
02:19:07,390 --> 02:19:11,750
It did this thing that I absolutely love
that I found out about a couple of years

3019
02:19:11,750 --> 02:19:14,990
ago called Neti Pot,
you know about that run warm water

3020
02:19:14,991 --> 02:19:18,650
through your nasal passage and it's the
same thing like I think to myself every

3021
02:19:18,651 --> 02:19:20,750
time I do it,
like I can't believe people don't know

3022
02:19:20,751 --> 02:19:22,670
about this because you know the squeeze
one.

3023
02:19:22,700 --> 02:19:23,630
Yeah,
that's what I have.

3024
02:19:24,220 --> 02:19:26,000
That's what I have for you.
Blasted up there.

3025
02:19:26,030 --> 02:19:27,800
Oh my God.
It'd be was crazy.

3026
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:31,700
I remember I used to use that when I had
my nose operation when I had my nose

3027
02:19:31,701 --> 02:19:34,730
chewed open.
I had a really bad scar tissue inside my

3028
02:19:34,731 --> 02:19:38,320
nose and I had a deviated septum and a
lot of the scar tissue was like a.

3029
02:19:38,450 --> 02:19:41,750
It comes calcified because if you've
been hitting the nose a few times,

3030
02:19:41,751 --> 02:19:44,600
if it bleeds inside your nose,
it's like cauliflower ear,

3031
02:19:44,690 --> 02:19:47,110
but inside your nose,
this is a cutaway.

3032
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:51,140
All this different tissue and open up
this passage and then to clean it,

3033
02:19:51,141 --> 02:19:54,020
I used to use a waterpik so it squirt
the water,

3034
02:19:54,021 --> 02:19:57,710
pick up one nostril and it'd be pouring
out the other nostril and I would blow

3035
02:19:57,711 --> 02:20:02,390
out these fucking titanic boogers.
They looked like they were from another

3036
02:20:02,391 --> 02:20:04,520
planet.
There were giant and covered in blood

3037
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:07,490
and they were like the size of a thumb.
Like they would come out and I would

3038
02:20:07,491 --> 02:20:08,324
treasure them.

3039
02:20:08,510 --> 02:20:10,250
I'd be like,
I want everybody to see this.

3040
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:14,170
It was like at your Dick pic back in the
day I showed.

3041
02:20:14,990 --> 02:20:17,830
I opened up the Napkin Forum,
did Tom's cigar and he went

3042
02:20:20,980 --> 02:20:22,820
over in the airport.
I'll never forget it.

3043
02:20:23,180 --> 02:20:23,841
I go,
dude,

3044
02:20:23,841 --> 02:20:26,330
I just fucking blew the most insane
booger out of my nose.

3045
02:20:26,331 --> 02:20:27,051
I go,
do you want to see it?

3046
02:20:27,051 --> 02:20:27,760
He goes,
AH,

3047
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:31,930
okay.
I'll open it up and it's like this.

3048
02:20:32,060 --> 02:20:35,660
It's like rubber cement glue.
So like as you pull the page on the side

3049
02:20:35,661 --> 02:20:39,560
that the Burger was so big that it just
didn't seem like it come out of a human.

3050
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:44,640
Didn't make any sense and he's
immediately have.

3051
02:20:45,521 --> 02:20:47,060
You have to get that done though,
folks,

3052
02:20:47,061 --> 02:20:49,400
if you find a good doctor.
I know some people have had bad

3053
02:20:49,401 --> 02:20:52,310
experiences with a doctor that didn't
really know what they're doing.

3054
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:56,540
That was a life changer for me to get my
nose cleaned up so I could breathe

3055
02:20:57,440 --> 02:20:58,580
in Neti pot.
I mean,

3056
02:20:58,610 --> 02:20:59,040
uh,
you know,

3057
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:01,200
you got to do it right.
You gotta make sure you put the packet

3058
02:21:01,201 --> 02:21:03,390
in and use distilled water and warm it
up.

3059
02:21:03,391 --> 02:21:05,310
And I mean,
it's one of those things too where when

3060
02:21:05,311 --> 02:21:06,360
I do it,
I'm like,

3061
02:21:06,420 --> 02:21:08,340
Ooh,
tonight's going to be a good night.

3062
02:21:08,420 --> 02:21:09,570
It.
If you have a broken nose,

3063
02:21:09,571 --> 02:21:11,860
that's still not going to work.
If someone did,

3064
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:15,030
you need to get that operation.
If you have a deviated septum so you

3065
02:21:15,031 --> 02:21:17,640
can't,
you really can't like do yoga correctly

3066
02:21:17,730 --> 02:21:21,360
without breathing in through your nose.
It kept me from doing yoga a lot because

3067
02:21:21,361 --> 02:21:22,720
they would always tell me,
you have to breathe that.

3068
02:21:22,721 --> 02:21:23,400
He knows.
I'm like,

3069
02:21:23,400 --> 02:21:25,090
I don't have one.
It doesn't.

3070
02:21:25,091 --> 02:21:27,960
It doesn't exist.
I could smell a few things,

3071
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:31,830
but it's just jacked in there,
so Neti pots wouldn't have worked.

3072
02:21:31,890 --> 02:21:33,300
It just.
It just wouldn't have worked,

3073
02:21:33,450 --> 02:21:35,190
but now that it's clean works.
Awesome.

3074
02:21:35,450 --> 02:21:38,760
Yeah,
so salt water to pour those little salt

3075
02:21:38,761 --> 02:21:42,150
packets in the water and shake it up.
It's my favorite fucking thing.

3076
02:21:42,210 --> 02:21:44,760
Do you ever find yourself,
don't you bend over to tie your shoes

3077
02:21:44,761 --> 02:21:47,610
like Oh,
an hour later and some water leaks out

3078
02:21:47,611 --> 02:21:50,970
of your nose a little bit.
Where the fuck was that water hide in

3079
02:21:50,971 --> 02:21:54,330
the corner of a hole in my head.
Maybe store in water.

3080
02:21:54,630 --> 02:21:56,520
Like I bent over to tie my shoes and I
was like,

3081
02:21:56,521 --> 02:21:58,200
what is this drip drip,
drip,

3082
02:21:58,201 --> 02:21:58,561
drip,
drip,

3083
02:21:58,561 --> 02:21:58,921
drip,
drip.

3084
02:21:58,921 --> 02:21:59,260
Drip

3085
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:02,190
happened to me during that set,
like just one little drop,

3086
02:22:02,191 --> 02:22:03,870
but that's that last night when that
ladies like,

3087
02:22:03,871 --> 02:22:04,620
no,
trump's,

3088
02:22:04,620 --> 02:22:07,980
you're never going to.
It came out of nowhere like bloop and

3089
02:22:07,981 --> 02:22:08,400
I'm like,

3090
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:11,160
what is salty?
You get it gives grab someone like that

3091
02:22:11,161 --> 02:22:14,070
and take them out of the room.
You can't interrupt the show like that.

3092
02:22:14,071 --> 02:22:17,060
That's so stupid because that's one
person that the Irvine Improv,

3093
02:22:17,100 --> 02:22:21,120
500 people,
so it's one person deciding that in 500

3094
02:22:21,121 --> 02:22:24,240
people that I'm sure a giant percentage
of more laughing because I know the bits

3095
02:22:24,241 --> 02:22:25,074
hilarious.
Oh,

3096
02:22:25,510 --> 02:22:28,830
it was insane.
That's why like people were booing her

3097
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:32,650
before I even said,
what's your problem lady like it was

3098
02:22:32,690 --> 02:22:36,420
just can't have to deal with that.
Just people don't get it because they

3099
02:22:36,421 --> 02:22:37,860
look at you and they go,
he's just talking,

3100
02:22:37,940 --> 02:22:38,761
right?
They go,

3101
02:22:38,761 --> 02:22:40,620
Oh man,
he's going to make people in this room

3102
02:22:40,621 --> 02:22:41,850
vote for trump.
It's like,

3103
02:22:41,851 --> 02:22:44,460
no lady.
You're the only one that's not realizing

3104
02:22:44,461 --> 02:22:46,320
that you're at a professional show right
now.

3105
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:47,520
Well,
not only that,

3106
02:22:47,730 --> 02:22:50,970
how,
how weak is your candidate.

3107
02:22:51,090 --> 02:22:53,200
A comedian could talk you out of it and
goes,

3108
02:22:54,210 --> 02:22:57,570
fuck these poor people.
Bernie Sanders is an old loser.

3109
02:22:57,910 --> 02:23:01,170
Donald Trump's right.
Do you think trump really wants to be

3110
02:23:01,171 --> 02:23:03,990
president because it seems like he's
going to be.

3111
02:23:04,380 --> 02:23:06,840
Yeah.
I'm not bullshitting people like you're

3112
02:23:06,841 --> 02:23:07,770
wrong.
You're wrong.

3113
02:23:08,910 --> 02:23:11,400
He is way out ahead on the republican
side.

3114
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:13,380
Yeah,
and more people are willing to vote

3115
02:23:13,381 --> 02:23:15,480
Republican now than before Obama was in
office.

3116
02:23:15,481 --> 02:23:18,390
There's a lot of people that have
strengthened the resolve against

3117
02:23:18,391 --> 02:23:22,110
liberals and against the left and
against the Democratic Party.

3118
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:23,910
It's highly.
If he just.

3119
02:23:24,330 --> 02:23:26,790
If he just changes his tune on a few
things,

3120
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:30,150
he could get me know if he needs to
change his tune.

3121
02:23:30,180 --> 02:23:34,410
He's saying stuff that I think a lot of
people are thinking.

3122
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:37,140
That's one of my alien bugger.
Oh my God,

3123
02:23:37,770 --> 02:23:40,890
that's a bugger.
That was a bugger isn't it?

3124
02:23:40,891 --> 02:23:42,780
Looked like a cockroach nest or
something.

3125
02:23:43,380 --> 02:23:46,320
So look at my hand.
Looks like one of the planets from Star

3126
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:50,090
Wars.
Look at my hand here to wean the thing

3127
02:23:50,110 --> 02:23:54,450
that you can get a good because that's
the kind of a inflated picture,

3128
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:56,150
but you could see how big that was.
It was like that,

3129
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:59,710
but that is a real booger.
That and that was a little dry like it

3130
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:02,100
when it came out like maybe a minute or
two before that.

3131
02:24:02,101 --> 02:24:07,101
It was a little larger that when you had
that crazy shit the other day and you're

3132
02:24:07,381 --> 02:24:09,270
like pushing your kids out of your way
and everything,

3133
02:24:09,271 --> 02:24:10,940
do you remember what you ate or what
causes?

3134
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:14,730
My God,
that's the one that made Tommy gag

3135
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:19,740
because that's the one that made Tommy
Gaggs God.

3136
02:24:19,890 --> 02:24:24,570
He was like,
I took a photo of it in the bathroom.

3137
02:24:24,571 --> 02:24:28,920
Then I put it in a Napkin and I brought
it out to them that weren't really.

3138
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:32,190
Is that something else?
What did you ask?

3139
02:24:32,220 --> 02:24:34,590
What did you just ask?
What made that crazy shit that you're

3140
02:24:34,591 --> 02:24:36,500
talking about?
Oil.

3141
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:41,870
Pretty sure I had too much mct oil.
If you put too much mct oil in a kale

3142
02:24:42,271 --> 02:24:43,950
shake or a protein shake or something
like that.

3143
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:45,630
Occasionally there's like a tipping
point.

3144
02:24:45,870 --> 02:24:48,730
I don't know like how many cups is like
I should probably figure out like what's

3145
02:24:48,731 --> 02:24:53,040
a beneficial dose instead of just adding
cap foals and I might have added an

3146
02:24:53,041 --> 02:24:57,690
extra cap full and I might have drinking
much more than I usually drank and a

3147
02:24:57,691 --> 02:25:02,540
whatever it was the fucking click,
the sear snapped and the fuck.

3148
02:25:02,610 --> 02:25:06,840
Oh,
it's funny,

3149
02:25:06,841 --> 02:25:08,940
Max,
when you have five year olds,

3150
02:25:08,941 --> 02:25:11,850
they don't want to hear nothing.
Like you can't say the house is on fire,

3151
02:25:11,851 --> 02:25:13,890
but Daddy,
I can't find my toy.

3152
02:25:14,030 --> 02:25:16,740
Like whatever they're dealing with is
like so critically important.

3153
02:25:16,741 --> 02:25:17,680
I'm like,
I got to get it.

3154
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:19,230
I'm going to shit on you.
How many shit.

3155
02:25:19,231 --> 02:25:21,810
I knew your faces.
Where my ass is.

3156
02:25:21,830 --> 02:25:22,663
You've got to get out of.

3157
02:25:25,370 --> 02:25:28,320
Can't stop it.
Like I was with all my bike,

3158
02:25:28,350 --> 02:25:31,740
my bike.
I was tightening up a massive crowds

3159
02:25:32,070 --> 02:25:35,290
squat you've ever done in your life
counts for this moment.

3160
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:37,960
The cramps when I was like,
oh no,

3161
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:40,630
I don't know if we're going to make it.
There was that moment where I was like,

3162
02:25:40,631 --> 02:25:42,340
I'm going to shit at least a little bit
in my pants.

3163
02:25:42,490 --> 02:25:46,220
Maybe we'll just let the prisoners out.
A few hostages out.

3164
02:25:46,221 --> 02:25:48,220
And then we renegotiate.
Once I get to the bathroom,

3165
02:25:48,970 --> 02:25:52,720
I managed to keep it together just right
to that point where I was born.

3166
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:53,880
Yeah.

3167
02:25:53,880 --> 02:25:57,210
Can you just hear Mike Goldberg's voice?
It's all over.

3168
02:25:58,720 --> 02:25:59,960
Um,
mct oil though.

3169
02:25:59,961 --> 02:26:02,120
We'll make you shit yourself.
Well,

3170
02:26:02,180 --> 02:26:04,010
you have to be careful.
You have too much of it.

3171
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:07,100
It will definitely.
It just lives up the old pipes and just

3172
02:26:07,130 --> 02:26:10,130
releases the hounds,
but it's probably a good thing because

3173
02:26:10,131 --> 02:26:12,640
once it goes through like a blast out
boy feel.

3174
02:26:13,080 --> 02:26:17,580
I've been taking healthier poops than
ever lately with this new meat in flux.

3175
02:26:17,581 --> 02:26:22,400
My body is just loving it.
They're so solid that every time now,

3176
02:26:22,401 --> 02:26:24,490
every time I take a poop,
you know when the.

3177
02:26:24,670 --> 02:26:28,460
When you get the splash back to I'm at.
I'm at $100.

3178
02:26:28,670 --> 02:26:32,030
I get.
I'm at 100 percent slash back now.

3179
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:34,610
Have you ever gone back?
Have you ever had your Bible Open up

3180
02:26:34,611 --> 02:26:36,760
enough?
Just after it splashes and gets a little

3181
02:26:36,770 --> 02:26:39,700
teardrop inside the net.
A little bit comes out later when you

3182
02:26:39,720 --> 02:26:40,553
retire.
Shifts.

3183
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:48,300
Dilly vegetables though.
You still emotionally?

3184
02:26:48,430 --> 02:26:49,980
Totally.
I'm definitely look different.

3185
02:26:50,010 --> 02:26:52,380
I'm not bullshitting.
Your face looks filled here and I

3186
02:26:52,381 --> 02:26:54,300
haven't even had breakfast or lunch
today.

3187
02:26:54,720 --> 02:26:59,040
You look like your face looks thicker.
I feel better.

3188
02:26:59,100 --> 02:27:01,200
Yeah.
Vegans right now are so angry.

3189
02:27:01,410 --> 02:27:02,850
No,
you just stay the course.

3190
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:05,250
You just didn't follow the right.
You didn't have enough keen one,

3191
02:27:05,251 --> 02:27:06,830
your diet.
What about Avocados?

3192
02:27:07,290 --> 02:27:08,820
What about olive oil?
Hey,

3193
02:27:08,821 --> 02:27:10,650
Mr. Verge on.
It's been.

3194
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:13,050
It's been a lot of fun to get back
because I love food.

3195
02:27:13,051 --> 02:27:16,680
I'm huge on food.
When you guys went to Fogo de Chao,

3196
02:27:16,681 --> 02:27:17,910
right?
That's where you broke your cherry,

3197
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:20,010
which is meat lovers paradise.

3198
02:27:20,370 --> 02:27:24,210
I've been there for a child a couple of
times with you without eating meat and

3199
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:25,710
salad.

3200
02:27:25,710 --> 02:27:28,480
It's amazing.
You could easily fill up on the salad

3201
02:27:28,481 --> 02:27:32,230
bar with no fucking meat whatsoever.
It's a great restaurant.

3202
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:34,000
Yeah.
Those Brazilians know how to eat,

3203
02:27:34,001 --> 02:27:34,840
man.
The two.

3204
02:27:34,841 --> 02:27:37,870
Haas Korea's.
They're amazing that if you don't know

3205
02:27:37,871 --> 02:27:39,520
what it is,
there's Fogo de Chao,

3206
02:27:39,550 --> 02:27:41,380
Texas de Brazil.
Those are the chains,

3207
02:27:41,381 --> 02:27:44,890
but there's a bunch of independent.
You asked her ears and a Brazilian style

3208
02:27:44,891 --> 02:27:47,110
barbecue.
What it is is you have a chip and one

3209
02:27:47,111 --> 02:27:49,960
side is green and the other side is red
and when it's green they come over with

3210
02:27:49,961 --> 02:27:54,961
these trays of meats like sausages and
chicken wrapped in Bacon and Full Layman

3211
02:27:56,820 --> 02:28:00,430
Yon and p Kanya,
which is like top Sirloin,

3212
02:28:00,431 --> 02:28:02,200
which is like the best one.
That's the best.

3213
02:28:02,201 --> 02:28:04,900
Hide that one all the time.
There's just so many people want it.

3214
02:28:05,350 --> 02:28:07,060
And there is the place you used.
We used to go to.

3215
02:28:07,061 --> 02:28:07,900
That was called [inaudible].

3216
02:28:08,140 --> 02:28:09,070
Where was that?
Oh,

3217
02:28:09,071 --> 02:28:10,800
that's in Pasadena?
No,

3218
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:11,501
no.
Uh,

3219
02:28:11,501 --> 02:28:12,334
Burbank.
Yeah.

3220
02:28:12,370 --> 02:28:13,060
Burbank.
Right.

3221
02:28:13,060 --> 02:28:14,650
Is there a place in Burbank called
Pecan?

3222
02:28:14,651 --> 02:28:15,520
Yeah.
Where was that?

3223
02:28:15,970 --> 02:28:19,150
I think it's in Burbank.
I think there's a place in Burbank

3224
02:28:19,151 --> 02:28:20,470
called pecan yet,
but it's the same,

3225
02:28:20,620 --> 02:28:21,260
isn't it?
Yeah.

3226
02:28:21,260 --> 02:28:23,090
Yeah.
Same style food.

3227
02:28:23,091 --> 02:28:24,860
It's fucking so good.
Yeah.

3228
02:28:24,861 --> 02:28:28,820
So they come over with these,
these pitchforks with meat on them.

3229
02:28:28,821 --> 02:28:30,950
These skewers with meat on them and
slice it off.

3230
02:28:31,010 --> 02:28:32,330
Yeah.
That's the one on the right.

3231
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:35,620
A Bay hide it.
But uh,

3232
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:38,270
if you like meat,
you got to go at least once.

3233
02:28:38,830 --> 02:28:40,250
It's Pr.
It's so good though too.

3234
02:28:40,251 --> 02:28:43,910
They figured out the right way to baste
it in front of an open fire.

3235
02:28:44,620 --> 02:28:48,320
Now they slowly cook it so good.
And it's unlike a regular stick with.

3236
02:28:48,321 --> 02:28:50,750
They come over and they slice pieces on
the outside and they put them on your

3237
02:28:50,751 --> 02:28:52,640
plate and then they go back to cooking
it again.

3238
02:28:52,970 --> 02:28:56,900
Like they based it again with their
whatever they have that it's like a salt

3239
02:28:56,901 --> 02:29:01,250
and some sort of an oil to it and bred
in 13 days.

3240
02:29:02,170 --> 02:29:06,440
You to.
When you came to the comedy store the

3241
02:29:06,441 --> 02:29:07,670
other night,
we were all saying that.

3242
02:29:07,740 --> 02:29:09,360
Yeah,
I could clearly see it.

3243
02:29:09,361 --> 02:29:12,540
You were glowing the other day.
I even went home and mentioned to my

3244
02:29:12,541 --> 02:29:13,291
girlfriend.
I'm like,

3245
02:29:13,291 --> 02:29:16,130
Brian looked good today and you just say
that while you were inside her.

3246
02:29:16,690 --> 02:29:17,940
She goes,
she goes,

3247
02:29:17,941 --> 02:29:18,810
what do you mean?
I go,

3248
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:22,470
he's been working out for like 24 hours
and he already looks better.

3249
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:25,050
She goes,
that's impossible.

3250
02:29:25,051 --> 02:29:25,711
I go,
no.

3251
02:29:25,711 --> 02:29:30,060
I just think Brian was so unhealthy that
literally if he doesn't poison himself

3252
02:29:30,061 --> 02:29:35,061
for like a few hours,
you start to turn into Tom Hardy or

3253
02:29:35,191 --> 02:29:36,024
something.

3254
02:29:36,070 --> 02:29:38,430
It's great.
You're doing so much good shit.

3255
02:29:38,431 --> 02:29:40,420
Now you taking care of yourself.
You're.

3256
02:29:40,840 --> 02:29:44,570
You're on the side kick that's lasted
through the entire month of December or

3257
02:29:44,570 --> 02:29:46,800
January.
Whether you're doing your podcast now,

3258
02:29:46,801 --> 02:29:48,780
like so much good shit's happening.
That's awesome.

3259
02:29:49,380 --> 02:29:50,370
It's awesome,
man.

3260
02:29:51,410 --> 02:29:53,900
Feel Jon Benet Ramsey,
you know,

3261
02:29:54,180 --> 02:29:55,500
you feel lighter.
What does that mean?

3262
02:29:56,470 --> 02:30:00,300
What does a Ramsey me?
What does that mean?

3263
02:30:01,490 --> 02:30:02,323
Good,
fucked.

3264
02:30:02,650 --> 02:30:06,420
No,
I don't know what.

3265
02:30:06,450 --> 02:30:09,190
That doesn't make any sense.
He's laughing to cover up as.

3266
02:30:09,220 --> 02:30:13,110
I don't know what was like the joker now
from

3267
02:30:14,860 --> 02:30:17,460
that joker photo I made of Tony.
Uh,

3268
02:30:17,461 --> 02:30:19,350
that's crazy.
Have you seen that photo?

3269
02:30:19,360 --> 02:30:21,630
That's like one of my dreams is I want
to play.

3270
02:30:22,290 --> 02:30:24,540
I want to go onstage.
Yeah,

3271
02:30:24,690 --> 02:30:25,381
yeah,
yeah.

3272
02:30:25,381 --> 02:30:29,720
I really want to be like the next joke
or I think they think Nicolas,

3273
02:30:29,740 --> 02:30:34,740
what Nicholson did is amazing and I
think what a heath ledger did is great.

3274
02:30:35,370 --> 02:30:38,130
And uh,
I'd love to eventually get to the point

3275
02:30:38,131 --> 02:30:39,640
to where down the road,
you know,

3276
02:30:39,800 --> 02:30:42,510
it could be like a young joker.
That's totally possible,

3277
02:30:42,511 --> 02:30:44,250
especially if they keep making more
Batman's.

3278
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:48,060
And I think like,
especially if I keep growing as a

3279
02:30:48,061 --> 02:30:50,490
popular comedian,
I think it's like a cool twist.

3280
02:30:50,491 --> 02:30:51,360
Like,
you know,

3281
02:30:51,660 --> 02:30:54,960
marvel hires actual comedian to put the
joker.

3282
02:30:55,560 --> 02:30:57,260
Who Better?
Who better stand up,

3283
02:30:57,270 --> 02:30:59,010
comedian turned evil.
Look at you,

3284
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:02,100
insult comic,
feel it turned evil.

3285
02:31:02,490 --> 02:31:02,960
Dude,
you're,

3286
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:05,730
you're porn for that room.
Tie first before you

3287
02:31:07,410 --> 02:31:08,370
come on.
Brian.

3288
02:31:08,400 --> 02:31:09,700
Brian,
if you break your diet,

3289
02:31:10,220 --> 02:31:12,600
you're doing so good in this house.
What happened?

3290
02:31:13,120 --> 02:31:16,080
We're going to go bad on
Tony.

3291
02:31:16,081 --> 02:31:18,510
You've always felt like you've,
you're going to die young and stuff,

3292
02:31:18,511 --> 02:31:20,040
but you always talking about like,
like

3293
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:22,370
notes on me over there.
What are you doing?

3294
02:31:22,530 --> 02:31:24,240
Just checking.
You're a fucking wikipedia.

3295
02:31:24,310 --> 02:31:27,570
Has
Brian made that to promote the.

3296
02:31:27,770 --> 02:31:32,770
It's more like a Zombie Jared leto joker
that he made.

3297
02:31:32,871 --> 02:31:34,260
That's not the right.
Oh,

3298
02:31:34,650 --> 02:31:37,050
well Jaron Leno's joker like pretty
fucking deal too.

3299
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:40,080
So he's the joker in the suicide squad.
Was another one that got.

3300
02:31:40,110 --> 02:31:42,360
He got ripped for that.
Why?

3301
02:31:43,290 --> 02:31:46,500
Because the joker is a bad motherfucker.
The joker's the best bad guy of all

3302
02:31:46,501 --> 02:31:48,000
time.
Why did he get report?

3303
02:31:48,510 --> 02:31:50,130
Uh,
you got to look that up.

3304
02:31:50,220 --> 02:31:51,001
Um,
because,

3305
02:31:51,001 --> 02:31:53,790
uh,
because the joker is a bad motherfucker.

3306
02:31:53,820 --> 02:31:56,820
Like normally it was a bad motherfucker
as an actor.

3307
02:31:56,880 --> 02:32:00,660
Totally come on.
But there's a thing where like,

3308
02:32:00,661 --> 02:32:04,470
he shows himself working out in the,
in a superman shirt or something.

3309
02:32:04,530 --> 02:32:08,160
Anyway,
a problem with people just look for Shit

3310
02:32:08,161 --> 02:32:09,600
to complain about.
No,

3311
02:32:09,620 --> 02:32:10,650
it's good.
It's a good thing.

3312
02:32:11,010 --> 02:32:13,380
It's amazing,
like he's pumped.

3313
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:14,930
Whoa.
That totally could be used,

3314
02:32:14,931 --> 02:32:15,650
Tony.
Totally.

3315
02:32:15,650 --> 02:32:19,560
Especially now with your new Diet and
you're looking at lifting a little Tush,

3316
02:32:19,590 --> 02:32:21,240
what kind of car is that?
What does that.

3317
02:32:21,241 --> 02:32:23,760
Is that a real car?
A PONTIAC?

3318
02:32:25,010 --> 02:32:25,843
Jamie.

3319
02:32:27,480 --> 02:32:29,310
See they're probably introduce some new
car.

3320
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:31,200
They do that sometimes we'll click on
it.

3321
02:32:31,201 --> 02:32:32,460
I'm assuming.
Is that an Acura Nsx?

3322
02:32:32,461 --> 02:32:33,750
No,
that's a Jaguar,

3323
02:32:33,751 --> 02:32:34,770
right?
What is it?

3324
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:40,880
Does it say so cool.
What does it fade or Aveda?

3325
02:32:43,050 --> 02:32:44,160
Huh?
Oh,

3326
02:32:44,230 --> 02:32:46,800
okay.
Some car I'd never heard of.

3327
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:50,940
So neat.
Tony Hinchcliffe.

3328
02:32:50,941 --> 02:32:52,510
We're starting to make some money now.
You're bowling.

3329
02:32:52,910 --> 02:32:54,390
Going to get a new automobile.
Tony.

3330
02:32:54,391 --> 02:32:56,610
Angela Bay door.
You gotta get a new vehicle.

3331
02:32:57,230 --> 02:32:58,950
Um,
maybe.

3332
02:32:59,100 --> 02:33:01,740
Maybe I can see Tony in a corvette.
Oh God,

3333
02:33:01,741 --> 02:33:04,410
I'd love on those ones.
No backseat.

3334
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:05,480
Sorry.
Oh,

3335
02:33:05,700 --> 02:33:07,260
sorry.
Your friends can't come.

3336
02:33:07,380 --> 02:33:10,080
I want one so bad.
But I have to be smart.

3337
02:33:10,780 --> 02:33:14,310
But the truth a little bit for it until
at least until Friday.

3338
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:16,980
January 13.
I want to spend.

3339
02:33:17,020 --> 02:33:18,920
When you knew nothing special comes out.
Yeah.

3340
02:33:18,990 --> 02:33:20,640
So what it is the 13th.
Is that what I say?

3341
02:33:20,650 --> 02:33:21,330
Fifteen,
15,

3342
02:33:21,330 --> 02:33:22,590
two days away?
How did I get it wrong?

3343
02:33:22,591 --> 02:33:26,700
Both times by three?
I said 18 and 13 to 1:15,

3344
02:33:26,730 --> 02:33:29,340
2016.
Our two by two I can't even count.

3345
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:33,750
And a lot of uh,
cool guest appearances in it.

3346
02:33:33,751 --> 02:33:34,920
Like a,
um,

3347
02:33:35,130 --> 02:33:40,130
Joey Diaz brings me onstage and Brian
Red Ban I high five because he goes in

3348
02:33:41,190 --> 02:33:45,030
and goes up after me while check drop
happens and stuff because it was a real

3349
02:33:45,031 --> 02:33:45,864
show.
Right.

3350
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:47,910
And uh,
do you,

3351
02:33:47,911 --> 02:33:50,580
um,
did you feel more comfortable because it

3352
02:33:50,581 --> 02:33:53,850
was at the Ice House place you performed
countless times.

3353
02:33:53,870 --> 02:33:56,420
Oh yeah,
no doubt about it at home.

3354
02:33:56,910 --> 02:33:59,160
Two weeks out when I booked it,
which by the way,

3355
02:33:59,161 --> 02:34:03,120
super huge shout out for the Ice House.
Sean Sullivan over there two weeks out

3356
02:34:03,121 --> 02:34:05,970
goes two weeks before I shot this.
He goes,

3357
02:34:05,971 --> 02:34:06,721
Hey,
you want a headline?

3358
02:34:06,721 --> 02:34:08,640
The Ice House to Saturday,
7:30.

3359
02:34:08,670 --> 02:34:09,930
I go,
ies,

3360
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:13,050
and quick question,
would you mind if I taped it with one

3361
02:34:13,051 --> 02:34:15,630
camera in an attempt to shoot a special?
And he goes,

3362
02:34:15,930 --> 02:34:17,680
absolutely,
that'd awesome.

3363
02:34:17,740 --> 02:34:18,573
I go,

3364
02:34:18,770 --> 02:34:19,620
oh,
okay.

3365
02:34:20,530 --> 02:34:21,363
Okay.
Bye.

3366
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:22,890
Like,
you know,

3367
02:34:22,890 --> 02:34:24,900
the rest is history.
He was there that night.

3368
02:34:24,901 --> 02:34:25,750
In fact.
Well,

3369
02:34:25,810 --> 02:34:28,410
fun fact about that is if you noticed
when we saw the trailer,

3370
02:34:28,411 --> 02:34:30,330
there was one guy that's sort of like
walked off.

3371
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:31,950
That's Shawn,
which I think is so cool.

3372
02:34:31,951 --> 02:34:34,020
It's like a perfect little tiny,
tiny,

3373
02:34:34,021 --> 02:34:36,330
tiny cameo you have.
You'd have to really pause it at the

3374
02:34:36,331 --> 02:34:39,330
right moment to see him.
But he was so responsible for it

3375
02:34:39,331 --> 02:34:40,730
happening.
And uh,

3376
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:41,700
wait,
what was the question?

3377
02:34:41,700 --> 02:34:43,240
Oh yeah.
Being comfortable with the ice houses

3378
02:34:43,260 --> 02:34:46,140
with the two weeks notice that I had.
I literally,

3379
02:34:46,141 --> 02:34:51,000
I'm not even kidding or exaggerating in
my dreams at night was envisioning it

3380
02:34:51,001 --> 02:34:51,910
and I'd like,
you know,

3381
02:34:51,980 --> 02:34:54,740
it would be a nightmare or a great dream
depending on.

3382
02:34:55,250 --> 02:34:58,200
But I was like picturing it and during
the day I was picturing it and where I

3383
02:34:58,201 --> 02:35:00,930
wanted the steady cam to be because,
you know,

3384
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:02,790
Ben Wolfensohn,
my really good friend,

3385
02:35:02,791 --> 02:35:07,791
amazing director directed the beginning
of a Ari Shaffir special and uh,

3386
02:35:08,220 --> 02:35:10,980
and um,
trip tank on comedy central.

3387
02:35:12,060 --> 02:35:12,893
But like,
you know,

3388
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:15,840
this was my idea of shooting it all in
one shot.

3389
02:35:15,890 --> 02:35:18,440
It's a great idea.
That's a great way to also to capitalize

3390
02:35:18,441 --> 02:35:19,310
on that small club.

3391
02:35:20,190 --> 02:35:20,731
Right.
Well,

3392
02:35:20,731 --> 02:35:23,970
I knew I had to do something special
that really stand out,

3393
02:35:24,030 --> 02:35:25,620
you know what I mean?
Because I don't have,

3394
02:35:25,700 --> 02:35:28,050
you know,
tv fame or anything like that.

3395
02:35:28,051 --> 02:35:29,320
That's so many,
you know,

3396
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:31,140
networks and everything

3397
02:35:31,180 --> 02:35:34,420
looks for anything that anybody's going
to view it based on the fact that you

3398
02:35:34,421 --> 02:35:36,030
shot in one shot.
I think

3399
02:35:36,060 --> 02:35:39,380
more people.
I think that's why they got it.

3400
02:35:39,410 --> 02:35:40,730
I don't think they're like,
you know,

3401
02:35:40,760 --> 02:35:42,290
let's,
let's take this.

3402
02:35:42,291 --> 02:35:43,100
Nobody out it

3403
02:35:43,100 --> 02:35:44,460
nowhere.
And you know what it means.

3404
02:35:44,710 --> 02:35:45,800
You're funny.
You stopped.

3405
02:35:45,801 --> 02:35:47,720
That's bullshit.
You ain't got it anyway.

3406
02:35:47,721 --> 02:35:49,430
If you did that thing at the Irvine
Improv,

3407
02:35:49,450 --> 02:35:51,170
you,
you would have still sold to Netflix.

3408
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:53,000
You're very funny.
You're very funny.

3409
02:35:53,001 --> 02:35:54,620
You're doing great and you have heat
behind you.

3410
02:35:54,920 --> 02:35:57,800
You have heat behind you and you
connected to a network of other

3411
02:35:57,801 --> 02:36:01,820
comedians that have heat behind them.
That's another thing that I'm so honored

3412
02:36:01,880 --> 02:36:03,230
to be up there with Sigur.
Uh,

3413
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:06,710
you know who joe,
who's came out two weeks ago and is

3414
02:36:06,711 --> 02:36:08,810
amazing and everything about it's
amazing.

3415
02:36:08,930 --> 02:36:12,080
This whole fucking national persona
changed.

3416
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:14,090
Like people really became aware of who
barry.

3417
02:36:14,290 --> 02:36:17,750
His paper was always like peeking.
He was always like ramping up,

3418
02:36:17,751 --> 02:36:19,070
becoming more and more famous every
year.

3419
02:36:19,071 --> 02:36:22,670
But once his netflix special came out
and it was probably his best special to

3420
02:36:22,671 --> 02:36:25,820
date,
he just smashed it and then became a guy

3421
02:36:25,821 --> 02:36:27,500
who sold out Madison Square Garden and
that's,

3422
02:36:27,530 --> 02:36:29,330
that's,
that easily can happen to you.

3423
02:36:29,360 --> 02:36:32,180
It could happen as a girl to cigars.
New special is even better than his

3424
02:36:32,181 --> 02:36:34,370
other one.
He's fucking smashing it right now.

3425
02:36:34,390 --> 02:36:35,240
Yeah,
he's killing it.

3426
02:36:35,780 --> 02:36:38,390
It's,
it's the best platform for comedy.

3427
02:36:38,470 --> 02:36:42,460
It's an amazing time that we live in to
where like that can happen.

3428
02:36:42,580 --> 02:36:47,020
A guy that's never done the tonight show
or I've never done standup on TV at all.

3429
02:36:47,050 --> 02:36:49,030
I'm starting first time ever

3430
02:36:49,420 --> 02:36:50,820
public.
Netflix our.

3431
02:36:50,880 --> 02:36:51,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

3432
02:36:51,460 --> 02:36:52,540
I mean,
think about cigarette too.

3433
02:36:52,541 --> 02:36:54,160
Same thing.
It doesn't have like TV credits,

3434
02:36:54,161 --> 02:36:55,750
right?
These are selling out theaters

3435
02:36:56,560 --> 02:36:59,410
over and over again.
They keep adding shows to his comedy

3436
02:36:59,411 --> 02:37:01,990
works this week.
How about Sebastian's shows Thursday two

3437
02:37:01,991 --> 02:37:03,880
shows.
Friday three shows Saturday.

3438
02:37:03,881 --> 02:37:05,790
They just added a midnight for him.
This Denver Bert

3439
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:08,290
comedy works to me selling out comedy
works.

3440
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:09,153
Yep.
Yep.

3441
02:37:09,270 --> 02:37:10,031
Well,
he's a monster,

3442
02:37:10,031 --> 02:37:10,720
right?
Amazingly,

3443
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:14,170
he's a legit,
like worldclass national headline are

3444
02:37:14,171 --> 02:37:16,340
right now.
And it's all from,

3445
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:19,970
you know,
working and grinding and doing specials

3446
02:37:19,971 --> 02:37:21,680
on the Internet.
It's amazing.

3447
02:37:21,681 --> 02:37:23,480
Yeah.
And from podcasting,

3448
02:37:23,800 --> 02:37:25,420
getting connected to people through
podcast,

3449
02:37:26,030 --> 02:37:28,640
his podcast to him and his wife at your
mom's house.

3450
02:37:28,670 --> 02:37:31,220
They have this tour that they do on the
road with it and it's,

3451
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:35,090
it's a whole thing of it's own.
Like they have all these little things

3452
02:37:35,091 --> 02:37:38,060
that people look forward to like Tom or
black,

3453
02:37:38,290 --> 02:37:41,150
like they'll play tom or black.
They'll play like they have little games

3454
02:37:41,151 --> 02:37:41,984
that they play.

3455
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,600
Brian and I do the road when we,
uh,

3456
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:48,420
when we go to ones that we drive to,
like if at the San Diego or Phoenix or

3457
02:37:48,421 --> 02:37:52,140
San Fran or a sacramento,
which is like the majority of the places

3458
02:37:52,141 --> 02:37:53,640
that we do go.
Uh,

3459
02:37:53,820 --> 02:37:58,020
that's the only podcast that we listened
to and we'd fucking crackup hilarious.

3460
02:37:58,310 --> 02:38:00,670
You just laugh and laugh and laugh.
It's the,

3461
02:38:00,760 --> 02:38:04,140
it's the funniest podcasts.
It's the only podcast that I really

3462
02:38:04,141 --> 02:38:04,750
listened to.
That

3463
02:38:04,750 --> 02:38:07,430
last one I did with Tom,
last podcast I did with Tom was one of

3464
02:38:07,431 --> 02:38:09,590
the best ones we ever did.
It was fucking hilarious.

3465
02:38:09,591 --> 02:38:13,790
Like the entire time we're just laughing
and gagging and slapping the table for

3466
02:38:13,791 --> 02:38:16,970
three hours.
Just me and him like cracking each other

3467
02:38:16,971 --> 02:38:18,370
up.
He's such a great guy.

3468
02:38:18,580 --> 02:38:20,260
He really is.
And He,

3469
02:38:20,320 --> 02:38:21,910
you know,
he's just the best.

3470
02:38:21,911 --> 02:38:26,911
He gave me a call yesterday and he gave
me some cool advice and just is a great,

3471
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:28,890
great guy.
And he and I,

3472
02:38:28,930 --> 02:38:31,990
because you know,
this netflix thing is also like a

3473
02:38:31,991 --> 02:38:34,130
different path.
It's a,

3474
02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:36,580
it's unchartered territory and he's
helping me out.

3475
02:38:36,581 --> 02:38:40,060
Being like a cool big brother that's
awesome to me is this whole thing

3476
02:38:40,270 --> 02:38:41,560
happens and unfolds.

3477
02:38:42,020 --> 02:38:44,780
I couldn't be luckier.
We were so lucky that something like

3478
02:38:44,781 --> 02:38:48,350
Netflix exists because if you do a
special on anything else,

3479
02:38:48,351 --> 02:38:51,540
like say if you do an HBO special,
they aerate whenever they aerate.

3480
02:38:52,030 --> 02:38:53,750
They might hear at once,
they might have it twice,

3481
02:38:53,751 --> 02:38:56,630
they might erode a few other times.
It might air it randomly 3:00 in the

3482
02:38:56,631 --> 02:39:00,770
morning on some special night.
But with Netflix it's always there.

3483
02:39:00,771 --> 02:39:03,020
You just press start,
you just press play.

3484
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:04,190
That's the secret.

3485
02:39:04,230 --> 02:39:09,230
That's everything with their amazing
algorithms that people that would like

3486
02:39:09,361 --> 02:39:11,280
it is,
are going to get a shot at it.

3487
02:39:11,281 --> 02:39:14,460
You know,
everybody has a different screen when

3488
02:39:14,461 --> 02:39:17,880
they turn theirs on based on what they
watched and if they liked it and if they

3489
02:39:17,881 --> 02:39:19,740
rated it and even if you don't rate
things,

3490
02:39:19,741 --> 02:39:23,280
it's still knows you that their
algorithm is like world world,

3491
02:39:23,281 --> 02:39:25,200
world class.
It's really interesting.

3492
02:39:25,201 --> 02:39:30,201
So the more that people would like you,
the closer you're going to get to their

3493
02:39:30,780 --> 02:39:31,830
front page.
So

3494
02:39:31,890 --> 02:39:32,723
yeah.
You know,

3495
02:39:33,150 --> 02:39:36,300
I didn't know there's the ratings on
Netflix movies,

3496
02:39:36,510 --> 02:39:38,400
like if it says like four stars or
whatever,

3497
02:39:38,580 --> 02:39:40,190
that's not actually the rating or the
mood.

3498
02:39:40,191 --> 02:39:42,750
It's what they think you would say the
rating is.

3499
02:39:42,900 --> 02:39:43,521
So like.
Yeah,

3500
02:39:43,521 --> 02:39:45,480
so like there was one movie I watched
the other day and I was like,

3501
02:39:45,540 --> 02:39:47,970
how has it half a star?
That movie sucks so bad,

3502
02:39:47,971 --> 02:39:50,040
but it's really,
it has a half a star and I was like,

3503
02:39:50,070 --> 02:39:51,060
oh wait,
that's.

3504
02:39:51,360 --> 02:39:54,470
If you look at somebody else's,
it'd be like three stars and we'll.

3505
02:39:54,590 --> 02:39:55,530
Yeah,
I didn't know that.

3506
02:39:55,710 --> 02:39:57,450
That's bizarre.
It's really bizarre.

3507
02:39:57,480 --> 02:40:00,750
That doesn't seem like that doesn't seem
kosher.

3508
02:40:01,230 --> 02:40:02,220
Right,
right.

3509
02:40:02,280 --> 02:40:02,580
Yeah.

3510
02:40:02,580 --> 02:40:04,610
I could.
A star system should be kind of like

3511
02:40:04,611 --> 02:40:06,650
what people think.
Maybe they'd want it to get that to

3512
02:40:06,651 --> 02:40:11,651
avoid like a disgruntled person,
like giving it like a really bad reviews

3513
02:40:12,021 --> 02:40:14,430
under a bunch of different fake names or
the opposite,

3514
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:17,010
like maybe a company that like,
like we've,

3515
02:40:17,140 --> 02:40:20,760
there's been that before where someone
put out an independent film and then

3516
02:40:20,761 --> 02:40:25,620
someone hacked into the itunes comments
section and it's all just overwhelmingly

3517
02:40:25,621 --> 02:40:28,920
positive,
like fake reviews of this terrible

3518
02:40:28,921 --> 02:40:30,900
fucking movie.
And then someone in the comments,

3519
02:40:30,901 --> 02:40:33,140
we'll post.
These are paid reviews.

3520
02:40:33,141 --> 02:40:35,430
Like this is not real.
This movie's fucking terrible.

3521
02:40:35,460 --> 02:40:36,293
I've seen them.
Yeah,

3522
02:40:36,370 --> 02:40:38,030
me too.
So maybe that's what Netflix,

3523
02:40:38,050 --> 02:40:41,820
trying to avoid rotten tomatoes.
Pretty guilty of that in general,

3524
02:40:41,821 --> 02:40:44,770
I think it's like there's some hard.
Yeah,

3525
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:46,890
it's hard when you've got a comment
system,

3526
02:40:46,920 --> 02:40:48,120
people don't hack it,
you know,

3527
02:40:48,121 --> 02:40:50,340
people like they've hacked itunes
ratings,

3528
02:40:50,341 --> 02:40:54,000
they figured out how to get higher
ratings and pretend they have more

3529
02:40:54,001 --> 02:40:57,870
downloads or have like multiple
different services that are like,

3530
02:40:57,871 --> 02:41:01,330
download your shit just to like juice up
your ratings and,

3531
02:41:01,331 --> 02:41:06,331
and add comments and like the algorithms
that someone like itunes has like easy

3532
02:41:06,871 --> 02:41:09,510
to manipulate because they're based on
downloads,

3533
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:12,930
they're based on comments and they're
based on New People.

3534
02:41:13,020 --> 02:41:16,560
So if you just have a bunch of new
people sign up and then they leave a

3535
02:41:16,561 --> 02:41:20,190
comment and they download it,
it'll jump you up in the rankings.

3536
02:41:20,200 --> 02:41:23,880
It's kind of interesting how they.
But I guess you can only sign up for

3537
02:41:23,881 --> 02:41:25,670
itunes so many times.
Right?

3538
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:27,850
So that's probably how they avoid it.
Right.

3539
02:41:28,680 --> 02:41:30,900
And it has your public name on their
side.

3540
02:41:30,950 --> 02:41:33,660
It's like even if you lose your account,
you don't want to be like,

3541
02:41:33,960 --> 02:41:36,090
this sucks.
And then have your real name on there.

3542
02:41:36,150 --> 02:41:37,440
Yeah.
Yeah,

3543
02:41:37,470 --> 02:41:39,270
that's true.
Maybe itunes is the right way,

3544
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:42,570
but it seems like the right way.
I don't know,

3545
02:41:42,571 --> 02:41:45,930
man.
I don't think there's anything like

3546
02:41:46,140 --> 02:41:50,100
Netflix might have a point there though.
Like in your circle of people that you

3547
02:41:50,101 --> 02:41:52,830
like.
What did those people think it was star

3548
02:41:52,831 --> 02:41:57,270
wise versus in the circle of like 70
year old people that live in nursing

3549
02:41:57,271 --> 02:41:58,020
homes.

3550
02:41:58,020 --> 02:41:59,880
What did they think of Bob and Dave's
new show,

3551
02:42:00,090 --> 02:42:02,220
you know.
Fuck.

3552
02:42:02,221 --> 02:42:05,330
Are we talking about
business?

3553
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:08,130
Our Algorithms.
All right,

3554
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:09,570
let's wrap this up.
Let's bring it home.

3555
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:11,400
Um,
Friday.

3556
02:42:11,540 --> 02:42:16,470
I'm Tony Hinchcliffe will be with me in
Atlanta and heartland at the tabernacle.

3557
02:42:16,650 --> 02:42:19,050
The Shit it's sold out if you did not
get tickets.

3558
02:42:19,051 --> 02:42:20,430
So sorry,
we'll be back.

3559
02:42:20,970 --> 02:42:24,000
But uh,
that night Tony's one shot will appear

3560
02:42:24,001 --> 02:42:27,030
magically on Netflix in your queue.
That's Q,

3561
02:42:27,031 --> 02:42:29,610
u,
e downloaded and joy.

3562
02:42:29,640 --> 02:42:33,030
Let a motherfucker know on shot one shot

3563
02:42:33,031 --> 02:42:34,840

3564
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:39,920
then we'll be in Tampa on Saturday night
and then we'll be at the UFC on Sunday.

3565
02:42:40,590 --> 02:42:42,150
Excited about that one?
Yeah,

3566
02:42:42,151 --> 02:42:44,010
that's a big one.
It's a big world championship.

3567
02:42:44,011 --> 02:42:47,130
Dominick Cruz versus Tj dillashaw.
That shit should be off the hook and a

3568
02:42:47,131 --> 02:42:49,230
good end of the weekend for us,
you know,

3569
02:42:49,380 --> 02:42:51,540

head on there.

3570
02:42:51,750 --> 02:42:53,640
Brian red band.
Who's your guest this week?

3571
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:56,480

one with Mc crist and Christian mingle.

3576
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:12,100

02:43:21,190 --> 02:43:23,680
That's death squad TV.
You can get information for that.

3583
02:43:23,890 --> 02:43:27,730
Killed Tony is every Monday,
pretty much every Monday at the comedy

3584
02:43:27,731 --> 02:43:29,230
store.
We have our biggest one

3585
02:43:29,230 --> 02:43:32,090
ever at this Monday.
That was the one that everybody's been

3586
02:43:32,140 --> 02:43:34,600
asking for.
The biggest one.

3587
02:43:35,050 --> 02:43:38,440
I'm not kidding.
I'm not always doing now because we're

3588
02:43:38,441 --> 02:43:43,030
going to announce it on the Guy God cast
tomorrow,

3589
02:43:43,360 --> 02:43:46,930
so you're going to know who that is
tomorrow afternoon and also real quick,

3590
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:49,120
caroline's.
I'm headlining New York City for the

3591
02:43:49,121 --> 02:43:52,300
first time ever,
February fifth and six a week after we

3592
02:43:52,301 --> 02:43:56,380
do the beacon theater together.
Carolines on Broadway.

3593
02:43:56,620 --> 02:43:59,530
February,
fifth and sixth helped me out in New

3594
02:43:59,530 --> 02:43:59,990
York City

3595
02:43:59,990 --> 02:44:03,080
to fill those seats and a beacon
theaters.

3596
02:44:03,170 --> 02:44:05,150
I think it sold out.
It was not sold out.

3597
02:44:05,151 --> 02:44:08,840
It's basically sold out almost.
So if you're thinking about getting some

3598
02:44:08,841 --> 02:44:11,590
tickets,
jump on that end of the month.

3599
02:44:11,930 --> 02:44:13,910
You fuckers.
Thanks everybody.

3600
02:44:13,911 --> 02:44:15,540
Much love but by big cash.

3601
02:44:15,980 --> 02:44:19,260
No.
