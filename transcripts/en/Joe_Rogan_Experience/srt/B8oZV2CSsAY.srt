1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,290
September ninth.
There we go.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,970
Got It.
Completed my homework.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,793
Boom.
So what was the day that we were 

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,140
supposed to die from Nibiru?
I think it was the 20.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,490
It was Saturday.
Yeah,

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,450
23rd.
Is that right?

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,390
Twenty third was the champion.
Thirty three days after the eclipse.

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,283
Oh,
the Navarro was going to come and smash 

9
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:21,150
us.
Wouldn't.

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,790
Isn't a huge what we see coming pretty 
big.

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,340
It has to be pretty vague.
Yes.

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,183
We're pretty big.
Do you know the whole Zechariah 

13
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,083
switching thing?
Do you know the whole thing a little 

14
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:29,431
bit.
Yeah.

15
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:30,264
I was Kinda into that for awhile to 
those as a while ago that I realized I 

16
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:34,914
was like super into it.
Like art bell days just don't love our 

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,030
birthdays.
I remember when his son got kidnapped.

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,120
Oh,
that's really weird.

19
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,730
I don't know real.
I couldn't tell if it was real or not.

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,940
That's the problem.
Yeah.

21
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,330
I used to listen to it.
Coming home from the comedy store.

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,770
That was the thing to listen to clock 
late night driving home.

23
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,881
Totally.
Totally.

24
00:00:56,881 --> 00:01:00,420
Art Bell night.
Art Bell live from pahrump.

25
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:05,421
Nevada had like this fenced in compound 
and prompt Nevada with a radio signal.

26
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:11,420
I mean he is like in a lot of ways.
He was like,

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,960
do an internet before the Internet get.
Yeah,

28
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,470
you're right.
He was kind of like a,

29
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,000
like a,
like an aggregator,

30
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,690
like a curator means a curator is 
conscious curation.

31
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:22,620
But uh,
but it,

32
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,690
it,
is that what you mean?

33
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,700
Like the content of what he was talking 
about,

34
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,310
it was also like the,
there's a lot I've,

35
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,183
I would say there's a lot more people 
that have access to like Ufo conspiracy 

36
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:38,370
theory type stuff now because of the 
Internet.

37
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,110
Before then our bell was like your only 
source for.

38
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,001
Got You.
Right,

39
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:42,361
right,
right.

40
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:42,751
The.
Yeah.

41
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:43,584
Yeah.
The deep,

42
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,930
the deep cuts,
that kind of stuff.

43
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,220
What is this?
His son kidnapping this pretty dark sun.

44
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:52,500
Assaulted by HIV teacher.
Oh Jesus.

45
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:57,501
Let's not put that on fucking.
There's people out there.

46
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,583
Yeah,
I know.

47
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,453
But art bell had this a crazy fenced in 
compound that literally looked like it 

48
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:07,050
was in the middle of this open prairie 
was pictures of it.

49
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,700
Yeah.
They put pictures online might.

50
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,110
Who knows what I was looking at,
might not even been that.

51
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:13,530
It might have been like fake people out 
with this.

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,960
He brought my live in a regular house.
Yeah,

53
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,831
yeah,
yeah,

54
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:17,664
yeah,
yeah,

55
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,301
yeah,
yeah.

56
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:21,560
You want him to live in that situation.
I hope he's,

57
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,090
he's kind of like a,
you know,

58
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,620
in a way he was like a mystic.
Those types of people,

59
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:26,610
they're kind of like mistakes.

60
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,453
They hermits,
they live in these weird places because 

61
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:30,510
they have to be,
you know,

62
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,820
in the right conditions to receive the 
information.

63
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:33,660
Yeah.
There's his house.

64
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:36,330
See it's all fenced in.
Oh Wow.

65
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,040
Yeah,
that's a very large.

66
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,840
That's a weird.
Well,

67
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:44,841
that's what we're going over the.
He's got windmills for electricity.

68
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,180
Wow.
He's got some big SORTA truck.

69
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,760
He's got backed in there and we get 
probably supplies.

70
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:54,300
He was a total prepper.
That's amazing.

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,820
That's incredible.
That's.

72
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,743
And it's blue blueish teal or something.
So like a Beverly Hills rundown motel 

73
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,690
color,
like,

74
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,070
you know,
it was a rambler off tans and off blues.

75
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,721
Yeah,
yeah,

76
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:10,221
yeah,
yeah,

77
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:11,740
yeah.
Look at that tower,

78
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:15,760
the radio tower tower in the middle of 
his yard.

79
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,220
That can't give you cancer candidate.
No.

80
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,490
Should be right now.
If something's going on it never.

81
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,240
They would never do anything.
I don't know.

82
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,001
That's A.
Oh,

83
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,490
I know what that is.
That's a thing.

84
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,260
That's a TV.
Aerial radio.

85
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,573
Maybe it's radio,
but it looks like an old school tv 

86
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:32,884
thing.
It's fucking huge towers he has now 

87
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,860
because he must.
Yeah,

88
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:36,910
because he used.
He probably.

89
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,590
He did.
He broadcast from there,

90
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,650
so yeah.
In a way as another internet reference,

91
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,633
art bell was the first time I heard a 
terence McKenna outside of a building 

92
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,770
takes joke.
One Bill Hicks joke.

93
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,320
Oh,
he said Kenneth,

94
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,213
he was talking about five grams of dried
mushrooms or with Terence Mckenna would 

95
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,190
refer to as a heroic dose.
Yes,

96
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:57,791
and I was like,
wow.

97
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,690
Who's terence?
Mckenna?

98
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,440
And I heard transfer can out in the art 
bell show live what?

99
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,333
Hawaii.
Terence Mckenna had this crazy setup in 

100
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,174
Hawaii where he lived in Kona on the 
mountain and he was totally off the 

101
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:14,230
grid,
but way more than art bell.

102
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,063
He was in the jungle off the grid.
He would have these basins to catch 

103
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,523
rainwater.
He had several acres around him which 

104
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,000
was growing psychedelic plants.
He had a thousand books.

105
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,960
He lived totally by himself.
He had like a generator for power and he

106
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:31,810
was completely off the grid and he built
the house there,

107
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,753
dude heavy.
It was just up there writing and 

108
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:36,424
tripping and then he would leave like 
every six months he would take off and 

109
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:41,734
leave for six months and just do these 
tours where you would do these speaking 

110
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:47,800
things in like hippie places like 
Austin,

111
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:50,740
Texas and Portland,
Oregon and shit like that.

112
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,113
And they would gather around all these 
people to listen to all this stuff and 

113
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,480
if you ever heard psychedelic salon,
psychedelics salons,

114
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:01,810
a podcast,
a great podcast and I just have.

115
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,120
I've had Lorenzo from psychedelic salon 
on,

116
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,133
but it's all like old recordings of 
Timothy leary and Alan Watts are you 

117
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:14,740
related and I really wished that I was 
related to him.

118
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,290
That would be rather nice,
profound and with an English accent,

119
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,780
but he has all the mckenna recordings,
like all of them,

120
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,240
like way back,
way back through time.

121
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,130
He plays them all the time.
Mckenna was W,

122
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,010
which time period as sometimes get 
confused with leary.

123
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,460
He was posts Leery,
but he was there.

124
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,130
He was there during that era,
but he came into prominence post leary.

125
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,300
Um,
I think his main psychedelic experiences

126
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,700
were in the seventies.
I'm like,

127
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,534
he had some really,
really crazy mushroom trips with his 

128
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:47,980
brother Dennis,
who's an amazing guy.

129
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,620
Dennis is alive.
He's alive.

130
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,780
He's been on this podcast several times.
He's a great guy.

131
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,570
He's amazing.
And he's actually a professor.

132
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,770
And Dennis,
I'm

133
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,823
like recounts all these tales.
And one time terence and Dennis went 

134
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,450
into the jungle and they took too many 
mushrooms and Dennis completely lost his

135
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:08,180
mind.
He went away for two weeks,

136
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,990
for two weeks,
just incoherent rambling.

137
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:16,991
Had some sort of a psychotic event and 
just like broke down.

138
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:20,420
The nature of reality itself just went 
way too deep.

139
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,830
It was gone for like two weeks.
They had to watch him to watch over him.

140
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,723
Oh my God.
It's almost like he was exposed to such 

141
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:28,184
a complicated mathematical equation and 
it took him that long to figure it out 

142
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:33,350
and it came out of it.
It's like,

143
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,320
okay,
I figured it out.

144
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,690
I'm back,
but you know,

145
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:36,524
terrance came up with the idea of the 
stoned ape theory and it wasn't just 

146
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:42,494
tenant terrence.
It was terrence along with a lot of 

147
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:45,434
other psychedelic researchers.
They sort of formulated some of the 

148
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,883
parts of this hypothesis,
but the parts of this hypothesis had to 

149
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:52,484
deal with human beings evolving from 
lower primates because the lower 

150
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:56,954
primates,
we're forced to try out new foods 

151
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,103
because the rain forest were receding in
the grasslands and all these undulate 

152
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:03,800
too.

153
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,990
We're eating up all the plants as 
they're growing up.

154
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:09,890
They were shitting and they were leaving
cow patties and in these cow patties,

155
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:11,300
the mushrooms,
of course we grow,

156
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,750
so these monkey people like things were 
us that we're living in the trees.

157
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,870
They were forced to test out new food 
sources and it coincides.

158
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:21,704
It's theory coincides with climate data 
that we know about changing of the 

159
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:28,040
temperatures back in Africa during that 
time.

160
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:28,874
Yeah,
and in these particular regions and he 

161
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:34,470
thinks that these lower primates started
experimenting with mushrooms.

162
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:35,220
It started eating,
you know,

163
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,053
the flip cow patties all the time to get
beetles and bugs and things along those 

164
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:39,434
lines and so they will and they would 
pick these mushrooms out to see if they 

165
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:47,330
could eat them well in low doses.
Mushrooms enhanced visual acuity,

166
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,283
so it would help you be a better hunter,
makes you more sensitive and it makes 

167
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,304
you more horny,
which would make you more likely to 

168
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:55,064
breed,
so you'd be more likely to be a 

169
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:58,460
successful hunter and more likely to 
breed.

170
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,623
That's,
that's,

171
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,060
that's like,
that's like a triple threat,

172
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,720
right?
Crazy.

173
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,600
And that's outside of the psychedelic 
effects,

174
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:06,434
right?
The psychedelic effects of enhancing 

175
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:10,880
community of creative thinking.
All these things that happen when you do

176
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:11,714
mushrooms in varying doses and he 
believes that mushrooms are responsible 

177
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:19,760
for the doubling of the human brain size
over a period of 2 million years,

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,640
which is apparently the biggest mystery 
in the fossil record.

179
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,190
They have no idea.
It's so quick,

180
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,243
so it's a total departure and it's the 
organ responsible for the fossil record 

181
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:31,910
in the first place.
Right,

182
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:32,744
exactly.
Understanding of what the fossil record 

183
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:37,160
and the reason why we're writing all 
this stuff down.

184
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,023
I mean it's because of the mind.
Will this mind doubled over a period of 

185
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:41,234
2 million years and I think they,
what they think is there's a bunch of 

186
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:44,660
different factors.
It's no,

187
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,673
people argue about this,
but I think it's really important to be 

188
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,440
balanced about this and go.
I don't know if it's either or.

189
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:53,210
I think there was a bunch of shit going 
on.

190
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,140
Yeah,
absolutely.

191
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:56,130
If they think it had to do with humans 
figuring out

192
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,963
fire and how to cook meat,
they think cooking me allowed people to 

193
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:03,210
get more nutrients which allowed people 
to be healthier.

194
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,340
Um,
and if you can kill one animal,

195
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,174
you'd have more resources to sort of 
figure things out and start thinking of 

196
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,040
shelters and weapons and all these 
different,

197
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,230
various things that lead to 
civilization.

198
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:14,880
There's one theory that goes in that 
way,

199
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,580
that trade,
the throwing arm is another one.

200
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,960
The fact that we could throw,
that,

201
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,560
we could throw things,
we could hit shit.

202
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,423
There was nowhere near us like no other 
animal and then once we figured out 

203
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:28,110
spears,
we started like this,

204
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,370
this ability to do this one thing might 
have led us to enough free time to start

205
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,233
innovating.
Then the brain as time went on favored 

206
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:36,564
the ones who are more innovative and 
more more disciplined and more creative 

207
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,030
and those are the ones that survive 
longer,

208
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,790
which is obviously what we're rewarding 
people today.

209
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,140
No,
that's true.

210
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,333
Fascinate hasn't gone away now.
That doesn't go away at that totally 

211
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:50,960
makes sense.
I mean it's like,

212
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,803
you know,
if you in general the idea of awareness 

213
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:58,200
and consciousness as a,
as a metaphor,

214
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,034
it's many people use it,
but just like a computer operating 

215
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:01,380
system.
So,

216
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,390
so,
or you know,

217
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,920
consciousness experiencing itself 
infinitely,

218
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:05,754
you know,
but like that's like this form of an 

219
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:09,010
operating system and the,
the.

220
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,220
We live in a binary of version of a 
isolate which,

221
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,300
which is kind of like a game,
you know,

222
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,180
to them rediscover the,
the,

223
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,320
the,
the fact that that's not true.

224
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,950
It is true.
But it's also not true,

225
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:26,610
you know,
to arrive at the paradox to that,

226
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,270
the answer of the thing that happens 
within a paradox,

227
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,230
you know,
like a good joke.

228
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:31,841
Right?
Right.

229
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:32,790
When you're,
when you're like,

230
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,220
here's the setup,
here's the punchline.

231
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,550
And so if somewhere when those two 
things collide in a group of people,

232
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,610
it will trigger a reaction and if it's 
laugh,

233
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,830
laughter in that moment,
it's,

234
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,113
it's understanding of paradox.
It's like feeling the effects of a 

235
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:52,014
paradox where it actually like a very 
unique moment of crazy thing that like 

236
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,803
you didn't expect to experience because 
it's so different than everything else 

237
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:02,020
you experienced in everyday life.
Yeah.

238
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:02,854
It's like,
it's like everything and nothing 

239
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:04,464
simultaneously.
Like you get that quick because a joe 

240
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:09,090
kind of does that at least in my 
opinion.

241
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:09,641
And,
and,

242
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:14,070
and that makes you feel like it gives 
everyone a sense of enlightenment for,

243
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,050
for a moment.
I know what you're saying.

244
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:16,884
I don't think a joke does it the way a 
psychedelic experience that 

245
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,663
indefinitely.
There's like this weird moment when 

246
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:22,860
you're laughing at someone who's really 
killing.

247
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,260
Like when you,
you,

248
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,440
you escape from your,
the shackles of your normal thinking.

249
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,091
Yes.
Yeah,

250
00:11:29,091 --> 00:11:29,461
yeah,
yeah,

251
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:30,440
totally.
And you and you,

252
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,650
it's just a joyfulness because it's a,
it's like you get this perspective.

253
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:35,484
It's like such a zoomed out perspective 
on this thing in such a small incident 

254
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:42,210
of time that it just said it's like 
being on a ride,

255
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:44,690
you know,
it's like you're just suddenly there and

256
00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:45,524
you know.
Do you feel like when I've been talking 

257
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:50,850
about this a lot,
do you feel like that what's going on is

258
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:54,970
like a form of hypnosis when a comedian 
is like killing over a crowd.

259
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,043
Like it's like a form of hypnosis 
because I always feel like when I'm 

260
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:00,610
watching someone on stage and they 
really got me,

261
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,940
I'm not really thinking I'm,
we'll kind of allowing them to think for

262
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:06,940
me and I'm just like sitting down,
smiling and enjoying the ride.

263
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:09,970
They take me out.
I'm not doing any analyzing myself.

264
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,433
Especially that's like one of the 
reasons why it's very important to like 

265
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,913
really think carefully about people's 
attention spans and how to get these 

266
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:22,390
ideas into their head.
I think it is in a way,

267
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,473
it's like a state of mind that you 
achieve on stage that's very similar to 

268
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,040
hypnosis.
Yeah.

269
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,003
You're talking about the effect on 
people or on Youtube and the idea of 

270
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,334
what's happened.
I think the comedian as well because I 

271
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:39,631
feel like it's my job to put all the 
pieces together and practice it and just

272
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:41,074
tweak it and to.
But when I get on stage and it starts 

273
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:43,444
happening,
I feel like I'm as much of a passenger 

274
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:46,930
as I am the driver.
Oh Man.

275
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,180
Yeah.
That's a really great description.

276
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:50,950
Yeah,
I agree with that 100 percent.

277
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:52,090
I mean,
you know,

278
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:56,680
like sometimes I'll say that the feeling
that I get on stage if I'm,

279
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,543
you know,
making music or even just like riffing 

280
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,090
or whatever is that I feel like I'm 
actually,

281
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,163
I'm,
I'm watching the show or I'm actually 

282
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:07,330
stepped out of myself and I'm actually 
kind of enjoying the show.

283
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,570
There'll be a moment where I'll be like,
oh fuck right.

284
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:15,460
I'm,
I'm also doing now snap back in.

285
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,430
But in those moments,
that's I.

286
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:19,480
that's exactly.
I dig.

287
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,353
I dig that because it exists.
It's just depends on where your 

288
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,650
awareness lands.
You know what?

289
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:24,520
I always feel like,
man,

290
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,473
I always feel like the dude running the 
old school movie projector because 

291
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:28,774
you're really just kind of turn it on,
but you have to be there in case 

292
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:31,780
anything fucks up.
Yeah.

293
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,390
For the most part it runs on its own.
Do you remember the movies?

294
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:38,290
Yeah,
there was a uh,

295
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,670
yeah,
there was an operator.

296
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:40,451
There is a.
yeah,

297
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,880
there was just someone next to it just 
in case something fucked up.

298
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,130
Do you remember when movies fucked up 
and you don't have to yell out.

299
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Oh yeah,
I do remember that.

300
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,740
Yeah,
those are great.

301
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,520
Absolutely.

302
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,370
Yeah.
The fuck ups,

303
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,890
the chaos.
That's the community.

304
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,783
That's a real test of character to see 
whether you're talking to a movie 

305
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:01,240
theater.
Oh yeah.

306
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,074
What do you mean?
Like the kind of people that talk and 

307
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:04,744
movie player during a movie,
like you really know whether or not you 

308
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:08,650
can hang out with someone if they talk 
in a movie.

309
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:09,940
Yes,
absolutely.

310
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:11,740
One hundred percent.
Because if someone starts talking to the

311
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:12,311
movie theater,
you're like,

312
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:13,810
hey,
you're inconsiderate.

313
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,860
Yeah.
Oh totally.

314
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,150
Or unless like,
you know,

315
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:18,360
for me,
I have this little secret that once,

316
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,061
if,
if it's,

317
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:20,560
uh,
a brief comment,

318
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,500
I don't really mind so much,
but yeah,

319
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,030
the secret get really quiet and get 
close to their ear and don't whisper,

320
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:29,990
just speaking kind of a like,
Hey,

321
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,070
what am I?
Right?

322
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,420
Because the higher your whisper is,
it's much more siblings and everyone can

323
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:37,384
hear it.
So whispers are actually allowed to put 

324
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,493
a hushed tone anyway.
Also the people that just start talking 

325
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:44,530
about normal shit.
Oh yeah,

326
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,990
totally has nothing to do with the 
movie.

327
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,103
It'd be called Maki now you asshole.
Sky's going to get killed by a robot 

328
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:54,464
lady.

329
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,900
She interested in seeing how that even 
comes to being shut the fuck up.

330
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:00,734
She's about to kill A.
Troy was really angry the other day 

331
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,950
talking about troy where were at the 
movie Avatar to motherfucker.

332
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,840
It's,
Gosh,

333
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,420
it's in three.
I'm wearing glasses.

334
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,240
That's the crazy thing.
Hey,

335
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,460
you know,
it's just coming out this fall.

336
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,600
I don't really watch.
It.

337
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,340
Gives a fuck what's going to happen in 
the future.

338
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:23,174
You might not even be alive.
I might kill you for talking to the 

339
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:28,440
movie theater,
so either you have no idea how I'm going

340
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:30,740
to react.
Really taking a big risk.

341
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,820
Man,
I'm really hungry.

342
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:32,654
Let's get something to eat after this,
but fighter people that can't even wait 

343
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:38,420
an hour to eat like,
no,

344
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:39,254
I have to be filled.
I need to fill my holes because the 

345
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,363
holes get lonely.
I need to fail my face hole with food 

346
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,300
immediate.
I can't survive.

347
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,480
That's tough,
man.

348
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,760
That's a tough racket because some 
people,

349
00:15:58,761 --> 00:15:59,594
I dunno some.
I mean obviously there are people that 

350
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,084
have like this weird thing that happens 
when you know that hangry thing or 

351
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,110
whatever.
Bloodshot u,

352
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,580
so then they,
they kind of get crazy.

353
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,623
However,
I will say for the most part it's about 

354
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,343
discipline and the discipline turns into
just nature and then you get a better 

355
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:19,880
sense of how if you are hungry,
you're like,

356
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:21,440
you know what?
I'm hungry and that's fine.

357
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,460
Yeah,
you can be fine.

358
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,420
I'm going to.
I'm going to be hungry.

359
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:25,670
I can live for a few days without days,
so.

360
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,080
So a few hours or four hours extra.
I'm going to be fine.

361
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,090
Did you hear about the guy that lost 
like more than 100 pounds by fasting for

362
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:38,840
an entire year?
He had a doctor's monitoring him.

363
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:42,840
It was all part of some sort of 
scientific experiment and we had to.

364
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,130
We were talking about him with Robb 
Wolf.

365
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,973
Correct.
Is that who was telling us about it or 

366
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:50,060
was it dom d'agostino?
Not like in the sixties or something?

367
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,291
No,
no,

368
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,650
no.
It was fairly recently,

369
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,830
fairly recently because the doctors were
monitoring him.

370
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:58,730
He lost over 100 pounds and here's 
what's really crazy.

371
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,880
His skin shrunk with him,
like his body corrected for itself,

372
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,740
which is like what?
Because he went into a complete state of

373
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:10,574
Ketosis,
right where his body is only fuel was 

374
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:13,484
from the actual extra fat in his bio and
then when his body started consuming 

375
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:18,044
this mean he could have like really 
bizarre genetics where skin doesn't 

376
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,590
stretch out.
Is this,

377
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,573
this is it,
right?

378
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,613
Four hundred 50 pound man faster for a 
year and he lost more than half his 

379
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,151
weight.
Yeah,

380
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:28,760
I think that's it.
It happened in 1965.

381
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,370
Was that the same one?
See if there's a recent photo,

382
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,263
because if rob lowe was talking about 
that they had all these color photos of 

383
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,740
the guy that looked really recent,
you might be right,

384
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,740
but I think.
I think it was a recent.

385
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:41,870
Maybe they recreated it.
Maybe that's what it was,

386
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,210
but this guy,
whatever it was,

387
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,260
all he did.
Oh,

388
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,500
is this the same one?
Same One.

389
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,070
I'm all

390
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,520
he did was drink water and his body just
ate it's fat.

391
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,290
I don't know if it took vitamins or 
what.

392
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,380
He had to take some for some fiber 
because they need stuff to go through,

393
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,930
so I wish Rob Wolf was here.
I'm pretty sure he's the one who told us

394
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:01,764
about it.
What I think was was the most shocking 

395
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:04,770
was that a skin trump.
That's,

396
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,700
that's the.
That's the.

397
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,800
That's the weird thing.
I mean,

398
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,230
I mean with weight loss,
I lost like 50,

399
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,760
55 pounds.
Damn,

400
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,940
I should do that.
I just started lifting.

401
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:15,774
I got a trainer and started lifting and 
then basically eating like a 

402
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:20,020
bodybuilder,
so just.

403
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,230
And that's how I eat.
For the most part,

404
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,330
they feel better that way.
Oh Man.

405
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:27,350
Way Better.
It's crazy like crazy food.

406
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,550
Like people sometimes will look at the 
food that I'm bringing,

407
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,400
which is always pretty much the same 
thing.

408
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,020
I'm like,
what are you eating?

409
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,350
Like you know,
like for breakfast it's like this what I

410
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:39,840
call the year or what he calls the Yogi 
shake.

411
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,693
My trainer,
he has this shake that he that he digs 

412
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,900
and it's like half key for half a cup 
of.

413
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,050
Yeah,
a cup of oats,

414
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:51,450
raw oats,
a half a cup of Keifer,

415
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,350
half cup of water,
and then 35 grams of a j.

416
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:56,880
rob chocolate,
egg,

417
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:57,661
white protein.
Oh.

418
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:00,650
And a handful of frozen blueberries.
Damn scene.

419
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,440
Got a lot of good stuff going on there.
You've got students,

420
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,380
you've got probiotics from the key.
You've got some carbs from the oats.

421
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:09,270
Yep.
You've got protein.

422
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,280
Yeah.
See we just eat good.

423
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,293
It's so funny because.
But the problem is there's a lot of 

424
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:15,474
fucking dummies that also eat good and 
they're annoying and for regular people 

425
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:19,764
that want to be healthy,
but they don't want to be that annoying 

426
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:21,600
guy.

427
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,980
The gym that's just fucking,
just droning on and on about his sets in

428
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:28,560
his lifts and you start thinking that 
being healthy is for idiots.

429
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,310
Yes.
Right.

430
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,530
I know it gives it a bad rap.
It tells me that it's,

431
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
it's not,
it's not that,

432
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:33,380
you know,
my,

433
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,220
my favorite thing that I've been 
learning,

434
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,060
like lifting and sometimes they go to 
Gold's on Saturday,

435
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:39,894
like as a treat.
So like we go to Gold's in Venice and 

436
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:47,070
it's what I love about anything that I 
get involved with is just observing like

437
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,180
how the system works,
you know,

438
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,970
and like yeah,
the community,

439
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:53,760
like what's the level of awareness,
like what are they focused on,

440
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:56,820
those types of things.
And the thing I really dig about lifting

441
00:19:56,821 --> 00:20:00,000
is that it's not what you think.
Like I think people think like,

442
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,510
oh meatheads no roided up,
blah blah blah blah blah.

443
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,970
And don't get me wrong.
There are some of those for sure.

444
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,480
And um,
it wouldn't be a real gym without,

445
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,160
without a couple,
but like you go into,

446
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,100
you go into gold and man,
people are so respectful,

447
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,500
very friendly,
very respectful.

448
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:18,990
They help me like rack rack their 
weights,

449
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:21,270
they help you,
they rerock if you're working in,

450
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,410
um,
they uh,

451
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,960
get things out of the way they think 
about like,

452
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:26,820
stuff like being in the way or not.
You know,

453
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:27,654
there's,
there's a lot of like really cool 

454
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:29,880
conscious,
hey,

455
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:31,110
let me help you.
Oh,

456
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,973
you know,
that lift that you're doing with those 

457
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,800
putting too much stress on your,
on your shoulder,

458
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,663
you might want to like,
pull in a little bit with your elbow or 

459
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:37,620
whatever.
Just a tip.

460
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,483
You know,
those guys are great guys that are 

461
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:40,434
annoying.
Or the guys that want to correct you in 

462
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:42,600
the wrong man.

463
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,190
No,
don't do that.

464
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,080
You got to exercise.
You know,

465
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,560
what would I do that,
you just can't do it.

466
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,633
There's guys that just have this idea in
their head that they need to absolutely 

467
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,550
tell you their knowledge.
Oh man,

468
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,620
it must come out now.
It's,

469
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,510
it's weird.
Any can tell the difference because like

470
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,353
if someone's like giving you a small 
piece of corrective advice for an 

471
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,960
exercise that you're doing in the moment
or that you're doing.

472
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,823
So it's not a critique of the exercises,
so it's more like I'm looking at you 

473
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:18,850
doing this exercise and here's a little 
piece that might make it more efficient,

474
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,413
better,
better use of your movement or whatever 

475
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,410
you.
That's great.

476
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,540
I get that.
And you can get that right away.

477
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:25,871
Like,
oh,

478
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:26,980
that's dope.
I'll try that.

479
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:27,820
And if it works,
it works.

480
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:28,720
If it doesn't,
it doesn't,

481
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,583
you know,
but when someone's like going off on 

482
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,150
these giant concepts like these,
uh,

483
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,653
just,
just things that are too large to give 

484
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:40,500
to someone that you don't know and they 
just start firing it out at you.

485
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,420
Yeah.
All these physiological words.

486
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,510
Yeah.
You know what?

487
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,890
I don't even know what you're saying.
Know what the word I'm not.

488
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,910
I don't want to look stupid.
I.

489
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,430
Yeah,
yeah,

490
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,201
yeah.
Totally.

491
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:53,800
Well,
yeah,

492
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,270
I mean if we can.
Yeah,

493
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:57,040
sure man.
Thanks man.

494
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,040
Thank you.
All that isolated my scapula reporting,

495
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,090
but my superspinatus and all these words
like,

496
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,660
oh,
what are you doing here?

497
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,503
Do you feel like you're jerking off on 
me or tricking off on me with your 

498
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:11,830
knowledge,
knowledge jerking.

499
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,893
There is knowledge jerking right?
Pretty sure that they definitely 

500
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:15,940
knowledge.
Absolutely.

501
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:16,774
Yeah,
and it gets grouped in with 

502
00:22:17,831 --> 00:22:21,160
mansplaining,
which I think is like another form of.

503
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,430
It's too generalized general human term.
Have you heard he pete?

504
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,800
It's a new one.
Oh,

505
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:26,634
it's that he peed is when a woman says 
something and everybody ignores it and 

506
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:30,670
the man says the exact same thing.

507
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,340
Oh,
great idea.

508
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,590
Fucked.
I know that.

509
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,640
I know what that is and that's fucked.
I did not like that.

510
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,720
There's nothing that pisses me off.
Morris here loving.

511
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,720
Let me capitalize on an idea that was 
not really delivered in the right timing

512
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,681
or whatever.
It's like,

513
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:49,520
but I'm just going to claim 
responsibility.

514
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,660
Don't say debbie just had a great idea.
Yeah,

515
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,600
yeah,
yeah.

516
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,980
That's the difference between a good 
person.

517
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:55,510
A county person.
Man.

518
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,340
Debbie just had a good idea as a good 
person.

519
00:22:57,341 --> 00:23:00,310
Hey everybody who had a great idea.
The bad guys like.

520
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:01,810
Yeah,
totally.

521
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,670
And Debbie's like,
what?

522
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,710
Thought?
Debbie doesn't know what to do.

523
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,030
This fucking job sucked yet totally 
this.

524
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,150
I knew this guy was an asshole.
Here's my proof.

525
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,103
That culture of like not like being in a
corporate world and like one person is 

526
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:17,470
the boss and the other people who have 
to kiss his ass on the boss,

527
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:20,400
but then the boss has a boss,
the regional boss was coming by,

528
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,190
everybody tighten up and he's got to put
a tie on.

529
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,373
Know I know the only time that system 
works is if the boss is a really good 

530
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,930
person and being a boss,
that's the only time which is very,

531
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:38,764
very rare.
It's super rare because they're playing 

532
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:42,160
against it.
That's what's happening.

533
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,150
Well,
you have to exist.

534
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,070
You have to exist by while ignoring

535
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,220
all the trappings of bosses.
Yeah.

536
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:48,711
Right,
right,

537
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:51,440
right.
If you're just looking at like just from

538
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,363
a rational logistic like efficient 
making mindset like you want you want 

539
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,800
you want and what the value of 
efficiency also relates to the happiness

540
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:03,560
of the workers and their wellbeing.
Not Coddling too much,

541
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:06,440
but providing just the just the right 
amount of things,

542
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:10,950
plus a little bit extra to give it the 
grease that it needs to feel good.

543
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:11,923
Finding people to fill your team that 
are likeminded or willing to like kind 

544
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:19,790
of think that way where everybody kind 
of works together almost as a family.

545
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,870
Yes,
exactly.

546
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:21,883
I'm sure those jobs exist.
I know I've talked to people who love 

547
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,430
their jobs.
I know there's people like that that are

548
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,330
putting it together.
Right?

549
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,230
I think that there are companies and if 
not there are moments when companies are

550
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:31,064
like that because everything changes,
so it might not be sustainable if we 

551
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:34,940
keep going.

552
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,230
I feel like people don't.
People like to look at the worst aspects

553
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:40,910
of any point in time.
Right.

554
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:45,911
Whether it's climate change or a crazy 
presidential situation or race relations

555
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,084
or whatever.
We always look at the worst aspects of 

556
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:49,334
it,
but I think overall it's pretty 

557
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:55,811
undeniable this is the best time ever to
be alive in terms of healthcare,

558
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:56,983
in terms of the science behind to 
keeping people alive in terms of your 

559
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:01,574
ability to get information in terms of 
our ability to communicate with each 

560
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:07,100
other and bullshit to get through.
To us.

561
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,550
It's way less likely to bullshit gets 
through to people today.

562
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,430
Then the propaganda they could spew just
in like the 19 sixties.

563
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,750
Oh,
get over on us.

564
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:16,760
That's been the Gulf of Tonkin thing,
like the whole thing,

565
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,653
the whole reason why we got into war.
So I just think that if we can keep it 

566
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,590
together and we can keep going.

567
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,250
I think 40 years from now,
50 years from now that's going to.

568
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,143
I think we're going to realize that that
should be the norm and that they're 

569
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,940
really healthy communities is going to 
be the norm and all these things.

570
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:35,860
This is like almost like a aberrations 
that we,

571
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,723
when we look back in time and thinking 
like people who were kings and they had 

572
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:42,330
people under them and they executed 
people at their own whim and that,

573
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,540
you know,
that only exists in a few places today.

574
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,210
It's like North Korea and like maybe a 
couple other places.

575
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,150
I feel like in the future we're all 
going to move towards it.

576
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,240
We're just,
it's just hard to see while we're in it,

577
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,250
we're all moving towards a better way of
living.

578
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

579
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:57,644
I mean,
uh,

580
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,850
I mean I think of it,
you know,

581
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,863
if I,
if I go back to that I'm like the 

582
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:07,100
reality awareness issue or a,
the idea that,

583
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,283
you know,
there are multi verses and that every 

584
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:12,170
choice splits off and makes another 
choice to make another choice.

585
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:15,120
So in essence,
if just to,

586
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,200
in essence,
if anything is possible,

587
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:18,650
if,
if,

588
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,483
if the amount of realities and 
possibilities that exists are infinite 

589
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:26,210
and,
but we're perceiving one point,

590
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,500
you know,
as a,

591
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:30,140
whatever consciousness has experiment or
whatever you want to call it,

592
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,183
but as your point of reference,
as you move and every choice that you 

593
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:34,334
make,
you can actually steer yourself to the 

594
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:36,860
reality that you want to live in.
So,

595
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,440
I mean,
I think that there's,

596
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:44,130
there's something great about seeing the
trajectory of what you just

597
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,650
described and moving towards that 
future,

598
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,350
but being proactive in the way that you 
can.

599
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,350
And,
but I think really the.

600
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,680
I think the thing that's really gonna 
help all of that is energy.

601
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,573
Like if we can figure out a way to 
distribute energy so that it's more 

602
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:04,320
equal amongst all human beings on the 
planet creating something.

603
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:06,460
You mean energy in terms of power,
actual power,

604
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,650
electrical power,
electrical power.

605
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,543
Yeah.
I would feel like there's a lot of 

606
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:11,874
places in the earth that would benefit 
from some super advanced form of solar 

607
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,180
energy because if.
Yeah,

608
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:19,014
for sure.
Why even ever have power plants the why 

609
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,960
have any of that stuff can all be 
independent and we don't totally rely on

610
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:26,460
a grid either this way.
No,

611
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:26,851
no,
no.

612
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:29,700
It's distributed power is the,
is the best power,

613
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,340
especially if it is connected because 
then you have.

614
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,810
It can manage itself.
I mean even if like,

615
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,653
you know,
artificial intelligence and things like 

616
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:37,194
that or just really good programming,
it just optimizes constantly in real 

617
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:43,410
time based on a sensor array when you 
know,

618
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,244
they use really good back country solar 
panels to charge batteries for cameras 

619
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,200
and phones.
That's right.

620
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,970
My friend Adam was in Montana and he was
in Colorado,

621
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,940
Montana,
Idaho and Wyoming went on this epic back

622
00:27:58,941 --> 00:28:02,790
country hunt and one of the things that 
he did is he brought this solar thing to

623
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:03,624
charge his phone every day.
Do instastories from the top of the 

624
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:06,961
mountain.
Yeah.

625
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:08,040
Amazing.
Amazing stuff.

626
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:10,770
But that you couldn't do that just a few
years ago.

627
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,783
I mean,
there wasn't the kind of solar power 

628
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:13,584
that you could pack up and a little 
thing and stuff into your backpack and 

629
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,930
it's crazy.
I know.

630
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,730
Yeah.
I was telling,

631
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,330
I was checking out.

632
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:22,100
There's a company out of Australia that 
makes these solar generators and they're

633
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,630
like 17 grand or something like that,
or maybe even.

634
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,410
Oh No,
the money would be more like 30 grand or

635
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:27,270
something.
Anyways,

636
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:29,910
it's this like fairly lightweight 
system.

637
00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:33,920
It's like a master system that has a 
base and um,

638
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,850
and a solar array and it tracks the sun,
uh,

639
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,260
so moves automatically with the sun and 
it accounts,

640
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,094
like,
it also has some other preprogrammed 

641
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,290
weather data that's also integrated into
it either real time or stored.

642
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,700
And so it,
it.

643
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,630
But it's able to produce like a pretty 
decent amount of electricity.

644
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:52,464
I don't remember the numbers,
but it was definitely way more than a 

645
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:56,180
trickle charge.
Oh,

646
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,053
you could almost like,
you could run a refrigeration system on 

647
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:00,264
it,
like a small refrigerator so you can 

648
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:03,440
keep food from perishing.
Yeah.

649
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,940
Maybe even get some air conditioning 
going or something.

650
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,863
Yeah.
I think with a storage battery 20 years 

651
00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:10,440
from now,
who knows this shit.

652
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:11,600
It's gonna be well,
I mean,

653
00:29:11,601 --> 00:29:13,900
you know,
if I just got done seeing that,

654
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:15,570
uh,
the documentary,

655
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,310
uh,
I don't know.

656
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,263
I don't remember the name of it,
but it's a kind of kind of conspiracy 

657
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:24,510
Ufo.
A fairly recent one.

658
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:25,344
Yeah.
That's fairly.

659
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,790
Steven Greer,
that guy.

660
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,200
Uh,
not sure it's on a,

661
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,740
it's on itunes.
Is featured on itunes.

662
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,960
Do you remember the name of it?
I can find it.

663
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,530
Like the unknown or some.
Yeah.

664
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,690
Yeah,
that seems right.

665
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,670
Yeah.
And acknowledged it.

666
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,610
There's art belly,
there's asked.

667
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,820
It was kind of our belly,
actually our belly,

668
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,170
those are tough shows for me to watch 
because it makes sense,

669
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,960
like some of the stuff that they're 
talking about.

670
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:56,883
And then that makes sense,
but my theory is that the level of 

671
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:05,260
organization that they're talking about 
doesn't really exist.

672
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,170
Like it's not that tight,
I think.

673
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,200
I think it's kind of messy.
I think it's,

674
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,073
it's the same thing,
like just look at kids on a playground 

675
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,253
and see how they organize themselves 
socially and then just expand that with 

676
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:20,650
a little bit more complexity or more 
complexity.

677
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,990
And you have these,
this idea of like the secrecy,

678
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:26,100
the structure of secrecy.
And uh,

679
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,170
yeah,
uh,

680
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,110
ancient,
uh,

681
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,170
uh,
like cults that have now risen,

682
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,123
you know,
Rosa crucial ones and a masons and the 

683
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:38,800
Illuminati in those,
those types of things.

684
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,640
I think that those,
they can,

685
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:46,030
like that sort of thing does exist,
but it doesn't exist in the tight,

686
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,840
efficient,
controlled version.

687
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,960
I think it's,
I think it's messier than that.

688
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,990
I think it's people trying to influence 
other people using a bunch of tactics.

689
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:03,150
But I think that you can't have control.
You can't have that much control as,

690
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,050
as much control as they're talking 
about.

691
00:31:05,051 --> 00:31:05,884
Well,
the only way that would work is if the 

692
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:10,220
government was different than people.
Like if they,

693
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,770
if they weren't,
if it wasn't made,

694
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:16,120
if people got totally wasn't people,
they were so smart that they weren't,

695
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,920
then that could be possible.
But obviously that's not the case.

696
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,843
Donald trump is the fucking president.
So we have proof that the government is 

697
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,740
filled with people.
That guy's a person.

698
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:33,530
So person,
no person has ever been able to pull off

699
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,890
that level of conspiracy for any length 
of time.

700
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:42,090
And the idea that you could hide somehow
communication with aliens and the aliens

701
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:44,810
would choose the government of all 
people.

702
00:31:44,811 --> 00:31:48,620
Why would the aliens give a fuck who we 
picked a popularity contest.

703
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,603
Oh,
that's the representative that gets to 

704
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,360
speak to Zeta reticular the fuck outta 
here.

705
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,830
They talked to whoever they want to go 
and check when we visit a bee colony.

706
00:31:57,831 --> 00:32:02,831
Excuse me,
stick on fucking secret contact.

707
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,140
Just suck some bees out with a vacuum.
When to take them to a lab to test them.

708
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,073
Listen,
I need you to go back to the need to go 

709
00:32:11,271 --> 00:32:12,104
to the king.
He imagined some fucking dudes sitting 

710
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:15,480
in the White House,
you know,

711
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:16,890
uh,
at the Oval Office.

712
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:17,724
And the alien walks in.
I am the representative of the 19 

713
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,040
forties movie.
Right.

714
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,300
Doesn't make,
it,

715
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,290
doesn't make any sense.
I bought,

716
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,210
I believe,
I believe in like so many things.

717
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,140
So many infinite things can exist and 
things are possible.

718
00:32:33,141 --> 00:32:35,000
However,
there are things that are just like,

719
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,680
it just makes sense.
You know,

720
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:39,170
it intuitively you can feel some 
connection.

721
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,123
It real like,

722
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,113
you know what,
I'll leave a 10 percent margin of 

723
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:43,280
possibility,
you know,

724
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:46,970
like something like that.
But the ideas where I'm like I can't,

725
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,490
I just can't.
I,

726
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,710
it could be real,
but I've seen nothing that compels me to

727
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:53,420
believe that it is.
But it could be real.

728
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:54,254
I'm not,
I'm definitely not saying there are no 

729
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:57,620
aliens with the government hasn't been 
contacted by aliens.

730
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,460
Aliens haven't visited.
Sure,

731
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,970
sure.
I mean why not do it?

732
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,700
I mean,
I,

733
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,430
I,
I don't think it's impossible.

734
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,323
But again,
I think it's not in to the extent at 

735
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:12,830
which when you compress all the data and
you like formulate a story about it,

736
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:14,030
you know,
it was really unlikely.

737
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,990
But yeah,
it's like,

738
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,943
well,
I dunno,

739
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,980
it seems you have,
you kind of have to do that.

740
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:23,981
Like you can't talk about that stuff.
It also seems super likely to me that in

741
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:28,430
the future we won't send biological 
entities into these places that have all

742
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:31,160
these limitations as far as what we can 
survive.

743
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,620
We'll send some sort of an artificial 
intelligent.

744
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,140
Maybe that's what those things are.
Those gray things,

745
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,900
the big black eyes.
Maybe those are robots.

746
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,190
Oh man,
makes sense.

747
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:41,024
Within the question is,
is my theory is that the whole 

748
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,050
propulsion or compulsion to,
to,

749
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,203
to constantly be making technology is 
based on our desire to make or build 

750
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:55,490
ourselves outside of ourselves.
Yeah.

751
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,610
So without the,
the normal biological means,

752
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:02,480
it's like we're fascinated at.
We're fascinated at simulating ourselves

753
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,600
outside of ourselves.
And so in essence,

754
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:08,710
we could just be that already.
Right?

755
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,613
And so,
so it's like we're just like on this 

756
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:15,650
constant carrot chasing a propulsion 
system.

757
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,903
Yeah.
There's a lot of people that when they 

758
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:19,940
look at the image of the alien,
they,

759
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:20,774
uh,
they look at that image and they say 

760
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:22,754
that it's entirely preposterous.
It's someone who would achieve or 

761
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,234
something would achieve a humanoid shape
with all the massive amounts of 

762
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:33,260
different shapes that we have on earth.

763
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,270
Yes.
Just to be mobile,

764
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,230
that's not the only way to be mobile and
know we know how ours came to be that we

765
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:42,050
used to be crawling and then we started 
standing up.

766
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:43,340
Right.
That's why we have all these issues with

767
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:44,174
our spine.
Spine wasn't entirely designed to 

768
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:48,590
support upper body weight.
That's right.

769
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,670
Yeah,
that's right.

770
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,721
Yeah,
and you know,

771
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:51,554
the other thing is it's one of my pet 
peeves and just putting this into the 

772
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:58,490
spectrum of science fiction.
Every,

773
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,070
every celestial body,
every planet,

774
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,620
every moon had.
They all have different gravity's.

775
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,473
Yeah,
so there's going to be different types 

776
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:07,550
of creatures.
Not only that,

777
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:08,384
but when they come to our planet,
there is going to need a really strong 

778
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:10,963
exoskeleton suit or they're going to be 
so incredibly strong that it wouldn't 

779
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:16,190
matter.
Also,

780
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,720
atmospheric gases,
like all you know,

781
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,450
like how they produce energy,
other.

782
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,373
There's such a vast complexity that we 
life is the way that it is now because 

783
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:28,274
of all of the elements that were present
at the Times that they were present in 

784
00:35:31,581 --> 00:35:32,990
our reality.
And so,

785
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,270
and even if you take it on a software 
level,

786
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:38,280
like something like a,
what was that game spore,

787
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,520
um,
where it was like,

788
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,560
it was built on like generative entire 
university and they would and they would

789
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:45,864
kind of create on their own based on 
like your light touch and it would be 

790
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:49,620
infinite.
Jamie,

791
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:51,840
didn't you say that?
That got boring though,

792
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:54,000
because there's really nothing happening
in these infinite.

793
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,400
Oh,
that's a no,

794
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,140
no,
no man's sky.

795
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:58,491
Yep,
Yep,

796
00:35:58,491 --> 00:35:58,771
Yep,
Yep.

797
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:00,720
No Man's sky.
So similar idea.

798
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,561
Yeah.
Yeah.

799
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:03,440
That's,
you have to really,

800
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,450
you know,
the problem with those things is,

801
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,900
I know we're jumping around a lot,
but I just,

802
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,890
that's the whole show is the show.

803
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,270
Okay.
We jump around and were like,

804
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,163
okay,
so when should we start talking about 

805
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:14,911
whatever?
Yeah,

806
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:15,960
totally good.
I like it.

807
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,190
There's ain't no rules.
So when you,

808
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,440
oh,
so this is what is this?

809
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:24,210
These are creatures just came out like 
probably 10,

810
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:25,620
15 years ago.
It's just dope.

811
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,513
It starts super small,
little one celled organisms and works 

812
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:29,454
all the way up to a organism getting on 
land and then you're really running a 

813
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:34,820
whole planet.
So when these,

814
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,230
these things are happening,
these little fuckers evolve.

815
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,870
They evolve,
you can design,

816
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,120
you can design them.
That's hilarious.

817
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:43,620
And what do you,
what are your tasks?

818
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,483
Oh,
you have to fight and survive or 

819
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,123
whatever.
Or you can get lost in these fucking 

820
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,470
puddings,
man.

821
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,350
Then you can use.
And now there's like tribal culture with

822
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:53,184
a hierarchical leadership.
Now are these other things you're 

823
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,573
interacting with?
Artificial or the other humans playing 

824
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,670
games all.

825
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,260
Yeah.
This was multiplayer online stuff.

826
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,903
Yeah,
so basically you have all the way to 

827
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:07,980
space fairing too.
They're so cool looking.

828
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,960
They beat the fuck out of each other 
with sticks though.

829
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,700
I've got to get past that Shit,
man.

830
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,270
See?
See,

831
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,103
that's.
I know.

832
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,080
See that's the thing.
That's the thing about that makes us,

833
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,320
that's what I call human beings,
the human race simulation species.

834
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,080
It's like everything that we,
that we do,

835
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:22,914
we generate our ideas,
they're all based on like our 

836
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:29,280
observation of the world around us and 
then utilizing that in some way for our,

837
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,420
for ourselves and so like know design of
things,

838
00:37:33,421 --> 00:37:37,620
why we color things the way they are,
certain chemicals or why things are,

839
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,930
you know,
look the way they look or the shape,

840
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:44,700
the way they're shaped all of that.
So when I see a game about simulation,

841
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:48,630
of course we're going to make simulation
a game about simulations,

842
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:54,030
arguably a like children playing with 
dolls and figures and stuff like that.

843
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,863
It's another form of simulation,
but the idea of like having the 

844
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:57,654
awareness of another reality and 
projecting the idea that you want more 

845
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,750
with bigger,
I guess some more control.

846
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,603
Yeah.
I'm having control over representation 

847
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:12,980
of your idea of,
of a desired reality is crazy.

848
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,330
It's crazy.
I mean that's like,

849
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,990
that's like simulation within 
simulation,

850
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,020
within simulation,
within.

851
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,860
It's,
it's totally a,

852
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,880
to me,
a nice piece of evidence for that.

853
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,863
Yeah.
I think we're going to get better at it 

854
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,770
and it's going to get into certain 
animal.

855
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,703
You're going to be able to put some 
headphones on and they're going to plug 

856
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:29,460
some stuff,
maybe put some,

857
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,600
some of those,
uh,

858
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,470
greasy pads,
some wires,

859
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,220
some wetware yeah.
They're going to stuff connected

860
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,290
to your head and all these various 
places.

861
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,290
They're going to hook you up with this 
machine and you're going to go somewhere

862
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,390
that's so much cooler than reality.
You're going to be like,

863
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:44,950
fuck reality,
man.

864
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,460
You're gonna.
You're gonna,

865
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,210
you're gonna.
Go and do your stupid job at home depot.

866
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:50,680
And you're like,
fuck this job.

867
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,410
You're gonna come home and you're going 
to put that thing on.

868
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,600
I have to figure out a way to stay in 
here.

869
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,220
Stay in the world like surrogate tron 
world.

870
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,730
What surrogates recut the movie a Bruce 
Willis.

871
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,260
Oh yeah,
that's right.

872
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,880
I remember that movie.
Remember that?

873
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,890
It was all,
it was all about telepresence.

874
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,170
So people were like,
just in pods,

875
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,530
but it's Kinda like a robot bottom.

876
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,423
Yeah.
And there were people like jumping off 

877
00:39:17,351 --> 00:39:19,210
of buildings and shit because they 
could.

878
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,980
There were no consequences.
So they looked like underneath.

879
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,290
Yeah,
half.

880
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:30,910
Whoa.
Freaky surrogate robot.

881
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,080
Yeah.
Bruce Willis was younger.

882
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,420
There was like one of the first uses of 
CGI to,

883
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:36,430
to make someone younger in a movie.
Oh yeah,

884
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:37,420
that's right.
Like,

885
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,080
look how beautiful.
His skin looked.

886
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,520
Very smooth,
super smooth.

887
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,000
They just did that recently with,
um,

888
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,040
guardians of the galaxy two with who?
I'm Russell Kurt.

889
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:51,830
Russell is the bad guy.
Yeah.

890
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,773
You know,
the feet of the one time that I noticed 

891
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:56,590
the most was Tron,
the neutral.

892
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,180
That's where they,
like,

893
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,720
I remember that being like,
espouses this breakthrough to.

894
00:40:01,721 --> 00:40:03,660
I mean Benjamin Button,
like fake,

895
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:05,710
just fuck.
It looked fake as fuck.

896
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:06,544
I mean,
it wasn't a simulation in the fact that 

897
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:12,670
it wasn't a simulation.
A video game still looks fake within the

898
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,480
video.

899
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,130
Kurt Russell,
that looked amazing.

900
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,380
Simple dude.
He looked perfect.

901
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,210
I mean,
he looked really good.

902
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,460
It looks.
Yeah,

903
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,220
no,
that looks.

904
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,270
It looks like a 35 year old Kurt.
Russell was fucking incredible.

905
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,990
It looks great.
It is really good.

906
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,960
And the movie's Funny Shit.
Oh,

907
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:30,440
it's,
you're talking about too.

908
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,543
Yeah.
I,

909
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,553
you know,
the one thing that really pissed me off 

910
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:38,010
was that baby groot,
I hate when they put baby characters.

911
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,940
I don't like,
can't stand it.

912
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,580
It's so obvious.
It's such an obvious play.

913
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,310
It's just like,
it's like,

914
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,920
remember it is obvious when mark and 
mindy,

915
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:50,680
when they add a Jonathan winters.
I didn't,

916
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,470
I wasn't afraid of obvious things that 
are awesome,

917
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,470
like big tits.
They worked once.

918
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,360
Okay.
That's a totally different thing,

919
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:00,370
man.
It's a totally different thing,

920
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,230
but obvious things that are awesome.
There's a,

921
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,650
there's another.
I know that little baby groot was cute.

922
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,750
I could not stand that opening sequence 
with like the,

923
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,860
he's like being casual and he's taken 
out all the bad guys and I'm like,

924
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:14,070
that's so gross.
I thought when I was singing.

925
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,520
Oh yeah.
Like with the,

926
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,760
with the,
it's the opening sequence.

927
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,760
I loved it.
I mean I couldn't,

928
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:23,240
I didn't know.
You know what though?

929
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,360
Dude,
I'm a Dork.

930
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,473
Comic books man have always been a Dork 
for comic books and Comic Book Movies 

931
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,533
and I'm,
I'm so get like I'll make fun of people 

932
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:33,950
for like pro,
like,

933
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,050
you know,
it's fake.

934
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,490
You know,
it's like,

935
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:39,470
I know it's fake.
That's not the point.

936
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,100
Yeah,
it was.

937
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,200
Game of thrones is fake.
Tim will go back and forth.

938
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,373
Meanwhile,
I'll get fucking thrilled when David 

939
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,390
Bruce Banner turns into the hulk.
Oh,

940
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,410
I love that shit.
Yeah.

941
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:49,340
I get amped up.
Oh,

942
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,780
I love that.
That,

943
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:53,840
that I have no problem with.
That's so corny though.

944
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,900
I liked.
I liked.

945
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,050
No,
that's not going to make me angry.

946
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,180
I didn't like me when I'm angry.
I love that shit.

947
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,910
I always do that.
Have you ever heard that?

948
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:04,270
Uh Oh.
Can you imagine what's,

949
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,500
what's his name?
A British comedian.

950
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:12,100
I'm really brilliant.
Kind of all guy did a jerry springer the

951
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:16,410
musical and it didn't take.
It didn't take off.

952
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:18,370
And then all these questions like 
protesting,

953
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,970
um,
there are protests.

954
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,813
These music.
Yeah,

955
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,160
it was crazy.
It was like,

956
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:24,980
it was like really big and it didn't 
happen or something like that.

957
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,813
Like the theater,
like decided not to do it or something 

958
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:28,551
like that.
Oh,

959
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:30,320
that's fine.
I'm rich.

960
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,130
It's so crazy.
What is it?

961
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,670
Richard Thomas?
No,

962
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,110
no,
no,

963
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,260
no,
not Richard Thomas.

964
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,183
It's,
um,

965
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,820
he's got a,
he's got a program right now is on TV,

966
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,480
BBC,
but anyways,

967
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:45,860
he's this,
he's this brilliant.

968
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,773
Um,
he has a joke about Ang Lee guy did the 

969
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:51,201
hawk.
Yeah.

970
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,330
Yeah.
So yeah,

971
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:57,380
so his whole thing is just insane.
It's a long joke.

972
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:02,000
It takes like seven minutes.
The setup,

973
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:02,834
it's just him talking about how he was,
he worked with Angley and at the end of 

974
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,030
this interview he said,
Ang Lee,

975
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:19,180
you wouldn't like me when I'm Lee.
Something actually not getting it.

976
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:21,823
And then him explaining the whole lead 
up back to that again and then not 

977
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:29,180
getting it and explaining it again and 
it just goes,

978
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,230
it's,
it's,

979
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,070
I think I'm remembering it right.
But it's just brilliant man.

980
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:34,943
It's such an abstract,
weird slice of a way to get to a 

981
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:41,060
punchline and it's just,
it's perfect.

982
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:41,983
A Hog,
a punchline that's a hulk of arguably 

983
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:44,630
the worst hulk movie.
Yeah,

984
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,190
definitely.
Definitely.

985
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:49,430
The West Eric Bana one who's,
I loved him in chopper,

986
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,980
but it didn't love them as Bruce Banner.
Yeah.

987
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:52,814
Even though it was last name was banner 
and I thought that's pretty close to 

988
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:55,820
banner.
It didn't do it.

989
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,130
You know why terrible Bonnie on that 
movie.

990
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:01,190
I went to see it high.
And when you see high movies,

991
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,130
bad movies just like or offensive when 
you're high.

992
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:06,100
Like what?
What do you make believe?

993
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,490
But I know I'm aware of the illusion.
You're casting wizard.

994
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,260
Yeah,
that's a problem.

995
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,390
Maybe they had hot dogs in that one.
Yeah,

996
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:18,590
I didn't service it was like three,
three or two headed dogs.

997
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,510
Was that two headed?
I remember it was a dog.

998
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,500
Yes.
I think it had more than one head.

999
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:27,370
I think because it was.
It was nick nolte,

1000
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:28,630
his dogs.
He was the dad.

1001
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:30,320
Remember he was a scientist.
Dad?

1002
00:44:30,321 --> 00:44:31,154
Yeah,
that's right.

1003
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:32,240
They turn into a jellyfish

1004
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,630
set.
That one returning to jellyfish.

1005
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,900
At the end he had jellyfish dogs.
Look at them.

1006
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,310
Oh yeah.
No,

1007
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:40,930
they weren't holding down poodle in the 
hotel pistol.

1008
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,380
Weird.
What a weird look at them.

1009
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,333
That's amazing.
What a strange thing going to be facing 

1010
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,640
down poodle.
I mean.

1011
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,360
Yeah,
that's.

1012
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,590
Yeah,
I remember that happened.

1013
00:44:55,591 --> 00:44:59,070
It essentially turned into the hulk 
versus a hog dog,

1014
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,083
so when the dogs would get fired up,
the same thing would happen to them as 

1015
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:03,660
happened to the right.
Yeah,

1016
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,120
that's right.
Hulk dogs get bigger.

1017
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:06,983
Look at that thing.
Bite them on the back and didn't he get 

1018
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:13,020
bigger depending upon how much fucked up
shit was happening in his life.

1019
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:13,933
Like he shot him with bullets.
He kept getting bigger and bigger and 

1020
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:17,430
bigger and bigger.
Yeah,

1021
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:18,360
maybe.
Oh yeah,

1022
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:19,194
that's right.
Yeah,

1023
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:19,871
I remember that.
Yeah,

1024
00:45:19,871 --> 00:45:22,020
because he just keeps absorbing the 
energy.

1025
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,190
Yeah.
So like in the nuclear plant matter,

1026
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,010
it just kept getting bigger.
That's right.

1027
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:30,510
Could you fucking imagine like of all 
the superpowers,

1028
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,720
that's the one that I think so appeals 
to kids like me when I was young,

1029
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:40,450
I was little and worried about the world
and nervous and you know,

1030
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:41,284
you get picked on you like how cool 
would it be to just be able to just get 

1031
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:45,834
angry and all of a sudden become this 
bulletproof thing that can leak through 

1032
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:53,130
the air.
That's the most.

1033
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:54,760
It's like freedom.
Yeah.

1034
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,210
Freedom.
But it was so corny,

1035
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,890
like the words that he would say that 
they.

1036
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,650
You could only read it.
Oh yeah.

1037
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:04,290
It as a comic book,
when you're reading a comic book,

1038
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:09,350
it's different than when you hear people
speaking like the avengers when he takes

1039
00:46:09,661 --> 00:46:10,220
a.
What is it?

1040
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,580
Loci loci pizza.
The fuck out of him.

1041
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,650
He knew human.
Oh yeah.

1042
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,553
No,
no,

1043
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,780
no,
no,

1044
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,110
no.
But if you saw the 19 seventies hulk,

1045
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,010
Lou ferrigno just like,
I mean comic,

1046
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,680
like just like,
like he's beating the fuck out of Blokey

1047
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:29,933
bloke.
He's kind of like,

1048
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,223
like kind of fucked up and all.
Because just being emotionless and said 

1049
00:46:34,051 --> 00:46:35,430
that you'd be like,
yeah,

1050
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,353
that makes sense.
He would say that he would definitely 

1051
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:38,700
say that.
And that's cool.

1052
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,463
Yeah.
There's a lot of things that you could 

1053
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:43,050
only read people saying.
Yeah,

1054
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,590
totally.
Like Annie Cap.

1055
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,210
I mean,
no one says,

1056
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,290
yeah,
Andy Capp.

1057
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,950
Wow.
That's a blast from the past.

1058
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,760
Titch.
Is there any more cartoons?

1059
00:46:56,761 --> 00:46:58,920
Are there any more dilbert's out there 
in the world?

1060
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,650
Do you mean like hand drawn comic 
strips?

1061
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:04,300
They're big ones that people like look 
forward to everyday.

1062
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,600
There must be.
You're about to hear from some.

1063
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:07,680
From.
Sure.

1064
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,673
Right.
Get ready to read the newspaper 

1065
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,170
probably.
Right,

1066
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,003
right.
But who the fuck reads newspapers 

1067
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:14,430
anymore?
I don't know man.

1068
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,211
Yeah.
And,

1069
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:16,710
and,
and online publications,

1070
00:47:16,711 --> 00:47:19,230
unless it's The new yorker,
you usually don't do,

1071
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,620
um,
comic strips.

1072
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:22,843
It's just the articles and if they do,
it's probably like a one off by an 

1073
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:29,140
artist rather than a series like Andy 
Capp or Dilbert or,

1074
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,870
you know what I mean?
Totally.

1075
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,153
It's maybe a one off with Obama and 
trump standing next to each other 

1076
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,780
talking or something like that.
Yeah,

1077
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:36,430
yeah,
exactly.

1078
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:39,750
It's just a picture.
It's like playboy style picture.

1079
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,830
The punchline.
Joke underneath.

1080
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:42,743
Yeah.
I remember those playboy ones where 

1081
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:44,410
you're like,
whoa,

1082
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:45,970
this is crazy.
I was a little kid.

1083
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Get Ahold of them and be like,
what in the fuck am I reading right now?

1084
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:50,203
General,
their tits popping out and the guys 

1085
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,460
trying to grab her and it's humor.

1086
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:56,830
Adult humor.
It's adult humor,

1087
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:57,664
but today it's totally rape culture,
like a lot of shit that was in playboy 

1088
00:48:00,521 --> 00:48:01,354
magazine and those,
those ads that if you saw or those 

1089
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:06,160
cartoons rather than as you saw today,
you'd be like,

1090
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:09,850
you can't print this because there's no 
fucking way.

1091
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,650
No way is a.
I mean it's.

1092
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,040
Is it as bad?
No,

1093
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:14,830
it is.
It is.

1094
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:17,920
I was just gonna say this is as bad as 
Mickey Rooney in breakfast at Tiffany's.

1095
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,680
I don't remember that movie.
Yeah,

1096
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,600
that don't.
I mean watch it,

1097
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:25,030
but as soon as Mickey Rooney's character
comes on,

1098
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,690
I've ever seen that.
Which doesn't really know.

1099
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:29,524
It makes sense.
Breakfast at tiffany's is like one of 

1100
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,330
those movies you,
you hear about all the time,

1101
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,540
but you may not ever see it.
Yeah.

1102
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,400
That might be the case.
Yeah.

1103
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,293
I might not have ever seen it.
I remember trying to see it and I 

1104
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,240
couldn't.

1105
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,310
I couldn't finish it because of Mickey 
Rooney.

1106
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,420
He plays a Chinese man.
Oh God.

1107
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,570
That's running Japanese.
Japanese is Japanese stores.

1108
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,490
You wearing a Japanese thing saying he's
Chinese says Mr.

1109
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:02,800
Jeff [inaudible] Japanese.
Yeah.

1110
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,710
Okay.
So at least I thought I was going to get

1111
00:49:05,711 --> 00:49:09,970
really terrible with like mixing Asian 
cultures,

1112
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,163
but apparently you remember when Katie 
Perry had apologized for wearing a 

1113
00:49:13,991 --> 00:49:15,520
kimono because,
uh,

1114
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,533
people felt like it was offensive 
Japanese people that she was culturally 

1115
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:20,410
appropriating.
She was like,

1116
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:25,330
had this big sit down with a,
I don't know about her.

1117
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:27,183
One of her album covers.
That was a different time when it was 

1118
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:30,281
acceptable.
Oh,

1119
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:31,150
you're right.
You're right.

1120
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,060
No,
no.

1121
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,850
Last grandmother died.
So,

1122
00:49:34,851 --> 00:49:35,684
uh,
she,

1123
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:39,490
she had apologized and she,
when she was apologizing,

1124
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,750
remember she made this video that will 
make your fucking brain hurt.

1125
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,570
She's sitting there with a dream.
How do you say,

1126
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:49,780
Maxon from black lives matter and 
they're sitting on a couch,

1127
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:51,730
cross legged with their shoes off.

1128
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:52,990
Which by the way,
nobody knows.

1129
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:53,883
Nobody knows.
It's you sit down that like that with 

1130
00:49:55,661 --> 00:49:56,051
me.
I'm like,

1131
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:57,100
Hey,
what are we doing here?

1132
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:58,463
I said,
that's trying to be comfortable with it 

1133
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,140
looks weird,
terrible setup.

1134
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:03,003
How about we just give us a comfy chair.
I sit here and talk to each other like 

1135
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:06,023
fucking humans.
It would be different if they were on 

1136
00:50:06,961 --> 00:50:11,650
like kind of organic looking furniture 
and they were dressed more as like human

1137
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:13,000
people.
Um,

1138
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:15,010
and I don't know,
you know what I mean?

1139
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,960
Well,
she was addressing other hair.

1140
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:19,600
This was the thing,
she had a dress her hair because she did

1141
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:20,434
something where she had braids and 
people were getting mad at her because 

1142
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:25,450
she culturally appropriate it.
And then she also addressed her,

1143
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,010
her idea of dressing like a

1144
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,873
geisha.
So the problem is when they went over 

1145
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,130
and talked to people,
Geishas are from,

1146
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,120
we're geishas from.

1147
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,160
Why don't want to say China,
Japan,

1148
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:42,490
Japan is Japan,
right.

1149
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,930
It's like the thing that people just 
don't understand.

1150
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:46,823
So they went over there,
there's the braids and she had 

1151
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:50,880
apologized for,
that's her Katy Perry.

1152
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,270
Damn.
She looked good.

1153
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,200
She's no good deal.
Um,

1154
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:59,340
so they went over to Japan to talk to 
these folks and they universally,

1155
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,233
we're saying when the interviewed people
in the street that they're happy that 

1156
00:51:01,741 --> 00:51:02,574
someone is expressing Japanese culture 
and that they're aware of Japanese 

1157
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:05,754
culture.
And they thought it was a very good 

1158
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:08,400
thing.
They didn't think it was interesting,

1159
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:09,343
like they don't have the same feelings 
about cultural appropriation as some 

1160
00:51:11,821 --> 00:51:13,950
people do with fucking braids.

1161
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

1162
00:51:16,001 --> 00:51:16,660
I get it.
Well,

1163
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,260
but it's the United States,
right?

1164
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:20,860
We're sending it over super sensitive.
We've gotten very expensive.

1165
00:51:20,861 --> 00:51:21,694
You know what it is?
It all comes from a litigious culture 

1166
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,210
that's.
Oh,

1167
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:27,063
absolutely.
The fact that you can get sued for 

1168
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:30,450
anything.
Anybody can sue you at anytime.

1169
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,170
That's just like,
that's American culture.

1170
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,430
That's what you do.
It's like,

1171
00:51:33,431 --> 00:51:34,264
you know what,
you pissed off someone like enough you 

1172
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:39,520
can sue them,
and so there's a lot of like swimming,

1173
00:51:39,521 --> 00:51:40,354
swimming,
swimming and enough successful cases 

1174
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:43,720
along the way.
That's part of,

1175
00:51:43,721 --> 00:51:48,430
it's like a fear based operating system,
calling people on Shit.

1176
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,513
Yeah.
Maybe they didn't even think was bad 

1177
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:51,783
yet.
It's a combination of like someone like 

1178
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,170
it's a good service to be able to sue 
someone if you need it to.

1179
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,770
However it's abused of the hanging and 
there's professional lawyers.

1180
00:51:59,771 --> 00:52:00,910
They have billboards everywhere.

1181
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,920
But do you think Katy Perry was worried 
about being sued?

1182
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,083
No,
I'm saying that I'm saying that the 

1183
00:52:05,081 --> 00:52:08,320
sensitivity is like why?
Why we're so,

1184
00:52:08,321 --> 00:52:12,520
what American culture is so pc at this 
point,

1185
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,730
because there's a,
it kind of goes hand in hand.

1186
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,770
It's like a sense of,
well,

1187
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,081
I don't know,
I'm,

1188
00:52:19,081 --> 00:52:20,980
I'm at a loss and a little bit to stand,
but,

1189
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:21,873
but I will say it's it having that 
litigious fear based kind of motivator 

1190
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:31,870
or it causes people to want to correct 
things like to course correct,

1191
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:32,733
to,
uh,

1192
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,600
to a form of something that works for 
everyone to avoid being sued too.

1193
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,010
I mean,
not directly,

1194
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,380
not directly,
but that thought process.

1195
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:42,370
Yeah,
that mindset.

1196
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,390
Yeah,
that mindset.

1197
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,550
I think that's because it's about like,
okay,

1198
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:49,060
well how can we make this,
we have to include everybody on this,

1199
00:52:49,061 --> 00:52:51,910
which I believe in,
but absolutely.

1200
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,013
But,
uh,

1201
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,320
but I think it should be done out of a 
sense of empathy,

1202
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:57,750
you know,
and not to say that,

1203
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:58,690
that,
that,

1204
00:52:58,750 --> 00:52:59,583
you know,
people fighting for rights to have 

1205
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,250
handicap parking in the front of the 
building.

1206
00:53:03,251 --> 00:53:05,890
Like that's,
that's just a great idea.

1207
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:09,700
But like I'm just saying that,
that what we were kind of referring to,

1208
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:10,863
that sensitivity come,
comes from that where someone's like 

1209
00:53:13,031 --> 00:53:13,864
afraid of doing something wrong and it 
just starts feeding back and feeding 

1210
00:53:16,751 --> 00:53:17,531
back,
feeding back,

1211
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:20,800
and then you get people so fearful of 
any choice that they're making.

1212
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,900
Because I feel it,
you know,

1213
00:53:22,901 --> 00:53:24,730
every time I walk into a grocery store,
I'm like,

1214
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,520
this entire store

1215
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:30,120
could be reduced to five percent the 
volume that it,

1216
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,013
that it is right now,
and the amount of people in that store 

1217
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:35,840
would have all the products they need.
Hm.

1218
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,720
So the inundation of choice,
choice,

1219
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:40,381
choice,
choice,

1220
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:43,380
choice and fear of doing something 
wrong.

1221
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:47,430
Whether it's because I love to look 
perfect or I want to look perfect,

1222
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,043
or whatever it is.
That all mix that all together and it's 

1223
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:54,810
a recipe for.
I think it's a fabulous for sure.

1224
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,153
I think another factor though is that 
people get to complain and that people 

1225
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:04,110
don't like when people are mad at them.
So when you have a giant group of people

1226
00:54:04,111 --> 00:54:06,540
that can communicate instantaneously 
with,

1227
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:07,643
with anybody at any time,
you're going to get more prevalence of 

1228
00:54:12,151 --> 00:54:12,984
complaining.
It's the same percentage of people are 

1229
00:54:14,491 --> 00:54:17,220
complaining,
but they weren't able to access everyone

1230
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:21,000
as they were to get to Katy Perry and 
bitch about her wearing braids.

1231
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,650
Right.
So in the past,

1232
00:54:22,651 --> 00:54:25,980
like in the low derek days and bowed,
Derek wore braids and 10,

1233
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:30,190
which is really for that was that was 
nobody was wearing those,

1234
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,640
seen that,
not on that level.

1235
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:36,690
I mean was that a thing in black culture
back then and the Bo Derek days?

1236
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,220
What do you mean?
Like braids?

1237
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,680
Cornrows thinks since I think the slave 
days.

1238
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,850
Some days.
Yeah.

1239
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:46,410
But brands have also been in almost 
every culture braids for sure.

1240
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:49,920
But those crazy cornrows like that,
those that,

1241
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,630
that was that.
Yeah,

1242
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:53,940
that was a direct reference I think to 
like Lord,

1243
00:54:53,941 --> 00:54:58,941
she was Caribbean spooky hot.
She ruined your life.

1244
00:54:59,281 --> 00:55:01,710
She was next door.
She was,

1245
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:02,603
yeah.
She wouldn't get anything done if you 

1246
00:55:03,451 --> 00:55:04,284
were banging her very interesting 
[inaudible] you would have to like keep 

1247
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:07,374
an eye on.
Are All the time were you going to stay 

1248
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:10,830
put?
I mean,

1249
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:11,873
but at the same time if you learn to be 
completely confident next to someone 

1250
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:17,220
like that,
I mean come on.

1251
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:22,250
That's like Max good fucking luck when I
can't pull it off.

1252
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,040
You couldn't hold it all the time.
I,

1253
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,790
I would,
I would have no problem.

1254
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,913
You'd have to not want to fuck her.
You'd have to like be married and happy 

1255
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:37,440
and successful and not want to fuck her 
and just like really just be comfortable

1256
00:55:37,441 --> 00:55:38,274
being around her.
Do you think just because you want to 

1257
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:40,344
have sex on that possibility,
the possibility to fuck someone that's 

1258
00:55:44,371 --> 00:55:47,940
that hot is always a problem for men.
Especially back then.

1259
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:48,950
Yeah,
it.

1260
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:53,790
Yeah.
I mean I think the initial making a move

1261
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:54,624
and all that stuff,
but I think like obviously if you get 

1262
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,770
used to someone and their personality,
like the,

1263
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,610
it starts to calibrate,
you know?

1264
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,830
It's just a better person,
a better person to go around her.

1265
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,430
She couldn't,
she could,

1266
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:06,720
if she were great it,
she,

1267
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:07,460
she,
she could.

1268
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,200
If she had a great attitude,
she was a positive person.

1269
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,480
You just want her to like you more or 
maybe not.

1270
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,673
Yeah.
Right,

1271
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,620
right.
I Dunno,

1272
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:15,503
I've made,
I've,

1273
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:18,690
I've just said like,
I know what you're saying,

1274
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,040
but I'm like,
at the same time,

1275
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:21,810
I take that as a personal challenge and 
be like,

1276
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:22,411
okay,
fine.

1277
00:56:22,411 --> 00:56:26,270
How can I be confident around her?
I set it up,

1278
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:28,300
I trust you.
I trust me.

1279
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:32,020
Everything's going to be like,
I really think that,

1280
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,770
that this complaining thing is what's 
going on.

1281
00:56:34,771 --> 00:56:36,640
So nobody likes to have people mad at 
them,

1282
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,710
you know?
And that's why people get mad at people.

1283
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:40,480
This is why people get mad at people 
over nothing.

1284
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,330
They love to find someone who fucked up 
and get mad.

1285
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:45,070
Like we were talking about this 
yesterday,

1286
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:50,071
the Anthony Bordain casual response that
he had at the airport by TMZ that became

1287
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:54,460
this huge thing where they said,
if you had a serve dinner to Kim Jong Un

1288
00:56:54,461 --> 00:56:55,750
and Donald Trump,
what would you serve?

1289
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,010
He goes,
hemlock.

1290
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:58,950
And they walked away,
which is hilarious.

1291
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:03,100
Every time it's a job.
Well done.

1292
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:07,390
And then I was reading all the responses
on tmz about,

1293
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:08,224
you know,
uh,

1294
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,540
get the secret service on him.
He's threatening Podesta,

1295
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:12,220
you know,
like,

1296
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,240
oh,
that's really where we,

1297
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,113
it's like they,
if you are really offended by that 

1298
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,253
really offends you,
that you were a such a monumental pussy 

1299
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,833
that you deserve.
You don't deserve to have an opinion on 

1300
00:57:24,581 --> 00:57:25,414
things like,
if that really bothered you to your 

1301
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:30,190
core,
I can't believe he's threatening potus.

1302
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,173
Like,
you are such a fucking baby that you 

1303
00:57:33,581 --> 00:57:35,260
shouldn't be allowed to talk about 
things.

1304
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:38,020
Your opinion,
it can't get in,

1305
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,400
can't get in.
You're not allowed.

1306
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:42,790
And there was hundreds of those people 
that were commenting on the TMZ thing.

1307
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:43,803
And I realized like this is just a 
consequence of people being able to 

1308
00:57:46,151 --> 00:57:48,160
communicate openly better.

1309
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,313
So because of that,
you're getting so many moments that 

1310
00:57:52,231 --> 00:57:54,630
they're feeling it and you're getting so
many people's opinions,

1311
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,473
just you don't care for.
You don't want to hear you don't 

1312
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,930
appreciate or respect their intellect 
and their spouting out nonsense.

1313
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,420
But if you're a person who has to hear 
that,

1314
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:05,254
it hurts.
If you read something that's saying 

1315
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:09,610
someone's saying really mean Shit about 
Katy Perry and her hair,

1316
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,444
this fucking bitch thinks she's going to
appropriate black culture and this and 

1317
00:58:12,861 --> 00:58:14,440
that.
Fuck you hoe.

1318
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:15,373
And she starts reading that,
the panic that sets in thinking that 

1319
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,083
poor Katy Perry this.
There's bodyguards and fucking machine 

1320
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:25,090
guns looking out the windows and Katy 
Perry's in her beverly hills mansion and

1321
00:58:25,091 --> 00:58:26,650
all these girls that I'll fucking cut 
you.

1322
00:58:26,651 --> 00:58:27,401
Whoa.
Oh No,

1323
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:28,910
they're gonna cut me.
Oh No.

1324
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,950
She's like a little water balloon 
walking around her.

1325
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:37,950
Her Beverly Hills Mansion where there's 
soft soft body worried that.

1326
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:39,023
That's tough man.
This fucking bitch thinks she can take 

1327
00:58:40,781 --> 00:58:42,180
our hair.
Bitch.

1328
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:43,043
As she said.
She said that she's worried about that 

1329
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:46,180
stuff.
No,

1330
00:58:46,181 --> 00:58:51,181
I'm just making the scenario.
This is the drama.

1331
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,790
Yeah.
It's so funny.

1332
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:56,920
I mean like for me,
I read almost.

1333
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:58,003
I'm almost all tweets like,
because there's not that many actually 

1334
00:59:01,631 --> 00:59:02,830
in mentions.
Right?

1335
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:04,770
So you read almost all the ones that 
come to you.

1336
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,940
You should never said that you've get 
fucked up son.

1337
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,490
Yeah,
yeah,

1338
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,050
yeah.
No,

1339
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,470
I tell people,
I've told people that before.

1340
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,710
Um,
I mean I'm not responding to all of them

1341
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:18,280
and I might not get everyone,
but I'm just saying in general,

1342
00:59:18,281 --> 00:59:21,070
it's not that it's not that bad.
Like it's like I can,

1343
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:24,830
I can actually read through a lot and 
it's always interesting,

1344
00:59:24,831 --> 00:59:27,180
like if someone brings up a point,
sometimes they'll,

1345
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,360
they'll attack it,
a really hostile angle.

1346
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,930
Like at first they'll be like,
no,

1347
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,170
you're not funny,
blah,

1348
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:33,591
blah blah,
blah,

1349
00:59:33,591 --> 00:59:34,370
blah,
whatever,

1350
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:34,791
whatever,
whatever,

1351
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:36,110
whatever.
And I'll be like,

1352
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:37,203
so I'll either do two things,
I'll either answer it in an interesting 

1353
00:59:40,221 --> 00:59:43,370
way that kind of addresses their point 
or um,

1354
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,860
or I'll be like,
okay,

1355
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:49,280
why do you feel this way?
And then talk about it and through a few

1356
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:51,680
exchanges and oftentimes at the end of 
it someone's like,

1357
00:59:51,681 --> 00:59:52,730
oh,
thanks for taking the time.

1358
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:53,564
I'll be like,
oh yeah,

1359
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:54,620
no problem.
I just wanted,

1360
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,320
I was just wondering what you meant.
That's all I like.

1361
00:59:57,321 --> 00:59:59,330
I like criticism,
I don't mind criticism.

1362
00:59:59,331 --> 01:00:03,320
I'm not going to be like if I had a 
shitty show and someone was like,

1363
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,520
yeah,
it wasn't so great,

1364
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,600
I'd be like,
you know what,

1365
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,780
you're right.
It wasn't that great and which I love,

1366
01:00:08,781 --> 01:00:09,614
I love like having that dialogue and 
just being like either open some things 

1367
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:14,510
I don't answer,
but you know,

1368
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,220
most things,
most things I'll,

1369
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,330
I'll,
if it's,

1370
01:00:17,331 --> 01:00:18,780
if it has a good point,
yeah,

1371
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:19,910
I'll go for it.

1372
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,333
Yeah.
I mean the ability to communicate with 

1373
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:24,880
people has its pros and cons for sure.
Absolutely.

1374
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:26,870
It just does a lot of pros.
You've got to be able to,

1375
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,753
you know,
you gotta you got to moderate yourself 

1376
01:00:29,661 --> 01:00:30,494
and you've got to create some like some,
some filters and like understand like 

1377
01:00:33,201 --> 01:00:35,870
how to just process something very 
quickly and just be like,

1378
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,660
is this worth energy or not?
Okay,

1379
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:39,703
no energy when you're someone like Katy 
Perry to you riding on this wave of 

1380
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:44,480
popularity.
I mean,

1381
01:00:44,481 --> 01:00:45,314
it's not to say that she's not talented.
She certainly is a talented singer and 

1382
01:00:49,461 --> 01:00:51,950
performer.
Been a big part of who she is.

1383
01:00:51,951 --> 01:00:55,940
Relies on her attractiveness and her 
cultural relevance.

1384
01:00:55,941 --> 01:00:58,340
Like how famous she is right now.
I mean,

1385
01:00:58,341 --> 01:00:59,840
she's,
she's not like,

1386
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,390
we're not talking about like,
uh,

1387
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,093
you know,
Liz phair cat power or someone who's 

1388
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,750
just like only doing their job.

1389
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,270
Someone was only doing their shit and 
you didn't like it.

1390
01:01:11,271 --> 01:01:12,104
He don't like it.
No.

1391
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:17,240
She's a rock star.
She's a pop star through culture.

1392
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:18,093
And when you,
what are you doing when you show me 

1393
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:19,933
$100?
Million followers or $100 million 

1394
01:01:22,281 --> 01:01:23,680
followers on twitter?
Um,

1395
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:24,643
I'd like you to do it.
Twitter audit on that because I'm not 

1396
01:01:26,121 --> 01:01:27,830
buying 104.
I'll buy 80,

1397
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,080
85.
The David Bowie images.

1398
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:31,880
Pretty good.
Oh yeah,

1399
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:32,481
I know,
right?

1400
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:36,710
I guess it was probably really well done
in cultural appropriation.

1401
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:40,220
Cap was.
She's got British Kareel.

1402
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,390
Nope.
Mostly fake.

1403
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,950
Wow.
Fifty 8 million.

1404
01:01:42,951 --> 01:01:44,000
Fake.
So she.

1405
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:45,830
Katy Perry,
you fucking Hoe?

1406
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,170
I don't mean that.
Katie.

1407
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,110
Katie.
I'm just joking around.

1408
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,600
Don't get mad if we can sit on a couch 
together with no shoes on and we'll work

1409
01:01:53,601 --> 01:01:57,830
through this.
Like you have your accounts fake have to

1410
01:01:57,831 --> 01:01:59,150
wear.
But afterward booties though.

1411
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,010
Rugs.
Nowhere I'll,

1412
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:01,923
I'll make everybody uncomfortable.
And where will the five finger vibrams 

1413
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,780
please never do that.
Where am all the time?

1414
01:02:05,781 --> 01:02:07,470
They never do it.
Forty three.

1415
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:10,040
Never real.
Get some fake toast for the front of it.

1416
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,980
Snap on.
And what did you say?

1417
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:15,760
Forty 3 million real ones is a fucking.
No,

1418
01:02:15,761 --> 01:02:16,660
no,
it's not a lot.

1419
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:20,070
Of course you would have said 44.
I would have been like absolutely

1420
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,390
the 43.
Fuck that.

1421
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:22,540
Listen.
Yeah.

1422
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:25,980
I might not even be her fault.
It might be that she's so famous.

1423
01:02:25,981 --> 01:02:30,981
She attracts fake bots and accounts.
That's just joking around.

1424
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:35,290
There was a thing recently about donald 
trump's twitter followers went up by $30

1425
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:37,110
million or some crazy shit.
Isn't it?

1426
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:37,944
Something like that.
Like real quick people like those are 

1427
01:02:39,391 --> 01:02:41,610
all bots.
Absolutely.

1428
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,320
Absolutely.
It's a artificial inflation.

1429
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,540
Well that's like the king has no clothes
but.

1430
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:46,520
Well,
you know,

1431
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:47,110
uh,
the,

1432
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:47,943
the thing before that,
what you were saying about I'm a pop 

1433
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:54,030
star,
like how you look in your relevance.

1434
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:54,864
That's absolutely true.
And that's the thing I always feel for 

1435
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:58,523
in a way,
I feel for people that base their 

1436
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:05,050
careers on that because there is a way 
you can always transition for sure.

1437
01:03:05,051 --> 01:03:07,050
It's rough,
like you could do it,

1438
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,153
but um,
but when you're someone like Joni 

1439
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:10,853
Mitchell,
you know,

1440
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:15,860
who both was very striking but,
but obviously involved in the music that

1441
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:17,274
she made,
she was responsible for what she was 

1442
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,040
making and you knew that it was her,
her,

1443
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:22,090
whereas a pop star is like,
I dunno,

1444
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:23,880
they're using star gate from Sweden.

1445
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:24,713
They're using the writing team,
they're using writing team from 

1446
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:28,190
Australia.
They're using like,

1447
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,090
whatever.
You never know who's involved.

1448
01:03:30,091 --> 01:03:32,820
And sometimes maybe she writes her 
because I know that she,

1449
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:33,743
she was,
she plays guitar and writes original 

1450
01:03:35,701 --> 01:03:37,980
music.
Well that's the thing about,

1451
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:38,814
uh,
what's the skinny check back in back in 

1452
01:03:40,081 --> 01:03:43,410
the day,
Taylor swift thing that people enjoy the

1453
01:03:43,411 --> 01:03:44,650
skinny check.
Sorry to.

1454
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,013
The things that people really enjoy 
about Taylor swift is that she is a 

1455
01:03:48,361 --> 01:03:49,410
songwriter.
She writes her,

1456
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,273
she composes her own stuff is the vast 
majority of it was getting angry to ex 

1457
01:03:53,071 --> 01:03:54,720
boyfriends.
But that's her prerogative.

1458
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

1459
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,630
He likes young Gal.
She's very sensitive.

1460
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:01,160
She and that happened to break her heart
bed.

1461
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:05,760
She write a song about you or someone 
just might just because they want that.

1462
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:07,770
They valued that over the relationships.
Yeah.

1463
01:04:07,771 --> 01:04:08,800
They would just go on for that.

1464
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:09,653
Just getting,
trying to get that Kardashians thing 

1465
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:13,590
going on.
I'm trying to get a little fame off that

1466
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:16,050
song.
Just throw some bad decker way.

1467
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:18,570
Get her angry enough to put pen to 
paper.

1468
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,430
[inaudible] head.
It's a strat.

1469
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:23,490
Should fuck you up with a song though,
Dude.

1470
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:24,860
She comes hard.
Don't tell them.

1471
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:25,703
Don't let it happen.
She throws haymakers sad about Joe and 

1472
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,790
John Mayer.
I mean Joni Mitchell did that right?

1473
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:31,710
Sure.
Lot of our new carly Simon.

1474
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:32,550
Carly Simon.
Yeah.

1475
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:33,384
You're so vain.
You probably think this song is about 

1476
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:38,520
you.
You know.

1477
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:43,520
So she,
she come on.

1478
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:52,120
You've walked in to the party like you 
were amazing.

1479
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:01,290
So I mean people are mad.
She's not getting that good Dick.

1480
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:04,740
And he's angry.
He's got other choices.

1481
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,633
Angry.
He's decided to just live his life as a 

1482
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:10,510
sexual vagabond.
You can't just accept him for the freak,

1483
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:13,740
they just let him just wander through 
the world.

1484
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,480
It's okay.
Like you had a brief time with them,

1485
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:16,620
but no.
People,

1486
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,570
when they,
they want to own their own each other,

1487
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,030
you know,
he might've been vain.

1488
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:25,510
He might've just been,
he might've just been a liar.

1489
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,480
Oh yeah.
A bit annoying because then because then

1490
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:29,051
it's like,
well,

1491
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:31,480
it's not really about that a lot,
you know,

1492
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:32,200
it's like,
uh,

1493
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,700
what was the thing that happened with 
Kevin Hart recently where he just got,

1494
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:38,170
he just got in in.
He just got in front of it,

1495
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:39,004
like there was a woman that he ended up 
getting together with one night in Las 

1496
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,190
Vegas and the,
but uh,

1497
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,024
it was kind of a team,
like kind of cat fished a little bit 

1498
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:49,570
too,
like they got a tape of him or something

1499
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:51,040
like that.
And um,

1500
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:53,650
this is me just hearing it from other 
people.

1501
01:05:53,651 --> 01:05:54,790
So this is how informed I am.

1502
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:59,470
But I will say the point is they tried 
to extort him.

1503
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:03,070
He just immediately this morning and 
told everybody,

1504
01:06:03,071 --> 01:06:03,611
it's just like,
yeah,

1505
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:04,960
I fucked up.
And she was like,

1506
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,150
hey man,
as long as he comes back to me,

1507
01:06:07,151 --> 01:06:07,890
you know,
makes it,

1508
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:08,640
makes feel.
I mean,

1509
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,670
I'm totally paraphrasing everything but,
but what,

1510
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:12,613
what for her it's like he didn't lie.
How fascinating is it that there's 

1511
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:20,670
people that would like to target him as 
like an opportunity?

1512
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,650
Like he's sort of wholesome in a way,
but also a funny,

1513
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,000
you know?
Yeah,

1514
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:25,923
yeah,
yeah.

1515
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:26,840
What's so funny gaming,

1516
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:28,763
they're going after MBA players and 
athletes and nfl players just like that 

1517
01:06:31,531 --> 01:06:32,364
to targeting them and like looking at 
their instagram account now where 

1518
01:06:34,651 --> 01:06:35,410
they're going to be.

1519
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:36,243
Yeah,
just treat it as like a business 

1520
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,390
proposition.
It's like ransomware,

1521
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,990
but it's the human hilarious.
It's a weird time where time.

1522
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:47,540
It is a weird time for stuff like that.
You know?

1523
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:49,183
It's a weird time for just,
just to enter the interaction that we 

1524
01:06:52,911 --> 01:06:54,590
all have with each other.
It's just very strange.

1525
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:57,230
You just like,
it's all like the possibilities of where

1526
01:06:57,231 --> 01:06:58,064
this go.
It used to seem like I kind of saw how 

1527
01:07:00,741 --> 01:07:01,574
the world was going to go.
Can I remember like being a kid and 

1528
01:07:03,531 --> 01:07:06,080
being worried about the war with Russia?
Remember that?

1529
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,380
Do you remember like always being 
worried that felt good.

1530
01:07:08,381 --> 01:07:10,790
It was a good kind of fear.
Felt good.

1531
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:14,780
It was an established logic now,
but once that sort of dissolved,

1532
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:15,883
I felt like I kind of had a sense at 
least in some rough form of what the 

1533
01:07:20,571 --> 01:07:22,940
future was going to be like,
things are going to get better,

1534
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,570
people are going to get smarter,
life is going to advance and then all of

1535
01:07:26,571 --> 01:07:31,040
a sudden the internet came along and 
then any ideas that I had had about what

1536
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:32,350
the future was going to be like,
well now like,

1537
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:33,790
Huh,
we'll fucking.

1538
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,810
Who knows?
And it kept getting more.

1539
01:07:35,811 --> 01:07:38,000
Who knows?
And more who knows,

1540
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,850
who knows that I'm at right now.
It's just like,

1541
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,830
fuck man,
where is this going?

1542
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:44,743
I really think it's going to some weird 
virtual reality thing that people are 

1543
01:07:47,181 --> 01:07:49,280
going to plug into and it's going to be 
better than live.

1544
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:51,160
Well yeah,
I mean it's,

1545
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:51,940
you know,
it's,

1546
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,280
we're designing a better interface for 
it all the time,

1547
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,520
but right now we're limited to like 
little glowing rectangles.

1548
01:07:57,730 --> 01:07:58,563
We are,
but the kids that are super into video 

1549
01:07:59,981 --> 01:08:00,814
games,
they're essentially experiencing it 

1550
01:08:01,571 --> 01:08:02,404
right now just in a weird.
They're like right in front of the 

1551
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:07,420
screen,
like playing games.

1552
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,130
That's what I'm doing.
Do you do that all the time?

1553
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,360
Dude,
I had a,

1554
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,770
an issue for a few years with quake 
mine.

1555
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,580
There you go.
It's just really fun.

1556
01:08:16,581 --> 01:08:17,490
Multiplayer.
But I,

1557
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:20,050
I shy away from computer games now 
because of that.

1558
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,310
Too immersive to me.
Yeah Man,

1559
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,690
I'm,
I'm not good at.

1560
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:27,110
I'm not good at not doing things I enjoy
constantly.

1561
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:31,940
Well my thing is I like for me it's kind
of like short stories,

1562
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:34,240
so like binge watching.
Like I'll,

1563
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:39,250
I'll choose the easiest setting and I'll
just play a game though where you're not

1564
01:08:39,501 --> 01:08:41,080
interacting with other people online.

1565
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:41,913
Yeah,
I'm playing by myself or co op that my 

1566
01:08:44,751 --> 01:08:46,610
thing is like I,
I think games.

1567
01:08:46,611 --> 01:08:48,800
This is something when you're talking 
about like where's it going?

1568
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:49,693
You know,
I think what will help and what I think 

1569
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:52,994
people really dig is I think people are 
going to get tired of this first person 

1570
01:08:55,911 --> 01:08:57,370
shooters.
Like it's always like shooters.

1571
01:08:57,371 --> 01:08:57,880
Shoot,
shoot,

1572
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:58,480
shoot,
shoot,

1573
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,151
shoot,
explode,

1574
01:08:59,151 --> 01:09:02,270
explode suit.
I don't mind necessarily doing that.

1575
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:05,300
I like it when it's more cartoony.
And so I'm a fan of borderlands.

1576
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:08,480
It's kind of like this cool,
like a cel shaded.

1577
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:10,820
It looks like you're playing a comic 
book,

1578
01:09:10,821 --> 01:09:12,310
puzzle solving and stuff.
No,

1579
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,360
it's a first person shooter with lots of
guns,

1580
01:09:14,361 --> 01:09:15,194
lots of explosions,
but everything is like cartoony and mad 

1581
01:09:16,491 --> 01:09:20,710
maxy.
So it's not like crazy cartoony,

1582
01:09:20,711 --> 01:09:23,170
like just like comic book cards.
So.

1583
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:24,143
So there's like this cool joyfulness to 
it kind of video that I'd love to see 

1584
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:27,890
what that looks like.

1585
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:31,130
Tickets in borderlands two.
I've seen a picture.

1586
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:32,790
Ads I think.
Yeah,

1587
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:33,633
at the mall when you walk by the video 
games it kind of looks like a Mad Max 

1588
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:38,840
thing.
There's always like some guy with a gun,

1589
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:39,703
he's got his fingers to his head,
like he's blowing his brains out and 

1590
01:09:41,331 --> 01:09:43,280
then there's like some graphic,
like there you go.

1591
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:45,710
Oh yeah,
dudes wearing a gas mask.

1592
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:47,400
Cvs,
find the video yet.

1593
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:49,063
See what this looks.
It's a really fun game and you can pull 

1594
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:52,940
this sucker.
Um,

1595
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:53,660
I mean,
I don't,

1596
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:54,493
I,
I,

1597
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:58,910
I'm playing divinity to right now.
I like it.

1598
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,980
Well,
not that this is dope.

1599
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,980
This is what it looks like when you're 
playing it.

1600
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:05,563
Someone playing it right now.
This is live at the top thing that 

1601
01:10:07,151 --> 01:10:09,080
popped up.
Oh,

1602
01:10:09,081 --> 01:10:11,030
so we're watching someone live on 
twitch,

1603
01:10:11,031 --> 01:10:11,864
but what he's doing,
why is it so compelling and it is 

1604
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:15,884
compelling,
but why is it so compelling watching 

1605
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:18,170
people play games?

1606
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,960
It's hard to explain.
I think it's because,

1607
01:10:20,961 --> 01:10:21,561
um,
it's,

1608
01:10:21,561 --> 01:10:24,080
it's like a movie,
but it's,

1609
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:27,830
it's,
it's simulates real time action.

1610
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,530
Brian and from,
you know,

1611
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:32,150
the first person point of view.
And so it's kind of exciting.

1612
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:34,130
It's like,
did you ever see Hardcore Henry?

1613
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,270
No,
I did not.

1614
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,390
That movie is shot all first person I 
heard it was awesome.

1615
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:39,253
It's amazing.
It's some of the best fight stunt work 

1616
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:42,013
I've ever seen.
The choreography is insane and super 

1617
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:46,440
compelling.
I feel like my seven year old now,

1618
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:49,250
like if I take my seven year old to a 
restaurant and the TV's on,

1619
01:10:49,251 --> 01:10:50,380
they stare at the TV,
you know,

1620
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:51,223
little kids like Stereo TV.
I feel like that like you're talking 

1621
01:10:52,941 --> 01:10:54,180
about hardcore Henry.
Yeah,

1622
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:55,400
probably.
Probably pretty cool.

1623
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,200
But I'm able.
I'm just staring at this by now.

1624
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:59,540
Okay.
Well this is also a weird level.

1625
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,240
This is like some weird,
like extra thing.

1626
01:11:02,241 --> 01:11:06,260
This isn't the game because the game 
looks even more like deserty cartoony.

1627
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:09,830
This is like some like bonus,
whatever it is.

1628
01:11:09,831 --> 01:11:11,020
It's fucking awesome.
Oh yeah.

1629
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:13,010
Use that one.
Like sanctuary.

1630
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,190
I.
These are all people playing

1631
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,060
on twitch.
Yeah.

1632
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,043
Jesus.
I was hoping you're going to go to talk 

1633
01:11:18,751 --> 01:11:19,584
about this game.
This is a new game that's gotten really 

1634
01:11:20,971 --> 01:11:21,541
popular,
right?

1635
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:23,450
They're a player in nouns,
battle grounds,

1636
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:25,050
popular using twitch.
Really?

1637
01:11:25,051 --> 01:11:28,050
So this is a battle royale games.
So we're like the hunger games if you've

1638
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:32,580
seen that for combat supply.
So like what can you.

1639
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:33,510
Survival.
What,

1640
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:34,363
what can you use?
You can use a gun or you drop 100 

1641
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:39,180
players drop into a map.
It's an island,

1642
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:44,030
it's about five square miles encroaches 
overtime,

1643
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,273
circled comes in and starts killing you 
as you come in to have to find 

1644
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:50,790
solicitor.
It's moving all of the guns and anything

1645
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:51,624
you find in the map,
is it randomly placed around the map so 

1646
01:11:53,551 --> 01:11:56,010
you're starting.
Everyone starts this scratch with just a

1647
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:59,670
fist and your goal is to survive or play
hide and seek.

1648
01:11:59,671 --> 01:12:03,930
So either you become the bad ass that 
kills everyone or jacked or are you just

1649
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:04,764
hide and just survive to the end,
but meanwhile people are watching this 

1650
01:12:06,841 --> 01:12:10,080
on twitch also.
It's kind of a popular thing to watch on

1651
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:10,914
there too.

1652
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:13,620
It makes sense though because like 
you're seeing all these.

1653
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:15,480
It's like watching a gladiator match.
Yeah,

1654
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:17,040
but hold on.
If they're watching on

1655
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:17,963
which can someone have a chat in the 
other screen where the person is 

1656
01:12:20,371 --> 01:12:22,830
playing,
can read the chat where people are.

1657
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:26,340
I've been doing that recently and like 
they can talk to me while I'm playing.

1658
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:27,203
They get a tip.
Sometimes I'll miss something like I'll 

1659
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:30,000
just skip a scope and like,
hey,

1660
01:12:30,001 --> 01:12:31,800
you missed the scope or you missed that 
awesome gun.

1661
01:12:31,801 --> 01:12:33,810
Go back and get it,
but my question is,

1662
01:12:33,811 --> 01:12:34,644
is it possible for them to also be 
monitoring the other people in the game 

1663
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:39,540
and tell you where those people are?
It's not.

1664
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:40,374
That's called stream sniping and that's 
a cheating thing that's being handled 

1665
01:12:43,411 --> 01:12:45,000
right now.
How's this being handled?

1666
01:12:45,001 --> 01:12:45,834
You can delay your stream a little bit.
You can hide different things that give 

1667
01:12:48,061 --> 01:12:51,780
away your location on the map.
Like it's a setting that you can have.

1668
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:52,614
Can you have a problem with people being
able to chat with each other a little 

1669
01:12:57,361 --> 01:12:58,194
bit.
So like mighty mouse is actually doing 

1670
01:12:58,951 --> 01:13:01,500
this too.
And he did a custom game with all of his

1671
01:13:01,501 --> 01:13:04,290
fans and 100 people that were just 
watching him.

1672
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:08,450
I jumped into we're all playing and to 
and you'll just.

1673
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:09,293
People end up going to attack them 
because they wouldn't be the guy that 

1674
01:13:11,461 --> 01:13:13,230
killed mighty mouse in the game or 
whatever it is.

1675
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:14,064
But like

1676
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,910
I want to be the one to kill.
That's amazing.

1677
01:13:17,911 --> 01:13:18,920
He's gonna.
Yeah.

1678
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:23,540
But the thing that I like,
I like co op games so I like fighting ai

1679
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:24,930
with other humans.
Like,

1680
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:25,341
you know,
like,

1681
01:13:25,341 --> 01:13:26,174
like people either like that or they're 
coming because what I discovered when I 

1682
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:29,940
was playing,
um,

1683
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:31,763
uh,
wait,

1684
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,150
what was it called?
The game with the Max?

1685
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:37,520
The new one?

1686
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,290
Yeah.
Noodles.

1687
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:41,210
Max Mixer.
A robot suits exoskeletons.

1688
01:13:41,211 --> 01:13:43,040
Okay.
But more like walking tanks.

1689
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:45,050
Um,
uh,

1690
01:13:45,051 --> 01:13:46,200
yeah,
that's crazy.

1691
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:47,113
It's like a hugely popular game,
but I was playing it and it's one of 

1692
01:13:49,611 --> 01:13:54,611
those like massive multiplayer games.
And like every time it starts,

1693
01:13:54,681 --> 01:13:57,890
like there's all these people running 
around and you don't know anybody.

1694
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,160
You might might,
but I didn't and I would just get killed

1695
01:14:01,161 --> 01:14:04,790
within milliseconds.
Did you ever play fun?

1696
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:06,530
Do you ever play unreal?
No.

1697
01:14:06,531 --> 01:14:07,640
No.
Unreal tournament.

1698
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:08,161
Yeah.
Well,

1699
01:14:08,161 --> 01:14:11,030
unreal and unreal tournament does.
That was another one that kind of.

1700
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:12,250
Oh,
Gotcha.

1701
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:12,870
What?
Quake.

1702
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:13,540
Quake.
Buck.

1703
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:15,690
And they had all these crazy cool 
weapons.

1704
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:18,190
It's amazing graphics.
That's what these all are.

1705
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:19,870
They're all,
they're all that.

1706
01:14:19,871 --> 01:14:23,590
It's like massive weapon systems.
You're switching weapons constantly.

1707
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:25,780
You can craft weapons,
you can get,

1708
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:26,623
you can collect ingredients.
Craft weapons like divinity to isn't 

1709
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,053
interesting.

1710
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,920
Titanfall,
titanfall.

1711
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:33,970
Oh yeah.
That's a huge game,

1712
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:34,810
right?
Yeah,

1713
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:37,690
it's in there,
it's gorgeous.

1714
01:14:37,691 --> 01:14:39,730
I love Mech suits,
like who doesn't like being,

1715
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:41,080
like where you're talking about being 
the hulk.

1716
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:44,320
This is what you get to be like this 
massive machine.

1717
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,370
Um,
so it's,

1718
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:47,380
it's,
it's really cool.

1719
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:48,214
But I was just like so bad at it.
It was just to Lincoln and killed these 

1720
01:14:51,551 --> 01:14:53,410
fucking kids today and it wasn't too 
fun.

1721
01:14:53,411 --> 01:14:55,150
Games that I was like,
this is cool.

1722
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:56,043
You know,
it's,

1723
01:14:56,380 --> 01:15:00,370
it's cool to imagine you know,
yourself in these situations is cool.

1724
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:03,490
But I also like playing cooperatively.
So if I was doing this,

1725
01:15:03,491 --> 01:15:07,840
playing with other players and um,
I had a team,

1726
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:08,674
I guess that would be something I would 
try being on a team against other human 

1727
01:15:12,401 --> 01:15:13,234
beings just so fucking much time.
You have to take your life to play 

1728
01:15:17,381 --> 01:15:17,680
these.

1729
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,600
Here's,
here's the thing that you might get into

1730
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,430
warehouse scale.
Our RPG vr vr rpgs.

1731
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:25,780
Oh,
I've heard of that.

1732
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:26,900
Yeah,
I've heard they're there.

1733
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:28,540
They're trying to set up.
Wasn't,

1734
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:31,570
wasn't there a place that was doing a 
virtual reality in Utah?

1735
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:32,910
Wasn't like in Utah.
Oh,

1736
01:15:32,911 --> 01:15:34,290
you think it's Salt Lake City?
The Toy?

1737
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:35,743
Yeah,
they're setting up a whole like 

1738
01:15:37,121 --> 01:15:38,200
environment.
Yeah,

1739
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:39,810
they have one set up.
Yeah,

1740
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:40,683
it's great.
They did the ghostbusters thing at 

1741
01:15:41,861 --> 01:15:45,880
Madame tussauds wax museum in New York 
for the ghostbusters.

1742
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:47,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

1743
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:49,990
The future of virtual reality.
It's magazine.

1744
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:50,853
It's crazy.
Like you wear a backpack is a backpack 

1745
01:15:52,241 --> 01:15:53,074
computer,
so your wireless and then they have 

1746
01:15:54,311 --> 01:15:57,250
custom goggles that they fit on.
You look at this shit and,

1747
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,190
and all of this is mapped in an 
environment.

1748
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:02,400
So you're holding the guns,
you look down,

1749
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:04,780
you see the gun,
the gun moves when you move it.

1750
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:08,140
So these people are walking through 
sentencing environment.

1751
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:09,790
This is insane.
Yeah.

1752
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:12,130
So that's so,
so it's mapped.

1753
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:15,760
So this is what you're seeing in the 
rain and so certain things,

1754
01:16:15,761 --> 01:16:17,530
you know,
it depends on how one to one.

1755
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:20,860
Uh,
I hope that in the future with real time

1756
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:24,280
data capture,
with cloud capture,

1757
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:25,503
you'll be able to pick up objects,
like it'll actually be able to track of 

1758
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:31,960
teddy bear and you reach out and the 
teddy bears there.

1759
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:34,870
It's lined up well.
So you can naturalists grab it,

1760
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,850
you squeeze it.
And in real time,

1761
01:16:36,851 --> 01:16:37,740
the,
the,

1762
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:38,863
the system is reading it,
so it's actually puppeting all the 

1763
01:16:41,381 --> 01:16:43,600
objects in the room.
Um,

1764
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:45,940
so yeah,
and then the floor rumbles,

1765
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,120
their steam that comes out,
you know,

1766
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,860
kind of like a wide.
But you are the visual component year to

1767
01:16:51,861 --> 01:16:54,120
hijack.
So right now is just ghostbusters.

1768
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:56,230
Is that what it is?
Ghostbusters and the void?

1769
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:59,170
The void is,
I think it's public.

1770
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:00,790
Um,
I think you can go there.

1771
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,781
Um,
yeah.

1772
01:17:01,781 --> 01:17:02,614
So the void,
but there's a place that's opening up 

1773
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,090
hopefully in,
in Los Angeles,

1774
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:08,590
which is totally right for it.
[inaudible].

1775
01:17:08,591 --> 01:17:11,210
There's a huge community here that Santa
Monica.

1776
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:11,800
Yeah.
Really?

1777
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,441
Yeah.
Yeah.

1778
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:15,110
There's like a,
at least like five major players,

1779
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,680
um,
in like Santa Monica area,

1780
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,053
major players.
What do you mean by major player people 

1781
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:24,680
as humans are the time players like 
weaver?

1782
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:25,730
Um,
you know,

1783
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,690
they have stars.
Uh,

1784
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:29,690
they have,
they have titles that they're working on

1785
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,480
and they have,
they have experiences,

1786
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:33,373
you know,
what some people call simulations 

1787
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,400
experiences,
interactive experiences,

1788
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,130
um,
or just like puzzles or whatever.

1789
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:42,260
Like this.
People innovating for Vr.

1790
01:17:42,261 --> 01:17:43,094
So their company,
their production companies that make 

1791
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:47,150
videos,
they think in code,

1792
01:17:47,151 --> 01:17:48,830
they are,
they code,

1793
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:52,550
they create software or they're just 
really good at capturing.

1794
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:53,383
There's like,
you know,

1795
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,430
Adi,
which does like spherical capture,

1796
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,800
um,
or uh,

1797
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,330
or volumetric capture,
it's called.

1798
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,760
Yeah.
So there's a lot,

1799
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:01,653
a lot of people here,
so the technology is here and it's 

1800
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:05,684
always being innovative,
but warehouse scale is the perfect 

1801
01:18:08,031 --> 01:18:08,864
marriage for people,
especially in La who liked to be active 

1802
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:16,370
and might feel weird about sitting down 
in a chair and just staring at a screen,

1803
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:17,303
the controller in their hand,
but they can understand naturalistic 

1804
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:19,994
movement and you can in warehouse scale,
you can actually see the size of the 

1805
01:18:23,361 --> 01:18:24,194
room and feel the breadth of the space.
So in that particular video it seemed 

1806
01:18:29,541 --> 01:18:32,000
like they had chairs and tables and 
everything like that,

1807
01:18:32,001 --> 01:18:35,270
but the actual textures on those chip,
that was all added later.

1808
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:37,970
Yes.
All the objects were real.

1809
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,660
Yes.
But they look some of the projects,

1810
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:42,980
some of the objects,
like the major obstacles are there.

1811
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:43,843
Yeah.
The table share was crazy because they 

1812
01:18:45,591 --> 01:18:49,340
have a chair in the video game that was,
it seemed to me to be very different.

1813
01:18:49,341 --> 01:18:50,550
Like the bridge.
Totally.

1814
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:51,590
That's what I mean.
It's not,

1815
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:53,570
it's not one to one.
It's just like,

1816
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:57,410
it's just a basic representation,
but saying in the future you'll actually

1817
01:18:57,411 --> 01:19:01,550
be able to just have like a movie set 
and the system will be able to.

1818
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:06,640
We will already have a preloaded pre 
scanned sized version of that room,

1819
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:07,784
but then there'll be sensors that are 
real time calibrating it to make sure 

1820
01:19:10,071 --> 01:19:12,410
that it's rock solid.
So when you reach out you're like,

1821
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:13,603
oh,
I don't feel like I had to move my hand 

1822
01:19:14,361 --> 01:19:15,194
a little higher to grab this.
You can just reach out and it's right 

1823
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:18,710
there and it's a one for one 
representation.

1824
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:21,380
Do you think that the chair is very low 
to the ground?

1825
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:22,243
Wow.
Look at these people walking through 

1826
01:19:22,851 --> 01:19:24,080
there.
Whereas this,

1827
01:19:24,081 --> 01:19:25,700
if they're doing that,
uh,

1828
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:28,970
this was called Vr studio vr arcade.
This might've been a.

1829
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:31,270
yeah,
ferk iteration and yeah,

1830
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:34,610
this is fucking insane in the future,
man.

1831
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:37,040
It's going to be really,
really weird.

1832
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:39,140
I mean,
it's going to be so weird.

1833
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:40,093
I mean,
imagine like if the mapping becomes so 

1834
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:46,130
like rock solid that you could reliably 
run up a flight of stairs.

1835
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:48,170
Oh my God,
that's so crazy.

1836
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:52,080
I mean that sounds like sounds like a,
but it's like it's not.

1837
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:55,160
It's not.
And then once it comes becomes wireless.

1838
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:57,200
I mean remember when the only way to get
internet,

1839
01:19:57,890 --> 01:19:58,723
the only way to get to the Internet was 
to have an Ethernet cable connected to 

1840
01:20:00,741 --> 01:20:01,760
your device.
Right?

1841
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:04,130
That's silly.
I don't have anything to cable anywhere.

1842
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,510
No,
I know where to get one.

1843
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:05,880
The only.

1844
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:06,713
The only.
The only problem with Vr is that the 

1845
01:20:07,861 --> 01:20:10,740
processing power.
So for awhile it had to be tethered to a

1846
01:20:10,741 --> 01:20:13,140
PC.
Now they have pc backpacks.

1847
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:16,890
Well now I guarantee you what they're 
going to have is a like one of those,

1848
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:19,260
you know,
you get one of those five charge battery

1849
01:20:19,261 --> 01:20:20,094
packs for a phone where you can recharge
your totally going to get one of those 

1850
01:20:22,861 --> 01:20:23,694
bitches.
It's going to hook up to your phone and 

1851
01:20:25,221 --> 01:20:26,054
everything is going to take place.
All the processing is going to be on 

1852
01:20:27,481 --> 01:20:29,940
your phone,
you're going to have a bluetooth headset

1853
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:32,130
and you're going to be able to go out 
into a park and do this.

1854
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:34,890
It'll be like Bluetooth five,
15 point.

1855
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,510
Oh yeah.
Like you and your friends.

1856
01:20:36,511 --> 01:20:38,610
You'll just have to walk across the 
park.

1857
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:43,650
Like you remember when you first got an 
iphone and you had to do the fingerprint

1858
01:20:43,651 --> 01:20:44,484
a bunch of times.

1859
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:47,940
I can also do sorts of different ways 
the side of the front and the back.

1860
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,080
That's what you'll have to do.
You're like,

1861
01:20:49,081 --> 01:20:49,914
okay,
define your parameters are out in the 

1862
01:20:51,241 --> 01:20:54,780
park and everybody will walk to the park
together and criss cross.

1863
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:56,400
And then once the computer has enough 
data,

1864
01:20:56,401 --> 01:20:57,234
they go,
okay,

1865
01:20:57,390 --> 01:21:02,390
processing the game begins in 10,
and then your Avatar just transforms.

1866
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:05,400
Let's see.
That's the thing.

1867
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:06,330
It's like,
you know,

1868
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:07,141
uh,
you know,

1869
01:21:07,141 --> 01:21:07,974
you have augmented reality and virtual 
reality and augmented reality is 

1870
01:21:10,081 --> 01:21:13,420
interesting with Microsoft's Hololens 
uses this real time.

1871
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:16,200
I'm basically can see the environment 
around it,

1872
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:21,290
wrapping it so it stereoscopically maps 
it and it creates a really quick texture

1873
01:21:21,601 --> 01:21:26,601
map of the environment that you're in.
So imagine that mixed with like the idea

1874
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:30,150
behind the,
I forget the name of the project,

1875
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:32,520
but it was a early Microsoft project 
where it took,

1876
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:37,080
it's basically scraped all relevant 
types of photos and stitch them together

1877
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:37,914
and created a virtual three d 
environments of locations based on 

1878
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:45,000
photographs that are everywhere on the 
Internet so it could recreate a plaza in

1879
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:45,834
Italy.

1880
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:46,803
Um,
and then using like kind of 

1881
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:48,774
interpolation,
like the AI software kind of stitching 

1882
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:51,391
it together,
blah,

1883
01:21:51,391 --> 01:21:52,224
blah blah.
So imagine that existing already just 

1884
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:56,790
because people are passing by with their
phones.

1885
01:21:56,791 --> 01:21:58,540
They're taking pictures or taking 
videos.

1886
01:21:58,541 --> 01:21:59,374
So all of that data is now president 
according to the location that you're 

1887
01:22:02,161 --> 01:22:02,994
at,
mixed with headsets that are able to 

1888
01:22:04,471 --> 01:22:09,240
scan in real time collectively that also
gets processed and stitch together,

1889
01:22:09,241 --> 01:22:14,100
cross together so that instantaneously 
you can have a mapped almost one for one

1890
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:17,430
game zone and a giant park.
Like pretty quick.

1891
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,353
And just like how you described it.
But like using things that are in the 

1892
01:22:21,871 --> 01:22:22,704
headset that are tracking in real time 
and then transmitting it or at that are 

1893
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:26,783
completely internal to the headset and 
then also networked intelligence to 

1894
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:29,994
simultaneously.
And then also probably some fake stuff 

1895
01:22:32,611 --> 01:22:34,560
that they can create visually.

1896
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:38,440
And with three d sound totally see like,
you know,

1897
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:41,200
if you're doing an Avatar game,
you see the dragons flying overhead,

1898
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:44,040
you're like,
well that's the Hololens does that.

1899
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:47,010
It's got these two little slits.
They're not even like regular speakers.

1900
01:22:47,011 --> 01:22:49,400
Their slips that are above your ears 
that are pointed down.

1901
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:51,420
It's like a almost like hypersonic 
sound,

1902
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,081
you know,
like sound.

1903
01:22:52,081 --> 01:22:52,914
That can be basically paper thin.
So if I move the access you can't hear 

1904
01:22:55,951 --> 01:22:58,170
it.
And then if I move it back on access and

1905
01:22:58,171 --> 01:22:59,004
you haven't moved your head,
you'll hear it specifically in one tiny 

1906
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:06,490
slice of audio.
And so it has to be very precise.

1907
01:23:06,491 --> 01:23:07,324
So it's a form of that,
but they're just pointing down and they 

1908
01:23:09,371 --> 01:23:10,204
can simulate dolby five point one by 
normally just saying think about house 

1909
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,280
crazy.
Like your,

1910
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:18,340
your,
your earplugs are right.

1911
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,313
Yeah.
Like look at this little tiny ass 

1912
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:20,690
speaker.

1913
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:21,523
Yup.
There's little tiny ass speaker when 

1914
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:25,870
it's in your ear.
I mean you can get too loud.

1915
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:27,303
Like if I listened to.
If I listen to music sometimes it can 

1916
01:23:29,591 --> 01:23:30,424
get too loud with these.
Then I got to get you better had 

1917
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:33,220
headphones.
These are great.

1918
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,210
They're,
they're good.

1919
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:35,103
What's wrong with them?
They're the ones that come with the 

1920
01:23:36,841 --> 01:23:37,860
iphone.
Yeah.

1921
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:38,890
They're,
they're okay.

1922
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:41,410
They just,
they have a lot of high end which is not

1923
01:23:41,411 --> 01:23:42,760
good for your hearing.
Oh,

1924
01:23:42,761 --> 01:23:45,370
not good for your hair.
I like things that are soft on my ears,

1925
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:47,680
but I can hear clearly.
It's about what?

1926
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,600
Precision.
What does this fuck this?

1927
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:51,200
Fuck your ears up.
I would say like.

1928
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:52,303
Sure.
Really?

1929
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:55,370
It depends on what you're using for the 
ear pods.

1930
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,760
[inaudible] actually sounded really 
fucking great.

1931
01:23:57,890 --> 01:23:59,590
Yeah.
So I like the ear pods are better.

1932
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,380
I like them better than the headphones 
that come standard.

1933
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,420
Anytime headphones are included,
they're like,

1934
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:05,500
they're,
they're okay,

1935
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,393
but they're not great.
I mean on an apple standard better than 

1936
01:24:09,221 --> 01:24:10,670
most.
But uh,

1937
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:14,350
the earpods or more precise,
the earpods just sound natural.

1938
01:24:14,351 --> 01:24:18,490
They'd sound like I'm really surprised 
I'm prepared for them not to sound good.

1939
01:24:18,491 --> 01:24:19,324
Almost every time they use them,
but they sound great because they're 

1940
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:23,920
not.
They don't seal the ear,

1941
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:27,370
they sit in the ear,
but the design is so ingenious that even

1942
01:24:27,371 --> 01:24:30,430
when I'm working out I'm like,
I'm like on the bench,

1943
01:24:30,431 --> 01:24:31,960
getting up,
jumping around.

1944
01:24:31,961 --> 01:24:34,720
They're still not falling out and they 
sound great.

1945
01:24:34,721 --> 01:24:37,180
The bass sounds all natural and then 
I'll put it in like a high end pair.

1946
01:24:37,181 --> 01:24:38,014
I have like a crazy amount of headphones
and I'll put in some like crazy 

1947
01:24:42,011 --> 01:24:43,570
headphones,
like some odd days,

1948
01:24:43,571 --> 01:24:48,280
whatever plan or magnetic blah bullshits
like little tiny ones that don't require

1949
01:24:48,281 --> 01:24:51,940
much power of phone would power it fine,
but I put those in and I'm like,

1950
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,430
Oh wow,
that sounds really small.

1951
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:57,670
Like I have to adjust to its detail.
Whereas the IPODS,

1952
01:24:57,671 --> 01:24:58,960
like as soon as I put them in like,
oh,

1953
01:24:58,961 --> 01:24:59,794
that's just.
Sounds like a nice perfect frequency 

1954
01:25:01,211 --> 01:25:03,220
curve.
Feels very flat in real.

1955
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:05,200
Wow.
That's a strong endorsement.

1956
01:25:05,410 --> 01:25:06,280
Pretty good.
Yeah.

1957
01:25:06,281 --> 01:25:07,240
I'm,
I'm really.

1958
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,700
I'm really.
I was very impressed with them.

1959
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:11,500
I bought them and I never opened the 
box.

1960
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:12,573
Really?
They're easy to pair man and it's cool 

1961
01:25:15,071 --> 01:25:16,630
because I just had them in my jeans all 
the time.

1962
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:17,480
Oh,
right.

1963
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,190
A little easier to handle in this wire.
That wire gets fucked up.

1964
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:21,930
Yeah.
He just like,

1965
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:26,050
I just pulled it out and it's so fun 
because the way it snaps closed and open

1966
01:25:26,051 --> 01:25:27,430
magnetically.
So satisfying.

1967
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:29,410
How long is the battery?
Life lasts a little suckers.

1968
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:32,410
I think it's eight hours real,
I think with the case.

1969
01:25:32,411 --> 01:25:36,360
The charge case recharges right there.
Whether their parents,

1970
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:37,203
the Apple Watch.

1971
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,970
I have the new Apple Watch.
Did you get the three l,

1972
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:44,650
t e l series three.
And what's the deal with the three?

1973
01:25:44,651 --> 01:25:45,550
What's,
what's better?

1974
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:47,800
Lte now you can leave your phone at 
home.

1975
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:48,770
Yeah,
just take your watch.

1976
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:49,633
Yeah.
Comfortable enough with your life to do 

1977
01:25:50,831 --> 01:25:51,664
that.
I mean if I'm going to a concert or 

1978
01:25:53,831 --> 01:25:55,090
something like that,
like you know,

1979
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:57,250
I mean I,
you know,

1980
01:25:57,251 --> 01:26:00,730
I think what's great about this and when
I saw people talking about like,

1981
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,150
what do you think about the Apple Watch 
when they first announced it,

1982
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:05,630
there was so many people that are like,
it's so stupid.

1983
01:26:05,631 --> 01:26:07,810
You already have a phone.
Why do you need a,

1984
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:09,710
you know,
why does your watch needs to be a phone?

1985
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,200
And they're saying all these things 
related to that.

1986
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:12,861
And I'm like,
guys,

1987
01:26:12,861 --> 01:26:13,694
you don't get it.
It's about having to not manage a 

1988
01:26:17,301 --> 01:26:18,410
physical object.

1989
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:23,090
It's the watch is on your wrist.
It just stays on your wrist the whole,

1990
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:23,973
the whole day.
I mean unless you take it off or 

1991
01:26:24,831 --> 01:26:25,664
whatever,
but most of the time you just leave it 

1992
01:26:26,511 --> 01:26:29,030
on the whole day.
And it's always there.

1993
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,940
You don't have to manage it.
Like if you want to make a call,

1994
01:26:31,941 --> 01:26:33,410
you make a call.
If you want to take call,

1995
01:26:33,411 --> 01:26:34,490
you know you have your,
your pods,

1996
01:26:34,491 --> 01:26:37,880
you can do a phone call,
you can listen to your music on it.

1997
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:40,470
How much power battery wise is that 
thing have?

1998
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,980
I think on Lte,
what is it?

1999
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:44,720
Like six,
five hours,

2000
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,360
something like that.
What do you live in a half a day.

2001
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,560
You get it.
So that thing works better.

2002
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:53,480
Yeah,
that's like all lte bit.

2003
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:56,450
But realistically you're not going to be
on lte all the time,

2004
01:26:56,451 --> 01:26:59,420
so depending on your usage it,
it'll,

2005
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:00,320
I think it'll last.

2006
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:04,010
I mean is that five hours of talking?
I think of yet lte,

2007
01:27:04,011 --> 01:27:08,590
like talking or something like that.
But I think for me I'm like around 67,

2008
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:12,020
74 percent every day.
Really at the end of every day.

2009
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:14,420
So I can go a couple days without 
charging it actually.

2010
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,260
Ooh,
boom.

2011
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:17,350
Move though.
I know I liked it.

2012
01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:19,100
I like it.
Feel like a rebel,

2013
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:19,963
like pushing it man.
I'm no wireless pads are going to be 

2014
01:27:22,341 --> 01:27:23,174
everywhere soon enough.
We're using it on my phone or the watch 

2015
01:27:26,721 --> 01:27:27,554
rather.
I just got the eight plus and just set 

2016
01:27:29,841 --> 01:27:31,700
it right on there.
So you're going to get the 10 as well.

2017
01:27:31,701 --> 01:27:33,640
Are you a hedonist?
Crazy person.

2018
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,513
I have like,
I have like almost every top phone 

2019
01:27:37,011 --> 01:27:38,630
because I want to know android because I
haven't,

2020
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,790
I have a t mobile account and a t and t 
account.

2021
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,550
So you want to learn android so you're 
fucking around with it.

2022
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:45,680
So I'm always updating.
I just want to know how the,

2023
01:27:45,850 --> 01:27:47,870
like what,
what's the Ui philosophy like?

2024
01:27:47,871 --> 01:27:50,230
What do they think is interesting 
because they're too,

2025
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:52,450
they're too divergent,
but they're very similar.

2026
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:54,470
I like to check out like,
oh,

2027
01:27:54,471 --> 01:27:55,310
what's the difference?
Um,

2028
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:57,590
that's really frustrating that I fund 
doesn't do that.

2029
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,570
That's frustrating that this doesn't do 
that,

2030
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:00,550
you know?
Um,

2031
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:04,580
if it wasn't for airdrop airdrops kind 
of keeping me on board,

2032
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:08,360
like I realized how much I liked that 
once I tried the Google Pixel,

2033
01:28:08,361 --> 01:28:09,440
which I really liked.
Yeah,

2034
01:28:09,441 --> 01:28:10,274
that's a great fun,
great phone and the Pixel two supposed 

2035
01:28:12,331 --> 01:28:13,320
to be even better.
But yeah,

2036
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:16,820
the Samsung Galaxy note eight might be 
the best phone in the world.

2037
01:28:16,821 --> 01:28:17,511
They say,
yeah,

2038
01:28:17,511 --> 01:28:22,460
I have the eight of the eight plus it's 
very beautiful note plus as a.

2039
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,291
no,
no,

2040
01:28:23,291 --> 01:28:24,190
I'm not going to.
Yeah,

2041
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:25,760
galaxy eight plus.
Yeah.

2042
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:30,940
But the note is a similar same thing,
but it's got the obviously the style and

2043
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:35,240
there's a couple other features.
I think the cameras the same,

2044
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:38,000
but it's just got a couple extra 
features.

2045
01:28:38,001 --> 01:28:40,850
So I just stick with the smaller.
What do you think about it?

2046
01:28:40,851 --> 01:28:42,120
Plus the eight plus.
Yeah,

2047
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:43,940
I love it.
The screen is gorgeous.

2048
01:28:43,941 --> 01:28:44,480
Amazing,
right?

2049
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,010
It is.
So it's.

2050
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:48,930
The colors are just insane.
It's really beautiful.

2051
01:28:48,931 --> 01:28:51,050
And once you have no bevel,
yeah.

2052
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:52,530
You look at it.
Yeah.

2053
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,990
Is it basil?
Basil.

2054
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:54,853
Why don't say bevel?
You might've said something you grew 

2055
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,310
because it's soft enough of a v.
I was like,

2056
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:01,410
he said Bezel,
but it just sounded weird through.

2057
01:29:01,411 --> 01:29:02,160
I call myself

2058
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,540
out on it.
That's a good job man.

2059
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,050
But that he did so much more beautiful 
than seeing that edge.

2060
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:07,884
That edge is like the obvious edge of 
the bottom of the iphone where your 

2061
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:10,644
fingerprint scanner goes and the top of 
the iphone where the speaker is the 

2062
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:14,580
chin.
It looks clunky.

2063
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:17,070
Yeah.
It's totally clunky and it's,

2064
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:17,650
you know,
it's,

2065
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:18,483
it's weird.
It's the next step before a augmented 

2066
01:29:21,751 --> 01:29:25,380
reality glasses so that your phones or 
your phone or your glasses.

2067
01:29:25,381 --> 01:29:27,960
When I look at the note,
eight red band as the note eight,

2068
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,390
it looks like minority report.
I'm looking at this.

2069
01:29:30,391 --> 01:29:31,100
I'm like,
wow.

2070
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,890
Like that was a whole.
That's a whole screen.

2071
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,260
Yeah.
You're holding the screen.

2072
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:36,480
It's all screen.
This is the future.

2073
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:37,820
It's pretty Rad.
Yeah.

2074
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:42,630
It legitimately feels to me like a big 
step up from like a regular phone.

2075
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:43,590
I look at that and I'm like,
okay,

2076
01:29:43,591 --> 01:29:43,910
that's.

2077
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:46,170
This is obviously next level.
Yeah.

2078
01:29:46,171 --> 01:29:47,004
I got the essential phone too.
Just to see what that display was like 

2079
01:29:49,561 --> 01:29:51,630
to kind of get a preview for the iphone 
10.

2080
01:29:51,830 --> 01:29:54,350
Iphone 10 is going to be insane.
It's going to blow it all.

2081
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:56,600
It looks.
It looks great.

2082
01:29:56,601 --> 01:29:58,730
I mean I will say that their product 
design has been like,

2083
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:00,180
there was a period where I'm like,
Eh,

2084
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:01,403
like what?
Just kind of like their last few 

2085
01:30:02,911 --> 01:30:04,240
iterations of computer.
I mean,

2086
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:05,093
I always get the new,
I get the new everything from apple 

2087
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:07,343
pretty much and then just either sell or
like find like someone who needs a 

2088
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:12,480
computer or whatever,
just give it to them.

2089
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,240
But uh,
so I cycled through a lot of technology.

2090
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:19,050
Um,
and just for awhile they know the,

2091
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:20,610
the laptops were,
they were cool,

2092
01:30:20,611 --> 01:30:22,680
they were like some nice improvements.
I mean I like the,

2093
01:30:22,681 --> 01:30:25,230
you know,
the macbook pro design is pretty cool.

2094
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:27,360
I like the Strip.
I thought it was going to be a gimmick.

2095
01:30:27,361 --> 01:30:30,690
The strip becomes an issue with me 
because I have fat fingers and sometimes

2096
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:32,670
I hit.
Oh yeah,

2097
01:30:32,671 --> 01:30:35,260
I just stopped.
So I just stable secrets for,

2098
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:36,510
for the,
for the laptop now.

2099
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:37,344
But I did too,
but we didn't matter when you hit the 

2100
01:30:38,731 --> 01:30:43,731
button and release a series.
I know what I'm talking about.

2101
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:48,110
That's me.
But it's also,

2102
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:49,950
it's,
it's right there.

2103
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:52,080
It's right there where the fucking 
delete key.

2104
01:30:52,081 --> 01:30:54,980
His finger slips and goes up there.
Yes.

2105
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:56,670
It falls in there.
Boom.

2106
01:30:56,671 --> 01:31:00,820
Would you like to enable Siri know you 
bench seats cancel?

2107
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,550
Nope.
Just just learn.

2108
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:03,443
You know what I mean,
just I didn't want me to technology to 

2109
01:31:04,741 --> 01:31:06,720
learn better.
It's not learning very well.

2110
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:08,003
The thing about being able to switch 
windows on the bar is kind of 

2111
01:31:10,081 --> 01:31:10,914
interesting,
but quite honestly I never used it 

2112
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:12,480
either.

2113
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:13,313
Never used it.
I would prefer mechanical buttons for 

2114
01:31:14,941 --> 01:31:17,040
sound too.
I agree with that.

2115
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,220
I it's way faster,
way faster.

2116
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:21,263
You have to press it once and then you 
have to press it again and then just 

2117
01:31:23,521 --> 01:31:25,120
said just the sound.
Why don't have it?

2118
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:25,973
Just a process of mine is like normal.
I know there's probably a keyboard 

2119
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:31,290
combine you can use.
I think it's our command,

2120
01:31:31,291 --> 01:31:32,124
apple or plus.
The only other complaint that I would 

2121
01:31:33,841 --> 01:31:34,674
have is I really like a tactile 
mechanical feeling keyboard when I 

2122
01:31:38,611 --> 01:31:39,340
write,
oh,

2123
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:41,700
particular bigger keyboard,
a bigger key.

2124
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:43,980
A throw traveling like this one because 
it's.

2125
01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:45,043
I liked this new Mac book pro better 
than the last Mac book pro because the 

2126
01:31:48,051 --> 01:31:51,590
last one was kind of mushy a little bit 
and this one is more like it.

2127
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:56,190
It seems like real positive feedback 
when it clicks and what I really like is

2128
01:31:56,191 --> 01:32:00,610
the Lenovo thinkpads,
they amazing keyboard

2129
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:03,910
that works like you feel where the keys 
are.

2130
01:32:03,911 --> 01:32:07,520
It's like I type faster with it.
It just feels like more surgery.

2131
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:08,793
Yeah.
My fingers just can communicate with it 

2132
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:10,781
better.
Yeah.

2133
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:13,530
These are like flat,
like flat rectangle.

2134
01:32:13,531 --> 01:32:15,230
They're not very high off the ground 
either,

2135
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:18,370
so because of the fact they're not very 
high off of the rest of the keyboard.

2136
01:32:18,371 --> 01:32:19,204
You're not sure what you're touching 
sometimes socially if you have calluses 

2137
01:32:22,031 --> 01:32:23,910
I guess.
And fingers.

2138
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:24,833
Yeah,
so you have to just understand the 

2139
01:32:26,321 --> 01:32:27,154
spacing of it,
but it's almost like they're preparing 

2140
01:32:29,111 --> 01:32:33,570
you for typing on a glass screen the 
same way you type on your iphone and and

2141
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:34,900
see.
I'm not a big fan of that.

2142
01:32:34,901 --> 01:32:38,250
I think we should be able to speak to 
our computers and they go,

2143
01:32:38,251 --> 01:32:39,400
Ooh,
you can just get a keyboard.

2144
01:32:39,401 --> 01:32:40,600
Do you touch to,
okay,

2145
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:41,980
I don't want that.

2146
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:43,253
I wanted this.
This is the whole thing for a laptop in 

2147
01:32:44,861 --> 01:32:47,260
the first place.
Totally sent me a screen and a keyboard.

2148
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:48,123
Yeah,
totally.

2149
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,190
Fuck you.
Do I though,

2150
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,393
do you,
do you have an echo or any of those 

2151
01:32:51,521 --> 01:32:52,181
things?
Yeah,

2152
01:32:52,181 --> 01:32:54,190
I got an echo of never set it up,
don't use it,

2153
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:55,960
so gave it to me as a gift.
I get it,

2154
01:32:56,020 --> 01:33:00,610
but just sitting there and I go,
I totally get that.

2155
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:04,360
But I will say I use it for my lights in
my house is really nice.

2156
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,393
Um,
so as I'm going to bed I'll just fit 

2157
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:09,190
like computer turn lights off.
Can you,

2158
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:12,640
can you change the way you talk to it?
Can you say shut the lights off bitch?

2159
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:13,600
No,
I wish.

2160
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:15,100
See it needs to do that.
Yeah,

2161
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:17,050
I need to be able to do that,
but it's going to get there.

2162
01:33:17,051 --> 01:33:18,400
Don't worry.
It's coming.

2163
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:20,460
These lights and then you can set it up.
Know.

2164
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:21,363
But I'm just saying like you can speak 
to it super fast so I can say like I'm 

2165
01:33:24,341 --> 01:33:25,930
in the living room and I want the lights
off.

2166
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:30,100
I'll just say computer a computer,
turn the living room lights off and just

2167
01:33:30,101 --> 01:33:33,130
walk away and he gets it.
It's like immediately on,

2168
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:34,130
it's like,
it,

2169
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:35,770
it hears that,
that prompt.

2170
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:36,963
It's on,
I'm saying the sentence 

2171
01:33:37,991 --> 01:33:39,400
naturalistically.
I'm not saying,

2172
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:40,690
Hey,
Siri.

2173
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:41,523
Yeah.

2174
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:47,340
How many times have I gone to the 
bathroom today?

2175
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,073
Did it?

2176
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:52,280
You've got.
I'm sorry.

2177
01:33:52,281 --> 01:33:55,790
I don't know the answer to that.
Whatever that long.

2178
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:58,120
It's that long.
Why would I buy the I?

2179
01:33:58,130 --> 01:33:58,963
There's just no.
There's no reason for me to use 

2180
01:34:00,111 --> 01:34:03,020
something that takes that fucking long 
to process.

2181
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:07,670
It's faster to do voice dictation in,
in a google APP,

2182
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,020
right?
That you're gonna get.

2183
01:34:09,021 --> 01:34:10,190
So it's.
But that's a combo.

2184
01:34:10,191 --> 01:34:13,190
It's like the voice did better in the 
Google apps.

2185
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:15,170
Is it better?
It is better.

2186
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:16,173
It said their algorithms are better,
like the artificial intelligence is a 

2187
01:34:18,701 --> 01:34:20,630
little bit better note keeping and stuff
as well.

2188
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,100
Yeah,
I mean there's.

2189
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:26,300
You can do a little bit more with Google
assistant than you can with Siri also.

2190
01:34:26,301 --> 01:34:27,620
I liked the name.
I don't.

2191
01:34:27,621 --> 01:34:32,060
I hate it when they name on ais thing 
like Cortana for Microsoft.

2192
01:34:32,061 --> 01:34:33,470
I'm like,
I don't fucking,

2193
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:36,650
I don't want to like get it.

2194
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:38,270
I like Cortana.
She's great.

2195
01:34:38,271 --> 01:34:39,710
I love Halo.
However,

2196
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:43,250
I don't need a personality.
I want it to be a computer and I want to

2197
01:34:43,251 --> 01:34:45,770
just do what I'd like it to do.
I don't need to hear like,

2198
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:47,270
okay,
you know,

2199
01:34:47,271 --> 01:34:48,104
the sunlight today is really beautiful,
but I'd watch that wear some sunscreen 

2200
01:34:50,961 --> 01:34:52,850
unless I wanted that.
I want that option.

2201
01:34:52,851 --> 01:34:53,684
But I also want it to be neutral.
So over time I want ai to learn what I 

2202
01:34:59,151 --> 01:35:01,850
dig and just kind of do that.
Yeah,

2203
01:35:01,851 --> 01:35:02,684
there should be an option for whether or
not you want it to behave like a corny 

2204
01:35:04,881 --> 01:35:05,714
human.
Yes,

2205
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:07,850
I know some people.
I mean I get it.

2206
01:35:07,851 --> 01:35:08,684
You want something like that?
You want like a little friend or 

2207
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:10,454
something?
I get it.

2208
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:11,810
I do that.
I do.

2209
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,640
I'd have like a couple of different 
versions of it,

2210
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:14,960
you know,
if,

2211
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:15,973
if I'm in work mode,
I changed it to like computer voice if 

2212
01:35:18,591 --> 01:35:19,424
I'm just chilling,
having a good time with friends and 

2213
01:35:20,861 --> 01:35:23,120
changed it to hey party person voice.

2214
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:24,531
Hey.
All right.

2215
01:35:24,531 --> 01:35:25,910
That sounds like a great idea.
Hey,

2216
01:35:25,911 --> 01:35:26,930
play some miles.
Davis.

2217
01:35:26,931 --> 01:35:29,460
You know what I was just thinking too,
that name.

2218
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:33,860
It sounds like a great choice.
That's really as man what as you get.

2219
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,140
Yeah.
Like man,

2220
01:35:35,141 --> 01:35:37,520
if you get like John Lee Hooker's voice.
Yeah,

2221
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:39,320
that'd be great.
Talk to John Lee Hooker.

2222
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:41,480
Everywhere you go,
you get like a.

2223
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:42,343
You get linguists and language experts 
and mimics to like all sit down and 

2224
01:35:46,671 --> 01:35:50,840
create a program so they can.
It can actually do impersonations off of

2225
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:53,810
like inputting it on audio so it could 
actually become that person.

2226
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:54,830
Look with Jamie just pulled up

2227
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,280
library.
Liar.

2228
01:35:57,281 --> 01:36:00,340
Bird firebird allows you to create a 
digital voice.

2229
01:36:00,341 --> 01:36:02,780
That sounds like you.
One minute.

2230
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:04,930
That's awesome.
That's insane.

2231
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:10,080
Photoshop for voice thing essentially 
that are available for you can make your

2232
01:36:10,451 --> 01:36:11,280
own.
Just got to read.

2233
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,630
I love it.
It's very good.

2234
01:36:13,650 --> 01:36:15,670
Is it?
Feel like fuck with it though.

2235
01:36:15,671 --> 01:36:20,200
That's what I want to.
If you have 40 minutes of your audio,

2236
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:21,880
they.
They basically have you

2237
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:25,060
demo stuff I think.
Does Donald Trump's voice here?

2238
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:25,750
Okay.
Here we go.

2239
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:26,730
Oh my God,
no way.

2240
01:36:27,310 --> 01:36:27,940
Love Him.

2241
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:30,900
H is considering in addition to other 
options,

2242
01:36:30,901 --> 01:36:34,020
stopping all trade with any country 
doing business with North Korea.

2243
01:36:34,690 --> 01:36:36,180
That's.
That's fine.

2244
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:37,690
You know,
do you know,

2245
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,780
you know that it's him.
You can tell it's synthesized,

2246
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:42,600
but you know that attempt.
It sounds amazing though.

2247
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:43,753
It's pretty great

2248
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,033
meeting General Kelly,
General Maddis and other military 

2249
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:50,540
leaders at the White House to discuss 
North Korea,

2250
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:53,320
but the middle section was nice.
The front of the

2251
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:54,560
backward not very good.
Well,

2252
01:36:54,561 --> 01:36:57,350
I wonder if they're adding that 
reverberation.

2253
01:36:57,351 --> 01:36:59,990
That weird.
If it thinks that's part of the audio,

2254
01:36:59,991 --> 01:37:00,824
like the quality of the water from 
they're doing that on purpose because 

2255
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:03,823
you're talking about the president,
like can you do an audio version of the 

2256
01:37:06,471 --> 01:37:07,304
president and pretend like that.
Like you might get in real trouble 

2257
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:10,363
because that audio could be used.
Like if he never actually said that 

2258
01:37:12,231 --> 01:37:14,240
about not doing business with North 
Korea.

2259
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:16,640
If they didn't make an obviously fake 
version.

2260
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:18,230
It's pretty.
It's pretty fun.

2261
01:37:18,231 --> 01:37:19,340
Another language,
another person.

2262
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:20,850
It's pretty terrible.
I'm gonna.

2263
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:22,030
Run to the restroom real quick.
Oh,

2264
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:25,340
go ahead.
Go play me some Broccoli.

2265
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:28,850
I think they're taking tweets and 
putting that through it.

2266
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:29,713
Oh,
okay.

2267
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:31,083
Let's hear it.

2268
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:34,660
Thank you to all the first responders 
and people helping each other out.

2269
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:37,000
It sounds terrible.
We do as Americans,

2270
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:40,160
why is it sounds so terrible to on this.
You're a.

2271
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,920
The way they have it set up like if you 
and me did it today,

2272
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:43,993
they have specific sentences that we 
would need to read to hit the syllables 

2273
01:37:46,491 --> 01:37:49,760
and I think they're taking speeches and 
they probably tried to find the words as

2274
01:37:49,761 --> 01:37:50,594
opposed to going directly into their 
computer program which was built for 

2275
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:54,583
the.
The only issue though is it doesn't 

2276
01:37:55,261 --> 01:37:57,630
sound good.
Those don't because they didn't actually

2277
01:37:57,631 --> 01:38:00,820
have Obama reading specifically for them
into their car.

2278
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:03,540
They just took speeches probably and 
found the words that matter,

2279
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:04,493
but even if they took speeches,
it sounds so much shittier than the 

2280
01:38:06,421 --> 01:38:07,254
actual speech itself.
I'm just going to close my friend who 

2281
01:38:09,961 --> 01:38:11,910
showed it to him.
He said he did it himself and got really

2282
01:38:11,911 --> 01:38:14,190
surprised that he just typed a sentence 
then and was like,

2283
01:38:14,191 --> 01:38:16,050
holy shit,
that sounds like me.

2284
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:20,100
They're going to be able to have people 
saying all kinds of crazy things.

2285
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:20,963
This is a.
This is not the Adobe Photoshop when 

2286
01:38:22,861 --> 01:38:25,860
this is I think a small company,
so they're probably going to.

2287
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:29,740
Adobe's got a better make people have 
feuds with people by saying a little.

2288
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:30,653
You hear what you said about your man.
She was with this pretty fucked up and 

2289
01:38:32,761 --> 01:38:33,271
they're like,
what?

2290
01:38:33,271 --> 01:38:34,104
We'll fuck him and then that guy says 
fuck him and so some crazy shit about 

2291
01:38:36,691 --> 01:38:38,940
him and the next thing you know the 
reality,

2292
01:38:38,941 --> 01:38:39,774
a TV show editing trick rich just said 
off camera and you show somebody as 

2293
01:38:42,451 --> 01:38:45,180
reaction to what they heard and can send
that to your friend and be like,

2294
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:46,440
look,
they're fucking pissed at you.

2295
01:38:46,441 --> 01:38:51,210
And then just really easily.
That could be an APP on your phone.

2296
01:38:51,211 --> 01:38:54,450
Just like that app where you put a puppy
dog nose on it.

2297
01:38:55,110 --> 01:38:58,860
How's it any different.
As soon as someone gives the green light

2298
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:02,270
to put that on the apple store,
the Google play store,

2299
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:03,203
someone's going to figure out a way to 
to use that to make weird copies of 

2300
01:39:06,421 --> 01:39:08,140
people do have ethics.
So,

2301
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:09,721
oh,
there's ethics.

2302
01:39:09,721 --> 01:39:11,730
Get the fuck out of here with your 
ethics.

2303
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:16,110
Shut up once you pee in the pool,
you're not extracting that stuff out and

2304
01:39:16,111 --> 01:39:18,150
stop,
or at least they have samples.

2305
01:39:18,151 --> 01:39:20,870
They released a public awareness.
Yeah.

2306
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:22,770
First,
to raise public awareness,

2307
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:23,604
to make people realize that technology 
exists by releasing audio samples from 

2308
01:39:26,071 --> 01:39:28,500
the digital voices of Donald Trump and 
Barack Obama.

2309
01:39:28,710 --> 01:39:29,543
Second,
we want to ensure that your digital 

2310
01:39:30,391 --> 01:39:33,630
voice is yours.
We are the stewards of your voice,

2311
01:39:33,631 --> 01:39:34,464
but you control its usage.
No one can use it without your explicit 

2312
01:39:37,231 --> 01:39:37,940
consent.

2313
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:41,450
Shut your whole shy or whole.
That's like saying,

2314
01:39:41,451 --> 01:39:43,970
I can hold my breath forever.
Shut up.

2315
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:46,370
No,
you can't.

2316
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:47,503
You can't control that.
They have some wonky as website where 

2317
01:39:49,641 --> 01:39:50,474
they're trying to pretend like they can 
control the digital voice that gets 

2318
01:39:53,271 --> 01:39:56,660
printed using their app like the fuck 
you can this,

2319
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:57,613
this.
Once you've made some technology like 

2320
01:39:59,151 --> 01:40:01,970
this is all your silly words that you're
writing down,

2321
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:05,510
that doesn't mean anything.
You're what are you going to violate?

2322
01:40:05,511 --> 01:40:06,344
All the laws,
the known laws of technological 

2323
01:40:08,091 --> 01:40:11,210
progression with your disclaimer and 
release.

2324
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,640
That's not.
Yeah.

2325
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:15,340
It's not really possible because they 
can.

2326
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,500
They can tell through an analysis that 
means,

2327
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:18,403
I mean that's.
That sounds like you were in that part 

2328
01:40:20,451 --> 01:40:21,780
of the synthesis.
That's like,

2329
01:40:21,830 --> 01:40:24,410
that's the computer.
That's the best it can do right now.

2330
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:25,273
For now,
for sure it's going to get better and 

2331
01:40:27,471 --> 01:40:28,910
for sure they're not going to be able to
control it.

2332
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:32,180
Like once it's gotten to that stage,
it's that crazy.

2333
01:40:32,570 --> 01:40:33,403
I just think it's a matter of time 
before we have no idea what the fuck is 

2334
01:40:35,991 --> 01:40:39,530
real and it's not at that point.
Why not just hire an Obama impersonator?

2335
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:40,513
Well,
not as good because it Obama 

2336
01:40:41,781 --> 01:40:42,614
impersonator.
Even the best Obama impersonators just 

2337
01:40:44,361 --> 01:40:45,860
affects similarly.
You know,

2338
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,220
there's such a.
So you're saying that the.

2339
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,180
But the computer has to.
I mean,

2340
01:40:50,181 --> 01:40:52,550
unless it's just audio being played 
back,

2341
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:56,590
it's like simulating it.
Oh you mean like a physical video?

2342
01:40:56,591 --> 01:40:58,280
That'll be easy.
They'll definitely video.

2343
01:40:58,360 --> 01:40:59,193
They've already done it with video.
What do you want me screaming over 

2344
01:41:02,171 --> 01:41:02,520
there?

2345
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:03,353
Bottom of the site,
they had this little disclaimer 

2346
01:41:04,951 --> 01:41:05,784
agreement regarding biometrics.
I collect it and right here it's how we 

2347
01:41:07,981 --> 01:41:08,814
disclose biometric data.
We may also disclose biometric data in 

2348
01:41:11,341 --> 01:41:13,970
the following circumstances,
law enforcement agencies,

2349
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:15,420
putting a warrant and Cetera,
et Cetera,

2350
01:41:15,421 --> 01:41:16,060
et cetera.

2351
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:17,290
Wow.
Oh Wow.

2352
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:18,610
So you basically.
It's.

2353
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:23,760
This is all CIA psyops man.
The fucking same people keeping the man.

2354
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:31,270
He let your neck keeping the man the 
play with the fucking APP map first.

2355
01:41:31,481 --> 01:41:33,310
They got their fingerprints,
man,

2356
01:41:33,490 --> 01:41:37,330
your fingerprints off your phone data,
fast data.

2357
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:39,880
They're collecting DNA from your 
screens.

2358
01:41:39,881 --> 01:41:43,990
When you turn your phone and data is 
being stored on a third party server,

2359
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:45,460
which I mean,
it says it right.

2360
01:41:45,490 --> 01:41:46,330
Oh,
we're fucked.

2361
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:49,090
All that data's going to get scooped up 
by the Russians.

2362
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:51,610
The Russians are going to have all these
people talk and shit.

2363
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:53,373
They're gonna have.
They're going to have heads of industry 

2364
01:41:54,641 --> 01:41:56,710
talking shit about Donald Trump,
threatening to kill him.

2365
01:41:56,890 --> 01:41:59,410
Donald trump's going to get crazy 
paranoid because he doesn't read.

2366
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:00,633
And next thing you know,
fucking nuclear war going on in the 

2367
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:06,190
United States.
Donald trump is bomb and bill gates,

2368
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:08,673
Mark Zuckerberg,
he's just a fucking hire massage to 

2369
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:12,243
protect him and his mansion because he 
feels that donald trump's trying to 

2370
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:16,480
assassinate him because he wants to be 
president.

2371
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:19,180
Oh my God.
I vote for Zuckerberg.

2372
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,300
Don't know man.
Dude made facebook.

2373
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:24,790
He wins.
They didn't even make it.

2374
01:42:24,791 --> 01:42:29,350
Apparently I didn't watch that movie.
When they say facebook know facebook,

2375
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:30,843
I think.
I think he's still a little but not so 

2376
01:42:32,441 --> 01:42:33,274
much as like someone who might be in a 
band and they break up and they make a 

2377
01:42:36,641 --> 01:42:38,640
song and that was kind of based on some 
riffs,

2378
01:42:38,641 --> 01:42:39,520
you know,
that someone was say.

2379
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:40,733
It's like,
well,

2380
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,100
it's hard.
Did he steal it?

2381
01:42:42,101 --> 01:42:45,400
A little like Chris Walks,
ex wife steals money from him.

2382
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:50,470
Do that by just going to court and 
stealing it just publicly.

2383
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:51,333
Well,
you know what they do.

2384
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:52,300
You get divorced.
They're like,

2385
01:42:52,301 --> 01:42:52,991
I want it.
Ah,

2386
01:42:52,991 --> 01:42:53,860
you motherfucker.
Oh,

2387
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:56,990
I know your money is.
I heard bill or Chris Act.

2388
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:58,100
I.
Eddie.

2389
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:01,390
Yeah.
Eddie Murphy would definitely talk about

2390
01:43:01,391 --> 01:43:02,440
that a lot.
Oh yeah.

2391
01:43:02,441 --> 01:43:03,274
Well,
Eddie Murphy was talking about with 

2392
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:04,090
Johnny Carson.

2393
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:04,923
Remember Johnny Carson and give up like 
hundreds of millions dollars to some 

2394
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:12,080
chick he was briefly having sex with and
Whoa,

2395
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:13,490
whoa.
Be.

2396
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,780
I mean not briefly,
but his entire life.

2397
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,180
He to her,
whatever that meant.

2398
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:23,080
Equally tell fucking single joke wasn't 
an even deal.

2399
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:25,220
But that stealing,
stealing,

2400
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:27,370
stealing too.
So did he steal in that way?

2401
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:30,260
Let Johnny Carson's wife still not May.
No,

2402
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:31,143
I,
I think,

2403
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:34,330
I think that he just had,
he had an idea of what to do with it so.

2404
01:43:34,331 --> 01:43:37,330
And that's.
But I don't think that he's necessarily.

2405
01:43:37,331 --> 01:43:38,164
I mean that can be proven wrong,
but I don't think he's necessarily an 

2406
01:43:40,391 --> 01:43:45,391
innovator in any way at the key refined 
an idea that was pretty obvious right in

2407
01:43:46,601 --> 01:43:47,980
my space had already existed.
Right.

2408
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:49,620
So people would register.
Yeah.

2409
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:51,600
Who the fuck used friendster?
I did.

2410
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:53,930
Jamie was one of the top dog.
I love France.

2411
01:43:53,950 --> 01:43:56,080
Shamiana.
Friendster tee shirt were everywhere.

2412
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:58,130
Go to friends who now?
It's so sad.

2413
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:58,993
It's sad.
It's,

2414
01:43:59,240 --> 01:43:59,811
it's,
yeah,

2415
01:43:59,811 --> 01:44:02,270
it's still there,
but it's owned by somebody might spill.

2416
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:05,150
Spill still exists as well.
I'm thinking of going back to my Spanish

2417
01:44:05,690 --> 01:44:06,770
man.
I don't know,

2418
01:44:06,810 --> 01:44:08,990
there's to be something else.
I think I could bring it back.

2419
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:10,950
I don't think you could.
I mean,

2420
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:13,480
but why would you want to friends still 
live in the.

2421
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,770
I'm kidding.
Friendster living the gang of friendster

2422
01:44:15,771 --> 01:44:16,604
is taking a break.
The redesigned friendster came about 

2423
01:44:19,011 --> 01:44:21,770
through enduring passion to make a 
difference over the what?

2424
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:24,920
Make a difference.
Make a difference in your bank account.

2425
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:26,160
Whoa.
Yeah.

2426
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:27,133
Over the years,
we have built a vibrant community and 

2427
01:44:29,121 --> 01:44:31,070
received valuable support and 
encouragement.

2428
01:44:31,071 --> 01:44:31,904
However,
due to the evolving landscape and are 

2429
01:44:33,381 --> 01:44:35,690
challenging industry,
the online gaming,

2430
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:36,553
online,
online gaming community did not engage 

2431
01:44:39,111 --> 01:44:41,970
as much as we had hoped for.
[inaudible]

2432
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:43,483
profound development in gaming in the 
gaming industry has also led us to 

2433
01:44:46,851 --> 01:44:50,090
rethink our strategic priorities.
We have dust made,

2434
01:44:50,091 --> 01:44:52,730
the decision to take a break and pause 
our services.

2435
01:44:52,731 --> 01:44:57,560
Effective June 14,
2015 break kids.

2436
01:44:57,561 --> 01:45:00,600
You quit two years ago.
You fuck quit.

2437
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,260
Quit.
Quit two years in.

2438
01:45:03,261 --> 01:45:04,094
You've got to say like if you know,
if you and your girlfriend had taken a 

2439
01:45:06,231 --> 01:45:07,940
break,
it's been two years.

2440
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,560
You're not taking a break anymore.
No.

2441
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:10,413
Right.
You guys have seen each other in two 

2442
01:45:11,421 --> 01:45:12,470
years.
Yes.

2443
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,020
It totally fits.
Pretty safe over friendster.

2444
01:45:15,230 --> 01:45:17,470
And then for the Internet,
I mean multiply that times 10,

2445
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:20,730
maybe someone's going to come out with a
new one of virtual reality,

2446
01:45:21,050 --> 01:45:24,920
augmented reality based.
Well altspace almost happened was that I

2447
01:45:24,921 --> 01:45:26,270
was working with them and what they were
doing,

2448
01:45:26,271 --> 01:45:31,130
standup comedy and like a,
it's basically like a facebook of Vr,

2449
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:31,993
so social vr and uh,
that was really fun and they really 

2450
01:45:34,941 --> 01:45:36,290
helped out amazingly well.

2451
01:45:36,290 --> 01:45:37,940
They were like the coolest.
They're really cool.

2452
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:39,063
Justin reuland and I hung out when they 
night together in a graveyard with like 

2453
01:45:42,141 --> 01:45:45,890
500 other fans and we just fucked around
for an hour and 40 minutes.

2454
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:49,040
He was at his house with a small team of
people,

2455
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:50,480
making sure he was all good and he had 
uh,

2456
01:45:50,570 --> 01:45:53,000
he had uh,
a motion capture suit,

2457
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:56,150
a motion sensor suit and uh,
yeah it is.

2458
01:45:56,370 --> 01:46:00,020
And that's me doing stand up.
So that's why I'm moving that character.

2459
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:04,580
That's crazy in my living room.
Just like,

2460
01:46:04,581 --> 01:46:06,140
hey guys,
I mean that,

2461
01:46:06,230 --> 01:46:08,570
that easily could take the place of 
touring.

2462
01:46:08,850 --> 01:46:09,683
Yeah,
they had some toys where you can 

2463
01:46:10,491 --> 01:46:14,030
interface and you could be on stage in 
front of and even if you.

2464
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:17,660
How about this,
that people go to a place and the people

2465
01:46:17,661 --> 01:46:22,250
actually go to a theater and you just 
get live themed into the theater.

2466
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:24,290
You don't have to be there with some 
concerts.

2467
01:46:24,291 --> 01:46:25,124
Right?
Like a live broadcasts like simulcasts 

2468
01:46:27,001 --> 01:46:28,340
did it in theaters.
Yeah,

2469
01:46:28,341 --> 01:46:30,070
like rolling stone or something like 
that.

2470
01:46:30,190 --> 01:46:32,240
It was different than a hologram.
No,

2471
01:46:32,241 --> 01:46:33,230
no,
that's different than like,

2472
01:46:33,231 --> 01:46:36,470
get immersive vr.
Oh,

2473
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:40,640
did that rapper chief Keef event?
And they were saying like he couldn't go

2474
01:46:40,641 --> 01:46:41,900
because there's going to be riots and 
whatnot.

2475
01:46:41,901 --> 01:46:44,510
So they agreed to do was have them be a 
hologram.

2476
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:45,523
Oh yeah,
they did that little curve scrying 

2477
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:49,980
projection because people don't

2478
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,180
like him.
No.

2479
01:46:51,181 --> 01:46:52,550
Just uh,
he's a,

2480
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,390
he incites the crowds I guess.
I don't know,

2481
01:46:54,530 --> 01:46:56,950
just silly.
Very lit when he performs.

2482
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:59,190
He's a,
he's crazy fellow,

2483
01:46:59,191 --> 01:47:00,330
right?
He's a wild one.

2484
01:47:00,350 --> 01:47:01,560
Yeah.
That chief Keef.

2485
01:47:02,430 --> 01:47:04,890
I've seen him on the instagram.
Yeah,

2486
01:47:04,891 --> 01:47:07,170
he's a young,
crazy rapper.

2487
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:09,090
Gotcha.
Yeah.

2488
01:47:09,091 --> 01:47:11,320
He's one of the wild,
wild child.

2489
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:14,100
Very aggressively.
Crazy ones.

2490
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:15,023
So they had him as a hologram on stage.
So there's real people at the show and 

2491
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:18,864
let me hear this.

2492
01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:28,700
Whoa.
This is so strange.

2493
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:31,070
Yeah.
They've been doing in Japan for awhile.

2494
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:34,490
They have like pop stars,
artificial intelligence.

2495
01:47:37,630 --> 01:47:39,340
It seems like he has to stand in one 
place.

2496
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:40,223
Yeah.
I think the hologram thing Kinda sorta 

2497
01:47:41,411 --> 01:47:42,244
like the will I am situation.
Remember he couldn't or you can't like 

2498
01:47:44,501 --> 01:47:47,010
walk around the room but you can talk to
someone.

2499
01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:48,640
Wow.
Yeah.

2500
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:50,590
So weird.
The Japanese technology,

2501
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:55,340
but it's like an obvious curved huge 
screen.

2502
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:58,160
Can you imagine if you went somewhere to
watch a hologram?

2503
01:47:58,161 --> 01:48:00,650
You'd be so angry with the person,
isn't there?

2504
01:48:01,810 --> 01:48:02,643
Can you be there and you know,
you have to be weird to go somewhere 

2505
01:48:06,201 --> 01:48:10,000
publicly and then to watch a hologram.
I feel like it's the future though,

2506
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:11,390
unless it's someone who doesn't live 
anymore.

2507
01:48:11,530 --> 01:48:12,590
Right?
Like Tupac,

2508
01:48:12,650 --> 01:48:13,483
like when they did,
they'd made Tupac way more jacked than 

2509
01:48:15,141 --> 01:48:16,220
it really is.
Do you notice that?

2510
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:17,241
No.
Yeah.

2511
01:48:17,241 --> 01:48:20,360
Then they did the Tupac one.
They had them like a crossfit Tupac.

2512
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:25,730
Tupac was in insane shape.
He really looked like floyd mayweather.

2513
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:26,340
That's.
Yeah,

2514
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:28,430
because he was a pretty pretty wired 
look at them.

2515
01:48:28,431 --> 01:48:30,470
Look at them.
Oh No.

2516
01:48:30,620 --> 01:48:31,820
Yeah.
Come on dude.

2517
01:48:31,850 --> 01:48:32,683
Now these Super Jack Tupac,
Tupac that's doing Jujitsu five times a 

2518
01:48:37,701 --> 01:48:38,780
week,
right?

2519
01:48:38,781 --> 01:48:40,550
That tupacs got a six pack.

2520
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:43,490
He's got big muscles.
Is that buck?

2521
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:45,470
Was that really?
Is that video footage?

2522
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:47,150
Yeah,
this is from Coachella,

2523
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,230
but they've made it holographic.
No,

2524
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:51,170
but I mean the.
The footage there,

2525
01:48:51,171 --> 01:48:52,850
did the generate it?
Oh,

2526
01:48:52,851 --> 01:48:53,540
they generate.
It's.

2527
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:54,950
This is all.
Yeah.

2528
01:48:54,951 --> 01:48:57,710
This is all CGI body double.
Was it a body double?

2529
01:48:58,030 --> 01:48:59,330
Oh,
well that's part of the problem.

2530
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:00,373
They use some body double who jacked.
She should have told that dude's got to 

2531
01:49:03,191 --> 01:49:05,420
lay off the weights for a couple years 
if you want to play Tupac.

2532
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:07,220
Yeah,
because I don't think they would've been

2533
01:49:07,221 --> 01:49:10,100
able to track his performance in the 
nineties.

2534
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:11,053
Well,
this guy who they used the body that 

2535
01:49:11,931 --> 01:49:12,764
will,
they got overzealous because he's way 

2536
01:49:13,761 --> 01:49:16,640
too big.
I mean he's like 20 pounds heavier.

2537
01:49:16,641 --> 01:49:19,200
Right?
I'm not exaggerating.

2538
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:22,060
I think he was wired.
He was wired with this guy.

2539
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:23,473
This guy's Jack an MMA fighter.
He's pulling tyron woodley almost 

2540
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:30,420
tonight.
They have a side by side.

2541
01:49:30,910 --> 01:49:32,300
This captain Jack?
Yeah,

2542
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:35,150
he's getting.
He's built like George St Pierre.

2543
01:49:35,210 --> 01:49:37,580
Like that's a good.
That's a good comparison.

2544
01:49:37,581 --> 01:49:41,090
Not Quite tyron woodley levels,
but pretty fucking jacked.

2545
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:44,210
You got a side by side.
They don't have one.

2546
01:49:44,590 --> 01:49:47,050
I'm trying to ponder.
The fate just came up,

2547
01:49:47,150 --> 01:49:48,040
said it wasn't actually

2548
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,350
a Hologram and I'm trying to think.
Oh,

2549
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:50,830
what they're saying,
what that means,

2550
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:54,820
what CGI generated.
Then special effects studio made it.

2551
01:49:54,821 --> 01:49:56,470
Yes.
Expensive CGI.

2552
01:49:56,650 --> 01:49:57,880
Yeah.
See that's what I was saying.

2553
01:49:58,060 --> 01:49:59,680
So maybe they used a body double the 
track,

2554
01:49:59,681 --> 01:50:00,514
the movements and then they got 
overzealous when they went to give him 

2555
01:50:02,051 --> 01:50:06,060
six packs and packs and just like they 
made a star,

2556
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:08,740
a star wars figurines or like all 
jacked.

2557
01:50:08,770 --> 01:50:10,300
They're all super muscular.
Yeah.

2558
01:50:10,301 --> 01:50:12,300
It was like,
what the fuck you skywalker's jagged?

2559
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:13,173
Yeah.
It was like it was like late nineties 

2560
01:50:15,161 --> 01:50:18,090
star wars or something like that.
Yeah.

2561
01:50:19,810 --> 01:50:20,643
It's like super hero bullshit,
but people wanted superhero bullshit 

2562
01:50:23,621 --> 01:50:24,454
back then.
Like if you tried to put out a figurine 

2563
01:50:26,471 --> 01:50:29,390
of someone who wasn't jacked,
people used to superhero figurines,

2564
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:31,720
so it's just so dumb though.
It's like,

2565
01:50:31,721 --> 01:50:33,370
I want something that looks like the 
thing.

2566
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:36,310
I don't want to fucking cheat because 
otherwise it looks cheap.

2567
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:37,750
It looks lazy.
Just Lazy.

2568
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:39,993
There's what?

2569
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:43,953
Yeah,
but that's not going to be one where he 

2570
01:50:45,011 --> 01:50:48,040
doesn't have his shirt off his shirt to 
show the thug life tattoo.

2571
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:49,420
Yeah.
You got to get the whole.

2572
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:50,470
Yeah.
The guy.

2573
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:52,540
That guy's way more jacked.
Trust me.

2574
01:50:52,541 --> 01:50:53,374
Oh,
there you go.

2575
01:50:54,530 --> 01:50:55,420
Yeah.
See,

2576
01:50:55,450 --> 01:50:58,900
I mean come on,
just get the smaller waist because why?

2577
01:50:58,930 --> 01:51:01,480
He looks like a lightweight boxer.
Yeah.

2578
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:04,220
Yeah.
That's what he lives in shape for sure.

2579
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:05,830
He's definitely in shape.
He's not fat,

2580
01:51:05,831 --> 01:51:06,790
but like that,
that.

2581
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:07,870
I mean,
come on.

2582
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:11,140
That guy's super duper jacked.
Yeah.

2583
01:51:11,141 --> 01:51:13,410
I don't know where they got those 
proportions is from.

2584
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:14,253
You're going to be that jacked.
Like you really have to not eat 

2585
01:51:17,291 --> 01:51:18,460
anything.
That's bullshit.

2586
01:51:18,490 --> 01:51:19,090
Oh,
I know.

2587
01:51:19,090 --> 01:51:21,910
Like you can't be fucking around at all.
Not even slightly.

2588
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:22,840
No.
It's just like,

2589
01:51:22,870 --> 01:51:25,130
oh,
like straight protein,

2590
01:51:25,390 --> 01:51:27,010
super cleanly.
Just Broccoli.

2591
01:51:27,011 --> 01:51:28,720
Chicken breast,
egg whites,

2592
01:51:28,810 --> 01:51:29,643
no beers?

2593
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:30,251
No.
No,

2594
01:51:30,251 --> 01:51:31,500
not one beer at all.
No.

2595
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:33,590
No.
Like a water,

2596
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:35,080
no salt,
no salt,

2597
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:36,220
no salt.
Uh,

2598
01:51:36,230 --> 01:51:40,960
and in fact one day you'll probably fast
or you'll like overwater like by gallons

2599
01:51:40,961 --> 01:51:43,210
and gallons.
Then not drink for two days.

2600
01:51:43,211 --> 01:51:45,120
Probably take diuretics before you do 
this shit.

2601
01:51:45,121 --> 01:51:46,630
Retics.
Yet they made one.

2602
01:51:46,631 --> 01:51:47,200
Uh,
you wouldn't,

2603
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,033
would you let them add a little bit 
extra water weight or no fucking 

2604
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,600
slimming down?
Say leave me at the way.

2605
01:51:52,601 --> 01:51:53,470
Um,
they already did.

2606
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:54,673
I'm in real life.
Fight in real life and we got to watch 

2607
01:51:59,531 --> 01:52:00,364
it.
You'd be,

2608
01:52:00,530 --> 01:52:01,363
I guess either way the fuck I am man.
Don't make me look more muscular than I 

2609
01:52:04,601 --> 01:52:06,100
really am.
It's more immersive.

2610
01:52:06,210 --> 01:52:07,510
Yeah.
And the EA video game,

2611
01:52:07,511 --> 01:52:10,870
that's my actual body.
They took fucking hundreds of pictures.

2612
01:52:10,871 --> 01:52:14,080
They have you stand,
they rotate around you with a camera.

2613
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:15,213
They have this thing that spins around 
you and takes photos of all these 

2614
01:52:18,161 --> 01:52:19,270
different precise angles.

2615
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:21,160
You have to do all these different 
things with your body.

2616
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:23,930
You have to do things with your arms.
You have to stand with your hands up,

2617
01:52:23,931 --> 01:52:24,764
you have to extend your fists.
He had the doing the doing the 

2618
01:52:26,441 --> 01:52:29,500
combination,
volumetric capture and optical capture.

2619
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,200
That's what actually.
So they skin you.

2620
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:34,650
There you go.
The skin they put,

2621
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:39,460
they basically skinny up the optical 
information mixed stitched with a little

2622
01:52:39,461 --> 01:52:40,390
bit of CGI.
Yeah,

2623
01:52:40,391 --> 01:52:42,040
that's great.
Let's see that.

2624
01:52:42,041 --> 01:52:43,060
Look,
it looks like a person,

2625
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:46,080
a real person.
That's the sort of person looks like.

2626
01:52:46,081 --> 01:52:49,280
I mean your face does look a little 
uncanny valley,

2627
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:50,693
but a video game character,
there are about five years away from 

2628
01:52:53,991 --> 01:52:55,130
that.
Not existing anymore.

2629
01:52:55,131 --> 01:52:55,964
Right?
Five years away from just freaking the 

2630
01:52:57,261 --> 01:53:00,050
fuck out with it.
Like avatar did a great job.

2631
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:01,490
Yeah.
That CGI was like,

2632
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:03,890
I mean,
half of it was the actor's face.

2633
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:05,390
Right?
But the rest of it,

2634
01:53:05,391 --> 01:53:06,224
I mean it looked very natural.
What's really cool is that they 

2635
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:09,343
immediately for a movie like avatars 
that they can have something that's not 

2636
01:53:11,871 --> 01:53:14,090
a real thing.
Like what's really challenging?

2637
01:53:14,150 --> 01:53:16,070
Oh yeah.
Do a CGI of a real thing.

2638
01:53:16,510 --> 01:53:17,343
Absolutely.
Or game of thrones do with wolves and 

2639
01:53:20,630 --> 01:53:23,930
they have to be real careful about.
They shoot it like I am legend with will

2640
01:53:23,931 --> 01:53:24,764
Smith.
They did it with lions and it was kind 

2641
01:53:25,481 --> 01:53:26,390
of clunky.
Oh yeah,

2642
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:27,110
yeah,
yeah.

2643
01:53:27,110 --> 01:53:27,943
No that no zombies and I am legend.
That worked perfect because they this 

2644
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:31,890
thing a real thing.
Yeah.

2645
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:32,840
It's just like A.
Yeah,

2646
01:53:32,841 --> 01:53:34,970
it's a fantasy creature.
You don't have a point of reference.

2647
01:53:34,971 --> 01:53:35,804
What is this James

2648
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,833
from Logan that digitally did his face 
and like almost all of these action 

2649
01:53:39,901 --> 01:53:42,630
scenes because I don't know whether he 
didn't do it or not,

2650
01:53:42,631 --> 01:53:43,464
but a little piece just came out.
I don't know if it just came out this 

2651
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:46,860
week.
I just saw it the other day.

2652
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:48,083
It's a really cool little three minute 
piece about the digital doubles where 

2653
01:53:49,860 --> 01:53:52,740
it's called of Logan.
Somebody wants to watch that.

2654
01:53:52,890 --> 01:53:54,870
I try to put up.
Was that the stunt guy?

2655
01:53:54,990 --> 01:53:56,330
Yeah,
this is the stunt guy and then they kind

2656
01:53:56,331 --> 01:53:58,680
of show the break though that that was 
the actual clip and they'll show you the

2657
01:53:58,681 --> 01:54:01,090
breakdown now of how they like added.
Wow.

2658
01:54:01,290 --> 01:54:02,123
Each little piece to it to make what you
saw from the little camera angles and 

2659
01:54:06,541 --> 01:54:08,340
then lead shield.
This is incredible.

2660
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:09,900
It's really cool.
Oh,

2661
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:11,003
that's so the dude just got a God this 
and then this thing later here in a 

2662
01:54:17,491 --> 01:54:22,491
second and show you how all the cameras 
that they use to get his actual face.

2663
01:54:22,710 --> 01:54:25,310
So this was CGI.
What?

2664
01:54:25,530 --> 01:54:26,940
That scene,
that whole scene.

2665
01:54:28,110 --> 01:54:29,250
These scenes where CGI.

2666
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:35,180
That's incredible.
That's incredible.

2667
01:54:35,970 --> 01:54:37,040
Well,
you know what's fucked up?

2668
01:54:37,190 --> 01:54:38,023
Even though it's CGI,
they still made it as obvious as a real 

2669
01:54:42,861 --> 01:54:47,120
fight scene with actors and stuntmen 
doesn't movement is real,

2670
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:49,640
but it looks very obvious that it's 
fake,

2671
01:54:49,670 --> 01:54:50,451
is what I'm saying.
Oh,

2672
01:54:50,451 --> 01:54:51,280
now it does.
Yeah.

2673
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:52,610
To me,
but in the movie,

2674
01:54:52,611 --> 01:54:53,930
I didn't know.
That's not what I mean.

2675
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:54,913
I mean,
it looks very obvious that it's a fake 

2676
01:54:56,271 --> 01:54:57,500
fight,
meaning,

2677
01:54:57,530 --> 01:54:58,500
oh,
it looks great.

2678
01:54:58,770 --> 01:54:59,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

2679
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:02,330
Because you can't actually have a guy 
punched the guy.

2680
01:55:02,331 --> 01:55:05,120
You can't actually have the guy shoot 
him first,

2681
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:06,213
you know,
and he absorbs the bullet and keeps 

2682
01:55:07,491 --> 01:55:09,570
going and cuts the guy's head off with 
his,

2683
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:13,340
with his claws.
But they could have done something along

2684
01:55:13,341 --> 01:55:14,210
those lines.
They,

2685
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:15,053
they choreographed it like they would 
choreograph like a fight scene and a 

2686
01:55:18,471 --> 01:55:20,180
$6,000,000
man episode.

2687
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:21,170
You know what I'm saying?
Like,

2688
01:55:21,170 --> 01:55:22,160
Oh,
I'm gonna Punch you.

2689
01:55:22,161 --> 01:55:23,420
Oh,
you stabbed me first,

2690
01:55:23,680 --> 01:55:25,030
I'm going to shoot you long.
You Cut.

2691
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:25,971
Right,
right,

2692
01:55:25,971 --> 01:55:26,720
right.
Well,

2693
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:31,430
that's my thing with,
with a tactical scenes and fight scenes.

2694
01:55:31,490 --> 01:55:33,410
For me,
it's like it,

2695
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:34,273
it can be.
You just have to balance the 

2696
01:55:35,871 --> 01:55:36,704
believability level.
So if it's kind of cartoony acts like 

2697
01:55:40,161 --> 01:55:40,994
violence or whatever,
then make sure that the physics flow 

2698
01:55:43,381 --> 01:55:44,020
together really

2699
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:46,590
well.
Like captain America winter soldier,

2700
01:55:46,591 --> 01:55:48,390
one of my favorite,
uh,

2701
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:52,050
of the marvel movies,
just the fight scenes are incredible.

2702
01:55:52,051 --> 01:55:54,570
They really,
really well done and pretty bad ass.

2703
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:55,433
Pretty bad.
Like when fucking winter soldier gets 

2704
01:55:56,581 --> 01:55:58,680
hit and he likes slides backwards,
you know,

2705
01:55:58,681 --> 01:55:59,514
there's always that thing where a guy 
gets hit and he slides backwards and 

2706
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:03,930
pavement gets torn up and he's like 
holding a stance.

2707
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:07,230
But the physics on it looked really 
good.

2708
01:56:07,790 --> 01:56:08,431
I was like,
oh,

2709
01:56:08,431 --> 01:56:09,264
that's great.
And they were just paying attention to 

2710
01:56:10,031 --> 01:56:10,864
all these little subtle physics details 
and that's what makes me appreciate the 

2711
01:56:14,701 --> 01:56:19,490
fighting or like seeing Gina Carano a 
fight like fake fight in movies.

2712
01:56:19,491 --> 01:56:20,820
She knows how to take a hit,
right.

2713
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:23,010
So,
so when she gets hit,

2714
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:25,320
she knows what it looks like when you 
get hit,

2715
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:26,293
right,
but certain way or certain angle or 

2716
01:56:27,301 --> 01:56:29,910
whatever.
And not saying that she's the best best,

2717
01:56:29,911 --> 01:56:30,744
but just as an example of someone who 
actually does make contact or has had 

2718
01:56:33,931 --> 01:56:34,764
experience in that the reactions are a 
little bit more believable and also 

2719
01:56:38,911 --> 01:56:42,570
they're probably more willing to let 
people get close closer I'm sure.

2720
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:45,270
And also you don't feel like you're 
being treated like a fool.

2721
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:46,620
Exactly.
That's what I'm,

2722
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:47,483
that's what I'm talking about because 
it's otherwise it's just like let you 

2723
01:56:50,461 --> 01:56:53,270
see the people waiting for the next hit.
Like when you see this,

2724
01:56:53,271 --> 01:56:54,104
those fight scenes were people standing 
around in a circle and one guy goes in 

2725
01:56:57,180 --> 01:57:00,000
and then everyone else is waiting.
That would not work like that,

2726
01:57:00,001 --> 01:57:00,740
man.
No,

2727
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:02,370
no.
Everybody's just going to wait.

2728
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:04,680
Well that's the rules.
It's just one guy at a time.

2729
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:05,970
Okay.
Now the next.

2730
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:06,900
Okay,
now you try it,

2731
01:57:06,901 --> 01:57:08,130
Tony.
Oh God.

2732
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:09,420
He's really good.
Okay.

2733
01:57:09,690 --> 01:57:11,610
Walter?
Yeah.

2734
01:57:11,620 --> 01:57:12,453
It has to be some like that's one of the
things that I've found almost yearly 

2735
01:57:16,081 --> 01:57:19,950
impressive about John Wick.
John Wick is preposterous.

2736
01:57:21,490 --> 01:57:22,620
See,
that's what I'm saying.

2737
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:23,573
They balanced that shit so when you get 
it out because you see it as 

2738
01:57:25,951 --> 01:57:26,784
choreography,
but it's so fucking tactically and 

2739
01:57:30,391 --> 01:57:35,040
imaginatively thought out and 
stylistically gorgeous and all the,

2740
01:57:35,041 --> 01:57:37,180
all the ingredients go together and you 
see those,

2741
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:38,530
that footage of him,
you know,

2742
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:39,383
running three gun training or these 
fucking rock and through those courses 

2743
01:57:41,761 --> 01:57:45,070
for real because he's using live rounds 
and,

2744
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:47,190
and so when I see that movie,
I'm like,

2745
01:57:47,220 --> 01:57:48,053
Oh shit,
these guys know what the fuck they're 

2746
01:57:49,291 --> 01:57:49,650
doing.

2747
01:57:49,650 --> 01:57:50,483
They're not fucking around.
They're like using special forces guys 

2748
01:57:53,071 --> 01:57:53,904
for training.
They're using a specialized team of 

2749
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:59,760
martial artists to create a customized 
version of martial arts.

2750
01:57:59,761 --> 01:58:01,170
Just for him.
My friend,

2751
01:58:01,171 --> 01:58:05,210
he and Machado did a lot of the Jujitsu 
choreographed choreography for it.

2752
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:06,660
That's who I was watching.
Yeah.

2753
01:58:06,661 --> 01:58:09,150
And I love their whole fucking take on 
it and their approach.

2754
01:58:09,151 --> 01:58:12,000
It's artistry.
It's like that's what it is.

2755
01:58:12,030 --> 01:58:14,790
There was no,
like everything that he did woodwork,

2756
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:16,133
there was no jump up and kick two dudes 
in the head at the same time and shoot 

2757
01:58:18,301 --> 01:58:20,970
through a window and shoot a guy a mile 
away and the head no,

2758
01:58:20,980 --> 01:58:21,661
no,
no,

2759
01:58:21,661 --> 01:58:21,931
no,
no.

2760
01:58:21,931 --> 01:58:22,764
It's like if you trained really well and
that situation presented itself the way 

2761
01:58:27,391 --> 01:58:29,550
that it did,
you could do that.

2762
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:31,680
It's possible.
And,

2763
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:33,930
but it was also very cartoony to 
totally.

2764
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:34,640
Yeah,
that's what,

2765
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:35,820
that's what that was so great about it.

2766
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:36,653
So it's like,
it's this perfect because the whole 

2767
01:58:37,651 --> 01:58:38,850
world was heightened,
you know,

2768
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:42,940
like the whole hotel thing and assassins
having like great grants and the courts.

2769
01:58:43,180 --> 01:58:47,290
So it's already in that world.
So you just need to create efficiency,

2770
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:48,760
you know,
all in all it is,

2771
01:58:48,761 --> 01:58:53,170
is just like lethal efficiency with a,
with a kiss of artistry.

2772
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:56,200
And there's a uniformity and John Wick's
personality.

2773
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:57,340
Yes.
So,

2774
01:58:57,460 --> 01:59:01,690
so Samurai that you believe that he 
could do all this and not be affected by

2775
01:59:01,691 --> 01:59:03,000
killing all these people.
Yeah,

2776
01:59:03,190 --> 01:59:04,480
I know,
I know what it's like.

2777
01:59:04,481 --> 01:59:05,840
Other people,
he's killing our.

2778
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,350
Our our players.
Yeah.

2779
01:59:07,450 --> 01:59:09,460
They're all players in the game and they
deserve it.

2780
01:59:09,461 --> 01:59:10,294
They killed his dog.
It killed his dog and anybody who gets 

2781
01:59:12,731 --> 01:59:14,200
in the way,
not that it's their fault,

2782
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:18,040
but if they decide to take him on then 
he just has to.

2783
01:59:18,041 --> 01:59:19,240
It's just professional.

2784
01:59:19,630 --> 01:59:21,500
He's a professional.
Even in his revenge,

2785
01:59:21,501 --> 01:59:22,061
she's perfect.
Well,

2786
01:59:22,061 --> 01:59:22,894
except for the part where it shoots the 
dude in the hotel and gets 

2787
01:59:24,671 --> 01:59:26,080
excommunicated,
but other than that,

2788
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:30,160
I mean I just love that character so 
much.

2789
01:59:30,161 --> 01:59:32,200
I love the stunt driving and that's not 
CGI.

2790
01:59:32,201 --> 01:59:33,034
That's him.
That's as a 51 year old man fucking 

2791
01:59:35,621 --> 01:59:38,050
destroying it and I'm like,
you know what,

2792
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:39,033
if anything,
even if you like that type of stuff or 

2793
01:59:41,201 --> 01:59:43,450
if you don't like that stuff,
just watch a scene.

2794
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:45,400
Look at the artistry of the 
choreography.

2795
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:47,300
Think about how old he is now,
hardy,

2796
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:48,153
train,
and then try to have someone who's 

2797
01:59:49,651 --> 01:59:51,310
sitting on the couch going,
I can't lose.

2798
01:59:51,670 --> 01:59:56,670
I can't lose that 30 pounds without.
I mean I'm talking about someone who has

2799
01:59:56,711 --> 01:59:58,240
no help.
It's just them alone,

2800
01:59:58,241 --> 01:59:59,074
just going,
I can't.

2801
01:59:59,290 --> 02:00:00,190
It's like,
man,

2802
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:03,520
it anything is possible.
Any anything is possible.

2803
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:06,250
You just have to fucking do that shit.
Yeah.

2804
02:00:06,251 --> 02:00:07,950
Well,
I think that movie is like,

2805
02:00:08,700 --> 02:00:09,533
it's a masterpiece of that genre.
There's a lot of those style movies are 

2806
02:00:15,761 --> 02:00:17,680
fun and everything like that.
Well,

2807
02:00:17,681 --> 02:00:20,500
I think what John Wick movies did is 
they took that.

2808
02:00:20,501 --> 02:00:23,350
They boiled down the story too,
like there's no.

2809
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:27,850
There's no ambiguity as to whether or 
not there's bad people and good people.

2810
02:00:27,851 --> 02:00:29,500
Whether or not I should kill all these 
fucking goofball.

2811
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:31,340
Absolutely.
Should kill them all.

2812
02:00:31,450 --> 02:00:33,250
He's absolutely going to.
It's awesome.

2813
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:35,500
Yeah,
and it's okay because it's a game.

2814
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:36,281
Yeah.
That's,

2815
02:00:36,281 --> 02:00:38,440
that's the whole thing about it.
That's what's so brilliant about it.

2816
02:00:38,441 --> 02:00:39,274
It's like it's a game,
but it allows stunt men tactical expert 

2817
02:00:42,881 --> 02:00:46,720
forward moviemaking because it's really,
that's what it is.

2818
02:00:46,721 --> 02:00:50,080
It's mostly that the stair,
the story kind of takes you along and an

2819
02:00:50,081 --> 02:00:52,000
interesting,
but it's a pretty narrow pathway.

2820
02:00:52,030 --> 02:00:52,863
The rest,
like the apocalypse now of like shoot 

2821
02:00:56,201 --> 02:00:58,780
'em off of tactical thrillers or 
tactical,

2822
02:00:58,781 --> 02:01:00,610
whatever you call them,
whatever you would call those.

2823
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:02,560
The masterpiece of those,
you know,

2824
02:01:02,561 --> 02:01:04,150
if you get a chance,
check out this guy.

2825
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:06,150
Have you ever seen strike back?
No.

2826
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:07,980
That's a cinemax show.
Um,

2827
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:09,250
to show.
Yeah.

2828
02:01:09,251 --> 02:01:11,230
It's a serious.
Cinemax was real anymore.

2829
02:01:11,670 --> 02:01:14,260
Too many networks.
I know skinemax people started.

2830
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:19,180
I remember that back in the day.
Softcore porn and be like,

2831
02:01:19,181 --> 02:01:22,330
holy shit,
this is crazy.

2832
02:01:22,331 --> 02:01:23,164
They would lie down on the bed and the 
lady's leg and naked Lakewood drape 

2833
02:01:25,961 --> 02:01:27,820
around the man's body.
So you knew what was going on.

2834
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:29,520
I can't believe this.
I know.

2835
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:31,570
Isn't the physics would trick you up?
Be like,

2836
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:32,950
okay.
The way they're lying,

2837
02:01:32,951 --> 02:01:34,810
his dick doesn't feel it doesn't look 
right.

2838
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:38,590
How is he having sex with her?
Having sex with the front of her vagina?

2839
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:40,280
No Way.
He's reaching

2840
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:42,510
her actual vagina is way too low.
What is he doing?

2841
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:45,770
You know,
the man was.

2842
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:48,240
He was in the wrong spot.
That's so great.

2843
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:50,330
Oh,
she's like,

2844
02:01:50,331 --> 02:01:52,740
you're doing it wrong.
Just like,

2845
02:01:56,210 --> 02:01:59,840
how does that sit?
Oh,

2846
02:01:59,841 --> 02:02:01,770
that's great.
Yeah.

2847
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:05,030
Like just obviously someone in a studio 
adding sound later.

2848
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:08,910
Genres about those,
there a series of moves.

2849
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:10,760
Emmanuelle.
Do you remember those?

2850
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:15,290
Emmanuel goes to Paris and Mary 
Emmanuelle goes to Italy.

2851
02:02:15,291 --> 02:02:18,260
They were all like Danielle steel point?
No,

2852
02:02:18,261 --> 02:02:21,830
because Danielle steel,
like it would be more for the ladies.

2853
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:23,720
Oh,
right.

2854
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:24,711
I got you.
Yep.

2855
02:02:24,711 --> 02:02:25,020
Yep.
Right.

2856
02:02:25,020 --> 02:02:29,450
Like she was like this,
a exotic traveling lady would fuck these

2857
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:33,440
dudes in hotels in these movies.
So that was so corny.

2858
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:34,340
Oh,
that's right.

2859
02:02:34,370 --> 02:02:36,380
But you will be so excited.
But it was softcore.

2860
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:37,273
Yeah.
When I was like 16 when we first got 

2861
02:02:39,231 --> 02:02:40,250
cable,
you know,

2862
02:02:40,251 --> 02:02:40,651
like,
um,

2863
02:02:40,651 --> 02:02:42,290
my parents were sleep originally put 
there.

2864
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,153
Okay.
Cut It.

2865
02:02:43,370 --> 02:02:48,370
Tune into showtime or cinemax unless 
she's a manual for manual three.

2866
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:53,090
Shit.
Holy Shit.

2867
02:02:53,270 --> 02:02:55,320
Everybody was a little kid.
He like,

2868
02:02:55,330 --> 02:02:56,480
yeah,
I'm going to see some tiddy.

2869
02:02:56,590 --> 02:02:57,423
Oh,
I can't believe I'm going to see a lady 

2870
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:00,260
and some more shit.
Yeah.

2871
02:03:00,261 --> 02:03:03,240
You're like,
I'm about to see some real adult stuff.

2872
02:03:03,270 --> 02:03:06,170
We'll see this lady.
As long as you don't see genitals,

2873
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:11,060
we do not tolerate genitals for breasts 
are okay.

2874
02:03:11,210 --> 02:03:12,460
But that's not A.
Yeah.

2875
02:03:13,130 --> 02:03:13,963
One.
And just walk around in public like Ari 

2876
02:03:15,410 --> 02:03:16,640
Shaffir does.
Oh yeah,

2877
02:03:16,820 --> 02:03:17,630
that's true.
Like,

2878
02:03:17,630 --> 02:03:18,770
like,
who's already fear?

2879
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:21,020
The Irish beer stand up.
Comedian.

2880
02:03:21,050 --> 02:03:21,883
Good friend of mine thinks he's more 
famous than he is obviously a 

2881
02:03:24,150 --> 02:03:24,983
disadvantage.
Well,

2882
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:26,473
the Cobra Hot Emmanuelle Oh she's.
She's getting acupuncture to be more 

2883
02:03:32,691 --> 02:03:33,950
hot.
Oh Jesus.

2884
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:35,750
Really?
Undeniable.

2885
02:03:35,810 --> 02:03:37,630
Like that 80 is beauty.
Yeah.

2886
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:38,400
Look at that.

02:03:41,931 --> 02:03:43,160
Please fuck the pool guy.

2890
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:45,290
Why don't you have a Cobra and lower 
left corner?

2891
02:03:45,291 --> 02:03:48,140
Because it's probably someone's like 
channel can repost.

2892
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:52,430
Dude.
I remember looking out the window.

2893
02:03:52,431 --> 02:03:55,040
Maybe this deck in that building.
That's so crazy.

2894
02:03:55,070 --> 02:03:57,710
Maybe I should go to that building.
This building is tired.

2895
02:03:57,770 --> 02:03:58,340
She's.
Look,

2896
02:03:58,340 --> 02:04:01,400
she's like pretending to be a geisha 
cultural appropriation.

2897
02:04:01,401 --> 02:04:01,971
Yeah,
totally.

2898
02:04:01,971 --> 02:04:02,720
No,
no,

2899
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:03,530
no.
That is.

2900
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:04,740
That is.
That is so much reforming.

2901
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:07,340
A ritualistic dance of some sort.
You're that guy.

2902
02:04:07,570 --> 02:04:08,403
I had to like try to figure out what was
going on there that she's mounting him 

2903
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:13,460
mounted.
Galen Kissing his face.

2904
02:04:13,490 --> 02:04:14,990
Just crazy.
Oh,

2905
02:04:14,991 --> 02:04:15,870
see,
see other houses.

2906
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:16,680
I go,
yeah.

2907
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:18,130
There was a brief moment.
Look,

2908
02:04:18,350 --> 02:04:20,100
nowhere near each other is.
Yeah.

2909
02:04:20,610 --> 02:04:22,520
Yeah.
It's just like the idea.

2910
02:04:22,521 --> 02:04:23,960
It's like theater,
sex.

2911
02:04:24,890 --> 02:04:29,890
It was the beginnings of like figuring 
out the loophole between pornography and

2912
02:04:30,851 --> 02:04:35,210
then romantic movies with essentially no
plot.

2913
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:36,380
They could write the not like,
oh,

2914
02:04:36,381 --> 02:04:38,040
we're just going to get to.
We'll figure it out when

2915
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:39,000
we get there.
Uh,

2916
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:41,010
this is what I want you to do.
Look out the window.

2917
02:04:41,011 --> 02:04:43,740
Where's Bob fucking bar kit over here?
I'm horny.

2918
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:45,013
I'm Bob.
Bob Shows up in a yacht and that story 

2919
02:04:47,491 --> 02:04:48,600
to make it look like,
oh,

2920
02:04:48,601 --> 02:04:51,400
is this a TV show?
Because it's a TV shop.

2921
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:52,920
Gets off the boat.
I can't believe you're here.

2922
02:04:52,921 --> 02:04:54,240
I didn't know you were coming.
Yes,

2923
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:56,880
let's go get a drink.
And then they go into the next room.

2924
02:04:57,060 --> 02:04:58,620
Next thing is still,
they start making out.

2925
02:04:58,650 --> 02:04:59,850
I missed you so much.
I miss you too.

2926
02:04:59,851 --> 02:05:01,620
Have made some mistakes.
I'm so sorry.

2927
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:03,450
Next thing you know,
it's like,

2928
02:05:03,590 --> 02:05:04,830
I can't do this.
It's like,

2929
02:05:04,831 --> 02:05:05,281
well,
why not?

2930
02:05:05,281 --> 02:05:06,930
Just one night.
It's just one night.

2931
02:05:07,610 --> 02:05:09,360
All right.
Yeah,

2932
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:12,270
they smoke cigarettes in bed together 
back then.

2933
02:05:12,271 --> 02:05:15,370
Everybody smoked.
I never really got the cigarette.

2934
02:05:15,510 --> 02:05:18,130
Cigarette after six post fuck thing.

2935
02:05:18,330 --> 02:05:20,000
People like to smoke.
Yeah.

2936
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:22,500
You don't get it because you don't like,
I don't like to smoke.

2937
02:05:22,530 --> 02:05:23,490
No,
never smoked.

2938
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:24,750
No.
Good for you.

2939
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:27,390
My parents did stupid hobby.
I know.

2940
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:28,710
It's a tough one,
man.

2941
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:29,700
Yeah,
I get it.

2942
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:33,420
My mom quit cold Turkey Turkey though.
Thirteen years ago.

2943
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:34,860
Good for her.
She's 80 now.

2944
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:36,540
Jesus.
She.

2945
02:05:36,541 --> 02:05:37,530
Okay.
Yeah.

2946
02:05:37,590 --> 02:05:38,423
How long have you smoked for?
She smoked like probably sensor like 

2947
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:42,760
late teens.
See,

2948
02:05:42,761 --> 02:05:45,270
that's what every long term smoker.
They hear that story.

2949
02:05:45,271 --> 02:05:48,120
They go along as I just know when to 
jump off this ride.

2950
02:05:48,750 --> 02:05:49,583
I'm going to be okay.
Remember those bugs bunny movies were 

2951
02:05:51,781 --> 02:05:52,614
playing.
Was about to crash right before the 

2952
02:05:53,611 --> 02:05:55,530
plane hit the ground bugs bunny would 
just hop off.

2953
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:56,393
Yes.
And it plane would crash and you'd be 

2954
02:05:57,151 --> 02:05:57,984
like,
fine.

2955
02:05:58,650 --> 02:06:00,630
I love that.
That's what it is.

2956
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:03,010
That's what your mom did was like,
fuck,

2957
02:06:03,150 --> 02:06:03,630
I'm okay.

2958
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:05,820
Yeah,
I'm done.

2959
02:06:06,860 --> 02:06:08,320
Well that was fun.
That was it.

2960
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:10,950
I mean,
no one people die of cancer.

2961
02:06:10,951 --> 02:06:13,620
Like from lung cancer,
like weight quicker than that.

2962
02:06:14,190 --> 02:06:15,060
Oh yeah.
My Dad.

2963
02:06:15,061 --> 02:06:16,250
That's when my dad died from.
Boy,

2964
02:06:16,251 --> 02:06:17,120
he,
he,

2965
02:06:17,121 --> 02:06:19,500
he had heart trouble first and then he 
had um,

2966
02:06:19,710 --> 02:06:22,720
like a bunch of heart surgeries because 
he was like,

2967
02:06:22,770 --> 02:06:24,720
had like a high salt,
he wasn't overweight,

2968
02:06:24,721 --> 02:06:25,554
he was thin,
so it's like one of those thin fat type 

2969
02:06:27,661 --> 02:06:30,690
of patients.
So he's have just a genetic issue.

2970
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:33,510
I don't know what it was,
it was just like some kind of like build

2971
02:06:33,620 --> 02:06:35,760
up because he was a smoker,
is a heavy smoker.

2972
02:06:36,060 --> 02:06:38,580
He ate kind of heavy food,
salty,

2973
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:42,150
whatever and um,
and it just added up and then he got,

2974
02:06:42,300 --> 02:06:45,990
he got heart problems than emphysema,
emphysema turned to lung cancer.

2975
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:49,790
And then my mom,
like last year she,

2976
02:06:49,870 --> 02:06:53,310
she discovered she only had like 18 
percent functionality or no,

2977
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:54,993
like 13 percent functionality of her 
heart and I just happened to be in 

2978
02:06:59,371 --> 02:07:01,950
Montana at the time because I don't have
brothers and sisters and I just happened

2979
02:07:01,951 --> 02:07:02,784
to be there with a friend of mine for 
Christmas and it happened the day after 

2980
02:07:05,431 --> 02:07:06,264
Christmas.

2981
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:07,253
So she was like,
I really don't feel well today to the 

2982
02:07:08,611 --> 02:07:09,151
hospital.
They're like,

2983
02:07:09,151 --> 02:07:09,984
yeah,
you've got barely any coronary 

2984
02:07:12,961 --> 02:07:17,400
functionality right now.
And so then they put in to a two stents,

2985
02:07:17,401 --> 02:07:19,380
but a third of her heart is not 
functioning.

2986
02:07:19,381 --> 02:07:21,360
One of the aorta just doesn't work 
anymore.

2987
02:07:22,140 --> 02:07:23,100
Pretty,
pretty heavy.

2988
02:07:23,101 --> 02:07:25,020
But a lot of it is from just like high 
fat,

2989
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:28,900
high set a high salt.
I'm smoking.

2990
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:30,213
Yeah.
You know,

2991
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:33,360
the thing is people used to think it was
high fat.

2992
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:35,860
Did you read that thing in the New York 
Times about where

2993
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:36,813
that all came from?
The reason why people think saturated 

2994
02:07:38,381 --> 02:07:40,190
fat is bad for you yet.
Well,

2995
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:41,033
I know that certain amounts of fats and 
certain fats are awesome for you on 

2996
02:07:43,820 --> 02:07:46,960
summer.
It all came from the New York Times.

2997
02:07:47,310 --> 02:07:49,060
I mean,
it all came from the sugar industry.

2998
02:07:49,150 --> 02:07:49,983
The sugar industry bribed all these 
scientists and they didn't even have to 

2999
02:07:52,451 --> 02:07:53,320
pay him much.
Man.

3000
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:58,560
Apparently it was only like $50,000.
They bribed these scientists to study,

3001
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:02,260
uh,
to report some bogus findings,

3002
02:08:02,770 --> 02:08:05,740
pushing the blame away from sugar and 
onto saturated fat.

3003
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:07,810
Oh,
history.

3004
02:08:07,950 --> 02:08:09,310
Yeah.
To this day,

3005
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:11,110
people think saturated fat is bad for 
you.

3006
02:08:11,111 --> 02:08:11,944
There's something that I tweeted earlier
today that I was reading about 

3007
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:17,500
saturated,
being able to even cholesterol.

3008
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:20,740
Cholesterol is the precursor.
It's like what you need.

3009
02:08:20,741 --> 02:08:22,990
It's a substrate for hormones.
Sure,

3010
02:08:22,991 --> 02:08:23,411
sure.
No,

3011
02:08:23,411 --> 02:08:24,930
absolutely,
but just saying like,

3012
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:27,430
there's so much of it.
There's so much.

3013
02:08:27,430 --> 02:08:29,600
Dietary cholesterol is not even a man.
Dire.

3014
02:08:29,610 --> 02:08:30,443
Taylor,
Terry cholesterol apparently doesn't 

3015
02:08:31,421 --> 02:08:33,850
even move your blood lipids.
A lot of it's genetic.

3016
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:35,013
It has to do with whether or not you 
have high cholesterol has to do with 

3017
02:08:37,180 --> 02:08:40,270
your lifestyle.
If you're a sedentary,

3018
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:41,730
yeah,
sure.

3019
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:42,633
A lot of sugar and carbs.
This is something that I posted earlier 

3020
02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:47,253
today.
Fat when fat people or rather when 

3021
02:08:48,311 --> 02:08:50,920
people eat saturated fat,
the risk of stroke drops.

3022
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:54,130
If they're also avoiding refined 
carbohydrates,

3023
02:08:54,131 --> 02:08:54,964
their triglycerides also come down,
so what they're saying is that when 

3024
02:08:58,691 --> 02:08:59,524
people eat saturated fat in conjunction 
with eating a lot of refined 

3025
02:09:04,001 --> 02:09:06,490
carbohydrates like white flour and 
sugar,

3026
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:11,820
it's not good for you at all.
So the that that saturated fat is bad is

3027
02:09:12,461 --> 02:09:13,294
the wrong culprit.
Like saturated fat might be bad for you 

3028
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:18,280
if you had refined carbohydrates because
you like.

3029
02:09:18,281 --> 02:09:19,990
You're just fucking your whole system 
up,

3030
02:09:20,290 --> 02:09:23,290
but if you can remove the refined 
carbohydrates,

3031
02:09:23,470 --> 02:09:24,303
saturated fat consumers have a lower 
risk of stroke and their triglycerides 

3032
02:09:29,171 --> 02:09:29,860
come down to the.

3033
02:09:29,860 --> 02:09:33,940
You actually get healthier by eating 
saturated fat without carbohydrates.

3034
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,980
That's totally makes sense.
It does make sense,

3035
02:09:35,981 --> 02:09:38,170
but this is all new shit,
man.

3036
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:39,483
These separated it that they.
It looks like they just kind of finally 

3037
02:09:41,921 --> 02:09:45,160
went like it's kind of true.
It's only true in combination.

3038
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:46,293
It's only true in combination,
but you extract the one that we know to 

3039
02:09:48,521 --> 02:09:49,354
be bad because there's many,
many studies right now showing that low 

3040
02:09:51,101 --> 02:09:51,934
carbohydrate diets are beneficial for a 
bunch of different total health 

3041
02:09:54,131 --> 02:09:54,964
benefits.
So when you take out these refined 

3042
02:09:57,071 --> 02:09:57,904
carbohydrates,
it turns out the saturated fat is good 

3043
02:09:59,381 --> 02:10:00,480
for you.
Haven't been.

3044
02:10:00,481 --> 02:10:02,290
We've known them for awhile.
I mean carbs.

3045
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:05,140
Refined carbs are not good.
I mean,

3046
02:10:05,141 --> 02:10:07,390
I look at it,
but we didn't know how bad they were.

3047
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:09,730
Oh yeah.
I think we're realizing now more how bad

3048
02:10:09,731 --> 02:10:10,564
they are and how important saturated fat
and unsaturated fats are and there's a 

3049
02:10:13,991 --> 02:10:16,630
lot of saturated fats even for plant 
based folks.

3050
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:19,030
You get a certain percentage of it from 
Avocados,

3051
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:21,910
I think you can get a little bit of it 
from coconut oil,

3052
02:10:21,970 --> 02:10:23,670
certain percentage of it from coconut 
oil.

3053
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:26,080
I think it's they're saying coconut.
That's bullshit.

3054
02:10:26,081 --> 02:10:28,390
A little bit of a thing was widely 
criticized by signing.

3055
02:10:28,620 --> 02:10:31,780
That was the hardest association wrote 
that and they.

3056
02:10:31,781 --> 02:10:33,920
These all these scientists got together 
in on.

3057
02:10:33,921 --> 02:10:34,040
It

3058
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:34,873
actually published an article about it 
where we sent essentially the American 

3059
02:10:37,461 --> 02:10:42,440
heart association is kind of whack.
Like their research is kind of Shitty,

3060
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:46,160
like too bad there are behind the times 
as it makes sense.

3061
02:10:46,620 --> 02:10:49,340
You have to be the cutting edge 
nutrition.

3062
02:10:49,341 --> 02:10:50,174
This is why it's so confusing.
It's constantly revolving around the 

3063
02:10:53,211 --> 02:10:54,044
latest science,
so if you're not using the latest 

3064
02:10:55,431 --> 02:10:58,160
science cutting edge new,
you're not using the latest cutting edge

3065
02:10:58,161 --> 02:10:58,994
in nutrition.
So if you're talking about some shit 

3066
02:10:59,931 --> 02:11:00,764
that they discovered the 19 seventies,
there's a bit of possibility that you 

3067
02:11:04,551 --> 02:11:06,770
might be wrong is tainted.
Yeah,

3068
02:11:06,771 --> 02:11:07,604
I mean that totally makes sense.
I mean that's something that I tend to 

3069
02:11:10,910 --> 02:11:11,660
fail.
You know,

3070
02:11:11,660 --> 02:11:14,780
my thing is like I just try to eat like 
what would a diabetic do,

3071
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:17,030
like that's a good,
that's a good starting place.

3072
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:19,280
And then the other thing is just like 
simplicity,

3073
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:20,620
you know,
like uh,

3074
02:11:20,830 --> 02:11:22,010
for me,
chicken breast,

3075
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:24,080
lean fish,
snapper,

3076
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:25,700
brown rice,
oatmeal,

3077
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:26,920
steam,
Broccoli,

3078
02:11:26,930 --> 02:11:30,220
steamed Kale,
I'm egg whites,

3079
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:31,220
egg white protein.

3080
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:34,130
But even egg whites,
egg whites are not nearly as healthy for

3081
02:11:34,131 --> 02:11:34,964
you.
Is Egg yolks?

3082
02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:36,283
Yolks are actually better for you.
It yolks have more protein in them 

3083
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:39,231
there.
There's a,

3084
02:11:39,231 --> 02:11:41,150
there's all sorts of vitamins that you 
get an egg,

3085
02:11:41,740 --> 02:11:43,630
you don't care about the powder,
you know,

3086
02:11:43,631 --> 02:11:44,464
like the more protein,
but a good percentage of the protein I 

3087
02:11:46,071 --> 02:11:47,510
should say.
And more cholesterol.

3088
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:50,180
The cholesterol is really the thing for 
me.

3089
02:11:50,181 --> 02:11:51,770
Like Jay,
you know Jay Robb,

3090
02:11:51,771 --> 02:11:52,341
egg,
white protein,

3091
02:11:52,341 --> 02:11:53,174
that stuff is so fucking crack.
It's great and it mixes really well if 

3092
02:11:55,521 --> 02:11:57,380
they think they could put the yolk in 
there.

3093
02:11:57,440 --> 02:12:00,680
I don't ever use plant based protein,
like pea protein is really good.

3094
02:12:01,540 --> 02:12:03,560
Pump protein if you have from a good 
source.

3095
02:12:03,650 --> 02:12:05,030
Yeah,
I've used all of those things.

3096
02:12:05,031 --> 02:12:10,010
I guess egg white is like the most 
easily one of the most easily absorbed,

3097
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:10,940
so,
um,

3098
02:12:10,940 --> 02:12:12,230
and it's just kind of simple.

3099
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:16,450
What I like about is that it's simple 
and it just comes from an unrefined ish,

3100
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:18,830
you know,
refined to get it to a powder.

3101
02:12:18,890 --> 02:12:21,440
Right.
But that's what I would say the issue is

3102
02:12:21,441 --> 02:12:23,660
in the dehydration,
dehydration process.

3103
02:12:23,661 --> 02:12:24,494
It's so different than with hamp where 
you're essentially just getting the 

3104
02:12:26,871 --> 02:12:31,190
plant fiber grind to get down to a fine 
powder and then you eat it.

3105
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:33,440
So it's super easy to digest.
It's almost like,

3106
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:34,553
like squeezed juice except for it's a 
dried plant versus a dehydrated liquid 

3107
02:12:38,871 --> 02:12:42,450
product to kind of liquidy,
right?

3108
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:42,811
Yeah,
yeah,

3109
02:12:42,811 --> 02:12:43,750
yeah.
Kind of.

3110
02:12:43,810 --> 02:12:44,541
Yeah,
I mean,

3111
02:12:44,541 --> 02:12:45,374
yeah,
I guess,

3112
02:12:45,410 --> 02:12:46,221
yeah,
I guess they are,

3113
02:12:46,221 --> 02:12:48,980
they start that way,
but if you cook them or.

3114
02:12:48,981 --> 02:12:50,270
I mean,
I guess you could have them raw.

3115
02:12:50,630 --> 02:12:51,730
Well you can,
if you've got,

3116
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:52,593
you know,
the source apparently catching 

3117
02:12:54,570 --> 02:12:56,390
salmonella though from backyard 
chickens.

3118
02:12:56,570 --> 02:12:57,560
Oh yeah,
that's a,

3119
02:12:57,561 --> 02:12:59,390
that is an issue now there's some far.

3120
02:12:59,450 --> 02:13:00,350
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3121
02:13:00,351 --> 02:13:01,970
Right.
And there was that huge movement.

3122
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:06,000
I'm like urban movement,
so people who are closer together,

3123
02:13:06,050 --> 02:13:07,190
be careful.
If you don't,

3124
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:08,540
you know,
know what's going on.

3125
02:13:08,541 --> 02:13:09,800
Don't,
don't eat it raw.

3126
02:13:09,890 --> 02:13:10,723
Just because you've got it in your 
backyard does not necessarily mean it's 

3127
02:13:13,011 --> 02:13:15,800
100 percent safety role.
Yeah.

3128
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:16,350
No,
I,

3129
02:13:16,350 --> 02:13:17,330
you know,
my thing is like,

3130
02:13:17,331 --> 02:13:20,270
I just need some pretty simply.
Do you eat fish?

3131
02:13:20,370 --> 02:13:21,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

3132
02:13:21,261 --> 02:13:22,094
What kind of fatty fish?
Like salmon supposed to be the best for 

3133
02:13:24,321 --> 02:13:25,460
you?
I do like salmon.

3134
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:28,640
I like Coho Salmon,
which is really good if you can.

3135
02:13:28,670 --> 02:13:29,503
And then um,
I like Hamachi how much he is just a 

3136
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:34,733
amazing macro.
I really dig mackerels great snappers 

3137
02:13:37,411 --> 02:13:40,450
really nice for like just like a nice 
lean piece of fish.

3138
02:13:40,460 --> 02:13:41,670
Like next one.
That basic.

3139
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:42,533
Do you ever go fishing?
I know you used to in Montana and grew 

3140
02:13:44,611 --> 02:13:45,270
up in Montana.

3141
02:13:45,270 --> 02:13:47,310
I used to fish a.
no,

3142
02:13:47,311 --> 02:13:49,590
not fly fish,
just like boat fish,

3143
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:51,590
fish,
Montana.

3144
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:52,470
Where were?
Yeah,

3145
02:13:52,470 --> 02:13:54,140
like lake a lake?
Yeah.

3146
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:56,430
I forget the.
Forget that.

3147
02:13:56,431 --> 02:13:59,490
Oh,
we went to a rainbow lake.

3148
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:03,120
I think rainbow,
like flat head sometimes.

3149
02:14:03,150 --> 02:14:05,550
We went to Bozeman last summer,
my family,

3150
02:14:05,551 --> 02:14:07,980
and we went whitewater rafting down in 
Gallatin.

3151
02:14:08,550 --> 02:14:09,420
It's amazing,
dude.

3152
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:12,120
You get soaked though.
If you're in the shade,

3153
02:14:12,121 --> 02:14:16,050
you're going to freeze your dick off.
That was glacial runoff.

3154
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:20,490
The only one of the few times I noticed 
between a shadow and not shadow.

3155
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:21,600
Yeah.
If you're in the sun,

3156
02:14:21,601 --> 02:14:22,050
you're like,
Aha,

3157
02:14:22,050 --> 02:14:23,070
it's perfect.
I'll dry off.

3158
02:14:23,071 --> 02:14:23,904
I'll be fine,
but if you're in the cold in the water 

3159
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:28,270
is cold,
man.

3160
02:14:28,271 --> 02:14:29,104
You're so fucked and you're just like,
take one step into the sunlight and 

3161
02:14:31,141 --> 02:14:33,660
you're like,
it's like breathing.

3162
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:34,583
That Galton's weird because there's a 
lot of people that fly fish in that 

3163
02:14:37,891 --> 02:14:38,724
gallatin river,
but almost everybody releases the fish 

3164
02:14:41,551 --> 02:14:42,384
that they catch.

3165
02:14:43,590 --> 02:14:44,411
Oh yeah,
yeah,

3166
02:14:44,411 --> 02:14:45,244
yeah.
I got you.

3167
02:14:45,390 --> 02:14:46,770
Yeah.
It's more like the sportsman.

3168
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:47,940
Yeah,
take on it.

3169
02:14:47,950 --> 02:14:51,570
Rather than just you just tricking this 
fish sticking out,

3170
02:14:51,590 --> 02:14:55,080
hook in his head and then you're pulling
it to shore and then let it go.

3171
02:14:55,170 --> 02:14:57,000
Letting it go.
Like how many times,

3172
02:14:57,001 --> 02:15:00,900
if this is like a stream or a lot of 
people on this river,

3173
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:01,853
if a lot of people fly fish,
what are the odds that a fish gets 

3174
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:09,870
caught and released?
Like several times and it's life man.

3175
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:10,913
That'd be something to ask.
Like you're getting a hook Jesus again 

3176
02:15:15,950 --> 02:15:16,890
or maybe like,
you know what?

3177
02:15:16,891 --> 02:15:18,960
I don't mind it because I'm still alive.
I don't know.

3178
02:15:20,730 --> 02:15:22,250
I think it would suck.
Yeah,

3179
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:24,180
don't think that they have nerve 
endings.

3180
02:15:24,510 --> 02:15:28,120
The in their mouth the way I think it's 
like the,

3181
02:15:28,170 --> 02:15:31,200
a lot of the tissue in their mouth other
than their throat is like,

3182
02:15:31,201 --> 02:15:32,790
I'm almost like a fingernail.

3183
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:35,360
I think it's the way I see.
Yeah,

3184
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:36,440
that makes sense.
Yeah.

3185
02:15:36,470 --> 02:15:38,040
I mean because that was the thing.
It's like I,

3186
02:15:38,670 --> 02:15:41,880
I love fish but I'm a little bit of a 
pussy about killing,

3187
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:42,913
you know?
And so I have to Kinda like get into a 

3188
02:15:44,551 --> 02:15:45,690
mindset,
you know,

3189
02:15:45,810 --> 02:15:47,280
to do it.
I mean I could,

3190
02:15:47,310 --> 02:15:48,950
I could do it if I needed to survive.
I need to cut.

3191
02:15:48,970 --> 02:15:51,120
Of course I'm going to eat.
I don't have a problem with that.

3192
02:15:51,180 --> 02:15:52,890
What about an ugly fish?
Like a flounder?

3193
02:15:53,310 --> 02:15:54,143
It doesn't matter.
I was the kid trying to not step on 

3194
02:15:57,310 --> 02:15:58,820
ants.
Right.

3195
02:15:59,050 --> 02:16:00,510
That was,
I was just like very much.

3196
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:01,373
Even though I do eat meat,
although I will say I'm really stoked 

3197
02:16:03,241 --> 02:16:05,250
about Memphis meats.
Memphis meats.

3198
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:06,240
Yeah.
Memphis meats.

3199
02:16:06,241 --> 02:16:10,290
They're out of San Francisco.
They're growing steaks and chicken.

3200
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:12,293
Now,
is that actual steak and actual chicken 

3201
02:16:13,591 --> 02:16:15,510
or is it a Vegan alternative from the 
cells?

3202
02:16:16,010 --> 02:16:18,110
The animals.
You're going to get a Zombie idea.

3203
02:16:18,150 --> 02:16:19,990
So yeah,
I mean something.

3204
02:16:20,010 --> 02:16:20,820
So it was good but,
but,

3205
02:16:20,820 --> 02:16:23,420
but I do think that it's an interesting 
thing because like,

3206
02:16:23,430 --> 02:16:26,070
I was Vegan for like seven years and now
I'm not.

3207
02:16:26,350 --> 02:16:28,180
Do you get people mad at you because of 
the,

3208
02:16:28,620 --> 02:16:29,453
you know,
I've gotten some people like I thought 

3209
02:16:30,131 --> 02:16:30,964
you were.
I thought you were a vegetarian or 

3210
02:16:32,050 --> 02:16:33,070
Vegan.
Are you open minded?

3211
02:16:33,071 --> 02:16:34,300
Man?
I thought you could.

3212
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,393
But the thing is like I do care and I am
pretty particular about the sources of 

3213
02:16:38,340 --> 02:16:40,420
protein.
I'm very particular,

3214
02:16:40,421 --> 02:16:41,254
but uh,
but I am excited about this idea of 

3215
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:45,080
because it,
it,

3216
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:46,053
it poses an interesting question to 
someone who's choosing to be Vegan for 

3217
02:16:50,650 --> 02:16:52,960
ethical reasons or health reasons or 
both.

3218
02:16:53,440 --> 02:16:56,530
Um,
if meat was able to be grown,

3219
02:16:57,340 --> 02:17:00,980
like saying that you liked me before you
became one you liked.

3220
02:17:01,010 --> 02:17:03,730
I liked it,
but I don't like the ethical reasons.

3221
02:17:03,731 --> 02:17:05,170
Make sense for health reasons.
Totally.

3222
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:07,060
I would feel like,
you know,

3223
02:17:07,061 --> 02:17:09,720
it's probably just as bad for you or 
worse unless,

3224
02:17:09,730 --> 02:17:12,820
unless you feel.
Unless you feel bad when you eat certain

3225
02:17:12,821 --> 02:17:13,840
things.
Not like emotionally,

3226
02:17:13,841 --> 02:17:16,330
but if you have a reaction to me,
some people do have,

3227
02:17:16,360 --> 02:17:18,360
that was fine.
The people to do,

3228
02:17:18,390 --> 02:17:19,223
you know,
that's a real common thing recently 

3229
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:23,440
about that lone star tick disease.
No.

3230
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:25,960
People getting allergic to meat.
There's some,

3231
02:17:26,170 --> 02:17:27,390
some weird.
Yeah.

3232
02:17:27,430 --> 02:17:30,070
Something that is in the bite of the 
tick,

3233
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:31,750
uh,
something called,

3234
02:17:32,020 --> 02:17:35,800
they call it Alpha Gal for short.
And when you get this,

3235
02:17:35,801 --> 02:17:39,400
you develop this allergy to this stuff 
that exists in red meat.

3236
02:17:39,670 --> 02:17:42,520
And so when people get bitten by this 
one particular tick,

3237
02:17:42,521 --> 02:17:46,690
they literally develop an allergy to red
meat and it can subside over time.

3238
02:17:47,110 --> 02:17:47,943
But for a lot of people they have to.
They stick to chicken and fish 

3239
02:17:50,321 --> 02:17:51,154
afterwards.
They literally become allergic to eat 

3240
02:17:52,410 --> 02:17:53,680
meat,
so they become healthier.

3241
02:17:53,681 --> 02:17:55,960
But I don't necessarily see that's where
the.

3242
02:17:55,990 --> 02:17:58,920
That's where the whole saturated fat 
argument comes into shirt.

3243
02:17:59,090 --> 02:18:03,520
I guess it depends on the Diet is 
there's all this confusion about whether

3244
02:18:03,521 --> 02:18:06,970
or not red meat is bad for you.
Because a lot of these studies that show

3245
02:18:06,971 --> 02:18:09,970
that there's a direct correlation 
between red meat and heart attacks.

3246
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:13,810
What they don't do is differentiate what
kind of red meat.

3247
02:18:13,870 --> 02:18:17,410
They don't make a differentiation 
between red meat that's grass fed,

3248
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:22,620
pasture raised cattle.
It's very healthy or bison versus a fast

3249
02:18:22,751 --> 02:18:23,584
food burger with a white bread,
buns and French fries and a soda with 

3250
02:18:27,671 --> 02:18:29,240
all sorts of sugar in it.
See,

3251
02:18:29,290 --> 02:18:30,123
because you.
Because the fact that people eat red 

3252
02:18:32,291 --> 02:18:33,124
meat on a daily basis,
they don't take into consideration what 

3253
02:18:35,381 --> 02:18:36,490
they eat that red meat with.

3254
02:18:36,490 --> 02:18:37,323
And there's a giant difference between 
eating a piece of grass fed meat with 

3255
02:18:40,571 --> 02:18:44,590
vegetables and water,
you know,

3256
02:18:44,591 --> 02:18:45,424
maybe a Yam versus eating a fucking 
Carl's junior double cheeseburger with 

3257
02:18:49,931 --> 02:18:54,931
fake bacon just dripping with funk and 
sugary,

3258
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:57,260
sugary sauces.
Yeah,

3259
02:18:57,290 --> 02:19:00,010
I mean you,
you can't make the people do.

3260
02:19:00,130 --> 02:19:03,490
And so the correlation between like,
it's not a good.

3261
02:19:03,830 --> 02:19:08,320
These are not good tests because the 
correlation between red meat and cancer,

3262
02:19:08,710 --> 02:19:10,870
you could say maybe,
maybe,

3263
02:19:10,871 --> 02:19:11,704
but not the way you guys showed it,
the way you guys showed it as just 

3264
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:18,340
eating red meat with a bunch of other 
shit versus eating red meat and living a

3265
02:19:18,341 --> 02:19:19,280
healthy life.
Yeah.

3266
02:19:19,300 --> 02:19:22,720
And eating with vegetables and having a 
what you would call a balanced diet.

3267
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:23,573
Yep.
You can't say that it's all the same 

3268
02:19:25,630 --> 02:19:27,070
because it's just not great.
I,

3269
02:19:27,350 --> 02:19:28,490
no,
I totally agree with that.

3270
02:19:28,491 --> 02:19:29,324
I mean for me the red meat is like,
I'll just feel better if I'm not eating 

3271
02:19:31,791 --> 02:19:32,624
it all the time and I just prefer 
chicken or whatever to to a lot of 

3272
02:19:35,181 --> 02:19:36,020
people have different.

3273
02:19:36,350 --> 02:19:38,300
They have different reactions to all 
kinds of things.

3274
02:19:38,720 --> 02:19:39,553
I know several people that have celiacs 
where they literally can't consume any 

3275
02:19:42,921 --> 02:19:43,754
bread.
I know a bunch of people that have that 

3276
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:46,093
and for those people,
everybody's obviously different than 

3277
02:19:47,601 --> 02:19:50,570
mine because mine,
if I eat bread,

3278
02:19:50,571 --> 02:19:55,100
I don't feel as good feed a big ass sub 
sub.

3279
02:19:55,400 --> 02:20:00,400
It feels great while it's going down for
an afternoon crash.

3280
02:20:01,430 --> 02:20:02,263
Sometimes it's,
it's hard to remember that because 

3281
02:20:04,101 --> 02:20:05,480
you're like,
well I just want the thing,

3282
02:20:05,930 --> 02:20:06,763
the difference between A.
I'm an in and out double double with a 

3283
02:20:09,471 --> 02:20:12,380
button versus protein style with the 
lettuce.

3284
02:20:12,470 --> 02:20:15,530
Yeah,
it's a different thing.

3285
02:20:15,590 --> 02:20:17,900
I completely agree.
I mean I'm,

3286
02:20:17,910 --> 02:20:19,060
you know,
for me it's like,

3287
02:20:19,970 --> 02:20:20,670
like,
you know,

3288
02:20:20,670 --> 02:20:21,503
feeling menial or something like that.
It's like really nice because it's like 

3289
02:20:23,390 --> 02:20:26,550
a very lean cut,
but blue cheese on the.

3290
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:27,913
I don't know about.

3291
02:20:28,150 --> 02:20:29,840
I don't know if I can go there.
I like,

3292
02:20:29,841 --> 02:20:32,570
I like the blue cheese for laymen.
Y'All,

3293
02:20:33,010 --> 02:20:38,000
you know Jamie's to white bread from 
Ohio.

3294
02:20:38,030 --> 02:20:41,240
They don't even know what blue cheeses 
over there turn into a cheeseburger.

3295
02:20:41,241 --> 02:20:42,074
Just leave.
They have no blue cheese with a little 

3296
02:20:45,740 --> 02:20:48,060
crumbled blue cheese with some fucking 
look at you.

3297
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:50,720
I'll tell you.
Here's the problem.

3298
02:20:50,750 --> 02:20:53,870
Honestly.
It also like Philemon,

3299
02:20:53,871 --> 02:20:56,510
Yana is a boring cut,
like a rib eyes.

3300
02:20:56,511 --> 02:20:57,344
The cut just like cooked in there and 
you get a fucking nice dark surface on 

3301
02:21:03,141 --> 02:21:03,974
the outside and yet slice and it's red 
in the middle and get a hunk of fat in 

3302
02:21:06,531 --> 02:21:07,364
your mouth.
So much better tasting than Philemon 

3303
02:21:10,931 --> 02:21:11,764
neon.
So I will not have blue cheese with a 

3304
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:13,800
ribeye.
I,

3305
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:15,200
I will,
I will say that,

3306
02:21:15,230 --> 02:21:17,900
uh,
at Pacific dining car and what they do,

3307
02:21:17,901 --> 02:21:20,500
but they make the most perfect related 
mean,

3308
02:21:20,501 --> 02:21:21,800
you know,
there's like nothing on it.

3309
02:21:21,860 --> 02:21:22,693
It's just just the steak.
But it is like the most flavor complex 

3310
02:21:26,570 --> 02:21:29,780
piece of meat to the downtown one or the
one that's downtown one.

3311
02:21:29,781 --> 02:21:31,640
See the downtown one is like 24 hours a 
day,

3312
02:21:31,641 --> 02:21:32,474
isn't it?
Yeah.

3313
02:21:32,510 --> 02:21:33,343
How is that possible?
So I get a steak at Pacific dining car 

3314
02:21:36,470 --> 02:21:38,090
downtown la at 4:00
in the morning.

3315
02:21:38,091 --> 02:21:39,110
You could,
I need to go?

3316
02:21:39,230 --> 02:21:41,660
Yeah.
We need to have like a post show,

3317
02:21:41,661 --> 02:21:43,790
Pacific dining car dinner.
Yeah.

3318
02:21:44,090 --> 02:21:44,900
These days.
Yeah,

3319
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:48,320
for sure as to the store because we're 
always going to these bullshit places to

3320
02:21:48,321 --> 02:21:49,130
eat.
Yeah.

3321
02:21:49,130 --> 02:21:50,980
That place,
that place rocks and I just.

3322
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:54,320
It's got that heritage server vibe to 
it.

3323
02:21:54,321 --> 02:21:56,270
It's really cool.
I dig that man.

3324
02:21:56,300 --> 02:21:57,560
Have you gone to the one in Santa 
Monica?

3325
02:21:58,070 --> 02:21:58,940
I have not,
no.

3326
02:21:59,000 --> 02:21:59,840
Excellent.
Is it?

3327
02:21:59,841 --> 02:22:00,680
They're both.
Excellent.

3328
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:03,950
Okay.
I'll take super old school steakhouse.

3329
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:05,593
Yeah.
There's something about that that like 

3330
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:08,480
when they have a relationship with the,
with the,

3331
02:22:08,600 --> 02:22:09,433
with the cattle farm or whatever,
but I will say I am excited about a 

3332
02:22:12,561 --> 02:22:13,610
grown steak.

3333
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:14,833
Right.
Are you excited about something when 

3334
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:18,270
something doesn't have to die ethically,
completely safe.

3335
02:22:18,330 --> 02:22:21,290
Clipping taste.
If it tastes as good as the original and

3336
02:22:21,291 --> 02:22:22,101
you're just like,
no,

3337
02:22:22,101 --> 02:22:23,600
I love,
I love both of these.

3338
02:22:23,601 --> 02:22:28,601
Then you would obviously I would choose 
the one that was just 100 percent.

3339
02:22:28,650 --> 02:22:29,280
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

3340
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:30,390
Just because like,
well,

3341
02:22:30,530 --> 02:22:32,160
just an efficiency.
I mean,

3342
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:33,740
you know,
get rid of the empathy,

3343
02:22:33,770 --> 02:22:34,603
the emotional thing,
but like even just for efficiency's 

3344
02:22:37,111 --> 02:22:38,170
sake,
like about this,

3345
02:22:38,220 --> 02:22:42,210
the saving the environment from methane,
methane that.

3346
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:43,073
Totally.
The problem is we don't need cows 

3347
02:22:44,071 --> 02:22:45,830
anymore.
We'll have to start marking those cows.

3348
02:22:45,860 --> 02:22:49,560
I know I fucked and just grow.
They're going to be like,

3349
02:22:49,561 --> 02:22:50,700
dear.
Oh yeah,

3350
02:22:51,090 --> 02:22:52,370
dude online,
true.

3351
02:22:52,590 --> 02:22:53,423
I'm a photo from his house in Long 
Island and he was saying that long 

3352
02:22:57,811 --> 02:23:01,240
island is just infested with deer and 
that they literally going in and giving,

3353
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:04,890
giving these,
these deer operations and they're,

3354
02:23:04,891 --> 02:23:05,870
they're,
yeah,

3355
02:23:05,880 --> 02:23:07,380
they're trying to remove their ovaries.

3356
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:10,440
They're giving them birth control pills 
and trying all these different ways.

3357
02:23:10,470 --> 02:23:12,210
Oh my goodness.
All these different proposals.

3358
02:23:12,390 --> 02:23:15,390
And even some places they hired snipers.
They're giving.

3359
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:18,520
They're trying to figure out what to do 
because there's no predators and there's

3360
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:20,820
just a fucking astounding number of 
deer.

3361
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:22,390
But that's,
you know,

3362
02:23:22,390 --> 02:23:23,300
it's,
it goes.

3363
02:23:23,310 --> 02:23:25,050
It's just human civilization.
Like we just,

3364
02:23:25,051 --> 02:23:27,510
it's a domino effect.
We keep like fucking sort of.

3365
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:29,520
But the real issue is just no predators.
I mean,

3366
02:23:29,521 --> 02:23:31,850
if they really want to hold,
if they released a bunch of wolves,

3367
02:23:31,851 --> 02:23:33,770
sure they take care of that.
I agree with.

3368
02:23:33,830 --> 02:23:34,663
That was a human decision,
you know what I'm saying that because 

3369
02:23:36,001 --> 02:23:38,670
those ecosystems work perfectly and then
we'd come in and we're like,

3370
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:41,980
I don't like those trees over there and 
a bird goes away and then like,

3371
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:45,420
that bird was responsible for this thing
and that blah blah blah blah blah.

3372
02:23:45,660 --> 02:23:47,820
And then I don't like wolves eat my 
kids.

3373
02:23:47,821 --> 02:23:48,654
I hate wolves.
I don't like the way they have sharp 

3374
02:23:49,921 --> 02:23:52,650
teeth out like it one bit and they don't
look very,

3375
02:23:52,710 --> 02:23:53,880
very friendly.
So.

3376
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,830
So whatever the reason.
But.

3377
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:58,040
So that's kind of what you get.
Yeah.

3378
02:23:58,400 --> 02:24:00,060
Really,
monkey with a perfect system.

3379
02:24:00,470 --> 02:24:01,303
Yeah.
But once you monkey with that perfect 

3380
02:24:02,431 --> 02:24:04,080
system,
once you monkeyed it out,

3381
02:24:04,140 --> 02:24:05,460
yeah,
you're responsible.

3382
02:24:05,461 --> 02:24:07,740
You just fucking deer everywhere.
Yeah.

3383
02:24:07,741 --> 02:24:10,410
You got to keep your lending.
I know you got to keep it running,

3384
02:24:10,411 --> 02:24:11,760
man.
For people live around there.

3385
02:24:11,770 --> 02:24:12,603
It's a huge pain in the ass because they
crashed into those things all the time 

3386
02:24:15,151 --> 02:24:20,151
now and you could die.
I've had friends at run into meese and a

3387
02:24:20,380 --> 02:24:23,790
moose.
Moose is run into a tree.

3388
02:24:23,850 --> 02:24:24,683
It's like,
it's like a tech stories of like some 

3389
02:24:26,821 --> 02:24:28,950
guy who had a pickup truck was going 
like,

3390
02:24:29,010 --> 02:24:30,270
oh no,
45,

3391
02:24:30,271 --> 02:24:31,104
something like that.

3392
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:32,153
Fifty hit a hit.
A Moose and the most just walked into 

3393
02:24:36,361 --> 02:24:39,200
the forest.
Probably broke a lot of shit,

3394
02:24:39,201 --> 02:24:41,280
but that shit,
but it walked away.

3395
02:24:41,281 --> 02:24:42,114
It'll probably,
hopefully he'll see the video on 

3396
02:24:44,461 --> 02:24:45,294
youtube.
Very recently of a guy hitting a moose 

3397
02:24:47,131 --> 02:24:49,920
on the highway in Canada and it launches
it into the air.

3398
02:24:50,130 --> 02:24:54,210
I mean launches it like the Musha steps 
out into the road and I'm boom,

3399
02:24:54,211 --> 02:24:56,160
this guy hits it with his car and the 
people that are filming,

3400
02:24:56,161 --> 02:24:57,480
it'll like,
oh shit,

3401
02:24:58,350 --> 02:25:03,350
just flying through the air.
Got fucking flying like 20,

3402
02:25:03,841 --> 02:25:06,030
30 feet through the air.
What happened to it?

3403
02:25:06,040 --> 02:25:09,420
That I don't know.
It's just a video that is.

3404
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:11,700
It might not have man.
I mean,

3405
02:25:11,910 --> 02:25:13,680
it might have been.
They're so tough.

3406
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:15,360
They're just,
here it is right here.

3407
02:25:15,400 --> 02:25:16,233
Me Sir.
Tough.

3408
02:25:16,390 --> 02:25:19,800
This guy's driving.
Oh my gosh.

3409
02:25:19,980 --> 02:25:21,930
Yeah.
That's not alive.

3410
02:25:22,350 --> 02:25:25,390
That looks like a deer more than most.
The other one that I saw honestly,

3411
02:25:25,391 --> 02:25:26,224
Jamie was different.
Maybe it's the same video from a 

3412
02:25:28,301 --> 02:25:29,920
different angle.
That's almost.

3413
02:25:30,370 --> 02:25:32,200
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

3414
02:25:32,201 --> 02:25:33,340
That's incredible.
That's dead.

3415
02:25:34,110 --> 02:25:34,943
He's just lying.
He gets scared and he's playing dead 

3416
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:39,190
because he doesn't want anybody up.
That was definitely dead.

3417
02:25:39,390 --> 02:25:41,140
Uh,
definitely dead.

3418
02:25:41,141 --> 02:25:41,974
And that car is Jack my five.
That's probably totaled a caved in bent 

3419
02:25:45,821 --> 02:25:48,280
frame.
That's just suck so bad.

3420
02:25:48,490 --> 02:25:48,821
Well,
they,

3421
02:25:48,821 --> 02:25:51,260
you know,
it's some place like in Idaho,

3422
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:54,010
Montana where they have those 
underpasses are those overpasses,

3423
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:56,610
which is pretty great to help the 
animals nature.

3424
02:25:56,620 --> 02:25:58,350
I always,
I think that's so,

3425
02:25:58,450 --> 02:26:00,610
I mean there's like so many things we 
could do.

3426
02:26:00,611 --> 02:26:04,030
Obviously it's resource intensive and 
whether people agree with it or not,

3427
02:26:04,031 --> 02:26:07,720
but we could totally be in harmony with 
things for guns.

3428
02:26:07,810 --> 02:26:08,830
You don't have time for that.

3429
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:10,980
You're right.
You're doing that on our,

3430
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:14,860
our Tuesday a project to do that on the 
one on one for mountain lions.

3431
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:15,790
Oh yeah,
yeah,

3432
02:26:15,800 --> 02:26:16,720
yeah.
They should do.

3433
02:26:16,721 --> 02:26:17,554
Apparently the genetic diversity of the 
mountain lions is threatened by the one 

3434
02:26:19,441 --> 02:26:23,320
on one because there's mountain lions on
the ocean side and they're like breeding

3435
02:26:23,321 --> 02:26:24,970
too much with the mountain lions over 
there,

3436
02:26:25,930 --> 02:26:26,763
too hard for them to get across to 
[inaudible] to find all the mountain 

3437
02:26:29,021 --> 02:26:34,021
lions on this side as you go deep into 
like I'm Simi Valley and those areas.

3438
02:26:35,740 --> 02:26:39,190
So apparently they're trying to figure 
out some way to mitigate that and one of

3439
02:26:39,191 --> 02:26:40,024
the best ideas is really wide strip of 
land so these things feel comfortable 

3440
02:26:44,230 --> 02:26:45,063
and again to like pave it.
I mean they're gonna like put dirt in 

3441
02:26:47,351 --> 02:26:49,300
there and yeah,
I've seen those.

3442
02:26:49,330 --> 02:26:51,190
They look great too.
It's a shit load of money.

3443
02:26:51,550 --> 02:26:52,383
Yeah.
But you know what they need to do that 

3444
02:26:53,171 --> 02:26:54,380
shit.
I mean it's like,

3445
02:26:54,381 --> 02:26:56,650
you know,
if we have enough shit humans already,

3446
02:26:56,651 --> 02:27:01,120
like even even some of us,
I mean minus mental problems,

3447
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:06,340
mental issues,
it's like we have so much.

3448
02:27:06,341 --> 02:27:07,130
It's just,
it's,

3449
02:27:07,130 --> 02:27:08,770
it's crazy.
Even when I was like,

3450
02:27:08,771 --> 02:27:11,080
I mean I was never like destitute,
but I was definitely very,

3451
02:27:11,081 --> 02:27:11,914
very poor and wasn't sure if I would 
make rent or had to borrow a lot of 

3452
02:27:15,161 --> 02:27:17,350
money for,
for a few years and things like that.

3453
02:27:18,570 --> 02:27:20,590
But then you just realize how much you 
have.

3454
02:27:20,620 --> 02:27:23,800
Like I mean if your risk,
if you're in comparison in comparison,

3455
02:27:23,801 --> 02:27:24,634
like I can always find water.
I could always find water and if I was 

3456
02:27:27,431 --> 02:27:31,180
social enough I could definitely gain 
the trust of people to be able to let me

3457
02:27:31,181 --> 02:27:32,530
crash for awhile on a,
on a,

3458
02:27:32,650 --> 02:27:33,483
on a couch.

3459
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:37,600
So there was always a way to survive 
even if there are little things.

3460
02:27:37,660 --> 02:27:38,493
So I.
The reason why I bring that up is just 

3461
02:27:39,761 --> 02:27:42,830
because like nature to kind of our job 
to be stewards of,

3462
02:27:43,070 --> 02:27:45,250
of nature,
it should be better at it.

3463
02:27:45,310 --> 02:27:48,730
It certainly isn't a lot of ways we 
certain Julie should be responsible.

3464
02:27:48,731 --> 02:27:53,731
That's why it should be so much more of 
a big deal when something like some sort

3465
02:27:53,801 --> 02:27:57,990
of a company pollutes a bay or a no shit
like that is.

3466
02:27:58,350 --> 02:27:59,183
It is such a giant deal,
you can't like gloss over it with a 

3467
02:28:01,571 --> 02:28:03,800
clean up.
What you've done is like Devin,

3468
02:28:03,820 --> 02:28:06,670
like that whole thing that happened with
bp and the oil spill in the Gulf.

3469
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,700
Like they devastated an entire 
ecosystem.

3470
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:13,330
I mean that all the people that relied 
on that area for fishing,

3471
02:28:13,650 --> 02:28:14,483
all that and then the people that live 
nearby and then the people that had a 

3472
02:28:16,901 --> 02:28:19,990
clean it apparently the people that had 
to clean up their own brain cancer.

3473
02:28:21,070 --> 02:28:22,150
No,
no Bueno.

3474
02:28:22,330 --> 02:28:25,220
You've got to clean up gasoline.
Spill oil spill all day.

3475
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:27,590
That should be good for you.
Are you breathing that in?

3476
02:28:28,060 --> 02:28:30,140
Good.
What do you got over your face?

3477
02:28:30,141 --> 02:28:30,974
Like one of them fucking three m,
three m mask and then paper masks that 

3478
02:28:34,881 --> 02:28:35,714
should be sufficient.
Definitely is going to filter out all 

3479
02:28:37,401 --> 02:28:39,290
the toxins that are going to get into 
your DNA.

3480
02:28:39,350 --> 02:28:41,840
So terrible man.
I mean,

3481
02:28:41,841 --> 02:28:42,674
you know,
as much of deep water horizon oil spill 

3482
02:28:44,601 --> 02:28:47,000
is disappeared because of bacteria.
Oh that's good.

3483
02:28:47,260 --> 02:28:48,960
Well they were eating microbes,
didn't they?

3484
02:28:49,100 --> 02:28:50,530
Didn't they?
They poured that on there,

3485
02:28:50,550 --> 02:28:51,383
didn't.
They was like one of the thing that's 

3486
02:28:52,311 --> 02:28:55,100
some new shit they're going to use 
actually for plastic as well.

3487
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:57,580
Chemicals used to disperse it to kept 
underwater.

3488
02:28:57,700 --> 02:29:02,060
Making it more available to the microbes
that live in the deeper portions,

3489
02:29:02,061 --> 02:29:03,850
the ocean.
What's up with all those facebook things

3490
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:04,750
like right in front of it.

3491
02:29:04,930 --> 02:29:09,410
It just like an issue with the a website
called Shitty shitty coding.

3492
02:29:09,411 --> 02:29:11,870
CNBC.
Fox.

3493
02:29:11,871 --> 02:29:12,860
You've seen them.
We see.

3494
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:14,293
That's amazing.
I just love when someone super smart 

3495
02:29:17,150 --> 02:29:19,760
figures out a giant issues we have with 
something simple.

3496
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:20,930
Yeah.
No microbes.

3497
02:29:20,931 --> 02:29:23,450
Microbes can make oil or fungus.
Fungus.

3498
02:29:23,550 --> 02:29:25,640
Fungus is great.
Fungus gets rid of oil,

3499
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:26,533
but meanwhile those microbes are going 
to get eaten by fish and those fish are 

3500
02:29:29,421 --> 02:29:32,630
going to become huge and they're going 
to start thinking through and they go,

3501
02:29:32,660 --> 02:29:34,700
I'm tired of these motherfuckers coming 
in and killing us.

3502
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:37,010
We got to go out there and kill them.
I hope so.

3503
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:41,300
I don't.
I mean if they tried to really fuck with

3504
02:29:41,301 --> 02:29:42,290
us,
that'd be good.

3505
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:43,273
If there's like a new blue,
go to war with the fish and feel good 

3506
02:29:45,051 --> 02:29:46,340
about eating them.
Maybe.

3507
02:29:46,910 --> 02:29:48,830
What does this bacteria are evolving to 
eat?

3508
02:29:48,831 --> 02:29:51,000
Plastic we dump into the ocean.
Whoa.

3509
02:29:51,140 --> 02:29:54,230
Through evolving to do it without us 
doing it.

3510
02:29:54,590 --> 02:29:55,423
That's not good.
We're going to make an alien man like 

3511
02:29:57,081 --> 02:29:59,840
the movie alien.
Like the guard Geiger Alien.

3512
02:29:59,930 --> 02:30:01,860
Yeah.
You mean the xenomorph more?

3513
02:30:01,910 --> 02:30:02,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

3514
02:30:02,801 --> 02:30:03,790
Do you see,
um,

3515
02:30:04,050 --> 02:30:04,883
I posted this thing on instagram a 
couple of days ago that I saw from 

3516
02:30:07,140 --> 02:30:09,470
nature is metal,
the instagram account,

3517
02:30:09,710 --> 02:30:10,543
and it's a cuddle fish.
Have you ever seen how cuddle fish 

3518
02:30:12,021 --> 02:30:14,090
Jack's other fish?
No.

3519
02:30:14,810 --> 02:30:17,360
Spirit watch this.
It doesn't even seem real.

3520
02:30:17,390 --> 02:30:18,223
Look at that.

3521
02:30:21,860 --> 02:30:22,693
It's like an underwater frog,
but the way it opens up like a flower 

3522
02:30:26,001 --> 02:30:28,850
and put this thing into it.
I mean this is incredible at it.

3523
02:30:28,851 --> 02:30:29,684
Stabs it and then it's so cool.
It's such a great system because it's 

3524
02:30:33,641 --> 02:30:36,530
like,
it keeps it close to stay in camouflage.

3525
02:30:36,570 --> 02:30:37,403
Yeah.
And then it only opens it last second 

3526
02:30:39,740 --> 02:30:44,740
and probably maybe the color.
Mesmer as the CND and enemies.

3527
02:30:46,160 --> 02:30:50,060
It literally takes on the shape and 
texture of the sea and enemies.

3528
02:30:50,090 --> 02:30:51,050
That's amazing.
The,

3529
02:30:51,060 --> 02:30:53,630
the amount of camouflaged it has this 
insane.

3530
02:30:53,950 --> 02:30:56,210
There's somehow or another,
I guess related to octopus,

3531
02:30:56,540 --> 02:30:57,373
we can,
which many of the activists can do the 

3532
02:30:58,281 --> 02:30:58,990
same thing.
Yeah,

3533
02:30:58,990 --> 02:30:59,300
yeah,
yeah.

3534
02:30:59,300 --> 02:31:01,520
The change gear.
The camouflage thing is insane.

3535
02:31:01,550 --> 02:31:04,040
I mean nature is like way more advanced 
than we'll ever that.

3536
02:31:04,050 --> 02:31:06,000
I mean what we are in nature,
but um,

3537
02:31:06,470 --> 02:31:09,200
but it's just like from our point of 
view,

3538
02:31:09,201 --> 02:31:10,034
looking at nature,
which is just like an evolution of its 

3539
02:31:12,850 --> 02:31:13,450
molecular.

3540
02:31:13,450 --> 02:31:16,910
Meanwhile the octopus is like,
what the fuck are you complaining about?

3541
02:31:16,911 --> 02:31:18,020
Dude?
You have a phone.

3542
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:19,620
Okay.
You can fly on a plane.

3543
02:31:19,880 --> 02:31:23,220
You're pitching that you can't turn into
like you look like a coral reef.

3544
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:24,473
Nobody gives a fuck.
Is that a cuddle fish right there 

3545
02:31:25,381 --> 02:31:29,190
pretending to be a coral reef.
So mine isn't crab crab.

3546
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:32,230
What are they feeding?
A crab grass.

3547
02:31:32,310 --> 02:31:34,620
Oh whoa.
Look at that fucker.

3548
02:31:35,620 --> 02:31:36,453
That's amazing.
What a weird look and freaky alien 

3549
02:31:39,330 --> 02:31:41,750
creature and I love it's propulsion 
system is great.

3550
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:45,030
Just undulates signed.
It's so cool.

3551
02:31:45,150 --> 02:31:47,250
It's just.
I love it.

3552
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:49,950
I love the.
I also really love spiders.

3553
02:31:50,170 --> 02:31:52,870
Spiders or just to king of camouflage 
played that video,

3554
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:57,030
that king of camouflage the cuttlefish 
and cuddly looking.

3555
02:31:57,210 --> 02:31:59,860
They do have like a little smile to them
in these cute guys.

3556
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:03,320
They mean the same kind of cuddle.
I think it's cuddle with a Ct.

3557
02:32:03,400 --> 02:32:04,170
No,
no.

3558
02:32:04,170 --> 02:32:05,760
That's what they meaNt.
What they meant.

3559
02:32:06,810 --> 02:32:10,260
Look at how it just becomes like 
whatever it's near.

3560
02:32:10,370 --> 02:32:14,600
Like when it sits down on stuff yet it's
so complicated.

3561
02:32:14,630 --> 02:32:17,150
It looks like other fish.
Oh,

3562
02:32:17,190 --> 02:32:19,260
that's a octopus.
Yeah.

3563
02:32:19,310 --> 02:32:22,020
Like look at this octopus as it's on the
ground in cephalopod.

3564
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:25,920
These things are just.
They've adapted so cool.

3565
02:32:25,950 --> 02:32:30,950
A way to fake it just,
it just so alien to us.

3566
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:32,820
And that's the thing about like,
oh my god,

3567
02:32:32,830 --> 02:32:33,663
look crazy.
Look at how it looks like the bottom of 

3568
02:32:36,901 --> 02:32:37,734
that thing that it's in.
It looks more like I'm cooler than 

3569
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:44,260
octopus face.
You knoW,

3570
02:32:44,490 --> 02:32:47,400
like you were talking about before about
the idea of aliens visiting us.

3571
02:32:47,401 --> 02:32:50,550
Like why would we think that they would 
look like us at all?

3572
02:32:50,730 --> 02:32:51,563
Oh yeah.
No,

3573
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:52,823
I mean to,
you know,

3574
02:32:52,860 --> 02:32:56,100
they could just be spheres of energy 
period and they're just like,

3575
02:32:56,101 --> 02:32:56,970
hey guys,
what's up?

3576
02:32:57,260 --> 02:33:00,300
Why do they have to have a language even
convey intent?

3577
02:33:00,330 --> 02:33:01,180
Well,
that's why I liked,

3578
02:33:01,190 --> 02:33:02,023
uh,
what was that movie that came out 

3579
02:33:02,370 --> 02:33:04,740
recently?
The alien.

3580
02:33:04,741 --> 02:33:05,221
Oh yeah,
yeah,

3581
02:33:05,221 --> 02:33:07,920
yeah.
The one up with the one that memory one,

3582
02:33:08,480 --> 02:33:09,313
which I wrote off at first.
Then I went back and watched it and 

3583
02:33:11,500 --> 02:33:13,230
that's pretty fucking what's it caLled 
again?

3584
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,960
Because I didn't like it.
I don't remember jeremy renner.

3585
02:33:15,990 --> 02:33:19,110
That guy stepped upon arrival.
Arrival.

3586
02:33:19,111 --> 02:33:19,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

3587
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:21,480
Arrival.
I really liked that.

3588
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:22,770
I liked it.
Eventually,

3589
02:33:23,130 --> 02:33:24,750
first sought when the girl died.
I was like,

3590
02:33:24,751 --> 02:33:26,580
get the fuck out of here.
You're not going to get me with this.

3591
02:33:27,010 --> 02:33:27,691
I know,
I know.

3592
02:33:27,691 --> 02:33:28,440
I know.
Yeah.

3593
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:29,910
And then like,
man,

3594
02:33:30,150 --> 02:33:31,320
that changed real quick.
Yeah,

3595
02:33:31,321 --> 02:33:33,110
it was very interesting.
It was like,

3596
02:33:33,570 --> 02:33:36,240
and they were something totally 
different,

3597
02:33:36,330 --> 02:33:37,190
you know?
Yes.

3598
02:33:37,390 --> 02:33:38,520
The way I feel,
it's like,

3599
02:33:38,910 --> 02:33:39,743
why would we assume that everything 
would be physical when we have things 

3600
02:33:42,241 --> 02:33:43,074
like wifi,
we have like literally all of the 

3601
02:33:45,691 --> 02:33:50,691
world's data coming to you on your phone
from space with zero connection.

3602
02:33:51,580 --> 02:33:53,310
You take that thing,
spin that phone around,

3603
02:33:53,430 --> 02:33:54,263
there's nothing physical connecting it.
So why wouldn't we assume that 

3604
02:33:56,791 --> 02:34:00,510
information travels from alien,
the alien like that?

3605
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:02,380
Why do they,
why do they need a language?

3606
02:34:02,580 --> 02:34:03,413
Do they need,
why do they need to be able to touch 

3607
02:34:05,551 --> 02:34:08,010
things and see things and feel things?
Yeah,

3608
02:34:08,070 --> 02:34:10,830
agree.
It might be information that might be an

3609
02:34:10,831 --> 02:34:12,130
alien.
That's why,

3610
02:34:12,140 --> 02:34:15,030
you know,
like when people talk about doing dmt or

3611
02:34:15,060 --> 02:34:16,230
you know,
or uh,

3612
02:34:16,290 --> 02:34:17,123
or even ketamine know,
like that kind of dissociative 

3613
02:34:19,230 --> 02:34:20,063
intelligences that people are 
intelligence has been lobbying on 

3614
02:34:23,481 --> 02:34:24,301
dissociated.
It was like that.

3615
02:34:24,301 --> 02:34:27,880
They feel around them like almost an 
insight and like intelligence.

3616
02:34:28,570 --> 02:34:30,730
That's what I think.
Like everything is just pure content.

3617
02:34:30,731 --> 02:34:33,270
It's just everything is consciousness 
around you all the time,

3618
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:35,860
all the time.
It's entirely possible.

3619
02:34:35,950 --> 02:34:36,551
I mean,
you know,

3620
02:34:36,551 --> 02:34:37,690
it's like that's what you are.

3621
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:39,270
So all we are is.
I mean,

3622
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:41,850
as far as we know are vibrating weird 
particles,

3623
02:34:41,851 --> 02:34:46,270
we just don't have the senses to deal 
with whatever the fuck else is around.

3624
02:34:46,510 --> 02:34:49,570
We have to deal with all our biological 
needs,

3625
02:34:49,640 --> 02:34:50,473
all of our imperatives,
what we need to concentrate on in order 

3626
02:34:52,301 --> 02:34:57,301
to stay functional as a flesh bag.
We're at division of consciousness.

3627
02:34:57,800 --> 02:35:00,670
We're literally lifeforms.
We are forms of life.

3628
02:35:00,700 --> 02:35:01,533
Well,
your body literally is an avatar for 

3629
02:35:02,591 --> 02:35:03,850
consciousness.
Oh yeah.

3630
02:35:04,230 --> 02:35:05,063
Movie.
That's what I call the biomechanical 

3631
02:35:07,151 --> 02:35:10,030
consciousness transport system.
That's a good name for it.

3632
02:35:10,250 --> 02:35:11,083
You want to talk to chicks?
I'm going to do is we're just going to 

3633
02:35:13,571 --> 02:35:16,990
get in the hot tub with our biological 
transport,

3634
02:35:17,670 --> 02:35:21,880
so containment vehicles whenever,
whenever something deal to hot tub.

3635
02:35:21,881 --> 02:35:22,671
It feels good.
Yeah.

3636
02:35:22,671 --> 02:35:23,504
You know,
constantly over here and you sit over 

3637
02:35:25,391 --> 02:35:26,530
there.
So some,

3638
02:35:26,531 --> 02:35:27,364
uh,
some,

3639
02:35:27,460 --> 02:35:29,890
some women would take that and be like,
yeah,

3640
02:35:29,950 --> 02:35:32,140
that's cool.
And then you're like,

3641
02:35:32,150 --> 02:35:33,120
yeah,
yeah.

3642
02:35:33,220 --> 02:35:35,100
Girls with tattoos,
like right above their taste.

3643
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:37,450
They wouLd go for that.
They'd be like,

3644
02:35:37,451 --> 02:35:38,830
yeah,
I like what you're saying.

3645
02:35:39,330 --> 02:35:41,980
if he made me feel good about my choice,
a dig it.

3646
02:35:42,210 --> 02:35:44,620
Thanks man.
You want some of this joint,

3647
02:35:45,610 --> 02:35:47,080
if you have a hairdo like yours,
man,

3648
02:35:47,081 --> 02:35:47,914
you can pull that kind of talk off.
Although that fat jewish guys made that 

3649
02:35:51,581 --> 02:35:52,414
haircut a little fucked up.
That guy's kinda like tapped into it in 

3650
02:35:54,431 --> 02:35:55,264
a way.
It's.

3651
02:35:55,470 --> 02:35:57,670
Yeah.
Coming to change,

3652
02:35:57,671 --> 02:35:59,580
man.
Come and issue a strange man.

3653
02:36:03,090 --> 02:36:07,720
The guy guy debord on your shirt who's 
guide to board to board.

3654
02:36:10,390 --> 02:36:11,740
I don't care anymore.
He started.

3655
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:13,130
Yeah,
fuck this.

3656
02:36:14,180 --> 02:36:16,600
It's the guy who started the 
situationists.

3657
02:36:16,660 --> 02:36:17,493
They were kind of like a philosophical 
artistic movement in the fifties in 

3658
02:36:22,420 --> 02:36:26,720
french.
And they got a basically credit.

3659
02:36:26,730 --> 02:36:27,563
it was kind of like data ism mixed with 
like some different artists like 

3660
02:36:31,990 --> 02:36:32,823
artistic techniques and some philosophy,
but they would do these exercises to 

3661
02:36:35,741 --> 02:36:39,970
kind of shake their orientation like 
they love disorientation.

3662
02:36:39,971 --> 02:36:40,960
So they would,
uh,

3663
02:36:40,990 --> 02:36:41,823
you know,
drink a bunch of absent and walk around 

3664
02:36:44,141 --> 02:36:46,900
their town light and act like a group of
them would like,

3665
02:36:46,901 --> 02:36:49,780
act like they were tourists in their own
town and they would look.

3666
02:36:49,990 --> 02:36:53,950
They would navigate by looking up at the
buildings as opposed to a street level.

3667
02:36:54,220 --> 02:36:56,050
So they would do things like that or 
take maps,

3668
02:36:56,080 --> 02:36:59,920
tourist maps of other cities and 
superimpose them block for block,

3669
02:37:00,010 --> 02:37:03,850
like on another city,
or they did jokes like we are,

3670
02:37:03,860 --> 02:37:04,693
we're like kind of bits where one guy 
dressed as a bishop and actually lead a 

3671
02:37:08,351 --> 02:37:12,070
sermon at a.
I'm a notre dam and a

3672
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:13,900
don't ever say that again,

3673
02:37:16,790 --> 02:37:19,490
frank.
They were like pranksters.

3674
02:37:19,491 --> 02:37:20,324
They were like,
kind of like sticky notes with them 

3675
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,020
there.
and they were credited.

3676
02:37:24,021 --> 02:37:27,540
Malcolm mclaren was a,
It was a situationist and uh,

3677
02:37:27,590 --> 02:37:32,390
he created kind of partially created the
sex pistols as living mannequins for his

3678
02:37:32,391 --> 02:37:33,520
fashion.
Oh wow.

3679
02:37:33,521 --> 02:37:34,354
So the punk movement is kind of 
associated with situationist because 

3680
02:37:37,371 --> 02:37:38,750
they,
their whole mantra.

3681
02:37:38,810 --> 02:37:40,310
I mean,
it's a distillation,

3682
02:37:40,311 --> 02:37:43,610
but it's like a provoked to the edge of 
violence.

3683
02:37:43,700 --> 02:37:44,890
Whoa.
No,

3684
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:46,220
that's,
that's interesting.

3685
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:47,870
Was there ever a documentary on these 
guys?

3686
02:37:48,290 --> 02:37:49,460
There might be.
I've never,

3687
02:37:49,461 --> 02:37:52,340
I've never found one was just like,
there's the society of the spectacle,

3688
02:37:52,341 --> 02:37:54,830
which is one of the books that he wrote.
And there's like twO,

3689
02:37:54,950 --> 02:37:55,783
two books that he,
that he wrote did boards the society of 

3690
02:37:58,371 --> 02:37:59,580
the spectacle.
Yeah.

3691
02:37:59,870 --> 02:38:00,890
Interesting.
Yes,

3692
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:02,570
self will self takes a walk

3693
02:38:02,600 --> 02:38:03,890
through the.
How do you say that,

3694
02:38:04,640 --> 02:38:06,460
ben?
Ben.

3695
02:38:06,570 --> 02:38:11,140
When ben news of patty,
uh,

3696
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:12,033
the been,
I think it's been used and used betty 

3697
02:38:15,070 --> 02:38:19,160
have belly and is astonished by the 
press events.

3698
02:38:19,190 --> 02:38:20,510
Is that the right way to say that?
Uh,

3699
02:38:20,511 --> 02:38:21,344
yeah.
Press events of a debord 1967 

3700
02:38:23,751 --> 02:38:24,584
masterpiece,
which so accurately describes the shit 

3701
02:38:26,901 --> 02:38:28,540
we're in.
Interesting.

3702
02:38:28,580 --> 02:38:29,413
Basically a society of the spectacle and
more fucking issues with the twitter 

3703
02:38:32,841 --> 02:38:34,610
thing showing up right there on the 
pictures.

3704
02:38:34,640 --> 02:38:36,320
The fuckers with Your browser son has

3705
02:38:36,650 --> 02:38:39,800
zoom in and it fucks with it,
which they probably have ad blockers and

3706
02:38:39,801 --> 02:38:40,500
all kinds of weird.
Oh,

3707
02:38:40,500 --> 02:38:42,730
that's probabLy what it is.
Maybe you've been hacked.

3708
02:38:42,740 --> 02:38:45,500
Son had a c,
k,

3709
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:46,990
d.
Anyways,

3710
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,580
that's who he is.
You know about that guy?

3711
02:38:49,700 --> 02:38:50,361
Yeah.
When I first,

3712
02:38:50,361 --> 02:38:52,100
when I first moved to New York,
I,

3713
02:38:52,400 --> 02:38:53,233
a friend of mine and a performance 
artist took me to this experimental 

3714
02:38:55,131 --> 02:38:58,790
theater that was in a garage and 
williamsburg like way back who was still

3715
02:38:58,791 --> 02:38:59,624
pretty shitty city cd.
And you walk into the garage and they 

3716
02:39:02,601 --> 02:39:05,730
had this theater piece on [inaudible] 
board and uh,

3717
02:39:06,410 --> 02:39:07,243
it was amazing as soon as it,
because they kind of explained what it 

3718
02:39:09,861 --> 02:39:11,510
was about and the journey and blah,
blah blah.

3719
02:39:11,511 --> 02:39:14,480
But it was also done in a style that 
would have been situation.

3720
02:39:14,500 --> 02:39:15,333
So we were just like on these boards 
that we're on top of buckets for seats 

3721
02:39:20,120 --> 02:39:21,020
for bleachers.

3722
02:39:21,020 --> 02:39:22,850
And then they were passing around like 
beers,

3723
02:39:22,940 --> 02:39:23,773
like,
so people were just drinking beers and 

3724
02:39:24,741 --> 02:39:25,574
watching this play.
And it was amazing and it really 

3725
02:39:28,461 --> 02:39:30,530
inspired me where I was like,
oh yeah,

3726
02:39:30,540 --> 02:39:31,640
I dig.
I like it.

3727
02:39:31,700 --> 02:39:33,020
I liked that pranking,
hacking,

3728
02:39:33,021 --> 02:39:34,730
social hacking.
It's nice.

3729
02:39:35,030 --> 02:39:35,863
Provoked to the point of violence,
violence for violence or annoying 

3730
02:39:40,551 --> 02:39:41,440
neighbor.
Yeah.

3731
02:39:41,810 --> 02:39:44,060
Basically.
BuT someone who's doing it on purpose,

3732
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:46,560
which is even more annoying,
super annoying.

3733
02:39:46,940 --> 02:39:47,990
More than just like,
oh,

3734
02:39:47,991 --> 02:39:49,370
he's an annoying person.
So I don't know,

3735
02:39:49,371 --> 02:39:52,010
this person's doing it on purpose.
Like andy kaufman,

3736
02:39:52,550 --> 02:39:53,810
situationist.
Yeah.

3737
02:39:54,140 --> 02:39:56,870
He wouldn't necessarily maybe have 
described himself as that,

3738
02:39:56,871 --> 02:39:58,430
but that's,
he's a perfect example of that.

3739
02:39:58,431 --> 02:40:01,760
Or andy warhol more kaufman,
right?

3740
02:40:01,761 --> 02:40:04,010
Because warhol was just creating art.
Well yeah,

3741
02:40:04,011 --> 02:40:04,844
buT his whole like a con artist kind of 
vibe whether he would have ascribed to 

3742
02:40:09,180 --> 02:40:11,720
or not,
but the fact that he was kind of causing

3743
02:40:11,721 --> 02:40:12,780
a little bit,
you know,

3744
02:40:12,781 --> 02:40:16,140
that handled the campbell soup soup 
campaign is a little bit of a con.

3745
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:18,810
It was a little bit,
but people enjoyed looking at it.

3746
02:40:19,140 --> 02:40:20,580
They did,
but it started.

3747
02:40:20,680 --> 02:40:23,620
It's kind of like when I see it,
I'm like,

3748
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:24,473
ah,
that's a little bit of a con in the 

3749
02:40:26,221 --> 02:40:27,600
factory idea,
you know,

3750
02:40:27,640 --> 02:40:29,760
um,
is also a little bit of a con.

3751
02:40:29,761 --> 02:40:31,350
It's a little bit of a,
of a hack.

3752
02:40:31,380 --> 02:40:32,550
I mean,
in a conscious,

3753
02:40:32,610 --> 02:40:34,980
really intelligent,
philosophical way.

3754
02:40:35,330 --> 02:40:37,640
It's not to say that he's really trying 
to fool it.

3755
02:40:37,641 --> 02:40:41,610
It's not that he's just like this and 
people are like,

3756
02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:44,730
yes,
I like it.

3757
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:46,080
And he's like,
that's what I thought.

3758
02:40:46,590 --> 02:40:47,520
Right,
right.

3759
02:40:47,630 --> 02:40:52,630
A little weird when like people push 
back against someone trying to push what

3760
02:40:52,701 --> 02:40:55,460
they think is too far.
Like I'm like the,

3761
02:40:55,461 --> 02:40:59,060
they become these big cultural arguments
as to what's art and what's not.

3762
02:40:59,061 --> 02:41:02,210
Especially when things are funded,
like do you remember piss christ?

3763
02:41:02,690 --> 02:41:04,450
Do you remember all that?
You don't remember that.

3764
02:41:04,880 --> 02:41:05,780
That was,
um,

3765
02:41:06,200 --> 02:41:07,640
scott dammit.
What was his name?

3766
02:41:07,641 --> 02:41:12,641
I was just starting out doing stand up.
So it was the late eighties.

3767
02:41:12,920 --> 02:41:14,120
God,
what is his name?

3768
02:41:14,450 --> 02:41:16,010
What was his name?
Okay.

3769
02:41:16,030 --> 02:41:18,290
Wasn't that one I was thinking of.
There was a,

3770
02:41:18,291 --> 02:41:19,570
that was one.
It was a p,

3771
02:41:19,580 --> 02:41:24,380
there was another guy,
there was another guy who was famous for

3772
02:41:24,381 --> 02:41:26,930
that kind of shit.
God dammit.

3773
02:41:27,560 --> 02:41:28,393
very controversial artist who did a lot 
of like weird sexual and odd stuff in 

3774
02:41:34,761 --> 02:41:36,950
like the late eighties,
early nineties.

3775
02:41:36,951 --> 02:41:41,020
And it became a huge issue because 
people were mad that it,

3776
02:41:41,390 --> 02:41:44,990
some of it was being funded and put up 
in museums that were state funded.

3777
02:41:45,530 --> 02:41:46,610
oh,
interesting.

3778
02:41:47,050 --> 02:41:48,530
Got damaged.
It's at the tip of my tongue.

3779
02:41:48,531 --> 02:41:50,990
I can't remember this guy's name,
but these are like pieces of art,

3780
02:41:51,050 --> 02:41:52,640
like art works.
Yeah.

3781
02:41:52,910 --> 02:41:56,030
And piss christ was one of them.
What piss christ was,

3782
02:41:56,031 --> 02:41:56,864
was a,
a jar of pis with a crucifix in it and 

3783
02:41:59,061 --> 02:42:00,230
it was on display in a museum.
Oh,

3784
02:42:00,231 --> 02:42:01,270
I do remember thAt.
Yeah,

3785
02:42:01,290 --> 02:42:03,930
people were like,
what in the fuck is this?

3786
02:42:05,070 --> 02:42:10,070
And they called it piss christ and 
people would travel from all over.

3787
02:42:10,351 --> 02:42:10,400
Yeah.
Oh,

3788
02:42:10,400 --> 02:42:14,280
the world to go stare at pittsburgh.
It was the audacity,

3789
02:42:14,281 --> 02:42:15,114
right?
Part of it is the audacity to just do 

3790
02:42:16,651 --> 02:42:19,110
something like that and just be like 
cool with it.

3791
02:42:19,440 --> 02:42:20,273
I mean that's my favorite art is like 
one of my favorite moments and kind of 

3792
02:42:23,941 --> 02:42:26,960
discovering that was when I was going to
quit.

3793
02:42:27,020 --> 02:42:30,380
I was going to cornish college of the 
arts in seattle and uh,

3794
02:42:30,810 --> 02:42:33,660
every,
I think it was every tuesday or thursday

3795
02:42:33,661 --> 02:42:36,450
or maybe wednesday,
one of the middle days,

3796
02:42:37,170 --> 02:42:38,003
they would allow students to throw a 
concert in the theater and the small 

3797
02:42:40,801 --> 02:42:41,634
poncho hall theater and you could just 
sign up for it and you can do whatever 

3798
02:42:43,831 --> 02:42:47,490
you wanted.
And one day it was like all the kind of,

3799
02:42:47,491 --> 02:42:49,500
I guess I would call them performance 
art,

3800
02:42:49,650 --> 02:42:52,560
the musician,
a conceptual musician,

3801
02:42:52,561 --> 02:42:54,090
bad asses,
like all on stage.

3802
02:42:54,360 --> 02:42:56,750
And it was like brent arnold on cello,
scott,

3803
02:42:56,760 --> 02:42:57,593
even kang,
I'm a on violin or viola and a guy on 

3804
02:43:01,801 --> 02:43:06,410
base,
just like five or six people onstage,

3805
02:43:06,450 --> 02:43:09,820
all badasses.
Tim young and uh,

3806
02:43:10,350 --> 02:43:15,350
and I was in the theater and there were 
like maybe 23 kids and a 60 seat theater

3807
02:43:16,480 --> 02:43:18,840
just like chilling,
scattered throughout the seats.

3808
02:43:19,140 --> 02:43:19,973
And they started playing and everybody 
was playing through distortion pedals 

3809
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:28,110
and they just started playing these 
distortion drones like all of them.

3810
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,530
And then eventually it just sounded,
it,

3811
02:43:31,780 --> 02:43:34,150
it,
you saw people doing things on stage,

3812
02:43:34,151 --> 02:43:35,140
but all you could hear was

3813
02:43:42,770 --> 02:43:47,250
for like a,
probably an hour and a.

3814
02:43:48,640 --> 02:43:53,640
And I had earplugs in and everybody 
cleared out,

3815
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:57,020
like everybody cleared out.
And I hung to the end.

3816
02:43:57,021 --> 02:43:57,854
But I started like,
I started like head bobbing because as 

3817
02:44:01,551 --> 02:44:02,384
soon as I started realizing that static,
whether you're seeing visual static or 

3818
02:44:05,361 --> 02:44:06,194
audio static,
after a while you start to hallucinate 

3819
02:44:08,540 --> 02:44:11,300
and you start to,
you start to hear music and static.

3820
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:14,470
So if you hear eventually when you 
defocus,

3821
02:44:14,480 --> 02:44:15,410
it's like those,
you know,

3822
02:44:15,411 --> 02:44:18,890
those um,
magic I puzzles where you're supposed to

3823
02:44:19,010 --> 02:44:21,170
hold your thumb and then all of sudden,
oh,

3824
02:44:21,171 --> 02:44:24,590
I can see this three dimensional image,
same exact concept essentially.

3825
02:44:24,740 --> 02:44:25,573
but your mind is creating the structure 
that you metric structure because it 

3826
02:44:28,131 --> 02:44:31,400
wants to find structure and static is 
like raw energy.

3827
02:44:31,640 --> 02:44:32,473
So of like jodie foster in contact and 
she would stare at the static trying to 

3828
02:44:35,541 --> 02:44:36,620
find patterns in it.

3829
02:44:36,680 --> 02:44:38,180
Exactly.
That's exactly right.

3830
02:44:38,181 --> 02:44:39,014
Yeah,
yeah.

3831
02:44:39,020 --> 02:44:40,870
Similar thing.
And so what.

3832
02:44:40,880 --> 02:44:43,310
So I started like,
I just couldn't stop,

3833
02:44:43,311 --> 02:44:44,144
like head headbanging essentially,
but it was really slow and then 

3834
02:44:47,121 --> 02:44:49,610
afterwards they came up to me and 
they're like,

3835
02:44:49,910 --> 02:44:50,743
oh,
okay,

3836
02:44:50,810 --> 02:44:51,643
you're one of those.
Just remember the bass player sayinG 

3837
02:44:54,291 --> 02:44:55,190
that to me.
And I was like,

3838
02:44:55,250 --> 02:44:56,360
oh,
that's so cool.

3839
02:44:57,920 --> 02:44:58,753
Like he didn't,
he didn't have to explain anything at 

3840
02:44:59,931 --> 02:45:01,070
all.
It's like a news thing.

3841
02:45:01,071 --> 02:45:03,020
So for me,
when I see duration pieces,

3842
02:45:03,080 --> 02:45:06,050
things that test people's patience,
I love it.

3843
02:45:06,110 --> 02:45:08,720
I love seeing people.
I can't stand this.

3844
02:45:08,721 --> 02:45:09,381
And was just like,
no,

3845
02:45:09,381 --> 02:45:09,980
just,
wait,

3846
02:45:09,980 --> 02:45:10,780
just hang in there.
No,

3847
02:45:10,780 --> 02:45:12,800
it can stay there or it's pissing people
off.

3848
02:45:12,801 --> 02:45:13,634
I love it.
It's like there's or not even pissing 

3849
02:45:15,471 --> 02:45:17,840
them off,
just making them frustrated like there's

3850
02:45:17,841 --> 02:45:21,920
a certain amount of frustration that I 
think is fun to play with.

3851
02:45:21,920 --> 02:45:23,660
At least.
At least when I'm doing comedy.

3852
02:45:23,661 --> 02:45:25,550
A little bit of that is,
is good.

3853
02:45:25,551 --> 02:45:28,880
Just like little doses here and there is
kind of my thing.

3854
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:30,740
I like it.
It's a good feeling,

3855
02:45:30,980 --> 02:45:33,980
but I'm testing to see if people are 
willing to relax.

3856
02:45:34,280 --> 02:45:35,061
Yeah,
yeah,

3857
02:45:35,061 --> 02:45:36,050
totally.
You just like,

3858
02:45:36,230 --> 02:45:37,063
I'm just fucking with you.
Just keep that in mind when I'm doing 

3859
02:45:38,841 --> 02:45:42,590
something that seems kind of frustrating
and if you can keep both those things in

3860
02:45:42,591 --> 02:45:43,424
mind,
you can relax and just go for the ride 

3861
02:45:45,300 --> 02:45:47,360
if you,
if you want or you could just be like,

3862
02:45:47,390 --> 02:45:49,370
this fucking sucks and leave,
which is fine.

3863
02:45:49,371 --> 02:45:51,140
To me,
it's not for.

3864
02:45:51,141 --> 02:45:52,850
It's not for everybody.
Nothing.

3865
02:45:52,880 --> 02:45:53,750
Nothing is.
Right.

3866
02:45:53,751 --> 02:45:57,980
It's not all dependent upon whether or 
not you're good at delivering the ride.

3867
02:45:58,460 --> 02:45:59,510
Right?
Totally.

3868
02:45:59,550 --> 02:46:00,070
Yeah.
If,

3869
02:46:00,070 --> 02:46:01,610
as long as there's a reward,
that's the thing.

3870
02:46:01,670 --> 02:46:02,540
It's like,
I mean,

3871
02:46:02,541 --> 02:46:04,820
that's what you're doing right?
You're always playing off of something.

3872
02:46:04,821 --> 02:46:05,654
That's what a joke is.
It's like expectations of the 

3873
02:46:07,720 --> 02:46:10,070
expectation and and there's

3874
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:12,230
so many different ways,
a few different ways you can do that,

3875
02:46:12,231 --> 02:46:15,290
so I'm just going to be people that just
have different styles that they enjoy.

3876
02:46:15,291 --> 02:46:20,000
Like there's people that are gabriel 
iglesias fans and people that tig notaro

3877
02:46:20,001 --> 02:46:21,000
fans.
Right.

3878
02:46:21,110 --> 02:46:23,840
You know what I'm saying?
There's people that are fans of both.

3879
02:46:23,870 --> 02:46:24,621
Yeah,
totally.

3880
02:46:24,621 --> 02:46:25,400
Yeah,
totally.

3881
02:46:25,400 --> 02:46:27,440
I know I might go into those.
Those I'm like,

3882
02:46:27,441 --> 02:46:28,700
I like anybody.
That's funny.

3883
02:46:28,790 --> 02:46:29,601
Yeah.
I like,

3884
02:46:29,601 --> 02:46:30,710
yeah.
I like any music.

3885
02:46:30,711 --> 02:46:31,700
That's good.
Yeah,

3886
02:46:31,701 --> 02:46:33,050
that's,
that's a good way to say.

3887
02:46:33,060 --> 02:46:36,620
Yeah.
Results may vary.

3888
02:46:36,810 --> 02:46:38,210
The results may vary,
but like,

3889
02:46:38,211 --> 02:46:39,200
you know,
if you know,

3890
02:46:39,260 --> 02:46:40,760
it's just like,
it's a sincerity,

3891
02:46:40,770 --> 02:46:42,500
you know,
we all know is like comics.

3892
02:46:42,501 --> 02:46:45,710
If we're watching other comics up there 
that we haven't seen before,

3893
02:46:45,711 --> 02:46:49,670
you can tell pretty quick when it's,
it's coming from an honest place.

3894
02:46:50,280 --> 02:46:51,820
Even if it's like they're a little 
nervous,

3895
02:46:51,830 --> 02:46:53,900
you can tell they're nervous and they're
kind of playing a cool front.

3896
02:46:54,200 --> 02:46:55,033
Like you can tell that the jokes,
the point of view is coming from an 

3897
02:46:56,870 --> 02:46:58,550
honest place.
Well,

3898
02:46:58,551 --> 02:47:02,470
it's also.
I think we lost that with djs.

3899
02:47:02,820 --> 02:47:03,653
There's chase.
Like when I was a kid I would remember 

3900
02:47:06,411 --> 02:47:07,244
djs playing songs and it was sincere 
appreciation for the songs they playing 

3901
02:47:11,011 --> 02:47:11,844
because they did pick this song.
I really want you to dig the song and 

3902
02:47:14,031 --> 02:47:17,650
you'd find a dj that you like.
You're really enjoyed his shell.

3903
02:47:17,710 --> 02:47:19,410
Oh,
he's going to be three to seven.

3904
02:47:19,411 --> 02:47:20,244
This guy's the shit.
He played great music and you listen to 

3905
02:47:22,191 --> 02:47:27,191
him talk about the songs and there was 
this authentic thing to it verses like a

3906
02:47:27,261 --> 02:47:29,060
jack fm station.
We're like,

3907
02:47:29,061 --> 02:47:30,910
here we go,
jack fmp,

3908
02:47:31,070 --> 02:47:33,980
all the hits,
all the difference all the time.

3909
02:47:34,580 --> 02:47:39,580
Twenty four slash seven fade right into 
the music and like kiss your duh.

3910
02:47:40,290 --> 02:47:43,220
Yeah.
You get that with kids who are so donate

3911
02:47:43,221 --> 02:47:48,221
now to not just share hi Terry Cross.

3912
02:47:49,340 --> 02:47:52,940
All things considered.
I used to listen to that all the time.

3913
02:47:52,970 --> 02:47:54,620
Public radio,
international,

3914
02:47:54,830 --> 02:47:56,820
npr.
I used to listen to that all the time.

3915
02:47:56,930 --> 02:48:00,110
If a coleman,
that was my morning ritual.

3916
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:03,370
Npr,
I act before they were podcast.

3917
02:48:03,371 --> 02:48:06,320
This is different than what other other 
things you're hearing.

3918
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:08,660
All things considered.
I love.

3919
02:48:08,661 --> 02:48:09,051
Wait,
wait.

3920
02:48:09,051 --> 02:48:10,250
They'll tell me.
Oh,

3921
02:48:10,550 --> 02:48:11,340
those are good.
It's a.

3922
02:48:11,340 --> 02:48:12,173
It's a pretty fun time.
It's pretty biting actually and it's 

3923
02:48:15,170 --> 02:48:17,290
lightning fast.
I mean the wit on there.

3924
02:48:17,291 --> 02:48:18,560
It's just awesome.
Yeah.

3925
02:48:18,561 --> 02:48:20,510
Npr,
radio lab's nprs.

3926
02:48:20,660 --> 02:48:21,350
Radiolab.
Yep.

3927
02:48:21,350 --> 02:48:22,460
Yeah.
That was one of the best.

3928
02:48:22,461 --> 02:48:23,294
Podcasts are amazing that I've learned 
more from radio lab that I did from all 

3929
02:48:26,961 --> 02:48:28,730
my years of barely paying attention in 
school.

3930
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,160
Like for sure.
Yup.

3931
02:48:31,220 --> 02:48:32,053
Yeah.
I quote radio lab more than I quote at 

3932
02:48:34,530 --> 02:48:36,050
most books I've read.
Yeah,

3933
02:48:36,190 --> 02:48:37,460
no,
I agree.

3934
02:48:37,580 --> 02:48:39,950
I agree there.
They're absolutely fantastic.

3935
02:48:39,951 --> 02:48:40,784
I mean there's just like a lot of cool 
shows on there that keith was wsdl 

3936
02:48:44,131 --> 02:48:44,964
because they play so much dope music.
Like it's I discover like probably 80 

3937
02:48:49,851 --> 02:48:53,320
percent of my music on really what 
station is that a case vow?

3938
02:48:53,321 --> 02:48:56,780
It's a 93 point three zero or 89 point 
nine.

3939
02:48:56,930 --> 02:49:00,860
I haven't listened to a radio station in
fucking years.

3940
02:49:00,990 --> 02:49:03,170
You should check it out on the radio in 
years.

3941
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:04,033
It's cool.
I just get the app and I stream it from 

3942
02:49:05,541 --> 02:49:08,010
my app for my phone.
I listen to music when I

3943
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:10,240
work out sometimes when I'm driving.
Yeah,

3944
02:49:10,290 --> 02:49:12,030
most of the time.
Listening to podcasts now,

3945
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:13,340
89,
99 point nine,

3946
02:49:13,350 --> 02:49:16,910
city of licensed santa monica,
public broadcasting owner,

3947
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:19,050
santa monica college.
How weird.

3948
02:49:19,110 --> 02:49:19,921
Yeah.
They're moving.

3949
02:49:19,921 --> 02:49:21,210
They got.
They got new location,

3950
02:49:21,211 --> 02:49:22,044
but they're like one of the most 
influential radio stations in the 

3951
02:49:24,390 --> 02:49:25,223
country.
I think that's the place where Henry 

3952
02:49:27,660 --> 02:49:29,250
Rollins has a weekly show.
Totally.

3953
02:49:29,310 --> 02:49:30,870
Yeah,
a fanatic.

3954
02:49:31,010 --> 02:49:32,690
Yeah,
and fanatic.

3955
02:49:33,660 --> 02:49:36,090
good rounded.
Yeah.

3956
02:49:36,330 --> 02:49:37,163
He's great.
I mean you just get like this kind of 

3957
02:49:38,851 --> 02:49:41,220
more like eighties radio feel.
Right?

3958
02:49:41,221 --> 02:49:41,650
Right,
right.

3959
02:49:41,650 --> 02:49:42,483
Yeah.
Like these underground guys are know 

3960
02:49:43,430 --> 02:49:44,263
people like these really warm voices.
Like that was a new one from orbital 

3961
02:49:47,160 --> 02:49:51,510
coming out with a single.
That's definitely definitely geared more

3962
02:49:51,511 --> 02:49:54,810
towards the kids from the 19 nineties.
If you remember that time period.

3963
02:49:55,110 --> 02:49:56,180
This is a new one for me.
You know,

3964
02:49:56,181 --> 02:49:57,370
like that kind of shit where you're 
like,

3965
02:49:57,480 --> 02:49:58,313
oh yeah,
you feel like you're in a warm bath of 

3966
02:50:01,171 --> 02:50:01,681
like,
oh,

3967
02:50:01,681 --> 02:50:02,070
what else?

3968
02:50:02,070 --> 02:50:05,670
What else you got?
The sudden your one from a flan turf and

3969
02:50:05,671 --> 02:50:08,850
then it's just like this weird angular,
gross sounding music and you're like,

3970
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:11,190
how are you able to talk lIke that and 
play that track?

3971
02:50:11,220 --> 02:50:12,053
And it was great.
I love the fact that people could just 

3972
02:50:13,741 --> 02:50:15,840
play whatever they want.
Like we need more of that,

3973
02:50:15,870 --> 02:50:18,510
like totally tried for a long time to do
it the other way.

3974
02:50:18,511 --> 02:50:19,344
It doesn't work.
No algorithms for got spotify now and 

3975
02:50:22,291 --> 02:50:23,124
you've got all that shit,
which I don't really dig but not as 

3976
02:50:25,891 --> 02:50:26,880
much.
I mean I,

3977
02:50:26,881 --> 02:50:29,010
sometimes they'll do a radio station on 
apple music,

3978
02:50:29,460 --> 02:50:32,010
uh,
but I like choosing.

3979
02:50:32,040 --> 02:50:32,873
I listened to albums so I listened to an
album for a long time and then I'll 

3980
02:50:36,031 --> 02:50:39,660
switch to another album or I'll switch 
to like three songs off of a record.

3981
02:50:39,661 --> 02:50:40,494
But I like choosing when I'm listening 
to on occasion I have discovered cool 

3982
02:50:43,801 --> 02:50:45,690
music by using the radio station.

3983
02:50:45,900 --> 02:50:46,733
But really for me,
I'd rather just do kcrw because then 

3984
02:50:49,141 --> 02:50:50,480
there's a real human,
you know,

3985
02:50:50,580 --> 02:50:51,001
going,
hey,

3986
02:50:51,001 --> 02:50:52,020
check this out.
Yeah.

3987
02:50:52,021 --> 02:50:54,240
And it's.
And it's a rare treat.

3988
02:50:54,330 --> 02:50:55,260
Yeah.
I like that.

3989
02:50:55,610 --> 02:50:56,443
I like it.
I like keeping it a little bit more old 

3990
02:50:57,511 --> 02:50:59,910
school when it comes to music discovery 
and listening.

3991
02:51:00,030 --> 02:51:01,740
Well,
just the fact that you know that this is

3992
02:51:01,741 --> 02:51:02,920
rare now.
You know,

3993
02:51:02,940 --> 02:51:04,200
you appreciate it.
Yeah,

3994
02:51:04,230 --> 02:51:05,070
absolutely.
Well,

3995
02:51:05,071 --> 02:51:07,530
we have to come back to it.
I mean the organic shit.

3996
02:51:07,531 --> 02:51:09,990
I mean that's why like anything I look 
at technology,

3997
02:51:09,991 --> 02:51:12,720
it's like we're still kind of primitive.
It's not organic enough.

3998
02:51:12,721 --> 02:51:15,030
It's not an after thought.
we're not an afterthought mode.

3999
02:51:15,031 --> 02:51:16,370
It's not like,
you know,

4000
02:51:16,710 --> 02:51:18,840
technology should be like a light 
switch.

4001
02:51:18,870 --> 02:51:19,703
I went to a restaurant the other day and
all of their furniture was made with 

4002
02:51:22,500 --> 02:51:27,030
metal pipes and like would like this and
you know,

4003
02:51:27,031 --> 02:51:30,150
like that sort of crafty sort of feel to
things.

4004
02:51:30,150 --> 02:51:33,060
We're touching wood and brick on the 
wall.

4005
02:51:33,370 --> 02:51:37,390
Like that's like suit and the menu was 
written in a chalkboard.

4006
02:51:37,430 --> 02:51:39,630
Yeah,
totally want that shit now.

4007
02:51:39,660 --> 02:51:39,910
Oh,
they,

4008
02:51:39,910 --> 02:51:42,000
they liked the personal touch.
It makes them,

4009
02:51:42,001 --> 02:51:45,090
it reminds them of being human because 
we're so digital most of the time.

4010
02:51:45,160 --> 02:51:47,370
Somebody gives you an ipad and the menus
and the ipad.

4011
02:51:47,371 --> 02:51:48,204
No,
I don't like it.

4012
02:51:48,760 --> 02:51:52,260
Don't like chalkboard over here.
Do not like to see the specialist on the

4013
02:51:52,261 --> 02:51:53,370
chalkboard.
Yep.

4014
02:51:53,490 --> 02:51:55,830
Not swipe to go.
Well,

4015
02:51:55,831 --> 02:51:58,200
what?
What kind of beer do you know?

4016
02:51:58,600 --> 02:51:59,433
Gross.
that's why I think monitors tv should 

4017
02:52:03,001 --> 02:52:06,070
only be in sports bars and then keep 
them out of all the

4018
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:07,720
other places.
I'd love to just go.

4019
02:52:07,721 --> 02:52:08,554
I'm not a drinker,
but if I go to a bar with a with a 

4020
02:52:10,691 --> 02:52:11,524
friend,
I love it when I go into a bar that's 

4021
02:52:12,881 --> 02:52:14,130
just a bar.
It's just.

4022
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:14,973
I mean,
and what I mean is there's no fucking 

4023
02:52:15,910 --> 02:52:17,410
television.
It's off.

4024
02:52:17,530 --> 02:52:20,080
Maybe just in case for an emergency 
broadcasts or something because there's.

4025
02:52:20,170 --> 02:52:21,730
There are peopLe gathered there 
whatever,

4026
02:52:22,060 --> 02:52:24,520
but I like it when it's like there's no 
fucking monitor.

4027
02:52:24,610 --> 02:52:26,970
People are just chilling and having 
conversations with each other.

4028
02:52:26,980 --> 02:52:29,200
That's what a bar should be.
Should I be afraid?

4029
02:52:29,230 --> 02:52:30,063
Maybe you show blade on every screen 
streaming 24 slash seven project it 

4030
02:52:35,470 --> 02:52:36,303
projected on a screen just to soften the
light because otherwise you get that 

4031
02:52:38,831 --> 02:52:39,664
screen glare,
which is a fucking asshole on super old 

4032
02:52:42,071 --> 02:52:43,930
school.
Drive a fucking horse.

4033
02:52:43,990 --> 02:52:44,771
Yeah,
I do.

4034
02:52:44,771 --> 02:52:46,120
I do drive a horse.

4035
02:52:46,830 --> 02:52:50,180
that's,
that's the technical term for drive one.

4036
02:52:50,470 --> 02:52:51,303
Well,
we're going to long for the days were 

4037
02:52:52,211 --> 02:52:54,500
engines were real.
one day we're going to be like,

4038
02:52:54,530 --> 02:52:56,790
remember when back when cars made noises
and you could hear him.

4039
02:52:56,791 --> 02:52:57,431
Come on.
Yeah,

4040
02:52:57,431 --> 02:52:58,750
totally.
It be like.

4041
02:52:58,751 --> 02:53:00,790
I remember when he used to drive him.
Yeah,

4042
02:53:02,140 --> 02:53:04,660
that was my favorite scene in I,
but he's like,

4043
02:53:04,690 --> 02:53:05,523
I'm going manual.
They're going like 300 miles per hour 

4044
02:53:07,001 --> 02:53:09,730
and then the computer say or know the 
person that the pastor said,

4045
02:53:09,760 --> 02:53:10,593
are you crazy?
Going to switching to manual at these 

4046
02:53:11,891 --> 02:53:14,810
speeds.
I love that man.

4047
02:53:15,230 --> 02:53:17,320
It's like one day.
That'll be a thing of the past.

4048
02:53:17,440 --> 02:53:18,820
The spiritual wheels though.
I mean,

4049
02:53:18,821 --> 02:53:19,810
come on.
That was sick.

4050
02:53:20,160 --> 02:53:20,993
Yeah.
The car could rotate while it's still 

4051
02:53:22,091 --> 02:53:24,220
maintaining the same speed forward.
Oh yeah,

4052
02:53:24,221 --> 02:53:27,250
that's right.
It was just coming to spheres.

4053
02:53:27,400 --> 02:53:28,540
Yeah,
they have them in factory.

4054
02:53:28,570 --> 02:53:31,030
Factory floor robots are like forklifts 
now.

4055
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:31,953
Oh yeah.
I forgot what they call that type of 

4056
02:53:34,151 --> 02:53:35,240
steering.
Um,

4057
02:53:35,650 --> 02:53:37,450
but it's like crap.
It's basically crab,

4058
02:53:37,451 --> 02:53:39,970
like so it can move forward sideways.
Any,

4059
02:53:39,980 --> 02:53:40,813
any way.
How many years do you think we have 

4060
02:53:41,861 --> 02:53:43,420
where it's still legal to drive your own
car?

4061
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:46,630
I think we have prObably 10 years.
Ten years.

4062
02:53:46,640 --> 02:53:47,980
Sounds good.
That sounds about right.

4063
02:53:48,300 --> 02:53:48,760
yeah.
Yeah.

4064
02:53:48,760 --> 02:53:49,593
I feel like it's goiNg to creep in.
We are going to realize how much safer 

4065
02:53:52,181 --> 02:53:53,460
it is.
People with some.

4066
02:53:53,530 --> 02:53:55,870
Some assholes are gonna fuck up with 
manual.

4067
02:53:55,871 --> 02:53:56,704
They're going to crash into a school or 
something like that and then people are 

4068
02:53:58,771 --> 02:54:00,640
going to go enough with the manual.
Yeah,

4069
02:54:00,650 --> 02:54:01,411
enough,
you know?

4070
02:54:01,411 --> 02:54:04,150
Yeah.
But they'll do semI manual like you can,

4071
02:54:04,180 --> 02:54:05,770
you can,
you can steer,

4072
02:54:05,771 --> 02:54:06,604
you can drive within certain parameters,
but if the computer senses you're going 

4073
02:54:08,921 --> 02:54:11,800
off the rails and we'll fucking guide 
the car back.

4074
02:54:11,920 --> 02:54:12,251
Well,
you know,

4075
02:54:12,251 --> 02:54:13,084
that's why it's so.
There's such a demand for really old 

4076
02:54:16,121 --> 02:54:19,150
cars that have tactile feedback.
Yeah.

4077
02:54:19,240 --> 02:54:22,270
They're so expensive.
Like if you buy a 19,

4078
02:54:22,271 --> 02:54:23,104
73 porsche,
which is only like 150 200 horsepower 

4079
02:54:27,251 --> 02:54:29,350
engine.
If those things are in good shape.

4080
02:54:29,440 --> 02:54:31,650
Yeah.
Worth a fuck load of money now.

4081
02:54:31,720 --> 02:54:32,553
True.
Because you feel everything we drive in 

4082
02:54:34,031 --> 02:54:34,750
that thing.
Yeah,

4083
02:54:34,750 --> 02:54:35,583
totally.
Every bumpy drive over you feel that 

4084
02:54:37,720 --> 02:54:38,553
there's no power steering at all.
So you feel like turn on the steering 

4085
02:54:42,581 --> 02:54:43,181
wheel.
Yeah,

4086
02:54:43,181 --> 02:54:43,511
yeah,
yeah,

4087
02:54:43,511 --> 02:54:44,010
yeah.
You're,

4088
02:54:44,010 --> 02:54:44,843
if you feel the force against the wheel 
to and interpretation and when you turn 

4089
02:54:47,861 --> 02:54:50,440
hard,
it's harder to turn way harder.

4090
02:54:50,441 --> 02:54:50,921
Yeah.
Yeah.

4091
02:54:50,921 --> 02:54:52,000
You got it.
You got to really.

4092
02:54:52,001 --> 02:54:55,540
You've got to be present with it.
Whereas like with new power steering,

4093
02:54:55,550 --> 02:54:58,510
you could kind of be absent minded and 
be taking a pretty hard corner.

4094
02:54:58,790 --> 02:55:00,340
She's easy to roll the car.
Well,

4095
02:55:00,341 --> 02:55:01,174
difference in also the newest power 
steering even opposed to the last 

4096
02:55:04,550 --> 02:55:04,550
generations

4097
02:55:04,550 --> 02:55:06,650
now they do power steering.
That's electric.

4098
02:55:06,710 --> 02:55:07,820
Yeah.
It's fly by wire.

4099
02:55:07,880 --> 02:55:08,713
You don't feel a thing.
Whereas the hydraulic gave you varying 

4100
02:55:11,151 --> 02:55:11,984
feedback depending on how much a load 
was on our rack and pinion and I always 

4101
02:55:15,351 --> 02:55:16,184
loved writing.
I thought that that was the perfect 

4102
02:55:17,361 --> 02:55:18,410
happy medium.
Yeah.

4103
02:55:18,530 --> 02:55:21,980
Because it like,
well those really old cars were so light

4104
02:55:22,010 --> 02:55:27,010
like those old porsche's and old bmws,
like the bmw 2002 and by any bugs.

4105
02:55:28,380 --> 02:55:29,690
Yep.
So light.

4106
02:55:29,691 --> 02:55:31,750
You didn't have to have power steering,
you know?

4107
02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:32,620
Yeah.
Well,

4108
02:55:32,621 --> 02:55:34,340
I mean,
what people are doing now is they're,

4109
02:55:34,430 --> 02:55:35,121
they're,
they're,

4110
02:55:35,121 --> 02:55:35,954
uh,
they're pulling the transmissions and 

4111
02:55:37,551 --> 02:55:39,410
engines and replacing them with 
electric,

4112
02:55:39,620 --> 02:55:42,980
so you still have the road feel and the 
handling of it,

4113
02:55:43,010 --> 02:55:44,300
but you get the battery,
you get the,

4114
02:55:44,330 --> 02:55:46,460
you get the battery so you don't get,
I mean it's not loud,

4115
02:55:46,461 --> 02:55:50,330
but you get this great fusion of like 
you've got the classic car look,

4116
02:55:50,420 --> 02:55:52,730
but you've got the speed and the 
pickups.

4117
02:55:52,730 --> 02:55:56,830
So kind of like this little tiny bmt to 
bmw 2002 and you're doing zero,

4118
02:55:56,840 --> 02:55:57,673
63 point five seconds.
I saw somebody did that with a 1965 

4119
02:56:01,101 --> 02:56:03,680
mustang.
They took a 65 mustang and turns it into

4120
02:56:03,681 --> 02:56:06,260
an electric car and it was like to be 
sad.

4121
02:56:06,440 --> 02:56:07,273
It's a beast.
I know that when you're talking about 

4122
02:56:08,930 --> 02:56:09,763
you're looking at this classic old 
school muscle car and yet it has like a 

4123
02:56:13,490 --> 02:56:14,730
tesla under.
Yeah.

4124
02:56:14,900 --> 02:56:18,330
It's like an electric muscle car.
I mean rimac.

4125
02:56:18,480 --> 02:56:19,313
Do you know the rimac or rhythmic there?
Estonian r I m a c and they make this a 

4126
02:56:27,241 --> 02:56:30,800
electric car for electric motors motor 
for each wheel.

4127
02:56:30,960 --> 02:56:33,140
Well,
it's got over a thousand horsepower.

4128
02:56:33,170 --> 02:56:36,380
jesus,
zero to 60 in three point two.

4129
02:56:36,920 --> 02:56:37,753
Something like that.
Three point is maybe even faster than 

4130
02:56:39,741 --> 02:56:41,500
that.
M and a,

4131
02:56:41,540 --> 02:56:41,970
or.
No,

4132
02:56:41,970 --> 02:56:42,231
no,
no,

4133
02:56:42,231 --> 02:56:42,471
no,
no.

4134
02:56:42,471 --> 02:56:44,660
Two point two,
point three.

4135
02:56:45,130 --> 02:56:46,500
That thing's insane.
Listen,

4136
02:56:46,501 --> 02:56:48,980
because my card is two point three.
What car do you have?

4137
02:56:49,400 --> 02:56:53,420
A tesla p 100 d damn son.
Look at this thing.

4138
02:56:53,750 --> 02:56:57,520
This thing is beautiful.
It looks like one of those lexis copays,

4139
02:56:57,530 --> 02:56:59,400
those new lexus coops.
Yeah.

4140
02:57:00,390 --> 02:57:02,780
Yeah.
It's amazing.

4141
02:57:02,990 --> 02:57:04,250
Yeah.
See if they can have like a.

4142
02:57:04,251 --> 02:57:05,084
Yeah,
there you go.

4143
02:57:05,490 --> 02:57:08,030
That thing is beautiful.
yeah.

4144
02:57:08,031 --> 02:57:09,710
It's like,
it's crazy.

4145
02:57:09,711 --> 02:57:10,660
And so it does,
uh,

4146
02:57:10,720 --> 02:57:12,290
it,
it definitely does.

4147
02:57:12,291 --> 02:57:16,220
Um,
effectual steering and power.

4148
02:57:16,270 --> 02:57:19,490
This power distribution,
so it keeps things are gorgeous.

4149
02:57:19,491 --> 02:57:20,324
Can corner like a motherfucker.
And because the computer's monitoring 

4150
02:57:23,421 --> 02:57:24,254
traction all the time,
if to each wheel with an electric motor 

4151
02:57:26,631 --> 02:57:27,464
that has instantaneous torque,
you're able to steer the car with 

4152
02:57:30,081 --> 02:57:33,140
acceleration.
So if you're coming around a corner,

4153
02:57:33,500 --> 02:57:35,240
depending on the mode and the way that 
you're driving,

4154
02:57:35,510 --> 02:57:36,343
you can actually push the car around the
corner with the wheels using the input 

4155
02:57:40,461 --> 02:57:41,294
from the steering wheel.
So your directional steering but also 

4156
02:57:42,621 --> 02:57:47,621
visual steering at the same time.
So that car is disgusting.

4157
02:57:48,320 --> 02:57:52,070
It's just leaving this tesla behind you.
Just leaving it,

4158
02:57:52,071 --> 02:57:53,780
leaving it like it's parked.
Yeah.

4159
02:57:53,880 --> 02:57:56,630
This guy,
this guy actually does some good shit.

4160
02:57:56,660 --> 02:57:59,420
And so there's like some like young rich
guys that are always doing stuff,

4161
02:57:59,421 --> 02:58:01,010
but I like that guy.
He's going to race a.

4162
02:58:01,750 --> 02:58:02,000
All you

4163
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,710
know is going to burry that ferrari.
The ferrari is history.

4164
02:58:05,580 --> 02:58:07,320
Is that la ferrari?
Yeah,

4165
02:58:07,321 --> 02:58:09,220
that's a it.
Yeah.

4166
02:58:09,240 --> 02:58:11,580
It's a ferrari laferrari,
which is hybrid.

4167
02:58:12,400 --> 02:58:16,180
That's crazy.
The remax remax going to win.

4168
02:58:16,430 --> 02:58:18,150
I know,
I think so.

4169
02:58:18,210 --> 02:58:19,440
Let's see.
Three,

4170
02:58:19,740 --> 02:58:21,300
two,
one go.

4171
02:58:22,230 --> 02:58:23,640
Oh my god.
Off the line.

4172
02:58:23,670 --> 02:58:26,070
Instantaneously.
Not even close.

4173
02:58:26,750 --> 02:58:27,583
It's just.
See you later.

4174
02:58:28,210 --> 02:58:30,750
It's linear power curve,
right?

4175
02:58:31,260 --> 02:58:34,050
It's an absolute.
It's a curve.

4176
02:58:34,080 --> 02:58:36,630
It's just a perfect curve of absolute 
poWer.

4177
02:58:36,660 --> 02:58:38,190
That's insane.
Now,

4178
02:58:38,191 --> 02:58:40,710
where does one get one of these remax 
you?

4179
02:58:40,800 --> 02:58:43,990
How far can they drive a yards?
Yeah,

4180
02:58:44,010 --> 02:58:47,010
totally.
It can go 200 feet per charge.

4181
02:58:47,280 --> 02:58:49,500
Find out how long those things drive for
it.

4182
02:58:49,501 --> 02:58:52,710
Let's take a guess.
I'd say they have 220 miles on them.

4183
02:58:53,200 --> 02:58:54,033
What do you say?
I'm going to say I'm going to say 180 

4184
02:58:57,301 --> 02:58:59,350
miles.
Two hundred miles to 200 machines today.

4185
02:58:59,360 --> 02:59:00,193
You went low ball.

4186
02:59:00,430 --> 02:59:02,910
High ball on me.
Top top end of two.

4187
02:59:02,911 --> 02:59:06,000
Twenty five or something like that.
Which an electric car is a huge deal.

4188
02:59:06,030 --> 02:59:08,880
What's your tesla get?
What's the longest distance you drive?

4189
02:59:09,650 --> 02:59:11,970
Three 40.
That's pretty god damn good.

4190
02:59:11,980 --> 02:59:13,040
Something like that.
Or three.

4191
02:59:13,110 --> 02:59:15,490
You think about when tesla,
when they.

4192
02:59:15,630 --> 02:59:17,130
Oh,
like had a bunch of people.

4193
02:59:17,131 --> 02:59:18,700
What does it say?
Two point eight.

4194
02:59:18,720 --> 02:59:21,840
80 two kilowatt can get 200.
Five miles?

4195
02:59:21,950 --> 02:59:22,783
Yep.
Did they don't specify conceptual 

4196
02:59:23,960 --> 02:59:25,890
driving to drive cycle?
Yeah.

4197
02:59:25,891 --> 02:59:28,440
So if you're driving like a maniac,
I'm going to say 1:50.

4198
02:59:28,510 --> 02:59:29,670
Yeah.
Maybe not even,

4199
02:59:29,671 --> 02:59:30,001
right?
Yeah.

4200
02:59:30,001 --> 02:59:31,410
One 40.
Let me think about.

4201
02:59:31,411 --> 02:59:32,244
Like during the hurricane in Florida,
tesla released a bunch of these cars 

4202
02:59:36,720 --> 02:59:40,070
that had um,
they had restrictions on the,

4203
02:59:40,071 --> 02:59:42,600
uh,
amount of distance they could drive.

4204
02:59:43,050 --> 02:59:43,883
Oh yeah.
And so they did it remotely and they 

4205
02:59:45,931 --> 02:59:48,660
gave these cars more of a distance.

4206
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:49,171
Oh yeah,
yeah,

4207
02:59:49,171 --> 02:59:50,400
yeah.
They control speed.

4208
02:59:50,401 --> 02:59:52,110
Probably governed top to top speed.
No,

4209
02:59:52,111 --> 02:59:55,540
I think they actually literally have a 
threshold of hoW far they,

4210
02:59:55,610 --> 02:59:57,900
they like you could pay more when you 
buy them.

4211
02:59:58,470 --> 02:59:59,303
If you buy one,
you could have the option to have a 250 

4212
03:00:01,711 --> 03:00:06,060
mile gas tank or a 350 miles a day.
We just unlocked the capability.

4213
03:00:06,061 --> 03:00:07,020
Exactly.
Interesting.

4214
03:00:07,021 --> 03:00:10,050
So the same but kilowatt battery 
kilowatt battery.

4215
03:00:10,110 --> 03:00:11,310
Yeah.
I don't know about that.

4216
03:00:11,311 --> 03:00:12,390
I don't like that.
It's weird,

4217
03:00:12,391 --> 03:00:12,831
right?
I think.

4218
03:00:12,831 --> 03:00:16,500
I think as long as the battery system Is
modular so that you can add or take away

4219
03:00:16,501 --> 03:00:17,334
from it without like huge manufacturing 
costs of changing the shape of the 

4220
03:00:20,071 --> 03:00:20,980
battery,
which is that,

4221
03:00:20,990 --> 03:00:24,120
which is what tesla does.
You can either like elongate the body of

4222
03:00:24,121 --> 03:00:24,954
the car and then add more packs or you 
can shorten the body of the car and 

4223
03:00:28,200 --> 03:00:28,920
narrow it.

4224
03:00:28,920 --> 03:00:31,130
Less packs,
but I think it should just be packed.

4225
03:00:31,150 --> 03:00:34,890
Just fucking people over.
I just don't have the capability.

4226
03:00:34,891 --> 03:00:35,724
It's just a software thing.
I'm not going to cost any extra money 

4227
03:00:37,500 --> 03:00:39,900
unless the idea this is,
but it's so weird.

4228
03:00:39,901 --> 03:00:40,734
It's like,
well then why not just make a 

4229
03:00:41,340 --> 03:00:44,250
competitive lease for the battery 
capacity that you want?

4230
03:00:44,520 --> 03:00:46,170
Or or they're like,
well,

4231
03:00:46,171 --> 03:00:50,460
why buy it for a small price now and if 
you want to pay more later we can unlock

4232
03:00:50,461 --> 03:00:51,294
more battery potential.
The problem instead of like say if you 

4233
03:00:53,011 --> 03:00:56,520
buy it engine and it has 800 horsepower 
and then the,

4234
03:00:56,521 --> 03:00:57,354
you know there's another option.
You could buy the v six and that only 

4235
03:00:59,141 --> 03:01:01,600
has 350 horsepower psych.
We're kidding.

4236
03:01:01,601 --> 03:01:02,434
The v six has 800 horsepower.
We're not going to let you use it 

4237
03:01:04,271 --> 03:01:06,400
because you're not paying us.
That's what really what it is,

4238
03:01:06,700 --> 03:01:10,470
is because it's the same exact battery 
pack that I don't like the,

4239
03:01:10,630 --> 03:01:11,800
that,
that I don't like,

4240
03:01:11,830 --> 03:01:12,970
that doesn't make sense.

4241
03:01:13,320 --> 03:01:14,153
Give intentionally.
They've crippled some of their cars and 

4242
03:01:16,841 --> 03:01:19,200
the other ones they given you an option 
to not crippled,

4243
03:01:19,201 --> 03:01:20,034
but we want you to pay more.
Well you need to have the same exact 

4244
03:01:22,151 --> 03:01:22,990
hardware.
It's an,

4245
03:01:23,020 --> 03:01:26,000
it's an inept purchase.
Well it is kinda,

4246
03:01:26,020 --> 03:01:27,340
but it's uh,
it's,

4247
03:01:27,400 --> 03:01:29,500
it's way different because you're 
talking about like a physical.

4248
03:01:29,501 --> 03:01:32,740
It's like almost if your phone,
do you have to pay more on your phone is

4249
03:01:32,741 --> 03:01:35,170
250 gigabytes versus 100?
Totally.

4250
03:01:35,380 --> 03:01:36,330
That's really what it is.
But yeah,

4251
03:01:36,410 --> 03:01:39,070
but it's like also the same as getting a
video game and you're like,

4252
03:01:39,100 --> 03:01:40,480
I've got the video game and they're 
like,

4253
03:01:40,481 --> 03:01:43,510
would you like to unlock more content?
But see that's the journey you're on,

4254
03:01:43,511 --> 03:01:44,344
right?
Your video game is a portal to a 

4255
03:01:45,161 --> 03:01:45,994
journey.
This physical device that has the 

4256
03:01:47,861 --> 03:01:49,750
capability tO drive 350 miles,
like,

4257
03:01:49,751 --> 03:01:51,340
nah,
you can't have those 3:50.

4258
03:01:51,340 --> 03:01:53,170
I'll give you two,
200 miles.

4259
03:01:53,420 --> 03:01:54,450
How long,
how many times?

4260
03:01:54,470 --> 03:01:55,303
Like realistically,
I'm only driving like maybe 30 miles a 

4261
03:01:58,091 --> 03:01:59,350
day,
but that doesn't matter,

4262
03:01:59,380 --> 03:02:01,290
but I'm just saying that if you want to 
go across country,

4263
03:02:01,360 --> 03:02:03,790
the idea was like you could in the 
future.

4264
03:02:03,820 --> 03:02:05,200
We'll see.
IT doesn't make sense.

4265
03:02:05,201 --> 03:02:07,200
I don't know if that's.
Is that a real thing?

4266
03:02:07,260 --> 03:02:10,360
It's a real thing.
Stupid just doesn't make any sense.

4267
03:02:10,390 --> 03:02:11,980
It's like you don't need to do that to 
make money.

4268
03:02:12,640 --> 03:02:13,473
Well,
I guess if you just want to like unify 

4269
03:02:14,921 --> 03:02:15,754
the manufacturing process so that you 
can create a higher yield or something 

4270
03:02:18,401 --> 03:02:20,170
like that.
You're looking at it like the man,

4271
03:02:20,990 --> 03:02:21,823
the man to me,
I'm looking at it as though the 

4272
03:02:23,210 --> 03:02:26,650
congenial johnny blue collar consumer 
fucking pissed.

4273
03:02:27,100 --> 03:02:28,080
I am pissed at you.
I,

4274
03:02:28,081 --> 03:02:28,840
I,
you know,

4275
03:02:28,840 --> 03:02:30,820
I'm,
I'm just saying just saying I understand

4276
03:02:31,140 --> 03:02:31,450
red.

4277
03:02:31,450 --> 03:02:33,250
You want.
We're going to wrap this pitch up.

4278
03:02:33,340 --> 03:02:34,080
Yeah.
That's fair to say.

4279
03:02:34,080 --> 03:02:36,700
To wrap it out.
This is awesome man.

4280
03:02:36,701 --> 03:02:38,410
I know people talk a out.
They're like,

4281
03:02:38,411 --> 03:02:39,000
oh,
you should.

4282
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:40,730
You should be on his show.
You should be on his show.

4283
03:02:41,200 --> 03:02:42,033
Pete,
you and I ran into each other the first 

4284
03:02:42,821 --> 03:02:43,654
time we ever met a plane.
We were flying to london or something 

4285
03:02:47,320 --> 03:02:48,270
together.
yeah,

4286
03:02:48,570 --> 03:02:50,950
that's randomly.
That is international plane.

4287
03:02:50,951 --> 03:02:52,390
We were like one seat ahead of each 
other.

4288
03:02:52,391 --> 03:02:53,560
We took the face.
Yeah,

4289
03:02:53,561 --> 03:02:55,720
I put the selfie on instagram.
Remember that shit?

4290
03:02:55,750 --> 03:02:57,310
That's right.
That was a long time ago.

Just think at the moment we took that 
picture.

4303
03:03:28,870 --> 03:03:32,890
We were simultaneously talking about 
this moment reflecting on this picture.

4304
03:03:32,980 --> 03:03:36,190
Crazy man.
