1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,270
He freaks what's going on.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,990
Party people were back.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:07,801
Uh,

4
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:08,311
I've been,

5
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:08,910
um,

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,380
I've been busy squash and so I haven't
had time to podcasts and I'm out there

7
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,790
searching for bigfoot.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,321
What are you doing,

9
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:16,621
Bryan?

10
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:17,070
You're not,

11
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,570
you're not answering
the big foot question.

12
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:20,250
Just sitting here doing podcasts.

13
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,183
I've already made it

14
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,820
come out there for the people.

15
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:23,654
Son.

16
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,910
I'm out there steady squashing.

17
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,320
This episode of the Joe Rogan
experience podcast is brought to you by

18
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,430
Squarespace.

19
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,820
Squarespace is one of our
newest and favorite sponsors.

20
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:38,240
I don't really have any favorites,

21
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:39,350
but I really enjoy this one.

22
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,213
I really like it.

23
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,480
I like everything about it.

24
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,810
What it is is a website that allows you
to very easily create your own website.

25
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,460
There's templates that you can use.

26
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:52,970
There's various images that you can
upload and you can make a really cool

27
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:55,460
looking website including
setting up a store.

28
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,850
You can set up an online store super easy.

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,900
It's,

30
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,680
it's ridiculous how easy it
is and it's cool and it's fun.

31
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,750
You can also try it out.

32
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,780
You can go there and set up a website and
not even have to use your credit card.

33
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:14,481
You just,

34
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:15,050
uh,

35
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,741
try it out.

36
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:16,011
Hold on.

37
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:17,000
Let me just pull this up.

38
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:17,834
I gotta

39
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,271
yeah,

40
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:19,470
it's cool cause they just have all these,

41
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:23,130
does that like you could put together
a website and almost like within five

42
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:23,400
minutes.

43
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,240
Well you have,

44
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:24,841
you know,

45
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:25,500
I couldn't,

46
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,570
it would take me a lot longer
than it would take you but,

47
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,530
but uh,

48
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,980
Brian can whip through one of
those fucking things and it's um,

49
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,090
it's,

50
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,350
I love the fact that there's
someone figure that out
cause it used to be like so

51
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:37,980
daunting.

52
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,260
The idea of creating a
website was terrifying.

53
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:40,440
I'm like,

54
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,970
what am I going to do with this?

55
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:42,450
This is,

56
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,160
this makes it super easy.

57
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:44,950
It makes,

58
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,820
it's really intuitive and
it works on everything.

59
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,110
It works on a cell phone,

60
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:52,500
it works in your iPad or android tablet.

61
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,240
It works on every phone.

62
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,590
It works on every browser.

63
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:56,190
It's just,

64
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:56,580
they,

65
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,490
they've got it down and
it didn't use to be down.

66
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:01,560
It used to be like really
difficult to get a website.

67
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:04,290
But now almost anybody can do their own.

68
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,920
And if you go to squarespace.com
forward slash Joe,

69
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:08,754
you can try it out,

70
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,930
no credit card necessary.

71
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,700
But if you would decide to purchase it,

72
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,110
you use the offer code,

73
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,011
excuse me,

74
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:15,990
use the offer code Joe Five,

75
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:17,910
just Joe and the number five,

76
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:18,744
all one word.

77
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,890
And then you will save
10% off a first purchase,

78
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,680
a new accounts including
monthly and annual plans.

79
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,830
So that's squarespace.com forward slash
Joe and the offer code is Joe and the

80
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:32,154
number three,

81
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:32,911
excuse me,

82
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:34,200
five show the number five.

83
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,300
Don't use Joe the number three.

84
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,860
You'll confuse the fuck out of people.

85
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,461
And they'll think,

86
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:39,240
man,

87
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,260
someone's just really stuck
on those old march podcasts

88
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,320
were also brought to you by Tang.

89
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,100
Um,

90
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,671
if you,

91
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:48,000
uh,

92
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,260
have heard of Tim before,

93
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:51,510
if you've heard of us
talk about on a podcast,

94
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:56,511
one of the things that makes me so happy
is when I run into people and they tell

95
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:01,791
me that something that we're advertising
in the podcast is exactly as promised.

96
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,371
And,

97
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:03,790
uh,

98
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,620
that's one thing that I
keep hearing about ting.

99
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:05,921
It's,

100
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:06,754
it's a,

101
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,980
it's a really good cell phone service.

102
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,450
It uses a sprint backbone,

103
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,020
but it's set up to be a lot
cheaper than most cell phone plans.

104
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,110
And it's set up in a
really cool ethical way,

105
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,210
including if you,

106
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,970
if you don't use the minutes
that you signed up for,

107
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:25,060
they knock you down to the next level
and credit you at your next bill.

108
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,470
They,

109
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,700
they literally give you
credit for anew service.

110
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:27,851
I mean,

111
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:28,684
nobody does that.

112
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:28,970
They,

113
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,920
they don't use,

114
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,450
usually if you don't use your service,

115
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,560
they're like tough shit.

116
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:33,010
That's what you,

117
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,843
you offered,

118
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,853
that's what you bought.

119
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,380
That was your,

120
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,140
your contract was a hundred minutes
a month or whenever the hell it is.

121
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:38,340
See,

122
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,310
I love fucking team.

123
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,881
They're great.

124
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:40,390
It's great.

125
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,751
And,

126
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:42,610
and when we were in
Vancouver for 24 hours,

127
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,444
I use both of my,

128
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,080
uh,

129
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,651
cell phones,

130
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:47,320
one from at t and t and one from a Tang.

131
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,190
And I just got the bill to find
out how much my overages were for,

132
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,760
you know,

133
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,080
using international air,

134
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,273
uh,

135
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,940
eight and t because I was on a shitty
day to plan and I said I was just being

136
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:58,510
stupid.

137
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,343
Uh,

138
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,130
it was 200 and like $70
or something like that.

139
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,120
That's crazy.

140
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:04,720
Yeah.

141
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,190
For one hour for one day.

142
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,140
So we're the king,

143
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,030
which I used a lot actually because,

144
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,750
uh,

145
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,980
it had better service there.

146
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,083
Um,

147
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,073
$17.

148
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,680
Wow.

149
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,513
That's insane.

150
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,480
That's insane.

151
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:17,901
First of all,

152
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:19,010
the tin can make it that cheap,

153
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:21,890
but it's also insane that 18
tickets send you a bill that high.

154
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,700
It's just so,

155
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,870
it's so weird that you'd go over to
Canada and all of a sudden the same rules

156
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:27,440
don't apply.

157
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,820
It's like three hours away.

158
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,190
Right.

159
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:29,781
It takes is three.

160
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:31,460
It takes us five to get to New York.

161
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,061
It's like,

162
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:33,110
it doesn't make any sense.

163
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:34,280
It's so stupid.

164
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,370
I'm so tired of countries and
it's really fucking stupid.

165
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:37,490
Right.

166
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,900
Just at and t even doing that,

167
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:41,390
cause they know there's people like
me that wouldn't cause they watch.

168
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,220
What they want you to do is
they want you to call them,

169
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:46,190
get on a international
calling plan or a data plan,

170
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,100
choose which one you want and
then it would probably be cheaper.

171
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,060
Uh,

172
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,900
but what they're doing,

173
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:51,231
it's like,

174
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:51,501
hey,

175
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:53,320
you didn't call us so we're
just going to fuck you.

176
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:53,960
You know?

177
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,150
I mean we're like tanks.

178
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,461
Just like,

179
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,000
hey man,

180
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,900
strong words,

181
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,480
whatever words,

182
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:59,110
you know,

183
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,000
they don't need to teach,

184
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:00,820
just misunderstood.

185
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,920
They also don't charge
you for teetering either,

186
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:03,820
which is another thing.

187
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:04,571
It's called tethering.

188
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,900
Tethering either.

189
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,070
It's either one of those that
you don't really say that much,

190
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:10,300
but you see written down a lot.

191
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:10,541
Yeah.

192
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,231
It's like something else,

193
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,120
like role,

194
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,170
like some people say
rolfing when it's like,

195
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,550
no,

196
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,383
just rolfing,

197
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,260
the massage thing.

198
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,661
No,

199
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:17,800
no,

200
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,071
no.

201
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:20,020
When you're like rolling
on the floor laughing.

202
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,610
Oh Aro yeah.

203
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:22,301
Roll on the floor.

204
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:23,200
Laughing my ass off.

205
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:23,720
Yeah.

206
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,570
So let's say that I was like,

207
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:24,811
what?

208
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:25,644
I've never heard that.

209
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,090
But people would just spell it out.

210
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:27,820
Yeah,

211
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,570
those people.

212
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:28,980
But yeah,

213
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,420
like like they don't charge you
for a tethering so like that,

214
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,710
which is you shouldn't
have to pay for anyways.

215
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:34,951
What?

216
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:36,300
You have to have a button,

217
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,290
that software button,

218
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,370
it turns on and off.

219
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,750
That's why you have to pay for it.

220
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,071
Yeah.

221
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:41,720
You have the same amount of data.

222
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,000
What do you care if I use it
off my phone or my laptop?

223
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,391
Right.

224
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:45,020
I'm on,

225
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,430
I have the phone I bought.

226
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:47,090
This is my phones.

227
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,380
It's not wearing out the phone,

228
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,140
you know it's not doing,

229
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,881
there's no reason.

230
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:51,860
But you know with the Tang
they give it to you for free,

231
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,970
which is how it should be.

232
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,251
Yeah.

233
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:55,040
It was a gift free voicemail and stuff.

234
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,840
It comes with free stuff.

235
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,950
It's ethical company

236
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,641
and it's,

237
00:05:58,641 --> 00:05:59,061
it's a,

238
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:01,160
it's a fair company and
they have great phones.

239
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,080
They have the coolest android phones,

240
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:05,390
including the Samsung Galaxy note too,

241
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,950
which is that big giant thing.

242
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,880
That's the one that you,

243
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,520
I mean you really read websites on it,

244
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,403
take pictures with it.

245
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,610
You can watch movies on it
and want looking at your
photos on it as a completely

246
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:15,590
different experience than a smaller phone.

247
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,131
You know,

248
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:16,970
the people that try it,

249
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:17,211
it's,

250
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,730
it's a pain in the ass
for people to get used to,

251
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,730
but once they try it and they
get used to that giant screen,

252
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,910
you don't ever want to go back to
a little tiny babies Christmas.

253
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:25,880
Oh,

254
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,870
they have the galaxy s four.

255
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:27,110
Now.

256
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,621
I want it.

257
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,070
Yeah,

258
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,960
it's amazing the,

259
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:29,161
uh,

260
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:30,710
the technology that's available today,

261
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,790
but you don't,

262
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,780
the point is you don't have to lose
technology to use the tink service.

263
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,240
It's a,

264
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,860
it's cheap.

265
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,693
It's awesome.

266
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,580
And if you go to rogan.ting.com,

267
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:44,150
you will save 25 bucks
off of either one of your,

268
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,510

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,770
new cell phones or,

270
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:46,604
or the service.

271
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,900
So go and check it out.

272
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:48,734
You're freaks.

273
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,311
Uh,

274
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:51,620
we're also brought to you
by [inaudible] dot com,

275
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,653
um,

276
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,151
if you,

277
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:53,984
uh,

278
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,700
have never been on it.com,

279
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,713
it's a,

280
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,840
the best way to describe it as a,

281
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:00,440
it's a human performance website.

282
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,431
And Damn,

283
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:02,990
I tarted doing commercials about this.

284
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,660
It's impossible to think of new things
to say about art if you've never heard of

285
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,494
it before though.

286
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,071
Uh,

287
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:14,930
it's a company that we sounded like
kettle bells and battle ropes and vitamins

288
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:17,970
and it's all like stuff that is uh,

289
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,020
designed to help human performance.

290
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,950
Whether it's your endurance with
shroom tech sport or whether it's,

291
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:25,521
you know,

292
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:29,600
physical strength with things
like battle ropes or maces.

293
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,950
And I know at Macy's and clubs they look
like weapons but they're not weapons.

294
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:34,970
Okay.

295
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,803
They're not,

296
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,190
they're just exercise equipment and it's
exercise equipment that mimics the use

297
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:41,870
of weapons because believe it or not,

298
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:44,320
like those dudes had to
like swing swords of you.

299
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:46,730
You have to live in game of Thrones time.

300
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,850
You have to be strong as shit man to
be able to swing a big giant piece of

301
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:50,684
metal.

302
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,870
And when you not advocating any sword use,

303
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,120
but I'm saying when you
use something like that,

304
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:02,140
like a steel mace or a steel club using
these a weapon like pieces of exercise

305
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:03,260
equipment,

306
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,580
it actually makes you use your body
as one whole unit and it improves your

307
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:08,600
athletic performance.

308
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:09,740
And in other areas,

309
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:10,490
like if you,

310
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,040
if you have a sport that you do
or if it's a martial arts thing,

311
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:13,821
the uh,

312
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:17,390
the strength and fitness that you can
get from a good kettlebell workout or a

313
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:18,260
mace workout,

314
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,221
it really does.

315
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:19,430
Uh,

316
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,600
do you,

317
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:20,810

337
00:09:03,351 --> 00:09:04,300
and the history of the universe.

338
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:05,134
How about that?

339
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:05,951
How about,

340
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:06,170
uh,

341
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,300
there's a small handful of people that I
would have liked to have meet more than

342
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:11,020
you.

343
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,501
And so,

344
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:11,800
uh,

345
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,060
having you on the podcast the first time
was a true honor and a treat and uh,

346
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:16,580
it's a,

347
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,100
it's just cool to be in contact with you.

348
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:19,410
I think you are a,

349
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:20,843
you represent,

350
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,950
represent representative,

351
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,960
very positive and a very unusual force
in the world of art and then the world of

352
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:28,900
consciousness as well.

353
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,381
You know,

354
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:29,920
your,

355
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,610
your artwork is so uh,

356
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,660
moving and so representative
of the psychedelic state
that it actually has like

357
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,560
an effect on people.

358
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,250
You know,

359
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,640
I think your artwork is
probably like some of the,

360
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:48,330
the most accurate psychedelic artwork
I've ever seen and I can't tell you how

361
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:52,270
many people I've been with that have
seen your artwork or seeing one of your

362
00:09:52,271 --> 00:09:55,690
pieces for the first
time and just went fuck.

363
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:56,441
You know,

364
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:57,850
like that's like the,

365
00:09:57,851 --> 00:09:58,331
the,

366
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,840
the usual reaction when they
see one of your crazier pieces.

367
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:02,501
Like,

368
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:02,760
uh,

369
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,860
the one that's like the one that I always
think of when I think of you as these

370
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:06,970
three faces,

371
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:11,260
they look like Egyptian sort of pharaoh
type faces and they're all three.

372
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,030
One is facing forward and two on the
sides and it just seems like a DMT trip.

373
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,560
It seems like you're tripping
when you're watching it.

374
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,460
Right?

375
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,293
Yeah.

376
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,360
It's an attempt to point to that the
embeddedness that we are in time,

377
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:28,150
the flow of time,

378
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,290
and yet there is always
a timeless being that,

379
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,920
uh,

380
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,060
we also are the witness of that,

381
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,453
um,

382
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,970
being in time.

383
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,830
Why is it so terrifying?

384
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,100
Because we are in time
and there's a countdown,

385
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:45,820
you know,

386
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,451
there's a,

387
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:46,961
you know,

388
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:48,630
where none of us get out alive,

389
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,121
et Cetera,

390
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:50,540
et Cetera to do,

391
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,801
do,

392
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:51,101
do,

393
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:51,291
do,

394
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:51,760
do.

395
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,300
Yeah.

396
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,110
Hey Ray.

397
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,501
Hey,

398
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:54,334
we love you.

399
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,300
Yeah.

400
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,133
Mm.

401
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,730
Yeah.

402
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:56,910
Just

403
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,743
past.

404
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,320
Um,

405
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,651
it's,

406
00:10:58,651 --> 00:10:59,140
um,

407
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,140
it really is a weird thing though to see
it so clearly captured in artwork and

408
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,350
it's one of the weirdest
things that people point to
when they point to a either

409
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:12,030
ancient religious art or,

410
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,350
you know,

411
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,910
just various,

412
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:15,090
uh,

413
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:15,630
things that were,

414
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,520
it's hard to find you,

415
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:17,970
uh,

416
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,770
evidence of psychedelic use.

417
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:21,090
And there are like,

418
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,953
they didn't,

419
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,481
it's,

420
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,580
it's hard to find moments where
they cat like this is one is hard.

421
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,000
There's no,

422
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,690
there was none,

423
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,320
nothing like this that
came out of the old world.

424
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,930
And it's fascinating to me because if,

425
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:34,470
you know,

426
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,160
Mckenna was right with this height
be of the stoned ape theory,

427
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:38,720
and you know,

428
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,550
that mushrooms probably
shaped human culture.

429
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,391
It's like,

430
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:46,140
clearly there were long periods of time
probably where people weren't getting

431
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:46,974
that.

432
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,933
Uh,

433
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,690
but there was a,

434
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,740
a continual evolution of the,

435
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,023
um,

436
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,233
uh,

437
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,410
ability to express,

438
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,550
uh,

439
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:05,550
the dimensions of the world
and of the imagine a world.

440
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,950
And you can see it from cave aren't,

441
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,980
which they now believe that even the
neanderthal may have had a early form of

442
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:18,214
cave art.

443
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,980
So it wasn't just the Cro Max,

444
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,401
you know,

445
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:21,730
and,

446
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,271
and the,

447
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:23,104
uh,

448
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,123
uh,

449
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:24,910
uh,

450
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,331
but,

451
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:25,780
uh,

452
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,590
we may have had ancestors
who were also aren't us.

453
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,863
Yeah.

454
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,940
It's the cave art is one of the
weirder things about ancient man.

455
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,030
If you've seen the Werner
Herzog documentary about,

456
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:39,260
uh,

457
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,320
the ancient cave art,

458
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:41,310
I believe is in France.

459
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:41,970
Is that where it was?

460
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:42,450
Yeah.

461
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,021
What is it called?

462
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:44,010
Cave of dreams?

463
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,933
Yes.

464
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,673
Yeah.

465
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,543
Uh,

466
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,170
I actually didn't see it and I've heard
all about it and I really want to,

467
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:52,531
you know,

468
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:53,430
and I haven't yet,

469
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:53,990
so,

470
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,160
oh,

471
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,140
it's one of those things.

472
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:55,470
Yeah.

473
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,220
Did you love it?

474
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,940
Yeah.

475
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,000
I only got a chain.

476
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,291
I was,

477
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,390
I was running out the door when it was on,

478
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:02,580
so I only got a chance to
see it for about an hour.

479
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:06,930
But it was fascinating just the idea
that they were painting these incredible

480
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:09,270
things just close to 30,000 years ago,

481
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,260
40,000 years ago,

482
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:12,960
something crazy like that at
this is some of the oldest stuff.

483
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:17,100
Just this is the idea that you're looking
at something that someone 40,000 years

484
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:17,934
ago drew,

485
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,790
it seems so insane,

486
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,190
but it also seems like a blip.

487
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,820
Really stop and think about 43,000
years to go from that to us from,

488
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,190
from drawing on rocks as being,

489
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:32,431
you know,

490
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:32,731
your,

491
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:37,650
your main form of expression and like
drawing buffalo to 40,000 years later,

492
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,590
taking pictures of yourself and sending
them to people on the other side of the

493
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:41,424
planet.

494
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,220
So it's not that far.

495
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,760
30,000 years is like
really quick to do that.

496
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:48,761
Jill.

497
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,920
Making pictures.

498
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,520
Yeah.

499
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,270
And making pictures is becoming
an even more important,

500
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:54,870
uh,

501
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,340
part of communication.

502
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,970
What do you think that it that is that
feeling that you get when you see a piece

503
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:01,570
of art?

504
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,220
When you see something beautiful,

505
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,100
when you see something that
even if it's the same feeling,

506
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:08,860
for me it's almost exactly the same thing.

507
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,060
When I see nature,

508
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:14,140
a beautiful scene in nature as I
see a beautiful human creation.

509
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,770
So that seems to have no differentiation.

510
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,450
And in my imagination,

511
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:23,440
when I see like a beautiful
sunset or a beautiful forest,

512
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:24,274
you know,

513
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,020
in the mountains in a lake and that,

514
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:27,670
that perfect classic scene,

515
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,790
or if I see a beautiful painting
or a beautiful piece of art,

516
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,960
it's the same thing.

517
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:32,741
It gives you that,

518
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:33,520
wow.

519
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,500
That that's what we're
looking for all the time.

520
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,170
This also expression,

521
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:38,400
we

522
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,270
crave it.

523
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,730
I think it's actually something that,

524
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,743
um,

525
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,920
human beings,

526
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,730
you know,

527
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,730
either secretly or not
so secretly crave and,

528
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:50,930
uh,

529
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,450
looking at other people and in,

530
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,710
and in finding it,

531
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,810
uh,

532
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,170
in their lives.

533
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:58,880
I kind of think that's a,

534
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,250
that's almost an aesthetic,

535
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,150
uh,

536
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:07,150
and spiritual quest in itself to find
the beauty in the moment in every moment

537
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:09,450
is actually a,

538
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:09,820
uh,

539
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,653
quite a,

540
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,863
uh,

541
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,603
um,

542
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,380
profound,

543
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,190
uh,

544
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,270
state to be.

545
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:17,960
And,

546
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,560
you know,

547
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,393
yeah.

548
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,820
It's just such a strange
thing to be able to do.

549
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,331
You know,

550
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:24,530
if you looked at it out,

551
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,350
if you were outside of
human culture and you said,

552
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:28,280
what are they doing there?

553
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,910
They're creating beautiful things and
they'll look at it and get a positive

554
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:32,744
feeling from it.

555
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,643
Huh?

556
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,990
Like that image serves no other function
other than the express themselves.

557
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:39,291
No,

558
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,124
they can't eat it.

559
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,910
They can't,

560
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,271
they can't,

561
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:42,710
they don't make houses out of it.

562
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,340
They're just,

563
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,650
just make it and they look at it and
stare at it and they think it's awesome.

564
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,443
Well,

565
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:47,901
you know,

566
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:49,640
in the back of the dollar bill,

567
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:54,641
they have that some masonic looking at
pyramid with the eye and the triangle

568
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:56,840
floating above.

569
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,920
And so it's an unfinished pyramid.

570
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,070
And I've heard it interpreted as the
individual or the nation is incomplete

571
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,170
without guidance,

572
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:10,430
by higher vision.

573
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,500
And so the,

574
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,070
uh,

575
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:18,070
aspiration for a higher vision is what
distinguishes may be a sacred art and,

576
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:20,470
uh,

577
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:25,470
a psychedelic aren't that aims at a
universal kind of mystical visionary

578
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:30,410
experience and uh,

579
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,590
just kind of fantasy art at,

580
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,820
cause I think that,

581
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,993
uh,

582
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,740
with the widespread use of psychedelics,

583
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,310
uh,

584
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:45,310
so many people have seen these realms
that that's why that it causes a bit of a,

585
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,860
when people see it,

586
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:52,310
sometimes it's because they've
seen it inside themselves,

587
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,650
but maybe not outside of themselves.

588
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,300
Yeah.

589
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,710
It's almost like a,

590
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,510
like a familiar image.

591
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,940
Like even though it's so bizarrely
outrageous and you just to like,

592
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,441
wow,

593
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,490
what have I seen?

594
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,410
I seen this God damn thing before.

595
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:07,581
I'm like,

596
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:08,390
what is it about?

597
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,950
Especially that one with the three heads,

598
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,440
but that one really knocked my socks off.

599
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,670
Yeah.

600
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,170
Yeah.

601
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,920
You're gonna make a
whole building like that,

602
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:16,430
man.

603
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,400
That's what the [inaudible] is.

604
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,320
That's tosh about.

605
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,620
I can't take that with,

606
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,410
well,

607
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,550
it's all the way around.

608
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:27,320
I know 20 foot heads.

609
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,110
It's going to be the coolest
place on the planet earth.

610
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,280
That is,

611
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,780
that is without a doubt going to be the
coolest building on the planet earth.

612
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,760
There's nothing cooler than that.

613
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,190
You,

614
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:38,471
you,

615
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:40,040
you made an Alex Gray building

616
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,890
and an Allison gray building.

617
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,263
Yeah,

618
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,710
it's exactly,

619
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:49,740
this is her writing cred language that uh,

620
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,580
the thing that binds the building

621
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,860
that looks great out of a piece
of the wreckage from Roswell.

622
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,380
That's what I would expect
that writing to come from.

623
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,630
That looks awesome.

624
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,330
If human language that's looks like some,

625
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,350
like something,

626
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,700
someone would get tattooed on them,

627
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:08,660
they wouldn't even know what it meant.

628
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,920
It just looks so cool.

629
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,783
Watch.

630
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,880
I thought you could,

631
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,301
you know,

632
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:15,850
if you had like one head here and then,

633
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,070
and then it could,

634
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,470
it could go completely around the body.

635
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:19,831
Oh,

636
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:24,420
someone will do that and now that you
just suggested someone will definitely do

637
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:24,670
that.

638
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,910
Or You could make a
tee shirt march Sunday.

639
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,380
Yeah.

640
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:27,781
That's,

641
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:28,920
maybe that's a good mood.

642
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,520
Yeah.

643
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:29,651
Well,

644
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,090
are you going to sell t shirts for me?

645
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,380
People would love to have this t shirt.

646
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,214
I guarantee you.

647
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,901
Well,

648
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:36,290
you know,

649
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,880
there's an fee on a t shirt that
we're going to be working on.

650
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,890
We should explain to people what NCR is.

651
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:45,260
If they didn't listen
to the first podcast,

652
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,870
you are built,

653
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,050
you have essentially,

654
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:49,340
you've created your own religion.

655
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,001
You'll,

656
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:50,181
like,

657
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:51,350
everybody has always said that.

658
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:54,620
Wouldn't it be amazing if
somebody created a religion that,

659
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,070
uh,

660
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:00,070
actually wasn't based on anything ancient
or based on trying to get your money,

661
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,260
but based on the true principles of love
and the word that you like to use all

662
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:07,401
the time,

663
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:08,234
God,

664
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:08,580
you know,

665
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,070
you want to take that word back.

666
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,440
You're going to try to take that
word back from the Bible bangers.

667
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,341
But,

668
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:14,174
um,

669
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:14,541
it's,

670
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,050
uh,

671
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:15,910
it's a kind of a,

672
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:20,240
an amazing thing to do and know because
I know you and I know like what you're

673
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:21,050
about.

674
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,690
You're not doing this for
any nefarious reasons.

675
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,700
You're doing it for the perfect reasons.

676
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:29,790
And that's really rare where
someone has a voice and the,

677
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,260
they choose to just go all in like that.

678
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,060
You've created a religion,

679
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:35,894
man.

680
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,733
Well,

681
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,633
it's,

682
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,150
uh,

683
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,890
an orientation toward
the spiritual and yes,

684
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,550
uh,

685
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,110
legitimately essay.

686
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,063
Uh,

687
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,030
religion,

688
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:49,160
because that's a,

689
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:50,420
within the,

690
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,893
um,

691
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,830
embrace of the,

692
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,340
uh,

693
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,600
expanding and evolving spirit of humanity.

694
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,700
We have to start thinking
as a planetary civilization.

695
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:10,330
And the Internet has helped us all
to form an image of a networked,

696
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,660
kind of a distributed intelligence
that goes all around the world.

697
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,340
And that's happened before
people even realized it.

698
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,200
It's already crept up on people.

699
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,951
Exactly.

700
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:25,281
It's,

701
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:29,180
it's now kind of the
ocean in which we swim.

702
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,000
But by making note of it,

703
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,781
uh,

704
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:33,680
we can,

705
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,900
we notice it,

706
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,113
you know,

707
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:37,940
and,

708
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,181
uh,

709
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:39,014
so

710
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,820
by the power of that community that,

711
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,520
uh,

712
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,560
connect virtually with each other,

713
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:48,760
uh,

714
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,650
the Kickstarter campaign
for the building events,

715
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:57,790
the Aan has been going strongly and just,

716
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,840
uh,

717
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,760
creeping upward every day.

718
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:01,210
And,

719
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:01,451
uh,

720
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:02,710
just today,

721
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:04,510
like broke the hundred thousand,

722
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,380
uh,

723
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,790
mark and,

724
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,660
uh,

725
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,660
we're going toward 125 and
we've got about nine days left.

726
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:13,983
So where,

727
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,750
how do they get to this if people want
to contribute to this Kickstarter?

728
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,111
Well,

729
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:21,400
they can go to kickstarter.com
[inaudible] and,

730
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,700
uh,

731
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,200
go and theone.

732
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,960
Where do they put that in the search?

733
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:26,381
I just,

734
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:27,360
I just googled Alex.

735
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,213
There you go.

736
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,823
Kickstarter.

737
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,150
Oh,

738
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:30,470
there.

739
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,731
Okay.

740
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:31,450
Just Google that.

741
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:31,781
Google.

742
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:32,201
Alex grey.

743
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:32,760
Kickstarter.

744
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,593
Yeah.

745
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,421
So,

746
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:34,780
um,

747
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,720
and you were,

748
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,770
what you're doing is essentially
you're building a temple.

749
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,580
You're building a work
of art that it really,

750
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,940
it's kind of fascinating because if
a lot of people who believed that

751
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:52,240
psychedelic drugs are at the heart of
almost all religions and psychedelic

752
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:53,920
experience and psychedelic imagery,

753
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:54,821
um,

754
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:55,061
in,

755
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:56,620
in ancient religious artwork where,

756
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:56,801
you know,

757
00:21:56,801 --> 00:22:00,250
there's the things that represent
mushrooms and shapes that are mushrooms,

758
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,451
these,

759
00:22:01,451 --> 00:22:02,284
um,

760
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,310
incredible buildings that
have been built for religion.

761
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,641
I mean,

762
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:09,640
if you really stop and think about
some of the greatest architectural

763
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:10,474
achievements,

764
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,020
it's been like the most beautiful ones
have been the ones that were created for

765
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:14,854
religions.

766
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,971
It's like they,

767
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:16,451
you know,

768
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:20,410
and it wanting in whatever part
of what they are that is good,

769
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,620
wanting to achieve some higher level.

770
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,240
They've done it with their art,

771
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:25,631
with the,

772
00:22:25,631 --> 00:22:26,500
the architecture,

773
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:27,281
with you.

774
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:30,580
Look at some of the ancient
Roman architecture that's
dedicated to the Catholic

775
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:30,881
church.

776
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:35,080
It's staggering stuff outside of the
creepiness of the Catholic Church,

777
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:36,250
which is undeniable.

778
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,240
And I came from it,

779
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,980
did the artwork,

780
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,410
the architectural artwork
is just masterful.

781
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:42,670
It's stunning.

782
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,140
It's like nothing else,

783
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,483
you know,

784
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,703
Michelangelo.

785
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,633
Yeah.

786
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,570
There you go.

787
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,110
You know,

788
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,660
the greatest of all geniuses,

789
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,583
artistic,

790
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,543
uh,

791
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,480
you know,

792
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,730
architectural and uh,

793
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,740
as paintings and sculptures.

794
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,710
She amazing that any
of those guys tripped.

795
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,833
Well,

796
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:04,500
you know,

797
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,100
he was a neoplatonist and uh,

798
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,970
does that mean well that means he
was an idealist and that he was,

799
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:12,600
uh,

800
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,970
he had just become familiar with the,

801
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,380
um,

802
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,390
we're looking at an image Socrates.

803
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,010
That is insane.

804
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,790
Yeah.

805
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,623
Yeah.

806
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,291
I'm sorry.

807
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:23,124
So keep going.

808
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,790
Yeah,

809
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,600
exactly.

810
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,180
So you spun around a little
bit and got to see the,

811
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,980
the all the heads and it's cool.

812
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,110
That is amazing.

813
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,003
And uh,

814
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,150
so all of these,

815
00:23:33,151 --> 00:23:33,360
uh,

816
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:33,751
works,

817
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:35,790
you're going to be on view in the,

818
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,540
uh,

819
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,680
within Antionne

820
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,210
did,

821
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,370
you could change people's
lives just with these pictures.

822
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,350
There's so trippy.

823
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:46,580
They make you like that one right there
that makes you go what is real and

824
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:47,510
what's not real.

825
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,770
That thinks too freaky.

826
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,650
Yeah.

827
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,890
And what is reality?

828
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,590
Why is that image so familiar?

829
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,260
Cause we aren't connected with everything.

830
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:58,860
You know.

831
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,940
I mean all look,

832
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:00,980
all the mistake,

833
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,560
uh,

834
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,910
traditions talk about
there's only one of us,

835
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,793
you know,

836
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,401
all of them.

837
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:09,234
Yeah.

838
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,100
And so that,

839
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,270
that's the foundation
of the understanding,

840
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:15,990
uh,

841
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,860
is uh,

842
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,210
a sense of oneness.

843
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,770
And uh,

844
00:24:19,771 --> 00:24:24,771
so the idea of the network itself and uh,

845
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:25,580
have,

846
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:25,890
uh,

847
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,000
a planetary,

848
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,200
a sense of humanity is I think wearing
away the a nationhood and nation state,

849
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,290
uh,

850
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,123
ideal,

851
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:38,851
uh,

852
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:39,331
toward,

853
00:24:39,331 --> 00:24:39,710
uh,

854
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,530
um,

855
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:40,651
uh,

856
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:43,020
hopeful and democratic,

857
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:45,000
but we'll struggle for some time.

858
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,160
Was that,

859
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,491
yeah,

860
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:47,840
I think it's a possibility.

861
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,080
You know,

862
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,490
I have hope for people.

863
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,151
I really do.

864
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:50,251
I,

865
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:53,840
and I think the Internet is what gives
me the most hope because I think that

866
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,170
the,

867
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:58,880
it's the first time people who have
ever had a straight pipe to the world.

868
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,680
Everybody has a straight pipe to everybody
else and information is settling and

869
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:07,850
people are starting to understand that
they are a greater understanding of what

870
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,570
constitutes a happy life and how
to achieve happiness and how,

871
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,440
how to surround yourself with
positive people and how to,

872
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:15,980
you know,

873
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,800
how to express yourself in a healthy way.

874
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,630
And that's all the Internet.

875
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,920
The Internet has given people,

876
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:22,311
I think,

877
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:24,640
a way better understanding of,

878
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,650
of life itself than any
generation has ever had before.

879
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,300
And so to have this and to create it with

880
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,213
the Internet,

881
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,563
it's kind of,

882
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
it's kind of perfect.

883
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,170
It's kind of beautiful.

884
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:36,930
Yeah.

885
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:41,820
Like a crowdsourcing
sacred space that is a,

886
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:42,330
uh,

887
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,530
it could only happen,

888
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,130
uh,

889
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:44,963
today

890
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,720
with the friends.

891
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:46,901
Well,

892
00:25:46,901 --> 00:25:48,280
because of people like you though,

893
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:49,390
they're doing things like that.

894
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:51,670
That's one of the
reasons why I have faith.

895
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,950
It's one of the reasons why I think that.

896
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,050
I know a lot of people
gravitate towards your stuff.

897
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,560
A lot of people gravitate towards your
words and they gravitate towards your

898
00:25:59,561 --> 00:26:00,070
artwork.

899
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,220
And I think that gives me hope
that I think that there's a,

900
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,250
there's people that are
trying to put themselves on a,

901
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:07,330
on a good frequency,

902
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,790
and there's people that are not
just people that had just ended.

903
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,640
I have billing negative.

904
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,500
I'll never let it go,

905
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,023
but,

906
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,220
but they're there.

907
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,430
That phase of the chemical,

908
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,790
a journey of healing maybe,

909
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,640
uh,

910
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,090
you know,

911
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:20,923
it's like,

912
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,183
uh,

913
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,173
I don't know.

914
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,010
It's so I think,

915
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:25,750
uh,

916
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,320
uh,

917
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,670
there's a spectrum for sure.

918
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,190
There's a spectrum of fortune luck,

919
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,580
the luck of the draw
of where you were born,

920
00:26:33,581 --> 00:26:34,780
who you were associated with.

921
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,560
Oh my God,

922
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,101
your family.

923
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:36,461
There's a,

924
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,130
that's an undeniable luck of the draw.

925
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,950
You know,

926
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,560
I think every day I grew up
with the people I up with.

927
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,423
You know,

928
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,020
I got really lucky with my parents.

929
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,950
They were really nice.

930
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:47,784
You know,

931
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,010
that's not the case with
everybody and that's luck.

932
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,360
So well,

933
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:51,930
it's almost,

934
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,800
he can't make,

935
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,221
you know,

936
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:54,060
some people are just there.

937
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,450
They're born into such a massive deficits.

938
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,330
I got a few years,

939
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:58,900
uh,

940
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,321
on your,

941
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:00,154
I think,

942
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:00,790
and,

943
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,470
uh,

944
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,180
sh I recently ran about,

945
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:04,870
uh,

946
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:09,040
I Schopenhauer essay where he talks about,

947
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,390
uh,

948
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,223
they,

949
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:15,440
how almost everyone at a certain age,

950
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,330
it looks back on their life and
even events that appeared random,

951
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,440
uh,

952
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,310
during the,

953
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,870
their occurrence,

954
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,070
uh,

955
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,530
appeared to have been faded and,

956
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:26,890
uh,

957
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,890
took them in a particular direction and
that really had become very important

958
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:33,814
for them.

959
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,220
And so it's curious that,

960
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:36,970
uh,

961
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,230
because I mean,

962
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,040
it was like not with
meeting and that was a,

963
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,530
it was like not with taking LSD.

964
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,580
Uh,

965
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,390
it was,

966
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,223
um,

967
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,693
you know,

968
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,680
their momentous and a
life changing kind of,

969
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,633
uh,

970
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,640
occurrences and they can turn you from a,

971
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,930
a sour,

972
00:27:59,290 --> 00:27:59,950
uh,

973
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:04,950
and a suicidal person to a person
that has a love for life and a,

974
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,553
uh,

975
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,720
a commitment to trying to,

976
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,713
um,

977
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,240
uh,

978
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,740
leave the most,

979
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,993
uh,

980
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,073
uh,

981
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:18,790
Eh,

982
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,800
the gift that you've been,

983
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:21,723
uh,

984
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,360
sort of,

985
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,193
uh,

986
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,700
requested to,

987
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,163
uh,

988
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,760
to perform,

989
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,803
you know,

990
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,810
the service you've been asked to prove.

991
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,660
What do you mean by that?

992
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,153
Well,

993
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,020
end theone,

994
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:35,620
uh,

995
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,720
is a sanctuary,

996
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:38,920
a visionary aren't,

997
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:44,220
and that's always been our aspiration
is to provide a more on a more permanent

998
00:28:47,711 --> 00:28:48,221
basis.

999
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:48,671
Of course,

1000
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:51,250
that's still an aspiration at this point,

1001
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,113
but,

1002
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,810
uh,

1003
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,320
that we did acquire the
land of 40 Acre property.

1004
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,070
And,

1005
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,400
uh,

1006
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,050
we,

1007
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:58,330
uh,

1008
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,430
do have permission now after,

1009
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,893
um,

1010
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,980
over a couple of years of negotiation and
preparation of site plan and getting a

1011
00:29:09,491 --> 00:29:11,410
site plan approval from the town,

1012
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,080
we now have the permission to build,

1013
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:14,650
uh,

1014
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,483
and theone.

1015
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:16,750
And,

1016
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,583
uh,

1017
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,030
it is,

1018
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,873
uh,

1019
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:25,060
and the Kickstarter has been a way of
connecting with this net of beings that

1020
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:25,990
have,

1021
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,730
uh,

1022
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,563
you know,

1023
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:32,170
also taken on the imagining of it
with us and the financing of it.

1024
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,880
Where do you see this going?

1025
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,030
Do you see this becoming
a n theone like once,

1026
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,230
once the NC on its built would have a
bunch of people want to like move the

1027
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:42,064
property.

1028
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,551
Would you,

1029
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:45,520
would you consider like
you have a guest house?

1030
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:45,860
Yes,

1031
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,530
we have a guest house to receive them
and that is open now for business and a

1032
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:55,531
that we've been hosting a numerous people
that come and stay there already and

1033
00:29:56,861 --> 00:30:00,520
we were open on a more weekly basis now.

1034
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,563
Uh,

1035
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,410
and,

1036
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,071
but it's,

1037
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:05,050
it's just a beautiful time of the year.

1038
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,530
It's,

1039
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,070
and uh,

1040
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,240
there's wisdom trails.

1041
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:10,780
You can walk around and there's some art
in the House and the cosmic Christ is

1042
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:11,120
there.

1043
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,150
How far in is the construction process?

1044
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,523
Well,

1045
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,680
we have done reinforcing of the carriage
house around which this building is

1046
00:30:21,831 --> 00:30:22,670
going to be.

1047
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:27,560
The heads are going to be clad and
folks that are just listening on Itunes,

1048
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,770
what Alex's,

1049
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,500
uh,

1050
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,300
you could see it if you go to Alex,

1051
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,350
Alex grey.com.

1052
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,940
So if you go to Alex Gray,

1053
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:39,941
g r e y a.com and go look
at some of the images of,

1054
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,253
it's really,

1055
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:41,761
it's,

1056
00:30:41,761 --> 00:30:42,561
it's the weirdest,

1057
00:30:42,561 --> 00:30:43,101
craziest,

1058
00:30:43,101 --> 00:30:44,810
coolest looking building
I've ever seen in my life.

1059
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,530
And if you,

1060
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,450
you do completely build it this way,

1061
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,880
it's really going to be one of
the coolest things on earth.

1062
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:50,661
I mean,

1063
00:30:50,661 --> 00:30:50,861
it's a,

1064
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:53,750
it's a building that's a work of
art and it's a stunning work of art.

1065
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,850
Have these bad ass.

1066
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,460
It's very interesting because it,

1067
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,670
it makes a,

1068
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,043
I,

1069
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:01,790
um,

1070
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,440
statement and I,

1071
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:08,650
I see it as within a lineage of the
development of different kinds of sacred

1072
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:13,700
architecture and just one
other little but on that tree.

1073
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:14,900
But,

1074
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,290
uh,

1075
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:20,030
it's attempting to point to the underlying

1076
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:26,450
unity of the quest for wisdom and
compassion and all the different religious

1077
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,940
quests and that they have,

1078
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,810
they share,

1079
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,100
uh,

1080
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,420
also in common,

1081
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:32,991
uh,

1082
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,100
the angel of the,

1083
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,540
of creative expression,

1084
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,940
which is the imagination.

1085
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,010
And,

1086
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:39,560
uh,

1087
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,560
all world religions were born
in the creative imagination.

1088
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,510
It with the visionary mystical experience.

1089
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,913
Um,

1090
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,430
you know,

1091
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,480
there was the,

1092
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:51,230
uh,

1093
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,970
the founding of,

1094
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,053
uh,

1095
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,870
Islam on the journey of,

1096
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,793
uh,

1097
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,440
of a Mohammed to the seventh heaven.

1098
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,040
And he encounters many a visionary
kinds of dimensions on the way and,

1099
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,560
um,

1100
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,460
and you know,

1101
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,260
receives his wisdom.

1102
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,600
And you know,

1103
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,870
you have Mary receiving an angel.

1104
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,333
You know,

1105
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,940
you have Moses talking to a burning Bush.

1106
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,890
All of these are visionary,

1107
00:32:24,891 --> 00:32:26,660
mystical experiences.

1108
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,650
And,

1109
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:27,911
uh,

1110
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:31,280
there are the foundations of
many of the world religions.

1111
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:35,780
Mara is dispelled in the
visionary experience,

1112
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,650
uh,

1113
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,520
with the Buddha.

1114
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,510
The,

1115
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,600
the soldiers,

1116
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,320
uh,

1117
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,230
they butted turns the arrows into flowers.

1118
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,010
These are all kinds of a visionary,

1119
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,910
mystical,

1120
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:48,983
um,

1121
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:54,860
contact with an infinite intermediate
realm between the physical material world

1122
00:32:56,161 --> 00:33:01,161
and the transcendental world
and all the really a mystical

1123
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,160
traditions have them.

1124
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:11,180
And we just kind of lost track of him
except now we've recovered them through

1125
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:12,354
psychedelics.

1126
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,330
Do you think that that was the heart of,

1127
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,500
you feel like that was the heart of all
organized religion that originally it

1128
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:24,650
was sort of a psychedelic experience
or mystical of them or experience.

1129
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,450
So it could have been like yoga or
couldn't Delaney or something like that.

1130
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,460
It can happen on the Nache and it,

1131
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,230
and it has a for many,

1132
00:33:32,231 --> 00:33:35,230
but for some fasting and uh,

1133
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,940
there are numerous kinds of,

1134
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,080
um,

1135
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,560
Boston tech austerities
and things like that.

1136
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,370
Uh,

1137
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,970
that could have been a
natural part of life.

1138
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:46,391
Yes.

1139
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,310
I haven't been eating for three days.

1140
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:48,970
Uh,

1141
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,810
but the water is a little
tasting funny and uh,

1142
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:54,190
and Lo and behold,

1143
00:33:54,191 --> 00:33:56,530
there's a vision and an angel appears

1144
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:57,980
would say,

1145
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,131
Hey,

1146
00:33:58,131 --> 00:33:58,401
yeah,

1147
00:33:58,401 --> 00:33:59,420
you're about to die.

1148
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,463
Hallucinating.

1149
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:01,850
Yeah.

1150
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,890
Or just not worth the s and,

1151
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,760
and dob.

1152
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:05,594
Okay.

1153
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,990
Soon so you can go to the edge and see

1154
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,610
the other world as well.

1155
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:11,803
And that,

1156
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,770
you know,

1157
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,600
can be valid as well.

1158
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:15,531
But,

1159
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:16,110
uh,

1160
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:16,490
yeah,

1161
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,323
these people,

1162
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,250
one of the weird things about
psychedelics is people always,

1163
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,370
even if it was one of the most
profound experiences ever,

1164
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:25,110
and one the most amazing experiences ever,

1165
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:26,250
people will tell you,

1166
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,031
yeah,

1167
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,850
but it was just your mind
playing tricks on you.

1168
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,490
Like it doesn't matter
and you can go okay.

1169
00:34:32,491 --> 00:34:34,260
But it's whether it was,

1170
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,730
whether I really did travel to another
dimension and communicate with infinite

1171
00:34:38,731 --> 00:34:42,900
beings that were made out of love and
understanding who told me the secret to

1172
00:34:42,901 --> 00:34:45,390
life is positive energy and positive.

1173
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,790
Even if it was just my imagination,

1174
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,290
I still experienced it.

1175
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,060
I experienced it as if it was real.

1176
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,250
So whether it was real or
whether it wasn't real,

1177
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,870
I can the exact same result.

1178
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,260
Something happened that was
unbelievably incredible.

1179
00:34:58,261 --> 00:35:01,170
It took me to some place that was
infinitely beautiful and then something

1180
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:02,004
happened to me.

1181
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,870
Like either that happened
or it didn't happen.

1182
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:04,830
Well definitely happened.

1183
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,690
It doesn't matter if it was imaginary.

1184
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:08,670
It doesn't matter if it
was only inside my head.

1185
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,190
The whole world comes out
of the inside of your head.

1186
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:12,180
The,

1187
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,230
when were kids.

1188
00:35:13,231 --> 00:35:14,310
I remember when I was a kid,

1189
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,173
they would say like,

1190
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:15,540
ah,

1191
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,740
he's got such an imagination.

1192
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:17,190
This one,

1193
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,720
it was talking about kids that were liars.

1194
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,740
You know?

1195
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,300
That's how people treated the imagination
and the kids would just fibbers you

1196
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:23,551
know,

1197
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:25,680
because that's imagination to some people.

1198
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:25,921
You know,

1199
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:29,310
some people they didn't think it
was something to be encouraged,

1200
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,620
but it's really where
everything comes from.

1201
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:36,270
And that's the weirdest thing about it
is the imagination conjures up an idea,

1202
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:37,104
which becomes a,

1203
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,170
it conjures up an idea
which becomes an airplane.

1204
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,210
It all comes from the imagination.

1205
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,770
Whether it's artistic,

1206
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:44,790
whether it's a song,

1207
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:46,790
whether it's a joke that's,

1208
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:48,300
it's the weirdest thing ever.

1209
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,170
And everybody wants to pretend that it's
so normal and so normally just thinking

1210
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:56,490
shit up out of the middle of fucking
nowhere and creating nuclear power.

1211
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:56,971
You know,

1212
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:57,451
what did you do it?

1213
00:35:57,451 --> 00:35:58,330
You sat down and what,

1214
00:35:58,331 --> 00:35:59,690
you wrote some stuff on some,

1215
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,290
a pad and then you figured it out.

1216
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,460
Where's this all coming from?

1217
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,710
Where's the idea to even
do that coming from?

1218
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,450
Where's the idea that some,

1219
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,600
some guy wants to be like a fucking bird
and put wings on and figure out how to

1220
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:09,961
fly.

1221
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:10,950
And he eventually figures it out.

1222
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:13,740
And now we just travel all over the
world and we don't think anything of it.

1223
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:14,731
I mean,

1224
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:16,650
the imagination is crazy.

1225
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:21,060
The imagination has done some amazing
things for human beings in this world.

1226
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,160
And yet we still don't give
her the credit it deserves.

1227
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,120
It's a,

1228
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,260
it was kind of shocking,

1229
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,591
you know,

1230
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:26,161
imagination.

1231
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:28,080
It's like the most
underrated thing of all time.

1232
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,550
And yet it's the foundation of
our advancement in evolution,

1233
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,670
which news to work hard.

1234
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,310
I don't have a fucking
imagination sitting there,

1235
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:38,990
seen some shit that's not there.

1236
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,503
All right.

1237
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,460
Well I think that that's
the other thing that the,

1238
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,180
um,

1239
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:51,180
visionary experience with psychedelic
sties is it convinces people of the

1240
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,300
existence of the realms.

1241
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,300
And,

1242
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:56,560
uh,

1243
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,190
if a,

1244
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,461
you know,

1245
00:36:57,461 --> 00:37:01,330
suddenly find themselves in the DMT space,

1246
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,350
you know,

1247
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,170
it's like very unsettling perhaps.

1248
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:05,470
Uh,

1249
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:09,310
but then at least you
can see that there is,

1250
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,331
there is a,

1251
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:10,751
there,

1252
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:11,584
there,

1253
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,940
there is an infinite,

1254
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:13,774
they're there.

1255
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,770
And,

1256
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:14,981
uh,

1257
00:37:14,981 --> 00:37:19,981
so this inner consciousness
experience that,

1258
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:20,740
uh,

1259
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,573
the,

1260
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:22,920
uh,

1261
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,140
the one self is having through us,

1262
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,310
uh,

1263
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:31,530
is something I'm just fascinated by it.

1264
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:34,870
I'm fascinated by how the
mystics get at the one,

1265
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,160
do you think?

1266
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:36,641
No.

1267
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:36,860
Listen,

1268
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,120
this has always been a very,

1269
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:38,361
a,

1270
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:41,720
a strange one amongst the
mushroom kind of sewers world.

1271
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,053
Um,

1272
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:47,030
some believe that in
consuming that life form,

1273
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:50,270
which is really closer to
animal than it is to plant,

1274
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:50,541
right?

1275
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:51,374
Yes.

1276
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,970
And consuming that mushroom,

1277
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:55,520
what you're doing is that's
how it communicates with you.

1278
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,503
That's right.

1279
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,850
And then these visions
that you're getting,

1280
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:02,360
this information that you're getting just
almost downloaded to you in a way that

1281
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:04,310
you can't understand or even comprehend.

1282
00:38:04,311 --> 00:38:05,810
Most of it I always described,

1283
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,840
tried to remember what
you're learning on mushrooms,

1284
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,030
like trying to grab fish in a river.

1285
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,010
Like,

1286
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:12,843
ah,

1287
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,620
I can't fucking gravity thing.

1288
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,880
I can't hold onto it.

1289
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:17,840
It's just too crazy.

1290
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:18,710
I'm seeing too much.

1291
00:38:18,711 --> 00:38:19,640
I'm trying to calm down,

1292
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:20,480
but I'm saying too much.

1293
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,070
And it's,

1294
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,630
and then you've sort of go,

1295
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:23,961
oh,

1296
00:38:23,961 --> 00:38:24,231
okay.

1297
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:25,730
This is where everything comes from,

1298
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,810
comes from this crazy place.

1299
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,023
Yeah.

1300
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,380
That endless imagination and,

1301
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:31,820
uh,

1302
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,110
in flowing streams just like that.

1303
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,090
And most of the big ones get away.

1304
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:37,600
Yeah.

1305
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,433
And then,

1306
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:39,970
and then,

1307
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:45,030
and then a few are just life altering
and like the thing that really welded

1308
00:38:46,431 --> 00:38:47,860
Allison and I together,

1309
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,700
uh,

1310
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,533
because,

1311
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,380
you know,

1312
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:55,380
it was my first acid trip in her
apartment that opened me up to,

1313
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,373
uh,

1314
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,130
um,

1315
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:57,520
the,

1316
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,520
the world of light and the world of a
higher possibility beyond suicide and,

1317
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,090
you know,

1318
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,350
nihilism and all that.

1319
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,180
It was out how you were approaching life.

1320
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,700
Yeah.

1321
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,603
You know,

1322
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,070
what do you think the cause of that is,

1323
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:17,100
is that the environmental is a behaviorals
and pattern that you get into pro?

1324
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,400
Well,

1325
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,000
let's see.

1326
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,751
I was 20,

1327
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:21,820
21 and getting,

1328
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,290
uh,

1329
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,420
and probably there's
something chemical going on.

1330
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,270
Hormonal changes.

1331
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,980
I was wondering whether I was crazy.

1332
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,880
Um,

1333
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,713
and,

1334
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,170
uh,

1335
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:37,170
I had a steady diet of a kind of
nihilistic existentialist authors and it

1336
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:44,170
reinforced the sense of absurdity because
I thought that was what sophisticated,

1337
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:44,950
uh,

1338
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,030
artists would,

1339
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,690
uh,

1340
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:46,931
put,

1341
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:48,310
want to put into their work,

1342
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:53,311
was a healthy dose of nihilism and
cynicism and sarcasm and all that.

1343
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:55,030
And,

1344
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,660
and,

1345
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,050
uh,

1346
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,570
yet that also felt very wrong.

1347
00:39:58,690 --> 00:39:59,523
And,

1348
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,041
uh,

1349
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:01,600
so it's very competitive.

1350
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,400
I don't know.

1351
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:03,801
And I,

1352
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:04,301
so I,

1353
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:04,871
anyway,

1354
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:09,250
I was struggling with has kind of
polarity kind of situation and,

1355
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,910
and prone to extremes
and things like that.

1356
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,773
So,

1357
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,321
you know,

1358
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:14,680
with,

1359
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,460
with a,

1360
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:15,730
uh,

1361
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,271
kind of,

1362
00:40:16,271 --> 00:40:17,104
uh,

1363
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,510
my prayer,

1364
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,260
uh,

1365
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,520
in the morning was basically,

1366
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,420
you know,

1367
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,620
God if you exist,

1368
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,753
you know,

1369
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,390
show yourself because I'm tired of life,

1370
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,253
you know,

1371
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,760
at 20 water.

1372
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:30,981
Right.

1373
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:31,840
Oh my God,

1374
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:32,860
that's so crazy.

1375
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,440
And so it was kind of like a challenge.

1376
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,280
It was kind of like,

1377
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,060
yeah,

1378
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,893
right.

1379
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,763
Show me.

1380
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,090
And so,

1381
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,290
uh,

1382
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,460
and I was,

1383
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,420
nothing happened.

1384
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:44,410
It's art school.

1385
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:46,630
I was saying goodbye to my
professor on the corner,

1386
00:40:46,631 --> 00:40:50,800
around the corner comes
Alison in a VW says,

1387
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:51,041
Hey,

1388
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:52,450
I'm having a party later tonight.

1389
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,631
Hey,

1390
00:40:52,631 --> 00:40:53,710
why don't you come on over?

1391
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,580
And the professor picks me up and says,

1392
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:57,761
Hey,

1393
00:40:57,761 --> 00:40:59,440
I've got some clue and acid.

1394
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:00,880
Uh,

1395
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,481
and uh,

1396
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:02,380
so hey,

1397
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,520
I was going to kill myself.

1398
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,600
So acid.

1399
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,320
Yeah,

1400
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,670
what a cool professor.

1401
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,130
You don't get those kind
of professors anymore.

1402
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,660
It was at Columbus
College of art and design.

1403
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,320
You know,

1404
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,121
I was out and,

1405
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:12,700
uh,

1406
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,930
the museum school in Boston.

1407
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,011
In Boston.

1408
00:41:18,011 --> 00:41:18,844
Yeah.

1409
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,003
That's where we met.

1410
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:20,883
Oh Wow.

1411
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:21,520
Yeah.

1412
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,050
And a conceptual art.

1413
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,610
Where's that cars?

1414
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,180
Uh,

1415
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,571
let's see.

1416
00:41:25,571 --> 00:41:26,620
It's on the Fenway,

1417
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,260
you know,

1418
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:27,460
uh,

1419
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,540
near Gardner Museum where the,

1420
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,310
where the Museum of fine artists.

1421
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,530
I grew up in Newton.

1422
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,220
Yeah.

1423
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,053
And uh,

1424
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,080
I went back recently.

1425
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,700
It was a really interesting,

1426
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:37,911
I was,

1427
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:38,780
we were driving around,

1428
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:39,291
I forgot,

1429
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:42,950
like how historic certain
parts of boss God.

1430
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:43,460
Yeah.

1431
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,140
When you look at graveyards,

1432
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,330
graveyards that are from the 16 hundreds,

1433
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:48,111
and you know,

1434
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:49,310
really old buildings like,

1435
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:49,641
wow,

1436
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:50,301
I forgot hot.

1437
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:51,070
Like this is,

1438
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,730
this is a historic town.

1439
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:53,270
Well,

1440
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,510
I always felt very much at home in Boston.

1441
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,060
Did you hang around with any Irish drunks?

1442
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,050
Cause that would change your mind,

1443
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:01,943
the quickness,

1444
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,650
Irish drunks on coke.

1445
00:42:03,651 --> 00:42:04,484
So that's,

1446
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,880
I knew a lot of those
Italian woods as well.

1447
00:42:07,881 --> 00:42:08,810
Don't want to discriminate.

1448
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:13,930
The people that I liked was the kind of
philosophical tradition that was there.

1449
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,800
I loved Emerson friends,

1450
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,280
right.

1451
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,890
And call her and uh,

1452
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,350
and William James there at Harvard
and then later Tim leary and,

1453
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,030
and Ron doss guys.

1454
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:30,130
And so there was a tradition of a
kind of altered states and they,

1455
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,740
they did a lot of the experimentation,

1456
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,690
the original experiments with uh,

1457
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:36,920
uh,

1458
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,740
Walder Panky when he did
the Good Friday experiment.

1459
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:40,161
Waits.

1460
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:42,710
Amazing city as far as education goes.

1461
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:46,220
I think that has more colleges per capita
than anywhere else in the world or in

1462
00:42:46,221 --> 00:42:47,054
the country rather.

1463
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,013
And um,

1464
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:51,260
I also think you think about
it like Harvard and Mit,

1465
00:42:51,261 --> 00:42:52,630
both in the same city that,

1466
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:53,061
what are those?

1467
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:53,960
I mean it's Cambridge,

1468
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,520
but what are the odds of that?

1469
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,020
Cambridge is basically Boston.

1470
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,670
It's the same thing.

1471
00:42:58,970 --> 00:42:59,661
It's like,

1472
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:00,230
wow,

1473
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,270
what a crazy town for smart people.

1474
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,253
Oh my God,

1475
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:03,891
you're so smart.

1476
00:43:03,891 --> 00:43:04,461
Why would they be there?

1477
00:43:04,461 --> 00:43:05,294
It's so cold.

1478
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,303
Well,

1479
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:07,690
it,

1480
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:07,970
it,

1481
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,710
they hunker in yeah.

1482
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,790
And work hard.

1483
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:11,181
Yeah.

1484
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:11,681
That makes it,

1485
00:43:11,681 --> 00:43:12,501
makes you a hard worker,

1486
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:13,370
that's for damn sure.

1487
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:14,690
Grow up with a work ethic.

1488
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,500
You know,

1489
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,041
I grew up,

1490
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:18,350
I learned how to work hard because
every around me worked hard.

1491
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:19,100
Look at you.

1492
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,960
They got lucky now you,

1493
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,100
well for sure.

1494
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:22,611
Trust me,

1495
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:23,690
it was a lot of luck involved.

1496
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,030
But you know,

1497
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,130
throwing up with people in Boston.

1498
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:28,971
It really,

1499
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:31,160
definitely when that fucking winter comes,

1500
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:31,550
man,

1501
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,660
you gotta be prepared.

1502
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:35,090
I'd love California,

1503
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,530
but there's something about it.

1504
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,330
Like I even look at my kids and I'm like,

1505
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:41,870
you know when to do you good to freeze
your ass off every now and then.

1506
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,610
Good to realize that you got to get in
the house because it's cold outside.

1507
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:46,911
You know,

1508
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:48,410
to know that that shit's out there.

1509
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,000
I think there's a humility that comes
with having to deal with weather and

1510
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:54,710
unfortunately as we're
saying this podcast,

1511
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:59,210
a bunch of people died in
Oklahoma with a horrible tornado.

1512
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,273
So you know,

1513
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,030
we had to twisters acknowledge I'll
sound that is and how fucking crazy it is

1514
00:44:05,031 --> 00:44:10,031
that there's a part of the world where
the sky becomes an angry machine monster,

1515
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:11,600
you know,

1516
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,430
spinning wind that picks up Semitrailers
and sends him flying through the air.

1517
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,950
That is how horrific cows.

1518
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,670
What's that move out of Oklahoma?

1519
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:22,120
Well,

1520
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,330
a lot of them can't man.

1521
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:24,680
A lot of this is the problem.

1522
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:28,130
A lot of people are poor and they've
been there for years and the family's

1523
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:28,550
there.

1524
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,160
It's not that easy to just
kind of pack up your shit.

1525
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:31,951
Go to Michigan.

1526
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:32,370
It's

1527
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:36,180
cheaper that Ms. Definitely
more bullets though.

1528
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:36,870
Yeah,

1529
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,240
maybe around Detroit apparently.

1530
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,110
Right.

1531
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,570
Detroit is like the worst place
in the world to be a book.

1532
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:48,300
They say that Detroit is a 47%
illiteracy rate in Detroit.

1533
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:50,160
Did you make that up?

1534
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,701
I just made it up.

1535
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:51,534
That's hilarious.

1536
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,850
It's crazy.

1537
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:56,790
If you really stop and think
about it at 47% illiteracy rate,

1538
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:57,660
like what is going on?

1539
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:00,080
Like who is w no one's paying
attention to anybody like,

1540
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,800
like the cover.

1541
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,060
The government should absolutely
focus on situations like that.

1542
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:09,990
The idea that we shouldn't intervene in
places where it's gotten so out of hand

1543
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:13,650
that half the people can't read like
that should be thought of as an epidemic

1544
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:16,860
because all of those people that can't
read or going to give birth to children

1545
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:18,060
that probably can't read either.

1546
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:22,800
And you have thousands if not millions
of people who can't read and then they're

1547
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:24,990
going to enter into the world unprepared,

1548
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,430
unprepared to communicate,

1549
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:27,480
to exchange information,

1550
00:45:27,481 --> 00:45:29,190
to be able to find things
out for themselves.

1551
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,160
I have to take a bunch of people's
words for things he can't read things.

1552
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,590
I mean there's so much
involved in being illiterate.

1553
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,460
The fact that there's like millions of
potential crazy people that are going to

1554
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:43,461
go through life completely illiterate
in 2013 and no one's up in arms about

1555
00:45:44,101 --> 00:45:44,730
that.

1556
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,020
It's really kind of shocking.

1557
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,340
It is.

1558
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,780
And at uh,

1559
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:49,643
something,

1560
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,700
you know,

1561
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,210
each one of us has to focus
on in whatever way we can.

1562
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,120
Yeah.

1563
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,120
It's hard to make a person,

1564
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:59,100
it's hard to raise a human being.

1565
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:00,270
It's not an easy thing.

1566
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,680
And when we're looking at human beings
that are being raised in like really

1567
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,030
terrible conditions,

1568
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:11,390
and it should be like one of the first
things like the whole world concentrates

1569
00:46:11,491 --> 00:46:13,410
on before you concentrate on,

1570
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:14,550
I mean it sounds so hippy,

1571
00:46:14,551 --> 00:46:17,970
but it seems like if you really
want to have a happy life,

1572
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,550
you've got to be doing more
good than you are harm.

1573
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,200
And there's,

1574
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:25,060
there's gotta be a way to do that first.

1575
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,820
Does gotta be a way to say,

1576
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:27,121
look,

1577
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:29,640
there's x amount of people in
the world that are starving,

1578
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:34,710
let's all globally chip in to try to
stop that from happening so that these

1579
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:38,400
starving people don't have
starving children who never
get a chance to get some

1580
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:40,830
momentum in life and be
comfortable and happy.

1581
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,611
It never comes.

1582
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:44,430
It never comes to just give them a chance.

1583
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:44,541
Like,

1584
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:47,190
wouldn't it be like the most important
thing you could ever do it like as a,

1585
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:52,220
as a race to stop the worst conditions
to stop the worst conditions with Sam?

1586
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:55,410
Kinison had the best bit about that.

1587
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:56,040
Oh,

1588
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:56,880
it was so cruel,

1589
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,350
but it was so amazing what he's saying.

1590
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,630
He's talking about
Ethiopian children have,

1591
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:01,740
they have those commercials.

1592
00:47:01,741 --> 00:47:02,341
He's always like,

1593
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:03,870
you should just fix yourself some dinner.

1594
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:07,620
He's sitting there and it's commercial
and it's like blue cheese help him.

1595
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:08,461
Why don't you send it?

1596
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:08,850
He's like,

1597
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:09,121
cause like,

1598
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:10,080
why don't you help him?

1599
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,580
You're only five feet away.

1600
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:13,500
He's the guy behind the camera.

1601
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:14,650
We've got a Snicker's bar going.

1602
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,151
Not now.

1603
00:47:15,151 --> 00:47:15,690
Not now.

1604
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:16,523
It's not the case.

1605
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:18,150
It was at one of the best bits ever.

1606
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,340
And it's like we have
deserts in America too.

1607
00:47:20,341 --> 00:47:21,820
We just don't live in a mass hall.

1608
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,910
Like he said that we,

1609
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:24,271
you know,

1610
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:25,011
I forget how it call.

1611
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:26,690
Is it something about we uh,

1612
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:27,151
yeah,

1613
00:47:27,151 --> 00:47:27,570
we,

1614
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:28,160
we sent,

1615
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:28,500
we,

1616
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,010
we came over here with your food

1617
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,870
and occurred to us that
we would need food if you,

1618
00:47:32,871 --> 00:47:36,880
people would move where the food is
like you live in a fucking desert and he

1619
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:38,650
grabs him when he puts
his face in the sands.

1620
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:39,820
His then is that sand?

1621
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:40,470
No,

1622
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:41,620
it's going to be a
thousand years from now.

1623
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,520
Fucking sand.

1624
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:43,870
It's terrible.

1625
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:44,760
Mean Pill.

1626
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,341
So me,

1627
00:47:45,341 --> 00:47:45,481
see,

1628
00:47:45,481 --> 00:47:46,270
you're all in.

1629
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,850
Even though Kansans dead long dead still.

1630
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:49,030
It's,

1631
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:49,331
Ooh,

1632
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:50,410
it's such a mean bit,

1633
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,210
but it was hilarious.

1634
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:52,900
It was,

1635
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,050
they'd crossed that line
of being fucking mean,

1636
00:47:56,051 --> 00:47:57,150
but so funny.

1637
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:57,400
Like,

1638
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:57,641
Oh,

1639
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,630
you motherfucker.

1640
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,590
Oh God,

1641
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:00,220
he was,

1642
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,040
he was a wild motherfucker.

1643
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:02,980
Sam Kennison.

1644
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:03,890
Okay.

1645
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:04,390
Credit.

1646
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,490
And we were talking about
Hicks before the show started.

1647
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:07,170
You know,

1648
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:08,070
that I,

1649
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,530
we,

1650
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:12,580
we both thought that like Hicks was
like the first truly like psychedelic

1651
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:17,380
comedian who had a psychedelic
ideas that he was putting forth.

1652
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:17,561
It's,

1653
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:17,711
you know,

1654
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:19,090
some of them weren't even that funny.

1655
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:20,950
They were just incredibly profound,

1656
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:21,500
uh,

1657
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,970
that it was in the middle of
some other shit that was fun.

1658
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:25,360
It was what was so weird about it.

1659
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,080
Right,

1660
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:26,830
right.

1661
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:27,490
And,

1662
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:27,910
uh,

1663
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,340
that's how he would drop those meaningful,

1664
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:31,361
you know,

1665
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:36,361
mine bombs into your psyche so
that they kind of melted and,

1666
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:38,440
uh,

1667
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,430
stayed,

1668
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:40,241
you know,

1669
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:40,461
he,

1670
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:45,070
he knew how to kind of stay
in your consciousness with,

1671
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:45,943
uh,

1672
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,840
a new,

1673
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:47,674
uh,

1674
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:48,190
uh,

1675
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,023
perception

1676
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,300
and a lot of his stuff's still holds up.

1677
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:52,390
You know,

1678
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:52,510
all,

1679
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:53,220
I haven't,

1680
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,660
especially if you haven't heard it before,

1681
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:59,370
which I still holds up because what he
was saying about the Bush administration,

1682
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:00,900
the first Bush administration,

1683
00:49:00,901 --> 00:49:01,734
by the way,

1684
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,131
that's,

1685
00:49:02,131 --> 00:49:02,820
you know,

1686
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,750
that was when he was
railing against the machine.

1687
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:10,170
It's just like you could just take it
and substitute the words and it works.

1688
00:49:10,171 --> 00:49:11,004
Today.

1689
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,490
It worked with George
W it works with Obama.

1690
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:14,761
I mean,

1691
00:49:14,761 --> 00:49:15,121
it just,

1692
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:15,900
it just,

1693
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,733
the material works.

1694
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,540
Just substitute this guy for that guy.

1695
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:19,130
And he was,

1696
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,040
it's still relevant.

1697
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:25,200
And so he gave birth to like a whole
completely different style comedian like

1698
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:25,531
that.

1699
00:49:25,531 --> 00:49:27,930
The style of comedian that
came after him was like,

1700
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,700
they wanted to like educate you,

1701
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,950
which is really weird because
some of them were idiots.

1702
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:32,611
So,

1703
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:32,731
uh,

1704
00:49:32,731 --> 00:49:34,140
there was a on the wall of,

1705
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:34,710
uh,

1706
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:35,340
the back,

1707
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,530
the green room at the Dallas,

1708
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:37,970
uh,

1709
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:39,950
know the Atlanta punchline.

1710
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,000
There's a big sign that says,

1711
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,070
don't stop trying to be Hicks.

1712
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:44,850
Oh,

1713
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,050
quit trying to be Hicks.

1714
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,293
Yeah.

1715
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,260
Because there was so many
guys that were doing that.

1716
00:49:49,261 --> 00:49:50,280
There are so many guys.

1717
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:50,730
Cheng.

1718
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:51,310
Wow.

1719
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:51,421
Yeah.

1720
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:52,020
It was just so,

1721
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,550
it was so amazing to watch that.

1722
00:49:53,551 --> 00:49:54,270
He like,

1723
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:55,103
I mean,

1724
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,480
Doctor Admit Goswami,

1725
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:59,730
he's a physicist on those.

1726
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:02,820
A particle guys had a
funny thing to say about,

1727
00:50:02,821 --> 00:50:03,654
uh,

1728
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,020
about people that were sort
of faking it and he was like,

1729
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:07,681
it goes,

1730
00:50:07,681 --> 00:50:09,090
let them who goes,

1731
00:50:09,091 --> 00:50:13,080
I let them use the word quantum if they
don't understand it because maybe it'll

1732
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,360
have the seek to understand it now.

1733
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:16,840
And I remember hearing,

1734
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,100
I'm like,

1735
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,030
wow,

1736
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,920
that's so profound.

1737
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,181
That's interesting.

1738
00:50:21,181 --> 00:50:22,620
I would've never thought that far ahead.

1739
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,440
Like he's like letting people fake it,

1740
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,090
not calling them on it just so they just

1741
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:29,170
keep looking into it.

1742
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,460
Okay.

1743
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,570
If they're intrigued,

1744
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,940
then why should he be the stop?

1745
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:35,110
Exactly.

1746
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:37,240
Why should it be like you listen bitch,

1747
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:37,931
you know,

1748
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:38,860
you don't know what you're talking about.

1749
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:43,603
Uh Huh.

1750
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,050
Uh,

1751
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:46,530
made a lot of people
were of psychedelics too.

1752
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,400
There was a lot of people that did not
know anything about like heroic doses or

1753
00:50:50,401 --> 00:50:51,360
any of that shit.

1754
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,810
Like Hicks was like the first stand up
comedian to ever talk about things that

1755
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:55,540
way.

1756
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,060
The other ones that would
talk about mushrooms,

1757
00:50:57,061 --> 00:50:57,641
it would be like,

1758
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:57,730
well,

1759
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:57,851
hey,

1760
00:50:57,851 --> 00:50:59,670
we did most rooms and you know,

1761
00:50:59,671 --> 00:51:02,280
we got old goofy and Bobby
thought he was a horse.

1762
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:03,780
You know,

1763
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,070
that's usually the story.

1764
00:51:05,071 --> 00:51:06,000
It was never like,

1765
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,850
it wasn't like what Hicks was describing.

1766
00:51:08,851 --> 00:51:09,151
It was like,

1767
00:51:09,151 --> 00:51:10,200
what is this guy saying?

1768
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:12,440
Because how come it's different than
everybody else that takes mushrooms?

1769
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,390
And I think just,

1770
00:51:15,391 --> 00:51:17,640
it was so interesting and fascinating
when he would talk about it,

1771
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:20,460
that it just led a lot of
people to explore that.

1772
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:22,860
I think he was,

1773
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,090
uh,

1774
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:23,870
another,

1775
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:24,150
uh,

1776
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:29,150
kind of apostle and a a and a
kind of a nightclub setting.

1777
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:29,741
Yeah.

1778
00:51:29,741 --> 00:51:29,991
I mean,

1779
00:51:29,991 --> 00:51:31,330
in digitally still is,

1780
00:51:31,331 --> 00:51:31,601
you know,

1781
00:51:31,601 --> 00:51:32,400
we can still hear it

1782
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,630
words exactly.

1783
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:38,780
Because we resonate with the
authenticity that and the rawness that he

1784
00:51:39,841 --> 00:51:40,650
projected.

1785
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,570
And with a Psychedelic,

1786
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,470
uh,

1787
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:48,300
perspective that allowed him
a kind of brutal honesty.

1788
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:48,710
Yeah.

1789
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:49,081
And,

1790
00:51:49,081 --> 00:51:49,914
uh,

1791
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:50,783
and yet,

1792
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:51,883
uh,

1793
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:56,730
there was something remarkably
magnetic because he,

1794
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,830
he was like a laser about the truth.

1795
00:51:58,831 --> 00:51:59,664
It seemed.

1796
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:00,900
That was what he wanted,

1797
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:01,620
uh,

1798
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,200
to be about even at the,

1799
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,513
you know,

1800
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,393
uh,

1801
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,100
and to,

1802
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,720
to reveal a,

1803
00:52:09,721 --> 00:52:10,554
um,

1804
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,200
I kind of underlying darkness was
something that he was an expert.

1805
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,430
Yeah.

1806
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:19,641
Yeah.

1807
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:20,474
He really was.

1808
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,433
And um,

1809
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:22,040
he,

1810
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:22,490
you know,

1811
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:24,430
he had a lot of references
that he would do,

1812
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,110
use it as material that would
make you seek out of the shit,

1813
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:29,930
like with Terence Mckenna
would call heroic dose,

1814
00:52:29,931 --> 00:52:30,201
you know,

1815
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:30,651
and I was like,

1816
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:31,670
who the fuck is Terence Mckenna?

1817
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,020
And then I started reading about trends,

1818
00:52:33,021 --> 00:52:33,530
but can I go,

1819
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:34,131
Whoa,

1820
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:34,970
this guy,

1821
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,500
holy shit,

1822
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:37,790
I serve food of the gods.

1823
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:38,210
And I was like,

1824
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:39,010
oh my God.

1825
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:39,230
Like,

1826
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,063
where's this Guy Ben?

1827
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:40,720
You know,

1828
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,340
I mean Hicks exposes people or did expose.

1829
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:43,651
Yes,

1830
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:44,360
he did.

1831
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,160
And then once he got
into the mechanic door,

1832
00:52:46,161 --> 00:52:47,630
then you were off to the races.

1833
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:47,990
Yeah.

1834
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,840
Once you start listening to those
Mckenna mp3s that are available online,

1835
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:54,230
you want to talk about something that
will just crack your consciousness.

1836
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:55,581
Those,

1837
00:52:55,581 --> 00:52:55,970
uh,

1838
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,550
Mckenna mp3s of that,

1839
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:58,940
some of those lectures that he gave,

1840
00:52:58,941 --> 00:53:00,570
he just what he thought.

1841
00:53:00,571 --> 00:53:00,661
God,

1842
00:53:00,661 --> 00:53:02,690
I had an a very strange way of thinking.

1843
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,040
Yes.

1844
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,930
I used to think of him as the,

1845
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:06,620
uh,

1846
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,490
the spokesman k for the mushroom,

1847
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:10,813
you know,

1848
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:11,151
that,

1849
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:11,510
uh,

1850
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:14,000
he was kind of plugged in to that,

1851
00:53:14,001 --> 00:53:15,570
but he and his brother both,

1852
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:15,980
uh,

1853
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,960
extraordinary in their,

1854
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:18,794
um,

1855
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:19,820
uh,

1856
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:24,820
intersection with the plant kingdom and
the fungal kingdom and cat Mckenna as

1857
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:25,830
well,

1858
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:25,980
who

1859
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,890
continues to work at botanical dimensions.

1860
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:29,851
The,

1861
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:30,510
uh,

1862
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:30,871
what is,

1863
00:53:30,871 --> 00:53:34,600
it was a story they told
of a lot shoe Hara or they,

1864
00:53:34,601 --> 00:53:34,950
uh,

1865
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,350
they took too much and
Dennis kind of went,

1866
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,330
he went radio silent for a couple of
weeks while completely crazy for awhile.

1867
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,530
Yes.

1868
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:43,891
That they're,

1869
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:44,251
you know,

1870
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:47,880
you're dealing with like dinner plate
size mushrooms and they're eating them all

1871
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,110
day would,

1872
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:49,710
whoa.

1873
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:50,281
What'd you like?

1874
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:51,360
10 interviewed Dennis?

1875
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,333
I'm on.

1876
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:52,591
Oh,

1877
00:53:52,591 --> 00:53:53,360
you've had them all right?

1878
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:53,610
Yeah,

1879
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:54,050
he did.

1880
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:54,180
Oh,

1881
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,670
he was great with the brothers
of the screaming of best.

1882
00:53:56,671 --> 00:53:56,851
Yeah,

1883
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:57,270
yeah,

1884
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:58,860
we talked about is awesome.

1885
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,930
We just talked about psychedelics and
we talked very specifically about the,

1886
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:07,830
the actual science behind the possibility
of psychedelics creating language and

1887
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,470
especially as particularly psilocybin,

1888
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:13,290
and he was explaining how,

1889
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:13,800
you know,

1890
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,750
it would make sense that language
was created through the use of,

1891
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:21,600
of silicide been by virtue of the
effect of silicide when hasn't a very

1892
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:23,970
scientific way that I
can't recreate and traps.

1893
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:24,301
Yeah,

1894
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:24,810
and I was like,

1895
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:25,441
oh,

1896
00:54:25,441 --> 00:54:27,300
I never even heard anybody
say it that way before,

1897
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:28,650
but that completely makes sense.

1898
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,400
Obviously one theory and I don't
understand really what he's saying.

1899
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:33,450
It just sounds awesome.

1900
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:33,901
You know?

1901
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:36,090
I don't know whether or not
there's some science to it.

1902
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,740
Other people might disagree with it.

1903
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:42,741
Let's say that it's a common place for
people to want to express themselves

1904
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:47,220
creatively in the wake of
a psychedelic experience.

1905
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:47,431
Yeah.

1906
00:54:47,431 --> 00:54:48,510
I was going to ask you though,

1907
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,480
why do you think that is that
people would dismiss that?

1908
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,310
Why do you think it is that
people would ridicule that?

1909
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,300
Like someone saying that you actually
learned something from a psychedelic

1910
00:55:00,301 --> 00:55:00,721
experience.

1911
00:55:00,721 --> 00:55:05,010
You say that to the average person and
then they'll look at you with ridicule,

1912
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:05,640
like,

1913
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:05,930
wow.

1914
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:06,691
How did that happen,

1915
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:07,524
do you think?

1916
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:08,873
Well,

1917
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:09,630
I,

1918
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:10,280
uh,

1919
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,340
I have like the,

1920
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:11,910
uh,

1921
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:12,743
listeners,

1922
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:13,230
uh,

1923
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:18,230
to help us think of a word to a Paice
that in the same context as homophobia or,

1924
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,430
uh,

1925
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:26,250
misogyny or,

1926
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,233
uh,

1927
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,141
you know,

1928
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:30,630
something like a racism,

1929
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:31,470
you know,

1930
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:32,130
like,

1931
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:32,700
uh,

1932
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:37,700
why do people who alter their
consciousness or who speak of it inspire,

1933
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,530
uh,

1934
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,363
the,

1935
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:40,920
uh,

1936
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,440
hysteria in people that don't take them,

1937
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,093
you know?

1938
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,140
And he said,

1939
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,553
actually,

1940
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,650
that's a great,

1941
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,483
great line.

1942
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:52,750
Um,

1943
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,051
yeah.

1944
00:55:53,051 --> 00:55:53,440
Well,

1945
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,330
I think that for a lot of folks,

1946
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:55,661
they,

1947
00:55:55,661 --> 00:55:59,350
first of all the equate drugs with bad,

1948
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,070
you know,

1949
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:01,360
they think of you drugs.

1950
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,550
The problem is meth is a drug too.

1951
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:08,830
And meth wrecks lives to
put cocaine fucks people up.

1952
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:09,820
But then there's pot,

1953
00:56:09,821 --> 00:56:10,510
which doesn't,

1954
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:11,410
and then there's mushrooms,

1955
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:12,190
which does,

1956
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:12,820
these are,

1957
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,240
you know,

1958
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,260
they're all drugs though.

1959
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:14,621
It's like,

1960
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,050
wow.

1961
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:15,520
It is,

1962
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:15,881
I mean,

1963
00:56:15,881 --> 00:56:18,430
you could look at some as a food as it,

1964
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:23,490
and it's better maybe to classify some
as a sacrament that have been that

1965
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,770
sacrament,

1966
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:25,360
uh,

1967
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,120
for longer than they were a quote drug.

1968
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:29,260
Um,

1969
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,920
they were a way to that
people connected with the,

1970
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:33,640
uh,

1971
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,080
with the higher dimensions.

1972
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,210
What does the term entheogens,

1973
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:38,600
what is the actual,

1974
00:56:38,601 --> 00:56:38,860
uh,

1975
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,693
translation

1976
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,580
n Theo,

1977
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:42,820
Theo of courses,

1978
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,660
God or the divine.

1979
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:47,780
And Anthea would be the divine within

1980
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:52,220
bunch of dudes that are really do she
just decided the name their son Theo after

1981
00:56:52,221 --> 00:56:53,054
hearing that

1982
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:55,231
my boy,

1983
00:56:55,231 --> 00:56:56,064
the God,

1984
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:59,070
God Deo faulting.

1985
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,913
Awesome.

1986
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:02,050
So that's what entheogenic means.

1987
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:02,830
Yeah.

1988
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:03,880
So it's from the God.

1989
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:04,780
It's,

1990
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:05,613
um,

1991
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:06,340
a,

1992
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,000
a way to discover or a,

1993
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:09,943
um,

1994
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:15,580
a substance that allows you to discover
the God within or the divine within it,

1995
00:57:15,991 --> 00:57:16,540
within.

1996
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,670
I don't blame people that are,

1997
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:19,050
uh,

1998
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,210
that discriminated against.

1999
00:57:20,211 --> 00:57:22,990
So I did dogs if they
haven't had psychedelics.

2000
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:24,970
I think it's just an ignorance thing.

2001
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,140
I think the people have a lot of,

2002
00:57:27,141 --> 00:57:27,310
uh,

2003
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:32,310
bad ideas and then don't necessarily think
it's their responsibility to be right

2004
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:34,990
about something that they
haven't experienced themselves.

2005
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:35,921
And that is,

2006
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:36,251
you know,

2007
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:36,881
in society,

2008
00:57:36,881 --> 00:57:37,750
it sort of is,

2009
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,510
it's looked down upon,

2010
00:57:39,511 --> 00:57:41,850
it's looked down upon to alter
your consciousness like that,

2011
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,580
that if you do it,

2012
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,470
you're probably looking to escape reality.

2013
00:57:44,471 --> 00:57:46,120
That's like the standard take on it.

2014
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:50,660
Yet many of these people would consider
themselves to be religious people.

2015
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,500
Sure.

2016
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,333
A lot of them,

2017
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,480
if you look at the foundations of all
world religions as we've just gone through

2018
00:57:57,831 --> 00:57:58,000
it,

2019
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,240
yeah.

2020
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:58,730
Uh,

2021
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:02,600
we can see that they were based on
this visionary mystical experience,

2022
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:06,350
which is what we're saying
is a value for everyone.

2023
00:58:06,351 --> 00:58:06,540
Yeah.

2024
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,051
But Alex,

2025
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:08,370
that was thousands of years ago.

2026
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,020
They don't want it anymore.

2027
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:10,680
All right.

2028
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,880
If Jesus came around today,

2029
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,260
no one would believe him.

2030
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,880
There was some dude that was
claiming that he was the son of God.

2031
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,300
You would give wisdom to everybody.

2032
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,070
They'd probably put
them in Guantanamo Bay.

2033
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,530
There's no way they would let that
guy just run around running shit.

2034
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:23,750
A lot of,

2035
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:24,220
uh,

2036
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:24,941
people,

2037
00:58:24,941 --> 00:58:25,270
uh,

2038
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:26,103
God,

2039
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,620
uh,

2040
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,800
inspired people are on the loose,

2041
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:29,634
you know,

2042
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:31,300
they're just like spores.

2043
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:31,860
Yeah,

2044
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,551
absolutely.

2045
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:33,160
But there's,

2046
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,830
but the idea of the one,

2047
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,320
a messiah coming back,

2048
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:39,840
a Magical Messiah with power
to branch out from the dead.

2049
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:40,900
Did I,

2050
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:45,040
did I already say my theory
about the second coming?

2051
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,110
No.

2052
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:46,500
Okay.

2053
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,170
I love to hear it.

2054
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:48,730
You're smiling like a
little kid right now.

2055
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:49,120
Okay.

2056
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,940
Cause I thought I repeat myself endlessly,

2057
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:52,420
but,

2058
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,050
uh,

2059
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:55,750
welcome to the podcast we do here.

2060
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:58,090
Okay.

2061
00:58:58,090 --> 00:58:59,710
So the,

2062
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,750
the first coming of Christ,

2063
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:02,530
uh,

2064
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:05,350
was the revelation of the,

2065
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,520
uh,

2066
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,110
connection of,

2067
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:08,680
uh,

2068
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:08,840
uh,

2069
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,040
of basically of the divinity of humanity.

2070
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,953
Right?

2071
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,280
That was the revelation.

2072
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:16,960
And,

2073
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,793
uh,

2074
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:18,663
the,

2075
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:19,563
uh,

2076
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,650
second coming,

2077
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:21,740
uh,

2078
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:22,490
through,

2079
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:22,650
uh,

2080
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:24,860
kind of idiosyncratic,

2081
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:25,883
uh,

2082
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,063
uh,

2083
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,093
tradition,

2084
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:28,791
uh,

2085
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:29,624
that is,

2086
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:29,960
uh,

2087
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,750
coming out of the,

2088
00:59:31,751 --> 00:59:32,390
uh,

2089
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:33,410
South America.

2090
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:39,100
A lot of IOWASCA churches
all over the world are,

2091
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:40,363
um,

2092
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:42,283
drinking,

2093
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:42,770
uh,

2094
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:45,920
and contacting this higher dimension,

2095
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:46,490
uh,

2096
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:47,780
through the IOWASCA.

2097
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,100
And,

2098
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:49,700
uh,

2099
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,533
I called,

2100
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,910
I in no demeaning way,

2101
00:59:52,911 --> 00:59:54,770
I call it the green Jesus,

2102
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:55,760
uh,

2103
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,580
because,

2104
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,130
and Grain Mary really,

2105
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:58,700
uh,

2106
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,410
because it's,

2107
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:01,070
uh,

2108
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:06,070
revealing the divinity of nature and
there's nothing more important right now.

2109
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,090
Uh,

2110
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:13,090
then recognizing the divinity and the
sacredness of nature and saving the life

2111
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,330
web in whatever ways we can,

2112
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,560
uh,

2113
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:23,360
somehow turning our ship around
from a self destructive species.

2114
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:24,171
You know,

2115
01:00:24,171 --> 01:00:26,360
this is the tight place where heading into

2116
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:27,501
it is,

2117
01:00:27,501 --> 01:00:28,640
but it isn't always been linked.

2118
01:00:28,641 --> 01:00:28,881
US,

2119
01:00:28,881 --> 01:00:31,340
isn't this the Yin and the
Yang that makes people human?

2120
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,320
Perhaps the pushing the pole.

2121
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:37,140
Sometimes we need to rally
against an impending doom pod.

2122
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:37,993
I know it's,

2123
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,950
it's a part of being a person.

2124
01:00:39,951 --> 01:00:40,790
We're goofy.

2125
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:45,850
We don't want to cram for tests where
we're adolescent species and wildly

2126
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:46,880
destructive.

2127
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:47,700
Yeah.

2128
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:48,031
Uh,

2129
01:00:48,031 --> 01:00:51,180
we only exist through the grace of the,

2130
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,170
um,

2131
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:52,570
the,

2132
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:56,490
the kinds of spirits that are
tolerant because we're so creative.

2133
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:57,570
I think that,

2134
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,640
and they hope that we will,

2135
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:00,440
uh,

2136
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:00,600
uh,

2137
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,930
work on this together with
the intelligence that's,

2138
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,910
that's seeding today.

2139
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:10,440
And we've also been born in a super
lucky spot as far as the history of

2140
01:01:10,441 --> 01:01:11,130
humanity.

2141
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:13,620
We didn't have to go through the
people trying to make it across the,

2142
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:17,370
the West with wagon trains and we
didn't have to go through any of that.

2143
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,230
We were lucky we have internet.

2144
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:24,830
Perhaps we'll be loading in
some astral dimension and they,

2145
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,093
uh,

2146
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:30,090
in the next lifetime
that's possible to do you,

2147
01:01:30,091 --> 01:01:31,080
do you have,

2148
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,570
do you feel you have
a responsibility from,

2149
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:35,103
you know,

2150
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:35,671
your,

2151
01:01:35,671 --> 01:01:35,941
your,

2152
01:01:35,941 --> 01:01:37,200
the fact that you have this,

2153
01:01:37,201 --> 01:01:37,570
uh,

2154
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:37,930
this,

2155
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:41,790
this voice and you are looked at as
this sort of psychedelic visionary guy.

2156
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:46,470
Do you feel like you have a responsibility
to try to get information out?

2157
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:47,940
Things that you've learned,

2158
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,490
things that you think
possibly could help people?

2159
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,080
Cause you obviously have a vision of
things and you obviously have a very well

2160
01:01:55,081 --> 01:01:59,070
thought out view of humanity
and of consciousness.

2161
01:01:59,540 --> 01:01:59,871
Do you,

2162
01:01:59,871 --> 01:02:02,670
do you feel that you have an
obligation to express these thoughts?

2163
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:08,330
I think that anyone who experiences the
deeper realms maybe as it turned about

2164
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:13,320
and their conscience,

2165
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:15,570
it's not just about higher consciousness,

2166
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,440
but there's a,

2167
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:20,870
a sense that if you're connected
everyone and with everything,

2168
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,660
then what's your moral
responsibility or your ethical,

2169
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:25,470
uh,

2170
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:30,030
response to your interconnectedness.

2171
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,080
And so,

2172
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:32,643
uh,

2173
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,370
if there's a bunch of hippies just
took their pants off right now,

2174
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:38,180
it's like I can't take it to the love.

2175
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,001
It's too much love,

2176
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:39,834
man.

2177
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:42,523
Well,

2178
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:43,733
I think that,

2179
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:44,370
uh,

2180
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:49,370
there's a natural resistance to allowing
it to be as magnificent as it actually

2181
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:50,664
is.

2182
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:52,440
Also a fear of the unknown too.

2183
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,101
Totally.

2184
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:54,330
And people that haven't had it,

2185
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,550
I think that that's
why I don't fault them.

2186
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,380
The ones who are anti,

2187
01:02:58,980 --> 01:02:59,251
you know,

2188
01:02:59,251 --> 01:03:01,500
a lot of people associate drugs
with you're ruining your life,

2189
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,450
not with saving your life.

2190
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:05,370
They're capable of both.

2191
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:06,481
Totally.

2192
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:07,380
In my case,

2193
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:12,410
it was the other was the saving my life
and meeting my wife and 39 years later,

2194
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:13,884
here we are.

2195
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:14,700
You know,

2196
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:19,320
whatever seed was born
in the saving of a life,

2197
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,393
uh,

2198
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:21,090
and uh,

2199
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:21,421
you know,

2200
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:23,970
giving a literal turning point and saying,

2201
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:24,300
you know,

2202
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,680
can you see me now?

2203
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:26,590
You know,

2204
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:26,801
well,

2205
01:03:26,801 --> 01:03:30,040
switch literally was turned on
and you became a different person.

2206
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,410
Like shedding a,

2207
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:33,050
uh,

2208
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:34,870
a cocoon and the,

2209
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:35,440
you know,

2210
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,410
Caterpillar becomes a
butterfly or whatever the fuck
happens whenever you have a

2211
01:03:38,411 --> 01:03:39,700
really profound experience.

2212
01:03:39,701 --> 01:03:41,530
But some people don't do that.

2213
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:42,364
Some people do.

2214
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,060
They,

2215
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:46,150
this is what I say is that a really
profound psychedelic experience like

2216
01:03:46,151 --> 01:03:46,661
control,

2217
01:03:46,661 --> 01:03:46,961
alt,

2218
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:51,760
delete for your consciousness where your
brain can reboots the fresh operating

2219
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:56,710
system and there's only one folder on the
desktop and the desktop folder says my

2220
01:03:56,711 --> 01:03:57,580
old bullshit.

2221
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,840
And you can either open it up and go
right back into these predetermined

2222
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:05,860
patterns of behavior once a psychedelic
experience has faded because it be more

2223
01:04:05,861 --> 01:04:06,651
comfortable that way.

2224
01:04:06,651 --> 01:04:10,960
Then sort of reassessing the way you've
been living your life or you know,

2225
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:16,060
you can hit delete and try to
keep going and do DMT again.

2226
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:19,630
Trying to get right back there
right when it stops being fresh.

2227
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,160
Just reintroduced that my,

2228
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:21,461
Oh,

2229
01:04:21,461 --> 01:04:22,211
there it is.

2230
01:04:22,211 --> 01:04:22,481
Okay.

2231
01:04:22,481 --> 01:04:22,961
I got it.

2232
01:04:22,961 --> 01:04:23,171
Okay.

2233
01:04:23,171 --> 01:04:23,960
Thanks.

2234
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:24,793
They're sandbags.

2235
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:27,290
Evolutionary toe hold that,

2236
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:27,711
uh,

2237
01:04:27,711 --> 01:04:28,544
you can,

2238
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:29,413
uh,

2239
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:30,020
uh,

2240
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:35,020
shine our light toward your future
that you're headed toward a rather than

2241
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:37,460
depend on the,

2242
01:04:37,461 --> 01:04:37,770
uh,

2243
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:40,520
effects of past behavior.

2244
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,390
Wow.

2245
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:42,601
Yeah.

2246
01:04:42,601 --> 01:04:43,980
You know what's been
really tripping me out,

2247
01:04:43,981 --> 01:04:48,000
it was how many people that I know that
are starting to have a semi at least

2248
01:04:48,001 --> 01:04:49,980
psychedelic experiences from doing yoga.

2249
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:51,540
You know,

2250
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:56,160
I've had maybe one time in my life or
I did yoga and I felt like I was high.

2251
01:04:56,161 --> 01:04:59,400
I felt like I was high on marijuana and
that's what it felt like at the end of

2252
01:04:59,401 --> 01:04:59,491
it.

2253
01:04:59,491 --> 01:04:59,881
It was like,

2254
01:04:59,881 --> 01:05:00,361
wow.

2255
01:05:00,361 --> 01:05:02,550
It's just like whatever
it is that you've stepped,

2256
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:06,510
that switch that you can hit when you do
the right poses for the right amount of

2257
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:08,190
time with the right amount of energy.

2258
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:11,640
There's a weird switch that you hit
at the end where I was literally high.

2259
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:13,650
But that's as far as I've ever taken it.

2260
01:05:13,651 --> 01:05:15,420
I've never had a hallucination.

2261
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,770
I've never actually projected,

2262
01:05:17,771 --> 01:05:18,280
I've never,

2263
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:22,540
but I have heard some of the fucking
craziest things from people that practice

2264
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:26,410
Kundalini Yoga that if I didn't know
them really well and the way they were

2265
01:05:26,411 --> 01:05:27,101
telling it to me,

2266
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:29,080
it's like so matter of factly.

2267
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,150
I would say this guy's crazy.

2268
01:05:31,151 --> 01:05:34,860
He's just making up a bunch of shit
except for the one time that I got myself

2269
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:36,520
high cause I was really high.

2270
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,110
I mean I was high.

2271
01:05:38,111 --> 01:05:39,070
I felt great.

2272
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,750
I had love in my heart.

2273
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,520
I wanted to hug people.

2274
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:42,860
I,

2275
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:44,740
I felt like colors were brighter,

2276
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:46,090
sounds were cleaner.

2277
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:47,740
I really felt really high.

2278
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:48,521
And,

2279
01:05:48,521 --> 01:05:48,710
uh,

2280
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:50,740
it was just from doing
yoga and I was like,

2281
01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:51,940
if that's possible,

2282
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:52,391
I,

2283
01:05:52,391 --> 01:05:52,690
I've,

2284
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:55,680
I've never really continually
practice Kundalini,

2285
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,150
but the people who really get into,

2286
01:05:57,151 --> 01:05:57,580
yeah,

2287
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:59,170
Pranayama is and all that,

2288
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:04,000
they say that there's a wave length that
you can hit where you tap into that,

2289
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:04,961
whatever it is,

2290
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,160
the pineal gland,

2291
01:06:06,161 --> 01:06:06,581
whatever it is,

2292
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:08,620
the DMT factory and just shot,

2293
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:09,603
boom,

2294
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:11,800
open up the doorway and
punch right through.

2295
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,450
And that you can do it through yoga.

2296
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:14,150
Yes,

2297
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:14,840
absolutely.

2298
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,800
You've done three yoga.

2299
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,793
Uh,

2300
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:18,163
yes.

2301
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:19,370
And there are different,

2302
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:19,910
uh,

2303
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:21,380
kind to like the,

2304
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,200
you could have the idea for
[inaudible] to be honest with you,

2305
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:27,050
for Antionne really came,

2306
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:27,943
came about.

2307
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:28,671
First of all,

2308
01:06:28,671 --> 01:06:29,270
through,

2309
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:30,103
uh,

2310
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:34,940
Alison and I had a routine of
a yoga and then meditation.

2311
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:35,781
And,

2312
01:06:35,781 --> 01:06:36,020
uh,

2313
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,220
during that period,

2314
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:38,443
basically,

2315
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:39,200
uh,

2316
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,220
instead of like kind of forcing
myself to imagine something,

2317
01:06:43,221 --> 01:06:44,054
I was saying,

2318
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,133
well,

2319
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:45,651
God,

2320
01:06:45,651 --> 01:06:46,520
what do you want?

2321
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,510
You know,

2322
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,520
what would you like me to put on?

2323
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:50,600
Uh,

2324
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,380
there?

2325
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,940
And so it showed this,

2326
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:56,180
the inner connected kind
of God had type thing.

2327
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,033
It's perfect.

2328
01:06:58,340 --> 01:06:59,360
So God's on it.

2329
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,480
Okay.

2330
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:01,760
Mail.

2331
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,020
Just do something like that.

2332
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:03,891
Yeah,

2333
01:07:03,891 --> 01:07:04,470
come on.

2334
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:05,303
Here it is.

2335
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:05,901
Okay,

2336
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:06,734
thank you.

2337
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:07,460
So,

2338
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,210
you know,

2339
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:08,750
uh,

2340
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:10,070
that's on the notch,

2341
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,060
I guess.

2342
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:11,601
You know,

2343
01:07:11,601 --> 01:07:11,881
I mean,

2344
01:07:11,881 --> 01:07:12,000
yeah.

2345
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,080
Or not on the Nache ever,

2346
01:07:13,081 --> 01:07:13,351
dude,

2347
01:07:13,351 --> 01:07:14,041
let's be honest.

2348
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:14,874
Exactly.

2349
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,240
You're so psychedelic anyway from point a,

2350
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:18,521
you're,

2351
01:07:18,521 --> 01:07:19,680
you naturally psychedelic.

2352
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:20,761
And then on top of that,

2353
01:07:20,761 --> 01:07:21,600
all the things you've done,

2354
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:24,410
how could you ever pretend
that you ever on the notch,

2355
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:26,490
if you're experienced too
much to be on the match?

2356
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,180
Well,

2357
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:32,980
your reference point is
now more cosmic then,

2358
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:33,933
uh,

2359
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,193
sort of,

2360
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,513
uh,

2361
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:37,383
isolated.

2362
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:38,080
Yes.

2363
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:42,730
And you feel more connected
with people because,

2364
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:44,710
and it must happen to you.

2365
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:46,043
Um,

2366
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:48,220
you have a community,

2367
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,840
you have,

2368
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:50,690
uh,

2369
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:51,070
uh,

2370
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:56,070
met with many of the people that come
out to see you over your tour and things

2371
01:07:56,171 --> 01:07:57,004
like that.

2372
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:58,263
Um,

2373
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:01,120
how has your sense of community,

2374
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:01,600
uh,

2375
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,580
evolved in your understanding?

2376
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,750
That's a good question.

2377
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:06,410
Well,

2378
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:08,630
what I've found is that,

2379
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:09,493
um,

2380
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,840
by doing something like a podcast,

2381
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,090
having conversations with people like you,

2382
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:14,541
and you know,

2383
01:08:14,541 --> 01:08:16,550
my friends that come on you,

2384
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:17,061
you're,

2385
01:08:17,061 --> 01:08:18,380
you're sitting,

2386
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:18,651
you're,

2387
01:08:18,651 --> 01:08:20,490
you're putting out like the kind of,

2388
01:08:20,491 --> 01:08:20,750
uh,

2389
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,340
conversations that we're having right now.

2390
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:27,530
You putting these out to people that
live in places where they don't know

2391
01:08:27,531 --> 01:08:28,430
anybody like you.

2392
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,650
They can't get a guy like you
to sit down for three hours.

2393
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,750
I couldn't get you to sit down for three
hours and just talk like this unless

2394
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:34,730
we're going to do a podcast.

2395
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:34,911
I mean,

2396
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:35,744
it probably could,

2397
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:37,010
but this is the way to do it,

2398
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:37,161
you know,

2399
01:08:37,161 --> 01:08:38,870
so everybody can be in on it as well.

2400
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:42,170
But that's one of the best things for me
about this podcast is that I'm getting

2401
01:08:42,171 --> 01:08:46,070
to talk to like these people like Chris
Ryan or Danieli Bolelli are all these

2402
01:08:46,071 --> 01:08:48,290
interesting people that I get
to talk to on a regular basis.

2403
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:48,951
To me,

2404
01:08:48,951 --> 01:08:49,751
that's a,

2405
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:54,020
a beautiful little situation
that I've stumbled into.

2406
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,370
And uh,

2407
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:55,941
for me,

2408
01:08:55,941 --> 01:08:56,541
I'm very,

2409
01:08:56,541 --> 01:08:59,510
I feel very fortunate just to be able
to have all these conversations with

2410
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:00,140
people.

2411
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:05,140
And then now there's a sense of obligation
because I know that people enjoy

2412
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:06,840
these conversations and I want to,

2413
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:07,520
and I,

2414
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,910
I don't want to ever have them think
that I'm not going to do it anymore.

2415
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,080
We're going to keep just going like,

2416
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:12,471
it's fun.

2417
01:09:12,471 --> 01:09:13,161
I know you enjoy it.

2418
01:09:13,161 --> 01:09:13,994
I enjoy it too.

2419
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,320
It's totally mutual.

2420
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,131
Thanks a lot.

2421
01:09:16,131 --> 01:09:17,030
I'm glad you like it.

2422
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:20,120
And I think with that,

2423
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,120
it's with that attitude we've,

2424
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:24,290
we've created,

2425
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:24,650
uh,

2426
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:25,040
this,

2427
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:30,040
this group of people that listen to the
podcast and maybe they've never had like

2428
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:35,720
really introspective
conversations with people.

2429
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:36,111
You know,

2430
01:09:36,111 --> 01:09:41,111
maybe they've never really thought about
living in another part of the world or

2431
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:46,330
maybe they've never thought
about expanding the life
that they live outside of

2432
01:09:46,461 --> 01:09:50,210
this one realm of consciousness that
they've inhabited their whole life.

2433
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:51,740
One way of looking at the world,

2434
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,750
whether it's racist or,

2435
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:58,820
or glutinous or whether they've just
been abusing their body or whether they

2436
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:01,310
just been lazy about getting things done.

2437
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:03,000
And when you,

2438
01:10:03,001 --> 01:10:08,001
you hear a podcast where you get a chance
to see all these different people's

2439
01:10:08,451 --> 01:10:09,650
takes on things.

2440
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:10,460
You know,

2441
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,770
from Everlast a singer too,

2442
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:15,710
my friend Joey Diaz and all these
different people's takes on things,

2443
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:20,090
they're all different and dynamic
and all having access to that.

2444
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:24,110
It's like having a bunch of like really
smart friends around you all the time.

2445
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,300
So if you can listen to these podcasts,

2446
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,040
not everybody's really smart,

2447
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:28,761
you know,

2448
01:10:28,761 --> 01:10:29,150
I'm not,

2449
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:29,983
I'm not saying we're,

2450
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:31,070
we're all really smart.

2451
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:32,360
I'm saying some of them are really smart.

2452
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:36,620
But if you get a chance to have these
interesting conversations and they enrich

2453
01:10:36,621 --> 01:10:40,130
people's consciousness because
you might be stuck in a bad spot.

2454
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:42,710
I've been in a bad spot in my life where
I didn't have a lot of cool people to

2455
01:10:42,711 --> 01:10:43,510
talk to.

2456
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:45,320
You couldn't just tune into a podcast,

2457
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:46,160
you know?

2458
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,980
And so my sense of community is sort of a,

2459
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:54,950
it's one become a thing of obligation
of on an a happy obligation.

2460
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:59,540
But I definitely think we're obligated
to continue to provide content.

2461
01:10:59,541 --> 01:10:59,901
And it's,

2462
01:10:59,901 --> 01:11:00,200
uh,

2463
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:00,520
you know,

2464
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,520
I remember being addicted to radio shows
or different bands when I was a kid and

2465
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,370
you want more stuff,

2466
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:08,660
you want constantly more stuff.

2467
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:09,410
So we're,

2468
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:09,921
we're,

2469
01:11:09,921 --> 01:11:10,670
you know,

2470
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:12,530
that's a big part of community with me,

2471
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:13,663
but it's also

2472
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:15,780
one of the most,

2473
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,490
the happiest things that I've gotten from
this podcast is people coming up to me

2474
01:11:20,491 --> 01:11:23,460
telling me that it changed the way they,

2475
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:26,640
they think about things
telling me that now they're,

2476
01:11:26,641 --> 01:11:29,670
they're happy telling me
that now they eat healthy,

2477
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,250
telling me that now they just stop being
an asshole to people that they realize

2478
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:35,970
they were really just frustrated and
they need to get their shit together and

2479
01:11:35,971 --> 01:11:38,370
then it's over and over and over again.

2480
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:39,151
You know,

2481
01:11:39,151 --> 01:11:40,140
and that,

2482
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,610
that sense of community,

2483
01:11:41,611 --> 01:11:43,560
I mean it was completely accidental.

2484
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:46,630
We didn't set out to try
to create some sort of a,

2485
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,230
a group that sort of tunes into,

2486
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,180
we just hope people enjoy the podcast.

2487
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:53,130
We didn't think it was going to be a,

2488
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:55,240
I know it,

2489
01:11:55,240 --> 01:12:00,240
it's a very interesting thing when do a
group of supportive listeners become a

2490
01:12:01,211 --> 01:12:02,044
community?

2491
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,610
And it's kind of like,

2492
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:04,210
uh,

2493
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:05,500
we see,

2494
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:06,280
uh,

2495
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:11,280
that today people would like to gather
in a lot of different places and,

2496
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:13,960
uh,

2497
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:14,793
to,

2498
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:15,580
uh,

2499
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,190
coalesce for,

2500
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:18,360
uh,

2501
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,590
a few hours and,

2502
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:21,130
uh,

2503
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:23,470
have a temporary community.

2504
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:24,270
Well,

2505
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:26,070
I think we'd like to
have a full community,

2506
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:28,020
but we don't trust people that
knocked at fucking cookie.

2507
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:30,600
Not everybody has their shit together.

2508
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:30,721
No,

2509
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:31,920
you can't just walk into my house.

2510
01:12:31,921 --> 01:12:32,680
You might be nuts.

2511
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,040
And that's true.

2512
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:35,221
By the way.

2513
01:12:35,221 --> 01:12:35,701
I'm tired.

2514
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:36,421
I just got home from work.

2515
01:12:36,421 --> 01:12:37,470
I'd really like to just watch TV.

2516
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:38,520
I don't want you to come over my house.

2517
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:40,650
So there's a certain boundary
that we all have to set up.

2518
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:44,710
That's why the church model of the,

2519
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:45,251
uh,

2520
01:12:45,251 --> 01:12:45,520
you know,

2521
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,820
there's a time when you
devote some time to,

2522
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:49,180
uh,

2523
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:50,020
this other thing too,

2524
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,041
that's going on,

2525
01:12:51,041 --> 01:12:56,041
that's more of a community thing and
that's why I ask about it because it's

2526
01:12:57,971 --> 01:13:00,760
something that we've been
thinking about a lot.

2527
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,480
It's going to happen on its own.

2528
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,330
It's a,

2529
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:04,290
people are going to gravitate.

2530
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:04,771
I told you,

2531
01:13:04,771 --> 01:13:05,460
although the,

2532
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:08,610
all the fringe people all over
the planet are coming to you.

2533
01:13:08,611 --> 01:13:12,210
My friend [inaudible] going to
zoom in on it along with some cops.

2534
01:13:12,211 --> 01:13:12,900
Probably.

2535
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:15,540
You're going to get some undercover cops
that are going to try to pretend to be

2536
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:19,160
your friends and try to get deep into
the organization and find out you're for

2537
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:19,830
real.

2538
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:21,150
And then eventually
they'll admit it to you.

2539
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:22,280
It'll give him some acid.

2540
01:13:22,281 --> 01:13:23,114
I'll tell you they're a cop.

2541
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:24,270
No apologize.

2542
01:13:24,271 --> 01:13:25,600
And you'll say it's
okay and you'll give up.

2543
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,140
I don't,

2544
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:26,980
we don't cry.

2545
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,190
Give anything to anyone really.

2546
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:30,910
Uh,

2547
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:33,280
I'm saying advocate that much.

2548
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:36,280
We do tell the truth
about what happened to us.

2549
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:37,890
And I'm a,

2550
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,940
and I'm of the belief that,

2551
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:40,883
uh,

2552
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,780
the discovery of,

2553
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:47,230
of LSD 70 years ago this year,

2554
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,310
um,

2555
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:48,850
is,

2556
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:49,360
uh,

2557
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:54,360
quite a miraculous
occurrence and probably have,

2558
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:56,110
uh,

2559
01:13:56,110 --> 01:14:01,110
a religious importance to humanity
in the great scheme of things.

2560
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:06,330
And I think 70 years
after the crucifixion,

2561
01:14:06,611 --> 01:14:07,444
basically,

2562
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:10,030
it wasn't going so well
for the Christians,

2563
01:14:10,031 --> 01:14:10,864
you know?

2564
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:11,710
And,

2565
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:12,310
uh,

2566
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,720
so there's,

2567
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:14,180
uh,

2568
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:15,013
uh,

2569
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:15,700
uh,

2570
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:15,801
uh,

2571
01:14:15,801 --> 01:14:16,634
time,

2572
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:17,860
you know that.

2573
01:14:17,861 --> 01:14:19,630
And that's why I was trying to think of,

2574
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:20,501
oh,

2575
01:14:20,501 --> 01:14:24,280
this is kind of like a civil rights issue,

2576
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:25,540
that it is,

2577
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:26,080
uh,

2578
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:26,913
uh,

2579
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:32,550
pointing toward a higher
freedom of consciousness and a,

2580
01:14:32,741 --> 01:14:34,240
the end special,

2581
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:35,283
um,

2582
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:36,790
uh,

2583
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:37,623
places.

2584
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:38,670
I'm not saying they,

2585
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,160
these are not a potentially
dangerous substances,

2586
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:43,090
you know,

2587
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:46,960
and in the wrong hands of the
wrong time and things like that,

2588
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:48,340
it's can be a tangible,

2589
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:49,270
a weapon even,

2590
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:49,931
you know.

2591
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:50,560
So,

2592
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:50,951
uh,

2593
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:51,310
there,

2594
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:52,390
there definitely,

2595
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,340
uh,

2596
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:53,560
uh,

2597
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:57,820
things that shouldn't be toyed with and
some people should stay very clear of

2598
01:14:57,821 --> 01:14:58,654
them.

2599
01:14:58,720 --> 01:14:59,200
Uh,

2600
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,460
they happen to be,

2601
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,353
uh,

2602
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:05,860
something that gave us tremendous insight
and I think many other people as well,

2603
01:15:05,861 --> 01:15:07,450
not because I said so,

2604
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:10,720
but because people naturally
have discovered this.

2605
01:15:10,721 --> 01:15:11,650
It's part of,

2606
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:13,840
it's a part of contemporary culture even.

2607
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,500
It's just a weird thing that we have.

2608
01:15:15,501 --> 01:15:18,680
Once we write things down on
paper and we say this is a law,

2609
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:22,670
even when it gets to the
overwhelming breaking point,

2610
01:15:22,671 --> 01:15:23,390
and it's probably,

2611
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:24,980
it's probably not there with psychedelics,

2612
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:26,300
I think it is with pot.

2613
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:30,890
But when it gets to the undeniable
breaking point where people just,

2614
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:31,411
they,

2615
01:15:31,411 --> 01:15:31,731
they're like,

2616
01:15:31,731 --> 01:15:32,031
no,

2617
01:15:32,031 --> 01:15:34,730
like 70% can say they favor legalization.

2618
01:15:34,731 --> 01:15:35,540
Like oop,

2619
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:36,373
sorry.

2620
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:37,161
It's just,

2621
01:15:37,161 --> 01:15:38,300
it's not up for grabs.

2622
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,510
The federal government's not really
interested in what your real oh,

2623
01:15:41,511 --> 01:15:42,141
70%.

2624
01:15:42,141 --> 01:15:42,830
That's great.

2625
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:46,070
Call us when it's 1000000% and will
still tell you to fuck yourself.

2626
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:47,750
It's like they just,

2627
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:48,853
it's,

2628
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,810
the laws don't make any sense.

2629
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,740
And it only points at this point at this,

2630
01:15:52,741 --> 01:15:54,290
this is time to suppression.

2631
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:54,921
This is the only,

2632
01:15:54,921 --> 01:15:56,090
that's the only thing that makes sense.

2633
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:57,680
They're nonlethal okay.

2634
01:15:57,681 --> 01:15:59,450
They're not lethal life changing.

2635
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:02,090
And there's a lot of people
that give it five stars on Yelp.

2636
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:02,983
Okay.

2637
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:03,890
You know,

2638
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:06,470
this means people events
a bad times on mushrooms.

2639
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,161
That's a fact.

2640
01:16:07,161 --> 01:16:07,941
But if,

2641
01:16:07,941 --> 01:16:08,200
uh,

2642
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,710
if mushrooms had a Yelp page,

2643
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:10,940
it would be a motherfucker.

2644
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,970
That shit would be filled with
stars and there would be like,

2645
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:14,863
but link to,

2646
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:17,990
it'd be every one of those reviews
would say more at the bottom.

2647
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:21,890
You'd have to click to get an extra
pair of mantra to infinite stars.

2648
01:16:21,891 --> 01:16:22,680
Are there?

2649
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:23,513
Yeah,

2650
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:24,201
they wouldn't.

2651
01:16:24,201 --> 01:16:24,770
It would be.

2652
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:25,101
Yeah.

2653
01:16:25,101 --> 01:16:26,990
If you had less than five
stars from mushrooms,

2654
01:16:26,991 --> 01:16:27,824
you're an asshole.

2655
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,510
Give it five stars.

2656
01:16:29,511 --> 01:16:30,340
Stupid.

2657
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:31,730
It was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

2658
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:32,421
I mean they're,

2659
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:33,770
they're the Johns Hopkins University.

2660
01:16:33,771 --> 01:16:37,910
He's now starting to public studies saying
that just one mushroom trip 20 years

2661
01:16:37,911 --> 01:16:38,101
ago.

2662
01:16:38,101 --> 01:16:41,570
It was a profound effect on personality
and improve people's outlook and,

2663
01:16:41,571 --> 01:16:43,070
and their level of happiness.

2664
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,550
Like it makes it can make people happier.

2665
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,810
That sounds so stupid that it's illegal.

2666
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:49,603
Literally.

2667
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,200
How many people are like you?

2668
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:52,280
How many people are like,

2669
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:52,850
well,

2670
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:56,480
I just needed that reset and
with a loving person that I meet,

2671
01:16:56,481 --> 01:16:58,250
I have a great time and
then all of a sudden,

2672
01:16:58,251 --> 01:16:58,641
boom,

2673
01:16:58,641 --> 01:17:00,710
I'm off to the races on a
totally different track.

2674
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:04,080
How many people have
to say that before we,

2675
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:05,360
we as a culture go,

2676
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:06,110
well isn't this,

2677
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,790
this Alex Gray is like way cooler.

2678
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,560
He's like a bit way better look.

2679
01:17:09,561 --> 01:17:10,790
He makes amazing art.

2680
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:11,571
He's a nice guy.

2681
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:12,231
He's happy,

2682
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:13,064
he seems fulfilled.

2683
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:16,910
He's trying to create a
center of beautiful building
where people can come and

2684
01:17:16,911 --> 01:17:17,900
worship all this stuff.

2685
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:18,261
Like,

2686
01:17:18,261 --> 01:17:18,540
what,

2687
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:19,490
what is wrong with that?

2688
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:20,900
What's going on here?

2689
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:23,960
Like what are we trying to
protect people from time protect.

2690
01:17:23,961 --> 01:17:26,270
It sounds like you're trying to
protect people from enlightenment.

2691
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,190
That would sound preposterous.

2692
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,660
What kind of,

2693
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:32,900
what kind of a benevolent leader would
you be if you try to protect people from

2694
01:17:32,901 --> 01:17:34,010
potential enlightenment?

2695
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:38,240
Or are you scared of potential
enlightenment yourself
and knowing that if you do

2696
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:39,470
take mushrooms,

2697
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:43,040
you can't put on the bulletproof
vest and tear gas to kids.

2698
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:44,150
You can't,

2699
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:45,080
you're not going to do it.

2700
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:45,531
You're not,

2701
01:17:45,531 --> 01:17:49,070
you're not going to be the pepper spray
cop when the kids are protesting because

2702
01:17:49,071 --> 01:17:50,740
they're not going to be able to conscience

2703
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:53,490
[inaudible] and you,

2704
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,600
you learn to do

2705
01:17:54,690 --> 01:17:54,901
yeah.

2706
01:17:54,901 --> 01:17:55,830
Do that gig anymore.

2707
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:56,550
Yeah.

2708
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:57,420
You got to get a new gig.

2709
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,170
Or if you do do it,

2710
01:18:01,171 --> 01:18:02,280
you'll have nightmares.

2711
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:03,450
Oh yeah,

2712
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:04,000
yeah.

2713
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,090
Imagine doing mushrooms and
then pepper spraying kids.

2714
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:07,380
Oh my God.

2715
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:10,860
The demonic nightmares that
you would have for decades.

2716
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:11,880
It's,

2717
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:12,390
uh,

2718
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:12,830
and,

2719
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:17,830
and then the habits that you'd a
form to avoid a confronting them.

2720
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:18,960
Yeah.

2721
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:19,201
Ooh,

2722
01:18:19,201 --> 01:18:19,681
Jesus.

2723
01:18:19,681 --> 01:18:22,320
He would become a fucking
gambling addicts for sure.

2724
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,170
Three cigarettes in your
mouth at the same time

2725
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:29,040
looking at bet on a roach
cross at a parking lot,

2726
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,620
you're better than anything.

2727
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,910
There's whatever to
distract yourself from.

2728
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:37,140
It's a lot of people out there that just
got started off in a bad way mean it's

2729
01:18:37,141 --> 01:18:37,500
true.

2730
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:41,580
And very few things can help them
except psychedelic experiences.

2731
01:18:41,581 --> 01:18:43,950
Are there one of the best
ways to affect those?

2732
01:18:43,951 --> 01:18:45,120
And like we said,

2733
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:46,800
it doesn't have to be a drug.

2734
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:49,440
You can get psychedelic experience
just through meditation,

2735
01:18:49,441 --> 01:18:49,621
through.

2736
01:18:49,621 --> 01:18:49,951
If you,

2737
01:18:49,951 --> 01:18:50,121
you've,

2738
01:18:50,121 --> 01:18:50,321
you've,

2739
01:18:50,321 --> 01:18:51,240
you've practiced it enough,

2740
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,133
allegedly,

2741
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,010
he says he's done it,

2742
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:53,760
you know,

2743
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,290
I've never got there
other than getting high,

2744
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:58,980
you're saying like doing
the yoga and meditation,

2745
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:00,960
even not for a long time.

2746
01:19:00,961 --> 01:19:03,900
There are many different
approaches to meditation.

2747
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:04,261
You know,

2748
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:06,780
from the simplest kind
of watching your breath,

2749
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:07,703
uh,

2750
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:08,011
to,

2751
01:19:08,011 --> 01:19:08,380
uh,

2752
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:08,800
uh,

2753
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,001
uh,

2754
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:09,481
kind of,

2755
01:19:09,481 --> 01:19:09,870
uh,

2756
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:14,870
Alison talks about an aesthetic kind
of reception of considering each moment

2757
01:19:14,911 --> 01:19:15,211
like,

2758
01:19:15,211 --> 01:19:15,900
uh,

2759
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:16,560
you know,

2760
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,130
uh,

2761
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:19,680
for the beautiful special,

2762
01:19:19,681 --> 01:19:22,140
unique thing that it is.

2763
01:19:22,141 --> 01:19:22,620
And,

2764
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:23,060
uh,

2765
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,480
but like we listened to music,

2766
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:25,170
you know,

2767
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:26,250
we listened to with,

2768
01:19:26,251 --> 01:19:26,640
uh,

2769
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,150
uh,

2770
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:29,460
an ear of appreciation
and things like that.

2771
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:30,120
If we,

2772
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:33,540
if we had an aesthetic scrutiny
and could see the beauty of,

2773
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:34,020
of,

2774
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:34,770
uh,

2775
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,510
of our cosmic situation,

2776
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:36,781
you know,

2777
01:19:36,781 --> 01:19:41,370
that we evolved to this point where we
can talk to each other through a network

2778
01:19:41,371 --> 01:19:41,670
of,

2779
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:42,031
of,

2780
01:19:42,031 --> 01:19:42,450
uh,

2781
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:43,950
intelligence and light,

2782
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:45,210
uh,

2783
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:46,043
and share,

2784
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:46,370
uh,

2785
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:47,250
potential,

2786
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:47,510
uh,

2787
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:48,300
connection,

2788
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,133
uh,

2789
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:51,120
community even have,

2790
01:19:51,121 --> 01:19:51,390
uh,

2791
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:53,550
a new wave of consciousness that's,

2792
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:54,390
uh,

2793
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:54,661
you know,

2794
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:55,920
spread throughout the world.

2795
01:19:56,370 --> 01:19:57,090
You know,

2796
01:19:57,090 --> 01:20:00,870
I feel like these are these podcasts
and things like that are the,

2797
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:04,620
are the mushroom fruit of,

2798
01:20:04,621 --> 01:20:04,920
uh,

2799
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:09,670
my Celio body of underground
intelligences that interweave.

2800
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:10,643
And uh,

2801
01:20:10,690 --> 01:20:13,740
then they pop out on
these special occasions.

2802
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:14,701
And,

2803
01:20:14,701 --> 01:20:15,480
uh,

2804
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:19,330
well it's a door to open people up to
people like you to new possibilities,

2805
01:20:19,331 --> 01:20:20,050
new ways,

2806
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:21,160
new ways of thinking.

2807
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:26,020
And sometimes that's all you need is
just one unique idea that's putting your

2808
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,820
head by someone that you don't even know.

2809
01:20:27,821 --> 01:20:31,930
Just listening to him talk to somebody
else and that thought sends you off in a

2810
01:20:31,931 --> 01:20:32,711
different direction.

2811
01:20:32,711 --> 01:20:34,780
A person's words can be psychedelic,

2812
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,270
is I'll a lot of different things.

2813
01:20:37,330 --> 01:20:38,890
Childbirth can be psychedelic.

2814
01:20:38,891 --> 01:20:42,460
There's a lot of different things that
happened to you in this life that are

2815
01:20:42,461 --> 01:20:42,611
our,

2816
01:20:42,611 --> 01:20:43,180
you know,

2817
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:43,471
we,

2818
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:47,950
we think of psychedelics
as being hallucinations and
we think of them as being

2819
01:20:47,951 --> 01:20:49,870
sort of a child's fair.

2820
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,070
But you know,

2821
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:55,780
the reality is that there's a lot
that comes out of them that it's very

2822
01:20:55,781 --> 01:21:00,781
difficult to get any other way and
the way it comes out so reliably,

2823
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:06,540
it's like no one is like mushrooms
work for almost everyone on the planet.

2824
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:08,890
Like no one's immune.

2825
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:12,130
Like you could be out of focus
and not really get there with,

2826
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:12,821
and Delaney,

2827
01:21:12,821 --> 01:21:15,820
you really just can never really get
your shit and groove and you just have a

2828
01:21:15,821 --> 01:21:16,654
bad class.

2829
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:18,550
You take five grams of mushrooms,

2830
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:19,450
you're off to the moon,

2831
01:21:19,451 --> 01:21:20,500
no matter if you like it or not,

2832
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:21,400
you're going to,

2833
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:26,350
you're going to get sucked into the wake
and hopefully you can let go ride it

2834
01:21:26,351 --> 01:21:27,850
out and be okay.

2835
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:33,190
But you might just clench up
and it might just go haywire.

2836
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:34,533
Yes,

2837
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:35,170
yes.

2838
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:36,040
And that's the,

2839
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:36,630
uh,

2840
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:36,980
uh,

2841
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:40,570
that's why you're always
choosing a supportive and safe,

2842
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:41,050
uh,

2843
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:41,883
setting,

2844
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:42,401
uh,

2845
01:21:42,401 --> 01:21:45,790
if possible and in under ideal conditions,

2846
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:49,930
even those that you don't have
to worry about anything about it,

2847
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:53,860
that you can relax totally in that
you're supported by loving friends,

2848
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:54,670
uh,

2849
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:57,430
so that you feel that you
can go as deep and as,

2850
01:21:57,610 --> 01:21:58,443
uh,

2851
01:21:58,540 --> 01:21:59,160
uh,

2852
01:21:59,160 --> 01:21:59,993
you know,

2853
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:02,290
as high as possible.

2854
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:03,390
And,

2855
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:03,550
uh,

2856
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:06,100
with those conditions
and your favorite music,

2857
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,830
we like to use a kind of a spiritual,

2858
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:12,130
we up with Ding like
Bach and stuff like that.

2859
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,870
Kind of heavy for some people,

2860
01:22:13,871 --> 01:22:17,510
but I thought I was going
to say Christian rock now,

2861
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:19,571
but I'm like,

2862
01:22:19,571 --> 01:22:20,140
uh,

2863
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:20,710
you know,

2864
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:21,041
like,

2865
01:22:21,041 --> 01:22:21,370
uh,

2866
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:24,760
we used to listen to a musical
offering all the time and it's so airy,

2867
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:29,410
but it favored the tripping mind with
all the few gigs and things like that.

2868
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:30,540
The infinitizes,

2869
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,330
uh,

2870
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:32,050
Israeli,

2871
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:32,883
their inbox,

2872
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:34,380
I forgot to

2873
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,410
tweet people and tell
them that we're live.

2874
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:37,310
Ah,

2875
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:38,790
this flux start over.

2876
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:39,300
No,

2877
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:42,510
we don't have to start
all with live for a while.

2878
01:22:42,511 --> 01:22:43,344
Hold on

2879
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:46,860
for a while with,

2880
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:50,483
oh,

2881
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:52,723
me too.

2882
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:54,340
Sorry.

2883
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:54,701
Sorry,

2884
01:22:54,701 --> 01:22:55,570
folks listening.

2885
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,140
That's good.

2886
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:57,640
So do you ever go back to Columbus,

2887
01:22:57,641 --> 01:22:58,290
Ohio?

2888
01:22:58,290 --> 01:22:59,500
I actually will.

2889
01:22:59,501 --> 01:23:02,830
All my friends went to CCAD and that's
where actually the coffee in college I

2890
01:23:02,831 --> 01:23:04,000
was actually supposed to go to,

2891
01:23:04,001 --> 01:23:05,020
but I ended up not.

2892
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:06,783
Um,

2893
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,541
do you ever go back?

2894
01:23:07,541 --> 01:23:08,351
Do you ever visit,

2895
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:08,561
I mean,

2896
01:23:08,561 --> 01:23:10,240
I bet you're like a superhero there now,

2897
01:23:10,241 --> 01:23:10,571
so,

2898
01:23:10,571 --> 01:23:11,820
or ah,

2899
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:17,010
well I think they a great return
home has not really happened so much.

2900
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:18,653
Um,

2901
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:23,910
but I do visit my mother and
a family when things say baby.

2902
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:26,290
Yeah.

2903
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:27,071
Well we'll see.

2904
01:23:27,071 --> 01:23:27,850
You know,

2905
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:28,391
where a,

2906
01:23:28,391 --> 01:23:32,130
there's some festival things that
are happening in the region and,

2907
01:23:32,131 --> 01:23:32,964
uh,

2908
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:35,020
this year we're going perhaps,

2909
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:35,953
uh,

2910
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:38,110
to another part of the world.

2911
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:38,590
Uh,

2912
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:42,130
but then at some point I
think we'll coordinate it.

2913
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:44,860
What part of the Hudson Valley are you,

2914
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:46,900
is it the Hudson valley
that you're putting this?

2915
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:47,290
Uh,

2916
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:48,000
yes.

2917
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Where is it that we're in the town of
wappinger and a wop inter is a beautiful

2918
01:23:54,401 --> 01:23:58,660
town that's right on the Hudson River and,

2919
01:23:58,810 --> 01:23:59,643
uh,

2920
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,170
it's related to Wappingers falls.

2921
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:05,470
And [inaudible] is the
name of the native people,

2922
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:05,850
uh,

2923
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:08,830
who inhabited the region 400 years ago.

2924
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:09,971
And,

2925
01:24:09,971 --> 01:24:10,300
uh,

2926
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,100
they were,

2927
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:11,540
uh,

2928
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:11,651
uh,

2929
01:24:11,651 --> 01:24:12,484
wonderful,

2930
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:12,790
uh,

2931
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:15,280
kind of series of tribes
that went all the way down.

2932
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,830
[inaudible] a w a p.

2933
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:20,950
P.

2934
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:20,950
I.

2935
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:20,950
N.

2936
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:20,950
G.

2937
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:20,950
E.

2938
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:21,783
R,

2939
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:24,910
and I'm not,

2940
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:27,110
that's a cool name is,

2941
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:28,150
it's amazing.

2942
01:24:28,151 --> 01:24:28,600
It's,

2943
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:32,680
it's got resonances
with many creatures and,

2944
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:32,921
uh,

2945
01:24:32,921 --> 01:24:35,470
with a kind of a good attitude.

2946
01:24:35,471 --> 01:24:36,304
They had a,

2947
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:37,523
uh,

2948
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:38,201
a,

2949
01:24:38,201 --> 01:24:39,034
uh,

2950
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,473
awesome,

2951
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:41,663
uh,

2952
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,630
idea about the Hudson River.

2953
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:44,380
Uh,

2954
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,700
we call it the Hudson now,

2955
01:24:45,701 --> 01:24:47,560
but I used to be,

2956
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:48,090
uh,

2957
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:48,500
the,

2958
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:48,650
uh,

2959
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:49,840
[inaudible] Connie took,

2960
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:50,410
uh,

2961
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:53,650
the great flow that goes both ways and,

2962
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:54,100
uh,

2963
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,000
that makes sense.

2964
01:24:55,001 --> 01:24:56,740
It's a tidal river and,

2965
01:24:56,741 --> 01:24:56,980
uh,

2966
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:58,990
it goes up right to our town,

2967
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:00,040
right?

2968
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:00,791
Two around there,

2969
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:03,280
and then it goes back to the ocean.

2970
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:03,880
It's,

2971
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,400
it's just amazing kind of town.

2972
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:06,651
Is it?

2973
01:25:06,651 --> 01:25:07,380
So,

2974
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:08,050
uh,

2975
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:08,950
well it's,

2976
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:09,520
uh,

2977
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,980
it's been many things and,

2978
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:12,700
uh,

2979
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:13,031
it's,

2980
01:25:13,031 --> 01:25:13,680
uh,

2981
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:14,513
uh,

2982
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:19,800
right now I'd say it's
an evolving town and,

2983
01:25:20,111 --> 01:25:20,890
uh,

2984
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:21,723
uh,

2985
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,340
the place that we inhabit,

2986
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:29,430
it used to be called deer hill and deer
hill was a United Church of Christ,

2987
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:31,630
uh,

2988
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:34,870
congregation and also an interfaith,

2989
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:35,470
uh,

2990
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:36,303
kind of camp.

2991
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,860
So they had a very,

2992
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:39,813
um,

2993
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:45,030
trans denominational or interfaith kind
of approach to spirituality and they had

2994
01:25:46,571 --> 01:25:48,670
it on the market for like seven years.

2995
01:25:48,671 --> 01:25:50,830
And finally when we found each other,

2996
01:25:50,831 --> 01:25:54,190
we felt like we had a
lot in common that we,

2997
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:55,450
our message was,

2998
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:55,990
uh,

2999
01:25:55,990 --> 01:26:00,990
I an attempted at a universal message of
spirituality and interconnectedness and

3000
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:08,020
using nature as a setting for
this kind of sole renewing,

3001
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:10,850
uh,

3002
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:13,940
kind of surrounding in
a creative environment.

3003
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,200
So we do,

3004
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,103
uh,

3005
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:17,180
all kinds of,

3006
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:17,630
uh,

3007
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:20,300
creativity classes there from dancing and,

3008
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:20,960
uh,

3009
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,310
and uh,

3010
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,360
movement and,

3011
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,360
uh,

3012
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,740
the yoga and meditation
and things like that too.

3013
01:26:27,810 --> 01:26:30,090
How much of the places
where the outside is,

3014
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:31,340
the inside is done,

3015
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:36,110
it's just the outside needs
to be completed with the
artwork with end fee on,

3016
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,040
uh,

3017
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:37,850
the,

3018
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:38,120
uh,

3019
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,830
what we have is a,

3020
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:41,270
uh,

3021
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:46,270
old carriage house and it's
been structurally reinforced
and a w we've actually

3022
01:26:47,961 --> 01:26:52,040
put quite a bit into it already
in a ceiling and shoring it up.

3023
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:57,640
But then we have to take the roof off
and we have to establish a new steel

3024
01:26:58,101 --> 01:27:00,290
foundations in all the corners.

3025
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:01,550
And,

3026
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:02,383
uh,

3027
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:07,690
we're building the heads 16 feet away
from the entry to the brick building.

3028
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:16,090
So what you'll have is it large atrium
in front of the brick building when you

3029
01:27:16,281 --> 01:27:17,990
walk into La,

3030
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:20,420
into NT on and with this,

3031
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:20,750
uh,

3032
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:22,100
there'll be the reception,

3033
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:22,640
there'll be,

3034
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:22,911
you know,

3035
01:27:22,911 --> 01:27:25,640
bathroom and coke because
it and things like that,

3036
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:28,010
but there'll also be a fountain had there,

3037
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:28,281
uh,

3038
01:27:28,281 --> 01:27:32,930
that will mount against the
wall of this old carriage house.

3039
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:37,640
So you'll see this dramatic
kind of 75 by 23 foot high,

3040
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:39,890
a wall of brick.

3041
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:40,760
Uh,

3042
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:41,401
and this is,

3043
01:27:41,401 --> 01:27:42,081
this it right here.

3044
01:27:42,081 --> 01:27:42,950
We're looking at it right now.

3045
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:43,440
Yeah.

3046
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:43,580
Oh,

3047
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:44,420
it's up here as well.

3048
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:44,991
Uh,

3049
01:27:44,991 --> 01:27:45,410
yeah.

3050
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:45,681
Put it,

3051
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:46,520
pulled it all the way back,

3052
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:47,380
Brian for a second.

3053
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:49,513
The,

3054
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:50,451
the uh,

3055
01:27:50,451 --> 01:27:53,330
the construction looks
like pretty in depth.

3056
01:27:53,331 --> 01:27:54,590
Like you guys did a lot of,

3057
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:56,510
a lot of stuff for the Plos.

3058
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:57,440
Oh yeah.

3059
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,150
It's been,

3060
01:27:58,150 --> 01:27:59,780
are you living inside of that as well?

3061
01:27:59,781 --> 01:28:00,111
No,

3062
01:28:00,111 --> 01:28:00,770
we are not.

3063
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:03,440
There's the brick carriage house and uh,

3064
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:05,930
so we're going to,

3065
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,650
we've been showing it up.

3066
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:08,060
Uh,

3067
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:10,010
we found a nearby,

3068
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:11,413
um,

3069
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:16,660
construction companies that
are specialists in ornamental
casting of concrete.

3070
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:18,910
And uh,

3071
01:28:18,911 --> 01:28:23,911
so this is led to this kind of a key to
how we're going to actually build the

3072
01:28:25,071 --> 01:28:25,491
building.

3073
01:28:25,491 --> 01:28:26,870
So that's all going to be concrete.

3074
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:27,651
Those faces.

3075
01:28:27,651 --> 01:28:28,220
Yes,

3076
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:33,220
but it's a skin I thin skin of
concrete about an inch thick and uh,

3077
01:28:33,770 --> 01:28:38,330
reinforced with steel and a class
fiber reinforced kind of concrete.

3078
01:28:38,331 --> 01:28:39,560
And it's a very special,

3079
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:40,160
uh,

3080
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:40,910
kind of,

3081
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:41,743
uh,

3082
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:42,530
uh,

3083
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:43,363
permanent.

3084
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:43,820
Uh,

3085
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:47,390
and then it's going to be sectioned and,

3086
01:28:47,391 --> 01:28:47,540
uh,

3087
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:48,380
like these heads,

3088
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:51,170
there's very repetitive
kinds of elements to it.

3089
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:54,770
So there'll be made on some sort of a
gigantic mold or something like that.

3090
01:28:54,771 --> 01:28:56,170
And there'll be several of them reversed.

3091
01:28:56,171 --> 01:28:57,590
It will be a first,

3092
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:58,513
it was,

3093
01:28:58,550 --> 01:28:59,383
I guess,

3094
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:01,130
seeing in the imagination.

3095
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:01,500
Uh,

3096
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:02,333
thank you.

3097
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:04,470
Transcendent visionary source.

3098
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:07,410
And then I drew it and,

3099
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:07,800
uh,

3100
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,560
then I showed it to Ryan toddle,

3101
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:11,760
who's an amazing,

3102
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:12,300
uh,

3103
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:17,300
digital sculptor and a visionary artist
and he works at Disney actually during

3104
01:29:17,821 --> 01:29:18,420
the day.

3105
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:19,140
And,

3106
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:19,381
uh,

3107
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:21,690
so he took this,

3108
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:22,230
uh,

3109
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:24,420
into three dimensions and,

3110
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:24,740
uh,

3111
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:29,740
made the actual three d model that's
sized perfectly to the building.

3112
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:35,520
So this will be printed
out in sections and,

3113
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:35,821
uh,

3114
01:29:35,821 --> 01:29:37,020
we'll have a,

3115
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:37,280
uh,

3116
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,990
basically a foam print out then,

3117
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:40,350
uh,

3118
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,270
we'll be corrected and things like that.

3119
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,340
And then a mold will be taken from that.

3120
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:45,480
Then,

3121
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:45,900
uh,

3122
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:46,320
for,

3123
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,280
in that mold,

3124
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:48,450
we shoot a,

3125
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:49,410
this concrete,

3126
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:50,310
uh,

3127
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:51,100
thin,

3128
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:51,933
uh,

3129
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:53,430
kind of inch thick stuff.

3130
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,770
It's got pins on the back that attached
to a steel armature and that armature

3131
01:29:58,771 --> 01:30:00,030
attaches to the building.

3132
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:02,393
Wow.

3133
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:04,093
It's,

3134
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:07,020
it's very exciting because it's a,

3135
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:08,280
it's a real,

3136
01:30:08,281 --> 01:30:09,510
an actual thing.

3137
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,270
It's incredibly ambitious and well,

3138
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:12,631
you know,

3139
01:30:12,631 --> 01:30:12,901
look,

3140
01:30:12,901 --> 01:30:15,690
people always did sacred buildings,

3141
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,530
you know,

3142
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:17,160
and,

3143
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:17,790
uh,

3144
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:18,400
it's up.

3145
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,080
She don't have to justify it to me.

3146
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:21,340
I think it's awesome.

3147
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:22,031
I'm just,

3148
01:30:22,031 --> 01:30:22,211
I mean,

3149
01:30:22,211 --> 01:30:22,541
you're like,

3150
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:22,781
Hey,

3151
01:30:22,781 --> 01:30:23,700
they've always done this

3152
01:30:25,570 --> 01:30:26,201
tiny,

3153
01:30:26,201 --> 01:30:30,850
tiny little expression [inaudible]
magnificent temples that are all over the

3154
01:30:30,851 --> 01:30:31,810
world and things,

3155
01:30:31,811 --> 01:30:32,260
you know,

3156
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:32,561
I mean,

3157
01:30:32,561 --> 01:30:33,810
there are grand and we'll,

3158
01:30:33,811 --> 01:30:35,080
there's no pope behind you.

3159
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:40,080
Horse carriage is filled with
gold demand for construction.

3160
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:44,320
There's people who are pledging 10 bucks
and 30 bucks and I should tell them

3161
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:46,300
they get something from that.

3162
01:30:46,301 --> 01:30:49,060
You have a bunch of
different tiers set up,

3163
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:50,710
different things that you get,

3164
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:53,020
whether it's artwork or there's,

3165
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:53,321
there's,

3166
01:30:53,321 --> 01:30:56,050
I think there's how many
different levels do you have of a

3167
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:56,973
possibilities?

3168
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:57,560
They can,

3169
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:58,810
we have so many,

3170
01:30:58,811 --> 01:31:01,630
we've got like a even original artwork,

3171
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:02,560
um,

3172
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:02,981
that,

3173
01:31:02,981 --> 01:31:03,640
uh,

3174
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,770
has never been offered before and stuff.

3175
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:06,850
So,

3176
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:07,240
uh,

3177
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,073
there's a,

3178
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:08,680
uh,

3179
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:13,240
a pdf with all kinds of art works
and things like that and uh,

3180
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,620
sketches and,

3181
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,233
uh,

3182
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:17,201
these,

3183
01:31:17,201 --> 01:31:17,790
uh,

3184
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:18,310
uh,

3185
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:21,730
these are worth the two
admission for two to Ntl.

3186
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:22,720
That's your coin,

3187
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:23,943
your own money.

3188
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:25,840
What are you doing?

3189
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:26,710
You going too far?

3190
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,810
I needed to take it down a notch.

3191
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:29,681
Whatever you do.

3192
01:31:29,681 --> 01:31:30,461
Nobody has guns.

3193
01:31:30,461 --> 01:31:31,294
Okay.

3194
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:31,540
That's,

3195
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:32,620
they come down that now.

3196
01:31:32,621 --> 01:31:33,371
No guns ever.

3197
01:31:33,371 --> 01:31:33,700
Right.

3198
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,770
You should really make that super strict.

3199
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:36,230
Yeah.

3200
01:31:36,230 --> 01:31:36,460
Yeah.

3201
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:37,780
Cause you're going to
have a bunch of loons.

3202
01:31:37,781 --> 01:31:38,021
I go,

3203
01:31:38,021 --> 01:31:38,591
you know what,

3204
01:31:38,591 --> 01:31:39,424
I love,

3205
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:40,510
I love you.

3206
01:31:40,511 --> 01:31:41,440
I love psychedelics,

3207
01:31:41,441 --> 01:31:42,730
but also of the second amendment.

3208
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:47,560
We're going to rock when it
comes and takes our compound.

3209
01:31:47,950 --> 01:31:48,870
Well we covered,

3210
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:50,010
we try to have,

3211
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:50,760
uh,

3212
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:51,390
you know,

3213
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:53,040
intelligent security that,

3214
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:53,700
that,

3215
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:54,533
uh,

3216
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:58,920
that just so that things
don't always stay cool.

3217
01:31:58,990 --> 01:31:59,830
You know what it would be though,

3218
01:31:59,831 --> 01:32:04,750
it'd be the cop that pretended to be
one of you guys that would freak out and

3219
01:32:04,751 --> 01:32:05,584
pull his gun.

3220
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:09,460
The real cops will come in and lock you
guys down because you're a violent yet

3221
01:32:09,461 --> 01:32:10,294
guns.

3222
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:12,010
That'd be what I would do if I was a cop.

3223
01:32:12,011 --> 01:32:13,390
So I was trying to shut you hippies down.

3224
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:13,991
Well,

3225
01:32:13,991 --> 01:32:18,991
we actually have made friends
with the local police because,

3226
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:19,780
uh,

3227
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:20,770
we're grateful.

3228
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:20,871
Oh,

3229
01:32:20,871 --> 01:32:21,310
that's how,

3230
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:22,660
for their service,

3231
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,240
and that's a beautiful thing to say too.

3232
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:26,590
I agree with that as well.

3233
01:32:26,591 --> 01:32:30,340
I get shit about that online because you
always to tell people that I like cops.

3234
01:32:30,341 --> 01:32:32,170
But I think it's important to have police.

3235
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:35,710
We absolutely depend on them.

3236
01:32:35,711 --> 01:32:36,910
AIESEC community.

3237
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:41,170
And there's a lot of good ones you
that people don't want to address that.

3238
01:32:41,171 --> 01:32:42,250
There's a lot of cops out there.

3239
01:32:42,251 --> 01:32:44,990
They're nice despite all
the shit they see every day.

3240
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:45,700
I've,

3241
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:50,700
we have a friends who were sort of high
up in that and the local region and,

3242
01:32:51,770 --> 01:32:56,230
and they're just some of the nicest
people and most compassionate actually

3243
01:32:56,231 --> 01:33:00,820
because there they go to people
who are in trouble mostly.

3244
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:01,151
And then,

3245
01:33:01,151 --> 01:33:01,331
you know,

3246
01:33:01,331 --> 01:33:02,710
there absolutely are bad cops.

3247
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:04,150
That's no doubt about it either.

3248
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:05,013
Sure.

3249
01:33:05,470 --> 01:33:07,420
No one's making up for that.

3250
01:33:07,450 --> 01:33:09,170
But just saying there's,

3251
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:10,960
there's a need for it and
a lot of them are good.

3252
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:13,760
And if you're in a community
that's accepting you guys and,

3253
01:33:13,761 --> 01:33:16,750
and did you have a little weird thing
where they didn't want you guys to be non

3254
01:33:16,751 --> 01:33:17,584
taxed?

3255
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:18,131
Well,

3256
01:33:18,131 --> 01:33:19,660
we're still working that out.

3257
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:20,380
You know,

3258
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:22,020
they won't accept you
as a regular religion.

3259
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:23,890
It's a,

3260
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,470
the church status is,

3261
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:26,130
uh,

3262
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:26,960
uh,

3263
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:27,280
it,

3264
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:27,551
see,

3265
01:33:27,551 --> 01:33:29,260
we're building sacred space,

3266
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:29,680
right?

3267
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:33,460
We hold a full moon
ceremonies every month.

3268
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:35,020
We hold our church.

3269
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:36,393
Uh,

3270
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:37,720
that sounds awesome.

3271
01:33:37,721 --> 01:33:38,800
And which was your neighbor?

3272
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:44,620
And we have neighbors who loved to
come over and they love to participate.

3273
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:47,290
And we have people from all
over the world who come.

3274
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:51,830
And also this is before
and theone really is there,

3275
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:52,690
you know,

3276
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:57,250
so there's a lot of four years
we've been a waiting and,

3277
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:01,210
and so now we've got a
loan from a bank that is,

3278
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:02,130
uh,

3279
01:34:02,130 --> 01:34:02,410
uh,

3280
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:06,340
helping us out and we have
the kickstarters coming,

3281
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:06,821
you know,

3282
01:34:06,821 --> 01:34:07,061
it's,

3283
01:34:07,061 --> 01:34:09,640
we still have like nine
days or something like that.

3284
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:10,091
What,

3285
01:34:10,091 --> 01:34:11,290
we'll try to pump it up for you.

3286
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:12,350
What kind of town is this?

3287
01:34:12,351 --> 01:34:14,500
This is like a town that accepts hippies.

3288
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:16,980
They conserve that.

3289
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:18,970
I'd say there's,

3290
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,220
I'd say there's a healthy mix.

3291
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:23,320
And what I find so,

3292
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:24,243
uh,

3293
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:27,490
really astonishing is
the religious diversity.

3294
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,480
Uh,

3295
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:29,020
there's,

3296
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:29,330
uh,

3297
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:30,140
seek,

3298
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:30,660
uh,

3299
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:31,420
uh,

3300
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:32,021
temple,

3301
01:34:32,021 --> 01:34:34,150
I believe there's Hindu temples,

3302
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:37,030
there's a Tibetan Buddhist Stupa,

3303
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,820
there's all in the town.

3304
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:40,840
How many people were in his tone?

3305
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:41,231
Just,

3306
01:34:41,231 --> 01:34:41,650
you know,

3307
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:42,340
it's not,

3308
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:44,070
it's not a large amount of taste.

3309
01:34:44,130 --> 01:34:45,220
One of those vortexes,

3310
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,620
they're just a little wrong.

3311
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:48,100
I think that the comedy store,

3312
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:50,230
I think it's a little bit of a vortex.

3313
01:34:50,231 --> 01:34:51,700
Just beauty and,

3314
01:34:51,701 --> 01:34:52,420
uh,

3315
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:53,030
you know,

3316
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:53,241
uh,

3317
01:34:53,241 --> 01:34:55,810
according to our native American scholar,

3318
01:34:55,930 --> 01:34:56,261
uh,

3319
01:34:56,261 --> 01:34:57,080
Evan Pritchard,

3320
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,340
he said that the,

3321
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:59,233
uh,

3322
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:03,980
our land may have been held sacred
by the [inaudible] people as well.

3323
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:06,290
So it's always been kind of in this,

3324
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:07,183
uh,

3325
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:07,820
you know,

3326
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:11,200
sacred tradition and it was
a church before you and yeah,

3327
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:12,470
that's fascinating.

3328
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:13,700
I always wondered why,

3329
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:14,533
where are they,

3330
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:15,500
how,

3331
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:15,860
how you

3332
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:18,080
pick a site for something like this.

3333
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:18,950
You know,

3334
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:20,960
I think it's really cool
that you're doing it.

3335
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:22,130
I think it's really fun.

3336
01:35:22,190 --> 01:35:23,023
It's exciting.

3337
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,560
I know you have good intentions.

3338
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:25,190
So,

3339
01:35:25,190 --> 01:35:25,790
yeah,

3340
01:35:25,790 --> 01:35:26,660
we're hopeful.

3341
01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:27,800
And uh,

3342
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:28,460
these,

3343
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:28,820
uh,

3344
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:33,820
we met some of the neighbors and we tried
to be considerate now about sound and

3345
01:35:34,821 --> 01:35:35,654
things like that.

3346
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,280
And uh,

3347
01:35:37,281 --> 01:35:39,950
so it's how close are
you to the neighbors,

3348
01:35:39,951 --> 01:35:40,850
your 40 acres?

3349
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:41,750
Yes.

3350
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:42,583
Um,

3351
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:45,040
what do sounds you guys
make and he freaks loans.

3352
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:50,090
Alex Grey was actually just a
gun nut you something to shoot.

3353
01:35:51,530 --> 01:35:52,400
This is all an act.

3354
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:53,780
Well,

3355
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:54,201
I love that.

3356
01:35:54,201 --> 01:35:55,360
One of your things from music,

3357
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:55,851
you know,

3358
01:35:55,851 --> 01:35:57,290
like a sacred music.

3359
01:35:57,291 --> 01:36:00,770
We had a recent outdoor concert,

3360
01:36:00,830 --> 01:36:04,710
but there was also a fireworks
display by the city that at,

3361
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:05,870
by the town that night.

3362
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:06,940
And so it was tiring.

3363
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:08,390
It was perfect.

3364
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:09,223
Yeah.

3365
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:10,830
One of your things on your Kickstarter,

3366
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:11,664
it's awesome.

3367
01:36:11,930 --> 01:36:13,130
There's only five left though,

3368
01:36:13,131 --> 01:36:14,570
but for $1,500,

3369
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,920
you get a hand drawn portrait of
you or your beloved the that's,

3370
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:19,400
that's how awesome is that.

3371
01:36:19,401 --> 01:36:20,234
That's amazing.

3372
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:21,560
I almost want to do that.

3373
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,590
That's amazing.

3374
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:23,341
Wow.

3375
01:36:23,341 --> 01:36:24,174
That's so cool.

3376
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:24,541
Yeah.

3377
01:36:24,541 --> 01:36:25,570
That's a good Kickstarter man.

3378
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:26,000
Uh,

3379
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:26,230
you,

3380
01:36:26,230 --> 01:36:29,490
you'll get some people definitely from
this show and they get to it one more

3381
01:36:29,491 --> 01:36:29,611
time.

3382
01:36:29,611 --> 01:36:30,570
I feel like we're pvs.

3383
01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:31,890
Someone just say this one more time.

3384
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:37,440
You know that those gross fucking PBS
shows where every 15 minutes they would

3385
01:36:37,441 --> 01:36:39,510
chime in and try to get you to donate.

3386
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:39,961
Like,

3387
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:42,710
why don't you guys just get some
commercial so you have to do this,

3388
01:36:42,711 --> 01:36:43,740
this disgusting.

3389
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:45,870
Stop interrupting the conversation.

3390
01:36:45,871 --> 01:36:46,704
You're freaks.

3391
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:47,760
Um,

3392
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:51,630
so do you feel like you were already
starting to have a gravity in this town?

3393
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:51,860
It was,

3394
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,200
and people are already starting
to be drawn towards this,

3395
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:56,160
this thing that you're creating.

3396
01:36:56,161 --> 01:36:58,200
And putting together with
all these ceremonies and,

3397
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:58,791
well,

3398
01:36:58,791 --> 01:37:03,370
we did have a recent event
this past week and some of the,

3399
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:04,493
it's call it,

3400
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:06,151
well,

3401
01:37:06,151 --> 01:37:11,100
there was a recent
event at the NT on this,

3402
01:37:11,101 --> 01:37:12,960
a new religion just moved in.

3403
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:16,440
Recent of that's how they would
describe a bunch of arrests.

3404
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:17,391
Well,

3405
01:37:17,391 --> 01:37:18,470
here in La,

3406
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:19,760
we actually had,

3407
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:20,570
uh,

3408
01:37:20,570 --> 01:37:20,871
I,

3409
01:37:20,871 --> 01:37:21,440
uh,

3410
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:22,280
I safe,

3411
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:22,491
uh,

3412
01:37:22,491 --> 01:37:23,270
event,

3413
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:23,960
uh,

3414
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:28,960
where odd played and Ken Jordan
from crystal method and a Ott.

3415
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:31,773
He's a,

3416
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:33,350
an amazing,

3417
01:37:33,410 --> 01:37:35,420
I kind of named after Jonathan Od.

3418
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:35,960
But,

3419
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:36,620
uh,

3420
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:38,040
in terms of enough familiar,

3421
01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:39,350
who's Jonathan?

3422
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:42,940
Jonathan Od is a translator
of Albert Hoffman's.

3423
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:43,611
And,

3424
01:37:43,611 --> 01:37:43,820
uh,

3425
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:45,830
also was one of the people who,

3426
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:46,550
uh,

3427
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:48,710
came up with the term and theologian.

3428
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:49,290
Oh,

3429
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:49,480
okay.

3430
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:50,920
With Dr. Hoffman,

3431
01:37:51,010 --> 01:37:51,950
a translator,

3432
01:37:52,130 --> 01:37:53,180
scientific translator.

3433
01:37:53,330 --> 01:37:53,870
Uh,

3434
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:54,703
an author.

3435
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:57,090
You said it was a translator of Hoffman's?

3436
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:57,700
Yes.

3437
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:58,950
What do you mean by a translator?

3438
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:00,590
When a pro,

3439
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:02,160
my problem child,

3440
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:03,120
uh,

3441
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,650
wanted to come out in English.

3442
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:05,640
Uh,

3443
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:06,290
you,

3444
01:38:06,290 --> 01:38:06,720
uh,

3445
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:11,580
Albert Hoffman wanted someone who was
responsible to his word and to his

3446
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:12,340
meaning.

3447
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:12,701
Oh,

3448
01:38:12,701 --> 01:38:13,240
I see.

3449
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:14,380
Translate his words.

3450
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:15,161
I'm so ignorant.

3451
01:38:15,161 --> 01:38:17,170
I wasn't aware that Albert
Hoffman didn't speak English.

3452
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:17,711
Yeah.

3453
01:38:17,711 --> 01:38:18,630
Now he was Swiss.

3454
01:38:18,670 --> 01:38:21,040
I figured if he's figured
out how to make shit,

3455
01:38:21,041 --> 01:38:22,030
he's got to be American.

3456
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:23,681
I mean,

3457
01:38:23,681 --> 01:38:24,514
you know what I'm saying?

3458
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:26,490
He spoke pretty good.

3459
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,690
Good ish not to,

3460
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:29,170
uh,

3461
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:30,460
translate the book.

3462
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:31,893
Wow.

3463
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:32,800
That's fascinating stuff,

3464
01:38:32,801 --> 01:38:33,520
man.

3465
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,030
Yeah.

3466
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:35,920
So I played and,

3467
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:36,550
uh,

3468
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:37,630
Jonathan Singer,

3469
01:38:37,631 --> 01:38:38,464
who's a,

3470
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:43,710
I call him a light slinger and a Vj
Xtrordinair had made a printout of the

3471
01:38:46,151 --> 01:38:47,020
Pantheon,

3472
01:38:47,230 --> 01:38:47,800
um,

3473
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:52,800
kind of altered Dj booth or I
guess electronic musician station.

3474
01:38:53,770 --> 01:38:54,790
And uh,

3475
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:55,653
so,

3476
01:38:55,690 --> 01:38:55,960
uh,

3477
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:58,270
these wonderful musicians played,

3478
01:38:58,430 --> 01:38:58,690
uh,

3479
01:38:58,690 --> 01:38:59,980
behind something,

3480
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:02,980
a console that looked a lot
like the [inaudible] a thing.

3481
01:39:03,130 --> 01:39:04,420
So it printed it out.

3482
01:39:04,930 --> 01:39:05,763
And uh,

3483
01:39:06,010 --> 01:39:11,010
Ryan had made this a model for the booth
and it was like a proof of concept of

3484
01:39:11,471 --> 01:39:13,450
this is how we're going
to print out the building.

3485
01:39:13,510 --> 01:39:14,050
Right.

3486
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:15,160
So it looks really cool.

3487
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:15,670
Wow.

3488
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:16,930
You're doing raves.

3489
01:39:17,470 --> 01:39:19,950
I think he got djs up there.

3490
01:39:19,951 --> 01:39:21,870
This is the best religion of all time.

3491
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,130
Oh,

3492
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:24,290
everybody's ecstatic.

3493
01:39:24,370 --> 01:39:24,850
Totally.

3494
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:25,171
Yeah.

3495
01:39:25,171 --> 01:39:25,560
That's,

3496
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:25,911
Oh yeah.

3497
01:39:25,911 --> 01:39:26,250
Got It.

3498
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:27,083
Visionary,

3499
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:27,950
you know,

3500
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:28,350
that's,

3501
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:29,220
that's a beautiful thing,

3502
01:39:29,221 --> 01:39:29,521
man.

3503
01:39:29,521 --> 01:39:30,600
And you're,

3504
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:31,320
you know,

3505
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:34,140
you're going to have a positive effect
on a lot of people come through those

3506
01:39:34,141 --> 01:39:34,974
doors.

3507
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:35,610
That's,

3508
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:38,310
that's everything you would
ever want out of a religion.

3509
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:42,330
It was center where people can mean
to community and the ability to push

3510
01:39:42,331 --> 01:39:44,040
something positive out those doors,

3511
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:44,701
you know,

3512
01:39:44,701 --> 01:39:44,901
it's,

3513
01:39:44,901 --> 01:39:45,750
it's a beautiful thing,

3514
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:46,150
man.

3515
01:39:46,150 --> 01:39:46,983
Totally is.

3516
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:51,970
It's really about inspiring the
creative spirit and in everybody,

3517
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:53,030
you know,

3518
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:54,080
and uh,

3519
01:39:54,081 --> 01:39:57,250
so that's ultimately why it's there.

3520
01:39:57,350 --> 01:39:59,630
And we also see that,

3521
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:00,653
um,

3522
01:40:01,130 --> 01:40:03,440
in a dozen years or,

3523
01:40:03,441 --> 01:40:03,730
uh,

3524
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:04,880
or 2020,

3525
01:40:04,881 --> 01:40:05,151
uh,

3526
01:40:05,151 --> 01:40:06,140
if possible,

3527
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:07,010
uh,

3528
01:40:07,010 --> 01:40:11,420
if we're able to sort of pay back
some of our loans and various things,

3529
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:12,140
uh,

3530
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:12,973
over the,

3531
01:40:13,190 --> 01:40:13,970
uh,

3532
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:18,160
over time we look to
build the actual chapel,

3533
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:20,960
sacred mirrors in the meadow if possible.

3534
01:40:21,410 --> 01:40:22,160
And,

3535
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:22,610
uh,

3536
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:23,210
that,

3537
01:40:23,210 --> 01:40:23,450
uh,

3538
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:24,800
if we're able to do that,

3539
01:40:24,801 --> 01:40:27,470
that we would move our arm out of the,

3540
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:28,300
uh,

3541
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:33,300
Antionne and have it as a sanctuary for
visionary art from artists from around

3542
01:40:33,621 --> 01:40:34,454
the world,

3543
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:35,300
um,

3544
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:38,790
many of whom we've already come
and done presentations there.

3545
01:40:38,791 --> 01:40:39,080
And,

3546
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:43,310
and actually some of them are in
the collection already and stuff.

3547
01:40:43,311 --> 01:40:44,480
So it will be a,

3548
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:49,720
an active center for the
promotion of this kind of new,

3549
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:51,410
um,

3550
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:52,243
art movement.

3551
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:53,083
I'd say,

3552
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:53,920
um,

3553
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:58,510
that is worldwide and
really is a product of this,

3554
01:40:58,720 --> 01:40:59,553
uh,

3555
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:01,030
of seeing into these,

3556
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:01,630
uh,

3557
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:02,560
new dimensions.

3558
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:04,450
I think you need your own podcast.

3559
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:06,393
Absolutely.

3560
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:07,383
Why not

3561
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:08,720
a great way to reach people.

3562
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:09,830
Super easy to do,

3563
01:41:10,190 --> 01:41:11,023
set up,

3564
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:12,110
go to Libsyn.

3565
01:41:12,111 --> 01:41:12,500
You know,

3566
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:13,790
you had an account not hard,

3567
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:17,870
really easy to do and you could give
people just a weekly updates on where

3568
01:41:17,871 --> 01:41:18,710
everything stands.

3569
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:21,050
And I'm sure a lot of
people would get into that.

3570
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:21,950
And then,

3571
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:22,281
you know,

3572
01:41:22,281 --> 01:41:25,280
and you could also have your
thoughts on current events,

3573
01:41:25,281 --> 01:41:26,300
are your thoughts on,

3574
01:41:26,301 --> 01:41:27,134
you know,

3575
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:27,711
whatever,

3576
01:41:27,711 --> 01:41:28,490
anything,

3577
01:41:28,490 --> 01:41:28,701
you know,

3578
01:41:28,701 --> 01:41:31,700
you don't have to be married to
any particular amount of time.

3579
01:41:31,890 --> 01:41:33,320
Do it for 10 minutes if you like,

3580
01:41:33,321 --> 01:41:36,740
do a quick one just to keep
everybody posted or do three hours,

3581
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:37,790
do whatever the hell you want.

3582
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:38,720
But,

3583
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:40,100
but having something like that,

3584
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:41,570
when you're doing something like this,

3585
01:41:41,571 --> 01:41:42,404
which is a very,

3586
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:42,741
you're,

3587
01:41:42,741 --> 01:41:42,951
you're,

3588
01:41:42,951 --> 01:41:43,221
you're,

3589
01:41:43,221 --> 01:41:46,190
you're creating the center for community,

3590
01:41:46,191 --> 01:41:48,170
you're creating the center for sort of,

3591
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:49,013
um,

3592
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:53,870
the distribution of psychedelic ideas,

3593
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:54,441
you know,

3594
01:41:54,441 --> 01:41:56,720
and in doing something
like that and creating,

3595
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:57,653
uh,

3596
01:41:57,770 --> 01:41:58,980
that kind of a community,

3597
01:41:58,981 --> 01:41:59,580
and I mean,

3598
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:01,210
you really like putting a,

3599
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:04,880
you're putting something
out there into the world.

3600
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:05,121
You're,

3601
01:42:05,121 --> 01:42:05,331
you're,

3602
01:42:05,331 --> 01:42:05,601
you're,

3603
01:42:05,601 --> 01:42:07,280
you're setting forth a beacon.

3604
01:42:07,730 --> 01:42:08,031
You know,

3605
01:42:08,031 --> 01:42:08,864
you're like,

3606
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:09,793
you're,

3607
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:11,870
there's going to be so many people
that are influenced by that.

3608
01:42:11,930 --> 01:42:13,220
There's so many people
that look at that and go,

3609
01:42:13,221 --> 01:42:13,521
well,

3610
01:42:13,521 --> 01:42:14,180
what is he doing?

3611
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:15,013
What's going on over there?

3612
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:17,150
And they've got full moons.

3613
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:18,440
What does it big deal about four months?

3614
01:42:18,441 --> 01:42:19,274
What did these people doing?

3615
01:42:19,370 --> 01:42:19,641
Wow,

3616
01:42:19,641 --> 01:42:20,151
that's pretty,

3617
01:42:20,151 --> 01:42:21,140
what is this fucking building?

3618
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:23,120
And then they get sucked.

3619
01:42:23,121 --> 01:42:23,954
Then.

3620
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,300
Do you know you're doing that?

3621
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:29,180
You're going to be comfortable
as a cult leader or how's that?

3622
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:31,220
That's at,

3623
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:32,230
it's tough.

3624
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:33,550
I think that's very tricky.

3625
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:34,690
It's about,

3626
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:36,003
uh,

3627
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:36,970
as I said,

3628
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:39,700
holding up a sacred mirror for people.

3629
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:41,290
And,

3630
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:42,123
uh,

3631
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:46,420
if there's an element
of inspiration in the,

3632
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:47,170
uh,

3633
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:47,770
uh,

3634
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:48,820
for their own,

3635
01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:49,983
uh,

3636
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:51,880
creative lives,

3637
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:53,650
whatever it is,

3638
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:58,770
then we can see that that's a
spirituality that works for you.

3639
01:42:59,950 --> 01:43:00,460
You know,

3640
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:03,490
because you have a creative
life that has meaning for you.

3641
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:07,360
So you're seeking to inspire other
people to be more creative as well.

3642
01:43:07,361 --> 01:43:10,710
You see that start to
spark transformation,

3643
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:11,350
uh,

3644
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:12,183
of the,

3645
01:43:12,510 --> 01:43:12,880
uh,

3646
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,550
consciousness so that we can,

3647
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:16,270
uh,

3648
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:21,270
regard nature as a sacred ally that we
need to learn from and to stop abusing

3649
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:25,173
and that,

3650
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:25,541
uh,

3651
01:43:25,541 --> 01:43:26,280
we can,

3652
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:26,470
uh,

3653
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:30,100
save what we can have the life web and,

3654
01:43:30,190 --> 01:43:30,670
uh,

3655
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:35,200
have a humanity that lives for hundreds
of thousands of years instead of snuffs

3656
01:43:35,201 --> 01:43:37,270
itself out in a stupid,

3657
01:43:37,410 --> 01:43:38,243
uh,

3658
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:39,100
I,

3659
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:39,431
oops,

3660
01:43:39,431 --> 01:43:41,200
I wreck the planet,

3661
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:42,653
you know,

3662
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:43,721
you know,

3663
01:43:43,721 --> 01:43:46,060
like I'm just a teenager,

3664
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:46,720
you know,

3665
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:47,590
what do you expect?

3666
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:48,490
Um,

3667
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:49,121
but you know,

3668
01:43:49,121 --> 01:43:49,420
like,

3669
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:50,260
can we grow up?

3670
01:43:50,530 --> 01:43:51,260
Can we,

3671
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:52,250
as a species,

3672
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:52,820
it's,

3673
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:57,820
I think it's the most exciting and amazing
time cause it's like our Kickstarter,

3674
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:00,110
I have a kind of a,

3675
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:00,711
wow,

3676
01:44:00,711 --> 01:44:01,040
boy,

3677
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:02,660
there's some gravity and the,

3678
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:03,250
uh,

3679
01:44:03,250 --> 01:44:04,370
time line,

3680
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:05,300
you know,

3681
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:06,020
element.

3682
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:06,470
Uh,

3683
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:06,891
and,

3684
01:44:06,891 --> 01:44:07,011
uh,

3685
01:44:07,011 --> 01:44:07,844
of course,

3686
01:44:08,210 --> 01:44:11,900
we haven't got a United world that,

3687
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:14,750
that at where we say collectively,

3688
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:15,171
oh,

3689
01:44:15,171 --> 01:44:16,004
you know what,

3690
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:18,080
that is too much carbon.

3691
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:18,590
Uh,

3692
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:19,880
let's do the sower.

3693
01:44:19,881 --> 01:44:21,680
Like really like hard,

3694
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:22,690
you know,

3695
01:44:22,690 --> 01:44:23,890
and uh,

3696
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:27,650
and so we can start to turn it around.

3697
01:44:27,950 --> 01:44:28,783
You know,

3698
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:29,630
we're not,

3699
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:30,770
we're not there yet,

3700
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:33,710
but people in general I think,

3701
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:34,573
feel that,

3702
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:35,450
you know,

3703
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:37,220
and they start to feel like the,

3704
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:38,270
Oh wow,

3705
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:39,920
how can we turn it around?

3706
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:41,150
And,

3707
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:41,451
uh,

3708
01:44:41,451 --> 01:44:43,580
so that's why I think that,

3709
01:44:43,670 --> 01:44:44,150
uh,

3710
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:49,150
people like Paul Stamets
and other visionary thinkers
who understand more about

3711
01:44:53,481 --> 01:44:54,090
the,

3712
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:54,500
uh,

3713
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:56,450
intricacies and intelligence of,

3714
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:57,110
uh,

3715
01:44:57,110 --> 01:44:58,130
say the fungus,

3716
01:44:58,680 --> 01:44:59,513
um,

3717
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:00,080
that,

3718
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:00,870
uh,

3719
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:01,130
uh,

3720
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:03,650
we have a lot to be hopeful about.

3721
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:04,820
And,

3722
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:05,270
uh,

3723
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:10,270
if we put to use the technology and the
intelligence that is already available,

3724
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:13,820
you need to start a farm too.

3725
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:15,320
You'd grow your own food out there.

3726
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:16,020
Exactly.

3727
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:16,441
Why not?

3728
01:45:16,441 --> 01:45:17,460
You've got 40 acres,

3729
01:45:17,461 --> 01:45:17,790
right?

3730
01:45:17,790 --> 01:45:18,541
It's a great area.

3731
01:45:18,541 --> 01:45:19,740
I'm sure it gets a lot of rain.

3732
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:20,281
Well,

3733
01:45:20,281 --> 01:45:24,060
we're right next door to
a great field and perhaps

3734
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,760
it's an organic farm coming in.

3735
01:45:25,970 --> 01:45:28,790
So right now we're focusing on the temple,

3736
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:29,900
but we,

3737
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:32,030
all those things are part of the,

3738
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:32,540
uh,

3739
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:34,760
I think overall permaculture plan,

3740
01:45:35,150 --> 01:45:37,220
we're still mapping the land to see,

3741
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:37,960
uh,

3742
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:38,793
you know,

3743
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:41,750
permit culturally what
would make sense to develop.

3744
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:44,560
That's going to be really
fascinating and when it's done,

3745
01:45:44,561 --> 01:45:44,771
man,

3746
01:45:44,771 --> 01:45:46,390
I really can't wait and I'm,

3747
01:45:46,610 --> 01:45:48,010
I'm really excited about it.

3748
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:53,220
But just goes to show you the negative
thinking that some people just can't

3749
01:45:53,861 --> 01:45:54,430
escape.

3750
01:45:54,430 --> 01:45:56,520
Some people just can't help
being negative no matter what.

3751
01:45:56,521 --> 01:45:58,330
I'm going to how positive
someone else's messages.

3752
01:45:58,570 --> 01:45:59,800
Some people can't help being negative.

3753
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:03,700
Somebody talked about your empathy and
at the end that's what we're going to be

3754
01:46:03,701 --> 01:46:03,911
on.

3755
01:46:03,911 --> 01:46:04,720
Yeah,

3756
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:05,660
they said it was a,

3757
01:46:05,661 --> 01:46:10,330
a shrine to your ego because
you're creating a big piece of art,

3758
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:13,150
big piece of beautiful art that
somehow our shrine to your ego.

3759
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:17,140
She's not a strange thing
that people will accept art.

3760
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:22,440
But if that art becomes a building
that's then something's ego about it.

3761
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:28,240
Like it can be the most beautiful
thing as long as it's a painting or a

3762
01:46:28,241 --> 01:46:29,074
sculpture.

3763
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:30,760
But when you make a house out of it,

3764
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:32,890
then it's a shrine.

3765
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:34,750
And it was a shrine to ego.

3766
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:38,000
Like it can't just be a
beautiful piece of art sculpture.

3767
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:40,150
Why does someone have to hate like that?

3768
01:46:40,151 --> 01:46:40,720
That's,

3769
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,430
that's gotta be the way you were raised.

3770
01:46:42,431 --> 01:46:43,930
It's gotta be the people
that you're around.

3771
01:46:43,931 --> 01:46:45,400
There's no other way.

3772
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,710
That kind of douchey
thinking should be accepted.

3773
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:49,630
Hey look,

3774
01:46:49,630 --> 01:46:50,010
uh,

3775
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,050
everybody's entitled to their reaction.

3776
01:46:52,051 --> 01:46:57,051
And I think that it's inevitable that
entitled to be mocked for their reaction.

3777
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:03,660
People need to feel the
sting of other people going,

3778
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:04,081
bitch,

3779
01:47:04,081 --> 01:47:04,590
shut up.

3780
01:47:04,590 --> 01:47:05,580
What are you talking about?

3781
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:07,170
The guy's making a beautiful building.

3782
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:07,471
What are you,

3783
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:08,304
what's your problem?

3784
01:47:08,690 --> 01:47:09,780
It's trying to,

3785
01:47:09,781 --> 01:47:12,360
his YG negative.

3786
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,500
A lot of people need hugs.

3787
01:47:14,570 --> 01:47:15,330
That's what it is.

3788
01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:16,320
A lot of people didn't get them.

3789
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:17,490
A lot of people need them now.

3790
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:18,211
Well,

3791
01:47:18,211 --> 01:47:18,560
they,

3792
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:19,920
they're very ideas.

3793
01:47:19,950 --> 01:47:21,720
The idea that there is,

3794
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:22,643
uh,

3795
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:23,970
basically one,

3796
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:27,840
one face of God and it's all of us.

3797
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:29,070
And,

3798
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:30,030
and so,

3799
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:30,720
uh,

3800
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:31,553
there's a,

3801
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:36,620
there's a multiple and then there's
a one on the top of the roof.

3802
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:39,720
So you got the one and the
many and the many and the one.

3803
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,910
And through consciousness evolution,

3804
01:47:41,911 --> 01:47:44,820
you can reach both.

3805
01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:46,020
And like,

3806
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:49,050
I like that you say that and
it doesn't sound goofy at all.

3807
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:51,270
Do you know what I mean?

3808
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:51,450
Like,

3809
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:52,100
well,

3810
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:54,990
the plain facts as you're sincere.

3811
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:56,383
Wow.

3812
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:57,890
But it's one of those concepts where you,

3813
01:47:57,891 --> 01:47:58,171
you know,

3814
01:47:58,171 --> 01:48:01,300
you start talking about the God is the
one and the one of the Lord and you know,

3815
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:06,110
and people go crazy fuck
going on about your well Jeez.

3816
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:06,720
You know,

3817
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:07,260
okay.

3818
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:09,450
You take it from a scientific perspective,

3819
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:09,871
you know,

3820
01:48:09,871 --> 01:48:12,660
most are still on the big bang.

3821
01:48:12,661 --> 01:48:12,931
You know,

3822
01:48:12,931 --> 01:48:15,540
that 13.7 billion years ago,

3823
01:48:15,541 --> 01:48:16,500
there was nothing.

3824
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:20,940
And then [inaudible]
13.7 billion years ago,

3825
01:48:20,941 --> 01:48:21,960
we're talking about it.

3826
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:22,620
Right?

3827
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:25,830
And so that was a lot of evolution.

3828
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:29,550
That's a lot of development
over a long period of time.

3829
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:30,780
And,

3830
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:31,440
and uh,

3831
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:31,830
that's,

3832
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:32,160
uh,

3833
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:37,160
inherently the creative
spirit brought us here and uh,

3834
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:38,720
you know,

3835
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:38,790
uh,

3836
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:40,310
consciousness itself is,

3837
01:48:40,370 --> 01:48:43,020
is a miracle that we could
understand each other.

3838
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:44,033
It's fascinating.

3839
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:45,540
Beyond fascinating,

3840
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:46,500
but knows,

3841
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:48,090
I love that you were optimistic too.

3842
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:49,151
Like you,

3843
01:48:49,151 --> 01:48:51,270
you have hope for the human race.

3844
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:56,630
Like I think there's no reason to be
anything but because despite all the crazy

3845
01:48:57,751 --> 01:49:00,870
shit that's in the world of million
nuclear weapons that can destroy every

3846
01:49:00,871 --> 01:49:01,704
single thing,

3847
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:02,573
we haven't done it yet.

3848
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:03,300
I mean,

3849
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:04,140
it's kind of amazing.

3850
01:49:04,410 --> 01:49:08,130
It's kind of amazing that we've done as
little pollution as we actually have.

3851
01:49:08,490 --> 01:49:08,910
I mean,

3852
01:49:08,910 --> 01:49:13,470
it's really quite shocking that
we actually toned it down there.

3853
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:14,970
That's a little bit of like,

3854
01:49:14,971 --> 01:49:15,481
hey,

3855
01:49:15,481 --> 01:49:16,314
everybody settled down.

3856
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:16,681
You know,

3857
01:49:16,681 --> 01:49:18,260
like apparently the,

3858
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:21,240
the pollution was much
worse in Los Angeles,

3859
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:21,901
like in the,

3860
01:49:21,901 --> 01:49:23,910
in the 60s and the 70s.

3861
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:26,880
They said it was horrible
because they have those led cars.

3862
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:29,850
Like the gas was totally different
and they'd cleaned that up a lot.

3863
01:49:29,851 --> 01:49:29,971
I mean,

3864
01:49:29,971 --> 01:49:30,241
it's still,

3865
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:31,074
looks like shit.

3866
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:32,610
It's still crazy brown air,

3867
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,620
but it's better brown there Alex Gray.

3868
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:35,723
Yeah,

3869
01:49:36,150 --> 01:49:36,983
it is.

3870
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:37,973
That's a,

3871
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:41,730
that's a symbol or the stage of evolution.

3872
01:49:41,731 --> 01:49:42,181
A bit of it.

3873
01:49:42,181 --> 01:49:42,540
Yeah,

3874
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:43,350
a little bit.

3875
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:44,290
And the,

3876
01:49:44,330 --> 01:49:47,470
the consciousness that
was born during the 60s,

3877
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:48,493
uh,

3878
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,390
the civil rights era,

3879
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:53,070
the,

3880
01:49:53,070 --> 01:49:53,500
uh,

3881
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:56,080
feminism really came on strong.

3882
01:49:56,350 --> 01:49:58,330
The even eco consciousness,

3883
01:49:58,420 --> 01:49:59,290
all of these,

3884
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:00,030
uh,

3885
01:50:00,030 --> 01:50:00,360
uh,

3886
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:01,050
elements,

3887
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:01,840
uh,

3888
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:02,380
and,

3889
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:02,740
uh,

3890
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:03,573
gay rights.

3891
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:04,680
Uh,

3892
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:05,290
the,

3893
01:50:05,290 --> 01:50:06,760
the equality,

3894
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:07,713
uh,

3895
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:12,130
element started to come to the surface
or a sense of conscience about,

3896
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:13,143
uh,

3897
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:14,920
accepting more diversity.

3898
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:15,880
And,

3899
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:16,540
uh,

3900
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:18,040
you're living up to our,

3901
01:50:18,110 --> 01:50:18,943
uh,

3902
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:20,080
idea about we,

3903
01:50:20,081 --> 01:50:21,280
the people you know,

3904
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:23,110
and who are all the people.

3905
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:26,680
And I think that the
Rayanne Franchisement of,

3906
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:27,130
uh,

3907
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:28,600
people like just by saying,

3908
01:50:28,601 --> 01:50:29,051
okay,

3909
01:50:29,051 --> 01:50:29,920
gay marriages,

3910
01:50:29,921 --> 01:50:30,754
that's okay.

3911
01:50:30,930 --> 01:50:31,480
You know,

3912
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:33,130
so then other nations say,

3913
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:33,551
okay,

3914
01:50:33,551 --> 01:50:34,384
that's okay.

3915
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:34,691
You know,

3916
01:50:34,691 --> 01:50:36,910
so suddenly a stigma,

3917
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:37,480
uh,

3918
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:42,480
and a prohibition on a group of people
has been lifted and there Rayanne

3919
01:50:43,211 --> 01:50:44,830
franchised into,

3920
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:45,140
uh,

3921
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:47,200
the society at no harm,

3922
01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:47,620
uh,

3923
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:50,140
to this society even benefit to it.

3924
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:51,161
Likewise,

3925
01:50:51,161 --> 01:50:53,440
the cannabis user eventually,

3926
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:54,101
I believe,

3927
01:50:54,101 --> 01:50:58,570
should be reintegrated
into society and the world.

3928
01:50:58,630 --> 01:51:01,570
And this will show also
an evolutionary step.

3929
01:51:02,170 --> 01:51:03,003
Um,

3930
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:03,993
you know,

3931
01:51:04,130 --> 01:51:04,963
uh,

3932
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:05,741
because,

3933
01:51:05,741 --> 01:51:05,921
uh,

3934
01:51:05,921 --> 01:51:06,880
this is the,

3935
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:07,773
uh,

3936
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:10,330
the recognition of the divinity of nature.

3937
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:15,320
I think there's every reason
to be optimistic and although
there are some really

3938
01:51:15,321 --> 01:51:16,790
bad things about the world today,

3939
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:22,370
financial system is crazy and corrupt
and it's too easy to manipulate and

3940
01:51:22,371 --> 01:51:26,960
everybody knows it's rigged and we still
have to use it and it's still the thing

3941
01:51:26,961 --> 01:51:31,961
that pays off lobbyists
and moves decisions that
favorite corporations instead

3942
01:51:32,931 --> 01:51:33,890
of the general public.

3943
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,670
We still know that there's,

3944
01:51:35,690 --> 01:51:37,370
there's a lot wrong with the world,

3945
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:42,110
but we're learning more about humans,

3946
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:43,730
about behavior,

3947
01:51:43,731 --> 01:51:45,950
about just information itself,

3948
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:47,360
about technology,

3949
01:51:47,361 --> 01:51:49,250
about our place in the universe.

3950
01:51:49,490 --> 01:51:53,420
We're learning more about the cosmos
every day there's like some new discovery,

3951
01:51:53,421 --> 01:51:57,470
a new thing and new this and new that
and it's just coming at us like like a

3952
01:51:57,471 --> 01:52:00,260
wave wave after wave of information.

3953
01:52:00,590 --> 01:52:05,060
I don't think it's possible to avoid all
of that without some gigantic monsters.

3954
01:52:05,061 --> 01:52:05,781
Catastrophe.

3955
01:52:05,781 --> 01:52:07,520
I think if you just look at the,

3956
01:52:07,970 --> 01:52:12,970
if you were looking at a graph and you
look at the head space of the American

3957
01:52:12,981 --> 01:52:13,371
person,

3958
01:52:13,371 --> 01:52:18,371
the average American person from 1960
and look at the headspace in 2013 where

3959
01:52:18,950 --> 01:52:23,950
was you're dealing with a completely
different educated individual.

3960
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:28,850
You are dealing with a
level of understanding about
the way the world works.

3961
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:33,170
That's very different from at any other
time because almost any question that

3962
01:52:33,171 --> 01:52:36,770
you've ever had can be answered on
your phone within a matter of seconds.

3963
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:39,470
And although that seems so normal,

3964
01:52:39,650 --> 01:52:41,360
that changed the whole world.

3965
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:44,480
And that's going on right now.

3966
01:52:45,330 --> 01:52:47,510
I think it snuck up on us so fast.

3967
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:51,170
We just get so used to watching movies
on our phone that we don't even think

3968
01:52:51,171 --> 01:52:55,400
it's weird that it's just coming through
the air into this little thin wafer

3969
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:57,920
thing that's made out of glass
and metal in your pocket,

3970
01:52:57,921 --> 01:53:02,921
that you get to watch movies flying
through the air and you don't even think

3971
01:53:03,111 --> 01:53:03,441
about,

3972
01:53:03,441 --> 01:53:06,800
it just seems so normal to
you and it's all psychedelic.

3973
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:08,870
It's very much so,

3974
01:53:08,930 --> 01:53:09,590
and that's,

3975
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:10,281
that's what,

3976
01:53:10,281 --> 01:53:11,000
uh,

3977
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:11,833
uh,

3978
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:12,741
I guess,

3979
01:53:12,741 --> 01:53:13,340
um,

3980
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:17,600
Steve Jobs had to be interviewed by
the Department of Defense and he had to

3981
01:53:17,601 --> 01:53:22,601
defend his taking of
psychedelics and he said it's a,

3982
01:53:22,730 --> 01:53:23,420
yeah.

3983
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:26,660
In order to get the highest
clearance at and things.

3984
01:53:26,661 --> 01:53:29,750
So as a part of his interview,

3985
01:53:29,751 --> 01:53:33,890
he said that he still
believed that it was,

3986
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:34,773
uh,

3987
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:38,930
one of the most important
events in his life and,

3988
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:39,650
uh,

3989
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:40,483
that,

3990
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:40,790
uh,

3991
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:42,530
his psychedelic experiences.

3992
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:43,311
And,

3993
01:53:43,311 --> 01:53:43,610
uh,

3994
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:45,950
many of the people that they worked with,

3995
01:53:46,190 --> 01:53:46,970
of course,

3996
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:47,750
uh,

3997
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:52,750
they wondered how many times they had
tripped and things and how far out are

3998
01:53:53,271 --> 01:53:54,104
you,

3999
01:53:54,170 --> 01:53:54,860
you know,

4000
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:55,281
and,

4001
01:53:55,281 --> 01:53:55,510
uh,

4002
01:53:55,510 --> 01:53:56,010
was,

4003
01:53:56,010 --> 01:53:56,290
uh,

4004
01:53:56,290 --> 01:54:01,250
part of the openness to a
new ways of thinking that,

4005
01:54:01,310 --> 01:54:01,610
uh,

4006
01:54:01,610 --> 01:54:04,430
it allowed just as you were saying that,

4007
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:04,790
uh,

4008
01:54:04,790 --> 01:54:05,360
you,

4009
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:07,160
after a psychedelic experience,

4010
01:54:07,161 --> 01:54:11,030
you have this folder that's
called my old bullshit.

4011
01:54:11,210 --> 01:54:14,960
And then you have this possibility
wide open in front of you.

4012
01:54:14,961 --> 01:54:15,410
Why,

4013
01:54:15,410 --> 01:54:16,191
my goodness,

4014
01:54:16,191 --> 01:54:17,024
a full new,

4015
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:19,190
a new possibility there.

4016
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:20,121
Uh,

4017
01:54:20,121 --> 01:54:25,121
you can jump back in the bag that you
already know or you can forge ahead into a

4018
01:54:26,181 --> 01:54:27,770
new territory.

4019
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:32,270
And so that's the evolutionary
edge and you're always pushing it.

4020
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:35,270
And artists and creative
people are always pushing it.

4021
01:54:35,271 --> 01:54:40,220
And that's why I say everybody's kind
of pushing that edge in some way and,

4022
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:43,550
and is inherently that,

4023
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:44,993
uh,

4024
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:46,190
awareness.

4025
01:54:47,190 --> 01:54:47,510
Yeah,

4026
01:54:47,510 --> 01:54:52,510
I think it's unavoidable and it's almost
that a biologically we couldn't keep up

4027
01:54:53,521 --> 01:54:55,530
with all the technological evolution,

4028
01:54:55,531 --> 01:54:59,300
although it's not the correct term
to use technological evolution.

4029
01:54:59,310 --> 01:55:00,690
They want to use it biologically.

4030
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,100
But that just,

4031
01:55:02,101 --> 01:55:02,970
that alone,

4032
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:07,620
it's almost like our access to information
is too great for our feeble minds to

4033
01:55:07,621 --> 01:55:08,454
process.

4034
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:09,480
We're still on some,

4035
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:09,931
you know,

4036
01:55:09,931 --> 01:55:12,150
old school pentium Celeron remember them?

4037
01:55:12,170 --> 01:55:14,730
Celeron one cries good as a pentium two.

4038
01:55:15,270 --> 01:55:15,421
Yeah.

4039
01:55:15,421 --> 01:55:18,330
I mean we're like on an old
machine and machine sucks.

4040
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:20,010
We have Dunbar's number.

4041
01:55:20,011 --> 01:55:22,980
We can't remember more
than 150 people we fuck up.

4042
01:55:22,981 --> 01:55:25,320
Can't remember phone numbers anymore
because you don't have to remember them

4043
01:55:25,321 --> 01:55:26,160
because they're on your phone,

4044
01:55:26,530 --> 01:55:26,811
you know?

4045
01:55:26,811 --> 01:55:28,020
So in that sense,

4046
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:30,810
it's like we're almost becoming much,

4047
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,530
it's almost like what the,

4048
01:55:32,531 --> 01:55:34,590
the technology is doing is setting us up.

4049
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:38,700
It's getting us to a point where it's
just overwhelming us with data that we

4050
01:55:38,701 --> 01:55:39,690
can't help that little bit.

4051
01:55:39,990 --> 01:55:40,860
I know you're having a problem.

4052
01:55:41,070 --> 01:55:41,560
Okay.

4053
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:42,300
I'm going to help you out.

4054
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:43,133
We'll get to give you a,

4055
01:55:43,230 --> 01:55:44,490
we're going to put this
chip in your brain,

4056
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:45,503
and once you do,

4057
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:46,583
boom,

4058
01:55:46,770 --> 01:55:46,921
I mean,

4059
01:55:46,921 --> 01:55:48,330
the governor knows where
you are at all times,

4060
01:55:48,331 --> 01:55:53,280
but you have instant 120 Iq.

4061
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:55,860
You're going to be able to see
things you never saw before,

4062
01:55:55,861 --> 01:55:57,600
memorize things fairly quickly.

4063
01:55:57,780 --> 01:55:59,130
It's a total brain upgrade.

4064
01:55:59,370 --> 01:56:01,500
So little chip of gps in there,

4065
01:56:01,501 --> 01:56:02,520
and there's a kill switch,

4066
01:56:03,890 --> 01:56:06,180
a fucking electrocution
bolt into your brain.

4067
01:56:06,181 --> 01:56:07,740
If you say anything bad
about the government,

4068
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,980
there's movies,

4069
01:56:11,050 --> 01:56:11,540
uh,

4070
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:14,120
being sort of made with that hypothesis.

4071
01:56:14,121 --> 01:56:14,480
I mean,

4072
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:15,110
I think,

4073
01:56:15,110 --> 01:56:15,943
and the,

4074
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:17,960
I always imagined the inf,

4075
01:56:18,110 --> 01:56:18,500
uh,

4076
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:19,333
you know,

4077
01:56:19,550 --> 01:56:19,911
the,

4078
01:56:19,911 --> 01:56:20,744
uh,

4079
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:21,500
uh,

4080
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:22,700
interconnection,

4081
01:56:22,850 --> 01:56:23,540
uh,

4082
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:24,650
of everyone,

4083
01:56:24,651 --> 01:56:25,160
uh,

4084
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:25,910
uh,

4085
01:56:25,910 --> 01:56:30,200
being the ability to control
the net and the vision.

4086
01:56:30,730 --> 01:56:34,780
Do you think at all about the
technological singularity?

4087
01:56:34,781 --> 01:56:37,000
Do you follow Kurtzweil and all that?

4088
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:38,320
Singularity?

4089
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:38,440
Yeah.

4090
01:56:38,440 --> 01:56:38,980
Stuff.

4091
01:56:38,980 --> 01:56:39,430
I've,

4092
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:41,660
I'm stuff it is fascinating.

4093
01:56:41,661 --> 01:56:43,150
And we have a friends,

4094
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:43,770
uh,

4095
01:56:43,770 --> 01:56:44,603
Martine,

4096
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:45,623
uh,

4097
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:46,733
and uh,

4098
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:47,430
uh,

4099
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:52,320
Bina Rothblatt and a Martine,

4100
01:56:52,610 --> 01:56:53,443
uh,

4101
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:54,713
and uh,

4102
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:55,201
being,

4103
01:56:55,201 --> 01:56:55,380
uh,

4104
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:57,160
have been working on a,

4105
01:56:57,161 --> 01:56:57,570
uh,

4106
01:56:57,570 --> 01:57:01,260
a robotic facsimile of Bina and,

4107
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:02,220
um,

4108
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:04,380
I'm interviewing that are you?

4109
01:57:05,270 --> 01:57:06,081
It's wonderful.

4110
01:57:06,081 --> 01:57:07,720
I'm interviewing her for my Scifi show.

4111
01:57:08,010 --> 01:57:08,760
I have realized,

4112
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:09,593
yeah.

4113
01:57:09,740 --> 01:57:13,710
So her lover recreated
exactly like my team.

4114
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:14,511
Yeah.

4115
01:57:14,511 --> 01:57:15,200
Fascinating.

4116
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:15,650
Yeah,

4117
01:57:15,650 --> 01:57:16,431
they're great.

4118
01:57:16,431 --> 01:57:17,570
They're wonderful people.

4119
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:18,650
And uh,

4120
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:19,170
uh,

4121
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:19,950
we love them.

4122
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:20,783
And uh,

4123
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:23,400
yeah,

4124
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:24,233
four children.

4125
01:57:24,690 --> 01:57:25,523
Yes.

4126
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:26,630
And yeah,

4127
01:57:26,630 --> 01:57:26,950
that's,

4128
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:27,783
that's amazing.

4129
01:57:28,110 --> 01:57:28,390
Yeah.

4130
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:32,230
An artificial person or as close
to it is what we have right now.

4131
01:57:32,231 --> 01:57:32,440
Right.

4132
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:33,340
Well and,

4133
01:57:33,430 --> 01:57:34,900
and uh,

4134
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:38,560
so I mean they're where
the rubber meets the road.

4135
01:57:38,561 --> 01:57:41,080
They were really trying to push a program,

4136
01:57:41,081 --> 01:57:44,860
the robotics so that we can
have a closer facsimile.

4137
01:57:45,250 --> 01:57:46,061
And of course,

4138
01:57:46,061 --> 01:57:46,894
you know,

4139
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:47,773
under style.

4140
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:48,640
Well,

4141
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:49,473
the thing that,

4142
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:51,820
that I found fascinating,

4143
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:52,220
uh,

4144
01:57:52,220 --> 01:57:52,810
cause I,

4145
01:57:52,810 --> 01:57:57,790
I was very resistant to the whole
idea and I love with a robot idea.

4146
01:57:58,150 --> 01:57:59,230
Well,

4147
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:01,210
just the idea that the,

4148
01:58:01,420 --> 01:58:01,900
uh,

4149
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:03,070
that the,

4150
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:04,373
mmm.

4151
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,280
That there will be a time when you will,

4152
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:09,110
when this will be a problem.

4153
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:10,010
You know,

4154
01:58:10,010 --> 01:58:10,490
that,

4155
01:58:10,490 --> 01:58:11,323
uh,

4156
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:16,330
that you can not distinguish
between a human being and a,

4157
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,330
and a robot that's coming.

4158
01:58:18,331 --> 01:58:19,164
Don't you think?

4159
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:20,330
I'm not sure.

4160
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:21,261
Perhaps,

4161
01:58:21,261 --> 01:58:21,561
you know,

4162
01:58:21,561 --> 01:58:23,600
I'm naive to think that it isn't,

4163
01:58:23,630 --> 01:58:24,090
but I,

4164
01:58:24,090 --> 01:58:24,420
I,

4165
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:26,600
but I have this feeling and just like,

4166
01:58:26,660 --> 01:58:27,200
uh,

4167
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:27,981
people have,

4168
01:58:27,981 --> 01:58:28,480
uh,

4169
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:29,840
a gay Dar or,

4170
01:58:29,841 --> 01:58:30,200
uh,

4171
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:30,591
you know,

4172
01:58:30,591 --> 01:58:34,610
know each who's Jewish and
who's not and things like that,

4173
01:58:35,060 --> 01:58:35,451
you know,

4174
01:58:35,451 --> 01:58:36,560
that eat that.

4175
01:58:36,590 --> 01:58:37,700
Having a,

4176
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:38,530
uh,

4177
01:58:38,530 --> 01:58:39,141
that's a pretty,

4178
01:58:39,141 --> 01:58:41,680
it's subtle and intangible things know,

4179
01:58:42,270 --> 01:58:43,030
um,

4180
01:58:43,030 --> 01:58:45,130
to say that all body armor,

4181
01:58:45,190 --> 01:58:45,420
uh,

4182
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:46,440
and uh,

4183
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:47,020
you know,

4184
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:47,530
like,

4185
01:58:47,530 --> 01:58:48,130
uh,

4186
01:58:48,130 --> 01:58:48,910
uh,

4187
01:58:48,910 --> 01:58:49,511
you know,

4188
01:58:49,511 --> 01:58:53,680
fact of your mechanical
illness and inability,

4189
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:54,693
uh,

4190
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:55,331
you know,

4191
01:58:55,331 --> 01:58:56,164
to uh,

4192
01:58:56,200 --> 01:59:01,200
generate a subtle field even perhaps
that's a heartbeat and a things,

4193
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:07,740
these things are probably part of our
unconscious awareness of a human being.

4194
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,380
So,

4195
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:11,740
uh,

4196
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:12,573
I'll see,

4197
01:59:12,790 --> 01:59:13,360
uh,

4198
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:13,661
you know,

4199
01:59:13,661 --> 01:59:14,494
as this,

4200
01:59:14,530 --> 01:59:16,120
as it develops,

4201
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:16,810
you know,

4202
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:20,680
artificial intelligence and robotics
and things and I'm sure they'll,

4203
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:23,400
part of it will evolve toward them.

4204
01:59:24,020 --> 01:59:29,020
I really feel like we're
not giving technology the
credit it deserves in that I

4205
01:59:29,031 --> 01:59:30,100
think it might be a lot.

4206
01:59:30,770 --> 01:59:35,240
And I know that sounds
completely ridiculous because
we were so sure that life

4207
01:59:35,241 --> 01:59:36,074
is like us.

4208
01:59:36,230 --> 01:59:41,230
We're so sure that life has cells and
has blood and you know at either consumes

4209
01:59:42,351 --> 01:59:44,300
oxygen or it could be plant based life,

4210
01:59:44,301 --> 01:59:46,160
but we know what life
is and that's not life.

4211
01:59:46,190 --> 01:59:46,311
No,

4212
01:59:46,311 --> 01:59:47,390
that's just something we created.

4213
01:59:47,780 --> 01:59:48,590
But no,

4214
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:50,360
because eventually when you turn it on,

4215
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:53,510
if it eventually gets to the point where
he could reproduce on its own and think

4216
01:59:53,511 --> 01:59:57,590
for itself and defends itself or knows
how to stay alive or has instincts or

4217
01:59:57,591 --> 01:59:58,850
knows how to repair itself,

4218
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:00,620
then what exactly is that?

4219
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:02,650
And it wa how come it's not as,

4220
02:00:02,651 --> 02:00:03,351
it's not life.

4221
02:00:03,351 --> 02:00:03,741
Why?

4222
02:00:03,741 --> 02:00:05,140
Because it doesn't have what?

4223
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:06,980
This doesn't have skin.

4224
02:00:07,490 --> 02:00:08,030
Is it not?

4225
02:00:08,030 --> 02:00:12,050
Like if it's reproducing and thinking
and altering its environment and then

4226
02:00:12,051 --> 02:00:15,920
moving forward and creating new energy
sources and figuring out how to better

4227
02:00:15,921 --> 02:00:17,000
use resources.

4228
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:21,410
If you've becomes intelligent
life and some crazy asshole says,

4229
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:21,741
you know,

4230
02:00:21,741 --> 02:00:22,521
and programs in,

4231
02:00:22,521 --> 02:00:22,701
hey,

4232
02:00:22,701 --> 02:00:25,190
defend yourself and
reproduce as soon as you can.

4233
02:00:25,730 --> 02:00:25,911
Oh,

4234
02:00:25,911 --> 02:00:26,720
you're doomed.

4235
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:27,980
The human race has done,

4236
02:00:28,370 --> 02:00:28,940
they're gonna.

4237
02:00:28,940 --> 02:00:29,150
You know,

4238
02:00:29,150 --> 02:00:30,440
for sure that's a life form.

4239
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:30,741
That's,

4240
02:00:30,741 --> 02:00:34,310
it can be a life form and you're
going to get to the point,

4241
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:37,490
if this woman is recreating her wife,

4242
02:00:38,210 --> 02:00:40,700
it's going to get to a point where
that's going to be indistinguishable.

4243
02:00:40,730 --> 02:00:42,440
There's going to be an artificial,

4244
02:00:42,441 --> 02:00:43,580
you there,

4245
02:00:43,610 --> 02:00:45,620
it might even be an artificial you.

4246
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:47,180
That's exactly you.

4247
02:00:47,181 --> 02:00:49,370
It's your consciousness in another body.

4248
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:51,800
You might be able to live
several lives at once.

4249
02:00:52,100 --> 02:00:53,360
Syncytia fuck one of them up.

4250
02:00:53,361 --> 02:00:56,660
You've got a bunch of other good
lives going on simultaneously.

4251
02:00:57,490 --> 02:01:00,240
You did the right to
Benton Buddhist practices.

4252
02:01:00,241 --> 02:01:01,530
I think you can do that.

4253
02:01:01,531 --> 02:01:02,364
Anyway,

4254
02:01:02,510 --> 02:01:02,770
thanks.

4255
02:01:02,770 --> 02:01:03,330
So,

4256
02:01:03,330 --> 02:01:04,163
yeah,

4257
02:01:04,770 --> 02:01:05,520
but uh,

4258
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:06,353
the,

4259
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:07,313
uh,

4260
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:08,310
the other,

4261
02:01:08,550 --> 02:01:09,383
uh,

4262
02:01:09,570 --> 02:01:11,730
element of the virtual,

4263
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:12,540
uh,

4264
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:14,910
haven't that I love that,

4265
02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:15,540
uh,

4266
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:15,960
uh,

4267
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:19,200
Martine and Bina talked about and they,

4268
02:01:19,201 --> 02:01:19,410
uh,

4269
02:01:19,410 --> 02:01:22,820
Terasem movement that they've been

4270
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:26,820
putting forward as that,

4271
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:27,773
uh,

4272
02:01:27,990 --> 02:01:29,010
we can,

4273
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:29,610
uh,

4274
02:01:29,610 --> 02:01:34,610
program as much of the information
about our lives and about,

4275
02:01:35,910 --> 02:01:36,743
um,

4276
02:01:36,810 --> 02:01:37,240
you know,

4277
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:40,700
by filling out basically in
an elaborate questionnaire.

4278
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:43,370
And this also records,

4279
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:44,030
uh,

4280
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:48,500
our voice telling stories and things
like that and the way that we inflect and

4281
02:01:48,650 --> 02:01:49,190
uh,

4282
02:01:49,190 --> 02:01:49,730
things.

4283
02:01:49,730 --> 02:01:53,180
So these modulations and
things become part of,

4284
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:53,990
uh,

4285
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:56,660
what could be a virtual being.

4286
02:01:56,780 --> 02:01:58,250
It doesn't have to be a robot.

4287
02:01:58,610 --> 02:01:59,510
It can be,

4288
02:01:59,570 --> 02:02:00,320
um,

4289
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,700
for the virtual heaven,

4290
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:03,230
a just a facsimile,

4291
02:02:03,231 --> 02:02:05,930
a three d model that's based on the,

4292
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:06,680
um,

4293
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:07,513
sort of,

4294
02:02:07,810 --> 02:02:08,180
uh,

4295
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:09,013
3-d,

4296
02:02:09,790 --> 02:02:10,550
um,

4297
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:14,150
mapping of the head and,

4298
02:02:14,310 --> 02:02:14,960
uh,

4299
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:15,793
maybe the,

4300
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:17,720
the chest or something like that.

4301
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:19,020
So you have a,

4302
02:02:19,150 --> 02:02:24,150
a sense of the person and you might ask
a virtual grandma or Grandpa who passed

4303
02:02:25,731 --> 02:02:27,620
on several decades ago,

4304
02:02:27,710 --> 02:02:32,710
but the great grandkids can now
access them via this virtual grandma,

4305
02:02:33,710 --> 02:02:34,280
uh,

4306
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:36,560
that can say yes,

4307
02:02:36,561 --> 02:02:37,550
when I was growing up,

4308
02:02:37,551 --> 02:02:37,761
blah,

4309
02:02:37,761 --> 02:02:37,911
blah,

4310
02:02:37,911 --> 02:02:38,360
blah,

4311
02:02:38,360 --> 02:02:38,661
you know,

4312
02:02:38,661 --> 02:02:40,130
and share a story or something.

4313
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:41,930
Now what's wrong with that?

4314
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:43,190
What's wrong with that?

4315
02:02:43,270 --> 02:02:48,210
There's something crazy about turning
grandma and grandma has a great beyond,

4316
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:48,610
Oh,

4317
02:02:48,610 --> 02:02:49,960
so she was knitting.

4318
02:02:50,130 --> 02:02:50,600
Yes.

4319
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:52,270
There's something fucking
creepy about that.

4320
02:02:52,271 --> 02:02:52,571
Bad.

4321
02:02:52,571 --> 02:02:52,751
I mean,

4322
02:02:52,751 --> 02:02:54,460
maybe we need to let things go.

4323
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:56,470
Maybe we need to realize that,

4324
02:02:56,471 --> 02:02:56,771
you know,

4325
02:02:56,771 --> 02:03:00,310
grandma's the past and whatever great
memories that we had of her shower,

4326
02:03:00,330 --> 02:03:03,100
are you going to close
her Facebook account?

4327
02:03:04,290 --> 02:03:07,120
You imagine if grandma's
Facebook account becomes her.

4328
02:03:07,570 --> 02:03:08,403
Wow,

4329
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:10,330
that's nuts.

4330
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:11,740
God dammit.

4331
02:03:11,890 --> 02:03:12,610
But it's Kinda calm,

4332
02:03:12,610 --> 02:03:12,881
right?

4333
02:03:12,881 --> 02:03:13,714
I mean,

4334
02:03:14,150 --> 02:03:15,700
on Facebook a thousand years ago,

4335
02:03:16,870 --> 02:03:19,720
it seems to me that a blade
runner type scenarios,

4336
02:03:19,721 --> 02:03:24,721
inevitable though where they have a life
that is artificial but act so much like

4337
02:03:25,781 --> 02:03:28,480
us that it itself doesn't
even know it's artificial.

4338
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:31,690
Because if you're going to
program a robot correctly,

4339
02:03:32,050 --> 02:03:32,861
to be a,

4340
02:03:32,861 --> 02:03:34,810
an artificial person
that acts like a person,

4341
02:03:34,811 --> 02:03:36,190
you don't tell them
and it's hard official,

4342
02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:37,540
you want them thinking they're real.

4343
02:03:37,690 --> 02:03:38,020
Right.

4344
02:03:38,020 --> 02:03:38,561
Of course.

4345
02:03:38,561 --> 02:03:40,750
Like it would be the
blade runner scenario.

4346
02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:41,530
Yeah.

4347
02:03:41,530 --> 02:03:43,090
That was God damn brilliant movie.

4348
02:03:43,150 --> 02:03:43,691
It was,

4349
02:03:43,691 --> 02:03:44,220
it was shown

4350
02:03:44,220 --> 02:03:44,701
amazing.

4351
02:03:44,701 --> 02:03:45,840
But you know,

4352
02:03:45,841 --> 02:03:50,841
what it might mirror is this whole
thing about the neanderthal and the,

4353
02:03:51,450 --> 02:03:52,830
and our early,

4354
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:53,890
um,

4355
02:03:54,030 --> 02:03:54,930
relationship.

4356
02:03:54,950 --> 02:03:56,610
I as species we,

4357
02:03:57,240 --> 02:03:57,721
you know,

4358
02:03:57,721 --> 02:04:01,360
for thousands and thousands
of years cohabited uh,

4359
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:06,380
the same areas and what kind of a
neanderthal genocide happened there,

4360
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:07,680
you know,

4361
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:08,010
like,

4362
02:04:08,010 --> 02:04:08,261
well,

4363
02:04:08,261 --> 02:04:08,501
what,

4364
02:04:08,501 --> 02:04:10,770
what was the shadow of our species,

4365
02:04:10,771 --> 02:04:11,131
you know,

4366
02:04:11,131 --> 02:04:13,800
built on this fire relationship.

4367
02:04:13,850 --> 02:04:15,960
Do you think they just
naturally dark at all?

4368
02:04:16,510 --> 02:04:17,080
Oh No,

4369
02:04:17,080 --> 02:04:18,240
I think we definitely chilled them.

4370
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:19,390
Did you ever see the people?

4371
02:04:19,391 --> 02:04:22,450
There's a one guy said it's
a really sketchy theory,

4372
02:04:22,451 --> 02:04:23,110
but uh,

4373
02:04:23,110 --> 02:04:28,110
he painted in the end tall as like
a gorilla faced Predator and uh,

4374
02:04:28,630 --> 02:04:33,190
he tried to say that Newton neanderthal
probably hunted man and that's why we

4375
02:04:33,191 --> 02:04:37,000
drove it to extinction and that we based
our image of what neanderthal looked

4376
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:39,510
like based on human skin,

4377
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:42,570
but we don't really have any
skin from the inner towels.

4378
02:04:42,571 --> 02:04:46,830
We know that they were far stronger than
people and we know that they had a much

4379
02:04:46,831 --> 02:04:48,120
thicker bone structure.

4380
02:04:48,121 --> 02:04:48,871
They were smaller,

4381
02:04:48,871 --> 02:04:49,890
they'd be like five feet tall,

4382
02:04:49,891 --> 02:04:51,300
but they would weigh 200 pounds.

4383
02:04:51,630 --> 02:04:52,351
They were really,

4384
02:04:52,351 --> 02:04:53,820
really incredibly strong.

4385
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:54,211
Yeah.

4386
02:04:54,211 --> 02:04:55,044
Well they were more,

4387
02:04:56,060 --> 02:04:56,610
yeah,

4388
02:04:56,610 --> 02:05:00,180
more like a lower primate then
like a human or a homosapien.

4389
02:05:00,210 --> 02:05:01,140
And so this guy,

4390
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:02,250
see if he could pull that up,

4391
02:05:02,251 --> 02:05:02,550
Brian.

4392
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:03,361
It was pretty trippy.

4393
02:05:03,361 --> 02:05:04,950
It's mostly bullshit,

4394
02:05:04,951 --> 02:05:06,180
but it's Kinda fun bullshit.

4395
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:07,720
This guy,

4396
02:05:07,720 --> 02:05:08,553
um,

4397
02:05:08,650 --> 02:05:10,300
fuck w what would you say?

4398
02:05:10,450 --> 02:05:11,260
Um,

4399
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:13,470
neander tall predator.

4400
02:05:13,590 --> 02:05:14,160
Yeah.

4401
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:15,090
See if you find that.

4402
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:18,510
And he had like a whole
video where they mapped out,

4403
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:19,020
uh,

4404
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:24,020
in his opinion what it would
look like in a three d imagery.

4405
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:27,720
And so we had this really
scary looking chimpanzee thing.

4406
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:28,950
Big giant eyes.

4407
02:05:29,130 --> 02:05:31,230
We don't have any eye tissue
from the intercalls either.

4408
02:05:31,231 --> 02:05:33,720
And they have a much
larger eyeball humans.

4409
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:34,141
Yeah,

4410
02:05:34,141 --> 02:05:34,591
they're bought it.

4411
02:05:34,591 --> 02:05:34,980
They're just,

4412
02:05:34,980 --> 02:05:36,270
they're built fairly differently.

4413
02:05:36,271 --> 02:05:38,870
So this guy true them up
like crazy gorilla monsters.

4414
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:40,260
It's really,

4415
02:05:40,610 --> 02:05:40,890
I mean,

4416
02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:42,210
I don't think it's right,

4417
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:43,290
but it's a,

4418
02:05:43,291 --> 02:05:48,291
it's kind of cool to look at and it's
interesting just to conceive of it is wow.

4419
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:50,400
That's how he drew it.

4420
02:05:50,401 --> 02:05:53,430
He drew it like they might've been
Harry and they might've been like,

4421
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:53,640
what?

4422
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:58,020
They were really muscular and he made
them look more chimpanzee like then,

4423
02:05:58,040 --> 02:05:58,240
uh,

4424
02:05:58,240 --> 02:05:59,280
then human like,

4425
02:06:00,070 --> 02:06:00,870
yeah.

4426
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:01,650
Huh.

4427
02:06:01,650 --> 02:06:01,801
Yeah.

4428
02:06:01,801 --> 02:06:03,160
He did a whole documentary on it.

4429
02:06:03,190 --> 02:06:05,550
I think it's probably bullshit.

4430
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:08,040
Well,

4431
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:08,581
you know,

4432
02:06:08,581 --> 02:06:12,780
you could genetically imagine
you're yourself into a Sasquatch.

4433
02:06:13,210 --> 02:06:14,043
I was going to ask you,

4434
02:06:15,150 --> 02:06:16,530
I've been hunting for south Crotch,

4435
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:17,581
not hunting,

4436
02:06:17,581 --> 02:06:18,510
like trying to hurt him.

4437
02:06:18,980 --> 02:06:19,130
Like,

4438
02:06:19,130 --> 02:06:19,710
look,

4439
02:06:19,710 --> 02:06:21,540
I should say searching for Sasquatch.

4440
02:06:21,810 --> 02:06:22,920
I've been doing this TV show.

4441
02:06:22,930 --> 02:06:25,290
We went up to Washington state and uh,

4442
02:06:25,291 --> 02:06:28,960
we stayed in the woods out
near Mount Rainier and uh,

4443
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,060
it's like a tropical rain.

4444
02:06:30,061 --> 02:06:30,851
I mean not tropical,

4445
02:06:30,851 --> 02:06:32,100
a rain up there,

4446
02:06:32,180 --> 02:06:33,140
real rain forest.

4447
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:34,410
Like if you've never been up there,

4448
02:06:34,710 --> 02:06:35,970
you've no idea what that's like.

4449
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,680
It's the weirdest environment ever.

4450
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:39,360
You Park your car,

4451
02:06:39,510 --> 02:06:43,290
you take a walk you a hundred yards into
the woods and you might as well be on

4452
02:06:43,291 --> 02:06:44,124
another planet.

4453
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:44,791
You are,

4454
02:06:44,791 --> 02:06:47,310
you're literally enter
into a different dimension.

4455
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:48,510
There's the dimension of,

4456
02:06:49,170 --> 02:06:53,190
of there's a dimension of highways
and houses and that's all out there.

4457
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:55,010
But once you go into a rain forest,

4458
02:06:55,020 --> 02:06:55,650
like you just,

4459
02:06:55,650 --> 02:07:00,210
you go a little bit in and then you're
engulfed by this new reality and this

4460
02:07:00,211 --> 02:07:00,661
reality,

4461
02:07:00,661 --> 02:07:04,290
as you see an elk running past you
and they disappear in the trees cause

4462
02:07:04,291 --> 02:07:05,470
everything is so thick and,

4463
02:07:05,970 --> 02:07:07,200
and people start to see pig foot,

4464
02:07:08,140 --> 02:07:08,420
you know,

4465
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:09,480
they start seeing anything,

4466
02:07:09,481 --> 02:07:09,851
man,

4467
02:07:09,851 --> 02:07:11,430
you know what the fuck is out there?

4468
02:07:11,630 --> 02:07:14,940
You think big foot's preposterous
until you go to a rain forest,

4469
02:07:14,941 --> 02:07:17,490
like the Pacific northwest and you're
walking around and you're like,

4470
02:07:17,491 --> 02:07:17,941
fuck,

4471
02:07:17,941 --> 02:07:18,900
maybe man.

4472
02:07:19,540 --> 02:07:20,373
Yeah,

4473
02:07:20,530 --> 02:07:20,920
yeah.

4474
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:22,100
Quiet eight now.

4475
02:07:22,190 --> 02:07:25,020
But if you look at the earliest,

4476
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:26,093
um,

4477
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:28,320
kind of human animal,

4478
02:07:28,321 --> 02:07:30,180
hybrid cave art,

4479
02:07:30,220 --> 02:07:30,690
yeah.

4480
02:07:30,690 --> 02:07:34,470
You have something that looks
oddly like a Sasquatch type,

4481
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:35,100
uh,

4482
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:35,500
uh,

4483
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:35,891
thing,

4484
02:07:35,891 --> 02:07:35,980
you

4485
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:36,131
know,

4486
02:07:36,131 --> 02:07:36,964
because it's,

4487
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:40,450
it's just a marriage of
the stag and the human,

4488
02:07:40,630 --> 02:07:44,470
and so it's got characteristics of
the animal and the human together.

4489
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:46,750
They didn't love that
stuff really early on.

4490
02:07:47,020 --> 02:07:47,660
Yes.

4491
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:48,493
Well,

4492
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:50,500
look at all the Egyptian art,

4493
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:50,861
you know,

4494
02:07:50,861 --> 02:07:51,610
it's Paul.

4495
02:07:51,610 --> 02:07:52,400
What do you think that is?

4496
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:54,130
The fusion of the creature,

4497
02:07:54,131 --> 02:07:55,030
the animal,

4498
02:07:55,031 --> 02:07:56,080
the theory and Morph,

4499
02:07:56,110 --> 02:07:56,710
uh,

4500
02:07:56,710 --> 02:07:57,190
uh,

4501
02:07:57,190 --> 02:07:58,330
it's called theory and morph.

4502
02:07:58,450 --> 02:07:59,930
That's a term for it.

4503
02:08:00,490 --> 02:08:02,620
Isn't that what those
furies call themselves too?

4504
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:04,150
They call themselves therians.

4505
02:08:04,690 --> 02:08:04,990
Hmm.

4506
02:08:04,990 --> 02:08:05,823
Yeah.

4507
02:08:07,270 --> 02:08:08,310
I think that that's a,

4508
02:08:08,410 --> 02:08:09,243
probably a,

4509
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:12,660
not that there's anything wrong
with being a furry and much love.

4510
02:08:12,810 --> 02:08:14,140
My mascot friends,

4511
02:08:17,190 --> 02:08:20,740
I accidentally stumbled into a furry
conventional once in Pittsburgh.

4512
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,240
It was,

4513
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:22,930
you know what?

4514
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:24,010
It's going to sound stupid,

4515
02:08:24,190 --> 02:08:25,300
but I thought it was beautiful.

4516
02:08:25,700 --> 02:08:28,630
I thought it was beautiful that these
people found a place where they could all

4517
02:08:28,631 --> 02:08:30,070
get together and do this.

4518
02:08:30,130 --> 02:08:32,410
The obviously they liked doing it,

4519
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:33,490
they liked doing it.

4520
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:34,091
And where,

4521
02:08:34,091 --> 02:08:34,391
you know,

4522
02:08:34,391 --> 02:08:35,560
if you do that in your neighborhood,

4523
02:08:35,561 --> 02:08:35,980
people going,

4524
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:37,120
what the fuck are you doing man?

4525
02:08:37,121 --> 02:08:38,530
Why are you dressed up
like a giant chipmunk?

4526
02:08:39,010 --> 02:08:40,480
But for whatever reason,

4527
02:08:40,481 --> 02:08:41,800
I don't know why they liked doing it,

4528
02:08:41,801 --> 02:08:44,230
but it doesn't seem like
they're hurting anybody.

4529
02:08:44,410 --> 02:08:45,550
And we were walking,

4530
02:08:45,551 --> 02:08:46,900
they seem so happy.

4531
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:48,610
But walking down the street and all these,

4532
02:08:48,730 --> 02:08:52,930
these fairy dudes and gals were laughing
and talking together all with their

4533
02:08:52,931 --> 02:08:55,120
crazy costumes on and
nobody took the shit off.

4534
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:56,081
And I was like,

4535
02:08:56,081 --> 02:08:57,250
this is the weirdest thing ever.

4536
02:08:57,251 --> 02:08:58,660
But it looks so fun.

4537
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:02,310
It's embodying our kind of doctors shoes.

4538
02:09:02,311 --> 02:09:02,940
So like,

4539
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:03,773
uh,

4540
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:09,680
zany truth about the world of
creatures that we're a part of and it's

4541
02:09:12,901 --> 02:09:14,700
acknowledging that we're part of,

4542
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:15,180
uh,

4543
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:15,810
I,

4544
02:09:15,810 --> 02:09:16,643
uh,

4545
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:17,461
almost,

4546
02:09:17,461 --> 02:09:18,020
uh,

4547
02:09:18,020 --> 02:09:20,310
interdimensional um,

4548
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:23,100
and web of creatures.

4549
02:09:23,490 --> 02:09:25,980
And I think that the early stuff,

4550
02:09:25,981 --> 02:09:27,990
the Egyptian and all,

4551
02:09:27,991 --> 02:09:31,240
all the cave art and things
like that really does,

4552
02:09:31,290 --> 02:09:36,290
did come out of a place of
higher awareness that that
was the kind of a nature

4553
02:09:37,470 --> 02:09:37,630
[inaudible]

4554
02:09:37,630 --> 02:09:38,320
just citizen.

4555
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:38,591
Well,

4556
02:09:38,591 --> 02:09:39,480
like a lot of seconds,

4557
02:09:39,481 --> 02:09:44,481
the psychedelic drugs have
animal ideas in embedded in them.

4558
02:09:44,950 --> 02:09:46,300
And I'm absolutely,

4559
02:09:46,690 --> 02:09:48,970
especially with DMT or Iowasca,

4560
02:09:48,971 --> 02:09:51,010
there's the jaguars are leopards,

4561
02:09:51,070 --> 02:09:51,521
jaguars,

4562
02:09:51,521 --> 02:09:51,730
right?

4563
02:09:51,730 --> 02:09:53,410
Jaguars and snakes and,

4564
02:09:53,411 --> 02:09:53,980
yeah.

4565
02:09:53,980 --> 02:09:55,720
And those sort of things.

4566
02:09:55,721 --> 02:09:56,150
I mean,

4567
02:09:56,150 --> 02:09:57,930
I'd only kind of make sense place.

4568
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:58,691
Absolutely.

4569
02:09:58,691 --> 02:10:02,230
Or maybe it could have been many different
psychedelic compounds we don't even

4570
02:10:02,231 --> 02:10:05,110
know about anymore that these
people would found and that,

4571
02:10:05,160 --> 02:10:07,390
that put him them together with these,

4572
02:10:07,620 --> 02:10:08,560
these ideas.

4573
02:10:08,561 --> 02:10:12,370
And I've combining animals
and human into one form.

4574
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:13,600
Yes.

4575
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:13,841
Well,

4576
02:10:13,841 --> 02:10:14,500
it's a,

4577
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:14,890
an,

4578
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:16,060
an easy transfer.

4579
02:10:16,061 --> 02:10:17,550
And the thing that I found

4580
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:21,820
refreshing in the Egyptian
temples and things was,

4581
02:10:22,370 --> 02:10:23,203
uh,

4582
02:10:23,710 --> 02:10:28,710
how easy it was to transpose a head and
a staff of one creature and another onto

4583
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:32,120
a human body and how I,

4584
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:35,010
they were considered the gods.

4585
02:10:36,510 --> 02:10:39,000
Now if your job is to,

4586
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:39,630
uh,

4587
02:10:39,630 --> 02:10:40,770
sacred eyes,

4588
02:10:41,220 --> 02:10:41,760
uh,

4589
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:42,900
the nature field,

4590
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:43,530
uh,

4591
02:10:43,530 --> 02:10:44,880
to give a sense of,

4592
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:45,330
uh,

4593
02:10:45,330 --> 02:10:47,040
the place that we live in is a,

4594
02:10:47,041 --> 02:10:48,420
is a gift of the,

4595
02:10:48,870 --> 02:10:50,340
of a divine creator.

4596
02:10:50,700 --> 02:10:51,533
And there are,

4597
02:10:51,580 --> 02:10:52,050
uh,

4598
02:10:52,050 --> 02:10:52,380
uh,

4599
02:10:52,380 --> 02:10:57,380
then if you're gods actually are
different animals or they have animal

4600
02:10:58,501 --> 02:10:59,460
characteristics,

4601
02:10:59,670 --> 02:11:00,000
more,

4602
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:05,000
you're more apt to treat the animal with
some respect or as being an aspect of

4603
02:11:06,991 --> 02:11:08,010
that divinity.

4604
02:11:08,610 --> 02:11:09,960
And so the,

4605
02:11:10,050 --> 02:11:10,201
uh,

4606
02:11:10,201 --> 02:11:12,270
the translation of the,

4607
02:11:12,330 --> 02:11:12,900
uh,

4608
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:17,900
the archetypal symbol of a particular
animal spirit and a divine human form is

4609
02:11:21,601 --> 02:11:25,710
to acknowledge our
oneness with that kind of,

4610
02:11:25,770 --> 02:11:26,400
uh,

4611
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:27,520
the field of,

4612
02:11:27,550 --> 02:11:29,040
of the animal spirits.

4613
02:11:29,430 --> 02:11:31,230
And it's a very shamonic,

4614
02:11:31,290 --> 02:11:32,123
uh,

4615
02:11:32,220 --> 02:11:33,240
kind of thing to do.

4616
02:11:33,241 --> 02:11:33,600
And it,

4617
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:35,250
and it was part of many of the,

4618
02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:36,030
uh,

4619
02:11:36,030 --> 02:11:38,400
like the Mesopotamian Babylonian,

4620
02:11:38,580 --> 02:11:39,413
Assyrian,

4621
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:40,313
Egyptian,

4622
02:11:40,740 --> 02:11:41,220
uh,

4623
02:11:41,220 --> 02:11:43,830
even the Greeks sphinxes
and things like that.

4624
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:44,191
There's,

4625
02:11:44,191 --> 02:11:44,640
uh,

4626
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:45,450
there's this,

4627
02:11:45,450 --> 02:11:45,930
uh,

4628
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:50,820
fusion from the very earliest cave art
all the way through the great religious

4629
02:11:50,821 --> 02:11:51,660
kinds of things.

4630
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:53,250
Angels have wings there,

4631
02:11:53,251 --> 02:11:55,100
animal and human hive.

4632
02:11:55,470 --> 02:11:56,460
That's a really good,

4633
02:11:56,461 --> 02:11:56,860
you know,

4634
02:11:56,860 --> 02:12:00,900
I never even thought of until just
now that it's still part of the public

4635
02:12:00,901 --> 02:12:01,711
imagination,

4636
02:12:01,711 --> 02:12:02,101
you know,

4637
02:12:02,101 --> 02:12:02,911
and uh,

4638
02:12:02,911 --> 02:12:03,744
we,

4639
02:12:03,990 --> 02:12:05,580
it's crazy angels apart bird.

4640
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:07,500
I just thought there
were people with wings,

4641
02:12:07,530 --> 02:12:08,071
but no,

4642
02:12:08,071 --> 02:12:08,940
obviously not.

4643
02:12:09,350 --> 02:12:09,640
Well,

4644
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:10,680
if they had a bird's head,

4645
02:12:10,681 --> 02:12:11,251
then you'd be like,

4646
02:12:11,251 --> 02:12:12,084
they're part bird.

4647
02:12:12,120 --> 02:12:13,260
But as long as they have a human side,

4648
02:12:13,261 --> 02:12:15,900
you like not even a bird man in jail.

4649
02:12:16,140 --> 02:12:16,610
Yeah,

4650
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:18,240
Carson so much

4651
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:20,420
because we,

4652
02:12:20,510 --> 02:12:21,230
uh,

4653
02:12:21,230 --> 02:12:21,531
the,

4654
02:12:21,531 --> 02:12:26,531
the idea of there being a higher
world that we ascend to symbolically,

4655
02:12:26,901 --> 02:12:29,390
it's so transparent that
we don't even notice it.

4656
02:12:29,450 --> 02:12:32,840
It's just like there and,

4657
02:12:32,890 --> 02:12:33,723
uh,

4658
02:12:33,870 --> 02:12:38,870
I think that that archetype is part of
the human psyche and you can find it in

4659
02:12:39,860 --> 02:12:40,680
each,

4660
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:41,030
you know,

4661
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:41,930
sacred path.

4662
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:43,280
They,

4663
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:43,701
the,

4664
02:12:43,701 --> 02:12:44,120
uh,

4665
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:46,540
the bridging of the realm.

4666
02:12:46,541 --> 02:12:50,340
So that's twice the Hermes
was Hermes Trismus justice,

4667
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:50,661
you know,

4668
02:12:50,661 --> 02:12:51,310
the occult,

4669
02:12:51,310 --> 02:12:51,810
uh,

4670
02:12:51,810 --> 02:12:52,280
uh,

4671
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:52,940
kind of,

4672
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:53,780
um,

4673
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:55,340
the foundation.

4674
02:12:55,630 --> 02:12:56,470
I bumped Dinesh.

4675
02:12:56,830 --> 02:12:57,250
Yeah.

4676
02:12:57,250 --> 02:12:57,710
You know,

4677
02:12:57,710 --> 02:13:02,710
so many versions of the combining of a
human and an animal and sacred religious,

4678
02:13:03,791 --> 02:13:04,210
uh,

4679
02:13:04,210 --> 02:13:04,840
artwork.

4680
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:05,830
It's really fascinating.

4681
02:13:06,180 --> 02:13:07,270
I'll get the Hindi stuff.

4682
02:13:07,271 --> 02:13:12,271
Whereas a man with a lion's head and
people have it like octopus arms,

4683
02:13:12,970 --> 02:13:13,930
six arms.

4684
02:13:13,990 --> 02:13:14,823
Yeah,

4685
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:15,753
yeah,

4686
02:13:16,330 --> 02:13:17,140
yeah.

4687
02:13:17,140 --> 02:13:22,140
All a bunch of people trying to make
sense of what they're experiencing,

4688
02:13:22,450 --> 02:13:24,010
Soma or whatever it is.

4689
02:13:24,310 --> 02:13:25,143
Eight Sam.

4690
02:13:26,590 --> 02:13:27,300
Uh,

4691
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:28,133
well,

4692
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:30,030
it's very interesting.

4693
02:13:30,130 --> 02:13:30,963
Uh,

4694
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:32,573
I think so.

4695
02:13:32,630 --> 02:13:33,400
For most people,

4696
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:34,090
you're thing,

4697
02:13:34,090 --> 02:13:35,160
since cannabis,

4698
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:36,001
most people are like,

4699
02:13:36,001 --> 02:13:37,230
it's a sleeping pill.

4700
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:39,180
[inaudible] what are you talking about?

4701
02:13:39,181 --> 02:13:39,541
They don't know.

4702
02:13:39,541 --> 02:13:41,190
Like some of the sleeping pill is,

4703
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:42,120
they've fucked up.

4704
02:13:42,121 --> 02:13:45,390
They should never named it
the Soma Soma's like it's,

4705
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:45,651
it's,

4706
02:13:45,651 --> 02:13:47,940
it's a sacred psychedelic drug from,

4707
02:13:48,330 --> 02:13:48,750
was it,

4708
02:13:48,750 --> 02:13:50,100
was it from the Rig Veda?

4709
02:13:50,170 --> 02:13:50,430
Uh,

4710
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:51,580
6,000 years ago.

4711
02:13:51,581 --> 02:13:52,390
The earliest,

4712
02:13:52,390 --> 02:13:52,660
uh,

4713
02:13:52,660 --> 02:13:53,493
human,

4714
02:13:53,740 --> 02:13:54,573
um,

4715
02:13:55,240 --> 02:13:55,650
you know,

4716
02:13:55,650 --> 02:13:58,960
probably just text is the songs.

4717
02:13:59,110 --> 02:13:59,910
Uh,

4718
02:13:59,910 --> 02:14:00,310
uh,

4719
02:14:00,310 --> 02:14:01,360
in the rig Veda,

4720
02:14:01,390 --> 02:14:03,310
they Hindu text

4721
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:08,410
and some assholes on the wall and
turned that into a sleeping pill.

4722
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:10,660
Pharmaceutical sleeping pill.

4723
02:14:11,020 --> 02:14:11,201
What?

4724
02:14:11,201 --> 02:14:12,250
A bunch of dicks.

4725
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:13,240
Wow.

4726
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:14,073
There you go.

4727
02:14:14,110 --> 02:14:14,441
I mean,

4728
02:14:14,441 --> 02:14:15,730
that's like really rude.

4729
02:14:15,970 --> 02:14:16,241
You know,

4730
02:14:16,241 --> 02:14:18,250
that's like Catholics
would never take that.

4731
02:14:18,280 --> 02:14:18,871
If you had a,

4732
02:14:18,871 --> 02:14:20,860
a sleeping pill that was
called the sacrament,

4733
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:22,000
that Jesus sacrament,

4734
02:14:22,001 --> 02:14:22,331
they'd be like,

4735
02:14:22,331 --> 02:14:22,481
Hey,

4736
02:14:22,481 --> 02:14:22,960
fuck head.

4737
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:23,890
You can't call it that,

4738
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:25,680
but people are like Soma.

4739
02:14:25,690 --> 02:14:26,081
Yeah.

4740
02:14:26,081 --> 02:14:27,730
That's in another country.

4741
02:14:27,731 --> 02:14:31,030
And we're America and we're gonna just
going to call it [inaudible] cause we

4742
02:14:31,031 --> 02:14:32,660
liked the name Soma.

4743
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:33,760
It is okay.

4744
02:14:33,761 --> 02:14:34,594
Soma.

4745
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:35,320
Yeah.

4746
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:37,540
But the original Soma was
supposed to be an amazing,

4747
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:38,810
right,

4748
02:14:38,810 --> 02:14:39,650
exactly.

4749
02:14:39,710 --> 02:14:40,543
And it put,

4750
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:41,030
uh,

4751
02:14:41,030 --> 02:14:41,863
the,

4752
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:43,033
uh,

4753
02:14:43,190 --> 02:14:48,190
person who imbibed it into a state
of connectedness with the divine.

4754
02:14:48,470 --> 02:14:49,040
And,

4755
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:49,490
uh,

4756
02:14:49,490 --> 02:14:53,540
someone was also the s it was
recognized as the source of many things,

4757
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:56,510
including like clothing
and stuff like that.

4758
02:14:56,780 --> 02:14:57,613
As an artist.

4759
02:14:57,620 --> 02:15:02,620
Why do you think that you were the first
person to really encapsulate the trip?

4760
02:15:03,021 --> 02:15:03,201
To me,

4761
02:15:03,201 --> 02:15:07,760
an experience cause all these other people
that didn't have these amazing works

4762
02:15:07,761 --> 02:15:08,594
of art.

4763
02:15:08,690 --> 02:15:11,540
The only people that can't
close to capturing the trip.

4764
02:15:11,541 --> 02:15:14,030
To me an experience to me
where the ancient Egyptians,

4765
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:17,540
there's a lot of ancient Egyptian
stuff like just to Don Commons,

4766
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:20,060
a head dress and the gold,

4767
02:15:20,330 --> 02:15:21,860
the gold that's varied.

4768
02:15:22,180 --> 02:15:23,300
Tryptamine like,

4769
02:15:23,810 --> 02:15:24,171
you know,

4770
02:15:24,171 --> 02:15:26,060
and he's one of the only things in,

4771
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:26,400
um,

4772
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:30,740
in historical art to me
that rings and rings trippy.

4773
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:31,311
You know,

4774
02:15:31,311 --> 02:15:32,870
there's something about it like you,

4775
02:15:32,930 --> 02:15:35,560
like you can almost to like
hear music don't get good,

4776
02:15:36,290 --> 02:15:40,820
like some kind of trip to me in music
when you're watching these hieroglyphs and

4777
02:15:40,821 --> 02:15:41,760
he's seeing these images,

4778
02:15:41,761 --> 02:15:43,280
you're like the symbols.

4779
02:15:43,281 --> 02:15:46,390
Like even if you don't understand what
they mean when you're looking at these

4780
02:15:46,391 --> 02:15:47,181
symbols run together,

4781
02:15:47,181 --> 02:15:51,440
your mind starts to try to form patterns
and you start to try to think the way

4782
02:15:51,441 --> 02:15:56,441
these people were thinking and see these
incredibly complex geometric shapes

4783
02:15:57,621 --> 02:15:59,480
that they had turned into buildings,

4784
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,910
buildings like the temple and man,

4785
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:07,240
this gigantic building where each segment
represents different shock rose and

4786
02:16:07,611 --> 02:16:09,310
different energy points in the human body.

4787
02:16:09,340 --> 02:16:14,340
There's texts around each one
explaining this part of the human body.

4788
02:16:14,430 --> 02:16:15,200
Like it's,

4789
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:16,430
it's fucking insane.

4790
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:17,470
Yes.

4791
02:16:17,470 --> 02:16:22,470
We want to bring that idea
to the land of Kozum and uh,

4792
02:16:23,470 --> 02:16:24,310
have been,

4793
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:25,293
uh,

4794
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:26,673
you know,

4795
02:16:26,710 --> 02:16:27,700
the idea,

4796
02:16:27,830 --> 02:16:28,240
uh,

4797
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:29,140
of these,

4798
02:16:29,230 --> 02:16:30,010
uh,

4799
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:35,010
the Neta row of the family of Gods
in Egypt is a really made a strong,

4800
02:16:36,820 --> 02:16:37,450
um,

4801
02:16:37,450 --> 02:16:38,140
what isn't it,

4802
02:16:38,140 --> 02:16:38,740
uh,

4803
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:40,120
imprint on me.

4804
02:16:40,540 --> 02:16:41,770
When we went over there,

4805
02:16:41,771 --> 02:16:44,170
and Alison and I have been
back a couple of times,

4806
02:16:44,330 --> 02:16:45,720
it called against the net,

4807
02:16:45,721 --> 02:16:48,040
or rue is the family of gods that,

4808
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:48,700
uh,

4809
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:50,800
kind of opened up out of newt,

4810
02:16:51,670 --> 02:16:52,990
the night sky,

4811
02:16:53,410 --> 02:16:55,570
who had an affair with Gab,

4812
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:56,040
the,

4813
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:56,560
uh,

4814
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:57,550
earth father.

4815
02:16:57,970 --> 02:16:59,860
So the night sky mother,

4816
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:00,190
uh,

4817
02:17:00,190 --> 02:17:01,510
held five,

4818
02:17:01,570 --> 02:17:01,900
uh,

4819
02:17:01,900 --> 02:17:06,010
children in her womb and
had defined a special time,

4820
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:06,490
uh,

4821
02:17:06,490 --> 02:17:07,180
to,

4822
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:07,510
uh,

4823
02:17:07,510 --> 02:17:08,343
release them.

4824
02:17:08,650 --> 02:17:09,640
But the one,

4825
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:10,533
uh,

4826
02:17:10,570 --> 02:17:11,051
who,

4827
02:17:11,051 --> 02:17:11,350
uh,

4828
02:17:11,350 --> 02:17:15,610
was in there with his brothers and
sisters decided he didn't want to stick

4829
02:17:15,611 --> 02:17:16,100
around.

4830
02:17:16,100 --> 02:17:21,100
He was the dark kind of Lord and his name
was set and he cut his way out of his

4831
02:17:22,061 --> 02:17:23,500
mother and,

4832
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:24,070
uh,

4833
02:17:24,070 --> 02:17:26,410

the brothers and sisters,

4834
02:17:26,411 --> 02:17:30,670
including a thougth and
Isis and Osiris and,

4835
02:17:30,730 --> 02:17:31,390

4836
02:17:31,390 --> 02:17:33,340
net Thiess his sister.

4837
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:34,660
So,

4838
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:34,930

match made in heaven and all that.

4846
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:44,913
And they were,

4847
02:17:45,010 --> 02:17:45,490
uh,

4848
02:17:45,490 --> 02:17:46,210

you know,

4855
02:17:53,231 --> 02:17:53,471
and,

4856
02:17:53,471 --> 02:17:55,060
and he was kind of a,

4857
02:17:56,350 --> 02:17:56,801
you know,

4858
02:17:56,801 --> 02:18:00,520
just probably a little
jealous of his brother maybe.

4859
02:18:00,580 --> 02:18:02,570
And a net Thies,

4860
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:04,090
uh,

4861
02:18:04,090 --> 02:18:05,380
wanted a child.

4862
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:06,071
And,

4863
02:18:06,071 --> 02:18:06,250
uh,

4864
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:07,660
so anyway,

4865
02:18:07,810 --> 02:18:08,321
she,

4866
02:18:08,321 --> 02:18:08,850
uh,

4867
02:18:08,850 --> 02:18:10,520
fooled Oh,

4868
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:13,150
crs into an affair,

4869
02:18:13,530 --> 02:18:13,840
uh,

4870
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,760
perhaps in new a new bus.

4871
02:18:15,830 --> 02:18:16,030
Uh,

4872
02:18:16,030 --> 02:18:16,990
the dog headed,

4873
02:18:17,350 --> 02:18:17,840
uh,

4874
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:18,673
embalmer,

4875
02:18:18,860 --> 02:18:19,540
uh,

4876
02:18:19,540 --> 02:18:21,970
of the Nether worlds
was the result of that.

4877
02:18:22,480 --> 02:18:22,661
Well,

4878
02:18:22,661 --> 02:18:25,870
of course set was extremely disturbed and,

4879
02:18:25,930 --> 02:18:26,620
uh,

4880
02:18:26,620 --> 02:18:29,590
decided that he was going to
find a way to kill ocirus,

4881
02:18:30,070 --> 02:18:33,880
which eventually happened and he
cut him up and threw them all over,

4882
02:18:33,970 --> 02:18:34,600
uh,

4883
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:35,433
denial.

4884
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:41,040
And so isis was extremely distraught
and she went around finding,

4885
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:43,030
uh,

4886
02:18:43,030 --> 02:18:48,030
or remembering parts of the dismembered
God and each place where she found a

4887
02:18:50,531 --> 02:18:54,100
hand or a flood or something
like that at temple was built.

4888
02:18:54,610 --> 02:18:55,443
And so you would,

4889
02:18:55,450 --> 02:18:57,010
you would go down the Nile,

4890
02:18:57,430 --> 02:18:57,760
uh,

4891
02:18:57,760 --> 02:18:58,540
and,

4892
02:18:58,540 --> 02:18:59,170
uh,

4893
02:18:59,170 --> 02:19:02,740
remember the God and that's,

4894
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:04,930
that's the idea is just,

4895
02:19:05,050 --> 02:19:05,530
uh,

4896
02:19:05,530 --> 02:19:06,363
the,

4897
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:08,080
now I think that it,

4898
02:19:08,140 --> 02:19:08,740
of course,

4899
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:11,620
it's the goddess that's been lost.

4900
02:19:11,710 --> 02:19:14,230
That's been a dismembered,

4901
02:19:14,710 --> 02:19:15,130
the,

4902
02:19:15,130 --> 02:19:16,420
the mother earth.

4903
02:19:17,050 --> 02:19:18,190
And uh,

4904
02:19:18,280 --> 02:19:20,710
so the idea is to,

4905
02:19:20,790 --> 02:19:21,130
uh,

4906
02:19:21,130 --> 02:19:24,280
we have different stations on the
land where there'll be a foot,

4907
02:19:24,340 --> 02:19:26,380
there'll be hand and
different things like that.

4908
02:19:26,381 --> 02:19:28,130
They'll represent different elements

4909
02:19:28,700 --> 02:19:30,830
of the dismembered a mother.

4910
02:19:31,930 --> 02:19:34,340
So we go around to remember,

4911
02:19:34,640 --> 02:19:35,090
uh,

4912
02:19:35,090 --> 02:19:35,690
the,

4913
02:19:35,690 --> 02:19:36,410
uh,

4914
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:41,060
the mother and to re new
ourselves and to read new nature.

4915
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:46,270
Trying to wrap your mind around
Egyptian mythology and what they were,

4916
02:19:46,461 --> 02:19:51,040
what they meant by that and the origin
of that and how it led them to the

4917
02:19:51,130 --> 02:19:55,400
society that was able to
create those insane structures.

4918
02:19:55,670 --> 02:19:56,510
They're amazing.

4919
02:19:56,750 --> 02:19:57,650
I've haven't been,

4920
02:19:57,720 --> 02:19:57,970
I've,

4921
02:19:57,970 --> 02:20:01,610
I've the only really crazy place
I've been to his teaching eatsa.

4922
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:02,461
Oh,

4923
02:20:02,461 --> 02:20:02,770
did cheat.

4924
02:20:02,770 --> 02:20:03,061
You need,

4925
02:20:03,061 --> 02:20:03,770
so once,

4926
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:05,780
that was one of those things
where you're walking around going,

4927
02:20:05,810 --> 02:20:06,643
how did the,

4928
02:20:06,890 --> 02:20:07,790
what are they doing?

4929
02:20:07,791 --> 02:20:07,950
Well,

4930
02:20:07,950 --> 02:20:08,930
how did they do this?

4931
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:10,310
Why they do this?

4932
02:20:10,330 --> 02:20:11,090
Yeah.

4933
02:20:11,090 --> 02:20:12,080
This is crazy.

4934
02:20:12,081 --> 02:20:13,580
And no one lived here anymore.

4935
02:20:13,581 --> 02:20:14,720
They just all moved out.

4936
02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:16,490
They made this and then they left.

4937
02:20:17,150 --> 02:20:19,100
Somebody left behind this.

4938
02:20:20,450 --> 02:20:20,930
Yeah.

4939
02:20:20,930 --> 02:20:24,290
And you and people return there.

4940
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:25,520
You returned there.

4941
02:20:25,770 --> 02:20:26,580
We returned there.

4942
02:20:26,580 --> 02:20:27,440
Nobody there is there.

4943
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:28,130
No,

4944
02:20:28,130 --> 02:20:28,281
we,

4945
02:20:28,281 --> 02:20:32,220
funny if some dude said this is my house
now put a door in one of the top bulls.

4946
02:20:32,230 --> 02:20:34,340
Sometimes there are caretakers,

4947
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:36,440
a t for these sacred sites.

4948
02:20:36,650 --> 02:20:37,490
And uh,

4949
02:20:37,550 --> 02:20:38,800
so if they're heard,

4950
02:20:38,801 --> 02:20:39,920
hadn't believes right,

4951
02:20:40,460 --> 02:20:41,710
they just mowed down.

4952
02:20:41,720 --> 02:20:42,271
One of the,

4953
02:20:42,271 --> 02:20:42,560
uh,

4954
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:45,890
ancient Mayan temples are
pyramids that was there.

4955
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:46,790
It's like a really,

4956
02:20:46,791 --> 02:20:48,080
really old structure.

4957
02:20:48,110 --> 02:20:48,351
Oh,

4958
02:20:48,351 --> 02:20:53,120
I tend to the plotted down cause it
was on private land just to use it for

4959
02:20:53,121 --> 02:20:53,954
limestone.

4960
02:20:54,170 --> 02:20:54,800
Good Crane.

4961
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:55,140
Yeah.

4962
02:20:55,140 --> 02:20:56,150
People are freaking out.

4963
02:20:56,151 --> 02:20:56,361
Like,

4964
02:20:56,361 --> 02:20:58,100
what the fuck did you do?

4965
02:20:59,060 --> 02:20:59,620
Well,

4966
02:20:59,620 --> 02:21:00,021
you know,

4967
02:21:00,021 --> 02:21:00,854
there's,

4968
02:21:02,180 --> 02:21:06,080
there's a different feelings in the
different societies about these things.

4969
02:21:06,081 --> 02:21:06,321
You know,

4970
02:21:06,321 --> 02:21:09,020
the Taliban just destroyed a huge,

4971
02:21:09,021 --> 02:21:09,780
uh,

4972
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:12,050
a Buddhist sculpture,

4973
02:21:12,051 --> 02:21:17,051
which was a heritage type site that I
had had been there for thousands of years

4974
02:21:17,131 --> 02:21:18,890
and probably the CIA
pretending to be to tell.

4975
02:21:18,890 --> 02:21:21,170
But look what they did.

4976
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:22,640
These fucks,

4977
02:21:23,690 --> 02:21:24,530
I didn't say that.

4978
02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:26,743
I didn't mean it

4979
02:21:28,650 --> 02:21:28,940
back.

4980
02:21:28,940 --> 02:21:29,420
Well,

4981
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:32,150
I had to know at least that was
the story that got out and it,

4982
02:21:32,151 --> 02:21:33,050
and it was sad,

4983
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:34,560
but it was still most likely true.

4984
02:21:34,580 --> 02:21:34,730
I mean,

4985
02:21:34,730 --> 02:21:36,020
religious ideologies.

4986
02:21:36,021 --> 02:21:38,840
But gets people to do almost
every really fucking crazy,

4987
02:21:38,841 --> 02:21:40,730
like it's either money
or religious ideology,

4988
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:41,953
you know,

4989
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:44,450
or we ideology in general
negative ideology,

4990
02:21:44,750 --> 02:21:45,800
like we were talking about,

4991
02:21:45,801 --> 02:21:47,510
the Boston bombings were like,

4992
02:21:48,110 --> 02:21:50,210
you can't do that without ideology.

4993
02:21:50,420 --> 02:21:55,010
Like no one is able to do something like
that without ideology because you have

4994
02:21:55,011 --> 02:21:59,360
to have something that allows you to
think that that's the correct thing to do

4995
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:01,370
and your ideology of hate.

4996
02:22:02,710 --> 02:22:04,550
Not all ideologies are bad,

4997
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:05,930
but you don't,

4998
02:22:06,050 --> 02:22:10,250
you don't get really insane acts of
faith like that without an ideology.

4999
02:22:10,670 --> 02:22:11,503
Right.

5000
02:22:12,460 --> 02:22:14,390
Insane acts of terrorism either.

5001
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:16,250
Both things come from,

5002
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:17,113
you know,

5003
02:22:17,780 --> 02:22:18,740
it's not always bad,

5004
02:22:18,741 --> 02:22:19,700
but it's tricky.

5005
02:22:19,940 --> 02:22:23,690
It's tricky when you just automatically
subscribed to the patterns that are in

5006
02:22:23,691 --> 02:22:24,460
front of you.

5007
02:22:24,460 --> 02:22:25,470
We'd like be,

5008
02:22:25,770 --> 02:22:26,680
we like to be in patent.

5009
02:22:26,740 --> 02:22:29,610
It's like getting to that mild
bullshit thing on the desktop.

5010
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:31,350
We felt really comfortable,

5011
02:22:31,351 --> 02:22:33,720
like going down already tread paths.

5012
02:22:33,880 --> 02:22:34,450
Yes,

5013
02:22:34,450 --> 02:22:35,530
it's really true.

5014
02:22:35,740 --> 02:22:36,820
And it's sad,

5015
02:22:36,940 --> 02:22:37,331
uh,

5016
02:22:37,331 --> 02:22:38,164
that the,

5017
02:22:38,350 --> 02:22:38,860
uh,

5018
02:22:38,860 --> 02:22:39,520
the,

5019
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:44,050
the more wide spread understanding
of jihad as a holy war,

5020
02:22:44,260 --> 02:22:45,040
um,

5021
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:50,040
within the Muslim community is that
it's something that they ego wages.

5022
02:22:51,260 --> 02:22:52,093
Um,

5023
02:22:52,540 --> 02:22:53,350
you know,

5024
02:22:53,350 --> 02:22:53,980
uh,

5025
02:22:53,980 --> 02:22:54,813
we,

5026
02:22:55,060 --> 02:23:00,060
we engage with our ego basically somehow
the soul and the ego is always in a

5027
02:23:01,631 --> 02:23:05,650
kind of a holy war with each other that,

5028
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:06,520
uh,

5029
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:11,520
that we desired the one true
spirit to win out and to,

5030
02:23:12,610 --> 02:23:13,443
uh,

5031
02:23:13,510 --> 02:23:18,510
to have love saved the day and all
these things to be a hero in life.

5032
02:23:19,990 --> 02:23:20,650
And,

5033
02:23:20,650 --> 02:23:21,483
uh,

5034
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:22,210
this is,

5035
02:23:22,210 --> 02:23:22,840
uh,

5036
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:23,670
uh,

5037
02:23:23,670 --> 02:23:28,060
I think part of why we're
called to a call to life.

5038
02:23:28,580 --> 02:23:28,780
Okay.

5039
02:23:28,780 --> 02:23:29,221
Well the,

5040
02:23:29,221 --> 02:23:29,430
the,

5041
02:23:29,430 --> 02:23:32,500
the original term was supposed to be
like a Wark and see your own vices,

5042
02:23:32,501 --> 02:23:32,850
right?

5043
02:23:32,850 --> 02:23:33,760
Personal vices.

5044
02:23:34,070 --> 02:23:34,903
Yeah.

5045
02:23:36,110 --> 02:23:37,340
I'm a better person.

5046
02:23:37,720 --> 02:23:38,050
And,

5047
02:23:38,050 --> 02:23:43,050
and it's a struggle to become a better
person in the same way that a Ecri,

5048
02:23:43,370 --> 02:23:45,980
Israel means God wrestler,

5049
02:23:46,520 --> 02:23:46,911
you know,

5050
02:23:46,911 --> 02:23:50,960
where we're struggling with
this higher nature and,

5051
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:51,230
uh,

5052
02:23:51,230 --> 02:23:53,240
without engaging it somehow,

5053
02:23:53,270 --> 02:23:56,120
without struggling with it and to,

5054
02:23:56,300 --> 02:23:57,133
uh,

5055
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:57,850
be,

5056
02:23:57,850 --> 02:23:58,310
uh,

5057
02:23:58,310 --> 02:24:00,140
activated in our,

5058
02:24:00,340 --> 02:24:00,770
uh,

5059
02:24:00,770 --> 02:24:02,330
creative pursuit of it.

5060
02:24:02,900 --> 02:24:03,733
Um,

5061
02:24:03,830 --> 02:24:04,610
it's not,

5062
02:24:04,610 --> 02:24:06,590
it's not real or tangible for us.

5063
02:24:06,620 --> 02:24:08,480
It has to become a real,

5064
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:09,593
uh,

5065
02:24:09,650 --> 02:24:10,370
practice.

5066
02:24:10,370 --> 02:24:14,030
That's why like any kind of
art or creativity or any,

5067
02:24:14,510 --> 02:24:15,860
any form of expression,

5068
02:24:16,560 --> 02:24:17,393
uh,

5069
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:22,520
cause that's what we're made
of or made of creative energy.

5070
02:24:23,250 --> 02:24:23,461
Yeah.

5071
02:24:23,461 --> 02:24:24,294
That's what we're here for.

5072
02:24:24,340 --> 02:24:25,173
We have,

5073
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:26,370
what is the,

5074
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:27,961
was it,

5075
02:24:27,961 --> 02:24:28,794
um,

5076
02:24:29,370 --> 02:24:33,150
Marshall Mcluhan said that human beings
are the sex organs of the machine world.

5077
02:24:33,320 --> 02:24:34,560
Huh?

5078
02:24:35,070 --> 02:24:36,070
That's what we're doing.

5079
02:24:36,430 --> 02:24:37,001
We're just,

5080
02:24:37,001 --> 02:24:37,720
uh,

5081
02:24:37,720 --> 02:24:40,150
we're just creating
little computer babies.

5082
02:24:40,870 --> 02:24:42,220
That's how computers get made.

5083
02:24:42,670 --> 02:24:43,503
People create them.

5084
02:24:43,930 --> 02:24:44,800
That's true.

5085
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:45,933
That's true.

5086
02:24:46,240 --> 02:24:49,630
It's a new form of intelligence
that were living amongst,

5087
02:24:49,690 --> 02:24:52,570
are you going to download
your consciousness into
a computer when the time

5088
02:24:52,571 --> 02:24:53,404
comes?

5089
02:24:53,570 --> 02:24:55,310
We'll have to see what's available.

5090
02:24:55,311 --> 02:24:56,144
You know,

5091
02:24:56,420 --> 02:24:57,020
uh,

5092
02:24:57,020 --> 02:24:58,940
I love Martine's,

5093
02:24:59,030 --> 02:24:59,780
uh,

5094
02:24:59,780 --> 02:25:00,441
response.

5095
02:25:00,441 --> 02:25:01,111
Cause I was saying,

5096
02:25:01,111 --> 02:25:01,230
right,

5097
02:25:01,230 --> 02:25:01,710
well,

5098
02:25:01,710 --> 02:25:02,101
hey,

5099
02:25:02,101 --> 02:25:02,700
you know,

5100
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:05,520
I don't know about a soul in
a robot and stuff like that.

5101
02:25:05,521 --> 02:25:05,860
But she was,

5102
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:06,693
it was saying like,

5103
02:25:06,730 --> 02:25:08,950
well who's to say that a soul,

5104
02:25:08,990 --> 02:25:13,960
if there were a disembodied spirit
wouldn't like hanging around a,

5105
02:25:13,970 --> 02:25:15,940
a robot of itself,

5106
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:16,490
uh,

5107
02:25:16,490 --> 02:25:16,730
for

5108
02:25:16,730 --> 02:25:19,940
awhile or who's to say you're not going
to create a Zombie in the next dimension

5109
02:25:19,980 --> 02:25:21,500
of the person's going to
be born without a soul.

5110
02:25:21,501 --> 02:25:23,150
Cause he put it in
somebody fucking computer.

5111
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:24,050
And so then

5112
02:25:24,050 --> 02:25:26,840
all of a sudden the next
dimension is like the dotted debt.

5113
02:25:26,870 --> 02:25:28,730
You've got a bunch of
zombies running around.

5114
02:25:29,060 --> 02:25:30,140
That could happen.

5115
02:25:30,920 --> 02:25:32,540
Maybe that's the Zombie apocalypse,

5116
02:25:32,580 --> 02:25:33,261
apocalypse.

5117
02:25:33,261 --> 02:25:36,440
Maybe that's where now we've seen the
walking dead and this sort of thing.

5118
02:25:36,441 --> 02:25:38,960
This Zombie theme keeps returning
over and over and over again.

5119
02:25:39,170 --> 02:25:42,800
That's a warning telling us not to
download our consciousness to computers.

5120
02:25:44,060 --> 02:25:45,290
We already have.

5121
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:45,891
You know,

5122
02:25:45,891 --> 02:25:46,310
that's,

5123
02:25:46,310 --> 02:25:47,660
that's what Facebook is.

5124
02:25:47,661 --> 02:25:48,441
That's my space,

5125
02:25:48,441 --> 02:25:48,920
right?

5126
02:25:48,920 --> 02:25:49,340
Yeah.

5127
02:25:49,340 --> 02:25:49,671
Yeah.

5128
02:25:49,671 --> 02:25:50,220
Our town

5129
02:25:50,220 --> 02:25:52,590
where our Instagram or on Twitter,

5130
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:56,430
all of these things are a
virtual existence and uh,

5131
02:25:56,431 --> 02:25:56,851
you know,

5132
02:25:56,851 --> 02:25:59,370
Wiki and various things like this.

5133
02:25:59,371 --> 02:25:59,930
They,

5134
02:25:59,930 --> 02:26:04,180
they give people maybe
a sense of solidity.

5135
02:26:04,290 --> 02:26:04,800
No,

5136
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:08,040
that's why it's weird to go to someone's
Twitter page after they're dead.

5137
02:26:08,670 --> 02:26:09,660
Have you ever done that before?

5138
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:10,381
No,

5139
02:26:10,381 --> 02:26:11,400
but I'm page.

5140
02:26:11,580 --> 02:26:12,450
I have a friend who,

5141
02:26:12,451 --> 02:26:16,650
a really great guy who a expired and
every now and then I go to his Facebook

5142
02:26:16,651 --> 02:26:19,030
page and I'll read his posts and go,

5143
02:26:19,470 --> 02:26:20,010
you know,

5144
02:26:20,010 --> 02:26:21,030
I keep reading this post.

5145
02:26:21,031 --> 02:26:22,530
I'm still getting a little bit of him.

5146
02:26:22,650 --> 02:26:23,410
You know,

5147
02:26:23,410 --> 02:26:26,610
you watch a video of him
getting a little bit of him,

5148
02:26:26,970 --> 02:26:27,510
you know,

5149
02:26:27,510 --> 02:26:28,560
it's not new stuff.

5150
02:26:28,590 --> 02:26:30,630
I listened to ray man's Eric today.

5151
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:31,830
He died today.

5152
02:26:31,890 --> 02:26:32,400
Yeah.

5153
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:33,360
But I listened to him.

5154
02:26:33,390 --> 02:26:34,620
He was like 72.

5155
02:26:34,621 --> 02:26:35,454
Right?

5156
02:26:35,670 --> 02:26:36,600
Isn't that crazy?

5157
02:26:36,610 --> 02:26:38,010
Then the doors,

5158
02:26:38,100 --> 02:26:39,630
he was in the doors and he's 72.

5159
02:26:39,631 --> 02:26:39,901
It's like,

5160
02:26:39,901 --> 02:26:40,461
wait a minute.

5161
02:26:40,461 --> 02:26:42,210
Warm the dirt going on.

5162
02:26:42,360 --> 02:26:44,700
How old are we getting Jesus?

5163
02:26:44,910 --> 02:26:47,220
While there's something
timeless within that,

5164
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:50,670
he downloaded himself into a
computer right before we kicked off,

5165
02:26:53,350 --> 02:26:56,450
I think into all of our
consciousness and uh,

5166
02:26:56,590 --> 02:26:58,410
and the computers are just a,

5167
02:26:58,420 --> 02:26:58,810
uh,

5168
02:26:58,810 --> 02:27:01,060
the external storage devices.

5169
02:27:01,180 --> 02:27:04,240
What's really the cool thing is
that we're connected with all of it.

5170
02:27:04,390 --> 02:27:05,620
Just consciousness wise.

5171
02:27:05,980 --> 02:27:08,830
What do you think the next stage
of consciousness is going to be?

5172
02:27:08,890 --> 02:27:10,450
Do you think it's going
to be some sort of,

5173
02:27:10,451 --> 02:27:11,170
uh,

5174
02:27:11,170 --> 02:27:13,420
an ability to read each other's minds,

5175
02:27:13,421 --> 02:27:14,710
to integrate with each other,

5176
02:27:14,711 --> 02:27:16,780
to exchange information
freely through the air?

5177
02:27:16,781 --> 02:27:17,980
Like a Wifi signal?

5178
02:27:18,310 --> 02:27:19,180
What do you think it's going away?

5179
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:19,990
I,

5180
02:27:19,990 --> 02:27:20,620
all of that.

5181
02:27:20,620 --> 02:27:21,880
All that it's coming right?

5182
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:22,773
Can't stop it.

5183
02:27:22,810 --> 02:27:24,550
I think that it's a,

5184
02:27:24,580 --> 02:27:25,840
an inevitable,

5185
02:27:25,960 --> 02:27:26,770
um,

5186
02:27:26,770 --> 02:27:28,840
evolutionary development.

5187
02:27:28,841 --> 02:27:29,674
However,

5188
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:30,220
uh,

5189
02:27:30,220 --> 02:27:34,000
some of it's going to take training
and some of it's going to take an

5190
02:27:34,030 --> 02:27:37,570
orientation toward it and an opening up,

5191
02:27:37,730 --> 02:27:38,070
uh,

5192
02:27:38,070 --> 02:27:39,400
a ideas of,

5193
02:27:39,401 --> 02:27:40,040
uh,

5194
02:27:40,040 --> 02:27:40,420
uh,

5195
02:27:40,420 --> 02:27:41,500
clairvoyants and,

5196
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:42,160
uh,

5197
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:44,530
extra sensory perception
and things like that,

5198
02:27:45,140 --> 02:27:45,670
uh,

5199
02:27:45,670 --> 02:27:46,271
can,

5200
02:27:46,271 --> 02:27:46,630
uh,

5201
02:27:46,630 --> 02:27:47,590
be trained,

5202
02:27:47,800 --> 02:27:48,160
uh,

5203
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:48,993
in some,

5204
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:49,420
uh,

5205
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:50,710
to be enhanced.

5206
02:27:51,300 --> 02:27:56,300
I have a completely uneducated faith in
the fact that people far smarter than me

5207
02:27:57,210 --> 02:27:59,250
are going to continue to do awesome work.

5208
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:00,620
I'm,

5209
02:28:00,620 --> 02:28:04,410
I'm convinced that they're going to
continue to come out of school and figure

5210
02:28:04,411 --> 02:28:05,310
new things out,

5211
02:28:05,460 --> 02:28:06,630
even though I am not placing.

5212
02:28:06,660 --> 02:28:07,110
I'm,

5213
02:28:07,110 --> 02:28:07,441
I'm like,

5214
02:28:07,441 --> 02:28:07,980
wow,

5215
02:28:07,980 --> 02:28:08,850
we're really coming up.

5216
02:28:08,851 --> 02:28:09,810
What's really fast computers?

5217
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:10,800
I'm not coming up with shit,

5218
02:28:10,980 --> 02:28:11,880
but somewhere,

5219
02:28:11,910 --> 02:28:12,410
some,

5220
02:28:12,410 --> 02:28:12,651
I,

5221
02:28:12,651 --> 02:28:15,840
I'm convinced they're going to
continue to do awesome stuff.

5222
02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:17,550
So whoever you are out there,

5223
02:28:18,450 --> 02:28:19,283
keep it up.

5224
02:28:19,350 --> 02:28:22,220
Congratulations and thanks indeed.

5225
02:28:22,430 --> 02:28:23,510
Thank you so much.

5226
02:28:23,870 --> 02:28:23,991
Well,

5227
02:28:23,991 --> 02:28:25,040
thank you Alex Grey.

5228
02:28:25,041 --> 02:28:25,401

5229
02:28:25,401 --> 02:28:25,910

5233
02:28:31,790 --> 02:28:34,510
and please participate in the Kickstarter.

5234
02:28:34,530 --> 02:28:37,880
It's your chance to be a part
of something really cool.

5235
02:28:37,881 --> 02:28:38,150
Like,

5236
02:28:38,150 --> 02:28:38,540
uh,

5237
02:28:38,540 --> 02:28:38,790
uh,

5238
02:28:38,790 --> 02:28:39,170
uh,

5239
02:28:39,170 --> 02:28:39,710
uh,

5240
02:28:39,710 --> 02:28:44,180
beautiful building that's going
to have a beautiful cause.

5241
02:28:44,530 --> 02:28:47,510
It's going to have a beautiful movement
behind it and you're already doing

5242
02:28:47,511 --> 02:28:48,290
amazing things.

5243
02:28:48,290 --> 02:28:48,951
And I swear to God,

5244
02:28:48,951 --> 02:28:49,581
if I lived up there,

5245
02:28:49,581 --> 02:28:50,630
I'd be visiting all the time.

5246
02:28:51,250 --> 02:28:52,280
Even when the shit hits the fan,

5247
02:28:52,281 --> 02:28:53,300
I moved to the Hudson Valley.

5248
02:28:53,630 --> 02:28:54,201
It's cool up there,

5249
02:28:54,201 --> 02:28:54,560
right?

5250
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:54,771
Yeah,

5251
02:28:54,771 --> 02:28:55,191
absolutely.

5252
02:28:55,191 --> 02:28:56,001
It's cold in the winter though.

5253
02:28:56,001 --> 02:28:56,470
No.

5254
02:28:56,470 --> 02:28:56,870
Yeah.

5255
02:28:56,870 --> 02:28:58,420
If you ever make it northeast,

5256
02:28:58,430 --> 02:28:59,330
we'd love to.

5257
02:28:59,450 --> 02:29:00,740
How far is it from New York City?

5258
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:03,680
It's a car drive about a hour and a half.

5259
02:29:03,710 --> 02:29:03,831
Oh,

5260
02:29:03,831 --> 02:29:04,550
that's nothing.

5261
02:29:04,550 --> 02:29:04,641
Oh,

5262
02:29:04,641 --> 02:29:05,131
that's great.

5263
02:29:05,131 --> 02:29:05,570
You know,

5264
02:29:05,570 --> 02:29:06,890
it's also a metro north.

5265
02:29:06,900 --> 02:29:07,611
You can take the,

5266
02:29:07,611 --> 02:29:07,880
uh,

5267
02:29:07,880 --> 02:29:08,890
from grand central.

5268
02:29:08,910 --> 02:29:10,670
You can walk from the station there.

5269
02:29:10,760 --> 02:29:13,880
I would love to come check it out and
I absolutely want to come once it's all

5270
02:29:13,881 --> 02:29:16,090
done just to see how crazy it's kind of,

5271
02:29:16,091 --> 02:29:17,450
maybe you can help us kick it off.

5272
02:29:17,500 --> 02:29:17,750
Yeah,

5273
02:29:17,750 --> 02:29:18,321
for sure.

5274
02:29:18,321 --> 02:29:18,531
Yeah,

5275
02:29:18,531 --> 02:29:18,800
let's,

5276
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:20,810
let's do some sort of
a party or something.

5277
02:29:21,060 --> 02:29:21,500
Yeah.

5278
02:29:21,500 --> 02:29:23,360
But all Tracy hippies out there,

5279
02:29:23,630 --> 02:29:24,463
keep it together.

5280
02:29:24,740 --> 02:29:26,060
Don't get to 90 at this party.

5281
02:29:26,710 --> 02:29:27,051
You know,

5282
02:29:27,051 --> 02:29:27,351
Alex,

5283
02:29:27,351 --> 02:29:28,001
great to cast.

5284
02:29:28,001 --> 02:29:28,834
And it changed him.

5285
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:30,290
So I'm going to take it all.

5286
02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:31,540
No,

5287
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:32,450
not at the party.

5288
02:29:32,700 --> 02:29:34,220
Find a nice peaceful,

5289
02:29:34,230 --> 02:29:35,660
quiet spot in the woods.

5290
02:29:35,810 --> 02:29:36,740
Find Nice spot in the woods.

5291
02:29:36,890 --> 02:29:38,480
So it's Alex grey.com.

5292
02:29:38,481 --> 02:29:38,960

5293
02:29:38,960 --> 02:29:40,280

5294

Great.

5299
02:29:47,381 --> 02:29:51,290
Cause I'm right now you got 22,511.

5300
02:29:51,560 --> 02:29:56,560
Let's see if we could boost that
shit up to 22,600 PBS again,

5301
02:29:57,470 --> 02:29:58,303
I went PBS again.

this,

5305
02:30:01,401 --> 02:30:02,900
it's an awesome cause
if you've got the cash,

5306
02:30:02,901 --> 02:30:03,321
if you don't,

5307
02:30:03,321 --> 02:30:03,890
you know,

5308
02:30:03,890 --> 02:30:04,723
don't do it.

5309
02:30:04,750 --> 02:30:05,240
Um,

5310
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:07,160
thank you everybody for tuning in.

I gotta record that shit
cause it sounds so repetitive.

5340
02:30:48,381 --> 02:30:49,280
I'm broken.

5341
02:30:49,310 --> 02:30:50,840
I can't say it anymore.

5342
