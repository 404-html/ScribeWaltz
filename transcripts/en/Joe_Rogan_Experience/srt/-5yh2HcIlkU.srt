1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,720
Slums.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,410
We want man.

3
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:01,521
No,

4
00:00:01,521 --> 00:00:01,581
no,

5
00:00:01,581 --> 00:00:01,680
no.

6
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,340
I'm good.

7
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,173
Here we go.

8
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,093
Four,

9
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,963
three,

10
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,953
two.

11
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,360
Yes.

12
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,760
Alex Jones were alive.

13
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,381
Wow.

14
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:15,210
It's going to be back
for the second visit.

15
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,231
It's good to be here,

16
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:16,680
man.

17
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,400
It's good to see you.

18
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,050
We've got Trump meeting with Kim Jong.

19
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,300
I'm,

20
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,720
we've got the colon hearings in Congress.

21
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:22,860
A lot of energy going on.

22
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,250
Well,

23
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,260
a lot of things are happening.

24
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,850
Planets are aligned.

25
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,210
Uh,

26
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,740
we should tell everybody
that you and I had with,

27
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:29,061
first of all,

28
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:30,560
we had a long conversation on the phone,

29
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,260
which led to just a lot of talk.

30
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,490
You were driving to Vegas a few weeks,

31
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,563
hour and a half,

32
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,780
and then we decided to do another podcast
and we cleared the air on the phone.

33
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,190
We decided to clear the
air more on a podcast.

34
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,020
There's a lot of things going on.

35
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:45,883
Um,

36
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,770
I told you a long time ago
that it would have you back on.

37
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,900
And uh,

38
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,120
in the interest of
being completely honest,

39
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:53,991
there was,

40
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:55,460
I was hesitant to do it.

41
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:57,110
Not because it didn't want to talk to you,

42
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,230
but because of just the amount of bullshit
that I get from people that get angry

43
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:03,650
that you and I are friends.

44
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,761
You know that.

45
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:06,200
Why give that guy a platform?

46
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,771
That's the big one.

47
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:08,090
Why give that guy a platform?

48
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:08,924
That's the big one,

49
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,620
you know?

50
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,020
But you and I have always
had a good time together.

51
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:12,740
We was up.

52
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,580
We've always had fun together are only
problems have always been when we're not

53
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,550
like if you're talking about
me or if I'm talking about you,

54
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,720
not if we're talking to each other.

55
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,750
It's the distance has been
the props to the telephone,

56
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,000
lack of communication.

57
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,550
The lack of communication
has been the problem.

58
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,700
The thing that people are upset about you.

59
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:33,020
The thing that we wanted to talk about,

60
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,180
like quick to get it over with or not.

61
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:35,691
Not Quick,

62
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:37,310
but just to get it upfront.

63
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,203
That's the best way.

64
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,680
Misrepresentative yes.

65
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,860
Is the sandy hooks.

66
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,450
Yes.

67
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,230
Yeah.

68
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,063
So

69
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,950
your take on it,

70
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,420
just give me your take on it.

71
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,350
Well first off,

72
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,060
because it's always misrepresented.

73
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,590
I believe mass shootings happen and
they're real tragedies and I believe

74
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:57,424
Parklawn happened.

75
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,940
And you believe Sandy Hook Cap?

76
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,833
Absolutely.

77
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,010
And now just last year the
media came out and said,

78
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:09,810
Alex Jones says Parkland didn't happen
and he sending people to Parkland

79
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:12,010
parents' houses and there was no video.

80
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:13,030
No audio wasn't true.

81
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:13,191
I'd,

82
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:14,650
in fact I said I believe
Parkland happened.

83
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,650
So I'm not going to be the
mass shooting denial guy.

84
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,830
I have been branded as the sandy hook.

85
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:24,831
I mean imagine a final cut
pro video editing timeline
and you go back almost was

86
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,860
seven years ago,

87
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,240
I guess it's more than seven years now
and the Internet didn't believe some of

88
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:32,320
the things about sandy hook.

89
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,110
I started covering it weeks after my first
articles and things are all this will

90
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:39,670
be used for gun control and I bet the
guys on Prozac and a mental patient,

91
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:42,460
which he was of course in
about couple weeks into it,

92
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,490
my listeners and other sorts of sending
me all these anomalies and things and

93
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,620
later turned out some of those anomalies
weren't accurate and that I just moved

94
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:51,250
on from it.

95
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:51,760
Okay.

96
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:51,941
I mean,

97
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:52,810
I'm not Adam Lanza.

98
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:53,710
I didn't kill those kids.

99
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:55,300
But when I'm on the streets now,

100
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,800
people don't know who Adam Lanza is.

101
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:57,910
The guy that killed those kids,

102
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,680
they think me.

103
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,930
They say actually I believe or not in
prison of what you need to sandy hook all

104
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:03,850
the CEO is Alex Jones.

105
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,500
Shani hooked dead kids show.

106
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,723
Well I don't think that's,

107
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,450
I think the majority of them are angry
because the narrative has been that

108
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:13,420
you're sending people to the
sandy hook families hopes homes.

109
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:13,931
Exactly.

110
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,400
And you'll never have the,

111
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:18,670
you're responsible for these people
getting harassed because you said on your

112
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:20,980
radio show that it wasn't real.

113
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,490
Yes,

114
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,460
there is video and audio of me saying
I can see how people don't think it

115
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:27,310
happened and I can see how people think
it's synthetic cause there's been stage

116
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:30,310
events before that then gets edited,

117
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:30,881
put together,

118
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:31,720
cobbled together.

119
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,910
But I never said go to people's houses.

120
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:37,420
I never said go investigated you to
say that you think it's not real.

121
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,343
Yes I did.

122
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,070
But now you do think it's real because
I learned some of the anomalies were not

123
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:42,820
accurate.

124
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,130
That's a problem with
all this conspiracy shit.

125
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,580
Right?

126
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,650
Cause the conspiracy theory stuff,

127
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,150
the people that want to
believe they believe in
conspiracies with everything and

128
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:53,380
I think there's a certain percent,

129
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:55,540
and we talked about this
just a few minutes ago.

130
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:55,691
Yeah.

131
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:58,150
When I started getting
accused for years ago,

132
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,440
a couple of years until,

133
00:03:59,440 --> 00:03:59,951
and I should know,

134
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:00,784
I think it happened

135
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,440
then people that I had interviewed and
things short of saying he's involved.

136
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:07,274
He's one of them.

137
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,290
Because you are now
saying that it happened.

138
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,790
They thought that you
had been compromised.

139
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,181
Yes.

140
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:12,070
And then I wrote her realizing,

141
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh this is how it works.

142
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,770
A certain percentage of
people are schizophrenia.

143
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,490
Exactly.

144
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,140
And then they just think
everything's a conspiracy.

145
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,480
This is a thing about conspiracies.

146
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:22,790
It's very attractive to
people that are schizophrenia,

147
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,781
schizophrenia.

148
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:26,360
People think everything's a fucking
conspiracy from top to bottom.

149
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:30,020
Every single interaction that people
have is some sort of a stage event that's

150
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:33,830
trying to take them down or
control this or mind control that.

151
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,520
That's a big factor in a lot
of this conspiracy theory shit.

152
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,660
His mental illness.

153
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,280
When I started having people come to the
office Shang that I'm a Beau bridges or

154
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:48,030
that I'm Jeff Bridges or
that I am of your bill.

155
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,480
Hey Bill Hicks and people
in restaurant screaming,

156
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,381
Fq Bill,

157
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:52,011
we know it's you.

158
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:52,131
It's,

159
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:54,410
it's kind of like Dan rather
than the got threatening me.

160
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:55,161
I'll watch the Seconal.

161
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:55,431
Dan,

162
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:58,490
what's the [inaudible]
what I've experienced now,

163
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:02,030
the quote fame of being super
famous made the conspiracy guy.

164
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,090
I was legitimately questioning
things because of Gulf of Tonkin.

165
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:06,350
Northwoods thinks it really happened.

166
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,050
Babies that weren't throwing to
incubators are going to snare rack war,

167
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,760
but I kind of realized a few years ago
that I kind of had my own mild psychosis

168
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,180
in that when you've been lied to by the
media and the culture so much over and

169
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:18,014
over again,

170
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:18,891
everything,

171
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:20,840
then it starts becoming automatically.

172
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:23,510
You're sure it's fake and then
everything you she fits into that.

173
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:24,961
This would probably,

174
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:28,280
you'll get four or five years ago I
began to realize because I was on the

175
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:31,520
receiving end of people pulling up
in white vans with guns at my office.

176
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:32,000
Chang,

177
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,450
I know you put a microchip in my head,

178
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,293
I'm going to kill you.

179
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,391
And so it was kind of like,

180
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:36,650
once I got super famous,

181
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,341
it was like,

182
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:38,174
whoa.

183
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,720
There's a certain percentage of people
that are way off on the spectrum where

184
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:43,860
they believe everything's fake.

185
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,320
And then there's people that believe
everything they hear is true.

186
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:46,711
I mean,

187
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:47,430
you should be,

188
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,360
you should be questioning,

189
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,530
you should have the right to do it.

190
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:49,921
But,

191
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:50,910
but it's somewhere in the middle.

192
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,090
And so this is what I'll
say about sandy hook.

193
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,040
I legitimately questioned
it when people brought

194
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,120
up anomalies.

195
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,100
I then had debates about it on both sides.

196
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,930
The Internet pushed me
to keep covering it.

197
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:06,080
I probably covered it 20 times in
the first few years that happened.

198
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,600
And then as soon as I questioned it,

199
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,680
uh,

200
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,540
not being staged,

201
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,070
I got a so much that I said,

202
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:13,904
screw it.

203
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,020
Mass shootings happen.

204
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,641
I believe it happened.

205
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:18,510
But then media would call me or,

206
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,460
or interview me and say,

207
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,513
okay,

208
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,600
but tell us the anomalies
of why you questioned.

209
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,580
They were getting me to say it again.

210
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,980
Not that I didn't have
the right to question it,

211
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:28,290
but they,

212
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:28,881
they thought,

213
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:30,500
well Alex Jones versus Ted kids,

214
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,070
Alex Jones denying and Alex Jones,

215
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:32,900
Jurassic families,

216
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,200
this is a perfect way to get this guy
who's so popular getting people to

217
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:37,370
question and getting people to think.

218
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,350
And so it took me years,

219
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:39,981
I think I'm smart.

220
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,810
I guess I'm not to figure
out what's going on.

221
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,740
So when Hillary,

222
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,300
few months before the election,

223
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,560
it gives us huge speech and says,

224
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:46,940
Alex Jones as a dark heart,

225
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,210
he knows sandy hook kids died.

226
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,870
But he says they didn't and
he sends people their houses.

227
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,980
He's the worst guy in the world.

228
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,881
So I came out and I said,

229
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,480
listen,

230
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,830
I never sent anybody to houses,

231
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:58,611
but I apologize.

232
00:06:58,611 --> 00:06:59,630
It was taken out of context.

233
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,920
People have a right to question,

234
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,200
but I am sorry for the families and
I'm sorry for your hurt and I get it.

235
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:05,810
And I've experienced crazy people now.

236
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,861
Big Time.

237
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:07,611
Just like you have,

238
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:09,920
please stop saying that.

239
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,660
I'm saying it didn't happen.

240
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,990
Please stop saying I'm
sending people who was houses.

241
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:18,380
Cause here's what happens when they
put it on every major TV channel,

242
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:19,520
local TV channels,

243
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:20,354
radio,

244
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,360
I mean thousands of articles
that get syndicated.

245
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,830
And I said 100,000 articles,

246
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:25,700
that's a low number.

247
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,810
The amount of sandy hook coverage
against me has been so insane.

248
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:32,870
It's so huge because it's supposed to
be the first domino that once I'm taking

249
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:34,280
down that all the dominoes fall.

250
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,750
Well it's also clickbait.

251
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,570
There's also a thing if he say Alex Jones,

252
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,640
Sandy Hook and you put in a title,

253
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:41,371
a certain amount of people,

254
00:07:41,371 --> 00:07:42,204
we just kind of click on it.

255
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,670
Alex Jones is still pushing a sandy hook
conspiracy theories one that I saw just

256
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:47,504
two days ago.

257
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,711
Exactly.

258
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:49,041
So,

259
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:53,300
so this is the point I've
gotten to is here's the key.

260
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,461
They didn't,

261
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:56,310
they say more people are showing up in,

262
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:58,310
in Connecticut and more people
are coming to their houses,

263
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,540
which they are because the media is
all over the news saying there's a big

264
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,710
conspiracy here.

265
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,570
Alex Jones says it doesn't happen.

266
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,000
And so people then hear it and they think,

267
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,690
oh,

268
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:08,991
you know,

269
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:10,940
it's like looking for the
moth man or something.

270
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,290
They're all running up there in the media
saying it in my name and I'm saying,

271
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:15,501
no,

272
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:17,000
I believe it happened years ago.

273
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,510
And so then I'm getting the blame and
the attacks and the demonization of the

274
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:24,380
threats for what the corporate media
is saying over and over again that I'm

275
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:25,460
saying that it didn't happen.

276
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,130
And the families are getting the
threats and the families are getting the

277
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:30,770
attacks and the families are
getting called crisis actors.

278
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,053
Yes.

279
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,580
And then he can see something different.

280
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,681
Oh my God.

281
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:37,514
In hindsight,

282
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,211
absolutely.

283
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:38,601
But again,

284
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:43,601
I legitimately didn't think my show was
as powerful as it was show that I wasn't

285
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:47,540
retrospectively looking at everything
I was doing as much as I should.

286
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,523
Nobody's perfect.

287
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,010
I mean,

288
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,821
as you get older,

289
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,960
you grow and you learn things.

290
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,440
But I just began to realize about
three years ago that they're making my

291
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:56,930
identity not being a national,

292
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:57,990
it's not being a populace,

293
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,520
not being a free market guy.

294
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,670
They're making my whole
identity sandy hook.

295
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,340
And I didn't know they
were going to sue me then.

296
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:05,491
Well,

297
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:07,530
it's just because that's what gets clicks.

298
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,831
Yes,

299
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:08,250
but then,

300
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,720
but then before I ever got sued,

301
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,351
I said,

302
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,580
I believe Sandy Hook happened.

303
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,590
That should not my identity
I barely ever covered.

304
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:14,280
It's stop.

305
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,491
Right,

306
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:15,700
but you understand that
it's not what they're doing.

307
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:17,940
They're not trying to make his
weakness and made it even worse,

308
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,830
but they're not trying
to make your identity.

309
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,740
They're not trying to define you
or do some sort of a documenter,

310
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,990
a biography on your life.

311
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,500
They're just finding something that
people want to pay attention to.

312
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,600
This is one of the problems with,

313
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,320
with news coverage today is that they
find things that people want to pay

314
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:38,650
attention to and they focus on
them out of proportionate portion.

315
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,620
They say that I'm making money off sandy
hook when when the newspapers and the

316
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:48,470
publishing houses are using me as
a way to put out that had Shinier,

317
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,090
very hurtful thing to be hurtful.

318
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,030
I didn't mean to be in senior year.

319
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,720
I was legitimately questioning
because the Internet was,

320
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,910
and asking a bunch of other
stage stuff and then I say,

321
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:57,330
hey,

322
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:57,991
take it back.

323
00:09:57,991 --> 00:09:58,824
Don't do it.

324
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,281
And they go,

325
00:09:59,281 --> 00:09:59,611
no,

326
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:03,510
we're going to commit this hurtful
thing that's chill free speech,

327
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:05,820
but it's hurtful in your fricking name.

328
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,351
And then,

329
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:08,130
and then that's why I'm not
saying I'm the victim here.

330
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,220
I'm saying stop it because everything
they do about the platform,

331
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:11,401
I mean,

332
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,080
the biggest frustration
is I still have my huge

333
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:18,081
audience@radiostationsandinfowars.com
and [inaudible] dot com but reaching new

334
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:19,350
people's very hard.

335
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,970
And then now that I've been silenced,

336
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,400
the mainstream media could
say whatever they want,

337
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:23,910
Joe,

338
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,510
about you,

339
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,111
about me,

340
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:25,801
and I can't respond.

341
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:26,290
I mean,

342
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,560
you can go to Youtube
and type in Alex Jones.

343
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:28,771
Well,

344
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:31,590
this is where you'll and the negative
stuff and there's one that says white

345
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:34,260
supremacy and Alex Jones
and you click on it.

346
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,270
It's a famous British
actor and author saying,

347
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,650
Alex Jones says,

348
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,130
kill the a of families of,

349
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,740
of Parkland parents.

350
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,230
And I'm actually having lawyers
getting ready to fall suit over this.

351
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,650
I warn the guy shouldn't letters,

352
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:48,151
he didn't take it.

353
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:49,260
Now I have to,

354
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,300
you could pull up this
famous British actor,

355
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:51,571
I forget,

356
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:52,051
I forget his name.

357
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,760
He can pull up just just typing
in Alex Jones at Youtube.

358
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:55,590
All the main stuff's put up on top.

359
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,830
It's like the seventh eighth link and
it says Alex Jones and white supremacy

360
00:10:58,831 --> 00:10:59,664
what to do about it.

361
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,390
And he says,

362
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,730
Alex Jones and the lights
of premise are saying,

363
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:06,910
go to the people's houses at Parkland
and kill the parents and we have to take

364
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:07,741
him off the air because he says,

365
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:08,574
kill the parents.

366
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,350
There's no free speech
for killing parents.

367
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,161
And I'm like,

368
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:11,994
dude,

369
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,030
do not say that I'm going to get killed.

370
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:15,750
I mean,

371
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,880
I am never said nobody died at Parkland.

372
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:20,160
And I sure as hell didn't
say kill their parents.

373
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:20,400
Let's,

374
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,230
let's go now.

375
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,250
Can you talk about fake news?

376
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,930
They have green lighted making,

377
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,850
anything you can imagine up about me.

378
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:27,821
And,

379
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,580
and it's like insane.

380
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,920
And that's all I'm saying is,

381
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:36,180
is that at a certain
point it's like Jesus,

382
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,400
again,

383
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,710
let's,

384
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,880
let's take this step by step.

385
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,760
I'm sorry.

386
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,593
It's okay.

387
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:40,940
This,

388
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,870
and this is where we want to give you
an opportunity to communicate and clear

389
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,830
the air and talk and some of the shit
that you and I talked about earlier.

390
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,533
Um,

391
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,230
there's a bunch of things going on.

392
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,980
One,

393
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,813
there's,

394
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,190
it's a story that attracts
people's attention,

395
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,163
right?

396
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,490
A story of a guy who sang that people
didn't get killed when they did get

397
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:04,150
killed.

398
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,690
And it's horrific for people to,

399
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,543
to look at.

400
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,520
It's terrific to people to think about
that their own children who not only get

401
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:09,911
murdered,

402
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:13,000
but then someone would accuse
them of being a crisis actor.

403
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,980
So then they start pushing that story and
that story becomes something that they

404
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:18,970
make money off of,

405
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,880
which is really in some
ways kind of ironic.

406
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,740
They keep this story in the news and
they keep getting clicks off of you and

407
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:28,930
misrepresenting some of the
things that you've said.

408
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,500
Yes.

409
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:29,711
And,

410
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:29,861
and,

411
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:34,450
and some of the things that you said
you wish you hadn't said to like that's

412
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,810
also real but,

413
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,031
but,

414
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:37,000
but I mean let's be clear,

415
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,310
I'm not even defending my shelf.

416
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:40,840
People learn stuff as you get older.

417
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,321
Hindsight,

418
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:41,770
you're like,

419
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,603
why did I do that?

420
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,520
Like I used to whatever was the
big hot thing on the Internet.

421
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,010
I would just debate it cause
it was interesting with this,

422
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,890
what I wanted to get to you,

423
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,460
you were doing this show and in this
show you're on the air hours and hours a

424
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,760
day and you're ranting about
all these various things.

425
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:58,650
Is,

426
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:58,950
is,

427
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,940
is it fair to say that you weren't really
100% aware of what kind of influence

428
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:04,774
you were having?

429
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,680
Absolutely.

430
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,240
If you did know,

431
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,150
you would phrase things differently
and done things differently,

432
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,010
you know,

433
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,220
it's even beyond that.

434
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:13,720
I was just younger and,

435
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,840
and I was covering what
other people were saying.

436
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,180
I was not the first the
10th or a hundredth,

437
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:23,080
the 10000th you're reading about it on
the Internet was a firestorm all over the

438
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,490
news that people are denying it.

439
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,020
And I've got producers going,

440
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:26,171
hey,

441
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:27,040
look at this video.

442
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,370
But isn't that the problem with
every single national tragedy?

443
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,960
Anytime something happens,

444
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,290
there's a certain amount of people that
think that there's a conspiracy even

445
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,670
when it's just a plane crash,

446
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,460
even when it's just what
it fill in the blanks.

447
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:40,840
Any sort of national,

448
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,620
exactly.

449
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,580
All I'm shaking ish.

450
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,720
Shandy hooked up the hill on dying on I,

451
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,030
I support people's right to question
and I understand because there's been so

452
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,600
much lying and corporate
media and by governments and,

453
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:54,871
and,

454
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:55,100
and,

455
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,440
and staged events that are admitted in
declassified that once people see that

456
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:02,500
one thing was staged than
everything else must be stage.

457
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,890
And then I have been on the receiving
end of literally thousands of made up

458
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:09,334
conspiracies,

459
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,790
which you'll laugh at until people
in a truck with guns show up.

460
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:13,490
Yeah.

461
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:18,040
And so I understand part of
this is the complex world.

462
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,260
We live in all the information
we have more than ever.

463
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:26,220
And a lot of it is all the drugs people
that are on and it's just a lot of it is

464
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:27,214
schizophrenia.

465
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,780
This is a big problem.

466
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,370
A big,

467
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,160
I mean we were talking about this
certain percentage of beings.

468
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,600
Half of Brazil has the,

469
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,820
he has the brain warm that
makes you basically psychotic.

470
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:37,541
Well,

471
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,060
it doesn't make you psychotic
and your risk taking crazy.

472
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:41,170
It affects your judgment.

473
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,400
This is toxic programs.

474
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:43,850
You'd want to have more cats smell,

475
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,231
piss.

476
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:44,830
Yes.

477
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,380
Well it definitely does that to,

478
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,141
to rats.

479
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:50,410
It actually reprograms rat's brains
makes them sexually attracted.

480
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,890
There's much of parasites.

481
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,521
Yes,

482
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:54,560
there's a bunch of them and there's
some that probably haven't even been

483
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,041
identified.

484
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,020
That's where the whole crazy
cat lady thing comes from.

485
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:57,680
Yes,

486
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,550
that's exactly what it is.

487
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:00,680
It's one of the reasons why they tell
women when they're pregnant to stay the

488
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:01,700
fuck away from cat litter.

489
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,630
Don't touch cat litter.

490
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:03,890
Don't go on as your major cats.

491
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,330
Yes,

492
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:04,460
you,

493
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:04,700
you,

494
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,170
I mean it's,

495
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,400
it can be actually fatal for babies,

496
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,540
but what I'm trying to get the ledgers
where they should kill the damn cash.

497
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:11,871
Well,

498
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,280
I'm sure there's a lot of factors there,

499
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:13,520
right?

500
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:13,790
She,

501
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,110
old wives tales were like,

502
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,750
you get demon possessed
by that cat and it really,

503
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:18,740
it's a damn brain warm.

504
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,340
But that's probably also
why they told you not to.

505
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,800
That's a real bright,

506
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,080
warm programming you,

507
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:23,811
like you were saying earlier,

508
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:24,030
it's,

509
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,361
I looked at,

510
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:24,651
it's true,

511
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:28,130
I didn't know that at the top soccer's
teams have the highest level of brain

512
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:28,941
worm infestation.

513
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:29,391
Well it's,

514
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:33,620
there's a disproportionate amount of
people that live in countries where the

515
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:36,890
high toxoplasmosis infection would
say it's successful soccer teams.

516
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,970
There was some study that
was done on that where,

517
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:39,140
uh,

518
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,220
we had a doctor [inaudible] women that
have become more sexually promiscuous.

519
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:44,780
Yes.

520
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,410
It's recklessness.

521
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:45,740
Yes.

522
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,900
And they think the men are more
reckless and that's why there's a

523
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:51,320
disproportionate amount of motorcycle
victims that tests positive for

524
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:52,340
toxoplasmosis.

525
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,890
This is where the Robert Sapolsky at
Stanford University was telling us,

526
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,930
is there a way to remove,

527
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,330
I don't think [inaudible]
I don't think there is.

528
00:15:59,740 --> 00:15:59,840
Well,

529
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,021
you know,

530
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:00,920
there's like snails,

531
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,250
they get a brain warm that programs are
the top of a tree shall birds eat it.

532
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,570
Yeah.

533
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:04,890
And then,

534
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,940
and then it's crapped out and the snails
eat that and then go and it's just food

535
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:08,241
cycle.

536
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:08,571
Yes.

537
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:09,404
Yes.

538
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,660
Don't tell me in classic evolution.

539
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,520
And I'm also believe
the interpretation by,

540
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:15,590
by right wingers the of the Bible.

541
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:16,424
That's not what it says.

542
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,860
But obviously evolution and
there's a big quick jumps,

543
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,360
but we know what's going on.

544
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:21,440
But the idea that just,

545
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:25,040
there's a worms and there's all these
different [inaudible] the one that gets

546
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:25,874
into a grasshopper,

547
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,280
the aquatic worm gets inside
of a grasshopper's body
and gets the grasshopper to

548
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,150
commit suicide,

549
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,110
gets a grasshopper to jump into water
and drown and then it comes out of its

550
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:36,620
body.

551
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,910
And that's where it lives.

552
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,810
It lives in the water.

553
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,970
So it literally gets its
host to commit suicide.

554
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:42,380
And that chain of events,

555
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,550
how does that evolve where suddenly
a worm gets into grasshopper and does

556
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:46,821
something,

557
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:48,290
a supercomputer couldn't do it,

558
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,820
it programs to drown itself?

559
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,061
Well,

560
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,010
this is a matter of complex biology.

561
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,311
I mean,

562
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:57,311
so I think it's insanely complex and it's
something that scientists are studying

563
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:59,180
on a daily basis coming up.

564
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:03,170
Cause I'm gonna cause I don't wanna just
talk about me all day and I appreciate

565
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:04,010
you having me on here to do it.

566
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:04,221
And I,

567
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:05,780
and I know I don't have a talking point.

568
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,340
I don't have a PR firm.

569
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:07,821
You know,

570
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:08,440
we've talked before,

571
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,610
went on air about what am I going to,

572
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:10,520
I mean,

573
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,731
Alex,

574
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,770
what do you want to say today
so you can help me get it out.

575
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,730
I don't know.

576
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,390
I'm alive.

577
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,620
I want to say a bunch of things.

578
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,180
I'm only learning how this works,

579
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,010
being in the process of it,

580
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:22,610
and it's given me a much bigger view than
a new 23 years ago when I first got on

581
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:26,730
air because I've experienced
what other people have sheds,

582
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,160
bad things I did experience.

583
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,360
I did it from a good heart,

584
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,620
I believe.

585
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:31,550
Question was okay,

586
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,380
I was covering other people questioning,

587
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,560
but then there's a weird sick irony in
the media that says that I'm the one that

588
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:45,170
pregenerated sandy hook didn't happen
when I wasn't too then in my name.

589
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,670
Popularize it to a level of like they've
put out more stability as a [inaudible]

590
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:49,830
me.

591
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,050
This is

592
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,610
key.

593
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,800
Then before you invade a major country,

594
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,690
I mean this has been going on for years.

595
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:55,291
Every day,

596
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:55,831
the news,

597
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:56,460
the print,

598
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,600
no one died at sandy hook.

599
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:58,470
Alex Jones says,

600
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,390
Alex Jones has go to their
houses and hurt them.

601
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:01,680
What the hell is it for?

602
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,290
It goes on and on and on and on.

603
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,690
You're thinking this
because it's about you,

604
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,640
so because it's about you,

605
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:12,390
it becomes a primary point of focus
because it's affecting your life and it's

606
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,740
something that you're concentrating on,

607
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,060
but the volume is massive.

608
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,511
It is.

609
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,840
Volume is massive because it's
something that generates interest.

610
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,770
This is part of the problem
with the way we do news today.

611
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,720
Anything that generates interest,

612
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,850
I mean if the it,

613
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,791
honestly,

614
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,290
if the media really cared,

615
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,690
they probably would have
never talked about it.

616
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,170
They probably would have never brought
it up so that we had real terror attacks

617
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:36,870
in the sixties and seventies
that weren't staged a,

618
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:40,740
if you go back and look at them like the
weathermen and all that stuff and the

619
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:42,330
government and the media didn't cover it,

620
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,560
well this is a long time ago,

621
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,570
but they didn't cover because it gives,

622
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,130
if you cover terrorists,

623
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:47,820
they do it more.

624
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,150
Right.

625
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,660
That's true.

626
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,440
I was agreeing with you.

627
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,710
Yeah.

628
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:49,951
Okay.

629
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:50,310
That's true.

630
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,720
That's like another countries.

631
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:54,750
They don't print the name of mass shooters
in the newspaper because they don't

632
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:56,250
want people to get attention for that.

633
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,301
I mean,

634
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:58,500
some different cultures,

635
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,410
which is a philosophy.

636
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,660
I genuinely,

637
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,520
I've known you 20 years or so.

638
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:05,790
It's like 1998 99 I genuinely really,

639
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,810
I'm trying to find the truth.

640
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,120
And I realized that once I saw a bunch
of declassified staged events like

641
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:16,800
Northwoods or like Gladio or locked
off the tank and all the Tonkin or,

642
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,041
or,

643
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,140
or Jesse Smollett,

644
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:18,381
I mean,

645
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:18,991
I couldn't help it.

646
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,450
I knew he'd probably show me
the day after it happened.

647
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:21,811
I said,

648
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:25,850
the guy's got a noose around his
neck at 2:00 AM and in Chicago,

649
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,130
fuck has a noose in Chicago
who's walking around with a news,

650
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,550
who even knows how to write,

651
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:30,661
who,

652
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:32,770
who knows how to make a noose like who?

653
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,290
And the cops show up 40 something minutes
later and he's like the door with a

654
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,800
noose around a snack
in the subway sandwich.

655
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,280
Fake.

656
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,390
Yeah.

657
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,820
But I said,

658
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,271
sue,

659
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:42,451
me,

660
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:43,960
destroy me by it's fate.

661
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,670
I can't help it.

662
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:44,911
But see,

663
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:45,850
the problem is that's the,

664
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,310
that's where the psychosis comes in.

665
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,530
Because if you,

666
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,450
if you're a little kid is,

667
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:52,680
I've been reading more about psychology.

668
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm trying to understand this stuff.

669
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,090
If you're a little kid and somebody was
red hair beat you and tortured you say,

670
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,260
man with red hair,

671
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:02,130
I'm just a hypothetical.

672
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,491
What?

673
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,140
We are going to not
like guys with red hair.

674
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,370
So,

675
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:04,660
so,

676
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,493
so it's kind of like,

677
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,870
or if you've been lied to as a kid,

678
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,261
let it,

679
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:08,370
that's what creates mental illness layer,

680
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:08,670
right?

681
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,880
So we've been lucky with the media and
the corporate system and seeing all these

682
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:13,140
fake hoaxes and you know,

683
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:16,290
the fake stuff about Cavenaugh and the
face of about the coverage of kids and

684
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,430
the face of about smaller,

685
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,941
she,

686
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:19,110
that's now the public.

687
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,530
Actually,

688
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,363
here's what's happening.

689
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,250
I'm getting huge backlash and small it,

690
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,030
it's not,

691
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,720
it's not,

692
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,081
wait a minute.

693
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:28,170
Who's given you backlash
from the public are like,

694
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,680
Hey,

695
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,760
smallest fake.

696
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,410
The coverage of kids are fake.

697
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,270
A Balaji forward.

698
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,100
Most of these women said it was all fake.

699
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,280
So why are you saying Sandy Hook's real?

700
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:39,540
Everything's fake and it's like,

701
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:39,841
no,

702
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:40,350
dude,

703
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,590
everything's not fake.

704
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,880
That's what I'm saying is the
differential is gone and so yeah,

705
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:47,350
there's a bunch of fake stuff and
we have a right to question it,

706
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,333
but now,

707
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,001
now,

708
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:50,920
then now the general public,

709
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:52,500
my fans believe everything say,

710
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,530
but let me stop you there.

711
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,101
I'm ranting.

712
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:54,430
I just,

713
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:54,881
it's okay.

714
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:55,990
I want you to read this,

715
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:56,824
but this is,

716
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,570
this is the nature of the beast.

717
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,090
This is what you're selling
to a lot of these people,

718
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,350
this is why they're tuning into you.

719
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:07,590
They want to hear you uncover conspiracies
and some of them aren't as bright as

720
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:10,480
others and some of them can't see logic.

721
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,321
They don't see it.

722
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,190
They don't understand them.

723
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:13,480
Legitimately questioning.

724
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,160
I don't just think everything's fake.

725
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,290
I know you don't listen.

726
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,060
I think if you never
talked about Sandy Hook,

727
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:20,050
you'd have no problems.

728
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,040
I really do believe that.

729
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,480
I believe there'd be problems.

730
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,990
I think people would look down on you
and call you a right wing lunatic and all

731
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:26,824
sorts of other things,

732
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,790
which they don't even know.

733
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,410
When I knew you when I first knew you,

734
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,050
you were getting arrested
for going after George Bush.

735
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,220
I remember when George,

736
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,530
you are not a right one to
ask him a question at me.

737
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,240
Well you,

738
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,581
you were,

739
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:40,000
you were asking him a pertinent question
about the CFR in his dad's drug.

740
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,480
Yes,

741
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,290
exactly.

742
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,123
Exactly.

743
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,320
And this was the guy that was running
for president as a Republican and you,

744
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,570
you were getting arrested
for and Contra the CFR.

745
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,160
But my point is you weren't,

746
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,560
you weren't a tie to a party.

747
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,630
You were trying to find the truth.

748
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:56,060
And I don't know.

749
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,940
You're afraid when I aligned with Trump,

750
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,500
that's when all hell broke loose.

751
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,813
Yeah,

752
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,210
yeah.

753
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,200
That was part of it.

754
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,210
I think that was definitely Hillary image.

755
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,770
She looked at my whole bio and shed
Shanti Hook hit him on that right now.

756
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:09,701
Uh,

757
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:11,200
do you still communicate with Trump?

758
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,090
Not In a while.

759
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:14,570
And I,

760
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:14,990
I,

761
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,560
I,

762
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,610
it becomes a big issue.

763
00:22:16,611 --> 00:22:16,810
I mean,

764
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,370
I obviously communicate with surrogates
and people who talked to Trump,

765
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,151
I mean,

766
00:22:20,151 --> 00:22:21,930
don Jr was on Tucker Carlson last night.

767
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:24,950
They were talking about me and saying
what happened was wrong and the fact that

768
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:29,270
they've used me as the way to start the
cashless society and then and then and

769
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:31,790
then I'm gonna imagine they're never
supposed to block somebody from banking of

770
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,620
they have a good record.

771
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:34,454
It's not fraud.

772
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,300
Here's a whole other story.

773
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:41,170
I had an a plus plus rating with my
shopping cart and bank accounts that I had

774
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:45,050
for 22 years and banks
looked at it and said,

775
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:48,650
we've quite frankly never seen anybody
with a credit rating this high cause you

776
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:50,840
never even do charge backs
with our shopping cart.

777
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,280
If people do that,

778
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:52,850
what does that mean?

779
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,630
Chargebacks points?

780
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,730
We have the best credit tourist,

781
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,520
a group out of Boston,

782
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,380
which I'm not going to mention
here for your show and things,

783
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:05,210
but we're preparing litigation against
who does the writings to secret rating

784
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:07,400
system for like Taliban and al Qaeda.

785
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:12,280
The Mafia that's that's given to bank
executives two days before paypal bandits.

786
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,830
They put a hate designation from
the southern poverty law center.

787
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,840
Shang I'm basically a terrorist.

788
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,850
So when they call you a hate personnel,

789
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,470
it means a terrorist in Interpol.

790
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,390
So all over the Western world I am
listed and we would sent documents out of

791
00:23:26,391 --> 00:23:29,600
England and out of the u s that we were
sent this by High Level Bank of people

792
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:30,434
that are freaked out.

793
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,280
We make contacts,

794
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:31,880
lawyers texted,

795
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,713
they can't believe it,

796
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,470
they have designated me as
an international terrorists
and that's how they took

797
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:41,471
five of my six bank accounts and got me
down to one bank account with perfect

798
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:43,280
credit Shang.

799
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:46,130
You cannot take money
on your shopping cart

800
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,230
and for store.com for your products,

801
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,771
t shirts,

802
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:49,041
books,

803
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:49,670
whatever.

804
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,031
You,

805
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:52,940
you aren't allowed to be in commerce
because you are a terrorist.

806
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:56,450
And what do they use
to define terrorist h?

807
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,620
It's classified symbols and we've
got some of the documents is hate,

808
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,581
h is hate.

809
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:05,870
And then just decide arbitrarily
that you're a hateful person,

810
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:06,740
that you promote hate.

811
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:07,880
No judge,

812
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,511
no jury.

813
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:10,190
It's the global Chinese social score.

814
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,750
That's what they're all testing for here.

815
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,950
But this is what we were talking about.

816
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,790
That's very important.

817
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,290
This is actually dangerous.

818
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,040
This is actually dangerous to give people
the ability to define people without

819
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,050
any strict rigid qualifications,

820
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:23,110
without anything that you
can point to on paper.

821
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:25,370
If I was a convicted murderer
and got out of prison,

822
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,530
I started an online
store and sell t shirts.

823
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,390
If I was Charlie Manson,

824
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:31,310
he had like four TV specials on,

825
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:31,581
on,

826
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:32,110
on,

827
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,540
you know,

828
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,080
uh,

829
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,420
CBS 60 minutes when I was a kid,

830
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:36,350
I'd watch Charlie Manson.

831
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,940
I don't think he was allowed
to get paid for those though.

832
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,610
I think that was part of the
thing because he's involved in,

833
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,660
we'll sure they have laws on it,

834
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:43,190
but the point is he would
do Geraldo Rivera shows.

835
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,300
The point is Hitler basically it was the
number one thing on the history channel

836
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:48,134
when they first launched it.

837
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,800
So you can hear what Hitler has to say
even though we know he's a bad guy.

838
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,041
Well,

839
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:56,090
why can't you wrote Alex challenge has
to say because they have found what I

840
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:57,020
talk about as effective.

841
00:24:57,021 --> 00:25:00,050
It gets people thinking and they
want it shut down because we've,

842
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,610
we've relaunched populism,

843
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,330
enforces,

844
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:02,721
done this,

845
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:07,721
my audience has 1776 worldwide populism,

846
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:08,900
anti globalism,

847
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:12,020
anti-communism anti China
and the big tech companies,

848
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:18,250
Google and apple and all of them have
publicly moved to China and they publicly

849
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:20,540
agreed to sensor and
control the population.

850
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,373
This isn't the nose.

851
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,130
And that's why Tim Cook got so mad at me
and I made a huge issue to Trump and I

852
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:26,270
shouldn't reports to the president.

853
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:28,050
I know he got that.

854
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,500
That's what happened on that Sunday
night when they said that's it.

855
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:31,370
We're done with Jones.

856
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:36,620
We have to take him down because I got
investigations going at the national

857
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:37,454
security level,

858
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,100
sending big reports,

859
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,120
the president through law firms of Reuters
and AP and then the articles which he

860
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:48,770
wasn't getting where China has
given of the code keys by Apple.

861
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,670
This is last year,

862
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,361
uh,

863
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:53,390
and is moving their database there and
all the code keys have been given to the

864
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:54,260
Chinese government.

865
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,680
And Apple says that's just part of being
there and Google's building dragon fly

866
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,770
project helps them to their entire
population with a social credit score.

867
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:03,140
They're already testing in Venezuela
with China and they're going to bring it

868
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:04,490
here and everything you do and live.

869
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,940
Tom will be controlled and you know
all the big airlines now hat or putting

870
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,450
cameras in that watch
you while you're on here.

871
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,300
Let me stop you because you
rent and again I'm frantic.

872
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,980
It's okay.

873
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,900
You think they're using sandy hook as
an excuse to get you off the air and to

874
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:20,750
censor you and to take away
your ability to make income.

875
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,950
Not because of that,

876
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,680
but using that as an excuse because
of the other things that you do.

877
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:24,921
Oh,

878
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:29,480
they like targeting things like Google
and talking about things that you're

879
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:29,931
talking about.

880
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:31,960
We were there in China
and China's allowed,

881
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:33,980
they're allowing China
to censor the population.

882
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,701
I'm just telling,

883
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:36,080
I'm not against Google or apple.

884
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:36,370
They're the,

885
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,610
they did a lot of cool things.

886
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,140
I'm saying stop it.

887
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,590
Congress told you 10 years ago you
were built here in the u s with Darpa.

888
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:42,900
Money,

889
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,250
don't go help

890
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,180
China do this stuff.

891
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:45,900
Don't be evil.

892
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,990
Well I only tell you something cause
I knew someone who worked at Google.

893
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:50,700
I know someone who used to work at Google,

894
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:51,390
I should say.

895
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,870
Their thought process
was that Google is going,

896
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,050
if they don't bring Google
to China in a sense it form,

897
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,400
they're going to copy Google.

898
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,353
This was there.

899
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,790
The real worry because
China copies everything.

900
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,050
I mean they're intellectual copyright law.

901
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,753
Better now.

902
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,650
True.

903
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,720
But this is what they're saying,

904
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,040
what they're about that job.

905
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,860
But let me,

906
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,390
let me explain something from the
point of view of Google as a business.

907
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,530
And I don't necessarily,

908
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:19,140
I'm not saying I agree with this
cause I don't itch more apple juice.

909
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,840
Get some apple juice
and your system fella.

910
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,073
Um,

911
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,400
they were thinking,

912
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,730
and this is what I was talking to a
woman who was a very high level executive

913
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:30,660
and she was saying that they're going
to steal it if we don't work with them.

914
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,630
They're just going to steal Google and,

915
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,890
and take the code and make
their own version of it.

916
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,840
So them as a business,

917
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:37,230
they're like,

918
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,160
this is inevitable.

919
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:38,911
They're going to do it anyway.

920
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:42,060
We're just going to give into
their censorship demands.

921
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,351
I don't agree with it.

922
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:44,161
I don't think it's a good idea,

923
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:45,750
but I don't know what I
would do if I was Google.

924
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:46,584
I'll tell them,

925
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,023
you'll tell what,

926
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,020
I'll talk a little tissue.

927
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,850
What should they do for China?

928
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You're dead on what that person told you
when I had the globalist 15 years ago,

929
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:56,791
20 years ago,

930
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,140
tried to buy me off to a million a year,

931
00:27:58,141 --> 00:27:58,351
you know,

932
00:27:58,351 --> 00:27:59,184
whatever.

933
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,940
Um,

934
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,271
by the way,

935
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:00,990
cheers.

936
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,261
Cheers,

937
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:01,920
brother.

938
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,730
Anyway,

939
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,870
when they did all that

940
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:06,511
well,

941
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:07,350
they did all that.

942
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,611
What were they trying to do?

943
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:09,444
Who's trying to lie?

944
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:09,790
Well,

945
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,750
I can't get into their private meetings
for the judge to journalistic stuff off

946
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:13,021
record,

947
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:13,830
but everybody gets

948
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,630
this is offers like Alex,

949
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:19,950
you're going to influence things by being
on the inside if you don't join this

950
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,800
and helps save the planet
and do all these big things.

951
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,260
My Dad got the same speech when
he was in high school already.

952
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,340
Ut had planned to.

953
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,660
I tell you about that.

954
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,523
We'll get to that later,

955
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,050
but if you don't join us,

956
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,940
then the bad guys that are in
the system are going to win.

957
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,460
That's how they call option cause that's
how those people you're talking to are

958
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:37,320
probably pretty good person.

959
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:38,154
That person at Google,

960
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,360
they've had hundreds of
their top engineers quit
over this because here's the

961
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:43,194
thing.

962
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,900
China in 1949 wash

963
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:53,110
nationalists and and capitalists
and our own CIA's been declassified,

964
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,120
left us the Ford Foundation that's was
above the CIA helped put the Chai comms

965
00:28:58,121 --> 00:28:58,954
and power.

966
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,420
It took them decades to get
running water and toilets.

967
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,370
They have no environmental standards,

968
00:29:03,371 --> 00:29:03,941
no rules.

969
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:05,230
They've had all of our investment.

970
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,040
They've been built up because
the Chinese economy's,

971
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,130
we'll do whatever the globalist wine,

972
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,800
when you go and you are in China,

973
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:16,210
they make you become state
run to get 0% tax corporate.

974
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:16,841
Okay.

975
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:18,760
That's what Trump's trying to
lower ours just to be competitive.

976
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,920
China has 0% corporate tax.

977
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:25,180
Look it up now if you become
state sponsored state run show,

978
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:25,780
they're claiming,

979
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,920
oh so the China doesn't
rape us of our technology.

980
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,060
We're going to go over there and spread
our legs to them even more so it's not a

981
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:34,391
rape.

982
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:36,640
We're willing and we're going
to take you along with us.

983
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:40,450
So the idea that well if
we don't give it to them,

984
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,800
they're just gonna it off.

985
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,611
So let us go,

986
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:46,270
really give them all the big secrets
and have Google last year until the

987
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:46,960
Pentagon,

988
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,400
we're not going to help you with Ai,

989
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:49,300
autonomous drones,

990
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,450
but Google gave them all the latest AI

991
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,980
and I'll get it more
sophisticated stuff in a moment.

992
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,980
Gave them all the sophisticated AI and
now China announces they've got all these

993
00:30:00,981 --> 00:30:04,420
AI drones that are autonomous and all
these AI weapons systems should erector

994
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,980
aircraft show show.

995
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:08,480
What I'm telling you
is China has no rules.

996
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,450
20 years ago they had cows
that produce human milk.

997
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,730
20 years ago they had
spiders that printers,

998
00:30:13,731 --> 00:30:15,290
body armor Shapot her guts.

999
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,040
Okay?

1000
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,720
They have human animal hybrids.

1001
00:30:17,721 --> 00:30:21,080
30 years ago they've got
giant human tissue farms.

1002
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,651
You know,

1003
00:30:21,651 --> 00:30:22,040
you hear,

1004
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,551
oh your,

1005
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:23,780
your achilles just torn.

1006
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,480
We've got a grown in a lab attended.

1007
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,490
It's not a fricking 10 and grow in a lab.

1008
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,410
It's a fricking deal.

1009
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,310
A humanoid.

1010
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,481
These aren't humans.

1011
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:34,400
The way they get around it is
they met him and we were winning.

1012
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,710
We we're saying so many things.

1013
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:37,041
This is,

1014
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:37,371
listen,

1015
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:38,204
I love you to death,

1016
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,100
but you say you stole a million dollars.

1017
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,933
Humanoids are real.

1018
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,833
I believe they are.

1019
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,690
But you say so many different
things without stopping.

1020
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,410
It's hard cause I'm an agency so
they'll listen to investigate.

1021
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,850
I'm decompartmentalize okay.

1022
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,930
But she'll be studied for years,

1023
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,750
so no,

1024
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,880
I believe Joe,

1025
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,091
Joe,

1026
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:55,280
Joe,

1027
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,710
Joe.

1028
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,543
Yes.

1029
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,050
Joe.

1030
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:01,910
It was an MIT quarterly 25 years ago
that they had human animal embryos.

1031
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:02,031
What?

1032
00:31:02,031 --> 00:31:03,410
They killed him at the embryonic level.

1033
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,343
You can leave it up.

1034
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,500
I believe they've got humanoids.

1035
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,080
I believe this.

1036
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,720
I've been there.

1037
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,810
They've already used CRISPR to enhance
children with a higher intelligence.

1038
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,340
And Shadow was actually,

1039
00:31:13,341 --> 00:31:14,420
it was a side effect.

1040
00:31:14,421 --> 00:31:16,100
They believe of intelligence.

1041
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,830
HIV was something about HIV immune to HIV.

1042
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:19,683
Oh yes.

1043
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,920
Everything that roll out
is already been tested.

1044
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,180
Oh,

1045
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,671
I believe you.

1046
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:23,570
But it has an aim.

1047
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,830
So let me tell you what's really going on.

1048
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,820
The globals want to play God.

1049
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:29,810
Okay.

1050
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,730
They have what they call
a breakaway civilization.

1051
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,241
What said was,

1052
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:35,120
how about the breakaway civilization
will talk about Sandy Hook,

1053
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,200
which I get and I appreciate it.

1054
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:36,980
Let me cover,

1055
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,060
and I'm sorry it ever happened.

1056
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:38,751
I believe that happened.

1057
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:39,860
I'm sorry for people's pain.

1058
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,120
And then I ask the
families and I asked the,

1059
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:43,280
the,

1060
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:43,881
the lawyers,

1061
00:31:43,881 --> 00:31:44,571
when I asked them all,

1062
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:47,180
stop in my name saying
I'm the wolf at the door.

1063
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:47,691
Shango,

1064
00:31:47,691 --> 00:31:50,870
go after these families and stopped
running around to the news everywhere

1065
00:31:50,871 --> 00:31:51,590
saying,

1066
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,430
Alex Jones says,

1067
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:54,320
Sandy Hook didn't happen
because the media,

1068
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:58,310
how about social media is
the most unpopular thing in
the world with 7% approval

1069
00:31:58,311 --> 00:31:59,144
rating and Gallup.

1070
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,230
So when they say that,

1071
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,670
I say it's fake.

1072
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,450
That sends people to Connecticut
because people think the media lies,

1073
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:05,731
right?

1074
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:06,441
So if they're saying,

1075
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:07,850
Alex Jones said didn't happen,

1076
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,080
it must have not happened.

1077
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:11,240
And now they're trying to
create a violent event.

1078
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,231
Not the families.

1079
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:16,010
But I think some of the people involved
know that if they make a big enough hype

1080
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:16,791
about it,

1081
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:18,650
they're going to have a big
event up there in Connecticut.

1082
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:19,280
You understand?

1083
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,210
And they're going to blame it on me.

1084
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,380
So I'm saying no,

1085
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:21,801
no,

1086
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:22,370
no.

1087
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,450
I believe it happened.

1088
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,500
Stop saying,

1089
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:27,680
I said it didn't happen and
stop shaking that I'm sharing.

1090
00:32:27,681 --> 00:32:32,630
No kids died because I want to talk
about human animal hybrids and humanoid

1091
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,440
because Joe,

1092
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,910
why is it gotta be a humanoid?

1093
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,583
Why?

1094
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,960
Because if you make it a few percentage,

1095
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,470
another uh,

1096
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,260
animal or another creature,

1097
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,420
it's a gray area.

1098
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,231
There's no human rights.

1099
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:46,520
You have an animal rights movement.

1100
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:47,750
You have a human rights movement.

1101
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:49,670
There's no alien movement.

1102
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,900
Aliens are real.

1103
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,590
They're creating human animal
hybrids that are a new creature.

1104
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:55,430
Never here on earth.

1105
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,570
It's alien.

1106
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,120
So the aliens are already here.

1107
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,560
Ai Is Alien.

1108
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,100
The kind of mirrors our alien
aliens are already here.

1109
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,550
So you're saying they're making these
human animal hybrid so they would harvest

1110
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:08,384
tissue from them.

1111
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,670
That's just level one.

1112
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,133
What's level two?

1113
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:12,950
What's level eight?

1114
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,700
Because a lot,

1115
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,190
I'll tell you a lot.

1116
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,280
For the best of my knowledge,

1117
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,930
a lot of people think,

1118
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,141
oh,

1119
00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:18,271
it's,

1120
00:33:18,271 --> 00:33:18,501
it's,

1121
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:22,490
it's human harvesting of fall on Gong
or these Buddhists really healthy.

1122
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,691
That's big.

1123
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:27,110
That's going on because they still
have a better non rejection rate.

1124
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,030
But with the risk,

1125
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:34,640
I remember 22 years ago reading a BB
she article that was kind of testing the

1126
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:36,740
waters occasionally tested and they go,

1127
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,340
oh yeah.

1128
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:37,641
Uh,

1129
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:38,960
about 15 years ago,

1130
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:42,650
the first animal human kind of errors
were made and tested if there were not

1131
00:33:42,651 --> 00:33:43,484
brought to term,

1132
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,910
but some scientists want to implant
them in utero and cows because I was,

1133
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:47,630
that's a bigger uterus.

1134
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,850
You can grow up a bigger
humanoid and get more tissue.

1135
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,460
And so then I went mapping
or go research that.

1136
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:53,870
So I went to ut library.

1137
00:33:53,871 --> 00:33:56,960
At that time you could get some of the
Internet in like 1996 and I wouldn't

1138
00:33:56,961 --> 00:33:59,090
actually pulled up all these MIT reports.

1139
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,910
I took him to my dad and other
people whose doctor and they go,

1140
00:34:01,911 --> 00:34:02,121
yeah,

1141
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:03,080
that's really crazy.

1142
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:08,410
And it was all about how we've got to
prepare the public for this because we're

1143
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:11,660
going to be able to download their
memories and then put it in a new body.

1144
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:12,740
This was before blade runner.

1145
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:13,560
So she,

1146
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,190
it's not like this is the world's
on imitating blade runner.

1147
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,300
Blade runner is a preparation for what's
coming and they're telling you more

1148
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:21,111
human than human.

1149
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:22,340
This is going to be more advanced.

1150
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,480
This is going to be better.

1151
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,620
But like everything,

1152
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:26,750
like a cell phone or like a vaccine,

1153
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:27,800
it's got a Trojan horse,

1154
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,910
it's got a back door.

1155
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,050
It's already been tested.

1156
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,310
It's already been perfected.

1157
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,240
It's being rolled out.

1158
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:33,500
You're not giving the real technology,

1159
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,940
you're not giving the real life extension.

1160
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:40,030
You're given the crap Jo and the earth
is seen as like an egg yolk to give the

1161
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:42,860
propulsion power for this new
thing that's going to be born.

1162
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,420
And whether you believe that or not,

1163
00:34:44,421 --> 00:34:45,560
just like when the new thing,

1164
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:46,970
meaning artificial intelligence.

1165
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:47,810
Beyond that,

1166
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,680
it's a origin of artificial intelligence
and a whole synthesis of new life

1167
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:52,514
forms.

1168
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,400
And so that's the big giant race.

1169
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:56,630
When Elon Musk came in and told you,

1170
00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:57,081
cause he goes,

1171
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:58,700
he's building and our functions
and he has a conscience.

1172
00:34:58,701 --> 00:35:00,140
So he's freaked out and they go,

1173
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:01,070
these billionaire functions,

1174
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:01,940
I don't just know this,

1175
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:05,570
I've talked to people and I was in
wired magazine 20 something years ago.

1176
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,010
While the future doesn't need as bill joy,

1177
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,290
a billionaire co owner,

1178
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:09,124
Sun microsystems,

1179
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,910
he goes to a billionaire meeting with
200 guys and the consensus was we're not

1180
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,830
gonna have people play video
games and party all day.

1181
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:17,180
We're going to set up a world government.

1182
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,910
We're going to slowly titrate
the dose and poison the public,

1183
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,043
dumb them down,

1184
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,750
put electromagnetic radiation
out with five g the scrambles,

1185
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:25,430
their DNA lowers or Iq.

1186
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,010
We're going to cause mass mental illness
and a controlled societal collapse that

1187
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:34,011
will then be organized and controlled in
the mop up crew by robots controlled by

1188
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:38,190
the globalist programmers
who believe with the Offworld

1189
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,001
entities.

1190
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:40,470
They're in communication with that.

1191
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,580
They're going to be given the operation
to upload and be in that larger kind of

1192
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:46,020
Borg Cube System.

1193
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,820
If they sell the country up.

1194
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,260
You got to hit the brakes because
I need to do we take this back to,

1195
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,510
I'm so baffled.

1196
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,000
What's mad at one of these things?

1197
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,660
Mit,

1198
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,660
Mit Technology Review estimates that
about 20 pregnancies of pig human or sheep

1199
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:03,300
human [inaudible] have been established
during the last 12 months in the u s

1200
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,630
total white in 2016 I
hundred percent believe it.

1201
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:07,200
Look,

1202
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,810
I think that as this was going on in 1985,

1203
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,960
I'm sure they tried to recruit
my dad to a Darpa program.

1204
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,180
I believe that in college and
then when he was a dentist,

1205
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,240
I believe that I believe that they will
take all sorts of liberties in gray

1206
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:22,740
matters when it comes
to scientific research.

1207
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,320
I definitely believe that you
ever see trinity and beyond.

1208
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,930
But let's,

1209
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,140
let's start slow because you didn't go
over so many different things in bombs

1210
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:32,790
trying to ignite the atmosphere.

1211
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,970
And then I came sexting.

1212
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:34,381
Oh No.

1213
00:36:34,381 --> 00:36:38,310
I know that the US air force tried
to destroy the atmosphere in 1968.

1214
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,323
Yes.

1215
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:39,870
Uh,

1216
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,400
operation starfish prime,

1217
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,320
they actually text you get a nuclear bomb.

1218
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,770
They adopted to detonate a
nuclear bomb in the upper.

1219
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,920
I'm trying to blow up the
rant on radiation and yes,

1220
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:49,270
they've,

1221
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,030
they've done a lot of goofy shit.

1222
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:51,121
See.

1223
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:51,570
That's the thing.

1224
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,530
That's why I got mad at you and I,

1225
00:36:52,531 --> 00:36:53,041
and I love you.

1226
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,940
You're a smart guy and everything is no,

1227
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:55,500
listen,

1228
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,333
you got mad at me.

1229
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,021
All this stuff.

1230
00:36:58,021 --> 00:37:01,440
I know you're even better at saying it
and then you sit there because you can't

1231
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:02,590
handle it and you shit.

1232
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,860
It's not going to go down to it.

1233
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:04,920
It's not that I can't handle it.

1234
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,030
It's there's two factors.

1235
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:06,331
One,

1236
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:07,440
I don't have any time.

1237
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,870
I don't have enough time to
go into it as much as you do.

1238
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,400
You asked why I flipped
out and got mad at you.

1239
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,510
That's it right there.

1240
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,021
You,

1241
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:14,760
every time I bring up a fucking subject,

1242
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:16,170
you know all about it.

1243
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,290
I don't know all about this
fucking know all about six shit.

1244
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:20,640
Don't know all that little shit.

1245
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:21,474
You're a smart guy,

1246
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,231
Joe.

1247
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:25,570
Joe,

1248
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,390
this is a Po Bullshit.

1249
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,890
You know exactly what you're,

1250
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,970
I don't think you're a bad guy.

1251
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,340
You're trying to survive for
you and your family and do good,

1252
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:32,620
okay,

1253
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,530
but none of your family,

1254
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:35,760
none of us are going to make it.

1255
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:38,130
There's a post human error coming.

1256
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,600
The breakaway civilization,

1257
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:40,680
the deal's been made.

1258
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:41,700
It's not,

1259
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,870
it's not the third dementia.

1260
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:45,850
They've made fricking deals
with interdimensional aliens.

1261
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,733
Okay,

1262
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,590
and notice the media never disaster
for that cause that's the truth.

1263
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,430
Maybe this is true.

1264
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,620
I do not know this and we'll get into it.

1265
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:52,951
Okay?

1266
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:53,790
I do not know this.

1267
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:55,890
And even these human pig hybrids,

1268
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,090
Jamie just pulled this up.

1269
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:57,921
I believe it's true.

1270
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:58,140
I mean,

1271
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,650
I worried about my marriage.

1272
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,990
I'm sorry.

1273
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:02,250
The Sandy Hook kids died.

1274
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,470
My identity is not that I get it.

1275
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,730
They admit five g and all the studies
La Times causes mashed up mutation and

1276
00:38:08,731 --> 00:38:09,270
cancer.

1277
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:09,661
Wait a minute.

1278
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:09,781
Wait.

1279
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:11,640
And it really rattles your DNA apart.

1280
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,380
All of our kids are under attack.

1281
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,140
You mean five manager for
allowing five g to come in?

1282
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,220
This is the new Internet.

1283
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:21,090
You know why they won't let China
put in Wapo you know whopper major.

1284
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,400
That's the big Chinese are on fire today.

1285
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,270
No.

1286
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:24,730
Gee,

1287
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,470
you're on fire.

1288
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,303
No joke.

1289
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,641
Joe.

1290
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:28,650
The five g you're on fire.

1291
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,130
Okay.

1292
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:29,830
Okay.

1293
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:34,170
Maybe she article and 96 about human
animal hybrids with pigs and cows.

1294
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:34,930
Yes.

1295
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,100
If got to make you park cows

1296
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,933
and the cow keeps you,

1297
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,310
does it reject it or Partpic.

1298
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,010
Okay,

1299
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,141
okay.

1300
00:38:39,141 --> 00:38:42,340
But let me expand and you know about pigs
and rats were most closely related to

1301
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:42,391
us,

1302
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:43,224
not even chimpanzees.

1303
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,800
That's why a lot of the
organs don't get rejected.

1304
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,033
You know about that?

1305
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:46,840
Yes.

1306
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,021
Okay.

1307
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:47,700
Yes.

1308
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,540
Pigs are very close to humans.

1309
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,680
Even use pig organs and peaceful.

1310
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,510
He's usually know everything show.

1311
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,790
No,

1312
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,330
it's true.

1313
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:55,481
I mean,

1314
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:56,080
you know,

1315
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,010
in a general knowledge,

1316
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:57,760
you know everything I know.

1317
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:57,970
No,

1318
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,181
no,

1319
00:38:58,181 --> 00:38:58,391
no.

1320
00:38:58,391 --> 00:38:59,050
I don't.

1321
00:38:59,050 --> 00:38:59,470
Listen,

1322
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,303
let me tell you,

1323
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,571
this is literally,

1324
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:02,170
I,

1325
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:02,560
we,

1326
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,430
we know what they're doing.

1327
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,511
She'll just like,

1328
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:05,344
they say,

1329
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,580
just like they say,

1330
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,141
Oh yeah,

1331
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:09,550
we had human animal hybrid.

1332
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,190
This is like fricking 39 years ago now,

1333
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,540
23 years ago.

1334
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,850
I'm reading at the BBC about
it and go confirm attack.

1335
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:16,690
Okay.

1336
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,523
And they're just floating.

1337
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:22,140
There was an article in 1999
in the Baltimore Sun and
I interviewed Nick Becca.

1338
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,490
She read a Dick Mega Chen and Dr
Beckett should know Gotti blow you away.

1339
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:24,931
Who is it?

1340
00:39:24,931 --> 00:39:26,530
His Dad was a US congressman.

1341
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,011
I got killed.

1342
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:27,341
His brother,

1343
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:28,174
US senator,

1344
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,661
he,

1345
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:29,021
he like,

1346
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:29,900
he should have him on the ship.

1347
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,280
They're the guys that got all the money
given to native Americans and he spells

1348
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,123
his last name,

1349
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:33,790
begged shits.

1350
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:33,961
It's,

1351
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:34,230
it's,

1352
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,610
it's a,

1353
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,443
he's a good friend of mine.

1354
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,690
Can I get him on apps?

1355
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:37,810
A fricking lil fly right now.

1356
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,411
Anyways,

1357
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:39,244
the point is,

1358
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,210
so what does he do?

1359
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,890
He was telling me all these years ago,

1360
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:42,221
he goes,

1361
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:43,054
Alex,

1362
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,040
it isn't chemicals in the food and water.

1363
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:47,530
That's childless baggage checked.

1364
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,240
It's Jimmy.

1365
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,440
It's electro chemical.

1366
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,030
Okay,

1367
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,940
it's electro chemical.

1368
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,340
But I'm reading in the Baltimore Sun
after I just had him on and thought it was

1369
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:57,671
crazy.

1370
00:39:57,671 --> 00:40:00,850
He's giving all these patents for mind
control using wavelengths and microwaves.

1371
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,140
And I'm sitting there looking at
it and I'm reading it and I'm,

1372
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,940
and I'm seeing it and the Baltimore Sun
says the CIA is testing on cell towers,

1373
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,770
uh,

1374
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,540
wave links to calm the
public during crises.

1375
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,790
I just had baggage,

1376
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,630
Sean with patents talking about that.

1377
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:17,100
Well,

1378
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,130
Beckett's explains his,

1379
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,260
it's not that the microwave.

1380
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,480
I have somehow interfaced with the brain.

1381
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,440
We already interfaced with the space
winds and all these other magnetic fields

1382
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,880
and everything else show.

1383
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:29,740
They're all just testing this stuff.

1384
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,150
And so everything they deployed,

1385
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:32,380
they've got all these other technologies.

1386
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,020
My Dad was at ut and 65
when he was in high school,

1387
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,250
they already had CD roms,

1388
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:37,084
computers,

1389
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:37,841
everything.

1390
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:39,770
But they had a nuclear reactor
underneath the building.

1391
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:40,750
And what spoke to tell them?

1392
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,443
Oh absolutely.

1393
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,361
And that's what I'm telling you.

1394
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:44,710
It's a breakaway civilization,

1395
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:44,921
dude.

1396
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:46,030
We don't know what they've got.

1397
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,081
We don't know.

1398
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:47,800
We don't know who they are.

1399
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,633
We don't know the whole thing.

1400
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,340
That's what I'm telling you is
this is hiding in plain view.

1401
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,570
And that's why it's so crazy.

1402
00:40:52,571 --> 00:40:53,710
Imagine if you knew all this.

1403
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,720
You're trying to tell people and they go,

1404
00:40:55,721 --> 00:40:56,141
Oh God,

1405
00:40:56,141 --> 00:40:56,741
he's doing that.

1406
00:40:56,741 --> 00:40:57,431
Find one thing.

1407
00:40:57,431 --> 00:40:59,740
He did it sounds mean and
make that his whole world.

1408
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:04,270
So that's what I'm telling you is it's
been in the newspaper that the cell

1409
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:05,980
towers are being used for mind control.

1410
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,630
That sounds like a schizophrenia.

1411
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,290
So see,

1412
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:08,561
here's a,

1413
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:09,120
here's where it gets tougher.

1414
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,941
I want to see that.

1415
00:41:09,941 --> 00:41:11,110
How do they use the salad tongs?

1416
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,350
Pull.

1417
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:11,860
I'd probably look,

1418
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,341
here's the thing.

1419
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:13,174
Skits.

1420
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,511
Listen,

1421
00:41:13,511 --> 00:41:14,590
here's the deal right here.

1422
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,100
You've got a total schizophrenia that
thinks the sun is following him around

1423
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:21,370
town and thinks their dog is watching
them and works for the aliens.

1424
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,413
That's not happening.

1425
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,700
You've got someone over here,

1426
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,940
someone over here that believes
everything they see on Fox News.

1427
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,540
Yes.

1428
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,080
Okay.

1429
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,500
Yes.

1430
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,490
Now questionings.

1431
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:31,600
Good science is good.

1432
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:34,100
Trying to figure out what's
real and all of us get freaked

1433
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,320
out.

1434
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,061
The nature of the world.

1435
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:36,350
No one knows what the university has.

1436
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,460
We don't have all the answers.

1437
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,391
So it kind of,

1438
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:40,370
people can't handle that bigness.

1439
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,470
They can't handle that question.

1440
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:43,460
I'll especially low Iq.

1441
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:49,100
So they have to differentiate and create
a model that allows them to put it in

1442
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:52,040
boxes so they can make it make
sense because they can't handle it.

1443
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:52,240
It's like,

1444
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:52,840
uh,

1445
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,391
like I say,

1446
00:41:53,391 --> 00:41:56,630
even top astronauts space walk for
the first time and they're out in the

1447
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:58,880
universe and the whole planet's under him.

1448
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,150
And what are they going to do?

1449
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:00,340
They,

1450
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:00,740
it's,

1451
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,700
it's mind blowing.

1452
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:01,971
Well.

1453
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:05,810
Imagine once you realize we don't know
everything we don't understand and it's

1454
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,850
endless and there's all this crazy crap,

1455
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:08,930
people go nuts.

1456
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,730
And as humans learn more and more,

1457
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,190
as we become more advanced
and go to this metamorphosis,

1458
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,880
it's going to create a giant societal
crisis where most of the people already

1459
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:17,714
going to get killed.

1460
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,230
The globalist understand that
in the birth of this planet,

1461
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,093
this new species,

1462
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,110
and so they decided to take control,

1463
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:24,980
make it scientific,

1464
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:29,060
stun everyone and Dunham Noun so they
can scientifically try to orderly carry

1465
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:29,894
this operation now,

1466
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:30,561
but then I go,

1467
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:31,160
wait a minute,

1468
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,140
you're detonate and over
a hundred a in bonds,

1469
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,140
the upper atmosphere to see if you could
ignite the atmosphere destroying the

1470
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:36,740
earth.

1471
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:36,921
Yeah,

1472
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,990
but that was in the sixties I know,

1473
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:41,780
but what I'm telling you is the
same professors train people,

1474
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,550
but those people are dead.

1475
00:42:43,551 --> 00:42:47,790
The people that detonated those hydrogen
bombs in the 60s they are dead now does

1476
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,021
not.

1477
00:42:48,021 --> 00:42:49,430
We're not dealing with
the same human beings.

1478
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:50,571
I'm with you.

1479
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:51,770
I think people in a lot of ways,

1480
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:54,950
they're more immoral now
I think I agree with you.

1481
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:57,650
In some ways that everything
evolves and things get better.

1482
00:42:57,651 --> 00:43:01,070
This is one of my arguments
about operation Northwoods
that if they were able to

1483
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,450
push operation Northwoods
and get it signed by the
Joint Chiefs of staff in 1962

1484
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,480
was it 62 if they were able to do that
and no one went to jail and no one got

1485
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:14,240
arrested for proposing that they were
going to arm Cuban friendlies and have

1486
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:18,740
them bomb Guantanamo Bay and blow up a
Cuban jet liner and and shoot people in

1487
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:19,250
movie theaters.

1488
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:19,730
Yes,

1489
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,330
and schools,

1490
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:20,840
yes.

1491
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,580
That things evolve.

1492
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,100
Things evolve and if unchecked,

1493
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,570
and obviously that was unchecked,

1494
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,880
no one went to jail for that.

1495
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,733
No one got hit you,

1496
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:29,240
you know,

1497
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,530
even PBS covered it.

1498
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:31,580
Like I never even knew this.

1499
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:32,930
Let's read this right here.

1500
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,040
The significance of the research he
explained is that although the cell phone

1501
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,150
power is low,

1502
00:43:38,151 --> 00:43:42,770
electromagnetic radiation can nevertheless
have an effect on mental behavior

1503
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,230
when transmitting at the proper frequency.

1504
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:48,740
What does this article Jamie Scientific
American in scientific American at the

1505
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:50,610
title mind control by cell phone.

1506
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,520
So it really does have an effect.

1507
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:53,320
They did a whole study.

1508
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,100
Let's go further.

1509
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,933
It does.

1510
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,053
So there is,

1511
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:00,020
so what do you think that they're
making this not classified.

1512
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:00,854
Last year,

1513
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,780
a 37 page,

1514
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:07,490
she IAA manual from the 1970s where they
were putting up shell towers that look

1515
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:09,410
like trees already testing it.

1516
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:10,040
Neighborhoods.

1517
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,120
Okay the judge,

1518
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:12,831
can I shut my phone?

1519
00:44:12,831 --> 00:44:16,360
Tracks you and watches you and
controls you and surveil shoe.

1520
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,553
You think

1521
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,660
that it's one way.

1522
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:26,230
But beyond that it's a microwave relay
relay system that can manipulate and then

1523
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:27,620
the towers are even more powerful.

1524
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:31,010
So this is a device
given to us by the gods.

1525
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,070
Okay.

1526
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:36,990
Given to us by the technology that
that the breakaway government,

1527
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,280
NASA has developed that you don't
just think they made up themselves.

1528
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:42,114
Right?

1529
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:42,661
What do you mean?

1530
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:43,590
Who Do you think made it up?

1531
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:44,461
Well,

1532
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:45,450
when you're ready to get to it,

1533
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,760
I don't want listeners
to understand something.

1534
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,270
I'm noticing.

1535
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,960
Notice the media is not
going to cover this.

1536
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,420
The media is not what they'll
cover that was on the show.

1537
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:53,190
They're not going to cover this.

1538
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:54,010
The meat.

1539
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:54,261
Okay.

1540
00:44:54,261 --> 00:44:55,350
Cause this is not my opinion.

1541
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,430
This is the real research
that I have heard that,

1542
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,590
that I have talked to army generals,

1543
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,030
commanding generals,

1544
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,320
major generals,

1545
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:05,370
general generals,

1546
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,330
CIA,

1547
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:06,841
everybody,

1548
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:08,700
and they're all 100%.

1549
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:09,650
Uh,

1550
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,070
and I thought it was a sigh out
before and that I've researched it.

1551
00:45:12,071 --> 00:45:13,950
I've talked to hundreds of people now,

1552
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:14,963
not on air,

1553
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,780
but I'm gonna make a film on this
who've taken Iowasca and DMT.

1554
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:19,710
I've not taken it.

1555
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,800
And B for obvious reasons.

1556
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,420
And uh,

1557
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:31,080
and it's unbelievable because I mean
they 100% in San Francisco is the main

1558
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:36,081
project site literally have an alien
base and they are literally communicating

1559
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,370
and they'd got like astronauts level
people taking super hardcore levels of

1560
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:45,450
drugs and going into meetings with these
things and making intergalactic deals

1561
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:46,251
and that,

1562
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:47,040
and again,

1563
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,300
that's what the government believes.

1564
00:45:48,301 --> 00:45:49,520
It says they're doing this.

1565
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,800
When you say the government,

1566
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:51,970
that's a broad stroke.

1567
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,100
You're painting,

1568
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,800
you're using a broad brush.

1569
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:56,020
Like what do you mean by the Geico?

1570
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:58,450
A rogue intelligence agents,

1571
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:02,740
we you're saying is essentially that the
using psychedelic drugs to communicate

1572
00:46:02,741 --> 00:46:04,110
with interdimensional beings.

1573
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,200
All right,

1574
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:05,980
that's spirit guides.

1575
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,490
Okay.

1576
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:07,570
Everyone.

1577
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,310
Everyone who's done a high dose of
psychedelic drugs has had this experience.

1578
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:17,730
So everyone is listening to you right
now who's done DMT or done five grams of

1579
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:19,174
psilocybin.

1580
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,570
They know that this is a,

1581
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,400
you have some kind of
communication with something else.

1582
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:25,360
The question is,

1583
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:28,960
is that something else inside your
psyche or is that something else?

1584
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:29,721
A chemical,

1585
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:30,570
her doorway,

1586
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:35,470
is there a chemical doorway inside the
mind that opens up in the belief is that

1587
00:46:35,471 --> 00:46:36,340
when you die,

1588
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,160
and this is the what the
afterlife is that when you die,

1589
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:40,480
your brain reduce,

1590
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,610
produces these chemicals,

1591
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,390
these chemicals open up this doorway
and this is the portal to the next

1592
00:46:46,391 --> 00:46:47,224
dimension.

1593
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,370
So you're saying,

1594
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,150
you're saying that the government is
aware of this and they must be aware of

1595
00:46:52,151 --> 00:46:52,311
this.

1596
00:46:52,311 --> 00:46:53,650
They've heard enough people talk about it.

1597
00:46:53,651 --> 00:46:54,960
They must have done experiments on it.

1598
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,813
What does it say?

1599
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:56,783
The Poconos.

1600
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,120
The universe for sure.

1601
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:58,401
And,

1602
00:46:58,401 --> 00:47:02,380
and people that have the courage to
experiment with these things and try them

1603
00:47:02,381 --> 00:47:06,160
themselves realize that this is such
a profound experience that it is.

1604
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:11,520
It's so alien that if an alien landed
right now in our parking lot and a little

1605
00:47:11,771 --> 00:47:13,450
gray man with big black eyes got out,

1606
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:17,350
it would be nothing compared to
what I've seen on psychedelic trips.

1607
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,473
Just tell Ya,

1608
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,690
me getting under this show
is just because she'll,

1609
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:26,520
people need to understand that I've known
about this for a long time and I just

1610
00:47:26,521 --> 00:47:27,780
don't think people are ready for it.

1611
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,980
But a lot of folks

1612
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,421
who,

1613
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:32,254
uh,

1614
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,790
have low oxygen and,

1615
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,331
and how,

1616
00:47:35,331 --> 00:47:37,660
who and I hope brains well,

1617
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:38,494
well who have,

1618
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:39,530
you know,

1619
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:40,430
sleep apnea.

1620
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:40,760
I big,

1621
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,301
big MACs,

1622
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:42,134
pick hedge tongues,

1623
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,100
go back like you and me.

1624
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,050
You got down to 62% oxygen.

1625
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:49,250
That's another time that
the brain releases DMT show.

1626
00:47:49,251 --> 00:47:54,251
My whole life since I was about my first
memories were every night was a DMT

1627
00:47:55,701 --> 00:47:57,110
trip show.

1628
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:58,430
I basically,

1629
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,750
I don't want this to sound arrogant.

1630
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:02,170
It's not,

1631
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,340
I've seen everything.

1632
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:03,911
Well,

1633
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:06,190
I believe that when you are dreaming,

1634
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,280
it's most likely the same
chemicals that are being released.

1635
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:09,741
Well,

1636
00:48:09,741 --> 00:48:11,470
a key point when you
go into the room sleep,

1637
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,340
it opens the gate.

1638
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,600
Which side is a proven,

1639
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:15,850
your brain is working in the fourth,

1640
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,061
fifth,

1641
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:16,894
sixth dimension.

1642
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,460
And if you can work into those dimensions,

1643
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:19,181
you can see beyond it.

1644
00:48:19,181 --> 00:48:20,260
So it's when I'm trying
to tell you is this,

1645
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,260
I know you already know all
this show for your audience.

1646
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,753
Here's what's happening.

1647
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:28,400
I'm not saying you're bad.

1648
00:48:28,401 --> 00:48:29,660
I never said you were in the CIA.

1649
00:48:29,661 --> 00:48:33,560
I say the CIA is on record with
Timothy leary and everybody promoting

1650
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:35,240
hallucinogens in the 60s.

1651
00:48:35,241 --> 00:48:37,790
They admitted that it
was a plan to try to,

1652
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:38,500
uh,

1653
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,520
would it would do in the public
to make them more suggestible,

1654
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,620
but there's a larger program and then
they kind of backed off because it Kinda

1655
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:46,490
got out of control.

1656
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:47,310
It actually created some,

1657
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:47,650
some,

1658
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:48,860
some people that were
actually fighting him,

1659
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:49,221
so,

1660
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:50,540
so it didn't have the effect they want it.

1661
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:54,680
So then they moved on the Iowasca
and the DMT that they promoted,

1662
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,030
which good strong people that have
a compass go and have problems with,

1663
00:48:59,031 --> 00:48:59,930
but weak minded,

1664
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,430
stupid people and others.

1665
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,660
Here's an example.

1666
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,493
This guy is smart.

1667
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:03,860
Uh,

1668
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,140
Eric Mann,

1669
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,113
cal Mahler,

1670
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,761
syndicated radio host.

1671
00:49:07,761 --> 00:49:08,780
I don't even like 15 years.

1672
00:49:08,781 --> 00:49:09,614
You just lost me.

1673
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:10,251
Well,

1674
00:49:10,251 --> 00:49:11,510
I'm going to tell you the story you said.

1675
00:49:11,511 --> 00:49:12,344
He's smart.

1676
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,660
He's a nice guy and I'm just kidding.

1677
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,400
He's a smart guy.

1678
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,650
He may have been on his
show before the election.

1679
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,593
I like him.

1680
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:18,771
He will.

1681
00:49:18,771 --> 00:49:19,604
Everybody's,

1682
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,050
everybody's on this quest

1683
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:23,361
and I told you,

1684
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:25,370
I've talked to like a hundred
people I've talked to more.

1685
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,620
It was a lot of people
are going to do in these,

1686
00:49:27,621 --> 00:49:28,590
the DMT in Iowa,

1687
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:29,630
Ska trips outside Austin.

1688
00:49:29,631 --> 00:49:30,470
They're doing them all over the place.

1689
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,310
Yes,

1690
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:32,143
and

1691
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:35,850
I'm on his show and he's told me the same
story everybody tells you about being

1692
00:49:35,851 --> 00:49:36,750
in Peru or being,

1693
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,230
you know,

1694
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:38,063
Costa Rica.

1695
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:41,280
He went to two trips
down there and he said,

1696
00:49:41,281 --> 00:49:42,114
yeah,

1697
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,460
we're sitting there and we
take the Iowasca and then
all these basically elves,

1698
00:49:47,461 --> 00:49:50,640
aliens come out of the woods and
we're all seeing the same aliens.

1699
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:55,050
We're all hearing the same thing
and it's like 43 of us or whatever,

1700
00:49:55,051 --> 00:49:55,651
seeing and he goes,

1701
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:58,080
but it was the drugs effect on our brains.

1702
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:58,561
No,

1703
00:49:58,561 --> 00:49:58,621
no,

1704
00:49:58,621 --> 00:49:58,770
no.

1705
00:49:58,770 --> 00:49:59,371
A drug.

1706
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,660
Everyone sees something different.

1707
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:05,900
When you open a gate and
now interdimensionally your
brain's already filtering

1708
00:50:05,911 --> 00:50:07,860
out most stuff because
you can't handle it.

1709
00:50:07,861 --> 00:50:11,070
Your eyes are already seeing can I got
a cat when it's like seeing something in

1710
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,700
or a dog.

1711
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,040
Well you know when they first identified,

1712
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,000
um,

1713
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,960
there's certain,

1714
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:21,290
there's certain components to Iowa Osca
and one of them is harming and when they

1715
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:23,310
first identified it,

1716
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,920
they tried to call it telepathy.

1717
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:25,500
Yes.

1718
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,270
The reason why they call it telepathy and
when they were taking Iowasca later in

1719
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:31,670
these group experiences
that were undeniable,

1720
00:50:31,671 --> 00:50:32,240
they were,

1721
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,420
they were experiencing like
very vividly the same things.

1722
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:39,230
And so the government's obviously obsessed
with this and isn't worried about,

1723
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,250
but here's the problem,

1724
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,020
here's the problem that that term,

1725
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,000
the government,

1726
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,450
are you talking about the post office
police officer's down is pretty,

1727
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,260
you're talking about the fire department
ruling tronic who are these people?

1728
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:51,590
But yeah,

1729
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,170
I think the government is a shitty turn.

1730
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:53,960
I know who they are.

1731
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,201
Okay.

1732
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:55,190
But that that term,

1733
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,200
the problem with that term
is it lumps you into like,

1734
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,190
you know that Mel Gibson movie conspiracy
theory was a wacky dude was driving a

1735
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:01,521
cab.

1736
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:04,040
I believed in fucking
tin foil hat type shows.

1737
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:04,874
He'd been tortured.

1738
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,570
Yes,

1739
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,051
exactly.

1740
00:51:06,051 --> 00:51:06,830
We compartmentalize.

1741
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:07,663
Yes but,

1742
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,080
but that kind of stuff,

1743
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:10,640
when you say the government is doing it,

1744
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:12,020
like who is doing this?

1745
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,910
Who's working on these experience?

1746
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,310
We don't have to say names.

1747
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:16,490
No,

1748
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:16,970
no.

1749
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:17,803
Here's the thing.

1750
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,140
Obviously maybe you
want to say the gutter.

1751
00:51:20,141 --> 00:51:20,291
No,

1752
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:21,710
I'll tell you it's a broad brush.

1753
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:22,340
I know you're right.

1754
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,430
It's dumb to say the government and
the big question is who runs things?

1755
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:26,260
So that's a smart question.

1756
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,470
That's the thing is they,

1757
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,870
when everybody says they
don't want you to know,

1758
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,200
do you remember that fucking guy who
is ripping people off like weight loss

1759
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:36,170
secrets that they don't want you to know
Kevin Trudeau and they put them in jail

1760
00:51:36,171 --> 00:51:36,950
for that.

1761
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,680
He's in jail right now cause he won't
give up the money cause he's got a pile of

1762
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:40,461
cash somewhere.

1763
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:41,860
And he said he would do they would they,

1764
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:44,660
I think they said they would
give them is a con man.

1765
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:45,620
I've met him a few times.

1766
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,920
Very manipulative but I think he has a
right to Shay healthcare cures or natural

1767
00:51:51,201 --> 00:51:51,470
periods.

1768
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:52,303
I don't want you to know about,

1769
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,300
there are some,

1770
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:53,850
there are some,

1771
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,340
but the point is they don't,

1772
00:51:55,341 --> 00:51:55,551
look,

1773
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:55,810
I,

1774
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,640
I have some love in my heart for
Kevin Trudeau because he started the

1775
00:51:58,641 --> 00:51:59,630
international pool tour.

1776
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:00,410
It was a,

1777
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:01,970
he was putting a lot of
money into professional.

1778
00:52:01,971 --> 00:52:02,790
Cool.

1779
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:03,501
I mean here's the old,

1780
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:04,820
the Oxycontin company.

1781
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,990
The documents came out.

1782
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:06,591
Shit,

1783
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:09,800
we're going to totally a dick people and
then we're going to sell him drugs to

1784
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:10,490
get off of it.

1785
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:10,820
Yes.

1786
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,780
That's pure fricking either.

1787
00:52:11,781 --> 00:52:14,420
So lock your ass up and then
we'll get to Kevin Trudeau later.

1788
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:15,021
I agree with,

1789
00:52:15,021 --> 00:52:15,771
and I'm not even defending,

1790
00:52:15,771 --> 00:52:16,101
kept her though.

1791
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:17,360
Cause I met with every girl a few times.

1792
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,900
I know all about him and it was like
he was 100% about him and a one way

1793
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:21,734
frigging straight.

1794
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:22,131
Well,

1795
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:25,580
I didn't get that experience with them
with me and I him just talked about pool.

1796
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:29,210
I was doing some stuff with him when
he was first starting the pool tour.

1797
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:30,470
I came to a couple of his events,

1798
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,690
but he that day,

1799
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,260
this thing that like you always have a
good way of asking questions instead of

1800
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:37,071
saying who runs it.

1801
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:37,730
All right.

1802
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:40,150
You wait till I do the cliche the
government and you correct me.

1803
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,630
What I'm doing is playing devil's advocate
and I'm also looking at it from the

1804
00:52:44,631 --> 00:52:45,820
perspectives of people of hours.

1805
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:46,461
There's still Eddie's come,

1806
00:52:46,461 --> 00:52:47,540
let's do another hour and get out of here.

1807
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,500
Okay.

1808
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,510
Let's let Johnny No,

1809
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:50,651
no,

1810
00:52:50,651 --> 00:52:50,751
no,

1811
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:50,881
no,

1812
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:51,714
not yet.

1813
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,450
Do you want him to come
at two instead of one 30?

1814
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:53,690
Yeah,

1815
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:54,290
whenever you want.

1816
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:54,811
I'm going to text him.

1817
00:52:54,811 --> 00:52:54,921
Right.

1818
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:55,251
Anyways,

1819
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:55,700
let me,

1820
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,600
let me try to be clear.

1821
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:57,020
Joe,

1822
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,010
I'm having a good time with you.

1823
00:52:58,011 --> 00:52:59,150
I just want you to know
he's tried to be clear.

1824
00:52:59,151 --> 00:53:01,010
I can't say all of this on air.

1825
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:02,323
Okay.

1826
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:02,870
Okay.

1827
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,100
And I'm going to leave it at that.

1828
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:04,963
But,

1829
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:05,883
um,

1830
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:10,940
I'm on record 20 years ago before anybody
else was talking about the clockwork

1831
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:14,030
ELLs and other global listening to her
in touch with these entities and things

1832
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:15,650
only because,

1833
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,533
and I don't want to get,

1834
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:18,290
I'm not in the CIA,

1835
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,840
the CIA's bigger than Coca Cola.

1836
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:21,950
It's like better than Walmart.

1837
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:24,440
I'd never been an intelligence agency.

1838
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,220
I've been part of any of this stuff.

1839
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:32,450
But I had family that was in advanced
Darpa research projects that I don't know

1840
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:34,340
all the details about.

1841
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,540
And um,

1842
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:37,891
when I was a kid,

1843
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:39,000
my dad told me about some of it,

1844
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:40,470
not knowing how to be
a talk show host layer,

1845
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,050
but like when the deputy
director of the CIA,

1846
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:44,220
he did have a tooth pulled to,

1847
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,054
came to my dad.

1848
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:46,320
Okay.

1849
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,711
Show.

1850
00:53:46,711 --> 00:53:47,940
Then I was like the doctor to,

1851
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:48,181
you know,

1852
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:48,631
these guys.

1853
00:53:48,631 --> 00:53:50,860
And I remember sitting around the
kitchen table and I'm like 70.

1854
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:51,703
He's like,

1855
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:52,441
Carol,

1856
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:53,760
I can't tell you all about it,

1857
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:57,120
but it's a classified program in
Maryland and an underground base.

1858
00:53:57,121 --> 00:53:57,940
And,

1859
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,230
uh,

1860
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:59,370
they won't give me all the details,

1861
00:53:59,371 --> 00:54:01,710
but it's double the money I'm making
now and this international security.

1862
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:02,061
But I think,

1863
00:54:02,061 --> 00:54:03,120
I think it's basically,

1864
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:03,871
you know,

1865
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:04,470
we're going to,

1866
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:08,040
we're building cyborgs and we've got
special forces that have volunteered if we

1867
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:11,160
could infiltrate the Russians
and get to codes and systems in,

1868
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:12,270
I believe it's implanting,

1869
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,180
but messages in their teeth and I,

1870
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,600
and then I also think it's,

1871
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:16,260
I do implants,

1872
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,360
I think it's a brain surgery
program for microchips.

1873
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,430
And so I'm hearing am I,

1874
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:20,910
Carol was like,

1875
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:21,271
David,

1876
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:25,320
I'm sick of these people
and you've already done so
much for the government and

1877
00:54:25,321 --> 00:54:26,800
look what they've already
done to you and I,

1878
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:27,011
my,

1879
00:54:27,011 --> 00:54:27,844
my brother,

1880
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:28,710
you're not going to be,

1881
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,420
I want you out of this.

1882
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:31,501
So this is like,

1883
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:31,651
you know,

1884
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:31,951
seven,

1885
00:54:31,951 --> 00:54:33,120
eight years old and
like hearing about the,

1886
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,620
you're hearing about the cyborgs.

1887
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:35,910
Okay.

1888
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:36,390
Okay.

1889
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:37,020
So,

1890
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,650
so that's the kind of stuff that
I grew up seeing and you know,

1891
00:54:40,651 --> 00:54:40,891
oh,

1892
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:41,970
let's go get your uncle.

1893
00:54:41,971 --> 00:54:43,320
He's come off as [inaudible],

1894
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:43,771
you know,

1895
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:46,410
Army Day in an army
uniform from Guatemala.

1896
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,480
You know there's like armed
guys with machine guns.

1897
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:49,350
I mean I don't know.

1898
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:50,184
Okay.

1899
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,630
And I don't need to know.

1900
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,040
Okay.

1901
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,840
The point is is that's what I grew up.

1902
00:54:55,050 --> 00:55:00,050
You know the type of stuff I saw and my
dad never told me about all this stuff

1903
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,470
when I was older till it was like 12
years ago and I was finishing in and

1904
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:05,580
blueprint for global and enslavement.

1905
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,000
That's free still online and it's all
about the world government and now the

1906
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:10,390
cell phones watching you and everything's,

1907
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:11,263
everything's proven in it.

1908
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,241
It didn't come true.

1909
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:13,074
It was already true.

1910
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,270
And the plan for one world government
and don't have kids and all that and

1911
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:20,590
attack on the family and we were going
to go to a ballet recital for like my,

1912
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:21,420
you know,

1913
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,440
three year old daughter,

1914
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:27,270
she's like 14 now or whatever and they
sit out for like an hour and watch the

1915
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:30,330
end of the films three
our film and my mom goes,

1916
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:30,931
tape it.

1917
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:32,010
That's not true.

1918
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,661
He goes,

1919
00:55:33,661 --> 00:55:33,931
yes,

1920
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:34,770
it's all true.

1921
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:37,140
When I was in junior in high school,

1922
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:40,290
they recruited me into the program there
and they brought us in and he said the

1923
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:42,270
Nazis were wrong because they were
only targeting certain groups.

1924
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:45,390
We're going to talk to everybody and so
planetary breakaway and world government

1925
00:55:45,391 --> 00:55:46,560
and blah blah blah.

1926
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,840
There's a nuclear reactor under
ut and all this other stuff,

1927
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,250
which later when research
is actually true,

1928
00:55:50,251 --> 00:55:51,084
it's not even hidden.

1929
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:51,961
But the point is,

1930
00:55:51,961 --> 00:55:53,340
it's not that my dad
was even that special.

1931
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:57,230
They g my dad was like the score,

1932
00:55:57,231 --> 00:56:01,770
like the six smartest in Texas and they
got a group of less than 10 kids and

1933
00:56:01,771 --> 00:56:04,800
they brought him in as juniors
in high school and shed.

1934
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:06,840
We're going to do all this.

1935
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:08,700
Like they recruited him
because I wanted to be a NASA.

1936
00:56:08,701 --> 00:56:09,690
That's why we're in the natural shirt.

1937
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:10,800
So when it gets in here,

1938
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,270
cause because Eddie's right,

1939
00:56:12,271 --> 00:56:13,470
NASA is a big secret group.

1940
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,090
It's the other side of
the breakaway government.

1941
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,650
There's the CIA breakaway government in
1947 and there's Kennedy setting up NASA

1942
00:56:19,651 --> 00:56:23,830
in 1961 so they're two different
competing breakaway governments.

1943
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:26,770
And those are the real governments
in the USA by breakaway governments.

1944
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:28,720
What do you mean breakaway governments?

1945
00:56:28,721 --> 00:56:30,100
Breakaway civilizations.

1946
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:30,791
Each,

1947
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:32,830
the real groups that are like the cult,

1948
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:33,071
you say,

1949
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:33,730
who are they?

1950
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,810
They're scientists cults
who were based on uh,

1951
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,590
your,

1952
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:39,423
uh,

1953
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,780
psychic ability,

1954
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:42,370
uh,

1955
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:47,200
and on your Iq and then on
your commitment to the program.

1956
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:51,040
And so the program starts with where you
go and check black people with syphilis

1957
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,780
for greater cost or will you do research
programs on babies where we tell poor

1958
00:56:55,781 --> 00:56:56,530
women,

1959
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,250
uh,

1960
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,280
that Oh your baby died
right when they born.

1961
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:00,700
We're rolling.

1962
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,530
We'll keep the baby alive
and sometimes kill him.

1963
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,840
And I was harvest them sometimes
do experiments on them.

1964
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,050
That's why they've got a lot of
nurses have notice now that the baby's

1965
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:08,500
disappeared.

1966
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,100
Birth.

1967
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,040
And I tell him all your baby die.

1968
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:11,200
That's why the governor said,

1969
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,510
who's actually an Orban harvesting doctor?

1970
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,200
He goes,

1971
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,820
we keep the babies in love after Lou boom.

1972
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:17,980
Have a discussion.

1973
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:21,010
They are getting caught now
cause we'd be compartmentalized.

1974
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,260
What w I'm confused.

1975
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:23,861
What you're seeing.

1976
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:24,700
How it just never ends.

1977
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:25,180
Yeah.

1978
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,500
What you saying about babies?

1979
00:57:26,501 --> 00:57:26,750
Like,

1980
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,000
what did they do with babies?

1981
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:28,271
You,

1982
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:30,430
you saw the governor of Virginia Shay.

1983
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:32,200
We keep babies alive after
they're born and killed him.

1984
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:32,890
Right?

1985
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:33,340
Well,

1986
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,240
I didn't see that.

1987
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,130
I am very,

1988
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:39,760
very concerned with late term abortions.

1989
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,820
Post-Birth Joe,

1990
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,340
she understand post-birth how
much money do you think they get?

1991
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:47,980
Wait for a seven and a half pound baby.

1992
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:50,770
They can keep alive for two
weeks and Mama doesn't know.

1993
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,230
So if they can register
the organs and get bitters,

1994
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,380
but wait a minute,

1995
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:01,380
you're saying they can make 500,000
would be saying that the they kill on the

1996
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:03,040
spot only gets 50 grand.

1997
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,070
But even saying that they take the baby
from the mother and the mother doesn't

1998
00:58:06,071 --> 00:58:07,180
know that the baby's alive.

1999
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:07,931
Yeah.

2000
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:09,590
You know how they engineered tomatoes?

2001
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:10,570
The last on the shelf?

2002
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,493
Yes.

2003
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:14,440
You can pull all this up.

2004
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,180
California's past it.

2005
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:17,260
Uh,

2006
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,093
she'd be in Virginia.

2007
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,180
Virginia is about to pass it.

2008
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,290
New York trying to pass it.

2009
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:23,680
California trying to pass in three other
states are trying to pass it to keep

2010
00:58:23,681 --> 00:58:25,570
babies alive and allow notice.

2011
00:58:25,571 --> 00:58:26,404
The governor goes,

2012
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,270
we don't want this three minute clip.

2013
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:28,720
Pull it up.

2014
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,700
We don't want the Gloveman vol.

2015
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:33,700
The doctors and the
modal who's drugged up.

2016
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:34,534
You didn't say that.

2017
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:39,040
I'll go on this sad about the future
and maybe she keeps baby alive a week.

2018
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,170
Maybe she sat to get rid of baby.

2019
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:41,861
Wait a minute.

2020
00:58:41,861 --> 00:58:43,360
Is this a viable baby?

2021
00:58:43,361 --> 00:58:45,110
There's nothing wrong
with this paper viable.

2022
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,620
The Senate voted three days ago on Monday

2023
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:54,210
to not pass the bill for post birth
abortion to not kill livable post birds as

2024
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,390
viable.

2025
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:00,480
Baby's already born can be
killed if the bioethics sport.

2026
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,730
I bet you 10 millions
probably that up Jamie.

2027
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:05,290
We've got to figure it out of
the lessors won't believe me.

2028
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,470
We can go crazy posts about this,

2029
00:59:08,471 --> 00:59:09,310
but it says that he did.

2030
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,230
It's been taken out of context.

2031
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,180
What does that media matters?

2032
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:14,803
Snopes,

2033
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:17,140
Huffington post is that
since it's mostly false.

2034
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:17,411
Ah,

2035
00:59:17,411 --> 00:59:19,410
Huffington Snopes said no,

2036
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:20,741
you do this.

2037
00:59:20,741 --> 00:59:21,380
Jamie.

2038
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:21,771
Jamie,

2039
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:22,011
go to,

2040
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:23,420
you'd go to the source of the governor,

2041
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:28,310
go to youtube and type
in governor of Virginia,

2042
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:30,020
talks about post birth abortion.

2043
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:31,990
Watched the unedited three minute video.

2044
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:34,160
Do you call it abortion
if it's already been born?

2045
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:34,641
Well,

2046
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:35,391
that's what Trump said.

2047
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:36,170
He said,

2048
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,640
he said a month ago when this first broke,

2049
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:38,474
he said,

2050
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:39,880
I see the leftist still compartmentalize.

2051
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:40,251
I'm saying her,

2052
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:41,410
the less mainstream media,

2053
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:41,930
whatever,

2054
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,160
we're so censored now.

2055
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:44,270
They're making their move right now.

2056
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:45,913
Who's Day?

2057
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,850
The globalist technocracy
the mad scientist.

2058
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:52,320
The guys that are one and learn the
secrets of the universe is probably only

2059
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:52,820
seven.

2060
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,100
So what you're saying is
a lot of this censorship,

2061
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,860
I don't have 10 million,

2062
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:02,270
I will give before God
and country to Jamie's.

2063
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:03,860
Uh,

2064
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,753
I'm not kidding.

2065
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:10,180
I will give $1 million to your
charity of choice right now.

2066
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,240
Listen to me.

2067
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,260
This is a serious change.

2068
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:13,280
You need to come out eight children.

2069
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:19,130
I will give you $1 million if you can
prove that I'm making up that the governor

2070
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:20,601
said,

2071
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:22,520
we keep babies alive after they're born.

2072
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:26,030
We keep them comfortable and then it
turns out he's an organ harvesting thing

2073
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:26,864
and that's what they're doing.

2074
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:28,820
So they keep babies alive.

2075
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:29,990
Don't go to Snopes.

2076
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,100
Go to the governor,

2077
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:34,220
go to the governor of Virginia.

2078
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:37,110
And that's why they want to head
and burning for the black face.

2079
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:38,270
But they were using the blackmailing.

2080
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,380
They already had that on him as soon.

2081
01:00:40,381 --> 01:00:41,180
Same Guy,

2082
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:41,810
same guy.

2083
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,280
As soon as he sailing,

2084
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,080
as soon as Trump.

2085
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:45,771
And we all covered it.

2086
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:46,610
As soon as he tweeted,

2087
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:47,271
he said,

2088
01:00:47,271 --> 01:00:47,481
yes,

2089
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,190
we're getting rid of babies
after they're already born.

2090
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,053
You don't want of that.

2091
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:50,690
No,

2092
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,090
we already have figured out what
George Soros is putting in it right

2093
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:55,161
now.

2094
01:00:55,161 --> 01:00:55,371
I mean,

2095
01:00:55,371 --> 01:00:56,680
I oversimplify that the media took,

2096
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:01,550
I know I said they've weaponized marijuana
into an Ellucian as gin category,

2097
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:03,380
so it causes more schizophrenia.

2098
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,460
I think it does.

2099
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:06,040
I said that two years ago and Courtney.

2100
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:06,271
I agree.

2101
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:06,530
Yeah,

2102
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,490
I think it does.

2103
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:11,810
I think it does research a lot of friends
who are already susceptible and the

2104
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:12,670
weeds so strong that,

2105
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:12,820
that,

2106
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:16,040
that they start thinking that
I'm wearing swastika shoes.

2107
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:16,251
No,

2108
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:16,521
listen,

2109
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:17,810
I agree with you on that.

2110
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,081
I mean,

2111
01:01:18,081 --> 01:01:18,550
I think,

2112
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,040
um,

2113
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,340
I've a strong alpha types need
it to not have a heart attack.

2114
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:23,451
Well,

2115
01:01:23,451 --> 01:01:26,070
I don't know if I needed to know what
you wanted me to smoke pot with you in

2116
01:01:26,071 --> 01:01:26,241
that,

2117
01:01:26,241 --> 01:01:26,901
in that bathroom,

2118
01:01:26,901 --> 01:01:29,240
shooting the video like as
a joke like 20 years ago.

2119
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,601
Yeah.

2120
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:29,871
Yeah.

2121
01:01:29,871 --> 01:01:30,890
Then I said it makes me paranoid.

2122
01:01:30,891 --> 01:01:31,071
Yeah.

2123
01:01:31,071 --> 01:01:31,760
That was funny,

2124
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:31,970
Joe.

2125
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:32,781
The only time I feel,

2126
01:01:32,781 --> 01:01:36,740
feel we weird fucking George Bush and
George Bush senior master dance around the

2127
01:01:36,741 --> 01:01:38,360
Capitol was fun time.

2128
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:41,930
Nobody's devalued the feast and leave
the song that you wrote you at that

2129
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:43,070
fucking song about it.

2130
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:43,490
Jamie.

2131
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:43,791
Jamie,

2132
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:44,624
this isn't a joke.

2133
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:46,980
I will give $1 million.

2134
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:47,960
You don't have to give any money,

2135
01:01:47,961 --> 01:01:49,040
but I believe you.

2136
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:49,851
I just want a little bit.

2137
01:01:49,851 --> 01:01:50,720
I have skin in the game.

2138
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,010
I'll get pulled up on my phone.

2139
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:52,850
I believe you.

2140
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:53,091
I mean,

2141
01:01:53,091 --> 01:01:53,900
he's going to find it.

2142
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:54,733
We'll listen to it.

2143
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,753
You don't have to.

2144
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:56,893
We're listening to you.

2145
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:59,180
And then he uses these arguments.

2146
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:00,710
He uses these arguments.

2147
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:01,371
He goes,

2148
01:02:01,371 --> 01:02:01,581
well,

2149
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:03,130
sometimes it's blue.

2150
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:06,530
Sometimes the baby is just the phone.

2151
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:07,400
No,

2152
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,990
they want the organs.

2153
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:13,160
And so who saw the planned parenthood
videos out of Texas to California two

2154
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:13,551
years ago?

2155
01:02:13,551 --> 01:02:14,001
The project,

2156
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:14,631
Veritas and others,

2157
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:15,080
God,

2158
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:15,311
who are,

2159
01:02:15,311 --> 01:02:15,950
they're saying,

2160
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,240
I'm getting a yellow Ferrari,

2161
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:18,141
man,

2162
01:02:18,141 --> 01:02:19,860
I'm making hundreds of
thousands off each baby.

2163
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:20,280
We

2164
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:20,931
partial birth,

2165
01:02:20,931 --> 01:02:22,500
they keep the baby alive,

2166
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:27,120
they take it in the bag and then they
have a van pull up that takes it to a

2167
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:30,420
Chinese government run facility in
the u s and they got the sucker.

2168
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,210
Let's listen to this division after birth.

2169
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:33,501
The boards.

2170
01:02:33,501 --> 01:02:34,334
This is a gym,

2171
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:36,210
Alex.

2172
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:36,600
Yeah.

2173
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,050
Okay.

2174
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:41,010
Hearing yesterday when Fairfax County
Delicate Kathy Tran made her case for

2175
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:45,030
lifting restrictions on third trimester
abortions as well as other restrictions

2176
01:02:45,031 --> 01:02:45,864
now in place.

2177
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:50,040
And she was pressed by Republican delegate
about whether her bill would permit

2178
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:54,240
an abortion even as a woman is
essentially dilating ready to give birth.

2179
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:59,510
And she answered that it would permit
an abortion at that stage of labor.

2180
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:04,070
Do you support her measure
and unexplained her answer?

2181
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:04,381
Yeah,

2182
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:04,770
and I,

2183
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:05,130
you know,

2184
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:06,150
I wasn't there.

2185
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:06,600
Uh,

2186
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,570
Julie and I certainly can't speak for,

2187
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:09,960
uh,

2188
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,860
delegate Tran.

2189
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:11,270
But,

2190
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:11,760
um,

2191
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,370
I will tell you one
first thing I would say.

2192
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:18,900
This is why decisions such as
this should be made by providers,

2193
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:19,883
physicians,

2194
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:20,550
uh,

2195
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:21,181
and uh,

2196
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:21,720
the,

2197
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,380
uh,

2198
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,080
mothers and fathers that are involved.

2199
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:25,690
Janet,

2200
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:27,210
I'm interrupted her or
back up two seconds.

2201
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,570
Notice he's usurping law and
their whole plan is bioethics.

2202
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:31,190
Let's wait a minute,

2203
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:32,350
but let's let him let him,

2204
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:34,023
two minutes.

2205
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,910
Mothers and fathers that are involved.

2206
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:37,900
Um,

2207
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,471
there are,

2208
01:03:38,471 --> 01:03:38,890
you know,

2209
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:41,590
when we talk about third
trimester abortions,

2210
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:46,620
these are done with the
consent of obviously the
mother with the consent of the

2211
01:03:47,771 --> 01:03:49,690
physicians more than one physician,

2212
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,553
by the way.

2213
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:51,100
Um,

2214
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:54,550
and it's done in cases where
there may be severe deformities,

2215
01:03:54,551 --> 01:03:55,300
there may be a,

2216
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,400
a fetus that's non Bible.

2217
01:03:57,730 --> 01:03:59,410
So in this particular example,

2218
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:01,060
if a mother is in labor,

2219
01:04:01,061 --> 01:04:03,430
I can tell you exactly what would happen.

2220
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,620
The infant would be delivered,

2221
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:06,140
uh,

2222
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,900
the infant would be kept comfortable.

2223
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:08,500
Uh,

2224
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,540
the infant would be resuscitated if,

2225
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:13,510
if that's what the mother
and the family desired.

2226
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:17,620
And then a discussion would ensue
between the physicians and the mother.

2227
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:18,110
So,

2228
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:20,530
so I think this was really
blown out of proportion.

2229
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:21,580
But again,

2230
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:25,780
we want the government not to be
involved in these types of decisions.

2231
01:04:25,781 --> 01:04:27,790
We want the decision to be made by,

2232
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:28,170
uh,

2233
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:28,580
the,

2234
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:30,400
the mothers and their providers.

2235
01:04:30,401 --> 01:04:30,681
And,

2236
01:04:30,681 --> 01:04:32,620
and this is why Julie,

2237
01:04:32,621 --> 01:04:33,760
that legislators,

2238
01:04:33,761 --> 01:04:35,470
most of whom are men by the way,

2239
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:38,890
shouldn't be telling a woman what she
should and shouldn't be doing with our

2240
01:04:38,891 --> 01:04:39,530
body.

2241
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:43,640
And do you think multiple physicians
should have to weigh in as is currently

2242
01:04:43,641 --> 01:04:44,091
required?

2243
01:04:44,091 --> 01:04:45,370
She's trying to lift that requirement.

2244
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:45,931
Well,

2245
01:04:45,931 --> 01:04:49,050
I think it's always good to
get a second opinion and for,

2246
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:53,070
for at least two providers to be
involved in that decision because these

2247
01:04:53,071 --> 01:04:54,710
decisions shouldn't be taken lightly.

2248
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,050
And so I would certainly
support more than one provider.

2249
01:04:58,530 --> 01:04:59,030
Let's

2250
01:04:59,030 --> 01:04:59,870
go back to the front.

2251
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:00,591
Wow.

2252
01:05:00,591 --> 01:05:02,930
That's a weird thing that
she just kind of let him say,

2253
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:04,370
um,

2254
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:05,370
to the rough story,

2255
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,460
but hold on a second.

2256
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:07,611
It's,

2257
01:05:07,611 --> 01:05:10,630
what's weird is that she was talking,

2258
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,550
they were talking about
resuscitating the baby,

2259
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,200
that they would keep the baby alive.

2260
01:05:15,201 --> 01:05:16,490
Then a decision would be made.

2261
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:17,763
Isn't that,

2262
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:18,130
that's

2263
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,060
like use in Asia.

2264
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:19,331
Like,

2265
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:21,250
you can't even do that a
grant while you're so smart,

2266
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,090
gentleman cause your ass.

2267
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,920
But you can't do that to your grammy.

2268
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:24,371
Right?

2269
01:05:24,371 --> 01:05:24,620
Your,

2270
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:25,750
he's like 80 years old.

2271
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:26,260
You can't,

2272
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,250
you can't just kill her.

2273
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:30,130
She suffered a Newsweek cover
it the case for killing granny.

2274
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:30,941
They say that.

2275
01:05:30,941 --> 01:05:33,610
So let me explain now you've got it.

2276
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:34,780
Did you hear that?

2277
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:38,020
Legalees turns out when I
saw that clip a month ago,

2278
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,690
cause they had them do
a debate about the bill,

2279
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:41,740
right?

2280
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,780
And they said yeah we'll kill
babies after they're born.

2281
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,130
And they're debatable how,

2282
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:46,780
how far along what
whatever the doctors say.

2283
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,080
But its jurisprudence,

2284
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:50,741
there's law,

2285
01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:51,580
you can't do that.

2286
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,190
So this just say oh the
government not involved.

2287
01:05:54,191 --> 01:05:55,390
This is the medical system.

2288
01:05:55,391 --> 01:05:57,880
You serpent if they can
kill a baby after it's born.

2289
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:00,100
Cause sometimes they deformed.

2290
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:00,551
You don't see that.

2291
01:06:00,551 --> 01:06:01,510
Sometimes they the phone,

2292
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,273
here's the key.

2293
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:06,400
Notice he shed,

2294
01:06:06,401 --> 01:06:07,420
we resuscitate.

2295
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:12,900
They don't consider you alive till the
bio ethics board shares that you're a

2296
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:17,620
viable human and under the bioethics
in Europe and under the UN now,

2297
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:20,590
which is all Nazi by where the
EU was set up by the Nazis.

2298
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:21,701
Volkswagen,

2299
01:06:21,701 --> 01:06:22,170
I'm not against fullest,

2300
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:22,721
I going to sell,

2301
01:06:22,721 --> 01:06:24,970
but that that was literally drawn
the first of all texted by Hitler,

2302
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:25,601
Audi,

2303
01:06:25,601 --> 01:06:26,434
the Olympic symbol.

2304
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:26,711
I mean,

2305
01:06:26,711 --> 01:06:27,850
Hitler was a really bad dude,

2306
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:29,490
but he literally so much
of our world's government,

2307
01:06:29,491 --> 01:06:29,740
him,

2308
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:30,251
NASA,

2309
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:31,084
everything.

2310
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,320
They had a system where
they first killed babies,

2311
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:36,310
they thought were deformed.

2312
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,480
That was 1934 the final
solution happened like six,

2313
01:06:40,481 --> 01:06:44,470
seven years later and so he's saying
because they've got a big problem,

2314
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:45,420
they've got an undercover videos,

2315
01:06:45,421 --> 01:06:46,390
they're keeping babies alive.

2316
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:47,290
You want to pull those up.

2317
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:48,123
I'm not be yessing.

2318
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:48,490
There's hot,

2319
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:49,323
there's dozens,

2320
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:54,400
so they've got to start getting it going
now with governor physicians and people

2321
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,940
to go because the nurses are
freaking out and they're saying,

2322
01:06:57,941 --> 01:07:00,610
we're keeping babies alive and they get
put in a van and drive away what's going

2323
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:00,761
on.

2324
01:07:00,761 --> 01:07:01,270
They're like,

2325
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:02,000
oh,

2326
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
kids comfortable show the baby's worth
$500,000 who's paying the in the chain of

2327
01:07:08,861 --> 01:07:10,600
delivery just on time delivery?

2328
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:12,010
I mean,

2329
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:14,980
each Oregon's worth a lot of money and so,

2330
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:15,221
but,

2331
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:16,990
but if you kill him right on the spot,

2332
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:17,651
they're like,

2333
01:07:17,651 --> 01:07:17,981
wow,

2334
01:07:17,981 --> 01:07:20,320
we wasted this seven pounds of meat.

2335
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,750
So see if they can keep him alive.

2336
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,280
And now they've built these new wings.

2337
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,080
They've built new eggs so I can shut,

2338
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:26,650
pull up a book.

2339
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,870
They have wings where they go,

2340
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:29,350
oh,

2341
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:31,210
we consider the baby dead.

2342
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:33,550
The mother decided it didn't live.

2343
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:37,330
If she decides we
resuscitate and it lives,

2344
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,790
but it didn't resuscitate,

2345
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:40,810
it's flesh.

2346
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:41,860
It's illegal east,

2347
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:47,010
it's passed into a special
ward with doctors and make
a few million a year and a

2348
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:47,811
little,

2349
01:07:47,811 --> 01:07:49,330
a little foolish.

2350
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:54,331
Bolo is kept alive and comfortable until
all the oldest come in the planes land

2351
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,060
and they take the logins.

2352
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:03,300
Then they take the blood and they
take the skin Joe and you see,

2353
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,013
oh,

2354
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,540
now you know with his voice.

2355
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:07,781
No,

2356
01:08:07,781 --> 01:08:07,991
no,

2357
01:08:07,991 --> 01:08:08,591
but see,

2358
01:08:08,591 --> 01:08:10,450
it's the southern loving bullets.

2359
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:11,740
You See,

2360
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:16,160
my dad knew Oregon Harvesters
in Dallas and he shed

2361
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,050
don't sign your organ donor card.

2362
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,770
They've got corrupt hospitals
where if you are totally viable,

2363
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:22,910
they take your organs.

2364
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:23,540
Oh Jeez.

2365
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:24,560
And then I said,

2366
01:08:24,561 --> 01:08:24,801
dad,

2367
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:25,311
you're crazy.

2368
01:08:25,311 --> 01:08:28,370
But I didn't send the organ donor card
and then am I know in the hospital two in

2369
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:29,000
Dallas.

2370
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,820
Then when I was deck,

2371
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:33,840
a decade later at my
grandparent's house warming,

2372
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:36,110
grandpa died watching 60
minutes and it was Dallas,

2373
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:40,730
Texas and Chicago caught killing people
that were viable to take their organs.

2374
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,980
Tonight they 60 minutes expose a,

2375
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:44,930
and it was a freaking hospital.

2376
01:08:44,931 --> 01:08:48,170
My Dad told me about Jesus Christ.

2377
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:48,621
So Joe,

2378
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:49,910
that's what I'm telling you is,

2379
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:53,090
were you at the kitchen table when
you were eight hearing about cyborgs?

2380
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:54,351
See,

2381
01:08:54,351 --> 01:08:55,490
that's why I know about this.

2382
01:08:55,491 --> 01:08:57,140
My Dad never got fully into it.

2383
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,580
He decided to get out of it

2384
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,550
and he decided to get out of it.

2385
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:02,750
He just thought of that,

2386
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:04,670
you're legitimately
freaking me the fuck out,

2387
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:05,480
Joe.

2388
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:05,900
I will.

2389
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,920
I will let you know.

2390
01:09:06,921 --> 01:09:10,400
The problem is some of it makes sense
because people figure out a way to

2391
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:11,630
rationalize a lot of things.

2392
01:09:11,631 --> 01:09:13,740
And if you see a guy's
mangled in a car accident,

2393
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:17,540
but he's still alive and you know
you could sell the you broken,

2394
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:19,520
he can save five loaves.

2395
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,800
Yakim comfortable.

2396
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:22,993
Yeah.

2397
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,340
I mean Joe the,

2398
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:28,380
but the thing is how many people would
have to be involved for that to be real?

2399
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:28,730
Joe,

2400
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:29,690
I can show you,

2401
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:31,880
let's not exaggerate.

2402
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:37,390
15 videos of planned parenthood workers
laughing saying I made 1 million bucks

2403
01:09:38,991 --> 01:09:39,411
yesterday,

2404
01:09:39,411 --> 01:09:39,861
last year.

2405
01:09:39,861 --> 01:09:40,694
It's incredible.

2406
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:41,990
If we can just keep them alive longer,

2407
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:43,130
we'll get 10 times the money.

2408
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:46,610
We're only getting 50 grand per baby cause
we got to kill them before they leave

2409
01:09:46,611 --> 01:09:47,390
the building.

2410
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:48,720
The mother doesn't know their,

2411
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:49,790
they talk her into it.

2412
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:50,691
Oh ma'am,

2413
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:51,470
you're three months pregnant.

2414
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:52,700
All the baby might have a problem.

2415
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:53,990
I'd have a heart murmur.

2416
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:54,351
Oh,

2417
01:09:54,351 --> 01:09:55,040
the ultrasound.

2418
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:55,670
Oh yeah.

2419
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:57,050
And then they get the,

2420
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:58,700
you're saying you're gonna
get to this is the truth.

2421
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:59,623
Yeah.

2422
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:00,890
They then keep it alive,

2423
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:01,910
but only a few hours.

2424
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,600
And they got to get planes coming in and
vans and they don't get the full price

2425
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:07,270
because they can't put it on the auctions.

2426
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,470
They've got digital corporate options.

2427
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:10,520
Look this up for Oregon.

2428
01:10:10,521 --> 01:10:11,001
So let me,

2429
01:10:11,001 --> 01:10:12,380
let me bring something up to you.

2430
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:13,790
I had this guy on yesterday,

2431
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,620
this guy who wrote this book,

2432
01:10:15,621 --> 01:10:19,400
a l Narcos name was
Johan Grillo and he's a,

2433
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:23,090
he's an investigative journalist who
lives in Mexico and he studies the cartel,

2434
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:23,953
they she'll organs.

2435
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,690
And this is one of the things
he was saying was that they,

2436
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:31,040
they get these people used to killing
and they were getting these kids and

2437
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:34,820
having these kids kill at a young age
and dismember people and they were doing

2438
01:10:34,821 --> 01:10:36,080
it to get the fear out of their body.

2439
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,760
So this one guy who a,

2440
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:38,870
they had a nickname for him,

2441
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:39,620
Tyson,

2442
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:40,220
he would,

2443
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:41,150
he was a cop,

2444
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:45,920
but he was also in charge of hiring these
little kids and training these little

2445
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:47,030
kids to be assassins.

2446
01:10:47,031 --> 01:10:48,740
And he would teach them
how to dismember people.

2447
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:49,880
And he was going into it.

2448
01:10:49,881 --> 01:10:52,190
And all the things they did and
all the beheadings that they did.

2449
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,170
And he was saying that they'd try to,

2450
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:59,270
that in certain certain groups of
people when they have this organization,

2451
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,900
they try to get them
used to horrific acts.

2452
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:03,501
Well it's called the,

2453
01:11:03,501 --> 01:11:07,310
she meant a blood and that's
an Heinrich Himmler term.

2454
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,090
Uh,

2455
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:11,930
head of the ash ash is that the
SS show Hillar had about seven,

2456
01:11:11,931 --> 01:11:12,231
eight years.

2457
01:11:12,231 --> 01:11:13,710
We launched the war show.

2458
01:11:13,711 --> 01:11:14,070
He got

2459
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:19,070
like 12 year olds ready for war and
they would get them like having fun and

2460
01:11:19,171 --> 01:11:21,000
swimming and working out at boxing.

2461
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:22,980
And then they would like
when they're like 15,

2462
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:25,530
give a super hot hooker
and then give them drugs,

2463
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,690
LSD and discovered Switzerland.

2464
01:11:27,691 --> 01:11:28,770
Hitler was put them all on it,

2465
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:29,611
DMT,

2466
01:11:29,611 --> 01:11:30,420
everything.

2467
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,120
And they would then have these
religious experiences and say,

2468
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:34,080
you're invincible.

2469
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:35,280
You're superman.

2470
01:11:35,281 --> 01:11:36,300
This has all been declassified.

2471
01:11:36,301 --> 01:11:37,620
But it said more esoteric writings.

2472
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:40,950
And so they would get them all wound up.

2473
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:43,770
And then to graduate as an SS officer.

2474
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:44,760
After you'd had a dog,

2475
01:11:44,761 --> 01:11:45,421
like five years,

2476
01:11:45,421 --> 01:11:46,920
you had to strangle your German shepherd.

2477
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:47,701
Yeah.

2478
01:11:47,701 --> 01:11:48,121
That was,

2479
01:11:48,121 --> 01:11:48,330
uh,

2480
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:49,170
my friend Ari.

2481
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:50,580
His Dad was in the,

2482
01:11:50,581 --> 01:11:52,170
is really special forces,

2483
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:53,610
one of those one brand.

2484
01:11:53,611 --> 01:11:54,780
Would you remember what branch was?

2485
01:11:55,080 --> 01:12:00,000
One branch of the Israeli military
and they had a kill a kitten and like,

2486
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:00,290
like,

2487
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:00,540
look,

2488
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:02,280
Jews are just like anybody else.

2489
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:02,851
There's good people,

2490
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:03,331
there's bad people.

2491
01:12:03,331 --> 01:12:04,050
But yeah,

2492
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:07,430
Israel because they got so screwed by
the Nazis in a lot of sickening ways.

2493
01:12:07,431 --> 01:12:08,460
Just kind of copied a lot of it.

2494
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:09,250
And by the way,

2495
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:10,170
the Palestinian trying to kill him,

2496
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:10,501
blow him up.

2497
01:12:10,501 --> 01:12:11,130
I'm not even,

2498
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:11,741
my point is,

2499
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:16,140
is that the Nazis got evil down so much
that like we brought 34,000 in to run

2500
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:16,974
NASA,

2501
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,120
the run the universities,

2502
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,230
operation paperclip,

2503
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:20,400
everybody wanted Nazis.

2504
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:23,130
They were learning to be more like
winning the lottery because they were all

2505
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:24,570
robots and we do whatever they were told.

2506
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:25,170
Well,

2507
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,940
Wernher von Braun was headed.

2508
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:27,490
Absolutely.

2509
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:28,323
Yeah.

2510
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:29,190
So yeah.

2511
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:31,080
And he was a Nazi show show.

2512
01:12:31,081 --> 01:12:31,411
Show what,

2513
01:12:31,411 --> 01:12:33,150
what happened was first
they gave him a sacs,

2514
01:12:33,151 --> 01:12:34,050
they gave him power.

2515
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,550
They would really press room.

2516
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:38,460
You had to go through things and then,

2517
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:39,653
uh,

2518
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,400
they would basically,

2519
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:44,490
you'll just conditioned them
to do whatever they were
told and they call it the

2520
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:49,470
cement of blood because then
it's just like satanic cults say,

2521
01:12:49,471 --> 01:12:49,651
you know,

2522
01:12:49,651 --> 01:12:50,484
kill your dog.

2523
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:50,761
I mean,

2524
01:12:50,761 --> 01:12:51,840
I remember when I was
growing up in a Rockwell,

2525
01:12:51,841 --> 01:12:52,291
Texas,

2526
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:53,490
I ran into like a and call.

2527
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:53,731
I was like,

2528
01:12:53,731 --> 01:12:53,881
God,

2529
01:12:53,881 --> 01:12:55,050
this girl is a senior in high school.

2530
01:12:55,051 --> 01:12:55,884
She super odd.

2531
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:56,431
I'm in,

2532
01:12:56,431 --> 01:12:56,791
I'm in,

2533
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:57,624
I'm in a,

2534
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,770
I'm in ninth grade and like she's picking
me up in a Mercedes and I'm taking me

2535
01:13:01,771 --> 01:13:04,770
some mansion and the sex
with her is incredible.

2536
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:08,250
And I'm walking out of the house cause
I looked like I was about 16 when I was

2537
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:10,260
13 and the dad goes,

2538
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:10,821
you're like screw him,

2539
01:13:10,821 --> 01:13:11,261
my daughter.

2540
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:11,391
Yeah,

2541
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:12,530
I screw or two.

2542
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,550
And just as soon as you join us,

2543
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:15,450
you loved Lucifer.

2544
01:13:15,451 --> 01:13:17,130
You get all of them
will tell you want boy,

2545
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,113
cause we want you.

2546
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:19,930
But by that really?

2547
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:20,520
Oh yeah.

2548
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,240
But that's,

2549
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:21,521
yeah.

2550
01:13:21,521 --> 01:13:23,460
Then I've had incredible
life look also do now.

2551
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:24,601
But the point is,

2552
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:25,540
is that El Kelly,

2553
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:25,980
you're in La,

2554
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:26,160
you know,

2555
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:26,970
but all this.

2556
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,950
But the point is he's know about all that.

2557
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:29,491
The point is,

2558
01:13:29,491 --> 01:13:31,950
is that then the satanist,

2559
01:13:31,951 --> 01:13:32,990
cause I never really got an to say this.

2560
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,301
And they said,

2561
01:13:33,301 --> 01:13:33,421
well,

2562
01:13:33,421 --> 01:13:33,631
I said,

2563
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:34,464
well what do you want?

2564
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,533
Cause I don't want to be,

2565
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:36,690
we want you to kill your dog.

2566
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:37,710
Whoa.

2567
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:38,700
And so the point is,

2568
01:13:38,701 --> 01:13:43,020
is that now all these years later
kill a loving thing that serves you,

2569
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,700
cares about you as interface.

2570
01:13:44,701 --> 01:13:45,600
Dogs are very psychic.

2571
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:46,434
The psychic buffers.

2572
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:50,370
Dogs are able to like interface with
you and they want you to take something

2573
01:13:50,371 --> 01:13:53,340
that's ready to die for you
and they want you to kill that.

2574
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:54,300
That's like killing a child.

2575
01:13:54,301 --> 01:13:55,500
A dog is very similar to child,

2576
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:56,431
very spiritual,

2577
01:13:56,431 --> 01:13:57,264
very holy.

2578
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:57,450
You know,

2579
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:57,960
very good.

2580
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,850
Donald take on its masters aura,

2581
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,020
it can be evil,

2582
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:03,240
but joggers totally spilling my guts.

2583
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:06,870
Circus people need to know about all
this and this is what's going on and this

2584
01:14:06,871 --> 01:14:08,640
is what's happening and show.

2585
01:14:08,641 --> 01:14:11,860
So they want to submit a blood
is they get people in a group

2586
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,120
and they get them to horrible,

2587
01:14:13,121 --> 01:14:14,890
evil things during per pressure.

2588
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,480
And then they create the synthesis.

2589
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:20,140
You have to know the darker elements of
the criminal networks that are inside

2590
01:14:20,141 --> 01:14:25,000
our government are actually running Mexico
as a laboratory test cause they know

2591
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:26,940
of Americans are taking,

2592
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:29,950
the Americans are tongue Ho and
they're tough and they're ready to.

2593
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:30,760
And you know,

2594
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,140
I'm part native American long,

2595
01:14:32,141 --> 01:14:34,690
like 6% Comanche and you know,

2596
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:35,853
Texas.

2597
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:37,720
And just that little bit makes me wild.

2598
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:41,380
And so they can get them
cause they're powerful,

2599
01:14:41,381 --> 01:14:42,214
they're smart,

2600
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:43,031
they're neat,

2601
01:14:43,031 --> 01:14:43,601
they're cool.

2602
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:47,530
But genetically they go
into group think really,

2603
01:14:47,531 --> 01:14:48,364
really fast.

2604
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:51,430
And so native Americans you
can mind control really fast

2605
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:53,813
was uh,

2606
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:56,830
well it's like Vietnam.

2607
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:57,041
I mean,

2608
01:14:57,041 --> 01:14:57,281
you know,

2609
01:14:57,281 --> 01:14:57,800
the little,

2610
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:57,930
the,

2611
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:58,130
the,

2612
01:14:58,130 --> 01:14:58,321
the,

2613
01:14:58,321 --> 01:14:58,500
the,

2614
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,560
the Bering land straight.

2615
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:00,550
And basically the test,

2616
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:01,550
the genetics of,

2617
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:01,910
of,

2618
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:02,860
of mezcal Americans,

2619
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:07,360
it's basically Chinese or hunt because
there was always some whites and vikings

2620
01:15:07,361 --> 01:15:08,111
even 10,000 years ago,

2621
01:15:08,111 --> 01:15:08,944
the one in the area.

2622
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:09,550
Uh,

2623
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:09,970
but,

2624
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:10,803
uh,

2625
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,150
like nobody in fights.

2626
01:15:13,151 --> 01:15:14,110
And like in Korea,

2627
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:15,163
the Chinese,

2628
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:16,800
that's what we're really
fighting their Vietnam.

2629
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:18,521
Do you think it's fricking,

2630
01:15:18,521 --> 01:15:18,731
let me,

2631
01:15:18,731 --> 01:15:19,830
they're like they're,

2632
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:20,020
they're,

2633
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,490
they're conscious and real people,

2634
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,080
but when they get into a fight,

2635
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:25,150
they all sync up and our
robots and have no fear.

2636
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:25,910
I'm,

2637
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:27,010
you're not about psychotic killers.

2638
01:15:27,011 --> 01:15:27,844
You're fighting.

2639
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:32,110
And so Asians or by about
the most fearless killers
that are like the Mongols,

2640
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,273
any of them.

2641
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:33,730
I mean,

2642
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:34,930
once agents go to war,

2643
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:39,250
it's like they do now there it's in fact
they're not even craze going wild in a

2644
01:15:39,251 --> 01:15:39,700
battle.

2645
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,050
They're like robots coming to kill you.

2646
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:43,000
And so you think that's from,

2647
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:45,820
do you think that's from their heritage
of war that they have a long like,

2648
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:47,440
like if you think about Japan,

2649
01:15:47,441 --> 01:15:52,441
Japan has a long history of being a noble
warrior culture with the Samurais and

2650
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:55,270
well it's come from the nobility.

2651
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:56,560
It's the genetics,

2652
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:56,771
right?

2653
01:15:56,771 --> 01:15:58,060
But other than genetics
is what creates that.

2654
01:15:58,061 --> 01:15:58,240
Yo,

2655
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,070
it's like 500 of you loading planes.

2656
01:16:00,071 --> 01:16:00,750
Go figure saying,

2657
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:05,620
I mean what I'm saying is think about
a place like Japan were so much martial

2658
01:16:05,621 --> 01:16:08,170
arts came from Kendo Sword.

2659
01:16:08,171 --> 01:16:11,920
Fighting a karate above a
bunch of different branches,

2660
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:12,330
accretive,

2661
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:13,031
judo,

2662
01:16:13,031 --> 01:16:13,990
Jujitsu,

2663
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:15,573
Japan,

2664
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,230
all that stuff came from Japan.

2665
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:18,360
I mean that,

2666
01:16:18,361 --> 01:16:18,640
that,

2667
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,970
that is a group of people that
were obsessed with combat.

2668
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:22,771
I mean they,

2669
01:16:22,771 --> 01:16:24,450
they figured out the ruling class was,

2670
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:27,700
well not just that the
soldiers and even the civilian,

2671
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:27,940
no,

2672
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:28,301
I agree.

2673
01:16:28,301 --> 01:16:31,330
But the ruling class
was a Samurai show guns.

2674
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,950
The ruling class was the shoguns.

2675
01:16:32,951 --> 01:16:33,190
Right.

2676
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:38,190
And when you think about what a small
place Japan is and how stunning it is that

2677
01:16:38,471 --> 01:16:39,670
so much innovation,

2678
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:41,510
especially in terms of
like one of mine at work,

2679
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:44,650
and I'll get into bell curve cause you've
got black people that are smart as any

2680
01:16:44,651 --> 01:16:45,484
white person.

2681
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,040
And then he got black people that are way
better at sports or whatever and there

2682
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:48,970
are genetic differences.

2683
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:49,640
We're not.

2684
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,100
And then you've got the
head of your former,

2685
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:51,660
you know,

2686
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:52,810
it was cold springs harbor.

2687
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,760
Watson comes out and
says blacks aren't human.

2688
01:16:54,761 --> 01:16:55,391
All that Bs.

2689
01:16:55,391 --> 01:16:57,280
That's just the racist crap
that's in the government.

2690
01:16:57,281 --> 01:17:02,281
But it's true that northern some groups
from northern Europeans and then the

2691
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:06,300
Japanese on average per
capita of the highest Iq,

2692
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,580
and so they're,

2693
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:08,500
they're Japanese.

2694
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:09,920
And then there are

2695
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,570
some northern Europeans
that have the highest Iqs,

2696
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:16,040
but then you can get into like say Jews
have very high accused on average and

2697
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:20,170
they own Jews have an extraordinary
high levels of social skills winners.

2698
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:21,500
It's a bunch of,

2699
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,480
so there's not just one
type of intelligence.

2700
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,161
Oh for sure.

2701
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:25,790
Yeah.

2702
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:26,780
Well there's,

2703
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:27,643
there's,

2704
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,070
I mean there's tests that you
can run terms of mathematics,

2705
01:17:31,071 --> 01:17:33,770
but there's no real tests you
can run in terms of social tells,

2706
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:38,771
psychic connectivity and they've proven
that DNA is a transceiver and shut my

2707
01:17:38,931 --> 01:17:39,471
skill is,

2708
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:43,070
that's why I'm usually kind of like almost
autistic is I'm just being constantly

2709
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:44,360
like everything's going on.

2710
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:46,040
But then it actually focused in,

2711
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:48,950
I can like figure out the
exact enemy operation.

2712
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:50,420
That's why they were really pissed.

2713
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:52,213
They,

2714
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,430
people that are Jewish,

2715
01:17:55,431 --> 01:17:56,151
that are German,

2716
01:17:56,151 --> 01:17:56,961
that are Chinese,

2717
01:17:56,961 --> 01:17:57,711
that are Japanese,

2718
01:17:57,711 --> 01:17:58,401
that are Italian,

2719
01:17:58,401 --> 01:18:02,180
that are Mexican people that
either through fear or whatever,

2720
01:18:02,181 --> 01:18:04,100
get into dark side,

2721
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:04,850
light side,

2722
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:05,541
get into,

2723
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:06,770
don't give people the knowledge,

2724
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:08,270
control the people,

2725
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:09,350
dumb them down,

2726
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:13,250
dominate them because they're only rocket
fuel for you to go to the next level.

2727
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,810
You know what's interesting about this,

2728
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,010
not that you're right or wrong,

2729
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:19,460
what's interesting is how many people
resist the idea that it's possible for

2730
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,320
someone to try to control everybody.

2731
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:23,870
And if you just go back in history,

2732
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:24,883
just you know,

2733
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:28,880
go back to World War II and
how Hitler controlled Germany.

2734
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:31,670
They tell you no one's
trying to control you,

2735
01:18:31,671 --> 01:18:33,590
but that's all that's going on.

2736
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:37,820
But that one is a particularly
fantastic one because it was a,

2737
01:18:37,821 --> 01:18:40,070
a culture that came out of a bad time,

2738
01:18:40,071 --> 01:18:40,520
right?

2739
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:45,350
They had out of World War One and this
guy treating and this guy offered them

2740
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:47,090
pride in being German.

2741
01:18:47,091 --> 01:18:48,380
He offered him this.

2742
01:18:48,381 --> 01:18:53,381
This idea of a master race at the master
race is a crazy idea because if you

2743
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:57,200
look at the black Israel lights or you
look at at at at La Rasa or Mecha or you

2744
01:18:57,201 --> 01:18:58,730
look at some of the
right lane Jewish cribs,

2745
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,930
every the Chinese,

2746
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,490
every group says with the master rough.

2747
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:01,881
Yeah,

2748
01:19:01,881 --> 01:19:02,420
well,

2749
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:02,871
sure,

2750
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:05,630
but I mean how many have tried to
engineer it the way Hitler did?

2751
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:06,770
That's what's really crazy.

2752
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:08,660
Exactly the reason.

2753
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:09,141
The reason,

2754
01:19:09,141 --> 01:19:09,820
the globalists,

2755
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:09,960
well,

2756
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:10,401
if you want the,

2757
01:19:10,401 --> 01:19:11,250
you want to get the sacred,

2758
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:11,720
but I'm,

2759
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:12,440
but I'm saying,

2760
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:12,640
well,

2761
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,191
Hillary's secret,

2762
01:19:13,191 --> 01:19:13,761
hold on a second.

2763
01:19:13,761 --> 01:19:18,761
What I'm saying is that it is amazing
that there is a guy who has this idea of a

2764
01:19:18,771 --> 01:19:23,510
master race and if you were all
but people rejected it worldwide,

2765
01:19:23,511 --> 01:19:25,520
it was one of the most
evil aspects of who he was.

2766
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:29,540
That's really interesting
to me that people rejected
it because they knew it was

2767
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:31,970
like an improper calculations.

2768
01:19:31,971 --> 01:19:34,250
General rejected the idea,

2769
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,750
other leads trying to duplicate it.

2770
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:37,460
It was an improper calculation.

2771
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:40,670
The calculation was the only
way to get people to get,

2772
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:41,840
you want to get a master race,

2773
01:19:41,841 --> 01:19:43,220
you have to have mastered genetics,

2774
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,760
but it didn't take into
account was compassion.

2775
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:50,510
It didn't take into account
what's necessary to have
a real healthy community.

2776
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:54,590
That was a slow fuck a quick flash
community because everybody was like

2777
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:56,150
hyperfocused on the nation.

2778
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:59,360
To have a real long term community,

2779
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:00,620
you have to have compassion,

2780
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:04,800
you have to have camaraderie and there's
going to be people aren't using to your

2781
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,980
raise the leftist
compassion when they support

2782
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,160
China and different camps and and
engineer wearing the left cell.

2783
01:20:11,161 --> 01:20:12,340
Oak Can passion.

2784
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,670
We can't hurt anyone's feelings.

2785
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:19,050
We're helping a rest fall on gung and
sell their organs that we're Google and

2786
01:20:19,051 --> 01:20:19,800
stuck to me.

2787
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:20,633
You're right,

2788
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:21,660
you're right.

2789
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:23,760
The left has giant flaws.

2790
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:26,760
It has giant flaws and
it's ridiculous ideas.

2791
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:27,210
No,

2792
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:28,200
I'm against war.

2793
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,273
I am too.

2794
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:32,610
And so now you see national
studies show this Gallup poll,

2795
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,580
Democrats now support war
more than Republicans.

2796
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:37,631
Well,

2797
01:20:37,631 --> 01:20:39,180
this is about what this is about.

2798
01:20:39,181 --> 01:20:42,750
Pulling out a series he was trying to
denuclearize and everybody's loving it,

2799
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:46,260
and South Korea and Japan and North Korea
and he's actually got them to not fire

2800
01:20:46,261 --> 01:20:46,920
missiles to destroy,

2801
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,020
declared real the real problem.

2802
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:51,870
There's a real problem with people not
being able to say that anything that

2803
01:20:51,871 --> 01:20:52,730
Trump does is good.

2804
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,530
If a Democrat was doing what
Trump was doing on some issues,

2805
01:20:55,531 --> 01:20:56,364
I district with some,

2806
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:57,330
I would support them.

2807
01:20:57,330 --> 01:21:01,110
I don't give a damn what their
deer or are well and so and so.

2808
01:21:01,111 --> 01:21:04,380
Then Trump got rid of the,

2809
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:06,210
he's getting rid of the minimum sentences.

2810
01:21:06,211 --> 01:21:07,320
I mean Hillary Clinton,

2811
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:07,880
you know,

2812
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,341
Oh God,

2813
01:21:08,341 --> 01:21:09,061
I saw this the other day.

2814
01:21:09,061 --> 01:21:09,230
I don't,

2815
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:10,063
I'm ranting.

2816
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:11,280
But I was watching,

2817
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:12,930
I forget to who the top Democrat was.

2818
01:21:12,931 --> 01:21:16,110
They were on CNN and I met to play the
clip of my show and I didn't do it.

2819
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:17,120
And they,

2820
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:17,551
and they go,

2821
01:21:17,551 --> 01:21:17,911
they go,

2822
01:21:17,911 --> 01:21:18,480
they go,

2823
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,730
president Trump thinks blacks.

2824
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:21,181
Yeah,

2825
01:21:21,181 --> 01:21:24,480
the clip was she and inch CNN says,

2826
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:26,130
Trump thinks blacks are stupid.

2827
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:28,260
And it was a CNN panel going.

2828
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:33,090
Trump says blacks are super predators
who have to be brought to heel.

2829
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:34,373
And Joe,

2830
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:35,580
that's Hillary Clinton,

2831
01:21:35,581 --> 01:21:37,950
1994 after she passed the crime act.

2832
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,180
That's her quote.

2833
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:42,540
So they are inverting reality knowing
our talking point as she did that and we

2834
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:43,830
have the video type in,

2835
01:21:43,831 --> 01:21:45,060
Hillary says blacks are super predators.

2836
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:46,650
They said Trump did it.

2837
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:47,820
It's not about Trump,

2838
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:50,040
it's that he didn't do that.

2839
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:51,151
Okay.

2840
01:21:51,151 --> 01:21:54,240
But let's get back to what we were
trying to say was that if you,

2841
01:21:54,241 --> 01:21:55,590
if he does anything good,

2842
01:21:55,591 --> 01:21:57,690
no one can accept it cause
he's on the wrong team.

2843
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:59,040
That's part of the problem with,

2844
01:21:59,041 --> 01:21:59,970
with what's going on.

2845
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,970
It's part of the problem with people
willing to accept ridiculous shit on the

2846
01:22:02,971 --> 01:22:06,660
left and people willing to
accept ridiculous shit on
the right is that we get on

2847
01:22:06,661 --> 01:22:09,030
a team and that the people
that are on the left,

2848
01:22:09,031 --> 01:22:11,370
they can't admit if the
economy's going well,

2849
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:13,080
they can't admit if think they will.

2850
01:22:13,081 --> 01:22:13,831
Bill Maher said,

2851
01:22:13,831 --> 01:22:14,750
let's crash economy.

2852
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:15,520
Oh,

2853
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,250
I dunno.

2854
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:16,350
Uh,

2855
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:17,183
you know,

2856
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:18,420
I listen,

2857
01:22:18,421 --> 01:22:21,000
I've been on his show before
and I talked to him once.

2858
01:22:21,001 --> 01:22:24,330
We did a show together once with Craig
to nobody can lie and say that he's not

2859
01:22:24,331 --> 01:22:25,310
very talented and,

2860
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:26,260
and that he's of course tie.

2861
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:27,630
He's more truthful than most leftist.

2862
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:28,860
He says I want abortion,

2863
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:32,520
I want death and the he's
a comic of telling you man,

2864
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:33,750
the shit that he's saying.

2865
01:22:33,751 --> 01:22:38,751
He's only saying cause he thinks it'll
work and I don't just show with is the

2866
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,430
highest ratings ever
gotten on invite me on?

2867
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,593
I don't know man.

2868
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,500
You don't have to talk to him.

2869
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:46,980
But what I'm saying is when he starts
talking like people were saying,

2870
01:22:46,981 --> 01:22:48,600
Oh bill Maher's mocking the red states.

2871
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:49,560
He's doing a bit,

2872
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:50,990
he's doing a bit like you thought.

2873
01:22:50,991 --> 01:22:51,840
There's funny in that.

2874
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:52,674
That's all it is.

2875
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:53,101
Like if you,

2876
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,710
if you've talked to him about
his legitimate opinions,

2877
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:58,680
he's capable of having a conversation
about legitimate opinion of it.

2878
01:22:58,681 --> 01:22:58,951
I agree.

2879
01:22:58,951 --> 01:23:01,350
But you could disagree or
decoders are wrong on that point,

2880
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:05,320
which was say that the red states
want to be the blue states.

2881
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:07,030
The demographic show the opposite I think.

2882
01:23:07,031 --> 01:23:07,864
Is this a joke?

2883
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,030
A really do I don't think even means it.

2884
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:10,301
I mean,

2885
01:23:10,301 --> 01:23:10,931
if he doesn't mean,

2886
01:23:10,931 --> 01:23:12,070
and I disagree with them by the,

2887
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:12,881
let me show,

2888
01:23:12,881 --> 01:23:14,980
let me have a thesis to let me
have to agree with you on this.

2889
01:23:14,981 --> 01:23:15,814
And I'm not saying you're wrong.

2890
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,100
Okay.

2891
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,670
Because everything I've learned is great.

2892
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:18,310
There's a,

2893
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:19,270
there's mixtures of everything.

2894
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:20,343
Yes.

2895
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,190
And by the time I go to the next spot,

2896
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,040
I forget the last thought,

2897
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:23,161
but,

2898
01:23:23,161 --> 01:23:23,881
but the point is,

2899
01:23:23,881 --> 01:23:24,714
is that,

2900
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:28,680
is that what we're saying was that he
was doing a chuck about the red states

2901
01:23:28,681 --> 01:23:31,380
wishing that they were the blue states
and you were saying that that's wrong.

2902
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:33,900
And I was saying he's just fucking around.

2903
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,070
He's like product.

2904
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:35,551
That's it.

2905
01:23:35,551 --> 01:23:36,384
That's it.

2906
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:40,180
Mainstream news is get
it as very low writing.

2907
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:41,970
She can mean went down to
almost nothing and they go,

2908
01:23:41,971 --> 01:23:42,271
oh,

2909
01:23:42,271 --> 01:23:43,410
ratings are up in the Trump era,

2910
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:44,340
like a dead cat bounce.

2911
01:23:44,341 --> 01:23:46,300
It's like 10% of what
it used to be lurking.

2912
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:50,490
You should have 15 million viewers now
the top seat and show us a million show.

2913
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:51,510
We're looking at that.

2914
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:53,400
This is the future.

2915
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:53,971
This is the,

2916
01:23:53,971 --> 01:23:54,451
this is the,

2917
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:55,950
this is where the people are real things.

2918
01:23:55,951 --> 01:23:56,581
Not scripted.

2919
01:23:56,581 --> 01:23:57,271
No teleprompters.

2920
01:23:57,271 --> 01:23:58,021
There's no teleprompters here.

2921
01:23:58,021 --> 01:23:58,854
This is real.

2922
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:01,650
And so they get up on television.

2923
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:05,870
I'm literally having Alzheimer's.

2924
01:24:05,871 --> 01:24:06,704
What was the point again?

2925
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:09,290
We were talking about Jesus Christ.

2926
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:09,921
One problem.

2927
01:24:09,921 --> 01:24:10,220
Here's the,

2928
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,540
where's the problem with no teleprompter.

2929
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:12,860
I am literally,

2930
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,690
I literally tell you what's in my brain.

2931
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:15,530
The dentures,

2932
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:17,000
like my truth doesn't mean I'm accurate.

2933
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,141
It doesn't mean I'm perfect.

2934
01:24:18,141 --> 01:24:19,490
It means I'm telling you
when I really thought,

2935
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:20,090
oh,

2936
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:21,110
I don't want to fucking around.

2937
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:22,363
I know what it is.

2938
01:24:23,570 --> 01:24:25,150
No one's watching mainstream news.

2939
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,480
No one's watching mainstream news.

2940
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:26,810
Sure.

2941
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:28,100
But let me tell you
what they are watching.

2942
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:29,300
The Big Five,

2943
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:32,870
the nightly comic shows
and comedy central shows,

2944
01:24:32,871 --> 01:24:33,704
the daily show,

2945
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:34,161
Trevor,

2946
01:24:34,161 --> 01:24:34,970
Noah,

2947
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:35,780
Stephen Colbert,

2948
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:36,500
all those guys,

2949
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,610
cause they want some relief,

2950
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:38,261
but it's,

2951
01:24:38,261 --> 01:24:39,000
it's not been,

2952
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:39,833
they want relief.

2953
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:40,340
Right.

2954
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:41,900
I used to watch their ratings are down.

2955
01:24:41,901 --> 01:24:43,100
It's still on his span as you know,

2956
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:44,270
as,

2957
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:44,461
as,

2958
01:24:44,461 --> 01:24:47,120
as other stuff because now
that no one's watching news,

2959
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:49,970
Sean Hannity do really well.

2960
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:50,661
There's an his show,

2961
01:24:50,661 --> 01:24:53,180
but only Fox because
it's seen as alternative.

2962
01:24:53,181 --> 01:24:53,730
Just like,

2963
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:54,140
oh cool.

2964
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:54,270
But,

2965
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:55,103
but what I'm saying is,

2966
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,073
well,

2967
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:56,871
promise,

2968
01:24:56,871 --> 01:24:57,980
I'm not articulating this well.

2969
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:58,911
It's the truth.

2970
01:24:58,911 --> 01:25:00,410
It's not like some packaged thing.

2971
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:06,400
They have turned all of the so called
comic shows into fake comics posing as

2972
01:25:06,591 --> 01:25:07,101
fake news,

2973
01:25:07,101 --> 01:25:08,960
people putting out political commentary,

2974
01:25:08,961 --> 01:25:11,810
which people take is real
and believe on the street.

2975
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:14,120
And so that's where all the propaganda is.

2976
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,100
And so you say bill
Maher's just joking around,

2977
01:25:16,101 --> 01:25:17,330
Bill Maher's just over here,

2978
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,000
Bill Maher,

2979
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,531
what he's doing,

2980
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:19,700
it's all a unified message.

2981
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:23,720
They have Stephen Colbert and then leaned
upon her and say that I'm a KKK member

2982
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:24,681
and make jokes.

2983
01:25:24,681 --> 01:25:26,900
And you know what people
shouted at me on the street.

2984
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:27,741
Well,

2985
01:25:27,741 --> 01:25:28,670
that's unfortunate.

2986
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:29,360
Um,

2987
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:29,810
but what,

2988
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:31,910
what I will say about
what they're trying to do,

2989
01:25:31,911 --> 01:25:34,100
they're not trying to deliver information.

2990
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:34,640
They're not,

2991
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,260
they're trying to crack jokes.

2992
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,770
I guarantee you there's a whole
writing staff kind of them all marsh,

2993
01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:42,050
the Democrats call them and
tell them what to right now.

2994
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:43,580
I don't know if that's true.

2995
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:43,940
Uh,

2996
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:46,010
but if it is as true and they do listen,

2997
01:25:46,011 --> 01:25:46,760
that's not good.

2998
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,591
And that's unfortunate.

2999
01:25:47,591 --> 01:25:47,821
It's like,

3000
01:25:47,821 --> 01:25:47,931
yeah,

3001
01:25:47,931 --> 01:25:49,250
you host the man show with Doug.

3002
01:25:49,251 --> 01:25:49,880
Stan hope.

3003
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:50,061
No,

3004
01:25:50,061 --> 01:25:50,580
the other guy,

3005
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:51,413
uh,

3006
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:53,120
uh,

3007
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,630
there's Jimmy Kimmel and national
Carolla says he gets calls every day from

3008
01:25:56,631 --> 01:25:58,160
Chucky Schumer and then they,

3009
01:25:58,161 --> 01:26:00,570
then they work on what he says
he likes television type of.

3010
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:01,401
This is what's so frustrating.

3011
01:26:01,401 --> 01:26:02,690
He might've been fucking around though.

3012
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:03,553
No,

3013
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,220
it's talking

3014
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:04,881
points man.

3015
01:26:04,881 --> 01:26:05,181
Okay.

3016
01:26:05,181 --> 01:26:06,014
I believe you.

3017
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:11,110
I believe you when Hillary lost Jimmy
Fallon went from being funny to being

3018
01:26:12,921 --> 01:26:14,120
totally weaponized.

3019
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,000
So you think it was nbcs idea?

3020
01:26:17,001 --> 01:26:19,450
Do you think it was
someone in the government,

3021
01:26:19,451 --> 01:26:21,020
the contacts NBC and says,

3022
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:22,180
Tell Jimmy showers?

3023
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:24,740
A very well known UFC
fighter that you know,

3024
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:25,610
okay,

3025
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:27,260
who has shows on discovery
and history channel?

3026
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:28,133
Am I going to say his name?

3027
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:28,940
Okay.

3028
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:30,860
And I got a call about a
month ago and they're like,

3029
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:31,723
wow,

3030
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:32,990
this is incredible.

3031
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:33,920
Don't say my name.

3032
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:34,753
You can talk about it.

3033
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:35,571
They were going off me,

3034
01:26:35,571 --> 01:26:35,871
this new,

3035
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:36,681
big lucrative shell,

3036
01:26:36,681 --> 01:26:37,514
but they said,

3037
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:40,760
you're going to come out and announce
Alex Jones on the show or we're not gonna

3038
01:26:40,761 --> 01:26:41,151
give you the show.

3039
01:26:41,151 --> 01:26:41,481
And he said,

3040
01:26:41,481 --> 01:26:42,320
no show.

3041
01:26:42,321 --> 01:26:43,154
Hell yeah man.

3042
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:44,690
Huh?

3043
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:46,550
You're going to denounce him on the show.

3044
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:48,590
What would they need that from you?

3045
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,330
From him?

3046
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:50,571
Yeah,

3047
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:53,860
but why would they need
that from him and eat him?

3048
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,490
Here's what's nounce you on the shot.

3049
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,690
Not that that just give,

3050
01:26:56,691 --> 01:26:58,400
but that gives you even more attention.

3051
01:26:58,490 --> 01:26:58,671
Well,

3052
01:26:58,671 --> 01:26:59,504
let me explain.

3053
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:00,910
That's their diluted.

3054
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:01,131
Hey,

3055
01:27:01,131 --> 01:27:02,330
well they want everybody else sensor.

3056
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:03,450
Why did Hitler says her?

3057
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,740
Why did the Russian sensor like you think
most of the time sitters ship actually

3058
01:27:06,741 --> 01:27:07,221
works yet,

3059
01:27:07,221 --> 01:27:08,060
but that's a weird one,

3060
01:27:08,061 --> 01:27:08,301
man.

3061
01:27:08,301 --> 01:27:11,630
Someone saying they're not going to
give you a gig unless you specifically

3062
01:27:11,631 --> 01:27:13,250
denounced Alex Jones happens.

3063
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,180
What kind of show is it

3064
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:16,990
the cooking show?

3065
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:17,590
No,

3066
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:17,950
Joe.

3067
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:19,300
Joe Gelena this down for you.

3068
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:20,223
Okay.

3069
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:21,521
I swear on my kids.

3070
01:27:21,521 --> 01:27:22,180
I told him the truth.

3071
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:23,013
I believe you.

3072
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:23,651
I believe you.

3073
01:27:23,651 --> 01:27:27,700
But I'm saying it just seems so crazy
that they would ask him to not to denounce

3074
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:28,600
you on a television show.

3075
01:27:28,601 --> 01:27:29,890
I'm not saying it's impossible.

3076
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:34,720
That's what everybody who's
not independent is told
because they're beholden to

3077
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:35,440
other people.

3078
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,273
You're a rarity.

3079
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,460
I'm one of the only people that not
beholding to any other network of people.

3080
01:27:39,461 --> 01:27:39,850
You're already,

3081
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:41,310
you realize I'm not just saying this,

3082
01:27:41,311 --> 01:27:42,144
just some Ken Shipp,

3083
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:47,580
who else has a big mega popular show
that's multimedia that isn't controlled by

3084
01:27:49,031 --> 01:27:49,870
a parent company

3085
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:52,483
am Corolla.

3086
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,013
Yep.

3087
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:55,273
Who else?

3088
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:56,853
Um,

3089
01:27:56,930 --> 01:27:57,920
most podcasters,

3090
01:27:57,950 --> 01:27:58,131
no.

3091
01:27:58,131 --> 01:27:58,281
No,

3092
01:27:58,281 --> 01:28:01,430
but see when you look at the numbers
that most podcasts are threatened by

3093
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:01,611
though.

3094
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:04,400
But I mean almost all of them are
backed by something cause you hit her.

3095
01:28:04,401 --> 01:28:06,860
I know for a fact that
you run your own show.

3096
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:08,203
Yup.

3097
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,793
That's a fact.

3098
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:10,340
Look,

3099
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:13,280
I've got some notes here and
all I want to say is this,

3100
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:15,320
I want apply one point
that you had about that.

3101
01:28:15,321 --> 01:28:16,154
That was really good.

3102
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,410
You were saying that
if you sense yourself,

3103
01:28:18,411 --> 01:28:18,801
he's just like,

3104
01:28:18,801 --> 01:28:20,060
has a sense of myself a little bit,

3105
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:21,200
just a little bit to make this point.

3106
01:28:21,201 --> 01:28:22,370
We started the but please bag.

3107
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:23,960
This is the big enchilada.

3108
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,100
You made it in the back,

3109
01:28:25,101 --> 01:28:27,200
start over and it and it's right you.

3110
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:29,330
We were talking and we were,

3111
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:32,090
first of all we gave it to other big hug.

3112
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:33,170
We talked it out.

3113
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:37,430
We're both happy that we're not angry at
each other and then we started talking.

3114
01:28:37,431 --> 01:28:38,450
You made a really good point.

3115
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,380
You said the thing is if you
sense yourself just 1% you say,

3116
01:28:42,381 --> 01:28:44,330
I'll just censor myself
1% that's what they want.

3117
01:28:44,331 --> 01:28:46,760
I'm going to make them happy and then
they're just going to keep moving it.

3118
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,320
They're just going to
keep moving it forward,

3119
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:49,070
move the goal forward,

3120
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:52,760
moving the goalpost and providing you
with more money and giving you more things

3121
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,940
but keep moving it in a certain
direction and if you keep giving into it,

3122
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:59,300
they're going to have a hold of you
and they can control you and that's how

3123
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:00,710
network television got started.

3124
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:02,010
If you really think about what men

3125
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,210
for network television is,

3126
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:07,320
the reason why they don't swear and
they don't have explicit content isn't

3127
01:29:07,321 --> 01:29:08,700
because people would want to see it.

3128
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,030
The reason is because the co,

3129
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,550
the advertisers won't let them.

3130
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,650
There's a whole commerce aspect to it.

3131
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:14,160
It's tough.

3132
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:14,993
It's not just,

3133
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:15,780
hey,

3134
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:17,610
you're the CSI guys or hey,

3135
01:29:17,611 --> 01:29:18,211
you're exactly.

3136
01:29:18,211 --> 01:29:21,420
And so now they've organized with
sleeping giant and immediate matters.

3137
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:26,160
A couple million people that call and
threaten and attack anybody and then

3138
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:28,050
notice show once they're done with me,

3139
01:29:28,051 --> 01:29:28,801
now it's Joe,

3140
01:29:28,801 --> 01:29:31,620
you better not have this person on
or you better have that person on.

3141
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:33,890
And so what is your shoal?

3142
01:29:33,891 --> 01:29:35,310
What is your destiny worth?

3143
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:39,330
And I always thought I was smart because
I got to analyze politics and history.

3144
01:29:39,331 --> 01:29:40,410
I was kind of socially retarded.

3145
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,260
And so I don't think you,

3146
01:29:42,261 --> 01:29:43,170
you'll have to say that anymore.

3147
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,310
Exactly.

3148
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:45,550
But I mean I was and,

3149
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:50,430
and so that's what I'm getting at is the
biggest lie is with Alan people to know

3150
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:51,630
the truth.

3151
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:55,950
I don't come up with some cold blooded
calculation about what I think's going to

3152
01:29:55,951 --> 01:29:57,000
advance my personal life.

3153
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:59,310
I really care about
people and the process.

3154
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:00,510
I've seen things wrong.

3155
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:01,081
I've grown,

3156
01:30:01,081 --> 01:30:01,801
I've heard people,

3157
01:30:01,801 --> 01:30:02,634
I apologize.

3158
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:03,090
Listen,

3159
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:03,840
that's true.

3160
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:04,381
That's true.

3161
01:30:04,381 --> 01:30:06,660
What you're just saying about you and
this is one of the things that I've always

3162
01:30:06,661 --> 01:30:07,770
tried to explain to people.

3163
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,480
If people get mad at me for knowing you,

3164
01:30:09,490 --> 01:30:09,720
Mike,

3165
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,160
I have a great time with that guy.

3166
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:12,000
Every time I see him,

3167
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,430
you and I have had a great time in Austin.

3168
01:30:14,431 --> 01:30:16,290
We had a great time with the UFC.

3169
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:19,380
We've hung out a numerous comedy
shows that I've done in Austin.

3170
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,260
I've done your show 20 years ago.

3171
01:30:22,261 --> 01:30:26,010
We've had a lot of fun together and so
when when people get mad at you about

3172
01:30:26,011 --> 01:30:27,660
sandy hook or about anything,

3173
01:30:27,661 --> 01:30:28,494
I just go.

3174
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:29,430
Even when he's,

3175
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:30,420
even when you were mad at me,

3176
01:30:30,421 --> 01:30:31,200
I wasn't mad at you.

3177
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:31,471
I was like,

3178
01:30:31,471 --> 01:30:32,670
I just got to talk to them.

3179
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:33,020
They're like,

3180
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:33,821
it's one of the reasons I,

3181
01:30:33,821 --> 01:30:38,310
Eddie Bravo got the two of us to talk
yet once we talk and just be honest with

3182
01:30:38,311 --> 01:30:38,641
each other,

3183
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:39,360
we'll be fine.

3184
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:43,800
And I want to clear this up because
when I was going big guns on you,

3185
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:45,720
just so you know what
it's like to be judged.

3186
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,620
I thought that you probably
never had on the show.

3187
01:30:49,621 --> 01:30:51,200
It was not an attempt to
get back on your show.

3188
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:51,680
Listen,

3189
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:51,870
I,

3190
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:55,740
I knew that if I had gotten to the point
where you're that upset that I must

3191
01:30:55,741 --> 01:30:56,910
have made mistakes too.

3192
01:30:56,911 --> 01:30:57,744
I'm not,

3193
01:30:58,050 --> 01:31:01,800
I'm not that person that sees things and
always points in the other direction.

3194
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:02,610
I pointed my,

3195
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:05,040
I'm a fucking ruthless self critic.

3196
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:05,933
Ruthless.

3197
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:06,990
I'm terrible.

3198
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:07,531
Like,

3199
01:31:07,531 --> 01:31:12,300
so I beat myself up about every third
house up flub one word on stage and I'll

3200
01:31:12,301 --> 01:31:13,134
sleep through the,

3201
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:13,930
there's selling,

3202
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:15,780
tossing and turning me raise this to you.

3203
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:17,970
And again,

3204
01:31:17,971 --> 01:31:18,271
shelf,

3205
01:31:18,271 --> 01:31:18,790
that's a good thing.

3206
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:20,430
It's just not going to be
a narcissist and crazy.

3207
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:22,183
Um,

3208
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,770
I got offered at the time like
$5 million with a Bitcoin,

3209
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:28,050
I think it was like $38 million
by the time it got there.

3210
01:31:28,051 --> 01:31:28,884
I refused it.

3211
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:29,980
And I,

3212
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:32,160
and I got told like eight years ago,

3213
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:33,690
I got told by two different people,

3214
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:35,760
a very well known rich people.

3215
01:31:35,761 --> 01:31:36,150
They said,

3216
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:36,420
George,

3217
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:36,820
Charles,

3218
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:36,961
you,

3219
01:31:36,961 --> 01:31:39,540
she wants to work with you and
Alexander Soros and other Soros,

3220
01:31:40,150 --> 01:31:40,610
uh,

3221
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:42,340
you just need to stop attacking him.

3222
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:43,170
Mm.

3223
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:43,690
And,

3224
01:31:43,690 --> 01:31:44,281
and by the way,

3225
01:31:44,281 --> 01:31:45,780
we want you to pump bitcoin,

3226
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:47,800
which I believe in cryptocurrencies.

3227
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:48,661
I believe it's the future.

3228
01:31:48,661 --> 01:31:49,650
We had a private Federal Reserve.

3229
01:31:49,651 --> 01:31:50,051
It's all fee.

3230
01:31:50,051 --> 01:31:50,460
God,

3231
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:51,540
I'm not judging anybody.

3232
01:31:51,541 --> 01:31:52,980
I'm just saying be careful.

3233
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:56,010
And I was showed dumb back then.

3234
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:57,270
I don't need you to say so dumb.

3235
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:59,220
I was not in the current mindset,

3236
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:00,070
the way the world worked.

3237
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,080
Like I knew how politics worked,

3238
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:05,830
and I knew how science worked
and I knew how crypto type,

3239
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:06,071
you know,

3240
01:32:06,071 --> 01:32:07,750
government and CIA stuff worked.

3241
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:10,450
But I was like never trying
to get a deal for myself.

3242
01:32:10,451 --> 01:32:11,284
I had my own thing,

3243
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:11,680
right?

3244
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:15,280
So then I look back in retrospect where,

3245
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:16,300
where that was going on.

3246
01:32:16,301 --> 01:32:18,340
So when I saw you,

3247
01:32:18,341 --> 01:32:19,390
it was my breaking point.

3248
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:20,500
Go,

3249
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:20,771
Hey,

3250
01:32:20,771 --> 01:32:22,060
Alex Jones is full of crap.

3251
01:32:22,061 --> 01:32:23,020
George Soros,

3252
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:23,883
uh,

3253
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:26,050
was a victim of the
Nazis and the Holocaust.

3254
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:26,993
That's not what I said.

3255
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:28,000
I didn't see your full crop.

3256
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:29,680
I said he wasn't a Nazi.

3257
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,060
I go to the story that I,

3258
01:32:31,061 --> 01:32:33,910
I watched the interview and
I don't know what he did.

3259
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:34,840
I don't see know the guy.

3260
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:35,680
I don't know him.

3261
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:36,160
I don't know.

3262
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,480
I've know very little about him.

3263
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:41,800
But what I remember from the story was
that he was saying that when the Nazis

3264
01:32:41,801 --> 01:32:42,634
occupied,

3265
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,470
he was with his,

3266
01:32:44,471 --> 01:32:46,030
I believe it was his own donkey vote,

3267
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,650
Godfather his godfather,

3268
01:32:47,651 --> 01:32:50,890
and took him around as a Christian
and pretended he was a Christian.

3269
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:54,190
Whether they were stealing from these
Jews when they would take take there.

3270
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:57,340
And he just thought it was normal
because he was 13 years old.

3271
01:32:57,341 --> 01:32:58,330
But he was talking about it,

3272
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,730
that he was shielded by this person.

3273
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:00,970
No,

3274
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:03,270
I would be willing to
take his explanation.

3275
01:33:03,271 --> 01:33:04,104
It's what I'm saying,

3276
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,040
but,

3277
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:06,341
but,

3278
01:33:06,341 --> 01:33:06,521
but,

3279
01:33:06,521 --> 01:33:06,731
but,

3280
01:33:06,731 --> 01:33:07,564
but here's the difference.

3281
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,980
Even before that happened with you,

3282
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:11,770
I got approached by a
major Hollywood actor,

3283
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:12,730
uh,

3284
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:14,320
that my name had been associated with,

3285
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:15,821
and they said,

3286
01:33:15,821 --> 01:33:16,654
listen,

3287
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:21,870
George Soros told me to tell you that
he'd been killed if he didn't do that and

3288
01:33:22,571 --> 01:33:23,650
that and that and that.

3289
01:33:23,651 --> 01:33:24,910
He did what he had to do.

3290
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:25,750
Right.

3291
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:26,351
And I shed,

3292
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:27,460
you tell George,

3293
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,660
if somebody put a gun to my head and shed,

3294
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:34,480
we're going to kill you if you
don't help roundup Joe Rogan's kids.

3295
01:33:34,481 --> 01:33:35,680
And put them in a concentration camp,

3296
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:37,000
I'd say,

3297
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:37,301
Oh yeah,

3298
01:33:37,301 --> 01:33:37,690
I agree with you.

3299
01:33:37,690 --> 01:33:38,650
I've got the gun away and kill him.

3300
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:39,460
Did he say,

3301
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:41,530
he just said that there
was just taking property?

3302
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:42,701
No,

3303
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:43,150
they were,

3304
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:43,781
what do you think it was?

3305
01:33:43,781 --> 01:33:44,490
Even Nazi show up.

3306
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:45,880
Take your property and
then you don't go away.

3307
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:46,803
I don't know.

3308
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:47,710
I mean I don't know.

3309
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:49,810
We know what happened in
Romania and Hungary but,

3310
01:33:49,811 --> 01:33:51,700
but Joe [inaudible] what he was saying.

3311
01:33:51,701 --> 01:33:52,870
Hey have headlines saying,

3312
01:33:53,290 --> 01:33:54,123
okay,

3313
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:57,060
so you're saying you
think that it was more no,

3314
01:33:57,061 --> 01:33:57,894
no,

3315
01:33:58,120 --> 01:33:59,440
he did an NPR interview.

3316
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:02,410
I'm not trying to go indict George Soros.

3317
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:02,711
Okay,

3318
01:34:02,711 --> 01:34:05,830
well here's where I fucked up cause I
shouldn't have even said anything about it

3319
01:34:05,831 --> 01:34:07,120
cause I don't know much about it.

3320
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:08,690
The real axle,

3321
01:34:08,770 --> 01:34:10,540
honest interpretation I've seen,

3322
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:14,710
I've seen a couple of days
overdue interpretation when
I was 42 interpretation

3323
01:34:14,711 --> 01:34:15,041
from me.

3324
01:34:15,041 --> 01:34:15,491
I'm telling you,

3325
01:34:15,491 --> 01:34:19,000
I don't know anything
about it was incorrect.

3326
01:34:19,001 --> 01:34:19,301
Sure.

3327
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:21,350
So when I'm 14 and I,

3328
01:34:21,351 --> 01:34:22,061
in retrospect,

3329
01:34:22,061 --> 01:34:22,894
if somebody shed,

3330
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:23,630
we're going to,

3331
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:25,960
you're going to help round up your
community or we're going to kill you.

3332
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:30,310
I would have tried to kill people
that were trying to kill my people.

3333
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:31,331
I get it.

3334
01:34:31,331 --> 01:34:33,580
Not Everybody's like me and I'm not
talking to the top of sky around.

3335
01:34:33,581 --> 01:34:34,181
I think I've proven,

3336
01:34:34,181 --> 01:34:35,014
I'll go up against people.

3337
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:35,981
I get,

3338
01:34:35,981 --> 01:34:36,761
you're 14,

3339
01:34:36,761 --> 01:34:38,860
you're scared and you helped the Nazis.

3340
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:41,260
He was show arrogant about it.

3341
01:34:41,261 --> 01:34:42,640
He shut it on NPR.

3342
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:46,990
He started on 16 manage and then I
learned you're being sued because you did

3343
01:34:46,991 --> 01:34:47,171
this.

3344
01:34:47,171 --> 01:34:48,250
This is why he's financing.

3345
01:34:48,490 --> 01:34:48,731
Well,

3346
01:34:48,731 --> 01:34:50,800
I'm not going to stop
shaking it because of that.

3347
01:34:50,801 --> 01:34:51,580
I get,

3348
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:52,800
he was in a bad situation.

3349
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:54,100
The problem was if you play the clip,

3350
01:34:54,101 --> 01:34:57,100
he says it was the best time of my life.

3351
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,270
It was happy making.

3352
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:00,370
Uh,

3353
01:35:00,370 --> 01:35:00,771
it was,

3354
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:04,550
it was invigorating to be there
with all this evil going on.

3355
01:35:04,551 --> 01:35:08,750
But I was with my father and I had faith
in him and so we were able to do this.

3356
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:12,380
And then I went and looked at
the logs and the records of him.

3357
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:15,620
He was like going around looking for
Anne Frank's man and getting their money.

3358
01:35:15,621 --> 01:35:16,131
And Alan,

3359
01:35:16,131 --> 01:35:16,311
yeah,

3360
01:35:16,311 --> 01:35:17,540
he got the money and some elsewhere.

3361
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,583
I'm not,

3362
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:21,140
I don't even just running up
a white flag is George Soros.

3363
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:26,150
George Soros overthrew all these
different governments toward swirls,

3364
01:35:26,151 --> 01:35:27,110
tried to crash the pound.

3365
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,580
George Soros is the,

3366
01:35:28,581 --> 01:35:32,180
is the arc type of James Bond
villains and the fact that his money,

3367
01:35:32,181 --> 01:35:34,670
so I remember being a kid when I was like

3368
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:37,251
eight years old.

3369
01:35:37,251 --> 01:35:39,050
My mom always had a
color TV in the kitchen.

3370
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,300
She cooked three meals a day.

3371
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:41,480
Can I stop you?

3372
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:41,910
What do you,

3373
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:45,020
what are you saying that
he's like crashing economies.

3374
01:35:45,021 --> 01:35:49,130
And when I was a kid watching
PBS and maybe they were lying,

3375
01:35:49,131 --> 01:35:49,964
maybe he's great.

3376
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:54,490
George Soros was an international currency
speculator who overthrew governments.

3377
01:35:54,491 --> 01:35:54,631
You,

3378
01:35:54,631 --> 01:35:55,330
you know,

3379
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:55,821
but yeah,

3380
01:35:55,821 --> 01:35:56,450
but that's what I'm saying.

3381
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:56,790
What do you,

3382
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:58,960
what he saying overthrew governments?

3383
01:35:59,050 --> 01:35:59,840
Like what did he do?

3384
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:00,830
I literally know nothing.

3385
01:36:00,831 --> 01:36:00,981
Well,

3386
01:36:00,981 --> 01:36:01,761
here's what I'm going to tell you.

3387
01:36:01,761 --> 01:36:02,870
This is actually a declassified.

3388
01:36:02,871 --> 01:36:04,130
Do you know anything about George Soros?

3389
01:36:04,131 --> 01:36:04,770
Jamie,

3390
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:06,080
they'll type in George Soros.

3391
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:06,231
Oh,

3392
01:36:06,231 --> 01:36:07,064
crashing the pound.

3393
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:08,773
Let me tell you more.

3394
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:10,850
In George Soros is view.

3395
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:13,520
After World War II,

3396
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,480
he got hired,

3397
01:36:14,481 --> 01:36:17,120
brought to the u s he worked for the CIA.

3398
01:36:17,121 --> 01:36:18,260
LSS before that.

3399
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:20,083
In his view,

3400
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:21,050
from his perspective,

3401
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:23,660
he admitted he doesn't Brag about this.

3402
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:28,640
George Soros is the guy willing to take
the money and DB it out and he's a very

3403
01:36:28,641 --> 01:36:29,331
bold guy,

3404
01:36:29,331 --> 01:36:29,760
but he's just,

3405
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:30,593
he's really smiling.

3406
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,210
I'm not kissing his ass or
you're gonna have a back.

3407
01:36:32,211 --> 01:36:32,780
He's not gonna stop me,

3408
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:34,070
wants to hang my hat on the wall towards,

3409
01:36:34,071 --> 01:36:36,560
whilst it does have 150 why does he
want to hang your head on the wall?

3410
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:38,420
Cause I went after him.

3411
01:36:38,421 --> 01:36:39,560
But the point is it doesn't matter.

3412
01:36:39,561 --> 01:36:43,100
George Soros ran the
breakup of the Soviet Union.

3413
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:44,510
George,

3414
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:46,250
I've had the former head of,

3415
01:36:46,251 --> 01:36:46,451
of,

3416
01:36:46,451 --> 01:36:48,560
of shitty got Jamie kind of thing.

3417
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:52,160
Type in George Soros
tried to crash the pound

3418
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:54,613
the pound.

3419
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:55,460
Anyways,

3420
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:55,880
the guys,

3421
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:56,540
let me tell you,

3422
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:58,460
I told you they got human pig.

3423
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,350
[inaudible] you put them in Mit.

3424
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:01,610
Okay.

3425
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:03,260
I told you they're keeping babies alive.

3426
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:08,290
You saw the governor said George
Soros is highest level deep state.

3427
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:09,291
He,

3428
01:37:09,291 --> 01:37:11,480
he is the manager or was the manager.

3429
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:13,600
Are you shooting in the secret
of the things you're saying?

3430
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:14,683
I actually know,

3431
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:16,940
but how do you know if
he has the research?

3432
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:18,970
He ran the cause I'm not the auction.

3433
01:37:18,971 --> 01:37:22,790
I was 10 years ago he ran the Marshall.

3434
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:23,550
We got here,

3435
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:26,030
did George Soros break
the Bank of England.

3436
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:26,990
It a little bigger police

3437
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:29,001
in Britain,

3438
01:37:29,001 --> 01:37:29,721
black Wednesday,

3439
01:37:29,721 --> 01:37:30,570
September 6th,

3440
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:31,730
right to the day.

3441
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,140
The speculators broke the pound.

3442
01:37:33,141 --> 01:37:34,220
They didn't actually break it,

3443
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:39,110
but they forced the British government
to pull it from the European Exchange

3444
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:40,480
Rate Mechanism joining the erm,

3445
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:41,570
which was part of the king,

3446
01:37:41,571 --> 01:37:42,404
the euro.

3447
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:44,120
The pound wants a euro.

3448
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:45,470
Scroll it up please.

3449
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:46,070
Uh,

3450
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:48,110
all those to depart from
the European currencies,

3451
01:37:48,111 --> 01:37:48,831
the British pound,

3452
01:37:48,831 --> 01:37:49,031
blah,

3453
01:37:49,031 --> 01:37:49,251
blah,

3454
01:37:49,251 --> 01:37:49,480
blah.

3455
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:52,730
Compounding the underlying problems
inherent in the pound's inclusion in the

3456
01:37:52,731 --> 01:37:53,540
erm,

3457
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:54,373
I'm not seeing this.

3458
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:55,080
Where's the part?

3459
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,220
George Soros does this.

3460
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,110
Well that's just what you pulled up.

3461
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:58,430
I mean,

3462
01:37:58,430 --> 01:37:59,110
I'm just,

3463
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:00,420
I'm just trying to find it.

3464
01:38:00,421 --> 01:38:01,110
That's all I'm saying.

3465
01:38:01,110 --> 01:38:02,490
Spotty and the writing on the wall,

3466
01:38:02,491 --> 01:38:06,990
Britain updates interest rates to
teens and attract people to the pound.

3467
01:38:06,991 --> 01:38:11,370
But speculate is George Soros among them
began heavily shorting the currency the

3468
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:13,920
British government gave
in and withdrew its erm,

3469
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:14,970
the erm,

3470
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:15,420
ah.

3471
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:18,180
As it became clear that it
was losing billions trying to,

3472
01:38:18,181 --> 01:38:18,630
boy,

3473
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:20,190
it's currency artificially,

3474
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,040
although was a bit of a
bitter pill to swallow,

3475
01:38:23,041 --> 01:38:27,520
the pound came back stronger because the
excess interest in high inflation show

3476
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:28,413
forced out of the bridge.

3477
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:30,580
As you go to investors pdf,

3478
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:31,530
it's the boss.

3479
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:31,861
Hold on.

3480
01:38:31,861 --> 01:38:32,111
He,

3481
01:38:32,111 --> 01:38:33,780
there's films about the Soros,

3482
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:34,570
Soros,

3483
01:38:34,570 --> 01:38:39,540
Soros pocketed $1 billion on the deal
and cemented his reputation as the

3484
01:38:39,541 --> 01:38:41,370
premiere currency speculator in the world.

3485
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:42,443
Now,

3486
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:44,640
if you're a currency speculator,

3487
01:38:44,641 --> 01:38:45,990
isn't that what you do though?

3488
01:38:46,410 --> 01:38:48,140
I don't know what a
currency speculator does it.

3489
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:49,290
I don't want to hear,

3490
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:50,253
here's the deal.

3491
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:54,840
George Soros works for the works for the
people that are on our government and

3492
01:38:54,841 --> 01:38:57,480
he's a guy willing to do it all
and he's been very successful.

3493
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:58,710
Okay.

3494
01:38:58,710 --> 01:39:01,920
My point is two plus
two equals four in my,

3495
01:39:01,921 --> 01:39:03,000
in my equation,

3496
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:07,410
you don't fight the Nazis
because you're 1314.

3497
01:39:07,411 --> 01:39:08,250
You think you can't,

3498
01:39:08,251 --> 01:39:09,570
you join them and he says,

3499
01:39:09,571 --> 01:39:11,040
he talked to me about investment.

3500
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:11,851
I I,

3501
01:39:11,851 --> 01:39:13,170
if I wouldn't have done it,

3502
01:39:13,171 --> 01:39:14,370
someone else would have done it.

3503
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:15,390
That's a quote.

3504
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:17,400
It was happy making dude.

3505
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:19,440
If you help roundup Jews
and take their property,

3506
01:39:19,441 --> 01:39:21,330
don't say it was happy making
you don't talk about it.

3507
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,220
So my point is him,

3508
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:23,820
you,

3509
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:24,151
you,

3510
01:39:24,151 --> 01:39:25,830
you think the way he describes it,

3511
01:39:25,831 --> 01:39:26,820
even as a problem,

3512
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:28,170
it's problematic.

3513
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:29,970
It disturbs you the way
he's describing that.

3514
01:39:29,971 --> 01:39:33,050
It was happy making that it was not a
big deal if I didn't do what other people

3515
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:33,660
have done it,

3516
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:34,493
that's a problem.

3517
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:39,090
What I'm telling you is I'm going
to get off in a Soros is that if you

3518
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:43,170
had five minutes over there on Jamie's
computer and he did a good job,

3519
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:43,951
Jamie does a great job.

3520
01:39:43,951 --> 01:39:44,431
I'm just saying it.

3521
01:39:44,431 --> 01:39:45,120
Pull stuff up.

3522
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:46,410
He's a goddamn Google wizard.

3523
01:39:46,411 --> 01:39:47,240
Look at them.

3524
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:49,740
Let Le has been beating me a quick too.

3525
01:39:49,741 --> 01:39:50,574
It's very frustrating.

3526
01:39:50,590 --> 01:39:51,930
I would have gone over there.

3527
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:53,670
I can pull up Soros.

3528
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,250
I can pull up the BBC reports.

3529
01:39:56,430 --> 01:39:58,410
Soros crashes the British pound or trash.

3530
01:39:58,680 --> 01:39:59,550
Here's an example,

3531
01:39:59,551 --> 01:40:00,900
and I'm not indicting you for this.

3532
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:02,693
Um,

3533
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:06,560
someone in my family about 10 years ago
was digging through stuff for basically

3534
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:07,900
garage hill wasn't a garage.

3535
01:40:07,901 --> 01:40:08,760
So we're going to give it away to,

3536
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:11,520
to charities and uh,

3537
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:11,701
you know,

3538
01:40:11,701 --> 01:40:12,361
all these clothes.

3539
01:40:12,361 --> 01:40:14,460
I couldn't wear it because I didn't
want to get 190 pounds anymore.

3540
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:20,120
And a family member got into a group of
things and there was a Japanese bayonet,

3541
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:25,050
there was a German officers dagger
that I bought for like 200 bucks.

3542
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:26,550
That's worth like 2000 hours,

3543
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,120
still have it.

3544
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:27,720
Wow.

3545
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:28,370
And,

3546
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:28,880
and,

3547
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:29,940
and all the rest of it.

3548
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:33,810
And there was a British metal and the
Nazi metal and this person in my family,

3549
01:40:33,811 --> 01:40:35,160
cause he's like a power thing goes,

3550
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:36,210
oh my God,

3551
01:40:36,211 --> 01:40:37,044
you're a Nazi.

3552
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:38,490
So I walk in,

3553
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:41,100
she's crunching the garage
and out of the box and I go,

3554
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:41,191
I,

3555
01:40:41,191 --> 01:40:44,940
I bought this at a gun
show like a decade ago.

3556
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:45,100
I,

3557
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:45,391
yeah.

3558
01:40:45,391 --> 01:40:49,020
I think a fricking swastika
metal thing though is if you own,

3559
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:49,651
this is the thing,

3560
01:40:49,651 --> 01:40:50,131
if you like,

3561
01:40:50,131 --> 01:40:53,120
see that helmet that
you were 12 point yeah.

3562
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,190
We show them helmet.

3563
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:55,023
That's what I'm a say,

3564
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:55,923
Joe.

3565
01:40:56,690 --> 01:40:57,491
You get to it,

3566
01:40:57,491 --> 01:41:01,210
so you've got a German helmet that have
Frisch artists dug up with all these

3567
01:41:01,211 --> 01:41:05,200
mass graves and it's got a German
band that you're not a fricking Nazi.

3568
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:06,460
That's a piece of history.

3569
01:41:06,490 --> 01:41:07,900
I think that's a US soldier.

3570
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:08,621
I don't know.

3571
01:41:08,621 --> 01:41:09,640
That's a German helmet.

3572
01:41:09,641 --> 01:41:10,690
That's a German helmet.

3573
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:11,583
That's a turtle,

3574
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:12,850
but it doesn't matter.

3575
01:41:12,851 --> 01:41:17,851
France has banned owning
German war memorabilia like
Sony and the coolest thing

3576
01:41:19,691 --> 01:41:21,400
I ever saw at the
Smithsonian when I was a kid,

3577
01:41:21,610 --> 01:41:25,030
so proud of us beating the Nazis was they
had a German helmet with a bullet hole

3578
01:41:25,031 --> 01:41:27,320
at the Smithsonian's not Nazi.

3579
01:41:27,530 --> 01:41:28,363
That's what I'm saying.

3580
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:32,860
I'm not Nazi for having a Nazi metal
and a bunch of other war paraphernalia I

3581
01:41:32,861 --> 01:41:33,694
thought was cool.

3582
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:37,270
You're not a Nazi for
a Nazi bayonet boats,

3583
01:41:37,271 --> 01:41:38,530
a helmet and a bayonet.

3584
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:40,900
What does the gentleman's name that
makes that Shit Shane Martin does.

3585
01:41:40,901 --> 01:41:41,810
Can we show it please?

3586
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:42,730
What is his,

3587
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:42,911
yeah,

3588
01:41:42,911 --> 01:41:43,660
we showed it.

3589
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:46,810
He also made me a
fucking super dope skull.

3590
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:49,870
He's got to read and not that
I'm saying is that artist,

3591
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:51,160
the German helmets.

3592
01:41:51,161 --> 01:41:51,760
Interesting.

3593
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:52,710
When I was going to say is,

3594
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:53,111
hey you,

3595
01:41:53,111 --> 01:41:56,710
you could have a Nazi helmet 20
year look about Hogan's heroes.

3596
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:59,470
Hogan's heroes was Goddamn
Sitcom about Nazis.

3597
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:03,070
It's a sitcom about Nazis
and prisoners of war.

3598
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:07,630
I mean that was Mexican directness
that I literally had a family member.

3599
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:09,770
This was like 18 years ago.

3600
01:42:09,771 --> 01:42:10,240
Go.

3601
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:12,790
I'm really upset about what I
found Shane against the machine,

3602
01:42:12,791 --> 01:42:13,090
right?

3603
01:42:13,090 --> 01:42:13,510
Yeah.

3604
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:18,280
Is that there in the garage and it's like
British metals USA metal's a couple of

3605
01:42:18,290 --> 01:42:18,970
dads.

3606
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:19,331
Of course.

3607
01:42:19,331 --> 01:42:21,940
I wanted the Japanese
thing that I even had it.

3608
01:42:21,941 --> 01:42:22,810
I remarried car.

3609
01:42:22,811 --> 01:42:23,644
Been for Vietnam.

3610
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:26,980
That's not as cool as World War II yet.

3611
01:42:26,981 --> 01:42:28,990
Go to Shane against the
machine on Instagram.

3612
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:31,240
He's not a Nazi.

3613
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:32,740
That's fricking cool,

3614
01:42:32,741 --> 01:42:33,574
man.

3615
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:35,200
He sells those folks.

3616
01:42:35,201 --> 01:42:37,270
If you want one about I'm to do a product,

3617
01:42:37,271 --> 01:42:38,104
plug us be plugging up.

3618
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:39,030
Dude.

3619
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:41,880
He made me a another sculpture
too that I bought from him.

3620
01:42:41,881 --> 01:42:42,340
He says,

3621
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:43,270
you know what I'm saying?

3622
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:46,000
I'm not saying you're a Nazi,

3623
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:50,920
but I had family think because
I had one Nazi party member.

3624
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:52,090
Metal.

3625
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:52,480
Yeah.

3626
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,380
It'll be on the news today.

3627
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:55,060
Joan's admits she has not changed.

3628
01:42:55,061 --> 01:42:55,660
Tough.

3629
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:56,140
No,

3630
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:57,290
it's fricking interesting,

3631
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:57,720
man.

3632
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:58,180
It is.

3633
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:00,820
This is from a battlefield
dug up of dead people.

3634
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:06,380
It couldn't be it more interesting and
you take darkness and light comes out of

3635
01:43:06,521 --> 01:43:06,641
it.

3636
01:43:06,641 --> 01:43:08,020
You make evil become good.

3637
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:08,390
I bet.

3638
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:09,250
Have you talked to the artists?

3639
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:09,521
God,

3640
01:43:09,521 --> 01:43:09,860
I'm doing it.

3641
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:10,561
Here's a plug for them like,

3642
01:43:10,561 --> 01:43:10,720
oh,

3643
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,830
this guy doesn't know shit.

3644
01:43:11,831 --> 01:43:12,760
Look at this guy's stuff.

3645
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:13,631
Look at that Eagle.

3646
01:43:13,631 --> 01:43:14,291
Go back to that.

3647
01:43:14,291 --> 01:43:17,410
A bird with the fucking
cylinders with the cars.

3648
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:21,160
Is that what it is for [inaudible] or
the band at the top of his shoulders.

3649
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:23,620
The top of his shoulders
is a car cylinder.

3650
01:43:23,621 --> 01:43:24,431
That's a car cylinder.

3651
01:43:24,431 --> 01:43:24,880
Yeah.

3652
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,610
That's a Polish town car cylinder and
then bayonets for the wedding in product

3653
01:43:28,611 --> 01:43:31,790
placement because they're trying to
shut me down in front of store icon of a

3654
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:32,643
product.

3655
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:35,201
Artists.

3656
01:43:35,201 --> 01:43:35,501
Ben,

3657
01:43:35,501 --> 01:43:36,191
he's a great art.

3658
01:43:36,191 --> 01:43:39,550
I brought this up because I walked
in here and I shed God stope.

3659
01:43:39,551 --> 01:43:40,810
That is amazing.

3660
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:41,630
And,

3661
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:42,820
and it took,

3662
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:43,691
you told him the story,

3663
01:43:43,691 --> 01:43:44,340
like they dig up,

3664
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:46,000
I know these battlefields
and France stuff with,

3665
01:43:46,410 --> 01:43:49,840
and then people get this stuff
that is rotting German helmet.

3666
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:53,750
You put light and it makes it beautiful
and it takes the evil of Hitler and

3667
01:43:53,751 --> 01:43:54,584
makes it beautiful.

3668
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:57,350
Not Hitler takes humanity
and makes it beautiful.

3669
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:58,010
Yeah,

3670
01:43:58,010 --> 01:43:58,670
it's a,

3671
01:43:58,670 --> 01:43:58,971
but,

3672
01:43:58,971 --> 01:44:01,940
but it is interesting that you can't own,

3673
01:44:01,941 --> 01:44:04,910
like you could never own a Nazi flag or,

3674
01:44:04,911 --> 01:44:05,360
uh,

3675
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:09,410
any like you could
[inaudible] here's the thing.

3676
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:11,870
Both my grandfathers and
not brag about family,

3677
01:44:11,871 --> 01:44:12,890
but remember Tom Landry,

3678
01:44:13,190 --> 01:44:14,870
my grandfather was a ut football,

3679
01:44:14,871 --> 01:44:17,840
won state championships and
track all at my mom's dad.

3680
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:20,330
And he went in the army
air corps with Tom Landry.

3681
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:22,250
Remember being over there on Sundays,

3682
01:44:22,251 --> 01:44:22,341
he,

3683
01:44:22,341 --> 01:44:23,470
before he played for the Dallas cowboys,

3684
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:24,221
he'd like Tom,

3685
01:44:24,221 --> 01:44:24,560
I recall.

3686
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:25,520
And they pray for five minutes,

3687
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:29,600
both my grandfathers
about Jerry Jones and,

3688
01:44:29,601 --> 01:44:29,811
and,

3689
01:44:29,811 --> 01:44:30,061
and,

3690
01:44:30,061 --> 01:44:30,301
and,

3691
01:44:30,301 --> 01:44:30,650
and,

3692
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:31,330
and I,

3693
01:44:31,330 --> 01:44:32,163
you know,

3694
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:34,040
my mother's father,

3695
01:44:34,041 --> 01:44:34,874
Mr. Hammond,

3696
01:44:34,990 --> 01:44:37,340
we almost died in a crash landing.

3697
01:44:37,341 --> 01:44:38,174
And another deal,

3698
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:40,100
I almost died.

3699
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:44,090
I don't almost exist because my
family America fought Hitler.

3700
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:48,980
And then now I'm a Nazi because I believe
in the second amendment and I believe

3701
01:44:48,981 --> 01:44:49,581
in America.

3702
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:50,510
That's not fair.

3703
01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:52,000
Well that's not what they're saying.

3704
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:54,590
They're saying because you had
a Nazi piece of memorabilia,

3705
01:44:54,591 --> 01:44:55,940
but it still doesn't make any sense.

3706
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,033
It doesn't make any sense.

3707
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:57,501
Look,

3708
01:44:57,501 --> 01:45:02,330
if I saw some cool Nazi thing at
a some place where I could buy it,

3709
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:05,090
I might buy it and frame it cause
it's just a piece of history.

3710
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:06,020
Just like I would buy a,

3711
01:45:06,021 --> 01:45:08,750
a Gingiss con dagger or a helmet.

3712
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:09,381
Oh my God.

3713
01:45:09,381 --> 01:45:10,250
Eddie Bravo's here.

3714
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:12,080
Jesus Christ.

3715
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:18,950
We're having a great time talking
about a two dimensional beans,

3716
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:20,690
bro.

3717
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:21,770
Choke you out with this shirt.

3718
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:26,300
Nassa I'm gonna make you regret wearing
this fucking shirt and listened to high

3719
01:45:26,301 --> 01:45:26,691
school.

3720
01:45:26,691 --> 01:45:27,830
We used to choke each other out.

3721
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:28,790
That's like a thing of teacher.

3722
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:29,800
Go ahead and drop me off on it.

3723
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:30,131
No,

3724
01:45:30,131 --> 01:45:30,311
no,

3725
01:45:30,311 --> 01:45:30,511
no,

3726
01:45:30,511 --> 01:45:30,691
no,

3727
01:45:30,691 --> 01:45:30,861
no.

3728
01:45:30,861 --> 01:45:31,694
Please don't.

3729
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:33,080
Please don't.

3730
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:33,531
I'm not scared.

3731
01:45:33,531 --> 01:45:33,890
Let's go ahead.

3732
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:34,101
No,

3733
01:45:34,101 --> 01:45:34,251
no,

3734
01:45:34,251 --> 01:45:34,461
no.

3735
01:45:34,461 --> 01:45:35,070
Eddie don't.

3736
01:45:35,070 --> 01:45:36,320
Please don't choke them unconscious.

3737
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:37,820
So now let's go.

3738
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:38,923
He can't do it.

3739
01:45:39,430 --> 01:45:39,650
You know,

3740
01:45:39,650 --> 01:45:40,700
you think I'm afraid of this.

3741
01:45:40,701 --> 01:45:40,890
Let's,

3742
01:45:40,890 --> 01:45:41,240
no,

3743
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:43,280
I definitely don't think
you're afraid of this,

3744
01:45:43,281 --> 01:45:44,540
which is why I don't want them to do it.

3745
01:45:46,510 --> 01:45:47,560
Choked me up.

3746
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:50,083
You know what?

3747
01:45:50,690 --> 01:45:51,710
Let me tell you a story first.

3748
01:45:51,711 --> 01:45:52,550
Let me tell you a story first.

3749
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:54,470
Back when I used to
work at the Strip club,

3750
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:55,250
you're the one,

3751
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:56,510
hold on Alex.

3752
01:45:56,510 --> 01:45:57,231
Sit down please.

3753
01:45:57,231 --> 01:45:58,190
Come on please.

3754
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:00,360
We have to work together here.

3755
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:01,220
Let's work together.

3756
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:02,053
Come sit down.

3757
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:04,310
I'm not getting good luck and yeah,

3758
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:06,103
have a seat.

3759
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:07,850
Have a seat or choke me out.

3760
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:08,743
Alex,

3761
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:11,180
please have weak high school.

3762
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:12,110
I know you did.

3763
01:46:12,111 --> 01:46:14,780
You told me he grabbed each other
and you fall down and hit your heads.

3764
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:16,130
It only takes like 20 seconds.

3765
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:17,630
We'll you're going to
say about strip club.

3766
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,150
Back when I was a blue belt,

3767
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,160
1995,

3768
01:46:22,850 --> 01:46:23,990
I worked at a strip club and,

3769
01:46:23,991 --> 01:46:24,824
and um,

3770
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,840
there was this girl I was dating.

3771
01:46:26,841 --> 01:46:29,390
She never had any of those
know she was a bartender.

3772
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:31,580
She was seriously four foot 10.

3773
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:34,610
And why are the bartenders and waitresses
is always the best way to go to strip

3774
01:46:34,611 --> 01:46:34,910
clubs?

3775
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:35,950
I don't know how you got to let them.

3776
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:37,003
I will.

3777
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:37,880
She was,

3778
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:41,600
she was 92 pounds bartender,

3779
01:46:41,601 --> 01:46:42,840
the smallest girl.

3780
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:44,810
And I showed her how to
do a rear naked choke.

3781
01:46:44,811 --> 01:46:46,700
She was tiny.

3782
01:46:46,701 --> 01:46:47,534
Her name was Kimmy.

3783
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:50,100
And the Strip club manager

3784
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,630
was your size.

3785
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:55,500
Big like used to be BOF butt fat ass.

3786
01:46:55,530 --> 01:46:55,860
Yeah,

3787
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:56,491
but used to be,

3788
01:46:56,491 --> 01:46:58,830
but you can tell you used to
be buff football player type,

3789
01:46:58,831 --> 01:46:59,970
big manager.

3790
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:00,421
You know,

3791
01:47:00,421 --> 01:47:02,130
you want those guys
that manage strip clubs,

3792
01:47:02,131 --> 01:47:02,401
you know,

3793
01:47:02,401 --> 01:47:03,960
intimidating looking big dudes.

3794
01:47:04,410 --> 01:47:08,010
And he had a corvette and he
didn't believe in Jujitsu at all.

3795
01:47:08,490 --> 01:47:09,830
And she said,

3796
01:47:09,831 --> 01:47:09,990
uh,

3797
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:13,590
he said if she could choke
me out with one of them,

3798
01:47:13,591 --> 01:47:15,150
Jujitsu moves out,

3799
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:17,090
give her the keys to my car.

3800
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:23,250
So she had to literally get on a bar
stool and she was standing on a bar stool

3801
01:47:23,251 --> 01:47:23,971
and had to go around them.

3802
01:47:23,971 --> 01:47:26,310
And she went like this
and he was just like this.

3803
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:29,700
And then he went out,

3804
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:30,720
lights out,

3805
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:32,880
he dropped like a sack of potatoes.

3806
01:47:32,910 --> 01:47:37,910
He hit his head on the fucking floor and
impact the impact of his head hitting

3807
01:47:39,001 --> 01:47:39,510
the floor.

3808
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:43,410
Woke his ass up and so we hit the
ground and then he pops back up

3809
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:45,850
and he didn't know,

3810
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:47,100
look happened and was just sitting there.

3811
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:50,730
I thought he faked it.

3812
01:47:50,990 --> 01:47:51,730
That's what I'm getting.

3813
01:47:51,730 --> 01:47:52,070
I'm like,

3814
01:47:52,070 --> 01:47:54,570
people usually don't kick
the ground pop back up.

3815
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:55,770
Usually they hit the ground,

3816
01:47:55,771 --> 01:47:57,390
they're done and they need an ambulance,

3817
01:47:57,810 --> 01:47:59,730
but he popped right back up and he's like,

3818
01:47:59,731 --> 01:48:00,430
what happened?

3819
01:48:00,430 --> 01:48:00,961
Like bitch,

3820
01:48:00,961 --> 01:48:02,200
you need to give her your core value.

3821
01:48:02,201 --> 01:48:03,034
I'll pop right back up.

3822
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:03,581
It was a,

3823
01:48:03,581 --> 01:48:05,340
it was a corvette.

3824
01:48:05,341 --> 01:48:05,470
Oh,

3825
01:48:05,470 --> 01:48:07,340
this was a thing I know about this,

3826
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:08,430
about in seventh grade.

3827
01:48:08,431 --> 01:48:09,264
During lunch,

3828
01:48:10,170 --> 01:48:11,340
kids would choke each other out.

3829
01:48:11,341 --> 01:48:12,600
You put your hands up on her neck.

3830
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:13,531
Kids don't do this.

3831
01:48:13,531 --> 01:48:16,130
I'm not teaching like
Tom died box doing this,

3832
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:19,980
but then it'd be like the cheerleader
is wanting to be choked up and then they

3833
01:48:19,981 --> 01:48:20,611
would show us out.

3834
01:48:20,611 --> 01:48:21,444
I probably did it about three.

3835
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:23,070
Did you go to school?

3836
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:27,480
Go to school where the bill hooks go to?

3837
01:48:27,490 --> 01:48:28,321
He's not bill Hicks,

3838
01:48:28,321 --> 01:48:29,640
but right now we already went over this,

3839
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:31,410
that this guy's talking about this,

3840
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:36,440
you know the crazy him is you can put
together a case where you fucking,

3841
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:39,520
you can wave.

3842
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:46,150
Bill Hicks live known Alex since
just a few years after bullies.

3843
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:50,520
All you got to see his old way differs
a bunch of old for a separation because

3844
01:48:50,521 --> 01:48:52,110
you and I worked with
somebody that worked with him.

3845
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:53,220
When you work with thousands of people,

3846
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:54,660
suddenly it's like,

3847
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:54,991
oh,

3848
01:48:54,991 --> 01:48:55,990
we do the same person.

3849
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,220
It's such overrode all you gotta do is
just show those pictures of you like at

3850
01:48:59,221 --> 01:49:00,700
10 only this off.

3851
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:01,261
I'm like,

3852
01:49:01,261 --> 01:49:03,240
Bill Hicks is never 20 and yoke.

3853
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:04,900
You are jacked.

3854
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:06,990
You were like a bodybuilder
and I used to run like,

3855
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:07,910
I think it's,

3856
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:08,970
I wish I get in that zone again.

3857
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:12,930
You can have gotten this young where
I ran six miles every other day and I

3858
01:49:12,931 --> 01:49:13,500
lifted weights.

3859
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:13,921
Should people go,

3860
01:49:13,921 --> 01:49:14,131
dude,

3861
01:49:14,131 --> 01:49:15,480
you'd be bigger if you
can work out three hours.

3862
01:49:15,481 --> 01:49:19,710
I was addicted and then I got on radio
and TV and like try to drinking and just

3863
01:49:19,711 --> 01:49:21,630
stopped and it didn't work
out for like 10 years,

3864
01:49:21,631 --> 01:49:22,770
getting like a hundred pounds.

3865
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:23,550
Alex,

3866
01:49:23,550 --> 01:49:23,881
let's,

3867
01:49:23,881 --> 01:49:27,690
let's get you on something where we
actually like put it online and to talk

3868
01:49:27,691 --> 01:49:28,530
about what you're doing.

3869
01:49:28,531 --> 01:49:30,810
If you commit to something
online like that,

3870
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:31,793
you'll do it.

3871
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:34,500
All you have to do is
like set a realistic goal.

3872
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:39,500
I used to do 40 pull ups and I can do
like two 40 in a row like crossfit type

3873
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:41,430
bullets or use your whole
body and everything where you,

3874
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:42,181
that's amazing.

3875
01:49:42,181 --> 01:49:44,040
You're like doing the
worm when she amazing.

3876
01:49:44,130 --> 01:49:48,250
But the problem was I used to go to all
you can eat buffets that's amazing to

3877
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:49,740
Chinese and uh,

3878
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:52,660
I don't believe and and regular and
the problem was I would literally like

3879
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:53,590
order.

3880
01:49:53,590 --> 01:49:53,831
I go,

3881
01:49:53,831 --> 01:49:53,981
no,

3882
01:49:53,981 --> 01:49:55,510
I don't want the two of
you think about this.

3883
01:49:55,511 --> 01:49:58,840
What do you think about a self
improvement thing that you do online?

3884
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:00,340
We do it online.

3885
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:00,941
I need to do it.

3886
01:50:00,941 --> 01:50:02,260
The problem is every
time I tried to work out,

3887
01:50:02,261 --> 01:50:03,460
the phone's ringing and it's like,

3888
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:04,180
Oh shit,

3889
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:04,721
let's listen.

3890
01:50:04,721 --> 01:50:05,950
You just get up earlier.

3891
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:07,170
Get up an hour and a half for,

3892
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:08,710
for my torn bicep.

3893
01:50:08,830 --> 01:50:08,951
Well,

3894
01:50:08,951 --> 01:50:11,350
once you have surgery for your
bicep and everything gets fixed,

3895
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,240
I think once you get your bicep torn,

3896
01:50:13,241 --> 01:50:14,980
you're probably going to be
a little bit out of action.

3897
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:16,840
But that's only six months.

3898
01:50:16,841 --> 01:50:17,111
No,

3899
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:17,860
you know what?

3900
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:19,330
I'm Novitsky had it done.

3901
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:20,410
It's fucking amazing.

3902
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:21,580
I had my bicep done,

3903
01:50:21,581 --> 01:50:24,150
but to the shoulder or
to the bicentennial,

3904
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:24,790
like this,

3905
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:26,440
to the elbow to the shoulder.

3906
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:28,550
Different.

3907
01:50:28,550 --> 01:50:28,721
No,

3908
01:50:28,721 --> 01:50:28,781
no,

3909
01:50:28,781 --> 01:50:29,170
no.

3910
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:30,003
You have to do,

3911
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,010
we're talking fricking autozone of years.

3912
01:50:33,010 --> 01:50:33,470
Number one.

3913
01:50:33,470 --> 01:50:33,630
No,

3914
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:33,810
no,

3915
01:50:33,810 --> 01:50:34,021
no,

3916
01:50:34,021 --> 01:50:34,250
no,

3917
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:34,580
no,

3918
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:35,413
no,

3919
01:50:36,230 --> 01:50:36,441
no,

3920
01:50:36,441 --> 01:50:36,650
no.

3921
01:50:36,650 --> 01:50:38,880
There's no need to choke you
or tried to sue me and shit.

3922
01:50:38,890 --> 01:50:39,850
This is one of the first things.

3923
01:50:41,470 --> 01:50:42,303
Once we,

3924
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:43,930
once we made up on the phone,

3925
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:45,160
one of the first things
he wanted me to do,

3926
01:50:45,161 --> 01:50:46,010
his choke him out on the air.

3927
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:48,280
You might need to go to them.

3928
01:50:48,281 --> 01:50:49,090
SMM,

3929
01:50:49,090 --> 01:50:49,391
those,

3930
01:50:49,391 --> 01:50:49,610
uh,

3931
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:53,290
those SNM pain dungeon choked out.

3932
01:50:53,291 --> 01:50:56,080
You'd like go somewhere and I've got a
little dream and then you come around

3933
01:50:56,081 --> 01:50:56,380
back.

3934
01:50:56,380 --> 01:50:57,213
DMT.

3935
01:50:57,450 --> 01:50:58,300
You hate that shit.

3936
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,840
James is on point as well.

3937
01:50:59,860 --> 01:51:00,693
Let's get serious.

3938
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:03,010
Let's get Siri just share a few
things before he goes down this road.

3939
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:03,903
Okay.

3940
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:04,850
These are the,

3941
01:51:04,850 --> 01:51:06,850
what are the rope but
going down I'll roll.

3942
01:51:06,851 --> 01:51:08,550
We just talking about we
know what the road is.

3943
01:51:08,551 --> 01:51:09,820
They're talking about George Soros.

3944
01:51:09,850 --> 01:51:10,011
No,

3945
01:51:10,011 --> 01:51:10,090
no,

3946
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:10,181
no.

3947
01:51:10,181 --> 01:51:11,014
We past that.

3948
01:51:11,150 --> 01:51:12,430
What we just talked to him about,

3949
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:13,990
uh,

3950
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:15,370
you were talking about the Strip club.

3951
01:51:15,370 --> 01:51:16,460
The guy choke at the girl,

3952
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:17,530
the girl truck with the guy out,

3953
01:51:17,531 --> 01:51:20,620
the guy falling and hitting his head
and then what happened after that?

3954
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:21,833
Any ideas?

3955
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:22,540
Jamie?

3956
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:22,900
No one.

3957
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:24,150
Everyone's stupid for that.

3958
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:26,770
I got choked out.

3959
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:28,140
I remember watching the babies.

3960
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:30,300
I remember what it was.

3961
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:30,970
It was cool.

3962
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:33,670
I don't think I've ever been choked
completely out of 40 for a second.

3963
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:38,680
The first time I got chucked out was like
this 17 year old super hot chick and I

3964
01:51:38,681 --> 01:51:41,710
was like 13 tied up and
she lived down the street.

3965
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:41,861
No,

3966
01:51:41,861 --> 01:51:42,100
no.

3967
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:42,933
She goes,

3968
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:43,880
I already,

3969
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:44,710
I got permission.

3970
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:46,480
I was pretty young like 12 and she goes,

3971
01:51:46,481 --> 01:51:47,620
I'll have sex with you.

3972
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:48,723
It was a true story.

3973
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:52,600
I'll have sex with you if you let me put
makeup on it so I'm not in the gates.

3974
01:51:52,601 --> 01:51:57,220
Everything show the girl puts the makeup
on it and have sex with her and she's

3975
01:51:57,221 --> 01:51:59,260
super hot and then like
a week later she goes,

3976
01:51:59,570 --> 01:52:01,030
now I'm going to choke you out.

3977
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:06,460
And that relationship went really well
until I'm like 30 year old boyfriend

3978
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:09,310
caught me at her place once
cause her mom was hers working.

3979
01:52:09,410 --> 01:52:11,110
Oh my tried to kill me in the parking lot.

3980
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:12,153
Oh my God,

3981
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:13,560
I have sex with him.

3982
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:14,860
I can put makeup on you.

3983
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:17,650
I let her deal.

3984
01:52:18,510 --> 01:52:18,841
Listen,

3985
01:52:18,841 --> 01:52:19,780
you're a wise man.

3986
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:20,350
She can.

3987
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:21,790
That bitch can dress me up like a clown.

3988
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:24,543
Anyway,

3989
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:28,300
here's some of the things I have
and then we'd get to go forever.

3990
01:52:28,301 --> 01:52:29,134
Here he goes.

3991
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:33,190
Not conspiracies,

3992
01:52:33,191 --> 01:52:34,570
but real world programs.

3993
01:52:34,571 --> 01:52:36,460
Developing a breakaway civilization.

3994
01:52:36,461 --> 01:52:37,720
What does a breakaway civilization?

3995
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:39,820
You understand that it's
the key to everything.

3996
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:41,020
Uh,

3997
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:41,831
standardized.

3998
01:52:41,831 --> 01:52:42,760
Total surveillance.

3999
01:52:42,761 --> 01:52:43,594
Control Grid,

4000
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:44,201
the power.

4001
01:52:44,201 --> 01:52:45,320
Despise the power control.

4002
01:52:45,321 --> 01:52:46,160
Human animal hybrids.

4003
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:48,500
We recover that mass
farming of humanoid tissue.

4004
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,730
Transhuman endgame.

4005
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:52,490
We covered multilayered binary
weapon delivery systems.

4006
01:52:52,491 --> 01:52:53,324
That's when we haven't had,

4007
01:52:53,390 --> 01:52:54,380
oh what's that?

4008
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:56,030
Well we'll get into some of that.

4009
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:58,280
The pain is five g
behavioral modifications.

4010
01:52:58,281 --> 01:53:00,810
We hit that Trojan horse delivery system,

4011
01:53:00,811 --> 01:53:01,341
cell phones,

4012
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:02,150
vaccines.

4013
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:04,220
Gmos have been tested
and designed to hurt you.

4014
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:04,820
Again,

4015
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:06,080
vaccines are real.

4016
01:53:06,170 --> 01:53:09,260
You can give somebody something that gives
them the cure to another disease that

4017
01:53:09,261 --> 01:53:09,771
didn't look yet,

4018
01:53:09,771 --> 01:53:11,810
but they're jacking it like a cell phone.

4019
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:14,680
They're adding stuff in
your ticket to immortality.

4020
01:53:15,090 --> 01:53:15,680
We think so.

4021
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:16,520
Let's cover that.

4022
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:18,080
What do you think is
happening with vaccines?

4023
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:19,040
I know,

4024
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:19,341
okay,

4025
01:53:19,341 --> 01:53:20,174
tell me what's going on.

4026
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:22,580
I always use this cause
everyone's heard of it.

4027
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:28,270
Everyone heard about 1947 to 1983 and
only came public because the program was

4028
01:53:31,161 --> 01:53:34,640
exposed in Peru and promote
close in West Virginia.

4029
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:36,680
But the media picked up
cause it was white on black,

4030
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:38,540
not all the white people that happened to,

4031
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:39,620
I don't care if you're black or white,

4032
01:53:40,130 --> 01:53:45,130
injecting over a million people with
live syphilis in the name of vaccines.

4033
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:46,663
You know about Tuskegee.

4034
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:48,080
Do know about that,

4035
01:53:48,470 --> 01:53:52,970
but you only know about Alabama and
over 40 something years only injecting

4036
01:53:52,971 --> 01:53:53,804
blacks,

4037
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:56,870
but it happened all the
world search engine.

4038
01:53:57,170 --> 01:54:02,170
Hillary Clinton apologizes for
syphilis experiments in Tuskegee.

4039
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:04,450
There was this Gig,

4040
01:54:04,450 --> 01:54:04,760
it was,

4041
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:05,630
it was in Peru.

4042
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:06,231
Can I ask you,

4043
01:54:06,231 --> 01:54:08,240
this was the Tuskegee was the,

4044
01:54:08,270 --> 01:54:09,103
um,

4045
01:54:09,350 --> 01:54:14,350
the conventional story that they had
syphilis but they weren't really curing

4046
01:54:14,481 --> 01:54:14,870
them.

4047
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:15,680
That's a cover.

4048
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:15,980
No,

4049
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:17,750
but it's not what they say
if you actually read it.

4050
01:54:17,751 --> 01:54:17,871
No,

4051
01:54:17,871 --> 01:54:18,860
they were giving him selfless.

4052
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:20,000
Okay.

4053
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,050
I understand what you're saying.

4054
01:54:21,051 --> 01:54:22,060
But was the,

4055
01:54:22,130 --> 01:54:22,880
the,

4056
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:26,570
the conventional explanation
of what happened was that,

4057
01:54:26,571 --> 01:54:29,250
that they knew that they had
it and they allowed them to,

4058
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:30,980
that was the [inaudible] came out.

4059
01:54:30,981 --> 01:54:31,340
Okay.

4060
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:33,560
Have you heard about
hearing his right there?

4061
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:35,780
US apologizes for Guatemala,

4062
01:54:35,781 --> 01:54:36,880
STD experiences.

4063
01:54:38,130 --> 01:54:39,390
They did all of the different ones.

4064
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:40,530
Just type her ruin medic.

4065
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:41,270
Hold on.

4066
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:42,090
Gift in this.

4067
01:54:42,090 --> 01:54:44,510
What do you make that a little
go scroll up so I can read it.

4068
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:46,130
A US government,

4069
01:54:46,131 --> 01:54:49,820
medical researchers intentionally
infected hundreds of people in Guatemala,

4070
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:54,850
including institutionalized
mental patients with
gonorrhea and syphilis without

4071
01:54:56,181 --> 01:54:58,190
their knowledge or permission.

4072
01:54:58,370 --> 01:54:59,720
More than 60 years ago.

4073
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:01,610
Jesus Christ.

4074
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:03,500
Show Joe again.

4075
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:04,280
Um,

4076
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:05,240
when you've read,

4077
01:55:05,241 --> 01:55:06,060
cause what I do is,

4078
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:06,980
oh Jesus Christ,

4079
01:55:06,981 --> 01:55:07,580
look at this.

4080
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:09,200
Many of those infected,

4081
01:55:09,201 --> 01:55:13,430
we're encouraged to pass the infection
is usually managers as part of the study.

4082
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:14,420
Where does this end?

4083
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:17,310
What is QMS is NBC News.

4084
01:55:17,330 --> 01:55:19,220
Imagine finding how you have syphilis,

4085
01:55:19,221 --> 01:55:20,600
but you've never had sex before.

4086
01:55:20,670 --> 01:55:21,350
Let me stop.

4087
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:21,570
Let me,

4088
01:55:21,570 --> 01:55:22,380
Shaw's is gone.

4089
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:26,300
You imagine how confusing you ready for
another ultra secret since this 46 to

4090
01:55:26,301 --> 01:55:26,990
what?

4091
01:55:26,990 --> 01:55:27,880
46 to,

4092
01:55:28,290 --> 01:55:29,123
sorry,

4093
01:55:29,250 --> 01:55:30,050
it says it at the bottom.

4094
01:55:30,050 --> 01:55:33,770
46 to 1948 God damn.

4095
01:55:33,771 --> 01:55:34,880
946 months.

4096
01:55:34,881 --> 01:55:35,501
That's all I watched.

4097
01:55:35,501 --> 01:55:36,334
That's not okay.

4098
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:37,101
It's not two years.

4099
01:55:37,101 --> 01:55:37,460
Okay,

4100
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:37,670
so,

4101
01:55:37,670 --> 01:55:37,851
so,

4102
01:55:37,851 --> 01:55:38,684
so let me expand

4103
01:55:40,110 --> 01:55:40,340
then.

4104
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:41,300
Imagine Joe,

4105
01:55:42,410 --> 01:55:43,243
here's what's happened.

4106
01:55:43,410 --> 01:55:43,830
Okay.

4107
01:55:43,830 --> 01:55:44,040
We

4108
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,650
had a real liberal media in this country.

4109
01:55:46,651 --> 01:55:47,321
They weren't left us.

4110
01:55:47,321 --> 01:55:47,521
That's,

4111
01:55:47,521 --> 01:55:48,271
that's a cultic.

4112
01:55:48,271 --> 01:55:48,990
That's different.

4113
01:55:48,990 --> 01:55:51,180
We had a real liberal media in
this country that had problems,

4114
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:52,650
but they really cared.

4115
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:53,760
They were open minded.

4116
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:54,811
Like I said,

4117
01:55:54,811 --> 01:55:55,890
Delta has done information.

4118
01:55:55,891 --> 01:56:00,150
A few years after I proved Delta force
was in Seattle on and on and 99 and

4119
01:56:00,151 --> 01:56:00,451
proved it.

4120
01:56:00,451 --> 01:56:00,931
They all said,

4121
01:56:00,931 --> 01:56:01,770
Alex Jones is ride.

4122
01:56:01,771 --> 01:56:02,310
It's incredible.

4123
01:56:02,310 --> 01:56:05,840
That's the WTO tape that I always
cite that tight that we showed.

4124
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:09,540
The agent provocateurs went into a
peaceful protest and started smashing

4125
01:56:09,541 --> 01:56:09,991
windows,

4126
01:56:09,991 --> 01:56:10,890
and I'm not against the army,

4127
01:56:10,891 --> 01:56:12,650
but Delta force ran it
because I always go,

4128
01:56:12,651 --> 01:56:12,801
oh,

4129
01:56:12,801 --> 01:56:13,890
do the army's terrorist.

4130
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:14,390
Like you said,

4131
01:56:14,390 --> 01:56:17,370
don't call it the whole garden in a
select group of the army did that.

4132
01:56:17,371 --> 01:56:18,204
They staged it.

4133
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:18,691
Show.

4134
01:56:18,691 --> 01:56:20,230
Imagine used to the Ma.

4135
01:56:20,270 --> 01:56:22,470
The press would get a lot of stuff right,

4136
01:56:22,710 --> 01:56:24,240
but they would get demoted or whatever.

4137
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:27,750
What happened once Trump got in,

4138
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:30,000
which I don't think Trump's pad
and it got level things are good,

4139
01:56:30,001 --> 01:56:32,040
but I almost think light,

4140
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:33,000
it's more sophisticated.

4141
01:56:33,001 --> 01:56:33,834
They put him in on it,

4142
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:37,350
piss everybody off to get the liberals
who traditionally have been the real

4143
01:56:37,351 --> 01:56:41,220
watchdogs for free speech and it gets
human experimentation and suddenly they're

4144
01:56:41,221 --> 01:56:42,150
like in Gallup polls,

4145
01:56:42,151 --> 01:56:42,960
we love war.

4146
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:44,130
We love experimentation.

4147
01:56:44,131 --> 01:56:45,000
We love everything.

4148
01:56:45,150 --> 01:56:46,110
I'm getting chills right now.

4149
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:47,670
And so imagine Joe,

4150
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:51,000
I've been on air for 23
years and I'm a news hound.

4151
01:56:51,001 --> 01:56:51,520
I spend four,

4152
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:56,280
five hours a day reading news leave
NBC News that there are government gave

4153
01:56:56,281 --> 01:56:57,114
people.

4154
01:56:57,690 --> 01:57:00,660
Notice I said Peru because
that was a big document,

4155
01:57:00,661 --> 01:57:01,980
a case you just found Guatemala.

4156
01:57:02,690 --> 01:57:03,461
Keep track of this.

4157
01:57:03,461 --> 01:57:07,200
We'll just stop it everywhere it went
under the age it's still going on.

4158
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:08,250
So imagine,

4159
01:57:08,890 --> 01:57:13,470
imagine I have literally by
the time Sandy Hook happens,

4160
01:57:13,471 --> 01:57:18,471
I've literally seen 10,000 articles
and documents are more where they're

4161
01:57:18,631 --> 01:57:19,464
admitting.

4162
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:24,500
In 1962 the joint chiefs of staff under
LLM answer came to president at Kennedy.

4163
01:57:24,661 --> 01:57:26,490
This is on PBS and said,

4164
01:57:26,491 --> 01:57:28,080
we're going to blow up buildings,

4165
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:32,880
shoot up schools and movie theaters
and bomb army bases and marine basis.

4166
01:57:33,630 --> 01:57:37,860
We're going to have people with their
kids with name change their CIA get on a

4167
01:57:37,861 --> 01:57:38,641
jumbo jet,

4168
01:57:38,641 --> 01:57:39,720
the texts off.

4169
01:57:40,410 --> 01:57:42,080
It gets blown up over the Caribbean.

4170
01:57:42,090 --> 01:57:43,350
We blame Cuba,

4171
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:47,940
but that plane really lands and
there's another plane that's a drone.

4172
01:57:47,941 --> 01:57:50,070
We blow up and then Kennedy says,

4173
01:57:50,071 --> 01:57:50,341
no,

4174
01:57:50,341 --> 01:57:51,151
but his brother says,

4175
01:57:51,151 --> 01:57:51,780
no,

4176
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:52,360
I'll do.

4177
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:55,170
It's why they killed Kennedy
because Bobby said he would,

4178
01:57:55,171 --> 01:57:57,540
but then he got pissed when they
killed his brother sold the classified.

4179
01:57:57,690 --> 01:58:02,690
He wanted to bomb the Honduran embassy
and blow up stuff and go to war with

4180
01:58:03,031 --> 01:58:03,864
Moscow.

4181
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:05,250
Bobby was bad.

4182
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:06,211
You could actually,

4183
01:58:06,211 --> 01:58:07,230
this is pull this up,

4184
01:58:07,231 --> 01:58:07,770
pull up.

4185
01:58:07,770 --> 01:58:11,100
Bobby Kennedy wanted to bomb
the u s embassy in Honduras.

4186
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:13,200
This is declassified.

4187
01:58:13,530 --> 01:58:18,530
And so imagine you see hundreds of these
and then a sandy hook happens and your

4188
01:58:18,871 --> 01:58:22,320
listeners don't buy it and then
it just psychosis where then,

4189
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:23,521
well,

4190
01:58:23,521 --> 01:58:24,360
because every,

4191
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:25,410
every man I knew,

4192
01:58:25,650 --> 01:58:26,540
this is hypothetical it.

4193
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,270
That was great.

4194
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:30,750
Every man I knew when I was a kid
backhanded me and beat the crap out of me.

4195
01:58:30,751 --> 01:58:32,700
So men are bad or a woman has been raped.

4196
01:58:32,910 --> 01:58:33,743
She thinks all men are bad.

4197
01:58:33,890 --> 01:58:34,710
She'll eat.

4198
01:58:34,710 --> 01:58:37,860
I get like the psychosis and I'm not
trying to put myself down like I'm a

4199
01:58:37,861 --> 01:58:38,430
victim.

4200
01:58:38,430 --> 01:58:39,241
I'm being honest.

4201
01:58:39,241 --> 01:58:40,200
Retrospectively,

4202
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:42,310
that got to where when I learned

4203
01:58:42,610 --> 01:58:44,050
that so much stuff was false.

4204
01:58:44,110 --> 01:58:48,250
Then later I experienced
where I had the guest.

4205
01:58:48,251 --> 01:58:49,090
I did the thing,

4206
01:58:49,091 --> 01:58:53,350
I knew it was true and then people made
up a whole story because they don't

4207
01:58:53,351 --> 01:58:54,280
believe anything anymore.

4208
01:58:54,550 --> 01:58:55,870
So that's all I'm trying to say.

4209
01:58:56,140 --> 01:58:59,200
Do you think part of it is that
even though this stuff does exist,

4210
01:58:59,201 --> 01:59:02,440
it's almost like there's too many
things happening for one person to pay

4211
01:59:02,441 --> 01:59:03,460
attention to all of them.

4212
01:59:03,730 --> 01:59:06,220
And if you're only focusing
on national overload.

4213
01:59:06,250 --> 01:59:06,371
Yeah,

4214
01:59:06,371 --> 01:59:06,910
exactly.

4215
01:59:06,910 --> 01:59:07,660
Or if you're only,

4216
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:08,110
but hold on,

4217
01:59:08,110 --> 01:59:11,110
if you're only focusing
on that aspect of life,

4218
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:13,780
it can be incredibly overwhelming cause
you start thinking that's the whole

4219
01:59:13,781 --> 01:59:17,220
world that the whole world is these
conspiracies because these are the things

4220
01:59:17,230 --> 01:59:18,880
you're concentrating on primarily.

4221
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:19,841
But this,

4222
01:59:19,841 --> 01:59:20,770
this is what I'm saying.

4223
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:23,230
That's it is he just talked
about operation Northwoods,

4224
01:59:23,231 --> 01:59:24,064
that whole thing.

4225
01:59:24,270 --> 01:59:25,690
That was operation Northwoods.

4226
01:59:25,710 --> 01:59:26,080
Yeah.

4227
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:27,130
That is some,

4228
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:28,860
that's about as high ABC.

4229
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:30,490
That's about as that's true.

4230
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:31,390
Clear as day.

4231
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:35,020
But if you break it
down and you look at it,

4232
01:59:35,410 --> 01:59:36,800
you look at operation Northwoods,

4233
01:59:36,820 --> 01:59:41,590
you look at that shit that is about as
gangster and sinister and evil as you.

4234
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:41,910
Yeah.

4235
01:59:41,910 --> 01:59:42,220
We,

4236
01:59:42,220 --> 01:59:43,930
we went over just a little while ago.

4237
01:59:43,931 --> 01:59:44,560
We were going into.

4238
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:45,340
Totally.

4239
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:50,340
My point is if you believe that
no other conspiracy theory,

4240
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:53,560
whether they're right or wrong,

4241
01:59:53,561 --> 01:59:56,260
like government conspiracy
should be ridiculed.

4242
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:57,130
You shouldn't,

4243
01:59:57,130 --> 01:59:57,700
there's no,

4244
01:59:57,700 --> 01:59:58,900
there should be no ridicule.

4245
01:59:58,930 --> 01:59:59,321
You're right.

4246
01:59:59,321 --> 01:59:59,890
You should,

4247
01:59:59,890 --> 02:00:01,530
instead of looking at them with riveter,

4248
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:01,810
cool,

4249
02:00:01,810 --> 02:00:02,471
you should look at him.

4250
02:00:02,471 --> 02:00:03,550
Objective Lee and,

4251
02:00:03,630 --> 02:00:04,510
and exactly.

4252
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:05,350
And the only,

4253
02:00:05,350 --> 02:00:10,350
the only people that have a right to
ridicule a conspiracy theories are people

4254
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:14,680
that don't believe in
any conspiracy theories.

4255
02:00:14,890 --> 02:00:16,180
If you don't believe in any of them,

4256
02:00:16,270 --> 02:00:16,691
yes,

4257
02:00:16,691 --> 02:00:19,800
I understand why you're
ridiculing it all the time.

4258
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:21,970
Even some of them,

4259
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:23,590
if you believe in some of them,

4260
02:00:24,100 --> 02:00:25,930
the other ones you don't believe in,

4261
02:00:26,170 --> 02:00:27,910
I think you should be more.

4262
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:29,043
Uh,

4263
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:30,430
I don't believe in that shit,

4264
02:00:30,431 --> 02:00:31,480
but I understand why.

4265
02:00:31,481 --> 02:00:32,120
But to me,

4266
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:34,000
my defense almost now almost,

4267
02:00:34,030 --> 02:00:35,110
we could probably get a store on a cord.

4268
02:00:35,111 --> 02:00:37,530
I'm most looking forward
to trial in Texas and,

4269
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:41,050
and Connecticut because I want to
and the Lord has already agreed.

4270
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:44,920
I'm going to sit there and I'm going to
show them history and all these things

4271
02:00:44,921 --> 02:00:46,710
that say like,

4272
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:46,931
I mean,

4273
02:00:46,931 --> 02:00:47,800
I watched the,

4274
02:00:47,801 --> 02:00:48,130
uh,

4275
02:00:48,130 --> 02:00:49,270
it's already been out
for like a year or two,

4276
02:00:49,271 --> 02:00:53,470
but I watched the minions three
or four and it's like in the 60s.

4277
02:00:53,890 --> 02:00:57,280
And they break down to the
set of Hollywood and the
moon landings being staged

4278
02:00:57,900 --> 02:00:58,410
now.

4279
02:00:58,410 --> 02:01:00,190
Now astronauts died doing that.

4280
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:02,200
So how traumatic is that for their family?

4281
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:03,311
But I,

4282
02:01:03,311 --> 02:01:04,144
I believe that

4283
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:06,910
we're going to get to in a minute.

4284
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:07,091
Wait,

4285
02:01:07,091 --> 02:01:07,271
wait.

4286
02:01:07,271 --> 02:01:08,860
Astronauts done which ones?

4287
02:01:09,010 --> 02:01:09,420
Oh,

4288
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:10,090
space shuttle.

4289
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:10,960
When we're going to talk about,

4290
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:11,290
no,

4291
02:01:11,290 --> 02:01:12,123
no,

4292
02:01:12,580 --> 02:01:14,820
the Apollo launchpad

4293
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:17,440
was talking to one.

4294
02:01:17,930 --> 02:01:18,763
We're not

4295
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:21,813
practicing.

4296
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:23,310
We're practicing.

4297
02:01:23,310 --> 02:01:23,980
Okay.

4298
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:26,680
So we're going to get to this next and I,

4299
02:01:26,730 --> 02:01:27,563
I respect you.

4300
02:01:27,670 --> 02:01:29,950
I want you guys to yell at each other
for three minutes while I go pee.

4301
02:01:30,070 --> 02:01:30,903
I gotta pee two.

4302
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:31,690
Okay.

4303
02:01:31,690 --> 02:01:33,220
As you don't talk to yourself,

4304
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:33,790
just hold,

4305
02:01:33,790 --> 02:01:34,623
we'll do it and shit.

4306
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:35,021
Shit.

4307
02:01:35,021 --> 02:01:35,854
I'll go first.

4308
02:01:36,190 --> 02:01:36,880
Okay.

4309
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:37,460
Anyways.

4310
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:38,340
And know what I'm saying.

4311
02:01:38,341 --> 02:01:39,174
This and you're bad.

4312
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:40,010
I get

4313
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:40,520
it.

4314
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:40,701
No,

4315
02:01:40,701 --> 02:01:41,310
you do get it.

4316
02:01:41,310 --> 02:01:42,110
You know why?

4317
02:01:42,110 --> 02:01:42,830
Because,

4318
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:43,663
you know.

4319
02:01:44,430 --> 02:01:44,620
No,

4320
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:45,020
of course.

4321
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:45,853
Of course.

4322
02:01:45,980 --> 02:01:46,813
Of course.

4323
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:47,331
Of course.

4324
02:01:47,331 --> 02:01:48,164
Alex,

4325
02:01:48,350 --> 02:01:49,183
you,

4326
02:01:50,210 --> 02:01:55,210
you are someone that I could talk to
about the flat earth conspiracy and you

4327
02:01:56,301 --> 02:01:58,790
believe in so many crazy
things about the government.

4328
02:01:59,060 --> 02:01:59,750
You don't,

4329
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:00,530
you don't,

4330
02:02:00,530 --> 02:02:01,070
uh,

4331
02:02:01,070 --> 02:02:02,240
you don't believe in flat earth,

4332
02:02:02,450 --> 02:02:05,150
but you can kind of understand
where I'm coming from,

4333
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:05,740
right?

4334
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:06,573
Yeah.

4335
02:02:06,590 --> 02:02:07,970
GPS is real.

4336
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:12,050
I know airline pilots that
fly from California to,

4337
02:02:12,890 --> 02:02:13,723
uh,

4338
02:02:13,790 --> 02:02:18,600
you'll places like Australia and they've
got another wing over to Hong Kong and

4339
02:02:18,601 --> 02:02:20,900
then they go to mosque and you
can fly anywhere in the world.

4340
02:02:20,901 --> 02:02:21,491
If it was flat,

4341
02:02:21,491 --> 02:02:21,891
it was flat.

4342
02:02:21,891 --> 02:02:22,610
It has,

4343
02:02:22,610 --> 02:02:25,760
you could go from east to west
just like you could on a ball.

4344
02:02:25,761 --> 02:02:26,880
You just don't understand what,

4345
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:27,350
uh,

4346
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:27,640
uh,

4347
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:28,450
like a,

4348
02:02:28,450 --> 02:02:29,241
like a pizza is,

4349
02:02:29,241 --> 02:02:30,020
you could just go anywhere.

4350
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:33,380
Like if you're on a flat or do you
want a flatter is what I'm talking.

4351
02:02:33,410 --> 02:02:34,243
Travel anywhere.

4352
02:02:34,370 --> 02:02:35,570
Give two cities.

4353
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:38,420
He pointed to cities and
you can just go to so much.

4354
02:02:38,421 --> 02:02:39,201
I get what you cost you.

4355
02:02:39,201 --> 02:02:40,110
Nothing to do with the pouch.

4356
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:40,810
I'm not that.

4357
02:02:40,810 --> 02:02:41,150
No,

4358
02:02:41,150 --> 02:02:41,271
no,

4359
02:02:41,271 --> 02:02:41,391
no.

4360
02:02:41,391 --> 02:02:41,700
Listen,

4361
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:42,321
I have the money.

4362
02:02:42,321 --> 02:02:43,730
I'm not trying to convince you.

4363
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:45,260
I'm not trying to convince you,

4364
02:02:45,261 --> 02:02:45,920
Alex.

4365
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:47,710
My point is my point.

4366
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:48,620
It takes you got to,

4367
02:02:48,640 --> 02:02:50,510
you got to find it on your fucking own.

4368
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:52,670
There's no way you're
going to be convinced.

4369
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:52,971
No,

4370
02:02:52,971 --> 02:02:57,971
no one has ever been convinced or they
have to really find it within themselves

4371
02:02:57,981 --> 02:02:59,300
and and do some deep,

4372
02:02:59,640 --> 02:03:00,160
deep,

4373
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:00,741
what I'm telling you,

4374
02:03:00,741 --> 02:03:01,574
this soul searching.

4375
02:03:01,730 --> 02:03:03,650
If I finance a research ship,

4376
02:03:03,860 --> 02:03:06,080
large ship and make a documentary,

4377
02:03:06,081 --> 02:03:07,160
I can't go away for three months.

4378
02:03:07,161 --> 02:03:09,230
I will pay for you three months.

4379
02:03:09,231 --> 02:03:10,064
I'm not,

4380
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:11,223
you know,

4381
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:11,780
there's,

4382
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:12,320
to me having,

4383
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:14,300
money's not a big deal except
we can do cool things with it.

4384
02:03:14,570 --> 02:03:15,021
One of them.

4385
02:03:15,021 --> 02:03:15,411
What's one of the,

4386
02:03:15,411 --> 02:03:16,260
can you race

4387
02:03:17,990 --> 02:03:19,280
to go to the South Wall?

4388
02:03:19,281 --> 02:03:19,941
We're going to need,

4389
02:03:19,941 --> 02:03:20,900
we're going to need a,

4390
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:22,880
you guys go into the food or in orbit.

4391
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:24,810
Just try not to go on a cruise ship.

4392
02:03:25,410 --> 02:03:26,330
This is what I'm going to do.

4393
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:27,921
Okay?

4394
02:03:27,921 --> 02:03:29,990
You raised the money for a trip.

4395
02:03:31,970 --> 02:03:32,230
Okay?

4396
02:03:32,230 --> 02:03:33,063
You

4397
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:36,970
do this the deal.

4398
02:03:37,550 --> 02:03:38,001
Go Pee,

4399
02:03:38,001 --> 02:03:38,391
Go pee,

4400
02:03:38,391 --> 02:03:39,190
man.

4401
02:03:39,190 --> 02:03:40,023
You're going to go see

4402
02:03:44,090 --> 02:03:44,923
the plan.

4403
02:03:47,770 --> 02:03:48,860
He's the ambassador.

4404
02:03:50,030 --> 02:03:51,140
He's the Ambassador

4405
02:03:53,740 --> 02:03:54,660
to just go pee,

4406
02:03:54,661 --> 02:03:55,280
man.

4407
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:56,290
Big Ice Fields.

4408
02:03:56,780 --> 02:03:57,471
That guy's going to be,

4409
02:03:57,471 --> 02:03:58,700
and this is what this
one we're going to do.

4410
02:03:58,810 --> 02:03:59,643
Alex,

4411
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:05,040
can you give me times 27 a tire crew
who are going to the edge of the flat

4412
02:04:06,201 --> 02:04:07,034
earth,

4413
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:08,360
but it's not going to be me.

4414
02:04:08,390 --> 02:04:08,751
I'm going to,

4415
02:04:08,751 --> 02:04:10,320
I'm going to designate somebody.

4416
02:04:10,321 --> 02:04:11,090
It's not just scared,

4417
02:04:11,090 --> 02:04:11,640
so I'm,

4418
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:12,680
we're going to do this.

4419
02:04:12,830 --> 02:04:13,551
We're going to do this.

4420
02:04:13,551 --> 02:04:14,500
Try Joe Rogan.

4421
02:04:14,501 --> 02:04:14,700
Yeah,

4422
02:04:14,700 --> 02:04:14,891
no,

4423
02:04:14,891 --> 02:04:15,080
no.

4424
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:16,490
We're going to do this job and the sand.

4425
02:04:16,530 --> 02:04:17,363
Awesome.

4426
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:19,040
You're going to find
the edge of the world.

4427
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:19,941
They ice caps,

4428
02:04:19,941 --> 02:04:20,361
caps.

4429
02:04:20,361 --> 02:04:23,060
They're knocking things off
the drop off with my iPhone.

4430
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:23,510
Yes.

4431
02:04:23,510 --> 02:04:24,343
Yes.

4432
02:04:24,530 --> 02:04:24,981
Go Pee,

4433
02:04:24,981 --> 02:04:25,251
man.

4434
02:04:25,251 --> 02:04:26,084
Hopi.

4435
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:27,050
Don't you have to go?

4436
02:04:27,050 --> 02:04:28,190
We're going to send someone else.

4437
02:04:28,220 --> 02:04:28,720
Alex [inaudible].

4438
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:30,590
We're going to do you know what?

4439
02:04:30,770 --> 02:04:31,603
We're going to do this.

4440
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:37,130
I don't want to be the one
that goes here in a minute now.

4441
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:41,670
Now I came here and I please or keeping
babies alive and taking their organs.

4442
02:04:41,671 --> 02:04:44,760
How does it prove that
Jamie pulled some shit?

4443
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:46,193
They admitted that.

4444
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:47,851
Normalizing it.

4445
02:04:47,851 --> 02:04:48,151
No,

4446
02:04:48,151 --> 02:04:49,530
the fuck the governor.

4447
02:04:51,330 --> 02:04:52,440
You really think,

4448
02:04:52,470 --> 02:04:57,450
do you really think there's people
out there campaigning for late term

4449
02:04:57,451 --> 02:04:58,200
abortions?

4450
02:04:58,200 --> 02:04:59,460
You think that Shit's real.

4451
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:03,240
You have to say six
routed Monday to keep it.

4452
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:07,900
Who would campaign for it that they look,

4453
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:12,630
they're fucking Kelly already.

4454
02:05:12,631 --> 02:05:13,620
Marquette's saw.

4455
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:18,640
You're telling me it isn't real when
I had a fucking Goddamn fucking it.

4456
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:20,440
That's a conspiracy theory.

4457
02:05:22,330 --> 02:05:23,740
We met your fucking top.

4458
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:24,583
You're about to get it

4459
02:05:26,070 --> 02:05:27,000
already born babies.

4460
02:05:27,090 --> 02:05:28,290
Stop fucking lying.

4461
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:29,340
God fucking damn.

4462
02:05:29,410 --> 02:05:30,330
I'm getting pissed now.

4463
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:31,110
Don't get pissed.

4464
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:31,570
No,

4465
02:05:31,570 --> 02:05:34,330
I mean you saw the dude is fucking

4466
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:42,810
fucking Senate voted to kill babies.

4467
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:44,260
I'm fucking bars.

4468
02:05:45,350 --> 02:05:46,183
Of course.

4469
02:05:46,350 --> 02:05:47,183
I believe that

4470
02:05:48,790 --> 02:05:49,410
course.

4471
02:05:49,410 --> 02:05:51,090
I believe Eddie,

4472
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:54,980
let me explain to you when,

4473
02:05:54,990 --> 02:05:55,823
let me explain to you.

4474
02:05:55,890 --> 02:05:58,320
We went into a long
conversation that I heard it.

4475
02:05:58,980 --> 02:05:59,720
I heard it.

4476
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:00,181
You heard it.

4477
02:06:00,181 --> 02:06:01,840
I heard the whole podcast years chasing,

4478
02:06:01,841 --> 02:06:06,841
playing with this psychosis is so crazy
that always thought I was so tough

4479
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:09,890
anymore.

4480
02:06:09,890 --> 02:06:11,220
I gotta Piss a little bit.

4481
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:13,050
There's the point is,

4482
02:06:13,051 --> 02:06:14,640
is that the point is,

4483
02:06:14,641 --> 02:06:15,391
is that dude,

4484
02:06:15,391 --> 02:06:17,040
I'm not the reality.

4485
02:06:17,041 --> 02:06:17,910
So crazy.

4486
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,800
Why are we debating
whether the earth is flat?

4487
02:06:19,801 --> 02:06:20,011
Dude,

4488
02:06:20,011 --> 02:06:20,790
they're keeping,

4489
02:06:20,790 --> 02:06:22,650
they have human animal hybrids.

4490
02:06:22,870 --> 02:06:23,120
There's,

4491
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:23,911
there's the fricking,

4492
02:06:23,911 --> 02:06:27,960
I have been there when people that
work for the Pentagon say that they,

4493
02:06:27,990 --> 02:06:30,720
we go to the laboratory and
we meet with the ambassador.

4494
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:33,330
We have to take higher and higher doses
to meet with them and they're giving us

4495
02:06:33,331 --> 02:06:34,650
technology and the technology work.

4496
02:06:34,950 --> 02:06:35,340
I've been,

4497
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:36,880
this is going on Duke.

4498
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:37,830
You want to know this?

4499
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:38,600
Listen,

4500
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:40,770
rely or think about how this isn't real

4501
02:06:42,270 --> 02:06:42,840
man.

4502
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:43,673
The aliens.

4503
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:45,360
Alex,

4504
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:48,040
think about what I said I said to,

4505
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:53,050
do you think there's actually people
out there did believe that our campaign

4506
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:57,143
telescope

4507
02:06:59,010 --> 02:06:59,740
this into what?

4508
02:06:59,740 --> 02:07:00,270
I sucks.

4509
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:00,951
He's functioning you.

4510
02:07:00,951 --> 02:07:02,310
When I said fucking with you and said,

4511
02:07:02,311 --> 02:07:06,180
do you think there's actually people
out there that are campaigning for late

4512
02:07:06,181 --> 02:07:06,870
term abortions?

4513
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:07,703
Of course there are,

4514
02:07:07,770 --> 02:07:10,490
but I'm making it seem like I don't
believe they are hugging it down.

4515
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:12,210
Know I'm being the ultimate skeptic.

4516
02:07:13,950 --> 02:07:17,040
Ultimate skeptic worlds
does that all the time.

4517
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:20,580
He says [inaudible] right there.

4518
02:07:20,581 --> 02:07:22,980
I'm threatened about Mr. Goody two shoes.

4519
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:23,821
Buy them,

4520
02:07:23,821 --> 02:07:25,950
keeping babies alive and killing
them and that nobody cares.

4521
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:27,240
I fundamentally,

4522
02:07:28,170 --> 02:07:30,690
that's what I'm saying and I'm being
honest here is I'm not like certified but

4523
02:07:30,691 --> 02:07:31,500
crazy,

4524
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:33,030
but I deal with this all day long.

4525
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:33,761
I get what job?

4526
02:07:33,761 --> 02:07:35,140
Tried to shy away and people go crazy.

4527
02:07:35,141 --> 02:07:35,590
He's doing know.

4528
02:07:35,590 --> 02:07:38,920
Why didn't I never saw that clip of that
guy saying that they would resuscitate

4529
02:07:38,921 --> 02:07:41,770
the babies and then they would make a
decision and heard about that New York,

4530
02:07:41,771 --> 02:07:45,100
a bill that they're trying to pass
and then there's some big shit.

4531
02:07:45,690 --> 02:07:46,450
It's like,

4532
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:47,420
it's like a

4533
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:49,770
city.

4534
02:07:49,770 --> 02:07:50,080
Well,

4535
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:50,940
worsening cough.

4536
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:55,540
They're giving a bunch of Goddamn
fucking organ harvesting doctors control

4537
02:07:55,541 --> 02:07:56,374
outside of law.

4538
02:07:56,470 --> 02:07:57,850
You heard that piece of shit.

4539
02:07:57,851 --> 02:08:02,851
Fucking KKK guy fucking governor say we're
going to keep alive after the fucking

4540
02:08:03,311 --> 02:08:04,090
bored.

4541
02:08:04,090 --> 02:08:04,500
He's like,

4542
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:06,310
they want to fucking take their organs.

4543
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,480
It's incredible.

4544
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:08,920
He's a KKK guy.

4545
02:08:09,050 --> 02:08:09,883
It's incredible.

4546
02:08:10,060 --> 02:08:10,600
Fuck.

4547
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:11,740
It's so incredible.

4548
02:08:11,741 --> 02:08:13,110
Then I did a picture with a guy,

4549
02:08:13,130 --> 02:08:15,340
the KKK outfit in blackface.

4550
02:08:15,430 --> 02:08:17,020
They elected him because he's black males.

4551
02:08:17,170 --> 02:08:19,530
They had that shit and
when he messed up and said,

4552
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:21,310
we keep them alive to
get their fucking organs.

4553
02:08:21,430 --> 02:08:22,880
They used that to deactivate him.

4554
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:24,430
Me.

4555
02:08:24,430 --> 02:08:27,310
Why do you think fraternities have you
screw sheep and all this and you know,

4556
02:08:27,311 --> 02:08:28,360
give guys blowjobs.

4557
02:08:28,361 --> 02:08:29,194
That's why I never joined that

4558
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:35,493
fraternity.

4559
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:36,550
Okay.

4560
02:08:36,550 --> 02:08:38,620
I'm so happy as I do this podcast.

4561
02:08:39,250 --> 02:08:42,150
So happy I turned down
this fucking amazing.

4562
02:08:43,210 --> 02:08:44,380
It's fucking amazing.

4563
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:46,590
It was good.

4564
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:48,340
We got to Paris,

4565
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:50,620
new fucking world order.

4566
02:08:51,070 --> 02:08:51,903
Oh my God.

4567
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:52,763
Eddie.

4568
02:08:53,110 --> 02:08:53,943
I got you.

4569
02:08:54,670 --> 02:08:55,870
Did you got so pissed off?

4570
02:08:55,871 --> 02:08:57,140
I'm so glad I fucked it too.

4571
02:08:58,010 --> 02:08:59,080
We got some dude.

4572
02:08:59,330 --> 02:09:03,460
How many jre clips they're gonna do?

4573
02:09:03,461 --> 02:09:03,910
They're gonna.

4574
02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:05,170
They're gonna put you to music.

4575
02:09:06,220 --> 02:09:06,660
Yeah.

4576
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:09,280
Jesus pulled up MIT
saying they got an animal.

4577
02:09:09,281 --> 02:09:10,114
Human pig.

4578
02:09:10,190 --> 02:09:10,371
Yeah,

4579
02:09:10,371 --> 02:09:10,711
we did it.

4580
02:09:10,711 --> 02:09:11,544
Let's just not forget.

4581
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:12,820
We did listen to it.

4582
02:09:12,850 --> 02:09:13,610
Go take a leak.

4583
02:09:13,610 --> 02:09:14,443
I'm with you.

4584
02:09:14,810 --> 02:09:15,070
Listen,

4585
02:09:15,070 --> 02:09:15,241
man.

4586
02:09:15,241 --> 02:09:17,240
He just kind of freaked me
out about several subjects.

4587
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:17,490
No,

4588
02:09:17,490 --> 02:09:17,840
no,

4589
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:18,051
no.

4590
02:09:18,051 --> 02:09:18,590
Bullshit.

4591
02:09:18,590 --> 02:09:18,990
Yeah.

4592
02:09:18,990 --> 02:09:20,600
He freaked me out about several subjects.

4593
02:09:20,630 --> 02:09:23,000
There's people out there
campaigning for the record.

4594
02:09:23,001 --> 02:09:25,190
That article says that
there was no written,

4595
02:09:25,700 --> 02:09:26,210
uh,

4596
02:09:26,210 --> 02:09:27,440
deep data on that.

4597
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:27,980
It,

4598
02:09:27,980 --> 02:09:29,990
that came from three interviews they had.

4599
02:09:29,991 --> 02:09:31,610
So this is the human pig one.

4600
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:32,900
People were saying that to them.

4601
02:09:34,370 --> 02:09:35,510
Of course they tried it.

4602
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:36,770
Why wouldn't they try it?

4603
02:09:36,890 --> 02:09:37,540
If you were a,

4604
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:39,920
if you were the leader of the free world,

4605
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:40,701
like didn't,

4606
02:09:40,701 --> 02:09:41,720
wasn't there some,

4607
02:09:42,210 --> 02:09:45,260
God damn it was it the Nazis that were,

4608
02:09:45,380 --> 02:09:49,340
they were trying to theorize how to
combine humans with animals to make a

4609
02:09:49,341 --> 02:09:50,270
stronger human.

4610
02:09:50,750 --> 02:09:53,180
Wasn't there some of that
they were for sure into that.

4611
02:09:53,240 --> 02:09:54,320
Was there something like that?

4612
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:56,450
If there's a youtube blink that's uh,

4613
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:57,360
you know,

4614
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:58,041
that's for sure,

4615
02:09:58,041 --> 02:09:58,340
right?

4616
02:09:58,340 --> 02:09:59,151
Like for sure.

4617
02:09:59,151 --> 02:09:59,630
They,

4618
02:09:59,630 --> 02:09:59,930
they,

4619
02:09:59,930 --> 02:10:00,520
they've,

4620
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:01,610
they definitely,

4621
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:01,941
I mean,

4622
02:10:01,941 --> 02:10:04,640
I think all governments definitely
give their soldier steroids.

4623
02:10:04,820 --> 02:10:06,590
They definitely give them an fet amines.

4624
02:10:06,740 --> 02:10:07,250
They give them,

4625
02:10:07,250 --> 02:10:09,400
definitely give them chemicals
to make them crazy shit.

4626
02:10:09,401 --> 02:10:10,010
I would,

4627
02:10:10,010 --> 02:10:10,581
are you kidding?

4628
02:10:10,581 --> 02:10:12,890
That's where they started doing
that and these fucking army,

4629
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:13,933
the Nazis,

4630
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:15,110
Nazis rather the,

4631
02:10:15,111 --> 02:10:15,530
uh,

4632
02:10:15,530 --> 02:10:15,831
the,

4633
02:10:15,831 --> 02:10:16,370
um,

4634
02:10:16,370 --> 02:10:19,370
kamikazes the kamikazes
do with meth them up.

4635
02:10:19,430 --> 02:10:19,720
That's it.

4636
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:20,060
I mean,

4637
02:10:20,060 --> 02:10:21,380
I'm pretty sure that's true.

4638
02:10:21,410 --> 02:10:25,050
Read that 100% up on youtube.

4639
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:26,120
Yeah.

4640
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:26,351
That,

4641
02:10:26,351 --> 02:10:30,440
that was one of the ways they would get
them not just like nationalism and pride

4642
02:10:30,441 --> 02:10:31,041
for the country.

4643
02:10:31,041 --> 02:10:31,630
They would do,

4644
02:10:31,630 --> 02:10:34,100
they would jack them up on crystal
and that's why they'd fly that

4645
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:35,480
plane right into that fucking boat.

4646
02:10:35,690 --> 02:10:37,910
They knew and boom.

4647
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:38,391
I mean,

4648
02:10:38,391 --> 02:10:39,890
that is a nutty thing to do,

4649
02:10:39,891 --> 02:10:40,191
man.

4650
02:10:40,191 --> 02:10:41,024
You gotta be,

4651
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:45,020
you gotta be in a weird state of mind
and you've got to have such a horrible

4652
02:10:45,021 --> 02:10:45,831
life that you're like,

4653
02:10:45,831 --> 02:10:46,521
fuck it.

4654
02:10:46,521 --> 02:10:49,010
Let me just crash into this fucking boat.

4655
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:49,610
Right.

4656
02:10:49,610 --> 02:10:50,300
For the Gen,

4657
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:51,520
they're like happy about,

4658
02:10:51,530 --> 02:10:51,830
they're like,

4659
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:53,870
I can't wait to escape this shit.

4660
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:56,260
What an insane choice.

4661
02:10:56,270 --> 02:10:57,550
It's the only PC has,

4662
02:10:57,551 --> 02:11:00,230
is when he's in that plane killing people.

4663
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:02,820
What a fucking crazy choice that
you're going to do that for you,

4664
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:03,861
Alex,

4665
02:11:03,861 --> 02:11:04,371
welcome back.

4666
02:11:04,371 --> 02:11:05,620
We're talking about kamikazes.

4667
02:11:06,250 --> 02:11:08,240
We're saying that we
think kamikaze is where,

4668
02:11:08,241 --> 02:11:08,960
uh,

4669
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:09,530
there was,

4670
02:11:09,530 --> 02:11:10,940
they gave him crystal Meth,

4671
02:11:10,941 --> 02:11:11,151
right?

4672
02:11:11,151 --> 02:11:12,260
Wasn't that a part of the program?

4673
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:12,970
Yeah,

4674
02:11:12,970 --> 02:11:13,130
no,

4675
02:11:13,130 --> 02:11:13,660
I mean,

4676
02:11:13,660 --> 02:11:16,970
warfare's always drugs and
[inaudible] the Japanese,

4677
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:20,510
the Japanese learned about in World War
One when they're actually on our side

4678
02:11:20,511 --> 02:11:21,344
against Russia.

4679
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:22,370
I went back and forth.

4680
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:24,020
They it in World War One,

4681
02:11:24,021 --> 02:11:26,420
the Japanese learn about
MSG because you haven't,

4682
02:11:26,421 --> 02:11:27,254
he's like good food.

4683
02:11:27,580 --> 02:11:27,970
And they're like,

4684
02:11:27,970 --> 02:11:30,000
well the military wouldn't complain.

4685
02:11:30,010 --> 02:11:31,520
They would just lose
weight and starve to death.

4686
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:36,610
So they learn they were fighting
the Russians in world war one to uh,

4687
02:11:36,770 --> 02:11:38,750
just go ahead and give them Msg,

4688
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:39,831
which you have a,

4689
02:11:39,831 --> 02:11:40,850
she tells you your brand,

4690
02:11:40,860 --> 02:11:41,121
everything.

4691
02:11:41,121 --> 02:11:41,954
It's super toxic.

4692
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:42,830
And so yeah,

4693
02:11:42,830 --> 02:11:44,090
monosodium glutamate,

4694
02:11:44,180 --> 02:11:45,620
like the stuff from Chinese food,

4695
02:11:45,621 --> 02:11:46,161
is that what you're saying?

4696
02:11:46,161 --> 02:11:47,210
Super fricking toxic.

4697
02:11:47,211 --> 02:11:47,391
Yeah.

4698
02:11:47,391 --> 02:11:48,260
But the business really.

4699
02:11:48,610 --> 02:11:49,670
But beyond that,

4700
02:11:49,700 --> 02:11:49,971
yes.

4701
02:11:49,971 --> 02:11:50,930
They would give them,

4702
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:54,290
well the Germans were big on
steroids and methamphetamine.

4703
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:55,690
It's were,

4704
02:11:55,690 --> 02:11:56,750
we were just saying that.

4705
02:11:57,110 --> 02:11:57,490
Yeah.

4706
02:11:57,490 --> 02:11:58,280
Well that's all record.

4707
02:11:58,280 --> 02:12:01,220
I mean it's not what this is
like in mainline history stuff.

4708
02:12:01,310 --> 02:12:01,701
By the way.

4709
02:12:01,701 --> 02:12:03,140
I said I'll give you
the secrets of Hitler.

4710
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:04,730
Oh,

4711
02:12:04,730 --> 02:12:05,563
there's secrets.

4712
02:12:05,930 --> 02:12:06,763
Yup.

4713
02:12:06,860 --> 02:12:07,310
What other,

4714
02:12:07,310 --> 02:12:08,570
but this is not the BS.

4715
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:09,470
This is the real thing.

4716
02:12:09,490 --> 02:12:09,740
Okay.

4717
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:10,610
How do you know though,

4718
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:12,890
who's telling you this stuff?

4719
02:12:13,270 --> 02:12:16,430
GTE classified at a
beyond classified Eddie.

4720
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:17,381
No,

4721
02:12:17,381 --> 02:12:18,051
I mean Alex,

4722
02:12:18,051 --> 02:12:19,180
seriously d overthink.

4723
02:12:19,250 --> 02:12:19,640
Okay.

4724
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:20,510
Cause you're father?

4725
02:12:21,250 --> 02:12:25,410
Grandfather was German in
Dallas and he worked for a,

4726
02:12:25,510 --> 02:12:27,680
the inventor of indoor air conditioning.

4727
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:28,793
It was a billionaire.

4728
02:12:28,820 --> 02:12:29,653
And uh,

4729
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:30,880
what's the rich area?

4730
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:31,221
Dallas,

4731
02:12:31,221 --> 02:12:32,960
where the Republicans all live?

4732
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:33,740
Uh,

4733
02:12:33,740 --> 02:12:33,981
God,

4734
02:12:33,981 --> 02:12:34,850
what's the name of that place?

4735
02:12:35,540 --> 02:12:36,200
Arlington.

4736
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:36,531
No,

4737
02:12:36,531 --> 02:12:36,981
it's not hard.

4738
02:12:36,981 --> 02:12:37,340
Like tenants.

4739
02:12:37,340 --> 02:12:38,720
That's the thing right there
in the middle of Dallas.

4740
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:42,233
That's awesome.

4741
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:44,390
You think Dallas just like all buildings,

4742
02:12:44,750 --> 02:12:47,360
there's a huge park and
like all these big mansions.

4743
02:12:47,950 --> 02:12:48,530
Hmm.

4744
02:12:48,530 --> 02:12:49,190
Anyway,

4745
02:12:49,190 --> 02:12:51,410
he lived up there and
it wasn't just from him.

4746
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:53,630
You know,

4747
02:12:53,630 --> 02:12:54,463
I,

4748
02:12:54,860 --> 02:12:55,910
I'm not going to get into it.

4749
02:12:56,100 --> 02:13:01,100
The point is is that Hitler was on the
cover of Time magazine and he was true.

4750
02:13:01,670 --> 02:13:02,790
Unless that's a photo shot.

4751
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:04,400
You want it twice.

4752
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:06,570
Well Trump was under the
cover of Time magazine too,

4753
02:13:07,010 --> 02:13:07,701
but exactly.

4754
02:13:07,701 --> 02:13:07,900
No,

4755
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:10,720
really the problem is
give you guys the fake.

4756
02:13:10,790 --> 02:13:11,571
He made his own war.

4757
02:13:11,571 --> 02:13:14,280
Should I or should I just give it gestalt?

4758
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:15,283
Like a boil down.

4759
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:16,183
Here's the thing.

4760
02:13:16,820 --> 02:13:19,010
It wasn't just my grandfather
was his other people.

4761
02:13:19,550 --> 02:13:24,530
My grandfather said it was
really confusing for him
because he worked for this

4762
02:13:24,531 --> 02:13:27,860
guy that was in refrigeration and air
conditioning when he was in high school

4763
02:13:27,861 --> 02:13:30,020
and his dad owned the car
dealerships from Dallas and stuff.

4764
02:13:30,021 --> 02:13:30,854
They lived there,

4765
02:13:31,230 --> 02:13:31,771
the rich area.

4766
02:13:31,771 --> 02:13:32,280
Dallas.

4767
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:33,210
And what did they tell you?

4768
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:37,190
Well through one reason he wanted in the,

4769
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:41,120
by the time World War Two started to
drop out of ut and you know all that and

4770
02:13:41,130 --> 02:13:42,390
getting to go join the army air corps.

4771
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:43,620
She tells you to tell me all this stuff.

4772
02:13:43,621 --> 02:13:44,600
I'm going to go your,

4773
02:13:44,601 --> 02:13:46,290
your grandfather is a little eccentric.

4774
02:13:46,580 --> 02:13:47,520
And now like he,

4775
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:49,080
my grandfather did Verner von Braun.

4776
02:13:49,290 --> 02:13:50,480
He came to Austin at events.

4777
02:13:51,130 --> 02:13:51,560
Yeah.

4778
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:52,170
Yeah.

4779
02:13:52,170 --> 02:13:53,070
So anyways,

4780
02:13:53,370 --> 02:13:55,740
you grandpa knew Warner von Braun.

4781
02:13:55,830 --> 02:13:57,180
Well not just some of
those events and yeah,

4782
02:13:57,181 --> 02:13:57,570
he came to,

4783
02:13:57,570 --> 02:13:58,321
you know what,

4784
02:13:58,321 --> 02:13:59,310
at ut events we'll probably,

4785
02:13:59,311 --> 02:14:02,400
the next point is I'm getting too
well cause there were like German,

4786
02:14:02,430 --> 02:14:05,010
no wonder you believe in the moon landing.

4787
02:14:05,250 --> 02:14:06,083
I get it now.

4788
02:14:06,980 --> 02:14:09,120
Didn't make sense to say
let's let him finish.

4789
02:14:09,121 --> 02:14:11,550
His story was what they
called High German.

4790
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:13,531
And so the high,

4791
02:14:13,531 --> 02:14:13,711
yeah,

4792
02:14:13,711 --> 02:14:15,330
that's what that is luber mentioned.

4793
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:17,340
So they only would talk to
people that were in the club.

4794
02:14:17,970 --> 02:14:18,780
Oh Shit.

4795
02:14:18,780 --> 02:14:19,230
Okay.

4796
02:14:19,230 --> 02:14:19,700
Yeah.

4797
02:14:19,700 --> 02:14:20,420
So,

4798
02:14:20,420 --> 02:14:21,270
so anyways,

4799
02:14:21,570 --> 02:14:21,901
uh,

4800
02:14:21,901 --> 02:14:25,880
my grandfather and the thing was like
an Uber mentioned and so you'll high Iq,

4801
02:14:25,890 --> 02:14:27,000
the whole nine yards show.

4802
02:14:27,001 --> 02:14:30,720
He was working with this German guy and
he would just go over there after school

4803
02:14:30,721 --> 02:14:31,050
and work with,

4804
02:14:31,050 --> 02:14:35,010
he was apprentice and my
grandfather watched him get
more and more depressed and

4805
02:14:35,011 --> 02:14:37,350
more and more crazy by the end of the,

4806
02:14:37,351 --> 02:14:40,530
of the 30s and the guy could find it.

4807
02:14:40,531 --> 02:14:41,364
And he said,

4808
02:14:41,730 --> 02:14:42,331
he said,

4809
02:14:42,331 --> 02:14:43,080
uh,

4810
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:44,100
Clyde was my grandfather's name.

4811
02:14:44,101 --> 02:14:44,770
He said,

4812
02:14:44,770 --> 02:14:47,010
you had the Nazis had
my family in Germany,

4813
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:48,240
they're going to kill them all about it.

4814
02:14:48,241 --> 02:14:49,110
I'm having to give them everything.

4815
02:14:49,111 --> 02:14:52,380
I got all my money and I'm having to
sell the patents and work like that was

4816
02:14:52,381 --> 02:14:53,430
working like 20 hours a day,

4817
02:14:53,790 --> 02:14:56,100
giving everything he had because
they were gonna kill his family.

4818
02:14:56,100 --> 02:14:56,933
And Nazi Germany,

4819
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:57,833
he was German.

4820
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:01,620
And so my grandfather wouldn't enlisted
in the Army Air Corps to fight Hitler

4821
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:03,540
because he had that
experience and he was so mad.

4822
02:15:03,541 --> 02:15:04,374
And I was a kid who was like,

4823
02:15:04,530 --> 02:15:05,940
when I was a kid in Dallas,

4824
02:15:06,030 --> 02:15:10,680
WBAP had Hitler speeches on
because Germans are a big
part of the u s and there

4825
02:15:10,681 --> 02:15:11,251
was the boom,

4826
02:15:11,251 --> 02:15:14,850
everybody was supposed to join it and
Hitler was good and we never really bought

4827
02:15:14,851 --> 02:15:15,630
into it.

4828
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:18,870
And then I found out that
this a mentor of mine,

4829
02:15:19,180 --> 02:15:19,600
uh,

4830
02:15:19,600 --> 02:15:21,120
and Ms. Guy be like,

4831
02:15:21,121 --> 02:15:24,870
Bill Gates today had everything he
had sucked out of him by the Nazis.

4832
02:15:25,530 --> 02:15:29,160
So that's what the Nazis would
do was extort and control.

4833
02:15:29,161 --> 02:15:30,450
So I kind of heard about that.

4834
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:31,721
They're not gonna have a look.

4835
02:15:31,721 --> 02:15:32,340
Oh.

4836
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:34,020
Cause they'd send me down there
like a week during the summer,

4837
02:15:34,021 --> 02:15:34,171
you know,

4838
02:15:34,171 --> 02:15:35,100
I was like eight years old.

4839
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:38,160
I'm hearing this and he's like von
Braun as the plan for the orbital space

4840
02:15:38,161 --> 02:15:38,451
craft.

4841
02:15:38,451 --> 02:15:40,950
We've landed and we're going to
have real artificial gravity.

4842
02:15:40,951 --> 02:15:42,000
So Simpson Audit,

4843
02:15:42,001 --> 02:15:42,601
I'm hearing all this stuff.

4844
02:15:42,601 --> 02:15:43,351
He's not like markers,

4845
02:15:43,351 --> 02:15:44,550
the table like talking about it.

4846
02:15:44,700 --> 02:15:47,070
And I'm sitting there and listening
to this and he was talking about,

4847
02:15:47,071 --> 02:15:47,640
yeah,

4848
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:52,260
then I was at least hound for Texaco and
the only place you get a chicken fried

4849
02:15:52,261 --> 02:15:56,430
steak out in New Mexico or west Texas was
a military base and all these God damn

4850
02:15:56,431 --> 02:15:56,971
Nazis.

4851
02:15:56,971 --> 02:15:57,810
And you know,

4852
02:15:57,811 --> 02:15:59,220
one time I didn't want to do it,

4853
02:15:59,221 --> 02:16:03,750
but that guy is smart it off about how
have they had more better at shooting our

4854
02:16:03,751 --> 02:16:04,584
planes down.

4855
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:05,311
So I want to add,

4856
02:16:05,311 --> 02:16:07,080
just rammed his head right to the wall.

4857
02:16:07,081 --> 02:16:09,030
And I never knew what happened after that,

4858
02:16:09,031 --> 02:16:09,480
but sorry,

4859
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:10,800
you just got to kill Nazis.

4860
02:16:11,190 --> 02:16:13,830
And those son of a bitch is our
government brought in thousands of those

4861
02:16:13,831 --> 02:16:14,460
assholes.

4862
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:15,330
And I'm like,

4863
02:16:15,331 --> 02:16:16,090
listen to this.

4864
02:16:16,090 --> 02:16:16,471
I'm like,

4865
02:16:16,471 --> 02:16:17,640
I'm going to read about Nazis.

4866
02:16:17,850 --> 02:16:21,110
So it's how about 10 I started buying
books and I was like 12 to walk into a

4867
02:16:21,111 --> 02:16:22,350
bookstore and I want my cop.

4868
02:16:22,470 --> 02:16:22,711
They go,

4869
02:16:22,711 --> 02:16:23,544
are you a Nazi?

4870
02:16:23,790 --> 02:16:25,500
Like reading Hitler's my struggle?

4871
02:16:25,501 --> 02:16:25,681
No,

4872
02:16:25,681 --> 02:16:26,514
I'm not a Nazi.

4873
02:16:26,550 --> 02:16:30,160
My both my grandfathers told me
how bad Nazis and both almost

4874
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:31,180
died fighting Nazis.

4875
02:16:31,330 --> 02:16:32,830
So I wanted to know about Nazis.

4876
02:16:33,210 --> 02:16:37,810
He was was this whole ethos and so that's
just the whole story of understanding

4877
02:16:37,811 --> 02:16:40,960
that and that my dad's angle and my
grandfather's angle and all these other

4878
02:16:40,961 --> 02:16:42,130
operation paperclip,

4879
02:16:42,790 --> 02:16:44,110
they didn't call it paper clip.

4880
02:16:44,111 --> 02:16:45,850
He said our government brought those.

4881
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,440
He you think he would
always say what's yeah,

4882
02:16:47,441 --> 02:16:48,280
but that's the,

4883
02:16:48,470 --> 02:16:49,990
I think there was several waves.

4884
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:51,940
There was like 34,000 of them.

4885
02:16:52,100 --> 02:16:52,261
Yeah.

4886
02:16:52,261 --> 02:16:55,720
There was a lot of fucking Nazi
scientists brought over like Youtube.

4887
02:16:55,721 --> 02:16:57,940
It says the operation paperclip was uh,

4888
02:16:58,210 --> 02:17:02,010
anywhere from like 1200 to 1500 searches.

4889
02:17:02,050 --> 02:17:04,600
The total number of admitted
congressional hearings

4890
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:10,900
in the 1970s paperclip Frank Church
committee in the 70s released it and I

4891
02:17:10,901 --> 02:17:12,340
believe the number is 34,000,

4892
02:17:12,341 --> 02:17:13,900
207 look it up.

4893
02:17:14,470 --> 02:17:14,711
There's a,

4894
02:17:14,711 --> 02:17:15,461
like I told you,

4895
02:17:15,461 --> 02:17:16,210
they give people samples.

4896
02:17:16,210 --> 02:17:16,870
You pulled it up.

4897
02:17:16,870 --> 02:17:18,610
But it is fascinating.

4898
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:20,610
They brought those people over
here and that's where the,

4899
02:17:20,670 --> 02:17:21,970
the space program came from.

4900
02:17:22,360 --> 02:17:22,721
Came from,

4901
02:17:22,721 --> 02:17:23,650
not tore the shirt,

4902
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:24,580
not as a sick joke.

4903
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:26,830
They already had the CIA.

4904
02:17:26,831 --> 02:17:27,664
That was LSS.

4905
02:17:29,470 --> 02:17:30,070
Okay.

4906
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:31,690
The CIA's Oss.

4907
02:17:32,230 --> 02:17:33,070
That's all on record.

4908
02:17:33,550 --> 02:17:34,090
Okay.

4909
02:17:34,090 --> 02:17:35,560
I'm glad you questioned me now,

4910
02:17:35,561 --> 02:17:36,480
but I don't know what that means.

4911
02:17:36,910 --> 02:17:37,960
What is oss again?

4912
02:17:38,290 --> 02:17:39,123
Uh,

4913
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:39,990
officers.

4914
02:17:39,990 --> 02:17:41,370
Special plans are off.

4915
02:17:41,380 --> 02:17:44,400
That was before the CIA and
the CIA clause of strategics,

4916
02:17:44,401 --> 02:17:47,770
so to like the office
of strategic services,

4917
02:17:48,010 --> 02:17:52,770
like what was before the seals would Jesse
Ventura was the frogs even terocin in

4918
02:17:52,780 --> 02:17:55,210
that he was an auxiliary of the navy.

4919
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:56,710
He was never in combat.

4920
02:17:56,950 --> 02:17:57,251
Anyways,

4921
02:17:57,251 --> 02:17:58,150
let me expand on that.

4922
02:17:58,930 --> 02:17:59,330
The uh,

4923
02:17:59,330 --> 02:18:00,660
the o s s t,

4924
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:05,080
the office of what is the
sheet on them refills.

4925
02:18:05,530 --> 02:18:05,741
The,

4926
02:18:05,741 --> 02:18:05,951
Oh,

4927
02:18:05,951 --> 02:18:08,560
ash ash was British intelligence
are the most powerful British,

4928
02:18:08,830 --> 02:18:10,290
the most powerful
intelligence agency ever.

4929
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:15,590
They set up proud house at 22 after
World War II to anglicize the u s with

4930
02:18:15,591 --> 02:18:16,271
British intelligence,

4931
02:18:16,271 --> 02:18:17,470
not a British intelligence take over.

4932
02:18:17,471 --> 02:18:19,270
Our marriage was dissolved.

4933
02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:20,470
This just like on PBS.

4934
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:21,071
Okay.

4935
02:18:21,071 --> 02:18:21,821
This just stuff that's true.

4936
02:18:21,821 --> 02:18:24,670
They've meant say they only
academics are watching it,

4937
02:18:24,671 --> 02:18:25,480
so it'll tell the truth.

4938
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:29,140
The general pop culture is all crap meant
to be dumbed down and to turn you off.

4939
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:31,810
But when you go to the real
academic stuff in the old days,

4940
02:18:31,811 --> 02:18:34,090
a frontline and stuff like I've
watched that to Novus true.

4941
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:34,960
Literally have the documents,

4942
02:18:34,961 --> 02:18:35,231
it's all,

4943
02:18:35,231 --> 02:18:35,771
it's all real.

4944
02:18:35,771 --> 02:18:36,370
That's like,

4945
02:18:36,370 --> 02:18:37,380
those shows were like really accurate.

4946
02:18:37,381 --> 02:18:39,980
Like Bobby Kennedy plan to blow
up the embassy and under Richard.

4947
02:18:39,981 --> 02:18:40,211
So like,

4948
02:18:40,211 --> 02:18:41,044
God,

4949
02:18:41,270 --> 02:18:42,103
what was I getting to?

4950
02:18:42,580 --> 02:18:44,170
I don't Nazis Nazis.

4951
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:47,580
Well one of them Ron and weird cliff.

4952
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:52,680
Isn't it weird that the one man who
directed all six moon missions was a Nazi

4953
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:53,913
and he was?

4954
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:55,560
Isn't that one?

4955
02:18:55,670 --> 02:18:56,680
Isn't that crazy?

4956
02:18:57,400 --> 02:18:58,300
Smoke weed.

4957
02:18:58,301 --> 02:18:59,530
And one guy's having a problem.

4958
02:18:59,531 --> 02:19:01,660
His memory two guys did.

4959
02:19:01,690 --> 02:19:03,520
And why you want to defend worn,

4960
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:04,633
not defending him.

4961
02:19:04,730 --> 02:19:05,460
It's fine.

4962
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:08,680
35 Nazis and I've seen dogs
were some reason rant about it.

4963
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:10,600
He sketched for Hitler,

4964
02:19:10,990 --> 02:19:15,010
this plan to drop atomic bombs
that they hadn't developed yet.

4965
02:19:15,011 --> 02:19:16,720
So when you see red skull marvel comic,

4966
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:18,490
they've got a big bomber to love New York.

4967
02:19:18,820 --> 02:19:19,720
It wasn't a bomber,

4968
02:19:19,721 --> 02:19:23,170
it was a space plane and
it was about half the size,

4969
02:19:23,171 --> 02:19:24,310
but it looks just like this.

4970
02:19:25,510 --> 02:19:28,370
And the Germans actually of their
scientists went to the Russians

4971
02:19:28,570 --> 02:19:30,430
or the Russians tried to
build their space shuttle.

4972
02:19:30,431 --> 02:19:31,264
It was half the size.

4973
02:19:31,670 --> 02:19:34,400
That was actually the German plan show.

4974
02:19:34,401 --> 02:19:35,480
So you look it up.

4975
02:19:35,481 --> 02:19:35,871
I'm not kidding.

4976
02:19:35,871 --> 02:19:37,760
Because the Russians took
a lot of Germans as well.

4977
02:19:37,790 --> 02:19:38,061
Correct.

4978
02:19:38,061 --> 02:19:38,640
About a third of them.

4979
02:19:38,640 --> 02:19:39,240
Yeah.

4980
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:40,073
So look,

4981
02:19:41,330 --> 02:19:42,740
the reason I'm wearing this is to explain,

4982
02:19:42,750 --> 02:19:43,700
this is a gateway to all of it.

4983
02:19:44,060 --> 02:19:47,090
So you have British intelligence
did a one world war one,

4984
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:49,670
Germany had way more advanced technology.

4985
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:53,540
They then take over British intelligence,

4986
02:19:53,541 --> 02:19:57,140
basically merges with the u s and
then the Germans and others say,

4987
02:19:57,141 --> 02:19:59,060
we've got to go way ahead in technology.

4988
02:19:59,210 --> 02:20:00,620
It was all theoretical and labs,

4989
02:20:00,621 --> 02:20:01,850
but they couldn't mass deploy it.

4990
02:20:02,050 --> 02:20:05,000
They didn't have enough machine
shops and systems to build it.

4991
02:20:05,150 --> 02:20:07,760
And US special forces went on suicide
missions and blew up the underground

4992
02:20:07,761 --> 02:20:08,120
mountains.

4993
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:12,380
How about the Nazis were the
first to build flying saucer.

4994
02:20:12,410 --> 02:20:13,243
Oh it.

4995
02:20:14,090 --> 02:20:14,923
But let me tell you,

4996
02:20:14,930 --> 02:20:15,770
that's crazy.

4997
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:17,480
Quinto British,

4998
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:21,920
British intelligence flying saucers.

4999
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:22,960
The CIA,

5000
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:24,230
the CIA in 47

5001
02:20:26,060 --> 02:20:28,010
so now the Nazis are
over here and they go,

5002
02:20:28,011 --> 02:20:28,341
listen,

5003
02:20:28,341 --> 02:20:29,930
you don't want them running everything.

5004
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:33,290
And they go to Eisenhower and they say,

5005
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:38,860
we want to launch a off breakaway
civilization where you compartmentalize

5006
02:20:39,891 --> 02:20:40,520
things,

5007
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:44,570
forget empires and you'd have a new
ruling class of technological elites and

5008
02:20:44,571 --> 02:20:48,170
then the elites are all in charge of
the public's watching TV and we'll give

5009
02:20:48,171 --> 02:20:51,070
them widgets and foundation
series type things at the verb.

5010
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:55,100
This is all the documents and
let them try to run an empire.

5011
02:20:55,101 --> 02:20:56,720
We'll build a whole new empire.

5012
02:20:57,170 --> 02:20:58,970
And so Eisenhower gives a speech,

5013
02:20:58,971 --> 02:20:59,804
worry about,

5014
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:01,240
he doesn't just say military
initial accomplished,

5015
02:21:01,241 --> 02:21:04,670
he says the technological elite
watch the full 21 minutes speech,

5016
02:21:04,671 --> 02:21:09,440
his farewell address and 62 he
says [inaudible] 60 61 he says,

5017
02:21:09,441 --> 02:21:13,850
you need to watch out about
the scientists because,

5018
02:21:14,060 --> 02:21:17,570
because he said no to the NASA
plan when he found out what it was.

5019
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:22,250
But is it's a breakaway civilization
where you don't try to run the whole

5020
02:21:22,251 --> 02:21:23,084
planet,

5021
02:21:23,330 --> 02:21:26,270
you siphon off resources and
build a whole new advanced system,

5022
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:28,760
and then you play or body off
against each other and collapse it.

5023
02:21:28,970 --> 02:21:29,803
So when I say,

5024
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:30,740
what is an asset,

5025
02:21:30,860 --> 02:21:32,690
if we could take NASA back over,

5026
02:21:32,870 --> 02:21:34,430
it's bigger than the CIA.

5027
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:35,810
It's the real government,

5028
02:21:35,990 --> 02:21:38,360
the spaceships and the
stuff that's all PR.

5029
02:21:38,420 --> 02:21:40,340
NASA is the real government.

5030
02:21:41,330 --> 02:21:42,050
NASA,

5031
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:44,600
there were two breakaway
governments to shadow governments.

5032
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:46,390
Brad talked about Saturday got,

5033
02:21:46,391 --> 02:21:47,224
but 20 years ago,

5034
02:21:47,660 --> 02:21:48,493
it's in the documents.

5035
02:21:49,580 --> 02:21:54,370
And so you had one that was British
run and the Germans came to the,

5036
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:55,970
our own us elites and said,

5037
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:57,050
hey,

5038
02:21:57,050 --> 02:21:58,400
you always need a couple of plants.

5039
02:21:58,880 --> 02:21:59,361
They said,

5040
02:21:59,361 --> 02:22:00,860
we've got all this on the drawing board,

5041
02:22:00,861 --> 02:22:01,730
the EU,

5042
02:22:02,210 --> 02:22:04,730
a plan to poison the food water
to get rid of the dumb people,

5043
02:22:04,970 --> 02:22:06,500
a plan for Offworld basis.

5044
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:07,341
We've got,

5045
02:22:07,341 --> 02:22:07,740
by the way,

5046
02:22:07,740 --> 02:22:10,130
we're taking hardcore drugs and
we're in contact with aliens.

5047
02:22:10,190 --> 02:22:11,210
How has it given us technique?

5048
02:22:11,220 --> 02:22:12,560
It was the Germans first got in touch.

5049
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:13,581
Well,

5050
02:22:13,581 --> 02:22:14,414
how'd they do it?

5051
02:22:15,030 --> 02:22:17,650
They were really a cult Briggs,

5052
02:22:17,740 --> 02:22:17,950
right?

5053
02:22:17,950 --> 02:22:18,200
Yeah.

5054
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:19,940
Really ended the it all the Indiana,

5055
02:22:20,150 --> 02:22:21,920
which is the shit around him at all times.

5056
02:22:21,921 --> 02:22:22,101
You know,

5057
02:22:22,101 --> 02:22:24,090
human sacrifices as legal shit.

5058
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:24,680
Yeah.

5059
02:22:24,680 --> 02:22:25,800
The society.

5060
02:22:26,240 --> 02:22:27,390
What I Alan you Joe,

5061
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:28,051
this is not me.

5062
02:22:28,051 --> 02:22:30,750
You go to the real deep
phd level history books.

5063
02:22:30,870 --> 02:22:31,500
Okay.

5064
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:35,130
NASA is the German breakaway government.

5065
02:22:35,490 --> 02:22:37,680
It's just always the Germans and
the Brits fighting for dominance.

5066
02:22:38,490 --> 02:22:42,510
So what you're saying is when operation
paper clip acquired all those Nazi

5067
02:22:42,511 --> 02:22:43,021
scientists,

5068
02:22:43,021 --> 02:22:44,700
they essentially started running NASA.

5069
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:48,480
So Nasa became like almost like an
offshoot of the German government.

5070
02:22:48,481 --> 02:22:49,560
This offshoot government.

5071
02:22:50,190 --> 02:22:50,491
Yeah.

5072
02:22:50,491 --> 02:22:52,680
The Germans had piled all the wealth away.

5073
02:22:53,100 --> 02:22:53,911
They had everything.

5074
02:22:53,911 --> 02:22:54,421
So they made,

5075
02:22:54,421 --> 02:22:55,710
does that really make sense though?

5076
02:22:55,711 --> 02:22:58,020
That in 2019 that's still going on?

5077
02:22:58,050 --> 02:22:58,171
No,

5078
02:22:58,171 --> 02:22:58,321
no,

5079
02:22:58,321 --> 02:22:58,441
no,

5080
02:22:58,441 --> 02:22:59,220
no.

5081
02:22:59,220 --> 02:23:00,360
The British intelligence,

5082
02:23:00,361 --> 02:23:01,590
does it run the CIA today?

5083
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:06,900
The British empire was under attack and
just bankrupted itself and World War One

5084
02:23:07,110 --> 02:23:07,501
it said,

5085
02:23:07,501 --> 02:23:08,940
we'll give you the keys of the kingdom.

5086
02:23:09,630 --> 02:23:11,030
Churchill wrote three bucks.

5087
02:23:11,310 --> 02:23:11,730
Uh,

5088
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:13,410
the history of the
English speaking peoples,

5089
02:23:13,411 --> 02:23:16,620
he was half American and
this is officially in books.

5090
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:21,540
We merge with the British
empire and like 1930 covertly.

5091
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:22,471
Okay.

5092
02:23:22,471 --> 02:23:23,550
That's what the CFR is,

5093
02:23:23,580 --> 02:23:25,590
is British intelligence
that US intelligence.

5094
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:27,150
So the u s runs the show.

5095
02:23:28,380 --> 02:23:29,213
Okay,

5096
02:23:29,310 --> 02:23:30,060
so you've got,

5097
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:33,900
you've got German intelligence
came to Eisenhower and said,

5098
02:23:33,901 --> 02:23:34,734
listen,

5099
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:36,890
you don't need to do all this year.

5100
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:38,490
We haven't given them a real technology.

5101
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:42,640
We're in contact with aliens
and they've dealt with it.

5102
02:23:42,650 --> 02:23:43,200
The whole plan.

5103
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:44,250
Where are you getting this from?

5104
02:23:44,251 --> 02:23:47,730
The stadium so confidently
it's in the literature man.

5105
02:23:47,731 --> 02:23:49,380
Hitler like would go literature,

5106
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:54,060
mainline historical books
about as mainstream as castles,

5107
02:23:54,061 --> 02:23:54,930
where they go,

5108
02:23:54,931 --> 02:23:56,030
the aliens want bloods.

5109
02:23:56,031 --> 02:23:58,450
So they'd killed like 20 kids and
everything's aliens would like,

5110
02:23:58,470 --> 02:23:59,410
she'll come in and kill,

5111
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:00,510
they taking the blood,

5112
02:24:00,511 --> 02:24:03,600
brings him in like sharks and then
they want to give them technology.

5113
02:24:03,601 --> 02:24:03,841
They go,

5114
02:24:03,841 --> 02:24:04,601
this is how it works.

5115
02:24:04,601 --> 02:24:05,910
She built the atomic weapons this way.

5116
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:08,730
He built it and they would like show
him bombers and like the aliens are like

5117
02:24:08,731 --> 02:24:09,330
telepathic.

5118
02:24:09,330 --> 02:24:10,230
I don't even believe this.

5119
02:24:10,231 --> 02:24:13,110
This is what the Nazis bleed and the and
the aliens with MindMeld and give them

5120
02:24:13,111 --> 02:24:13,651
the technology.

5121
02:24:13,651 --> 02:24:14,484
They're bad aliens.

5122
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:17,670
So they are you surprised the
Nazis were influenced by demons?

5123
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:19,790
Know if demons are real,

5124
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:21,600
definitely think they'd be
on the side of the Nazis.

5125
02:24:22,300 --> 02:24:22,771
But Joe,

5126
02:24:22,771 --> 02:24:23,610
what I'm telling you,

5127
02:24:23,611 --> 02:24:25,550
if the aliens will be no media,

5128
02:24:25,590 --> 02:24:27,270
no media is going to attack this.

5129
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:29,880
I'm giving you want to
know where I can read it.

5130
02:24:30,090 --> 02:24:31,020
Where can I read that?

5131
02:24:31,290 --> 02:24:32,220
Those statements,

5132
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:33,900
because they were in
contact with the aliens.

5133
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:35,033
Obviously your pocket

5134
02:24:36,820 --> 02:24:37,710
real society,

5135
02:24:37,711 --> 02:24:40,580
the l group,

5136
02:24:40,660 --> 02:24:42,030
the chick aliens.

5137
02:24:42,060 --> 02:24:43,770
That's the only lens
right up there with them.

5138
02:24:43,771 --> 02:24:45,630
Like doing for three hours.

5139
02:24:45,850 --> 02:24:48,300
If acting fly here with
a report the day before,

5140
02:24:48,310 --> 02:24:50,610
I'll send it all to you
with mainline books.

5141
02:24:50,740 --> 02:24:51,040
I'll see.

5142
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:52,800
I'll mail the books with the tabs in them.

5143
02:24:52,830 --> 02:24:53,101
Okay.

5144
02:24:53,101 --> 02:24:54,030
And I'll mail documents.

5145
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:54,720
Okay,

5146
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:55,170
cool.

5147
02:24:55,170 --> 02:24:55,840
Yeah,

5148
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:56,760
I'll listen.

5149
02:24:56,761 --> 02:24:59,310
I think that they are absolutely
obsessed with the occult.

5150
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:00,940
That's been pretty well documented.

5151
02:25:00,941 --> 02:25:02,970
They made flying saucers and I think,

5152
02:25:02,971 --> 02:25:03,300
yeah,

5153
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:07,920
and I think government Zay developed
a more advanced form of nuclear fuel,

5154
02:25:08,370 --> 02:25:09,210
heavy water.

5155
02:25:09,690 --> 02:25:13,110
And we had to sit in special forces on
suicide missions back when was really

5156
02:25:13,111 --> 02:25:15,150
special for us to blow it up.

5157
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:15,721
And,

5158
02:25:15,721 --> 02:25:15,911
and,

5159
02:25:15,911 --> 02:25:16,621
and I'm telling you,

5160
02:25:16,621 --> 02:25:19,470
the Germans had all
sorts of advanced shit.

5161
02:25:19,471 --> 02:25:22,740
They just couldn't ever keep the plants
from getting blown up because they were

5162
02:25:22,741 --> 02:25:23,770
a few behind.

5163
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:24,440
Yeah.

5164
02:25:24,440 --> 02:25:24,671
And,

5165
02:25:24,671 --> 02:25:24,861
and,

5166
02:25:24,861 --> 02:25:25,041
and,

5167
02:25:25,041 --> 02:25:25,874
and by the light.

5168
02:25:27,390 --> 02:25:28,040
Okay.

5169
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:28,670
Uh,

5170
02:25:28,670 --> 02:25:32,660
Churchill wrote about this in his memoirs
and said the Germans were way ahead.

5171
02:25:33,050 --> 02:25:34,440
It wasn't the Germans were path,

5172
02:25:34,441 --> 02:25:35,274
if it's not super bad,

5173
02:25:35,570 --> 02:25:36,510
but it wasn't that,

5174
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:41,450
it wasn't the Germans that first
bomb civilian targets in 1941,

5175
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:43,040
the Brits were losing the war.

5176
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:45,500
Hitler was bombing their for
their medical facilities,

5177
02:25:45,530 --> 02:25:46,400
military facilities,

5178
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:47,300
and,

5179
02:25:47,300 --> 02:25:52,250
and so they went and bombed
German towns and German shit.

5180
02:25:52,251 --> 02:25:52,790
He's like,

5181
02:25:52,790 --> 02:25:53,623
uh,

5182
02:25:53,960 --> 02:25:55,160
I was a famous German city,

5183
02:25:55,161 --> 02:25:55,910
Dresden.

5184
02:25:55,910 --> 02:25:58,220
What was the designated
a safe city for kids.

5185
02:25:58,610 --> 02:26:03,470
Half a million people died in one night
to trick Hitler to turn his bombers on

5186
02:26:03,471 --> 02:26:04,540
the general population.

5187
02:26:04,541 --> 02:26:06,050
And they tricked him
psychologically to do it.

5188
02:26:06,950 --> 02:26:07,311
But,

5189
02:26:07,311 --> 02:26:07,521
but,

5190
02:26:07,521 --> 02:26:07,701
but,

5191
02:26:07,701 --> 02:26:08,570
but Churchill,

5192
02:26:09,620 --> 02:26:10,680
this has been declassified.

5193
02:26:10,700 --> 02:26:10,840
It's,

5194
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:10,991
it's,

5195
02:26:10,991 --> 02:26:12,110
it's an esoteric books.

5196
02:26:12,111 --> 02:26:12,860
It's admitted.

5197
02:26:12,860 --> 02:26:14,300
So Hitler was set up.

5198
02:26:14,380 --> 02:26:14,610
Well,

5199
02:26:14,610 --> 02:26:15,321
it was bad.

5200
02:26:15,321 --> 02:26:16,154
But here's what happened.

5201
02:26:16,670 --> 02:26:21,590
Albert Speer was his chief armaments
and architects administered at British

5202
02:26:21,591 --> 02:26:22,424
double agent.

5203
02:26:23,330 --> 02:26:25,430
Rudolf Hess was the deputy fuhrer.

5204
02:26:26,030 --> 02:26:26,691
The got Hitler.

5205
02:26:26,691 --> 02:26:27,530
Totally love you.

5206
02:26:27,531 --> 02:26:31,640
Never hear about him since 1941 because
they had a peace treaty with Edward the

5207
02:26:31,641 --> 02:26:32,474
eighth,

5208
02:26:32,510 --> 02:26:33,800
who was the king of England,

5209
02:26:34,550 --> 02:26:38,120
who was a Nazi and who was
German parish family German.

5210
02:26:38,690 --> 02:26:41,450
And they had a deal to stage the attack.

5211
02:26:41,510 --> 02:26:43,700
The French stood down
Vichy French didn't fight.

5212
02:26:43,910 --> 02:26:44,300
They put,

5213
02:26:44,300 --> 02:26:46,950
they put Nazi occupiers in the,

5214
02:26:46,951 --> 02:26:47,110
the,

5215
02:26:47,110 --> 02:26:49,430
the Dunkirk operation
was allowed to evacuate.

5216
02:26:49,820 --> 02:26:53,510
Edward the eight was supposed to then sue
for peace through Neville Chamberlain.

5217
02:26:54,440 --> 02:26:56,900
But it's come out that it was all
set up by Churchill and others.

5218
02:26:57,050 --> 02:26:58,150
Now that they ran Hitler.

5219
02:26:58,210 --> 02:26:58,971
Now they weren't bad.

5220
02:26:58,971 --> 02:26:59,804
They were pretty good,

5221
02:26:59,870 --> 02:27:04,120
but they master manipulated
him and never Chamberlain,

5222
02:27:04,130 --> 02:27:07,070
all of them and bet on the British
people in America to come in.

5223
02:27:07,340 --> 02:27:08,001
They had deals with,

5224
02:27:08,001 --> 02:27:08,150
uh,

5225
02:27:08,150 --> 02:27:08,380
with,

5226
02:27:08,380 --> 02:27:09,140
uh,

5227
02:27:09,140 --> 02:27:12,800
with the Roosevelt to then
bring us into the war.

5228
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:14,990
And that was the whole master plan.

5229
02:27:14,991 --> 02:27:17,510
And you can actually go to
the history and see all that.

5230
02:27:17,511 --> 02:27:18,291
And that's what's so incredible.

5231
02:27:18,291 --> 02:27:18,770
Joe,

5232
02:27:18,770 --> 02:27:19,051
when you,

5233
02:27:19,051 --> 02:27:19,380
when you,

5234
02:27:19,380 --> 02:27:20,690
when you have all this info,

5235
02:27:20,870 --> 02:27:25,870
and so Rudolf Hess in 1941 or
42 he flies a one man bomber.

5236
02:27:27,261 --> 02:27:30,170
He was a world war one fighter
race like the number three,

5237
02:27:30,171 --> 02:27:31,910
eight a hundred and some aircraft.

5238
02:27:31,970 --> 02:27:32,651
Look it up Rudolph,

5239
02:27:32,651 --> 02:27:34,490
as he flies in,

5240
02:27:34,491 --> 02:27:39,290
parachutes into the castle.

5241
02:27:39,291 --> 02:27:42,530
The king was in at the time
in like northern England,

5242
02:27:42,531 --> 02:27:43,364
I forget the name of it.

5243
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:47,990
He parachutes in with the peace
treaty shined by the King of England.

5244
02:27:48,830 --> 02:27:53,210
They lock him up in the tower for
the rest of his life in London

5245
02:27:55,070 --> 02:27:55,431
and ever.

5246
02:27:55,431 --> 02:28:00,431
The aide had to advocate type in Edward
d eight Hitler and you'll see him in

5247
02:28:00,861 --> 02:28:02,870
videos or films and photos.

5248
02:28:03,530 --> 02:28:05,420
He was in Spain when World War II started.

5249
02:28:05,930 --> 02:28:08,180
Where do you think the contact
with the aliens came from?

5250
02:28:08,840 --> 02:28:09,680
When did that start?

5251
02:28:09,720 --> 02:28:10,040
All right.

5252
02:28:10,040 --> 02:28:11,270
This is the most important thing.

5253
02:28:11,271 --> 02:28:12,710
We're not aliens landing.

5254
02:28:12,720 --> 02:28:13,220
Hold on.

5255
02:28:13,220 --> 02:28:13,521
Hold on.

5256
02:28:13,521 --> 02:28:14,660
Interdimensional dimensional aliens.

5257
02:28:15,410 --> 02:28:16,340
Alien means anything.

5258
02:28:16,341 --> 02:28:17,174
Not of this world.

5259
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:17,540
What?

5260
02:28:17,540 --> 02:28:18,080
When was,

5261
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:18,913
when did that happen?

5262
02:28:19,020 --> 02:28:21,020
Sketched that motherfucking fuck code.

5263
02:28:21,540 --> 02:28:22,110
No,

5264
02:28:22,110 --> 02:28:23,860
no big block.

5265
02:28:23,910 --> 02:28:24,340
Look,

5266
02:28:24,340 --> 02:28:25,173
it's fake.

5267
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:26,930
I need to hear about aliens,

5268
02:28:28,210 --> 02:28:29,270
but I don't smoke marijuana.

5269
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:30,493
Yeah,

5270
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:33,350
this is just a cigar.

5271
02:28:33,370 --> 02:28:35,150
You know what's crazy about aliens?

5272
02:28:35,480 --> 02:28:39,680
Is it a youtube made a big announcement
that they're going to go after at nine

5273
02:28:39,681 --> 02:28:40,580
11 videos?

5274
02:28:40,730 --> 02:28:41,540
Anything.

5275
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:42,500
I don't know if this is true.

5276
02:28:42,710 --> 02:28:43,070
I don't know.

5277
02:28:43,070 --> 02:28:48,070
But is it true that they're demonetizing
any videos that have truth or liberty

5278
02:28:48,291 --> 02:28:48,680
in them?

5279
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:49,250
Is that true?

5280
02:28:49,250 --> 02:28:50,083
Yes,

5281
02:28:50,300 --> 02:28:50,661
that's true.

5282
02:28:50,661 --> 02:28:51,351
But I heard that.

5283
02:28:51,351 --> 02:28:52,300
Well that sounds crazy.

5284
02:28:53,150 --> 02:28:53,983
Hold on,

5285
02:28:54,740 --> 02:28:55,100
hold on,

5286
02:28:55,100 --> 02:28:55,581
let me finish.

5287
02:28:55,581 --> 02:28:56,414
Let me finish real quick.

5288
02:28:57,590 --> 02:29:01,160
It's crazy how they're going
after nine 11 miracle Cure.

5289
02:29:03,220 --> 02:29:05,990
They're blowing up alien videos.

5290
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:08,180
It's wonderful.

5291
02:29:08,240 --> 02:29:11,420
He'll get the strongest
monetize videos out there.

5292
02:29:11,480 --> 02:29:11,930
I Dunno,

5293
02:29:11,930 --> 02:29:13,280
but none of it's true.

5294
02:29:13,310 --> 02:29:15,440
The stronger it is.

5295
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:16,030
Well,

5296
02:29:16,030 --> 02:29:17,130
there's a lot of videos out there.

5297
02:29:17,300 --> 02:29:20,480
[inaudible] the best deals at the top,

5298
02:29:20,690 --> 02:29:21,850
top of the line spot.

5299
02:29:22,180 --> 02:29:23,120
I'll tell you when Eddie's right.

5300
02:29:23,121 --> 02:29:25,890
I actually know the numbers
that blowing up alien videos.

5301
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:30,200
It was a little kid who makes $22
million a year reviewing toys.

5302
02:29:30,290 --> 02:29:30,441
No,

5303
02:29:30,441 --> 02:29:30,800
no.

5304
02:29:30,800 --> 02:29:31,940
That's like the number one.

5305
02:29:32,150 --> 02:29:33,920
Isn't he like one of the
number one guys on Youtube.

5306
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:35,113
He's like eight.

5307
02:29:35,630 --> 02:29:40,340
I'm saying alien videos get
monetized by high level sponsors.

5308
02:29:40,341 --> 02:29:41,520
The high level one cause that's what I,

5309
02:29:41,870 --> 02:29:42,703
they're not,

5310
02:29:43,450 --> 02:29:44,480
they're not offensive.

5311
02:29:44,481 --> 02:29:45,710
People get drawn into them,

5312
02:29:45,740 --> 02:29:47,810
but they send me the
governments covering this up.

5313
02:29:48,170 --> 02:29:49,940
Why ain't they shutting that shit down?

5314
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Cause they're talking about
that the government is lying
and covering it because

5315
02:29:53,060 --> 02:29:53,810
it's funny,

5316
02:29:53,810 --> 02:29:54,700
but it's hysterical.

5317
02:29:54,870 --> 02:29:55,703
Right.

5318
02:29:55,880 --> 02:29:57,920
How did the connection with aliens start?

5319
02:29:57,950 --> 02:30:02,570
You said this is the most important
thing you'd discuss on the podcast and I

5320
02:30:02,660 --> 02:30:04,040
love you to death if you're awesome.

5321
02:30:04,041 --> 02:30:05,030
That's why I asked for you to be here.

5322
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:06,350
If you want to believe in aliens,

5323
02:30:06,380 --> 02:30:07,070
I'm cool with that.

5324
02:30:07,070 --> 02:30:07,791
I still love you.

5325
02:30:07,791 --> 02:30:08,624
I don't care.

5326
02:30:09,500 --> 02:30:10,430
I don't care about that.

5327
02:30:10,700 --> 02:30:11,031
I said I'm,

5328
02:30:11,031 --> 02:30:12,020
this is not what I believe.

5329
02:30:12,050 --> 02:30:12,710
Okay.

5330
02:30:12,710 --> 02:30:14,620
I love you for who you ought to do.

5331
02:30:15,380 --> 02:30:16,400
I'm trying to tell you something.

5332
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:17,150
Listen man,

5333
02:30:17,150 --> 02:30:17,983
let me tell you shot.

5334
02:30:18,950 --> 02:30:19,670
Let me tell you something.

5335
02:30:19,670 --> 02:30:20,503
Okay?

5336
02:30:20,570 --> 02:30:21,710
I'm not making this stuff up.

5337
02:30:22,100 --> 02:30:23,420
I believe you believe it.

5338
02:30:23,810 --> 02:30:24,140
No,

5339
02:30:24,140 --> 02:30:25,850
I mean there's stuff I told
you earlier about my dad.

5340
02:30:25,851 --> 02:30:29,780
At the table being offered half $1
million in 1980 Shirley that build cyborgs

5341
02:30:29,790 --> 02:30:30,270
and apparel.

5342
02:30:30,270 --> 02:30:30,440
No,

5343
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:31,580
he wasn't here for that part.

5344
02:30:31,640 --> 02:30:32,150
Okay.

5345
02:30:32,150 --> 02:30:32,870
He came in later.

5346
02:30:32,870 --> 02:30:35,750
But tell me how the connection
with aliens cuts started

5347
02:30:37,550 --> 02:30:39,560
with who connection aliens and unnatural.

5348
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:43,040
When people started becoming obsessed
with contact with the aliens,

5349
02:30:43,250 --> 02:30:46,850
he was saying in 1947 still
have some sort of a connection,

5350
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:49,490
you know Eddie's right.

5351
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:53,420
They flood youtube and mainstream media
like they always thought it was safe.

5352
02:30:53,421 --> 02:30:55,190
I thought about the private Federal
Reserve that the world order,

5353
02:30:55,191 --> 02:30:56,330
if I went on some big show,

5354
02:30:56,540 --> 02:30:57,940
as long as it makes
the aliens and with it.

5355
02:30:58,160 --> 02:30:59,390
And it was never the alien guy.

5356
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:00,201
Right.

5357
02:31:00,201 --> 02:31:00,930
I've never been the big alien.

5358
02:31:00,930 --> 02:31:02,660
He never had a few years ago with you.

5359
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:04,670
And you know what I that's right.

5360
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:08,420
I remember when I was balls deep in
aliens cause I believed all that shit.

5361
02:31:08,421 --> 02:31:12,680
I believe it used to be that you'd be a
conspiracy theorist if you believe that

5362
02:31:12,681 --> 02:31:13,880
aliens but an hour anymore.

5363
02:31:13,940 --> 02:31:15,560
But now if you believe in aliens,

5364
02:31:15,880 --> 02:31:16,280
verticals,

5365
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:17,680
Paris right now.

5366
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:18,021
Okay,

5367
02:31:18,021 --> 02:31:18,470
but let,

5368
02:31:18,470 --> 02:31:20,430
let's tell me how the connection

5369
02:31:20,430 --> 02:31:22,680
between aliens and the Nazis took place.

5370
02:31:22,681 --> 02:31:23,550
When did all this start?

5371
02:31:23,730 --> 02:31:23,980
Let me,

5372
02:31:23,980 --> 02:31:24,813
let me begin

5373
02:31:26,530 --> 02:31:26,791
this.

5374
02:31:26,791 --> 02:31:27,450
Just really,

5375
02:31:27,450 --> 02:31:27,961
I'm telling you,

5376
02:31:27,961 --> 02:31:28,111
Joe,

5377
02:31:28,111 --> 02:31:28,920
this is a real deal.

5378
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:29,490
I believe you.

5379
02:31:29,490 --> 02:31:30,251
This is you asked,

5380
02:31:30,251 --> 02:31:31,084
who are they?

5381
02:31:31,710 --> 02:31:34,380
It's people who are psychically,

5382
02:31:34,381 --> 02:31:39,381
genetically available to interface in
this incredibly diverse universe with all

5383
02:31:40,591 --> 02:31:45,591
these dimensions above and below and all
around us with consciousnesses and the

5384
02:31:45,841 --> 02:31:47,370
truth has no energies ever destroyed.

5385
02:31:47,371 --> 02:31:48,390
It all continues on.

5386
02:31:48,930 --> 02:31:50,060
The truth is our bodies.

5387
02:31:50,061 --> 02:31:55,061
This is a fact or a communal hive organism
of all of our ancestors and all of

5388
02:31:56,791 --> 02:31:58,440
their race memories,

5389
02:31:58,710 --> 02:32:02,010
but not in just some
compressed epigenetic system.

5390
02:32:02,011 --> 02:32:02,880
It's beyond that.

5391
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:05,940
It's an electro chemical antenna.

5392
02:32:05,941 --> 02:32:06,840
They've proven this,

5393
02:32:07,110 --> 02:32:11,860
that connects to higher and lower
dimensions show our body shoot cause our

5394
02:32:11,861 --> 02:32:12,061
cause,

5395
02:32:12,061 --> 02:32:12,541
our our,

5396
02:32:12,541 --> 02:32:12,811
our,

5397
02:32:12,811 --> 02:32:13,561
our predecessors.

5398
02:32:13,561 --> 02:32:16,070
What Buddhists the position
without giving us a bodysuit.

5399
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:16,651
That is them.

5400
02:32:16,651 --> 02:32:18,150
Our families are loving us.

5401
02:32:18,390 --> 02:32:19,350
They're holding us.

5402
02:32:19,590 --> 02:32:20,760
They're wrapped all around us.

5403
02:32:20,761 --> 02:32:21,720
Their strength or we'll,

5404
02:32:21,721 --> 02:32:22,201
they're bad.

5405
02:32:22,201 --> 02:32:22,830
They're good,

5406
02:32:22,830 --> 02:32:23,581
their sins,

5407
02:32:23,581 --> 02:32:24,570
the good things they did,

5408
02:32:24,750 --> 02:32:25,231
the battles,

5409
02:32:25,231 --> 02:32:25,561
they won,

5410
02:32:25,561 --> 02:32:26,400
the battles they lost.

5411
02:32:26,401 --> 02:32:26,731
The woman,

5412
02:32:26,731 --> 02:32:28,380
they love the the man they love.

5413
02:32:28,410 --> 02:32:29,670
It's all in us.

5414
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:30,691
All these people.

5415
02:32:30,691 --> 02:32:33,540
It's while we're able to look into so
many things and have so many different

5416
02:32:33,541 --> 02:32:36,360
experiences and so all the Shaman,

5417
02:32:36,361 --> 02:32:37,290
all the ancient religions,

5418
02:32:37,291 --> 02:32:40,830
everybody says there are the good ones
and there are the bad ones and the,

5419
02:32:40,831 --> 02:32:41,880
and people are interfacing.

5420
02:32:41,881 --> 02:32:42,331
So you say,

5421
02:32:42,331 --> 02:32:43,200
where does it begin?

5422
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:46,080
From the Tibetans to the Mezzo Americans,

5423
02:32:46,090 --> 02:32:46,980
to the Egyptians,

5424
02:32:46,981 --> 02:32:50,670
to the drew edge to every ancient
society describes the same thing.

5425
02:32:50,910 --> 02:32:54,270
There are bad things that looked like els
that have horns when they show you who

5426
02:32:54,271 --> 02:32:56,430
they really are and there are good things,

5427
02:32:56,431 --> 02:33:00,300
but they don't contact you unless
you contact them and then they,

5428
02:33:00,450 --> 02:33:02,220
they're almost not even
concerned with what you're doing.

5429
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:04,620
I never bought into this look to do it,

5430
02:33:04,890 --> 02:33:06,720
but then I'm beginning to think
about what I hear when I was a kid.

5431
02:33:06,721 --> 02:33:07,554
What did I see?

5432
02:33:07,740 --> 02:33:08,521
What was coming on?

5433
02:33:08,521 --> 02:33:09,331
Government documents,

5434
02:33:09,331 --> 02:33:12,120
what was being admitted when I read all
these books about World War II and the

5435
02:33:12,121 --> 02:33:16,410
Nazis and Hitler obsessed with the Dalai
Lama and the Tibetans and what they

5436
02:33:16,411 --> 02:33:20,460
were able to do without drugs to interface
with this and all the rituals they

5437
02:33:20,461 --> 02:33:23,130
would do and how they were
believed that beyond the ether,

5438
02:33:23,250 --> 02:33:24,150
like at skull and bones,

5439
02:33:24,151 --> 02:33:25,020
it's a German death coat.

5440
02:33:25,320 --> 02:33:28,200
They do rituals and take drugs
to talk to the goddesses.

5441
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:28,711
Well,

5442
02:33:28,711 --> 02:33:29,820
there's just appearing as you know,

5443
02:33:29,821 --> 02:33:30,241
sexy,

5444
02:33:30,241 --> 02:33:31,074
beautiful women.

5445
02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:36,260
It's whatever you want as the spirit
guides because lower entities will come in

5446
02:33:36,481 --> 02:33:37,830
and violate your free will,

5447
02:33:38,190 --> 02:33:39,870
God and his angels,

5448
02:33:39,871 --> 02:33:44,070
which are below him will not get
involved in your everyday life.

5449
02:33:44,310 --> 02:33:47,580
They will not manipulate your
freewill unless you asked them in.

5450
02:33:47,940 --> 02:33:49,980
But then the devil masquerades
as an angel of light.

5451
02:33:50,130 --> 02:33:51,180
So we're on this planet.

5452
02:33:51,181 --> 02:33:51,901
The third dimension,

5453
02:33:51,901 --> 02:33:53,570
which is a launchpad,

5454
02:33:53,610 --> 02:33:54,960
all the other dimensions below and above.

5455
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:57,300
The third dimension all
about that it shows is,

5456
02:33:57,540 --> 02:34:01,350
is the primal she of where
all this happens in the earth,

5457
02:34:01,351 --> 02:34:05,970
like an egg and we've got all this
potentiality and God will send out a

5458
02:34:05,971 --> 02:34:09,600
transmission for a larger plan but is
willing to come in and what does it say?

5459
02:34:09,601 --> 02:34:10,321
Demoralize,

5460
02:34:10,321 --> 02:34:11,041
get rid of children,

5461
02:34:11,041 --> 02:34:11,820
don't have kids.

5462
02:34:11,820 --> 02:34:12,690
He owns her bad.

5463
02:34:12,810 --> 02:34:14,520
You will be will be better
once you're all gone.

5464
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:19,630
And it's because it's their mission for
whatever reason that will understand

5465
02:34:19,631 --> 02:34:20,500
later what's going on.

5466
02:34:20,740 --> 02:34:21,580
So the Nazis,

5467
02:34:21,581 --> 02:34:22,600
if you get the deep literature,

5468
02:34:23,230 --> 02:34:24,063
they believed,

5469
02:34:24,400 --> 02:34:27,390
they were basically say on seeing and,

5470
02:34:27,391 --> 02:34:27,691
and,

5471
02:34:27,691 --> 02:34:27,931
and,

5472
02:34:27,931 --> 02:34:30,610
and being possessed by entities that,

5473
02:34:30,640 --> 02:34:32,420
I mean it was before the
Nazis for whatever reason,

5474
02:34:32,421 --> 02:34:35,620
it was the Germans that this
happened to and the Swiss light,

5475
02:34:35,650 --> 02:34:38,320
they didn't discover Lsd
in the thirties these,

5476
02:34:38,321 --> 02:34:40,480
these people were running
the psychology departments.

5477
02:34:40,480 --> 02:34:42,580
They were interfacing with the occult.

5478
02:34:42,850 --> 02:34:46,870
They were involved in all this crazy
stuff and that was all about their power

5479
02:34:46,871 --> 02:34:47,810
and how great they were going to be.

5480
02:34:47,990 --> 02:34:51,970
The Germans were seduced and they were
seduced because they had high iqs.

5481
02:34:51,971 --> 02:34:52,804
But more than that,

5482
02:34:52,840 --> 02:34:56,890
they were psychically connected to
each other and would work like robots.

5483
02:34:57,060 --> 02:35:02,020
The this Chinese and the EU want robots
replaces cause they'll follow orders and

5484
02:35:02,021 --> 02:35:04,230
the Chinese are very conscious
when they're conscious.

5485
02:35:04,260 --> 02:35:05,140
They're also very robotic.

5486
02:35:05,620 --> 02:35:07,630
But the Germans are just as robotics.

5487
02:35:07,631 --> 02:35:12,631
So this entity system pick Germans
as its attempt even in World War One,

5488
02:35:12,641 --> 02:35:13,474
World War II.

5489
02:35:13,630 --> 02:35:16,870
And it was been to putting the bricks
as well and offering them technologies,

5490
02:35:16,871 --> 02:35:17,920
but two different paths.

5491
02:35:18,220 --> 02:35:21,010
One was social control and also
their stuff with the Brits.

5492
02:35:21,011 --> 02:35:25,420
The other was high tech weapons systems
interdimensional with the Germans.

5493
02:35:25,660 --> 02:35:27,790
And so whoever these players are,

5494
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:29,430
and you can dial into it,

5495
02:35:29,431 --> 02:35:30,280
it's very dangerous.

5496
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:33,370
They're manipulating the British
arm versus the German arm.

5497
02:35:33,670 --> 02:35:37,030
And then they've got the Chinese arm
that's almost seen as like their robot

5498
02:35:37,031 --> 02:35:37,800
army.

5499
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:38,271
And,

5500
02:35:38,271 --> 02:35:38,550
and,

5501
02:35:38,550 --> 02:35:38,861
and,

5502
02:35:38,861 --> 02:35:40,030
and so when you study it,

5503
02:35:40,031 --> 02:35:45,031
the globalist go to these events and they
take bigger and bigger doses of drugs.

5504
02:35:46,151 --> 02:35:47,200
They do electroshock.

5505
02:35:47,700 --> 02:35:47,890
Uh,

5506
02:35:47,890 --> 02:35:48,280
if you go back,

5507
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:48,881
the owners of time,

5508
02:35:48,881 --> 02:35:52,240
life books didn't work just in the
twenties and thirties and LSD and other

5509
02:35:52,241 --> 02:35:54,100
hallucinogens and apothecary.

5510
02:35:54,101 --> 02:35:55,630
They weren't dealing electro shock.

5511
02:35:55,660 --> 02:35:56,260
They were,

5512
02:35:56,260 --> 02:35:56,620
they were,

5513
02:35:56,620 --> 02:35:59,680
they were having people turn their heart
off to like try to communicate with

5514
02:35:59,681 --> 02:36:00,370
these sayings,

5515
02:36:00,370 --> 02:36:02,410
to try to be dominant and get that.

5516
02:36:02,411 --> 02:36:03,700
So you go back thousands of years,

5517
02:36:04,320 --> 02:36:05,090
Merlin,

5518
02:36:05,090 --> 02:36:05,260
you know,

5519
02:36:05,260 --> 02:36:06,790
the archetypal or or,

5520
02:36:06,791 --> 02:36:06,971
or,

5521
02:36:06,971 --> 02:36:08,560
or these magicians or these,

5522
02:36:08,710 --> 02:36:13,710
these wizards are taking drugs in these
temples and interfacing with these

5523
02:36:13,751 --> 02:36:15,280
Palentier is these crystal balls,

5524
02:36:15,550 --> 02:36:16,600
which aren't really crystal balls.

5525
02:36:16,601 --> 02:36:19,840
It's their psychic focus
of an interdimensional
connection while they're on

5526
02:36:19,841 --> 02:36:20,081
drugs,

5527
02:36:20,081 --> 02:36:24,760
looking into glass to then be able to
see the future and understand what's

5528
02:36:24,761 --> 02:36:27,520
happening to give them temporal
power over this planet.

5529
02:36:27,880 --> 02:36:31,180
But like the Bible tells you any Pharma
key or any of that always leads to

5530
02:36:31,181 --> 02:36:34,210
destruction because only evil is
going to come through that way.

5531
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:37,030
So we're basically have
these light sockets.

5532
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:39,430
We can't Jack into the higher,

5533
02:36:39,431 --> 02:36:40,240
let's start freewill.

5534
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:41,073
And that takes time.

5535
02:36:41,650 --> 02:36:45,070
We Jack in to the evil so
you can Jackie and to evil,

5536
02:36:45,071 --> 02:36:47,110
you can't Jack into good right away.

5537
02:36:47,111 --> 02:36:47,741
So it's quicker.

5538
02:36:47,741 --> 02:36:48,221
It's easier.

5539
02:36:48,221 --> 02:36:49,630
Like Yoda says about Darth Vader,

5540
02:36:49,870 --> 02:36:50,201
quicker,

5541
02:36:50,201 --> 02:36:50,531
easier,

5542
02:36:50,531 --> 02:36:51,364
more seductive.

5543
02:36:52,120 --> 02:36:54,640
And so then I'm going to be in a kid and,

5544
02:36:54,641 --> 02:36:55,660
and and my parents,

5545
02:36:55,790 --> 02:36:56,820
they don't really get mad about this.

5546
02:36:56,821 --> 02:36:58,420
It's whatever they even know what
they were hearing at the time.

5547
02:36:58,690 --> 02:37:01,450
But they had friends that they knew
at ut that we're involved in research

5548
02:37:01,451 --> 02:37:02,970
projects and then,

5549
02:37:02,971 --> 02:37:07,030
and then they were nine times out of 10
I wrote about research projects in San

5550
02:37:07,030 --> 02:37:07,210
Francisco.

5551
02:37:07,210 --> 02:37:08,200
Ut has some,

5552
02:37:08,201 --> 02:37:11,320
MIT has a lot and shop anytime you want,

5553
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:16,100
but this was in like
the 60s they had virtual

5554
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:20,540
reality gloves where you'd put them on
and put goggles on and you'd go into

5555
02:37:20,541 --> 02:37:22,490
stuff that looked like the
holodeck from star Trek.

5556
02:37:22,820 --> 02:37:23,241
20 years.

5557
02:37:23,241 --> 02:37:26,810
Word existed and they were doing
surgeries and all this and they would do

5558
02:37:26,811 --> 02:37:28,700
empathy loads where they'd say,

5559
02:37:28,701 --> 02:37:32,480
we need the public because we're so
weak because the west is so strong.

5560
02:37:32,810 --> 02:37:33,700
People haven't had trauma.

5561
02:37:33,701 --> 02:37:34,910
So they sold them low level.

5562
02:37:34,911 --> 02:37:35,031
Oh,

5563
02:37:35,031 --> 02:37:35,960
we're going to create trauma.

5564
02:37:36,230 --> 02:37:37,160
Like when you go to Mars,

5565
02:37:37,161 --> 02:37:38,150
you're not getting any gravity.

5566
02:37:38,151 --> 02:37:39,080
So your heart don't get,

5567
02:37:39,081 --> 02:37:39,501
when you get there.

5568
02:37:39,501 --> 02:37:41,120
Who was organizing all this?

5569
02:37:41,150 --> 02:37:41,331
Well,

5570
02:37:41,331 --> 02:37:41,841
they don't tell you.

5571
02:37:41,841 --> 02:37:42,021
They go,

5572
02:37:42,021 --> 02:37:42,171
oh,

5573
02:37:42,171 --> 02:37:42,981
it's a special class.

5574
02:37:42,981 --> 02:37:43,520
You've been.

5575
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:44,060
Gotcha.

5576
02:37:44,060 --> 02:37:44,990
So in the 60s,

5577
02:37:45,020 --> 02:37:49,280
they had closed a special class of
people that are organizing all this shit.

5578
02:37:49,330 --> 02:37:50,600
It's Elias scores.

5579
02:37:50,660 --> 02:37:51,580
But is it for,

5580
02:37:51,590 --> 02:37:51,921
for,

5581
02:37:51,921 --> 02:37:52,850
for what purpose?

5582
02:37:52,851 --> 02:37:53,360
You don't know.

5583
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:54,560
Financial gain.

5584
02:37:54,700 --> 02:37:57,200
Social Jack Parsons,

5585
02:37:57,300 --> 02:37:57,680
uh,

5586
02:37:57,680 --> 02:37:59,480
was the jet propulsion laboratory.

5587
02:37:59,510 --> 02:38:00,171
Alisha Crowley.

5588
02:38:00,171 --> 02:38:00,680
Devil worship.

5589
02:38:00,680 --> 02:38:01,513
Exactly.

5590
02:38:02,120 --> 02:38:04,400
So you're still the chat alley
over a hundred years ago,

5591
02:38:06,040 --> 02:38:07,020
the aliens get the point.

5592
02:38:07,650 --> 02:38:09,170
The founder of j p Arrow.

5593
02:38:09,171 --> 02:38:10,070
Jack Parsons.

5594
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:11,360
Have you heard this before?

5595
02:38:11,361 --> 02:38:11,541
No.

5596
02:38:11,541 --> 02:38:14,350
I just can't believe I didn't
want to have Alex on the partner,

5597
02:38:14,410 --> 02:38:16,710
but did not let me finish this.

5598
02:38:17,300 --> 02:38:18,133
Let me say this.

5599
02:38:18,210 --> 02:38:18,960
I'm trying to take over,

5600
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:21,350
but I'm not bullshitting you.

5601
02:38:21,380 --> 02:38:21,561
Okay?

5602
02:38:21,561 --> 02:38:23,450
I'm telling you this stuff.

5603
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:24,830
I don't believe in this.

5604
02:38:24,860 --> 02:38:25,280
Okay.

5605
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:26,180
There it is right there.

5606
02:38:27,660 --> 02:38:30,740
This is patented in 1957 SVR machine.

5607
02:38:31,070 --> 02:38:31,640
Exactly.

5608
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:31,851
No,

5609
02:38:31,851 --> 02:38:32,684
exactly.

5610
02:38:33,660 --> 02:38:33,920
Show.

5611
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:35,000
I've talked to people,

5612
02:38:35,001 --> 02:38:35,780
not just family.

5613
02:38:35,780 --> 02:38:36,613
Holy Shit.

5614
02:38:36,820 --> 02:38:37,730
Keeps you wind,

5615
02:38:37,731 --> 02:38:38,421
vibration,

5616
02:38:38,421 --> 02:38:39,110
aromas,

5617
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:39,561
stereo,

5618
02:38:39,561 --> 02:38:39,951
sound,

5619
02:38:39,951 --> 02:38:40,311
power,

5620
02:38:40,311 --> 02:38:41,144
motion,

5621
02:38:41,420 --> 02:38:43,760
wide vision and three d three dimensional.

5622
02:38:43,910 --> 02:38:44,743
But let me tell you,

5623
02:38:44,900 --> 02:38:49,900
they wore a mask in the
sixties and seventies that
was already like you see like

5624
02:38:51,441 --> 02:38:51,741
paper,

5625
02:38:51,741 --> 02:38:54,590
thin TV screens and it was all ready.

5626
02:38:55,160 --> 02:38:55,631
I talk at all.

5627
02:38:55,631 --> 02:38:57,320
They said there's no way
this was human technology.

5628
02:38:57,500 --> 02:38:59,180
So you've seen these foldable phones?

5629
02:38:59,450 --> 02:38:59,950
Yeah.

5630
02:38:59,950 --> 02:39:00,260
Yeah.

5631
02:39:00,260 --> 02:39:03,170
I think the aliens have already
taken over Samsung and Huawei.

5632
02:39:03,460 --> 02:39:04,293
Yeah.

5633
02:39:05,510 --> 02:39:05,870
Cornish.

5634
02:39:05,870 --> 02:39:07,550
Do you think the aliens
are taking over Samsung?

5635
02:39:07,610 --> 02:39:08,150
Do you have any something,

5636
02:39:08,150 --> 02:39:12,250
something to do with Samsung
will obviously that's what
I'm telling you is the,

5637
02:39:12,390 --> 02:39:15,110
the Pentagon isn't worried
about as long as Jamie,

5638
02:39:15,310 --> 02:39:16,143
this is the patent.

5639
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:17,353
Wow.

5640
02:39:17,570 --> 02:39:19,910
I notice that's the week
of the sixties I believe.

5641
02:39:19,911 --> 02:39:21,680
1957 notice.

5642
02:39:21,681 --> 02:39:23,860
That's exactly what you're buying.

5643
02:39:23,870 --> 02:39:24,920
That's what my dad told me.

5644
02:39:24,980 --> 02:39:28,520
That's what our HTC Vive looks like today.

5645
02:39:28,710 --> 02:39:29,390
She'll just eat y'all.

5646
02:39:29,390 --> 02:39:30,110
This is big.

5647
02:39:30,110 --> 02:39:31,940
My Dad didn't tell me this

5648
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:33,801
chill.

5649
02:39:33,801 --> 02:39:34,970
He saw you in game and he said,

5650
02:39:35,150 --> 02:39:35,781
no son.

5651
02:39:35,781 --> 02:39:40,760
We had virtual reality goggles and we
had shitty rom and we had things and then

5652
02:39:41,660 --> 02:39:42,770
something else happened.

5653
02:39:42,830 --> 02:39:43,181
And I,

5654
02:39:43,181 --> 02:39:44,420
I'm not at liberty to get into it,

5655
02:39:44,421 --> 02:39:49,421
but I was shown three years ago what
the University of Washington was doing

5656
02:39:49,971 --> 02:39:53,690
under Bill Gates and this was
in the 90s what were they doing?

5657
02:39:56,120 --> 02:39:56,781
What do you do?

5658
02:39:56,781 --> 02:39:57,470
They,

5659
02:39:57,470 --> 02:39:58,880
they don't even know
what they're being given.

5660
02:39:58,881 --> 02:39:59,860
It's intervening ish.

5661
02:40:00,020 --> 02:40:03,380
So you think it's some sort of
alien intervention type shit,

5662
02:40:03,410 --> 02:40:03,770
dude,

5663
02:40:03,770 --> 02:40:04,130
they,

5664
02:40:04,130 --> 02:40:04,963
they,

5665
02:40:05,900 --> 02:40:07,460
they to get even deeper.

5666
02:40:07,490 --> 02:40:11,660
They turn your heart off for five minutes
and they pump oxygen into your blog

5667
02:40:12,930 --> 02:40:14,340
and you're in the meetings.

5668
02:40:14,400 --> 02:40:15,390
I've talked to people that are involved,

5669
02:40:15,391 --> 02:40:19,860
I mean top scientist and you're in
the meetings with fricken aliens.

5670
02:40:19,920 --> 02:40:21,240
Elvis is the main group,

5671
02:40:21,450 --> 02:40:21,980
but they're like,

5672
02:40:21,980 --> 02:40:23,340
by shutting your heart off,

5673
02:40:23,370 --> 02:40:27,000
it makes you have that
psychedelic experience by
keeping blood in your oxygen.

5674
02:40:27,001 --> 02:40:28,020
It's keeps you alive.

5675
02:40:28,050 --> 02:40:28,491
But we'll,

5676
02:40:28,491 --> 02:40:28,591
we'll,

5677
02:40:28,591 --> 02:40:29,280
let's explain.

5678
02:40:29,280 --> 02:40:30,113
Okay.

5679
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:31,530
The heart goes out.

5680
02:40:31,560 --> 02:40:32,820
The body thinks it's dead.

5681
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:33,570
Right?

5682
02:40:33,570 --> 02:40:35,070
So you can stay in longer.

5683
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:36,390
I don't know all the science behind it.

5684
02:40:36,420 --> 02:40:37,253
I understand.

5685
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:42,530
But let's explain this lung at
eight and DMT or Iowasca 200 times.

5686
02:40:42,560 --> 02:40:42,850
My mom,

5687
02:40:42,850 --> 02:40:44,940
like most of our astronauts to
test pilots are flying planes.

5688
02:40:45,030 --> 02:40:45,863
Those are robots count.

5689
02:40:46,110 --> 02:40:48,600
It's all mind war shall
these dudes are like,

5690
02:40:48,630 --> 02:40:51,360
it stops working once you've
taken in hundreds of times.

5691
02:40:52,080 --> 02:40:56,100
So then they start taking their most
psychic people who are able to do this and

5692
02:40:56,101 --> 02:40:59,160
they turned her heart off and
then they put them into these,

5693
02:40:59,190 --> 02:41:02,460
these events and it's like the
things the aliens tell them,

5694
02:41:02,461 --> 02:41:06,150
they come out and they tell scientists
and it works show like we're going to

5695
02:41:06,151 --> 02:41:06,984
shit.

5696
02:41:07,620 --> 02:41:09,810
They didn't tell you get
killed for this stuff,

5697
02:41:09,811 --> 02:41:10,021
Joe.

5698
02:41:10,021 --> 02:41:11,670
This is not the only thing
they want me off the air.

5699
02:41:12,060 --> 02:41:13,830
Because when I finally figured this out,

5700
02:41:13,831 --> 02:41:14,760
cause I never touch aliens,

5701
02:41:14,761 --> 02:41:15,900
I kind of knew the whole thing already.

5702
02:41:16,080 --> 02:41:16,771
Here's what I'm talking about.

5703
02:41:16,771 --> 02:41:17,604
When I was a kid,

5704
02:41:18,030 --> 02:41:18,541
wait nine,

5705
02:41:18,541 --> 02:41:20,310
whenever it was this one,

5706
02:41:20,340 --> 02:41:24,840
this lady would come over that had known
my parents since ut and it was involved

5707
02:41:24,841 --> 02:41:25,680
and she talked about,

5708
02:41:26,070 --> 02:41:26,401
yeah,

5709
02:41:26,401 --> 02:41:28,890
we call it the psychedelic research
should or whatever the name was,

5710
02:41:29,310 --> 02:41:31,410
but it's really a CIA deal and you know,

5711
02:41:31,890 --> 02:41:33,510
we just can't find people
that can handle it.

5712
02:41:33,570 --> 02:41:35,340
They're going in the hills want this.

5713
02:41:36,060 --> 02:41:36,571
And he yells,

5714
02:41:36,571 --> 02:41:40,050
want us to basically reduce population
and agree to these certain plans.

5715
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:41,640
And it's all the humanization.

5716
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:42,761
And they call him the L's.

5717
02:41:42,761 --> 02:41:43,594
It's clockwork hills.

5718
02:41:43,960 --> 02:41:44,521
And they're like,

5719
02:41:44,521 --> 02:41:45,354
yeah,

5720
02:41:45,940 --> 02:41:46,291
this is,

5721
02:41:46,291 --> 02:41:47,130
my parents were like seven,

5722
02:41:47,140 --> 02:41:47,560
eight years old.

5723
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:48,780
Like they don't think you're listening,

5724
02:41:48,781 --> 02:41:49,614
talking about,

5725
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:51,930
well this is what the elves want
and this is what they're gonna do.

5726
02:41:52,140 --> 02:41:52,591
And the thing is,

5727
02:41:52,591 --> 02:41:54,250
he's not a parent's aren't
that special either.

5728
02:41:54,280 --> 02:41:55,590
A to San Francisco

5729
02:41:57,330 --> 02:41:59,250
that it's all there is dude.

5730
02:41:59,251 --> 02:42:00,390
It's a cult man.

5731
02:42:00,570 --> 02:42:01,590
You all these guys,

5732
02:42:01,591 --> 02:42:02,640
you know from San Francisco,

5733
02:42:02,641 --> 02:42:03,300
dude,

5734
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:03,930
you look at,

5735
02:42:03,930 --> 02:42:07,350
look at the head of Google
or youtube or fricking apple.

5736
02:42:07,351 --> 02:42:08,340
He's on TV.

5737
02:42:08,580 --> 02:42:10,590
Tim Cook and his eyes are
this big under lights.

5738
02:42:10,591 --> 02:42:11,190
Man,

5739
02:42:11,190 --> 02:42:13,830
these guys are on stuff
that like nobody even knows.

5740
02:42:13,860 --> 02:42:14,730
What do you think they're on?

5741
02:42:15,720 --> 02:42:16,620
Stuff they've been given.

5742
02:42:16,621 --> 02:42:16,861
I mean,

5743
02:42:16,861 --> 02:42:17,970
I know people at ut,

5744
02:42:18,540 --> 02:42:19,890
they won't tell me specifically,

5745
02:42:19,891 --> 02:42:21,510
but I will tell you to
do two owns youtube.

5746
02:42:21,511 --> 02:42:22,051
Who's that guy?

5747
02:42:22,051 --> 02:42:23,420
What's his name again?

5748
02:42:23,480 --> 02:42:24,360
It's a girl.

5749
02:42:24,361 --> 02:42:25,310
You sexist pig.

5750
02:42:26,740 --> 02:42:28,030
It's alphabet.

5751
02:42:28,140 --> 02:42:29,250
Alphabet is the parent company.

5752
02:42:29,370 --> 02:42:30,710
This is their take.

5753
02:42:30,711 --> 02:42:31,110
Take.

5754
02:42:31,110 --> 02:42:32,030
Take the child already,

5755
02:42:32,040 --> 02:42:32,311
dude.

5756
02:42:32,311 --> 02:42:34,110
There's not like a Jack Dorsey of youtube.

5757
02:42:34,111 --> 02:42:34,441
Take,

5758
02:42:34,441 --> 02:42:34,741
take,

5759
02:42:34,741 --> 02:42:35,040
take,

5760
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:35,281
take.

5761
02:42:35,281 --> 02:42:35,561
Sundar.

5762
02:42:35,561 --> 02:42:35,750
Pichai.

5763
02:42:35,750 --> 02:42:36,583
Sorry.

5764
02:42:36,810 --> 02:42:37,920
He goes in Congress.

5765
02:42:37,921 --> 02:42:38,700
I'm there.

5766
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:40,110
He's the CEO of Youtube.

5767
02:42:40,170 --> 02:42:41,310
He's a CEO of Google.

5768
02:42:41,340 --> 02:42:41,820
Google,

5769
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:42,653
sorry.

5770
02:42:43,110 --> 02:42:45,450
And he's literally on TV going,

5771
02:42:45,810 --> 02:42:47,340
we never fixed the result.

5772
02:42:47,910 --> 02:42:49,320
We don't spout anybody.

5773
02:42:49,890 --> 02:42:54,000
There is no surveillance and you've got
all these old white men and I want to

5774
02:42:54,001 --> 02:42:54,160
say it,

5775
02:42:54,160 --> 02:42:55,140
I'm white men to be trendy.

5776
02:42:55,141 --> 02:42:58,500
It's all a bunch of old dumb ass white
man and a couple of dumb ass old Mexican

5777
02:42:58,501 --> 02:42:59,280
and black ladies.

5778
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:00,300
They're all dumb and I will call.

5779
02:43:00,301 --> 02:43:05,301
They are going show you
don't spout it or control it.

5780
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:06,151
Meanwhile,

5781
02:43:06,151 --> 02:43:09,510
their own perspectives to their
shareholders is how they control it all.

5782
02:43:09,630 --> 02:43:11,130
Now they're going to
deliver maximum profit.

5783
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:12,070
And

5784
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:12,903
Sundar is like,

5785
02:43:14,050 --> 02:43:14,351
yes,

5786
02:43:14,351 --> 02:43:15,184
it is true.

5787
02:43:15,610 --> 02:43:18,250
We have never controlled the
search result and it's just,

5788
02:43:18,251 --> 02:43:19,720
I'm just listening to pure lies.

5789
02:43:19,960 --> 02:43:20,793
Meanwhile,

5790
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:25,480
this guy's only the front guy of Eric
Schmidt and God knows what they're into.

5791
02:43:25,690 --> 02:43:26,021
They're,

5792
02:43:26,021 --> 02:43:26,410
I mean,

5793
02:43:26,410 --> 02:43:29,110
it hasn't been proven that
Google does something to,

5794
02:43:29,500 --> 02:43:31,090
to alter search results.

5795
02:43:32,940 --> 02:43:34,180
Uh,

5796
02:43:36,430 --> 02:43:37,600
I'm asking cause I don't know,

5797
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:38,890
not asking to fuck with you.

5798
02:43:39,490 --> 02:43:40,323
Uh,

5799
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:41,320
what did they do?

5800
02:43:41,320 --> 02:43:43,360
Who will itself is about if you pay them,

5801
02:43:43,361 --> 02:43:44,410
they put your results at the top.

5802
02:43:45,070 --> 02:43:46,000
Just like Facebook.

5803
02:43:46,030 --> 02:43:46,271
Okay,

5804
02:43:46,271 --> 02:43:47,950
well that's definitely
altering search results.

5805
02:43:47,980 --> 02:43:49,240
So what he said was not true.

5806
02:43:49,420 --> 02:43:49,901
If they,

5807
02:43:49,901 --> 02:43:50,660
if you can pay,

5808
02:43:50,660 --> 02:43:51,630
it's like sand water,

5809
02:43:51,631 --> 02:43:52,464
a wet Joe.

5810
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:55,630
I know you know all this stuff.

5811
02:43:55,660 --> 02:43:55,840
No,

5812
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:55,901
no,

5813
02:43:55,901 --> 02:43:56,140
no,

5814
02:43:56,140 --> 02:43:56,291
no.

5815
02:43:56,291 --> 02:43:57,124
I don't know that.

5816
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:57,993
I don't know that.

5817
02:43:58,060 --> 02:43:58,541
Now listen,

5818
02:43:58,541 --> 02:44:00,220
I'm honest about what I don't know.

5819
02:44:00,850 --> 02:44:02,260
I know some things,

5820
02:44:02,830 --> 02:44:03,101
but I,

5821
02:44:03,101 --> 02:44:05,470
there's a lot of fucking
holes in my knowledge base.

5822
02:44:05,500 --> 02:44:06,161
That's a fact.

5823
02:44:06,161 --> 02:44:06,281
Well,

5824
02:44:06,281 --> 02:44:11,140
you know that they try to block my name
and directed toward negative stuff.

5825
02:44:12,340 --> 02:44:14,800
I'm sure they do manipulate.

5826
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:18,550
All they do is all they
do is the negative.

5827
02:44:18,551 --> 02:44:19,151
You attack me.

5828
02:44:19,151 --> 02:44:20,320
It's like it's digital currency.

5829
02:44:20,650 --> 02:44:22,000
You go to the top and they pay you money.

5830
02:44:22,750 --> 02:44:23,291
Some of your body,

5831
02:44:23,291 --> 02:44:26,530
a little tip watching a cap me lie about
and you go to the top but you lose your

5832
02:44:26,531 --> 02:44:27,364
soul,

5833
02:44:27,550 --> 02:44:28,330
your soul,

5834
02:44:28,330 --> 02:44:29,500
but I don't want to burn this out.

5835
02:44:29,501 --> 02:44:30,580
There's important stuff to cover.

5836
02:44:30,790 --> 02:44:31,541
Alien I think as well.

5837
02:44:31,541 --> 02:44:32,650
This is a good podcast.

5838
02:44:32,680 --> 02:44:33,513
Fuck.

5839
02:44:36,950 --> 02:44:38,320
Let's don't end.

5840
02:44:38,321 --> 02:44:39,160
This jogs autonomous.

5841
02:44:39,170 --> 02:44:39,660
My vomit,

5842
02:44:39,660 --> 02:44:39,871
Martin,

5843
02:44:39,871 --> 02:44:40,704
miss my flight.

5844
02:44:41,180 --> 02:44:42,013
Look at this right here.

5845
02:44:43,150 --> 02:44:44,050
What is the end game?

5846
02:44:46,220 --> 02:44:46,710
I mean,

5847
02:44:46,710 --> 02:44:47,261
here's the example.

5848
02:44:47,261 --> 02:44:50,480
Earlier we already talked
about human animal hybrids,

5849
02:44:50,590 --> 02:44:54,250
mass farming of humanoid tissue
transhuman in game and we,

5850
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:57,130
and we talked about aliens and you
looked it up and it's all right there.

5851
02:44:57,390 --> 02:45:02,390
That's for the aliens creating animal
hammered isn't alien like grades and stuff

5852
02:45:03,011 --> 02:45:03,844
like that.

5853
02:45:03,970 --> 02:45:06,400
Do you think grades are
like a like a robot?

5854
02:45:06,430 --> 02:45:06,970
Yeah,

5855
02:45:06,970 --> 02:45:09,550
I think I've heard that
theory that it's not a real,

5856
02:45:09,551 --> 02:45:10,600
there's no pro.

5857
02:45:11,180 --> 02:45:14,410
The idea is that a certain point in time
you can interface with that robot so

5858
02:45:14,411 --> 02:45:16,690
that you could see it in
realtime through its eyes,

5859
02:45:17,460 --> 02:45:18,810
grows a read.

5860
02:45:18,820 --> 02:45:19,210
I don't know.

5861
02:45:19,210 --> 02:45:20,043
This is what I'm saying.

5862
02:45:20,260 --> 02:45:23,680
If if one day in biological androids,

5863
02:45:23,740 --> 02:45:24,490
hold on a second,

5864
02:45:24,490 --> 02:45:29,490
if one day in the future they figured
out a way to take a thing that looks like

5865
02:45:30,581 --> 02:45:31,710
a humanoid avatars.

5866
02:45:32,310 --> 02:45:32,710
Yeah,

5867
02:45:32,710 --> 02:45:37,710
and and transport it through a spaceship
onto another planet and you could look

5868
02:45:39,371 --> 02:45:42,130
through its eyes because you're
somehow or another connected to it.

5869
02:45:42,131 --> 02:45:43,810
The same way they're
connected to the lights.

5870
02:45:44,070 --> 02:45:44,251
No,

5871
02:45:44,251 --> 02:45:44,441
no.

5872
02:45:44,441 --> 02:45:48,400
You're all being prepared clothes where
your bow hunting and you're all that.

5873
02:45:48,760 --> 02:45:51,850
You just saw the 1950s
diagram of the VR goggles.

5874
02:45:51,940 --> 02:45:55,290
Can we pull that famous photo of
you don't believe in any aliens,

5875
02:45:55,291 --> 02:45:56,080
Eddie.

5876
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:57,610
I don't believe they come from up there.

5877
02:45:57,640 --> 02:45:59,130
Hold up your inner dimensional.

5878
02:45:59,131 --> 02:45:59,964
I think there

5879
02:46:01,730 --> 02:46:06,730
we're in this vast plain was a point
where they got us in closed in this little

5880
02:46:06,821 --> 02:46:07,654
thing or deal.

5881
02:46:07,890 --> 02:46:08,380
Eddie,

5882
02:46:08,380 --> 02:46:09,170
you learn.

5883
02:46:09,170 --> 02:46:09,681
Here's the thing.

5884
02:46:09,681 --> 02:46:12,110
You learn what the plan is by the attack.

5885
02:46:12,620 --> 02:46:13,940
They don't want us having kids.

5886
02:46:14,120 --> 02:46:15,320
They want us to moralized.

5887
02:46:15,560 --> 02:46:18,260
They want to break us down and they don't
want us to think maybe they expand and

5888
02:46:18,261 --> 02:46:20,030
they don't want us to
believe that their space,

5889
02:46:20,360 --> 02:46:21,650
and I'm not trying to attack you,

5890
02:46:21,890 --> 02:46:24,410
but they don't want third
dimensional resource expansion.

5891
02:46:25,400 --> 02:46:26,470
I don't even know what that is.

5892
02:46:27,640 --> 02:46:28,190
Well,

5893
02:46:28,190 --> 02:46:29,180
they don't want us

5894
02:46:31,370 --> 02:46:33,190
third dimensional resource expenditure.

5895
02:46:33,550 --> 02:46:34,040
Yeah.

5896
02:46:34,040 --> 02:46:34,873
What does that mean?

5897
02:46:34,970 --> 02:46:35,370
Well,

5898
02:46:35,370 --> 02:46:37,190
I don't know if I wanted this guy or not.

5899
02:46:37,460 --> 02:46:39,680
That's a 1950s diagram.

5900
02:46:39,860 --> 02:46:40,693
No,

5901
02:46:41,370 --> 02:46:42,710
I never saw that.

5902
02:46:42,740 --> 02:46:43,760
I'm glad he found the pattern.

5903
02:46:43,880 --> 02:46:44,690
Yeah,

5904
02:46:44,690 --> 02:46:45,530
Dad told me,

5905
02:46:45,950 --> 02:46:46,131
oh,

5906
02:46:46,131 --> 02:46:49,760
we had virtual reality and then I talked
to the scientist and he put me in touch

5907
02:46:49,761 --> 02:46:52,010
with somebody else and then
I found out other stuff.

5908
02:46:52,550 --> 02:46:53,121
Let's just say this.

5909
02:46:53,121 --> 02:46:54,350
I'm not in the CIA.

5910
02:46:54,950 --> 02:46:55,580
Me Neither.

5911
02:46:55,580 --> 02:46:56,570
I'm not in the NSA.

5912
02:46:56,750 --> 02:46:57,350
Me Neither.

5913
02:46:57,350 --> 02:46:59,030
But they've been tracking
me my whole life.

5914
02:47:00,250 --> 02:47:02,100
You think they give you
disinformation sometimes?

5915
02:47:02,101 --> 02:47:02,934
You're absolutely,

5916
02:47:02,960 --> 02:47:03,651
for sure.

5917
02:47:03,651 --> 02:47:04,700
It was the CIA.

5918
02:47:04,850 --> 02:47:06,260
It was the former deputy director.

5919
02:47:06,290 --> 02:47:07,610
Basically the CIA section,

5920
02:47:07,611 --> 02:47:12,611
chief founder of Delta Force who got
me to like a two weeks ago is Alex,

5921
02:47:13,790 --> 02:47:15,230
you're not saying sandy hook stage.

5922
02:47:15,230 --> 02:47:16,820
You need to go say sandy silk stage.

5923
02:47:17,150 --> 02:47:17,391
He goes,

5924
02:47:17,391 --> 02:47:17,571
oh,

5925
02:47:17,571 --> 02:47:22,571
we have the people were there and just
because he was famous MIT scientists and

5926
02:47:23,481 --> 02:47:23,840
stuff,

5927
02:47:23,840 --> 02:47:24,673
I went with that.

5928
02:47:26,060 --> 02:47:28,270
So do you think they
already had computers?

5929
02:47:28,280 --> 02:47:28,970
Probably.

5930
02:47:28,970 --> 02:47:29,631
I'm speculating,

5931
02:47:29,631 --> 02:47:31,340
looking way out to set me.

5932
02:47:31,430 --> 02:47:31,821
I mean,

5933
02:47:31,821 --> 02:47:32,330
I dunno.

5934
02:47:32,330 --> 02:47:34,550
I'm sure there's people
setting everybody up.

5935
02:47:34,940 --> 02:47:36,770
If you think I told you about this,

5936
02:47:36,771 --> 02:47:37,760
I don't know if it told you about,

5937
02:47:37,761 --> 02:47:39,310
I've told people that
have listened as podcast,

5938
02:47:39,320 --> 02:47:42,980
but this woman Renee to Resta and she
had a podcast with Sam Harris where they

5939
02:47:42,981 --> 02:47:47,981
went into detail about the operation
that people would use to troll Facebook

5940
02:47:48,411 --> 02:47:51,380
pages and Instagram
pages and create these,

5941
02:47:51,510 --> 02:47:55,550
the where the Russians had created these
troll bots and these meme pages where

5942
02:47:55,551 --> 02:47:58,550
the hundreds of thousands of
Polaroids are all doing it.

5943
02:47:58,551 --> 02:47:59,271
Everyone's doing it.

5944
02:47:59,271 --> 02:48:01,310
Everyone's doing just Russians are.

5945
02:48:01,440 --> 02:48:02,273
Everyone's doing.

5946
02:48:02,330 --> 02:48:06,220
But the thing that was fascinating was
she was saying that they organized a

5947
02:48:06,230 --> 02:48:09,800
Muslim event across the
street from a pro Texas event.

5948
02:48:09,830 --> 02:48:09,981
Yeah,

5949
02:48:09,981 --> 02:48:10,220
I want,

5950
02:48:10,220 --> 02:48:10,990
they want explosion.

5951
02:48:10,990 --> 02:48:13,610
They would have black lives
matter next to blue lives matter.

5952
02:48:13,611 --> 02:48:16,750
They'd set everybody up with every
bit as a blue lives matter is a lot.

5953
02:48:16,770 --> 02:48:20,480
What is Dan Morrison at film
school here in California,

5954
02:48:20,481 --> 02:48:21,860
trained on by the CIA.

5955
02:48:21,980 --> 02:48:22,680
What was he trained?

5956
02:48:22,680 --> 02:48:23,513
He was trained on,

5957
02:48:23,630 --> 02:48:23,960
can I,

5958
02:48:23,960 --> 02:48:27,980
can I hear this when I get [inaudible]
has said this before and I've said that's

5959
02:48:28,150 --> 02:48:29,030
donating the podcasts.

5960
02:48:29,660 --> 02:48:30,060
I gotta pee.

5961
02:48:30,060 --> 02:48:30,411
I gotta be,

5962
02:48:30,411 --> 02:48:32,420
I'm not going to have to
work you gotta pee again.

5963
02:48:32,840 --> 02:48:33,440
Bless.

5964
02:48:33,440 --> 02:48:35,200
[inaudible] go first.

5965
02:48:35,201 --> 02:48:36,034
Let me go for it.

5966
02:48:36,730 --> 02:48:41,510
All we got as a Cleveland browns will
go off about fucking Baker Mayfield for

5967
02:48:41,511 --> 02:48:42,460
like 10 minutes.

5968
02:48:42,500 --> 02:48:44,360
Let me just say this job,

5969
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:47,250
they got that new guy
for Kansas City stand.

5970
02:48:47,510 --> 02:48:51,940
The only way they get what I'm actually
saying is infowars.com and there's

5971
02:48:51,970 --> 02:48:53,840
worse.com you have to,

5972
02:48:53,870 --> 02:48:54,110
I mean,

5973
02:48:54,110 --> 02:48:59,110
we had 26 million subscribers
between my three shows on iTunes.

5974
02:48:59,870 --> 02:49:01,340
All they were doing was like into my feet.

5975
02:49:01,700 --> 02:49:04,730
They do listed that and it
killed us and I was always like,

5976
02:49:04,760 --> 02:49:05,151
Oh God,

5977
02:49:05,151 --> 02:49:07,380
I hope that care about being
deleted off of youtube or Facebook.

5978
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:07,951
God,

5979
02:49:07,951 --> 02:49:09,120
don't figure out the iTunes.

5980
02:49:09,121 --> 02:49:09,511
Don't,

5981
02:49:09,511 --> 02:49:10,344
don't do it.

5982
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:14,610
That was like devastating cause people
are like habitualized listen to you.

5983
02:49:14,611 --> 02:49:15,444
They don't anymore,

5984
02:49:15,690 --> 02:49:16,860
but I want to be 100% clear.

5985
02:49:16,861 --> 02:49:20,730
You have to go to infowars.com you have
to go to news wars.com if you want to.

5986
02:49:20,740 --> 02:49:21,600
Actually what I have to say,

5987
02:49:21,780 --> 02:49:22,141
in fact,

5988
02:49:22,141 --> 02:49:25,110
I'm not telling you guys what to play Joe,

5989
02:49:25,140 --> 02:49:25,973
I'm not mad at you,

5990
02:49:26,640 --> 02:49:29,520
but he heard me say that
Jimmy Chevelle would

5991
02:49:31,470 --> 02:49:36,060
go have sex with dead kids and also
cut out their pituitaries that has

5992
02:49:36,140 --> 02:49:37,410
adrenochrome in it and eat it.

5993
02:49:38,490 --> 02:49:40,020
And I know that sounds completely insane.

5994
02:49:40,021 --> 02:49:41,790
He was a famous child molester.

5995
02:49:41,791 --> 02:49:42,624
It's admitted.

5996
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:43,860
And so Joe's like,

5997
02:49:43,890 --> 02:49:44,581
oh that's crap.

5998
02:49:44,581 --> 02:49:45,151
That's crazy.

5999
02:49:45,151 --> 02:49:46,170
Alice has gone schizophrenia.

6000
02:49:46,470 --> 02:49:46,981
Well yeah,

6001
02:49:46,981 --> 02:49:49,500
I probably gone crazy looking
at all this and actually caring.

6002
02:49:49,501 --> 02:49:50,730
Most people don't
because they'll go crazy,

6003
02:49:50,970 --> 02:49:52,440
but the adrenochrome thing is real.

6004
02:49:52,441 --> 02:49:53,274
So if you go to,

6005
02:49:53,820 --> 02:49:55,110
what's the exact name of the video?

6006
02:49:55,560 --> 02:49:58,350
This is a three minute video that
I really think people should see.

6007
02:49:58,560 --> 02:49:59,730
It doesn't defame anybody.

6008
02:49:59,731 --> 02:50:00,750
It doesn't name names,

6009
02:50:01,020 --> 02:50:02,370
it doesn't do any of that stuff.

6010
02:50:02,820 --> 02:50:06,120
But if you go to infowars.com
and Trina Chromo,

6011
02:50:06,130 --> 02:50:06,963
she wrote her,

6012
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:09,300
what's a junior chrome?

6013
02:50:09,570 --> 02:50:10,171
Oh man,

6014
02:50:10,171 --> 02:50:10,800
dude.

6015
02:50:10,800 --> 02:50:11,400
It's just,

6016
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:14,160
you've heard about all these
rich startup companies that like,

6017
02:50:14,161 --> 02:50:14,281
well,

6018
02:50:14,281 --> 02:50:15,150
the parents agree.

6019
02:50:15,151 --> 02:50:17,730
The kid has a right to live that live
with 10 year olds and below his blood.

6020
02:50:19,120 --> 02:50:19,860
What?

6021
02:50:19,860 --> 02:50:21,120
We're rich people taking kids blood,

6022
02:50:21,121 --> 02:50:21,954
right?

6023
02:50:22,440 --> 02:50:23,071
Yeah.

6024
02:50:23,071 --> 02:50:24,630
It seems like a team.

6025
02:50:24,631 --> 02:50:29,631
Blood is a works well for
people in their elderly years.

6026
02:50:33,980 --> 02:50:34,813
Is this true?

6027
02:50:35,310 --> 02:50:36,143
Absolutely.

6028
02:50:38,180 --> 02:50:38,460
No,

6029
02:50:38,460 --> 02:50:38,611
it's,

6030
02:50:38,611 --> 02:50:39,900
it's all true and that's what I'm saying.

6031
02:50:39,901 --> 02:50:40,641
It's a fan prism.

6032
02:50:40,641 --> 02:50:42,060
It doesn't mean vampires are real.

6033
02:50:42,360 --> 02:50:43,410
It means that attitude.

6034
02:50:43,890 --> 02:50:46,350
I don't know if we can find this a
three minute video on my reporters did

6035
02:50:46,590 --> 02:50:47,790
adrenochrome Oh yeah,

6036
02:50:47,791 --> 02:50:48,900
you sent it to me,

6037
02:50:49,260 --> 02:50:49,700
right?

6038
02:50:49,700 --> 02:50:51,030
Can you tell them the
name is on your phone?

6039
02:50:51,770 --> 02:50:52,260
You got it.

6040
02:50:52,260 --> 02:50:53,093
Okay.

6041
02:50:53,550 --> 02:50:53,971
This is,

6042
02:50:53,971 --> 02:50:55,680
it's only three minutes
and it will name anything.

6043
02:50:56,060 --> 02:50:56,521
I'm telling you.

6044
02:50:56,521 --> 02:50:57,250
This was real.

6045
02:50:57,250 --> 02:50:57,930
Play it.

6046
02:50:57,930 --> 02:50:58,720
Here's the thing.

6047
02:50:58,720 --> 02:50:59,970
That one stop stop right here.

6048
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:03,510
Youtube just released a bunch of
total new guidelines where if you play

6049
02:51:03,511 --> 02:51:04,370
anybody's content,

6050
02:51:04,371 --> 02:51:05,340
you get a strike against you.

6051
02:51:05,341 --> 02:51:06,630
You're pulled for 90 days,

6052
02:51:06,631 --> 02:51:07,441
you can't stream,

6053
02:51:07,441 --> 02:51:08,274
you can't do shit.

6054
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:08,520
Yeah.

6055
02:51:08,520 --> 02:51:10,890
Now they're saying you can't
have comments that are bad.

6056
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:11,753
Yes.

6057
02:51:12,020 --> 02:51:13,290
Guilty for what your neighbor does.

6058
02:51:13,350 --> 02:51:13,531
Well,

6059
02:51:13,531 --> 02:51:14,850
not just the making of the youtube.

6060
02:51:14,850 --> 02:51:15,630
They're not gonna do that to you.

6061
02:51:15,630 --> 02:51:15,781
Well,

6062
02:51:15,781 --> 02:51:18,630
I dunno who the fuck's gonna do
it to who but after this podcast,

6063
02:51:18,810 --> 02:51:19,501
I think all bets.

6064
02:51:19,501 --> 02:51:19,621
No,

6065
02:51:19,621 --> 02:51:21,390
but I'm saying this is our own content.

6066
02:51:21,480 --> 02:51:22,680
It's totally fair use.

6067
02:51:23,130 --> 02:51:27,810
It's not true that youtube is really
demonetizing any videos that have truth.

6068
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:30,940
And here's what I liberty is that not
everybody gets paid on Twitter and

6069
02:51:30,950 --> 02:51:31,783
Facebook.

6070
02:51:32,320 --> 02:51:36,450
We all advertise on our businesses and
our radio shows and our TV shows this big

6071
02:51:36,451 --> 02:51:38,970
diversified media worldwide said,

6072
02:51:38,971 --> 02:51:39,181
hey,

6073
02:51:39,181 --> 02:51:40,380
here's where you can get our material.

6074
02:51:40,381 --> 02:51:41,161
It's a great system.

6075
02:51:41,161 --> 02:51:45,620
So for 10 years we built it up so
that the web was 90% decentralized.

6076
02:51:45,630 --> 02:51:47,130
Now it's 90% centralized,

6077
02:51:47,430 --> 02:51:49,950
and so once the big tech
goddess all centralized,

6078
02:51:50,290 --> 02:51:50,730
they went,

6079
02:51:50,730 --> 02:51:51,563
oh yeah,

6080
02:51:51,660 --> 02:51:52,710
just like when you're cashless,

6081
02:51:52,711 --> 02:51:53,630
we'll take her bank account away.

6082
02:51:53,670 --> 02:51:54,503
If you don't support us,

6083
02:51:54,720 --> 02:51:55,081
boom,

6084
02:51:55,081 --> 02:51:55,914
you're all gone.

6085
02:51:55,980 --> 02:51:57,690
So now we have to fight back against that.

6086
02:51:58,710 --> 02:51:59,670
There's something to that.

6087
02:51:59,700 --> 02:52:00,031
You know,

6088
02:52:00,031 --> 02:52:00,201
there,

6089
02:52:00,201 --> 02:52:00,411
there,

6090
02:52:00,411 --> 02:52:04,590
there's something to this idea that
one giant corporation can decide,

6091
02:52:04,620 --> 02:52:06,250
especially based on their own personal

6092
02:52:06,250 --> 02:52:06,971
ideology,

6093
02:52:06,971 --> 02:52:09,640
what gets put on and what
doesn't get put on because Joe,

6094
02:52:09,641 --> 02:52:10,780
they're control freaks

6095
02:52:12,330 --> 02:52:13,480
flagger in the fight now.

6096
02:52:13,720 --> 02:52:14,200
Thank you.

6097
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:15,033
Is there like

6098
02:52:16,630 --> 02:52:17,463
what does that mean?

6099
02:52:17,900 --> 02:52:19,340
Japanese is I,

6100
02:52:19,510 --> 02:52:20,110
Hey,

6101
02:52:20,110 --> 02:52:20,531
listen,

6102
02:52:20,531 --> 02:52:21,760
it's my video chart.

6103
02:52:21,910 --> 02:52:23,200
It's totally legal.

6104
02:52:23,380 --> 02:52:26,030
It just talks about Google
searches for a drain of chrome.

6105
02:52:26,140 --> 02:52:26,351
No,

6106
02:52:26,351 --> 02:52:27,880
I authorize you to air my video.

6107
02:52:27,910 --> 02:52:28,540
Okay.

6108
02:52:28,540 --> 02:52:30,340
The only issue I had to
just right at the beginning,

6109
02:52:30,341 --> 02:52:35,341
I see it has a part of a fear and
loathing in Las Vegas town to get us the,

6110
02:52:37,990 --> 02:52:40,590
let's tell people the link so
they can go to it themselves.

6111
02:52:40,591 --> 02:52:41,424
Show it.

6112
02:52:41,800 --> 02:52:45,190
This is essentially about people
that are putting old people.

6113
02:52:47,230 --> 02:52:50,470
Is it people are putting young people's
blood into old people's bodies?

6114
02:52:50,471 --> 02:52:53,380
Is that what it is that you were
and I know what your question is.

6115
02:52:53,381 --> 02:52:54,430
You're not a psychotic Damon.

6116
02:52:54,460 --> 02:52:55,293
Damon Parson.

6117
02:52:56,080 --> 02:52:58,420
Thanks you [inaudible] Bro.

6118
02:52:58,421 --> 02:52:58,931
Leave that.

6119
02:52:58,931 --> 02:53:02,530
Alex says that some babies she broadcaster
would go have sex with dead kid's

6120
02:53:02,531 --> 02:53:03,880
bodies at the morgue and need to branch.

6121
02:53:04,030 --> 02:53:05,260
That's someone that said what?

6122
02:53:05,261 --> 02:53:05,590
I said,

6123
02:53:05,590 --> 02:53:07,240
I didn't believe Bill
Maher was a pedophile.

6124
02:53:07,390 --> 02:53:08,050
That's all I said.

6125
02:53:08,050 --> 02:53:10,030
I said that his thing,

6126
02:53:10,031 --> 02:53:10,390
his name,

6127
02:53:10,390 --> 02:53:11,350
I don't think Spotify,

6128
02:53:11,730 --> 02:53:13,570
which everybody I know
says he likes women,

6129
02:53:13,660 --> 02:53:14,470
which is fine.

6130
02:53:14,470 --> 02:53:15,460
I think he likes women.

6131
02:53:15,790 --> 02:53:17,500
You know what we're
talking about him earlier,

6132
02:53:17,560 --> 02:53:20,680
and I can say this from the
perspective of a standup comedian.

6133
02:53:20,681 --> 02:53:24,220
We say a lot of shit that we don't
entirely mean because we think it's funny.

6134
02:53:24,460 --> 02:53:25,750
Eddie and I do it all the time.

6135
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:27,670
That's why Eddie said that to you earlier.

6136
02:53:27,670 --> 02:53:29,440
You really think that
someone's going to hurt.

6137
02:53:29,650 --> 02:53:31,990
They're going to legislate
to harvest babies.

6138
02:53:32,210 --> 02:53:32,461
He's,

6139
02:53:32,461 --> 02:53:33,550
he's doing that to fuck with,

6140
02:53:33,551 --> 02:53:34,384
you know,

6141
02:53:34,550 --> 02:53:37,090
Robert 100 for his style of comedy.

6142
02:53:37,630 --> 02:53:40,390
But like Eddie's been doing that
style comedy since I met him.

6143
02:53:40,391 --> 02:53:41,470
Like he loves to do that.

6144
02:53:41,471 --> 02:53:44,890
He loves to pretend and fuck with you
and they get you upset and he's like,

6145
02:53:45,010 --> 02:53:47,080
[inaudible] show your nursing that drank.

6146
02:53:47,110 --> 02:53:47,690
Let's slam.

6147
02:53:47,690 --> 02:53:48,310
Okay,

6148
02:53:48,310 --> 02:53:49,150
so look my friend.

6149
02:53:49,360 --> 02:53:49,511
Hey,

6150
02:53:49,511 --> 02:53:51,020
can I have one of them
whiskeys over there?

6151
02:53:51,070 --> 02:53:51,311
Yeah,

6152
02:53:51,311 --> 02:53:52,090
we got another beverage.

6153
02:53:52,090 --> 02:53:52,541
Oh,

6154
02:53:52,541 --> 02:53:53,890
Bravo is about to turn loose.

6155
02:53:54,230 --> 02:53:54,520
Nah,

6156
02:53:54,520 --> 02:53:55,210
just a little.

6157
02:53:55,210 --> 02:53:55,451
Hey,

6158
02:53:55,451 --> 02:53:56,320
I get you're busy.

6159
02:53:56,321 --> 02:53:58,720
But last time you had a comedy show where
you get to stay safe for this or no?

6160
02:53:58,750 --> 02:53:59,070
Yeah,

6161
02:53:59,070 --> 02:53:59,521
let's do it.

6162
02:53:59,521 --> 02:54:00,354
Let's do it.

6163
02:54:03,600 --> 02:54:04,433
You want um,

6164
02:54:04,580 --> 02:54:05,780
a CVN it,

6165
02:54:06,560 --> 02:54:07,393
no.

6166
02:54:07,780 --> 02:54:09,580
Could you imagine if we
announced we're going to get sex?

6167
02:54:10,110 --> 02:54:10,271
No,

6168
02:54:10,271 --> 02:54:11,040
we can't tell.

6169
02:54:11,040 --> 02:54:11,873
That's a Joe.

6170
02:54:13,570 --> 02:54:14,051
Hey Joe,

6171
02:54:14,051 --> 02:54:17,170
let me get real serious all the
time and everything and everything.

6172
02:54:17,171 --> 02:54:18,340
I appreciate you listening.

6173
02:54:18,341 --> 02:54:18,791
I appreciate you.

6174
02:54:18,791 --> 02:54:19,301
So real quick,

6175
02:54:19,301 --> 02:54:19,601
glad.

6176
02:54:19,601 --> 02:54:23,190
I'm really glad we did this topic.

6177
02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:24,820
I just want to say this one to be clear.

6178
02:54:26,180 --> 02:54:27,013
Um,

6179
02:54:27,310 --> 02:54:29,830
I have literally been trying
to find out what's going on.

6180
02:54:30,550 --> 02:54:32,470
And as you get older you
figure out more stuff.

6181
02:54:33,080 --> 02:54:34,540
I am not the one shank.

6182
02:54:34,560 --> 02:54:35,590
There's all these aliens,

6183
02:54:36,040 --> 02:54:39,880
the entire government and
all of these advanced groups.

6184
02:54:39,910 --> 02:54:42,880
That's why they've given up on space
is they're all about inner dimensional.

6185
02:54:42,881 --> 02:54:44,260
So I didn't finish up about,

6186
02:54:44,750 --> 02:54:48,850
I don't want to get any check then I'll
get into in your tank is that I've got a

6187
02:54:49,240 --> 02:54:52,390
pretty good understanding by
interviewing a bunch of people involved

6188
02:54:53,920 --> 02:54:57,880
about what the master plan is and exactly
who we're dealing with because there's

6189
02:54:57,881 --> 02:54:59,170
not just one group of aliens.

6190
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:04,160
What's the different groups and
what are you basing this on?

6191
02:55:04,161 --> 02:55:04,880
Like what,

6192
02:55:04,880 --> 02:55:05,541
when you say it,

6193
02:55:05,541 --> 02:55:07,940
you're saying like really
like you're really sure.

6194
02:55:07,970 --> 02:55:09,050
What do you base this on?

6195
02:55:10,460 --> 02:55:12,300
You know about general struggle buying,

6196
02:55:12,301 --> 02:55:12,860
right?

6197
02:55:12,860 --> 02:55:13,071
No,

6198
02:55:13,071 --> 02:55:13,810
don't.

6199
02:55:13,810 --> 02:55:14,090
Okay.

6200
02:55:14,090 --> 02:55:15,500
Well he was a major general,

6201
02:55:16,540 --> 02:55:19,970
was that a three star general and he
was the head of all class clandestined

6202
02:55:19,971 --> 02:55:22,040
operations for the US
government for like 15 years.

6203
02:55:23,540 --> 02:55:27,050
And he said on my show before
he died at like 98 or whatever.

6204
02:55:27,620 --> 02:55:29,060
But also in private discussions,

6205
02:55:29,061 --> 02:55:29,871
and this is like six,

6206
02:55:29,871 --> 02:55:30,704
seven years ago,

6207
02:55:31,040 --> 02:55:32,600
and I was everything like 15 years ago.

6208
02:55:32,870 --> 02:55:33,051
I mean,

6209
02:55:33,051 --> 02:55:34,790
this is the guy that ran the whole show.

6210
02:55:35,420 --> 02:55:36,650
You know men who stare at goats.

6211
02:55:36,860 --> 02:55:37,693
Yes.

6212
02:55:38,840 --> 02:55:40,070
That's a joke about that.

6213
02:55:40,130 --> 02:55:41,780
It kind of whitewash whitewashes at all,

6214
02:55:43,250 --> 02:55:47,450
but they broke through and got
contact and they had volunteers,

6215
02:55:47,451 --> 02:55:49,490
really serious people who,

6216
02:55:49,550 --> 02:55:49,911
who,

6217
02:55:49,911 --> 02:55:52,040
who were taking huge
doses of drugs do this.

6218
02:55:52,340 --> 02:55:52,731
Then I'll,

6219
02:55:52,731 --> 02:55:55,400
or NASA was doing it and that's why
they got to the point of saying,

6220
02:55:55,401 --> 02:55:55,521
well,

6221
02:55:55,521 --> 02:55:57,320
why should we try to go to other places?

6222
02:55:57,321 --> 02:55:57,921
The third dimension,

6223
02:55:57,921 --> 02:56:01,850
it's just as empty wasteland above it
and below it is all this incredibly

6224
02:56:02,150 --> 02:56:02,961
complex stuff,

6225
02:56:02,961 --> 02:56:06,170
but our brains tune all of it
out because we can't handle it.

6226
02:56:06,760 --> 02:56:07,340
Okay.

6227
02:56:07,340 --> 02:56:10,100
That's why I like young people before
they hit puberty are known to be psychic

6228
02:56:10,310 --> 02:56:13,280
because for whatever reason they're
able to see through the veil and all

6229
02:56:13,281 --> 02:56:15,230
religions are based
about scenes of the veil.

6230
02:56:15,350 --> 02:56:15,561
Well,

6231
02:56:15,561 --> 02:56:17,490
that's what intense
meditation does for you,

6232
02:56:17,491 --> 02:56:17,810
right?

6233
02:56:17,810 --> 02:56:19,280
The holotropic breathing,

6234
02:56:19,281 --> 02:56:21,050
a lot of it couldn't Delini stuff.

6235
02:56:21,350 --> 02:56:26,000
What they're doing is a allowing your
brain to relax its boundaries and

6236
02:56:26,030 --> 02:56:29,240
interface with all the other dimensions
that are around us all the time.

6237
02:56:29,300 --> 02:56:29,811
Exactly.

6238
02:56:29,811 --> 02:56:32,270
But usually can only get
through psychedelic drugs,

6239
02:56:32,360 --> 02:56:33,640
but dark forces,

6240
02:56:33,641 --> 02:56:36,560
dark form generally are
the ones that are willing,

6241
02:56:36,860 --> 02:56:41,240
good forces are not willing
to get involved in freewill.

6242
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:42,170
Um,

6243
02:56:42,170 --> 02:56:47,170
so you think that they are actual
entities that are in these dimensions that

6244
02:56:47,301 --> 02:56:48,140
you're in contact.

6245
02:56:48,240 --> 02:56:49,010
Okay.

6246
02:56:49,010 --> 02:56:49,843
There are,

6247
02:56:50,240 --> 02:56:51,860
have you exposed to
any of this personally?

6248
02:56:52,100 --> 02:56:52,940
Might get to that a minute.

6249
02:56:53,150 --> 02:56:53,721
There are,

6250
02:56:53,721 --> 02:56:58,721
there are hundreds and they're discovering
new ones all the time of parasites,

6251
02:56:58,970 --> 02:56:59,840
bacteria,

6252
02:56:59,870 --> 02:57:02,510
worms that control life
forms of everybody want.

6253
02:57:02,800 --> 02:57:03,200
Yes.

6254
02:57:03,200 --> 02:57:04,670
You ever seen the Zombie ants?

6255
02:57:04,790 --> 02:57:05,210
Yes.

6256
02:57:05,210 --> 02:57:05,661
Or A,

6257
02:57:05,661 --> 02:57:07,040
this is Zombie Wasp.

6258
02:57:07,060 --> 02:57:08,540
What does Ami was the boss.

6259
02:57:08,570 --> 02:57:09,160
Yeah.

6260
02:57:09,160 --> 02:57:09,650
They,

6261
02:57:09,650 --> 02:57:09,891
yeah,

6262
02:57:09,891 --> 02:57:10,850
there's so many of them.

6263
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:13,190
They keep finding it was
particularly in the insect world,

6264
02:57:13,191 --> 02:57:14,090
which is really interesting.

6265
02:57:14,200 --> 02:57:18,620
So the lowest level is able to infect
you with something that controls your

6266
02:57:18,621 --> 02:57:20,390
brain down to exact activities.

6267
02:57:20,450 --> 02:57:20,810
Yeah.

6268
02:57:20,810 --> 02:57:21,770
Exact activities.

6269
02:57:22,010 --> 02:57:25,100
Have you personally had any experience
with interdimensional beings?

6270
02:57:25,940 --> 02:57:29,090
Well because it's all taboo and people,

6271
02:57:29,091 --> 02:57:29,661
let me tell you,

6272
02:57:29,661 --> 02:57:32,420
I have my hundred
percent tell us about it.

6273
02:57:32,600 --> 02:57:33,680
Doing DMT.

6274
02:57:33,990 --> 02:57:36,200
I've 100% communicated with something.

6275
02:57:36,470 --> 02:57:39,680
The question is whether that's something
was actually in my imagination or in my

6276
02:57:39,681 --> 02:57:43,490
mind or that something was something
that takes place in another dimension.

6277
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:44,833
I don't know.

6278
02:57:45,260 --> 02:57:46,220
I can't be sure.

6279
02:57:46,400 --> 02:57:47,750
There's no way to put it on a scale.

6280
02:57:47,751 --> 02:57:49,190
There's no way that you
run it through a task,

6281
02:57:49,191 --> 02:57:51,710
but what I do know is that
it's the same experience.

6282
02:57:51,890 --> 02:57:52,700
I can be sure.

6283
02:57:52,700 --> 02:57:53,533
Okay.

6284
02:57:53,870 --> 02:57:55,520
I mentioned Eric Muller who,

6285
02:57:55,521 --> 02:57:56,354
you know,

6286
02:57:56,580 --> 02:58:00,110
I'm Mahler because he's the one
guy willing to let me tell a story.

6287
02:58:00,111 --> 02:58:01,410
I've literally talked to,

6288
02:58:01,411 --> 02:58:02,250
I see a hundred people.

6289
02:58:02,850 --> 02:58:05,970
It's probably more than that because
I've known about this for a long time.

6290
02:58:07,140 --> 02:58:08,940
He is a Christian,

6291
02:58:09,450 --> 02:58:10,410
but he heard about all this,

6292
02:58:10,411 --> 02:58:12,990
so he went down to a couple places in
central and South America and did it

6293
02:58:12,991 --> 02:58:13,824
twice.

6294
02:58:14,820 --> 02:58:15,421
Both Times.

6295
02:58:15,421 --> 02:58:18,300
It was 30 to 40 people in
the group and he's like,

6296
02:58:18,301 --> 02:58:18,451
well,

6297
02:58:18,451 --> 02:58:19,284
Alex,

6298
02:58:19,320 --> 02:58:20,520
I just don't believe in demons.

6299
02:58:20,520 --> 02:58:24,570
But I did see basically aliens coming to
the edge of the forest and we were all

6300
02:58:24,571 --> 02:58:26,310
sharing it and come on and
we're all seeing the same thing.

6301
02:58:26,311 --> 02:58:27,660
But I think it was a chemical reaction.

6302
02:58:27,870 --> 02:58:28,703
You don't have,

6303
02:58:29,190 --> 02:58:29,521
if you,

6304
02:58:29,521 --> 02:58:30,510
everybody gets drunk.

6305
02:58:30,511 --> 02:58:34,170
We all think about what happened to us
in high school or college or what's good

6306
02:58:34,171 --> 02:58:34,651
or what's bad.

6307
02:58:34,651 --> 02:58:35,670
We all have different experiences.

6308
02:58:35,970 --> 02:58:39,510
When you're taking on a hallucinogen
and suddenly you're all seeing the same

6309
02:58:39,511 --> 02:58:39,721
thing,

6310
02:58:39,721 --> 02:58:41,310
it just means it clicked off.

6311
02:58:41,311 --> 02:58:42,630
The part of your brain is a filter.

6312
02:58:42,631 --> 02:58:45,150
It's you go crazy because
a lot of schizophrenia is,

6313
02:58:45,151 --> 02:58:47,490
people just see more and
then they see everything.

6314
02:58:47,491 --> 02:58:48,390
It doesn't mean they're right.

6315
02:58:48,690 --> 02:58:50,460
It just means that the filter is off.

6316
02:58:50,700 --> 02:58:50,951
Well,

6317
02:58:50,951 --> 02:58:51,100
I,

6318
02:58:51,100 --> 02:58:51,980
he said he'll give her,

6319
02:58:51,981 --> 02:58:55,020
run your hand over an
insect that can't see.

6320
02:58:55,260 --> 02:58:56,550
They have no idea you're there.

6321
02:58:56,760 --> 02:58:57,870
They like certain insects.

6322
02:58:57,871 --> 02:58:58,920
They just don't see anything.

6323
02:58:58,921 --> 02:58:59,561
Whether it's a Senate,

6324
02:58:59,561 --> 02:59:00,450
Pete or whatever.

6325
02:59:00,480 --> 02:59:00,930
And how do,

6326
02:59:00,930 --> 02:59:02,190
how do we know what they see?

6327
02:59:02,490 --> 02:59:03,240
We don't know.

6328
02:59:03,240 --> 02:59:03,740
You're right.

6329
02:59:03,740 --> 02:59:06,210
We we by dissecting dead ones,

6330
02:59:06,211 --> 02:59:09,400
we have an understanding of what sensors
they possess and we can we think a B,

6331
02:59:09,440 --> 02:59:09,531
a,

6332
02:59:09,531 --> 02:59:13,580
B or a fly sees like in a
bunch of little like a hexagon

6333
02:59:15,110 --> 02:59:16,670
on different,

6334
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:16,981
yeah.

6335
02:59:16,981 --> 02:59:18,750
We don't know what the
exact experience was.

6336
02:59:18,751 --> 02:59:18,941
I,

6337
02:59:18,941 --> 02:59:22,710
I told you the whole story got
computers hooked up to the damn bugs.

6338
02:59:22,711 --> 02:59:25,350
They've got everything
hooked up to the bugs.

6339
02:59:25,650 --> 02:59:26,341
The differences,

6340
02:59:26,341 --> 02:59:27,090
let me tell you.

6341
02:59:27,090 --> 02:59:27,241
Yeah,

6342
02:59:27,241 --> 02:59:29,640
they've got roped up 35 years ago.

6343
02:59:29,910 --> 02:59:31,980
They had remote control
ratchet with microchips.

6344
02:59:32,190 --> 02:59:36,030
They could send 500 yards bombed out
building with a camera on their top.

6345
02:59:36,031 --> 02:59:37,750
They 30 years get to dolphins too,

6346
02:59:37,751 --> 02:59:38,010
right?

6347
02:59:38,010 --> 02:59:38,280
Yes.

6348
02:59:38,280 --> 02:59:38,581
Trapped.

6349
02:59:38,581 --> 02:59:40,200
They've gotten this
whole choose oftens head,

6350
02:59:40,201 --> 02:59:40,811
main line,

6351
02:59:40,811 --> 02:59:43,830
scientific American roaches with a
chip on their head that run around.

6352
02:59:44,370 --> 02:59:49,370
The difference is the where the reason
it's dangerous is that once you open that

6353
02:59:50,071 --> 02:59:50,401
gate,

6354
02:59:50,401 --> 02:59:51,234
it's all bad.

6355
02:59:51,510 --> 02:59:52,740
They asked it all bad.

6356
02:59:52,950 --> 02:59:53,221
Why?

6357
02:59:53,221 --> 02:59:58,221
Why can't you experience
that interdimensional being
in learn something from it

6358
02:59:59,250 --> 03:00:02,310
and be a better person
because for whatever reason,

6359
03:00:02,850 --> 03:00:05,420
at first it's all beautiful
and show you're an Aztec base.

6360
03:00:06,150 --> 03:00:09,450
Catnapping all the local tribes and and
killing whoever's the tallest or the

6361
03:00:09,451 --> 03:00:10,284
smartest.

6362
03:00:10,320 --> 03:00:11,970
Every time it gets control,

6363
03:00:12,330 --> 03:00:15,270
it starts murdering everybody
and it always starts beautiful.

6364
03:00:15,271 --> 03:00:16,200
It always starts crying.

6365
03:00:16,230 --> 03:00:19,830
So you're talking about
ancient civilizations where
the ritualized psychedelic

6366
03:00:19,831 --> 03:00:23,700
drugs and they wind up killing
everybody on every case and every case,

6367
03:00:24,060 --> 03:00:24,893
the priest,

6368
03:00:25,050 --> 03:00:25,441
Shay,

6369
03:00:25,441 --> 03:00:27,570
we have to pro babies should the fires.

6370
03:00:27,571 --> 03:00:28,710
We have to cut their hearts out.

6371
03:00:29,100 --> 03:00:29,490
Hmm.

6372
03:00:29,490 --> 03:00:31,100
We have to buy congenital.

6373
03:00:31,200 --> 03:00:31,951
True or false.

6374
03:00:31,951 --> 03:00:36,951
Supposedly the mushrooms were used by
the Aztecs so that they wouldn't resist.

6375
03:00:37,110 --> 03:00:38,520
They'd get them all high on mushrooms.

6376
03:00:38,610 --> 03:00:39,271
It was beyond that.

6377
03:00:39,271 --> 03:00:41,520
We had a cocktail at a cocktail.

6378
03:00:41,700 --> 03:00:42,533
They don't resist.

6379
03:00:42,780 --> 03:00:45,240
Dozens of illusive is intox was
they would give him an enema.

6380
03:00:45,390 --> 03:00:46,470
True or false though.

6381
03:00:46,650 --> 03:00:50,690
They didn't use mushrooms just to
keep him sedated and they ground us.

6382
03:00:50,880 --> 03:00:51,481
It makes sense.

6383
03:00:51,481 --> 03:00:51,801
If you get it,

6384
03:00:51,801 --> 03:00:53,790
they killed the pull this up.

6385
03:00:54,240 --> 03:00:55,470
I think the temple,

6386
03:00:55,520 --> 03:00:55,710
I,

6387
03:00:55,710 --> 03:00:59,260
I forget how you said t to Ucon Teal Con,

6388
03:00:59,590 --> 03:01:00,940
but in this one temple,

6389
03:01:00,941 --> 03:01:05,941
I think they killed some insane amount
of people after it was constructed as

6390
03:01:06,611 --> 03:01:08,950
after the construction's
tens of thousands.

6391
03:01:09,160 --> 03:01:11,490
They sacrifice tens of
thousands of people that,

6392
03:01:11,491 --> 03:01:13,840
the ones that we're actually
working to build the temple.

6393
03:01:14,020 --> 03:01:17,050
Once they realize that
killed everybody in real,

6394
03:01:17,051 --> 03:01:19,240
real university hedge who I pay,

6395
03:01:19,600 --> 03:01:20,351
I want to hear from them.

6396
03:01:20,351 --> 03:01:21,184
These are the Mayans.

6397
03:01:21,370 --> 03:01:21,821
And they said,

6398
03:01:21,821 --> 03:01:22,091
yeah,

6399
03:01:22,091 --> 03:01:22,301
no,

6400
03:01:22,301 --> 03:01:22,931
we're opening here.

6401
03:01:22,931 --> 03:01:23,764
Dimensional gate.

6402
03:01:23,770 --> 03:01:28,000
The gods want blood and they didn't
take it internally through the mouth.

6403
03:01:28,360 --> 03:01:28,990
They would take,

6404
03:01:28,990 --> 03:01:33,990
enemas have dozens of hallucinogens and
alcohol and show the priests will take a

6405
03:01:34,181 --> 03:01:38,920
couple of drugs and then the preach
wanted to communicate with the aliens and

6406
03:01:38,921 --> 03:01:41,830
the aliens wanted blood and they also
show it was more like we're chopping

6407
03:01:41,831 --> 03:01:42,221
hearts out.

6408
03:01:42,221 --> 03:01:42,760
Yes sir.

6409
03:01:42,760 --> 03:01:43,091
Okay.

6410
03:01:43,091 --> 03:01:43,990
We did a thousand.

6411
03:01:44,020 --> 03:01:44,261
Okay.

6412
03:01:44,261 --> 03:01:45,094
The gates open,

6413
03:01:45,130 --> 03:01:46,150
they tell from here it goes,

6414
03:01:46,151 --> 03:01:46,984
Jamie says,

6415
03:01:47,260 --> 03:01:49,540
it says they between,

6416
03:01:50,080 --> 03:01:50,531
wow,

6417
03:01:50,531 --> 03:01:52,930
between 10,040,

6418
03:01:53,450 --> 03:01:55,480
80,400 persons.

6419
03:01:55,481 --> 03:01:59,320
We're sacrificing the ceremony
in 1487 when the Aztecs,

6420
03:01:59,600 --> 03:01:59,970
uh,

6421
03:01:59,970 --> 03:02:01,210
completed the temple.

6422
03:02:01,360 --> 03:02:03,370
And how do you say the
temple named pull up the,

6423
03:02:03,371 --> 03:02:03,601
the,

6424
03:02:03,601 --> 03:02:04,434
the top of,

6425
03:02:04,650 --> 03:02:05,483
or is it,

6426
03:02:05,630 --> 03:02:06,430
how do you say I'm rich.

6427
03:02:06,430 --> 03:02:07,030
Good.

6428
03:02:07,030 --> 03:02:07,840
It's uh,

6429
03:02:07,840 --> 03:02:08,673
it's all over.

6430
03:02:09,200 --> 03:02:10,510
How did he say the temple name?

6431
03:02:11,560 --> 03:02:11,670
Oh,

6432
03:02:11,670 --> 03:02:13,230
didn't say that's matching your city.

6433
03:02:13,280 --> 03:02:14,340
Tila con,

6434
03:02:15,700 --> 03:02:18,520
I think I'm saying that shit go shit
each where they think they killed about 5

6435
03:02:18,520 --> 03:02:19,810
billion people flushing.

6436
03:02:19,840 --> 03:02:21,490
This is one day fucking insane.

6437
03:02:21,491 --> 03:02:23,950
They killed 80,000 people
and a couple of days.

6438
03:02:24,310 --> 03:02:26,050
That's banana that's come out of the way.

6439
03:02:26,051 --> 03:02:31,051
You go down there and you're walking
around in the woods and the Mayan God goes

6440
03:02:31,240 --> 03:02:33,910
the bones and they pick
up and you're like,

6441
03:02:33,911 --> 03:02:34,840
it's not graveled.

6442
03:02:35,080 --> 03:02:36,070
It's petrified.

6443
03:02:36,071 --> 03:02:37,390
Bones are everywhere.

6444
03:02:37,510 --> 03:02:38,230
Oh my God.

6445
03:02:38,230 --> 03:02:39,063
Let me go further.

6446
03:02:40,150 --> 03:02:41,920
The priesthood were meet sellers.

6447
03:02:42,250 --> 03:02:43,450
This happened in Europe as well.

6448
03:02:44,050 --> 03:02:47,530
They would hang people
up and the the stores,

6449
03:02:47,830 --> 03:02:52,270
the market is below the temples and
show you would eat the meat and the most

6450
03:02:52,271 --> 03:02:53,920
valuable meet was warriors.

6451
03:02:54,460 --> 03:02:57,100
Like when you won the ball throwing
game that went on for days,

6452
03:02:57,160 --> 03:02:57,993
they would kill you.

6453
03:02:58,000 --> 03:02:58,840
They killed you.

6454
03:02:59,110 --> 03:03:01,090
The ones who won were murdered.

6455
03:03:01,390 --> 03:03:04,390
This is the thing they used to think
that they sacrificed the losing team.

6456
03:03:04,600 --> 03:03:05,770
Now they realize the sacrifice.

6457
03:03:05,771 --> 03:03:06,311
The winning team.

6458
03:03:06,311 --> 03:03:08,230
I had a bit about for
awhile where I was like,

6459
03:03:08,231 --> 03:03:10,030
that must have been the
longest fucking game ever.

6460
03:03:11,080 --> 03:03:13,420
Dropping the ball fucking up.

6461
03:03:13,970 --> 03:03:16,720
They were all fighting
because they wanted to fund.

6462
03:03:16,721 --> 03:03:17,600
They believe they were.

6463
03:03:18,410 --> 03:03:18,640
Yeah.

6464
03:03:18,640 --> 03:03:22,960
They wanted to shed quick Kotler
postal in the flying serpent.

6465
03:03:22,990 --> 03:03:24,340
Quinto Quarto Quisha quality.

6466
03:03:24,341 --> 03:03:24,500
Yeah.

6467
03:03:24,500 --> 03:03:24,760
Yeah.

6468
03:03:24,760 --> 03:03:25,360
It's going to,

6469
03:03:25,360 --> 03:03:28,660
you're going to interface and upload
the itch brain and you look at their

6470
03:03:28,661 --> 03:03:29,171
paintings.

6471
03:03:29,171 --> 03:03:33,850
It's all like spaceships and dials and
they have perfect in the Spanish museum

6472
03:03:33,851 --> 03:03:35,800
for 200 years previous on
a hoax because there's,

6473
03:03:35,970 --> 03:03:36,280
there's,

6474
03:03:36,280 --> 03:03:38,320
there's drawings haven't
a 200 year old Spanish,

6475
03:03:38,440 --> 03:03:39,730
uh,

6476
03:03:39,770 --> 03:03:40,570
textbooks.

6477
03:03:40,570 --> 03:03:40,931
But you know,

6478
03:03:40,931 --> 03:03:42,850
she had a a,

6479
03:03:43,120 --> 03:03:44,410
it's about like a half foot long.

6480
03:03:44,440 --> 03:03:44,801
It's a,

6481
03:03:44,801 --> 03:03:48,190
it looks like a jumbo jet with
the windows and the engines.

6482
03:03:49,210 --> 03:03:50,043
True or false?

6483
03:03:50,170 --> 03:03:52,210
The Mayans smoked penis blood.

6484
03:03:53,320 --> 03:03:54,010
They did.

6485
03:03:54,010 --> 03:03:54,843
They did.

6486
03:03:55,370 --> 03:03:56,980
What they did was I,

6487
03:03:57,120 --> 03:03:57,953
that shit,

6488
03:03:58,570 --> 03:03:59,570
you're just being silly.

6489
03:04:00,100 --> 03:04:00,651
That's true.

6490
03:04:00,651 --> 03:04:02,000
Selves that they took.

6491
03:04:02,001 --> 03:04:07,001
They took long lines of leather Shag wore
leather and it had it had it had nails

6492
03:04:08,211 --> 03:04:12,920
on it and an and or had like spiky things
that glass and they would put it in

6493
03:04:12,921 --> 03:04:13,760
their genitals.

6494
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:14,340
Oh,

6495
03:04:14,340 --> 03:04:15,330
the most skill.

6496
03:04:15,430 --> 03:04:16,370
He's a priest.

6497
03:04:17,420 --> 03:04:18,141
The high priest,

6498
03:04:18,141 --> 03:04:22,510
when we're sacrificing people for
hours taking hallucinogens would,

6499
03:04:22,520 --> 03:04:24,890
would like not try to
cut his testicles off,

6500
03:04:24,891 --> 03:04:28,100
but all of the most skilled would sit
there and draw them through there and they

6501
03:04:28,101 --> 03:04:29,270
would smoke the blood,

6502
03:04:30,150 --> 03:04:32,740
the lower proxy to their ancestors.

6503
03:04:32,750 --> 03:04:36,490
The lower the lower priest would
then pull it up to their answers.

6504
03:04:36,500 --> 03:04:41,330
They would put it on sacred leaves and
then they would smoke the genital blood

6505
03:04:41,910 --> 03:04:45,610
of the high priest and they
would talk to the ancestors.

6506
03:04:45,820 --> 03:04:48,200
I believe it's just people are so goofy.

6507
03:04:48,350 --> 03:04:48,561
Look,

6508
03:04:48,561 --> 03:04:51,230
if you see those African ladies
with a giant plates in their lips,

6509
03:04:51,620 --> 03:04:52,870
if you believed that he the next,

6510
03:04:52,950 --> 03:04:53,391
the next,

6511
03:04:53,391 --> 03:04:53,690
yeah.

6512
03:04:53,690 --> 03:04:54,111
How about that?

6513
03:04:54,111 --> 03:04:56,680
This tries to her next out to the point
where if they take those things off,

6514
03:04:56,690 --> 03:04:57,830
your head will fall off.

6515
03:04:58,220 --> 03:05:00,560
People are willing to do all kinds
of crazy things to their body.

6516
03:05:00,561 --> 03:05:02,960
I am not surprised they
they'd smoke Joe blood.

6517
03:05:03,290 --> 03:05:05,450
The Bible says the Old
Testament New Testament,

6518
03:05:05,451 --> 03:05:06,650
which is pretty powerful.

6519
03:05:06,651 --> 03:05:07,910
I know people misinterpret itself,

6520
03:05:08,060 --> 03:05:08,930
but it's ancient text.

6521
03:05:08,931 --> 03:05:10,450
The people that are there like,

6522
03:05:10,510 --> 03:05:11,140
like you read the,

6523
03:05:11,140 --> 03:05:13,370
Oh like three burning wheels land.

6524
03:05:13,700 --> 03:05:15,230
There's a blue from and overjet.

6525
03:05:15,231 --> 03:05:16,160
It gives me something to take.

6526
03:05:16,161 --> 03:05:16,570
I take it,

6527
03:05:16,570 --> 03:05:18,920
I'll give him the full
data of the plan that that,

6528
03:05:18,921 --> 03:05:19,101
that,

6529
03:05:19,101 --> 03:05:20,730
that the genetics has been infested in.

6530
03:05:20,731 --> 03:05:22,070
God must destroy everyone.

6531
03:05:22,130 --> 03:05:23,090
That's an alien story.

6532
03:05:23,180 --> 03:05:23,361
Oh,

6533
03:05:23,361 --> 03:05:25,340
it's 100% but that's what
they always talk about.

6534
03:05:25,341 --> 03:05:26,960
There was talking about
that being an alien story.

6535
03:05:26,961 --> 03:05:29,900
That's why one of the primary stories
when they talk about the Bible,

6536
03:05:30,140 --> 03:05:31,250
Ezekiel's vision,

6537
03:05:31,380 --> 03:05:34,610
a wheel within a wheel that they
always thought of your rate it,

6538
03:05:35,060 --> 03:05:38,780
it says floating off the ground and
the Hebrew and the King James is pretty

6539
03:05:38,781 --> 03:05:42,980
clear to floating comes a thing
with a crystal from it over his head

6540
03:05:44,930 --> 03:05:47,930
and then the face of
shifting different creatures.

6541
03:05:47,930 --> 03:05:48,920
It's like a video screen.

6542
03:05:48,950 --> 03:05:49,280
Well,

6543
03:05:49,280 --> 03:05:52,250
if you think about how long it
would take for an alien to get here,

6544
03:05:52,550 --> 03:05:56,900
it really only makes sense that unless
they have a constant basis and a robot

6545
03:05:56,901 --> 03:05:57,411
they visit,

6546
03:05:57,411 --> 03:05:58,280
or if they,

6547
03:05:58,310 --> 03:06:00,020
if they came by themselves,

6548
03:06:00,140 --> 03:06:02,480
they came by themselves
a long fucking time ago.

6549
03:06:02,481 --> 03:06:05,810
Like if they were able to make
interstellar travel like two,

6550
03:06:05,850 --> 03:06:07,250
3000 years ago,

6551
03:06:07,400 --> 03:06:08,750
which is not that big of a leap.

6552
03:06:08,900 --> 03:06:11,270
If you think about us 3000 years from now,

6553
03:06:11,480 --> 03:06:12,950
we probably can do something like that,

6554
03:06:12,951 --> 03:06:13,370
right?

6555
03:06:13,370 --> 03:06:17,330
So if they were doing that 3000 years
ago and they found human beings,

6556
03:06:17,331 --> 03:06:19,400
and these are the stories that we have,

6557
03:06:19,610 --> 03:06:20,850
these stories like a Zeke,

6558
03:06:20,860 --> 03:06:21,770
you'll and like,

6559
03:06:21,771 --> 03:06:22,130
uh,

6560
03:06:22,130 --> 03:06:25,460
there's a bunch of different ancient
stories about contact with the skies.

6561
03:06:25,700 --> 03:06:26,031
You know,

6562
03:06:26,031 --> 03:06:26,361
the,

6563
03:06:26,361 --> 03:06:26,661
uh,

6564
03:06:26,661 --> 03:06:28,340
the only changing to tabulation.

6565
03:06:28,550 --> 03:06:28,780
Yeah,

6566
03:06:28,780 --> 03:06:29,810
there's a world government.

6567
03:06:29,811 --> 03:06:31,340
The beach is 50 feet tall.

6568
03:06:31,460 --> 03:06:32,150
It shifts.

6569
03:06:32,150 --> 03:06:33,170
Everyone can see at the same time,

6570
03:06:33,171 --> 03:06:34,004
it's a hologram.

6571
03:06:34,070 --> 03:06:36,170
And you've got these digital systems.

6572
03:06:36,171 --> 03:06:36,891
If you don't go along with,

6573
03:06:36,891 --> 03:06:37,820
you can't buy her shell.

6574
03:06:38,240 --> 03:06:38,601
People say,

6575
03:06:38,601 --> 03:06:38,780
oh,

6576
03:06:38,780 --> 03:06:39,441
that's not real,

6577
03:06:39,441 --> 03:06:40,520
but it's manifesting.

6578
03:06:40,550 --> 03:06:42,500
And then go 2000 years in the future.

6579
03:06:42,501 --> 03:06:43,700
They have advanced technology.

6580
03:06:43,701 --> 03:06:44,670
They don't send people anymore.

6581
03:06:44,720 --> 03:06:45,620
Now they send aliens.

6582
03:06:45,860 --> 03:06:47,180
If you go back to the old days,

6583
03:06:47,330 --> 03:06:52,050
it was actually some sort of humanoid
or a large thing like all the Zachariae

6584
03:06:52,051 --> 03:06:52,731
Cichon Shit.

6585
03:06:52,731 --> 03:06:54,730
The covers Sumerian texts.

6586
03:06:54,731 --> 03:06:55,900
Exactly what I'm,

6587
03:06:56,400 --> 03:06:57,150
I make sense.

6588
03:06:57,150 --> 03:06:58,380
That's what all those
guys are telling you.

6589
03:06:58,381 --> 03:06:59,214
Like Avatar,

6590
03:06:59,340 --> 03:07:00,780
James Camera's definitely dialed in.

6591
03:07:01,080 --> 03:07:01,531
It's like,

6592
03:07:01,531 --> 03:07:01,771
no,

6593
03:07:01,771 --> 03:07:02,604
we're there jack.

6594
03:07:03,510 --> 03:07:04,343
They're jacking him.

6595
03:07:04,650 --> 03:07:04,951
Well,

6596
03:07:04,951 --> 03:07:09,951
it makes sense that if there was a visitor
to this planet five 10 15,000 years

6597
03:07:11,041 --> 03:07:11,340
ago,

6598
03:07:11,340 --> 03:07:12,930
if there was maybe more,

6599
03:07:13,080 --> 03:07:16,530
maybe if there was a visitor hundreds
of thousands of years ago that actually

6600
03:07:16,531 --> 03:07:18,780
did genetic experiments on lower hominids.

6601
03:07:18,781 --> 03:07:20,100
If that was really the case,

6602
03:07:20,340 --> 03:07:22,260
it makes sense that
their technology would,

6603
03:07:22,261 --> 03:07:23,940
it increased far more rapid,

6604
03:07:23,941 --> 03:07:24,870
but let's go pass that.

6605
03:07:25,590 --> 03:07:27,120
Obviously scientists like to plant things.

6606
03:07:27,121 --> 03:07:28,360
Gardeners like to plant things and,

6607
03:07:28,800 --> 03:07:29,690
but that's Joe.

6608
03:07:29,700 --> 03:07:34,560
That's exactly what the global us believe
is that maybe they're just aware of

6609
03:07:34,561 --> 03:07:35,430
what the fuck's going on.

6610
03:07:35,431 --> 03:07:36,720
There was powerless as we are,

6611
03:07:37,320 --> 03:07:39,840
if they're really are more and more,

6612
03:07:39,990 --> 03:07:41,160
they only put soldiers,

6613
03:07:41,161 --> 03:07:43,350
people in charge who
are compartmentalized.

6614
03:07:43,351 --> 03:07:45,290
Nobody else knows who
will carry the shell,

6615
03:07:45,291 --> 03:07:46,124
but we're able,

6616
03:07:46,350 --> 03:07:47,190
because we're advanced,

6617
03:07:47,220 --> 03:07:47,940
look at this because let,

6618
03:07:47,940 --> 03:07:49,800
let's just get down to brass tax tax.

6619
03:07:49,801 --> 03:07:50,634
I love tax.

6620
03:07:50,730 --> 03:07:51,180
Let no,

6621
03:07:51,180 --> 03:07:51,421
Joe,

6622
03:07:51,421 --> 03:07:55,370
you just said it instead of
some weird dumb preacher,

6623
03:07:55,740 --> 03:07:56,340
you know in,

6624
03:07:56,340 --> 03:07:57,450
in Alabama.

6625
03:07:57,460 --> 03:07:58,820
I'm bashing Alabama sang stuff.

6626
03:07:58,821 --> 03:07:59,654
You get mad at this.

6627
03:08:00,110 --> 03:08:01,010
Don't look at watch.

6628
03:08:01,011 --> 03:08:01,761
So demonized.

6629
03:08:01,761 --> 03:08:02,990
Look at why it's demonized.

6630
03:08:03,380 --> 03:08:04,280
Think about that,

6631
03:08:04,460 --> 03:08:04,761
right?

6632
03:08:04,761 --> 03:08:06,320
Think about how it says,

6633
03:08:07,680 --> 03:08:08,000
okay,

6634
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:11,410
that there's no reality and god
creates a whole new virtual reality,

6635
03:08:11,411 --> 03:08:12,244
gives light,

6636
03:08:12,250 --> 03:08:13,090
does all of it,

6637
03:08:13,360 --> 03:08:17,080
and then his genetic experiment
by rogue elements gets involved.

6638
03:08:17,081 --> 03:08:18,750
It's all right there.

6639
03:08:18,760 --> 03:08:22,330
When you actually look at it and
you expand on it and you're like,

6640
03:08:22,360 --> 03:08:22,841
oh my God,

6641
03:08:22,841 --> 03:08:24,520
this is like beyond a
science fiction book,

6642
03:08:24,910 --> 03:08:27,010
and so it's the obvious thing.

6643
03:08:27,310 --> 03:08:28,660
That's why they keep telling us,

6644
03:08:28,690 --> 03:08:29,051
oh look,

6645
03:08:29,051 --> 03:08:29,771
Piltdown man,

6646
03:08:29,771 --> 03:08:30,604
all this fake stuff.

6647
03:08:30,850 --> 03:08:31,091
No,

6648
03:08:31,091 --> 03:08:31,924
Joe,

6649
03:08:32,200 --> 03:08:34,960
they did an accelerated immunogenic.

6650
03:08:35,470 --> 03:08:36,310
They're doing it too much now.

6651
03:08:36,311 --> 03:08:37,144
Something new.

6652
03:08:37,330 --> 03:08:42,250
They did an accelerated immunogenic
program on this planet and humanity.

6653
03:08:42,280 --> 03:08:42,521
What,

6654
03:08:42,521 --> 03:08:43,690
what does the Bible start with?

6655
03:08:44,400 --> 03:08:44,920
Pick Shas.

6656
03:08:44,920 --> 03:08:46,750
We are made in the image of God.

6657
03:08:47,790 --> 03:08:48,330
Yeah.

6658
03:08:48,330 --> 03:08:48,781
What does that mean?

6659
03:08:48,781 --> 03:08:50,850
We don't have God's knowledge
would have God's advancement.

6660
03:08:51,210 --> 03:08:52,230
We're the image.

6661
03:08:52,231 --> 03:08:52,411
Well,

6662
03:08:52,411 --> 03:08:53,071
what does an image,

6663
03:08:53,071 --> 03:08:53,671
it's a scan.

6664
03:08:53,671 --> 03:08:54,504
It's numbers.

6665
03:08:54,510 --> 03:08:55,500
It's the genetics.

6666
03:08:55,710 --> 03:08:56,700
It's the potential.

6667
03:08:56,790 --> 03:08:58,410
So we are the aliens.

6668
03:08:58,411 --> 03:08:59,940
Joe and everybody already knows this.

6669
03:09:00,870 --> 03:09:01,680
We are the aliens.

6670
03:09:01,680 --> 03:09:04,740
Do you think that we are a
product of alien intervention?

6671
03:09:04,770 --> 03:09:08,700
They took these lower hominids and they
accelerated their evolution by applying

6672
03:09:08,701 --> 03:09:09,534
their genetics.

6673
03:09:10,380 --> 03:09:11,213
Do you know,

6674
03:09:11,490 --> 03:09:12,180
here's the deal.

6675
03:09:12,180 --> 03:09:14,400
They say we're 97% chimpanzee,

6676
03:09:14,970 --> 03:09:16,560
but then they actually get
into the deeper genetics.

6677
03:09:16,561 --> 03:09:18,930
We're closer to pigs are Rach show.

6678
03:09:18,931 --> 03:09:21,840
I think that this was an
environment built for us.

6679
03:09:22,410 --> 03:09:25,980
We're the master genetic program
and they are all subsets of us.

6680
03:09:26,340 --> 03:09:27,420
Just for a backstory.

6681
03:09:27,830 --> 03:09:28,321
Uh,

6682
03:09:28,321 --> 03:09:29,640
and that's what the global his thing.

6683
03:09:29,730 --> 03:09:30,000
Yeah.

6684
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:32,550
But do you think that
the aliens created us?

6685
03:09:32,580 --> 03:09:34,230
Like this is like one of the primary,

6686
03:09:34,250 --> 03:09:35,370
here's what the elite beliefs.

6687
03:09:35,390 --> 03:09:36,223
Right,

6688
03:09:36,810 --> 03:09:37,560
okay.

6689
03:09:37,560 --> 03:09:38,191
The elder,

6690
03:09:38,191 --> 03:09:38,761
biological,

6691
03:09:38,761 --> 03:09:39,670
Android's the grayish.

6692
03:09:40,130 --> 03:09:40,560
Yeah.

6693
03:09:40,560 --> 03:09:43,710
And then there's other systems going
on and no one knows because it's all

6694
03:09:43,711 --> 03:09:44,460
warfare,

6695
03:09:44,460 --> 03:09:45,480
psychological stuff.

6696
03:09:45,481 --> 03:09:46,380
No one knows the true cause.

6697
03:09:46,381 --> 03:09:46,541
It's,

6698
03:09:46,541 --> 03:09:48,600
it's virtual reality once
you get to that level.

6699
03:09:48,601 --> 03:09:49,470
So no one knows.

6700
03:09:49,830 --> 03:09:50,431
We just don't,

6701
03:09:50,431 --> 03:09:50,961
we're advanced.

6702
03:09:50,961 --> 03:09:51,691
But we are,

6703
03:09:51,691 --> 03:09:52,590
and I'm not just answering a rifle.

6704
03:09:52,600 --> 03:09:53,433
Powerful.

6705
03:09:53,530 --> 03:09:54,900
The globalist are obsessed.

6706
03:09:54,910 --> 03:09:58,000
The elites are obsessed
because she reportedly,

6707
03:09:58,180 --> 03:09:59,950
obviously humans are pretty fricking cool.

6708
03:10:00,370 --> 03:10:03,940
We've got some big giant mission
and maybe that's a program,

6709
03:10:03,941 --> 03:10:07,660
I don't know that we're
like pretty super advanced,

6710
03:10:07,661 --> 03:10:11,770
but you can't put something out like
the Spartans were when their kids were

6711
03:10:11,771 --> 03:10:12,101
seven,

6712
03:10:12,101 --> 03:10:13,540
they throw them out for
two years in the woods.

6713
03:10:14,530 --> 03:10:16,210
You can't just put something out like,

6714
03:10:16,270 --> 03:10:16,571
like,

6715
03:10:16,571 --> 03:10:16,810
like,

6716
03:10:16,810 --> 03:10:17,411
like liberals.

6717
03:10:17,411 --> 03:10:18,460
You give her very everything.

6718
03:10:18,461 --> 03:10:19,294
They're a little assholes.

6719
03:10:19,690 --> 03:10:22,630
So this is like bootcamp
and training and they,

6720
03:10:22,631 --> 03:10:24,610
and so they had the
testis and do all this.

6721
03:10:24,850 --> 03:10:26,920
And basically this planet
is what the people say.

6722
03:10:26,921 --> 03:10:30,700
It's a big testing ground for other
things that are going to come.

6723
03:10:30,970 --> 03:10:31,870
And we are it.

6724
03:10:31,900 --> 03:10:32,740
We are God.

6725
03:10:32,970 --> 03:10:34,330
And I don't mean I'm God,

6726
03:10:34,331 --> 03:10:35,170
I'm already God.

6727
03:10:35,171 --> 03:10:36,310
I've achieved godhood.

6728
03:10:36,880 --> 03:10:39,040
Cause you could see that
potential in yourself and and the,

6729
03:10:39,050 --> 03:10:39,431
and the,

6730
03:10:39,431 --> 03:10:42,700
and the lower level ELLs will tell you
that because they already know you're bad

6731
03:10:42,701 --> 03:10:43,300
ass,

6732
03:10:43,300 --> 03:10:45,010
but if they can trick a tadpole,

6733
03:10:45,011 --> 03:10:47,710
it's going to grow into
Godzilla to go kill itself.

6734
03:10:47,711 --> 03:10:48,430
They're winning.

6735
03:10:48,430 --> 03:10:49,020
So you say,

6736
03:10:49,020 --> 03:10:50,500
so the animals are on a test,

6737
03:10:50,501 --> 03:10:54,630
the ELLs or a test on us to attack us
and and and see the survival of the

6738
03:10:54,640 --> 03:10:55,270
fittest,

6739
03:10:55,270 --> 03:10:56,110
but they're nothing.

6740
03:10:56,111 --> 03:10:57,020
They're like w by,

6741
03:10:57,030 --> 03:10:59,050
by the time we've achieved
conscious and we look back and go,

6742
03:10:59,350 --> 03:11:03,130
we're not going to look at it that
because I think when you jump to the next

6743
03:11:03,131 --> 03:11:03,491
level,

6744
03:11:03,491 --> 03:11:04,660
there's even a bigger war going on.

6745
03:11:04,900 --> 03:11:05,860
What's the biggest war?

6746
03:11:08,350 --> 03:11:11,590
Consciousness in the universe is
an interdimensional spacecraft.

6747
03:11:11,890 --> 03:11:16,890
Beyond that then looks like a
comment from my research and it has,

6748
03:11:18,160 --> 03:11:18,941
it has its head,

6749
03:11:18,941 --> 03:11:19,960
it has its corona.

6750
03:11:20,540 --> 03:11:22,300
That's consciousness consciousness.

6751
03:11:22,301 --> 03:11:23,750
He carries evil in the tail end.

6752
03:11:23,780 --> 03:11:25,360
The consciousness has a location.

6753
03:11:26,590 --> 03:11:26,831
No,

6754
03:11:26,831 --> 03:11:28,370
there is this giant consciousness.

6755
03:11:28,420 --> 03:11:28,930
God,

6756
03:11:28,930 --> 03:11:29,763
okay.

6757
03:11:29,920 --> 03:11:34,920
Swimming in a giant system of survival
of the fittest that God has created a

6758
03:11:35,471 --> 03:11:36,670
test God self.

6759
03:11:37,060 --> 03:11:37,481
Okay.

6760
03:11:37,481 --> 03:11:38,680
It looks like a comment,

6761
03:11:39,010 --> 03:11:40,960
so you got God's consciousness
and all the good things,

6762
03:11:40,961 --> 03:11:41,980
the knowledge going forward,

6763
03:11:42,130 --> 03:11:46,360
but God knows that everybody has to be
tested so the tail goes out and at the

6764
03:11:46,361 --> 03:11:47,980
end of the tail is basically evil.

6765
03:11:48,130 --> 03:11:49,900
That's why Christ says
get behind me Satan,

6766
03:11:50,230 --> 03:11:54,540
and it's always trying to test God
and infiltrate up into it to sabotage.

6767
03:11:55,530 --> 03:11:56,363
Damn.

6768
03:11:57,050 --> 03:12:00,670
If they do pull the plug on this podcast
is a good way to end this motherfucker.

6769
03:12:01,150 --> 03:12:02,070
I have your burnout.

6770
03:12:02,080 --> 03:12:02,450
One is fit.

6771
03:12:02,450 --> 03:12:02,681
Oh,

6772
03:12:02,681 --> 03:12:03,101
it's not.

6773
03:12:03,101 --> 03:12:06,370
I'm just saying it 1,300 and something.

6774
03:12:06,371 --> 03:12:08,920
If the fucking governments come in,

6775
03:12:09,280 --> 03:12:09,701
but shell,

6776
03:12:09,701 --> 03:12:11,800
they love [inaudible].

6777
03:12:12,080 --> 03:12:14,290
You guys have been talking
about aliens so much,

6778
03:12:14,291 --> 03:12:14,770
dude.

6779
03:12:14,770 --> 03:12:15,311
Trust me.

6780
03:12:15,311 --> 03:12:19,630
This is one of the biggest youtube videos
of all is that the move to talk about

6781
03:12:19,631 --> 03:12:20,860
aliens as much as possible.

6782
03:12:21,850 --> 03:12:22,820
They allow to shut up,

6783
03:12:22,821 --> 03:12:24,660
let me call over children's program,

6784
03:12:24,920 --> 03:12:27,370
bs alien stuff or were
they come out of space?

6785
03:12:27,371 --> 03:12:28,520
It's interdimensional Eddie.

6786
03:12:28,920 --> 03:12:29,190
Well,

6787
03:12:29,190 --> 03:12:31,750
when you say alien to tell you
that you're talking to the alley,

6788
03:12:32,300 --> 03:12:33,133
the gradient,

6789
03:12:33,280 --> 03:12:34,060
that's what it sounds like.

6790
03:12:34,060 --> 03:12:34,460
Delete.

6791
03:12:34,460 --> 03:12:36,070
Literally believe they're in
contact with these things.

6792
03:12:36,130 --> 03:12:40,480
Well maybe they are helping to describe
what you saw DMT and you tell us you

6793
03:12:40,481 --> 03:12:41,860
have these experiences,

6794
03:12:42,120 --> 03:12:43,690
thoughts become patterns.

6795
03:12:43,691 --> 03:12:47,500
They become like geometric patterns
that are moving through space and they

6796
03:12:47,501 --> 03:12:48,670
change and shift,

6797
03:12:48,671 --> 03:12:51,890
but they're letting you know
that they know all your bullshit.

6798
03:12:52,040 --> 03:12:54,160
They see right through you and they want,

6799
03:12:55,390 --> 03:12:56,750
they want you to relax.

6800
03:12:56,780 --> 03:12:57,351
Yes,

6801
03:12:57,351 --> 03:12:58,280
there is a lot of that.

6802
03:12:58,310 --> 03:12:59,570
There's a lot of thought as creation.

6803
03:12:59,620 --> 03:13:00,320
Yes,

6804
03:13:00,320 --> 03:13:01,490
but with the only,

6805
03:13:01,940 --> 03:13:02,701
oh relax.

6806
03:13:02,701 --> 03:13:03,680
Just he don't struggle.

6807
03:13:03,710 --> 03:13:05,480
No one would call them aliens though.

6808
03:13:05,630 --> 03:13:06,440
What I saw,

6809
03:13:06,440 --> 03:13:08,160
I never referred to him as a leader.

6810
03:13:08,180 --> 03:13:09,260
That's the term everyone knows,

6811
03:13:09,261 --> 03:13:10,160
but not of this world.

6812
03:13:10,280 --> 03:13:11,330
None of our average thing.

6813
03:13:11,450 --> 03:13:12,171
I would listen,

6814
03:13:12,171 --> 03:13:13,490
I would think it was aliens.

6815
03:13:13,491 --> 03:13:15,950
If it woke me up in the middle
of the night and took me a board,

6816
03:13:15,951 --> 03:13:16,371
a ship,

6817
03:13:16,371 --> 03:13:17,390
and that's what I experienced.

6818
03:13:17,570 --> 03:13:21,290
I would be 100% convinced that I went
to an alien spaceship and I talked to

6819
03:13:21,291 --> 03:13:21,920
these things,

6820
03:13:21,920 --> 03:13:22,650
the differences,

6821
03:13:22,650 --> 03:13:27,080
how it was like to to smoke it and
then laid back and then experience.

6822
03:13:27,081 --> 03:13:31,310
That is like I expected
that progression of events,

6823
03:13:31,580 --> 03:13:33,590
but if I woke up in the
middle of the night,

6824
03:13:33,591 --> 03:13:37,670
I was going to take a leak and a a light
shone down to the bathroom and they

6825
03:13:37,671 --> 03:13:38,840
stuck me through the window.

6826
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:39,591
It took me a board,

6827
03:13:39,591 --> 03:13:40,280
a space ship,

6828
03:13:40,280 --> 03:13:43,940
and I saw the exact same thing
that I saw when I was high on DMT,

6829
03:13:44,090 --> 03:13:47,030
had to be 100% convinced that
I was in contact with aliens.

6830
03:13:47,360 --> 03:13:47,841
The different,

6831
03:13:47,841 --> 03:13:50,360
the only difference is how I got there.

6832
03:13:50,570 --> 03:13:52,010
Like I got there through a drug.

6833
03:13:52,011 --> 03:13:53,120
I got there through smoking,

6834
03:13:53,121 --> 03:13:56,630
something that's produced by the human
brain so that I knew it was pretty safe.

6835
03:13:56,631 --> 03:13:57,500
No one's ever died of it.

6836
03:13:57,501 --> 03:13:57,711
I'm like,

6837
03:13:57,711 --> 03:13:58,401
let's see what happens.

6838
03:13:58,401 --> 03:14:02,150
And all that goes back to everyone I'm
been talked to in mash groups taking

6839
03:14:02,151 --> 03:14:03,760
particularly Iowasca yeah,

6840
03:14:03,770 --> 03:14:05,620
they have group events
and see the same things.

6841
03:14:05,621 --> 03:14:06,201
I hear the same thing.

6842
03:14:06,201 --> 03:14:06,860
Yes,

6843
03:14:06,860 --> 03:14:08,030
which is the psychic connection,

6844
03:14:08,031 --> 03:14:08,864
but it's beyond that.

6845
03:14:09,110 --> 03:14:11,480
You could argue a one
person's a psychic leader.

6846
03:14:11,600 --> 03:14:13,310
They projected everybody else's mind.

6847
03:14:13,390 --> 03:14:13,700
Yeah,

6848
03:14:13,700 --> 03:14:15,110
but who is projecting that into them?

6849
03:14:15,710 --> 03:14:17,900
So that's the only way it's out this,

6850
03:14:17,901 --> 03:14:19,070
this is one of the Pentagon.

6851
03:14:19,160 --> 03:14:19,401
It will.

6852
03:14:19,401 --> 03:14:21,830
It might not be someone projecting
anything into your mind.

6853
03:14:21,831 --> 03:14:25,910
It might be your new found ability
to perceive things that you could.

6854
03:14:26,150 --> 03:14:26,751
The way I look at it,

6855
03:14:26,751 --> 03:14:27,380
it's like,

6856
03:14:27,380 --> 03:14:27,621
no,

6857
03:14:27,621 --> 03:14:28,011
I agree,

6858
03:14:28,011 --> 03:14:30,770
but why are they all 43 people?

6859
03:14:31,340 --> 03:14:32,630
You know in Costa Rica,

6860
03:14:32,631 --> 03:14:33,680
all she aliens,

6861
03:14:33,740 --> 03:14:35,030
this is a bad example.

6862
03:14:35,040 --> 03:14:35,871
This is a bad example,

6863
03:14:35,871 --> 03:14:36,890
but it's not a bad one.

6864
03:14:37,250 --> 03:14:39,590
If you fart and you didn't have a nose,

6865
03:14:39,620 --> 03:14:40,490
no one would know.

6866
03:14:40,670 --> 03:14:42,080
If we didn't have a sense of smell,

6867
03:14:42,270 --> 03:14:43,340
we didn't have a sense of smell.

6868
03:14:43,341 --> 03:14:44,550
We could still get along in this slide.

6869
03:14:44,640 --> 03:14:44,991
I agree.

6870
03:14:44,991 --> 03:14:48,250
It was a way to visually see if
food was one individual elucidation.

6871
03:14:48,260 --> 03:14:49,170
There's all saying,

6872
03:14:49,250 --> 03:14:49,850
but what I,

6873
03:14:49,850 --> 03:14:54,850
what I'm saying is it's entirely possible
that there's multiple dimensions are

6874
03:14:54,861 --> 03:14:58,190
multiple things that we can't
perceive that we haven't,

6875
03:14:58,220 --> 03:15:01,310
we don't have the census for
that are around us all the time.

6876
03:15:01,330 --> 03:15:02,163
Great.

6877
03:15:02,350 --> 03:15:03,760
Just briefly and you jump in there,

6878
03:15:03,761 --> 03:15:04,220
Eddie.

6879
03:15:04,220 --> 03:15:07,730
Let me tell you what my deep
recharge and basically vision is.

6880
03:15:07,940 --> 03:15:08,351
Okay?

6881
03:15:08,351 --> 03:15:11,030
It just means you're
things crystallize epiphany

6882
03:15:13,710 --> 03:15:15,420
to talk about 12 dimensions,

6883
03:15:15,690 --> 03:15:16,523
11 known,

6884
03:15:16,740 --> 03:15:17,950
1218 omnipresence.

6885
03:15:17,990 --> 03:15:19,260
So we don't say it actually exists.

6886
03:15:21,050 --> 03:15:21,840
Okay.

6887
03:15:21,840 --> 03:15:23,080
To say that is arrogant.

6888
03:15:23,081 --> 03:15:24,090
So I won't say that,

6889
03:15:24,750 --> 03:15:29,340
but I have had dreams my
whole life that come true.

6890
03:15:29,880 --> 03:15:31,260
And the weirdest thing like,

6891
03:15:31,320 --> 03:15:35,730
Oh lady drops a thing of pickles at the
store or for five years I have the dream

6892
03:15:35,731 --> 03:15:38,990
and then one day I'm there and it's
the woman in the pickles break or,

6893
03:15:39,050 --> 03:15:41,160
or corn or when was this

6894
03:15:42,540 --> 03:15:42,680
Kevin?

6895
03:15:42,680 --> 03:15:44,660
When I was a kid it was more intense ties.

6896
03:15:44,670 --> 03:15:45,391
Fucking crazy.

6897
03:15:45,391 --> 03:15:45,661
So you,

6898
03:15:45,661 --> 03:15:48,180
for five years he had the same
dream that one day it happened.

6899
03:15:48,260 --> 03:15:48,720
Yes.

6900
03:15:48,720 --> 03:15:50,320
Was it how you drempt ish.

6901
03:15:50,670 --> 03:15:52,800
Fuck for about six months.

6902
03:15:52,801 --> 03:15:57,801
I had a dream of a guy in a purple
and green striped shirt and I'm like,

6903
03:15:57,901 --> 03:15:58,800
why am I walking?

6904
03:15:59,290 --> 03:16:00,420
Cause it's not like normal dreams.

6905
03:16:00,421 --> 03:16:01,710
Just like you're been taken over.

6906
03:16:01,711 --> 03:16:04,590
You always get vomit after like
a lucid dream is the dream.

6907
03:16:04,860 --> 03:16:09,140
And I'm walking around like Lala behind
a building and all of a sudden there's

6908
03:16:09,150 --> 03:16:11,130
some dude in a purple
and green stripe shirt.

6909
03:16:11,131 --> 03:16:13,410
He attacks me and six months later

6910
03:16:15,300 --> 03:16:16,133
it happens.

6911
03:16:16,520 --> 03:16:17,430
And I mean it happens.

6912
03:16:17,431 --> 03:16:17,851
Exactly.

6913
03:16:17,851 --> 03:16:19,620
So what do you think is going on?

6914
03:16:19,650 --> 03:16:23,100
If you mean all thoughts
of yourself aside,

6915
03:16:23,101 --> 03:16:23,580
just,

6916
03:16:23,580 --> 03:16:24,870
just look at it objectively.

6917
03:16:24,871 --> 03:16:25,740
What do you think that is?

6918
03:16:26,910 --> 03:16:30,960
You could say that it's human programming
and basic programming and the brain.

6919
03:16:31,080 --> 03:16:34,200
Do you think you're tapping
into a timeline that maybe
you can't access all the

6920
03:16:34,201 --> 03:16:34,650
time?

6921
03:16:34,650 --> 03:16:35,483
That's what I know.

6922
03:16:35,540 --> 03:16:36,720
What you can rent.

6923
03:16:36,780 --> 03:16:39,200
One of the reasons why
you can rant and rave and,

6924
03:16:39,270 --> 03:16:41,520
and when you spew out
information that way you do,

6925
03:16:41,521 --> 03:16:42,870
which is at very impressive,

6926
03:16:43,140 --> 03:16:46,280
the way you can talk about the
three hours straight and six hours.

6927
03:16:46,830 --> 03:16:49,590
You do the majority of your
programs entirely by yourself.

6928
03:16:49,620 --> 03:16:50,340
No television.

6929
03:16:50,340 --> 03:16:50,851
I agree with you.

6930
03:16:50,851 --> 03:16:54,630
It's not like I'm going to tell you a
little bit is doing something unusual.

6931
03:16:54,631 --> 03:16:55,451
Do you understand that?

6932
03:16:55,451 --> 03:16:56,221
I'm not even doing it.

6933
03:16:56,221 --> 03:16:57,540
It's like a river's going by.

6934
03:16:57,750 --> 03:16:58,381
There's a turtle,

6935
03:16:58,381 --> 03:16:58,981
there's a fish,

6936
03:16:58,981 --> 03:17:00,060
there's a log.

6937
03:17:00,360 --> 03:17:00,691
I,

6938
03:17:00,691 --> 03:17:01,680
that's why it's like random,

6939
03:17:01,681 --> 03:17:02,311
like what is this?

6940
03:17:02,311 --> 03:17:03,480
What does that exactly right,

6941
03:17:03,481 --> 03:17:04,680
but that's how you communicate.

6942
03:17:04,680 --> 03:17:06,990
That's like in the beginning of the
thing we were talking about Sandy Hook.

6943
03:17:06,991 --> 03:17:08,220
I kept trying to slow you down.

6944
03:17:08,460 --> 03:17:09,030
I was like,

6945
03:17:09,030 --> 03:17:10,710
I'm not following you down this river.

6946
03:17:10,920 --> 03:17:12,060
You just hit this one rock.

6947
03:17:12,061 --> 03:17:13,140
I want to talk about this rock.

6948
03:17:13,170 --> 03:17:14,220
I want to talk about the next rock,

6949
03:17:14,221 --> 03:17:17,250
but you just keep going the way
you think about things this year.

6950
03:17:17,400 --> 03:17:19,680
You're changing one
thing to the next thing,

6951
03:17:19,681 --> 03:17:20,401
to the next thing,

6952
03:17:20,401 --> 03:17:21,210
to the next thing,

6953
03:17:21,210 --> 03:17:23,760
and for people who are not
thinking the way you're thinking,

6954
03:17:23,761 --> 03:17:24,960
it can be exhausting.

6955
03:17:25,110 --> 03:17:27,780
Like you're trying to follow
Sam write about it at all.

6956
03:17:28,110 --> 03:17:30,420
I'm only seeing that like the code,

6957
03:17:30,450 --> 03:17:33,300
but I'm wondering because of the fact
you're telling me that you had these

6958
03:17:33,301 --> 03:17:34,230
dreams that came true.

6959
03:17:34,260 --> 03:17:35,940
Exactly the way you dreamt them.

6960
03:17:36,120 --> 03:17:37,410
I know you're not full of shit.

6961
03:17:37,600 --> 03:17:38,433
I've,

6962
03:17:38,490 --> 03:17:39,323
you're not a liar.

6963
03:17:39,330 --> 03:17:40,350
I've known you for a long time.

6964
03:17:40,590 --> 03:17:42,240
If that really did happen to you,

6965
03:17:42,420 --> 03:17:44,430
if this is your real life experience,

6966
03:17:44,431 --> 03:17:46,020
I want to know what the fuck that is.

6967
03:17:46,380 --> 03:17:47,730
You are you.

6968
03:17:47,880 --> 03:17:49,230
Are you on the periphery?

6969
03:17:49,410 --> 03:17:54,030
Do you have your finger on a membrane
that maybe other people can't totally

6970
03:17:54,031 --> 03:17:58,590
touch where occasionally just occasionally
you get a little peek through and you

6971
03:17:58,591 --> 03:17:59,550
get to see the other side,

6972
03:17:59,670 --> 03:18:01,560
even if it's only once
or twice in your life.

6973
03:18:01,770 --> 03:18:05,760
Who's to say that what you're experiencing
by being able to see these things

6974
03:18:05,761 --> 03:18:08,190
that manifest themselves
realistically in the future,

6975
03:18:08,191 --> 03:18:12,300
that this isn't what human beings will
have five years from now or a hundred

6976
03:18:12,301 --> 03:18:12,870
years from now?

6977
03:18:12,870 --> 03:18:13,051
Well,

6978
03:18:13,051 --> 03:18:13,381
sure.

6979
03:18:13,381 --> 03:18:13,861
Exactly.

6980
03:18:13,861 --> 03:18:15,080
We think of like a cell phone.

6981
03:18:15,081 --> 03:18:15,901
The magic honors.

6982
03:18:15,901 --> 03:18:17,070
We think we're all the same.

6983
03:18:17,280 --> 03:18:18,060
That's the thing.

6984
03:18:18,060 --> 03:18:19,200
We think we're all the same.

6985
03:18:19,380 --> 03:18:20,250
We're not all the same.

6986
03:18:20,430 --> 03:18:22,320
We're not all the same
in our ability to talk.

6987
03:18:22,530 --> 03:18:24,600
You can talk for a lot longer days,

6988
03:18:24,960 --> 03:18:25,793
and I do.

6989
03:18:25,890 --> 03:18:28,410
Eddie Bravo could talk about
Jujitsu better than both of us.

6990
03:18:28,560 --> 03:18:29,520
He needs a musician.

6991
03:18:29,730 --> 03:18:30,150
Sorry.

6992
03:18:30,150 --> 03:18:31,950
You and I both suck at music,

6993
03:18:31,951 --> 03:18:32,370
right?

6994
03:18:32,370 --> 03:18:36,390
So there's certain things that people
can do that you can't let me try to

6995
03:18:36,391 --> 03:18:38,970
describe it and they'll use it against me.

6996
03:18:38,971 --> 03:18:40,710
But no to say don't touch it
cause it's their whole religion.

6997
03:18:40,711 --> 03:18:41,310
And again,

6998
03:18:41,310 --> 03:18:42,360
it's 10 I'm talking about it.

6999
03:18:43,080 --> 03:18:44,880
By the time I was like three years old,

7000
03:18:45,900 --> 03:18:47,830
I would have this dream that God has,

7001
03:18:48,250 --> 03:18:51,010
cause God knows everything
is just super intelligent,

7002
03:18:51,280 --> 03:18:52,113
omnipresent,

7003
03:18:52,120 --> 03:18:52,990
unlimited dementias.

7004
03:18:52,991 --> 03:18:54,550
But God doesn't know where God came from.

7005
03:18:55,270 --> 03:18:57,640
So just like we're trying to
find out where we came from,

7006
03:18:57,970 --> 03:19:00,820
God is like a virtual
reality simulation as well.

7007
03:19:01,150 --> 03:19:03,880
And God is constantly
running every program,

7008
03:19:04,150 --> 03:19:05,100
every operation,

7009
03:19:05,110 --> 03:19:05,711
turning evil,

7010
03:19:05,711 --> 03:19:06,041
loose,

7011
03:19:06,041 --> 03:19:06,281
good,

7012
03:19:06,281 --> 03:19:06,970
loose,

7013
03:19:06,970 --> 03:19:07,451
everything.

7014
03:19:07,451 --> 03:19:09,520
Show I would have these dreams,

7015
03:19:10,820 --> 03:19:11,090
okay.

7016
03:19:11,090 --> 03:19:12,320
But earliest memories,

7017
03:19:12,321 --> 03:19:12,801
like two,

7018
03:19:12,801 --> 03:19:17,390
three years old where I would fly
out to the edge of infinity and

7019
03:19:19,430 --> 03:19:20,263
okay.

7020
03:19:20,430 --> 03:19:20,940
It was uh,

7021
03:19:20,940 --> 03:19:21,960
it was continual message.

7022
03:19:21,980 --> 03:19:23,370
Find out where we came from,

7023
03:19:23,580 --> 03:19:24,301
find out what it is.

7024
03:19:24,301 --> 03:19:27,180
And it would just be this big
giant spinning black vortex,

7025
03:19:27,181 --> 03:19:28,020
like a black hole.

7026
03:19:28,680 --> 03:19:32,550
And then I would have to go into that
trying to figure out what was going on and

7027
03:19:32,551 --> 03:19:33,400
it never in a,

7028
03:19:33,440 --> 03:19:34,380
it was the same thing.

7029
03:19:34,710 --> 03:19:39,000
And so it's just incredible frustration
show then growing up and dealing with

7030
03:19:39,001 --> 03:19:39,271
things,

7031
03:19:39,271 --> 03:19:42,120
using questioning politics and
questioning all these other areas.

7032
03:19:42,580 --> 03:19:43,860
Then having dreams that come true.

7033
03:19:43,861 --> 03:19:44,694
Exactly.

7034
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:48,880
And like knowing what's going to happen
before it happens and then questioning

7035
03:19:48,881 --> 03:19:49,230
and,

7036
03:19:49,230 --> 03:19:50,520
and then it never being wrong.

7037
03:19:50,800 --> 03:19:51,633
Um,

7038
03:19:51,960 --> 03:19:55,170
be like weird like crazy stuff man.

7039
03:19:55,171 --> 03:19:55,990
Like,

7040
03:19:55,990 --> 03:19:58,720
like just so much tough where it becomes
like you can't even deal with it.

7041
03:19:58,721 --> 03:20:03,420
You like dial it out and then
you just reached that point where

7042
03:20:05,390 --> 03:20:08,510
you don't even know what's real
anymore because it's so crazy.

7043
03:20:08,720 --> 03:20:09,171
But then you,

7044
03:20:09,171 --> 03:20:12,320
she like the mathematics of the whole
system and you know how it works.

7045
03:20:12,321 --> 03:20:13,490
It's not like you're some schizophrenia,

7046
03:20:13,730 --> 03:20:14,570
you talk about it,

7047
03:20:14,571 --> 03:20:15,890
you deal with it and actually works.

7048
03:20:15,891 --> 03:20:17,690
Like now when you fight the system,

7049
03:20:17,720 --> 03:20:19,250
you automatically know what to do.

7050
03:20:19,700 --> 03:20:20,660
Like when you talk about something,

7051
03:20:20,661 --> 03:20:22,790
the president word for word repeats me.

7052
03:20:22,791 --> 03:20:24,320
Trump is what freaks them out.

7053
03:20:24,470 --> 03:20:25,340
Word for word,

7054
03:20:25,341 --> 03:20:26,300
whole speeches,

7055
03:20:26,301 --> 03:20:27,530
like whole things.

7056
03:20:27,531 --> 03:20:28,400
And I'm on a power trip.

7057
03:20:28,640 --> 03:20:29,930
That's what they flipped out about it,

7058
03:20:29,931 --> 03:20:31,850
the CIA and everywhere
else and they're like,

7059
03:20:31,851 --> 03:20:31,971
well,

7060
03:20:31,971 --> 03:20:33,680
Jones is like connected to trumpet.

7061
03:20:33,720 --> 03:20:35,180
I think Trump's like an idiot savant.

7062
03:20:35,510 --> 03:20:36,920
What does that have to
do with this speech?

7063
03:20:37,520 --> 03:20:39,110
Explain that Trump's speech.

7064
03:20:40,430 --> 03:20:40,710
Um,

7065
03:20:40,710 --> 03:20:41,060
I,

7066
03:20:41,060 --> 03:20:41,840
I'm trying to follow it.

7067
03:20:41,840 --> 03:20:42,530
I don't even know.

7068
03:20:42,530 --> 03:20:43,460
I don't even know if the thing,

7069
03:20:43,490 --> 03:20:46,560
it's hard to follow you sometimes
because we were talking about,

7070
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:48,560
you were talking about teams trumps

7071
03:20:50,060 --> 03:20:52,070
even before that he was talking about God.

7072
03:20:53,020 --> 03:20:53,430
Oh yeah.

7073
03:20:53,430 --> 03:20:54,263
Oh God.

7074
03:20:55,110 --> 03:20:58,230
God knows everything
except where God came from.

7075
03:20:59,010 --> 03:20:59,350
Okay.

7076
03:20:59,350 --> 03:21:00,820
That's a good soundbite right there.

7077
03:21:01,120 --> 03:21:06,120
Do you think that God is just like every
other system that we see like think of

7078
03:21:06,941 --> 03:21:07,570
this.

7079
03:21:07,570 --> 03:21:08,403
There's no

7080
03:21:09,360 --> 03:21:10,540
one God is the motion.

7081
03:21:10,570 --> 03:21:11,860
Cause no one yard,

7082
03:21:12,010 --> 03:21:14,110
there's no one bird that's
running all the birds.

7083
03:21:14,500 --> 03:21:17,160
There's no one person that's
running all the people does it.

7084
03:21:17,180 --> 03:21:18,160
It's all chaos.

7085
03:21:18,161 --> 03:21:19,450
Even if we elect someone,

7086
03:21:19,480 --> 03:21:21,310
if they have the fuck of people hate him,

7087
03:21:21,550 --> 03:21:23,050
everybody's in chaos.

7088
03:21:23,051 --> 03:21:24,880
There's con they're trying concept power,

7089
03:21:24,881 --> 03:21:25,540
struggle.

7090
03:21:25,540 --> 03:21:26,230
Are you still on?

7091
03:21:26,230 --> 03:21:28,450
Do you think that God has decentralized?

7092
03:21:28,780 --> 03:21:32,260
Do you think that the idea of God is
decentralized and maybe God is a real

7093
03:21:32,261 --> 03:21:32,710
thing,

7094
03:21:32,710 --> 03:21:34,210
but God is not one person.

7095
03:21:34,390 --> 03:21:36,700
God is literally of organisms.

7096
03:21:36,850 --> 03:21:38,260
God is not just free will.

7097
03:21:38,290 --> 03:21:39,430
God is consciousness.

7098
03:21:39,550 --> 03:21:40,810
It's all of the organisms.

7099
03:21:40,811 --> 03:21:43,360
It's every fucking
technological innovation.

7100
03:21:44,070 --> 03:21:44,820
Tell the thing.

7101
03:21:44,820 --> 03:21:44,930
No,

7102
03:21:44,930 --> 03:21:45,763
I agree with you.

7103
03:21:46,660 --> 03:21:47,200
New agents,

7104
03:21:47,200 --> 03:21:48,033
a counterfeit Joe,

7105
03:21:48,190 --> 03:21:49,130
I agree with counterfeit.

7106
03:21:49,430 --> 03:21:49,581
No,

7107
03:21:49,581 --> 03:21:50,840
I'm saying a confident what's real?

7108
03:21:51,260 --> 03:21:51,831
Cause they'll say,

7109
03:21:51,831 --> 03:21:53,540
oh God is everything
that the movie was true.

7110
03:21:54,350 --> 03:21:56,720
God is experiencing
consciousness or all of us.

7111
03:21:56,721 --> 03:21:57,081
There's there's,

7112
03:21:57,081 --> 03:22:00,530
you know one of my where I have a
hard time saying that I know this.

7113
03:22:00,860 --> 03:22:03,680
I could say God might be decentralized.

7114
03:22:03,681 --> 03:22:06,740
I could say God might just be just like
every other organism on the planet.

7115
03:22:07,070 --> 03:22:10,070
It's just some thing that's moving in a
certain direction and trying to protect

7116
03:22:10,071 --> 03:22:13,160
itself and trying to procreate and trying
to advance and trying to innovate and

7117
03:22:13,161 --> 03:22:14,510
trying to be better than it was yesterday.

7118
03:22:14,720 --> 03:22:15,770
That's when everything is doing.

7119
03:22:15,950 --> 03:22:19,100
Every fucking animal that started out
as a single celled organism is trying to

7120
03:22:19,101 --> 03:22:19,934
survive.

7121
03:22:19,950 --> 03:22:21,800
Can we say create themselves?

7122
03:22:21,860 --> 03:22:22,041
Well,

7123
03:22:22,041 --> 03:22:24,140
it's not necessarily that
it didn't create itself.

7124
03:22:24,141 --> 03:22:25,130
It's something created.

7125
03:22:25,131 --> 03:22:29,120
It's slowly but surely say this through
the process of evolution and mutation.

7126
03:22:29,360 --> 03:22:30,193
This is the,

7127
03:22:30,510 --> 03:22:31,850
he'd go on and keep going for hours.

7128
03:22:32,270 --> 03:22:33,440
We should do an epic podcast,

7129
03:22:33,441 --> 03:22:34,970
but the point is we should not give up.

7130
03:22:35,260 --> 03:22:36,140
Let's don't give up.

7131
03:22:36,170 --> 03:22:41,170
The point is there is a pro human
future and a pro freewill future and the

7132
03:22:42,021 --> 03:22:45,650
globalist or an or an anti
human anti freewill future.

7133
03:22:45,740 --> 03:22:47,510
So all I know is just
swim towards the light.

7134
03:22:47,720 --> 03:22:49,310
This is pro human future.

7135
03:22:49,340 --> 03:22:52,100
This is the point and this is one of
the reasons why I wanted to discuss this

7136
03:22:52,101 --> 03:22:54,470
with you and this is one of the things
that I talked about with Tim Pool

7137
03:22:54,471 --> 03:22:58,160
recently and one of the things that
when we have a revised podcasts,

7138
03:22:58,161 --> 03:23:00,350
which is coming up very
soon with Jack from Twitter,

7139
03:23:00,990 --> 03:23:05,990
we all need to talk about open
communication that this is,

7140
03:23:06,920 --> 03:23:11,920
it's very bad for all people involved
to shut people down from communicating.

7141
03:23:13,160 --> 03:23:17,700
As long as they're not doing anything
to actively try to harm somebody.

7142
03:23:17,701 --> 03:23:21,380
And they said those that make
people peaceful action or whatever.

7143
03:23:21,381 --> 03:23:25,000
We said the people that make peaceful
action illegal make violence inevitable

7144
03:23:25,001 --> 03:23:26,250
and I'm butchering the closet.

7145
03:23:26,300 --> 03:23:26,870
That's a PR.

7146
03:23:26,870 --> 03:23:27,890
You might have paraphrased it,

7147
03:23:27,891 --> 03:23:29,120
but that's a perfect quote.

7148
03:23:29,360 --> 03:23:31,130
People don't like being
left on the outside.

7149
03:23:31,131 --> 03:23:32,060
And that's what I came.

7150
03:23:32,420 --> 03:23:35,620
One of the things about you and I having
this conversation and we had our blowup

7151
03:23:35,660 --> 03:23:40,160
is coming to understand that you felt
like you were left on the outside and me

7152
03:23:40,161 --> 03:23:43,460
as a person who was constantly busy
and wasn't paying attention to that,

7153
03:23:43,850 --> 03:23:47,600
it was selfish of me to not pay attention
to how you must have felt to be stuck

7154
03:23:47,601 --> 03:23:48,430
on the outside.

7155
03:23:48,430 --> 03:23:48,620
Well,

7156
03:23:48,620 --> 03:23:50,510
I just felt regardless of what you did,

7157
03:23:50,540 --> 03:23:53,630
what w w we you wish you
didn't do or didn't do.

7158
03:23:54,020 --> 03:23:56,300
What I like about you
is what we saw today.

7159
03:23:56,480 --> 03:23:56,841
I mean,

7160
03:23:56,841 --> 03:23:58,770
one of the best things
about this podcast to be,

7161
03:23:59,150 --> 03:24:03,080
I got to show people what I
really love about Alex Jones.

7162
03:24:03,081 --> 03:24:04,160
You're fucking fun.

7163
03:24:04,430 --> 03:24:05,390
This is hilarious.

7164
03:24:05,390 --> 03:24:09,410
And you say a lot of shit that turns out
to be real and turns out to be of real

7165
03:24:09,411 --> 03:24:13,890
concern and you make some really good
points about all the shit that has the,

7166
03:24:14,140 --> 03:24:14,511
I hear you.

7167
03:24:14,511 --> 03:24:16,700
I don't want to be right
about them killing babies.

7168
03:24:17,270 --> 03:24:19,310
I know you don't want to
be right about a human.

7169
03:24:19,311 --> 03:24:20,510
You don't have to be.

7170
03:24:20,660 --> 03:24:21,050
You don't.

7171
03:24:21,050 --> 03:24:23,390
It means it doesn't matter
whether you want to be right here.

7172
03:24:25,340 --> 03:24:25,491
Oh,

7173
03:24:25,491 --> 03:24:25,911
Jesus.

7174
03:24:25,911 --> 03:24:26,990
What's your longest podcasts?

7175
03:24:26,991 --> 03:24:27,560
We're going,

7176
03:24:27,560 --> 03:24:27,741
no,

7177
03:24:27,741 --> 03:24:28,431
don't do that.

7178
03:24:28,431 --> 03:24:29,750
That was like six hours or something.

7179
03:24:29,751 --> 03:24:30,630
What would your lawmaker,

7180
03:24:30,890 --> 03:24:31,251
I think,

7181
03:24:31,251 --> 03:24:31,640
uh,

7182
03:24:31,640 --> 03:24:32,810
Kevin Smith was the longest.

7183
03:24:32,811 --> 03:24:33,830
He was like five and a half.

7184
03:24:33,920 --> 03:24:34,940
Fuck that dude.

7185
03:24:34,960 --> 03:24:35,130
Oh,

7186
03:24:35,130 --> 03:24:35,963
he's a great guy.

7187
03:24:36,550 --> 03:24:37,610
I'm just kidding.

7188
03:24:37,611 --> 03:24:38,170
I love them.

7189
03:24:38,170 --> 03:24:38,480
Okay,

7190
03:24:38,480 --> 03:24:39,690
30 more minutes to go.

7191
03:24:39,740 --> 03:24:40,710
You're going to be stacked up to,

7192
03:24:40,711 --> 03:24:41,241
and I'm fine,

7193
03:24:41,241 --> 03:24:41,680
man.

7194
03:24:41,680 --> 03:24:42,513
Hours.

7195
03:24:43,310 --> 03:24:43,770
Look,

7196
03:24:43,770 --> 03:24:44,060
here's

7197
03:24:44,060 --> 03:24:44,610
the fine.

7198
03:24:44,610 --> 03:24:45,330
Listen,

7199
03:24:45,330 --> 03:24:46,200
I'll be honest with you.

7200
03:24:48,230 --> 03:24:49,170
I'm kind of retarded.

7201
03:24:53,610 --> 03:24:53,860
No,

7202
03:24:53,860 --> 03:24:54,030
no,

7203
03:24:54,030 --> 03:24:54,241
no.

7204
03:24:54,241 --> 03:24:55,550
That's going to be a soundbite.

7205
03:24:56,480 --> 03:24:58,410
They're going to put
that to Mariachi music.

7206
03:24:59,280 --> 03:25:00,113
No,

7207
03:25:02,070 --> 03:25:02,910
I might have to use it.

7208
03:25:02,920 --> 03:25:05,250
You'll must be flame thrower
to light the next choice.

7209
03:25:07,740 --> 03:25:08,221
Tobacco.

7210
03:25:08,221 --> 03:25:08,940
No,

7211
03:25:08,940 --> 03:25:09,121
no.

7212
03:25:09,121 --> 03:25:11,670
Seriously when it comes to regular life,

7213
03:25:11,700 --> 03:25:13,620
regular tobacco with no marijuana at all.

7214
03:25:13,621 --> 03:25:14,610
Would you like some yes.

7215
03:25:16,950 --> 03:25:17,671
Belbin I know.

7216
03:25:17,671 --> 03:25:18,401
Lead for alibi.

7217
03:25:18,401 --> 03:25:19,590
My guts never wrong.

7218
03:25:20,260 --> 03:25:21,093
That's

7219
03:25:22,860 --> 03:25:23,481
your points.

7220
03:25:23,481 --> 03:25:24,060
Cause here's the deal.

7221
03:25:24,060 --> 03:25:27,330
What points I got points
100% Hundred percent.

7222
03:25:27,630 --> 03:25:28,650
I ain't got no points.

7223
03:25:29,620 --> 03:25:30,810
I've got some great points.

7224
03:25:30,840 --> 03:25:31,673
No,

7225
03:25:31,800 --> 03:25:32,460
no.

7226
03:25:32,460 --> 03:25:32,701
Eddie,

7227
03:25:32,701 --> 03:25:36,810
Eddie big UFC is ambassador
of the flat Earth Society.

7228
03:25:36,960 --> 03:25:37,171
No,

7229
03:25:37,171 --> 03:25:38,010
he's not.

7230
03:25:39,070 --> 03:25:40,580
Eddie barely listened to it.

7231
03:25:40,581 --> 03:25:43,410
He doesn't believe more
than he believes this

7232
03:25:45,960 --> 03:25:47,320
became a universal truth.

7233
03:25:47,321 --> 03:25:49,020
He would fucking start
believing the earth is round.

7234
03:25:49,230 --> 03:25:53,550
No Flat Earth Society contraries
the Flat Earth Society is controlled

7235
03:25:53,551 --> 03:25:54,151
opposition.

7236
03:25:54,151 --> 03:25:55,360
Nobody gets in flatter.

7237
03:25:55,360 --> 03:25:56,040
Okay,

7238
03:25:56,040 --> 03:25:56,580
listen,

7239
03:25:56,580 --> 03:25:57,840
I know there's a lot of bullshit,

7240
03:25:57,841 --> 03:25:59,080
so I really had her society.

7241
03:25:59,350 --> 03:26:00,183
It's not real.

7242
03:26:00,270 --> 03:26:01,080
I respect you.

7243
03:26:01,080 --> 03:26:01,381
I do.

7244
03:26:01,381 --> 03:26:02,214
I love you.

7245
03:26:02,460 --> 03:26:03,330
The point is,

7246
03:26:03,570 --> 03:26:05,700
is that I'm asking you
a real question here.

7247
03:26:06,540 --> 03:26:07,373
Okay.

7248
03:26:08,700 --> 03:26:10,380
It'd be the biggest
documentary in history.

7249
03:26:10,830 --> 03:26:12,450
It only costs like $1 million.

7250
03:26:12,480 --> 03:26:12,751
Okay.

7251
03:26:12,751 --> 03:26:17,700
Let's take it a 50,000 ton big ship and
to have its circumnavigate the planet.

7252
03:26:17,990 --> 03:26:18,510
Okay?

7253
03:26:18,510 --> 03:26:19,750
You will be there with GP.

7254
03:26:19,790 --> 03:26:19,940
No,

7255
03:26:19,940 --> 03:26:20,040
no,

7256
03:26:20,040 --> 03:26:20,161
no,

7257
03:26:20,161 --> 03:26:20,341
no.

7258
03:26:20,341 --> 03:26:21,174
I'm not going to be there.

7259
03:26:22,190 --> 03:26:22,620
No,

7260
03:26:22,620 --> 03:26:24,810
we're going to get someone
to represent me there.

7261
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:25,670
Okay.

7262
03:26:25,670 --> 03:26:26,700
Good drugs

7263
03:26:28,250 --> 03:26:28,860
doing no,

7264
03:26:28,860 --> 03:26:28,981
no,

7265
03:26:28,981 --> 03:26:29,161
no,

7266
03:26:29,161 --> 03:26:29,430
no.

7267
03:26:29,430 --> 03:26:31,950
We're launching the discovery
of flat earth project.

7268
03:26:32,490 --> 03:26:32,671
Well,

7269
03:26:32,671 --> 03:26:35,160
that rocky man dude's already
shooting himself in the space.

7270
03:26:35,940 --> 03:26:37,950
Isn't he like make this really easy.

7271
03:26:37,951 --> 03:26:38,340
You know,

7272
03:26:38,340 --> 03:26:38,641
you know,

7273
03:26:38,641 --> 03:26:40,890
you prove the earth that
we really live on a ball.

7274
03:26:40,950 --> 03:26:41,700
How when you,

7275
03:26:41,700 --> 03:26:44,310
when they supposedly make
those missions to the ISS,

7276
03:26:44,311 --> 03:26:45,144
when they shoot up,

7277
03:26:45,210 --> 03:26:46,920
just have that one of the astronauts,

7278
03:26:46,921 --> 03:26:48,360
it's going to go to the ISS.

7279
03:26:48,510 --> 03:26:50,550
Just have a GoPro camera on his head,

7280
03:26:50,670 --> 03:26:52,860
on his helmet and just go uncut.

7281
03:26:52,980 --> 03:26:53,813
No cuts,

7282
03:26:54,090 --> 03:26:55,170
no cuts from the tongue.

7283
03:26:55,171 --> 03:26:57,360
You get in on that ship to the tongue.

7284
03:26:57,361 --> 03:26:57,961
You Doc.

7285
03:26:57,961 --> 03:26:58,830
And I want you to duck.

7286
03:26:59,580 --> 03:27:00,413
We

7287
03:27:01,710 --> 03:27:02,341
and Fred.

7288
03:27:02,341 --> 03:27:02,980
Fred.

7289
03:27:02,980 --> 03:27:03,310
No,

7290
03:27:03,310 --> 03:27:04,650
I'm fricking technology.

7291
03:27:07,080 --> 03:27:08,070
My cell phone is awesome.

7292
03:27:09,170 --> 03:27:09,630
What does that,

7293
03:27:09,630 --> 03:27:11,130
any of the songs be combative here.

7294
03:27:11,310 --> 03:27:14,100
But if this is how we talk,

7295
03:27:14,160 --> 03:27:14,401
I know,

7296
03:27:14,401 --> 03:27:15,390
but you're talking over each other.

7297
03:27:15,600 --> 03:27:17,050
If that did happened,

7298
03:27:17,250 --> 03:27:17,851
would you,

7299
03:27:17,851 --> 03:27:18,031
uh,

7300
03:27:18,031 --> 03:27:19,790
you want some more tobacco Alex Jones,

7301
03:27:19,820 --> 03:27:20,100
dude,

7302
03:27:20,100 --> 03:27:20,370
sure.

7303
03:27:20,370 --> 03:27:23,190
If that happened the first
time I'm saying this,

7304
03:27:23,191 --> 03:27:25,110
I've been saying if that
happened that happened,

7305
03:27:25,111 --> 03:27:25,944
you let it go.

7306
03:27:26,490 --> 03:27:30,570
There's no footage of the construction
of the international space station.

7307
03:27:30,900 --> 03:27:31,651
There's no footage.

7308
03:27:31,651 --> 03:27:33,550
You just appear cause there's
not a spender as payers.

7309
03:27:33,660 --> 03:27:37,470
No footage of the modules
of the internationals.

7310
03:27:37,510 --> 03:27:38,790
I you sure about that?

7311
03:27:38,960 --> 03:27:41,470
100% there's no footage
of the construction.

7312
03:27:42,430 --> 03:27:43,263
That shit.

7313
03:27:43,720 --> 03:27:45,240
People that worried me
in the space station,

7314
03:27:45,270 --> 03:27:46,120
I've known astronauts.

7315
03:27:46,420 --> 03:27:47,231
They're real people,

7316
03:27:47,231 --> 03:27:47,501
man.

7317
03:27:47,501 --> 03:27:48,670
They were the real real people.

7318
03:27:48,671 --> 03:27:49,860
I didn't say they weren't real peaceful.

7319
03:27:49,890 --> 03:27:52,450
You don't think it's really constructed
or you would like to see the footage

7320
03:27:52,451 --> 03:27:53,200
first?

7321
03:27:53,200 --> 03:27:53,561
Listen,

7322
03:27:53,561 --> 03:27:53,920
listen.

7323
03:27:53,920 --> 03:27:55,330
If you know there's a,

7324
03:27:55,331 --> 03:27:56,081
there's a debate.

7325
03:27:56,081 --> 03:27:56,630
Let me finish,

7326
03:27:56,630 --> 03:27:56,821
dude.

7327
03:27:56,821 --> 03:27:57,340
Let me just,

7328
03:27:57,340 --> 03:28:01,120
there's a debate out there whether you
believe we went to the moon or not.

7329
03:28:01,330 --> 03:28:01,840
You have.

7330
03:28:01,840 --> 03:28:03,190
Everyone needs to acknowledge it.

7331
03:28:03,400 --> 03:28:04,181
There was the debate.

7332
03:28:04,181 --> 03:28:05,860
There's people that will meet the laser.

7333
03:28:05,861 --> 03:28:06,430
Hold on.

7334
03:28:06,430 --> 03:28:07,240
Hold on.

7335
03:28:07,240 --> 03:28:10,600
There's people that believe we went to
the moon and there's people believe that

7336
03:28:10,601 --> 03:28:11,170
we faked it.

7337
03:28:11,170 --> 03:28:13,550
You have to understand both receive.

7338
03:28:13,560 --> 03:28:14,393
We'll have a message.

7339
03:28:14,620 --> 03:28:15,221
Exactly.

7340
03:28:15,221 --> 03:28:15,970
Exactly.

7341
03:28:15,970 --> 03:28:18,100
So when you talk about,

7342
03:28:18,510 --> 03:28:19,030
uh,

7343
03:28:19,030 --> 03:28:21,820
the people that don't
believe we went to the moon,

7344
03:28:22,150 --> 03:28:26,230
when they also say they're
faking other space shit too,

7345
03:28:26,410 --> 03:28:28,810
you'd have to kind of understand
where they're coming from.

7346
03:28:30,900 --> 03:28:32,680
They believe whether they win or not.

7347
03:28:32,830 --> 03:28:33,401
Maybe we were,

7348
03:28:33,401 --> 03:28:34,020
maybe we didn't.

7349
03:28:34,020 --> 03:28:34,853
I don't know.

7350
03:28:35,020 --> 03:28:36,490
But there's people that don't believe it,

7351
03:28:36,491 --> 03:28:37,810
so when they don't,

7352
03:28:37,811 --> 03:28:38,980
you should understand it.

7353
03:28:39,190 --> 03:28:41,190
They have no trust for any of that.

7354
03:28:41,800 --> 03:28:45,490
How many times you got to fake
going to the moon before you go,

7355
03:28:45,491 --> 03:28:45,880
okay,

7356
03:28:45,880 --> 03:28:48,430
well before that bullshit
meter just fucking explodes.

7357
03:28:48,480 --> 03:28:48,701
No,

7358
03:28:48,701 --> 03:28:49,210
I agree.

7359
03:28:49,210 --> 03:28:49,750
Let's do,

7360
03:28:49,750 --> 03:28:50,583
oh,

7361
03:28:51,130 --> 03:28:52,270
we got mad about Sandy Hook,

7362
03:28:52,271 --> 03:28:53,051
which I think happened.

7363
03:28:53,051 --> 03:28:53,761
I have a Roger question.

7364
03:28:53,761 --> 03:28:58,450
I one I was watching minions three or
four where they go to us and they run

7365
03:28:58,451 --> 03:28:59,530
through the many hands,

7366
03:28:59,531 --> 03:28:59,741
you know,

7367
03:28:59,741 --> 03:29:01,210
run through Hollywood and their,

7368
03:29:01,211 --> 03:29:02,320
and their staging of the moon landing.

7369
03:29:02,650 --> 03:29:03,700
People have a right to do that.

7370
03:29:04,720 --> 03:29:06,320
The truth is nobody
wants to send people up.

7371
03:29:06,321 --> 03:29:07,190
There's a bunch of die,

7372
03:29:07,600 --> 03:29:08,810
a bunch of test Polish die.

7373
03:29:08,811 --> 03:29:10,660
We fly on jumbo jets around the country,

7374
03:29:10,960 --> 03:29:12,010
our cell phones work.

7375
03:29:12,130 --> 03:29:13,570
Do you think that we
definitely went to the moon?

7376
03:29:13,660 --> 03:29:14,260
Absolutely.

7377
03:29:14,260 --> 03:29:15,340
100% absolutely.

7378
03:29:15,370 --> 03:29:16,203
Beg Your Life on it.

7379
03:29:16,210 --> 03:29:17,043
That my live on.

7380
03:29:17,170 --> 03:29:18,250
But the difference is,

7381
03:29:18,251 --> 03:29:20,230
is that they say,

7382
03:29:20,231 --> 03:29:21,160
I say it didn't happen.

7383
03:29:21,490 --> 03:29:25,120
The truth is that we have a type
of Alex Jones and i's moon landing.

7384
03:29:25,480 --> 03:29:26,680
I've denied it a bunch of times.

7385
03:29:26,681 --> 03:29:26,950
They,

7386
03:29:26,950 --> 03:29:27,130
you know,

7387
03:29:27,130 --> 03:29:32,130
they say Alex Jones says that there are
a you human slaves on Mars ever said it.

7388
03:29:33,910 --> 03:29:37,840
But all I'm saying is I know
the real NASA people and

7389
03:29:39,610 --> 03:29:40,780
Warner von Braun,

7390
03:29:40,840 --> 03:29:43,570
the guy who directed all 6
million missions was a Nazi,

7391
03:29:43,571 --> 03:29:44,230
correct?

7392
03:29:44,230 --> 03:29:45,063
Yes.

7393
03:29:45,390 --> 03:29:46,600
He hung out with uh,

7394
03:29:46,990 --> 03:29:47,681
a Walt Disney,

7395
03:29:47,681 --> 03:29:48,514
correct?

7396
03:29:49,120 --> 03:29:49,620
Yeah.

7397
03:29:49,620 --> 03:29:49,910
Yup.

7398
03:29:49,910 --> 03:29:51,970
And who in the 50s just made up space?

7399
03:29:51,971 --> 03:29:52,420
They never,

7400
03:29:52,420 --> 03:29:52,871
no one went.

7401
03:29:52,871 --> 03:29:54,010
Ever went to space.

7402
03:29:54,011 --> 03:29:55,420
How a space Ellison,

7403
03:29:55,510 --> 03:29:57,540
I'm Walt had space.

7404
03:29:57,730 --> 03:30:00,370
Why was on the phone with you
for 45 minutes this morning?

7405
03:30:00,790 --> 03:30:02,890
I told you I have a 12 inch telescope.

7406
03:30:03,130 --> 03:30:04,510
12 inch diameter opening.

7407
03:30:04,511 --> 03:30:05,020
Aperture.

7408
03:30:05,020 --> 03:30:05,440
Yes.

7409
03:30:05,440 --> 03:30:07,960
We talked about it's a fricking
Moja take him 35 millimeter.

7410
03:30:08,200 --> 03:30:09,033
It's there.

7411
03:30:09,070 --> 03:30:09,730
It's there.

7412
03:30:09,730 --> 03:30:11,110
All the shit you see when you look up,

7413
03:30:11,111 --> 03:30:11,944
it's there.

7414
03:30:12,130 --> 03:30:13,330
You get the telescope,

7415
03:30:13,331 --> 03:30:14,650
you can closer to what's going on.

7416
03:30:14,670 --> 03:30:16,750
We're not going to have a
space as fake conversation.

7417
03:30:16,751 --> 03:30:18,030
You told me the fucking lie.

7418
03:30:18,490 --> 03:30:19,330
I can't do this.

7419
03:30:19,390 --> 03:30:20,670
I didn't say the lights or [inaudible].

7420
03:30:21,100 --> 03:30:21,933
I don't know.

7421
03:30:22,600 --> 03:30:23,433
Well,

7422
03:30:23,560 --> 03:30:24,430
I don't know what they are.

7423
03:30:24,490 --> 03:30:24,850
I,

7424
03:30:24,850 --> 03:30:28,120
the way I described this is the
same way I talk about Jujitsu.

7425
03:30:28,330 --> 03:30:28,740
You,

7426
03:30:28,740 --> 03:30:31,550
you should never talk about
how effective martial arts,

7427
03:30:32,250 --> 03:30:34,260
you can't prove that shit.

7428
03:30:34,410 --> 03:30:39,410
You can't do all this thing 3
million miles away like are we even

7429
03:30:42,270 --> 03:30:46,490
put a real people that have souls and
freewill because you could say maybe we

7430
03:30:46,491 --> 03:30:47,324
don't even exist.

7431
03:30:47,330 --> 03:30:48,163
You don't exist.

7432
03:30:48,260 --> 03:30:50,660
Joe Doesn't exist and nobody exists.

7433
03:30:50,690 --> 03:30:54,270
So because we can't be kind
of a space is fucking head.

7434
03:30:54,280 --> 03:30:54,950
We'll break.

7435
03:30:54,950 --> 03:30:55,341
Not Ready.

7436
03:30:55,341 --> 03:30:56,174
Let's not do it.

7437
03:30:56,490 --> 03:30:57,070
The only,

7438
03:30:57,070 --> 03:31:00,680
my point of all that was I don't want
to have it space discussion either,

7439
03:31:00,830 --> 03:31:05,830
but my point is that if there's people
out there that believe we faked going to

7440
03:31:07,701 --> 03:31:08,660
the moon six times,

7441
03:31:08,840 --> 03:31:11,330
you have to understand their skepticism.

7442
03:31:11,360 --> 03:31:12,193
That's yes.

7443
03:31:12,360 --> 03:31:13,193
No,

7444
03:31:13,700 --> 03:31:14,061
hold on.

7445
03:31:14,061 --> 03:31:14,894
You know what I mean?

7446
03:31:15,240 --> 03:31:17,490
We talked about before when
he was talking us down.

7447
03:31:18,020 --> 03:31:20,870
This is what we talked about before when
he was talking about the reason why he

7448
03:31:20,871 --> 03:31:21,770
questions anything.

7449
03:31:21,771 --> 03:31:22,330
It's cause he's,

7450
03:31:22,330 --> 03:31:24,170
he's seen so many different things.

7451
03:31:24,171 --> 03:31:28,430
It turned out to be exactly understanding
earlier and he was actually saying

7452
03:31:28,431 --> 03:31:30,960
that sometimes you can get fucking crazy
with it and you think that everything's

7453
03:31:30,980 --> 03:31:33,440
fake and you call bullshit
on things that really aren't.

7454
03:31:33,440 --> 03:31:35,450
But assuming next generation is real.

7455
03:31:35,930 --> 03:31:36,763
Yes.

7456
03:31:37,100 --> 03:31:39,020
We can do some stuff like what

7457
03:31:40,580 --> 03:31:41,151
we've done,

7458
03:31:41,151 --> 03:31:41,984
man.

7459
03:31:42,170 --> 03:31:43,003
Um,

7460
03:31:44,680 --> 03:31:47,630
what like what like fight
wars and shut like what?

7461
03:31:47,631 --> 03:31:48,530
Like electricity.

7462
03:31:48,650 --> 03:31:49,460
That's awesome.

7463
03:31:49,460 --> 03:31:49,911
Tesla,

7464
03:31:49,911 --> 03:31:50,390
right?

7465
03:31:50,390 --> 03:31:50,800
Yeah.

7466
03:31:50,800 --> 03:31:51,530
All right.

7467
03:31:51,530 --> 03:31:52,450
Where's Tesla now?

7468
03:31:52,770 --> 03:31:55,750
Just how about all the technology
that you enjoy and make your life?

7469
03:31:56,210 --> 03:31:57,043
I love it.

7470
03:31:57,170 --> 03:31:57,700
I love them.

7471
03:31:57,700 --> 03:31:58,360
Signs.

7472
03:31:58,360 --> 03:31:59,250
Of course.

7473
03:31:59,610 --> 03:31:59,960
Of course.

7474
03:31:59,960 --> 03:32:01,900
I'm talking to that's the same science.

7475
03:32:01,910 --> 03:32:02,011
No,

7476
03:32:02,011 --> 03:32:02,270
no.

7477
03:32:02,270 --> 03:32:05,600
Allows people to understand the
distance between earth and Mars.

7478
03:32:05,690 --> 03:32:07,160
That's kind of stuff.

7479
03:32:07,161 --> 03:32:09,340
Then you get into science.

7480
03:32:09,341 --> 03:32:10,174
But by the way,

7481
03:32:11,430 --> 03:32:12,231
you've taught me a lot.

7482
03:32:12,231 --> 03:32:15,330
You're a really smart guy and
entrepreneur and a bad ass shit.

7483
03:32:15,410 --> 03:32:17,450
I think it's healthy
to be where you're at.

7484
03:32:17,451 --> 03:32:18,740
Questioning everything first,

7485
03:32:18,741 --> 03:32:19,574
just buying everything.

7486
03:32:19,770 --> 03:32:22,490
All I'm telling you is
is the stuff we have now.

7487
03:32:22,491 --> 03:32:25,870
A hundred years ago it would be
considered magic and we humans could way.

7488
03:32:26,250 --> 03:32:31,250
I agree with that fucking iPhone
hospital and it has nothing to do.

7489
03:32:32,481 --> 03:32:36,770
It's taste on the main line in the
videos running NASA and I'm like,

7490
03:32:36,771 --> 03:32:37,604
where were there?

7491
03:32:37,650 --> 03:32:39,320
Guess I ran the RCA cameras.

7492
03:32:39,500 --> 03:32:41,900
We fake the photos because
of the radiation belt headed.

7493
03:32:42,080 --> 03:32:42,891
They called him up,

7494
03:32:42,891 --> 03:32:44,030
but when we shouldn't have done that,

7495
03:32:44,060 --> 03:32:45,200
I fucking know what happened.

7496
03:32:45,380 --> 03:32:49,160
That makes way more sense to me and it's
one of the things that Jamie and I have

7497
03:32:49,161 --> 03:32:52,100
actually discussed when we
talked about the Gemini 15 photo,

7498
03:32:52,280 --> 03:32:53,930
the famous photo of Michael Collins.

7499
03:32:54,140 --> 03:32:57,530
That turns out to be just a reverse of
a photo of him on a training mission

7500
03:32:57,800 --> 03:32:59,780
where he's in the hardest one in PR.

7501
03:32:59,840 --> 03:33:00,540
They use the,

7502
03:33:00,540 --> 03:33:02,960
that's what I said is PR agents.

7503
03:33:03,200 --> 03:33:03,891
I didn't go to too.

7504
03:33:03,891 --> 03:33:04,724
I went to three

7505
03:33:06,440 --> 03:33:07,820
beds of NASA engineers.

7506
03:33:07,821 --> 03:33:09,710
One of them was Raymond tick that
allowed me to talk about this.

7507
03:33:10,100 --> 03:33:12,050
Raymond was there running this fricking,

7508
03:33:12,500 --> 03:33:14,150
he ran the lasers on the moon.

7509
03:33:14,330 --> 03:33:15,380
He ran the deals.

7510
03:33:15,381 --> 03:33:20,000
He said what was weird is they had
another group of ships and I'm not,

7511
03:33:20,420 --> 03:33:22,970
you know what pretty much
I just shouldn't do it.

7512
03:33:23,300 --> 03:33:24,260
Another group of ships,

7513
03:33:25,040 --> 03:33:26,210
well they had another group of sheriffs,

7514
03:33:26,211 --> 03:33:30,320
but basically he wouldn't have
Chad and this is not drama.

7515
03:33:30,410 --> 03:33:31,520
I was going to meet with him.

7516
03:33:31,521 --> 03:33:34,300
I met with him at the
former Norad Command base.

7517
03:33:34,340 --> 03:33:35,510
There's the Hilton outside.

7518
03:33:35,511 --> 03:33:36,344
Awesome.

7519
03:33:36,620 --> 03:33:39,120
And he wouldn't tell me and then
like a week later his heart blow,

7520
03:33:39,750 --> 03:33:40,920
but he was ready to tell me.

7521
03:33:40,921 --> 03:33:41,251
He said,

7522
03:33:41,251 --> 03:33:41,461
no,

7523
03:33:41,461 --> 03:33:42,061
it's real,

7524
03:33:42,061 --> 03:33:46,530
but there's more advanced and I mean he
had like presidential letters as house.

7525
03:33:46,531 --> 03:33:46,990
You look at him,

7526
03:33:46,990 --> 03:33:49,010
he's like the main guy
like running the camera.

7527
03:33:49,011 --> 03:33:50,190
It's like number three in NASA,

7528
03:33:50,420 --> 03:33:51,990
like for engineers to fricking gee.

7529
03:33:51,991 --> 03:33:53,570
He was in Vietnam Rant,

7530
03:33:53,571 --> 03:33:56,490
black ops and Cambodia and he said,

7531
03:33:57,450 --> 03:33:58,110
he said,

7532
03:33:58,110 --> 03:33:59,730
well we lost a lot of people,

7533
03:33:59,731 --> 03:34:01,230
but those were clandestine operations.

7534
03:34:01,230 --> 03:34:01,981
I wasn't part of them.

7535
03:34:01,981 --> 03:34:02,930
It's all compartment launched.

7536
03:34:03,290 --> 03:34:03,661
But he said,

7537
03:34:03,661 --> 03:34:07,100
you're right that there were a bunch of
missions beforehand because the US was

7538
03:34:07,110 --> 03:34:10,550
willing to kill 50 people that do
that just to see if they can get some,

7539
03:34:10,551 --> 03:34:13,730
until no one else will be tragic
thing because people think the US.

7540
03:34:13,740 --> 03:34:14,610
Is that great Joe?

7541
03:34:14,700 --> 03:34:14,941
No,

7542
03:34:14,941 --> 03:34:15,774
we were willing to,

7543
03:34:15,810 --> 03:34:17,190
we hadn't met already to die.

7544
03:34:17,400 --> 03:34:17,701
Oh yeah.

7545
03:34:17,701 --> 03:34:19,800
Over and over again for
the one time at work.

7546
03:34:19,950 --> 03:34:21,000
And that's what pisses me off.

7547
03:34:21,001 --> 03:34:22,380
Well Gus Grisham and those,

7548
03:34:22,381 --> 03:34:26,910
the original blew up on them life I blew
up on the launchpad will be incredibly

7549
03:34:26,911 --> 03:34:30,090
tragic if is if they
actually did go to the moon,

7550
03:34:30,240 --> 03:34:32,670
but they fake the footage
because of the radiation.

7551
03:34:32,910 --> 03:34:35,840
So they released this
bullshit beliefs and you know,

7552
03:34:35,850 --> 03:34:36,790
but do you know how,

7553
03:34:36,810 --> 03:34:40,710
how horrific that would be if you were
a guy like Neil Armstrong and you knew

7554
03:34:40,711 --> 03:34:41,850
that the footage was bullshit,

7555
03:34:41,851 --> 03:34:45,060
but you actually had gone to
the moon and you're like fuck.

7556
03:34:45,330 --> 03:34:46,440
And this whole thing was like,

7557
03:34:46,441 --> 03:34:49,170
people were starting to look at why are
these wise or whether they're on wires.

7558
03:34:49,200 --> 03:34:49,840
There's that Isley,

7559
03:34:49,840 --> 03:34:51,360
we were there on trampolines like,

7560
03:34:51,450 --> 03:34:51,571
yeah.

7561
03:34:51,571 --> 03:34:51,901
By the way,

7562
03:34:51,901 --> 03:34:53,610
they all got radiated because it's true.

7563
03:34:53,611 --> 03:34:55,290
Like he says going through that.

7564
03:34:55,291 --> 03:34:57,000
So I got a thousand chest
x rays or something,

7565
03:34:57,260 --> 03:34:57,450
you know,

7566
03:34:57,450 --> 03:34:59,100
even full nude,

7567
03:34:59,101 --> 03:35:00,270
you know it's like 10 texts,

7568
03:35:00,450 --> 03:35:00,991
chestnut tress,

7569
03:35:00,991 --> 03:35:01,824
right?

7570
03:35:03,980 --> 03:35:05,100
I thought it was only one.

7571
03:35:05,130 --> 03:35:06,270
Notice how they know what's more.

7572
03:35:06,310 --> 03:35:08,400
It's notice how the international
flights are all now at night.

7573
03:35:08,970 --> 03:35:09,660
Why is that?

7574
03:35:09,660 --> 03:35:11,250
Because there's fricking
know radiate dude.

7575
03:35:12,950 --> 03:35:13,200
No,

7576
03:35:13,200 --> 03:35:13,381
no,

7577
03:35:13,381 --> 03:35:13,830
no.

7578
03:35:13,830 --> 03:35:18,830
Solar radiation from 35,000 feet to two
two c level on average is 10 feet of

7579
03:35:21,061 --> 03:35:23,910
water and about six inches of stone.

7580
03:35:24,300 --> 03:35:25,133
There's dirt.

7581
03:35:25,180 --> 03:35:25,370
Why?

7582
03:35:25,370 --> 03:35:28,080
Why is the sun so big on the on on the,

7583
03:35:28,860 --> 03:35:29,551
explain that again.

7584
03:35:29,551 --> 03:35:30,384
What are you saying?

7585
03:35:31,620 --> 03:35:33,630
Imagine that the atmosphere is a lynch.

7586
03:35:33,720 --> 03:35:34,553
Okay,

7587
03:35:34,740 --> 03:35:35,251
so when you,

7588
03:35:35,251 --> 03:35:38,970
why do you think the sun or the moon
looks so much bigger on the horizon?

7589
03:35:40,160 --> 03:35:40,850
Why is that?

7590
03:35:40,850 --> 03:35:41,683
You ever thought about that?

7591
03:35:42,800 --> 03:35:43,910
I always thought it was just,

7592
03:35:43,930 --> 03:35:45,200
it's a refraction Harrison,

7593
03:35:45,830 --> 03:35:46,610
cause it's on there.

7594
03:35:46,610 --> 03:35:47,443
That

7595
03:35:50,550 --> 03:35:51,181
why is it red?

7596
03:35:51,181 --> 03:35:52,020
The atmosphere.

7597
03:35:52,500 --> 03:35:55,040
You're looking hair and yeah,

7598
03:35:55,050 --> 03:35:57,540
you're looking through a thousand
miles instead of 20 miles.

7599
03:35:57,600 --> 03:35:58,433
Okay.

7600
03:35:58,470 --> 03:36:01,620
Show the moon gets smaller and you're
just totally white as it goes up.

7601
03:36:01,830 --> 03:36:02,663
Right?

7602
03:36:02,830 --> 03:36:03,790
So this is,

7603
03:36:03,791 --> 03:36:04,710
this is like astronomy.

7604
03:36:04,850 --> 03:36:09,850
I'm on it because you're looking
at it on the plane and I forget,

7605
03:36:10,810 --> 03:36:11,130
uh,

7606
03:36:11,130 --> 03:36:11,930
we were talking,

7607
03:36:11,930 --> 03:36:13,320
there's no flights.

7608
03:36:13,650 --> 03:36:14,071
Yeah.

7609
03:36:14,071 --> 03:36:15,510
Radiation years,

7610
03:36:16,770 --> 03:36:17,603
whatever it is.

7611
03:36:17,700 --> 03:36:22,170
You get a bunch of chest x rays when
you fly during the day because the sun

7612
03:36:22,171 --> 03:36:23,040
solar radiation,

7613
03:36:23,041 --> 03:36:24,420
because you're above,

7614
03:36:25,180 --> 03:36:26,340
everybody knows you're in the mountains.

7615
03:36:26,341 --> 03:36:27,210
You get a worst sunburn.

7616
03:36:27,240 --> 03:36:32,240
Why isn't less oxygen less dropping the V,

7617
03:36:32,420 --> 03:36:35,920
the UV show when you're at 30,000 feet,

7618
03:36:35,921 --> 03:36:36,410
that's above.

7619
03:36:36,410 --> 03:36:37,243
There's The Himalayan.

7620
03:36:37,710 --> 03:36:38,350
Yeah.

7621
03:36:38,350 --> 03:36:38,771
You,

7622
03:36:38,771 --> 03:36:41,140
you are up there and there's no,

7623
03:36:41,200 --> 03:36:41,530
there's,

7624
03:36:41,530 --> 03:36:43,000
there's on average 35,000 feet.

7625
03:36:43,001 --> 03:36:44,560
This is NASA statistics.

7626
03:36:44,830 --> 03:36:46,290
Probably not true at the end,

7627
03:36:46,291 --> 03:36:50,230
the feet of water and six inches of stone,

7628
03:36:51,280 --> 03:36:52,113
because there's,

7629
03:36:52,140 --> 03:36:56,260
if you condensed 35,000 feet of dust,

7630
03:36:56,830 --> 03:36:57,663
the filter,

7631
03:36:57,760 --> 03:36:58,570
oh wow.

7632
03:36:58,570 --> 03:37:00,010
Why wouldn't you hit a
filter on your iPhone?

7633
03:37:00,011 --> 03:37:00,850
Is it turn another color?

7634
03:37:01,060 --> 03:37:01,893
Put a filter over it.

7635
03:37:02,310 --> 03:37:03,143
Right?

7636
03:37:03,220 --> 03:37:04,060
So think about,

7637
03:37:04,061 --> 03:37:07,330
think about the atmosphere when you're
looking straight up the boons fucking

7638
03:37:07,331 --> 03:37:08,164
white.

7639
03:37:09,770 --> 03:37:10,581
Looking at this angle,

7640
03:37:10,581 --> 03:37:11,260
it's yellow,

7641
03:37:11,260 --> 03:37:11,900
right?

7642
03:37:11,900 --> 03:37:14,030
It's big and orange on the like,

7643
03:37:14,031 --> 03:37:14,541
damn,

7644
03:37:14,541 --> 03:37:15,374
that's big.

7645
03:37:15,380 --> 03:37:16,580
It's not just where it's coming up.

7646
03:37:16,581 --> 03:37:17,360
That's part of it,

7647
03:37:17,360 --> 03:37:17,750
right?

7648
03:37:17,750 --> 03:37:18,650
It's the itch.

7649
03:37:18,680 --> 03:37:19,910
It's bubbled,

7650
03:37:20,330 --> 03:37:21,163
it's deformed.

7651
03:37:21,260 --> 03:37:23,480
It's like looking through a
pair of glasses on the edge.

7652
03:37:23,510 --> 03:37:25,400
So you're looking through
all that atmosphere.

7653
03:37:25,401 --> 03:37:26,600
You look at through pollution,

7654
03:37:26,601 --> 03:37:27,680
you'll look through dirt,

7655
03:37:27,830 --> 03:37:28,663
everything.

7656
03:37:29,490 --> 03:37:30,323
Yeah.

7657
03:37:30,790 --> 03:37:31,690
My Dad told me all that.

7658
03:37:31,960 --> 03:37:32,920
That's fucking amazing.

7659
03:37:33,920 --> 03:37:34,753
Know.

7660
03:37:36,970 --> 03:37:38,350
So that's why moons are red,

7661
03:37:40,630 --> 03:37:44,020
that they're red when they rise and
they're white when they go to the top.

7662
03:37:44,160 --> 03:37:45,640
So all the shit we're
looking at it through.

7663
03:37:47,830 --> 03:37:48,071
Yeah,

7664
03:37:48,071 --> 03:37:49,850
we've got a weird situation,

7665
03:37:49,851 --> 03:37:50,320
Huh?

7666
03:37:50,320 --> 03:37:53,920
A big ass one quarter
size planet just floating.

7667
03:37:54,910 --> 03:37:56,170
Just floating above us.

7668
03:37:56,171 --> 03:37:57,004
We stare at it.

7669
03:37:57,280 --> 03:37:58,390
Well it's a full moon tonight.

7670
03:37:58,391 --> 03:37:59,440
That is fucking weird.

7671
03:37:59,730 --> 03:38:00,563
Is a planet.

7672
03:38:00,580 --> 03:38:01,450
It's right there.

7673
03:38:01,700 --> 03:38:05,650
I fell asleep at like 10 o'clock last
night and miss your call and I woke up at

7674
03:38:05,651 --> 03:38:07,690
like three 30 and I had to
get up and I looked out,

7675
03:38:07,760 --> 03:38:09,520
it looked fake news show,

7676
03:38:09,530 --> 03:38:11,260
sometimes half moon,

7677
03:38:11,490 --> 03:38:15,160
and I was looking out the
hotel like 500 yards Shamir,

7678
03:38:15,490 --> 03:38:17,020
and I'm looking at beautiful that has,

7679
03:38:17,021 --> 03:38:17,441
he's just like,

7680
03:38:17,441 --> 03:38:17,920
hey,

7681
03:38:17,920 --> 03:38:20,230
it's okay to say it's made out of cheese.

7682
03:38:20,250 --> 03:38:21,083
Did you probably isn't.

7683
03:38:21,160 --> 03:38:23,440
Did you ever see that movie dark city Gal?

7684
03:38:23,500 --> 03:38:23,811
Yeah.

7685
03:38:23,811 --> 03:38:26,320
I love the way fucking
movie Kiefer Sutherland.

7686
03:38:26,650 --> 03:38:28,000
Fucking great movie.

7687
03:38:28,180 --> 03:38:29,330
Sometimes I would move,

7688
03:38:29,331 --> 03:38:30,370
it was like a twilight zone.

7689
03:38:30,400 --> 03:38:31,690
It's like a twilight zone.

7690
03:38:31,720 --> 03:38:32,531
It's a classic.

7691
03:38:32,531 --> 03:38:34,000
I watch that motherfucker again,

7692
03:38:34,150 --> 03:38:37,360
but it makes me feel
sometimes like reality,

7693
03:38:37,830 --> 03:38:38,290
like,

7694
03:38:38,290 --> 03:38:43,290
like that movie was so strange because
it was like this weird scripted reality

7695
03:38:43,691 --> 03:38:44,680
that these people would show.

7696
03:38:44,830 --> 03:38:48,910
They'd have to find a way to
the surface and shit is real.

7697
03:38:49,210 --> 03:38:49,690
Yes.

7698
03:38:49,690 --> 03:38:50,740
Your consciousness is,

7699
03:38:50,940 --> 03:38:51,090
no,

7700
03:38:51,090 --> 03:38:51,211
no,

7701
03:38:51,211 --> 03:38:51,331
no.

7702
03:38:51,331 --> 03:38:52,164
I'm not saying no,

7703
03:38:52,800 --> 03:38:52,921
no,

7704
03:38:52,921 --> 03:38:53,101
no.

7705
03:38:53,101 --> 03:38:53,401
I agree.

7706
03:38:53,401 --> 03:38:55,730
It's almost saying it's
fascinating and great times,

7707
03:38:55,740 --> 03:38:56,011
so sure.

7708
03:38:56,011 --> 03:38:56,310
You're right.

7709
03:38:56,310 --> 03:38:57,111
That movie I'm saying,

7710
03:38:57,111 --> 03:38:57,730
you're right.

7711
03:38:57,730 --> 03:38:58,563
He is virtual,

7712
03:38:58,680 --> 03:38:59,860
but Uriel,

7713
03:38:59,890 --> 03:39:00,221
yes,

7714
03:39:00,221 --> 03:39:00,790
you're real too.

7715
03:39:00,790 --> 03:39:01,930
You've been put in,

7716
03:39:01,931 --> 03:39:06,850
all of us were put into a simulation
to basically test us and that's the big

7717
03:39:06,851 --> 03:39:08,230
thing I'm trying to get across to people.

7718
03:39:08,860 --> 03:39:09,250
Damn.

7719
03:39:09,250 --> 03:39:10,083
Alex Jones.

7720
03:39:12,700 --> 03:39:13,900
Let's wrap this motherfucker up.

7721
03:39:16,630 --> 03:39:17,040
Let's eat,

7722
03:39:17,040 --> 03:39:17,440
man,

7723
03:39:17,440 --> 03:39:18,273
let me ask this question.

7724
03:39:18,340 --> 03:39:18,641
Okay,

7725
03:39:18,641 --> 03:39:19,474
go ahead.

7726
03:39:20,440 --> 03:39:21,610
You can helicopter in.

7727
03:39:21,611 --> 03:39:26,611
It's South Africa or wherever I can you
imagine the film Siki searching flat

7728
03:39:27,461 --> 03:39:30,450
earth and he brought up was
sending a representative.

7729
03:39:30,451 --> 03:39:31,140
We see.

7730
03:39:31,140 --> 03:39:31,331
No,

7731
03:39:31,331 --> 03:39:31,391
no,

7732
03:39:31,391 --> 03:39:32,080
no.

7733
03:39:32,080 --> 03:39:35,240
You should be on Chicago
and was a representative.

7734
03:39:35,270 --> 03:39:36,103
Do you have a guy?

7735
03:39:36,290 --> 03:39:37,600
I'll have it like a contest.

7736
03:39:37,620 --> 03:39:38,453
You really believe him.

7737
03:39:38,780 --> 03:39:40,090
Oh that's a good move but contest.

7738
03:39:40,110 --> 03:39:40,610
Yeah.

7739
03:39:40,610 --> 03:39:43,510
And then we'll just have a camera
man and the whole camera man.

7740
03:39:43,550 --> 03:39:46,000
You paid for the camera man's flight gps,

7741
03:39:46,020 --> 03:39:47,410
those hundreds of these satellites.

7742
03:39:47,440 --> 03:39:50,780
It was Amy can fill 64 GPS.

7743
03:39:50,960 --> 03:39:53,150
So there's this whole gps and a,

7744
03:39:53,151 --> 03:39:55,430
you can like leave la on a,

7745
03:39:55,431 --> 03:39:58,290
on a ship and you can go all
the way over to Japan and she,

7746
03:39:58,291 --> 03:40:02,330
everybody and go down around India and
around Africa and he'd go land in New

7747
03:40:02,330 --> 03:40:02,331
York.

7748
03:40:02,331 --> 03:40:02,691
We can do it.

7749
03:40:02,691 --> 03:40:04,070
If it's all a flat plane,

7750
03:40:04,071 --> 03:40:04,670
that's like,

7751
03:40:04,670 --> 03:40:05,750
you're just not thinking right.

7752
03:40:05,780 --> 03:40:07,220
You could do need to go anywhere you want.

7753
03:40:07,221 --> 03:40:07,910
If it's flat,

7754
03:40:07,910 --> 03:40:08,661
you just go anywhere.

7755
03:40:08,661 --> 03:40:09,500
You want people to think like,

7756
03:40:09,501 --> 03:40:11,290
how did you travel around me today?

7757
03:40:11,320 --> 03:40:12,340
You circumnavigate.

7758
03:40:14,210 --> 03:40:16,540
You told me this morning that drove us,

7759
03:40:16,560 --> 03:40:17,300
get off this.

7760
03:40:17,300 --> 03:40:18,560
You told me this morning,

7761
03:40:19,880 --> 03:40:20,713
not this morning,

7762
03:40:20,720 --> 03:40:22,370
yesterday or this morning.

7763
03:40:24,200 --> 03:40:28,790
You said you shed basically didn't,

7764
03:40:28,910 --> 03:40:30,560
there was no way to prove any of this.

7765
03:40:31,550 --> 03:40:32,580
Approve any of what?

7766
03:40:33,470 --> 03:40:34,580
What he's on about this.

7767
03:40:35,510 --> 03:40:38,430
What's this meeting space you're,

7768
03:40:38,440 --> 03:40:41,480
you're saying you're generalizing?

7769
03:40:41,570 --> 03:40:41,721
No,

7770
03:40:41,721 --> 03:40:42,300
I'm not mad.

7771
03:40:42,300 --> 03:40:42,861
You questioning.

7772
03:40:42,861 --> 03:40:43,694
I think it's great.

7773
03:40:43,850 --> 03:40:45,920
I'm not go to jail or be shipped.

7774
03:40:46,550 --> 03:40:47,390
You just said that.

7775
03:40:47,391 --> 03:40:49,420
I said something and I don't
even know what you think.

7776
03:40:49,430 --> 03:40:50,161
This whole problem is.

7777
03:40:50,161 --> 03:40:50,994
I got Alzheimer's.

7778
03:40:51,330 --> 03:40:52,970
What do you think this all this.

7779
03:40:52,971 --> 03:40:57,971
I'm shit with people thinking the earth
is flat or people thinking spaces fake.

7780
03:40:58,401 --> 03:40:59,450
What do you think that's coming from?

7781
03:40:59,660 --> 03:41:00,440
I'll tell you,

7782
03:41:00,440 --> 03:41:01,630
it might be able to get any food here.

7783
03:41:01,631 --> 03:41:01,880
View.

7784
03:41:01,880 --> 03:41:02,870
Oh my God.

7785
03:41:02,871 --> 03:41:05,720
I'm going to have to
set the spectrum show.

7786
03:41:05,721 --> 03:41:08,930
You've got people that don't even know
if they're human or of life exist.

7787
03:41:09,230 --> 03:41:13,010
It's just all hallucination because
they'd been lied to so much for so long.

7788
03:41:13,011 --> 03:41:13,844
They don't know what's true.

7789
03:41:13,940 --> 03:41:17,030
And then over here you've got people that
just believe whatever they see on CNN

7790
03:41:17,780 --> 03:41:18,291
and me,

7791
03:41:18,291 --> 03:41:19,730
I'm just trying to look at everything on,

7792
03:41:19,731 --> 03:41:19,881
well,

7793
03:41:19,881 --> 03:41:20,511
they've lot a lot,

7794
03:41:20,511 --> 03:41:21,321
but sometimes there's not.

7795
03:41:21,321 --> 03:41:22,940
That oftentimes isn't competence.

7796
03:41:22,941 --> 03:41:23,774
What's real?

7797
03:41:23,780 --> 03:41:27,380
And so I don't blame it any that's like
way over here or other people that are

7798
03:41:27,381 --> 03:41:30,080
like way over here because they're
trying to find some solace and believe

7799
03:41:30,081 --> 03:41:31,100
there's order of the universe.

7800
03:41:31,430 --> 03:41:33,110
The truth is there's not
order in the universe.

7801
03:41:33,410 --> 03:41:36,590
There's people trying to bring order to
the universe and that's why they stage

7802
03:41:36,591 --> 03:41:39,770
events so they can try to
bring order within that event.

7803
03:41:40,200 --> 03:41:45,200
That's all I'm running an been and you're
talking about no Northwoods or Gulf of

7804
03:41:45,500 --> 03:41:46,130
Tonkin or false,

7805
03:41:46,130 --> 03:41:47,180
whatever the thing is or,

7806
03:41:47,181 --> 03:41:49,250
or taking a real event and making a big,

7807
03:41:49,251 --> 03:41:51,140
but it's not bad to question that.

7808
03:41:51,440 --> 03:41:54,470
And so how do we get convinced to say,

7809
03:41:54,710 --> 03:41:55,543
well,

7810
03:41:56,470 --> 03:41:56,690
you know,

7811
03:41:56,690 --> 03:42:00,440
I asked questions and I didn't get to
be shut down as long as I'm legitimately

7812
03:42:00,441 --> 03:42:01,111
asking questions.

7813
03:42:01,111 --> 03:42:02,000
So there's going to judge that.

7814
03:42:02,180 --> 03:42:03,170
I have that right.

7815
03:42:03,590 --> 03:42:05,090
So that's where we're all going.

7816
03:42:05,091 --> 03:42:07,640
Just what is the system
won't get rid of free speech,

7817
03:42:07,641 --> 03:42:07,881
right?

7818
03:42:07,881 --> 03:42:08,511
To self defense,

7819
03:42:08,511 --> 03:42:11,630
the family to fend those
things and ask yourselves,

7820
03:42:11,660 --> 03:42:13,340
what are we about to men?

7821
03:42:13,370 --> 03:42:14,203
I believe in that.

7822
03:42:15,320 --> 03:42:16,340
You can say that shit again.

7823
03:42:16,341 --> 03:42:19,490
What was it right to
bear arms free speech.

7824
03:42:19,670 --> 03:42:20,421
And what was the third one?

7825
03:42:20,421 --> 03:42:21,200
Family.

7826
03:42:21,200 --> 03:42:22,033
Family.

7827
03:42:22,650 --> 03:42:24,740
What were the big amazing,

7828
03:42:25,400 --> 03:42:26,540
John Asks you a question.

7829
03:42:26,600 --> 03:42:27,291
Who was the big three?

7830
03:42:27,291 --> 03:42:28,124
Say that again.

7831
03:42:32,730 --> 03:42:35,880
I think mystery is
what's having mysteries.

7832
03:42:35,890 --> 03:42:36,723
What's key

7833
03:42:38,160 --> 03:42:39,210
now you get wine.

7834
03:42:39,500 --> 03:42:40,710
And I appreciate you having me on guys.

7835
03:42:41,250 --> 03:42:42,570
I don't want to be like,

7836
03:42:42,571 --> 03:42:44,250
my life is not sandy hook.

7837
03:42:44,251 --> 03:42:45,920
I'm [inaudible] tell me,

7838
03:42:46,210 --> 03:42:47,980
you're telling me earlier
that you were actually,

7839
03:42:47,981 --> 03:42:48,250
you,

7840
03:42:48,250 --> 03:42:49,630
even before all this happened,

7841
03:42:49,840 --> 03:42:51,670
you were planning your exit strategy.

7842
03:42:51,880 --> 03:42:53,290
Like you get weary of this.

7843
03:42:54,280 --> 03:42:54,581
Yeah.

7844
03:42:54,581 --> 03:42:57,460
And it's not like I'm afraid of the fight,

7845
03:42:57,880 --> 03:43:02,880
but I'm 45 and I've had a long adventurous
life so I'd probably like 60 and I

7846
03:43:05,351 --> 03:43:06,490
was already like,

7847
03:43:06,491 --> 03:43:09,730
I wasn't sure about Trump or whatever
has really bad feeling when he got

7848
03:43:09,731 --> 03:43:10,091
elected.

7849
03:43:10,091 --> 03:43:10,841
Not that he was bad,

7850
03:43:10,841 --> 03:43:14,380
just like other wars about it start and
then I was already planning to kind of

7851
03:43:14,381 --> 03:43:15,940
face tanks out just cause I don't know,

7852
03:43:15,970 --> 03:43:19,840
like down when I'm 55 of a heart attack
and the fact that they attack me so much

7853
03:43:19,841 --> 03:43:24,300
makes me have to battle and fight
and never give up and and and,

7854
03:43:24,301 --> 03:43:27,790
and so it's not like they even
wore me down before they ever,

7855
03:43:28,210 --> 03:43:29,230
they kept me in the game.

7856
03:43:29,231 --> 03:43:30,064
I want to explain it.

7857
03:43:30,220 --> 03:43:34,080
They kept me in the game attacking
me in lying about me because now I'm,

7858
03:43:34,090 --> 03:43:35,520
well I've now become,

7859
03:43:35,521 --> 03:43:36,354
when I was worried about,

7860
03:43:37,390 --> 03:43:38,710
now I dream about this stuff.

7861
03:43:39,180 --> 03:43:39,490
Yeah.

7862
03:43:39,490 --> 03:43:41,350
That was what you were
worried about initially.

7863
03:43:41,650 --> 03:43:41,891
Yeah,

7864
03:43:41,891 --> 03:43:43,180
because I realized about the four year,

7865
03:43:43,190 --> 03:43:43,970
five years ago,

7866
03:43:43,970 --> 03:43:46,540
it's obsessive that I was
already totally obsessed.

7867
03:43:46,610 --> 03:43:46,871
You were,

7868
03:43:46,871 --> 03:43:50,620
you were telling me that it fucks with
your head that this certain amount of it

7869
03:43:50,621 --> 03:43:52,420
after a while it just
fucks with your head.

7870
03:43:53,070 --> 03:43:53,341
Yeah,

7871
03:43:53,341 --> 03:43:54,174
the negativity.

7872
03:43:54,420 --> 03:43:55,230
Yeah.

7873
03:43:55,230 --> 03:43:56,730
And I like to have dreams.

7874
03:43:57,200 --> 03:43:59,160
I have like dreams are like 20 years long,

7875
03:43:59,161 --> 03:44:02,880
like you said about DMT where
I'm a farmer and like it's a,

7876
03:44:02,910 --> 03:44:06,780
it's like 500 years ago and I'm just
like planning things and eating food and

7877
03:44:06,781 --> 03:44:08,970
like put my kids to sleep and like,

7878
03:44:09,120 --> 03:44:09,451
you know,

7879
03:44:09,451 --> 03:44:12,000
cutting trees down and
like walking around.

7880
03:44:12,030 --> 03:44:15,420
I have dreams just like normal
and just being a normal person.

7881
03:44:15,990 --> 03:44:16,511
And so I,

7882
03:44:16,511 --> 03:44:17,344
I never,

7883
03:44:17,370 --> 03:44:18,600
I didn't like the global state.

7884
03:44:18,610 --> 03:44:19,620
Like they have like all these shows,

7885
03:44:19,621 --> 03:44:20,131
homeland,

7886
03:44:20,131 --> 03:44:20,220
all,

7887
03:44:20,220 --> 03:44:21,330
he showed her on this big demon.

7888
03:44:21,690 --> 03:44:25,530
I didn't like calculate what I was going
to do and then I was already not ready

7889
03:44:25,531 --> 03:44:26,190
to give up.

7890
03:44:26,190 --> 03:44:31,190
I was ready to move on and innovate and
now it's almost like it's God doing it.

7891
03:44:32,180 --> 03:44:32,581
God's like,

7892
03:44:32,581 --> 03:44:32,731
no,

7893
03:44:32,731 --> 03:44:32,851
no,

7894
03:44:32,851 --> 03:44:33,690
it's not that easy.

7895
03:44:34,500 --> 03:44:37,240
You're going to be pinned against the
wall by your enemies and you're going to

7896
03:44:37,241 --> 03:44:38,730
fight to the death.

7897
03:44:39,290 --> 03:44:41,200
And then I don't believe God's a say this,

7898
03:44:41,220 --> 03:44:42,810
but I realize it's God's planned.

7899
03:44:43,620 --> 03:44:44,760
I'm not going to be turned loose.

7900
03:44:44,761 --> 03:44:48,960
I wasn't just going to do a couple tours
in this fight and be be turned loose.

7901
03:44:49,500 --> 03:44:54,500
And so it shows each bin it's been framed
realize that this is all big stage and

7902
03:44:55,831 --> 03:44:57,360
God wants to see some people dance.

7903
03:44:57,990 --> 03:44:59,520
But I tell you the global is take,

7904
03:44:59,521 --> 03:45:01,800
they're like running me out or
they think they've gotten me.

7905
03:45:01,801 --> 03:45:02,431
It's the difference.

7906
03:45:02,431 --> 03:45:03,750
It's like it's,

7907
03:45:03,751 --> 03:45:04,021
it's,

7908
03:45:04,021 --> 03:45:04,361
it's,

7909
03:45:04,361 --> 03:45:06,870
it's the opposite now they've
turned me into this maniac.

7910
03:45:07,680 --> 03:45:08,460
Well there's a,

7911
03:45:08,460 --> 03:45:13,460
there's definitely some sort of a
struggle going on right now and there's a,

7912
03:45:14,410 --> 03:45:18,870
it's a seems to be like a universal
struggle for figuring out what people are

7913
03:45:18,871 --> 03:45:22,170
and how we should behave
and who gets to decide that.

7914
03:45:22,590 --> 03:45:26,340
And there's certain universal truths are
ignored and there are certain ones that

7915
03:45:26,341 --> 03:45:30,490
are emphasis over emphasized and there's
certain ones that you know that are in

7916
03:45:30,491 --> 03:45:33,460
the goldilocks spot and
we were working it out.

7917
03:45:33,461 --> 03:45:35,680
I think that's part of what's
going on with human beings.

7918
03:45:35,980 --> 03:45:37,390
But will we have to be really,

7919
03:45:37,540 --> 03:45:42,540
really careful of is that by silencing
some people and never giving them any

7920
03:45:43,871 --> 03:45:45,400
path to retribution,

7921
03:45:46,000 --> 03:45:48,400
we create eternal enemies.

7922
03:45:48,910 --> 03:45:49,391
And this is,

7923
03:45:49,391 --> 03:45:52,660
this is what easily could be happening
right now when someone doesn't have

7924
03:45:52,970 --> 03:45:54,610
ability to express themselves

7925
03:45:54,950 --> 03:45:58,310
because an evil force once conflict and
what you say is totally know if it's an

7926
03:45:58,311 --> 03:45:59,031
evil force,

7927
03:45:59,031 --> 03:46:01,010
but it's an archetypal form there.

7928
03:46:01,160 --> 03:46:03,680
They're listening to
all those around them.

7929
03:46:03,710 --> 03:46:08,390
And there's a hive hive mind sort
of thinking to a lot of this.

7930
03:46:08,391 --> 03:46:10,600
There's not a lot of debate about it.

7931
03:46:10,630 --> 03:46:11,030
So I,

7932
03:46:11,030 --> 03:46:12,530
let's just say this Joe and,

7933
03:46:12,531 --> 03:46:13,364
and to,

7934
03:46:13,670 --> 03:46:14,503
um,

7935
03:46:14,830 --> 03:46:15,401
10th planet,

7936
03:46:15,401 --> 03:46:16,234
everybody else,

7937
03:46:17,000 --> 03:46:20,470
you didn't give into the
pressuring of the threat.

7938
03:46:20,860 --> 03:46:22,780
It was more than nagging like a siren,

7939
03:46:22,781 --> 03:46:23,710
like a bitching woman,

7940
03:46:23,711 --> 03:46:24,544
not against women.

7941
03:46:25,870 --> 03:46:26,280
But I mean,

7942
03:46:26,280 --> 03:46:27,113
I get it.

7943
03:46:27,360 --> 03:46:28,193
Why us?

7944
03:46:28,300 --> 03:46:30,130
And so that's why you didn't have me on.

7945
03:46:30,131 --> 03:46:34,840
But then you realize I was just a symbol
of you just trying to live the life and

7946
03:46:34,841 --> 03:46:36,610
put out good ideas and talk to people.

7947
03:46:36,850 --> 03:46:37,391
But folks,

7948
03:46:37,391 --> 03:46:38,770
you're going to make you choose a side.

7949
03:46:39,250 --> 03:46:41,320
And that's what's happening
in this quickening ish.

7950
03:46:41,770 --> 03:46:42,760
I don't want to choose a side.

7951
03:46:43,200 --> 03:46:44,760
Ryan Seacrest has got it nailed.

7952
03:46:45,240 --> 03:46:48,090
Nobody's coming to Ryan Seacrest
for like political advice.

7953
03:46:48,180 --> 03:46:49,050
He's got it nailed.

7954
03:46:49,260 --> 03:46:50,490
He hosts a bunch of shows.

7955
03:46:50,491 --> 03:46:51,540
A real nice guys.

7956
03:46:51,541 --> 03:46:52,680
Got a great smile.

7957
03:46:52,980 --> 03:46:53,910
He's figured it out.

7958
03:46:53,950 --> 03:46:54,451
But you understand,

7959
03:46:54,451 --> 03:46:55,970
understands you have in that sweet spot,

7960
03:46:55,971 --> 03:46:56,291
man.

7961
03:46:56,291 --> 03:46:58,410
You're looking at you going dummy,

7962
03:46:59,340 --> 03:47:01,600
we are talking about
anything and everything.

7963
03:47:01,970 --> 03:47:02,803
Oh my God,

7964
03:47:03,350 --> 03:47:04,190
just them sunlight.

7965
03:47:05,480 --> 03:47:07,670
Entropy is stagnant water.

7966
03:47:08,090 --> 03:47:08,271
Oh,

7967
03:47:08,271 --> 03:47:10,580
it's still nothing's going on.

7968
03:47:10,581 --> 03:47:11,510
It's all clear.

7969
03:47:11,700 --> 03:47:13,010
It's dead and rotting.

7970
03:47:13,220 --> 03:47:14,120
What's alive?

7971
03:47:14,121 --> 03:47:14,450
Ocean.

7972
03:47:14,450 --> 03:47:15,770
Big crashing waves.

7973
03:47:15,790 --> 03:47:16,490
Yes,

7974
03:47:16,490 --> 03:47:17,590
it's Jersey.

7975
03:47:18,620 --> 03:47:19,130
I,

7976
03:47:19,130 --> 03:47:20,270
I've seen beyond that.

7977
03:47:20,660 --> 03:47:21,410
Everybody has,

7978
03:47:21,410 --> 03:47:21,801
but I've,

7979
03:47:21,801 --> 03:47:25,580
I've seen way beyond cause you
want to be in the conflict.

7980
03:47:25,610 --> 03:47:27,020
You want to be in the fight.

7981
03:47:27,050 --> 03:47:29,180
You want to take all your,

7982
03:47:29,181 --> 03:47:30,650
you're not successful Joe.

7983
03:47:30,890 --> 03:47:32,120
Cause you played along with the system.

7984
03:47:32,121 --> 03:47:34,970
You're successful because you did it
organically and real doesn't mean it's

7985
03:47:34,971 --> 03:47:35,391
perfect.

7986
03:47:35,391 --> 03:47:36,260
Doesn't mean it's bad.

7987
03:47:36,560 --> 03:47:37,393
It was real.

7988
03:47:37,610 --> 03:47:39,890
That's why your success and
then they come in and you think,

7989
03:47:39,920 --> 03:47:41,330
oh I'm not saying you're bad.

7990
03:47:41,331 --> 03:47:42,110
I'm the same way.

7991
03:47:42,110 --> 03:47:42,351
Oh,

7992
03:47:42,351 --> 03:47:45,620
all these people are telling me how
great I am up play ball with them because

7993
03:47:45,621 --> 03:47:46,030
I've got,

7994
03:47:46,030 --> 03:47:46,290
you know,

7995
03:47:46,290 --> 03:47:47,123
this thing.

7996
03:47:47,300 --> 03:47:49,490
But they want you
because they're soulless.

7997
03:47:50,120 --> 03:47:52,370
And so all I'm saying is
you've made the right decision.

7998
03:47:52,940 --> 03:47:56,900
And I'm not just saying having beyond
because I'm not perfect is deciding no

7999
03:47:56,901 --> 03:47:57,451
America,

8000
03:47:57,451 --> 03:47:58,450
sell America the world,

8001
03:47:58,460 --> 03:47:59,240
still the world.

8002
03:47:59,240 --> 03:48:02,270
We're allowed to talk about real things
and heroic things because they want to

8003
03:48:02,271 --> 03:48:05,570
shut other voices down so they
can lie about those voices.

8004
03:48:05,700 --> 03:48:05,980
And,

8005
03:48:05,980 --> 03:48:08,260
and any idea that fears,

8006
03:48:08,270 --> 03:48:09,470
exposure or fears,

8007
03:48:09,471 --> 03:48:10,760
debate is a failed idea.

8008
03:48:11,160 --> 03:48:11,461
Well,

8009
03:48:11,461 --> 03:48:11,941
you know,

8010
03:48:11,941 --> 03:48:16,050
I have a unique perspective and my
perspective is less and less inclined to

8011
03:48:16,051 --> 03:48:21,051
pursue it in the idea that it's a fight
and more to be able to pursue reason and

8012
03:48:22,171 --> 03:48:23,850
to have everybody
communicate with each other.

8013
03:48:23,851 --> 03:48:27,640
Because I think part of what the fuck
is wrong with all of us today is that

8014
03:48:27,641 --> 03:48:27,980
people

8015
03:48:27,980 --> 03:48:29,510
are so willing to take sides,

8016
03:48:29,511 --> 03:48:33,200
so willing to join teams and so willing
to fight about shit that they really

8017
03:48:33,201 --> 03:48:34,490
don't have to fight about.

8018
03:48:36,110 --> 03:48:36,771
I wanted to say this,

8019
03:48:36,771 --> 03:48:37,341
I'm a sad cause.

8020
03:48:37,341 --> 03:48:38,174
It's just so powerful.

8021
03:48:38,960 --> 03:48:42,710
I don't dislike Donald Trump and I
think he's done some good things.

8022
03:48:42,711 --> 03:48:45,020
I'm trying to do piece and trying
to get jobs back to America,

8023
03:48:45,140 --> 03:48:46,400
but I hate Donald Trump

8024
03:48:48,080 --> 03:48:52,430
because I got behind him because I knew
Hillary was bad and then he became my

8025
03:48:52,431 --> 03:48:52,960
identity.

8026
03:48:52,960 --> 03:48:53,960
He is not a bad guy,

8027
03:48:53,961 --> 03:48:58,961
but the truth is I hate him more than
Hillary Clinton because he's who I am now

8028
03:48:59,091 --> 03:49:00,590
and whatever he does is who I am.

8029
03:49:01,190 --> 03:49:02,023
Mcdonald's from.

8030
03:49:02,340 --> 03:49:04,310
I'm with America and
freedom and everything else,

8031
03:49:04,400 --> 03:49:07,160
and I'm not throwing under the bus to
get towards soils on my back though.

8032
03:49:07,161 --> 03:49:08,690
They already asked me for the,

8033
03:49:08,691 --> 03:49:09,800
for the reasons I'm a with them.

8034
03:49:10,490 --> 03:49:12,110
I'm not against even Trump,

8035
03:49:12,830 --> 03:49:17,830
but I get in a fight like this that's so
dumbed down that then no matter what I

8036
03:49:17,931 --> 03:49:18,410
do,

8037
03:49:18,410 --> 03:49:21,260
they take my radical and this
my weirdness to hurt Trump,

8038
03:49:21,890 --> 03:49:23,990
but then all it does is
like radio attack me.

8039
03:49:23,991 --> 03:49:24,121
I don't,

8040
03:49:24,121 --> 03:49:25,190
I don't know how to describe it,

8041
03:49:25,460 --> 03:49:26,710
but it's like I,

8042
03:49:26,740 --> 03:49:31,190
it's like Trump is breaking my legs every
day and it's not like I'm not willing

8043
03:49:31,191 --> 03:49:35,090
to go through the pain except a lot of
he says I don't agree with and he's not

8044
03:49:35,091 --> 03:49:35,750
my identity.

8045
03:49:35,750 --> 03:49:36,471
Shanti Hooks,

8046
03:49:36,471 --> 03:49:37,130
not mine.

8047
03:49:37,130 --> 03:49:40,880
This is just from talking from your own
personal perspective and I appreciate

8048
03:49:40,881 --> 03:49:41,390
that,

8049
03:49:41,390 --> 03:49:42,170
that he's not your dad.

8050
03:49:42,170 --> 03:49:45,200
I don't know how many people actually
think that he's your identity,

8051
03:49:45,560 --> 03:49:48,410
but I think that what we're getting at
that's important is that we don't know

8052
03:49:48,411 --> 03:49:49,790
when they're shooting at me,

8053
03:49:49,940 --> 03:49:50,810
they're going to Trump.

8054
03:49:51,590 --> 03:49:52,400
I'm sure.

8055
03:49:52,400 --> 03:49:53,300
I'm sure there's a lot of,

8056
03:49:53,310 --> 03:49:54,440
don't mind the shooting yet,

8057
03:49:54,441 --> 03:49:54,950
Joe.

8058
03:49:54,950 --> 03:49:57,020
It's that I'm not Donald Trump.

8059
03:49:57,230 --> 03:49:58,430
I understand that from you,

8060
03:49:58,431 --> 03:50:01,520
but what I'm talking about is
just the human race in general.

8061
03:50:01,850 --> 03:50:03,950
If we could just do one thing,

8062
03:50:04,520 --> 03:50:06,050
be reasonable,

8063
03:50:06,230 --> 03:50:11,060
just be reasonable and understand that
emotions cloud judgment and that when

8064
03:50:11,061 --> 03:50:14,510
people start screaming and yelling at
each other and you take one side and

8065
03:50:14,511 --> 03:50:17,030
you're the left and this guy takes
another side and he's the right and you're

8066
03:50:17,031 --> 03:50:17,811
going back and forth,

8067
03:50:17,811 --> 03:50:18,071
he just,

8068
03:50:18,071 --> 03:50:19,070
he phones to mindless,

8069
03:50:19,130 --> 03:50:22,730
it's nonsense and you don't ever get
anything solved and you never get to

8070
03:50:22,731 --> 03:50:26,060
understand how that other person thinks
and feels and we're constantly trying to

8071
03:50:26,061 --> 03:50:26,894
mock people.

8072
03:50:26,930 --> 03:50:29,780
And what you were talking about about
the bill Maher thing about him cracking a

8073
03:50:29,781 --> 03:50:32,930
joke and I dismissed it as a joke because
it was a joke was talking about how

8074
03:50:32,931 --> 03:50:35,060
the red states wish they were the
blue states and all that shit.

8075
03:50:35,660 --> 03:50:38,240
That's that's exactly the type of
thing we're talking about though.

8076
03:50:38,450 --> 03:50:38,661
That,

8077
03:50:38,661 --> 03:50:38,961
that,

8078
03:50:38,961 --> 03:50:39,411
that,

8079
03:50:39,411 --> 03:50:44,411
that US versus them that me versus like
you're generalizing for entire swaths of

8080
03:50:44,571 --> 03:50:45,680
the country as if they're one.

8081
03:50:45,681 --> 03:50:45,891
Yeah.

8082
03:50:45,891 --> 03:50:48,440
I feel bad every time I
say California has lost.

8083
03:50:48,950 --> 03:50:50,780
This is a beautiful state
and a lot of great people,

8084
03:50:51,190 --> 03:50:53,210
but this is a lot of people here.

8085
03:50:53,360 --> 03:50:55,100
A lot of them were fucking lost.

8086
03:50:55,250 --> 03:50:56,150
That's a fact.

8087
03:50:56,480 --> 03:50:58,270
You know this like who
knows how many minutes?

8088
03:50:58,271 --> 03:50:59,930
It's like 30 something million.

8089
03:51:00,080 --> 03:51:00,890
38 million.

8090
03:51:00,890 --> 03:51:02,030
It's crazy.

8091
03:51:02,031 --> 03:51:03,230
That's a giant country.

8092
03:51:03,231 --> 03:51:05,150
And it was the population of California.

8093
03:51:05,180 --> 03:51:06,650
It's fucking giant.

8094
03:51:07,220 --> 03:51:08,480
That's too many people to,

8095
03:51:08,730 --> 03:51:10,910
there's no way you could
say Californians do this,

8096
03:51:10,911 --> 03:51:12,780
this fucking California that are ranchers.

8097
03:51:12,790 --> 03:51:13,461
40 million.

8098
03:51:13,461 --> 03:51:15,020
Can we fit the whole population?

8099
03:51:16,580 --> 03:51:17,413
So when you look at,

8100
03:51:17,740 --> 03:51:18,130
isn't that,

8101
03:51:18,130 --> 03:51:18,963
isn't that true?

8102
03:51:19,700 --> 03:51:22,760
We are overpopulated in some
ways though with our technology,

8103
03:51:22,761 --> 03:51:23,700
but let me just make this point.

8104
03:51:23,701 --> 03:51:24,534
Then we got to end this.

8105
03:51:24,560 --> 03:51:25,650
I gotta pee so bad.

8106
03:51:25,680 --> 03:51:25,920
What?

8107
03:51:25,920 --> 03:51:26,753
Go

8108
03:51:26,820 --> 03:51:27,121
Go pee,

8109
03:51:27,121 --> 03:51:28,060
pee and come back on first.

8110
03:51:28,080 --> 03:51:28,980
Five more minutes because I want to,

8111
03:51:28,981 --> 03:51:30,570
I want to get into the topic.

8112
03:51:31,250 --> 03:51:35,260
Let's talk some sense and know how to
pitch to tell him about Bazalgette.

8113
03:51:35,320 --> 03:51:37,270
Tell me about boy buzz Aldrin.

8114
03:51:38,080 --> 03:51:38,351
You know,

8115
03:51:38,351 --> 03:51:39,370
I'll tell you about buzz Aldrin.

8116
03:51:39,430 --> 03:51:40,263
He told me.

8117
03:51:42,250 --> 03:51:43,083
I know.

8118
03:51:44,070 --> 03:51:44,551
Okay,

8119
03:51:44,551 --> 03:51:45,520
it's going to be Brown,

8120
03:51:47,020 --> 03:51:49,270
Cleveland browns.com I'm going to lie.

8121
03:51:50,970 --> 03:51:53,320
I can't both leaf Jamie.

8122
03:51:53,530 --> 03:51:53,801
Eddie,

8123
03:51:53,801 --> 03:51:54,430
how you doing?

8124
03:51:54,430 --> 03:51:55,150
I'm doing good.

8125
03:51:55,150 --> 03:51:55,983
So,

8126
03:51:56,320 --> 03:51:57,153
um,

8127
03:51:57,750 --> 03:51:58,180
what do you,

8128
03:51:58,180 --> 03:52:00,010
what do you think about the wide receiver

8129
03:52:01,540 --> 03:52:02,380
of the browns?

8130
03:52:02,890 --> 03:52:04,930
I don't think we can turn the
talk to brown sand right now.

8131
03:52:04,931 --> 03:52:05,410
No,

8132
03:52:05,410 --> 03:52:07,810
unfortunately is okay.

8133
03:52:08,080 --> 03:52:13,080
Is there any conspiracy theory
that you kind of are suspicious of?

8134
03:52:13,750 --> 03:52:14,650
There's gotta be at least one,

8135
03:52:15,370 --> 03:52:16,280
like which one?

8136
03:52:17,260 --> 03:52:18,190
Like nine 11,

8137
03:52:18,400 --> 03:52:18,840
nine 11.

8138
03:52:18,840 --> 03:52:19,620
You think?

8139
03:52:19,620 --> 03:52:20,020
You know,

8140
03:52:20,020 --> 03:52:21,250
are you familiar with tower seven?

8141
03:52:21,470 --> 03:52:21,711
Yeah,

8142
03:52:21,711 --> 03:52:22,760
I would say from a,

8143
03:52:22,850 --> 03:52:24,980
almost every story.

8144
03:52:24,981 --> 03:52:27,290
Even the stuff we've talked
about before in the past,

8145
03:52:27,350 --> 03:52:27,830
I,

8146
03:52:27,830 --> 03:52:30,110
I don't believe the official

8147
03:52:30,270 --> 03:52:31,103
and quotes.

8148
03:52:31,830 --> 03:52:32,130
So,

8149
03:52:32,130 --> 03:52:32,611
you know,

8150
03:52:32,611 --> 03:52:35,310
the tower seven was the
third tower that went down.

8151
03:52:35,311 --> 03:52:35,971
You're aware of that,

8152
03:52:35,971 --> 03:52:36,360
right?

8153
03:52:36,360 --> 03:52:36,620
Yeah.

8154
03:52:36,620 --> 03:52:36,990
I'm,

8155
03:52:36,990 --> 03:52:37,900
I look more when he,

8156
03:52:37,901 --> 03:52:38,790
when that comes up,

8157
03:52:39,450 --> 03:52:41,880
all of the surrounding information about,

8158
03:52:41,910 --> 03:52:42,660
uh,

8159
03:52:42,660 --> 03:52:42,961
what it,

8160
03:52:42,961 --> 03:52:44,460
what was it in the buildings,

8161
03:52:44,740 --> 03:52:45,070
not,

8162
03:52:45,070 --> 03:52:46,200
not the actual event.

8163
03:52:46,260 --> 03:52:47,130
I know the event happened.

8164
03:52:47,131 --> 03:52:47,964
I'm not,

8165
03:52:48,210 --> 03:52:48,610
I'm not sure.

8166
03:52:48,610 --> 03:52:49,450
I'm curious about that.

8167
03:52:49,480 --> 03:52:51,420
Did you see the video of tower seven disco

8168
03:52:53,450 --> 03:52:54,283
ball speed?

8169
03:52:54,340 --> 03:52:55,900
That's gotta be a little suspicious,

8170
03:52:56,800 --> 03:52:57,420
right?

8171
03:52:57,420 --> 03:52:59,170
Red Flag got to come up at least,

8172
03:52:59,190 --> 03:52:59,800
right.

8173
03:52:59,800 --> 03:53:00,311
If you're trying to,

8174
03:53:00,311 --> 03:53:01,630
if you're really trying
to get to the truth,

8175
03:53:01,631 --> 03:53:02,080
you're like,

8176
03:53:02,080 --> 03:53:02,831
wait a minute.

8177
03:53:02,831 --> 03:53:05,410
I would say there's more of a
suspicious that a third building fell.

8178
03:53:05,411 --> 03:53:06,244
It wasn't,

8179
03:53:06,430 --> 03:53:08,050
it wasn't going to hit exactly.

8180
03:53:08,170 --> 03:53:11,410
That's what the whole story is with tower
seven and not only was it not touched

8181
03:53:11,411 --> 03:53:12,850
by a plane,

8182
03:53:13,210 --> 03:53:17,110
it went down at free fall speed and
it's caught on video like five different

8183
03:53:17,111 --> 03:53:17,920
angles,

8184
03:53:17,920 --> 03:53:18,460
right?

8185
03:53:18,460 --> 03:53:19,330
There's five different names.

8186
03:53:20,320 --> 03:53:22,270
No one's saying that it's fake footage.

8187
03:53:22,600 --> 03:53:24,820
That's tower seven to 47 storey,

8188
03:53:24,970 --> 03:53:27,730
skyscraper fucking fallen
at free fall speed.

8189
03:53:27,790 --> 03:53:31,060
Some people are saying and got
hit with a direct energy weapon.

8190
03:53:31,270 --> 03:53:33,220
Some people are saying that it was uh,

8191
03:53:33,250 --> 03:53:34,810
brought down like a,

8192
03:53:35,500 --> 03:53:37,810
a controlled demo like in Vegas,

8193
03:53:37,811 --> 03:53:38,830
like one of those buildings,

8194
03:53:39,220 --> 03:53:39,491
you know.

8195
03:53:39,491 --> 03:53:42,400
But regardless of how it was brought down,

8196
03:53:42,401 --> 03:53:44,620
you got to look at that
video footage to go,

8197
03:53:44,621 --> 03:53:45,610
wait a minute.

8198
03:53:45,850 --> 03:53:48,190
And why is youtube telling you
now I'm building seven footage.

8199
03:53:48,240 --> 03:53:48,630
Yeah,

8200
03:53:48,630 --> 03:53:49,140
I mean here,

8201
03:53:49,140 --> 03:53:53,110
here's one footage was
on syndicated radio.

8202
03:53:53,111 --> 03:53:58,111
I'm like 50 stations in
2001 and I'm sitting there,

8203
03:53:59,650 --> 03:54:01,780
that's actually 120 stations.

8204
03:54:02,800 --> 03:54:05,710
So I lost like 70% of them were
saying that it was an inside job.

8205
03:54:05,860 --> 03:54:07,180
I don't mean the firemen blow it up.

8206
03:54:07,480 --> 03:54:10,210
I'm watching Fox News,

8207
03:54:10,450 --> 03:54:12,190
CNN at my studio,

8208
03:54:12,790 --> 03:54:17,790
and then I go get a pizza at four o'clock
with CBS radio back then and they go

8209
03:54:17,891 --> 03:54:21,040
Solomon brothers building seven there's
going to be brought down in a controlled

8210
03:54:21,041 --> 03:54:22,300
demolition of the of the buildings.

8211
03:54:23,080 --> 03:54:24,040
So I go back

8212
03:54:24,040 --> 03:54:27,940
on here and announce building seven
being brought down to see what their

8213
03:54:27,941 --> 03:54:29,440
buildings and for five,

8214
03:54:29,441 --> 03:54:30,640
five years everyone goes,

8215
03:54:30,641 --> 03:54:31,474
I'm crazy.

8216
03:54:31,510 --> 03:54:36,510
Then CNN and all of them archive it on
the Internet and everyone's watching

8217
03:54:36,971 --> 03:54:37,804
building seven

8218
03:54:40,060 --> 03:54:41,080
BBC,

8219
03:54:41,440 --> 03:54:42,310
ABC.

8220
03:54:42,311 --> 03:54:43,370
Let me ask CNN,

8221
03:54:43,420 --> 03:54:48,420
do you think happened with tower seven
she and in ABC and CBS has told me the

8222
03:54:48,641 --> 03:54:49,480
government blow it up.

8223
03:54:49,690 --> 03:54:51,400
The government play the clips.

8224
03:54:51,760 --> 03:54:52,270
They go,

8225
03:54:52,270 --> 03:54:53,380
because I want to get back.

8226
03:54:53,381 --> 03:54:54,790
We're blowing it up and the media,

8227
03:54:54,791 --> 03:54:55,120
he goes,

8228
03:54:55,120 --> 03:54:55,511
oh,

8229
03:54:55,511 --> 03:54:56,890
you mean the cops blow it up?

8230
03:54:56,891 --> 03:54:57,310
No,

8231
03:54:57,310 --> 03:54:58,300
the cops are told,

8232
03:54:58,570 --> 03:54:59,980
get back on the countdown.

8233
03:55:00,180 --> 03:55:04,000
I interviewed with Toms like Gen nine
five four three they explain it to me.

8234
03:55:04,001 --> 03:55:08,080
Do you think that they had detonation set
up already in the buildings and that's

8235
03:55:08,081 --> 03:55:08,801
where it goes next.

8236
03:55:08,801 --> 03:55:09,520
Joe,

8237
03:55:09,520 --> 03:55:11,410
which I used to always
like try to follow it down.

8238
03:55:11,410 --> 03:55:11,891
What it means.

8239
03:55:11,891 --> 03:55:12,724
I don't know.

8240
03:55:12,880 --> 03:55:13,750
I've learned to go,

8241
03:55:13,870 --> 03:55:14,261
Hey,

8242
03:55:14,261 --> 03:55:17,260
I've got five different
newscast when it happened.

8243
03:55:17,261 --> 03:55:19,090
And before it's saying they blew it up.

8244
03:55:19,120 --> 03:55:20,500
I don't know what happened.

8245
03:55:20,620 --> 03:55:25,620
Is it possible that it collapsed
because of those gigantic diesel fires?

8246
03:55:25,900 --> 03:55:26,290
Right.

8247
03:55:26,290 --> 03:55:29,770
And then the way our one to two
sevens is on building seven,

8248
03:55:29,890 --> 03:55:31,700
seven had a deer diesel,

8249
03:55:31,701 --> 03:55:36,250
bigger tanks in the basement caught
fire and they said it was an inferno and

8250
03:55:36,251 --> 03:55:38,060
they said it cooked through the nose.

8251
03:55:38,440 --> 03:55:39,071
Hold on a second.

8252
03:55:39,071 --> 03:55:39,630
He's always,

8253
03:55:39,630 --> 03:55:41,860
but I want to ask you
this cause I don't know.

8254
03:55:42,220 --> 03:55:42,581
Oh yeah.

8255
03:55:42,581 --> 03:55:42,970
Right.

8256
03:55:42,970 --> 03:55:43,560
But it,

8257
03:55:43,560 --> 03:55:45,790
they said that what happened was,

8258
03:55:45,850 --> 03:55:48,640
this is whoever the fuck explained it,

8259
03:55:48,670 --> 03:55:53,670
that was making these youtube videos
that the fire had burned through the

8260
03:55:54,281 --> 03:55:55,690
internal structure of the building.

8261
03:55:55,691 --> 03:55:59,620
It's such a high temperature
that all of these floors,

8262
03:55:59,630 --> 03:56:02,140
how lax they pancaked and then it came.

8263
03:56:02,140 --> 03:56:03,340
But it never happened before,

8264
03:56:03,341 --> 03:56:03,990
since right.

8265
03:56:03,990 --> 03:56:05,170
Never hasn't happened before.

8266
03:56:05,171 --> 03:56:06,004
Since that's a fact.

8267
03:56:06,760 --> 03:56:07,091
Here's,

8268
03:56:07,091 --> 03:56:07,950
here's the thing about this.

8269
03:56:08,100 --> 03:56:11,230
Shawn's 18 years ago would
argue every point and say,

8270
03:56:11,231 --> 03:56:12,064
I knew what happened.

8271
03:56:12,190 --> 03:56:12,760
Okay.

8272
03:56:12,760 --> 03:56:14,530
The Alex Jones in 2019 is honest.

8273
03:56:14,590 --> 03:56:14,741
Well,

8274
03:56:14,741 --> 03:56:15,574
I'm glad you're,

8275
03:56:15,610 --> 03:56:19,270
I'm going to say I've seen him say they
blew it up and nobody gonna describe

8276
03:56:19,271 --> 03:56:19,660
him.

8277
03:56:19,660 --> 03:56:20,381
I don't know Joe,

8278
03:56:20,381 --> 03:56:21,070
what happened,

8279
03:56:21,070 --> 03:56:21,580
right.

8280
03:56:21,580 --> 03:56:21,740
Well,

8281
03:56:21,740 --> 03:56:22,690
when you look at it,

8282
03:56:23,350 --> 03:56:24,220
the way it falls,

8283
03:56:24,221 --> 03:56:25,810
it falls exactly what I can control.

8284
03:56:25,811 --> 03:56:26,590
Demolition.

8285
03:56:26,590 --> 03:56:27,250
Exactly.

8286
03:56:27,250 --> 03:56:29,350
So it falls from the top down.

8287
03:56:29,590 --> 03:56:31,450
But if you actually watch false peak,

8288
03:56:31,451 --> 03:56:31,661
right?

8289
03:56:31,661 --> 03:56:33,160
But if you watch the full video,

8290
03:56:33,460 --> 03:56:35,320
the center of it collapses.

8291
03:56:35,470 --> 03:56:38,080
Like there's a full video where you're
looking at the top of the building and

8292
03:56:38,081 --> 03:56:40,660
the center of it collapses
far before the outside does.

8293
03:56:40,720 --> 03:56:41,411
That's how they take,

8294
03:56:41,411 --> 03:56:44,110
they take out the elevator should
take some central thing first.

8295
03:56:44,110 --> 03:56:46,070
So do light up the music.

8296
03:56:46,420 --> 03:56:47,770
Do they do this with,

8297
03:56:47,800 --> 03:56:50,560
did they have it all set in advance?

8298
03:56:50,740 --> 03:56:52,940
So they knew that nine 11
was going to come in today.

8299
03:56:52,950 --> 03:56:53,790
She answered my question,

8300
03:56:53,970 --> 03:56:54,791
please don't know.

8301
03:56:54,791 --> 03:56:55,360
Right.

8302
03:56:55,360 --> 03:56:58,900
And what they do is they take like some
clip of me from 20 years ago or 18 years

8303
03:56:58,901 --> 03:56:59,734
ago going,

8304
03:56:59,800 --> 03:57:01,990
here's CBS News and they don't show it.

8305
03:57:02,590 --> 03:57:03,520
I mean I've got Slippy,

8306
03:57:03,521 --> 03:57:03,821
yes,

8307
03:57:03,821 --> 03:57:08,680
I've got easy possible that even though
operation Northwoods happened and Gulf

8308
03:57:08,680 --> 03:57:09,520
of Tonkin was a conspiracy,

8309
03:57:09,550 --> 03:57:14,550
is it possible that the internal fires
in that building were so unbelievably hot

8310
03:57:15,790 --> 03:57:19,750
that it fucked up every floor and they
really did pancake on top of each other

8311
03:57:19,870 --> 03:57:22,130
and then the exterior
structure just collapsed?

8312
03:57:22,400 --> 03:57:23,300
Is that possible?

8313
03:57:23,301 --> 03:57:24,490
Because I'm not an engineer though.

8314
03:57:25,250 --> 03:57:26,690
The engineers say it's not.

8315
03:57:26,750 --> 03:57:28,190
It's not possible at all and it,

8316
03:57:28,191 --> 03:57:29,170
here's the problem with Joe.

8317
03:57:29,870 --> 03:57:34,870
They announce it fell on its own
footprint 27 minutes before it did on five

8318
03:57:35,961 --> 03:57:37,280
channels to him.

8319
03:57:37,680 --> 03:57:39,050
Baby world.

8320
03:57:39,890 --> 03:57:40,760
That's true baby.

8321
03:57:40,761 --> 03:57:42,890
She Shanahan,

8322
03:57:43,280 --> 03:57:45,110
CNN and CBS.

8323
03:57:45,560 --> 03:57:46,130
Joe,

8324
03:57:46,130 --> 03:57:46,620
I'm a,

8325
03:57:46,620 --> 03:57:47,453
I keep food.

8326
03:57:47,720 --> 03:57:48,350
I do too.

8327
03:57:48,350 --> 03:57:49,310
It was four o'clock.

8328
03:57:49,430 --> 03:57:52,280
I've been on air since that
morning on syndicated radio.

8329
03:57:52,940 --> 03:57:56,000
I drove down to the local pizza place
at four o'clock got my page that was

8330
03:57:56,001 --> 03:58:01,001
eating in the car and our
CBS radio driving home and
they shed a little sooner.

8331
03:58:01,971 --> 03:58:05,550
A little bit mood or say whether our
buildings too controlled demolition.

8332
03:58:05,580 --> 03:58:06,640
The Solomon Brothers bouldering.

8333
03:58:06,650 --> 03:58:07,483
Bouldering seven.

8334
03:58:07,580 --> 03:58:08,040
By the way,

8335
03:58:08,040 --> 03:58:09,140
we have these clubs now,

8336
03:58:10,800 --> 03:58:12,260
but no one archive stuff then.

8337
03:58:12,261 --> 03:58:13,250
So I go on there and I go,

8338
03:58:13,251 --> 03:58:13,521
yeah,

8339
03:58:13,521 --> 03:58:14,660
they just blow up a building.

8340
03:58:14,990 --> 03:58:16,370
Everybody started freaking out.

8341
03:58:16,550 --> 03:58:17,241
But here's the thing.

8342
03:58:17,241 --> 03:58:18,290
And then they blew it up.

8343
03:58:18,560 --> 03:58:21,610
How long does it take to set up explosives
to the point where you could paint?

8344
03:58:21,611 --> 03:58:22,850
It normally takes a week.

8345
03:58:23,330 --> 03:58:23,631
A week.

8346
03:58:23,631 --> 03:58:24,890
That was the next story.

8347
03:58:26,410 --> 03:58:27,580
But then I interviewed,

8348
03:58:28,370 --> 03:58:28,930
yeah,

8349
03:58:28,930 --> 03:58:30,700
the head of emergency
management for new work.

8350
03:58:33,260 --> 03:58:34,093
Yeah.

8351
03:58:34,910 --> 03:58:38,390
And the loose change people
got him on and he says,

8352
03:58:38,391 --> 03:58:38,571
no,

8353
03:58:38,571 --> 03:58:39,081
I was there.

8354
03:58:39,081 --> 03:58:39,801
They had bombs.

8355
03:58:39,801 --> 03:58:40,540
The CIA,

8356
03:58:40,540 --> 03:58:41,990
you know what was patient
Bullock seven right?

8357
03:58:44,260 --> 03:58:45,093
Villa,

8358
03:58:45,220 --> 03:58:46,031
the CIA,

8359
03:58:46,031 --> 03:58:46,631
the FBI,

8360
03:58:46,631 --> 03:58:48,760
all of it wasn't an NSA as well.

8361
03:58:48,830 --> 03:58:49,450
Everything.

8362
03:58:49,450 --> 03:58:49,720
See,

8363
03:58:49,720 --> 03:58:50,270
he always says,

8364
03:58:50,270 --> 03:58:51,070
oh no.

8365
03:58:51,070 --> 03:58:51,903
He goes,

8366
03:58:52,350 --> 03:58:53,560
I'm not just kissing his ass.

8367
03:58:54,070 --> 03:58:54,903
He's beyond that.

8368
03:58:55,560 --> 03:58:56,393
He's no,

8369
03:58:56,500 --> 03:58:57,311
it's bullshit,

8370
03:58:57,311 --> 03:58:58,144
man.

8371
03:58:58,630 --> 03:58:59,910
Every fucking thing.

8372
03:59:00,460 --> 03:59:02,080
Just fucking say to yourself.

8373
03:59:02,720 --> 03:59:03,250
No,

8374
03:59:03,250 --> 03:59:04,630
explain it to everybody.

8375
03:59:04,960 --> 03:59:05,120
Oh,

8376
03:59:05,120 --> 03:59:05,953
you're on.

8377
03:59:07,250 --> 03:59:10,150
You do a better job than any fucking
stories are fucking government.

8378
03:59:10,890 --> 03:59:11,140
Right.

8379
03:59:11,140 --> 03:59:15,160
So there's 40 with a diesel tank and
pre rigged explosives in case shit.

8380
03:59:15,190 --> 03:59:15,581
Dude,

8381
03:59:15,581 --> 03:59:15,841
man,

8382
03:59:15,841 --> 03:59:20,841
he didn't believe I married and even
though I heard CBS say they blow it up and

8383
03:59:20,861 --> 03:59:21,694
even though,

8384
03:59:21,830 --> 03:59:22,720
and I can do is we go,

8385
03:59:22,721 --> 03:59:26,020
Joe says firefighters blow it up
because the government's anything point.

8386
03:59:26,021 --> 03:59:26,854
You made a good point.

8387
03:59:26,920 --> 03:59:27,731
Like I'm setting the government.

8388
03:59:27,731 --> 03:59:27,851
No,

8389
03:59:27,851 --> 03:59:30,220
I don't mean my grandpa was in the army.

8390
03:59:30,460 --> 03:59:32,980
If it really did pancake from the,

8391
03:59:33,040 --> 03:59:33,873
from the fire.

8392
03:59:34,060 --> 03:59:35,860
What a shit design.

8393
03:59:36,130 --> 03:59:36,640
Yeah.

8394
03:59:36,640 --> 03:59:37,680
What a terrible design.

8395
03:59:37,690 --> 03:59:38,680
Me So mad at that.

8396
03:59:38,681 --> 03:59:41,140
Architects were the debates
from underwriting laboratories.

8397
03:59:41,460 --> 03:59:41,990
Most everyone.

8398
03:59:41,990 --> 03:59:45,610
I went and looked at the blueprints
into New York and I'm not defending what

8399
03:59:45,611 --> 03:59:47,260
you're saying because seven was built.

8400
03:59:47,261 --> 03:59:47,471
Well,

8401
03:59:47,471 --> 03:59:48,610
it was looked at by lawsuits.

8402
03:59:48,760 --> 03:59:53,760
They were sued tower one and two though
they were built with like bubblegum and

8403
03:59:53,981 --> 03:59:55,150
like bandaids.

8404
03:59:55,660 --> 03:59:56,050
Really?

8405
03:59:56,050 --> 03:59:56,201
Oh,

8406
03:59:56,201 --> 03:59:57,790
all those buildings are already leaning.

8407
03:59:58,000 --> 03:59:58,511
Oh No.

8408
03:59:58,511 --> 03:59:59,860
It was a big mob scam.

8409
04:00:00,230 --> 04:00:00,730
They were,

8410
04:00:00,730 --> 04:00:01,563
no,

8411
04:00:01,690 --> 04:00:02,523
they already had,

8412
04:00:03,070 --> 04:00:04,930
they already had buckling in the wind.

8413
04:00:04,960 --> 04:00:05,860
Oh No.

8414
04:00:05,861 --> 04:00:07,240
Mathematicians gas.

8415
04:00:07,690 --> 04:00:08,950
That was in like five years.

8416
04:00:08,951 --> 04:00:10,060
One building would collapse.

8417
04:00:10,120 --> 04:00:11,320
Oh fuck.

8418
04:00:12,100 --> 04:00:12,821
Oh my God.

8419
04:00:12,821 --> 04:00:13,750
There goes your argument,

8420
04:00:13,780 --> 04:00:14,710
it's New York.

8421
04:00:15,250 --> 04:00:17,940
These buildings are built
for shit and that's when he,

8422
04:00:17,950 --> 04:00:18,491
as you get older,

8423
04:00:18,491 --> 04:00:19,324
you know,

8424
04:00:22,350 --> 04:00:23,660
some of them were built for shit.

8425
04:00:23,661 --> 04:00:24,494
Right.

8426
04:00:24,540 --> 04:00:25,230
For sure.

8427
04:00:25,230 --> 04:00:25,920
Right.

8428
04:00:25,920 --> 04:00:26,340
I don't,

8429
04:00:26,340 --> 04:00:26,910
yeah,

8430
04:00:26,910 --> 04:00:27,440
I mean,

8431
04:00:27,440 --> 04:00:28,980
especially back then when,

8432
04:00:28,981 --> 04:00:30,420
what does inside your
back heel more tobacco.

8433
04:00:31,050 --> 04:00:32,070
I do have more tobacco,

8434
04:00:32,190 --> 04:00:32,880
but I'm just,

8435
04:00:32,880 --> 04:00:34,290
Kevin was a little bit more tobacco.

8436
04:00:34,340 --> 04:00:34,620
Yes,

8437
04:00:34,620 --> 04:00:35,061
for sure.

8438
04:00:35,061 --> 04:00:40,061
100% you know who Dr. Judy Wood is a no,

8439
04:00:40,261 --> 04:00:41,430
I do know she's,

8440
04:00:41,670 --> 04:00:44,630
she's got Dr. Judy Woods
wrote a book called,

8441
04:00:44,940 --> 04:00:46,530
where did the towers go?

8442
04:00:46,610 --> 04:00:46,830
Yeah.

8443
04:00:46,830 --> 04:00:47,850
Part of her story,

8444
04:00:47,910 --> 04:00:49,170
her theory is,

8445
04:00:49,620 --> 04:00:50,453
this is just,

8446
04:00:50,520 --> 04:00:52,410
this is just some lady scientist lady.

8447
04:00:53,030 --> 04:00:56,220
She said based on the fact that there was,

8448
04:00:56,700 --> 04:01:01,700
this is what she claims based on the
video and the pictures that she has of,

8449
04:01:02,940 --> 04:01:03,540
uh,

8450
04:01:03,540 --> 04:01:04,760
where the towers collapsed.

8451
04:01:04,890 --> 04:01:06,600
She or speaking for me,

8452
04:01:06,601 --> 04:01:06,871
I'm sorry,

8453
04:01:06,871 --> 04:01:09,330
she's saying that there was no rubble.

8454
04:01:09,360 --> 04:01:09,720
The book,

8455
04:01:09,720 --> 04:01:10,620
the name of the book is called,

8456
04:01:10,621 --> 04:01:11,970
where did the towers go?

8457
04:01:12,300 --> 04:01:14,700
She said that direct energy weapons,

8458
04:01:14,701 --> 04:01:16,200
some kind of direct energy weapons.

8459
04:01:16,500 --> 04:01:21,500
Dustin by the buildings turn the buildings
to dusk because there was no rubble.

8460
04:01:21,770 --> 04:01:23,110
A dude gave me a book on that,

8461
04:01:23,470 --> 04:01:24,303
that this,

8462
04:01:24,930 --> 04:01:25,700
he's like,

8463
04:01:25,700 --> 04:01:26,533
no,

8464
04:01:26,720 --> 04:01:27,000
no,

8465
04:01:27,000 --> 04:01:27,960
he's in America at this.

8466
04:01:28,020 --> 04:01:28,621
He was in la.

8467
04:01:28,621 --> 04:01:29,260
He told me,

8468
04:01:29,260 --> 04:01:29,590
uh,

8469
04:01:29,590 --> 04:01:31,020
they use Tesla technology.

8470
04:01:31,410 --> 04:01:31,741
I was like,

8471
04:01:31,741 --> 04:01:32,574
what?

8472
04:01:32,620 --> 04:01:35,130
He can say you're wrong
to ask that question.

8473
04:01:35,610 --> 04:01:35,971
You know what?

8474
04:01:35,971 --> 04:01:36,211
For me,

8475
04:01:36,211 --> 04:01:39,660
it doesn't matter if it was justified
or they buttering them up in Las Vegas,

8476
04:01:39,661 --> 04:01:41,070
style matters.

8477
04:01:41,100 --> 04:01:42,300
Here's those buildings,

8478
04:01:42,360 --> 04:01:43,290
in my opinion

8479
04:01:45,090 --> 04:01:49,410
and in the world trade centers I've been
accused of covering up and I don't like

8480
04:01:49,411 --> 04:01:50,244
that.

8481
04:01:51,960 --> 04:01:53,260
You'd be what is,

8482
04:01:53,460 --> 04:01:55,690
he's been accused of
covering things up of,

8483
04:01:55,691 --> 04:01:55,890
uh,

8484
04:01:55,890 --> 04:01:59,080
being a bullshitter like I'm covering.

8485
04:01:59,100 --> 04:01:59,430
I'm like,

8486
04:01:59,430 --> 04:02:00,263
Oh,

8487
04:02:00,430 --> 04:02:00,791
you know,

8488
04:02:00,791 --> 04:02:01,010
man,

8489
04:02:01,010 --> 04:02:01,843
the judge says,

8490
04:02:02,490 --> 04:02:02,971
people think.

8491
04:02:02,971 --> 04:02:05,820
A lot of people think you're
designing this hologram plates.

8492
04:02:05,880 --> 04:02:07,740
A lot of people think
you're a Zionist shill.

8493
04:02:07,800 --> 04:02:08,341
You know that.

8494
04:02:08,341 --> 04:02:09,360
That's the biggest one.

8495
04:02:09,390 --> 04:02:12,060
That's the biggest one about Alex Jones.

8496
04:02:12,120 --> 04:02:12,421
You know,

8497
04:02:12,421 --> 04:02:15,270
I'll be honest with you is the
biggest one people always be,

8498
04:02:15,271 --> 04:02:15,751
and you know what?

8499
04:02:15,751 --> 04:02:17,310
I always have your back always,

8500
04:02:17,370 --> 04:02:17,701
always.

8501
04:02:17,701 --> 04:02:18,240
I said,

8502
04:02:18,240 --> 04:02:18,691
you know what?

8503
04:02:18,691 --> 04:02:19,471
If I didn't know him,

8504
04:02:19,471 --> 04:02:21,500
I would prob probably
think that shows this.

8505
04:02:21,510 --> 04:02:23,190
Just so I know you,

8506
04:02:23,340 --> 04:02:24,930
you are honestly,

8507
04:02:25,190 --> 04:02:25,560
uh,

8508
04:02:25,560 --> 04:02:26,280
uh,

8509
04:02:26,280 --> 04:02:26,580
uh,

8510
04:02:26,580 --> 04:02:31,010
making it a mission in your
life to search for the truth to,

8511
04:02:31,170 --> 04:02:31,590
uh,

8512
04:02:31,590 --> 04:02:33,000
you're all about liberty.

8513
04:02:33,030 --> 04:02:34,080
You're for real.

8514
04:02:34,081 --> 04:02:35,670
You want the best for people.

8515
04:02:35,671 --> 04:02:37,140
You're looking out for the people's best.

8516
04:02:37,900 --> 04:02:39,390
So whether you're right or wrong,

8517
04:02:39,630 --> 04:02:40,580
it doesn't matter your,

8518
04:02:40,730 --> 04:02:41,010
you know,

8519
04:02:41,010 --> 04:02:41,880
sometimes you're wrong.

8520
04:02:41,940 --> 04:02:43,790
But we only want to say old,

8521
04:02:43,980 --> 04:02:47,250
so it's hard for me when I'm like
I'm saying I always have your back.

8522
04:02:47,310 --> 04:02:48,420
It's hard for me to,

8523
04:02:48,720 --> 04:02:50,280
to think you're like some sign to show.

8524
04:02:50,281 --> 04:02:50,490
I'm like,

8525
04:02:50,490 --> 04:02:51,720
I know that this wasn't planned.

8526
04:02:51,721 --> 04:02:54,090
People make up rumors
about all kinds of people.

8527
04:02:54,091 --> 04:02:54,211
They,

8528
04:02:54,211 --> 04:02:54,490
they,

8529
04:02:54,490 --> 04:02:57,090
they'd come up with ideas
that they want to push.

8530
04:02:57,091 --> 04:02:57,990
They decide,

8531
04:02:59,550 --> 04:03:00,270
you know,

8532
04:03:00,270 --> 04:03:02,490
accuse someone of doing
something really stupid,

8533
04:03:02,491 --> 04:03:04,800
like being a part of
something that they're not.

8534
04:03:04,830 --> 04:03:07,140
Here's the [inaudible]
Robert [inaudible] back.

8535
04:03:07,141 --> 04:03:07,531
Alex,

8536
04:03:07,531 --> 04:03:07,810
you know,

8537
04:03:07,810 --> 04:03:09,960
you see a lot of heat for it.

8538
04:03:10,050 --> 04:03:11,030
We just think I'm a shell.

8539
04:03:11,031 --> 04:03:11,970
They think I'm a Zionist.

8540
04:03:13,930 --> 04:03:14,421
But when you,

8541
04:03:14,421 --> 04:03:16,800
when you say conspiracies,

8542
04:03:16,830 --> 04:03:18,070
when you see conspiracies

8543
04:03:18,070 --> 04:03:19,900
against you that you know aren't true,

8544
04:03:20,200 --> 04:03:22,270
does that make you distrust conspiracies?

8545
04:03:22,480 --> 04:03:22,630
Well,

8546
04:03:22,630 --> 04:03:24,370
I told you that's the part of it.

8547
04:03:24,371 --> 04:03:28,510
That's the evolution of you between you
now and you under the laws of his lies.

8548
04:03:28,900 --> 04:03:31,260
But to people that just
say everything's bs,

8549
04:03:31,270 --> 04:03:32,103
you got to check it.

8550
04:03:32,230 --> 04:03:33,400
There's a lot of that going on.

8551
04:03:33,401 --> 04:03:33,970
Right,

8552
04:03:33,970 --> 04:03:34,451
exactly.

8553
04:03:34,451 --> 04:03:36,700
So let me try to answer it
and he's question because
your question is excellent

8554
04:03:36,701 --> 04:03:37,240
as well.

8555
04:03:37,240 --> 04:03:38,080
And the two go together.

8556
04:03:40,200 --> 04:03:41,033
I,

8557
04:03:41,230 --> 04:03:42,063
Eh,

8558
04:03:42,200 --> 04:03:42,411
I mean,

8559
04:03:42,411 --> 04:03:43,191
I grew up in Dallas,

8560
04:03:43,191 --> 04:03:47,270
Texas in the eighties and nineties when
it was like the murder capital of the

8561
04:03:47,271 --> 04:03:48,020
country.

8562
04:03:48,020 --> 04:03:49,520
I lived in a middle class area,

8563
04:03:49,521 --> 04:03:50,354
but it was still like,

8564
04:03:50,930 --> 04:03:51,381
and you know,

8565
04:03:51,381 --> 04:03:51,931
I got in a fight.

8566
04:03:51,931 --> 04:03:52,611
We're rednecks.

8567
04:03:52,611 --> 04:03:52,941
I,

8568
04:03:52,941 --> 04:03:53,181
you know,

8569
04:03:53,181 --> 04:03:53,981
I got in a fight with,

8570
04:03:53,981 --> 04:03:55,160
with racist Mexicans,

8571
04:03:55,520 --> 04:03:57,530
there were racist white
people attacking Mexicans.

8572
04:03:57,980 --> 04:03:58,391
But I,

8573
04:03:58,391 --> 04:03:58,821
I mean,

8574
04:03:58,821 --> 04:04:00,600
I had a big black guys attacking me.

8575
04:04:00,601 --> 04:04:01,131
They were like Flint,

8576
04:04:01,131 --> 04:04:02,210
three grades in school.

8577
04:04:02,480 --> 04:04:03,440
And my black friends will say,

8578
04:04:03,441 --> 04:04:03,621
man,

8579
04:04:03,621 --> 04:04:04,131
you're so cool.

8580
04:04:04,131 --> 04:04:04,591
You're not raising.

8581
04:04:04,591 --> 04:04:05,424
And even though,

8582
04:04:05,540 --> 04:04:09,800
you know my cousin who's 18 or if you're
like 14 he's attacked you and you know,

8583
04:04:09,801 --> 04:04:11,780
that was all just part of a development.

8584
04:04:11,781 --> 04:04:13,230
People do tags.

8585
04:04:13,310 --> 04:04:17,090
It doesn't care what color their
skin on is or where they came from.

8586
04:04:17,091 --> 04:04:18,020
There's good black people,

8587
04:04:18,021 --> 04:04:19,040
there's bad black people,

8588
04:04:19,210 --> 04:04:20,180
there's good white people,

8589
04:04:20,181 --> 04:04:21,590
there's bad white people,

8590
04:04:21,770 --> 04:04:22,610
there's good Mexicans,

8591
04:04:22,611 --> 04:04:23,341
there's bad Mexicans,

8592
04:04:23,341 --> 04:04:24,051
there's good Asians,

8593
04:04:24,051 --> 04:04:24,884
there's bad Asians,

8594
04:04:24,950 --> 04:04:25,940
there's good North Koreans.

8595
04:04:25,940 --> 04:04:26,773
There's bad with Greens.

8596
04:04:27,050 --> 04:04:29,330
And I'm standing really simple
stuff for everybody knows.

8597
04:04:29,810 --> 04:04:32,390
But I'll go to a restaurant
if they've got good food.

8598
04:04:32,780 --> 04:04:35,750
I don't care if it's Ethiopian or
if it's Mexican or if it's chairman.

8599
04:04:35,990 --> 04:04:36,850
If the food's good,

8600
04:04:36,860 --> 04:04:37,581
the people are nice.

8601
04:04:37,581 --> 04:04:38,414
I love it.

8602
04:04:38,540 --> 04:04:39,201
Like a women,

8603
04:04:39,201 --> 04:04:40,760
like I love black women or white women.

8604
04:04:40,761 --> 04:04:41,660
Love Hispanic woman.

8605
04:04:42,200 --> 04:04:42,920
I Love Mall.

8606
04:04:42,920 --> 04:04:43,970
Like if the woman's cool,

8607
04:04:43,980 --> 04:04:45,560
I don't know a bunch of
black women that are bitches,

8608
04:04:45,590 --> 04:04:46,670
black woman that are cool.

8609
04:04:46,790 --> 04:04:48,120
What about Swedish bitches?

8610
04:04:48,160 --> 04:04:48,800
All I'm all,

8611
04:04:48,800 --> 04:04:49,870
the point is let's just say I'm,

8612
04:04:49,960 --> 04:04:50,870
I'm Super Gay,

8613
04:04:51,170 --> 04:04:54,350
but the point is what I'm
getting at here though?

8614
04:04:54,351 --> 04:04:54,530
No,

8615
04:04:54,530 --> 04:04:55,440
I don't like Swedish.

8616
04:04:56,930 --> 04:04:57,710
No,

8617
04:04:57,710 --> 04:04:57,940
no,

8618
04:04:57,940 --> 04:04:58,490
no.

8619
04:04:58,490 --> 04:04:59,330
Let's wrap this up.

8620
04:04:59,360 --> 04:04:59,571
No,

8621
04:04:59,571 --> 04:05:00,361
we need to wrap it up,

8622
04:05:00,361 --> 04:05:01,280
but I'm going to make this point.

8623
04:05:01,550 --> 04:05:02,383
I don't know what it is.

8624
04:05:02,390 --> 04:05:03,440
How is that getting into that?

8625
04:05:03,560 --> 04:05:04,070
Oh,

8626
04:05:04,070 --> 04:05:05,120
the racism thing.

8627
04:05:05,240 --> 04:05:06,073
Oh,

8628
04:05:06,290 --> 04:05:07,490
it's not about,

8629
04:05:07,750 --> 04:05:09,230
and I want to say something so similar,

8630
04:05:09,231 --> 04:05:09,681
but it's like,

8631
04:05:09,681 --> 04:05:10,130
yeah,

8632
04:05:10,130 --> 04:05:11,270
you just told me grass is green.

8633
04:05:11,780 --> 04:05:12,501
Martin Luther King.

8634
04:05:12,501 --> 04:05:15,470
Like it doesn't matter
what color someone is.

8635
04:05:15,770 --> 04:05:17,180
It matters what they stand for,

8636
04:05:17,181 --> 04:05:17,960
what they do.

8637
04:05:17,960 --> 04:05:22,960
I go to restaurants that can be owned
by Koreans or black people or white

8638
04:05:23,181 --> 04:05:23,451
people,

8639
04:05:23,451 --> 04:05:24,080
whatever.

8640
04:05:24,080 --> 04:05:25,790
If the food's good music.

8641
04:05:25,791 --> 04:05:26,521
I love Jimmy Henry.

8642
04:05:26,521 --> 04:05:26,991
He's a black man.

8643
04:05:26,991 --> 04:05:27,980
If the food sucks,

8644
04:05:28,300 --> 04:05:29,133
did I hate it?

8645
04:05:29,270 --> 04:05:31,850
But it's not because they're
white or because they're Hispanic.

8646
04:05:31,910 --> 04:05:32,743
Of course,

8647
04:05:32,870 --> 04:05:33,703
Joe,

8648
04:05:34,190 --> 04:05:35,780
next to a Mexican for three hours.

8649
04:05:36,580 --> 04:05:36,870
Okay,

8650
04:05:36,870 --> 04:05:39,320
100% believe you totally love Mexicans.

8651
04:05:39,990 --> 04:05:40,823
I do too.

8652
04:05:42,480 --> 04:05:43,313
Mexican food.

8653
04:05:44,370 --> 04:05:45,030
Yeah.

8654
04:05:45,030 --> 04:05:45,430
Well,

8655
04:05:45,430 --> 04:05:45,650
we,

8656
04:05:45,650 --> 04:05:47,000
we've had a big epic interview.

8657
04:05:47,001 --> 04:05:48,520
It's been pretty God damn good people.

8658
04:05:48,540 --> 04:05:49,300
The end is you've,

8659
04:05:49,300 --> 04:05:49,670
let's just,

8660
04:05:49,670 --> 04:05:50,451
this is not your record.

8661
04:05:50,451 --> 04:05:51,180
Six hour though.

8662
04:05:51,180 --> 04:05:51,441
Uh,

8663
04:05:51,441 --> 04:05:51,711
no,

8664
04:05:51,711 --> 04:05:52,670
but it's pretty damn good.

8665
04:05:52,700 --> 04:05:54,950
We're at for like four hours or something.

8666
04:05:55,190 --> 04:05:56,023
Something like that.

8667
04:05:56,470 --> 04:05:57,303
All right.

8668
04:05:57,390 --> 04:05:58,040
This,

8669
04:05:58,040 --> 04:06:02,090
I think you guys talked to him about
aliens to fucking really boost your search

8670
04:06:02,091 --> 04:06:02,900
engine results.

8671
04:06:02,900 --> 04:06:03,920
I need to know will be,

8672
04:06:03,921 --> 04:06:06,410
will be eliminated from
all search engine results,

8673
04:06:06,590 --> 04:06:07,620
but I really,

8674
04:06:07,640 --> 04:06:10,580
there's no doubt that you'll be penalized
for this and show you should say

8675
04:06:10,581 --> 04:06:11,241
something about that.

8676
04:06:11,241 --> 04:06:12,350
Like you're an American,

8677
04:06:12,351 --> 04:06:13,184
you're allowed to talk to me.

8678
04:06:13,670 --> 04:06:16,010
Here's are going to say Joe Rogan Jones on

8679
04:06:16,130 --> 04:06:19,670
to say no one died at
sandy hook be as well.

8680
04:06:19,940 --> 04:06:21,680
I don't think anyone's going to say that,

8681
04:06:22,070 --> 04:06:24,470
but people probably will say some things,

8682
04:06:24,740 --> 04:06:25,790
but I think also,

8683
04:06:25,791 --> 04:06:30,791
you know the idea that like anybody
should be able to tell you that you can't

8684
04:06:31,941 --> 04:06:33,620
talk anymore ever.

8685
04:06:33,621 --> 04:06:37,340
If you said one thing that people
don't like or if you do talk,

8686
04:06:37,341 --> 04:06:41,330
it has to be only on your side and you
have to be trapped out of all of the

8687
04:06:41,331 --> 04:06:43,190
different platforms.

8688
04:06:43,191 --> 04:06:44,180
For social media,

8689
04:06:45,000 --> 04:06:46,280
it's a slippery,

8690
04:06:46,281 --> 04:06:47,570
slippery slope,

8691
04:06:47,630 --> 04:06:48,021
you know,

8692
04:06:48,021 --> 04:06:48,920
and other training OT.

8693
04:06:49,370 --> 04:06:49,911
But here's the thing,

8694
04:06:49,911 --> 04:06:50,010
I,

8695
04:06:50,010 --> 04:06:51,320
you're not a hateful person.

8696
04:06:51,350 --> 04:06:52,820
I know you're not a hateful person.

8697
04:06:53,090 --> 04:06:57,740
You may have said things that are angry
in the past about certain people or been

8698
04:06:57,741 --> 04:06:59,420
angry about a certain event in the news,

8699
04:06:59,600 --> 04:07:00,500
but you're not a hurtful,

8700
04:07:00,501 --> 04:07:01,334
angry person.

8701
04:07:01,730 --> 04:07:04,670
If there's things that
you say that they can say,

8702
04:07:04,671 --> 04:07:04,971
hey,

8703
04:07:04,971 --> 04:07:09,350
this violates some sort
of a pattern of behavior.

8704
04:07:09,350 --> 04:07:10,520
You're attacking someone,

8705
04:07:10,521 --> 04:07:11,780
you're giving out someone's address,

8706
04:07:11,870 --> 04:07:12,703
that kind of shit,

8707
04:07:12,800 --> 04:07:15,710
they should be able to take
it down because that's not,

8708
04:07:15,711 --> 04:07:17,320
that's not speech I'm not doing,

8709
04:07:17,360 --> 04:07:18,380
that's what I was going to get to.

8710
04:07:18,410 --> 04:07:22,730
There should be a clear like set of rules
and you could look at these rules the

8711
04:07:22,731 --> 04:07:24,560
way a lawyer would look at him and say,

8712
04:07:24,561 --> 04:07:25,730
is this in violation?

8713
04:07:25,760 --> 04:07:27,440
Is My client arrested?

8714
04:07:27,920 --> 04:07:30,020
Well know your client didn't
have anything illegal on him.

8715
04:07:30,021 --> 04:07:33,590
And we did a search and we found no
drugs and we found no illegal weapons.

8716
04:07:33,591 --> 04:07:33,861
So,

8717
04:07:33,861 --> 04:07:37,700
but we suspected that he was up to
something like the way he was talking,

8718
04:07:37,701 --> 04:07:38,900
just in closing to say this,

8719
04:07:39,260 --> 04:07:40,730
I don't want to make
myself the center of this.

8720
04:07:40,760 --> 04:07:41,840
At the end of the day,

8721
04:07:42,170 --> 04:07:47,170
Info wars went from really successful and
huge to light zeitgeisty and Shane and

8722
04:07:48,231 --> 04:07:50,180
to take any responsibility
for any of that.

8723
04:07:50,180 --> 04:07:51,050
Do you think there's a human,

8724
04:07:51,051 --> 04:07:51,620
I'm not perfect.

8725
04:07:51,620 --> 04:07:51,950
Right?

8726
04:07:51,950 --> 04:07:55,790
Do you think that maybe made it easy for
some of the people that were going to

8727
04:07:55,791 --> 04:07:59,840
attack you and I've been guilty of this
myself by providing fuel saying stupid

8728
04:07:59,841 --> 04:08:00,480
shit.

8729
04:08:00,480 --> 04:08:00,850
Context.

8730
04:08:00,850 --> 04:08:01,280
Yes,

8731
04:08:01,280 --> 04:08:04,400
but that's what I'm saying
is actually they say it,

8732
04:08:05,190 --> 04:08:05,580
it's,

8733
04:08:05,580 --> 04:08:06,261
it's global.

8734
04:08:06,261 --> 04:08:07,550
It's fun at a big corporation.

8735
04:08:07,850 --> 04:08:08,870
This is what I'm a say in closing.

8736
04:08:09,200 --> 04:08:09,950
It's come out,

8737
04:08:09,950 --> 04:08:11,540
we're going to release this shit.

8738
04:08:11,620 --> 04:08:13,160
The thing is it's all left wing.

8739
04:08:13,220 --> 04:08:14,120
That's where it's weird,

8740
04:08:14,121 --> 04:08:15,170
but yeah,

8741
04:08:15,210 --> 04:08:19,880
it's a problem because you
have one ideology that's
overwhelmingly in control of

8742
04:08:19,881 --> 04:08:24,881
tech and I agree with them on a lot of
things on social programs and a lot of it

8743
04:08:25,791 --> 04:08:30,230
on welfare and universal basic income
and and civil rights and women's rights.

8744
04:08:30,470 --> 04:08:31,880
I agree with them on a lot of stuff,

8745
04:08:32,210 --> 04:08:36,020
but it's an ideology like any idea
how you have to just agree with,

8746
04:08:36,021 --> 04:08:36,800
they were wrong,

8747
04:08:36,800 --> 04:08:38,180
but it doesn't have free speech in it.

8748
04:08:38,180 --> 04:08:38,630
There's a lot of,

8749
04:08:38,630 --> 04:08:39,170
there's a lot of y'all.

8750
04:08:39,170 --> 04:08:40,880
I just learned all this two weeks ago,

8751
04:08:41,620 --> 04:08:42,920
but I got documents.

8752
04:08:43,010 --> 04:08:44,180
I'll come back if you want,

8753
04:08:44,270 --> 04:08:45,050
but you just let,

8754
04:08:45,050 --> 04:08:45,380
right?

8755
04:08:45,380 --> 04:08:48,200
I've been attacking the left for doing
it and they're the instrumental group

8756
04:08:48,530 --> 04:08:49,520
that's carrying it out.

8757
04:08:49,521 --> 04:08:50,360
He would take with defense.

8758
04:08:50,390 --> 04:08:52,040
If you're right wing fascist,

8759
04:08:52,280 --> 04:08:53,990
who you get to go after each patient,

8760
04:08:54,910 --> 04:08:58,640
who do you get the left and he trick you,

8761
04:08:58,641 --> 04:09:00,460
trick them and I'm not criticizing.

8762
04:09:00,490 --> 04:09:04,010
The right wing is tricking the left
wing and the shutting down free speech.

8763
04:09:04,011 --> 04:09:04,844
I'll have confirmed,

8764
04:09:04,910 --> 04:09:05,870
oh Jesus Christ.

8765
04:09:05,871 --> 04:09:07,790
I have confirmed it's Goddamn conundrum.

8766
04:09:07,800 --> 04:09:09,500
Let the Republican Party,

8767
04:09:09,530 --> 04:09:10,610
not the average,

8768
04:09:10,611 --> 04:09:11,030
you know,

8769
04:09:11,030 --> 04:09:11,870
tea party people.

8770
04:09:12,680 --> 04:09:14,010
The Republican Party is

8771
04:09:14,010 --> 04:09:14,580
blueblood.

8772
04:09:14,580 --> 04:09:16,080
It thinks it runs the Democrats

8773
04:09:17,640 --> 04:09:22,260
and it learned what was happening and
then come back for a whole shovey one went

8774
04:09:22,261 --> 04:09:22,501
on this.

8775
04:09:22,501 --> 04:09:22,600
Oh,

8776
04:09:22,600 --> 04:09:23,433
come on my show about it.

8777
04:09:24,900 --> 04:09:25,051
No,

8778
04:09:25,051 --> 04:09:25,884
seriously.

8779
04:09:26,070 --> 04:09:26,711
I'll come on your show.

8780
04:09:26,711 --> 04:09:31,500
I'm going to be in and that I'm going to
be at a Cap City Comedy Club in Austin.

8781
04:09:31,501 --> 04:09:32,181
Promise you're coming home.

8782
04:09:32,181 --> 04:09:33,480
I'm coming on are good.

8783
04:09:33,510 --> 04:09:33,601
Oh,

8784
04:09:33,601 --> 04:09:34,330
come on.

8785
04:09:34,330 --> 04:09:34,810
Sit Up.

8786
04:09:34,810 --> 04:09:35,250
Fragile.

8787
04:09:35,250 --> 04:09:36,150
I'm not just saying this.

8788
04:09:36,151 --> 04:09:37,050
I swear to God,

8789
04:09:37,051 --> 04:09:37,201
Dude.

8790
04:09:37,201 --> 04:09:38,520
I'll bring it back to about me.

8791
04:09:38,550 --> 04:09:39,600
I'll tell you the bad stuff about me.

8792
04:09:39,601 --> 04:09:40,500
I'm telling you the truth here.

8793
04:09:40,560 --> 04:09:42,330
I believe you that tobacco was amazing,

8794
04:09:42,331 --> 04:09:43,170
but it was pretty good stuff

8795
04:09:47,680 --> 04:09:48,513
you could do.

8796
04:09:48,840 --> 04:09:49,680
You could transition.

8797
04:09:49,681 --> 04:09:51,300
My problem is to be standing up.

8798
04:09:51,810 --> 04:09:54,710
Sure you could crush show.

8799
04:09:54,780 --> 04:09:55,920
I'm not trying to lie.

8800
04:09:56,600 --> 04:09:58,330
Show you the truth.

8801
04:09:59,400 --> 04:10:02,100
I'm not trying to like
bullshit like everybody else.

8802
04:10:02,700 --> 04:10:03,720
I'm telling you man.

8803
04:10:03,760 --> 04:10:04,650
I,

8804
04:10:05,300 --> 04:10:06,360
the problem is it's so real.

8805
04:10:06,361 --> 04:10:07,680
Like every time I forget
what I was gonna say,

8806
04:10:07,950 --> 04:10:08,783
what was I talking about?

8807
04:10:09,360 --> 04:10:10,350
You being a comic.

8808
04:10:10,650 --> 04:10:11,040
Yeah,

8809
04:10:11,040 --> 04:10:11,281
man.

8810
04:10:11,281 --> 04:10:13,680
I don't know how to
transition out of this.

8811
04:10:13,681 --> 04:10:15,330
What else I've got planned.

8812
04:10:15,440 --> 04:10:16,350
We will hear the plane.

8813
04:10:16,351 --> 04:10:20,310
We were just talking about social media
and Youtube and people would be able to

8814
04:10:20,311 --> 04:10:25,290
able to being able to silence people and
push their leftist ideology or hands,

8815
04:10:25,380 --> 04:10:26,300
right wing ideology.

8816
04:10:26,350 --> 04:10:29,580
He was saying that the Republicans
were manipulating the Democrats,

8817
04:10:29,610 --> 04:10:30,750
cause I know your Shaker it,

8818
04:10:30,990 --> 04:10:32,340
you are empathetic real guy.

8819
04:10:32,430 --> 04:10:33,263
That's why I love you.

8820
04:10:33,540 --> 04:10:35,370
And you were kind of like
couldn't handle it anymore,

8821
04:10:35,371 --> 04:10:36,870
which I actually want to be like that.

8822
04:10:37,110 --> 04:10:38,150
So then you kind of dolled out.

8823
04:10:38,160 --> 04:10:39,420
So I was aggressive
because you look at it,

8824
04:10:40,050 --> 04:10:44,370
I have looked at all this stuff and I
have seen with their own perspectives and

8825
04:10:44,371 --> 04:10:45,510
their own plans are,

8826
04:10:46,020 --> 04:10:48,180
and they go to Congress and
they lie about all of it.

8827
04:10:48,210 --> 04:10:48,961
They're not liberal,

8828
04:10:48,961 --> 04:10:49,794
they're not conservative.

8829
04:10:50,010 --> 04:10:52,350
It's big corporations
lining up with China,

8830
04:10:52,800 --> 04:10:53,611
as you said earlier,

8831
04:10:53,611 --> 04:10:56,220
to unify the propaganda
to quote influence China.

8832
04:10:56,400 --> 04:10:56,911
No Dude,

8833
04:10:56,911 --> 04:10:57,960
they get all the technology.

8834
04:10:58,170 --> 04:10:58,441
We,

8835
04:10:58,441 --> 04:11:01,380
they've used our open
society to totally take over.

8836
04:11:01,710 --> 04:11:05,700
And so that's what I'm trying to get
through to you is that is that they're

8837
04:11:05,701 --> 04:11:06,960
coming after everybody.

8838
04:11:06,961 --> 04:11:07,794
Like you said earlier,

8839
04:11:08,100 --> 04:11:10,170
when we first met you today
that you walk into the office,

8840
04:11:10,171 --> 04:11:11,520
I was here two minutes for you to go.

8841
04:11:11,940 --> 04:11:16,050
I want to talk about the thing you
shed about the censorship and how it,

8842
04:11:16,051 --> 04:11:17,130
once they get us to submit,

8843
04:11:17,131 --> 04:11:17,880
we're broken.

8844
04:11:17,880 --> 04:11:18,091
No,

8845
04:11:18,091 --> 04:11:21,600
it's what you said was it that it was a
slippery slope that if you give it in 1%

8846
04:11:21,720 --> 04:11:25,140
it's 1% I'd still have this other
other 99% and then you start moving the

8847
04:11:25,141 --> 04:11:28,770
boundaries and they start moving in
closer and closer and it 100% makes sense.

8848
04:11:28,950 --> 04:11:31,200
People exist in these,

8849
04:11:31,620 --> 04:11:33,210
these control patterns.

8850
04:11:33,420 --> 04:11:34,410
It's really common.

8851
04:11:34,411 --> 04:11:36,570
They keep asking me like,

8852
04:11:37,020 --> 04:11:37,411
oh,

8853
04:11:37,411 --> 04:11:38,400
when are you going to give up?

8854
04:11:38,401 --> 04:11:39,091
Everything's okay.

8855
04:11:39,091 --> 04:11:42,480
As soon as you do like wondering
everything's gonna be okay.

8856
04:11:42,481 --> 04:11:43,590
What does that mean?

8857
04:11:43,620 --> 04:11:44,040
What does it,

8858
04:11:44,040 --> 04:11:44,880
what does give up mean?

8859
04:11:44,910 --> 04:11:45,810
You stopped talking.

8860
04:11:46,560 --> 04:11:47,900
So people enjoy watching.

8861
04:11:47,910 --> 04:11:48,360
This is what your,

8862
04:11:48,360 --> 04:11:53,160
where it gets weird that people enjoy
watching you talk and other people don't.

8863
04:11:53,190 --> 04:11:55,860
Why can't the people who
don't just not watch you talk?

8864
04:11:57,000 --> 04:11:57,900
What is going on here?

8865
04:11:57,970 --> 04:11:59,250
He's promoting truth.

8866
04:11:59,460 --> 04:12:00,720
He is promoted truth.

8867
04:12:00,990 --> 04:12:05,990
But I think what they've done is they've
found these little pockets of things,

8868
04:12:06,871 --> 04:12:07,704
compliance head.

8869
04:12:08,010 --> 04:12:08,731
Well that too,

8870
04:12:08,731 --> 04:12:12,120
but things you shouldn't
threaten everybody you like.

8871
04:12:12,150 --> 04:12:13,420
I don't want to put
down this route this up.

8872
04:12:13,450 --> 04:12:15,190
I Make Jack Dorsey,

8873
04:12:15,191 --> 04:12:17,680
this villain know that like
we had pool and I was true.

8874
04:12:17,890 --> 04:12:22,090
They had millions of people harassing
the stock and attacking him lying on.

8875
04:12:22,091 --> 04:12:24,070
He's currently attacking children.

8876
04:12:24,250 --> 04:12:28,180
He's trying to attack children at their
houses and so it wasn't the fact that I

8877
04:12:28,181 --> 04:12:31,720
got in a CNN guy's face and I get
as a shareholder in a company owner,

8878
04:12:31,900 --> 04:12:34,450
I'm not defending Jack Dorsey
or whatever his name is.

8879
04:12:34,610 --> 04:12:35,080
Yeah.

8880
04:12:35,080 --> 04:12:35,561
What's the guy?

8881
04:12:35,561 --> 04:12:36,600
The other guy told him to know who?

8882
04:12:36,610 --> 04:12:37,720
The other Guy Jack Dorsey's.

8883
04:12:37,721 --> 04:12:38,291
The Twitter guys?

8884
04:12:38,291 --> 04:12:38,531
Yeah,

8885
04:12:38,531 --> 04:12:39,820
the Gen and Oliver.

8886
04:12:39,840 --> 04:12:40,370
Darcy.

8887
04:12:40,370 --> 04:12:40,930
Yeah,

8888
04:12:40,930 --> 04:12:44,920
and it's all admitted is what I'm
saying is I'm not even that guy's enemy.

8889
04:12:45,400 --> 04:12:46,233
I just,

8890
04:12:46,550 --> 04:12:47,201
I understand.

8891
04:12:47,201 --> 04:12:50,620
Like he had millions of people
attacking the shareholders.

8892
04:12:51,040 --> 04:12:51,940
Did you hear about?

8893
04:12:51,970 --> 04:12:54,250
There's a chef that makes pastries,

8894
04:12:54,520 --> 04:12:59,520
which he's worked there 10
years it Trump's hotel in
Florida and buzzfeed found

8895
04:13:00,251 --> 04:13:03,490
out who she was and doctor and said,

8896
04:13:03,491 --> 04:13:05,260
she's a cult member fire.

8897
04:13:06,880 --> 04:13:07,211
You're like,

8898
04:13:07,211 --> 04:13:08,050
what does that even mean?

8899
04:13:08,290 --> 04:13:11,860
Like why would anybody
harass a pastry chef?

8900
04:13:12,340 --> 04:13:13,480
That's a very good question.

8901
04:13:13,930 --> 04:13:15,370
People feel like they're a war,

8902
04:13:15,460 --> 04:13:15,701
you know?

8903
04:13:15,701 --> 04:13:17,440
That's part of the problem
with all this shit.

8904
04:13:17,441 --> 04:13:19,030
That's why I was saying be reasonable.

8905
04:13:19,480 --> 04:13:20,710
People feel like they're at war,

8906
04:13:20,711 --> 04:13:21,880
the right versus the left.

8907
04:13:21,910 --> 04:13:24,250
Instead of just being a bunch
of people talking about ideas,

8908
04:13:24,550 --> 04:13:25,420
trying to figure it out.

8909
04:13:25,421 --> 04:13:30,250
At least take on Hillary or Alex shows
or or or Bill Clinton or Donald Trump.

8910
04:13:30,520 --> 04:13:30,671
Well,

8911
04:13:30,671 --> 04:13:32,500
shits when is looking in pastry chef.

8912
04:13:32,530 --> 04:13:33,040
Yeah.

8913
04:13:33,040 --> 04:13:33,551
That's crazy.

8914
04:13:33,551 --> 04:13:33,811
By the way.

8915
04:13:33,811 --> 04:13:34,470
You think on both.

8916
04:13:34,470 --> 04:13:35,830
Not going to be a solution at all.

8917
04:13:35,860 --> 04:13:38,050
Type in a buzzfeed targets.

8918
04:13:38,051 --> 04:13:39,040
Trump pastry chef.

8919
04:13:39,400 --> 04:13:40,480
I don't think you're bullshitting at all.

8920
04:13:41,020 --> 04:13:43,390
Let me ask you this because
I've been talking way too much.

8921
04:13:43,900 --> 04:13:46,030
Any closing here at the
end of this transmission?

8922
04:13:46,810 --> 04:13:48,100
We should talk about

8923
04:13:49,660 --> 04:13:51,460
a lot of things along those I have here.

8924
04:13:54,120 --> 04:13:54,970
Let me just tell you,

8925
04:13:54,971 --> 04:13:56,770
this is a fun fucking podcast.

8926
04:13:56,800 --> 04:13:57,460
It was fun.

8927
04:13:57,460 --> 04:13:59,620
I go with this is what
I wanted people to see.

8928
04:13:59,710 --> 04:14:01,030
Well then there's nothing to worry about.

8929
04:14:01,031 --> 04:14:04,290
What I wanted people to see
is why I like counting stones.

8930
04:14:04,300 --> 04:14:05,860
Like why I enjoy hanging out with you.

8931
04:14:05,890 --> 04:14:09,490
I wanted to people to be able to see
it because I have had to defend that

8932
04:14:09,550 --> 04:14:13,840
because of this narrative that Joe
got disagree with Alex and whatever.

8933
04:14:14,140 --> 04:14:16,720
You don't need to let the
left dislike make you bad.

8934
04:14:16,840 --> 04:14:18,200
If I was Charlie Manson,

8935
04:14:18,230 --> 04:14:19,240
I should be able to come on your show.

8936
04:14:19,570 --> 04:14:20,151
I want you to call him.

8937
04:14:20,151 --> 04:14:20,710
I show.

8938
04:14:20,710 --> 04:14:21,543
All right,

8939
04:14:21,580 --> 04:14:23,170
we don't have to do this
Charlie Manson type thing,

8940
04:14:23,250 --> 04:14:24,180
but I would interview that.

8941
04:14:24,190 --> 04:14:25,030
Here's the thing I was saying,

8942
04:14:25,930 --> 04:14:28,780
if the devil in a big blue smoke,

8943
04:14:28,850 --> 04:14:29,980
you would interview him.

8944
04:14:30,430 --> 04:14:32,650
Would you want to stay a certain
distance wife from the devil?

8945
04:14:33,190 --> 04:14:34,960
The devil is very sexually seductive.

8946
04:14:36,960 --> 04:14:38,950
You know the devil
appeared to be standing up.

8947
04:14:39,220 --> 04:14:39,400
Well,

8948
04:14:39,400 --> 04:14:40,980
he just pleased as go to an open mind.

8949
04:14:41,010 --> 04:14:41,843
Seen the devil.

8950
04:14:41,890 --> 04:14:42,221
It's,

8951
04:14:42,221 --> 04:14:42,611
yes,

8952
04:14:42,611 --> 04:14:44,380
I have hotter now.

8953
04:14:45,010 --> 04:14:45,843
You know,

8954
04:14:46,640 --> 04:14:49,380
I have to buy the desk open Mike night.

8955
04:14:49,381 --> 04:14:54,381
A devil is pure sexual so that
you know the [inaudible] Joe,

8956
04:14:54,850 --> 04:14:56,070
how sexy is the Dell?

8957
04:14:56,460 --> 04:14:57,293
Um,

8958
04:14:57,380 --> 04:14:58,630
I wouldn't say sexy.

8959
04:14:59,230 --> 04:15:01,030
I don't think I could get
it up in front of a demon.

8960
04:15:01,380 --> 04:15:01,550
No,

8961
04:15:01,550 --> 04:15:01,581
no,

8962
04:15:01,581 --> 04:15:01,661
no,

8963
04:15:01,661 --> 04:15:02,440
no demon.

8964
04:15:02,440 --> 04:15:03,220
This is Lucifer.

8965
04:15:03,220 --> 04:15:03,311
Oh,

8966
04:15:03,311 --> 04:15:04,144
the big one.

8967
04:15:04,480 --> 04:15:05,560
The Big Daddy.

8968
04:15:05,710 --> 04:15:06,190
You know,

8969
04:15:06,190 --> 04:15:07,750
you never know until he's kissing you.

8970
04:15:07,751 --> 04:15:11,990
I guess you could be the
next Sam Kinison now.

8971
04:15:11,991 --> 04:15:13,040
But it's a thing like,

8972
04:15:13,100 --> 04:15:13,933
you know what I mean?

8973
04:15:14,030 --> 04:15:18,480
Remember Sam Kinison was like a preacher
in a yelling about the baby's preaches

8974
04:15:18,530 --> 04:15:18,891
Christ.

8975
04:15:18,891 --> 04:15:21,220
He was at the top and he

8976
04:15:22,790 --> 04:15:27,740
jokes about this when I was a little kid
and I was having one of these visions

8977
04:15:27,741 --> 04:15:28,574
when I was asleep.

8978
04:15:28,850 --> 04:15:30,680
I hadn't seen Conan the destroyer yet.

8979
04:15:30,710 --> 04:15:33,820
Or Conan the barbarian was
the first one kind of story.

8980
04:15:34,070 --> 04:15:34,410
Remember,

8981
04:15:34,410 --> 04:15:36,140
I like the demons like laying on its side.

8982
04:15:36,150 --> 04:15:37,040
So just good looking guy.

8983
04:15:37,280 --> 04:15:39,400
It turns into this big fucking Goblin tax.

8984
04:15:39,430 --> 04:15:40,160
Everybody.

8985
04:15:40,160 --> 04:15:41,870
And when I was a kid
that was like a thing.

8986
04:15:41,871 --> 04:15:42,021
Like,

8987
04:15:42,021 --> 04:15:42,854
I would like try to,

8988
04:15:43,270 --> 04:15:44,120
and these dreams,

8989
04:15:44,121 --> 04:15:45,950
these I go way back as a university,

8990
04:15:45,951 --> 04:15:47,300
but like I was like,

8991
04:15:47,330 --> 04:15:50,090
it's a gay dude like sitting
there on his side like this.

8992
04:15:50,480 --> 04:15:52,190
And then a few years later I saw Conan.

8993
04:15:52,460 --> 04:15:53,450
So the shorter and I'm like,

8994
04:15:53,480 --> 04:15:57,010
that's the thing from the drain did show
what I'm saying is they know shorten.

8995
04:15:57,120 --> 04:15:57,440
Okay.

8996
04:15:57,440 --> 04:15:59,280
You seen like the hobbit remake?

8997
04:15:59,390 --> 04:15:59,711
Yeah,

8998
04:15:59,711 --> 04:16:00,260
yeah.

8999
04:16:00,260 --> 04:16:05,260
Where Gandalf goes to the castle and
sore on not made his body yet and he,

9000
04:16:06,060 --> 04:16:08,300
he looked looks like that
and he'd like that fire.

9001
04:16:08,330 --> 04:16:09,800
I've seen exactly that.

9002
04:16:10,310 --> 04:16:14,840
So you want to talk about what that
real controllers of the grays are?

9003
04:16:15,200 --> 04:16:15,651
It looks like,

9004
04:16:15,651 --> 04:16:15,980
sorry,

9005
04:16:15,980 --> 04:16:18,200
have you ever had a
significant head injury?

9006
04:16:21,110 --> 04:16:21,943
What happened to

9007
04:16:23,510 --> 04:16:24,343
what happened to,

9008
04:16:24,380 --> 04:16:24,800
you know,

9009
04:16:24,800 --> 04:16:27,880
they're going to NPR piece coming out
next week that I apologize to the guy that

9010
04:16:27,920 --> 04:16:28,753
never did that.

9011
04:16:29,060 --> 04:16:29,571
What happened?

9012
04:16:29,571 --> 04:16:30,470
What happened to your head?

9013
04:16:30,880 --> 04:16:32,220
I've been called rock you,

9014
04:16:32,240 --> 04:16:33,410
somebody's pile drive to you.

9015
04:16:33,670 --> 04:16:34,503
What happened?

9016
04:16:36,050 --> 04:16:36,883
How old were you?

9017
04:16:37,380 --> 04:16:37,740
Uh,

9018
04:16:37,740 --> 04:16:38,573
was about 13,

9019
04:16:38,630 --> 04:16:39,051
13,

9020
04:16:39,051 --> 04:16:39,490
14.

9021
04:16:39,490 --> 04:16:41,870
So many pile drives you and you
had to change your personality.

9022
04:16:41,900 --> 04:16:44,120
I got up and punched him in the
throat and the head dragging anatomy,

9023
04:16:44,121 --> 04:16:44,954
I was dead.

9024
04:16:45,260 --> 04:16:46,093
Wow.

9025
04:16:47,210 --> 04:16:48,570
So was it a friend of yours?

9026
04:16:48,600 --> 04:16:50,330
It was like the state wrestling champion,

9027
04:16:50,331 --> 04:16:53,000
middle light and he his
cousin or something.

9028
04:16:53,001 --> 04:16:54,200
And The Dallas was like this,

9029
04:16:54,240 --> 04:16:55,073
like,

9030
04:16:55,280 --> 04:16:55,611
you know,

9031
04:16:55,611 --> 04:16:56,390
got me down.

9032
04:16:56,390 --> 04:16:57,590
I was never starting five man.

9033
04:16:57,591 --> 04:16:58,250
These people,

9034
04:16:58,250 --> 04:16:58,640
here's the thing,

9035
04:16:58,640 --> 04:17:00,650
I'm out of victim of racial attacks.

9036
04:17:00,680 --> 04:17:05,680
I'm not like Jeffrey or Jessie smaller
as I fought rednecks and I got my leg

9037
04:17:05,901 --> 04:17:06,370
broken,

9038
04:17:06,370 --> 04:17:07,100
you know by,

9039
04:17:07,100 --> 04:17:08,720
so this guy pile drive you and your head,

9040
04:17:08,721 --> 04:17:09,560
you knew 13

9041
04:17:11,120 --> 04:17:11,510
yeah.

9042
04:17:11,510 --> 04:17:13,630
And then what did it do
to your personality then?

9043
04:17:13,640 --> 04:17:14,900
I had to fight his whole family.

9044
04:17:15,500 --> 04:17:16,340
Most his family.

9045
04:17:16,341 --> 04:17:17,350
It was a gamechanger.

9046
04:17:17,390 --> 04:17:17,900
Did it change?

9047
04:17:17,900 --> 04:17:21,200
But did you have any significant
change from that head injury?

9048
04:17:21,860 --> 04:17:23,390
Sometimes when people have hand injuries,

9049
04:17:23,720 --> 04:17:24,530
especially,

9050
04:17:24,530 --> 04:17:25,041
it seems like,

9051
04:17:25,041 --> 04:17:25,430
you know,

9052
04:17:25,430 --> 04:17:26,630
stuff's just got better.

9053
04:17:27,100 --> 04:17:27,600
Real.

9054
04:17:27,600 --> 04:17:28,433
Oh,

9055
04:17:29,440 --> 04:17:30,273
go

9056
04:17:31,930 --> 04:17:32,763
serious.

9057
04:17:32,900 --> 04:17:33,321
It's like,

9058
04:17:33,321 --> 04:17:33,501
dude,

9059
04:17:33,501 --> 04:17:35,030
we got to get to the root timing.

9060
04:17:35,080 --> 04:17:35,930
That's good timing.

9061
04:17:36,160 --> 04:17:36,400
No,

9062
04:17:36,400 --> 04:17:36,670
no,

9063
04:17:36,670 --> 04:17:37,040
no,

9064
04:17:37,040 --> 04:17:37,341
no.

9065
04:17:37,341 --> 04:17:39,740
I mean that's happened to a lot of,

9066
04:17:39,780 --> 04:17:40,613
there's no doubt.

9067
04:17:40,670 --> 04:17:43,910
My friend Dave Foley was just on here
and he was talking about how he got drunk

9068
04:17:43,911 --> 04:17:45,310
and he fell down and cracked his head.

9069
04:17:45,350 --> 04:17:45,800
It,

9070
04:17:45,800 --> 04:17:46,431
it's crazy.

9071
04:17:46,431 --> 04:17:48,320
But he cured his depression that little,

9072
04:17:48,321 --> 04:17:51,440
it looks like playing this any given time.

9073
04:17:51,470 --> 04:17:52,950
If somebody is a regular guy and,

9074
04:17:53,140 --> 04:17:54,530
and I would never start a fight.

9075
04:17:54,531 --> 04:17:57,020
They kicked my ass like the
average hundred 50 pound guy,

9076
04:17:57,021 --> 04:17:57,854
you're probably getting my ass.

9077
04:17:58,520 --> 04:18:00,770
But when like a bunch of
people are coming after me,

9078
04:18:00,980 --> 04:18:03,830
it's like Darth Vader and

9079
04:18:06,080 --> 04:18:06,950
I was a kid.

9080
04:18:07,640 --> 04:18:08,550
I mean I learned,

9081
04:18:10,570 --> 04:18:12,840
I bash somebody shouting into
the concrete when they attack me.

9082
04:18:13,200 --> 04:18:14,100
I got hired now.

9083
04:18:14,640 --> 04:18:17,040
And when the kid dropped you on your head,

9084
04:18:17,190 --> 04:18:19,050
what effect did it have on you physically?

9085
04:18:19,260 --> 04:18:23,460
It was by the field house because his
cousin had attacked me and I beat him up.

9086
04:18:24,330 --> 04:18:26,400
And so the state wrestling champ,

9087
04:18:26,401 --> 04:18:27,540
it was like a senior comes.

9088
04:18:27,850 --> 04:18:28,111
He goes,

9089
04:18:28,111 --> 04:18:28,630
oh yeah.

9090
04:18:28,630 --> 04:18:32,400
He came around and he caught up when on
my head was bleeding like he'd won and I

9091
04:18:32,401 --> 04:18:33,890
punched him in the neck and brokers,

9092
04:18:34,490 --> 04:18:35,350
it had a tracheotomy.

9093
04:18:35,380 --> 04:18:36,213
He almost died.

9094
04:18:36,520 --> 04:18:36,811
It was like,

9095
04:18:36,811 --> 04:18:36,991
yeah,

9096
04:18:36,991 --> 04:18:37,771
you almost killed me.

9097
04:18:37,771 --> 04:18:38,280
He was like,

9098
04:18:38,280 --> 04:18:38,731
he couldn't,

9099
04:18:38,731 --> 04:18:38,851
like,

9100
04:18:38,851 --> 04:18:40,170
he slammed me in the ground,

9101
04:18:40,171 --> 04:18:41,004
my head's bleeding,

9102
04:18:41,070 --> 04:18:42,180
all these stitches right here.

9103
04:18:42,360 --> 04:18:45,420
And then he couldn't believe
when I got up and said,

9104
04:18:45,421 --> 04:18:45,531
well,

9105
04:18:45,531 --> 04:18:46,364
you die.

9106
04:18:46,530 --> 04:18:51,090
He couldn't understand like
the energetic of equivalents.

9107
04:18:51,120 --> 04:18:52,680
He couldn't understand being the nail.

9108
04:18:52,710 --> 04:18:54,240
You don't want to
understand being the hammer.

9109
04:18:54,750 --> 04:18:55,650
He didn't understand that.

9110
04:18:56,010 --> 04:18:56,800
And then they,

9111
04:18:56,800 --> 04:18:56,971
you know,

9112
04:18:56,971 --> 04:18:58,230
they took me to jail and they let me go.

9113
04:18:58,231 --> 04:18:59,130
I'm on some tough guy.

9114
04:18:59,400 --> 04:18:59,761
The point is,

9115
04:18:59,761 --> 04:19:00,451
I'm getting killed.

9116
04:19:00,451 --> 04:19:01,284
I'm going to fight back.

9117
04:19:01,770 --> 04:19:02,200
And,

9118
04:19:02,200 --> 04:19:03,400
and so Dallas was like,

9119
04:19:03,401 --> 04:19:04,650
what happened to your head after that?

9120
04:19:06,140 --> 04:19:06,660
I mean,

9121
04:19:06,660 --> 04:19:06,961
I,

9122
04:19:06,961 --> 04:19:07,794
uh,

9123
04:19:08,780 --> 04:19:10,430
I never even got knocked out in that one,

9124
04:19:10,950 --> 04:19:11,260
uh,

9125
04:19:11,260 --> 04:19:12,740
that you slammed my head in the ground.

9126
04:19:13,000 --> 04:19:13,491
And I remember like,

9127
04:19:13,491 --> 04:19:15,440
everybody made a joke
because the concrete cracked.

9128
04:19:15,650 --> 04:19:15,840
Oh,

9129
04:19:15,840 --> 04:19:17,390
Jay was like on the edge of the congress.

9130
04:19:17,391 --> 04:19:18,080
He,

9131
04:19:18,080 --> 04:19:20,300
he called rob me right into the concrete.

9132
04:19:21,120 --> 04:19:21,410
I'm like,

9133
04:19:21,410 --> 04:19:22,340
split my head way over.

9134
04:19:22,370 --> 04:19:23,203
Let's just write a story.

9135
04:19:23,350 --> 04:19:24,630
And I remember just getting up.

9136
04:19:24,631 --> 04:19:27,270
It was like slow motion puts you
right in the neck and the ambulances.

9137
04:19:27,290 --> 04:19:28,123
The police came.

9138
04:19:28,430 --> 04:19:29,360
That was that story.

9139
04:19:29,820 --> 04:19:30,780
Did you,

9140
04:19:31,100 --> 04:19:32,600
did you go to the hospital?

9141
04:19:34,140 --> 04:19:34,820
Yeah.

9142
04:19:34,820 --> 04:19:34,971
No,

9143
04:19:34,971 --> 04:19:36,260
they told me to jail for that,

9144
04:19:36,261 --> 04:19:37,460
but then they'd let me go.

9145
04:19:37,670 --> 04:19:38,870
They didn't check your head.

9146
04:19:39,080 --> 04:19:40,300
Did you tell them you got piled try?

9147
04:19:40,301 --> 04:19:40,641
I don't know.

9148
04:19:40,641 --> 04:19:41,474
They soaked it up.

9149
04:19:41,630 --> 04:19:42,463
They sewed it up in the,

9150
04:19:42,530 --> 04:19:43,363
in the jail.

9151
04:19:44,380 --> 04:19:47,570
They didn't like check to see if you
had a severe concussion or a sham dermal

9152
04:19:47,571 --> 04:19:48,051
hematoma.

9153
04:19:48,051 --> 04:19:48,860
No.

9154
04:19:48,860 --> 04:19:49,693
Wow.

9155
04:19:49,820 --> 04:19:50,271
Go ahead.

9156
04:19:50,271 --> 04:19:54,650
Joseph had been the one you think that
he's a conspiracy theorist cause it got

9157
04:19:54,651 --> 04:19:55,550
dropped on his head.

9158
04:19:55,850 --> 04:19:56,300
Uh,

9159
04:19:56,300 --> 04:19:57,133
I think,

9160
04:19:57,290 --> 04:19:58,430
I think there's something,

9161
04:19:59,150 --> 04:20:03,170
there's something to people that have
had head trauma that become brilliant at

9162
04:20:03,171 --> 04:20:04,160
speaking things.

9163
04:20:04,340 --> 04:20:04,940
That's true.

9164
04:20:04,940 --> 04:20:05,773
The blast.

9165
04:20:08,160 --> 04:20:09,970
Like his name was John,

9166
04:20:10,490 --> 04:20:11,390
his name was Cory strange.

9167
04:20:11,630 --> 04:20:13,430
The only reason he won,

9168
04:20:13,620 --> 04:20:15,440
he was battered or power for the me.

9169
04:20:15,590 --> 04:20:16,940
Is He fucking,

9170
04:20:17,480 --> 04:20:20,330
he had six packs because like
Arnold Schwarzenegger black dude,

9171
04:20:20,720 --> 04:20:24,260
he waited and gloated while
blood was coming out of my head.

9172
04:20:24,410 --> 04:20:25,190
Oh Shit.

9173
04:20:25,190 --> 04:20:28,240
Reason he lost was he
loaded and there's way more.

9174
04:20:29,750 --> 04:20:30,440
But you're,

9175
04:20:30,440 --> 04:20:32,210
you broke the concrete with your head.

9176
04:20:32,570 --> 04:20:33,403
That's big.

9177
04:20:33,800 --> 04:20:34,580
No you didn't.

9178
04:20:34,580 --> 04:20:36,440
The concrete didn't actually break in it.

9179
04:20:36,560 --> 04:20:37,251
Maybe it did,

9180
04:20:37,251 --> 04:20:38,084
but they made the job.

9181
04:20:38,840 --> 04:20:39,200
Okay.

9182
04:20:39,200 --> 04:20:40,850
So either a dinner as I knocked out,

9183
04:20:40,851 --> 04:20:42,050
he's still got spiked on it.

9184
04:20:42,420 --> 04:20:43,070
Call me.

9185
04:20:43,070 --> 04:20:43,760
No.

9186
04:20:43,760 --> 04:20:45,740
Do getting spiked on your
head on the concrete.

9187
04:20:46,040 --> 04:20:47,990
Shogun myself with other people for fun.

9188
04:20:48,260 --> 04:20:49,580
I've never been knocked out.

9189
04:20:50,570 --> 04:20:50,871
Okay.

9190
04:20:50,871 --> 04:20:54,290
So I don't think one time I got here and
then you've got drove to hold daggers.

9191
04:20:55,250 --> 04:20:55,890
Correct?

9192
04:20:55,890 --> 04:20:56,661
You're incorrect.

9193
04:20:56,661 --> 04:20:56,991
So you,

9194
04:20:56,991 --> 04:20:59,600
you absolutely can't
barely tapped his head.

9195
04:20:59,630 --> 04:21:00,710
He would have been knocked out.

9196
04:21:00,950 --> 04:21:01,970
Maybe not you.

9197
04:21:01,971 --> 04:21:02,804
It doesn't matter.

9198
04:21:02,830 --> 04:21:05,720
Like sometimes people get knocked
out through severe head injury.

9199
04:21:05,721 --> 04:21:06,700
Sometimes they don't.

9200
04:21:07,030 --> 04:21:08,440
Sometimes they're heads cracked.

9201
04:21:09,140 --> 04:21:09,973
My Dad,

9202
04:21:10,450 --> 04:21:11,140
hold on.

9203
04:21:11,140 --> 04:21:12,940
Sometimes they never lose consciousness.

9204
04:21:12,941 --> 04:21:14,800
You can't think that they
always lose consciousness.

9205
04:21:14,801 --> 04:21:16,480
Sometimes it's cracked out.

9206
04:21:16,750 --> 04:21:17,890
I would see like numbers,

9207
04:21:17,891 --> 04:21:20,240
like I was a robot and
then red I would she like,

9208
04:21:20,330 --> 04:21:21,200
remember she's random.

9209
04:21:21,910 --> 04:21:22,880
She's like,

9210
04:21:26,750 --> 04:21:27,430
no,

9211
04:21:27,430 --> 04:21:28,263
it's your story.

9212
04:21:28,600 --> 04:21:29,290
That's your story,

9213
04:21:29,290 --> 04:21:29,621
Dude.

9214
04:21:29,621 --> 04:21:29,831
Man.

9215
04:21:29,831 --> 04:21:33,670
When when you get dinged there's something
about getting dinged with a punch and

9216
04:21:33,671 --> 04:21:37,060
you see that flash and you realize that
you let your central nervous system is

9217
04:21:37,061 --> 04:21:42,061
like 30% functional like whoa
variable but very weird feeling.

9218
04:21:42,780 --> 04:21:43,660
[inaudible] Joe's done it.

9219
04:21:43,990 --> 04:21:44,890
That's what the people say.

9220
04:21:44,891 --> 04:21:45,581
She stars.

9221
04:21:45,581 --> 04:21:46,120
Yeah,

9222
04:21:46,120 --> 04:21:49,300
that's what it was a very
said oh Hollywood stars
because they'd seen the stars.

9223
04:21:49,720 --> 04:21:51,790
Like each star is like a whole data bank.

9224
04:21:52,150 --> 04:21:54,520
And I remember like some dude
choking me and like guys are like,

9225
04:21:54,850 --> 04:21:57,970
somebody was like pulling a knife
out and you see that knife point out,

9226
04:21:57,980 --> 04:21:58,813
you're like,

9227
04:21:59,340 --> 04:22:00,173
and like

9228
04:22:01,510 --> 04:22:06,510
at that point you are she everything
for only those minutes when everything's

9229
04:22:06,641 --> 04:22:09,460
clear it's like survival emotions.

9230
04:22:10,180 --> 04:22:11,320
But then you see like,

9231
04:22:12,280 --> 04:22:14,590
like the wars and the attacks,

9232
04:22:15,130 --> 04:22:17,290
the submarines of the
space craft and like,

9233
04:22:17,650 --> 04:22:21,010
it's like when you dial into
that it's like total war.

9234
04:22:21,011 --> 04:22:21,844
It's like,

9235
04:22:21,970 --> 04:22:23,650
didn't you say that when your
friends would choke you out,

9236
04:22:23,651 --> 04:22:25,540
you'd have with these long dreams?

9237
04:22:25,600 --> 04:22:26,051
Oh yeah.

9238
04:22:26,051 --> 04:22:26,221
No,

9239
04:22:26,221 --> 04:22:26,350
no,

9240
04:22:26,350 --> 04:22:26,491
no.

9241
04:22:26,491 --> 04:22:28,360
It'd be out for a couple
of centers in junior high.

9242
04:22:28,361 --> 04:22:28,691
Sixth,

9243
04:22:28,691 --> 04:22:28,931
seventh,

9244
04:22:28,931 --> 04:22:29,730
eighth grade.

9245
04:22:29,730 --> 04:22:30,180
Cause we,

9246
04:22:30,180 --> 04:22:31,540
I got choked out a couple of times.

9247
04:22:31,990 --> 04:22:34,570
I finally stopped and
there'd always be like,

9248
04:22:34,571 --> 04:22:36,100
guys like it's incredible.

9249
04:22:36,101 --> 04:22:39,610
We do this during lunch and we'd go
back and like someone press on their

9250
04:22:39,611 --> 04:22:44,430
arteries like the bad times when you hit
your habit and be like one time like I

9251
04:22:44,560 --> 04:22:45,950
remember this one time I,

9252
04:22:46,570 --> 04:22:47,440
they choke me out.

9253
04:22:47,440 --> 04:22:51,520
And also it was like a black knight with
a sword goes and like a tax me on this

9254
04:22:51,521 --> 04:22:56,521
horse and then why it was and then I was
like in England thousands of years ago

9255
04:22:57,071 --> 04:23:00,970
and I had this wife for these kids and
it was a whole lifetime like taking care

9256
04:23:00,971 --> 04:23:02,550
of them and like growing food,

9257
04:23:02,590 --> 04:23:04,750
like a kid starved to death or died.

9258
04:23:05,680 --> 04:23:10,120
It was like just those moments
where like whole lives,

9259
04:23:10,570 --> 04:23:11,231
dead kids,

9260
04:23:11,231 --> 04:23:12,064
everything.

9261
04:23:12,130 --> 04:23:12,761
That's what I'm saying.

9262
04:23:12,761 --> 04:23:17,260
Like you dial in to all those ancestors
and it was like my kids and kids

9263
04:23:17,261 --> 04:23:20,170
starving to death and
like people attacking us.

9264
04:23:20,171 --> 04:23:23,770
And so you think all that information
from your ancestors somehow or another

9265
04:23:23,771 --> 04:23:25,930
encoded somewhere and
get buying coated Joe.

9266
04:23:28,690 --> 04:23:29,321
That makes sense.

9267
04:23:29,321 --> 04:23:31,660
If you think about what
reincarnation must feel like,

9268
04:23:31,970 --> 04:23:32,410
you know when,

9269
04:23:32,410 --> 04:23:33,640
when people have that feeling,

9270
04:23:33,641 --> 04:23:37,990
they felt this feeling that they live
before our whole bodies are everybody

9271
04:23:37,991 --> 04:23:38,411
before us.

9272
04:23:38,411 --> 04:23:38,630
Right.

9273
04:23:38,630 --> 04:23:40,300
Well it's not quite exactly.

9274
04:23:40,420 --> 04:23:41,120
So people,

9275
04:23:41,120 --> 04:23:42,150
they underestimate like,

9276
04:23:42,160 --> 04:23:43,630
oh I live before.

9277
04:23:43,631 --> 04:23:43,990
No,

9278
04:23:43,990 --> 04:23:47,560
they all live before they
would also explain certain
fears that people just have

9279
04:23:47,561 --> 04:23:48,161
his children,

9280
04:23:48,161 --> 04:23:49,690
like children have a fear of animals.

9281
04:23:49,960 --> 04:23:51,490
Like you see an animal with big teeth.

9282
04:23:51,610 --> 04:23:56,350
Children have a natch ever been attacked
by k but their ancestors got killed by

9283
04:23:56,351 --> 04:23:56,890
them.

9284
04:23:56,890 --> 04:24:00,490
They probably got attacked by
some bear somewhere and you know,

9285
04:24:00,491 --> 04:24:03,860
and somehow or another they got
through and they survived and

9286
04:24:04,110 --> 04:24:04,943
there.

9287
04:24:06,340 --> 04:24:06,740
Yup.

9288
04:24:06,740 --> 04:24:07,550
Yup.

9289
04:24:07,550 --> 04:24:09,590
It makes sense how animals learn things.

9290
04:24:09,591 --> 04:24:11,000
I mean animals just know things.

9291
04:24:11,150 --> 04:24:12,680
My dog would epigenics they have stone.

9292
04:24:12,681 --> 04:24:13,180
Yeah.

9293
04:24:13,180 --> 04:24:17,040
Or they can take 10
generation chickens enclosed.

9294
04:24:17,130 --> 04:24:20,390
Ut did a study on this like 20
years ago and fly a hawk over.

9295
04:24:20,391 --> 04:24:21,224
They all ran scared.

9296
04:24:21,560 --> 04:24:22,460
They fly triangle.

9297
04:24:22,461 --> 04:24:24,590
Nobody hears the exact shape of a hawk.

9298
04:24:25,190 --> 04:24:27,470
Makes all the chickens
run because they've,

9299
04:24:27,810 --> 04:24:29,180
it's programming.

9300
04:24:29,300 --> 04:24:30,080
Exactly.

9301
04:24:30,080 --> 04:24:30,913
Exactly.

9302
04:24:30,950 --> 04:24:34,220
It's why if you have a puppy
and you take it for walks,

9303
04:24:34,221 --> 04:24:35,570
even when it's like six weeks old,

9304
04:24:35,571 --> 04:24:37,250
it'll never be around another dog again.

9305
04:24:37,280 --> 04:24:40,790
It knows exactly what to do and knows
how to sniff things and Piss on trees,

9306
04:24:41,000 --> 04:24:42,260
knows a check for other dogs,

9307
04:24:42,261 --> 04:24:43,790
pis and knows what to do.

9308
04:24:43,820 --> 04:24:44,590
They know what to do.

9309
04:24:44,590 --> 04:24:44,961
There's a,

9310
04:24:44,961 --> 04:24:45,560
there's a certain,

9311
04:24:45,560 --> 04:24:47,240
they know what animals to chase.

9312
04:24:47,241 --> 04:24:47,961
They see a squirrel.

9313
04:24:47,961 --> 04:24:50,390
They want to go ask to
show what I've lined up is,

9314
04:24:50,450 --> 04:24:51,380
but then when you know,

9315
04:24:51,740 --> 04:24:54,320
is it looks like our species is super old.

9316
04:24:54,620 --> 04:24:55,453
How old?

9317
04:24:55,820 --> 04:24:59,030
I don't know cause I can't even
interpret the stuff I've seen.

9318
04:24:59,630 --> 04:25:02,820
I mean I saw like you've seen like a,

9319
04:25:03,790 --> 04:25:07,570
what's that stupid Tom Cruise movie
where stupid Tom Cruise movie.

9320
04:25:07,580 --> 04:25:08,510
How dare you,

9321
04:25:09,320 --> 04:25:13,250
how dare you Jack reacher
check Ruthie to oblivion.

9322
04:25:14,030 --> 04:25:15,950
They've got the guy at
landers shelling up.

9323
04:25:15,980 --> 04:25:16,430
Oh yeah,

9324
04:25:16,430 --> 04:25:16,660
yeah.

9325
04:25:16,660 --> 04:25:21,260
In stuck in the ocean of I was a dope
movie and outside and he doesn't even know

9326
04:25:21,261 --> 04:25:22,550
he's working for the system.

9327
04:25:23,270 --> 04:25:27,590
And so that's what I'm telling
you is literally whatever it is,

9328
04:25:27,591 --> 04:25:28,424
just like a joke,

9329
04:25:28,730 --> 04:25:29,770
like whatever created us,

9330
04:25:29,780 --> 04:25:31,070
he's like super bad ash,

9331
04:25:31,250 --> 04:25:35,180
but is it possible that there's not a
thing that created us but that we are just

9332
04:25:35,181 --> 04:25:38,630
like every other organism and every
other system on this planet with this

9333
04:25:38,810 --> 04:25:42,920
constantly evolving thing that doesn't
really have a leader and it's trying to

9334
04:25:42,921 --> 04:25:44,540
get better constantly at everything?

9335
04:25:44,540 --> 04:25:46,280
It does and I agree with you,

9336
04:25:46,281 --> 04:25:46,880
but this is just,

9337
04:25:46,880 --> 04:25:49,970
this is where the stops three 60 Joe,

9338
04:25:49,971 --> 04:25:50,601
you're right,

9339
04:25:50,601 --> 04:25:53,660
but there wasn't a worm learned how
to crawl up the ass of a grasshopper

9340
04:25:54,050 --> 04:25:55,130
programming and do that.

9341
04:25:55,131 --> 04:26:00,131
That there was some prime essence that
was put into things that did that that

9342
04:26:00,651 --> 04:26:02,840
said free will and we're
the top of the food chain.

9343
04:26:02,841 --> 04:26:06,260
Or was it thousands and thousands
of generations of failures,

9344
04:26:06,620 --> 04:26:10,820
thousands of generations of bugs that
got into this grasshopper just was just

9345
04:26:10,821 --> 04:26:13,700
killed it and then wind up
suffocating to death inside of it.

9346
04:26:13,701 --> 04:26:14,900
Even though they were a parasite,

9347
04:26:14,901 --> 04:26:16,390
they never figured out
a way to get in filing.

9348
04:26:16,400 --> 04:26:20,120
One figure it out and finally one of
them through some sort of weird mutation,

9349
04:26:20,121 --> 04:26:23,660
figured out a way to interact with the
brain of the grasshopper and actually

9350
04:26:23,661 --> 04:26:24,860
guide it to the lake,

9351
04:26:25,190 --> 04:26:27,090
get it to jump into the water and drown.

9352
04:26:27,120 --> 04:26:31,040
That's a burst from its body
and then swim away officers.

9353
04:26:31,310 --> 04:26:32,630
But I think it's one of the most unlikely.

9354
04:26:32,690 --> 04:26:34,100
But if you talking about things,

9355
04:26:34,101 --> 04:26:35,180
learning from things,

9356
04:26:35,210 --> 04:26:39,230
if things learn from things and they
keep getting better over thousands and

9357
04:26:39,230 --> 04:26:39,951
thousands of generations,

9358
04:26:39,951 --> 04:26:42,050
but these same things keep procreating,

9359
04:26:42,500 --> 04:26:45,830
wouldn't it eventually get to some
state where it figures out how to do

9360
04:26:45,831 --> 04:26:49,760
something if it is still a parasite and
it gets inside the body would have it

9361
04:26:49,761 --> 04:26:50,240
figured out,

9362
04:26:50,240 --> 04:26:50,391
oh,

9363
04:26:50,391 --> 04:26:53,660
if I just like grow these things off
the top of my head and connect it to the

9364
04:26:53,661 --> 04:26:54,111
brand,

9365
04:26:54,111 --> 04:26:57,030
this dumb little motherfucker
and get them to drowning deaths.

9366
04:26:57,820 --> 04:26:58,850
Mutated a ride.

9367
04:26:58,940 --> 04:26:59,091
Yeah,

9368
04:26:59,091 --> 04:27:03,960
they just make the connection and all
the sales go up and eaten by birds shit

9369
04:27:03,961 --> 04:27:04,600
down.

9370
04:27:04,600 --> 04:27:05,180
It's more,

9371
04:27:05,180 --> 04:27:06,570
more animals eat it and that's the thing.

9372
04:27:06,600 --> 04:27:11,040
I think we're dealing with an unfathomable
number of creatures that are being

9373
04:27:11,041 --> 04:27:13,830
born and dying and new ones
are being born and dying.

9374
04:27:14,100 --> 04:27:18,180
I think our puny little
brains can't really calculate
the exact amount of cycles

9375
04:27:18,181 --> 04:27:23,181
that it takes a single celled
organism to free speech then yes,

9376
04:27:23,801 --> 04:27:28,350
that's just big open 100% so is it the
whole modern leftist Dang a denial,

9377
04:27:28,370 --> 04:27:30,660
the leftest ate toast that we're
going to let things be free.

9378
04:27:30,750 --> 04:27:31,021
Well,

9379
04:27:31,021 --> 04:27:36,021
the problem is the leftists ethos is also
the idea of inclusiveness and kindness

9380
04:27:36,331 --> 04:27:37,130
and caring.

9381
04:27:37,130 --> 04:27:39,600
I like the idea is that they're
promoting all the kindness.

9382
04:27:39,601 --> 04:27:39,781
No,

9383
04:27:39,781 --> 04:27:40,470
I get promoted.

9384
04:27:40,470 --> 04:27:42,120
Go had a fall once a day
and my five year olds,

9385
04:27:42,121 --> 04:27:42,630
okay,

9386
04:27:42,630 --> 04:27:44,670
but what I'm saying is kindness.

9387
04:27:44,671 --> 04:27:46,200
Unless you're a right wing person.

9388
04:27:46,680 --> 04:27:46,861
Now,

9389
04:27:46,861 --> 04:27:47,880
if you think on the right,

9390
04:27:47,910 --> 04:27:49,110
then they want to attack you,

9391
04:27:49,410 --> 04:27:50,171
then they want a,

9392
04:27:50,171 --> 04:27:53,220
they want to demonize you and if they
could shut you down and silence you and

9393
04:27:53,221 --> 04:27:55,500
find some sort of a
bullshit excuse to do so.

9394
04:27:55,680 --> 04:28:00,060
And a lot of cases it seems like some
folks lean in that direction and this is

9395
04:28:00,061 --> 04:28:01,650
where it gets dangerous because you can't,

9396
04:28:01,890 --> 04:28:03,210
it's like if someone says,

9397
04:28:03,211 --> 04:28:03,361
Hey,

9398
04:28:03,361 --> 04:28:04,141
if I knew how to fight,

9399
04:28:04,141 --> 04:28:04,980
I'd run in front of Pizza.

9400
04:28:04,981 --> 04:28:06,180
I just fuck everybody up.

9401
04:28:06,181 --> 04:28:06,450
Well,

9402
04:28:06,450 --> 04:28:10,110
you'd be dead in a year because eventually
people are going to kick your ass and

9403
04:28:10,111 --> 04:28:10,561
kill you.

9404
04:28:10,561 --> 04:28:11,940
You can't just beat people up.

9405
04:28:12,120 --> 04:28:12,280
Well,

9406
04:28:12,280 --> 04:28:12,970
yeah,

9407
04:28:12,970 --> 04:28:14,240
a one on one basis,

9408
04:28:14,670 --> 04:28:16,140
but it's that everybody gangs up an issue.

9409
04:28:16,170 --> 04:28:17,270
It's that childish,

9410
04:28:17,460 --> 04:28:18,900
childish mentality.

9411
04:28:18,960 --> 04:28:21,870
I'll just knock this person out
and nothing else will happen.

9412
04:28:22,150 --> 04:28:22,800
Like that's not,

9413
04:28:22,800 --> 04:28:22,941
you know,

9414
04:28:22,941 --> 04:28:24,810
you're setting a whole thing in motion.

9415
04:28:24,990 --> 04:28:26,250
When you silence someone,

9416
04:28:26,340 --> 04:28:29,670
you're setting a whole thing in motion
and this is something that we're all

9417
04:28:29,671 --> 04:28:30,330
learning.

9418
04:28:30,330 --> 04:28:31,980
This is what we have
to come to grips with.

9419
04:28:32,130 --> 04:28:36,090
Social media has only been around
for a really short amount of time.

9420
04:28:36,300 --> 04:28:40,380
It's only been around in this kind
of form for 10 plus years and we're,

9421
04:28:40,381 --> 04:28:44,010
we're figuring it out and these people
that think that they can just silence

9422
04:28:44,011 --> 04:28:48,690
people and shut people down without
it having a bad effect on all of us.

9423
04:28:48,780 --> 04:28:49,620
It's not right.

9424
04:28:50,250 --> 04:28:50,820
It's not right.

9425
04:28:50,820 --> 04:28:50,971
Well,

9426
04:28:50,971 --> 04:28:53,310
I appreciate it shouldn't be a
path toward your empty spaces.

9427
04:28:53,340 --> 04:28:54,030
Good.

9428
04:28:54,030 --> 04:28:54,331
Eddie,

9429
04:28:54,331 --> 04:28:59,331
what do you think it should be done about
the denial of the reign of terror of

9430
04:28:59,831 --> 04:29:00,664
censorship,

9431
04:29:00,690 --> 04:29:01,830
which admittedly going on,

9432
04:29:05,560 --> 04:29:06,011
I don't know.

9433
04:29:06,011 --> 04:29:06,580
Shit.

9434
04:29:06,580 --> 04:29:07,340
You know,

9435
04:29:07,340 --> 04:29:12,340
all I know is that it seems that the
right is being censored a lot and when you

9436
04:29:13,811 --> 04:29:16,420
look at the left and
how they've been acting,

9437
04:29:16,470 --> 04:29:18,880
I mean they're acting like psychopaths,

9438
04:29:19,930 --> 04:29:21,100
like pick,

9439
04:29:21,160 --> 04:29:21,431
you know,

9440
04:29:21,431 --> 04:29:24,610
putting signs up for late term
abortions and all that shit.

9441
04:29:25,150 --> 04:29:26,440
They're pushing that.

9442
04:29:26,441 --> 04:29:29,890
There's people pushing that AOC there.

9443
04:29:29,910 --> 04:29:30,743
It's,

9444
04:29:31,000 --> 04:29:33,190
it's like someone who's
trying to get fired.

9445
04:29:33,191 --> 04:29:33,431
You know,

9446
04:29:33,431 --> 04:29:33,651
when you're,

9447
04:29:33,651 --> 04:29:35,050
you have a job when you want to get fired,

9448
04:29:37,770 --> 04:29:41,470
who runs whole CIA squad and he said,

9449
04:29:41,800 --> 04:29:43,180
what do you think Alex?

9450
04:29:43,870 --> 04:29:45,130
It's like they want to lose.

9451
04:29:45,131 --> 04:29:46,000
What's the cyop?

9452
04:29:46,070 --> 04:29:46,903
I don't know.

9453
04:29:46,990 --> 04:29:48,370
It seems like they're trying to,

9454
04:29:48,371 --> 04:29:49,360
it's so bad,

9455
04:29:49,690 --> 04:29:50,411
it's so bad.

9456
04:29:50,411 --> 04:29:53,590
How much of that is influenced by people
that are trying to fuck with the whole

9457
04:29:53,591 --> 04:29:53,960
system?

9458
04:29:53,960 --> 04:29:58,420
Imagine if this is like
stage five Russian influence.

9459
04:29:58,510 --> 04:30:00,550
Just get to support

9460
04:30:00,640 --> 04:30:00,970
later,

9461
04:30:00,970 --> 04:30:03,880
like figure out a way to get people
to support super late term abortions.

9462
04:30:03,970 --> 04:30:08,970
Figuring out a way to get
people to Support Trans
Women competing as women with

9463
04:30:09,371 --> 04:30:11,450
no hormones on one high school.

9464
04:30:11,690 --> 04:30:14,770
We're like some 25 year old
dude's like 18 year old girls.

9465
04:30:14,771 --> 04:30:16,000
He takes all the,

9466
04:30:16,001 --> 04:30:17,890
all the titles like now guys haven't,

9467
04:30:17,950 --> 04:30:18,640
you know,

9468
04:30:18,640 --> 04:30:19,660
it's hilarious.

9469
04:30:21,330 --> 04:30:21,881
It's hilarious.

9470
04:30:21,881 --> 04:30:25,570
Imagine if your daughter was up for a
scholarship and she had to compete against

9471
04:30:25,571 --> 04:30:29,650
some six foot five man who identified as
a woman and wanted to play basketball.

9472
04:30:29,770 --> 04:30:30,551
I feel a,

9473
04:30:30,551 --> 04:30:30,970
if you've,

9474
04:30:30,970 --> 04:30:32,260
if you've committed a crime,

9475
04:30:32,350 --> 04:30:33,183
if you're a felon,

9476
04:30:33,340 --> 04:30:34,660
you can't chop your dick off.

9477
04:30:34,690 --> 04:30:35,231
You know what I mean?

9478
04:30:35,231 --> 04:30:36,610
I like the Japanese model.

9479
04:30:36,611 --> 04:30:36,971
They said,

9480
04:30:36,971 --> 04:30:37,600
hey,

9481
04:30:37,600 --> 04:30:40,200
cause I don't care if you're
a trans or you're dude,

9482
04:30:40,210 --> 04:30:40,550
once people,

9483
04:30:40,550 --> 04:30:42,220
and I don't literally
I'll have a libertarian,

9484
04:30:42,221 --> 04:30:43,690
don't act like I'm trying to suppress you.

9485
04:30:43,690 --> 04:30:45,520
But the Japanese said,

9486
04:30:45,521 --> 04:30:45,791
Hey,

9487
04:30:45,791 --> 04:30:46,030
uh,

9488
04:30:46,030 --> 04:30:49,500
you don't get the Trans destination
unless you chop the Johnson and the way it

9489
04:30:49,501 --> 04:30:50,240
goes off.

9490
04:30:50,240 --> 04:30:50,621
And it's like,

9491
04:30:50,621 --> 04:30:51,220
hey,

9492
04:30:51,220 --> 04:30:52,053
you get,

9493
04:30:52,150 --> 04:30:53,200
taxpayers will pay for it.

9494
04:30:53,201 --> 04:30:55,750
You get to a vagina bill and
then you sit there and do it.

9495
04:30:55,780 --> 04:30:56,690
Leave like,

9496
04:30:56,750 --> 04:30:57,010
you know,

9497
04:30:57,010 --> 04:30:59,260
I think there's a lot of people
that are legitimately trance.

9498
04:30:59,261 --> 04:31:00,071
That's not the problem.

9499
04:31:00,071 --> 04:31:02,770
The problem is them wanting
to compete as women.

9500
04:31:02,950 --> 04:31:06,820
And Martina Navratilova just caught a
rash of shit cause she was talking about

9501
04:31:06,821 --> 04:31:06,911
it,

9502
04:31:06,911 --> 04:31:07,061
you know,

9503
04:31:07,061 --> 04:31:08,200
to the famous tennis star.

9504
04:31:08,350 --> 04:31:11,110
She's talking about it that women are
breaking all these records and right after

9505
04:31:11,111 --> 04:31:12,280
she said that these kids,

9506
04:31:13,020 --> 04:31:15,100
number one and two were transgender.

9507
04:31:15,101 --> 04:31:15,551
That one,

9508
04:31:15,551 --> 04:31:18,910
the girls high school
track meet and it's just,

9509
04:31:19,630 --> 04:31:20,020
you know,

9510
04:31:20,020 --> 04:31:21,220
at a certain time you gotta go,

9511
04:31:21,221 --> 04:31:22,240
you gotta stop doing this.

9512
04:31:22,241 --> 04:31:22,491
This is,

9513
04:31:22,491 --> 04:31:23,740
we're talking about competition.

9514
04:31:23,750 --> 04:31:26,460
Somebody because they think
they're another sex that,

9515
04:31:26,890 --> 04:31:28,390
but like same timeline,

9516
04:31:28,690 --> 04:31:32,300
I watched like bike races and
running races and soccer and,

9517
04:31:32,540 --> 04:31:33,550
and high jumping.

9518
04:31:33,551 --> 04:31:34,420
It's a dude.

9519
04:31:34,421 --> 04:31:35,980
Like he thought just like this is,

9520
04:31:35,990 --> 04:31:36,731
you're bigger than me.

9521
04:31:36,731 --> 04:31:40,150
They're like these six foot $4 whose
shoulders when we kicked my ass.

9522
04:31:40,780 --> 04:31:41,613
Oh,

9523
04:31:41,670 --> 04:31:43,150
was a girl or like what?

9524
04:31:43,151 --> 04:31:43,960
I mean that's,

9525
04:31:43,960 --> 04:31:45,070
that's been a little less man.

9526
04:31:45,310 --> 04:31:45,790
Yeah,

9527
04:31:45,790 --> 04:31:46,750
there's a,

9528
04:31:46,810 --> 04:31:48,280
there's some nonsense going on.

9529
04:31:48,520 --> 04:31:51,220
There's some people that are legit and
then there's some people that are just

9530
04:31:51,221 --> 04:31:52,270
legitimately crazy.

9531
04:31:52,330 --> 04:31:52,750
I mean there's,

9532
04:31:52,750 --> 04:31:56,200
but like with everything in life is
people that are legitimately trans and

9533
04:31:56,201 --> 04:31:57,380
there's people that have to,

9534
04:31:57,490 --> 04:32:00,240
a man wants to see himself as a woman,

9535
04:32:00,250 --> 04:32:01,900
a lodger neck shows the
Kimball's that happens,

9536
04:32:02,140 --> 04:32:02,771
that's their issue,

9537
04:32:02,771 --> 04:32:03,510
whatever.

9538
04:32:03,510 --> 04:32:04,660
Or vice versa.

9539
04:32:04,690 --> 04:32:05,523
But like,

9540
04:32:05,560 --> 04:32:08,740
I'm going to watch NFL and
like we're supposed to like,

9541
04:32:08,741 --> 04:32:08,981
you know,

9542
04:32:08,981 --> 04:32:13,780
like had a women's NFL and it's all
guys and they say they're women.

9543
04:32:14,380 --> 04:32:17,770
It was like a thing in England last year
where the guy comes in with tattoos,

9544
04:32:17,771 --> 04:32:20,110
a big beard and it was
in the police report.

9545
04:32:20,111 --> 04:32:24,970
That guy had like a foot long
cup and he goes do a cervix jam.

9546
04:32:25,000 --> 04:32:27,200
What kind of police
reported this and up pull?

9547
04:32:27,350 --> 04:32:28,360
The nurse said,

9548
04:32:28,390 --> 04:32:29,280
oh sure,

9549
04:32:30,310 --> 04:32:34,000
I don't see a vagina and
it was in the report.

9550
04:32:34,030 --> 04:32:35,770
The man had a foot long dick,

9551
04:32:36,790 --> 04:32:38,560
so she's supposed to mental yoga.

9552
04:32:38,561 --> 04:32:39,131
Okay,

9553
04:32:39,131 --> 04:32:42,040
well let me check all this and
to show that you've got all this.

9554
04:32:42,430 --> 04:32:44,380
I mean it's just like
it's mental illness man.

9555
04:32:44,600 --> 04:32:48,430
It's not that I hate somebody that
feels like they're a woman or a man or

9556
04:32:48,431 --> 04:32:49,264
whatever.

9557
04:32:49,330 --> 04:32:50,290
That's the lie that like,

9558
04:32:50,320 --> 04:32:50,561
Oh,

9559
04:32:50,561 --> 04:32:52,340
you need to accept this
or you hate everything.

9560
04:32:52,360 --> 04:32:56,290
Imagine if all this ridiculous
propaganda really was like the very,

9561
04:32:56,291 --> 04:33:01,291
very highest level Russian
meme farm propaganda and
this is why the people that,

9562
04:33:02,860 --> 04:33:07,670
it could totally be a saying this
the most posthumously leftist,

9563
04:33:07,910 --> 04:33:11,810
like even things like these babies being
resuscitated and then kill like that.

9564
04:33:11,810 --> 04:33:14,240
People wouldn't freak out when they
heard a guy talk about that kind of shit.

9565
04:33:14,600 --> 04:33:18,500
Imagine if this is all just designed
to make everybody go fucking crazy.

9566
04:33:18,950 --> 04:33:19,371
That was y'all.

9567
04:33:19,371 --> 04:33:23,750
I wish the governor sang
it and I am doing it.

9568
04:33:23,751 --> 04:33:24,780
And there's just one point we're going,

9569
04:33:24,800 --> 04:33:25,633
this transmission,

9570
04:33:25,910 --> 04:33:26,840
what is the end game?

9571
04:33:27,080 --> 04:33:27,891
What is the end game?

9572
04:33:27,891 --> 04:33:32,090
Alex cameras we're told as humanities
bad who manage wrecking things,

9573
04:33:32,390 --> 04:33:36,440
but the very environmentalist groups
that are doing this are all like weird

9574
04:33:36,441 --> 04:33:37,161
transhumanist,

9575
04:33:37,161 --> 04:33:37,994
anti human.

9576
04:33:38,120 --> 04:33:41,030
I'm all transhumanists if I
really get life extension.

9577
04:33:41,420 --> 04:33:42,370
But it's all like,

9578
04:33:42,410 --> 04:33:42,561
Oh,

9579
04:33:42,561 --> 04:33:43,200
you die,

9580
04:33:43,200 --> 04:33:44,240
your upload do have machine.

9581
04:33:44,510 --> 04:33:46,550
I'm just saying anything you,

9582
04:33:46,551 --> 04:33:48,350
she the big corporate media promoting,

9583
04:33:49,250 --> 04:33:50,720
they don't know what they're doing.

9584
04:33:50,930 --> 04:33:51,920
I've been around them.

9585
04:33:52,130 --> 04:33:53,090
I've talked to them.

9586
04:33:53,300 --> 04:33:53,931
They don't know.

9587
04:33:53,931 --> 04:33:55,190
I don't think I know.

9588
04:33:55,520 --> 04:33:56,540
I don't think Joe knows.

9589
04:33:56,541 --> 04:33:57,440
I don't think Eddie knows.

9590
04:33:57,680 --> 04:34:00,620
But I think in the spectrum
of like one to a hundred,

9591
04:34:00,800 --> 04:34:03,020
we're in the 95th percentile
of really being woke.

9592
04:34:03,320 --> 04:34:04,280
And we care about,

9593
04:34:04,430 --> 04:34:04,790
look,

9594
04:34:04,790 --> 04:34:05,630
I don't like to shake.

9595
04:34:05,900 --> 04:34:06,733
Well,

9596
04:34:06,790 --> 04:34:07,090
I mean,

9597
04:34:07,090 --> 04:34:08,390
I'll never forget like
three or four years ago,

9598
04:34:08,391 --> 04:34:10,040
remember that black home was
drive around the capitol.

9599
04:34:10,041 --> 04:34:13,580
They had military drill going and she
shot him and ran and they shot her.

9600
04:34:14,150 --> 04:34:14,990
Oh yeah.

9601
04:34:15,430 --> 04:34:15,860
And,

9602
04:34:15,860 --> 04:34:16,291
and it was,

9603
04:34:16,291 --> 04:34:20,200
you're in black lives matter like four
years ago I had like this outpouring of

9604
04:34:20,201 --> 04:34:21,530
black listers and I'm not,

9605
04:34:21,600 --> 04:34:22,640
don't judge thinks about money,

9606
04:34:22,641 --> 04:34:27,641
but like $1 million came in like a week
and it was all black people Shang we

9607
04:34:28,641 --> 04:34:30,170
thought you were against black people,

9608
04:34:30,620 --> 04:34:31,730
but when you shuck,

9609
04:34:31,731 --> 04:34:35,210
cared about that woman being shot by the,

9610
04:34:35,390 --> 04:34:37,280
by the police had a checkpoint DC.

9611
04:34:37,580 --> 04:34:38,690
We knew you were good.

9612
04:34:39,500 --> 04:34:41,390
No one knew who she was
till the day letter.

9613
04:34:41,600 --> 04:34:41,961
How did,

9614
04:34:41,961 --> 04:34:42,681
was it thinking,

9615
04:34:42,681 --> 04:34:43,850
is it a black woman?

9616
04:34:44,090 --> 04:34:45,290
Is it a white woman?

9617
04:34:45,530 --> 04:34:46,670
Is it a Hispanic woman?

9618
04:34:46,671 --> 04:34:48,400
I was taking the report.

9619
04:34:48,420 --> 04:34:51,710
She went through a checkpoint and got
scared and then the police shot her.

9620
04:34:52,100 --> 04:34:56,990
I'm not against the police either on
cops on his bed shooting a woman running

9621
04:34:56,991 --> 04:34:57,410
away.

9622
04:34:57,410 --> 04:34:59,510
It's like there's gotta be a better way.

9623
04:34:59,511 --> 04:35:00,590
You can't catch her bro.

9624
04:35:00,770 --> 04:35:00,950
No,

9625
04:35:00,950 --> 04:35:01,101
no,

9626
04:35:01,101 --> 04:35:01,490
I agree.

9627
04:35:01,490 --> 04:35:02,450
That cop was bad.

9628
04:35:02,451 --> 04:35:03,070
I think you've got to,

9629
04:35:03,070 --> 04:35:06,320
that's what I'm saying is that I'm
not some goody two shoes she doing,

9630
04:35:06,530 --> 04:35:07,280
it's running away.

9631
04:35:07,280 --> 04:35:08,031
She was just running,

9632
04:35:08,031 --> 04:35:10,730
had a military drill four or five,

9633
04:35:10,731 --> 04:35:11,564
whatever it was.

9634
04:35:11,600 --> 04:35:15,770
They had a military drill in DC where
most of the roads were shut down.

9635
04:35:16,100 --> 04:35:16,911
What was the story?

9636
04:35:16,911 --> 04:35:17,240
Jamie?

9637
04:35:17,240 --> 04:35:17,841
Can you find it?

9638
04:35:17,841 --> 04:35:21,680
The woman gets shot blonder noise shot
but for the White House somewhere.

9639
04:35:22,220 --> 04:35:24,490
How many people get shot
in this country every year?

9640
04:35:24,560 --> 04:35:27,740
Because someone just can't handle pressure
right in front of the White House.

9641
04:35:27,741 --> 04:35:30,590
About 14 trigger finger
does know what to do.

9642
04:35:30,591 --> 04:35:32,090
Just make the wrong decision.

9643
04:35:32,410 --> 04:35:33,201
It's mental illness.

9644
04:35:33,201 --> 04:35:34,820
We don't blame guns cause you use a car.

9645
04:35:35,150 --> 04:35:35,983
Yeah,

9646
04:35:36,050 --> 04:35:36,321
but,

9647
04:35:36,321 --> 04:35:39,590
but it is true that about
half of them are suicides,

9648
04:35:39,591 --> 04:35:42,320
but the rest half is like
people can't handle it.

9649
04:35:42,980 --> 04:35:43,813
And uh,

9650
04:35:44,210 --> 04:35:46,310
that was like four or five years
ago because here it is right here.

9651
04:35:46,910 --> 04:35:47,990
Capitol Hill,

9652
04:35:48,230 --> 04:35:48,861
United States,

9653
04:35:48,861 --> 04:35:49,280
uh,

9654
04:35:49,280 --> 04:35:50,950
Miriam Carey,

9655
04:35:51,120 --> 04:35:52,580
a dental hygienist from Stanford,

9656
04:35:52,581 --> 04:35:56,910
Connecticut attempted to drive through
the White House security checkpoint in

9657
04:35:56,911 --> 04:35:58,500
her black Infiniti g three,

9658
04:35:58,501 --> 04:35:59,340
seven coop.

9659
04:35:59,700 --> 04:35:59,971
Uh,

9660
04:35:59,971 --> 04:36:02,220
she struck at USC as a service officer,

9661
04:36:02,270 --> 04:36:03,150
but that's a lie.

9662
04:36:03,151 --> 04:36:03,331
Did,

9663
04:36:03,331 --> 04:36:06,330
they had the main roads and
I'll try to like anti cop,

9664
04:36:06,331 --> 04:36:07,200
black lives matter.

9665
04:36:07,230 --> 04:36:08,063
It's not treated.

9666
04:36:08,070 --> 04:36:09,240
They had all the road shut down,

9667
04:36:09,510 --> 04:36:12,120
but she was trying to drive through a
security checkpoint that could be still

9668
04:36:12,121 --> 04:36:17,121
possible that they had all the roads
shut down and the checkpoint was army and

9669
04:36:17,341 --> 04:36:19,920
then she went to another and it was
army and then they just shot her.

9670
04:36:20,070 --> 04:36:20,290
Neil,

9671
04:36:20,290 --> 04:36:20,570
they,

9672
04:36:20,570 --> 04:36:21,480
I guess the cops,

9673
04:36:22,680 --> 04:36:24,750
they shot her and she had
her daughter in the car.

9674
04:36:25,290 --> 04:36:26,070
Huh.

9675
04:36:26,070 --> 04:36:27,180
That's a horrible story.

9676
04:36:27,750 --> 04:36:28,680
I don't want to end it with that.

9677
04:36:28,710 --> 04:36:28,881
But,

9678
04:36:28,881 --> 04:36:32,070
but my point was I don't
judge things about money,

9679
04:36:32,460 --> 04:36:33,420
black people.

9680
04:36:34,050 --> 04:36:39,050
Cause that was really a big story
at the time when I came out,

9681
04:36:39,151 --> 04:36:40,200
because I'd seen the footage,

9682
04:36:40,201 --> 04:36:43,320
I was watching live and saw
him taking her head lady.

9683
04:36:43,321 --> 04:36:43,591
I said,

9684
04:36:43,591 --> 04:36:45,270
it's a black lady and,

9685
04:36:45,280 --> 04:36:45,491
and,

9686
04:36:45,491 --> 04:36:46,410
and what the hell?

9687
04:36:46,411 --> 04:36:47,190
This woman was like,

9688
04:36:47,190 --> 04:36:48,030
Eh.

9689
04:36:48,600 --> 04:36:49,201
They were like,

9690
04:36:49,201 --> 04:36:49,681
oh my God,

9691
04:36:49,681 --> 04:36:51,030
he cares about black people.

9692
04:36:51,990 --> 04:36:53,070
Yeah man,

9693
04:36:53,071 --> 04:36:54,140
I care about whatever they call it.

9694
04:36:54,141 --> 04:36:54,974
They are,

9695
04:36:55,530 --> 04:36:57,750
am I saying what was that moment?

9696
04:36:57,751 --> 04:37:00,200
And they like all just bought
product and it was like,

9697
04:37:00,201 --> 04:37:02,640
they say outpouring and
letters and flowers.

9698
04:37:02,910 --> 04:37:04,680
Like you stood up for a black woman.

9699
04:37:04,681 --> 04:37:05,041
I'm like,

9700
04:37:05,041 --> 04:37:05,874
dude,

9701
04:37:06,060 --> 04:37:09,440
half of the black people incepted
in this country are boarded.

9702
04:37:09,450 --> 04:37:10,283
Joe,

9703
04:37:12,060 --> 04:37:13,350
those planned parenthood,

9704
04:37:13,610 --> 04:37:14,550
she said a real number.

9705
04:37:14,580 --> 04:37:15,413
Yeah,

9706
04:37:15,420 --> 04:37:17,350
it's like 60% some shitty.

9707
04:37:17,700 --> 04:37:18,960
They were hired.

9708
04:37:18,961 --> 04:37:19,980
It was all shut up.

9709
04:37:20,490 --> 04:37:23,460
Margaret Sanger said we're targeting
black people and you know what?

9710
04:37:23,461 --> 04:37:27,120
The other day I see big population as
he dumb white people done black people.

9711
04:37:27,121 --> 04:37:27,870
All these B,

9712
04:37:27,870 --> 04:37:29,600
I get like there's too
many people in seminaries.

9713
04:37:29,640 --> 04:37:30,360
There are.

9714
04:37:30,360 --> 04:37:31,770
I can get to it a little
bit to the point is,

9715
04:37:31,771 --> 04:37:36,090
is that you're going to like target
black people and then tell them that you

9716
04:37:36,091 --> 04:37:36,841
care about them.

9717
04:37:36,841 --> 04:37:41,670
When you're the KKK Democrats and you've
got Margaret Sanger shut up and you're

9718
04:37:41,671 --> 04:37:42,361
doing all this,

9719
04:37:42,361 --> 04:37:43,620
and I walk out of a mall,

9720
04:37:43,860 --> 04:37:45,510
I give them all two years ago in Houston,

9721
04:37:46,260 --> 04:37:50,990
the same black Israelite group that
was yelling at a yelling at the,

9722
04:37:51,010 --> 04:37:52,680
at the Covington Catholic kid saying,

9723
04:37:52,681 --> 04:37:55,590
you're all Nazis when they attack
them or the same one they cover,

9724
04:37:55,980 --> 04:37:57,630
they're like black people.

9725
04:37:57,750 --> 04:38:02,750
Black people are God and white people
are the do and we're going to kill the

9726
04:38:03,151 --> 04:38:03,984
white people.

9727
04:38:04,620 --> 04:38:08,220
And so I'm sitting there walking out
of this mall after Trump got elected in

9728
04:38:08,230 --> 04:38:09,063
Houston.

9729
04:38:09,210 --> 04:38:09,571
I remember,

9730
04:38:09,571 --> 04:38:10,440
cause I was there with my wife,

9731
04:38:10,441 --> 04:38:12,660
she wanted like a Burberry
coat or something.

9732
04:38:13,530 --> 04:38:15,660
I was out visiting family
and these black guys go,

9733
04:38:15,661 --> 04:38:17,310
we're going to cue you.

9734
04:38:17,860 --> 04:38:19,620
I didn't hate him because
they were black guys.

9735
04:38:19,830 --> 04:38:23,010
They were literally Nazis and I remember
sitting there in that parking lot

9736
04:38:23,400 --> 04:38:24,420
walking across and I said,

9737
04:38:24,421 --> 04:38:26,550
well if you such big men heal me now,

9738
04:38:26,940 --> 04:38:27,773
and it wasn't

9739
04:38:33,030 --> 04:38:33,690
tough.

9740
04:38:33,690 --> 04:38:34,523
They're saying,

9741
04:38:35,430 --> 04:38:36,540
oh okay,

9742
04:38:36,570 --> 04:38:38,070
we got to kill your last.

9743
04:38:38,071 --> 04:38:41,020
I want to end this show on a positive
note against black people die.

9744
04:38:41,021 --> 04:38:41,551
I know you know,

9745
04:38:41,551 --> 04:38:42,410
no one's going to run in.

9746
04:38:42,411 --> 04:38:47,411
The black people are like that 1% of
10% of 1% the point is is that I've

9747
04:38:48,181 --> 04:38:49,014
literally,

9748
04:38:49,110 --> 04:38:50,010
you go to a black,

9749
04:38:50,011 --> 04:38:50,800
he was real light group.

9750
04:38:50,800 --> 04:38:51,633
Yes.

9751
04:38:51,830 --> 04:38:53,470
I wrote a story about it on my way,

9752
04:38:53,471 --> 04:38:53,980
way back in

9753
04:38:53,980 --> 04:38:55,630
the day to tell her I was
hanging out with them.

9754
04:38:56,590 --> 04:38:58,750
They were saying that George
Washington was a black man.

9755
04:38:58,751 --> 04:39:01,270
They had all this crazy
interpretation of the Bible.

9756
04:39:01,271 --> 04:39:03,040
One guy would read and
the other guy would like,

9757
04:39:03,041 --> 04:39:03,670
repeat what you

9758
04:39:03,670 --> 04:39:04,630
George Washington.

9759
04:39:06,060 --> 04:39:06,893
They were saying,

9760
04:39:07,050 --> 04:39:07,883
they,

9761
04:39:07,940 --> 04:39:08,500
I'm saying,

9762
04:39:08,500 --> 04:39:09,333
I'm going to kill you

9763
04:39:09,620 --> 04:39:10,580
like superheroes.

9764
04:39:10,760 --> 04:39:12,620
It's a very unusual organization.

9765
04:39:12,680 --> 04:39:13,160
Whoa.

9766
04:39:13,160 --> 04:39:13,780
Yeah.

9767
04:39:13,780 --> 04:39:14,620
Everybody was blown.

9768
04:39:14,750 --> 04:39:16,430
I wasn't putting down blown
and I know you weren't.

9769
04:39:16,431 --> 04:39:17,264
I know you weren't there.

9770
04:39:17,320 --> 04:39:18,153
The He,

9771
04:39:18,200 --> 04:39:19,550
you know his take on it.

9772
04:39:19,551 --> 04:39:19,731
I mean,

9773
04:39:19,731 --> 04:39:21,080
I don't think it's a unified front.

9774
04:39:21,230 --> 04:39:24,680
I don't think all black Israelites across
the country have the exact same ideas.

9775
04:39:26,620 --> 04:39:27,453
Keep breathing.

9776
04:39:30,080 --> 04:39:30,913
We got to end this.

9777
04:39:31,210 --> 04:39:32,320
It's almost five o'clock.

9778
04:39:33,620 --> 04:39:34,660
I'm gonna say five hours.

9779
04:39:34,661 --> 04:39:35,494
Yes.

9780
04:39:37,720 --> 04:39:38,553
Don't hit anybody.

9781
04:39:38,590 --> 04:39:39,423
Let's be friends.

9782
04:39:39,640 --> 04:39:40,690
Eddie Bravo.

9783
04:39:40,720 --> 04:39:40,990
Uh,

9784
04:39:40,990 --> 04:39:41,950
thanks for coming in man.

9785
04:39:42,670 --> 04:39:43,670
Keeping this thing like

9786
04:39:45,670 --> 04:39:49,690
info wars.com and news wars.com
they blocked the everywhere else.

9787
04:39:49,900 --> 04:39:50,890
It is the verboten.

9788
04:39:50,891 --> 04:39:51,380
And you have a,

9789
04:39:51,380 --> 04:39:52,540
you have an Instagram page though.

9790
04:39:52,630 --> 04:39:53,400
You do have an this.

9791
04:39:53,400 --> 04:39:53,570
Well,

9792
04:39:53,570 --> 04:39:54,810
don't plug it a little bag.

9793
04:39:56,750 --> 04:39:56,950
Hey,

9794
04:39:56,950 --> 04:39:58,240
they're picking everybody's free speech.

9795
04:39:58,480 --> 04:39:59,230
We got,

9796
04:39:59,230 --> 04:40:01,180
whether I agree with the white
supremacists or the black supremacists,

9797
04:40:01,181 --> 04:40:04,210
I don't whether I agree with the sign
intolerably although the buzzer looms,

9798
04:40:04,450 --> 04:40:07,840
the plot is we should agree with free
speech and say no to this and not have

9799
04:40:07,841 --> 04:40:11,440
some sell out to Shyna
where Chris to go to China,

9800
04:40:11,441 --> 04:40:12,850

9801
04:40:12,851 --> 04:40:13,684
Here,

9802
04:40:13,930 --> 04:40:14,501

9803
