1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
Is it a battle between the human 
retarded monkey chimpanzee behavior of 

2
00:00:03,581 --> 00:00:04,001
take,
take,

3
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:04,834
take.
The theory I believe was formulated 

4
00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:09,850
before they realize how many monkeys 
chimpanzees eat.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,160
What chimps attack.
People that go for your balls.

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,700
That's one of the number one things they
do.

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,900
They try to eat.
Your Genitalia isn't a weird now that we

8
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:19,420
know so much about chimpanzees,
like some kid,

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,433
that student in Africa just gotTa 
fucking testicle ripped off to picture 

10
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:27,430
that chimp clamping down on my scrotum 
with his teeth.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,040
That gets me through the last four or 
five Reps.

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,350
I saw this picture of a chimp,
carrie and fruit,

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,720
and I looked at him like,
holy fuck.

14
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:37,210
There's that fucking gorilla that 
they've chimpanzee.

15
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:39,750
They've recently discovered in the cargo
just muscle,

16
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:40,584
gigantic.
You know how fucking crazy it must've 

17
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,880
been the first time they discovered a 
Gabriella,

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,440
you know they're walking into what else 
is here?

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,350
John Welders and the size of your hand,
Fred,

20
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,450
give me the machete.
Was hacked through some.

21
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,760
What the fuck is that like a regular 
chimpanzees?

22
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:59,230
Fuck each other up.
They kill each other,

23
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,760
but.
But nobody really.

24
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,620
They mostly solve their issues through 
sex.

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,810
Say you know how you saw your poop on 
you.

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,400
You can't hold a chimp bitch and check.
Those bitches are freaks.

27
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:13,870
Brutal.
Talk about chimps every week.

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,030
Might not like.
This is probably the most.

29
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,600
No,
I mean it.

30
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,830
When's the last time you talked about 
trump's with me?

31
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,220
All the time.
You do talk about podcast episode.

32
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,480
People are laughing right now.
Waiting.

33
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,770
Gentleman.
Black helicopters have been spotted.

34
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,590
I don't know if you know that he's a way
better athlete than you,

35
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:38,280
but it doesn't mean that we put up in 
that,

36
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,440
so it doesn't mean that to me that he'll
automatically.

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,070
You burned a thousand calories.
Is there some sort of.

38
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,160
I talked to Pat McAfee one time,
he said it's about exclusivity.

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,540
It's about rape and murder.
My head's filled with it.

40
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,010
Stopping rapists and stop and murderers 
and killing child molesters.

41
00:01:58,011 --> 00:02:00,040
That's what I think about that Mickey 
Mantle Gene.

42
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,440
That's Lou Gehrig's disease.
I'm trying to break burt's will.

43
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,550
That's what I'm really trying to do.
Talks all this Mickey Mantle Gene Shit.

44
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:13,384
I'm like,
motherfucker,

45
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,500
I'm crazy.

46
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,690
Fire alarm.

47
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,650
Up until two days ago,
everything seemed to be going good,

48
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,513
but I started being an exert,
coming out dark today I had to go to 

49
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:39,710
something in my kids' school and I had 
to go up three flights of stairs.

50
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,693
I got to the top.
I was out of breath and my legs were 

51
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:44,720
shaking and I was like,
okay,

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,980
I might have fucked something up.
Felt so bad.

53
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,560
Okay.
I would like to ladies and gentlemen,

54
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,550
for this artist,
you feel present to you,

55
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,430
Joe Rogan,
this belt

56
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,560
sign.
You are the champion of sober October.

57
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,230
Qre huge shocker.
You're in better shape than the three of

58
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:11,290
us.
I think that had a factor,

59
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,410
but it's ultimately is about trt.
Is that tight enough or not even that?

60
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,190
Mickey Mann Will Jean.
Thank you.

61
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,210
He didn't say anything to.
I want to say this is Sandy Kofax.

62
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:25,000
Jean,
I want to say Mickey Mantle.

63
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,820
Gene.
Do you see a song mythologist thing?

64
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,120
What did you.
Did you play that back?

65
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,100
Do you see him?
Saw montage juice thing.

66
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,980
You guys did some mileage.
You'd get anxiety.

67
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:47,800
Like check the APP.
See where everybody's scores that shit.

68
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,360
Fuck,
you know,

69
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,293
you need,
you need,

70
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,173
you can do that.
You weren't competing against Bert 

71
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,650
Kreischer,
Ari Shaffir and Tom's Gora.

72
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,410
So let's take it easy.
No,

73
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,280
I'm not saying still.
You know what I mean?

74
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,243
Like my competition.
Those guys post the last guy 

75
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,700
competitiveness.

76
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,593
Oh,
this a mud rats out there that have no 

77
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:15,820
jeans almost.
I feel like like mud wrap.

78
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,673
Humans,
just people that are just smoking their 

79
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:21,520
own dicks out there who have no real 
life.

80
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,301
Like,
you know what I'm saying?

81
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:25,120
Like I've met some people who yeah,
they're breathing,

82
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:25,954
but that's it really.
I used to live with these rich people 

83
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:28,924
for awhile.
The Dad used to masturbate at night and 

84
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,624
I would sneak out there in the kitchen.
This is back when the family had like a 

85
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,600
family computer.
You know what?

86
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,130
It was in one part of the house.
Right.

87
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,100
And he's over there just in the glow of 
that screen,

88
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:39,934
Bro.
And that's back when the monitors were 

89
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:41,621
big,
you know?

90
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:44,410
And he's just over there just fucking 
looking for the devil.

91
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,860
And he ended up getting divorced and it 
was,

92
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:48,694
I think a lot of it was because of that.
Was she annoying first and he started 

93
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:55,450
beating off or was he.
Had He beat the devil?

94
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,703
I think he had a pit of it in him.
The worst is if you're jerking off with 

95
00:04:59,021 --> 00:04:59,920
a hat on,
bro,

96
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,263
you're going to hell.
I think the best would be one of those 

97
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:07,630
Chinese hats broke because if you squat 
down low enough to the ground,

98
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:12,631
you can almost hide under it and you're 
the most confusing.

99
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,470
It would be like one of them.
Daniel Boone.

100
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:19,471
Raccoon tail.
You pushed it.

101
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,810
Scared the fuck out of my way with its 
tail do.

102
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,450
When I was growing up,
we couldn't even get point.

103
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:32,100
We had to get this dude nick on Friday 
withdraws a pinterest and pussy,

104
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:34,930
you know,
cross for the weekend for dollar to this

105
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:37,930
dude nick for dollars for drawings,
Bro.

106
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,853
You'd pay eight dude.
And we come back on Monday and people 

107
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:46,060
would have like these fucking busted ass
looking all sketches reign on him.

108
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:46,901
He was like,
oh,

109
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:49,050
this is what got rain on it.
No workers.

110
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,490
The white people that wish they were 
blocked.

111
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,860
It's a totally different thing.
Yeah,

112
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,813
yeah,
yeah.

113
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,993
We had the first one at our school 
growing up and they put them in a 

114
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,660
learning disabled class.
That's.

115
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:00,920
How crazy is that?
Yeah.

116
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,200
You guys are the first one ever.
I doubt it.

117
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:08,030
We had one of the first 60 or 70.
This was probably 1992,

118
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,013
but he was always dribbling it invisible
basketball and they put him in class 

119
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,870
with the mentally handicapped kids.
He was against whites.

120
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,733
That was the thing.
Fuck all these white people and when he 

121
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:20,870
was white they're like,
this is.

122
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,670
And I get it and I was making like a 
nice smoothie and I'm fucking coked up.

123
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:26,750
I'm partying,
you know,

124
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,630
living high on the hog to vests on 
maybe.

125
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,464
Right.
And I thought,

126
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,990
I thought I heard something outside.
Right.

127
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:36,380
Which is kind of weird to even think of 
when you have a blender going.

128
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:37,214
Right?
So I'll leave out of my apartment to go 

129
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:39,254
in the hallway,
lock myself out with the blender going 

130
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,940
during in the morning,
coked up out of my brain.

131
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,123
I have to go to my landlord,
the blender shorts out and smoke 

132
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:51,194
happens.
The fire alarm starts going off in the 

133
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:54,524
building,
right as I'm at his door knocking right 

134
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,190
now.
He's pissed and he's like,

135
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:00,770
what's going on?
And I didn't know what to say.

136
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:04,370
I told them that I was throwing a late 
Christmas party.

137
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:08,090
Dude,
it was fucking into January.

138
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,950
I will with you at the time.
Huh?

139
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,350
Oh,
this is two and a half years ago.

140
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,690
So 30,
35.

141
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,550
So he comes back to my apartment,
right?

142
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:19,970
He's,
he unlocks the door.

143
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,360
There's nobody in there,
dude.

144
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,590
I talked to your buddy,
Eddie Bravo.

145
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:30,200
And that guy is a real.
He's out there.

146
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,550
He's like a,
he's like a death,

147
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,473
like a death Jack Russell almost,
you know a deaf Jack Russell because 

148
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:36,710
once he gets going you can't.
Oh,

149
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:38,870
Jack Russell terrier.
You ever been around with the dog?

150
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:40,520
You open the car and then next thing you
know they're like,

151
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,990
yeah,
they're like sick.

152
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:43,400
Yeah,
but how's he depth?

153
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,040
Because you can't get them back.
Like once he goes,

154
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,430
you can't say you can't get them back in
the car.

155
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,610
Like you're sitting there honking the 
horn.

156
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:56,780
You can't that guys out.
There are other cool dogs.

157
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,550
Isn't Jack Russell?

158
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,430
That's the coolest one.
That's just fucking insane.

159
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,900
That's insane.
That's bribery.

160
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,570
That's.
Are you saying that it's worth $200,000?

161
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,080
If she sucked every Dick in the room,
it wouldn't be worth $200,000.

162
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,670
Right?
There's no way.

163
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,530
Who's going to pay a thousand dollars 
for Hillary Clinton,

164
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:16,040
Bro?
Job.

165
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,873
Other than for the story.
I think she can get a lot of money for 

166
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:24,401
blowjobs using so fucking old.
Right guys with this fucking down.

167
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,070
Plus the Devin boot.
Cockies.

168
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,090
You know what I mean to you do.
Oh,

169
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:29,963
you do the copy for this.
I feel it just feels like a 

170
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,270
disrespectful turn we're taking with 
Hillary.

171
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,183
You don't think they put her in there 
for a reason because she don't give a 

172
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:42,300
fuck.
So I think they,

173
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,220
they want controversy.
Do you want people to get used to fucked

174
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,080
up decisions?
We're used to it.

175
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,450
That's.
Yeah,

176
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,673
I think they.
They want that because if they ever 

177
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:55,410
needed to pull something out like 
something was like,

178
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,190
dude,
this motherfucker

179
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,200
has to.
When people are like,

180
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,310
Oh,
it is vegas.

181
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,200
There's a conspiracy theory that Hillary
Clinton's father,

182
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:05,070
Hugh Ross,
Adam,

183
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,560
I,
I'm assuming he's,

184
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:11,590
he's not alive anymore,
but he was a huge Jewish mob boss who is

185
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:16,860
responsible for opium going into 
Chicago.

186
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,680
I don't know if that's real,
but it makes sense to me.

187
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,140
I mean,
no one is ever before,

188
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,130
so no one has ever been.
Is that him right there?

189
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,730
Oh,
he doesn't look like you fits in,

190
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,290
does he?
How?

191
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,183
No one has ever been that guy.
I bet he went home with me when they 

192
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:34,470
first.
Oh my God,

193
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,520
there was nothing like that before that.
That's a phd.

194
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,060
People say that.
That was all staged.

195
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,963
No screaming box saying that did 
bieber's or fake and I'll send you a 

196
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,280
link.
You know,

197
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,410
I sent you that one email that one guy 
was telling me that he worked for a team

198
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:53,244
of scientists and they're working for 
pesticide company and they're told to 

199
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:59,340
the goal are we're going to do some 
studies here and we want it to look like

200
00:09:59,341 --> 00:09:59,790
this.

201
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,200
It seems like there's basically in a 
nutshell like three kinds of science.

202
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:06,300
There's,
there's the sign like pseudo science.

203
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:09,120
It's like pretend science,
but for sure it's not real.

204
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:10,710
It's false science.
Pseudo science,

205
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,783
and then there's the scientific facts 
like for sure it's not like it's a 

206
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:18,060
scientific fact that I can get on the 
Internet with my iphone.

207
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,280
I don't need to read a study about it 
and say,

208
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:23,490
oh actually can I know it?
My friends know it.

209
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,410
And then there's the science that you,
you,

210
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,373
you have to take the scientist word for 
it because there's no way that you can 

211
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,600
verify that if you have to take.
You have to have faith in science.

212
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:35,540
That's like a religion.
But scientism,

213
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,170
hold on a second.
What are you talking about?

214
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,480
Like what particular kind of any kind of
science,

215
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:40,314
whether it's a medical science,
if you have a choice to believe in 

216
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,790
science that you can't verify yourself,
you could believe it,

217
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,953
but you don't have to believe,
but you could say the experts in the 

218
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:51,540
field verify it.

219
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,340
All the people who understood with all 
the that we,

220
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,190
all the science that we know that had 
been,

221
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:57,720
has been corrupted.
Just the big ones.

222
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,360
A sugar science,
uh,

223
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,200
tobacco science,
marijuana,

224
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,540
science,
vaccines,

225
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,770
signs.
We know for sure all,

226
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:08,670
just those four that there's been a lot 
of corruption and so it's hard to trust.

227
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,310
So when someone comes out and especially
the government and NGOs,

228
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,630
yeah,
our scientists,

229
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,550
scientists say that it's safe and 
effective.

230
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,110
You got to be like,
damn,

231
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,870
I don't know about that.
I'm not gonna.

232
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,100
Just take your word for it.
You know what I mean?

233
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:20,934
You guys are criminals.
You're John Gotti and you guys are 

234
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:23,304
saying,
you guys are saying that this is safe 

235
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:26,250
and effective.
I don't know about that.

236
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,630
You know,
maybe it is.

237
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:28,464
I hope it is,
but I don't know if you've watched the 

238
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:31,464
videos of old nuclear test site,
which soldiers running towards the 

239
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,030
blast.
Yeah,

240
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,910
I've seen those.
Yeah,

241
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,430
it looks like it looks like,
I don't know,

242
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,930
just like all that old footage looks 
like it doesn't look authentic.

243
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:45,700
It looks like they faked all that shit,
but I dunno.

244
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,240
I'm,
I'm to retard nuclear bombs.

245
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,180
Is that what you're saying to me?
I,

246
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:54,320
you know,
there a conspiracy theory that uh,

247
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,840
um,
at,

248
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,060
at nuclear bombs actually don't exist,
that they never actually figured it out,

249
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,940
but they realized that the threat of 
nuclear bombs is good enough because the

250
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,160
editor,
you can see the bottom.

251
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,320
But how do you know by seeing them that 
they're.

252
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,760
But all I'm saying is how do you know it
wasn't just a regular powerful bomb,

253
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:13,594
like how do you know?
How do you know by watching a bomb go 

254
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:16,174
off?
How do you know what's nuclear nuclear 

255
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,770
nuclear bomb looks like when it blows 
up?

256
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,480
I don't know.
I don't know.

257
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,110
How do you know if that's what kind of 
bomb that that is the craziest amount of

258
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:29,400
power you could ever imagine?
I do.

259
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,300
You understand?
It could be a nuclear bomb.

260
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:34,500
I'm saying all I'm saying.
How can you know for sure?

261
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,343
Look at them.
What you said before the podcast was so 

262
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:37,354
funny about the apocalypse that homeless
people are going to be psyched because 

263
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:45,520
it'd be like homeless people are waiting
for the end of the world.

264
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,640
They're taking them because they're 
going to be running shit.

265
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,620
They're going to be because they know 
what they're doing.

266
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,410
They know bots and shit and they will 
know exactly.

267
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,230
Not going to change their life.
It might get better.

268
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,210
What's going to get crowds in favelas?
If you live in a favela,

269
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,083
you don't have to worry about them in 
the world because it's already the end 

270
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:03,850
of the world for you.
You know what I mean?

271
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,990
Sorry about the nuclear war.
Sorry.

272
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,643
I thought you made some good sponsor 
real and we're live with Joey Coco Diaz 

273
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,200
and one of the baddest motherfuckers on 
the planet.

274
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:18,070
Yo El Ramiro.
Thank you so much.

275
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,400
You got a good grasp of English.
Pretty good.

276
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,443
Joe is going to help fill in the blanks 
and we'll be able to have some good 

277
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:26,734
communication here.

278
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,440
No,
no.

279
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,390
And this club he was in was in the 
second division,

280
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,433
you know,
he ain't got a clue that Luciano and 

281
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,920
glue glue know.
No.

282
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,623
So he started training the fucking 
fighters and the club one and they got 

283
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:47,790
up to division one when she started 
training.

284
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,723
Training.
Wrestling.

285
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,870
Yeah.
And,

286
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,580
and don't say Quando man.
Yeah man.

287
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,420
I hate when they call them for his MMA 
fight.

288
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,100
You said fuck it.
I'll go down there near the 18 years.

289
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,020
Heavyweight.
Then the heavyweights.

290
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Eighteen year old heavyweights handbook 
can pounds.

291
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,910
Ain't going to tell a hundred pounds on 
the bench press.

292
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,430
I will let the kid he ever been.
Daniel.

293
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,020
I bought these trainers that they have 
are fucking top notch.

294
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,710
There's a ton of Santa Maria in La.
Really?

295
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,840
I don't deal with it at all because it's
all the same thing.

296
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:30,260
Like everything else in that light.
It's a bunch of white people didn't grow

297
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:34,340
up in it and it was a hot black guy and 
they want to really just suck this day.

298
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,580
Talk about spirits.
I saw a video today,

299
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,140
video.
I'm like,

300
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,450
shame on them.
It's all confused.

301
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:44,240
It's like those white chicks that suck 
that hip do dick.

302
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:47,410
When they go to hot yoga,
bikram,

303
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,860
big a pig.
We got a bunch of white with Hummus.

304
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:56,861
Flavor in your mouth that he gets to me 
inside.

305
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:02,270
He you suck that fucking dead.
That smells like hummus chips,

306
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,290
but it's who we're supposed to be in a 
way as a comedian.

307
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,360
What's supposed to be the social column?

308
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,400
Oh,
society in a way.

309
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,683
In some way.
So now you want to take that away from 

310
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:19,530
me.
You want to take the way.

311
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:22,080
I can't say I grew up on the word 
retarded.

312
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,190
I grew up on the word faggot.
I grew up on the word.

313
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,024
I grew up on a lot of words that people 
don't accept today and I'm very sorry 

314
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,183
that you don't accept them,
but it's too late for me to change my 

315
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:37,530
game right now.
Yeah,

316
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:40,110
I'll try.
My hardest and I try my hardest.

317
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,540
I'm still gonna say tranny from time to 
time.

318
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,210
I know it offends.
I'm here to tell you how I see it.

319
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,553
I see it.
This is how I said if I offended you 

320
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,940
might offend you.
That was the mind.

321
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,490
Yeah.

322
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,323
Yeah.
Our paper that rewrote my income was 

323
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:58,520
about allyship and they were like,
yeah.

324
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:00,380
We had two of them that did mountain 
comp.

325
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:01,214
One of them we just more or less 
replaced whites would replace Jews with 

326
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:06,100
white men.
I mean,

327
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:06,963
so would that one.
What we did was we took the whole 

328
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,730
document on online and we just searched 
the word Jew and we just started picking

329
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:14,564
sentences and paragraphs.
So what was it that at the end it was 

330
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:20,600
something like,
if we don't combat whiteness,

331
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:22,670
it's going to be the funeral wreath for 
mankind.

332
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,960
This is why I've been telling people 
clean up your room.

333
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,471
It's like,
well,

334
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:28,304
your room is actually network to.
It's not that easy to clean up your 

335
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:31,190
room,
you know,

336
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,053
because maybe part of it is,
is that like everything around you is 

337
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:38,690
full of potential.
Everything maybe more potential than you

338
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:39,524
could ever possibly utilize and so maybe
all you have is this little rat hole of 

339
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:44,540
a room and some rundown place in the 
world.

340
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,440
It's like fix it up.
There's more there than you think.

341
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,840
They devalued what they have right in 
front of them.

342
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,883
Like another.
Another client I worked with was having 

343
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:57,680
a hard time putting his kid to bed at 
night and so we did the arithmetic.

344
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:58,514
It's like,
well,

345
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,503
I'm fighting with my kid for 45 minutes 
a night trying to get him to go to bed 

346
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,970
seven days a week,
45 minutes a day.

347
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:07,790
Let's call that five hours.
Twenty hours a week,

348
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,960
240 hours in a year.
It's six years.

349
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:11,794
Spending a month and a half of work 
weeks fighting with your four year old 

350
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:15,440
son.
I think you're going to like them.

351
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,323
You don't like anyone.
You spend a month and a half a year 

352
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,990
fighting with.
It's a bad idea.

353
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,000
Fix it.
Your life isn't.

354
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:28,060
Margarita is on a beach and in Jamaica 
your life is how your wife greets you at

355
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:30,830
the door.
When you come home every day,

356
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,990
you get those mundane things,
right.

357
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,853
Those things you do every day,
you concentrate on them and you make 

358
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:36,704
them pristine.
It's like you got 80 percent of your 

359
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,590
life put together.
Well,

360
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:43,010
you have some crazy tweets for sure.
I don't think they're crazy.

361
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,750
You just don't get 'em.

362
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,860
All right.
We have breaking news,

363
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:50,820
ABC News,

364
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,960
ABC,
I should say.

365
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,680
Just releasing a statement.
What is ABC say?

366
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,253
ABC is just a suit,
a stunning statement and Wolf that says 

367
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,104
the show has been canceled.
ABC canceling the revival after Bar 

368
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:05,200
tweeted this about former president 
Obama's advisor,

369
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:08,020
Valerie Jarrett.
She tweeted that Valerie Jarrett,

370
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,113
who was black,
was the daughter of the Muslim 

371
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,440
Brotherhood and planet of the Apes.
We were at home in Salt Lake City.

372
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:19,441
When I tweeted at 2:11 AM,
I just woke up and I had this thought in

373
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,100
my head,
oh my God,

374
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:21,934
this can make so much sense.
And then I tweeted it and I went right 

375
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:28,650
back to sleep and when I woke up at 
seven,

376
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,190
the shit had hit the fan,
you know?

377
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,750
Yeah.
But I was like,

378
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:34,690
I'm going to expound on this later.
That was one of those kinds of things,

379
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:36,820
right?
You just want to get it down.

380
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:37,990
And I,
you know,

381
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,050
always slept with my computer and tweet 
when I wake up,

382
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:43,360
like one year old,
you have to go to the bathroom a lot.

383
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,070
So I always tweet and fall back to 
sleep.

384
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,520
And then on the ambient tweets,
my daughter,

385
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:50,710
I used to always,
when I took my Ambien,

386
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:52,840
I called my daughter and she or she 
called me.

387
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:53,710
She goes,
mom,

388
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:55,780
you get,
you're starting to do the Ambien tweets.

389
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,730
Get off,
get off the twitter,

390
00:18:57,731 --> 00:18:59,210
you know.
But uh,

391
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,990
so I just called my daughter.
Then every night when I,

392
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,720
when I was doing the Ambien and uh,
I'd go,

393
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:06,770
you know what,
here comes the big fish.

394
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:10,210
She recorded it.
Here comes the big fish right through my

395
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:13,510
window.
All he's getting stuck in the mirror.

396
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,290
That's what she goes.
Mom turned it all off and go to sleep.

397
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,980
Susan Rice is a man with big swinging 
eight balls.

398
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:24,883
But wasn't there another tweet that you 
made a long time ago about who was that 

399
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:31,440
other woman?
Susan Rice?

400
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:32,330
Yes.
Yeah.

401
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,210
What you said she has giant swing eight 
balls that she's a man.

402
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Let me explain that now because this is 
the regional listic regionalism.

403
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,470
I'm from Utah and all the girls in Utah 
when we got married and are we heard our

404
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:51,060
moms do it too.
It's always,

405
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:52,950
where's your ape?
They go,

406
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:55,470
what?
You're doing this Sunday it.

407
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,191
And he's like,
oh,

408
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:57,690
he's watching football.
All good.

409
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:59,760
Let's go out to lunch.
You know it all.

410
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:04,350
All of the men were all apes.
That's how it is in a breeder culture,

411
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:06,780
like Salt Lake City,
breeder culture,

412
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,350
Caribbean culture.
So it's like,

413
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,210
where's your ape?
And there's like,

414
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,044
man,
you're a peasant big fucking swing and 

415
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:16,260
eight balls.
I give them that.

416
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,290
You know,
it's a regional logistic thing.

417
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,693
And my point is that this lonely two 
things over the course of thousands of 

418
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,810
don't mess my point.
I said,

419
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:31,200
Susan Rice,
let's say that she has.

420
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,500
She has incredible audacity.
That's what I meant as she does.

421
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,483
And you know,
I'm not going to bow down before them 

422
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,410
and say you were right and they want me 
to,

423
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,060
but they weren't right.
I'm right.

424
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:48,380
I wrote it bitch,
bitch.

425
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,490
So I know what I meant.
So you don't fucking get to tell me what

426
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:53,390
I meant.
Here's my impression of Mel Gibson.

427
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,793
He was a,
he just kept clicking the pen and I 

428
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:01,890
will,
I didn't want to say anything.

429
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:02,760
I was like,
what do I say?

430
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,910
PNF One of the commanders of the immune 
system that says,

431
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:07,080
hey,
let's,

432
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,510
let's cause a bunch of inflammation and 
make you miserable.

433
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,370
And so the,
the,

434
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,500
these,
and another molecule similar,

435
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:18,240
similar to it decreased by 50 percent 
and that decreased persisted.

436
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,730
But it's a um,
uh,

437
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,850
I don't have that stuff now.
And I don't know if I can attribute that

438
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:26,844
to the cells,
but I got a bunch of cells like twice 

439
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,780
and that went away.
Now I talk about that for a minute.

440
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,380
Does that sort of a look a little harder
at it?

441
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,750
And it's a mystery to me why it isn't 
the case.

442
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:40,620
But you know,
hey,

443
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,950
if there are places where one can go and
get some help,

444
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,650
it sounds like the old spook around the 
corner.

445
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,170
Good for moles,
holes and pimples on.

446
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,420
But it's a vibe.

447
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,670
Incredible.

448
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,293
It is a button.
You press mute or you don't have one of 

449
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:57,601
these?
No,

450
00:21:57,601 --> 00:21:58,051
I don't.
Yes,

451
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,350
you do.
I definitely do.

452
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,410
You do now?
I definitely don't give no.

453
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,700
Fuck.
Snorted so much.

454
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:11,610
Coke and speed.
Oops.

455
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,130
Didn't mean to do that.
You're fucking monumental.

456
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,470
I love you man.
Love is getting weird.

457
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,953
I'm just fucking with your truth.
So you're into telling me about this 

458
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:22,410
fucking shoulder shit.
Why are you so big?

459
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,080
Wrestling and stuff.
Good.

460
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:28,020
Googly Mowgli.
How fucking awesome is Steven Tyler?

461
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,750
He's a trip.
He's actually still here.

462
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,090
I don't think he wants to lead.
He's been.

463
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,790
He's hanging around in our lobby staring
at the Werewolf,

464
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,773
said he wants one.

465
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,790
We went into the war thing and I go,
I don't know anything about war.

466
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,230
I'm A.
I'm a guitar player,

467
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:42,064
but I went down for my draft physical 
and when I went into the booth to give 

468
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,580
my urine sample,
I made sure I ate Mexican food all week,

469
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:49,414
so instead of pissing in the Urine Cup,
I took a big dump in it was green and 

470
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:53,350
went all over the place and the guy 
went.

471
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,130
Wow.
Really?

472
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,390
Yeah.
Really.

473
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,900
And so I made up the story for High 
Times magazine,

474
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:05,710
you know,
the great magazine of good information.

475
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,903
And uh,
the Ted Hating liberal press started 

476
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:11,344
quoting the high times magazine and 
quoting an ex girlfriend who claimed 

477
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:21,961
that I had adopted her,
that I had adopted my girlfriend to have

478
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:24,440
you read that one?
I did read that one.

479
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:27,350
I forgot about it.
So this kind of stuff,

480
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,770
like you adopted her so you could take 
her on tour with,

481
00:23:30,771 --> 00:23:32,420
you know,
so I could fuck her.

482
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,200
That's what the story was.
But that's APP.

483
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,480
Absolutely.
It works.

484
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,343
That's not how I think.
It makes it easier to talk to them once 

485
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:43,430
you adopt them.
I didn't adopt anybody.

486
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:48,440
I've never shit pants since I was,
I think eight months old.

487
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:49,643
Um,
I've never been with an underage girl 

488
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:53,930
since I was under age.
I'm not a racist.

489
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:54,860
And what else do they say?
Oh,

490
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:55,694
and they saved that.
They claim that I made Courtney love 

491
00:23:57,411 --> 00:23:59,930
blow me when she was 12.
I think she claimed that.

492
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,970
Yeah,
I never met Courtney love.

493
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:02,804
You can tell.
I don't have a rash of you just got to 

494
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,440
be kidding me

495
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,543
with me.
It made it even worse because I've got 

496
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:12,830
to drag that fucking snake everywhere.
80 pound box of shit.

497
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,173
Be like currently.
Carry this around with a bad back over 

498
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:17,660
there.
Hey folks out there.

499
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:18,770
Pray for him,
man.

500
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,630
He over there who and moving back.
He's making fun of young Jamie and Jamie

501
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,953
is a minor in French.
It's very difficult to talk about 

502
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,720
injuries when you were on Jake,
the snake and when I'm going to bring it

503
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:31,360
up,
totally threw me under the bus.

504
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,920
He told me before when I first got here,
he's like,

505
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:34,754
I pulled my back the other day,
but I don't want to mention it in front 

506
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:37,671
of Jake.
The snake,

507
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:39,800
because it's embarrassing.
Shouldn't be embarrassed.

508
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,280
He didn't.
He,

509
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,470
he torres,
Torres,

510
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,313
man Angina and that's,
that's the beauty of it because you 

511
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:50,400
could get somebody like a nimble nuts 
over here with a sprain sprain.

512
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,243
Men,
Joanna.

513
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:57,080
Joanna is warped out of shape.
He can't help himself.

514
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,390
God,
it's like the snake,

515
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:03,380
when it tries to find the Japanese,
he just likes playing with round things.

516
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:06,310
You'll there doesn't even the knobs you,
he's stroking the knobs

517
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:12,110
you want to be for the fight came like 
you do on the use side of drug testing.

518
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,603
A was walking back through the hallway 
with her official and she crossed paths 

519
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:19,074
with you,
Ana and all by herself and you wanna go 

520
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:22,260
ahead.

521
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,670
Negative.
You know,

522
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,680
when she gave him what's up and then she
was like,

523
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:30,120
I'm just like officially asked me 
something like as you buy the ticket,

524
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,410
or.
I was like,

525
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,400
what do you believe him or do you 
believe in them or something like that.

526
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,200
Do you believe him?
Did you buy the ticket?

527
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,090
And then she walked off.

528
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,270
By the way,
like in a moment,

529
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,740
something inside of me.
I was like,

530
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,470
I don't know what she's talking about,
but just gave her the thumbs up like,

531
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,071
yeah,
mother fucker.

532
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:46,904
I believe in him.

533
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,160
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah.

534
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:58,963
A few years ago

535
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,270
I drove my car on the street.
Then Montreal,

536
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,400
it's second in the evening.
I say,

537
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:07,780
I told a guy coming at me and he asked 
for you beg for money.

538
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,670
I put down my window.
This guy swears.

539
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,803
It's true.
Story is that guy that used to bully me 

540
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:17,950
in school.
I say,

541
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,810
I don't want to say his name,
and I said,

542
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:20,471
hey,
wait a second.

543
00:26:20,471 --> 00:26:23,200
I parked my name at Park my car,
park the car,

544
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,450
go talk to him as he said,
what the Hell you doing here?

545
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:29,020
Man is like you.
Is that?

546
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:29,711
Yeah,
I know,

547
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:31,570
but things doesn't go well for me,
you know?

548
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:36,190
I'm like,
I all right is a good man.

549
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:37,790
You're a tall guy.
You're good looking as like,

550
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:41,650
what you doing here man?
It's like I give him what I have left on

551
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:42,190
me.
You know,

552
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,023
like,
I don't remember like I got a hundred 

553
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:44,280
something

554
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,090
or when I met him that way we talk about
like,

555
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,953
it feels so good just to meet them in 
the street and make kind of a piece and 

556
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:52,470
give him money.
Like,

557
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:53,370
yeah,
you beat me up,

558
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:54,690
you didn't,
but you know what?

559
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,553
Even though you did that,
I give you the money and now he made me 

560
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:02,850
feel like I'm kind of a revenge.
Better than a revenge.

561
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:04,100
You make me feel like,
yeah man,

562
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,440
you see without me,
you wouldn't have nothing maybe to sleep

563
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:09,690
or eat tonight,
so I give it to you.

564
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:11,640
I still give it to you if you do that to
me.

565
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,320
That make me feel much better than if I 
would like beat them up.

566
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,210
Yeah.

567
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,043
I can feel tears running down my face.
My chest was wet with tears because I 

568
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:27,350
knew I couldn't do on my own.
Almost impossible for me because I tried

569
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:29,700
and tried and tried and ended up back in
Nepal,

570
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,600
back drinking.
I almost accepted that that was going to

571
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,443
be my fate and I'll call it.
So I was on my knees in his bedroom 

572
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,603
after praying for about 10 minutes,
I got up and I felt the weight of the 

573
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:48,280
world was lifted off my shoulders.
Um,

574
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,363
for the first time in years I knew it 
was going to make a comeback and I 

575
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:55,950
called me wife has a parish parishes,
so bought she followed,

576
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,970
was drunk coming home from the pope.
I said,

577
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,073
Monday morning I start to regain mission
to try and get the heavyweight 

578
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,730
championship of the oil buck.
She said,

579
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:05,091
yeah,
yeah,

580
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:06,740
yeah.
Because before this,

581
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,103
every time I'd have a beer,
I'd come back and I'm going to be the 

582
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,390
heavyweight champion of the world again 
because it was,

583
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,450
it was the alcohol talking.
But even when I speak to her now,

584
00:28:14,451 --> 00:28:15,284
she says,
no,

585
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,280
you told me that.
She said,

586
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,930
I hear a difference in your voice 
swimming cap.

587
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:24,030
And next day I phoned up Ben Davison and
I said,

588
00:28:24,231 --> 00:28:26,920
I don't want to go back downhill route,
but the same training,

589
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,170
same promoter,
same anything.

590
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,400
And everything's got to change as it's 
going to be a new tyson fury.

591
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,240
That's so amazing,
man.

592
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,910
So art for the last hundred and 40 
pounds,

593
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,260
more importantly,
lots of knee braces.

594
00:28:38,261 --> 00:28:39,180
Back braces,
cage,

595
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,720
lost the knee,
but no more knee braces.

596
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,520
Knee braces.
How did he do that?

597
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,443
Well,
let me finish because knee braces and 

598
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:47,770
canes.
Not just to walk but run.

599
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,380
But this is what the program is really 
about.

600
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,100
When year he's five,
six,

601
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,770
took a picture of a six foot two son.
That's insane.

602
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,620
Standing on his back while he's doing a 
pushup in one year.

603
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,760
One year.
That's great.

604
00:29:00,761 --> 00:29:02,050
Imagine if you didn't see him for a 
year.

605
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,250
Hey males,
go have lunch.

606
00:29:03,251 --> 00:29:05,830
I'm seeing in a long time like we're.
Who

607
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,100
the fuck are you?
Where's Arthur?

608
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,853
I found the crack and I followed the 
crack and the crack got bigger and all 

609
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:15,740
of a sudden I see fucking glow.
Like green glow.

610
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,180
Crawl on Cron.
Cron.

611
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,530
Find it.
Try to get up.

612
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:19,910
My tags are too big.
I can't fuck it.

613
00:29:19,911 --> 00:29:22,660
Get out of the little hole.
Can't get out of the hole.

614
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:23,860
I'm fucking big.
Big,

615
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,260
big,
big fucking hitting,

616
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,730
screaming,
freaking out.

617
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,290
Calm down.
Calm like calm down.

618
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:31,460
Kelly.
This is the way.

619
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,380
Calm the fuck down.
Reel it in,

620
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,730
reel it in.
We're here.

621
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:38,240
We made it.
Grab control.

622
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,310
Follow the cracks more up out.
Boom.

623
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,680
There's the K fucking I'm out.
Made it.

624
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,870
You're coming home.
You aren't talking about that was it.

625
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,530
And I texted my girl,
I love you baby.

626
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,653
And uh,
they was fucking scary moment but 

627
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:01,960
daddy's coming home.

628
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,950
So you felt calm while it was flipping?
Oh yeah.

629
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,810
I always will.
I've seen cars flipped,

630
00:30:08,811 --> 00:30:10,210
right?
I've seen it for years,

631
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,830
right?
So I know that it's possible.

632
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:16,450
So I get in there and I got turned 
around at a race in 1998.

633
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:21,451
I was racing at Daytona and I got turned
around and the car.

634
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,380
So I'm flipping for the first time in my
life and this car's like over 3000,

635
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,810
300 pounds.
So it's,

636
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,713
it's.
But it flies up in the air like it's 

637
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:30,821
paper,
man.

638
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:33,220
It's the craziest thing in the world.
It's so you're weightless.

639
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,510
You know,
there's the cars flipping.

640
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,180
You're pushed into the seat.
So you feel great.

641
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:40,510
You feel weight of yourself in the seat.
That never changes.

642
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:42,700
You never kind of come up out of the 
scene like that,

643
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:45,250
you know,
and so it's like somebody's role to prop

644
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,103
walla grass up against the side of the 
car and then against the roof and then 

645
00:30:48,371 --> 00:30:49,610
against that side and then,
you know,

646
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,503
it kept doing that and I'm like,
it's just the weirdest feeling and you 

647
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:56,780
feel completely safe and you feel like,
you know,

648
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,360
nothing's going to harm me.

649
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,140
And in doing so,
he was telling this story about being in

650
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:01,974
this,
uh,

651
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,930
this forensic laboratory isn't an,
as an autopsy was taking place.

652
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,800
And this autopsy table was adjacent to 
this,

653
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,723
this huge indoor window that separated 
the autopsy suite from this lunch room 

654
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,380
and in the lunch room where the rest of 
the,

655
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:20,730
uh,
the forensic staff,

656
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,840
they're all eating their lunches.
They all had tuna sandwiches and cans of

657
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,674
coke and barbecued potato chips.
And they were watching through the 

658
00:31:29,611 --> 00:31:30,444
window as this absolutely perfect.
Twelve year old boy was being autopsied 

659
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,513
and just hours before at this kid,
like two hours before this kid had been 

660
00:31:41,491 --> 00:31:44,310
riding his bicycle,
he'd fallen over.

661
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,850
He'd hit his head on the curb.
And now two hours later,

662
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,990
he was dead and dead without almost a 
scratch on him,

663
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,410
just this perfect naked dead 12 year old
boy on the autopsy table.

664
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,053
And as he,
that the technician is eating their 

665
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:02,334
lunch,
watching it through a window that they 

666
00:32:05,251 --> 00:32:06,930
watch as the,
uh,

667
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,020
as the,
a pathologist in sizes around the top of

668
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:14,460
the kid's face,
at the top of the forehead,

669
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:17,820
the hairline,
and then peels the face down,

670
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,970
like peeling an orange peels the entire 
face off of the skull of this little boy

671
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,450
and leaves the face around the neck like
a mask,

672
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:32,130
like a rubber mask.
And this exposes this liver colored dark

673
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:35,910
red musculature of the child's 
underlying face.

674
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:40,910
And this one guy watching it with a 
mouthful of tuna sandwich,

675
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,490
he points this out and he says,
see that?

676
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,743
That there,
that's the color of red that I want to 

677
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,060
paint our rec room.
Holy Shit.

678
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,250
Okay.
So what I do when I got the phone,

679
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,100
I said,
let me do this with it.

680
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,350
Flip it around.
Yes.

681
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,290
And I reminded myself,
why do,

682
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,640
uh,
in,

683
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:05,090
in the military cadets,
why do they twirl their gun?

684
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,850
Of what possible value is this in 
combat?

685
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,100
Why do they do these things with their 
gun?

686
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:14,100
And then I realized you're not supposed 
to drop your gun ever,

687
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,333
ever.
So if you twirl the gun and you don't 

688
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:19,484
drop it,
it means stuff can happen to you in 

689
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:23,630
combat and it is always attached to your
body.

690
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,120
So when I got my phone I said,
let me just do this.

691
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,260
Okay,
let me just do this.

692
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:38,261
If I pick up the phone and dropped it,
Jesus Christ.

693
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:43,970
So when you do that,
then you never drop your phone.

694
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,073
So it's not that I'm a risk taker is 
that I've changed my risk to make it so 

695
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:50,714
low that it essentially won't happen.
And you've got apple care to get apple 

696
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,350
care.
I know it's going to Bill Maher route.

697
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,210
Do you purple without getting me into 
the alarm.

698
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,700
Do you have a Bill Maher character?
Yeah,

699
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,350
I did.
Do.

700
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,243
I saw you.
Did you went to those people who have 

701
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,880
those people?
You're not.

702
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:12,330
Okay.
You're wrong.

703
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,590
There is no god.
Okay.

704
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,740
I never was a bond to heavy man.
I got shit to do,

705
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:23,574
man.
I can't.

706
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,463
Oh,
the just peeled down or the Dab thing 

707
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,880
that I got friends in Colorado,
California now,

708
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:31,500
the first time I ever did what?
Shit.

709
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,880
I just pulled it like it was a big old 
bong rip and then like everybody's faces

710
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:35,340
was like,
Whoa,

711
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,380
Whoa,
you know,

712
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,233
it was like,
I need you instantly know you just did 

713
00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:40,810
something you shouldn't have.
And uh,

714
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,070
I was like,
Oh fuck man.

715
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:42,923
So I sat down and for a couple minutes I
just started getting really cold and 

716
00:34:45,571 --> 00:34:46,650
clammy and was like,
Yep,

717
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,960
I'm going to Puke.
So I went and I was like,

718
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,670
I'm fucked this guy,
so puke rightness,

719
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,260
sink.
And I was like,

720
00:34:52,261 --> 00:34:53,190
dude,
I got to go home.

721
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,680
I feel like dog shit now.
And I'm pretty sure I'm dying.

722
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,570
So we lived in this apartment and I was 
like,

723
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,550
went out the door and turned the corner 
to go down the hallway to my.

724
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,440
And it was full on vertigo,
like the hallway.

725
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:06,990
Every time I took a step,
the hallway got twice as long.

726
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,020
It was like,
this is fucked up.

727
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,980
My wife was out of the country on work 
at the time.

728
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,853
I was like,
I remember I was sitting down in the 

729
00:35:12,781 --> 00:35:16,320
hallway just like trying to get my shit 
together,

730
00:35:16,321 --> 00:35:17,940
man,
because I thought I was having a fucking

731
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:22,170
heart attack.
It was just like sweating and I remember

732
00:35:22,171 --> 00:35:24,930
this voice saying,
get up you stupid junkie,

733
00:35:24,931 --> 00:35:25,764
fuck before somebody comes out here and 
sees you sitting in the hallway like a 

734
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:30,744
dumb ass.
And I managed to like pop out of it and 

735
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,190
as soon as I got back to my place and 
sit down on the couch,

736
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,640
everything was fine but was just so 
initial

737
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,230
and the rush.
I was just like,

738
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,210
I don't,
nobody needs to be that stone.

739
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:43,923
I,
I wanted to tell her story about Mike 

740
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:49,150
because he,
a tony our s,

741
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,150
another guy won't,
we'll call him chuck,

742
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:52,990
but he's with the government now.
Yeah.

743
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,140
So they always used to go around and,
and,

744
00:35:55,141 --> 00:35:57,630
and want to fight balances and all this 
shit.

745
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:58,464
I used to work at all the underground 
hip hop clubs in New York and I take 

746
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:02,874
Brian,
another dude from the school and Tony 

747
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,633
and Brian is in the middle of the 
fucking dance floor doing the Funky 

748
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:12,750
fucking white boy nerd dance and all 
these fuck,

749
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:16,950
and the floor just opens up kill.
Look at this motherfucking white boy.

750
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:19,890
Like I might go.
I gotta go,

751
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,650
but listen man,
I know what y'all motherfuckers do.

752
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,060
Don't start.
No Shit.

753
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,220
Wake up.
The next day I get a fucking phone call.

754
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,293
There was these three fucking karate 
experts in the club last night and they 

755
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:33,180
beat up all my fucking bouncers.

756
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,090
You know this guys all on the juice rips
off his shirt,

757
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:36,924
like fucking Tony throws a kick.
Fucking dislocates the guy's fucking 

758
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,000
kneecap.
Brian's like fucking fight.

759
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,720
Then all of a sudden I'm fucking whack 
and these dudes and us,

760
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,643
we're fighting these guys.
And then this fucking gigantic mother 

761
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:54,234
fucker like lifts me up and carries me 
out the fucking door and throws me 

762
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:00,630
across this car.
Brian says,

763
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:05,631
and I look and it's this fucking crazy 
white dude with a fucking scar.

764
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,340
When he points at Brian,
it goes,

765
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,180
don't even think about it.
And like Brian was like,

766
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:13,380
Yo,
you know,

767
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:14,460
it was,
he's,

768
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,140
he's a,
he's a character.

769
00:37:16,141 --> 00:37:18,300
Like I said,
I was at his first comedy show

770
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,400
and Qbb who the fuck knows what's going 
to happen with him,

771
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,640
you know,
and yeah,

772
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,813
I hope they're,
they're leaning on them so we can get a 

773
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:27,034
rematch.
I mean I love watching invite first and 

774
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:30,364
I can,
I can stretch myself to understand his 

775
00:37:33,191 --> 00:37:35,180
reaction.
I can stretch myself to.

776
00:37:35,181 --> 00:37:38,950
And I can't stretch myself to understand
the order guys reactions.

777
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,760
Like I said,
for,

778
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,541
for,
for Habib,

779
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:42,030
I didn't think it was,
you know,

780
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,660
it was,
it's just,

781
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,523
it's almost,
it's such a foolish thing to do because 

782
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,103
listening to date already one,
I know that Dylan was talking shit and 

783
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:54,070
he was angry but she didn't say anything
because I heard a few people saying that

784
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,330
now.
I was standing beside dylan.

785
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,460
I didn't see what he did but I could 
hear.

786
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,410
So he didn't say anything and I watched 
it back.

787
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:01,680
I see any kind of backing them on,
you know,

788
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,240
just stupid end the fight stuff,
but it,

789
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,220
I didn't think it justified that level 
of response.

790
00:38:07,221 --> 00:38:08,810
And then maybe there was something else 
in the leadup,

791
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,440
you know,
Dylan is a bit of a troll online,

792
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,890
so there was probably a bit of a buildup
of voter stuff.

793
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,020
But um,
yeah,

794
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:19,210
like I said,
it wasn't that big a deal to me.

795
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,710
What have you did or not?

796
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,700
So is that a joint or instead a cigar,
you know,

797
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,700
it's um,
marijuana side of a tobacco.

798
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,650
Oh,
okay.

799
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,960
So it's like posh plot tobacco pot.
Never had that.

800
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,340
Yeah,
I think I tried one once.

801
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,373
Come on,
man.

802
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,720
Probably can't because stockholders,
right?

803
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,870
I mean it's legal,
right?

804
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,220
It's totally legal.
Okay.

805
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,893
How does that work?
Do People get upset at you if you do 

806
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:55,420
certain things?
Tobacco and marijuana in there,

807
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,913
that's all it is.

808
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,380
Millionaire Tesla had Ilan last up to 
Tesla CEO.

809
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:08,270
Elon musk is the subject of a new 
controversy.

810
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,163
Elon musk and seeing taken into joint 
during a podcast interview with Joe 

811
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,323
Rogan.
It's just the latest bizarre incident 

812
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:18,500
for the high profile CEO of Tesla and 
space x.

813
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,020
on the same day the podcast was 
published,

814
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,230
Tesla's chief accounting officer 
announced his resignation.

815
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,090
You did not cite the incident.

816
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,240
So Tesla stock also took a hit plunging 
more than six percent is inhaling.

817
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,433
Yeah.
And I'm not sure.

818
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,453
Mosque under fire after taking a hit of 
marijuana mixed with tobacco that has 

819
00:39:40,051 --> 00:39:43,260
already become a gift.
One of those moving images on twitter.

820
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,730
What about the pot?

821
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,920
Uh,
I do not smoke pot as anyone who watched

822
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:51,410
the part cost tell.
I have no idea how to smoke.

823
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,110
What might be a higher thinking life?
Well,

824
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:58,820
he might as well be right if he was an 
alien and he looked exactly like that.

825
00:39:58,821 --> 00:40:01,010
I'll be honest,
when he grabbed the joint and the way he

826
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:02,600
kind of looked at it,
I was kind of like,

827
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:04,730
it seemed kind of like a guy who was 
kind of like,

828
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,240
I'm not familiar with this practice,
but.

829
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,900
Or maybe he's so smart that he thought 
it would be funny if you print tended.

830
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:16,901
He didn't know what a joint was.
Could it be words or this summer?

831
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,063
Right.
But when he said that a tesla going 

832
00:40:21,261 --> 00:40:24,050
private funding secure at 4:20,

833
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,193
which is $20,000,000 for that joke,
that joke cost them $20,000,000 to sec 

834
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,840
got mad at him.
They find him.

835
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,340
It was on your stock price is a little 
bit.

836
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,400
Well that was one of the things in your 
shareholders into a panic.

837
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,313
Jamie was concerned that they were going
to contact us and see if we arranged 

838
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,770
that pot smoking part.
Like if that was something that had been

839
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:51,260
arranged in advance because it crashed 
the stock.

840
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,930
That was what I was like,
Joe Rogan making noise.

841
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,390
Oh Jesus.
We didn't do that.

842
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:00,710
Did we?
You know what I mean?

843
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:04,130
No one says I'm going to bake cookies 
and they're an idiot.

844
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:07,610
Fuck these people bake them cookies and 
they got to like it.

845
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,261
No,
no,

846
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:09,830
it's.
I mean,

847
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,980
it's a.
food is a fascinating thing to me.

848
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,870
Yeah.
I mean,

849
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,720
I guess this is a good time to bring it 
up as any.

850
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,501
Um,
you know,

851
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:23,501
obviously Anthony Bordain took his life 
last week and um,

852
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,780
he was a friend of mine and it was real.
That was real hard.

853
00:41:26,781 --> 00:41:27,830
Friday was real hard,
uh,

854
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:31,790
woke up and um,
I got a text from my friend Maynard from

855
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:33,840
tool,
um,

856
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,783
maynard said so much for the Keenan 
versus bordain celebrity Jujitsu match 

857
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,820
and,
and,

858
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,620
and he was like,
fuck.

859
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,000
And I was like,
oh no,

860
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,090
what does that mean?
Yeah.

861
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,900
And so then I googled it and I saw it.
I was like,

862
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,600
Oh shit man,
I can't fuck Wyatt.

863
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,830
Yeah,
just why he hung himself.

864
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:59,831
Like what Chris Man,
like you would to Curtis Stan.

865
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,680
I mean you go,
you go to the jungles of Brazil.

866
00:42:02,681 --> 00:42:05,020
I mean you go deep man.
That's a,

867
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,450
that's going to be a weird fucking way 
to live.

868
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,530
You get up.
I'm just like,

869
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:10,364
I'm having this late in life childhood 
of getting to go to all the places that 

870
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:16,630
I dreamed about and read about,
you know,

871
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,633
I love,
I grew up reading books about pirates 

872
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:23,180
and explorers and so of course,
given the opportunity,

873
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:25,040
that's pretty much what I'm doing on the
show.

874
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,453
Wow.
What a crazy change of life at 44 years 

875
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:30,150
of age,
how much did you travel before then?

876
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,450
Almost nothing.
I mean,

877
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:34,270
I'd been to France a couple of summers 
as a kid,

878
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,450
a bit to the Caribbean.
That was about it.

879
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:37,940
I mean,
I,

880
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,920
I was always sure of anything at age 44 
standing in the kitchen.

881
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,170
It was that I'd never see,
you know,

882
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,370
Saigon or,
or Hong Kong,

883
00:42:48,371 --> 00:42:49,450
much less,
you know,

884
00:42:49,451 --> 00:42:52,300
I probably had no expectation I'd ever 
see Rome,

885
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,100
so I'm just,
again,

886
00:42:54,101 --> 00:42:58,270
I'm just kind of living that out and,
and as long as me and the crew,

887
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,760
as long as we're having as much fun as 
we are,

888
00:43:00,761 --> 00:43:04,930
at least finding ways to make like more 
and more fucked up television.

889
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,760
As long as we can do that.
