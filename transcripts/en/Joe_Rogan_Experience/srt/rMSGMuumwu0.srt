1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
All Right,
we're live gentlemen.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,730
What's up?
Hey now,

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,050
thanks for doing this.
Appreciate it.

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,920
Thank you.
Bigger,

5
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:05,820
stronger,
faster.

6
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:08,730
It was a,
it was a documentary that I could not.

7
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,990
Um,
there was so many people that we're 

8
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:13,990
talking about it if you couldn't avoid 
like having a conversation about it,

9
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,740
especially like in the UFC because so 
many fighters have been accused of 

10
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,361
taking performance enhancing drugs and 
there's so many conversations about 

11
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:23,361
that.
So,

12
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:27,681
uh,
I always wanted to talk to you guys and 

13
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:27,681
I watched it again.
I watched,

14
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:30,470
I watched like the first half of it when
it first came out and I watched it all 

15
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,160
again this morning to check it out.
Just get it.

16
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:37,161
Boy,
you're the first time or why didn't you 

17
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:37,161
watch it?
All the way through,

18
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:39,160
but I don't remember.
I think it was on a plane and I think 

19
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,400
the plane probably landed and I shut my 
laptop and I never picked it up again.

20
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,600
It was one of those things.
Yeah.

21
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,460
What'd you think of it?
It's great.

22
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,540
Great Documentary and interesting and 
honest.

23
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,480
It was really hilarious when you're 
going over the,

24
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:53,481
uh,
people that like what's the number one 

25
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:53,481
reason to go to the hospital and then 
they're like,

26
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:58,310
aspirin,
fucking vitamin C and then below that 

27
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,340
with steroids and then steroids was way 
down.

28
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:04,341
I think the amount of deaths,
it's like steroids deaths or like 

29
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:06,760
slightly above water drinking water.
There's no,

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,140
there's no real proof to link to link 
anything scientifically,

31
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:15,141
you know,
you can have a anecdotal evidence on a 

32
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,391
lot of things,
but nothing scientifically links 

33
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:18,330
steroids that these deaths,
this is a real problem with some people.

34
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:20,300
They don't want to hear that and they 
did.

35
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,900
They don't want to hear it because they 
don't.

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,200
There's like a,
there's a narrative that we're being 

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,810
taught in this country or that we're 
being told to embrace that narrative is 

38
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,270
steroids are for cheaters and cheaters,
losers and losers on American.

39
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,520
But as you highlighted in your movie 
over and over and over again,

40
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,820
all these examples of different athletes
that were caught with performance 

41
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:45,840
enhancing drugs was the guy from the 
Tour de France,

42
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:50,841
whether it was Carl Lewis,
the Carlos thing was fucking hilarious 

43
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:53,870
because a lot of people don't know when 
Ben Johnson got tested positive for 

44
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:53,870
steroids,
they stripped him of his metal.

45
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,470
Carl Lewis tested positive for 
amphetamines.

46
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,670
Yeah.
It wasn't supposed to run.

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,650
So that's the whole thing is crazy.
I mean,

48
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:03,651
they're all doped up,
but like you said about the narrative 

49
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:06,171
that they want you to believe the 
narrative doesn't come from health 

50
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:06,660
problems.
The narrative comes from,

51
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,830
you know,
nobody's concerned about the health of 

52
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,830
the athlete.
We say that,

53
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,820
uh,
but nobody really concerned about the 

54
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,511
health of the athlete.
They're concerned about an unfair 

55
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:17,511
advantage.
Yeah.

56
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:21,771
They're concerned about someone being 
able to do what we suspected the 

57
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:22,860
Russians were doing back in the fifties.

58
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,160
And that was really enlightening to when
you were talking to that guy that was 

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,621
saying that they,
they had found out about it from the 

60
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:32,811
Russians doing it at 19 fifties.
And from then on they were doping and 

61
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:36,860
over shots of vodka,
they were actually hanging out with the 

62
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,140
Russian strength coach and he was,
you know,

63
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:42,141
a little loose,
loosey Goosey and he sort of slipped up 

64
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:42,141
and it's like,
yeah,

65
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:45,771
we're given our guys testosterone.
So as soon as I got out of the bag Dr 

66
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:46,770
Ziglar raced home and he created Diana 
Ball,

67
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,100
which was even a stronger steroid then 
was currently available on the market 

68
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,480
and they started testing guys with like 
five milligrams of Diana Ball.

69
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,810
And of course they found other ways to 
get it through the testing facility or 

70
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,840
however they were getting their hands on
it once it was manufactured.

71
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,120
And that's when it became the wild west.

72
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Basically.
It was like people started taking 20 

73
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,131
milligrams and getting way stronger.
And it's kind of crazy because if you 

74
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:11,740
know,
if you want to get better at something,

75
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:16,741
people don't have a problem with people 
using certain means where people don't 

76
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:19,831
have problem with someone to go into a 
supplement store and purchasing 

77
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:20,830
something that doesn't work.
But as soon as you take something that's

78
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,760
powerful,
people are like,

79
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:22,630
well,
wait a second.

80
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:23,740
We don't want you to doing that.
Good.

81
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,650
I was always tell people the strongest 
shit I ever took.

82
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:29,230
They made illegal but used to be able to
buy the GNC.

83
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,710
It was called Mag 10.
Do you remember that snow?

84
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,200
Yeah,
totally.

85
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,610
Yeah.
Oh my God.

86
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,850
That stuff.
I took that shit for like whatever it 

87
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:38,980
was like six weeks.
I gained like 10 pounds.

88
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,860
I was jacked up all the time.
It was like a bunch of pills.

89
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,380
You have to take like 10 pills.
And after it was over,

90
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,530
my Dick died.
Like it got hit with a media was 

91
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:49,870
useless.
It was useless.

92
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,030
The thing is,
it took me for my testosterone to come 

93
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,030
back and it's like,
oh,

94
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,120
this is steroids.
Like real steroids.

95
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:57,220
You could buy a GNC.
They made it illegal.

96
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:02,221
Those drugs are more dangerous than the 
actual real testosterone and all kinds 

97
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,420
of stuff to the fuck was in danger.
I just bought it because it was legal.

98
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,950
Probably a lot of sodium,
a lot of those pills.

99
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:10,960
Uh,
what they do is they'll give you a,

100
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,520
a huge surge of estrogen as well for the
girl to now they did.

101
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,110
And I got lucky,
but you know,

102
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:21,070
that's what one of the guys was on the 
US power lifting team with,

103
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:26,071
uh,
Bruce Jenner thinks happened to gender 

104
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:26,071
and he believes that.

105
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:31,050
Well,
first of all he said he knows that they 

106
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,480
had gender pumped full of steroids.
He said we were all on steroids.

107
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:36,481
He goes,
Jana was absolutely pumped full of 

108
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:37,861
steroids.
And he said that was what started his 

109
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,380
transition.
This is where I'm heading.

110
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,580
Maybe if you drop off a little bit to 
stay on dude,

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,690
you know,
that's,

112
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,980
that's interesting.
But mark and I had this talk the other 

113
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:49,980
day and I think that,
um,

114
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,640
this whole like gender issue and 
transgender and all these different 

115
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,871
things like,
I don't know how much that's linked to 

116
00:04:57,871 --> 00:04:57,871
testosterone levels are not like that.
I don't know the,

117
00:04:57,871 --> 00:05:01,060
if there's that many definitive studies 
on like whether your testosterone,

118
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,090
like if you have a high estrogen level,
just because somebody is going to be 

119
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:06,090
trained,
they don't have testosterone levels.

120
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,141
Yeah,
there's a lot of people that are gay 

121
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:10,141
that are very high testosterone.

122
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:10,141
Later,
people can kick ass to there.

123
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:10,730
Okay.
But,

124
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,820
but those are gay.
They're not,

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,020
they don't identify as female that there
is a difference.

126
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,340
I don't know how that actually 
correlates.

127
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:19,750
I haven't read the studies on that 
stuff,

128
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:24,751
but I think it's probably,
it's difficult for us to understand as 

129
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:24,751
to understand what it's like to be a 
woman.

130
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:26,470
It's like,
it's like you don't get it.

131
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,630
You don't get any.
Like,

132
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,810
like they probably don't get what it's 
like to not want to be a woman right 

133
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:32,810
now.
You're like,

134
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:32,810
ah,
I'm good.

135
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,410
He's like,
are you sure you don't want to be a 

136
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:37,410
woman?
Like,

137
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:37,410
I'm good,
I'm good.

138
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:38,800
Well,
good luck.

139
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,610
And the power lifting world,
uh,

140
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,260
in the,
you know,

141
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:44,320
the world power lifting,
it's been sort of turned on its ear by a

142
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:49,060
guy named Matt Kroc is that.
It's ski marks can tell you a little bit

143
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:50,050
more about him.
But uh,

144
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,970
he had been friends with him for about a
decade.

145
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,120
Um,
I've known about his issue for about six

146
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:59,030
or seven years now and he's actually 
going to on my show coming up soon,

147
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,940
but you know,
he's a transgender and he's,

148
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:06,941
you know,
it's ruined relationships for them many 

149
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:06,941
times over.
He's got three kids,

150
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:08,660
he's a good father,
he's a good person,

151
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:11,840
he's a good dude or female.
That's good woman.

152
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,120
She's a good woman.
Um,

153
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,780
but uh,
you know,

154
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:19,781
the issue is,
is really interesting and that's why I 

155
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:21,080
want to like talk to him and try to help
people just better understand it because

156
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,190
people get so mad.

157
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,690
That's the thing I don't get as he is a,
I do understand voicing your opinion and

158
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,680
saying,
fuck man,

159
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:28,370
that's weird.
Like,

160
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:33,371
that makes sense to me.
But people actually getting mad and 

161
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:33,371
having a committing hate crimes and 
stuff.

162
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:33,820
To me it's just disgusting.
I don't,

163
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,240
I don't,
I'm not on board with that.

164
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,010
Yeah,
it is disgusting and I just,

165
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:38,870
I got to think that it comes from their 
family,

166
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:41,410
from the way they're raised by their 
parents are ignorant.

167
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,770
That's the only thing that makes any 
sense.

168
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,050
I just think that we're moving past 
that.

169
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:50,051
I think there's more awareness and more 
acceptance for those sorts of issues 

170
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:51,200
that people have,
that every country worries about.

171
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:55,900
Some fucked up shit.
There's a lot worse going on.

172
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,240
Steroids,
who cares everyday,

173
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:04,570
everyday.
Another cop shooting somebody and we're 

174
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,840
worried about concerned ourselves so 
much more with the tabloid media than we

175
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:10,841
do with the,
with what's really going on in this 

176
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:10,841
country.

177
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:10,841
Well,
the cops shooting part,

178
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:11,150
you know,
it's a horrible thing,

179
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:14,420
but cops on steroids is something that 
people don't talk about too much.

180
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,580
Uh,
it's kind of hilarious when you see cops

181
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:21,581
busting people for steroids because we 
all know anybody who knows people that 

182
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:24,110
take steroids knows that cops are on 
steroids.

183
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,140
Absolutely.
Giant chunk of them and busted our 

184
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,690
brother would steroids and they're 
probably on it when they were busted and

185
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,110
confiscated every cop in poughkeepsie 
where we're from,

186
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:37,980
got huge.
They had,

187
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,270
they took like a thousand pills,
a Diana ball from him.

188
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,810
And next thing you know that cops are 
walking around all jack.

189
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,710
Well,
they had A.

190
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,710
I had talked to a guy who was a cop I 
used to workout with and he had a 

191
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,560
rational explanation.
He's like,

192
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:52,640
look man.
He goes,

193
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,320
it's fucking gross out there.
He goes,

194
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:57,470
it's dangerous as fuck and you got to be
on top of your game and you want to have

195
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:58,010
an edge.

196
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,880
Right?
Meanwhile,

197
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,400
dude was five slash 70 weight to 50.
I'm like,

198
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:05,160
you've got a couple of edges,
edges all over your body,

199
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,040
so fucking jacked.
That's how do you even move like that?

200
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,850
That's not very well.
Well,

201
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,850
someone would have to do is get ahold of
him and hang on.

202
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,300
You got to do with a guy like that as 
ride the bull will send them.

203
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Look,
if you taught those guys what you know 

204
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,601
in Jujitsu,
they'd be much more effective than 

205
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:25,601
taking steroids,
but that's probably the easier route.

206
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:26,330
Right?
I would help,

207
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:31,331
but the real.
The reality is you're dealing with guns 

208
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:31,850
and knives and shit like that.
No matter how big you are,

209
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:33,140
it doesn't even really matter,
right?

210
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,930
No.
You definitely should know how to defend

211
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:37,460
yourself physically.
One hundred percent.

212
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:40,130
Every cop should be a black belt in 
something,

213
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:45,131
you should know what it's like to be in 
a wild melee with another person who's 

214
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:47,300
trying to kill you with their hands,
but that's not going to protect you from

215
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:51,060
guns and knives and all that and gun 
defense stuff like that's,

216
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,730
that's an art in and of itself.

217
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,320
Like,
you know,

218
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,580
there's some guys who are experts in 
guns away from people and Shit.

219
00:08:56,581 --> 00:09:00,870
But good luck with all the major 
differences between like UFC and pride.

220
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,730
Pride.
I don't think they really had rules.

221
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,960
Right.
They definitely had rules.

222
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,080
They had no elbows and that was just 
mentioned testing wise.

223
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,370
Oh,
testing wise.

224
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:08,780
Yeah.
No,

225
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,470
they didn't have rules at all.
In fact,

226
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:14,430
they specifically said on their 
contracts that there was no,

227
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,290
no test steroids.
Uh,

228
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,040
ensign.
Anyway.

229
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,890
Who's one of the fighters from pride?
Great guy fought in UFC as well.

230
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,750
He,
um,

231
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,870
he did this whole thing about it where 
he came on the podcast and explain like 

232
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,670
the verbatim contract.
It said we are not going to test.

233
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:31,650
You forced her meaning like,
go ahead and do your thing.

234
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,310
Yeah.
Well,

235
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,320
they encouraged it,
buddy of mine who was,

236
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,560
he would fight in America,
American one 70 and they wanted him to 

237
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:39,560
fight in Japan.

238
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,490
He went over there and had some meetings
that you'll one 85 and he's like,

239
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:44,610
but I don't wave one any five.
I weigh 180 right now.

240
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,790
Is acknowledged this throats again wit 
like they were like really sold on him 

241
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:53,190
being one of the five.
They wanted big Americans.

242
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:54,750
They wanted everyone to look like Mark 
Kerr.

243
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,270
Remember my.
It was amazing as smashing machine.

244
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,780
That's smashing machine as a documentary
filmmaker.

245
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,570
That was my favorite documentary.
I think the sale is to we ever.

246
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,750
It's an amazing documentary and for 
folks who don't know what it's about,

247
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:11,751
it's about Mark Kerr who was at the time
one of the most dangerous mma fighters 

248
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:13,470
and more like a guy who you would look 
at and you'd say,

249
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:15,900
well that is what an MMA fighter should 
look like.

250
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,290
Two hundred 60 pounds fucking Jack to 
the tits.

251
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,840
Just giant and smashing people.

252
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,600
But they caught him.
There he is right there at his prime.

253
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,240
What a fucking shit man.
Yeah,

254
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:31,260
that's a good picture.
They caught him right when he slid.

255
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:36,590
They caught.
They literally caught him on top before 

256
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,060
he'd slipped and then went into this mad
fucking painkiller slide.

257
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,560
Absolutely.
It happens to everybody.

258
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:43,110
I mean that's what happened in the world
of pro wrestling,

259
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,770
which were like really closely 
associated with all these guys.

260
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,750
You didn't hear about the wrestlers 
dying and everything.

261
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's not necessarily the steroids,
it's a deadly cocktail that they're all 

262
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,960
doing it.
Steroids are a big part of it,

263
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:59,961
but that's the steroids.
It's tiny in comparison to the head 

264
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:02,280
injured is important to point out that,
that they're not safe.

265
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:07,281
You know,
like I think sometimes people that take 

266
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:07,281
them are like,
fuck yeah man,

267
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:07,520
take steroids.
They definitely have their,

268
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,360
their drawbacks and there are 
definitely,

269
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:11,140
it's a drug and it's an illegal drug,
you know,

270
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,720
so that always needs to be done dose.

271
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,520
It's well,
right.

272
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,580
You know,
there's people that are gonna take a 

273
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,851
little bit and be fine or there's people
that are going to go off the rails and 

274
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:23,450
like there was a dude that we knew that 
was a detour Belfort's trainer in the 

275
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,740
nineties and he died really young.
She died like 32 or 33.

276
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,740
We used to call them garden hoses 
because he would work out.

277
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:31,670
He would be purple and it's fucking arms
veins.

278
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,550
Curtis left purple.
Yeah.

279
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,050
They call him,
call the Barney at the gym.

280
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,700
They'd call him Barney because they're 
so purple.

281
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,670
He was nicest guy.
The sales guy.

282
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,230
Really great guy.
And um,

283
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,100
and veto or at the time was Jack Jack.
He was training at golds Venice.

284
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,040
He almost got to Jack Memory,
came in,

285
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,490
smoked everybody.
Then all of a sudden he got like kind of

286
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,620
too big.
When he fought randy,

287
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:58,621
he was too big and it was like 2:40
when he fought randy and he had no gas 

288
00:11:58,621 --> 00:11:58,621
tank.

289
00:11:58,621 --> 00:11:58,870
He was using specimen when he was 
younger.

290
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:01,240
When he was 19,
when he was 200 pounds.

291
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,020
He was like the perfect size because 
Vito has like a size eight foot.

292
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,320
He's not a big guy like his hands are 
fairly small too,

293
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,200
but he's just a spectacular athletes.
It's amazing.

294
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:14,230
He's done it for so long and believable.
I know it is and it's.

295
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,950
It's a really.
It's an interesting point because v tour

296
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,190
for the last year and a half was on 
testosterone replacement last like two 

297
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,930
years and had the most spectacular 
results of his career.

298
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:30,931
It was really crazy to see a guy who had
been fighting since 1997 in the UFC and 

299
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:34,360
he's knocking out Michael Bisping.
He's knocked out Luke rockhold,

300
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,140
Dan Henderson.
He's we'll kicking people in the head 

301
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,990
with the way he was doing.
It was just fucking crazy to watch.

302
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:45,991
He had kicked three of the best fighters
in the world and did it with muscles 

303
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:49,990
grown out of his fucking teeth mean just
legal in the UFC was legal.

304
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,050
It's honestly therapeutic use then.
Yeah,

305
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,330
but now it's a lot of came in and went,
Whoa,

306
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:57,280
hold the fuck up.
What's going on here?

307
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,540
First of all,
they had guys.

308
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,720
There were guys that were in their 
twenties that had been prescribed it 

309
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:03,720
for.
Yeah.

310
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,510
And they're like,
well,

311
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:06,370
what happened?
Why do you have a load test?

312
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:10,140
And most of them it's because the 
steroid use and we all know that there's

313
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:15,150
a way of manipulating those tests and 
maybe some are overtrained not sleeping 

314
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,291
well on top of 100 percent.
And if you don't think those tests get 

315
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,320
manipulated into like what you'd need to
do in bigger,

316
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:21,010
stronger,
faster.

317
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:23,120
I show you how to get human growth 
hormone and basically,

318
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,150
you know,
go to your doctor and do this and that.

319
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:30,151
And the way that you take the test was 
you had to like pee in this bag 

320
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:31,330
basically all day long.

321
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,400
And then you take a sample of that 
urine.

322
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,630
Uh,
but you know,

323
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:39,631
the way that I did it was I only,
I only took the urine from like two 

324
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:42,850
samples that were taken at night when 
your growth hormone is the lowest.

325
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,110
So my growth hormone looked like it came
from a guy who's 125 years old.

326
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,040
They're like,
oh my God,

327
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,230
you have no growth when I'm on your 
ticket in the morning.

328
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,130
It would have and balance it out with 
during the day would have been normal.

329
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,140
It would have been normal,
but it was really low,

330
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,380
so I just wanted the doctor to give me 
growth hormone to see if they would do 

331
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380
it for the movie.
Well,

332
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,560
the also they say if you eat a very 
large fatty meal like cheeseburgers and 

333
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,210
fries and shit,
like a big burger,

334
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,250
like right before you take the test,
like within an hour,

335
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:10,840
the test shit just plummets.

336
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,510
Your test plummets,
your growth plummets.

337
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:15,250
Everything just goes,
oh,

338
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:16,750
there's,
there's ways to beat all these tests.

339
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:18,920
Even even the guys that are beating the 
test,

340
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,230
uh,
to compete.

341
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,640
Lance Armstrong,
all these guys are strong lies.

342
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,440
A good documentary too.
Saw that was fucking incredible.

343
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,230
Well,
Jeff,

344
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:31,231
mind boggling.
The guy who busted Lance Armstrong is 

345
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:31,390
going to be on my podcast next week.
I fucking can't.

346
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,850
I had a great comment.
He,

347
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,590
the UFC,
hired him to try to clean up the sport.

348
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,220
I don't know what it's like going to a 
hoarder's house like you need to hire.

349
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:43,510
The other guy will eat off this floor,
hire a Ferrari guy.

350
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:48,190
The guy that was the Lance Armstrong 
coach I was trying to do,

351
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,500
no matter what you do,
the cheaters will always be ahead

352
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,390
of the guys that are trying to catch 
them.

353
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,910
It's just a cat and mouse game.
It's been going on forever.

354
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,010
Yeah,
well they were kind of ahead.

355
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,860
Now what they're doing now is they're,
you know,

356
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,480
the way they make testosterone.
Apparently they do something with yams.

357
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,400
That's how they make it.
Do you know the Mexican Wild Yams?

358
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,440
Yeah.
Well now do that thing where it's 

359
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,440
derived from or something.
Yeah.

360
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,710
Well now they figured out how to do it 
with animals and they have made a 

361
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,620
bioidentical testosterone that's.
You can't differentiate.

362
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,300
We just spoke about a stem cells.
Now,

363
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,340
stem cells aren't going to be a human,
but stem cells are going to allow you a 

364
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,920
Vito Belfort right now.
Now that he can't do the testosterone 

365
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,471
replacement,
he gets stem cells done to all of his 

366
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:32,471
existing injuries.
You know,

367
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:35,450
he basically got a clean slate and he's,
and he's back to normal.

368
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,940
I know where to draw the line.
I guess built over time,

369
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,300
you know,
a baseball pitcher can pitch 10 more 

370
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,300
years.
How,

371
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,741
how is,
how is that going to affect the future 

372
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:48,551
of sports with the records and all these
things like who can hit the most home 

373
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:48,551
runs and who can,
you know,

374
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:51,680
play the longest and all you need.
It's like there's a word that's a banned

375
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,360
word.
Steroids is like,

376
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,230
you know,
it's,

377
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,030
it's a,
it's a negative word.

378
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,740
My word will never be polished up.
Granted me and it's like the Barry Bonds

379
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,770
Shit with mark mcgwire all over 
Congress.

380
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,390
By the way.
That was one of my favorite parts of the

381
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:07,970
documentary was watching those dummies 
in Congress.

382
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,120
It was amazing to see.
And Joe Biden talk about memory when I 

383
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,290
was a good athlete.
I thought at the fuck you were,

384
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,650
you were never a good athlete.

385
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:23,650
I would like to that sir.
They took it away from me and it wasn't 

386
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,821
by God given talent,
like third string baseball player,

387
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,020
like community college,
whatever he was save it,

388
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,820
but whatever.
He was just shut your mouth.

389
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,570
Yeah,
exactly.

390
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,480
The thing was like,
they bring up these baseball players and

391
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:41,690
string them up before Congress.
It becomes this huge media circus.

392
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:44,350
Everybody loves to see that.
I'll look at their,

393
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,480
you know,
they're pointing out all these guys and 

394
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,401
they're the bad guys and you have guys 
like Mark Maguire up there looking like 

395
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:51,890
mark McGuire said,
steroids is bad.

396
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,600
It's a bad message.
Don't do them.

397
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:54,830
It's like,
this is people.

398
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,690
These are,
these are these heroes too.

399
00:16:56,691 --> 00:17:00,800
These kids up there that are completely 
looking like idiots and there's a better

400
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:01,570
way to handle it,
you know?

401
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:06,910
Well,
it just seemed really frivolous that 

402
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:06,910
they were in front of Congress for the.

403
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,080
They're getting too good at hitting the 
ball with the stick.

404
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,940
We need to bring in all our leaders.
Right?

405
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,050
Same.
That doesn't even seem real.

406
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,630
It seems like a good plot in the movie.
Even in swimming,

407
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:20,120
they made suits a few years ago.
They got rid of them right away.

408
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:25,150
It's a speedo company made a suit that 
makes you swim faster and as soon as 

409
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:25,590
they did that they were like,
Whoa,

410
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,500
we don't want you to swim in that fast.
So they got rid of them.

411
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,070
So it was like a body suit,
like your whole body as the body suit.

412
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,550
So like a wetsuit.
Yeah,

413
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,850
I think it helped increase like buoyancy
a little bit and just helped you kind of

414
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:40,280
glide through the pool faster.
That's pretty dope.

415
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,450
We're got one of those.
Well I guess the,

416
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,350
the issue with it was a,
it's expensive and so they were like,

417
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:50,351
oh,
it might price some people out of it or 

418
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:50,351
whatever.
I was like,

419
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:50,351
I don't really even understand what that
is.

420
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:51,900
All these sports end up being pretty 
expensive.

421
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:56,901
Come on man.
The amount of money that's involved in 

422
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:59,271
training for the Olympics for swimming,
things that are going on now with 

423
00:17:59,271 --> 00:17:59,340
training are insane.
You know,

424
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:04,341
I did my second film,
did a movie called trophy kids and it's 

425
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:06,270
about parents that push their kids in 
sports and that was on hbo and the thing

426
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:11,271
that is so crazy now is the way that 
parents have access to all these things 

427
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:13,530
we didn't have,
like you'll go to a,

428
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,460
you know,
a,

429
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,880
a baseball camp and they have like this 
Nike makes his hand eye coordination 

430
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,420
thing that you wouldn't believe how it 
tells you,

431
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:22,860
like,
what position your kid should play.

432
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,790
It tells you,
you know,

433
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,120
and,
and parents are actually going and 

434
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,801
getting genetic testing on their kid.
They swab the inside of their kids a 

435
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:32,160
cheek and they send it off to this 
company and it,

436
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,570
it'll tell the parent what sports.

437
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,920
The kid will be good at.
This one,

438
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,940
they're like an infant.
So there's some crazy stuff going on 

439
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,080
where,
where,

440
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:41,010
uh,
you know,

441
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,820
technology is far exceeding like,
you know,

442
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:46,610
what we've been able to do before.
That's fucking madness.

443
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,030
Robbing your kids,
cheat to find out what sport they should

444
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:51,420
do.
Well,

445
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,490
there's a,
there's a um,

446
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,560
California cryobank.
It's like a sperm bank and it's a at 

447
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,341
Ucla.
Don't get that infused with getting 

448
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,591
frozen into the fuck the therapy.
Arthritis.

449
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,290
Wow.
Great job.

450
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,880
Joe Rogan was fucking shit.
Tastes great.

451
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,740
Anyway,
you can get,

452
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,560
um,
it actually shows a guy on HBO,

453
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:24,561
Real Sports.
He goes in and basically like they 

454
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:25,200
custom order their kid and it's like 
this fat,

455
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,320
what the hell?
It's like this fat Mexican guy.

456
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:31,040
He goes in and he says,
I want a kid just like me,

457
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,390
blue eyes,
blonde hair and big calves.

458
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,240
And it's like he looks nothing like the 
guy.

459
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,080
So it's not his sperm as someone is 
using a sperm donor because he couldn't 

460
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,100
get his wife pregnant and they decide,
well we want our kid to be.

461
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,940
The father is similar,
similar to similar to me,

462
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,600
you know,
like athletic and outgoing and you know,

463
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:53,380
so they picked a six,
two blonde haired blue eyed kid with a.

464
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,400
and it actually says on the application,
huge gaps,

465
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,670
huge calves on the application.
What the fuck they,

466
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,910
they,
the California cryobank goes out and 

467
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:05,910
they recruit players.
Uh,

468
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,470
I went to USC.
So I know it goes on at USC,

469
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:10,740
they go out and recruit players to make 
extra money.

470
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:15,741
You can make 900 bucks a month or 
something jerking off in a cup and 

471
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:18,690
basically selling it to my parents.
It's a good deal.

472
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,820
Bad deal.
If you have rent,

473
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,370
you gotta pay it somehow.
Spring might be tainted probably.

474
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,880
Yeah.
They don't need to know that.

475
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:34,070
It's amazing.
It's an amazing phenomenon to see 

476
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,200
parents now getting into like,
how am I going to help my kid sheet?

477
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Well,
it's getting to the point also where 

478
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:39,520
they're within a few years.
Have you heard of Crispr?

479
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,160
Do you know what Crispr is?
No.

480
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,860
There's a radio lab documentary they did
on it.

481
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,050
It's a or a radio lab episode rather.
It's all about um,

482
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,040
this new tool that they have for

483
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,040
engineering genetics and for splicing 
genes and for adding traits or 

484
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,100
subtracting traits.
And you know,

485
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:55,690
you,
you showed him the documentary,

486
00:20:55,691 --> 00:21:00,691
the milestone and hypocrisies of doing 
with these cows that make these cows 

487
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:01,180
grow enormous amounts of muscle.
Well,

488
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:02,530
they're going,
first of all,

489
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:05,350
they could do it now to pigs and they're
going to be able to do it to people.

490
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:08,410
It's just a matter of when she's used to
be in a year.

491
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:10,720
Is it going to be in a decade?
It's going to happen.

492
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,260
If we live another 100 years of human 
beings survive 100 years and the 

493
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,000
asteroids don't blow us up or we don't 
get hit by a fucking nuke.

494
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,300
We're gonna have myostatin inhibited 
people that it looked like the hall 

495
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,320
that's fucking crazy and it's going to 
be nuts and they're going to live 

496
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,320
longer.
That's what's even more fucked up.

497
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,440
What do you think about steroids in the 
UFC?

498
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:34,470
Like what's your take on it?
Do you think they should be illegal or 

499
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,470
monitored or.
Well,

500
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,141
I think she's gonna be a moot point once
you get to genetic engineering and I 

501
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:41,590
think ultimately what steroids are,
is it's a form of engineering.

502
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:46,591
It's a form of biological engineering.
You're taking these substances and 

503
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:48,370
you're adding people,
but as you pointed out in your,

504
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,100
in your documentary,
look at the guy who was the,

505
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:51,540
uh,
the,

506
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,670
the Tour de France guy that had this 
oxygen tent,

507
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
these hyperbaric chamber to Chambers,
hyperbaric chambers.

508
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,340
What I do all the time,
the cryogenic freezing tanks,

509
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,470
all that shit is cheating.
I mean,

510
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:07,640
if you really want to look at it,
I take trt,

511
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:12,810
I'd take human growth hormone.
If I was competing in a somewhere that 

512
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,690
wouldn't let me take that,
that would be considered cheating.

513
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,940
But for life,
like I'm like,

514
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:21,060
look,
if you're 48 years old and you're not 

515
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,060
taking testosterone,
what do you hate?

516
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,300
Life.
You'd hate having energy started 

517
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:24,420
throwing it away.
Like your immune system sucks.

518
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,780
You want to feel better,
look better.

519
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,420
Your body works better.
It's all about simple.

520
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,650
Optimizing what you already are.
And I think when people go beyond that,

521
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,330
that's when it becomes into like,
okay,

522
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:36,550
well that it's cheating.
I don't know why people think that,

523
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:37,750
but that's what it is.
It's like,

524
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,740
you know,
if you say,

525
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:39,780
well,
I'm on trt,

526
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,140
nobody really cares.
You know?

527
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,160
And the same commercials for tea,
our tea,

528
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,190
I don't know if you noticed,
but during the world series,

529
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,390
the same sport that they condemn for 
steroids during the commercial break,

530
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:51,340
the first commercial.
Do you have low t?

531
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,050
Yeah.
No,

532
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,890
that's the very first commercial.
Hilarious.

533
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,240
I think that the issue with steroids 
also for a lot of people is they believe

534
00:22:58,241 --> 00:23:03,241
that it's going to get kids into them 
and that the kids are gonna get sick or 

535
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:04,090
they're going to get hurt or they're 
gonna commit suicide.

536
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,300
Like the guy in the documentary had.
He was convinced that his kid who we had

537
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:09,760
on Lexapro,
who was a teenager,

538
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:12,100
you know what I mean?
He was convinced that with steroids that

539
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:17,101
made this kid commit suicide and 
steroids very well may have played a 

540
00:23:17,101 --> 00:23:18,240
factor.
Abuse of anything is bad.

541
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,460
Whether it's abuse of alcohol,
there's a lot of different drugs,

542
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:23,980
painkillers that you can abuse that'll 
make you suicidal.

543
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,170
Abuse of anything is bad.
So to blame it on one thing that guy had

544
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:34,171
this blanket thought in his mind,
he's just going to throw a blanket over 

545
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:34,171
the problem.
The problem with steroids,

546
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:35,520
I don't even think you can blame it on 
the Lexapro.

547
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,250
There's a deeper issue going on with 
the,

548
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,300
with the child takes his own life.
He had,

549
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,360
he certainly had some issues and he also
didn't want to communicate with his 

550
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,030
parents these issues too much and the

551
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,760
going on with that story that I put in 
the movie and that was to protect the 

552
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,370
company's gone.
Yeah.

553
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,010
Yeah.
Somebody loses a child.

554
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,240
I don't want to go into a family history
and all these other things that we found

555
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:00,410
out.
Um,

556
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,560
but yeah,
it's definitely hard for you for doing 

557
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:05,560
that.
That's a,

558
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,370
they gave his father a million dollars 
to go in front to,

559
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,700
to continue this education to continue a
lying to people basically.

560
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,400
Well that makes sense because that's why
he had this thought in his head,

561
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:21,401
like he wouldn't even consider the fact 
that these kids are on psychoactive 

562
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:25,301
drugs and he would.
Those had nothing to do with the fact 

563
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:25,660
that his brain was fucked up.
Like,

564
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,340
come on man,
I got to know.

565
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,810
You don't know.
Those drugs are,

566
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,620
are dangerous to anybody.
There's a hundred years,

567
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:36,850
100 million people walking around on 
psych meds and there's really no proof 

568
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:36,850
that they actually work.

569
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,830
There's really no scientific proof that 
they improve any sort of a problem with.

570
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Is that true though?
Because they definitely do help some 

571
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,051
people.
I think they definitely helped some 

572
00:24:50,051 --> 00:24:50,051
people,
but there's actually nothing.

573
00:24:50,051 --> 00:24:50,051
There's no,
you know,

574
00:24:50,051 --> 00:24:50,280
if you're looking at,
you can look at a,

575
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,010
like I said,
anecdotal evidence for anything.

576
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,440
I took this and I got bigger.
I got stronger,

577
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:59,770
um,
scientific proof now because there's no 

578
00:24:59,770 --> 00:24:59,960
real markers in the brain.
There's no test I can give you to see if

579
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:00,900
you feel better.
Right.

580
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,750
There's no depression tests.
Exactly.

581
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:03,770
I think,
yeah,

582
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:06,170
that's the issue there,
but there is,

583
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,980
there's a lot of evidence that Ssri 
helped improve mood.

584
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:10,690
Right?
And they do,

585
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,570
yeah.
Yeah.

586
00:25:11,571 --> 00:25:13,810
But there's also a,
a.

587
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:18,810
While they improve mood and some people,
a lot of people commit suicide on them 

588
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,930
because they are so low down.
Like you'll see a person that's like 

589
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:22,930
severely severely depressed.

590
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,530
They can't even get out of bed to kill 
themselves.

591
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:29,531
And then they put them on an Ssri and 
now they haven't just enough energy to 

592
00:25:29,531 --> 00:25:29,850
say fuck it,
you know,

593
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,570
that's what's so crazy.
Also with steroids though,

594
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:38,480
when you know that kid,
he just stopped cold Turkey,

595
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,660
you know,
he stopped the steroids right away and 

596
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:43,660
then uh,
went on those other drugs,

597
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,060
but stopping him,
as you mentioned earlier,

598
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:47,360
like if you're 48 years old,
you want to get the energy boost from.

599
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:51,050
I'm just like coming off,
I'm actually a puts you at a lower state

600
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,590
than you ever were before.
So with that kid coming off him,

601
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,790
his testosterone levels are probably 
low.

602
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:58,910
Is estrone levels probably came up.
It's probably just insanely depressed.

603
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,090
That does get you depressed.
And that's a big issue with fighters and

604
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:04,580
football players and people that have 
had a lot of head injuries.

605
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:10,090
Dr Mark Gordon,
who was in your documentary for a brief 

606
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,090
amount of time,
I saw his face in there.

607
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,870
He works with a lot of traumatic brain 
injury people.

608
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,180
And one of the things that he finds 
them,

609
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,130
they almost all have low testosterone.
Sure.

610
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,200
Something about getting the pituitary 
gland rattled.

611
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,050
Whether it's through an IED or football 
collisions or head kicks,

612
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:26,051
whatever the fuck it is.
Almost all of those guys have low 

613
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:26,051
testosterone.
They just like super.

614
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:26,500
It's almost like getting kicked in the 
balls.

615
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,690
You ever posed the question to this 
athlete,

616
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,580
a Nevada state athletic commission,
you know,

617
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:32,020
the,
uh,

618
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,790
all these guys are getting pounded in 
the head and the UFC,

619
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,230
they can,
they get punched a lot.

620
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:37,740
They get kicked a lot.
Um,

621
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,620
had head trauma is a on the job injury,
but you're not allowed to treat.

622
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:44,220
And on the job

623
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,380
injury with something that works like 
human growth hormone,

624
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:51,381
like you'll talk to mark Gordon,
he'll tell you one of the best things 

625
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:54,381
they can do to treat these concussions 
and traumatic brain injuries is to 

626
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:56,130
supplement with human growth hormone.
So you can't treat those injuries.

627
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:01,430
You can get them.
And if you're a normal everyday person 

628
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,681
you can be treated,
but you can't be treated if you are a 

629
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:03,681
fighter or if you're an athlete,
you know.

630
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:05,850
And if there's a thing with fighters as 
well,

631
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:09,120
now they're not allowing them to use ivs
to rehydrate.

632
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:14,260
And the reason why is because ivs and 
use of ivs can mask some of the signs of

633
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:19,611
steroids,
so something that was ultimately very 

634
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:21,420
beneficial.
Now you can't use because people can use

635
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:26,421
it to cheat.
So even though it's just to rehydrate 

636
00:27:26,421 --> 00:27:26,940
you and even if they can prove that it's
just rehydrating you,

637
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:31,941
they can,
you can't use it because it could be 

638
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,221
something that you're doing because 
you're actually probably healthier for 

639
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:37,761
the fighter like a day before to have 
all those electrolytes in them and 

640
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:37,761
everything.

641
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:41,450
And I'm right.
I mean rather than fight completed as 

642
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:41,450
soon as you're cutting weight.
Yeah,

643
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,020
that's the argument.
But there's some arguments.

644
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,430
Some people,
I don't know if it's,

645
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:49,431
I haven't researched it,
but there's some people that say that 

646
00:27:49,431 --> 00:27:49,500
it's actually more effective to 
rehydrate orally.

647
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,720
I've heard that's bullshit.
I've heard that's true.

648
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:56,721
I don't know what's right.
I'd have to talk to an expert about 

649
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:56,980
that.
So do a google lead hard.

650
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:02,030
It's hard to be a,
it's hard to be way on top of all that 

651
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,030
though.
Like when you're,

652
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,030
um,
these,

653
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,670
these fighters,
they travel,

654
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,600
you know,
in power lifting.

655
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:05,950
We do the same thing,
we use ivy bags,

656
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:09,450
so to rehydrate and guys we'll do 30 
pound weight cuts and stuff like that.

657
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,630
So you do 30 pound weight cuts so that 
you competed a lower level to power 

658
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:14,630
lift.
Yeah,

659
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:14,830
lighter weight classes.

660
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,140
You're not getting hit in the head 
though,

661
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:18,570
the right.
The rehydration orally.

662
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:23,571
If it's not effective as if you.
If you fight in a dehydrated state and 

663
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:24,450
you get rattled,
your brain bleeds.

664
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
Right.
I say that almost all the deaths and pro

665
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:31,521
boxing,
almost all of them were in the lighter 

666
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:31,521
weight divisions.
Wow.

667
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:31,521
Even though the heavyweights hit 
hardest,

668
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:34,340
they didn't cut weight so they didn't 
have all that same problem.

669
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,000
Is there any rules in UFC about cutting 
weight?

670
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:39,900
How much percentage cut there should be?
If you can make the way you can fight,

671
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:44,930
you just have to make the weight.
Four o'clock on Friday and then 

672
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,141
Saturday,
you know whenever your fight is the 

673
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:48,141
fight,
don't start till four.

674
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:48,480
Do you think this thing will change the 
game?

675
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:53,870
I hope it does.
I also think the UFC probably is going 

676
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,611
to have to add more weight classes 
eventually because there's not enough 

677
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:56,611
way classes.

678
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:57,930
There's some big gaps between like one 
85 and two.

679
00:28:57,931 --> 00:28:59,490
Oh five.
That's 20 pound weight class.

680
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,550
That's a giant gap.
No,

681
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,020
I think that for fighters that are like 
tweeners,

682
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,080
you know,
there's guys that are like a little bit 

683
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,431
too big for this way,
but a little bit too small for that 

684
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:10,431
weight.
They could use a one 95.

685
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:12,960
I think every 10 pounds we've saved like
be an advantage to actual,

686
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,050
you know,
to the fans and need to be more,

687
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,370
more champions,
more championship fights,

688
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:22,371
more money and then also the,
there could be some reasonable like a 

689
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:24,510
champion versus champion.
Like one 95 versus two.

690
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:25,710
Oh,
five was pretty reasonable.

691
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,780
Whereas like one 85 versus two.
Oh five.

692
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:29,730
Like massive,
big fucking jump for those guys.

693
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,960
I think to answer your question about 
steroids in the UFC,

694
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:38,370
I think we have to kind of define.
I think the real problem is what we said

695
00:29:38,371 --> 00:29:41,780
earlier that the word steroid is it,
it's like

696
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:47,030
did it's a dirty word,
but if it's far as like supplements are 

697
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,950
supplements be legal Kinda.
Everybody says supplements,

698
00:29:49,951 --> 00:29:50,500
illegal.
Fuck.

699
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:52,380
We have muscle farm that sponsors the 
UFC.

700
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,850
They sell a ton of Shit and supposed to 
help you recover.

701
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:56,650
And protein powders.
All this jazz.

702
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,470
Think about creatine.
Absolutely.

703
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:01,900
Clinically proven to enhance 
performance.

704
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,390
There's a lot of stuff that you can get 
that's legal.

705
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,560
Even caffeine.
Yeah,

706
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,620
absolutely.
It's all stuff that gives you like a 

707
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,571
very slight bump.
I'm very slight edge and then taken all 

708
00:30:12,571 --> 00:30:15,661
together synergistically.
Like we'll supplement like says your 

709
00:30:15,661 --> 00:30:16,270
diet.
So if you have a,

710
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:21,271
you know,
a diet where you're not getting enough 

711
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:21,271
stuff in it.
Like I was just reading this,

712
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:24,331
I posted something on facebook the other
day and people went crazy because I 

713
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:26,761
posted this thing about fish oil and the
effect that it's officially not being 

714
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:27,040
really scientifically proven.

715
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,320
You know,
it's like if you eat fish twice a week,

716
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:30,760
then you don't need it.
You know,

717
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:31,780
and everybody goes crazy.
No,

718
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:32,590
I need it.
And people,

719
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:37,120
people are convinced the supplement 
industry is a $20 million up fish oil.

720
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:39,240
I'm convinced to that I need to have 20 
pills a day.

721
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,280
It's a $24,
billion dollar industry and people are 

722
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:44,280
convinced that they need these things.
You know,

723
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,360
there's some science behind fish oil and
Krill oil though.

724
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:48,130
Especially the anti inflammatory 
process.

725
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:50,380
The inflammatory at a.
At a high dose.

726
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:50,670
Yes.
Yeah.

727
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,710
That's what I do.
I take a lot official.

728
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:57,780
It makes sense for that for if you're 
trying to prevent heart disease and all 

729
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,570
these things like that.
They're saying that,

730
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,290
you know,
there's really.

731
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:04,140
The link isn't there and if you eat 
fatty fish you'll probably get enough in

732
00:31:04,141 --> 00:31:07,720
your diet.
Really good fish like salmon that's high

733
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:09,010
in those healthy fats.

734
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:09,750
They're actually.
Yeah.

735
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,820
Everybody should eat that like once or 
twice a week for Sushi.

736
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,080
Yeah.
I mean I believe I,

737
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,340
you know,
I'll read,

738
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,440
I'll read all this shit about 
supplements,

739
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,940
right?
All this stuff.

740
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:21,610
I'll read like okay this doesn't work at
this barely works and whatever.

741
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:26,850
And the next thing I do,
I go open up my cabinet and I take 20 

742
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,060
pills because like,
because it doesn't fucking work,

743
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:33,061
I don't know.
I mean it's like that placebo effect is 

744
00:31:33,061 --> 00:31:33,061
really,
really strong and you know,

745
00:31:33,061 --> 00:31:33,880
certain things I take because I.
Oh,

746
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:35,340
I heard this works for,
you know,

747
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,380
Alpha lipoic acid when you eat carbs 
that will help shuttle it in your 

748
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:40,380
muscles.
Will do.

749
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:40,870
I know that that even works like,
I don't know,

750
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,210
Philip Polk assets supposed to be 
clinically proven,

751
00:31:43,211 --> 00:31:48,211
isn't it?
I think there's studies on Alpha lipoic 

752
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:48,670
acid studies on everything.
Then you get into like the whole thing,

753
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,330
it's,
oh,

754
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:50,260
it's an antioxidant.

755
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:50,800
And you're like,
well,

756
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:52,540
wait a second.
What the fuck's an antioxidant?

757
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,010
What do I need?
Why do I need it?

758
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:54,550
You know,
like you,

759
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,450
you forget even why you needed to have 
certain berries.

760
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:01,700
They're like the best antioxidant and 
birds and birds.

761
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,720
And then they find out there's studies 
that say that eating antioxidants in 

762
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,991
your diet doesn't really matter.
It doesn't translate into antioxidants 

763
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:11,830
in the bloodstream and all this stuff 
like that.

764
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:16,831
So you gotta look at it like they say 
you need certain precursors to be able 

765
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:20,251
to digest these things.
So ice cream too fucking complicated.

766
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,350
You need to be your own doctor and I 
need to do your own research.

767
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:26,950
I find I get big benefits when I eat a 
lot of vegetables.

768
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,820
I feel a big benefit when I drink like 
these Kale shakes the cow.

769
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,660
No,
I thought you were a tough guy.

770
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:39,010
It's healthy now.
He just makes fun of cattle.

771
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,980
The time I was making fun of

772
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,450
one of my friends because he's like,
he's like,

773
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:43,940
I went over here and I had a Kale Salad 
is super skinny.

774
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:44,510
I'm like,
dude,

775
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:45,760
a Kale Salad.
Come on,

776
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,770
just make up a lie.
Say That you had a fucking 20 ounce 

777
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:50,770
ribeye.
Well you could have both.

778
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,760
I just think in general that's way to 
go.

779
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,000
Like you know,
we need,

780
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:58,090
we need vitamins and vitamins and 
minerals and we need all these things in

781
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:03,251
our diet.
And so vegetables are probably the most 

782
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:06,191
abundant source of great nutrients in 
vegetables and fruits and things like 

783
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:06,191
that.
So like,

784
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:07,870
why wouldn't you eat them like it seems 
like it's,

785
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,930
I feel different when I eat them when I 
have one of those Kale shakes with giant

786
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:16,931
clumps of fucking ginger in it and four 
cloves of garlic and an apple and 

787
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:16,931
celery.
It's amazing.

788
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:18,140
Cucumber could feel like fucking 
superman.

789
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,270
You got to choke it down,
tastes like shit.

790
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,180
But when you choking it down once,
once you get it in,

791
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,210
you're like,
whoo,

792
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,870
you feel like you kinda like a double 
shot of espresso,

793
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,400
but you don't,
you don't feel like jittery.

794
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,490
He just feel like crap.
I remember talking to you about.

795
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:32,130
Um,
uh,

796
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,160
it was kind of amazing and it was kind 
of a good example for me talking to you 

797
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,840
about like you were talking about going 
on the road and traveling and you said,

798
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,880
Oh man,
I need to find a whole foods.

799
00:33:40,881 --> 00:33:45,881
I don't eat that process shit.
And like to me that was like a real 

800
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:48,701
eyeopener to find that.
Like somebody as busy as yourself goes 

801
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:51,470
out of their way to find like good 
healthy food and yeah.

802
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,480
And it's probably more important almost 
for him because he's on a plane or in a 

803
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,480
car or some shit all the time.

804
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,300
It's just you can only go so many.
I always bring a vitamin packs of those 

805
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,680
pure athlete packs I bring with me to 
supplement when I'm on the road,

806
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,720
I always make sure you get a lot of 
salads.

807
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,840
Like I get salads before every meal,
whatever I'm eating.

808
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:11,540
I eat salads first.
But it's hard.

809
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,240
It's hard to find,
you know,

810
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:16,300
food that's not just full of garbage and
contaminated.

811
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:16,910
It is.
Yeah.

812
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,560
I mean like you go to subway,
I mean,

813
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:23,561
yeah,
you get bread and there's an there and 

814
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:23,561
you kind of can fill you up.
But like,

815
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:27,580
you know,
all the different preservatives and 

816
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:27,620
nonsense and process bullshit.
Fucking kills your stomach.

817
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,480
All the gluten.
Oh,

818
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:32,800
it's Chris's girlfriend eats tons of 
vegetables and Cece,

819
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:36,600
she's a super hot.
So maybe that's the formula.

820
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:41,610
Yeah,
we can all be super hot chicks if Bruce 

821
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,780
Jenner had only known about the Kale 
Salad,

822
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,510
the um,
but the key,

823
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:45,560
the key,
like you said,

824
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:49,670
is good nutrition,
good solid things in your diet.

825
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,100
I think when you're dealing with things 
like UFC fighters,

826
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,250
you're dealing with a level of 
performance that they're requiring of 

827
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,491
their body.
That's so extreme because even boxers 

828
00:35:00,491 --> 00:35:02,210
like the average boxer,
they do their boxing workout.

829
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,240
They'll spar a couple of times a week 
depending upon the philosophy of the 

830
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,240
camp.
In the morning.

831
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,561
They usually run like maybe they'll have
a strength and conditioning session 

832
00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:12,410
instead of a run,
but they're doing two workouts a day and

833
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,810
one of them is pretty mild.
It's not that big a deal,

834
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,730
so they're,
you know,

835
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:20,630
they can get through six to eight week 
camp and most likely they never pull out

836
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:25,631
of fights.
It's very rare that a championship 

837
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:25,631
fight,
manny Pacquiao almost pulled out a floyd

838
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:27,760
mayweather fight because he apparently 
tours from,

839
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:32,950
but he wound up fighting.
Now there's a lawsuit because we pushed 

840
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:32,950
through the injury.

841
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:32,950
Jesus,
you hear about all that.

842
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,540
Different people are suing them because 
they bet a lot of money on them.

843
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,790
They didn't know that his right shoulder
fucked up and he had surgery right after

844
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:43,791
the fight,
but for the UFC fucking 20 percent of 

845
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:46,890
the fights fall apart at least.
And guys fight injured all the time.

846
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,500
Even conor mcgregor when he fought 
against Chad Mendez after,

847
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:52,440
although pulled out a fight,
mcgregor been getting stem cell shots in

848
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,090
his knee.
He was fucked.

849
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,290
Jason,
he was thinking he couldn't,

850
00:35:55,291 --> 00:36:00,291
he didn't wrestle the entire camp 
because he was thinking there's no way 

851
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:00,291
because like I can't,
it'll fall apart.

852
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,220
Was a good fight.
Grateful that was good.

853
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,880
It's to be the toughest sport.
I mean,

854
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:04,500
I'd say that thing,
so people go like,

855
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:06,330
oh,
basketball players are the best athletes

856
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,190
or these guys are the best athletes.
I just think that,

857
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:13,191
uh,
the amount of maybe genetically 

858
00:36:13,191 --> 00:36:13,191
basketball,
you know,

859
00:36:13,191 --> 00:36:15,750
but the amount of effort it takes to 
step into the octagon,

860
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:17,370
the amount of mental focus,
it's like,

861
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,510
to me that's amazing.

862
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,440
It's like family.
I agree by it.

863
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,830
Basketball I think has the best six foot
six athletes.

864
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,940
Yeah.
Well fighting is not made up.

865
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:30,390
It's something that is part of us.
Everything else is made up.

866
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:31,230
Football,
basketball,

867
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,340
baseball,
made up,

868
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:33,000
sports.
You know,

869
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,580
when it came along we were like,
this is the only sport.

870
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:38,010
To me that makes sense.
It really makes sense.

871
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:43,011
It's like,
but the movements and the art are all 

872
00:36:43,011 --> 00:36:45,051
made up.
Had to figure out what's the most 

873
00:36:45,051 --> 00:36:45,770
effective way of striking and I don't 
want to fuck someone up the fastest.

874
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,430
All of that is where the sport lies,
but I think you're right about the level

875
00:36:50,431 --> 00:36:52,620
of athlete when you see the guys that 
played for the NFL.

876
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:56,280
I mean those are fucking super freak 
motherfuckers.

877
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,870
Will you come in in the UFC soon?
I'm sure.

878
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,400
Well,
if the money becomes right,

879
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,570
that's Jon Jones.

880
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,850
Jon Jones could have probably opted to 
go and play in the NFL.

881
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,160
One hundred percent.
One hundred percent.

882
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,390
His brothers both do.
He could have.

883
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,150
What's crazy is he's not even the 
toughest one in his family.

884
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,980
Both his brothers said they kick his 
ass.

885
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,140
His younger brother and his older 
brother.

886
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,550
That's crazy fucked up family is that 
one of the guys got drafted.

887
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:22,551
One of his brothers got drafted.
I saw him a thermal jumping on each 

888
00:37:22,551 --> 00:37:22,551
other and shit.
They're all kicking the shit out of each

889
00:37:22,551 --> 00:37:22,551
other.
I was like,

890
00:37:22,551 --> 00:37:23,610
Jesus Christ,
a lot of shit.

891
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:25,170
Must've got broken in the house.
Oh yeah.

892
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:30,250
I think that's why it happened and 
that's why he came out so bad ass and 

893
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,380
not afraid of anything about genetics.
I mean like that family,

894
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:36,381
the manning family,
like because these families are just 

895
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:36,381
incredible.
Yeah.

896
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:37,110
Genetics and that goes a long way.
Oh,

897
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:37,730
100 percent.

898
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,730
Everything we're talking about,
you know,

899
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:41,340
Matt Hughes,
a former UFC welterweight champion,

900
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,690
his brother,
his twin,

901
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,910
it looks exactly like them their entire 
lives.

902
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:48,090
They beat the fuck out of each other.
So of course he gets to the UFC with his

903
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:53,091
fucking steely eyed gaze.
He's used to facing himself literally 

904
00:37:53,091 --> 00:37:55,800
like a mirror version of him beating the
fuck out of him his whole life.

905
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,920
Just smashing each other,
running through walls,

906
00:37:58,921 --> 00:38:01,620
like juggernaut summit,
sparring partner.

907
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:03,580
That's what I used to pick people up and
slam them.

908
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,500
Yeah,
there's a.

909
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:06,140
his brother's bigger.
Wow.

910
00:38:06,141 --> 00:38:08,640
His brothers to 65,
Jesus Christ,

911
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,620
his brothers talking all kinds of shit 
that he would,

912
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,150
uh,
he would kick his brother's ass.

913
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,210
I think Jon Jones could probably get up 
to that way.

914
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:15,620
Right?
I mean,

915
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,060
he's probably fighting this whole life,
so we'll.

916
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:20,530
Chandler I think is a bigger guy,
but he's just an inch tall.

917
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,740
Two brothers in the NFL,
right?

918
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,010
Yeah.
Arthur to his brother,

919
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:28,011
arthur is even bigger than chandler.
His brother Arthur is more than 300 

920
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:28,011
pounds.
Man,

921
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:31,760
that's a super athlete family.
His Dad's a patient due to his dad is 

922
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,800
just naturally did very gifted.
It's,

923
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:37,450
it's taken a long time for the sport to 
evolve to where it is.

924
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,640
Um,
you know,

925
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,680
like I'm,
I'm interested to see what will happen 

926
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:43,680
with the female division.
You know,

927
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,710
like Rhonda is just killing everybody 
and she's obviously amazing,

928
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:47,440
but I don't think the girls have caught 
up to where the guys are at.

929
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,400
No,
not yet.

930
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:50,410
But have you seen a yawning and jet 
check?

931
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,640
The strawweight champion?
Do you think Ronda is impressive?

932
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,110
This bitches,
ruth,

933
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:01,950
she's from Poland 1:15,
six time world Moy Thai champion.

934
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,540
The way we did it,
that was a fight companion one,

935
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,220
right?
We watched that girl get busted up.

936
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,530
Jessica Pinay.
Oh my God.

937
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,620
Do you use the ugliest female fight I've
ever seen in my life?

938
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:16,580
This girl's nose was smashed.
A giant gash across her nose and this is

939
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,740
Yolana chick from Poland was just 
beating the fuck out of her.

940
00:39:19,741 --> 00:39:21,970
I was literally to the point where 
you're watching it like saying,

941
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:26,971
please stop this fight.
This fight is a terrible mismatch like 

942
00:39:26,971 --> 00:39:31,450
that.
That chick is lethal cause like when 

943
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,830
Rhonda beats chicks up like she knocked 
out batch with one punch and most of the

944
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:35,370
time she flips chicks on their back and 
arm bars.

945
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,380
I'm in the first round.
This bitch beats the fuck out of checks 

946
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:40,630
for like four rounds.
That's got to be cool.

947
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:44,770
Call that stuff because I saw your 
excitement and it was like so genuine.

948
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,170
You know,
you're so pumped to call that fight.

949
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,800
Ronda fight.
Oh yeah.

950
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:49,840
Oh yeah.

951
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,080
It was a.
You know those.

952
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,540
You could feel it though when you watch 
it.

953
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,280
It was a piece of history.
I felt.

954
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,610
It felt like a.
I feel like where she's at right now,

955
00:39:57,611 --> 00:40:00,400
it's just so strange and rare.
It's like,

956
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:05,430
it's not just calling a fight.
It's like I feel like I'm calling a 

957
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,760
piece of human history in modern day.
Mike Tyson.

958
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,300
She,
yeah.

959
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:09,640
She's like a real Charlie's angels 
character.

960
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Like there's never been like a hot chick
that actually can fuck up a lot of 

961
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,400
dudes.
So it has been faking a movie.

962
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:17,050
Okay.
There's wonder woman changing,

963
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:17,990
you know,
it's like fake.

964
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,260
Someone was pounding on your door.
They'd like 2:00

965
00:40:20,261 --> 00:40:25,261
in the morning like what the fuck?
And you open up the door and it was 

966
00:40:25,261 --> 00:40:25,261
Ronda rousey angry.
You'd be like,

967
00:40:25,261 --> 00:40:26,590
Oh shit,
your heart would drop you like,

968
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:30,790
this bitch is going to beat my ass right
now to get my sleep or something.

969
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,430
She was outside.
She could,

970
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,430
you know,
break in your house.

971
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:37,240
You could kick your ass.
Like that's real.

972
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,320
And her confidence is through the roof.
That's just saw something today where 

973
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,030
she's like,
can you beat floyd mayweather in a fight

974
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:44,050
or whatever?
And she's like,

975
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:45,190
yeah,
and I know rules fight.

976
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:46,270
I could beat anybody.
Well,

977
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:48,550
she said,
I'm not in a boxing match.

978
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:49,630
He's like,
he's a boxer.

979
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:51,380
I'm sure he would beat me in a boxing 
match.

980
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:53,080
She goes,
but I don't have matches.

981
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,660
I have fights.
Right.

982
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,110
You know,
she's just letting them know.

983
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,420
She would ask.
She got ahold of him.

984
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:00,370
He's going flying,
that's for sure.

985
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:02,470
There's no way he's going to be able to 
understand what she's doing.

986
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,570
If he tied up with her,
he really,

987
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,490
he,
he'd have so much to think about it.

988
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:08,170
I'm sure she trained with guys all the 
time.

989
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,950
I've seen her but been there in the gym 
with her flipping guys and I've seen her

990
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:13,720
tap guys.
I've seen it with my own eyes.

991
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,910
Tap good guys.
Get them an arm bars.

992
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,340
There's a video of her with a and trying
and try.

993
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,420
It was a video with her with Luke 
rockhold and you know Luke,

994
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:24,670
let's or get into a position,
but she finishes them.

995
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,960
You know Luke rockhold fucking giant is 
big fights at one 85 cuts,

996
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:30,330
a lot of weight to get down there.
Something.

997
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,770
He's strong.
He's a stud and she finished him with an

998
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:33,290
arm bar.
I'm like,

999
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,370
Whoa,

1000
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,470
it's not even embarrassing.
She's the fucking best.

1001
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,790
She's pretty Goddamn with it.
But was like,

1002
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:44,180
what about steroids and that division 
with the issue that I talk about Cyborg.

1003
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:50,080
You got guys like,
I know you talk about it a lot in your 

1004
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,080
podcasts.
You get into um,

1005
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,770
steroids here and there and um,
you know,

1006
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:56,830
a lot of guys don't eat.
They don't even look like they're doing 

1007
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:56,830
it like Gilbert Melendez or hoists 
Gracie,

1008
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,920
you know,
it's like you can't tell anymore.

1009
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:03,090
Well,
voice actually did look like he was 

1010
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:03,090
doing it when he got popped.
When you got pop.

1011
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:03,770
We were there for that fight and I was 
there with my friend Eddie,

1012
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,060
Eddie Bravo,
and that he was like,

1013
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:10,061
dude,
when is the last time you saw hoists 

1014
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:11,711
with traps traps?
Like he was pretty jacked and is way 

1015
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:12,260
heavier than normal.
He was like,

1016
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:13,940
he usually is around one 70 something.

1017
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,940
He was well over 200 pounds.
But I think because of the benefit of 

1018
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:18,940
steroids isn't just with weightlifting.
It's like overall,

1019
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,921
you know,
overall recovery overall energy and 

1020
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:26,180
health,
taking a cocktail.

1021
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:28,070
Probably a little growth hormone.
Little tests.

1022
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,420
Little Epo.
Yes,

1023
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,610
a hundred percent.
I think the a big thing too,

1024
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:36,710
the vibrancy just having energy,
just having enthusiasm and they don't 

1025
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,560
test for Hipo do they?
Oh yes they do.

1026
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,400
[inaudible] got popped for when he 
fought against mighty mouse Johnson for 

1027
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,450
the flyway title and he's still 
suspended because the others.

1028
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,100
But there's guys,
because I know that test is pretty.

1029
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,200
It's a,
it's a little wishy washy.

1030
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,100
When we did bigger,
stronger,

1031
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:54,620
faster,
we looked heavily into the HIPO test and

1032
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:56,900
there's a guy that came up with a 
definitive test,

1033
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,640
a definitive like just either you're on 
it or you're not a synthetically.

1034
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,130
And um,
the,

1035
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:07,320
he got a letter from the Olympic 
Committee saying from the US Olympic you

1036
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:10,790
soc saying we can't use your test 
because we'll be out.

1037
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,030
It's unfair.
Uh,

1038
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,360
you know,
will be,

1039
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,560
it will be unfair to the Americans 
because the other foreign countries are 

1040
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,560
relying goosey tests.
Exactly.

1041
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,820
That's hilarious.
So what they're saying is we're going to

1042
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:28,190
have to allow a certain amount of 
cheating to when exactly.

1043
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,130
That's really what they're saying.
Well,

1044
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,700
we have to be able to cheat just as much
as the rest of them.

1045
00:43:31,701 --> 00:43:32,650
If you look at the,
uh,

1046
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,820
you don't want to do these testosterone 
ratios,

1047
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:39,710
like 99 point nine percent of human 
beings should be at a one to one ratio.

1048
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,760
Epi,
testosterone,

1049
00:43:40,761 --> 00:43:42,980
the testosterone and kind of thing.
And um,

1050
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:47,440
they allow it to be like four to one or 
six to six and now they'll have four.

1051
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:52,510
Right?
So you can take a little bit and be 

1052
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,371
under the radar.
We've had guys pop it like 50 to one 

1053
00:43:54,371 --> 00:43:54,410
back.
I remember when I was doing.

1054
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:00,320
That's awesome.
They like gorillas don't want to see a 

1055
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,940
non tested UFC and have the guy's way,
like over 300 pounds.

1056
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:10,210
They go one minute on and five minutes 
off you go and just let him just kill 

1057
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,890
each other.
They just fucking slug it out.

1058
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:18,150
I like the way you can't train.
That's the other thing you can't train 

1059
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,240
for fighting because that's an unfair 
advantage to then you know,

1060
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,040
how to fight and it ruins the fun.
Well,

1061
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:24,470
the other person's training too,
so it's not an unfair advantage.

1062
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:26,330
So you can lift weights.
That's about it.

1063
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,970
That's it.
I think that uh,

1064
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,040
there's,
there's a benefit to being a certain

1065
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,040
weight,
but there's a negative effect when you 

1066
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,471
get over a certain weight.
And I think to 40 is around the right 

1067
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:39,471
weight.
I think a body weight,

1068
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:41,350
well our body,
your,

1069
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,340
how lean you are is probably a big,
a big thing too.

1070
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:49,341
I think once you get under 10 percent,
I think is when you start to get in 

1071
00:44:49,341 --> 00:44:49,341
trouble,
unless you're used to that,

1072
00:44:49,341 --> 00:44:50,580
unless your body's always under 10 
percent,

1073
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:52,710
then you could probably operate at that 
body,

1074
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,140
at that being that lien for awhile,
you know,

1075
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,200
I just think if guys have good defensive
skills and they can avoid the bum rush 

1076
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,710
for the first couple rounds guy.
So like over to 40,

1077
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,930
they have a real hard time getting into 
the third,

1078
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:05,070
fourth,
and fifth rounds.

1079
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:10,430
It's just too much mass to carry around 
two bones and the muscle and all the 

1080
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:10,500
blood's being that big.

1081
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,030
Yeah,
the oxygen requirements.

1082
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,450
So I think like a guy like Cain 
Velasquez is always about to 40,

1083
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,930
known for a spectacular cardio.
Fabrice overdo them,

1084
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:21,030
same thing somewhere in the two 
thirties.

1085
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,170
That seems to be a shocking.
And it was crazy.

1086
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:27,960
Came fucked up.
I mean Cain is known for his cardio,

1087
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:31,380
so I think he just got a little cocky 
and decided not to go to Mexico City,

1088
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,620
but Mexico City is so I,
I can't believe how high it is.

1089
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,800
7,000
plus feet above altitude or trouble 

1090
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,680
breathing.
I worked on the gym and a fucking 

1091
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:42,680
elliptical machine that was breathing 
heavy and it's almost like you can't be.

1092
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,240
These guys are gonna fight,
but for Breesa was real smart.

1093
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:50,241
He moved to a place that's a thousand 
feet above that for like a month and a 

1094
00:45:50,241 --> 00:45:55,220
half.
And cain was only there for two weeks 

1095
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:55,220
and his improved all the ratio.
You know,

1096
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,160
I,
I see a lot of time at Gold's gym.

1097
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:57,090
He,
uh,

1098
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,710
he's improved vastly,
you know,

1099
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,180
every,
every step of the way,

1100
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:01,560
which is nice to see too.
Well,

1101
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:06,561
he was such a high level Jujitsu guy.
He was one of the best Jujitsu fighters 

1102
00:46:06,561 --> 00:46:07,620
in the world.
And to get that good at Jujitsu you have

1103
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:12,621
to have an intense mind for learning.
And so he just took that and applied it 

1104
00:46:12,621 --> 00:46:15,060
to boxing and kickboxing and just once 
he figured that out,

1105
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:20,340
everybody was fucked because you don't 
want to go to the ground without that 

1106
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,040
beat some awesome fighters.
Eco,

1107
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:22,920
the first guy,
right?

1108
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,310
He's the first guy to submit fader or 
first got to submit cane,

1109
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,280
you know,
that's,

1110
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:28,890
that's a pretty God damn spectacular 
resume.

1111
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:34,080
All he has to do is beat a few more guys
and he is arguably one of the greatest 

1112
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,590
heavyweight,
if not the greatest of all time share.

1113
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,720
It's interesting that you bring up those
two fighters.

1114
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,720
It makes me Kinda think like maybe 
there's a upper weight limit of muscle 

1115
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,501
mass that you can carry around because 
like neither one of those guys is real 

1116
00:46:45,501 --> 00:46:48,171
lean.
So maybe around the 200 pound mark is 

1117
00:46:48,171 --> 00:46:48,300
probably almost like the cutoff if you 
start being more jacked than that,

1118
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,700
maybe you can't sustain it for three 
rounds.

1119
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,620
Yeah,
I think it's a matter of durability.

1120
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:57,621
Like you want to be big enough so that 
you could take shots but you can't be 

1121
00:46:57,621 --> 00:46:58,510
too big because you just can't carry it 
into those.

1122
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,700
Especially a guy like Cain,
although Coleman and occur,

1123
00:47:02,701 --> 00:47:04,390
we're kind of the exception,
but they were.

1124
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:08,550
They were on everything.
Bathtubs full of shit.

1125
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:09,960
Brock Lesnar,
animal,

1126
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,940
just an animal in such a freak of 
nature.

1127
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:17,060
I still maintain to this day that if 
somebody got a hold of Brock lesnar 

1128
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,240
early on and said,
listen to me and you can be the best 

1129
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,170
heavyweight fighter ever like a for us 
as a hobby or a matt hume,

1130
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,390
like someone who's a real expert in mma 
who barack listened to and just said,

1131
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:28,570
look,
this we're going to do first.

1132
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:33,680
The first thing we're going to do is 
we're going to nothing but striking for 

1133
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,420
like a couple of years and you're not.
You're not going to get hit.

1134
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:39,600
I don't want you to develop any bad 
habits and you're not hitting anybody 

1135
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,211
either.
All you're gonna do is you're going to 

1136
00:47:42,211 --> 00:47:42,211
do movement with people.
We're going to hit you.

1137
00:47:42,211 --> 00:47:45,940
Get to do pad work,
you're going to do technique work and 

1138
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,410
we're going to have that shit built into
your your neurons and we're gonna.

1139
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,390
We're gonna,
have all these movements.

1140
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:54,510
They're going to be a part of your 
natural movement and if you're willing 

1141
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:57,181
to do that,
you're going to develop a base and that 

1142
00:47:57,181 --> 00:47:59,521
base will translate into success,
but otherwise you're going to be scared 

1143
00:47:59,521 --> 00:48:01,000
of getting hit and that's what his 
problem always was.

1144
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:06,120
He would always get tagged by like 
someone like Shane car or more Alistair 

1145
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,720
overeem and you could see just he didn't
have enough time in there.

1146
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,750
He doesn't like it either.
Yeah.

1147
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,440
You got to spar with guys who barely 
touch.

1148
00:48:11,441 --> 00:48:16,441
You were like,
they're not hurting you and you don't 

1149
00:48:16,441 --> 00:48:16,441
hurt them,
and that's in the beginning.

1150
00:48:16,441 --> 00:48:18,040
That's like the most critical because 
otherwise you're gonna,

1151
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:23,041
miss giant chunks of the development 
because you just get a fucking swearing 

1152
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:27,380
piece that he was able to get to where 
he did during all those years of wwe 

1153
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:28,530
first.
Yeah,

1154
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,880
like just fucking.
What if he just went on?

1155
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:32,110
If we adjust,
like you said,

1156
00:48:32,111 --> 00:48:33,430
gone straight in.
Oh,

1157
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:38,431
he would have been the best,
but he was still a heavyweight champion 

1158
00:48:38,431 --> 00:48:40,391
of the fucking world.
Knocked out randy coture beat the shit 

1159
00:48:40,391 --> 00:48:41,140
out of Frank Mir.
He's a stud.

1160
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,010
I love watching him.
He just had to.

1161
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:48,380
I was.
I was kind of bummed but happy when he 

1162
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,540
decided to quit mma recently had a.
He had a moment where it's was trying to

1163
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:54,541
figure out whether it's going to keep 
going the wwe or give one more shot at 

1164
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:55,720
the UFC and I know he talked to Dana,
he talked to the UFC.

1165
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,020
He was really thinking about it,
but ultimately you don't want to see him

1166
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:01,930
go down a bad path of like being the guy
that gets,

1167
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:03,330
you know,
concussion is.

1168
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,820
I think that was a big one who's worried
about posting concussion syndrome?

1169
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:10,180
Like Joseph Valtellina use the glory 
welterweight champion.

1170
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:13,060
He just stepped down and relinquish his 
title because of concussions,

1171
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:16,390
like concussions in MMA or a big fucking
issue.

1172
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,700
And you don't hear about it.
How do you feel about like,

1173
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:20,240
I watch a lot of fights where,
you know,

1174
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,530
we want to see him go on,
you just want to see your health.

1175
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,390
Some guys will get,
don't stop it,

1176
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:28,120
don't stop it.
I'm going to get pounded and come back.

1177
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:29,770
And they come right back.
And it's like,

1178
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:31,510
oh well,
good thing they didn't call it,

1179
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,800
you know,
great job,

1180
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:37,801
Herb Dean or whoever the ref is.
And then other times guys get pounded 

1181
00:49:37,801 --> 00:49:41,190
and uh,
they get pounded 10 times in a row and 

1182
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:41,190
then they're out.

1183
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:41,190
And then it's like,
well,

1184
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,590
they didn't need the 10 shots to be out.
You know,

1185
00:49:42,591 --> 00:49:45,160
it's why the fight is actually 
happening.

1186
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:49,090
I always root for the guy to come back,
but after the fights over,

1187
00:49:49,091 --> 00:49:52,120
like if I'm analyzing it from a rational
standpoint,

1188
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:53,080
I'm always like,
oh,

1189
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,520
stop.
It is in trouble.

1190
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:55,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

1191
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,490
It's,
it's not good at your ring side.

1192
00:49:57,491 --> 00:50:02,491
I mean,
it must be a little scary at times when 

1193
00:50:02,491 --> 00:50:02,491
people are blasted.
Right.

1194
00:50:02,491 --> 00:50:03,280
Some of the knockouts are,
there's been some knockouts.

1195
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:05,230
We'd probably see the eyes and 
everything.

1196
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:06,340
Right.
Yeah.

1197
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:11,670
How did you get into that?
Like where you were you fighting before 

1198
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:13,960
way before your wedding,
way before you had a really big interest

1199
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:14,980
in it?
Yeah,

1200
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:15,610
well I,
I,

1201
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:20,020
um,
I had stopped competing in like 1988.

1202
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:25,290
That's when I got into comedy and maybe 
89 was probably like my last kickboxing 

1203
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:29,971
fights and then I went into standup and 
then I just trained recreationally until

1204
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:31,550
like around [inaudible] 93.

1205
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,730
The UFC came around.
I think I saw the first,

1206
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:38,731
a tape,
I saw a tape of it at 94 and then I was 

1207
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:38,731
like,
Holy Shit,

1208
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:40,970
what does this Jujitsu style?
We were there from day one to it.

1209
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,070
I watched that first paper view live.
I remember that like crazy to wanting to

1210
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,490
get a chance.
I saw it on tape.

1211
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,200
Someone talked about it at the gym and I
was like,

1212
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,370
what is going on?
They you believe it,

1213
00:50:50,371 --> 00:50:53,300
it's like a dream come true for us.
So that was a commercial floor.

1214
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:54,260
I'm like,
oh my God.

1215
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,760
That was crazy.
Back in the day.

1216
00:50:55,790 --> 00:51:00,790
And remember it used to be in the faces 
of death section of the videos are for 

1217
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,260
like a long time.
It went completely away.

1218
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:05,990
Well that's when I came in.
I came in while I was banned.

1219
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:11,020
I started working in [inaudible] 97.
So I started doing the post fight 

1220
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,440
interviews and 97 while I was a sitcom.

1221
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,420
These radio,
I would go on the weekends,

1222
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:16,370
fly off the fucking bum,
fuck,

1223
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:20,390
Alabama is a great book of blood in the 
cage that outlines all that stuff and it

1224
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:25,391
outlines like how a Dane.
I got into it and they went to an event 

1225
00:51:25,391 --> 00:51:25,391
and he was like,
this just sucks.

1226
00:51:25,391 --> 00:51:27,350
They don't even sell tee shirts.
They don't know what's going on.

1227
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:28,850
We need to like take this over,
you know,

1228
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:30,170
that kind of thing.
It's really cool.

1229
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:33,470
Yeah.
They bought it in 2001 I think.

1230
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:38,530
And uh,
I came in in 2002 and started doing the 

1231
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,471
commentary.
I remember it when it got in trouble 

1232
00:51:41,471 --> 00:51:41,471
before the,
uh,

1233
00:51:41,471 --> 00:51:45,070
the ultimate fighter.
I actually worked for wwe and Vince 

1234
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:50,320
Mcmahon,
I remember being in limbo of Vince 

1235
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:50,320
Mcmahon being like,
dude,

1236
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:50,320
it's like they're trying to sell it.
You should buy it.

1237
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,600
And he's like,
he's,

1238
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,240
I don't know.

1239
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:56,050
And then two years later they tried to 
unsuccessfully start some sort of a.

1240
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,900
and I may think,
but I think Vince has been amended.

1241
00:51:59,420 --> 00:51:59,960
Uh,
yeah,

1242
00:51:59,961 --> 00:52:00,950
they,
they would try to,

1243
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,480
they never,
never got off the ground.

1244
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,300
They were planning on it.
Yeah.

1245
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:07,730
What happened though was Vince and he 
had a legitimate concern is like,

1246
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:09,590
I don't want it,
don't take the legitimacy out of it.

1247
00:52:09,591 --> 00:52:11,050
You know,
like if he owned something like that,

1248
00:52:11,051 --> 00:52:12,260
you know,
they might think it's fixed.

1249
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:13,070
I think it's fake.
Well,

1250
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:15,680
they didn't think that about the XFL,
right?

1251
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,360
Guess not.
Yeah.

1252
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:21,580
Yeah.
I think the real problem is the talent 

1253
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,071
pool know there's not that many good 
fighters in the UFC owns the contracts 

1254
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:24,950
for 500 fighters.
Wow.

1255
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,300
And they're all the best fighters.
Sure.

1256
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:31,390
We,
there's not one fighter in any weight 

1257
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:31,390
class outside of the UFC that you can 
make a rational argument that's the best

1258
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,390
fighter in that weight class.

1259
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:34,970
So once they have that,
it's like,

1260
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:37,470
boy,
it's hard to sell a league when you know

1261
00:52:37,471 --> 00:52:40,910
that the UFC,
this is our 170 pound world champion.

1262
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,870
Like,
well,

1263
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:46,930
is that really because everybody knows 
Robbie lawler is the fucking world to 

1264
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:47,610
launch any sort of competition.
Yeah.

1265
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:48,650
It's just,
it's hard for me.

1266
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:49,910
You know,
I get it.

1267
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:54,970
Well this in other organizations like a 
world series of fighting us,

1268
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,530
some good fights,
beltour have some good bytes,

1269
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:02,250
but it's just gonna be real hard for 
them to build stars to build like a.

1270
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:07,290
because everybody,
like a kid coming up wants to be the 

1271
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:07,290
best,
you know,

1272
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:08,240
if he wants to be the best one and 35 
pounds,

1273
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:11,180
he wants to fight Tj dillashaw.
He doesn't want to fight Marty fuck face

1274
00:53:11,181 --> 00:53:16,181
from a,
from a Mike's Hardcore fighting 

1275
00:53:16,181 --> 00:53:16,181
championship.
You know what I mean?

1276
00:53:16,181 --> 00:53:20,051
It's like you just want to be the best,
so they're always going to recruit the 

1277
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:20,051
best guys.

1278
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:20,750
They're ahead of the game,
you know,

1279
00:53:20,751 --> 00:53:25,751
that's not a lockdown game and you know,
especially like if like Bella tour 

1280
00:53:25,751 --> 00:53:27,970
science or,
and maybe somebody gets Gina Carano like

1281
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:32,990
chicken get weird.
I feel like it's all like the same with 

1282
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:32,990
wrestling now if you look at wwe,
they've been,

1283
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:37,370
they've had a monopoly for awhile.
Then wcw came along and they started 

1284
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:37,780
getting popular,
but then you know,

1285
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,850
now that the web,
the legs,

1286
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:41,990
the other league TNA,
it's so lame,

1287
00:53:41,991 --> 00:53:42,360
you know,
it's like,

1288
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:47,361
you know,
nobody really gives a fuck about it at 

1289
00:53:47,361 --> 00:53:47,860
all and that's the thing is like in the 
end like UFC will be,

1290
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,500
it will be around forever.
It's like the NFL,

1291
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:50,520
it,
unless they sell it,

1292
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:51,190
they,
they could,

1293
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,560
they could get to a point where they're 
like,

1294
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:53,990
look,
let's get the fuck out of here.

1295
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,640
Yeah,
work killing us.

1296
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,310
Because Dana works all day long every 
day.

1297
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:04,310
He's constantly flying all over the 
world and Lorenzo's doing the same 

1298
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:04,310
thing.
It's like,

1299
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:08,640
it's a lot of work.
It's not easy doing what those guys are 

1300
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,091
doing and when they're gone,
everybody's gonna miss him and people 

1301
00:54:11,091 --> 00:54:13,731
complaining about the EOC,
but when they're gone you realize the 

1302
00:54:13,731 --> 00:54:13,890
alternative and if they've created an 
industry,

1303
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,230
people are mad about a stupid uniforms.
I mean,

1304
00:54:16,231 --> 00:54:17,490
that's the last thing I'd get mad about 
it.

1305
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:22,550
Well,
they have some points fighter side when 

1306
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,440
it comes to that with the sponsorships.
It's just they lose too much money,

1307
00:54:25,441 --> 00:54:26,240
you know,
it's just.

1308
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:31,340
I've been,
I was lucky enough to get in on the 

1309
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:31,340
last,
uh,

1310
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:31,920
the last thing before a reebok took over
with,

1311
00:54:31,921 --> 00:54:36,921
uh,
with one of the fighters and was pretty 

1312
00:54:36,921 --> 00:54:39,051
cool.
It's cool to see the logo up there and 

1313
00:54:39,051 --> 00:54:39,051
all that stuff.
It was nice people.

1314
00:54:39,051 --> 00:54:39,150
Well that's a big part of what the 
fighters get.

1315
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,670
It's what you would say,
like ego sponsorships,

1316
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,220
like dynamic fastener is on like so 
many.

1317
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:49,300
I don't even know what that is,
but it's on so many different tee 

1318
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:49,980
shirts.
So many that'll reebok said the there.

1319
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:55,040
I guess it's,
it seems like I'm over the spread over 

1320
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,010
all the fighters.
They'll make more money.

1321
00:54:56,011 --> 00:54:58,140
The younger fighters or is that just not
true?

1322
00:54:58,590 --> 00:54:59,820
I don't think it's true.
Yeah.

1323
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,020
No,
I don't think it's true.

1324
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:05,720
I think maybe for deal changes or they 
start to make more money and you know,

1325
00:55:05,721 --> 00:55:07,590
it becomes something bigger than what it
is right now.

1326
00:55:07,591 --> 00:55:10,500
But if you look at it right now,
Tim Kennedy said it best reasonably.

1327
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,520
He said on one strikeforce card he made 
more money in sponsorships.

1328
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,780
Then the reebok paid out for the entire 
last UFC car from Brazil.

1329
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:19,850
Yeah.
Gotcha.

1330
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:24,870
Wow.
So all those people were wearing reebok 

1331
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:24,870
gear.

1332
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:24,870
He made more money from one fight in 
strikeforce.

1333
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:26,560
Yeah.
So that's.

1334
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:32,050
Yeah,
it looked like reebok had a pretty good 

1335
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:32,050
deal from what I heard.
I don't think it's a good deal.

1336
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:32,050
No.
I mean,

1337
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:32,940
I mean for Reebok,
but no,

1338
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:37,941
I don't think it's ideal for Reebok 
because what I'm saying because I think 

1339
00:55:37,941 --> 00:55:38,160
it gives them a bad name in some ways.
Yeah.

1340
00:55:38,161 --> 00:55:43,161
Yeah.
I understand all these people come out 

1341
00:55:43,161 --> 00:55:43,161
and whereas.
Yeah.

1342
00:55:43,161 --> 00:55:43,161
No,
no,

1343
00:55:43,161 --> 00:55:43,161
no,
no,

1344
00:55:43,161 --> 00:55:47,151
that's not true,
but all these people are complaining 

1345
00:55:47,151 --> 00:55:48,060
like Tim Kennedy complaints,
titch Dorian complainants who gets fired

1346
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,850
for are complaining lots of fighters,
a complainant,

1347
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:55,851
Brendan sharp complaint or all these 
different guys complained that that's 

1348
00:55:55,851 --> 00:55:57,060
all negative press towards their brand.
I mean,

1349
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,360
they're not a person right there a 
brand.

1350
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:04,510
If you associate that brand,
you can't like fire the head guy and 

1351
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:04,510
change the brand.

1352
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,180
The brand is still the brand.
You know,

1353
00:56:06,181 --> 00:56:08,010
when everybody's gonna associate that 
brand with it.

1354
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,720
Is it a big name brand?
Yeah.

1355
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:14,900
Good.
You see a big name brand attached to a 

1356
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:14,900
sport like the UFC?
Absolutely,

1357
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:19,760
but I feel like whenever you're in a 
situation where the fighters are going 

1358
00:56:20,391 --> 00:56:25,391
to lose money,
that's always the number one concern 

1359
00:56:25,391 --> 00:56:28,381
that people have.
Everybody knows the window of 

1360
00:56:28,381 --> 00:56:28,381
opportunity for a fighter is extremely 
small,

1361
00:56:28,381 --> 00:56:28,690
so you have a few years to make some 
money,

1362
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:30,730
right?
So when you take some of that money away

1363
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:34,780
from them in terms in favor of prestige,
the prestige,

1364
00:56:34,781 --> 00:56:36,420
which is inarguable,
Reebok's,

1365
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:41,490
a huge brand,
it's great to be in business with a big 

1366
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:41,490
brand,
but if it costs fighters money,

1367
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:44,110
boy that's going to be hot.
You can't not see that.

1368
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:46,390
It's not like we're going to put 
blinders on and ignore that.

1369
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,550
You have to address that.
Social media is a huge thing.

1370
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:50,770
So the fighters are going to be heard.
The new just.

1371
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,410
It's the big.
It's bigger than anything because if you

1372
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:55,780
bitch about something on twitter and 
someone says,

1373
00:56:55,781 --> 00:57:00,781
Holy Shit,
Chris Bell just went off about that and 

1374
00:57:00,781 --> 00:57:00,910
then some newspaper gets ahold of it and
then boom,

1375
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:05,911
it goes viral on facebook and people 
repost it and tweet it because we live 

1376
00:57:05,911 --> 00:57:09,811
in a different world.
And so anytime someone like stitch gets 

1377
00:57:09,811 --> 00:57:09,811
fired because he said something about,
hey,

1378
00:57:09,811 --> 00:57:11,470
you know,
reebok of this deal kind of sucks for me

1379
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:12,700
because now I'm not making as much 
money.

1380
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:14,410
So they fire them and then all of a 
sudden,

1381
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:19,411
boom,
that becomes a way bigger issue than it 

1382
00:57:19,411 --> 00:57:21,190
was just with them saying that if he 
just said that and that was it,

1383
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,570
it would have been a small issue.

1384
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:25,240
But him saying that and then getting 
fired for it,

1385
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:29,350
it compounds the issue.
People react quickly to social media,

1386
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:31,330
you know,
makes everything go faster.

1387
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,000
You know,
they start wearing Nike's history.

1388
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:36,610
This is what.
I'm not a business person.

1389
00:57:36,611 --> 00:57:37,480
I'm not.
I would,

1390
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:41,080
if I was running the UFC,
it would've been bankrupt a long fucking

1391
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:42,810
time ago.
But you,

1392
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,200
you,
I think it's,

1393
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,600
it's real.
It's real dangerous.

1394
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,700
Looking at the bright side of deals like
this,

1395
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,410
like let's look at the bright side.
I'm,

1396
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:53,980
let's look at the worst case scenario.
What's the worst case scenario?

1397
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:56,680
Everybody is going to hate reebok.
That's the worst case scenario.

1398
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:58,780
People gonna be mad at the UFC and mad 
at Reebok.

1399
00:57:58,781 --> 00:57:59,590
So I go,
Ooh,

1400
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:02,560
I don't know man.
I was able to sponsor a Joseph Benevidez

1401
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:04,520
and that was pretty cool.
But you know what?

1402
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,060
What is your company a slingshot?

1403
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:09,010
This the slingshot that I had you throw 
on earlier,

1404
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:11,620
did banged out,
banged out some pushups in.

1405
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,720
Yeah,
he's got this cool device that you.

1406
00:58:13,721 --> 00:58:18,721
A slide.
It's like this heavy duty rubber thing 

1407
00:58:18,721 --> 00:58:23,281
that you slide up to your biceps and it 
actually gives you a bit of an 

1408
00:58:23,281 --> 00:58:24,520
assistance when doing pushups or bench 
press or something like that.

1409
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:25,390
Yeah,
it feels good,

1410
00:58:25,391 --> 00:58:25,990
man.
I like it.

1411
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:31,050
Where can people get this?
We want to get how much you benched on 

1412
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:31,050
it?
How much you bench go?

1413
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,230
There's the fucking plug.
How much you bench dot?

1414
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,000
Yeah.
What do you bench some retarded number?

1415
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:36,110
Like 700 pounds.
I'm five.

1416
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:39,190
My best bench press and competition.
This is where the bench shirt,

1417
00:58:39,191 --> 00:58:42,230
which is much more heavy duty than than 
something like the slingshot.

1418
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,920
It's just a supportive device.
It's crazy looking.

1419
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:50,220
Looks like a straight jacket,
but I did an 854 pound bench press in 

1420
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:52,040
the 275 pound weight class.

1421
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:57,040
So then without a bench shirt,
my best bench press is 560 pounds in 

1422
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,310
competition.
That's like a Harley Davidson.

1423
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,050
Right.
How much do those weigh?

1424
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,390
Those weigh like 800 pounds.
That's crazy.

1425
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,380
That's a lot of God.
Damn.

1426
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:07,381
Wait Dude.
How long have been at it for a long 

1427
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:07,381
time.
I started when I was 12,

1428
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:11,040
two older brothers that are dicks that 
forced me to lift weights even though I 

1429
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,360
was and I didn't fucking want to know.
What are those bench shirts?

1430
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:15,870
Those vests?
Yeah.

1431
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:21,250
Bencher wearing a denim jacket.
Backwards is what it's like and 

1432
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,010
originally it was originally it was 
designed just

1433
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,020
to be protective and then people were 
like,

1434
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:25,640
wait a second.
Not only is it protective,

1435
00:59:25,641 --> 00:59:30,641
but I can lift more weight with it.
And so then they started making them 

1436
00:59:30,641 --> 00:59:31,220
more and more extreme.
They used to be like one layer.

1437
00:59:31,221 --> 00:59:36,221
Then they started making two layers and 
they started making them out of a pair 

1438
00:59:36,221 --> 00:59:38,681
of fucking genes and they started making
them out of a canvas and all kinds of 

1439
00:59:38,681 --> 00:59:41,600
different where people revolted against 
that and now everybody lifts.

1440
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:45,380
Ra are a lot of people lift robin,
you could say,

1441
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:46,520
oh,
how much do you bench?

1442
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:47,040
Oh,
fine.

1443
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:49,200
And raw would just be with just race 
ramps on.

1444
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:50,390
What did you do?
Five.

1445
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,550
Five slash 65 slash 60.
That's crazy.

1446
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:54,770
You can do 300 pounds more than one of 
those shirts.

1447
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,700
Yeah.
Isn't that nuts?

1448
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,760
That is on the slot to his squad was 
like a thousand pounds to 180 squat.

1449
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,040
And fell pretty bad with 185.
He fell.

1450
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:05,540
I fucking felt.
Well,

1451
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:08,280
what happened was,
is there's a girl that's a,

1452
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:11,570
was trained under Jim and she's running,
she's running the squat rack.

1453
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:14,600
The squat rack is called a monolift.
And uh,

1454
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:15,560
when you,
uh,

1455
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:19,340
you released this like lever so that I 
don't have to walk the weight backwards,

1456
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:20,440
you understand that,
right?

1457
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:25,710
Another walked away backwards,
the lever moves out of the way and I 

1458
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:28,871
pick the weight up and go.
The problem is the girl's hot and she's 

1459
01:00:28,871 --> 01:00:32,231
in a sundress and I'm trying to.
I'm trying to concentrate on a lift 

1460
01:00:32,231 --> 01:00:32,570
here.
And so midway down on the squat,

1461
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,720
one nice shoots out to left the other 
new shoots out the other way.

1462
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:38,030
And next thing I know is on the fucking 
ground.

1463
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,940
So it was it on your back or in front of
you and now I.

1464
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:44,510
well luckily I got kind of unloaded from
the weight quickly it,

1465
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,490
it fell back behind me and I fell 
forward.

1466
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:49,340
I was fucked up for months from that.
That was a,

1467
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:51,010
that was a pretty bad.
How'd you fuck?

1468
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:53,180
Like what kind of injury?
You know what?

1469
01:00:53,181 --> 01:00:58,181
I never went to the doctor.
I'm not a fan of going to the doctor so 

1470
01:00:58,181 --> 01:01:00,600
I just a rub some dirt on it and just 
lived with pain for awhile.

1471
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:02,840
It was like black and blue.
My ankle was fucked up.

1472
01:01:02,841 --> 01:01:04,490
My knees were fucked up.
But you know,

1473
01:01:04,491 --> 01:01:05,880
I,
I did go to a,

1474
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,310
I went to a friend of mine.
He's like,

1475
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:12,370
what are they?
Gonna compare x rays and Mris and stuff 

1476
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:15,191
too.
It's like you already know you're all 

1477
01:01:15,191 --> 01:01:15,191
fucked up anyway.
Oh,

1478
01:01:15,191 --> 01:01:15,191
you fucked up from lifting?
No,

1479
01:01:15,191 --> 01:01:15,950
I'm not that bad.
I'm,

1480
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:16,640
I'm pretty much.

1481
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,700
Okay.
I have why General Mri revealed damage?

1482
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:21,320
Well he just,
he was just saying like,

1483
01:01:21,321 --> 01:01:26,321
your knees are probably.
There's probably slight tears here and 

1484
01:01:26,321 --> 01:01:26,321
there,
you know,

1485
01:01:26,321 --> 01:01:27,920
because I've had knee pain and all kinds
of different things for years,

1486
01:01:27,921 --> 01:01:29,480
so he was just saying like,
you're,

1487
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:31,580
they're going to tell you that you're 
fucked up.

1488
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:32,840
He's like,
what are you gonna do about it?

1489
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:34,420
Well,
shoulders are a big one for guys.

1490
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:35,420
Events that much.
Right.

1491
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:38,300
The shoulders packs and people blow off 
their pack.

1492
01:01:38,301 --> 01:01:41,570
That's how I invented the slingshot was 
I tore my peck three times.

1493
01:01:41,571 --> 01:01:43,330
I injured my times.
Yeah.

1494
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,280
They were all stitched back in.
No,

1495
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:46,520
no he didn't.
No,

1496
01:01:46,521 --> 01:01:49,220
I don't like going to the doctor.
So you tore it and just dealt with it.

1497
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,780
Just dealt with it.
Yeah.

1498
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:51,900
I didn't.
I never had.

1499
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,840
I never had like a rupture,
you know?

1500
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:58,840
I never tore it all the way through.
I never toured all the way through to 

1501
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,771
where it was like bleeding down to the 
bicep and all that nasty shit that can 

1502
01:02:02,771 --> 01:02:03,110
happen with a torn Pec.
I do it my tricep and it's brutal.

1503
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,130
Yeah.
I've seen both the bone,

1504
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,520
seeing a lot of people that get the 
bicep curls up like a golf ball.

1505
01:02:08,521 --> 01:02:09,500
It looks crazy,
you know,

1506
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:09,880
like,
uh,

1507
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:12,770
there's some fighters that,
that like getting punched in the face.

1508
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:16,340
I kind of like pain.
So for me it's kind of a,

1509
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,500
it's kind of just part of the territory 
with training.

1510
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,760
Yeah,
the pain guys.

1511
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:23,120
Those are weird people.
Person I know.

1512
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,040
I'm weird.
Yeah,

1513
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:25,780
I don't mind it.
I don't mind.

1514
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,300
Well,
the thing about soreness,

1515
01:02:27,301 --> 01:02:28,470
it's like it lets you know,
like,

1516
01:02:28,471 --> 01:02:30,270
yeah,
I fucking really got to work out.

1517
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:35,271
There's a difference between soreness 
though and not being able to get up out 

1518
01:02:35,271 --> 01:02:35,271
of bed in the morning and stuff like 
that.

1519
01:02:35,271 --> 01:02:37,230
That stuff's brutal.
Joint pain,

1520
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:40,500
especially pain and joint pain are two 
different animals.

1521
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:41,550
Joint pains.
Rough.

1522
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:42,900
Yeah.
Can you know,

1523
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:46,640
you get some little shit that for some 
reason you just can't handle it.

1524
01:02:46,641 --> 01:02:48,990
It's like the little tiny things that 
just no way.

1525
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:50,220
You're like,
mother Fucker,

1526
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:52,620
why my elbow hurts so bad.
Goddamn hangnails.

1527
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:56,880
What's the littlest thing from crazy 
lifting in general,

1528
01:02:56,881 --> 01:02:57,840
like every,
you know,

1529
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:03,050
pretty much everybody we know has some 
sort of injury hurt somewhere where 

1530
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,420
you're not working out hard.
One or two things and people.

1531
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:10,450
People,
I looked at a certain forms of exercise 

1532
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:10,450
like crossfit,
saying like,

1533
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:10,450
oh,
everybody gets hurt,

1534
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:10,840
and I'm like,
everybody gets hurt.

1535
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:15,890
Power lifting,
everybody I know that's a bodybuilder 

1536
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:16,260
gets hurt like everybody else.
Take any of them extremely doing this.

1537
01:03:16,261 --> 01:03:18,960
And that's what we talked about.
We were talking about on the way up here

1538
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,880
is a slowing down in your workouts.

1539
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,550
Just taken time to actually,
uh,

1540
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:27,870
think about what you're dealing with.
One thousand pounds and 1000.

1541
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,850
Oh yeah,
this five actually make this one.

1542
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,490
But see the sun drop.
Why does it say tumble?

1543
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,230
Tumble?
There we go.

1544
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,020
That's the girl in the sun dress.
She fucked you up.

1545
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,930
We're going to look how big his face.
Yeah.

1546
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:43,200
I'm about 320 pounds in this video or 
300 pounds for.

1547
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,040
Damn,
dude,

1548
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:47,730
that's a wide ass stance to you.
Always squad that wide.

1549
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:53,470
Uh,
in a squatsuit I squatted a little bit 

1550
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:55,311
wider.
It creates some tightness around the 

1551
01:03:55,311 --> 01:03:58,491
hips and kind of gives you some support 
through your hips because pretty hot to 

1552
01:03:58,491 --> 01:03:59,940
the guy behind.
Isn't that I'm the trainer.

1553
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:00,850
UFC.
Oh yeah,

1554
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:05,580
that's a novella.
Who is a trainer of some UFC fighters,

1555
01:04:05,581 --> 01:04:10,581
Chad Mendez,
and I'm a Joseph Benevidez and a bunch 

1556
01:04:10,581 --> 01:04:12,420
of other small dudes that can fuck 
people up.

1557
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:18,110
Yeah.
It's funny that they have a whole camp 

1558
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:18,110
full of those dudes,
isn't it?

1559
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:18,110
This is this you've given out.
Oh Jesus.

1560
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:19,770
Dude.
God Damn.

1561
01:04:19,771 --> 01:04:21,780
That's a lot of weight.
Yeah.

1562
01:04:21,781 --> 01:04:22,680
And so like,
uh,

1563
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:25,410
when it happened and I felt it,
it wasn't,

1564
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:31,040
it didn't hurt that bad initially,
but then as time wore on it got worse 

1565
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:35,421
and worse and worse.
The swelling to start getting fucking 

1566
01:04:35,421 --> 01:04:37,281
crazy.
I stayed at the competition and I'm a 

1567
01:04:37,281 --> 01:04:38,640
coach for all the athletes that are in 
that video basically.

1568
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:41,700
And I stayed the whole time and helped 
everybody and just like I normally would

1569
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,490
normally do.
And then the next day when I woke up,

1570
01:04:44,491 --> 01:04:45,540
I just,
I couldn't,

1571
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,700
by the time I got home even I couldn't 
even,

1572
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:50,070
I couldn't even get upstairs to go to 
bed.

1573
01:04:50,071 --> 01:04:54,060
I just fucking sat on the couch and sat 
on the chair and just slept in the chair

1574
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:57,000
for the night and slept right there for 
the next two or three days.

1575
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:02,270
You know,
one of the interesting aspects of your 

1576
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:02,270
film was Louie Simmons,
amazing.

1577
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:02,730
Greg,
I have one of his,

1578
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:04,950
a reverse hypers and the back things are
awesome.

1579
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:10,410
Credible machine for,
for decompressing your lower back and 

1580
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:11,170
pumping blood into it and everything.
Oh,

1581
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:14,470
things amazing.
But he's a refreshing character to,

1582
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:19,800
you know,
it was funny when you were saying that 

1583
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:19,800
you were going to get off steroids.
He's like,

1584
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:19,950
we'll do that.
Yeah,

1585
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,680
of course.
But that's,

1586
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,670
that's the attitude that all those guys 
have.

1587
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:25,240
It's like,
look,

1588
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:28,540
you just have to accept the fact that 
you are now a steroid dude.

1589
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,100
Yeah,
absolutely.

1590
01:05:29,101 --> 01:05:30,010
Absolutely.
And you know,

1591
01:05:30,011 --> 01:05:33,550
making a good documentary.
I think it's a lot about casting.

1592
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,630
It's about them.
You pick,

1593
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:39,690
you know,
it's just like any other movie who you 

1594
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:42,091
picked to be in the movie.
And Louie Simmons was somebody that 

1595
01:05:42,091 --> 01:05:43,510
inspired me to do things differently to 
think differently.

1596
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:46,150
Used chains and bands.
I used to go into Gold's gym,

1597
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,100
you know,
15,

1598
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:52,120
20 minute pioneer that by the way,
bands and chains and all that type of 

1599
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:52,200
change on the bar to accommodate 
assistant.

1600
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:53,940
So like the band will.
Oh,

1601
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,560
you can tell him it's getting harder as 
you get higher,

1602
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,980
as you squat is called good.
It's called accommodating resistance.

1603
01:05:59,981 --> 01:06:02,890
It basically makes you a drive into the 
bar faster.

1604
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,410
So if you can picture a bunch of chains 
on the bar,

1605
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:10,411
there's um,
let's say 40 pounds of chains on the 

1606
01:06:10,411 --> 01:06:12,841
bar.
As you lower those weights will be less 

1607
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:13,190
and less weight on the bar and as you go
to pick it back up,

1608
01:06:13,191 --> 01:06:14,640
it will be more and more weight on the 
bar scene.

1609
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:17,440
You have to actually physically move 
faster.

1610
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:22,560
I'm a way that I try to explain it to 
people as if you were to try to hop up 

1611
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:22,560
on this podcast table.

1612
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:27,270
You can't do it slowly.
So we trained with bands and change a 

1613
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:27,270
similar thing.
You have to do it quickly,

1614
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:29,230
you have to try to get a lot of 
acceleration into it.

1615
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:34,560
Does that make sense?
So that would probably eight and 

1616
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:34,560
explosive shit like football or punching
people.

1617
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:39,260
And then also the also a huge benefit of
it is that the weight is lighter at the 

1618
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:43,021
bottom.
Same thing kind of happens with the 

1619
01:06:43,021 --> 01:06:43,021
slingshot,
but with the weight being lighter at the

1620
01:06:43,021 --> 01:06:43,021
bottom,
it's,

1621
01:06:43,021 --> 01:06:43,021
it's,
uh,

1622
01:06:43,021 --> 01:06:47,820
creates a safer environment because the 
bottom of a squat and the bottom of 

1623
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:49,060
bench presser kind of somewhat dangerous
positions to be in.

1624
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:52,510
How much does it chain way normally they
usually wait about 20 pounds.

1625
01:06:52,511 --> 01:06:55,660
The ones that we use pretty pretty God 
damn thick.

1626
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,920
Yeah.
Like big ass chains in the seventies 

1627
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,830
boating type of.
The thing is I would read a magazine 

1628
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:03,830
called power lifting USA.

1629
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:08,100
We didn't have the.
Oh I thought you were going to say 

1630
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:08,330
inches inches.
I'll tell talking about that.

1631
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:11,500
And so action.
So we used to look at that,

1632
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,670
that magazine,
I was the only,

1633
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:16,900
only information on strength training 
and the entire world that a kid,

1634
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:19,990
15 years old growing up in Poughkeepsie,
New York and get his hands on.

1635
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,020
So I would read that and I'd go to the 
gym.

1636
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,980
I try out all these weird things and 
people like,

1637
01:07:23,981 --> 01:07:26,020
what the fuck are you doing?
And um,

1638
01:07:26,021 --> 01:07:27,830
when I was a kid I was swatting you'll 
500,

1639
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:29,620
four sets of eight reps and people are 
like,

1640
01:07:29,621 --> 01:07:30,870
what,
what does he squatted?

1641
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,650
Six hundred and 75 pounds in high 
school.

1642
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,380
He was just fucking,
what the fuck are you won?

1643
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:35,800
Right?
And I'm like,

1644
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:36,790
I'm not,
I'm not on anything.

1645
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:38,060
I'm on Louie Simmons,
you know.

1646
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:41,650
And so when I started training a mark to
just be,

1647
01:07:41,651 --> 01:07:42,760
you know,
an animal,

1648
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,020
uh,
it was,

1649
01:07:44,021 --> 01:07:49,021
uh,
he had a lifting belt that said Roy 

1650
01:07:49,021 --> 01:07:49,780
suck.
I wrote out a director of bigger,

1651
01:07:49,781 --> 01:07:51,220
stronger,
faster ladies and gentlemen,

1652
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,290
and it said,
Roy suck.

1653
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:58,291
And I would go to the gym and all these 
guys were like all juiced up like 

1654
01:07:58,291 --> 01:07:58,291
Poughkeepsie,
New York.

1655
01:07:58,291 --> 01:07:59,980
It's like,
I don't know what is in the water there,

1656
01:07:59,981 --> 01:08:02,310
but everybody was on something.
And um,

1657
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,570
and I just always wanted to sort of deny
that,

1658
01:08:04,571 --> 01:08:06,460
go against that.
Like I'm not doing this.

1659
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:09,670
And um,
that's why that was the whole,

1660
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:15,300
the whole genesis for that movie was the
fact that I always had this weird moral

1661
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,200
thing,
you know,

1662
01:08:17,201 --> 01:08:18,140
like against it,
I got,

1663
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,360
I can't do that.
That's just fucking cheating.

1664
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:21,350
Jamie,
can you get some of those?

1665
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:25,580
Caveman given us those nitro cans.
Those fuckers are good.

1666
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,880
Bring in a few of those kind of kills.
No,

1667
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:30,020
this is the good shit man.
We're out a regular coffee.

1668
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:35,210
What,
what was it that pushed you over the 

1669
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:35,210
edge of,
made you want to try steroids then?

1670
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:35,950
How Old Society?
No.

1671
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,320
I went to USC and there's hot chicks 
everywhere and I wasn't a gorilla.

1672
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:42,170
You fucking squatting $600.
Wasn't really in good shape.

1673
01:08:42,171 --> 01:08:47,171
I didn't look good,
but all you have to do is clean up your 

1674
01:08:47,171 --> 01:08:49,721
diet.
He's always had to kind of a conflict 

1675
01:08:49,721 --> 01:08:49,721
with a with is like build.
He's always been trying to get in better

1676
01:08:49,721 --> 01:08:50,810
shape.
And so I think that uh,

1677
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,790
steroids is a,
a quicker and easier route in some cases

1678
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:59,420
to a get a little bit better shape and I
totally understand that.

1679
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:00,650
But I mean,
you were,

1680
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:04,180
it sounds like if you.
Would you say you squat six 75 percent?

1681
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,060
Yeah,
when I was younger.

1682
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:06,210
Yeah.
Fucking wait.

1683
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:08,620
I mean,
you have to be a big fucker to do that.

1684
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:13,830
That was about,
I was a little bit fatter than I am now 

1685
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:14,960
to great out way about to 10.
I was about to 40 maybe,

1686
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:20,020
you know,
so it was just a matter of you just 

1687
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:22,481
didn't like the way you looked at.
I didn't like the way it looks is 

1688
01:09:22,481 --> 01:09:22,481
important.
Everybody else was in good shape.

1689
01:09:22,481 --> 01:09:24,510
I was training at golds.
Venice had been goal.

1690
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:29,540
I've been gold's gym in Venice,
in the hoaxster would be in there and 

1691
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:29,540
you know,
macho man,

1692
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:33,300
Randy Savage and I'm going to do when a 
black guy daughter the hawks.

1693
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:35,240
Jim,
that's depressing.

1694
01:09:35,241 --> 01:09:35,870
Shit,
wasn't it?

1695
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:39,100
As it means he'll,
he'll be back on his word rent.

1696
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:41,660
He said some bad things,
you know,

1697
01:09:41,661 --> 01:09:43,520
he'll be,
I think with wrestling,

1698
01:09:43,521 --> 01:09:48,521
like it's the most inexcusable things 
have been excused and I think that 

1699
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:51,800
they'll figure out a way to.
Did they fire him from the wwe?

1700
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:53,930
They erased them from their website 
completely.

1701
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:55,280
Like,
as if he never existed.

1702
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:58,190
Uh,
you can't do that to the Hawks stadium.

1703
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:03,250
Yeah.
I mean it's still pending the iron 

1704
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:03,250
sheik.
Yeah,

1705
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,030
I was there.
I saw it.

1706
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,750
That'd be amazing.
If you were there physically?

1707
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,440
No,
I've never been one of those things.

1708
01:10:09,441 --> 01:10:10,460
Madison Square Garden.
I didn't.

1709
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:12,090
The wrestling,
I don't know.

1710
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:12,810
No,
no,

1711
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:14,420
because we were just saying all that 
shit.

1712
01:10:14,421 --> 01:10:19,421
We were in.
You were into martial arts since you 

1713
01:10:19,421 --> 01:10:19,670
were a little kid too,
so I was going to do it in high school.

1714
01:10:19,671 --> 01:10:24,671
In high school.
I love Jimmy superfly snowfall and Bob 

1715
01:10:24,671 --> 01:10:24,700
backlund and all that wrestled Jimmy in.

1716
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:27,650
Did you listen to where your career goes
in wrestling?

1717
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,800
He pinned Jimmy superfly snuck a at an 
Indian casino for like 50 bucks in front

1718
01:10:34,311 --> 01:10:35,870
of about 40 people.
That's awesome.

1719
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:37,980
Where was this time in my life.
What part?

1720
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:39,650
I don't know.
Where the fuck I was.

1721
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:41,750
Where was I?
Somewhere in California.

1722
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:44,660
Somewhere High Dam bucks.
50 bucks.

1723
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:45,710
Yep.
God Damn it.

1724
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:49,250
What did he.
He looked like a transvestite.

1725
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:53,280
He was hot.
Wow.

1726
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:56,780
Rowdy Roddy Piper just passed away.
Yeah,

1727
01:10:56,781 --> 01:11:01,781
he was the nemesis.
I'm having a next week,

1728
01:11:01,881 --> 01:11:04,550
next Monday at the comedy store.
There's a a tribute.

1729
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:07,160
Rowdy Roddy Piper and all the people at 
the new one.

1730
01:11:07,161 --> 01:11:09,890
We're going to come in and I never got a
chance to meet.

1731
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,920
That guy always bummed me out because he
was fucking,

1732
01:11:11,921 --> 01:11:13,590
her was awesome.
That's all I heard.

1733
01:11:13,591 --> 01:11:14,040
I heard was such

1734
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,170
a great guy.
That's what we loved about wrestling.

1735
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:18,240
Like we just love the personalities.
We loved it.

1736
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,640
If UFC was around,
we were like little kids.

1737
01:11:20,641 --> 01:11:22,440
We probably went into that route,
you know,

1738
01:11:22,441 --> 01:11:24,960
our older brother was always beating 
somebody up,

1739
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:25,540
you know,
and that's,

1740
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:30,730
he,
he went into pro wrestling because 

1741
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:32,331
that's all existed at the time.
But I know if mma existence at the time 

1742
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:33,030
you would have went that way.
The um,

1743
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:35,330
the thing when you did with Jimmy snuck 
up,

1744
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,580
like how old was he at the time?
He's got to be in a 65.

1745
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,620
This was probably about 15 years ago.
A sixties then.

1746
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:44,280
But yeah.
Yeah,

1747
01:11:44,281 --> 01:11:47,010
he was definitely a definitely old.
Definitely had a shape.

1748
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:48,270
Yeah,
it wasn't,

1749
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,750
it wasn't pretty.
Was it weird?

1750
01:11:49,751 --> 01:11:51,600
Did it feel weird?
I was fucking really weird.

1751
01:11:51,601 --> 01:11:52,990
Yeah.
And the poor guy,

1752
01:11:52,991 --> 01:11:55,080
like what does he do for the wrestling 
in general is weird.

1753
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:57,060
Like wrestling another dude.
And like tights and stuff,

1754
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,440
it's really strange.
I mean,

1755
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:03,620
like we,
we used to run this small wrestling 

1756
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:05,380
federation with a guy named Rick Bass 
man who's a good friend of ours and um,

1757
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:09,870
it was called upw ultimate pro wrestling
and we put like 30 guys into wwe.

1758
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:15,110
So a lot of times like these young guys 
had to work with the older guys like 

1759
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:15,110
John Ciena.
We'd be working with,

1760
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:15,390
uh,
Greg,

1761
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:17,670
the hammer,
Valentine to hammer Valentine.

1762
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:18,240
Like,
Hey kid,

1763
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:19,590
I'm not going to bump for anyone,
you know,

1764
01:12:19,591 --> 01:12:22,650
bump means hit them.
I'm never gonna hit the mat,

1765
01:12:22,651 --> 01:12:24,510
you just to beat the shit out of here.
So it was like,

1766
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:27,330
that's part of a part of that.
What does that mean?

1767
01:12:27,331 --> 01:12:28,860
Bump?
What did he just hit?

1768
01:12:28,861 --> 01:12:30,090
The Mat basically,
uh,

1769
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,950
you know,
just like fall for the other guy.

1770
01:12:31,951 --> 01:12:36,951
Meaning meaning like,
the older guys don't want to do any of 

1771
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:36,951
the work.

1772
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:37,380
You're going to work around them and 
make them look good,

1773
01:12:37,381 --> 01:12:39,270
but they're not actually going to do 
anything.

1774
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:44,580
Oh.
So they don't fall down anymore because 

1775
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:44,580
they're all being.
Well that makes sense.

1776
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,760
Like fuck you on my phone now.
It's super fly.

1777
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,720
Have that kind of a conversation with a 
little bit.

1778
01:12:48,721 --> 01:12:49,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

1779
01:12:49,261 --> 01:12:50,100
What is,
how does it,

1780
01:12:50,101 --> 01:12:52,500
what does it go down?
Well he basically uh,

1781
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,590
he just told me to different moves he 
wanted to do and I was like,

1782
01:12:55,591 --> 01:13:00,591
all right,
we'll just sounded like I'm not really 

1783
01:13:00,591 --> 01:13:02,271
getting into many moves.
Was what happened was he did the 

1784
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:03,600
superfly move,
right?

1785
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:08,630
Yeah.
And then you flipped them over and 

1786
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:08,630
pinned them.
So you ended up winning.

1787
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:09,090
Right.
He still does the superfly change.

1788
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:12,510
It's amazing.
He wanted me to like sit way up though,

1789
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:17,570
you know,
I like to catch him and I did and it 

1790
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:17,570
fucking,
it hurt like a motherfucker.

1791
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:19,340
I'm sure know these old guys will steph,
you,

1792
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,870
you ever have another man jump off the 
top rope on,

1793
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,140
you know,
I have not.

1794
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,580
Do you ever see the one with Brock 
Lesnar does the shooting star head?

1795
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,250
Yeah,
I was actually there,

1796
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:31,020
done that move like hundreds of times 
when he was,

1797
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,650
when he was younger and the different 
federations where he got the web.

1798
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:37,160
I weren't really sucked.
I worked at that Wrestlemania mania that

1799
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:38,670
was up in the sky box.
I'm watching.

1800
01:13:38,671 --> 01:13:39,360
I'm like,
oh my God,

1801
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:40,680
he's dead.
He's dead.

1802
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:42,420
Meanwhile,
he's still completes the pin.

1803
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:48,030
Yeah.
He just got his fucking paying for a 

1804
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:48,030
week or something.
He was.

1805
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:51,740
He was messed up a little bit,
but he wasn't that bad compared to what 

1806
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:51,740
it should have been.
He's such a freak.

1807
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:56,340
He really is one of the biggest fleets 
in an interview.

1808
01:13:56,341 --> 01:14:01,341
Like there's like two years and he just 
doesn't remember drugs because the 

1809
01:14:01,341 --> 01:14:01,350
drugs.

1810
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,770
Oh wait,
what was the on?

1811
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:05,550
I'm not sure if others.
Probably Oxycontin.

1812
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:11,250
They do.
That was the other thing that was in 

1813
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:11,250
this in mind.
There was an article about Rowdy Roddy.

1814
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:14,230
Piper were talking about the the drugs 
that they do.

1815
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:15,610
Here it is right here.
Oh Shit.

1816
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:19,180
Look at this.
Oh my God,

1817
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:24,210
Dude.
A normal person would be dead and he's 

1818
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,430
to 90 wrestled in Seattle.
Kind of check.

1819
01:14:25,431 --> 01:14:26,290
The is a.
yeah,

1820
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:27,340
he was giant.
Will what?

1821
01:14:27,341 --> 01:14:29,380
We're just talking to talking about 
Piper to interview.

1822
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:34,400
Oh,
they were talking about the amount of 

1823
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,880
time that they spend on the road 
wrestling and that like any other sport 

1824
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,460
you get like time break.
Like these guys are restaurant.

1825
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,690
There's 100 nights a year,
which is crazy.

1826
01:14:40,691 --> 01:14:42,070
Like you don't,
you can't recover,

1827
01:14:42,071 --> 01:14:44,380
you just can't recover.
So they all get hooked on pain pills.

1828
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:46,510
I just did a movie called the 
resurrection of Jake,

1829
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:47,110
the snake.

1830
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,140
It's about jake the snake Roberts who 
was an eighties wrestler,

1831
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:52,120
you know,
and he was a crack addict,

1832
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:57,180
so to another wrestler.
Diamond Dallas page helps him get sober 

1833
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:58,270
and we just showed that movie at slam 
dance.

1834
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:03,600
He'll be out pretty soon,
but it really shows what these guys go 

1835
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:03,600
through.
Um,

1836
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,550
you know,
afterwards it shows it's a documentary 

1837
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:08,550
that's just like the movie,
the wrestler.

1838
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:09,730
It's a real,
real life.

1839
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:11,170
Darker.
Darker though.

1840
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:11,890
Yeah,
pretty much.

1841
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,230
It's fucking dark.
Jake,

1842
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:18,330
the snake is a dallas diamond page is 
doing wrestling or doing yoga now yoga,

1843
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,620
but yoga,
he's fucking crazy fit for an old dude,

1844
01:15:22,621 --> 01:15:24,040
a superman.
Pushups,

1845
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:26,020
you know,
on his fingertips.

1846
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:29,370
Push that takes his ankle and puts it up
by his fucking face and she went.

1847
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:32,140
I went to his house when we were doing 
the documentary.

1848
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:34,090
I was an executive producer on a 
documentary,

1849
01:15:34,091 --> 01:15:35,350
which I do all the Hollywood stuff.

1850
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:37,240
I help get it sold to help get it to 
festivals,

1851
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:40,690
all that kind of stuff and I just really
believed in it and I believed in it from

1852
01:15:40,691 --> 01:15:45,691
the beginning.
I knew they were making it and they 

1853
01:15:45,691 --> 01:15:48,301
asked me to get behind it really early,
so when I went down to their house to 

1854
01:15:48,301 --> 01:15:48,330
work on the movie,
he's like,

1855
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,660
I'm going to take you through this yoga 
thing.

1856
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:50,200
And I'm like,
okay,

1857
01:15:50,201 --> 01:15:55,201
what is this bullshit?
Within 10 minutes he had a heart rate 

1858
01:15:55,201 --> 01:15:56,110
monitor.
My heart rate was up to 1:55

1859
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:57,010
and he's like,
okay,

1860
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:59,140
we got to slow you down to keep you at 
like 1:45.

1861
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:02,440
So this is like this constant cardio 
flexing,

1862
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:07,180
moving,
awesome yoga thing that somebody like me

1863
01:16:07,181 --> 01:16:09,010
needs for mobility.
I think it's really,

1864
01:16:09,011 --> 01:16:11,050
it's actually a really cool thing that 
he's doing well.

1865
01:16:11,051 --> 01:16:14,230
Yoga is great for mobility.
It's really hard to do.

1866
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:17,130
It's one of those things where you look 
at a bunch of fucking soccer moms,

1867
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:18,700
but then you get in there,
you're like,

1868
01:16:18,701 --> 01:16:21,550
Holy Shit,
this is a little bit more digestible for

1869
01:16:21,551 --> 01:16:23,290
someone like me because it's a lot 
based.

1870
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:28,340
He sorta basis it around wrestling,
flex like this and hold it and it's kind

1871
01:16:30,231 --> 01:16:30,820
of fun,
you know?

1872
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,960
Yeah.
I get it.

1873
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:32,870
It's kind of,
there's no,

1874
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:37,890
no mosque days.
Now you had a double hip replacement.

1875
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:43,440
Yeah.
Rick actually rate towards the end of 

1876
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:43,440
doing bigger,
stronger,

1877
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:43,440
faster.
Uh,

1878
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,860
when we were doing the movie,
I was just worn down all the time.

1879
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:45,820
I'm like,
I don't know what's going on.

1880
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:50,880
I can barely walk.
I had just kept having all these 

1881
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,850
problems with my hips and um,
went and got it checked out and the 

1882
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:53,850
doctor said,
okay,

1883
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,090
walk across the room.
I walked across the room.

1884
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:57,790
He said,
you need to fake ed two new hips.

1885
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:58,990
And I'm like,
what?

1886
01:16:59,050 --> 01:16:59,860
Like,
what are you talking about?

1887
01:16:59,861 --> 01:17:00,870
He's like,
you need to new heads.

1888
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:03,970
A doctor that itselves hips.
He was an orthopedic surgeon,

1889
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:06,600
you know?
And when the,

1890
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:11,640
what did the MRI reveal?
I'm sure they did bone on bone and my 

1891
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,330
bone was completely smashed on both 
sides.

1892
01:17:14,331 --> 01:17:17,470
So they were smashed into the,
into your engineer.

1893
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:19,820
He was in a lot of pain all the time.
You could only,

1894
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:24,860
I mean like three,
four hours at a time was what you could 

1895
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:24,860
give to the film.
Usually in a new.

1896
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:28,390
We're just shy.
Sit down a lot and get out of this.

1897
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,380
You said this is a genetic issue?
Yeah,

1898
01:17:30,381 --> 01:17:32,810
my dad has the same thing.
My Dad has two fake hips now,

1899
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:36,620
but he didn't get him until way later.
So what happened was they,

1900
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:38,110
you know,
who knows if,

1901
01:17:38,111 --> 01:17:41,720
if a wearing down of the hips squatting 
all that much and whatever.

1902
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,840
I don't really blame it on power lifting
because I don't think that that's really

1903
01:17:44,841 --> 01:17:49,841
the cause because there's a million 
power lifters out there and I'm the one 

1904
01:17:49,841 --> 01:17:49,841
with two fake hips,
you know.

1905
01:17:49,841 --> 01:17:50,990
So it's not like,
oh this happens.

1906
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:52,070
Every power lifter,
you know,

1907
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:54,150
it doesn't mean you think it has mess,
have some effect.

1908
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,900
I think everything has.
Everything has an effect.

1909
01:17:56,901 --> 01:17:58,440
You know,
it's like they played football,

1910
01:17:58,441 --> 01:18:00,860
you wrestled like that.
I mean he's,

1911
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:01,730
he's,
uh,

1912
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:04,310
he doesn't have to fake hips and he's 
the same genetics,

1913
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:05,350
you know,
as you know,

1914
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:06,470
as me.
So I,

1915
01:18:06,471 --> 01:18:08,080
I got it from my dad,
you know,

1916
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:11,600
my dad has the same but what do they,
what do they classify it as?

1917
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:15,440
What are they classified as?
Just osteoarthritis and it's just so.

1918
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,410
But you only get into your hips now.
I have it in my ankles and my knees.

1919
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:19,970
I had both.
My knees need to be replaced,

1920
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:21,260
but I'm just sort of,
Jesus,

1921
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:23,420
I just sorta like putting that off 
because like you said,

1922
01:18:23,421 --> 01:18:27,210
we have new therapies that you had your 
knees done when you were a kid too,

1923
01:18:27,211 --> 01:18:27,400
right?
Yeah.

1924
01:18:27,401 --> 01:18:29,540
When I was 17 years old I had double 
knee surgery.

1925
01:18:29,541 --> 01:18:31,820
So would you have done.
I just had arthroscopic,

1926
01:18:31,821 --> 01:18:33,950
a bone chips removed and stuff like 
that.

1927
01:18:33,951 --> 01:18:34,310
Yeah.
But,

1928
01:18:34,311 --> 01:18:39,311
you know,
the thing is I've been in pain my whole 

1929
01:18:39,311 --> 01:18:39,311
life,
you know,

1930
01:18:39,311 --> 01:18:40,560
and there was a certain point,
uh,

1931
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:45,730
when I got the hip surgery that I wasn't
able to able to handle it anymore and 

1932
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:46,510
they started feeding me pills,
you know,

1933
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:51,520
like crazy.
And I got into that really hardcore 

1934
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:51,770
because that was something that,
uh,

1935
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:57,160
you know,
at first you do it because it helps the 

1936
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,340
pain and then after a while you do it 
because it's fun.

1937
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,770
So this is post bigger,
stronger,

1938
01:19:00,771 --> 01:19:02,030
faster.
After bigger,

1939
01:19:02,031 --> 01:19:02,630
stronger,
faster,

1940
01:19:02,631 --> 01:19:03,110
bigger,
stronger,

1941
01:19:03,111 --> 01:19:05,510
faster.
You get your double hip replacements and

1942
01:19:05,511 --> 01:19:07,010
then you had the pill problem.
Yeah,

1943
01:19:07,011 --> 01:19:08,270
I got hooked on drugs.
It's like,

1944
01:19:08,271 --> 01:19:08,660
you know,
you,

1945
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:10,520
you never aspire to become a drug 
addict,

1946
01:19:10,521 --> 01:19:13,000
but it happens.
And I'm a lot happened.

1947
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:18,020
A lot of my friends had happened to a 
lot of people doing a lot of people I 

1948
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:18,770
know think a lot.
You think a little bit of that had to do

1949
01:19:18,771 --> 01:19:23,771
with like the recovery because you had 
both of them done rather than just like 

1950
01:19:23,771 --> 01:19:23,771
one of them done at a time.
Yeah.

1951
01:19:23,771 --> 01:19:28,030
I would always suggest to anybody that 
has to have double hip replacement 

1952
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:30,791
surgery,
we get one done at a time because at 

1953
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:30,791
least you have one side that's good and 
the other side that heals.

1954
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:32,270
He literally couldn't really move at 
all.

1955
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:34,280
I was sort of like in a point in my life
where I'm like,

1956
01:19:34,281 --> 01:19:35,240
you know what?
Just do it.

1957
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:40,330
Who Cares?
Let's go in and didn't really think it 

1958
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:40,330
through that.
How old were you?

1959
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:42,080
Thirty three at the time and who?
Jesus Christ.

1960
01:19:42,081 --> 01:19:45,710
Double Hip replacement at 33 and if you 
don't know what a double hip replacement

1961
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:50,770
means,
they cut off the top of the bone and 

1962
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:53,741
they literally have this long screw that
they drive into the meat of the bone 

1963
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:56,600
where the marrow is and it locks in 
place.

1964
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:59,670
This new fake hip,
right?

1965
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:03,860
It's fucking gnarly shit.
My friend Graham Hancock had it done.

1966
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:08,920
He was here six weeks later.
He wasn't even walking with a limp when 

1967
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:08,920
I was like,
this is crazy.

1968
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:08,920
You

1969
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,040
had a hip replacement complications with
mine,

1970
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:14,340
so I'm on one of the sides.
Added had complications of getting it in

1971
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,220
because they're like,
oh,

1972
01:20:15,221 --> 01:20:17,880
all this muscle from squatting your ass 
is like a rock.

1973
01:20:17,881 --> 01:20:20,160
So they're trying to.
They had to pound it in with a hammer.

1974
01:20:20,161 --> 01:20:20,870
It looked like,
um,

1975
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:26,270
I saw the surgery part of the surgery 
back on camera and it looked like an 

1976
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:28,200
auto body shop fixing the car.
Yeah.

1977
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:31,860
There's a video of Tito Ortiz getting.
Is a disc replaced in his neck?

1978
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,010
She just got a disc fused.
I think you gotta.

1979
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,690
I'm not sure it was a spacer or disc 
replaced,

1980
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,270
but they're fucking hammering on his 
neck.

1981
01:20:39,271 --> 01:20:40,430
Like clink,
clink,

1982
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,110
clink,
clink,

1983
01:20:42,111 --> 01:20:43,070
clink.
Went,

1984
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:45,510
what the fuck?
That's his neck,

1985
01:20:45,511 --> 01:20:46,890
man.
That is insane.

1986
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:51,840
So what does it feel like now?
Now actually the hips feel okay.

1987
01:20:51,841 --> 01:20:53,360
If I lift heavy,
I still like,

1988
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,840
I'll still squat and dead lift.

1989
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:59,840
I just can't go as heavy as I used to 
have dead lifted up to 50 slash 50 with 

1990
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,010
two fake hips.
Jesus Christ.

1991
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:03,360
Not a very good deadlift and mark's 
world.

1992
01:21:03,361 --> 01:21:04,170
But you know,
for,

1993
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:06,150
for having the surgery and everything,
it's okay.

1994
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:08,830
And they're fine.
Like it doesn't mean they're built.

1995
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:12,210
Did you tell the doctor like give me 
some fucking series heavy duty ones,

1996
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:16,800
road road shocks,
there a titanium,

1997
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:18,420
you know,
and I had a lot of people say,

1998
01:21:18,421 --> 01:21:20,530
well why do you have to lift like that?
Why do you like,

1999
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:25,750
you know,
people always want to concern 

2000
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:25,750
themselves,
but you're doing.

2001
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:25,750
I'm like,
wait,

2002
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:26,970
why do you feel you need,
you have to lift like that.

2003
01:21:26,971 --> 01:21:28,250
It's just something that's ingrained in 
you.

2004
01:21:28,251 --> 01:21:30,840
You just like doing it.
If you had surgery and somebody told you

2005
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:33,180
why you have to fight still why you have
to go because you have to.

2006
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,490
Did you ask the doctor for a bigger 
Dick?

2007
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:38,550
That's an option.
Oh,

2008
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,370
now when they cut you open,
where do they cut you?

2009
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:44,160
A right on the.
On the side of your ass cheek Kinda.

2010
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:47,010
Is it a giant scar that's like that big 
like three or four inches.

2011
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:48,420
Wow.
That's amazing.

2012
01:21:48,421 --> 01:21:49,990
You do all that work with three or four 
inches?

2013
01:21:49,991 --> 01:21:54,991
Yeah.
Like I have a buddy who was on the US 

2014
01:21:54,991 --> 01:21:54,991
ski team.

2015
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:59,100
He was on the US ski team and uh,
he's had no bullshit,

2016
01:21:59,101 --> 01:22:01,290
I think 28 knee surgeries.
Wow.

2017
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:02,310
Yeah,
he's got,

2018
01:22:02,311 --> 01:22:05,400
I'll show you the surface of his knees.
Skiing is not good for your knees.

2019
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,830
He's had his knees resurfaced.
He's.

2020
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:10,470
Yeah,
it's fucking gnarly.

2021
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:13,070
Let me find this picture real quick and 
I'll show it to you because it's,

2022
01:22:13,071 --> 01:22:14,940
it's one of those where I show people 
and they go,

2023
01:22:14,941 --> 01:22:18,060
what am I looking at?
He um,

2024
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:20,550
but anyway,
his scars on his knee,

2025
01:22:20,551 --> 01:22:21,780
it looks like,
like,

2026
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:27,180
like you're gutting a fish,
like they go all the way down the side 

2027
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,460
of the knee and they opened it up and 
this was just in the eighties.

2028
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,290
My Dad has that.
My Dad has,

2029
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:36,570
you know,
fake knees also and he's got those big 

2030
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:36,570
scars.
Fuck man.

2031
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:39,920
Your Dad's got it rough.
He's a warrior Frankenstein that is a,

2032
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:42,030
that's a lot of fucking surgery.

2033
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:44,300
A lot of shit to get done on your body.
Yeah.

2034
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:49,700
Fake News and fake hips.
So you think that you're gonna 

2035
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:52,290
eventually have to do that to the knees?
Yeah,

2036
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:57,500
I like try to hold it off as long as 
possible and I think that the best way 

2037
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,830
to go is uh,
trying new therapies like stem cells,

2038
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:01,020
other things that are coming out.
Um,

2039
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,680
I know that certain,
uh,

2040
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,580
there's actually a gel that they can put
into knee,

2041
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,400
uh,
the replaced cartilage.

2042
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:09,240
Uh,
John,

2043
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:10,310
I hadn't done.
It's like a,

2044
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,160
it's a very advanced technique that,
you know,

2045
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:15,850
they're just basically they use very 
sparingly.

2046
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:17,320
Well,
I know that they're doing,

2047
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:22,770
they have this new meniscus surgery 
they're doing where they're taking this 

2048
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,840
like a scaffolding and they implanted 
inside where your meniscus,

2049
01:23:26,841 --> 01:23:31,841
she used to be in with these proteins in
it and somehow or another your body 

2050
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:35,551
grows meniscus in the scaffolding as it 
make sense that they're able to do.

2051
01:23:37,091 --> 01:23:39,700
Now it's just amazing.
Let me show you.

2052
01:23:39,701 --> 01:23:40,840
This is my buddy's knee.

2053
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,740
Wow.
Yeah,

2054
01:23:44,741 --> 01:23:46,960
that's the same guy that was on the US 
ski team.

2055
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:48,460
They cut them.
Steve Graham.

2056
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:49,810
What's up brother?
They cut them.

2057
01:23:49,811 --> 01:23:53,200
Just kind of like fish.
It looks like steak and like two wedding

2058
01:23:53,201 --> 01:23:56,440
rings.
It's fucking gnarly.

2059
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:58,590
Yeah,
it's pretty hardcore.

2060
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,650
I'll send this to you,
Jamie,

2061
01:23:59,651 --> 01:24:01,840
so you can put it up on the uh,
it looks great.

2062
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:03,580
Injuries are no joke,
you know?

2063
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:04,980
Yeah.
No,

2064
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:05,950
there are no drug.
Well,

2065
01:24:05,951 --> 01:24:07,240
this,
this guy too.

2066
01:24:07,241 --> 01:24:09,850
He's fucking crazy.
He's in his sixties.

2067
01:24:09,851 --> 01:24:12,430
He's still spars,
mma on a regular basis.

2068
01:24:12,431 --> 01:24:13,960
He's an animal.
He's a doctor.

2069
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:17,440
Ophthalmologist doesn't give a fuck.
He's,

2070
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:19,350
he's always been crazy.
He's just A.

2071
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:24,450
I've known this guy for it.
He's a guy who talked me into doing 

2072
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:24,450
standup has always been an animal.
He's just,

2073
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:25,810
uh,
it's just hard to imagine that.

2074
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:30,070
That's Shit I saw you do stand up in 
Sacramento,

2075
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:31,450
but two years ago maybe.

2076
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:33,610
Oh,
where was it at maybe three years ago?

2077
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:35,650
Um,
I don't know,

2078
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:38,350
like comedy store or some shit like 
that.

2079
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:41,380
Cool little upstairs comedy club.
That's a good spot.

2080
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:42,760
They have the punchline,
right?

2081
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:44,280
Yeah.
Yep.

2082
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:46,870
Do you live up there?
I commando Sacramento.

2083
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:48,940
Do you go to team Alpha male and watch 
those?

2084
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,950
You know,
I'm friends with those guys.

2085
01:24:50,951 --> 01:24:53,980
I haven't been over there a whole lot,
but I've seen you ride around.

2086
01:24:53,981 --> 01:24:56,290
I see those guys around a little bit 
here and there and he's got a huge,

2087
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,520
his own gym.
Huge Gym.

2088
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:58,480
Okay.
Give it a plug.

2089
01:24:58,481 --> 01:25:03,481
What's the name of the gym?
The super training gym just in West 

2090
01:25:03,481 --> 01:25:04,180
Sacramento,
but it doesn't matter because it's free.

2091
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:05,350
Yeah,
it's kind of weird.

2092
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:07,270
It's free.
The gym is free.

2093
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:09,430
How's that work?
It doesn't,

2094
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:13,510
it's not the smartest business models.
Not My brightest idea.

2095
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,460
What a gym is free.

2096
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:16,810
It's a way for me to,
um,

2097
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:21,840
give back to power lifting.
It's predominantly a power thing 

2098
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:21,840
facility.
Um,

2099
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,150
and I think that if other people had the
ability to make their gym free,

2100
01:25:25,151 --> 01:25:30,151
they probably would do it.
And so I'm in a position to make it for 

2101
01:25:30,151 --> 01:25:30,160
free.
So I did.

2102
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:31,810
Wow,
that's crazy.

2103
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:33,280
That's a,
that's a beautiful thing.

2104
01:25:33,281 --> 01:25:38,281
Then you never hear that.
You usually find exact opposite to what 

2105
01:25:38,281 --> 01:25:38,281
everybody asks for him.
Hey,

2106
01:25:38,281 --> 01:25:39,340
can you train me?
Can you train me?

2107
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:40,360
He's like,
I don't train people.

2108
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:42,610
I even do seminars and stuff a lot for 
free.

2109
01:25:42,611 --> 01:25:47,611
I just did one at a deuces gym in Venice
and then a lot of times I'll do them to 

2110
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,220
some down in downtown La at the Barbell 
Brigade,

2111
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:53,890
but just if I'm in town somewhere,
I'll just,

2112
01:25:53,891 --> 01:25:54,970
uh,
I'll just,

2113
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:58,390
I'll email email the owner of the gym to
say,

2114
01:25:58,391 --> 01:26:03,391
Hey,
I'd love to come in and teach your 

2115
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:03,391
people how to squat or deadlift.
And they're like,

2116
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:03,391
okay,
well what does it cost?

2117
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:03,800
I'm like,
it doesn't cost anything.

2118
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:06,710
That's so crazy.
End The fucking do some work.

2119
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:08,850
What makes you such a generous guy?
That's.

2120
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:14,660
I just kind of have a passion for 
inspiring people and not so much a just 

2121
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:18,400
instructing them because I think that 
the main message is to get people moving

2122
01:26:18,401 --> 01:26:20,840
and get people doing shit rather than 
just saying,

2123
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:21,530
oh,
here's how you,

2124
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:24,500
to people that we look up to you,
Louie Simmons,

2125
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:27,260
you know,
Louis sent Pat Miletich has a free gym,

2126
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,640
you know,
I don't know if he still has it,

2127
01:26:28,641 --> 01:26:33,641
but he had it free gym said to help 
people do what you couldn't do when you 

2128
01:26:33,641 --> 01:26:34,220
were younger.
You know,

2129
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,660
that's,
it's great for,

2130
01:26:35,661 --> 01:26:37,790
for young folks.
There's the fucking knee and it's all,

2131
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:38,770
it's good and you know,
uh,

2132
01:26:38,771 --> 01:26:39,440
to his,
uh,

2133
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:41,270
what,
what ended up happening is people,

2134
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,480
um,
I'll put up a post on instagram.

2135
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:47,930
It could be of like me eating food or 
some shit and somebody would say,

2136
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:49,030
oh,
I got your slingshot,

2137
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,390
I got your raps,
I got you're this,

2138
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:50,950
you're that.

2139
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,450
So it's like people are given back to me
anyway.

2140
01:26:53,451 --> 01:26:54,640
So it just,
um,

2141
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:58,490
it's just another way for me to give 
back to the community and for like a,

2142
01:26:58,491 --> 01:27:03,491
you said Reebok is,
is a brand of my company is not my 

2143
01:27:03,491 --> 01:27:07,211
company is me.
And so the brand is growing and 

2144
01:27:07,211 --> 01:27:07,211
sometimes people don't know that I'm 
associated with it,

2145
01:27:07,211 --> 01:27:09,350
but nine times out of 10 they do know 
I'm associated with it.

2146
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,970
That's awesome man.
That's a,

2147
01:27:10,971 --> 01:27:12,530
that's a beautiful way of looking at 
things.

2148
01:27:12,531 --> 01:27:17,531
I love it.
And because of that we were just 

2149
01:27:17,531 --> 01:27:19,541
actually at the coffee bean next door 
and these two guys wanted to take a 

2150
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:19,541
picture with them.
They're like,

2151
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:19,541
they know who,
you know,

2152
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:21,350
people know who he is.
Yeah.

2153
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:24,140
And it's funny because you tons of free 
videos,

2154
01:27:24,141 --> 01:27:26,290
youtube.com
backslash super training.

2155
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:29,270
Oh six thousands of free videos on there
on how to squat,

2156
01:27:29,271 --> 01:27:30,530
deadlift bench,
that kind of shit.

2157
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:34,160
Nice.
Now your new documentary is prescription

2158
01:27:34,161 --> 01:27:35,360
thugs.
Absolutely.

2159
01:27:35,361 --> 01:27:38,090
Yeah.
And this is based on your experience and

2160
01:27:38,091 --> 01:27:40,850
getting hooked on pain pills after you 
had your double hip replacement.

2161
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:45,910
Yeah.
Sort of based on a lot of people's 

2162
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:45,910
experience,
you know,

2163
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:45,910
after bigger,
stronger,

2164
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:49,091
faster.
Our older brother passed away about 

2165
01:27:49,091 --> 01:27:52,211
eight months after making that movie and
he had a really bad struggle with 

2166
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:54,860
prescription drugs,
mainly painkillers.

2167
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:56,390
Uh,
and then it went to,

2168
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:58,410
you know,
oxycotton when you could use it,

2169
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:00,770
used to be able to crush it up and 
inject it and all that,

2170
01:28:00,771 --> 01:28:05,771
stuff like that.
And he was getting into that kind of 

2171
01:28:05,771 --> 01:28:05,771
stuff.
Um,

2172
01:28:05,771 --> 01:28:09,070
I don't know if he's injecting it,
but he was definitely snorting it and 

2173
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:09,590
different things like that.
He loved it all.

2174
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:14,890
Yeah.
My parents found out about it and they 

2175
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:14,890
were obviously heartbroken and um,
helped him,

2176
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:17,120
helps him get clean for awhile and then,
you know,

2177
01:28:17,121 --> 01:28:19,490
then you go back to it and back and 
forth and back and forth.

2178
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
And um,
it's just crazy because he,

2179
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:26,300
after he got off all the pills,
sorta switched to alcohol,

2180
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:28,550
you know,
and it was like alcohol a little bit.

2181
01:28:28,551 --> 01:28:29,600
Everything else,
a lot of weed,

2182
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:31,160
a lot of alcohol and this and that,
you know,

2183
01:28:31,161 --> 01:28:32,050
just things that,
uh,

2184
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:37,600
that when you're not in the right state 
of mind or you're depressed or not the 

2185
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:37,600
best things for you,
you know.

2186
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,860
And he ended up,
seemed like from the day he ended up 

2187
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:43,830
going down like a really bad,
a bad,

2188
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:45,170
a bad spiral,
you know,

2189
01:28:45,171 --> 01:28:50,171
and he was on some psych meds to a for 
depression and different things like 

2190
01:28:50,171 --> 01:28:50,810
that.
And um,

2191
01:28:50,811 --> 01:28:55,040
he died in a sober living house with no 
real explanation of how he died.

2192
01:28:55,430 --> 01:29:00,430
And uh,
we still don't really know exactly what 

2193
01:29:00,430 --> 01:29:02,711
happened.
There was really no drugs found in his 

2194
01:29:02,711 --> 01:29:02,711
system in a toxicology report and stuff 
like that.

2195
01:29:02,711 --> 01:29:04,770
So it was just like,
to me something where,

2196
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:06,150
uh,
you know,

2197
01:29:06,151 --> 01:29:08,520
this is an epidemic that hit home with 
me,

2198
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:13,770
uh,
after I saw my brother died and I was 

2199
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:13,770
like,
I will never go down that path and there

2200
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:15,660
I am on the floor scrambling,
looking for like another Vicodin,

2201
01:29:15,661 --> 01:29:16,110
you know,
going,

2202
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:21,120
I must've dropped one somewhere and just
knowing a lot of other people that went 

2203
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:25,221
through it,
I decided to pick up and make a movie 

2204
01:29:25,221 --> 01:29:25,221
about it.
Now your brother in your bigger,

2205
01:29:25,221 --> 01:29:25,221
stronger,
faster.

2206
01:29:25,221 --> 01:29:26,790
Seemed like a very troubled guy.
Yeah.

2207
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:27,440
Mad Dog.
Yeah.

2208
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,580
He struggled with himself more so than 
anything else.

2209
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:34,470
He was bipolar and so all this stuff 
sort of compounded that.

2210
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:37,080
Yeah.
I think we get a prescription.

2211
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:42,081
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but did he get a prescription for an 

2212
01:29:42,081 --> 01:29:44,481
injury or how did he get it?
He was wrestling with the wwe who was 

2213
01:29:44,481 --> 01:29:44,481
sort of a,
you know,

2214
01:29:44,481 --> 01:29:45,280
on the going,
doing,

2215
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,170
doing the rounds.

2216
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:48,690
And so if you've got a prescription but 
he got drugs.

2217
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

2218
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:54,470
And they all got drugs.
When did he start wrestling for the wwe 

2219
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:55,350
pro?
Back in like 1990,

2220
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:59,040
like early nineties and he wrestled 
forever,

2221
01:29:59,041 --> 01:30:01,290
like he was always on tv or so,
93,

2222
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,630
something like that.
He was always on TV and then he wrestled

2223
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:06,690
all the way through.
I'm kind of up until he died.

2224
01:30:06,691 --> 01:30:11,691
Like he had some still some matches,
not really with wwe but with other 

2225
01:30:11,691 --> 01:30:15,690
smaller federations and stuff like that.
So he kind of wrestled for a real long 

2226
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:16,890
time,
but he never really made it and that was

2227
01:30:16,891 --> 01:30:18,610
a really big problem for him,
you know,

2228
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:21,090
it wasn't,
it wasn't good enough to be a good coach

2229
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:23,100
or a good teacher.
He wanted to.

2230
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:24,450
He wanted to make it.
He wanted to be.

2231
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:27,030
I don't know if he knew exactly what he 
was chasing.

2232
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:29,940
So even if he obtained some of that 
success,

2233
01:30:29,941 --> 01:30:32,720
I don't think he would even recognized 
it along the way.

2234
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:37,780
Point.
It's a really good point and I think a 

2235
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:37,780
lot of people,
yeah,

2236
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:40,251
they,
it's hard to get satisfied with certain 

2237
01:30:40,251 --> 01:30:40,251
things and so he was just,
he was troubled.

2238
01:30:40,251 --> 01:30:40,620
He,
you know,

2239
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:44,110
the quote that's on the wall in my gym 
is a from the film,

2240
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:46,020
he says,
I'd rather be dead than average.

2241
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:48,030
And that was uh,
something that he,

2242
01:30:48,031 --> 01:30:48,750
you know,
he just,

2243
01:30:48,751 --> 01:30:50,510
he couldn't live without,
um,

2244
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:55,880
you know,
being with whatever his ideal for 

2245
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:57,951
success was.
And the problem I think that you really 

2246
01:30:57,951 --> 01:30:58,380
just nailed though is that they don't 
know what that is.

2247
01:30:58,381 --> 01:31:00,300
What's that goal,
what is that?

2248
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,570
And if they don't ever reach it,
they never feel satisfied.

2249
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:05,800
And the thing is that he be,
despite it all,

2250
01:31:05,801 --> 01:31:08,730
that he's like the nicest,
coolest guy in the world.

2251
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:10,100
And we would have our backs,
you know,

2252
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,220
on a,
on everything today.

2253
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:12,360
You have good friends.
Yeah.

2254
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:16,350
He had crazy emotional really what 
everybody has,

2255
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:18,810
right?
They have good friends and then they get

2256
01:31:18,811 --> 01:31:20,460
into drugs and then they don't have good
friends,

2257
01:31:20,461 --> 01:31:22,530
you know.
So you have a lot of enabling people,

2258
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,680
a lot of people that will allow you to 
keep doing what you're doing.

2259
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:27,360
A lot of people that will put up with 
your bullshit.

2260
01:31:27,730 --> 01:31:29,340
Uh,
my father wasn't one of them,

2261
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:34,390
you know,
my father was somebody who like put his 

2262
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:34,420
foot down and was helping them get clean
and um,

2263
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:39,470
you know,
we just weren't able to catch it in 

2264
01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:39,470
time,
you know,

2265
01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:39,470
and so people that are listening to 
this,

2266
01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:41,280
I think it's really important to talk 
about these issues.

2267
01:31:41,281 --> 01:31:42,470
It's just a,
you know,

2268
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,360
people want to always trying to push 
these issues under the rug.

2269
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:50,360
So if he knows someone who's struggling,
try your best to reach out to them and 

2270
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:50,400
just see if you can get to the bottom of
the problem.

2271
01:31:50,401 --> 01:31:55,401
I know it's the worst fucking thing in 
the world to try to approach somebody 

2272
01:31:55,401 --> 01:31:56,130
about it,
but see if you know,

2273
01:31:56,131 --> 01:32:01,131
whatever you think is a good way of 
going about doing it and try to reach 

2274
01:32:01,131 --> 01:32:02,560
out to the person because you don't know
how much longer it will be here for.

2275
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:04,670
It's just so hard to get people to 
listen to you though,

2276
01:32:04,671 --> 01:32:05,410
isn't it?
It's brutal.

2277
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,180
It is,
yeah.

2278
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,340
When you've been through it,
it becomes a different.

2279
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:11,880
It completely becomes different.
So I,

2280
01:32:11,881 --> 01:32:13,510
I went through it,
I ended up,

2281
01:32:13,511 --> 01:32:18,511
um,
it's kind of crazy halfway through this 

2282
01:32:18,511 --> 01:32:21,690
film that I was making relapsing and 
started popping xanax and all sorts of 

2283
01:32:21,690 --> 01:32:23,920
other stuff.
Film on prescription drugs.

2284
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,420
You start relapsing?
Yes.

2285
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:27,760
Wow.
What the fuck?

2286
01:32:27,761 --> 01:32:30,130
Right.
That's how crazy.

2287
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:33,070
When did you do this film?
We finished it.

2288
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:36,460
We finished it for Tribeca film 
festival.

2289
01:32:36,461 --> 01:32:39,060
So that was like in May.
So you,

2290
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:42,910
you relapsed like a year ago,
a year and five months ago.

2291
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:44,320
Fuck.
And um,

2292
01:32:44,321 --> 01:32:46,300
I was popping xanax and stuff like that 
because you know,

2293
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,910
there's like,
filmmaking is not an easy business,

2294
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,200
you know,
cause like if you were,

2295
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:52,060
if you didn't have all this other stuff 
going on,

2296
01:32:52,061 --> 01:32:54,070
you were just a comic and you were 
trying to make it.

2297
01:32:54,071 --> 01:32:55,600
It's,
it's brutal.

2298
01:32:55,930 --> 01:33:00,930
You know,
the ups and downs and oh I have an 

2299
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:00,930
audition for something I've seen other 
people be successful can really beat you

2300
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:05,791
down,
fly by you that were like way behind 

2301
01:33:05,791 --> 01:33:05,791
you,
you know,

2302
01:33:05,791 --> 01:33:06,220
all these different things that go on in
your head.

2303
01:33:06,221 --> 01:33:08,690
You feel like that about the documentary
world.

2304
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:13,690
That's like people that were making some
documentaries that would do really well 

2305
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:13,990
and you get bummed out.
I wouldn't really get bummed out so much

2306
01:33:13,991 --> 01:33:18,991
about other people.
I try to always stay in my own lane and 

2307
01:33:18,991 --> 01:33:21,451
think about myself,
but I get more bummed out putting the 

2308
01:33:21,451 --> 01:33:22,330
pressure on myself.
Nobody elements do real well and you go,

2309
01:33:22,331 --> 01:33:23,600
God dammit,
why am I doing?

2310
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:26,230
I could have done that.
Or somebody makes a documentary and then

2311
01:33:26,231 --> 01:33:29,540
they're like off to the races doing like
all these big movies and you know,

2312
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:29,880
like,
why?

2313
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:31,510
Why didn't somebody pick me for that?
You know,

2314
01:33:31,511 --> 01:33:34,670
like my documentary did way better than 
that documentary or so you know,

2315
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:36,280
those kinds of things in,
in your eyes.

2316
01:33:36,281 --> 01:33:41,281
But just the film world in general,
Hollywood in general gave me this 

2317
01:33:41,281 --> 01:33:45,061
feeling of enact adequacy.
It gave me a feeling like I wasn't good 

2318
01:33:45,061 --> 01:33:45,061
enough.

2319
01:33:45,061 --> 01:33:45,910
Like everything I did,
I wasn't making it and people go,

2320
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:48,520
well you did this hit movie.
It was really big and like,

2321
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:53,521
yeah,
but it didn't really make money at the 

2322
01:33:53,521 --> 01:33:53,830
box office like it did really?
Which is a not your original intent.

2323
01:33:53,831 --> 01:33:55,030
Like when he made the film,
he said,

2324
01:33:55,031 --> 01:33:59,290
I want a lot of people to see the movie.
Tons of people seeing your language.

2325
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:02,260
When you say it gave you this feeling of
inadequacy,

2326
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:05,290
but isn't that maybe the way you 
approached it yourself?

2327
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:07,360
I mean,
it seems obvious giving you anything,

2328
01:34:07,361 --> 01:34:08,950
right?
I made that up in his own head.

2329
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:12,130
In your own head,
you feel inadequate.

2330
01:34:12,131 --> 01:34:13,090
You feel like,
Oh man,

2331
01:34:13,091 --> 01:34:13,620
you know,
I,

2332
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:16,450
you know,
and as many as many people tell you that

2333
01:34:16,451 --> 01:34:19,090
you do good,
you're still looking for,

2334
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,710
like you said,
you're still searching for that thing.

2335
01:34:20,711 --> 01:34:23,530
So for me it was all about finding 
balance.

2336
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:27,130
So when I relapsed and realize I need 
help,

2337
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,750
that's A.
I reached out.

2338
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:31,450
I didn't really reach out.
But once I,

2339
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:34,150
once I knew I needed help and everybody 
sort of figured me out,

2340
01:34:34,151 --> 01:34:36,550
my girlfriend helped me a lot with it.
Um,

2341
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:39,310
she sort of found me a really fucked up 
one day,

2342
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,240
a drunk and on,
on Xanax in the middle of the night.

2343
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:45,250
And uh,
she called me.

2344
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,200
I don't really answer my phone a whole 
lot.

2345
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,880
Um,
I don't respond to it,

2346
01:34:48,881 --> 01:34:53,881
a ton,
rings a lot and I get a lot of messages 

2347
01:34:53,881 --> 01:34:56,551
and shit,
so I'm not really a on my phone that 

2348
01:34:56,551 --> 01:34:57,770
much for that kind of stuff,
but I noticed a number of was odd and it

2349
01:34:57,771 --> 01:35:00,260
was probably like about midnight,
so it was like,

2350
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,470
it just seems kind of weird.
That's not like a telemarketer,

2351
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,360
you know,
like calling it like 7:00

2352
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:05,720
PM or something.

2353
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:08,720
This is something different and for 
whatever reason,

2354
01:35:08,721 --> 01:35:11,460
I didn't have her number in my phone,
um,

2355
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:13,280
but it was from like Pennsylvania or 
something,

2356
01:35:13,281 --> 01:35:16,070
I think where she's originally from.
And uh,

2357
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:18,140
it was lauren and she said,
you know,

2358
01:35:18,141 --> 01:35:20,060
your brother is blah,
blah,

2359
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:25,061
blah.
And I couldn't understand what she was 

2360
01:35:25,061 --> 01:35:25,061
saying.
She was very,

2361
01:35:25,061 --> 01:35:25,061
very,
a very sad and crying and stuff.

2362
01:35:25,061 --> 01:35:29,921
And so I asked her to kind of calmed 
down and I'm kind of assess the 

2363
01:35:29,921 --> 01:35:30,800
situation a little bit.
And she said,

2364
01:35:30,801 --> 01:35:32,510
I think your brother's in,
in his,

2365
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:33,770
uh,
apartment.

2366
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:35,910
I think he's passed out.
Um,

2367
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:36,620
I said,
well,

2368
01:35:36,621 --> 01:35:39,050
you're the only one there.
You got to kind of go in and,

2369
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:40,340
you know,
see what's,

2370
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:45,610
she's like,
I don't know how I'm going to find them 

2371
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:45,610
or,
and I was Kinda like,

2372
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:45,610
Whoa,
like,

2373
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:49,330
what do you mean you don't know how 
you're going to find them because I 

2374
01:35:49,330 --> 01:35:50,951
don't,
I didn't know how bad the situation was 

2375
01:35:50,951 --> 01:35:50,951
or how serious it was.

2376
01:35:50,951 --> 01:35:53,270
I did know his friend,
his friend called me a few times that,

2377
01:35:53,271 --> 01:35:53,780
hey man,
you know,

2378
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:54,660
your brothers,
you know,

2379
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:57,410
he's fucking up with some pills and 
doing this and that here and there.

2380
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:58,670
Um,
and then,

2381
01:35:58,671 --> 01:35:59,150
uh,
you know,

2382
01:35:59,230 --> 01:36:04,230
then then I would communicate with that 
person again and I'd find out that he's 

2383
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:06,170
doing a little bit better and then he'd 
be doing a little bit worse.

2384
01:36:06,171 --> 01:36:08,200
So it Kinda went back and forth and you 
know,

2385
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,220
having my other brother died from it.
I was like,

2386
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:12,590
fuck man,
I don't even know.

2387
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,930
I don't have the energy to fucking go 
down that road again.

2388
01:36:14,931 --> 01:36:16,170
You know,
I want to reach out to him.

2389
01:36:16,171 --> 01:36:17,630
I want to talk to him.
I do love him.

2390
01:36:17,631 --> 01:36:21,460
He's a hero and an idol to me and a lot 
of ways and uh,

2391
01:36:21,461 --> 01:36:26,461
I really did want to reach out to them,
but I just didn't know how to fucking 

2392
01:36:26,461 --> 01:36:26,461
bring it up,
but,

2393
01:36:26,461 --> 01:36:30,600
you know,
he was really suffering and I didn't 

2394
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:30,600
really realize how bad it was until she 
called.

2395
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:32,480
And then I got off the phone with her.
I just said,

2396
01:36:32,481 --> 01:36:37,481
you know,
take his keys away and make sure he's 

2397
01:36:37,481 --> 01:36:37,481
okay.
Talk to my wife,

2398
01:36:37,481 --> 01:36:41,171
my wife's fucking awesome.
She's super supportive about all this 

2399
01:36:41,171 --> 01:36:41,171
kind of stuff.
And she said,

2400
01:36:41,171 --> 01:36:42,380
we need to fly him here tomorrow,
you know.

2401
01:36:42,381 --> 01:36:43,160
And I said,
well,

2402
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:46,430
let's fly lauren here to make sure he 
gets on the fucking flight,

2403
01:36:46,431 --> 01:36:51,431
that he's not drinking or taking pills 
or doing something crazy and he misses 

2404
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:52,640
his flight.
So we flew both of them up.

2405
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:55,970
We're able to get him some treatment 
where he was able to,

2406
01:36:56,930 --> 01:36:58,760
uh,
work on starting to recover.

2407
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:01,120
It's a nasty path,
you know,

2408
01:37:01,121 --> 01:37:01,750
it's,
it's,

2409
01:37:01,751 --> 01:37:03,920
um,
did you document this in the film?

2410
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:07,820
I didn't document all the stuff that 
went down,

2411
01:37:07,821 --> 01:37:08,900
like leading up to it,
but yeah,

2412
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:13,990
it's,
it's in the film we talk about it for 

2413
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:13,990
sure.

2414
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:13,990
Um,
but like I said,

2415
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:16,580
it's a nasty path that like,
it's like a snowball effect,

2416
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:17,900
you know what I mean?
And looking,

2417
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:19,850
looking at it now,
it's like,

2418
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:23,060
I mean it's not funny ever but it's like
laughable how like,

2419
01:37:23,061 --> 01:37:24,860
what the fuck was I thinking,
you know,

2420
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:27,710
I can see it now from a different point 
of view.

2421
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:32,240
So you said you relapsed on Xanax.
So was it just you were having anxiety?

2422
01:37:32,330 --> 01:37:36,320
No,
I mean I think that it's just whatever,

2423
01:37:36,321 --> 01:37:38,040
you know,
you just like to take it because a,

2424
01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:39,250
it may,
you know,

2425
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:40,730
you can't sleep.
My,

2426
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:45,780
my mind is always racing.
There's always another idea in the head 

2427
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:45,780
and there's always,
I can't go to sleep,

2428
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:48,620
you know?
So I've tried the float,

2429
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:50,720
the float chambers.
I've tried stuff like that.

2430
01:37:50,721 --> 01:37:55,721
I can't even get my mind to stop 
thinking a lot of times or so I thought

2431
01:37:56,070 --> 01:38:01,070
so.
I always thought that I needed 

2432
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:01,070
something,
whether it was alcohol,

2433
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:02,040
whether it was pills,
and I realized through the whole journey

2434
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:07,130
that all I really needed was to believe 
in myself again to believe in who I 

2435
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:11,421
really was and what I started doing when
I started out trying to make films in 

2436
01:38:11,421 --> 01:38:13,200
the first place and tell the truth and 
be honest.

2437
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:15,390
The problem was I couldn't be honest 
with myself.

2438
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:20,630
I had a real hard time being honest with
myself and that's what a recovery has 

2439
01:38:20,630 --> 01:38:21,930
has brought to me.
It's,

2440
01:38:21,931 --> 01:38:23,850
uh,
it's amazing to be able to know how much

2441
01:38:23,851 --> 01:38:26,190
he's allowed to talk about the film,
but I'll talk about it a little bit.

2442
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:27,290
He,
uh,

2443
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:32,690
yeah,
he basically interviewed somebody for 

2444
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:32,690
the film.
Uh,

2445
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:33,060
the ended up helping him.
He interviewed this guy,

2446
01:38:33,061 --> 01:38:33,990
Richard Tate,
who,

2447
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:38,991
uh,
owns a treatment center in Malibu and 

2448
01:38:38,991 --> 01:38:38,991
he,
for his film,

2449
01:38:38,991 --> 01:38:43,371
he researched it and they had like a 95 
percent success rate with people that 

2450
01:38:43,371 --> 01:38:43,830
were there I think for over 60 days or 
something like that,

2451
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:45,840
90 days,
90 days.

2452
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,010
And he was like,
what the fuck?

2453
01:38:47,011 --> 01:38:49,050
Ninety five percent success rate.
That's crazy.

2454
01:38:49,051 --> 01:38:50,550
The whole time I'm interviewing the guy,
I'm like,

2455
01:38:50,551 --> 01:38:55,551
I wish I could come here.
I wish I could come here because I knew 

2456
01:38:55,551 --> 01:38:55,840
that I still had a problem with alcohol 
and um,

2457
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:59,130
I wasn't really doing xanax at the time,
but like he researched it for himself.

2458
01:38:59,190 --> 01:39:01,260
He's trying to tell him stuff.
He's researching for the film,

2459
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:03,000
but he's researched.
Weird thing,

2460
01:39:03,001 --> 01:39:04,190
man.
You start like looking,

2461
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,800
did you go to this place?
Yeah.

2462
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:08,880
I ended up going to cliffside Malibu for
90 days.

2463
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:14,300
So what do they do that so successful?
They just change your life about 

2464
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:18,891
everything.
But Richard Tate was a wild man himself 

2465
01:39:18,891 --> 01:39:18,891
and he gave me.
Here's the thing,

2466
01:39:18,891 --> 01:39:19,230
when you have a guide telling you,
listen,

2467
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:23,490
14 years ago I was on my couch smoking 
crack with a hooker on each side.

2468
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:25,980
I was oiled up for some reason.
Smoking,

2469
01:39:25,981 --> 01:39:26,850
cigar,
smoking,

2470
01:39:26,851 --> 01:39:28,020
crack,
you know,

2471
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:29,250
and those,
a good time.

2472
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:29,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

2473
01:39:30,710 --> 01:39:32,490
And it tells you,
you know,

2474
01:39:32,491 --> 01:39:35,730
that eight of his friends come and knock
on his door and try to get him sober and

2475
01:39:35,731 --> 01:39:38,460
he slams his door the door in his face.
And then,

2476
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:39,030
uh,
he's like,

2477
01:39:39,031 --> 01:39:39,910
you know what,
that was rude.

2478
01:39:39,911 --> 01:39:41,040
He goes back and opens the door.
He goes,

2479
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:42,090
what day is it?
And they said,

2480
01:39:42,091 --> 01:39:44,850
it's Friday.
And he goes,

2481
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:46,920
come back on a Monday.
And he slams the door.

2482
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:49,560
They come back on Monday.
He was like,

2483
01:39:49,561 --> 01:39:52,230
at that point,
just done doing drugs and alcohol and,

2484
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:53,850
uh,
they took them to treatment.

2485
01:39:53,851 --> 01:39:54,300
I'm like,
man,

2486
01:39:54,301 --> 01:39:56,730
if this guy can get better.
Like I wasn't doing,

2487
01:39:58,110 --> 01:39:59,310
I wasn't,
I wasn't that bad,

2488
01:39:59,311 --> 01:40:00,610
but I didn't have hookers.
Yeah,

2489
01:40:00,910 --> 01:40:03,540
at least I didn't know.
What did they do for you?

2490
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:09,550
What is,
what is the process of getting someone 

2491
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:10,380
to get 95 percent of people staying 
clean?

2492
01:40:10,430 --> 01:40:13,080
First part is a separation from the 
problem.

2493
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:18,550
Uh,
just just being away from drugs and 

2494
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:18,550
alcohol I think like Aa is a great 
thing,

2495
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:20,070
but for me,
if I would have went to an AA meeting,

2496
01:40:20,071 --> 01:40:21,510
I would have went home and drank that 
night.

2497
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:23,130
I needed to be.
For me,

2498
01:40:23,131 --> 01:40:25,830
I needed to be in a place where I 
couldn't get isolated.

2499
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:30,000
I needed to be isolated from it for a 
little while to get away from it.

2500
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:30,840
Uh,
the main,

2501
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:33,150
the main thing was therapy.
It's all therapeutic.

2502
01:40:33,151 --> 01:40:38,151
It's all like group therapy.
He goes sit in a group with people that 

2503
01:40:38,151 --> 01:40:39,550
are fucked up and you talk about your 
problems and in a,

2504
01:40:39,551 --> 01:40:43,590
in a good facility,
they had such good counselors there that

2505
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:44,940
they,
these people,

2506
01:40:44,941 --> 01:40:49,941
like it was a,
it was more about like being loved 

2507
01:40:49,941 --> 01:40:49,941
again,
feeling part of your,

2508
01:40:49,941 --> 01:40:51,390
you know,
I moved to La and I was on my own.

2509
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:54,160
I moved to La when I was 19 years from,
from New York.

2510
01:40:54,161 --> 01:40:56,800
My whole family was back east.
My brother moved out here,

2511
01:40:56,801 --> 01:41:01,801
eventually my older brother moved out of
here eventually and eventually my 

2512
01:41:01,801 --> 01:41:01,801
parents moved out here and we do have a 
close family too.

2513
01:41:01,801 --> 01:41:06,570
We have a really close family.
So to be away from your family and this 

2514
01:41:06,570 --> 01:41:09,760
whole time and not feel like any love 
from the world is a tough thing,

2515
01:41:09,761 --> 01:41:14,761
you know,
and like a lot of people don't really 

2516
01:41:14,761 --> 01:41:14,761
express that,
you know,

2517
01:41:14,761 --> 01:41:14,761
might sound kind of wimpy or something 
like that.

2518
01:41:14,761 --> 01:41:15,040
But it's true.
We didn't,

2519
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:20,060
there was no feeling of comfort or 
safety or security in anything that I,

2520
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:25,710
that I did.
So like regaining that through being 

2521
01:41:25,710 --> 01:41:29,281
around people with like minded 
experiences and there's just some 

2522
01:41:29,281 --> 01:41:31,120
counselors there that will break you.
You know,

2523
01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:32,740
there,
there's people that go there,

2524
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:38,070
hardcore heroin addicts that like will 
sit there and in group therapy and not 

2525
01:41:38,070 --> 01:41:40,190
want to be analyzed,
you know,

2526
01:41:40,630 --> 01:41:43,360
and these guys don't break them down 
until they're,

2527
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:45,850
you know,
punching pillows and shit saying this is

2528
01:41:45,851 --> 01:41:48,580
my father and fucking piece of Shit,
you know,

2529
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:50,170
that's how it goes.

2530
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:51,790
It's like,
it's a really intense,

2531
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,720
a therapeutic thing.
Uh,

2532
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:59,890
that allows you to see yourself in a 
different way and it's a very humbling.

2533
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,990
The number one thing is like,
uh,

2534
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:05,560
the number one thing that I had on my 
side was a desperation to get better.

2535
01:42:06,030 --> 01:42:07,750
That was one of the fucked up parts of 
the film.

2536
01:42:07,751 --> 01:42:08,260
Bigger,
stronger,

2537
01:42:08,261 --> 01:42:13,261
faster.
Was Your Dad saying they knew that your 

2538
01:42:13,261 --> 01:42:15,391
older brother was going to die that way 
and to go through that and then have 

2539
01:42:16,091 --> 01:42:21,091
your brother die that way and then for 
you to get hooked on pills yourself 

2540
01:42:21,091 --> 01:42:23,240
that,
that hadn't been a helpless feeling.

2541
01:42:23,241 --> 01:42:25,330
Like that's why I felt like I couldn't 
tell anybody.

2542
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:30,870
So I went to my parents and I was doing 
an interview with them and I really 

2543
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:31,270
wanted to tell him,
but I was like,

2544
01:42:31,670 --> 01:42:32,920
you know,
I don't know if I can tell them.

2545
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:37,390
So early on in the movie before I,
before I had relapsed,

2546
01:42:37,391 --> 01:42:37,780
I said,
hey,

2547
01:42:37,781 --> 01:42:39,220
listen,
I had a problem with this.

2548
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:41,320
My mom cries.
And she's like,

2549
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:42,280
well,
why didn't you tell me?

2550
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:43,450
I'm like,
how am I supposed to tell you?

2551
01:42:43,451 --> 01:42:48,451
You just lost a son.
I'm going to tell you like I'm going to 

2552
01:42:48,451 --> 01:42:48,451
go,
you know,

2553
01:42:48,451 --> 01:42:50,200
next year you're going to worry about me
because I'm not there.

2554
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:55,320
You know what is.
If you can try to describe what is the 

2555
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:57,220
feeling like when you want to take that 
shit,

2556
01:42:57,490 --> 01:42:59,620
when you want to take a pain pill,
like what?

2557
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:01,240
What is.
There is no feeling.

2558
01:43:01,241 --> 01:43:01,800
It's a,
it's,

2559
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:04,360
it's not.
It's not the addicts fault.

2560
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:05,510
Like you might have,
you know,

2561
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:10,330
friends or people that you know that I 
want to just wake up and stop drinking.

2562
01:43:10,331 --> 01:43:11,830
Well you can't.
It's not your fault anymore.

2563
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:13,960
It's a,
it's a pathway,

2564
01:43:13,961 --> 01:43:15,160
a neurological pathway.

2565
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:17,310
You just talked about before Brock 
Lesnar,

2566
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:21,070
somebody got a hold of them and built 
those punches and kicks into his system.

2567
01:43:21,071 --> 01:43:26,071
Right?
It becomes ingrained and built in your 

2568
01:43:26,071 --> 01:43:28,681
system.
It becomes a neurological pathway in 

2569
01:43:28,681 --> 01:43:30,070
your brain and you tend to habituate the
things that make you feel good.

2570
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:35,670
You know?
So that's just something that an addict 

2571
01:43:35,670 --> 01:43:37,741
will do more so than other people.
You're saying that this is very distinct

2572
01:43:37,781 --> 01:43:39,460
black and white thing,
that it's not the,

2573
01:43:39,461 --> 01:43:40,900
the,
the addicts fault,

2574
01:43:40,901 --> 01:43:45,490
but the addict has to be sober first 
before they can get fucked up.

2575
01:43:45,491 --> 01:43:46,540
Right.
So you're sober,

2576
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:49,090
you're sober,
you have a conscious mind,

2577
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:53,090
you're aware of your actions and decide 
to take a pain pill.

2578
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:56,150
How is that not the addicts fault?
If you're already addicted?

2579
01:43:56,151 --> 01:43:58,160
It's,
it's an automatic thing.

2580
01:43:58,161 --> 01:44:00,100
Your body feels like it needs it.
Okay.

2581
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:02,210
You,
we're an addicted maybe because he never

2582
01:44:02,211 --> 01:44:03,270
got actual treatment.

2583
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,760
How do you get addicted in the first 
place,

2584
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:07,280
but you weren't because you were off of 
it for a long time.

2585
01:44:07,281 --> 01:44:09,950
Right.
So it wasn't like he had this mad need,

2586
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:12,350
like your bones were aching.
You had to get that.

2587
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:16,280
I think you switched to alcohol I think 
is kind of the part that you're at.

2588
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:21,490
Yeah,
I switched to alcohol like instead of 

2589
01:44:21,490 --> 01:44:21,490
having pills,
so I always had something.

2590
01:44:21,490 --> 01:44:23,190
So you get the double hip replacement 
surgery.

2591
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:25,850
So you did your documentary bigger,
stronger,

2592
01:44:25,851 --> 01:44:29,510
faster was 2008.
So right after that,

2593
01:44:29,511 --> 01:44:31,190
2009.
Like when are you talking about?

2594
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:33,170
You're getting your hip replaced in 
2009.

2595
01:44:33,171 --> 01:44:34,370
Okay.
Six years ago.

2596
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:38,720
And then how you get off the shit?
Our 2007.

2597
01:44:38,721 --> 01:44:43,721
I actually got to replace.
I got it done before we finished the 

2598
01:44:43,721 --> 01:44:43,721
movie.
Okay.

2599
01:44:43,721 --> 01:44:44,020
Okay.
Oh you did 2017.

2600
01:44:44,190 --> 01:44:45,980
But then.
But then I didn't mention this.

2601
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:48,710
So then I had um,
my hip,

2602
01:44:48,711 --> 01:44:50,450
they said,
I said they had complications.

2603
01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:52,460
I had,
they had to Redo my hip.

2604
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:54,300
Oh.
So two years later they,

2605
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:57,580
we did it in 2009.
They redid my right hip.

2606
01:44:57,710 --> 01:45:00,590
They completely took it out and put it 
back together.

2607
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:02,690
Oh my,
screw it.

2608
01:45:03,050 --> 01:45:08,050
Well,
there's some messed up parts in there 

2609
01:45:08,050 --> 01:45:08,420
that they have to unscrew that thing 
that I think they left that.

2610
01:45:08,421 --> 01:45:13,421
I think that was fine.
I think it's the other part that was 

2611
01:45:13,421 --> 01:45:15,611
messed up.
And then a month after I had that hip 

2612
01:45:15,611 --> 01:45:15,611
surgery,
my brother died,

2613
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:17,930
you know,
and it's just tough.

2614
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:18,560
It's just,
you know,

2615
01:45:18,561 --> 01:45:23,561
it's like you can,
you can power through that stuff if you 

2616
01:45:23,561 --> 01:45:27,281
have the tools.
But I didn't have any tools to stay 

2617
01:45:27,281 --> 01:45:30,791
sober or let me ask you this.
So you get the hip replacement surgery 

2618
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:31,400
the first time,
then you get hooked on pills,

2619
01:45:31,401 --> 01:45:36,401
then you get off pills,
but two years later they want to reopen 

2620
01:45:36,401 --> 01:45:36,401
you up.

2621
01:45:36,401 --> 01:45:38,930
Do you take pills again?
And got back on pills for how long?

2622
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,200
About another two years.
And then,

2623
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:45,590
and then what happened was,
so then I went I fucking years.

2624
01:45:45,591 --> 01:45:47,960
Yeah.
So then I went back to uh,

2625
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:53,200
to try to get off the pills.
Like I knew I needed to get off the 

2626
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:53,200
pillow long.
Where you want them for the first time.

2627
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,780
The first time when you had the first 
problem a I was on them almost.

2628
01:45:55,820 --> 01:45:58,370
I was on them for like a year and then I
got off of him,

2629
01:45:58,890 --> 01:45:59,840
uh,
for how long,

2630
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:05,110
but I only got off them for a couple 
months and I had the second surgery 

2631
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:06,440
again.
So it was a really gotten off of them.

2632
01:46:06,570 --> 01:46:07,670
It's a really up and down.
Thanks.

2633
01:46:07,671 --> 01:46:12,210
So the drug called suboxone and suboxone
sort of mimics the way that a painkiller

2634
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:14,040
will feel in your body.
Uh,

2635
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:15,680
but it doesn't have.

2636
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,020
Well it doesn't,
it doesn't get you high.

2637
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:20,660
It'll just basically making it not feel 
sick.

2638
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:22,940
So that's the biggest problem is 
withdrawals.

2639
01:46:22,941 --> 01:46:25,610
You feel so bad.
It's like the flu times 100.

2640
01:46:25,910 --> 01:46:30,910
So the thing is that when you're coming 
off of them and you want to get on 

2641
01:46:30,910 --> 01:46:30,980
suboxone.
So my,

2642
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:35,300
my insurance would cover all the pills 
so there was 10 bucks a pop,

2643
01:46:35,710 --> 01:46:40,710
you know,
10 bucks for like 180 pills of percocet 

2644
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:42,710
or vicodin or whatever the drug I was 
taken when I wanted to get off of them,

2645
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:47,980
I had to consult with a doctor every 
month for $250 and I had to pay about 

2646
01:46:47,980 --> 01:46:51,390
225 to $250.
The drug and insurance doesn't cover any

2647
01:46:51,391 --> 01:46:53,550
of that.
They don't cover you getting better,

2648
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:56,070
they only cover you doing the dangerous 
drugs.

2649
01:46:57,490 --> 01:46:59,010
That's another brutal thing on top of 
it,

2650
01:46:59,011 --> 01:47:01,350
you know?
And then suboxone I think that is.

2651
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:03,300
Do you think that's built into the 
system?

2652
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:06,090
Do they sell more drugs built into the 
system?

2653
01:47:06,091 --> 01:47:08,370
So that's a scary thought,
if that's true.

2654
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,310
Yeah.
That they absolutely like if you look at

2655
01:47:11,311 --> 01:47:11,920
it,
if you want to.

2656
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:13,410
If it's like,
you know,

2657
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:15,510
like yes,
if you take painkillers,

2658
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:18,930
it's your fault for getting addicted,
kind of.

2659
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:21,450
But if you actually look at the history 
of Oxycontin,

2660
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:26,660
that drug was designed to hook people on
what's basically very similar to heroin.

2661
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:27,750
You know,
it's,

2662
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:28,440
it's uh,
it,

2663
01:47:28,490 --> 01:47:32,730
the drug company that makes it,
that made it purdue pharmaceuticals,

2664
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:34,890
they,
they lied,

2665
01:47:35,070 --> 01:47:36,000
they,
you know,

2666
01:47:36,001 --> 01:47:38,400
they made $8,000,000,000
on this drug,

2667
01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:40,020
right?
$8,000,000,000.

2668
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:42,390
And then they had to pay a fine of 
$2,000,000,000.

2669
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:43,640
So like,
look at the profit,

2670
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:48,660
still $6,000,000,000.
They call it the price of doing 

2671
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:48,660
business,
you know,

2672
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:50,790
so they lied and said that you will not 
get addicted using this drug.

2673
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:56,090
Well,
they got the whole country addicted to 

2674
01:47:56,090 --> 01:47:56,090
this drug,
you know,

2675
01:47:56,090 --> 01:47:56,220
it was,
those people should all be in prison.

2676
01:47:56,910 --> 01:48:01,910
They got the whole,
the whole country addicted to a drug 

2677
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:01,910
that's made for like severe cancer 
patients,

2678
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:03,850
you know.
And that kind of stuff is,

2679
01:48:03,890 --> 01:48:05,550
is this criminal?
And people go like,

2680
01:48:05,551 --> 01:48:06,630
oh,
well you should have known.

2681
01:48:06,631 --> 01:48:10,200
It's like most people don't know.
That's why we're making a movie.

2682
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:11,250
To have awareness,
you know,

2683
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:14,430
for these things.
So this is really fresh for you.

2684
01:48:14,431 --> 01:48:19,320
This is not something that you have 
overcome a long time ago.

2685
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:19,950
No,
no.

2686
01:48:19,951 --> 01:48:22,440
I still go to meetings and I still stay 
up on it.

2687
01:48:22,441 --> 01:48:25,020
I think every day you need to remind 
yourself that you can go back there.

2688
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:27,650
So you're 100 percent sober now.
You don't fuck with no.

2689
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:29,670
Nothing.
Nothing.

2690
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:33,870
So the feeling that you get like when,
when you,

2691
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:38,960
when you have this relapse with a Xanax,
that feeling that you get,

2692
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:41,370
is it just,
you just feel helpless?

2693
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:43,740
Like what do you do?
You feel just pulled to it?

2694
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:45,470
Like what do you.
What's pulling?

2695
01:48:45,860 --> 01:48:47,370
Yeah,
like for example,

2696
01:48:47,371 --> 01:48:52,320
so xanax was a drug that would help me,
I would drink a lot,

2697
01:48:52,650 --> 01:48:57,650
you know,
like I wasn't because because I was an 

2698
01:48:57,650 --> 01:48:58,260
addict why he'd,
he'd kind of drank to the point where,

2699
01:48:58,370 --> 01:49:03,370
you know,
it was a compromising the next day type 

2700
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:05,781
of thing.
And then also you ended up in the 

2701
01:49:05,781 --> 01:49:05,781
hospital a couple of times from 
drinking.

2702
01:49:05,781 --> 01:49:06,960
Yeah.
I would say serious bouts of drinking,

2703
01:49:06,961 --> 01:49:09,420
but it wasn't like he really knows this,
but I went to the,

2704
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:13,530
to the uh,
urgent care or emergency room I think 10

2705
01:49:13,531 --> 01:49:16,730
times within a matter of like 20 days.
What's,

2706
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:21,830
yeah,
because I go to urgent care and I'd go 

2707
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:22,650
get xanax because I had a hangover so 
bad because I would drink so much,

2708
01:49:22,710 --> 01:49:25,410
you know,
and it was continuous like every day.

2709
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:28,110
So for me it became,
it became a labor.

2710
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:30,270
It became like everyday I was like,
you know,

2711
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:32,600
uh,
this cat chasing its tail.

2712
01:49:32,601 --> 01:49:37,601
I,
I ever get better or feel better at 

2713
01:49:37,601 --> 01:49:38,220
first.
You weren't drinking that often though,

2714
01:49:38,221 --> 01:49:39,460
right?
No,

2715
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:41,740
at first it was like every three days,
seven days,

2716
01:49:42,170 --> 01:49:43,260
you know,
we talked about it,

2717
01:49:43,261 --> 01:49:45,720
power lifting and everything like that.
We were sports guys,

2718
01:49:45,721 --> 01:49:47,890
like we were never into drinking,
were never into drugs.

2719
01:49:47,891 --> 01:49:48,060
Like

2720
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:50,470
that wasn't something even on my radar 
when I did bigger,

2721
01:49:50,471 --> 01:49:51,070
stronger,
faster,

2722
01:49:51,071 --> 01:49:52,360
I would drink,
you know,

2723
01:49:52,361 --> 01:49:57,361
here and there.
But I should have known back then 

2724
01:49:57,361 --> 01:50:00,661
because like when I did drink it was 
like binge drinking and that's when you 

2725
01:50:00,661 --> 01:50:03,541
know that you'll probably have a problem
somewhere down the road if you're the 

2726
01:50:03,541 --> 01:50:05,230
guy that drinks and you got the guy that
drinks once a month,

2727
01:50:05,231 --> 01:50:08,380
but you get completely hammered,
you know that you might have a problem.

2728
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:13,470
You know,
I wasn't the guy that could ever put it 

2729
01:50:13,470 --> 01:50:13,470
down.
So how,

2730
01:50:13,470 --> 01:50:16,380
what does it feel like to make a 
documentary about prescription drugs 

2731
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:16,450
while you're hooked on prescription 
drugs?

2732
01:50:16,710 --> 01:50:21,670
A guilty really guilty the whole time.
Like I had raised the money to do it.

2733
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:24,760
That was moving forward with it.
Had a bunch of people involved.

2734
01:50:24,761 --> 01:50:26,230
So I'm like,
who the fuck do I tell?

2735
01:50:26,830 --> 01:50:31,830
You know,
you're in this weird situation where 

2736
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:34,201
you're like,
I'm a hypocrite but I can't stop what I 

2737
01:50:34,201 --> 01:50:35,350
just stopped doing this and pull the 
plug and I have people working for me.

2738
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:39,340
People editing the film.
A partner Greg young was there since the

2739
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:40,920
very beginning and he was,
you know,

2740
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:46,230
he knew what was going on,
but he didn't know was going to do to 

2741
01:50:46,230 --> 01:50:46,900
like pull the plug on his own job and 
he,

2742
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:49,810
he didn't,
he cared about me and wanted to help me,

2743
01:50:50,230 --> 01:50:52,150
but he didn't know how to help me.
You know,

2744
01:50:52,151 --> 01:50:55,180
how much of a part of the film does this
become a,

2745
01:50:55,470 --> 01:50:57,010
it's,
it's sort of a,

2746
01:50:57,550 --> 01:50:58,900
towards,
towards the end.

2747
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:00,570
Uh,
it's sort of like in the,

2748
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:02,470
in the third act of the film,
you know,

2749
01:51:02,471 --> 01:51:05,140
we sort of discuss it and go into it.
Uh,

2750
01:51:05,141 --> 01:51:10,141
we didn't go into a whole lot about 
recovery because of the movie isn't 

2751
01:51:10,141 --> 01:51:10,270
really about that,
but anyway,

2752
01:51:10,271 --> 01:51:11,110
by the end of the movie,
you know,

2753
01:51:11,111 --> 01:51:11,620
I'm okay.

2754
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:15,550
And if a whole quarter,
a whole quarter of a year,

2755
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:17,140
you know,
that's crazy.

2756
01:51:17,141 --> 01:51:19,930
They,
they take you away from society for very

2757
01:51:19,931 --> 01:51:21,510
few people can afford to do that.
No,

2758
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:23,470
it's crazy man.
And what happened was,

2759
01:51:23,471 --> 01:51:25,450
uh,
if I feel this,

2760
01:51:25,451 --> 01:51:29,650
I feel almost everybody,
if they could unplug from their life for

2761
01:51:29,651 --> 01:51:32,440
like 30 days,
even like 10 days,

2762
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:35,660
like people go on vacation,
they still bring your phone and stuff.

2763
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:40,680
A lot of people around them that they 
know and it's supposed to be in that 

2764
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:43,411
environment of solitude is just like an 
amazing feeling that I'm though dark.

2765
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:44,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

2766
01:51:44,970 --> 01:51:47,340
Going dark,
what happened to me was in the,

2767
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:50,680
so yes,
how they helped me and um,

2768
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:54,930
I could tell you that I think part of it
a big huge part of it and they've talked

2769
01:51:54,931 --> 01:51:57,520
about like Aa and all these other 
programs and everything ever talks about

2770
01:51:57,521 --> 01:51:58,540
a spiritual awakening.

2771
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:03,700
So the third day that I was in Rehab,
I went and took a shower and it was like

2772
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:05,410
4:00
in the morning or something.

2773
01:52:05,411 --> 01:52:07,240
I couldn't even,
I couldn't sleep or anything.

2774
01:52:07,241 --> 01:52:11,380
And I went in the shower and I just 
cried for like three hours.

2775
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:14,440
The fuck am I doing.
I went to USC film school,

2776
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:16,120
I went,
I did all the right things.

2777
01:52:16,150 --> 01:52:18,310
I,
I trained my whole life.

2778
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:23,580
I did everything the right way and I'm 
fucking blowing it and that's what got 

2779
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:24,220
to me,
you know,

2780
01:52:24,221 --> 01:52:26,740
it was my self that got to me.
It wasn't,

2781
01:52:26,770 --> 01:52:28,450
it wasn't anybody else really.
You know,

2782
01:52:28,690 --> 01:52:31,960
another thing that happened to them in 
treatment was a cliff side.

2783
01:52:31,961 --> 01:52:34,810
Malibu is beautiful,
multimillion dollar facility.

2784
01:52:34,811 --> 01:52:36,790
It's a,
it's really nice.

2785
01:52:36,791 --> 01:52:38,650
It's in fucking Malibu,
California,

2786
01:52:38,651 --> 01:52:42,040
which is beautiful.
But I think once you were there for like

2787
01:52:42,041 --> 01:52:47,041
two weeks,
they took you away from there and three 

2788
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:47,041
and some shit hole.
Right?

2789
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:47,041
Yeah.
What happened was that,

2790
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:51,460
so I was there for.
I personally think it's all part of the 

2791
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:51,460
plan,
but I don't know.

2792
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:52,000
Yeah,
I was there for 10 days and um,

2793
01:52:52,050 --> 01:52:53,900
and after 10 days,
uh,

2794
01:52:53,901 --> 01:52:55,990
I was being helped by the facility.
They,

2795
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:57,530
they were,
they were funding it.

2796
01:52:57,531 --> 01:52:59,030
They were helping me.
So,

2797
01:52:59,031 --> 01:53:00,980
um,
since they were helping me out because I

2798
01:53:00,981 --> 01:53:04,450
was part of this movie and the guy just 
had compassion for me,

2799
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:06,200
Richard Tate and wanted to see me get 
better.

2800
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:11,230
The guy was suspicious that you had a 
problem when you came here the first 

2801
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:11,230
time to interview them anyway.
Right,

2802
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:11,840
exactly.
And so,

2803
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:17,260
so he said to me,
we can't afford to keep you here 

2804
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:19,601
anymore.
It's 60 grand a month to go to that 

2805
01:53:19,601 --> 01:53:19,601
place.
Jesus Christ,

2806
01:53:19,601 --> 01:53:20,400
a lot of insurance covers it,
you know,

2807
01:53:20,430 --> 01:53:21,550
and things like that.
Yeah,

2808
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:25,120
insurance covers that.
It depends on your double scam.

2809
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:27,550
So it's the fucking insurance covers 
that they may go.

2810
01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:33,660
It's all part of the system.
So it's all part of the system in some 

2811
01:53:33,660 --> 01:53:34,060
box money for that.
Yeah.

2812
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:38,000
So it's hard to come up with that money.
I need money for that.

2813
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:39,080
Sorry.
Yeah.

2814
01:53:39,081 --> 01:53:44,081
But the,
but they have the money for the 

2815
01:53:44,081 --> 01:53:44,081
treatment.
Everything.

2816
01:53:44,081 --> 01:53:44,081
So anyway,
throw you in this place.

2817
01:53:44,081 --> 01:53:47,711
That's not so good.
So what happened was I went to a place 

2818
01:53:47,711 --> 01:53:50,711
called Claire Foundation.
It's in Santa Monica and it's very 

2819
01:53:50,711 --> 01:53:50,990
industrial.
It's a,

2820
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:55,110
it's a government run Rehab facility.
Uh,

2821
01:53:55,190 --> 01:54:00,190
and it's,
I mean I walked in there and saw this 

2822
01:54:00,190 --> 01:54:02,030
guy with no teeth and he was scratching 
his nuts and he's like,

2823
01:54:02,031 --> 01:54:05,060
you're not going to like it in here.
The pillows are really tough,

2824
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:07,040
you know,
and I walk in,

2825
01:54:07,041 --> 01:54:08,630
I'm like,
where the fuck do you sleep in here?

2826
01:54:08,631 --> 01:54:10,100
And I'm looking and there's all these 
bunk beds.

2827
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:11,240
I'm like,
well where's my room?

2828
01:54:11,870 --> 01:54:12,380
And I'm like,
no,

2829
01:54:12,381 --> 01:54:17,381
there is no room.
It's one big room with 40 bunk beds and 

2830
01:54:17,381 --> 01:54:18,760
40 grown men and 39 of them just got out
of jail and you're the only one.

2831
01:54:18,761 --> 01:54:20,690
It's normal kind of,
you know,

2832
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:25,700
it was sort of a facility like that.
Whereas this is something out of like 

2833
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:29,150
one flew over the cuckoo's nest and when
they put me in there that was like,

2834
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:31,910
fuck this man this,
you know,

2835
01:54:31,950 --> 01:54:33,650
I know like a lot of addicts will say 
like,

2836
01:54:33,651 --> 01:54:38,651
I'm not like that and I'm not like this.
This was something that was so far 

2837
01:54:38,651 --> 01:54:42,401
fetched from where I would ever find 
myself in my life so far down that I was

2838
01:54:43,161 --> 01:54:43,910
like,
fuck this,

2839
01:54:43,911 --> 01:54:48,911
I'm getting Outta here and this is it.
I'm never going to drink or do a drug 

2840
01:54:48,911 --> 01:54:49,430
again.
And it'll hopefully,

2841
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:50,960
hopefully you can stick to that,
you know?

2842
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:53,300
Um,
but I don't have any urges to anymore.

2843
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:58,070
But it was that facility that um,
that really cemented it,

2844
01:54:58,071 --> 01:55:00,110
you know,
after that's the only 10 days,

2845
01:55:00,111 --> 01:55:05,111
so why I was in that facility for 19 
days and it was like about 10 days in 10

2846
01:55:05,391 --> 01:55:06,310
days,
days,

2847
01:55:07,190 --> 01:55:08,930
19 days there.
And then,

2848
01:55:09,050 --> 01:55:14,050
and then when I got,
when they had ruined for me back at 

2849
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:17,921
cliffside and it ended up going back to 
Malibu and like living out the rest of 

2850
01:55:17,921 --> 01:55:21,461
it in Malibu.
And what was really nice about that was 

2851
01:55:21,461 --> 01:55:23,861
I was still able to work,
so I was going to treatment every day 

2852
01:55:23,861 --> 01:55:26,250
for three hours in the morning and then 
I would drive to la and I would,

2853
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:27,860
I would work on the movie the rest of 
the time.

2854
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:31,490
It's pretty twisted,
but it all worked out,

2855
01:55:31,491 --> 01:55:36,491
you know.
But you pretty much feel like you were 

2856
01:55:36,491 --> 01:55:36,491
done after you went to that shit hole,
right?

2857
01:55:36,530 --> 01:55:41,530
Yeah.
But you just felt like you needed more 

2858
01:55:41,530 --> 01:55:41,530
treatment to cement it is like,
what's the thought process,

2859
01:55:41,530 --> 01:55:41,530
you know,
like,

2860
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:43,710
uh,
it's hard.

2861
01:55:43,711 --> 01:55:44,070
It's hard

2862
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,140
to explain to people that haven't been 
through it.

2863
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:47,710
Um,
people have been through it.

2864
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:53,000
They know what it's like a,
but addiction addiction is one of the 

2865
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,410
most powerful forces in this universe.
It's one of the,

2866
01:55:55,730 --> 01:56:00,120
it's something that drives people 
everyday to do bad shit,

2867
01:56:00,230 --> 01:56:02,730
you know,
and continued support,

2868
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:03,870
right?
Yeah.

2869
01:56:03,871 --> 01:56:05,430
You basically just need.
Yeah.

2870
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:09,060
Basically,
like a lot of it's set off by trauma,

2871
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:12,150
like things that happened in your life.
A lot of it's uh,

2872
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:17,480
you know,
but I didn't really have that like one 

2873
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:17,480
main trauma that like set it off.
People go,

2874
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:18,120
well,
your brother died.

2875
01:56:18,121 --> 01:56:18,810
I was like,
well that was,

2876
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:21,230
it wasn't as dramatic as it sounds like.
It.

2877
01:56:21,340 --> 01:56:24,540
Of course it's a traumatic but.
But I was,

2878
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:27,090
I was doing stuff before that.
So what was before that?

2879
01:56:27,091 --> 01:56:29,730
I don't even know.
Maybe the hip surgery didn't seem to me.

2880
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:34,940
I think a big part of it for me was 
having the hip surgery took away 

2881
01:56:34,940 --> 01:56:35,910
something that I really loved,
which was like lifting,

2882
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:37,320
you know,
something that like,

2883
01:56:37,321 --> 01:56:39,660
if you couldn't fight anymore,
you'd fucking hate it.

2884
01:56:39,810 --> 01:56:40,880
You know,
you'd be like bombed,

2885
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:46,100
grumpy because there was a part of it 
just in your everyday life and now it's 

2886
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:46,100
gone.
Yeah,

2887
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:46,740
and it might sound stupid,
but it's part is,

2888
01:56:46,741 --> 01:56:47,880
it's something that you do,
you know,

2889
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,020
if I said,
hey joe,

2890
01:56:49,021 --> 01:56:50,570
you know what,
no more fighting bro.

2891
01:56:50,610 --> 01:56:53,220
You're done.
So you just felt like just a giant loss.

2892
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:58,280
You just felt like something was missing
from your life and that's what led you 

2893
01:56:58,280 --> 01:56:59,160
to just start getting fucked up,
fill it in with other stuff,

2894
01:56:59,161 --> 01:57:00,570
you know.
Wow.

2895
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:06,140
When you didn't think about maybe like 
trying something healthy and trying to 

2896
01:57:06,140 --> 01:57:08,580
engineer your life and sort of a way or 
we do something.

2897
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:10,830
Okay.
So when you take away working out what's

2898
01:57:10,831 --> 01:57:13,430
healthy,
what you couldn't do any working out?

2899
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:15,480
Not,
I mean not a whole lot.

2900
01:57:15,510 --> 01:57:17,750
Not,
not like I used to and now that long,

2901
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:20,520
I mean just just for like years.
I just,

2902
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:21,590
I just felt shitty,
you know,

2903
01:57:21,630 --> 01:57:23,750
I just didn't feel good.
I'm the hips.

2904
01:57:23,790 --> 01:57:26,310
Yeah.
I think he also felt lonely too.

2905
01:57:26,311 --> 01:57:27,060
I mean,
you know,

2906
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:27,570
he,
he,

2907
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:32,590
he didn't have her until more recently 
and even though our family is in 

2908
01:57:32,590 --> 01:57:33,470
California,
you know,

2909
01:57:33,570 --> 01:57:37,020
I have two children,
so our parents moved to this.

2910
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:39,720
They were from New York originally.
They moved to California,

2911
01:57:39,721 --> 01:57:44,721
but we all live in northern California 
and when it came to like holidays and 

2912
01:57:44,721 --> 01:57:48,441
some different things,
I mean we'd call them and communicate 

2913
01:57:48,441 --> 01:57:48,441
with them a little bit here and there.
But you know,

2914
01:57:48,441 --> 01:57:49,830
he kind of just seemed like he didn't 
give a fuck about.

2915
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:52,620
Still in upstate New York.
I know he's here.

2916
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:53,940
He's in La.
Yeah.

2917
01:57:54,570 --> 01:57:59,570
Yeah.
So he was only in La and we were in 

2918
01:57:59,570 --> 01:57:59,570
Sacramento but um,
it wasn't,

2919
01:57:59,570 --> 01:57:59,570
you know,
not that far.

2920
01:57:59,570 --> 01:58:03,710
It's one hour flight or whatever.
But we'd communicate with them here and 

2921
01:58:03,710 --> 01:58:03,710
there and just,
you know,

2922
01:58:03,710 --> 01:58:06,150
even like on his birthday or something,
call them or whatever the case might be.

2923
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:11,210
Um,
and then he would come up to Sacramento 

2924
01:58:11,210 --> 01:58:11,640
or I'd come down here and we'd meet up 
with each other here or there,

2925
01:58:11,641 --> 01:58:16,641
but we just didn't really realize how 
severe the situation was in terms of 

2926
01:58:16,641 --> 01:58:18,090
just is like mental health,
you know,

2927
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:20,700
it's just like not a dude thing to do.
Like,

2928
01:58:20,701 --> 01:58:21,720
hey man,
how you doing?

2929
01:58:21,721 --> 01:58:25,080
And somebody isn't just like poor out 
there fucking feelings were like,

2930
01:58:25,110 --> 01:58:25,890
oh,
I'm doing good.

2931
01:58:25,891 --> 01:58:30,891
You know,
they just leave it at that and you kind 

2932
01:58:30,891 --> 01:58:30,891
of move onto the next thing.

2933
01:58:30,891 --> 01:58:31,050
I have people that are in my film that 
have relapsed,

2934
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:32,490
you know,
since the film.

2935
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:34,590
Um,
and I have people that,

2936
01:58:34,591 --> 01:58:35,890
I have a guy who,
uh,

2937
01:58:35,891 --> 01:58:40,891
I had to get a release for the film,
like somehow somebody slipped up and 

2938
01:58:40,891 --> 01:58:42,010
didn't,
didn't get released for the film and I'm

2939
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,450
just like,
this is like two days ago,

2940
01:58:43,451 --> 01:58:46,330
I have a guy who who relapsed and he's 
all fucked up.

2941
01:58:46,570 --> 01:58:47,830
We're trying to get a release of the 
film.

2942
01:58:47,831 --> 01:58:52,831
We can't even get in touch with them.
So I did send somebody to his house and 

2943
01:58:52,831 --> 01:58:55,840
then we found out that he's relapsed and
he's a mess and he needs treatment too.

2944
01:58:55,841 --> 01:58:57,940
So it's like this,
it's a dangerous,

2945
01:58:57,941 --> 01:58:59,880
powerful thing.
And,

2946
01:58:59,881 --> 01:59:03,940
and part of the whole program is helping
other people and I think it's beautiful.

2947
01:59:03,941 --> 01:59:07,150
It's like the thing now is like,
how do I help other people,

2948
01:59:07,151 --> 01:59:07,660
how do I help?

2949
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:12,880
The people will listen to this show and 
they will hit me up on facebook and 

2950
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:12,880
they'll say,
listen man,

2951
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:13,790
I'm an alcoholic.
I'm a drug addict,

2952
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:14,950
drug addict,
what do I do?

2953
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:18,190
And the beauty is I don't have to do it 
for them.

2954
01:59:18,191 --> 01:59:23,191
I can just lead them in the right 
direction and help guide them to 

2955
01:59:23,191 --> 01:59:26,581
treatment and be there for them.
The people that run these treatment 

2956
01:59:26,581 --> 01:59:26,581
centers,
muscle,

2957
01:59:26,581 --> 01:59:27,430
they must feel like they're like 
combating vampires or something.

2958
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:30,910
Everyone is just getting bitten and 
sick.

2959
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:32,770
It's,
it's incredible.

2960
01:59:32,771 --> 01:59:35,230
The second get sick is a good way of 
putting it.

2961
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:40,260
You know,
like when somebody has something like 

2962
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:42,151
that,
you kind of feel like they have cancer 

2963
01:59:42,151 --> 01:59:42,151
or something and you don't know how to 
help him.

2964
01:59:42,151 --> 01:59:42,490
I think I'm,
a lot of people just think,

2965
01:59:42,670 --> 01:59:43,480
oh,
I can help him.

2966
01:59:43,481 --> 01:59:45,280
Like hey,
if we go like work out together,

2967
01:59:45,281 --> 01:59:47,710
if we hang out together,
if we go eat together,

2968
01:59:47,711 --> 01:59:49,990
like that should be fun and like take 
his mind off it,

2969
01:59:49,991 --> 01:59:53,840
but it doesn't work that way as soon as 
you turn back in a way.

2970
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,330
I think also vampire.
Yeah.

2971
01:59:55,331 --> 01:59:56,860
I mean,
and looking at it people say,

2972
01:59:56,910 --> 01:59:59,170
oh it's not a news is your own fucking 
fault.

2973
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:01,360
Your own personal.
Take all that away.

2974
02:00:01,361 --> 02:00:02,230
Well,
what's going on?

2975
02:00:02,231 --> 02:00:05,710
Someone's got some shit in their veins 
and they need to keep pumping into their

2976
02:00:05,711 --> 02:00:07,480
body.
It's like sick.

2977
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:08,980
It is sick.
You know what?

2978
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:11,040
All those same people that say it's not 
a sickness.

2979
02:00:11,041 --> 02:00:14,350
And I like a lot of those people will 
fall into it too,

2980
02:00:14,470 --> 02:00:14,860
you know,
like,

2981
02:00:14,890 --> 02:00:16,900
so.
Well that's what's fucked up about it.

2982
02:00:16,901 --> 02:00:21,901
How many people fall into it?
I've had a lot of friends get hooked on 

2983
02:00:21,901 --> 02:00:21,970
pills.
Chris Lievens in my movie.

2984
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:22,760
Busy.
Yeah.

2985
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:27,870
Yeah.
He's had some issues and has had some 

2986
02:00:27,870 --> 02:00:27,870
issues recently.
I just spoke to him,

2987
02:00:27,870 --> 02:00:28,120
um,
a couple of days ago and he's,

2988
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:30,580
he's on a back on the suboxone and 
again,

2989
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,160
um,
and,

2990
02:00:32,161 --> 02:00:33,580
and it's hard to get off of that shit.

2991
02:00:33,580 --> 02:00:37,630
Like it's really hard to get off and 
it's like suboxone is a maintenance drug

2992
02:00:37,631 --> 02:00:40,630
to keep them going back from doing,
to do in the axes.

2993
02:00:40,870 --> 02:00:45,870
But it's just something that like he's 
going to have to battle and fight 

2994
02:00:45,870 --> 02:00:49,950
everyday to get off.
What are the numbers like how many 

2995
02:00:49,950 --> 02:00:49,950
people in this country are addicted to 
pain pills?

2996
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:53,210
I think it's like two point something 
million shuffled to shit.

2997
02:00:53,310 --> 02:00:58,310
Fuck yeah.
Well and then just how many people are 

2998
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:58,310
just on pills period.
I mean,

2999
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:58,380
I know some people,
uh,

3000
02:00:58,390 --> 02:00:59,180
some of the,
you know,

3001
02:00:59,290 --> 02:01:00,970
obviously some of the pharmaceutical 
drugs,

3002
02:01:00,971 --> 02:01:02,560
so the benefit one,
but you want a number,

3003
02:01:02,730 --> 02:01:07,730
that's a real number.
You want a number of million people are 

3004
02:01:07,730 --> 02:01:09,961
hooked on pain pills.
People walking around like zombies say 

3005
02:01:09,961 --> 02:01:10,840
you had an idea to help people.
Holy Shit,

3006
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:14,740
I'm just freaking out.
I can't believe that's real.

3007
02:01:14,741 --> 02:01:16,810
2 million people are hooked on that 
Shit.

3008
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:19,870
Yeah,
that's like a national epidemic.

3009
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:24,960
Absolutely.
That's almost one percent of the 

3010
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,170
population of the country.
Last year I think 300 million people.

3011
02:01:26,171 --> 02:01:28,330
I think that's,
that's A.

3012
02:01:28,331 --> 02:01:30,560
God damn it.
2 million fucking people.

3013
02:01:30,910 --> 02:01:35,470
Three people is one percent in 2012.
Like the Lazy Q,

3014
02:01:35,790 --> 02:01:39,650
One hundred and 54 million.
Two hundred $54 million

3015
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:43,320
prescriptions were written for Vicodin.
Fuck.

3016
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:46,070
So that,
that's enough to Medicaid.

3017
02:01:46,071 --> 02:01:51,071
Say that again.
Say that number $254 million 

3018
02:01:51,071 --> 02:01:53,390
prescriptions for Vicodin were written 
in like last year or the year before.

3019
02:01:53,630 --> 02:01:58,630
And that's enough drugs,
that's enough painkillers to medicate 

3020
02:01:58,630 --> 02:02:03,131
every male or every.
Every adult person in America for a 

3021
02:02:03,290 --> 02:02:04,610
month.
So yeah,

3022
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:05,900
250,
$4 million.

3023
02:02:06,950 --> 02:02:08,150
Here's another,
another step.

3024
02:02:08,151 --> 02:02:11,240
Four hundred and $54 million 
prescriptions were filled.

3025
02:02:11,241 --> 02:02:13,520
Is that the idea for,
for painkillers?

3026
02:02:13,540 --> 02:02:15,030
Yeah.
How does that even make sense?

3027
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:17,990
That's in a whole year and a whole year 
because people get several,

3028
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:21,320
so they get a bit windy pills or get a 
lot of times.

3029
02:02:21,321 --> 02:02:22,490
It's like once a month,
you know,

3030
02:02:22,491 --> 02:02:24,740
they a lot of times with stuff like 
that,

3031
02:02:24,741 --> 02:02:26,390
you want to get like 10 at a time though
too.

3032
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:27,930
Well,
here's another step for you.

3033
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:30,830
If you wanted to do something about it 
and you're a congressman,

3034
02:02:31,070 --> 02:02:31,400
right?

3035
02:02:31,670 --> 02:02:32,420
And you're like,
you know what?

3036
02:02:32,421 --> 02:02:37,421
Fuck it.
I'm going to do something about this 

3037
02:02:37,421 --> 02:02:37,730
epidemic.
And then there's $445,000

3038
02:02:38,150 --> 02:02:43,150
sitting on your table.
I can either take that money from 

3039
02:02:43,150 --> 02:02:44,930
lobbyists because on average that's how 
much money the lobbyists will take.

3040
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:50,380
On average,
there's a certain amount of number of 

3041
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:50,900
people in Congress and a certain amount 
of money that's spent.

3042
02:02:50,901 --> 02:02:53,480
So if you average it out,
it comes out to like over $400,000

3043
02:02:53,481 --> 02:02:56,930
per congressman that they use for their 
campaigns and everything else.

3044
02:02:57,230 --> 02:03:00,020
So you can either take that money and 
just say,

3045
02:03:00,021 --> 02:03:01,610
you know what,
everything's cool,

3046
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:06,970
you know,
or you can take that money and try to 

3047
02:03:06,970 --> 02:03:06,970
fight them and risk losing that money 
out of your campaign.

3048
02:03:06,970 --> 02:03:11,710
So all these special interests and all 
these different things that people talk 

3049
02:03:11,710 --> 02:03:14,561
about all the time.
A pharmaceuticals is one of the biggest 

3050
02:03:14,561 --> 02:03:16,070
ones to the one of the biggest 
contributors to these campaigns.

3051
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:19,220
So people don't really have a vested 
interest to stop it.

3052
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:21,710
They have no interest.
Right.

3053
02:03:21,711 --> 02:03:24,280
I mean that's an any of.
They weren't trying to fight it.

3054
02:03:24,281 --> 02:03:25,990
If they fought it with that little 
amount of money,

3055
02:03:25,991 --> 02:03:27,500
it wouldn't even fucking work there.
Well,

3056
02:03:27,501 --> 02:03:30,320
how,
what amount of money would be affective?

3057
02:03:30,321 --> 02:03:31,280
Yeah.
Billions.

3058
02:03:31,281 --> 02:03:34,390
Like it's so intense.
What's really fucked up is this.

3059
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,680
This shit didn't even exist 50 years 
ago.

3060
02:03:36,681 --> 02:03:38,480
Right.
That's what's really fucked up.

3061
02:03:38,550 --> 02:03:42,650
It didn't really exist 20 years ago or 
how nuts is that something.

3062
02:03:42,651 --> 02:03:45,510
So we'll do.
Twenty years ago they did have quail.

3063
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:48,530
Ooh,
because the big bill cosby drugged right

3064
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:51,920
thing.
But are they as addictive?

3065
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:55,330
They were a completely different thing.
From what I understand.

3066
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:58,580
And this is just a total new level of 
addictive properties,

3067
02:03:58,581 --> 02:03:58,920
right?
Yeah.

3068
02:03:58,921 --> 02:04:00,030
It's a.
So if you,

3069
02:04:00,050 --> 02:04:01,490
if you look at um,
okay,

3070
02:04:01,491 --> 02:04:05,270
so we have drugs like morphine,
right?

3071
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:08,090
Morphine and heroin are like really 
closely related.

3072
02:04:08,091 --> 02:04:09,410
You can make one out of the other,
right?

3073
02:04:09,710 --> 02:04:10,760
Uh,
but on the other side,

3074
02:04:10,761 --> 02:04:12,470
they,
they now make them synthetically.

3075
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:17,920
So this shit doesn't even require.
They just chemical upon chemical upon 

3076
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:20,780
chemical.
It doesn't require any sort of a base.

3077
02:04:20,810 --> 02:04:23,030
If you don't read,
you don't need opium to make it,

3078
02:04:23,031 --> 02:04:26,420
you need opium and morphine,
but you don't need it to make oxycotton.

3079
02:04:26,510 --> 02:04:31,510
So they figured out a way to make these 
things synthetically so that they can 

3080
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:31,510
just,
you know,

3081
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:33,530
I don't understand that well,
how does that work?

3082
02:04:33,531 --> 02:04:38,531
I don't understand it either.
Like where are they getting the raw 

3083
02:04:38,531 --> 02:04:38,531
properties that would make it and I was 
happy,

3084
02:04:38,531 --> 02:04:39,420
but I don't know what the fuck they make
it from.

3085
02:04:39,421 --> 02:04:42,030
But like you can't make something out of
nothing physically.

3086
02:04:42,690 --> 02:04:44,610
That's why I always understood.
I didn't understand.

3087
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:47,070
Like everyone said bullying,
Afghanistan produces,

3088
02:04:47,071 --> 02:04:49,530
you know,
90 whatever percent of the world's opium

3089
02:04:49,531 --> 02:04:52,050
and heroin.
But what about pills?

3090
02:04:52,490 --> 02:04:55,080
If it's synthetic opium or synthetic 
heroin,

3091
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:58,500
what are they getting it from 
Afghanistan?

3092
02:04:58,501 --> 02:05:03,501
Is that they've figured out ways special
with ways to make it out of other things

3093
02:05:04,201 --> 02:05:07,800
that are like normal basis and changes 
the chemical makeups of them somehow.

3094
02:05:08,130 --> 02:05:10,160
I don't know exactly what.
You're stupid for this conversation.

3095
02:05:11,210 --> 02:05:13,320
So opiates,
people goes,

3096
02:05:13,321 --> 02:05:14,550
oh yeah,
he's on opiates,

3097
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:16,710
but that's not really true.
Unless he's on morphine,

3098
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:20,930
they're on opioids which are synthetic 
kinda like steroids,

3099
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,090
steroids,
opioid.

3100
02:05:22,110 --> 02:05:25,410
See all of that boils.
Hemorrhoids.

3101
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:30,560
How strange band that we live in a world
where 200 million prescriptions for 

3102
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:35,690
super highly addictive pain pills to get
prescribed in a year and we're supposed 

3103
02:05:35,941 --> 02:05:40,941
to be like an educated country.
Think that like that's an epidemic for 

3104
02:05:40,941 --> 02:05:42,810
prescribing to the kids and we're giving
kids,

3105
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:44,820
you know,
adderall or given you the adderall,

3106
02:05:44,821 --> 02:05:45,300
Ritalin.

3107
02:05:45,570 --> 02:05:46,330
And that's like,
you know,

3108
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:48,990
5 million prescriptions written for that
for kids every year,

3109
02:05:48,991 --> 02:05:51,180
you know,
just keeps going up and up and up.

3110
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:55,410
It seems so easy to get shit too.
I had a mom,

3111
02:05:55,760 --> 02:06:00,760
I had to have a mom and my film and she 
has a daughter that has adhd and so she 

3112
02:06:01,951 --> 02:06:06,951
brings you to the psychiatrist or 
whatever and they prescribe her adhd 

3113
02:06:06,951 --> 02:06:06,951
pills,
you know,

3114
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:12,020
adderall.
And the mom starts taking it and then a 

3115
02:06:12,020 --> 02:06:13,410
mom convinces the daughter she doesn't 
have adhd and she shouldn't take it.

3116
02:06:13,650 --> 02:06:15,360
So then the mom starts taking the other 
kids.

3117
02:06:15,361 --> 02:06:20,361
There's three other kids.
She took all her kids to the doctor and 

3118
02:06:20,361 --> 02:06:23,271
got like four prescriptions every month 
and was taken like tons of adderall.

3119
02:06:23,781 --> 02:06:26,460
She would take like 10 a day.
I bet that bitch got a lot done.

3120
02:06:26,570 --> 02:06:27,930
Yeah.
Houses clean,

3121
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:32,760
2010 every American adult every four 
hours for one month.

3122
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:38,700
It says every prescription painkiller 
were prescribed to medicate every 

3123
02:06:38,700 --> 02:06:40,200
American adults for every four hours.
What do you mean?

3124
02:06:40,201 --> 02:06:41,670
What does that mean?
You can't see that line?

3125
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:43,260
Well,
why don't you make it so I can see it?

3126
02:06:46,190 --> 02:06:47,340
Here's sorry.
Oh,

3127
02:06:47,341 --> 02:06:48,060
it's like.
It's like,

3128
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:50,440
oh,
there's the.

3129
02:06:50,890 --> 02:06:52,290
There's the text of it.
Okay.

3130
02:06:52,291 --> 02:06:53,370
In 2000,
10 enough,

3131
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:58,400
prescription painkillers were prescribed
to medicate every American adult every 

3132
02:06:58,400 --> 02:06:59,250
four hours for a month.

3133
02:07:00,550 --> 02:07:03,280
I wasn't lying Christ.

3134
02:07:05,710 --> 02:07:10,710
So.
So it's like three pills a day or 

3135
02:07:10,710 --> 02:07:10,710
substance abusers.
That's 2010.

3136
02:07:10,710 --> 02:07:15,550
Now,
has it gotten better or worse in five 

3137
02:07:15,550 --> 02:07:15,550
years?
Well,

3138
02:07:15,550 --> 02:07:18,831
it either way.
You know that numbers when I talked 

3139
02:07:18,831 --> 02:07:21,641
about a purdue pharmaceuticals and 
oxycontin and how that invaded America 

3140
02:07:21,641 --> 02:07:21,641
and all that,
stuff like that.

3141
02:07:21,740 --> 02:07:23,540
If you look at it,
the government,

3142
02:07:23,541 --> 02:07:26,750
at some certain point I got fed up with 
it and I said,

3143
02:07:26,751 --> 02:07:28,700
listen,
people are dying,

3144
02:07:28,730 --> 02:07:33,730
right?
So it's cool that you guys are selling 

3145
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:33,730
all these drugs and everything.
We'll take your lobby money,

3146
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:36,520
but people are dying so you can't take 
this drug.

3147
02:07:36,550 --> 02:07:41,550
You got to make a way that you can't 
take it and crush it up anymore and 

3148
02:07:41,550 --> 02:07:43,480
inject it or snort it or do other things
with it recreationally.

3149
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:47,290
So now if you crush oxycotton,
it turns into a Gel.

3150
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:49,240
It turns into like a Bush.
So,

3151
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:54,600
uh,
what they did was after seeing what 

3152
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:58,081
happened,
did they figured out how you couldn't 

3153
02:07:58,081 --> 02:07:58,180
crush it and snort it anymore?
Once they did that,

3154
02:07:58,390 --> 02:08:00,010
the sales dropped 80 percent.

3155
02:08:02,020 --> 02:08:07,020
So what does that tell you?
It's 80 percent just shows you that 

3156
02:08:07,030 --> 02:08:12,030
anything is possible with money though.
How the fuck did they figure out a way 

3157
02:08:12,030 --> 02:08:12,030
that if you crush it up,
it turns into a gel.

3158
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:17,160
I don't know.
Someone talked them into doing that and 

3159
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:18,520
then they dropped 80 percent of their 
profits and they stuck with it.

3160
02:08:18,610 --> 02:08:21,600
Yeah,
they're probably fucking scramble.

3161
02:08:21,601 --> 02:08:24,180
There are studies to show that that Gel 
is less effective,

3162
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:29,200
but they,
they find they find other ways to the 

3163
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:29,200
pills.
But here's the problem.

3164
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:31,090
Here's the problem with a study,
right?

3165
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:36,390
So everybody wants to think that they 
read the studies and the studies are 

3166
02:08:36,390 --> 02:08:36,850
good and the studies are valid and you 
know,

3167
02:08:37,090 --> 02:08:42,090
what happens is you need to studies that
prove that you're a pill is more 

3168
02:08:42,090 --> 02:08:44,440
effective than a placebo.
Not effected,

3169
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:46,300
not more effective than anything that's 
on the market.

3170
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:49,450
Just more effective than a placebo to 
get your drug past.

3171
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:54,900
So it takes,
it costs a lot of money and a lot of 

3172
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:55,570
money through the FDA and a lot of 
testing and all these things,

3173
02:08:55,810 --> 02:08:59,050
but it's still not very hard to get a 
drug past.

3174
02:08:59,051 --> 02:09:02,770
They just passed one called [inaudible].
I said [inaudible] I hydro and it's like

3175
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:08,000
way more powerful than oxycontin.
So now there's another drug on the 

3176
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,540
market that's more powerful.
Who are these fucking monsters?

3177
02:09:10,570 --> 02:09:15,570
How do we get some of that shit?
Who are these monsters that are making 

3178
02:09:15,570 --> 02:09:19,201
this stuff?
Does anybody need something stronger 

3179
02:09:19,201 --> 02:09:20,710
than Oxycontin?
Some fucking rallying cry for pain pills

3180
02:09:20,740 --> 02:09:22,210
to talk.
You talk about like,

3181
02:09:22,220 --> 02:09:23,470
um,
medical marijuana.

3182
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:26,050
I talked to a senator about medical 
marijuana.

3183
02:09:26,230 --> 02:09:27,790
Medical marijuana is not killing 
anybody.

3184
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:28,660
And,
and I'm like,

3185
02:09:28,661 --> 02:09:29,650
exactly.
So,

3186
02:09:29,890 --> 02:09:32,390
so is that something that's a,
you know,

3187
02:09:32,690 --> 02:09:33,460
good or bad,
you know,

3188
02:09:33,470 --> 02:09:35,620
and we look at it and go like,
man,

3189
02:09:35,621 --> 02:09:39,040
like it's,
it's crazy what we could do with a plant

3190
02:09:39,820 --> 02:09:41,680
compared to what's happening with,
uh,

3191
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:43,930
you know,
what's happening with these pills.

3192
02:09:43,930 --> 02:09:46,450
I don't know anybody.
I know maybe one or two people that have

3193
02:09:46,451 --> 02:09:47,520
ruined their life,
you know,

3194
02:09:47,830 --> 02:09:49,780
with pot,
just because they're fucking lazy,

3195
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:52,570
but beyond that,
beyond the scope of that,

3196
02:09:52,571 --> 02:09:54,970
it seems to be very helpful for so many 
people.

3197
02:09:55,030 --> 02:09:56,830
Yeah.
My point of view has always been the,

3198
02:09:56,890 --> 02:10:00,010
if you pot ruins your life just because 
pot got there first.

3199
02:10:00,030 --> 02:10:05,030
Yeah.
Exact cheeseburgers or scratch tickets 

3200
02:10:05,030 --> 02:10:07,441
or the fucking job as witnesses.
Whoever gets to your commander and 

3201
02:10:07,441 --> 02:10:08,470
alcohol is the fucking worst.
Alcohol's the devil.

3202
02:10:08,471 --> 02:10:13,471
If you do any of them,
if you indulge in it or you know you 

3203
02:10:13,471 --> 02:10:16,360
don't have the gene for it or whatever 
it is and that's not the worst.

3204
02:10:16,590 --> 02:10:18,730
You just have a drink and then you don't
want to have a drink anymore.

3205
02:10:18,860 --> 02:10:20,980
Yeah.
I've never had the urge to drink.

3206
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:26,040
I like a drink every now and then,
but I've never had the urge is the same 

3207
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:26,710
way,
but I have friends who have it and I see

3208
02:10:26,711 --> 02:10:26,860
it.

3209
02:10:26,860 --> 02:10:29,800
It hits them and it's like a blanket 
goes over their eyelids.

3210
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:32,740
It's like they vanish so they're not 
there anymore.

3211
02:10:32,770 --> 02:10:37,770
And then some new persons and those are 
the people that you know are going to 

3212
02:10:37,770 --> 02:10:37,770
eventually have a problem if they don't 
already,

3213
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:39,140
if they don't already.
Yeah.

3214
02:10:39,141 --> 02:10:44,141
I definitely have known a lot of 
alcoholics and I know a lot of people 

3215
02:10:44,141 --> 02:10:48,011
like more,
more than half a dozen people whose 

3216
02:10:48,011 --> 02:10:50,030
lives have been wrecked by pills.
They just usually a back injury,

3217
02:10:50,130 --> 02:10:51,620
you know,
something along those lines.

3218
02:10:51,650 --> 02:10:53,720
And then they take something and the 
next thing you know,

3219
02:10:53,721 --> 02:10:55,730
they can't get off it.
It's very innocent.

3220
02:10:55,910 --> 02:10:57,210
You know,
it's not a,

3221
02:10:57,320 --> 02:11:01,520
it's not something that's.
But it turns somebody who can be a great

3222
02:11:01,521 --> 02:11:04,730
person and just somebody who lies,
cheats and steals.

3223
02:11:04,731 --> 02:11:05,780
And that's what's wrong with it.
You know,

3224
02:11:05,781 --> 02:11:07,070
the pills.
Yeah.

3225
02:11:07,310 --> 02:11:10,460
I always just used to think like,
well if I could just be on these forever

3226
02:11:10,670 --> 02:11:13,430
because I still have a lot of pain in my
back and my hips.

3227
02:11:13,430 --> 02:11:18,430
And like not in the hips and the state,
but like in the lower back because of 

3228
02:11:18,430 --> 02:11:21,790
the hips were messed up and because of 
my knees are messed up and solve a lot 

3229
02:11:21,790 --> 02:11:25,361
of pain.
But I know that what happens with the 

3230
02:11:25,361 --> 02:11:26,540
pain pills are it's diminishing returns.
Like after awhile I'll need,

3231
02:11:26,750 --> 02:11:27,950
you know,
for awhile it was,

3232
02:11:27,980 --> 02:11:31,510
I had to take 12 percocets a day.
What?

3233
02:11:31,730 --> 02:11:35,450
Just to maintain the pain,
the pain level that I,

3234
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:37,550
that I used to.
How many hours do you awake?

3235
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:38,510
Yeah,
like,

3236
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:39,090
well,
you know,

3237
02:11:39,091 --> 02:11:40,670
what's the other thing keeps you awake 
all day.

3238
02:11:41,090 --> 02:11:42,040
Percocets.
Keep you awake.

3239
02:11:42,910 --> 02:11:45,080
Some people that go to sleep and some 
people stay awake all day.

3240
02:11:45,081 --> 02:11:50,081
I would stay awake all day,
but after awhile I got up to take in 

3241
02:11:50,081 --> 02:11:50,081
like 20.
Right.

3242
02:11:50,081 --> 02:11:51,710
And I taught day,
so I thought that was bad.

3243
02:11:51,950 --> 02:11:53,840
So my car,
my car,

3244
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:55,670
my friend in the movie,
I say to him,

3245
02:11:55,730 --> 02:11:57,710
he's a,
he was in a wwe wrestler.

3246
02:11:57,740 --> 02:11:58,950
Luther reigns.
He's.

3247
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I said,
how many were you taking?

3248
02:12:00,001 --> 02:12:03,350
A day goes 90.
And he would say,

3249
02:12:03,351 --> 02:12:08,351
I'd get up in the morning.
My girlfriend would lay them out all 

3250
02:12:08,351 --> 02:12:08,351
out.
It'd be like,

3251
02:12:08,351 --> 02:12:08,351
you know,
10 Vicodin,

3252
02:12:08,351 --> 02:12:11,090
10 Salma.
He taking muscle relaxers,

3253
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:12,960
painkillers.
He said he,

3254
02:12:12,961 --> 02:12:16,610
I even take a Viagra and cialis every 
morning with my vitamins.

3255
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:18,950
Like when you take that voice,
it just to be ready,

3256
02:12:19,510 --> 02:12:21,440
you know,
is this because I'm such an asshole?

3257
02:12:21,570 --> 02:12:22,010
Well,
we're,

3258
02:12:22,740 --> 02:12:23,390
we're,
we're,

3259
02:12:23,450 --> 02:12:25,610
we're in like,
he's the coolest fucking guy ever.

3260
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:27,020
He's amazing,
amazing.

3261
02:12:28,040 --> 02:12:33,040
He's got some great stories.
But I'm saying hilled up with a giant 

3262
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:36,150
heart.
So it tells me that a vampire with a 

3263
02:12:36,150 --> 02:12:38,750
boner at the time he lived in Phoenix 
and then Phoenix,

3264
02:12:38,751 --> 02:12:40,480
they have cameras,
you know,

3265
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:41,690
on the,
uh,

3266
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,430
on the freeway.
And uh,

3267
02:12:43,431 --> 02:12:44,170
he was on,
you know,

3268
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:45,410
someone makes you go to sleep.

3269
02:12:45,410 --> 02:12:46,940
It's a muscle relaxer.
It makes it go to sleep.

3270
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:49,050
So he said he gets a ticket in the mail.
He's like,

3271
02:12:49,051 --> 02:12:51,270
what the fuck is this ticket?
I never got a ticket being asleep.

3272
02:12:51,590 --> 02:12:56,590
He opens up the ticket and there's a 
club plain as day it's fucking passed 

3273
02:12:56,590 --> 02:12:56,590
out.
Speed is driving.

3274
02:12:56,590 --> 02:12:57,840
And in his corvette going,
you know,

3275
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:02,140
95 and [inaudible] 65 asleep,
asleep.

3276
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:03,080
He got the ticket.
He's like,

3277
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:06,170
I wonder,
we get a ticket for being asleep.

3278
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:11,480
God,
I don't think it really is what's going 

3279
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:11,480
on with him now.
He had a massive,

3280
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:15,500
massive stroke.
He had a cardiac Arrhythmia,

3281
02:13:16,230 --> 02:13:17,840
um,
I don't know what you call that.

3282
02:13:18,220 --> 02:13:20,330
He had something wrong with his heart to
begin with,

3283
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:25,720
uh,
all the pills and sorta live in live in 

3284
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:25,720
the tough life because he did a lot of 
illegal drugs to,

3285
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:28,760
uh,
he had a stroke and drugs.

3286
02:13:29,030 --> 02:13:31,130
He didn't do what he did,
like coke and everything.

3287
02:13:31,990 --> 02:13:33,600
Hop of it.
Right.

3288
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:34,650
So,
um,

3289
02:13:34,770 --> 02:13:37,410
but what happens is like he,
he was getting them on the black market.

3290
02:13:37,411 --> 02:13:39,990
He said that he used to get a thousand 
at a time.

3291
02:13:40,930 --> 02:13:42,030
Big,
big bottles.

3292
02:13:42,610 --> 02:13:44,100
Yeah.
Thousand.

3293
02:13:44,670 --> 02:13:46,240
Oh my.
He told me he was selling,

3294
02:13:46,420 --> 02:13:47,710
selling,
selling.

3295
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:52,760
Uh,
he had a customer that was buying them 

3296
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:53,130
at $28,000,
like a week.

3297
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:55,770
So he,
he had to get massive,

3298
02:13:55,771 --> 02:13:57,480
massive amounts.
So he was dealing,

3299
02:13:57,481 --> 02:14:02,481
um,
and goddamn thousand dollars worth the 

3300
02:14:02,481 --> 02:14:02,760
pills and need a fucking forklift for 
selling them.

3301
02:14:02,770 --> 02:14:05,670
Two guys in the NFL,
you know them to the Phoenix cardinals.

3302
02:14:06,510 --> 02:14:07,900
That's insane.
You know,

3303
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:09,150
it wasn't a,
it wasn't a rush.

3304
02:14:09,151 --> 02:14:11,940
Limbo taken like 90 a day.
I was taking a lot.

3305
02:14:12,270 --> 02:14:13,260
Anyway.
So my friend,

3306
02:14:13,290 --> 02:14:14,670
uh,
luther reigns,

3307
02:14:14,671 --> 02:14:18,350
he ended up,
he had a massive stroke and uh,

3308
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:20,880
now he's actually somehow.

3309
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:26,120
So when,
when you have withdrawals from 

3310
02:14:26,120 --> 02:14:26,120
painkillers,
it feels like you're gonna die.

3311
02:14:26,120 --> 02:14:27,360
And so when he had the stroke,
they said,

3312
02:14:27,361 --> 02:14:32,361
get his mother here,
he's not going to make it through this 

3313
02:14:32,361 --> 02:14:34,971
and we can't pump them full of full of 
enough drugs for him to get through 

3314
02:14:34,971 --> 02:14:35,220
this.
He's gonna.

3315
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:40,080
He's probably not going to make it 
somehow miraculously the part of the,

3316
02:14:40,081 --> 02:14:41,820
uh,
the brain that is,

3317
02:14:41,930 --> 02:14:45,390
he is like 30 percent of his brain got 
killed during the stroke.

3318
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:50,780
Part of the brain that got killed was 
the part that was responsible for 

3319
02:14:50,780 --> 02:14:53,880
feeling withdrawals.
So somehow he fucking dodged a bullet.

3320
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:57,810
We call him the bulletproof bad boy.
Somehow he got the bullet,

3321
02:14:58,260 --> 02:15:00,290
he's alive.
He has no more hangovers.

3322
02:15:00,291 --> 02:15:05,291
He's completely sober and he goes around
and talks to kids and churches and 

3323
02:15:05,291 --> 02:15:06,780
things like that.
So he's doing great work,

3324
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:07,100
you know.

3325
02:15:07,180 --> 02:15:09,870
So he lost 30 percent of his brain.
Yeah.

3326
02:15:09,871 --> 02:15:12,240
But somehow he's still a cognitive.
He's still,

3327
02:15:12,241 --> 02:15:12,990
you know,
he's still there.

3328
02:15:13,470 --> 02:15:16,440
He's jacked.
He's on steroids.

3329
02:15:16,470 --> 02:15:18,500
Yeah.
Oh,

3330
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:22,800
good Christ maybe might be something.
Yeah.

3331
02:15:22,890 --> 02:15:26,130
So he's off the pain pills on steroids 
and helping our kids.

3332
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:26,790
Yeah,
there you go.

3333
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:29,190
What the fuck?
Kind of a world we live in.

3334
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:31,160
I love that.
One day we were eating with them,

3335
02:15:31,250 --> 02:15:36,250
uh,
that we're grabbing a burger or 

3336
02:15:36,250 --> 02:15:36,250
something and he's,
he's got this fanny pack on.

3337
02:15:36,250 --> 02:15:38,880
He's like pulling stuff out.
He's trying to find his money,

3338
02:15:38,910 --> 02:15:39,610
you know,
he's like,

3339
02:15:39,611 --> 02:15:40,830
oh,
I'll pay for it bro.

3340
02:15:41,610 --> 02:15:44,250
And he's like moving in slow motion.
He's fucking drooling.

3341
02:15:44,251 --> 02:15:45,540
I'm like,
this guy is amazing.

3342
02:15:45,541 --> 02:15:48,990
What is going on with this guy?
He's putting all these different bottles

3343
02:15:48,991 --> 02:15:53,991
of pills on the table.
He's got like Viagara and a bunch of 

3344
02:15:54,001 --> 02:15:56,220
other shit and carries the bottom with 
them.

3345
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:58,390
Yeah.
And then he put like his fanny pack yet.

3346
02:15:58,500 --> 02:16:03,500
Well there's Bob tools,
the many bottles and then he puts down 

3347
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:06,861
like a little bag,
like a clear bag of something and he's 

3348
02:16:06,861 --> 02:16:09,741
like,
he looks at it and he grabs money clip 

3349
02:16:09,741 --> 02:16:10,140
and he puts his money on the table and 
it looks at the clear baggies like,

3350
02:16:10,141 --> 02:16:11,830
whoops.
And he puts that back,

3351
02:16:11,910 --> 02:16:14,010
whatever the fuck that was,
that was like,

3352
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:15,970
that wasn't okay for him to put on the 
table.

3353
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:19,020
Everything else was fine.
For some reason.

3354
02:16:19,430 --> 02:16:20,400
He like,
oops.

3355
02:16:22,140 --> 02:16:24,920
Big Old stack of cash.
That's so crazy.

3356
02:16:24,921 --> 02:16:25,470
Oh yeah.
He's,

3357
02:16:25,530 --> 02:16:26,910
Oh my God.
I was like,

3358
02:16:26,911 --> 02:16:31,911
dude,
what if you get like your pills mixed 

3359
02:16:31,911 --> 02:16:33,591
up,
like you're just running a ton of 

3360
02:16:33,591 --> 02:16:34,951
fucking Viagra and shit.
Like when maybe when he was passed out 

3361
02:16:35,441 --> 02:16:37,210
in the car and maybe he was driving with
his Dick.

3362
02:16:37,270 --> 02:16:38,830
Yeah,
maybe just amazing bar.

3363
02:16:38,850 --> 02:16:41,560
There was no blood in his brain.
It's amazing because he was,

3364
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:44,140
he was dating a porn star for a long 
time.

3365
02:16:44,141 --> 02:16:46,930
And so now he's like a born stars here.
Fucking movie.

3366
02:16:46,931 --> 02:16:48,340
Premiere was amazing.
Yeah.

3367
02:16:48,450 --> 02:16:49,180
Yeah.
Bigger,

3368
02:16:49,181 --> 02:16:49,710
stronger,
faster.

3369
02:16:49,711 --> 02:16:54,711
You brought two porn stars.
Two chicks making out right behind my 

3370
02:16:54,711 --> 02:16:57,301
parents.
I was like the weirdest thing I've ever 

3371
02:16:57,301 --> 02:16:57,301
seen in my life.
What a good guy.

3372
02:16:57,301 --> 02:16:57,910
He's awesome.
He's a lot of fun.

3373
02:16:58,050 --> 02:17:02,050
So now that he's a born again Christian,
he'll be like telling me,

3374
02:17:02,051 --> 02:17:03,070
look,
look bro,

3375
02:17:03,250 --> 02:17:05,320
now that you're sober,
now you need God.

3376
02:17:05,321 --> 02:17:10,321
And He'd be like,
look at this chick's tits that just 

3377
02:17:10,321 --> 02:17:10,321
texted me.
It's like such a contract.

3378
02:17:10,321 --> 02:17:11,710
Walking,
walking contradiction.

3379
02:17:11,711 --> 02:17:16,711
He's hilarious now.
So what if anything can be done about 

3380
02:17:17,261 --> 02:17:20,540
this crazy prescription drug crisis?
Because it seems like when you,

3381
02:17:20,610 --> 02:17:23,410
when you're talking about millions of 
people that were on,

3382
02:17:23,411 --> 02:17:26,230
it was the number 8 million people abuse
it every year.

3383
02:17:26,740 --> 02:17:28,510
8 million people.
What is that?

3384
02:17:28,511 --> 02:17:31,150
Is that like three percent of the 
population in the country?

3385
02:17:31,151 --> 02:17:33,700
Somewhere around there was pretty big.
We listen,

3386
02:17:33,701 --> 02:17:35,170
we ran a million people,
right?

3387
02:17:35,740 --> 02:17:38,230
So nine would be three percent,
right?

3388
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:40,930
Jesus Christ,
they will point seven,

3389
02:17:40,931 --> 02:17:43,800
$6 million in 2010.
So what is it?

3390
02:17:44,010 --> 02:17:49,010
Lot.
I wonder what percentage of people are 

3391
02:17:49,010 --> 02:17:50,921
adults?
It might literally be three percent of 

3392
02:17:50,921 --> 02:17:52,930
the population of the whole country is 
fucked up on prescription pain pills.

3393
02:17:52,990 --> 02:17:53,860
Well,
here's the deal too.

3394
02:17:53,861 --> 02:17:58,861
Like we represent.
We only represent five percent of the 

3395
02:17:58,861 --> 02:18:01,831
entire world's population.
We consume 75 to 85 percent of the 

3396
02:18:01,831 --> 02:18:06,211
world's prescription drugs.
That's a lot of drugs because we're 

3397
02:18:06,211 --> 02:18:07,740
America,
we do it big America.

3398
02:18:08,060 --> 02:18:09,510
Yeah.
So if you want to see like what,

3399
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:11,880
what can be done about it?
Um,

3400
02:18:11,950 --> 02:18:16,950
first of all,
like just ban advertising on tv for 

3401
02:18:16,950 --> 02:18:20,701
drugs because that just creates an 
environment where people go into the 

3402
02:18:20,701 --> 02:18:22,060
doctor and tell them what they have a 
doctor as a fucking doctor,

3403
02:18:22,090 --> 02:18:24,070
a doctor went to school,
all you did,

3404
02:18:24,130 --> 02:18:25,990
all you did was watch a commercial,
you know,

3405
02:18:26,290 --> 02:18:26,920
that's advertised.

3406
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:30,430
Do you have toenail fungus or you know,
all these stupid things.

3407
02:18:30,730 --> 02:18:34,240
So that creates a drug culture and idea 
that there's a pill for everything.

3408
02:18:34,530 --> 02:18:37,660
I think that that idea is an idea that 
needs it to go away.

3409
02:18:37,990 --> 02:18:39,010
You know,
there's not,

3410
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:42,010
there is a pill for everything,
but let's not think that way.

3411
02:18:42,070 --> 02:18:43,750
Let's say you tired.
Are you sad?

3412
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:46,120
Yeah,
let's talk about me.

3413
02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:48,190
Well,
and that's one thing,

3414
02:18:48,191 --> 02:18:53,191
but I think also just like education is 
the most important thing that we can 

3415
02:18:53,191 --> 02:18:54,040
have for anything.
Whether it's steroids,

3416
02:18:54,041 --> 02:18:57,070
whether it's prescription drugs,
but you say that you say that,

3417
02:18:57,071 --> 02:18:58,510
but yeah,
you were educated.

3418
02:18:58,600 --> 02:18:59,720
You,
you knew the,

3419
02:18:59,790 --> 02:19:02,170
all the pitfalls.
You had a brother who died of it.

3420
02:19:02,380 --> 02:19:07,380
You had been hooked on it yourself,
you've been doing a documentary about 

3421
02:19:07,380 --> 02:19:11,460
all the,
all the different components of 

3422
02:19:11,460 --> 02:19:11,980
addiction of,
of selling these pills,

3423
02:19:11,981 --> 02:19:13,930
and yet you still got sucked into the 
web.

3424
02:19:14,050 --> 02:19:14,920
Yeah,
exactly.

3425
02:19:14,921 --> 02:19:17,310
That's how powerful it is.
So it's so crazy because you're,

3426
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:22,320
you,
but you are about as educated about it 

3427
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:22,810
as a person can be.
I think now I am.

3428
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:25,000
But back then when you were making the 
documentary,

3429
02:19:25,001 --> 02:19:26,540
don't you think you are way more 
educated than.

3430
02:19:27,390 --> 02:19:28,250
I was way more.

3431
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:31,190
I'm educated.
I was already already susceptible to it.

3432
02:19:32,090 --> 02:19:33,830
I was already.
I had already been in,

3433
02:19:33,890 --> 02:19:35,200
you know what I mean?
So that,

3434
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:36,800
that's a tough thing.
It's like if you can get,

3435
02:19:36,980 --> 02:19:38,960
get somebody before,
uh,

3436
02:19:38,961 --> 02:19:42,500
before they ever experienced it,
that's definitely a warning signs.

3437
02:19:42,501 --> 02:19:44,840
Maybe before you get to that point of 
like reaching for a pill.

3438
02:19:45,530 --> 02:19:47,080
We mean other warning sounds like,
like,

3439
02:19:47,130 --> 02:19:52,130
like something that happens before you 
actually start to take pills or do 

3440
02:19:52,130 --> 02:19:52,130
drugs.
You know what I mean?

3441
02:19:52,130 --> 02:19:52,130
Like,
yeah,

3442
02:19:52,150 --> 02:19:55,730
was always sorta gateways,
drinking and other things that make it.

3443
02:19:56,360 --> 02:19:58,700
Mark.
Was it like for you to have two brothers

3444
02:19:58,701 --> 02:20:02,510
that have these polls but you don't?
My family is fucked up,

3445
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:05,180
but you know,
I mean,

3446
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:07,660
you obviously like steroids,
but I love them.

3447
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:12,880
They're great,
but you don't have like the self 

3448
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:14,870
destructive thing going on.
Like you seem like a real generous guy.

3449
02:20:15,270 --> 02:20:20,270
You are a real generous guy.
Just the fact that you have this free 

3450
02:20:20,270 --> 02:20:20,520
gym and these free seminars and I saw in
the,

3451
02:20:20,521 --> 02:20:24,470
in the documentary that you really love 
working with kids and helping them out.

3452
02:20:24,710 --> 02:20:26,600
Like what is it?
Yeah.

3453
02:20:26,601 --> 02:20:29,270
Um,
I think I'm seeing my older brother,

3454
02:20:29,350 --> 02:20:30,860
I'm like,
um,

3455
02:20:31,580 --> 02:20:36,580
he just like his life was uh,
his life was really hard and he had to 

3456
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:42,640
like evade stuff and lie and like go 
through all these crazy things all the 

3457
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:47,201
time because pills because of the pills 
and then it also put a lot of heartache 

3458
02:20:47,201 --> 02:20:51,910
and stuff on a lot of other people.
So it sort of made me go the other 

3459
02:20:51,910 --> 02:20:51,910
direction.
You know,

3460
02:20:51,910 --> 02:20:55,811
like sometimes people have a parent 
that's an alcoholic or apparent that 

3461
02:20:55,811 --> 02:20:59,660
abuses them and it makes that person go 
the complete opposite way and then other

3462
02:20:59,661 --> 02:21:04,661
times you have someone who has a parent 
that's an alcoholic and they end up 

3463
02:21:04,661 --> 02:21:04,661
becoming the same thing.

3464
02:21:04,661 --> 02:21:06,860
I think for me it just made me steer 
clear of that.

3465
02:21:06,861 --> 02:21:10,250
I just remember like seeing my brother,
like hide alcohol,

3466
02:21:10,251 --> 02:21:15,251
like in,
in bushes and shit like that from my 

3467
02:21:15,251 --> 02:21:17,501
parents and lie to my parents and my 
parents are are as bad as awesome a 

3468
02:21:17,521 --> 02:21:20,060
parents as you can have.
So that was always just like,

3469
02:21:20,061 --> 02:21:25,061
man,
it just seems like a lot of extra work 

3470
02:21:25,061 --> 02:21:27,191
to go through.
Even if you told them that you were 

3471
02:21:27,191 --> 02:21:27,191
having a drink,
they probably wouldn't care.

3472
02:21:27,191 --> 02:21:27,350
Not like they would be like,
hey,

3473
02:21:27,351 --> 02:21:32,351
go for it man.
They're not going to be like your buddy 

3474
02:21:32,351 --> 02:21:34,331
and have a drink with you.
But at the same time I don't think our 

3475
02:21:34,331 --> 02:21:37,181
parents would really care.
Especially if they were like in the 

3476
02:21:37,181 --> 02:21:37,181
house,
they'd probably be like,

3477
02:21:37,181 --> 02:21:41,260
fuck it man.
I'd rather have you do an it hearsay if 

3478
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:41,260
you're not.

3479
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:41,260
No,
you're not driving,

3480
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:42,170
causing a lot of other problems,
so I just saw like a lot of,

3481
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:46,940
a lot of baggage that came with all that
shit and you didn't see that.

3482
02:21:47,030 --> 02:21:49,910
I saw it as I completely saw,
like I said,

3483
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:55,480
getting the hip to hip replacement thing
and getting hooked on pills in a way 

3484
02:21:55,480 --> 02:22:00,080
that seemed to me to be a organic,
you know,

3485
02:22:00,110 --> 02:22:05,110
it wasn't like uh,
like my brother started taking pills 

3486
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:05,110
because he got hurt in wrestling and 
then he.

3487
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:06,200
But did he really,
you know,

3488
02:22:06,201 --> 02:22:11,201
it's like,
I don't know if he ever got a 

3489
02:22:11,201 --> 02:22:12,191
prescription for it.
They were just passed around there are 

3490
02:22:12,191 --> 02:22:12,890
passed around so much and in wrestling 
that it was such a huge problem.

3491
02:22:13,250 --> 02:22:15,230
So for me I was like,
well I'm taking them legitimately.

3492
02:22:15,231 --> 02:22:18,680
And then it just was a snowball effect 
because the doctor tells you it's okay.

3493
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:23,800
It was a real snowball effect from the 
squat when you fucked up your ankle and 

3494
02:22:24,171 --> 02:22:29,171
your knee when you drop that weight.
I'd take a little bit of stuff just 

3495
02:22:29,171 --> 02:22:33,531
because it was just unreasonable not to 
like I just physically could not get up 

3496
02:22:33,531 --> 02:22:34,410
off the couch.
You just in agony.

3497
02:22:34,440 --> 02:22:39,440
And then uh,
just talked to one of my buddies at the 

3498
02:22:39,440 --> 02:22:39,440
gym.
I'm like,

3499
02:22:39,440 --> 02:22:39,440
dude,
like a,

3500
02:22:39,440 --> 02:22:41,610
I was like a need some stuff so I can 
fucking move around.

3501
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:43,500
So you just getting it from the gym?
I'm gonna yeah,

3502
02:22:43,501 --> 02:22:45,420
I'm in a lot of that.
That's where everything comes from.

3503
02:22:45,710 --> 02:22:50,710
That's so crazy.
You guys don't ever go to doctors say 

3504
02:22:50,710 --> 02:22:50,710
like when I,
when I talk about the hip surgery,

3505
02:22:50,710 --> 02:22:55,671
I mean it felt like my,
my right side that they botched for two 

3506
02:22:55,671 --> 02:22:56,610
years.
It felt like it was on fire and so,

3507
02:22:56,611 --> 02:23:00,060
I mean if you're a buyer,
you got to put that out.

3508
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:00,810
Right?
So that's.

3509
02:23:00,930 --> 02:23:03,090
And then by the time you ready to get 
off of it,

3510
02:23:03,091 --> 02:23:06,000
you're just so addicted.
I also told my friend though too,

3511
02:23:06,001 --> 02:23:06,630
I was like,
dude,

3512
02:23:06,631 --> 02:23:08,910
like I'm going to come back to you for 
more.

3513
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:10,440
Don't get me.
Don't fucking.

3514
02:23:10,470 --> 02:23:13,530
Don't give me any more.
So give me like an amount that you think

3515
02:23:13,531 --> 02:23:17,370
is like reasonable cause my friend.
What did you take a.

3516
02:23:17,371 --> 02:23:22,371
I don't even know.
I don't even remember exactly what it 

3517
02:23:22,371 --> 02:23:22,371
was.
Whatever it was.

3518
02:23:22,371 --> 02:23:23,600
It worked pretty good though.
Just don't know.

3519
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:26,250
Take two or how much you tell a 
whatever.

3520
02:23:26,300 --> 02:23:26,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

3521
02:23:26,701 --> 02:23:28,770
This takes some for a few.
Oh my God.

3522
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:29,610
Um,
I also,

3523
02:23:29,611 --> 02:23:34,611
uh,
would also steered me clear of a lot of 

3524
02:23:34,611 --> 02:23:36,831
stuff,
at least as I got in a little bit older 

3525
02:23:36,831 --> 02:23:36,831
is I met my wife,
like,

3526
02:23:36,831 --> 02:23:40,780
you know,
we've been married for almost 15 years 

3527
02:23:40,780 --> 02:23:41,610
now and been together for about 17 years
and I have children.

3528
02:23:41,610 --> 02:23:45,120
I got a lot of responsibility.
So like even if I want to get fucked up,

3529
02:23:45,121 --> 02:23:47,340
like I don't have time to like go do it 
really.

3530
02:23:47,490 --> 02:23:49,170
Right.
And you've got a lot of obligations.

3531
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:52,740
Your brother didn't have any kids now 
married.

3532
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:54,330
He didn't listen.
You don't have any kids?

3533
02:23:54,331 --> 02:23:59,331
Not all kids wonder if that's it.
Whenever it's the responsibility of the 

3534
02:23:59,331 --> 02:24:00,390
children just keeps you just having 
somebody,

3535
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:03,240
somebody else in my life that cares 
about me,

3536
02:24:03,241 --> 02:24:05,580
somebody else sets a supportive and you 
know,

3537
02:24:05,581 --> 02:24:08,340
she's uh,
as much as part of the company's success

3538
02:24:08,341 --> 02:24:11,340
as I am.
So all that definitely plays into it.

3539
02:24:11,730 --> 02:24:16,730
That's such a scary number of the eight 
point 7 million people that are abusing 

3540
02:24:16,831 --> 02:24:20,340
it and that been 2010 and not knowing 
what it is in 2015.

3541
02:24:20,730 --> 02:24:23,940
That's terrifying to me.
That's the idea that we could be in that

3542
02:24:23,941 --> 02:24:28,941
state and it's sort of like something 
that flies under the radar for the most 

3543
02:24:28,941 --> 02:24:32,121
part unless you know somebody and then 
you think of that person is an isolated 

3544
02:24:32,121 --> 02:24:33,780
incident here you think of that person's
crazy or that person's doing it.

3545
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:36,290
Then like you said,
doing it to themselves and you know,

3546
02:24:36,530 --> 02:24:40,170
like there is definitely personal 
responsibility in all of this.

3547
02:24:40,171 --> 02:24:42,090
Whether whatever it is.
But um,

3548
02:24:42,810 --> 02:24:47,810
but at a certain point when things are 
so addictive that people don't really 

3549
02:24:47,810 --> 02:24:51,800
know about it or the doctors are just 
handing them out like crazy for a while.

3550
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:54,000
A couple years ago,
and they shut these all down.

3551
02:24:54,001 --> 02:24:55,520
There were pill mills,
so you just,

3552
02:24:55,680 --> 02:25:00,680
they call them pill mills and people 
would come from West Virginia drive all 

3553
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:01,410
the way down to Florida just to get 
pills,

3554
02:25:01,411 --> 02:25:02,840
you know.
So am I,

3555
02:25:02,910 --> 02:25:04,800
my friend that we were talking about 
before luther,

3556
02:25:04,801 --> 02:25:09,801
he just said he would,
he'd have seven prescriptions and he's 

3557
02:25:09,801 --> 02:25:12,711
like,
my whole day would be driving around to 

3558
02:25:12,711 --> 02:25:14,341
different,
different pharmacies picking up 

3559
02:25:14,341 --> 02:25:15,600
different prescriptions.
Now they have this drug database that if

3560
02:25:15,601 --> 02:25:20,601
you get a prescription from walgreens,
you can't go to costco and get that 

3561
02:25:20,601 --> 02:25:21,810
prescription however nobody really uses 
it.

3562
02:25:21,930 --> 02:25:24,070
So we have to get.
That's another way to get.

3563
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:25,270
Nobody uses it.
Yeah.

3564
02:25:25,271 --> 02:25:26,830
Like the,
they have a plus,

3565
02:25:26,860 --> 02:25:31,860
you know,
the dea regulates how many of these 

3566
02:25:31,860 --> 02:25:32,500
drugs are made and there's way more 
drugs made than are actually needed.

3567
02:25:32,501 --> 02:25:34,720
So a lot of those fall off the truck and
you know,

3568
02:25:34,721 --> 02:25:37,520
different things happen where they 
retained.

3569
02:25:37,590 --> 02:25:38,270
Yeah,
yeah,

3570
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:42,460
yeah.
It's built into the system is a massive,

3571
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:47,520
massive,
massive money making system and 

3572
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:50,080
everybody's on the take.
What the fuck.

3573
02:25:50,530 --> 02:25:53,770
A lot of money be made and it's killing 
people like vampires.

3574
02:25:53,830 --> 02:25:55,390
Yeah.
But we have a war on drugs.

3575
02:25:55,420 --> 02:25:59,710
Are there really vampires vampire to me,
as I say in the book and the film.

3576
02:25:59,711 --> 02:26:03,220
Is there really a war on drugs was a 
warrant.

3577
02:26:03,221 --> 02:26:04,990
Some drugs.
That's what there's always been,

3578
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:05,890
right?
Yeah.

3579
02:26:05,930 --> 02:26:08,110
While,
while we had a Nancy Reagan,

3580
02:26:08,470 --> 02:26:11,020
you know,
up there saying just say no.

3581
02:26:11,260 --> 02:26:15,130
Her husband's a lifting the bands on big
business that allowed the pharmaceutical

3582
02:26:15,131 --> 02:26:16,300
companies that grow so big.

3583
02:26:17,860 --> 02:26:20,680
Wow.
So this documentary then,

3584
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:25,700
the newest one,
what takes place in it that you found 

3585
02:26:25,700 --> 02:26:26,830
was shocking?
Like what?

3586
02:26:26,900 --> 02:26:30,520
What was going through this journey of 
putting together this documentary?

3587
02:26:30,700 --> 02:26:33,220
Was there anything that shocked you?
Yeah,

3588
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:34,900
a lot of the numbers.
But also,

3589
02:26:34,901 --> 02:26:36,310
um,
I interviewed this woman,

3590
02:26:36,311 --> 02:26:41,170
Gwen Olson went Olsen used to be a 
pharmaceutical sales rep that uh,

3591
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:45,830
quit when her daughter killed herself on
psych meds and um,

3592
02:26:46,210 --> 02:26:51,210
it's her stories just insane.
And just meeting somebody who actually 

3593
02:26:51,210 --> 02:26:55,890
worked through the system to to know 
that the people in the pharmaceutical 

3594
02:26:56,261 --> 02:27:01,261
companies get pumped up when they have a
new drug coming out that can actually 

3595
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:04,660
fix the side effects of another drug 
they already have on the market.

3596
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:07,450
And they're so excited because I know 
how much money they're gonna make off of

3597
02:27:07,451 --> 02:27:09,040
this.
It's just like sickening.

3598
02:27:09,041 --> 02:27:12,730
The whole thing is,
is disgusting and sickening and it's not

3599
02:27:12,731 --> 02:27:13,390
about health.

3600
02:27:13,510 --> 02:27:15,640
And that's what I really learned.
Worry is terrifying.

3601
02:27:16,210 --> 02:27:20,950
It was stopped.
Has it's such a machine that's making so

3602
02:27:20,951 --> 02:27:25,951
many billions of dollars.
How do you stop it and how do you level 

3603
02:27:25,951 --> 02:27:25,951
it out?
You know,

3604
02:27:25,951 --> 02:27:28,210
I think people that stopped taking money
from pharmaceutical companies,

3605
02:27:28,211 --> 02:27:29,590
that's a big thing.
You know,

3606
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:31,900
they have Donald Trump running and half 
the people are like,

3607
02:27:31,901 --> 02:27:33,010
Oh God,
Donald Trump.

3608
02:27:33,011 --> 02:27:38,011
But you know,
that's something that's not going to 

3609
02:27:38,011 --> 02:27:38,011
play into his decision making.
You know?

3610
02:27:38,011 --> 02:27:40,510
So if people like that,
I'm not saying him specifically,

3611
02:27:40,511 --> 02:27:42,250
but people like that to say,
you know what?

3612
02:27:42,280 --> 02:27:44,620
I'm not going to take their money.
I don't care what they say.

3613
02:27:44,621 --> 02:27:45,670
I'm not going to take,
you know,

3614
02:27:45,671 --> 02:27:48,530
it's the same thing with oil or any of 
these other problems like we,

3615
02:27:49,150 --> 02:27:52,090
the way we fix problems is not to bribe 
congressmen,

3616
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:57,480
you know,
I think that that's a huge thing and a 

3617
02:27:57,480 --> 02:27:59,510
huge thing is for regular average 
everyday citizens to say no to a,

3618
02:27:59,530 --> 02:28:01,630
to what's going on and stop and,
you know,

3619
02:28:01,631 --> 02:28:06,631
write to their congressman and make us 
think if all this stuff like people 

3620
02:28:06,631 --> 02:28:07,670
wanted medical marijuana,
medical marijuana,

3621
02:28:07,671 --> 02:28:11,710
it didn't come about because some 
congressmen said,

3622
02:28:11,711 --> 02:28:12,490
you know what,
I'm going to make.

3623
02:28:12,490 --> 02:28:14,770
This took a long time.
It took a long time.

3624
02:28:14,771 --> 02:28:19,300
It took a massive movement of a massive 
amount of people to say we want this.

3625
02:28:19,750 --> 02:28:20,810
And uh,
you know,

3626
02:28:20,830 --> 02:28:22,550
if you at a food,
for example,

3627
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:24,770
a,
everything's sort of going organic,

3628
02:28:24,771 --> 02:28:29,771
it's easier to find.
As hard as it is sometimes to find good 

3629
02:28:29,771 --> 02:28:32,891
food.
It's also a lot easier than it used to 

3630
02:28:32,891 --> 02:28:32,891
be.
So that's like Costco.

3631
02:28:32,891 --> 02:28:35,540
Costco is like all going organic now 
because people want it.

3632
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:37,200
So if people want,
you know,

3633
02:28:37,250 --> 02:28:42,250
a drug free society,
a society where their kids aren't dying 

3634
02:28:42,250 --> 02:28:44,300
and killing each other over drugs,
a society where people can live in peace

3635
02:28:44,301 --> 02:28:47,540
and harmony and not have their families 
ruined by these problems,

3636
02:28:47,541 --> 02:28:49,970
they can,
they can basically start that front,

3637
02:28:50,030 --> 02:28:55,030
you know,
just like they did with all these other 

3638
02:28:55,030 --> 02:28:55,030
things.
That's a groundswell,

3639
02:28:55,030 --> 02:28:55,430
you know,
it's like something that has to start.

3640
02:28:56,390 --> 02:29:01,390
It just,
I just don't know how you would ever 

3641
02:29:01,390 --> 02:29:03,311
stopped that amount of money.
It seems like the amount of money is so 

3642
02:29:03,311 --> 02:29:05,750
fucking terrifying and that these 
companies can just live with themselves.

3643
02:29:06,170 --> 02:29:07,390
It's,
it's so bizarre.

3644
02:29:07,440 --> 02:29:12,440
They can justify the production of these
fucking pills when they know that 9 

3645
02:29:12,440 --> 02:29:16,490
million people or whatever the number is
or abusing them just in this country 

3646
02:29:16,490 --> 02:29:18,950
with a massive amount of the drugs on 
the market and pharmaceuticals,

3647
02:29:18,951 --> 02:29:20,880
you know,
they don't even work know they,

3648
02:29:21,070 --> 02:29:22,150
they had been proven.
They,

3649
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:24,620
they're not proven effective.
The psych meds that we put,

3650
02:29:24,621 --> 02:29:26,780
we put our kids on were never tested on 
kids.

3651
02:29:27,260 --> 02:29:30,470
So if it's not tested on a kid,
don't give it to my kid.

3652
02:29:30,920 --> 02:29:32,990
That's what people need to start saying,
but people say,

3653
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:34,970
you know what,
it's easier for.

3654
02:29:35,060 --> 02:29:38,150
I put my kid on.
Everybody wants to make the exception.

3655
02:29:38,150 --> 02:29:39,320
Every parent I talk to says,
yeah,

3656
02:29:39,321 --> 02:29:44,321
yeah,
but my kids different [inaudible] I put 

3657
02:29:44,321 --> 02:29:44,930
them on adderall and now he's fine 
rather than to search out all the other,

3658
02:29:44,950 --> 02:29:45,980
you know,
all the other options.

3659
02:29:45,981 --> 02:29:50,981
So then people want to try to solve 
stuff with money or with or with a pill 

3660
02:29:50,981 --> 02:29:51,920
rather than with their time.
You know,

3661
02:29:51,930 --> 02:29:52,910
that's a big,
big issue.

3662
02:29:52,911 --> 02:29:57,911
If your child has trouble in school,
maybe maybe your kid just has trouble in

3663
02:29:57,981 --> 02:29:59,600
school.
I fucking sucked in school.

3664
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:01,790
It doesn't.
It doesn't really.

3665
02:30:02,060 --> 02:30:04,250
Each person is going to have their own 
different thing.

3666
02:30:04,251 --> 02:30:07,400
They're going to be good and bad at it.
You don't necessarily need a pill to try

3667
02:30:07,401 --> 02:30:08,900
to solve that problem all the time.
Yeah,

3668
02:30:08,980 --> 02:30:12,770
and school is fucking gross.
The idea of sitting in a classroom,

3669
02:30:12,771 --> 02:30:15,470
especially with some fucking teacher 
that's unmotivated,

3670
02:30:15,730 --> 02:30:19,460
sit there and you're just supposed to 
absorb this fucking hours on end.

3671
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:22,760
There's a lot of data that's just.
They're not designed for that yet.

3672
02:30:22,790 --> 02:30:25,790
They would thrive doing something in 
life.

3673
02:30:26,050 --> 02:30:28,160
You just have to figure out what that 
something is.

3674
02:30:28,630 --> 02:30:33,630
They can absolutely contributed to just 
not care about geometry or not care 

3675
02:30:33,630 --> 02:30:35,480
about history or not care about whatever
it is that's uninspired.

3676
02:30:35,481 --> 02:30:39,620
Sometimes it's the the teacher.
Some teachers get excited about anything

3677
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:45,280
fun to be around.
Creativity is more important than 

3678
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:45,310
knowledge.
That's like Albert Einstein,

3679
02:30:45,330 --> 02:30:47,330
right with him,
you know,

3680
02:30:47,420 --> 02:30:49,970
he was always a had trouble in school,
learning,

3681
02:30:49,971 --> 02:30:54,971
disabled,
diagnosed with all these learning 

3682
02:30:54,971 --> 02:30:56,921
disabled,
put in a class with the kid that the 

3683
02:30:56,921 --> 02:30:57,440
kids that eat glue and all that stuff.
Like the typical case of that,

3684
02:30:57,500 --> 02:31:01,050
you know,
and he's become very successful off of a

3685
02:31:01,070 --> 02:31:02,240
passion.
Yeah.

3686
02:31:02,320 --> 02:31:04,580
If you just find what it is you're 
really good at.

3687
02:31:04,640 --> 02:31:09,640
I mean there's just.
People have different personalities and 

3688
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:09,640
there's different occupations.

3689
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:10,640
You just got to figure out what works 
for you,

3690
02:31:11,090 --> 02:31:13,430
but all that aside,
it just.

3691
02:31:13,670 --> 02:31:18,590
The sheer numbers of the drugs is what's
freaking me out in this conversation.

3692
02:31:18,930 --> 02:31:23,930
This almost seems like a,
like some crazy plague that no one's 

3693
02:31:23,930 --> 02:31:26,720
talking about disease,
a disease,

3694
02:31:26,750 --> 02:31:31,750
a disease.
It's just spreading across the country 

3695
02:31:31,750 --> 02:31:34,580
and that we're all kind of silent about 
it until it's too late and there's no 

3696
02:31:34,580 --> 02:31:34,580
vaccine,
it's just nothing.

3697
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:37,080
That's why he was so excited to come on 
the show,

3698
02:31:37,230 --> 02:31:38,700
you know,
to be able to talk about it and get,

3699
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:43,760
get more information out there.
And then when does your film come out 

3700
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:44,760
to?
My film will come out in the fall.

3701
02:31:44,790 --> 02:31:49,790
It's not,
we haven't announced the release date 

3702
02:31:49,790 --> 02:31:51,591
yet,
but Samuel Goldwyn is the one that's 

3703
02:31:51,591 --> 02:31:51,591
putting it out on Samuel Goldwyn 
company,

3704
02:31:51,591 --> 02:31:52,370
so they'll get a theatrical release and 
it'll get it,

3705
02:31:52,371 --> 02:31:53,550
you know,
a big digital release.

3706
02:31:53,550 --> 02:31:58,550
So we're excited about that.
Will let me know when that happens and 

3707
02:31:58,550 --> 02:31:59,700
I'd be happy to tweet about it and let 
everybody know about it and put it up on

3708
02:31:59,701 --> 02:32:03,510
facebook and one God.
Damn.

3709
02:32:03,540 --> 02:32:06,850
So do you do these yourself?
Is this your own project?

3710
02:32:06,851 --> 02:32:10,080
Do you storyboard amount you like you?
And it's a little crazy.

3711
02:32:10,081 --> 02:32:11,700
Um,
so I did bigger,

3712
02:32:11,701 --> 02:32:12,520
stronger fat,
you know,

3713
02:32:12,540 --> 02:32:17,540
I went to USC film school when I was 
trying to make films for years and we 

3714
02:32:17,540 --> 02:32:19,350
all struggled trying to like make it,
you know,

3715
02:32:19,351 --> 02:32:20,820
in,
in these different endeavors,

3716
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:23,070
whether it be acting or filmmaking or 
anything.

3717
02:32:23,071 --> 02:32:24,160
So,
uh,

3718
02:32:24,190 --> 02:32:26,460
I was struggling for years writing a 
bunch of scripts,

3719
02:32:26,461 --> 02:32:27,720
getting really close,
you know,

3720
02:32:27,721 --> 02:32:30,030
how it is,
you're really close to getting something

3721
02:32:30,031 --> 02:32:31,030
made.
And you know,

3722
02:32:31,110 --> 02:32:31,930
finally,
after awhile,

3723
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:37,100
like nothing was happening and I said,
if anything in life is going to happen 

3724
02:32:37,100 --> 02:32:37,350
for me,
I need to make it happen.

3725
02:32:37,350 --> 02:32:40,050
I can't be sitting here waiting for 
somebody to go,

3726
02:32:40,051 --> 02:32:40,350
you know,
what,

3727
02:32:40,351 --> 02:32:42,220
I really liked your script.
I'm going to make it or blah,

3728
02:32:42,221 --> 02:32:42,720
blah,
blah blah.

3729
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:45,480
So long story short,
a bigger,

3730
02:32:45,481 --> 02:32:49,130
stronger,
faster was the brain child of,

3731
02:32:49,131 --> 02:32:52,140
of me and my partner is Alex Bono and 
Tamsin Bono.

3732
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:54,450
They were um,
a couple that,

3733
02:32:54,480 --> 02:32:55,330
uh,
you know,

3734
02:32:55,350 --> 02:32:57,540
had experienced with documentaries and 
stuff like that.

3735
02:32:57,541 --> 02:33:00,120
And just through conversations with them
were like,

3736
02:33:00,180 --> 02:33:01,770
fuck it,
let's go make this on our own.

3737
02:33:01,980 --> 02:33:04,740
So we raised all the money,
we went out and we made it on her own.

3738
02:33:04,990 --> 02:33:09,990
Uh,
the second film I did was called trophy 

3739
02:33:09,990 --> 02:33:12,321
kids.
I did that with Peter Berg was the 

3740
02:33:12,321 --> 02:33:12,870
executive producer of that and that was 
a film that because a bigger,

3741
02:33:12,871 --> 02:33:14,010
stronger,
faster pizza,

3742
02:33:14,011 --> 02:33:14,400
like,
hey,

3743
02:33:14,430 --> 02:33:19,430
I want to work with you.
So we did a movie about crazy sports 

3744
02:33:19,430 --> 02:33:19,430
parents.

3745
02:33:19,430 --> 02:33:22,340
I ended up on a hbo and that'll be 
actually be available on demand on 

3746
02:33:22,340 --> 02:33:26,330
November 17th.
That'll be coming out on demand 

3747
02:33:26,330 --> 02:33:26,330
everywhere.
But if you have hbo go,

3748
02:33:26,330 --> 02:33:27,240
you can watch a trophy.
Kids,

3749
02:33:27,660 --> 02:33:29,930
it's called trophy kids are the extended
version is one.

3750
02:33:29,950 --> 02:33:34,500
We actually did a Pete Berg use it as a 
part of his show called state of play.

3751
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:38,070
Um,
so that ended up serving two purposes.

3752
02:33:38,071 --> 02:33:41,220
We got distribution for a movie we 
thought was really cool and uh,

3753
02:33:41,250 --> 02:33:45,330
he got a pilot for a TV show.
So that's available on hbo go now.

3754
02:33:45,510 --> 02:33:47,280
Yeah.
Trophy kids is basically,

3755
02:33:47,281 --> 02:33:47,570
uh,
it's,

3756
02:33:47,580 --> 02:33:52,580
it's so fucking weird.
We just came here and we have this 

3757
02:33:52,580 --> 02:33:55,020
tennis mom that's in,
that's in trophy kids and she's like,

3758
02:33:55,021 --> 02:33:59,100
this really like a godly Jesus Freak.
Uh,

3759
02:33:59,370 --> 02:34:04,370
and we just saw her at the restaurant.
We just say that before when we came 

3760
02:34:04,370 --> 02:34:07,401
here,
I haven't seen her in like two years 

3761
02:34:07,401 --> 02:34:07,401
since we did the movie.

3762
02:34:07,401 --> 02:34:10,190
But yeah,
though that film's really interesting 

3763
02:34:10,190 --> 02:34:11,991
because parents nowadays are really 
putting the pressure on their kids to 

3764
02:34:11,991 --> 02:34:11,991
succeed.
Well,

3765
02:34:11,991 --> 02:34:16,401
I think they always have,
but now there's so much money involved 

3766
02:34:16,401 --> 02:34:17,620
in sports,
getting scarier investments.

3767
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:18,490
Oh,
and the kids,

3768
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:19,700
the kids aren't any good.
You know,

3769
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:21,790
bottom line is like if a kid's good,
they're going to make it,

3770
02:34:21,850 --> 02:34:26,850
you know what I mean?
Like no amount of investing in their 

3771
02:34:26,850 --> 02:34:27,250
quarterback skills is gonna,
you know,

3772
02:34:27,251 --> 02:34:29,830
it'll help some kids get maybe over that
hump.

3773
02:34:29,831 --> 02:34:31,900
But then are you going to beat John 
Jones?

3774
02:34:32,270 --> 02:34:37,270
Yeah.
In Reality John Jones is going to be 

3775
02:34:37,270 --> 02:34:37,270
John John's coming out of the womb,
you know,

3776
02:34:37,270 --> 02:34:37,270
killing you.
You know?

3777
02:34:37,270 --> 02:34:38,320
That's.
Yeah,

3778
02:34:38,370 --> 02:34:43,370
that's the thing about the trophy kids 
or the thing about parents that are 

3779
02:34:43,370 --> 02:34:46,951
really into that.
That's always disturbing is it seems 

3780
02:34:46,951 --> 02:34:47,710
like they're trying to live their lives,
their failures through the kid,

3781
02:34:48,080 --> 02:34:53,080
like they want to sort of reimagine 
their own life and have some success 

3782
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:53,950
through,
through the kids' work.

3783
02:34:54,040 --> 02:34:56,050
I have a basketball dad who's like,
you know,

3784
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:57,520
he'll say,
I say,

3785
02:34:57,521 --> 02:34:59,710
do you think you're living vicariously 
through your son?

3786
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:02,320
Because like,
not vicariously man directly.

3787
02:35:02,860 --> 02:35:05,290
I mean every shot in each move in each 
go.

3788
02:35:05,560 --> 02:35:10,560
And that's why the referees make me want
to pull my hair out or my case make me 

3789
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:14,161
pulled their hair out.
It's like you're listening to this 

3790
02:35:14,161 --> 02:35:14,161
going,
you're fucking crazy.

3791
02:35:14,450 --> 02:35:15,220
Your mind,
you know,

3792
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:20,360
and,
and it's just normal behavior to these 

3793
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:20,360
people.
It's this everyday behavior.

3794
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:21,370
I said,
how much did you spend on your son,

3795
02:35:21,910 --> 02:35:23,950
uh,
on your son's basketball career?

3796
02:35:24,260 --> 02:35:25,560
And he,
he goes,

3797
02:35:25,561 --> 02:35:27,580
I said,
I'd say two lamborghinis easy.

3798
02:35:28,180 --> 02:35:33,180
And who,
who measures their wealth and 

3799
02:35:33,180 --> 02:35:33,180
lamborghinis.
First of all,

3800
02:35:33,180 --> 02:35:34,050
that's weird with the,
um,

3801
02:35:34,090 --> 02:35:36,490
did you see this story on a Todd 
Marinovich?

3802
02:35:36,580 --> 02:35:38,060
Yeah.
Timer intervention,

3803
02:35:38,110 --> 02:35:41,830
which is another similar story,
but to the extreme is a great movie that

3804
02:35:41,831 --> 02:35:44,410
a espn did as part as part of the 30 for
30,

3805
02:35:44,411 --> 02:35:48,030
which I actually pitched them that be 
at,

3806
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:51,130
pitched them that before they did it so 
that somebody else had pitched it like I

3807
02:35:51,131 --> 02:35:52,330
guess right around the same time.

3808
02:35:52,670 --> 02:35:54,480
Um,
and they did a great job with.

3809
02:35:54,490 --> 02:35:55,810
I thought it was awesome.
Yeah.

3810
02:35:55,811 --> 02:35:59,100
And it's a very disturbing story,
but it's also an,

3811
02:35:59,660 --> 02:36:04,660
it really highlights the problem because
here you've got a guy who's like an all 

3812
02:36:04,660 --> 02:36:08,641
time,
great nfl strength and conditioning 

3813
02:36:08,641 --> 02:36:10,960
coach understands the science of 
strength and conditioning and,

3814
02:36:10,961 --> 02:36:13,990
and,
and preparing someone for a sport almost

3815
02:36:13,991 --> 02:36:16,390
better than anybody.
And he has a kid and he says,

3816
02:36:16,391 --> 02:36:17,470
you know what?
Listen,

3817
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:19,680
I got fucking project now.
Turn this kid into.

3818
02:36:19,681 --> 02:36:24,681
And it worked.
But meanwhile the kid didn't want to do 

3819
02:36:24,681 --> 02:36:24,681
it and it became a heroin addict.
I became an artist.

3820
02:36:24,681 --> 02:36:25,960
He's like,
I don't want to do it.

3821
02:36:26,370 --> 02:36:28,720
And I think that's what happens when he 
pushed kids too much.

3822
02:36:28,721 --> 02:36:31,390
Like a kid kinda has to find out how 
talented thing.

3823
02:36:31,420 --> 02:36:34,960
How talented Todd Marinovich is.
I've spoken with them several times.

3824
02:36:34,961 --> 02:36:36,240
He's actually cool.

3825
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:41,280
Really super cool guy.
He told me he went and played in arena 

3826
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:44,581
football league game and he was 
withdrawing from heroin so bad that he 

3827
02:36:44,581 --> 02:36:48,580
had shit his pants and he had thrown 10 
touchdown passes with shit in his pants.

3828
02:36:48,630 --> 02:36:50,940
Oh my goodness.
He just like,

3829
02:36:51,080 --> 02:36:52,420
it was so easy for me.
He's like,

3830
02:36:52,421 --> 02:36:53,820
footballs easy man.
It's just like,

3831
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:55,870
it's just like numbers.
Don't leave them.

3832
02:36:55,900 --> 02:36:57,780
Boom.
Won a heisman trophy.

3833
02:36:57,790 --> 02:37:02,790
Didn't know he was close up for it.
I think his dad is a fucking freak man.

3834
02:37:03,011 --> 02:37:05,190
His Dad did an amazing job with Bj Penn 
to.

3835
02:37:05,220 --> 02:37:07,020
Yeah,
and it's his dad's a freak man.

3836
02:37:07,021 --> 02:37:09,880
Is that they think they've made amends 
with all that stuff.

3837
02:37:10,060 --> 02:37:11,590
It's just hard to do it to your own 
kids.

3838
02:37:11,620 --> 02:37:14,530
You can do it to somebody else's kid and
make them a fucking machine,

3839
02:37:14,990 --> 02:37:16,220
but you're not the.
You also

3840
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:19,520
don't want know what your kid wants.
I think like at a young age,

3841
02:37:19,521 --> 02:37:21,440
I think todd Marinovich said,
I want to be in the nfl,

3842
02:37:21,441 --> 02:37:23,090
but what kid doesn't say that?
You know?

3843
02:37:23,360 --> 02:37:24,170
Well,
not only that,

3844
02:37:24,171 --> 02:37:26,930
what kid doesn't change his mind when he
becomes 16 or 18,

3845
02:37:26,931 --> 02:37:28,910
there's a certain side of it too.
They'll look at the dad.

3846
02:37:29,030 --> 02:37:34,030
You know,
I was influenced heavily by my older 

3847
02:37:34,030 --> 02:37:34,030
brother.
I wanted to be,

3848
02:37:34,030 --> 02:37:34,030
I want it to be like,
yeah,

3849
02:37:34,030 --> 02:37:35,960
I want,
wanted to be like theater and drama.

3850
02:37:36,350 --> 02:37:38,900
I wanted to do these other things that 
are considered like,

3851
02:37:38,930 --> 02:37:39,740
oh,
you're a Pansy,

3852
02:37:39,770 --> 02:37:40,510
what are,
you know.

3853
02:37:40,930 --> 02:37:45,930
And,
and so those things through the culture 

3854
02:37:45,930 --> 02:37:46,070
I grew up in was like,
you're not tough if you do those things.

3855
02:37:46,071 --> 02:37:48,050
We did when we were kids.
It was gay,

3856
02:37:48,510 --> 02:37:51,410
it was considered soccer's gay.
That's gay.

3857
02:37:51,411 --> 02:37:53,150
So what,
when I wanted to like,

3858
02:37:53,990 --> 02:37:58,990
you know,
what I had like a passion to make films 

3859
02:37:58,990 --> 02:37:58,990
and do that stuff.

3860
02:37:58,990 --> 02:37:58,990
It was sort of hard to tell everybody 
like,

3861
02:37:58,990 --> 02:38:00,020
hey man,
I'm not really,

3862
02:38:00,110 --> 02:38:01,970
I don't really care that much about 
lifting anymore.

3863
02:38:01,971 --> 02:38:02,920
I want to go this way,
you know,

3864
02:38:02,960 --> 02:38:04,410
or whatever.
It's that,

3865
02:38:04,411 --> 02:38:05,580
that stuff's weird,
you know?

3866
02:38:06,280 --> 02:38:06,950
Well,
bigger,

3867
02:38:06,951 --> 02:38:08,540
stronger,
faster is available.

3868
02:38:08,541 --> 02:38:10,870
It's been available for a long time.
Um,

3869
02:38:11,020 --> 02:38:16,020
but trophy kids available right now on 
hbo go and when is this new one coming 

3870
02:38:16,020 --> 02:38:20,591

It shouldn't be out in like the late 

3871
02:38:20,591 --> 02:38:20,591
fall.
We don't have a release date,

3872
02:38:20,591 --> 02:38:20,710
fall prescription thugs.
When I'll,

3873
02:38:20,711 --> 02:38:25,711
I'll help you promote it.
I'll absolutely take you about it on

Even though I'm not none of them 

3882
02:38:43,211 --> 02:38:45,080
anymore.
I shaved my balls for this interview,

3883
02:38:45,081 --> 02:38:46,720
so I appreciate it.
I'm glad you did that.

3884
02:38:46,750 --> 02:38:48,760
I shaved my last night.
Awesome.

3885
02:38:48,770 --> 02:38:53,770
Nice feeling to know that someone else 
in the room shares prepped my shorn 

3886
02:38:53,770 --> 02:38:54,950
ball.

Oh Man.

Shut up.
