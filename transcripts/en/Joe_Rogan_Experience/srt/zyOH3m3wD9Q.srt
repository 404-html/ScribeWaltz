1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,970
The joe rogan experience. You know,
I remember coming back and, um,

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,340
this kid beat the shit out of me.
Bobby Buckley and my father said,

3
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:13,560
what are you doing at home? You
got to go back out there. What?

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,060
I'm going to go back out and fight them
against fucking all right. Yeah. But I,

5
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:18,894
you know,

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,300
there's a lot of different ways to be like
in Charlestown grown up. I mean, I was,

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,010
I grew up with some guys that were like
unbelievable. Like, you know, there's a,

8
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:33,810
there's a whole moral thing maybe or a
social thing about say robbing a bank.

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,110
I mean, would that ever
fricking cross your mind? No,

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,440
but that's a Charles town thing. That's
one thing that is true about that movie,

11
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:44,220
that town, but, but what I was in awe
of people that would do it. It's like,

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,650
where do you get the boss?
You know?

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,200
And I'll never forget this friend of mine,
Joey Rocco's no longer with us.

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,980
So I see him up at government some.
You remember government center? Yeah.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,290
So I see him up there and he's got
like his lunch and I said, Joe,

16
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:05,740
how you doing? And he's kind of blew me
off and I seen him a week later. He said,

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,050
say Swayne's, what's up? I said,
what's up? You blew me off a week ago.

18
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,210
He said, Oh, I'm so sorry.

19
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:17,120
I was waiting to Rob Crimson travel and
I had my gun there and I was into cause

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,330
interrupting his work.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,680
So he came into Nick's
comedy stop to 400 people.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,580
I did fantastic. I was like practically
a standing ovation, whatever.

23
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:31,290
So Joe's in the audience, right. And
I, I, so I talked to him afterwards.

24
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:35,700
So there's a number of things he could
say like, Jeez, I liked his show.

25
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,490
I didn't like your show.
Good for you getting out of Charlestown.

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,740
He gave me this look. I was like, wow,
it's got to be a lot of money in here.

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,730
I said, you think I'm here
to case the joint for you?

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,090
It was unbelievable.
We used to,

29
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:55,140
a part of the thing that bugged shots
down growing up was he had a shoplifter

30
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,380
that was, did you do that when
you were a kid? Like, shit,

31
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,570
I got caught shoplifting candy.
Why Andy? Yeah, you were bad.

32
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,340
You probably was terrified. Right? Again,
I got brought into a manager's office,

33
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:09,990
I think it was 12. Oh yeah, I
got in trouble. I was terrible
too. I was so paranoid.

34
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,820
But anyway,

35
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,820
there was a department store called
Jordan Marsh and my job was to catch a

36
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,700
football. They throw me the football,
I'd catch it and run down Tremont street.

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,500
So we've just, you know,
stolen a football. Right.
So that's, that was the Gig.

38
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,240
So one time I'm up there and uh,

39
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,260
saw the kid system, he pick up the end
of this cannula. I said what? He said,

40
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:42,261
grab the end of the cannula still in a
fucking Canoga what's all walking down?

41
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:47,580
Wash the student Boston with a canoe
right now. I don't know where you're from,

42
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:51,960
but it's not a big item.
And Charlestown canoes and the projects,

43
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:52,651
you know what I mean?

44
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:56,520
It's like not something that you
felt you couldn't fence it then.

45
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,550
Nothing's like the four of us though.
The chemistry with the finance can't.

46
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,940
You can't fuck with it.
No.

47
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:05,010
It is the best and it's the most fun
by far is the most fun to watch, right?

48
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,190
Different dynamic. Yeah, but the talking
over, my God, I tried to listen to it.

49
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,203
You did.

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,340
I tried to listen to something that
you do because I want to know what it

51
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:14,800
sounded like. We were talking
over everybody. It's terrible.

52
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,280
I haven't been that drunk and high
and a long time and it was awesome.

53
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,330
People for whatever reason,

54
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:27,160
love those kind of chaos shows like
that Alex Jones show, they love chaos.

55
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,910
They'll love it.

56
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,910
They'll love a straw and stoned and an
interdimensional child molesters and

57
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:36,550
fucking, they love all that shit.
They love it off the charts. Nuts.

58
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,820
That Alex Jones one though.
I told you I've never been a fan of his.

59
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:42,790
Then I watched it. I'm like got
gotta like them now. People are mad.

60
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,550
Some people are mad at me, but you know
there's nothing I can do about that.

61
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:46,600
There's going to be mad at me anyway.

62
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,620
But one of the things that they were
saying was, you know, fuck you for, uh,

63
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,160
there were saying, giving them a platform
for normalizing him. And I'm like,

64
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:57,820
you've got to understand. That's how
I know him. I know him like that.

65
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,800
That's how I know him. I know that guy.
That guy. Yes. That guy that came on here,

66
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,000
and this is the guy that,

67
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,930
by the way on his show said he was
gonna kick my ass and break my legs and

68
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:10,420
fucking all kinds of crazy shit and
I want to find him in the UFC fight.

69
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,950
I'm a offer him $1
million. Like I, I knew,

70
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,180
I knew him. I know the real him. I'm like,
well, we're not in front of each other.

71
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:22,900
You could say crazy shit. And
like I'm immune man. I don't care.

72
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,970
It doesn't bother me. I
don't care anymore. Let's,

73
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:27,490
he's doing an entertainment show.
He is doing entertainment but,

74
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,150
but when I know is the Alex
Jones, those here, and by the way,

75
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:32,500
he was right about a lot of shit.

76
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,790
A lot of the crazy shit that he's saying
about about fucking human pig hybrids

77
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:41,791
that they're working on those and
actually making human pig hybrid fetuses.

78
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,760
That's real.
They really aren't.

79
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,100
The problem is he throws so much
shit out there all at one time.

80
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,780
I don't know what to
believe in what exactly.

81
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:53,020
And you got to slow down to look into all
of that and you got to go sweat. Whoa,

82
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,810
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Let's take
start. Start over again. What,

83
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,790
what's happening on the moon?
He's for sure crazy. I like him,

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,140
but he's,
he's crazy.

85
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,260
But I think the crazy is okay and it's
entertaining and I'm not a fucking child.

86
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,640
So if you want a nerf the world and
make the world so that only children can

87
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:14,440
watch everybody cause like make,

88
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:18,940
make things their own that are safe
for everyone, including children. Well,

89
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,730
I don't want that. I want,
I'm a discerning adults.

90
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm pretty rational and I can figure
out what's real and what's nonsense.

91
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,550
But I don't look at the political spectrum
of people when I'm looking at you.

92
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,390
You have a bias,
you're biased and you are,

93
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,050
you're targeting specific
individuals because your rule
support this perspective.

94
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,770
No. Well, can you be clear though and
like what rules support that perse,

95
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:42,370
but specifically the,
the easiest one is mis-gendering right?

96
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:44,230
Because that's so clearly ideological.

97
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,150
If you ask a conservative
what is mis-gendering,

98
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,100
they'll say if someone is biologically
male and you call them, you know,

99
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,520
she a biologic and man you called
the machine that's mis-gender as a

100
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,800
conservative view, the, the, the
progressive view is inverted.

101
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,310
So now you actually have in your
policies a rule against the conservative

102
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,160
perspective.

103
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,420
I have a rule against the
abuse and harassment of
trans people on our platform.

104
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,620
That's what my rule is.

105
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:12,350
Can we just give context in the
background as to why the why that is.

106
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,120
And I brought some,
some research.

107
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:17,630
So we obviously received
a lot of feedback.

108
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,060
So we don't make these roles in a vacuum.
And just to be clear,

109
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,930
we have a bunch of people all around the
world to give us context and the types

110
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:27,620
of behavior they're seeing,
how that translates into real world harm.

111
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,790
And they give us feedback and they tell
us like you should consider different

112
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,750
types of rules, different types of
perspectives, different. Like for example,

113
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:39,440
when we try to enforce hateful conduct
in a are hateful conduct policy and in

114
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,274
particular country,

115
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,940
we are not going to know all the slur
words that are used to target people of a

116
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:46,490
particular race or a particular religion.

117
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,200
So we're going to rely on building out
a team of experts all around the world

118
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,120
who are going to help
us enforce our rules.

119
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,350
So in the particular case
of Ms Generating, I'm just
trying to pull up, um,

120
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,120
some of the studies that we looked at,

121
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:04,121
but we looked at the American Association
of Pediatrics and looked at the number

122
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:08,450
of transgender youths that were
committing suicide. It's an astronomical,

123
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,580
I'm sorry, I can't find it right
now in front of me. It's a really,

124
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:11,391
really high statistic.

125
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:15,020
That's like 10 times what the normal
suicide rate is of normal teenagers.

126
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,830
And we looked at the causes of what that
was happening and a lot of it was not

127
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:20,570
just violence towards those individuals,

128
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:23,300
but it was bullying behavior and what was,

129
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,390
what were those bullying behaviors
that were contributing to that.

130
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,840
And that's why we made this rule because
we thought and we believe that those

131
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:36,110
types of behaviors were happening on
our platform and we wanted to stop it.

132
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,550
Now there are exceptions to this
rule. We don't, and this is all,

133
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,650
this isn't about like public figures and
there's always gonna be public figures

134
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:45,290
that you're going to want to talk
about and that's, that's fine.

135
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,770
But this is about are you doing something
with the intention of abusing and

136
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:52,610
harassing a trans person on the platform
and are they viewing it that way and

137
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:57,050
reporting it to us so that we take action.
So I will just state,

138
00:07:57,051 --> 00:08:00,350
I actually agree with the rule on,
from my point of view,

139
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:04,280
I agree that bullying and harassing
Trans People's in higher, entirely wrong.

140
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,143
I disagree with it,

141
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,160
but I just want to make sure it's
clear to everybody who's listening.

142
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:08,830
My point is simply that,
you know,

143
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,570
Ben Shapiro went on a talk show and
absolutely refused and that's his shtick,

144
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,250
you know, and he's one of the
biggest podcasts in the world.

145
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,240
So if you have all of his millions upon
millions of followers who are looking at

146
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:20,901
this rule saying,

147
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:25,010
this goes against my view of the world
and it's literally 60 plus million in

148
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:28,120
this country, you do have a rule that's
ideologically bent and, and it's,

149
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,650
it's true. You, you did the
research, you believe this.

150
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,220
Well then you have Ben Shapiro who did
his risk research and doesn't believe it.

151
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:39,020
Yeah. And I relied on the
American Association of
Pediatrics and uh, you know,

152
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:41,810
human rights council and other,
and I'm sure he has his sources too,

153
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:43,520
for when he gives his statements.
The point is,

154
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,380
I just wonder if they have
that context. I mean, that's,

155
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,500
and that's where we have also failed.

156
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,840
It's just explaining the
why behind a lot of reasons.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,950
I would agree.
And I think it's fine.

158
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:58,020
You did research and you
found this to be true,

159
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,160
but we can't simply say maybe Ben Shapiro
and the other conservatives who feel

160
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,710
this way, don't know.
We have to. We can't.

161
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,530
You know the point I'm trying to make us.
It's simply whether you believe it,

162
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,410
whether you justified or not is
not the point. The point is you do,

163
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,800
you do have this role. That role is at
odds with conservatives, period. Well,

164
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,950
I think, I think that
you're, you're generalizing,

165
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:20,340
but I think it is really important as
Jack said, to the why behind these things,

166
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,880
the why is to protect people from
abuse and harassment on our plot.

167
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,980
No, I understand. But you've
essentially created a protected class.

168
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,720
If this is the case, because despite
these studies and what you know,

169
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,750
these studies are showing
there's a gigantic suicide
rate amongst trans people,

170
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:42,220
period. It's a 40% it's an
outrageously large. Now,

171
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:46,870
whether that is because of
gender dysphoria with us
because of the complications

172
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:50,380
from sexual surgery,
sexual transition surgery,

173
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,880
whether it's because of bullying,

174
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,690
whether it's because of this awful
feeling of being born in the wrong gender,

175
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:57,880
whether that all that
is yet to be determined.

176
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,650
The fact that they've shown that there's
a large amount of trans people that are

177
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:07,300
committing suicide,
I don't necessarily think that that makes,

178
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,710
that makes sense in terms of
people from someone's perspective,

179
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:16,150
like a Ben Shapiro saying that
if you are biologically female,

180
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,810
if you are born with
a double x chromosome,

181
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,400
you will never be x, y.
If he says that that's,

182
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:27,280
that's a violation of
your policy and this is,

183
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:30,150
you are creating a protected class too

184
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,600
to be fair targeted

185
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,520
or we're targeting to
express that opinion.

186
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,220
So would it be selling entitled
to express that opinion? You know,

187
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,810
our bodies will be living differently in
a world that's two degrees warmer than

188
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:46,600
they are today. We can't really
predict what those impacts will be,

189
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:47,980
but it could be quite dramatic.

190
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,670
And they could be things that we can't
even imagine today because they're,

191
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,200
you know,
by some counts,

192
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,200
millions of bacteria inside us that
we haven't even identified yet.

193
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:57,650
Okay.

194
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,190
Jesus Christ, you're freaking
me out, David. God dammit.

195
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,740
It's a crazy world out there.
It will, not just crazy,

196
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:08,490
but it seems like when you're
talking about things like this,

197
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:11,810
when you're talking about climate change
affecting our actual gut parasites or

198
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,900
our gut biome, and that this literally
could change the way human beings behave.

199
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,593
I mean,

200
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,130
these are all things that I've
never heard discussed and it just,

201
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,030
it's really terrifying,
really is, you know, I mean,

202
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,810
and part of the problem is people hear
like, oh, relax, everything's fine.

203
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,960
This is this constant thing that we do
where if it's not affecting us currently,

204
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,090
right now in the moment,
there's not a fire in front of us.

205
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,210
We don't worry about it.
It's a weird compartment,

206
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,030
compartmentalization thing
that human beings do.

207
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,880
Yeah. And, um, it's, you know,

208
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,490
you'd think that evolution would
have trained us differently.

209
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,880
You think that evolution would have
trained us over time to have at least some

210
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,823
longterm

211
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,970
capacity. And I guess we do have some
long term planning capacity, but it's um,

212
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,170
we choose to think we're in really
short term ways just about all the time.

213
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,161
People don't understand.

214
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:07,030
They think just because someone doesn't
have the best vocabulary or because they

215
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:10,960
don't have a, a comprehensive
education that they're not intelligent.

216
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,430
And that's a big mistake.

217
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,160
No Tyson, Tyson's intelligent. Uh,

218
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:18,540
I remember going to the
Catskills when I was, uh,

219
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,340
I won the world junior championships
in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

220
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,610
And I remember the
American team was saying,

221
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,790
oh well you never fought the best of them.
I couldn't find the best.

222
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,360
I thought American sent them
best team. Yeah. But one guy,

223
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,630
he doesn't like taking plans in this.
Managers don't like taking plans either.

224
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,950
Cause I'm like, who's that? And he
told me it was Mike Tyson custom model.

225
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,000
So me and my trainer, we left Canada
and we drove all the way up there.

226
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,620
And while we were up there, raise the
Roderick was up there and they said, oh,

227
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,030
raise really came to inspire with
us. So okay, I spar with the,

228
00:12:53,031 --> 00:12:57,500
I'm here for four days.
So first time Tyson actually met me,

229
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,430
you know, he was Nice Guy, really
nice guy, took me in his room,

230
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:05,690
showed me some old flicks I've never seen
before of old time fighters would tell

231
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:10,280
me about each fighter, like he
studied them and then, um, you know,

232
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:14,730
this is where he got his old star is
his style of fighting from. And uh,

233
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,610
first day in the first day in the gym,
Bell went,

234
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,060
he came across and he was trying
to kill me. Like, you know,

235
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,150
I did my Muhammad Ali thing,
obviously stayed away from his power,

236
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,560
but the first day was really hectic and
then the second day was a little hectic

237
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,120
and that got better as it went along.

238
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,260
And the last day is I got actually
the better of him the last day.

239
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,730
And I remember Costa Motto and Mike,
you're going to meet him some day,

240
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:41,810
don't you do that?

241
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,310
And that always echoed in my
mind that will we ever fight?

242
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:49,910
Will we have a fight? Cause custom model
said that we're going to fight. Well,

243
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:53,450
and it did happen. And there's
footage of it. Yeah. Wow.

244
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,390
Lennox has the footage of it. Footage
of the training sessions, barring,

245
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:02,600
how old was Tyson at the time?
Tyson was like, uh, he was about 52.

246
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,670
No, no. How old was he at the time?
Oh, at the time. 15. Um, he was,

247
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:12,410
he was younger than me. I was
on Sunday. He's about 17. Wow.
