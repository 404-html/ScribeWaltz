1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,580
Or Drum on his show
and we'll live.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,310
This is what I love about
bill burr. You're not like
a regular comedian. You're,

3
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:12,480
I mean, you're a great comic, but
you do shit. You do a lot of shit.

4
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:17,481
You don't just sit around and get
lazy and fuck off and you make cakes.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,240
You,
you made pie homemade pie from scratch.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,840
Bill burr brought in Pumpkin pie
that I can't wait to dig into.

7
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:26,160
It smells fucking fantastic.

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,480
Stick. That's a pumpkin pie and
it's a cream pie and apple pie.

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,500
It's really smells fucking awesome.
Oh yeah. It's a butter baste crust.

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,730
I switched over,
I switched over.

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,370
I used to buy parents. The
one that we grew up on was,
was shortening, like Crisco.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,890
Right. And I thought I had
too much salt in it and stuff.

13
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:47,870
So when I bought the big green egg,

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,820
which is this insane thing that you
some possible to fuck up on. Yeah.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm actually learning how to smoke me guy.
This guy,

16
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,570
he's been helping me out and uh,
I just been on the road,

17
00:00:56,571 --> 00:01:00,560
so I'm going to try starting back up
again, um, this month. But, um, they,

18
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,000
I came with this giant cookbook,

19
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:04,040
like I made this Turkey pot pie
and everything that tastes good.

20
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,100
Fucking insane from scratch.
Yeah.

21
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,610
But the crust is on the one from the
big green egg as a recipe that I use,

22
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:13,760
which is two scoops of flour and
eighth of a teaspoon of salt.

23
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:15,560
And then it's like a
whole stick of butter.

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,260
And then there's a little bit of
shortening, like the Crisco Shit in that.

25
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:22,310
But it's, so it's not like a mine
was, it was too greasy, too salty.

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,060
This one is like that flaky, that
fucking awesome crust. And yeah,

27
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,183
it's the best.

28
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,140
So you're like,
you're like a chef,

29
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,230
you're like actively cooking was like a
regular thing. Faker. Bill Baker. Yeah,

30
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,680
I like it.
I liked it.

31
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:41,640
I liked like degrees of difficulty and
I actually learned a lot back when the

32
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:43,200
food network was awesome.

33
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,370
Like the food necco networkers going on
the same trajectory that MTV went on.

34
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,301
You know what I mean?

35
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:51,990
Like it started off MTV was music videos
and then now I don't even know what the

36
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:55,200
fuck it is. It's teenage pregnancy.
There's no music on anymore.

37
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,190
The food network used to be top
chefs teaching you how to cook.

38
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,870
Now it's a lot of just, you know, they're
fighting, competing with each other.

39
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:05,670
Like I don't even know.
I don't even know what goes on in this.

40
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,910
And it's a lot more personality driven
like that diners driving and and dives

41
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:14,880
guy, you know what I mean? Like that
is what is an easy just, you know,

42
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:19,881
he drives around to the greasy spoons
and he lets you know is what's up and a,

43
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:23,040
but dude, the guy's restaurants
get horrific fucking reviews.

44
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,080
Like just like one of the most epic
slams have any fucking restaurant that

45
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,940
opened was very, yeah, yeah. That
guy. Yeah, that guy. So like they,

46
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,930
they went more in that
direction where they,

47
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,540
they went from guys just knowing
how to cook until like Guy Fieri,

48
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,980
he's got to look, he's got bleach blonde
hair, he wears his sunglasses backwards.

49
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:44,490
We have them drive around in the car.
I'm not really shitting on the guy,

50
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:49,050
but they, they went more like that and
they tried to like, you know, it all.

51
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:51,180
And this is okay. So
Rachael Ray pops up. Okay.

52
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:53,620
We've got to find another one
of those. You know, it just, I,

53
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,810
it was really sad to watch cause I
used to just watch molto Mario was my

54
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:01,590
favorite and he would just be
in a kitchen and he would just,

55
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,930
what was any of these people? I, I
heard of the guy from here. He got him.

56
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:09,250
I met him. He's a based really how
he's a beast. He's a good dude.

57
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:12,970
This guy would be like, I'm trying to
compare him to a fighter. Jon Jones.

58
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,640
He'd be like someone who held the belt
for a while, you know what I mean?

59
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,620
Anderson Silva of cooking. I would
say that. Or maybe JP do you have,

60
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,730
what is it nearby? I'm not good
with the fire doors. Saint Pierre.

61
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,720
George Saint Pierre P of cooking.
Although he was early on.

62
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,270
So I think maybe he's more like
those guys when it was foreign.

63
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:31,720
It was literally taekwondo versus a boxer.
He came on early.

64
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,250
So that's the guy. Yeah. So you
were, that's an unfortunate picture.

65
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,640
It's just a highlight is
mole. Yeah, he's um, he, he,

66
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:46,090
so he used to have the show multiple
Mario and it was just him in his kitchen.

67
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,230
It was him in his kitchen.
And He, Oh God, he needs,

68
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,930
he needs somebody to take better pictures.
So what sausage are on the next?

69
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,170
A great look. Yeah, it's supposed
to look like a scarf. I don't know.

70
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:59,140
So he would just have people over in
his kitchen and he would make authentic

71
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:03,100
from scratch, just uh, uh, Italian
meals and he went over to Italy,

72
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:03,821
learned how to cook.

73
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:07,300
He can tell you about all the different
parts of Italy in the rivalries that

74
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,800
they have over there with their food.

75
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,520
That's why Italians are the greatest
fucking cookers ever. Cause like they,

76
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,250
they get upset with shit
like sauces and stuff.

77
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:18,010
The way other people kill each
other over like their football team.

78
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,160
You know what I mean? Like
they just don't, oh this,
this part doesn't do it right.

79
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:24,460
This is the way we do
it. And, um, I learned,

80
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,280
I just watched him making these
meals and it would be like, he would,

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,490
each little part of the meal would have
the three or four ingredients and then,

82
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:31,690
well,

83
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,830
however he was getting it going and then
it would all come together and he would

84
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:39,760
just be shooting the shit. Talking about
Italy as he made his friends a meal,

85
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,340
which is the greatest thing he could have
a fucking deal was cook for somebody.

86
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:46,180
I think one of the grace. Um, so it
was just a simple show. I used to,

87
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:49,360
used to come on at like noon time.
I watched it every fucking day.

88
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,210
I would wake up after doing
spots late at the, uh,

89
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:54,930
the seller and all that mural
back I was living with like, uh,

90
00:04:54,931 --> 00:04:56,920
I was after I lived at Bobby Kelly,
but you know,

91
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,370
we'd stay out late and shit and I
would sleep til like fucking 11.

92
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:01,770
I would wake up and rather than,

93
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:06,460
than watching like the prices right or
some shit, I would just pop that on. And,

94
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:11,050
uh, I, I dunno, just watching him
was interesting and then I learned,

95
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,180
I just learned how to cook, you know,
making fucking a pasta from scratch.

96
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,110
His well method. You make pasta from
scratch. It's not hard dude. Really.

97
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,430
So you do the flour,

98
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:26,431
the eggs everyday it's having the balls
to just allow yourself to fuck it up

99
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:30,400
going like, I'm going to fuck this
up. Like I made a key lime pie and a,

100
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,800
I fucked it up because they
want a little bit of the,

101
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:33,790
I think it's called the Rhine,

102
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,930
which is just a little bit like the zest
of the lime and I didn't know what I

103
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:41,380
was doing and I went to Tepe too deep
and I got to the white part and that's

104
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:45,220
when it gets bitter and it fucked the
whole pie up. And I was like, ah, fuck it.

105
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,850
I had to throw the thing out. But
then you know, it's, you know,

106
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,640
it's anything if you just fuck it
up and then fix it, it's like, uh,

107
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,960
if I had the time, you know, I would
learn how to rebuild an engine on a car.

108
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,180
I love watching those shows, but like
on, I've always thought like, you know,

109
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:02,750
I'm going to buy like a
fucking 82 Chevy citation.

110
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,530
Just some fucking hunk of
shit. Start with that. Yeah.

111
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:10,430
And well just cause I don't give a fuck
about it and you can screw up on that.

112
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,190
Like I tried to learn how to rebuild a
carburetor and rather than doing the one

113
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:15,320
on my truck,
the 68 f 100,

114
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,650
I bought the same carburetor off of Ebay
that was fixed and I just took it apart

115
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,740
and then try putting it back together.
I fucked it up.

116
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,770
That's still something that bugs me.
It's sitting in my garage like in pieces.

117
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:30,860
But like did you take lessons or do you
just try to figure it out on your own?

118
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:33,230
Youtube,
just youtube to drum lessons.

119
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:36,410
I take those but like a
youtube and shit like uh,

120
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,680
there's certain things like I would
take a cooking class or something,

121
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,820
but most of my fucking add
like the Internet is perfect
so you could shut it off

122
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:44,450
when you want to.

123
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,480
Tying and read about the Illuminati and
then I'm learning how to make a pie.

124
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,280
And then I'm watching a bear
fight and eagle just like,

125
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,880
like fucking the Internet was made for
fucking add psychos like me and I just

126
00:06:57,171 --> 00:07:02,080
will literally just fly through all of
this, all of that stuff. And um, I've,

127
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,320
I've learned to like,

128
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,040
I didn't think I had add then my wife
said I had it and then there was that

129
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:11,000
whole woke, should you fucking,
you know, do something about this.

130
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:12,890
And I just really realized that,
uh,

131
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,990
I just got to learn how
to make it work for me.

132
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,080
So what I always have is I always
have like nine things going at once.

133
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,870
You know what I mean? Playing drums,
learn how to play a helicopter.

134
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:23,630
I'm make a pie from scratch,
but the over to over.

135
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:25,770
The thing is the fucking comedy.
But the thing is,

136
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:29,510
is doing all of that and fucking up and
failing and all the people that I meet

137
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:31,340
in these different parts,
you know,

138
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:34,920
hobbies and shit ends up informing
like characters and shit when you or,

139
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:39,170
or points of view and stuff like, you
know, like shit I used to buy into that,

140
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:42,620
you know, the flyover states, people
down the south, down south of dom,

141
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:45,620
all that stupid shit that people on
the coasting and then you go there,

142
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:47,660
you're like, wait a minute,
these people are fucking cool.

143
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,950
They're doing different
things. So um, that's how,

144
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,480
that's how I got into like
barbecue and smoking and stuff.

145
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:56,360
So like when I go on the road, I tried
to do that. That when in Rome thing

146
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,130
it's different now. Lemme think when
we were kids, when we were kids,

147
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:00,590
I think that was more applicable but good.

148
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,980
But the Internet is informed more people
and sort of educated people in a way

149
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:07,140
there. There's this cool
place people everywhere you

150
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,660
are now. Yeah. But it also,

151
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:12,860
it depends on how you use any
information you get. Like, if you,

152
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:15,440
if you just wanted to reinforce it,
like the joke I was doing,

153
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:19,460
my act as everybody just
goes to [inaudible] dot com
and just reads a bunch of

154
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:22,760
facts and then just throws it at people.
But I mean I'm guilty of that too, but,

155
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,420
um, I dunno, I have faith,

156
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:30,380
but like watching the kinds of people
that have been coming out of the woodwork

157
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:34,610
and this latest, uh, election, you know,

158
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:39,470
a couple of those guys like watching,
um, ted Cruz now just watching like,

159
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,310
um, I would say, uh, what's his
face? They had Donald Trump,

160
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,400
the way he bullies the media and when,
what pussies they are,

161
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,570
how they just backed down.

162
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:50,390
They really just back then all you gotta
do I ever know that you just got to

163
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,530
give him shit back.

164
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,080
He just like gives him shit and they just
stay fucking there and take it. It's,

165
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:59,970
it's not at first it was funny to me
cause I used to love watching a bill.

166
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:03,240
Parcells was one of my
favorites to watch when he,

167
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:06,990
when he would do a coach for the
giants, patriots, uh, cowboys,

168
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:11,160
munch a bunch of places he was at, but
he would, uh, in his press conferences,

169
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,290
if you asked him a stupid question,

170
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,690
he would tear your fucking head off in
such a perfect way that everybody else in

171
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,700
the room was like, Oh shit,
I'm not asking them this one.

172
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:22,330
I've got to make sure I'm
on my game. Like, and,

173
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:24,690
and he took charge of it because I,

174
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,530
that's one of the ones where I'm rooting
for the guy because I feel like this is

175
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:33,300
a bunch of nerds who may be, they, they
played varsity fucking based. We don't,

176
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,570
you know, the way they come at him like,
well what did you do this, you know,

177
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:38,520
now that they know the
result was something bad.

178
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,210
I like when he's giving him shit,
but like, um, I just, you know,

179
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:46,410
some of the shit that just watching him,
um, I liked it. He's going back at him.

180
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:49,890
But the way that they just
are backing off him like, oh,

181
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:53,400
I didn't know he was going to make me
look stupid. They just like implode.

182
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,950
Like he sat there, I went
once, it was fucking hilarious.

183
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:59,730
He was not at first republican
debate. They were going,
you said this about women,

184
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:02,490
you said that about women. You said
this about women. He goes, Nah,

185
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,810
cause I said that about Rosie O'donnell
and it got a huge laugh. And she goes, no,

186
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:09,540
you've said that about other blah blah
blah blah. The women that he just goes,

187
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,550
hey, probably right. And then that
was it. And it just went away.

188
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:18,390
And I think like he's, he's
really, it's fascinating.

189
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,610
He's like exposing, uh, you
know, that, that, I don't know,

190
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:26,370
it's like that wizard of Oz thing
that there's just a little guy behind.

191
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,400
They just have the one question and
they're waiting for you to stammer.

192
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,980
And if youth kind of throw the,
hit the ball back in their court,

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,380
I just don't think they're ready for it.

194
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:37,880
I don't think they were ready for that
kind of a personality and politics that I

195
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:42,030
don't, but like some of the racist
people in Shit that you know,

196
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,550
that whatever the fuck was going
on in that conference room,

197
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,230
I'm not saying the black dude
was 100% in the right, you know,

198
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,550
and this guy went there and
started yelling some shit at Trump.

199
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,660
He heckled them and you know, when
did this happen? I don't know,

200
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,321
do you know about this?

201
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,590
Tammy and shit went sideways and
then there's the next thing you know,

202
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,520
there's a bunch of,
you know,

203
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:02,220
eight white people on top of
the black dude or whatever.

204
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:05,280
So I don't really try what happened.
I don't know what happened,

205
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:09,030
but all I know is the quote that
I read on this site was, you know,

206
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:12,240
was the politician guy. They had
Trump going like, well, you know,

207
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:15,970
maybe maybe should've got roughed up.
And it's just like, Jesus, dude, Geez,

208
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,710
is this sounds like I'm watching
a mob movie. It's really weird.

209
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,690
So Trump was saying maybe
the guy should've got rough.

210
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,960
I think too, like I said, I got add,
I was on like 20 different sites.

211
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,670
I think I have add too, but it was like
clickbait. Like I was probably, you know,

212
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,130
I dunno.

213
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,780
Here it is. Yeah. Donald Trump
on his black lives matter. Yeah.

214
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,110
Maybe he should have been roughed up,

215
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,560
but you know the black lives matter
movement, it's so strange. Oh they, they,

216
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,590
they interrupt shit and scream things
like you saw what happened in Dartmouth in

217
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:49,280
New Hampshire.

218
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,730
They walked through the study hall
while his kids were studying and I just

219
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:54,130
started screaming black
lives. Black lives. Oh,

220
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,060
everybody's quiet and study
hall just there studying.
There were no people. Yeah.

221
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:03,490
That's still lowest level of like
trying to get attention and not and,

222
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:07,040
and not having people want to hear
what the fuck you have to say.

223
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,020
Is it just going in and annoy
the shit out of somebody?

224
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:10,700
It's like those people
when they ride the bikes,

225
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:13,100
like a thousand of them get together
and they blow through lights.

226
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:16,010
Like that's going to be like,
you know what? There should
be a bike lane out here.

227
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,640
I just think, I wish I had a bus and
I could run over all of it. Right.

228
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,750
Which is why, uh, you know, I dunno,

229
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,070
I look at those terrorist acts like I
would think that if like a lot of the

230
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:31,920
complaints, legitimate complaints
that being oppressed, that their,

231
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:34,790
their natural resources are being pulled
out of their countries and they're not

232
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,290
getting the money for,

233
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,040
but to then blow up innocent
people go in and shoot them.

234
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,900
It kills you fucking message.

235
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,150
Do you really need is a documentary yet
by some bleeding heart person would,

236
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,080
I think would do way more than a dirty
bomb or whatever the fuck it is they're

237
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:53,660
trying to achieve because it
just makes you think like, uh,

238
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,530
no matter what that point is, it's just
like, yeah, but how could you do that?

239
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,230
Yeah. I think what their point
where they're trying to do,

240
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,880
if I had to guess is they're trying to
get people to not like any Muslims to

241
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:07,880
hate Muslims because there's
like 1.6 billion Muslims.

242
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,780
If they can make it about Muslims and
not just about isis or just about one

243
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:12,614
terrorist group.

244
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,890
And separate people to the point where
it's everyone has just attacking people

245
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:21,890
that are of Islamic faith,
right. Then they have a holy war.

246
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,420
I think that's ultimately, yeah.
And you can make a ton of fuck it.

247
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,430
There's a very few people can make a ton
of fucking money on us, a ton of money.

248
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:32,540
And they're also fucking crazy. I mean,
so it sounds, it's money, it's ideology.

249
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,580
They're trying to dominate
parts of the world. I mean,

250
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:35,890
money's definitely a big part of it.

251
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,700
Did you see that, that uh, that
documentary on Scientology? Yes. Yeah.

252
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:42,770
Amazing. Yeah. And I
watched and I was just like,

253
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:45,440
if you can't see your
own religion in this,

254
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:47,810
if you don't see the beginning
of your own religion in this,

255
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,360
the only thing that fucks
Scientology is this video of the two.

256
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,620
He just started it too late. If that
guy started it and like, I dunno,

257
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,170
18 hundreds, they'd still give him
shit cause it'd be a newer one.

258
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,380
But the fact that there wouldn't have
been video of this fucked up teeth looking

259
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:09,380
redheaded dude on some broken down boat.

260
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,180
Like if there wasn't video of
that, like I, I think people could,

261
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,950
could really see, I mean, dude,
my background, my religion,

262
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:20,870
I mean this shit that we have done is,
it just,

263
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:24,200
it's like everything that they're saying
that every Muslim is doing right now.

264
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,630
It's like, well, we've done
that in spades and it didn't,

265
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:32,650
it wasn't a couple of extremists
that was the leaders of the religion,

266
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,730
you know, Crusades, the inquisition,
the fucking pedophilia. It's dude,

267
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,340
they were in bed with the Nazis.
You know,

268
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:42,260
when Jews went to find
like where the hell it all,

269
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:46,160
I took my riding lawnmower or whatever.
They went up at the fucking Vatican.

270
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:50,930
Like some of this shit was there now.
Oh, is that what those yours, sorry.

271
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,050
Yeah, they were on both sides.
They were just like, listen,

272
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:56,810
I don't know how this is
going to shake out. You know,

273
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:59,390
a lot of people in Europe are like that.
They've always done that. You know,

274
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:02,270
there's, there's a damn cars
the chairman's make, you know,

275
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:07,190
you've got to think they're going to win.
It's just too small.

276
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:10,720
And Island is small country who was a
big country like the United States and

277
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:11,930
they made shit like that.
It'd be pretty,

278
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:16,931
one of my favorite quotes from a German
general was said one tiger tank was

279
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:21,470
worth four American Sherman tanks,
but the Americans always had five.

280
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,710
That's a great quote. That's what
it was. It was fucking Mcdonald's.

281
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:29,660
We were just cranking them
out like fucking quarter
pounders with chase and his

282
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:33,620
crazy. When you think about the
fact like Audi, Mercedes, BMW,

283
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,720
like BMW used to make jet engines,

284
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,020
they and that technology was in
that tank student when I was,

285
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,950
I mean this shit I've been reading
is like when American soldiers killed

286
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,380
somebody German, they dropped the American
gun and picked up the German Freeling.

287
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:51,620
Yeah, like are are machine guns I
guess overheated or there's, you know,

288
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,460
come on man, you like car nearing,
you know how it is. I mean we've got,

289
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:57,170
we've got the corvette,
we got a couple,

290
00:15:57,171 --> 00:16:00,250
but most of them are kind
of a Monte Carlo. Yeah,

291
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,600
we have like old muscle cars.

292
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:05,660
What I like is I like the old muscle
cars cause the way they look and the way

293
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:08,780
they sound, but the way they drive
could be if you took like a uh,

294
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:11,660
1980s Porsche or even a seven,

295
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:15,110
he's a good to look in 1973
Porsche like a 1973, nine 11.

296
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,010
These they handle pretty fucking good.
They're pretty God damn good.

297
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,490
I mean not like a new car but pretty good.
The American,

298
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:24,620
what the American excuses is,

299
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:27,470
we had all this land so we
could have straight roads.

300
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:29,240
What they had over there do,

301
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:33,050
those were like the original cow paths
when they will bring in fucking revisions

302
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:37,250
to town and then they just paved over
and basically and then all of a sudden,

303
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,170
how do we go 200 miles an hour on this?

304
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,320
That's why you know Formula One has
right and left turns Bestival do is just

305
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:46,910
drive in a circle over here.
I love it dude. I love that.

306
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,410
The more I travel, the funnier
we are. Like we're fucking loud.

307
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,050
We got a lot of shit but were not bad.

308
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,900
They try to make us seem like we're
bad but we're not. But it's just,

309
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,970
we just are a product of where we're
from. And who's kidding who man, it's,

310
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,510
is it any more fun than just stomping
on the gas and go down 200 miles an hour

311
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:06,290
to straight line?

312
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,290
Well finally the cars fly making today
like the new z 28 or the new Camaro's,

313
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:16,360
the new Corvettes, the new mustangs,
they actually hand the Cadillacs. Great.

314
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,160
So much of it was the
suspension once they,

315
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:24,020
we actually put some money cause all we
would do is just be like what the fuck

316
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:26,120
and this thing hold in this engine bay,

317
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,490
which automatically is stupid
cause you're adding weight there.

318
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:30,800
So but we would just
stick as far as I can.

319
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,020
I've seen if you would
just stick that in there.

320
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:35,480
And it was all about doing the quarter
mile or something that are blowing

321
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:38,510
somebody off at a fucking a red light.
Even as recently as the,

322
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:43,490
like the 2013 gt 500 Shelby, I think
it was like a 60, 40 weight balance,

323
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,730
like 60% front end cause
it was all engine. That is,

324
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:50,000
it's so out of balance now that's, that's
a bad cause. I don't know. I don't know.

325
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,910
Wow. It's like if you want
any room, if you want it,

326
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,590
you really would like 50,
50,

327
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:58,680
50 fifties ideal Porsche
puts the engine in the rear.

328
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,520
But they do that for traction because
the engine sits over the back wheels and

329
00:18:02,521 --> 00:18:05,700
it helps you get off the line faster and
it helps you when you're going around

330
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:08,700
corners to uh,
to hit corners faster.

331
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,440
Jamie can make some tape or the fuck
is going on with my throat. But uh,

332
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:15,300
when you want,
when you go around corners,

333
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,510
it helps you get on the gas quicker
because there's more traction. Oh.

334
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,420
And there's like a pendulum effect too
with having to wait in the back that you

335
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:22,830
could actually use and manipulate.

336
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,720
The guys who know how to
drive Porsche's really well.

337
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,410
They know how to manipulate that so
they actually steer with the throttle.

338
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,640
So as they're turning,

339
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,690
they hit the gas and the ass end kicks
out and it changes the angle of the turn.

340
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,350
That was a really, really bad ass
drivers know how to manipulate it.

341
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,080
So once again, thank God Germany
was such a small country. Right.

342
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,820
Did you see that normally tunnel joke?
No, I think it did it on Letterman.

343
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,340
I forget how it went, but it was just
something to the effect that Germany,

344
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,390
how small they were like
they were basically the size
of the state of Maine and

345
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:57,990
they tried to take over the world
and he goes and they almost did it.

346
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,860
It's fucking like, yeah, they all clothes.

347
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,460
It is amazing that one country
produced so much engineering.

348
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,370
When you look at the
automotive engineering that
came out of that one spot to

349
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:12,600
this day, the biggest car companies
in the world, Porsche, Mercedes, Audi,

350
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,450
BMW, all those are German.
That's, that's, that's phenomenal.

351
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:18,840
We rated their secrets afterwards,

352
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,490
like everything from audio taped to
are like NASA program was riddled.

353
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,690
Operation Paper clouded a
lot of Sauerkraut on that
paper. Well, not just ours.

354
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,040
The the Russians too. They took a lot of
the engineers from, from Nazi Germany to,

355
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,130
Oh, they did? Yeah. Yeah. There
was like a battle between there.

356
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,690
They're Nazis and are Nazis and
that's the operation paperclip.

357
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,730
There was like more than a hundred
Nazi scientists. They took over.

358
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,680
It's fucking crazy. The whole Nazi,
like Werner von Verner von Braun,

359
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:48,030
the guy who ran,
not NASA,

360
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,760
the Simon Wiesenthal Center
said that if he was alive today,

361
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,310
they would prosecute him
for crimes against humanity.

362
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,390
He was a fucking straight up Nazi.
Oh, he was? Yeah. He Hung Jews.

363
00:19:57,391 --> 00:20:01,170
He hung the five slow as Jews in
front of his rocket factory in Berlin.

364
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,740
The five slowest workers. They
would just hang them. No wait.

365
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,710
So this guy was could build rockets and
he was also into that shit because I

366
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,440
always felt like what Germany
was like, yeah, the scientist,

367
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,970
you're under this flag,

368
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:17,310
so you got to work with these
guys who were going to kill you.

369
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,210
I didn't know that you could actually be
an egg head light. Usually scientists,

370
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:25,170
they understand that human beings are
human. You know what I mean? Well,

371
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:29,580
he might've just complied so that he could
get his rocket factory going and have

372
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:34,380
the funds and have all the necessary,
have all the tools and all that jazz.

373
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:39,360
I don't know exactly. You know how
he, how he did it, but he was a Nazi.

374
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,160
I mean, well, why he was a
Nazi is up to debase Christ.

375
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,070
How do you get out of that? It's a good
question. You can't say no. You got to

376
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,920
run away. Well, they can come. Can
we just do for is four cool. Cool.

377
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,790
Just talk him down.

378
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,550
Just one moneywise enough.
Oh Man. Yeah. He's a,

379
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,430
I mean,
obviously he was a brilliant scientist,

380
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,750
but they got a on a lot of brilliant
scientists they brought over from Germany

381
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,630
and Germany's never going
to shake that one off.

382
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,840
That's what going to be, that's going
to be, that's another one. It's on,

383
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,580
it's on like, uh, two things.
It's, it's on video, you know,

384
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:23,020
video documentation of it and uh,
and that country still exists.

385
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,310
You know what I mean? Scientology,
they won't let Scientology.

386
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,760
It's illegal in Germany. Why? Because
of what happened to them. Like they're,

387
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:33,000
they're nervous about
people starting movements.

388
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,350
So any kind of cults and he'd
kind of mind control shit.

389
00:21:37,351 --> 00:21:42,000
Anything that looks nutty, they're like
not here foul. Not here. No data is,

390
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,680
are people falling. Dave Matthews I think
judge it too much. Organization, fish

391
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,780
vision was one that I never got.
Did you ever try to listen to that?

392
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,810
Uh, yeah I did. I just, I,

393
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,440
I had young ears when I did so I'd
have to go back and let's do it.

394
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:00,060
Like I was coming right out of hair metal,

395
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:03,840
just starting to accept grunge and
then I went to this fucking jam band.

396
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:08,460
I did see them, uh, alive. Uh,
how to fuck that. I ended up, see,

397
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:11,040
I saw them at the old
Boston garden cause it was,

398
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,880
it was a WBCN had this thing where they
had two stages going and they just had

399
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:18,960
all these like every fucking band,

400
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:23,100
like the spin doctors and just all of
these guys. And then fish closed that,

401
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,220
I forget who I wanted to see though.
It wasn't either one of those bands.

402
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,470
It was somebody else.
It was a long fucking time ago.

403
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:33,420
And I remember seeing them in the crowd
was going fucking nuts and they had

404
00:22:33,421 --> 00:22:35,400
these little tramp, you
know, workout trampolines.

405
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,250
They were like jumping up and
down on them as they played

406
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,290
really long songs. That's what I
remember. Really long songs on it.

407
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:48,150
But I bet if I listen to him now, I would,
I could, uh, maybe get my head around it.

408
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:49,110
But that was definitely,

409
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,030
that's the graceful, the grateful
dead did that too. Right.

410
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,190
And those really long jam songs,
they just go on and on.

411
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,160
Yeah. Yeah. You had to go
see them live to get it.

412
00:22:58,161 --> 00:23:02,530
If you were someone like I went and I saw
him at Sullivan Stadium and uh, asylum,

413
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,470
I'm right before they
keyboardist. Oh deed. Like
literally two months before that.

414
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:08,660
And I remember going there and
I was sorta into the music,

415
00:23:08,661 --> 00:23:11,870
but watching how in how much they
were connecting with the people there.

416
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,730
I actually, it's like, I get this.

417
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,270
I get why people could get sucked into
this because what was cool was there was

418
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,051
a ton of people there,

419
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:22,820
but there was no violent
violence vibe there.

420
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,000
There wasn't like, oh,
hey, watch out for that.

421
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,870
Everybody was just really fucking cool
and going nuts and was like beyond

422
00:23:29,871 --> 00:23:32,360
excited that they were there, but
once again, it just, it didn't,

423
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,650
wasn't really for me.

424
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,320
What was it?
Everybody on acid isn't.

425
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:37,270
That's the whole thing about those
things that everybody is tripping. Yeah.

426
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,100
I mean I think it's available.
I don't think literally everybody,

427
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:43,250
but there's a lot of people. Yeah. Boy,
whatever drugs they were doing, I mean,

428
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:43,750
I don't know.

429
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,060
Doesn't that followed them around?
When I was out of high school,

430
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,360
I guess she went to college for a little
bit and then her and her boyfriend just

431
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,390
traveled around the hit a VW bus on
those buses in a little vans and add the

432
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,500
back of the van.
They would sell scrambled eggs.

433
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,760
They would like buy groceries and make
bacon and eggs and sell them to people

434
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,780
that were coming in. That was
like her did. That was her gig

435
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,560
travel around the country
because there's a night,

436
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,160
there's a beauty in that simplicity. But
I think after a while you want to, uh,

437
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,530
like dude,
I got take

438
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,190
shower. I just want to be,
they want to be in a house man.

439
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,530
He keep swimming in the lake.

440
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,440
I was sleeping up in that fucking
though the roof of the uh,

441
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,370
the VW camper specials.
Um,

442
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,990
I'm fascinated by those things cause
I'm thinking about putting together an

443
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:30,680
apocalypse vehicle, like a, um,

444
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,750
like a Toyota Land Cruiser that
has one of those tents on the roof.

445
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,560
You ever seen those things? They
have these tents. They uh, they,

446
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,480
they packed down to just a few
inches. They're like, you know,

447
00:24:39,481 --> 00:24:43,860
six or seven inches high, like not even
maybe, maybe six inches high. And uh,

448
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,240
they, you unzip him and then unfold
them and they come with a ladder.

449
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,830
So there's a platform on the top and the
platform folds over and doubles out and

450
00:24:52,831 --> 00:24:57,480
extends out to the side of the truck and
then you climb up the ladder into these

451
00:24:57,481 --> 00:24:58,314
tents.

452
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,090
I would tell you that if you,

453
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:03,980
if the apocalypse
happens and you're in La,

454
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,970
you're vehicle is useless other than to
hide behind when people shoot at you.

455
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,750
Because you know, you can't get out of
this fucking place even when it's working.

456
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,360
Yeah. You got to get it. So that's
why I did the helicopter thing.

457
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,750
That's a smart move, man.
That's another thing you do.

458
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,870
Like you're involved with
so many different things.

459
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,070
I love that you do that because it
reminds me of me and a lot of way,

460
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:27,380
and that's one of the reasons why
I think I probably have add too.

461
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,890
I have to be doing a bunch of different
shit. If I'm not, I kind of get it off.

462
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,700
I kind of get crazy, but I haven't gotten
to the point where I'm baking pies yet.

463
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,200
Well, you know, the holidays were
awesome when I was growing up,

464
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:43,670
so I moved so far away from
everybody. I know that, uh, you know,

465
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,060
I just got all the recipes, so I was
like, I want to know how to make this,

466
00:25:47,061 --> 00:25:49,820
I want to know how to pass it on.
It's not hard to, filling isn't hard.

467
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,210
The thing is, is the crust. You've got
to get that down and just, you know,

468
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:57,260
you make two, three of them, you
know, it doesn't take that long. Dude.

469
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,670
I'm not a bright guy.
I'm

470
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:03,030
smoking. I've done some smoking.
I smoked the ham, smoked two hams.

471
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,030
I brine them.
Did you do it on the the egg?

472
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,660
I did one of them know both of them
have done it. Electric smokers,

473
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,740
but one of them I did on this, this,
I think it's a Webber. I forgot.

474
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,460
Forgot who makes it. But
uh, the last one that I did,

475
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,200
I don't want you to do that. I
just a Boston accent. I just like,

476
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,810
I have to do whatever. The last
one I did, I got a pellet grill.

477
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,990
Have you ever used a pellet grill?
No. That's the easiest way to spoke.

478
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,840
What it is is that they use
pellets and the pellets are like,

479
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:33,300
say if you were making
this desk when you saw the,

480
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:37,230
would they take the saw dust and they
compress it and the natural sugars in the

481
00:26:37,231 --> 00:26:38,100
wood,
there's no additives.

482
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,980
You know they get those charcoal
briquettes and they light really easy.

483
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,010
It's because they're fucking soaked
with chemicals. They smell funny.

484
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:48,480
It's a flavor cancer coming
right up on down to get Parker.

485
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,140
But those saw does pellets.
When they compress the saw dust,

486
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:57,250
it looks like little little cylinders
and they sit in a hopper and then the

487
00:26:57,301 --> 00:27:02,130
hopper feeds down into this worm drive
and the worm drive puts it into an

488
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:05,280
element and the element heats
it up and it turns into fire.

489
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,170
And then it's so it's burning wood,

490
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,220
it's just burning wood and it keeps it
at the exact temperature just varies one

491
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:14,070
or two degrees up or down. So you know,
like if you're using the green egg,

492
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,630
how would adjust the openings?

493
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:19,920
The baffles you have about how is the
f the green egg holds its temperature

494
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:23,850
tremendously. That does. But if now,

495
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,790
how's the tastes delicious?
It tastes awesome because it's just,

496
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:30,240
what finding is it? Is it
comparable to some, cause you've,

497
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:34,810
you've said that you can do it in
everything but an actual smoker. Yeah, no,

498
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,090
I've done it.
I've done it.

499
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:39,500
And I have a Kamado which is real
similar to the green egg and I,

500
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:43,380
I never smoked a ham in there, but I've
smoked chicken in there, which is nice.

501
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,180
It tastes great, you know, just slow
cook a chicken like you know, 200,

502
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,680
200 degrees to 50 and just, you
know, have some wood burning,

503
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,750
a little charcoal as well. But um, I just
realized this only interesting to us.

504
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:58,440
Like we're fucking disappearing down this
rabbit hole and then what do you know?

505
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,610
I, I'm interested in things that
people are interested in like go,

506
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:05,160
I hear you talk about helicopter
being a helicopter pilot.

507
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,910
I've never wanted to fucking
fly helicopter until I
hear you talking about it.

508
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,440
I'm like, oh, that sounds bad ass.

509
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:14,300
I never wanted to make a buck and pie
crust until I hear someone like you who's

510
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,020
into it.
And then I get into it.

511
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,980
I mean that's how I am with things like
the comics. I like that though. Yeah.

512
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,340
You have to be kind of gender.
I think the best comic you got to be,

513
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,840
if you have to have a general interest in
shit, they can't be like, I'm into this,

514
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:29,340
this and this.
And then that's fucking it.

515
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,470
And then you're asking to look like that.
You're going to have like two,

516
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:34,950
three fucking subjects. You're
going to dry up. Like, Hey,

517
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:37,740
I can't come up with a new hour. It's
like, cause you're not, you're not,

518
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,430
you're not challenging yourself.
You got to go out and try something new.

519
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:43,650
We try something new.
You're gonna fuck it up.

520
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,040
You're gonna feel stupid and then you,

521
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:49,110
you're going to get a story or you're
going to get something out of it. So, uh,

522
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,470
yeah, my, I drive my wife
a little nuts with the,

523
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,660
I'm trying to learn how to
fucking relax a little bit more,

524
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:59,580
but I can't like a dude. She watches
that Bravo TV man. Oh my God.

525
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,900
That's like housewives, Kardashians, the
whole fucking thing. Dude. And I smart.

526
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:06,450
Why does she watch that?
I literally say that to her.

527
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,640
No, but she, she was like this, this is,

528
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,130
my wife either watches this
sickest shit ever on TV. Like,

529
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:21,240
who, who's that scientist guy? The AF
African American guy. Neil degrasse Tyson.

530
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:25,800
My God. Yeah. Dude, that guy is like
terrifying. He's so fucking smart.

531
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:27,580
Just listen to the shit that he,
yeah,

532
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,320
that was watching that day now and I
believe we all came from the trees.

533
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,560
It's crazy, right? What do you mean
you believe what he was saying?

534
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:37,010
That like if people were saying we
came from the oceans and blah blah,

535
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,150
he had this whole theory
that, you know, the, the uh,

536
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:42,100
whatever the fucking trees grew first and
we came out of that and we're all part

537
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,550
I do and they're doing all the special
effects and then he fucking zooms in on

538
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:49,210
you. It's like one of the states
where I feel like, um, yeah,

539
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,840
like I ate a pot cookie too big
apart cookie when I watched that guy.

540
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:55,870
But she'll either watch that
type of stuff or like Fargo,

541
00:29:55,871 --> 00:30:00,610
like really good TV or
she, she, she just wants,

542
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:04,660
just wants to veg out, sell how I
make my peace with it, I'm like,

543
00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:09,661
this is just as dumb is me watching
every Bruins game or every patriots game.

544
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,420
That's good. Getting like
emotionally like, like,

545
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,800
like hating Rex Ryan on some level.
He's a coach of the buffalo bills.

546
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:18,730
I don't know the guy.

547
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,370
I'm sure if I hung out with them
he'd be a fucking great guy.

548
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:22,600
We'd be laughing our balls off,

549
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:27,490
but it's because he coaches this fucking
team that plays my team that I get

550
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:31,240
nothing from other than, you know,
fucking having a heart attack every game.

551
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:34,210
Like that's, it's really to take,
why do I give a shit to this level?

552
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,760
I do love sports so I
just think it's fucking

553
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:41,050
Badass. I listen to podcasts. You fucking
love sports. You go off sometimes.

554
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:42,700
I can't let,
I have to fast forward.

555
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:44,740
See when you're done talking
about the patriots. I know,

556
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,160
but sometimes that'll be 15 minutes,
but I get it because I, you know,

557
00:30:50,161 --> 00:30:54,830
I've obviously obsessed with MMA so I
get it. I just don't follow regular.

558
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,120
I just don't have enough time.
I just know that if I got into sports,

559
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,210
like if I got into football and I had a
buddy of mine and tried to get me into

560
00:31:01,211 --> 00:31:04,000
football, we watched a an awesome super
bowl game once and I was like, wow,

561
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:04,834
it was amazing.

562
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,810
I don't know at the time I don't have
the time to allow all the games and pay

563
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:08,644
attention,
all the shit.

564
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:11,600
That's what I always ask people when they
go, I'm not into sport. I'm like, Jesus,

565
00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:13,160
I go,
what do you do with all your free time?

566
00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:17,510
Because the amount of time that I spend,
um,

567
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,510
you know, just looking at the
standings, seeing who's doing what when,

568
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:23,120
then it makes me think
back when I was a kid,

569
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:27,050
I got to look up this player and
then I got to see like a all time.

570
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,940
I'm big on numbers and shit.

571
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,420
I love that about the Internet that you
can look up like the all time leading

572
00:31:32,421 --> 00:31:36,410
pass rushers are our
quarterbacks or something and
then they'll have highlighted

573
00:31:36,411 --> 00:31:38,390
the guys who was still
playing and he's like,

574
00:31:38,391 --> 00:31:40,460
oh this guy's like a hundred
yards away from passing this guy.

575
00:31:40,461 --> 00:31:42,170
Let me watch the game and
see if they bring it up.

576
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,000
But he just passed fucking slinging
Sammy Blah. Have you ever shown it

577
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,520
about doing commentary? Would you
do commentary of like the, I mean,

578
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:50,810
you know a lot about football.

579
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,010
I would do it on my own.
I would do it on my own,

580
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:57,690
but because the thing about
it is, is uh, you know,

581
00:31:57,691 --> 00:31:59,310
once you like, that's a, it's a,

582
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,090
it's a corporation as much as you're
enjoying the sport and like the NBA,

583
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:07,620
Nfl Nhl is a corporation
and then you, you, no matter
how you slice it, you're in,

584
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:09,990
you're in the cubicle.
And I can't be,

585
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:12,660
I can't be saying certain things.

586
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,250
I have that same problem with the UFC,
but I've been around for so long,

587
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,330
I kind of get away with it in some sort
of a weird way, but probably not forever.

588
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,340
It's probably going to come
a point in time though,

589
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,410
but you don't say anything crazy,
but not during the show night.

590
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,290
Not during the fights,

591
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,300
but sometimes outside the fights I'll
talk about fighters are fights things and

592
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:37,980
I'll say something ridiculous because
you know, especially like Tony,

593
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,150
Tony Hinchcliffe and I got in trouble
recently because we were talking about

594
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:44,020
this woman cris Cyborg, do you know
Chris side mortgages now? Grace,

595
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,590
great name though. Very masculine,
very muscular, a female fighter,

596
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,700
excellent fighter. But she's been caught
using performance enhancing drugs.

597
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,550
She got caught using male hormones and uh,

598
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,300
Dana White was talking about
roasting fighters were on my podcast.

599
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,510
He wanted to set up a roast and I said,
look, Tony Hinchcliffe is the guy,

600
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,900
he's awesome at Ross. I go, I don't,
I'm not good at it. It's not my thing.

601
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,110
But he's great at it. I go, you
should, you should row cyborg.

602
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,840
That would be the first one. And he
goes, I don't know where to start.

603
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:14,420
I go her dick.
Like that's where you would start.

604
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,430
And then Tony went into
this whole thing about,

605
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:20,750
and then she got mad and she's upset at
us now and she says, we're bullying and

606
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:26,970
see it's a problem. [inaudible]
you're a Philly. Yeah, exactly.

607
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,760
Also know him and the people and stuff.
That's another thing too. It's like,

608
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,490
you know,
one of the fun things in the podcast is,

609
00:33:32,491 --> 00:33:35,670
I don't know any of these gangs.
I don't get paid by these guys.

610
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,860
You're Conor Mcgregor rant.
That was awesome.

611
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,970
That guy,
he earned coming out.

612
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,450
I know he fucking dropped his hands a
little bit by just felt like, you know,

613
00:33:48,451 --> 00:33:50,610
he was doing all right for a
guy that had the short thing.

614
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:54,190
And I'm not shitting on Conor Mcgregor.
The guy's obviously a great fighter.

615
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,770
It's funny though.
It's funny,

616
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,690
I said the Burger King look at guys came
out and attacked Barney rubble. Yeah.

617
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,370
No, but there's something funny
about that. Like on uninformed yeah.

618
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:09,480
Sort of thing. So like ideas, his whole
thing. He always gets the names wrong.

619
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:14,530
Yeah. Yeah. I got into this business
to not have a job I don't want to have,

620
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:16,770
and I've, I've done, I've done one gig.

621
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,740
We're actually wrote for a
fucking, like a, uh, like a, uh,

622
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,920
a comedian that was going to go out
and do the monologue fucking thing.

623
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,840
Oh really? And it was just fucking, it
was weird. It would just be like, okay, a,

624
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:34,050
the monologue is a little weak here. We
need more jokes about corn. Hey Bill,

625
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:38,190
go in the room and right gimme 10 jokes
about like whatever about fucking how

626
00:34:38,191 --> 00:34:43,100
long ago was this? Five, six
years ago. Who we run four.
Do you remember I named it,

627
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:45,390
I am going to name names
but I just got into this,

628
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,640
that was waiting for somebody very funny.
Uh,

629
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:50,490
I did it like two years in a
row and it just became like a,

630
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,460
like a job they have,
what am I doing here?

631
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,730
And I have like a tremendous amount of
respect for writers now that they can,

632
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,750
uh,
I mean that is like,

633
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:06,830
I remember long time ago when Mr Show
was on the first time seeing Bob Logan

634
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,760
Kirk on stage and he was like,

635
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:12,270
towards the end of like the fifth season
or whatever they did and he was coming

636
00:35:12,271 --> 00:35:16,620
in just fried from the writer's room
and he was riffing about how he goes,

637
00:35:16,621 --> 00:35:20,580
you know what I do during the
day? He goes, I, I mind comedy.

638
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,830
I strip mine. You can just feel like he
was just like, just sitting there like,

639
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:29,520
you know those fucking shows through when
you start getting like 70 episodes and

640
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:31,320
you're like, fuck, now what do we do?

641
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:35,120
And you just sitting around
trying to think of something. Um,

642
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,970
don't you feel like that would
stand up sometimes? Like, cause

643
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,040
you, would you put out a new
hour every year and a half or so?

644
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,040
Every two years I'll be two
years maybe a little bit more.

645
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:48,630
Like I do it in a nice relaxed clip.
Like a,

646
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,510
what Louis does is astounding
to me that you could,

647
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,660
you could just go back when
you know Richard Pryor.

648
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,480
Richard Pryor did that for a number of
years. Like he put out like an hour,

649
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,650
like four hours out in six
years or something. And did
it every year of his life.

650
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,500
Every year of his life. He put out
a new hour. I mean it was, yeah,

651
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,660
that's astounding to me.
Louise. The craziest,

652
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:10,230
because he did it while he's producing a
show. Writing, acting, directing. Yeah.

653
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:14,430
And on a high quality, one of the funny
shows on fucking, he was editing it.

654
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,700
He was involved every
step of the way. No, I,

655
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,470
I would have a gun in my mouth with that.
I don't,

656
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,380
I could never sit in a fucking editing
room. I can't do it. So with uh,

657
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,540
the show,
you know that I have coming out,

658
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:32,220
like I actually was in the writer's
room most probably 90% of the time.

659
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:36,480
I just sat there pitching jokes and all
that type of stuff and like the work

660
00:36:36,481 --> 00:36:37,860
ethic of those guys.

661
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,730
Like we'd start getting up to five
o'clock and we get to the last page of the

662
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:44,490
script and I'd be a cough. Thank
Christ in the guy. All right, let's go.

663
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:47,550
Let's just read through it one more time
to see what we did, see how it flows.

664
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:52,110
And I would literally be like, no show.
Yeah, I'm just looking. I'm like, God,

665
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:55,920
how do these guys do this? And then
I would fucking come in the next day.

666
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:59,000
And then the got the co creator of the
show Mike Price from the Simpsons who's

667
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,830
just an absolute force and
he's a sweetheart of a guy. Um,

668
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,030
would come in and be like, yeah, you know,

669
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:08,550
I was looking at the script last night
and I kind of switched a few things

670
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:11,340
around. It was just like, I would
leave to be like, how do you do that?

671
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:15,660
Like I come home and I just fucking poor
a scotch and I stare at the on the wall

672
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,740
and watch little ESPN and I fall asleep
and then we're right back at it again.

673
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,130
And I'm like, I, it really takes a
certain type, like, you know, you know,

674
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,290
this guy's a comedian are, you
know, this guy's an athlete,

675
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:33,350
like to the top level writers
and show runners like a Mike.

676
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,390
Yeah, Mike Price. Like they literally,
it's like you look at the guy,

677
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:41,330
it's like you had, you're
born to do this shit. So, um,

678
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,400
it's a lot harder than people think it is.
It's a lot more work,

679
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:48,510
a lot more concentration, a lot more
effort. And like you said, the hours,

680
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,720
the hours, that crazy thing. Those
guys work insane hours. Uh, when,

681
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,590
when you get it done and it doesn't work
and you got to start pulling it apart,

682
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,540
just like everybody's suing. Everybody
is like on edge. I got half. Fuck,

683
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:03,870
here we go. When you were done,
what? We were done filming,

684
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:06,750
you came to the store and you were hanging
out in the back and we were talking

685
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,780
about it and you were like, I feel
like, you know, I love doing it.

686
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:13,460
It's going to be hilarious, but fuck,
I could have been working on, you know,

687
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,890
I could've had 10 new minutes over
the time of that doing this. Yeah. Oh,

688
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:18,810
I don't know. That wasn't,
that was a different thing.

689
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,500
That was a different project.
It was, yeah. No, it wasn't the,

690
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,330
it wasn't a cartoon. No, it
wasn't the animated thing.
Now the animated thing was,

691
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:31,650
was definitely a like from
start to finish. I mean,

692
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:34,410
it took us a long time and it was
definitely tedious points of it,

693
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:35,370
but it was fucking awesome.

694
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:39,310
When we were in the writer's room is as
difficult as it was was we laughed our

695
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:42,430
asses off like every fucking hour
because it was, it was perfect.

696
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:47,140
Netflix was just like, like their network
notes were push it further. Really?

697
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,780
Oh Dude. It was a dream. It was all
this shit we used to talk about.

698
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,180
I read mentioned named Michelle.
The name is shows F is for family.

699
00:38:52,181 --> 00:38:56,500
It's a new cartoon coming up
December 18th on Netflix and I'm,

700
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,110
the trailer looks awesome. Let's play the
trailer. Can we play the trailer? We can,

701
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,060
can we, they're not going to be second
o is that flex isn't gonna Pause? Well,

702
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:08,190
is that kind of work as far as uh,
that don't they need the visual too?

703
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,250
Well, the people watched on
Youtube. We'll get the visual,

704
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,690
which is a lot of people,

705
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:15,780
but the people that are watching
or listening to it only listening,

706
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,430
they will be inspired to go watch
the video. Oh, all right. Okay.

707
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,293
Now that they know

708
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,600
it can drive, but what I have to, I
drank White House Bear White House,

709
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:29,480
bear the one draft.
You won't want to dodge.

710
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,630
I was watching that now you
weren't and now you're not.

711
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,170
Can I hold down the fort while I'm gone?

712
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:39,290
You just kind of leave me alone with
these animals. You leave them with me,

713
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,160
but that's our deal.

714
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,960
You know where you are getting into
when you let me get in. See you

715
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,540
catch. Don't bother your mom today. Just
busy with the little hobby. It's a job.

716
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:53,970
Yes, fine. The job. I'll make dinner.
Salisbury steak or a pork medley.

717
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,150
Not that shit again. What
was that? Yummy. Hey,

718
00:39:58,151 --> 00:40:01,120
grab me a cold one out of the cooler.
Tear up a little man. Hold the wheel.

719
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,900
I wish I had me for a debt.
I'll be right back. Stay here.

720
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,510
You're not moving your asked him the
spot. You understand me, Einstein.

721
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,420
Fuck you.

722
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:21,260
Remember the test? You Tub.
Are you an abusive parents?

723
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,050
Do you know what these fucking hippies.
Hi Sarah.

724
00:40:24,051 --> 00:40:26,180
Running around naked soil each other.

725
00:40:26,181 --> 00:40:28,850
You're going to tell me how to
be a good parrot. Jesus Christ.

726
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:32,000
Once you put your God damn clothes on,
frank focus.

727
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,830
No son of mine, he's going to flunk
out. I hate school. I hate my life,

728
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,970
but I keep on doing it.

729
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:55,940
There's no girl astronauts are vampires.
Women astronauts in the future, sweetie.

730
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,500
So why do you lie to the girl?

731
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,770
You two know each other.
He was my special afterschool helper.

732
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,620
Remember how we clean the kitchen?

733
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,010
Yeah,
you fuck the shit out of him?

734
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,670
You went charging your sister
today. You got that? Yup. Okay.

735
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,110
Anything bad happens to her?

736
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:18,240
I will come right home and
I'll put you through that.

737
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,160
Good.
Well have a great day princess.

738
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,810
It's weird. Yeah. Weird

739
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:31,560
seeing a guy like a character
with your voice. Oh, it's weird.

740
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,140
It's like it's you,
but it's

741
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,070
supposed to be your dad.
Is that supposed to be your dog?

742
00:41:36,071 --> 00:41:39,750
It's an amalgam of like everybody's dads
in the, uh, in the writer's room. I mean,

743
00:41:39,751 --> 00:41:40,640
certain things,

744
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,820
certain like catch phrases like I'll
put you through that fucking wall.

745
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:46,940
My Dad used to say that, man, my mom used
to say, I'll break your fucking legs.

746
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,550
Yeah.
Push through the fucking lawyer hat.

747
00:41:48,551 --> 00:41:52,310
It was back then where you let people
talk to the kids that were like,

748
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,900
just how much shit has changed.

749
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:58,901
I remember one time my mother was driving
and my two little brothers were just

750
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,270
acting up and she goes, she just had
had it. She goes, I swear to God,

751
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:03,230
if you guys don't shut up,

752
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:06,440
I'm going to pull over and I'm spanking
your bare ass is right on the side of

753
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:10,550
the road. And they kept testing. Dude,
she fucking pulled over and she did it.

754
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,320
And people were driving by just blowing
the horns, laughing. Thought it was funny.

755
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,600
They just like, they were
immediately like, wow,

756
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:20,600
those kids really irritated their
mom. It wasn't like, you know,

757
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:24,950
there wasn't cell phones. Take the kids
away and give them to the state and shit.

758
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:28,850
So yeah, it takes place in like 1973
and now let me read some of the names.

759
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:33,800
And so Lord Dorrance, uh, plays my wife,
uh, Dave characters in it. Justin Long,

760
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,300
Kevin Farley, Joe Buck fill,
Henry Haley, Reinhart, Mo Collins,

761
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:41,180
Sam Rockwell, Gary cold.
And I say him, we got all,

762
00:42:41,181 --> 00:42:44,450
we've got a whole bunch of people
that came on, uh, to do it.

763
00:42:44,451 --> 00:42:48,530
So what's cool is it's serialized. So
like one episode leads into the next one,

764
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,680
which I was against. And Netflix is
like, no, I'm trust us, trust us.

765
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:55,610
And then the second we started
writing towards an overall arc,

766
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,760
it just took it to a whole nother level.
And I was,

767
00:42:57,761 --> 00:43:00,230
it was not a brilliant idea by Netflix.

768
00:43:00,231 --> 00:43:04,070
They just been awesome to work with
and um, they're fucking killing it.

769
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,860
They are just killing it.
They're killing it with comedy specials.

770
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,870
They're killing it with series.
This is like,

771
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:13,040
it's amazing what they've been able
to do. Well, I think that they, uh,

772
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,540
where everybody kinda got
caught flat footed, they saw,

773
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,500
they saw like what it, what it could
be. It'd be like Damon, like Mike,

774
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,450
my space first came out like he saw
the potential before everybody else.

775
00:43:26,451 --> 00:43:28,610
I feel like he just, he
just got it. I think he was,

776
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,460
he was actually doing shit
on other sites before.

777
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:33,110
There was even my space from what I heard.

778
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:36,200
So like I feel like Netflix
and a lot of ways like a,

779
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,440
those people that get like I,
they'd say Jimmy Fallon,

780
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,810
Jimmy Fallon gets what's going on line
and that's why all that stuff he has his

781
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:47,900
guests do and all that shit cause
he knows it's going to go viral.

782
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:52,100
So he gets him on TV and if he doesn't
get them on TV then it goes on the

783
00:43:52,101 --> 00:43:55,700
Internet and they, all of his clips
get like fucking like, you know,

784
00:43:55,701 --> 00:44:00,550
10 zillion hits. But like there's
certain people is early on as,

785
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:03,080
as we're, you know, you know
the TV and the computer,

786
00:44:03,081 --> 00:44:06,830
we're all just going to become the same
fucking thing. It's inevitable now. Yeah.

787
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:11,060
But so it's the people that Kinda
like get it.

788
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,240
I guess I was the only way I can put
it, they just, they can see where it's,

789
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:17,450
where the herd is going.
They took chances a long time ago too.

790
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:21,060
I did a Netflix special
in 2005 those are the,

791
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,640
like there was one of the first ones they
did. I would think so. Like I didn't,

792
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,210
I didn't even hear it. Like I, that's
back when they used to deliver the,

793
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:30,350
the movies to you, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You would,

794
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,100
you'd get them in the mail
or something like that.

795
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,700
Yeah. Hilarious. They, they're,
they're doing so much shit now.

796
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:39,150
They have that Marco Polo thing.
That's about the Mongols.

797
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:43,100
You ever watch that series? I didn't
see that fucking expensive. I don't,

798
00:44:43,101 --> 00:44:46,080
I don't know how much they spend on it,
but it's a period piece and it's all,

799
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:50,160
they do these elaborate sets
and incredible fucking acting.

800
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,080
It's the Dave d they've done so much.

801
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:55,260
And the beautiful thing about
Netflix is when a series comes out,

802
00:44:55,261 --> 00:44:59,610
you can binge watch right away. So
December 8th when this come, 1818 teeth,

803
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,610
December 18th when this comes out, you
can watch the whole fucking series. Right.

804
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,210
And they timed it cause they think young
kids are gonna like it. They're like,

805
00:45:05,211 --> 00:45:07,390
well, well let's wait till
they're out of college. Yeah.

806
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,130
Went to the home a few days at
parents would drive them nuts.

807
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,780
They just want to go to the room down
and watch something that yeah, yeah. No,

808
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:17,040
it's really, uh, they're
really smart. And then, um,

809
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:21,950
I think the first one I did with them
was my first special and I remember it

810
00:45:21,951 --> 00:45:26,720
aired on like comedy central and
date. Okay. And then, you know,

811
00:45:26,721 --> 00:45:28,880
it gets thrown into their
mountain of specials.

812
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:31,730
You never know when they're going to
show it again. Yeah. We're in Netflix.

813
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,170
It was like on Netflix,

814
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,700
so if you saw it you could tell your
friend at work and then it was just like,

815
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:41,270
you know, I just saw them,
I was like, wow, these guys,

816
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:44,780
it's like almost like they've,
they've taken the best shit from Youtube,

817
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:47,050
put it all in one place,
you know what I mean?

818
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:50,030
But you can actually watch it cause they
take down so many movies and shit and

819
00:45:50,031 --> 00:45:53,180
comedy specials from Youtube.
And um,

820
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,300
what was great was that was right then
when I was starting to go to Europe and

821
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:57,500
they were just starting to go to Europe.

822
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,560
So I was like half a step ahead as
far as my were initially where I was,

823
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,190
where I would do stand up.
It always felt like right after I left,

824
00:46:07,191 --> 00:46:10,940
the next time I came they would be
there and then like two years later it,

825
00:46:10,941 --> 00:46:15,170
it flipped where I would be getting
there right after they got there.

826
00:46:15,171 --> 00:46:18,590
And then that's when my ticket sales
really started going up when I was,

827
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:23,510
when I went overseas was because
Netflix, this, this show, you know,

828
00:46:23,511 --> 00:46:24,710
when we were finishing them,

829
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,340
they were dubbing them into like
a zillion different languages.

830
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:33,110
Like there's a clip of it all in
Russian already fucking nuts. So,

831
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,110
so as you see a big bump when
you did do Netflix special,

832
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,820
a big bump in ticket sales.

833
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,810
Yeah, I definitely did. And
the thing about it is, is it,

834
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,030
but like most things,

835
00:46:43,031 --> 00:46:46,230
it's like you just don't get on Netflix
and then that automatically means that's

836
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,390
going to happen. It's, it's the
combination. If it's like a view,

837
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,650
deliver an hour that's going to connect,
um,

838
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,760
with people that watch Netflix,

839
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,870
it's going to be on there and then it's
going to start moving up and get to that

840
00:46:58,871 --> 00:47:02,560
front page. And then yeah, when that
happens, that's when uh, you know,

841
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,590
you definitely see like a bump
and then if you just, you know,

842
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,670
keep coming out with good hours,
hopefully you can hang onto them.

843
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,240
Yeah, that's what Segura said. Segora
said it had a huge impact. So it,

844
00:47:13,241 --> 00:47:17,590
as soon as he put his first special on
it just boom, everything just took off,

845
00:47:17,591 --> 00:47:20,280
doubled, tripled. Now he's
doing theaters like it,

846
00:47:20,281 --> 00:47:24,400
it just made it made a big impact
for them. And then a year plus later,

847
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:27,550
he just recorded a second one.
So He's getting ready to release that now.

848
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,360
Yeah. But the thing is
though, Tom is also a, uh,

849
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:35,470
he's a monster common. So there's a lot
of people, you know, back in the day,

850
00:47:35,471 --> 00:47:38,050
like the myspace thing, hate to keep
going back to that. But it was like, well,

851
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:41,470
I'll get on my space and then I'll,
I'll sell out fucking the forum.

852
00:47:41,471 --> 00:47:45,040
And it's just like, well, you're not
that person. You know what I mean?

853
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:50,041
You don't have like a like whatever that
you don't have to have a whole bunch of

854
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:54,790
shit going on at the same time. But
also like Tom's got a great work ethic,

855
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:58,660
which you do too. You know, he's always
working on new shit and you are too.

856
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:01,450
You know? That's, I think that's one of
the most important things for a comedian.

857
00:48:01,451 --> 00:48:05,740
It's just a constantly be working on
stuff we all know like especially where we

858
00:48:05,741 --> 00:48:06,430
came from,

859
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:10,240
guys would develop an act and they had
that fucking act locked down for decades

860
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:14,710
now. And if you're doing that then,
which when you go home you're like, Yo,

861
00:48:14,711 --> 00:48:18,700
hobbies getting more attention or if you
don't even have a fucking hobby at that

862
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:20,530
point,
if you basically have your life down.

863
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:23,830
Like I live here and I drive here and
this is the jokes I tell and then I come

864
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:28,450
home. You just waiting to die.
Yeah, I think, and I think
it fucks with your brain.

865
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,150
Your brain gets just turns to mush.
So do you,

866
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,720
is this something you read about or
is this just like your instincts now?

867
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,860
This is all figuring out, uh, your
own mind. Yeah. How it worked.

868
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,680
Because I feel like when you get
into this business, like you have to,

869
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:46,210
as much as people can give you advice,

870
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:50,500
you have to figure out how
you create what works for you.

871
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:54,190
Because I used to get into brutal writer's
block and I didn't know how to get

872
00:48:54,191 --> 00:48:54,970
myself out of it.

873
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:59,970
And what I do now is I know these tricks
that I use that fuck with my brain and

874
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:03,970
open it up rather than close it down. And
basically what it is is like, all right,

875
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:06,880
I see.
I just don't have anything new to say.

876
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:11,970
I'm just going to Improv
on all my existing material
and I'm going try to expand

877
00:49:12,011 --> 00:49:13,330
it as much as I can.

878
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:17,740
So then this old fucking thing that
was weighing me down becomes, you know,

879
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:18,880
it's like you cracked the window,

880
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:23,050
becomes a little fresh air comes
in there and it's, it's really, uh,

881
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,360
you know, how your mind works is really,
you know, the vibe. Like do it a few. I,

882
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:31,720
if I was in in here and it didn't
have all these fucking antlers,

883
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:34,810
lava lamps and the mummies and tech,
there's a vibe in this room.

884
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,710
But if you just had overhead fucking
lighting and we were sitting at some

885
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:41,820
horrible table you get at staples
and it was just the two of us,

886
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,160
it would affect the vibe.
Yeah, yeah. No, I agree.

887
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:48,550
If we never addressed it and maybe we
could riff on how fucking sterile it was,

888
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:50,320
but so like,

889
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:54,460
like mentally you do the same thing is
rather than sitting there at that fucking,

890
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:56,230
you know, when I'm a writer's
block, that's what I feel like.

891
00:49:56,231 --> 00:49:59,020
I feel like I'm sitting in like that
overhead lighting and it's just,

892
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:02,170
it's horrible.
So you just do go on stage with,

893
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:05,470
with like a half idea
and dig yourself a hole.

894
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,940
We'd have to kind of figure out how
to get out of it. I do that. Yeah.

895
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,510
All the time. A lot of
guys do that, right? Yeah.

896
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:15,100
I got this new thing on a Mcdonald's
of all things that I'm talking about,

897
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:17,610
just how they've,
um,

898
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,140
I'm trying to combine it
with like the bloggers,

899
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:22,210
how they bully people
and if you apologize,

900
00:50:22,211 --> 00:50:25,720
they see the weakness and then you become
the person they're always going after.

901
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,040
And I feel like Mcdonald's,
that when

902
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,990
they started making salads,
like they,

903
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:33,820
they admitted they admitted this
wrongdoing and now look at them.

904
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,740
Now they're serving breakfast all day.
That was the best move they ever did.

905
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,190
They were on the run. They're
on that side. I had a bit
about that years ago. Like,

906
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:41,880
why don't you fucking keep
making that McChrystal,

907
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:45,410
it's the greatest thing on earth.
And he stopped having it a 10:00 AM like,

908
00:50:45,411 --> 00:50:49,310
it's so true that McGriddle griddle is,
I don't, I try not to eat those two days.

909
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:53,060
That like with the pancake with
soaked and Sarah is that way.

910
00:50:53,061 --> 00:50:56,870
But like the bun is a pancake can say
that this one of the worst things I've

911
00:50:56,871 --> 00:51:01,820
ever tasted. I love them. I
love those things. I love them.

912
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:02,870
My kid eat them though.

913
00:51:02,871 --> 00:51:06,530
I can't eat them because it's fucking
like 20 grams of sugar. It's so bad for,

914
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:09,400
you know, everybody's got
their thing. I like, uh,

915
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:14,090
I like the double
cheeseburgers at Mcdonald's.

916
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,030
I can't eat McDonald's cheese
burgers at Burger King Guy.

917
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,240
I can't eat them either. If I eat at
those places, I have to eat something,

918
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:23,390
chicken or fish.
I just know that that Burger is just,

919
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:27,400
who knows what the fuck is in
mind when you don't do that. Yeah,

920
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,560
I know, but it's just you start
serving salads. If he got,

921
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:31,670
I'm don't want a salad bar.

922
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,640
I'm not going going to get stupid place
with the play room next to it because

923
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:37,640
you're stuck. If you're stuck somewhere
and there's only one thing to eat,

924
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:40,280
like if you're on a truck stop on the
highway and it's just a Mcdonald's,

925
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,160
try to get something with some
kind of vitamins and it, dude,

926
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:44,600
you know what they like?
They like,

927
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,840
you know when like a filthy comic
decides he's going to work clean.

928
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,120
That's what they're doing. All
right. Mcdonald's s you work blue.

929
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,510
Okay. What do you see? A filthy comic
trying out for the tonight show?

930
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:00,680
They're fucking act as empty. It's like
an empty box. No, you can do it though.

931
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,930
You could do it, but it's not
like, look, if you're just,

932
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:08,150
if you're just being dirty because it's
punching up your jokes, that's one thing.

933
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,150
All right,
but if it's really how you are,

934
00:52:11,151 --> 00:52:14,160
I mean how I talk on stage is how I talk.
That's how I talk.

935
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:19,180
So for me to go up there and actually to
work clean and do all of that is is me

936
00:52:20,361 --> 00:52:22,250
being being a character.
Yeah.

937
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:27,290
So that's why I just went up like
I think you know, to George Carlin,

938
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:30,110
you could consider that guy blue prior.

939
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:33,420
Those guys will fucking brilliant
as bill Cosby. You know,

940
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,980
Bill Cosby himself as stick to me it's
like arguably the greatest special of all

941
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:38,120
fucking time.
You know what I mean?

942
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:42,380
It's a shame what he did after
the specials or before or before.

943
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,310
During. Yeah. I mean I guess he's just
always doing that. Yeah. I have no idea.

944
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,030
Do you think?

945
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,090
And this is something I think you and I
are the last two that he never tried to

946
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,370
repeat.
I feel I feel left out.

947
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,260
Tamara Harris says that
two parties and shit,

948
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,420
he [inaudible] on stage with that.
You always get some rest.

949
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,580
But do you think that, you know, we
were talking about your mom, you know,

950
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:07,640
w could pull you over and spank you on
the highway. Like someone could do that.

951
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:08,900
Like my mom could say like,

952
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:11,960
I didn't even realize what my mom was
saying was fucked up until her brother

953
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,040
goes, Jesus Christ, what the fuck are
you saying? She would just yell at me.

954
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,710
I'm going to break both your fucking
legs. And my uncle was like, Jesus,

955
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:21,170
don't talk to the fucking kid like
that. And then I was like, yeah,

956
00:53:21,171 --> 00:53:22,190
that is kind of fucked up.

957
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,190
But I didn't even think anything of it
cause I was seven normal. It's normal.

958
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:26,100
Do you think

959
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,720
that back in Cosby's day,

960
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:31,650
like back in the 60s do you think that
that was a regular thing that people just

961
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:34,980
would roofie chicks or they would give
them Quileute or they would give them a

962
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:37,020
Mickey,
they used to call it dropping a Mickey.

963
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:41,370
Do you think that that was
like a more normal thing? Um,

964
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,340
I have no idea. I have no idea. No idea.

965
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:48,720
But I do know back then there was all
that. What were you wearing? Well,

966
00:53:48,721 --> 00:53:52,470
what did you think was going to
happen? I made it was really, uh,

967
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:57,780
it was, yeah, dude, it was,
I mean all of that, that um,

968
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,250
uh, frat boys shit, all of
that reputation was earned.

969
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,170
Just some of the sh dude,
I,

970
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:08,160
I've talked to guys like 10 years older
than me and they tell me like half the

971
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,480
shit that they,
you know,

972
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:15,200
not have to ship a sizable chunk of some
of their stories with the hazing and

973
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:16,950
shit they did with chicks.
It'd be like, dude,

974
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:20,380
you guys would all be in fucking
jail, man. Long time. Yeah.

975
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:25,620
Like the 70s those guys that came
of age in the 70s I remember,

976
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,620
God, I can't, I'm like, I'm
not gonna name names. No. One,

977
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,740
one night I'm riding in a car.

978
00:54:31,741 --> 00:54:36,390
It was me and another comic and this
other comic who was older and we would

979
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:39,540
drive and killing time. We started
telling pussy stories, dude,

980
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:43,950
and this guy stories
every fucking other story.

981
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:46,860
Me and the other comic or looking at
each other like, dude, what the fuck?

982
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:49,650
I remember one of his stories ended with,
yeah,

983
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:52,790
there were a lot of no's that
night. It just like, dude,

984
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:58,320
we literally changed the subject,
Jesus Christ.

985
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,510
And he was sitting there laughing
because like to him it wasn't,

986
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:08,280
that was what was done. So, you know, uh,

987
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:14,280
I don't any anybody that says from back
then that that was done to them after

988
00:55:14,281 --> 00:55:16,890
just listening to that guy
talking about the 70s I'm like,

989
00:55:16,891 --> 00:55:21,600
Jesus Christ with the 60s were like, so
I believe you know, all of them. Yeah.

990
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:25,000
I think, I think that's what I
think the behavior that people had,

991
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:28,980
if you've watched like those old movies
or men would smack women all the time.

992
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:30,660
I mean it was, uh, it was all the time.

993
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:34,050
Like someone would say something
if backhand them shut up, dude,

994
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:37,440
there was no pedophiles back then. They
will consider dirty old men stay away.

995
00:55:37,441 --> 00:55:40,230
He's a dirty old man. That
guy's a drunk. He's a bum.

996
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:44,340
It was very just sort of broadly defined.
Yeah.

997
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:50,130
Like a Catholic pedophile scandal
back then was there my man,

998
00:55:50,821 --> 00:55:53,520
that's when the, Oh, what was
going on? We knew about it. Right.

999
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:56,060
We knew there was certain priests
he had to stay away. I have to,

1000
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:59,850
this is so beyond any of anything that I,
I even investigate.

1001
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:02,070
I have no fucking idea.
I just in general,

1002
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:07,100
I hear to the thing that we're basically
hairless apes that can drive a car.

1003
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,190
I mean, I really just think that
that's what we, that's how we be.

1004
00:56:10,191 --> 00:56:11,024
Like when I watched,

1005
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:16,130
when they first discovered
that chimpanzees like eight
other monkeys and that

1006
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,950
when they fucking kill the monkey,
they got off on it.

1007
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:24,100
And they almost like walk around talking
shit about what they did and like, ah,

1008
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,640
I saw this thing where they talked
to this one chimpanzee how to do sign

1009
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:31,060
language and within like a fucking month,
his ego went through the roof.

1010
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:34,480
He thinks started sexually assaulting
other fucking, I was like, yeah,

1011
00:56:34,481 --> 00:56:36,610
I felt like it got its own show.
It was unreal.

1012
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:39,820
It was walking around
like some spoiled star.

1013
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,490
And um,

1014
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:46,720
when I just see the behavior of those
fucking things and this, I saw one,

1015
00:56:46,721 --> 00:56:49,360
this chimpanzee caught this
other smaller monkey, right?

1016
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,420
And it's standing on the fucking thing.

1017
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,550
He's up in a tree and the thing can't
move. And rather than killing it,

1018
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:57,070
it was just taken its index finger.

1019
00:56:57,071 --> 00:57:00,190
And his thumb was just digging
meat out of the things back.

1020
00:57:00,191 --> 00:57:04,210
And the thing was screaming and the
fucking chimp was getting off on like

1021
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:08,140
torturing this thing to death.
And it really was like a,

1022
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:12,730
it was fucking depressing to watch.
I'm like, that's what we like.

1023
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,750
So much of that is in it. Like I
really believe that. I don't, I'm,

1024
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:18,100
I'm a pessimistic guy when
it comes to that shit. Well,

1025
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:22,300
I mean that's undeniable when it comes
to chimps and we are a close relative to

1026
00:57:22,301 --> 00:57:23,980
chimps,
but that when they found that video,

1027
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:27,610
when they first started filming that
I think there was a David Attenborough

1028
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:31,420
nature documentary, I might be
wrong, but when we first filmed it,

1029
00:57:31,421 --> 00:57:34,780
that was the first time they realized
that chimps even ate meat again.

1030
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:37,330
Didn't even know. No,
they monkeys all the time.

1031
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:40,030
It's like one of their favorite things
to eat and they have these sophisticated

1032
00:57:40,031 --> 00:57:42,070
ways of capturing it. Did
you see all that? Yeah,

1033
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:44,860
the way they flush it out and everything
and then they surrounded it and then

1034
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:47,860
they just get the dude and
the way they see in the end,

1035
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:52,660
like they're all amped up when they
killed the fucking thing. Like uh, yeah,

1036
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,980
like the heat, I'm like from the
asshole first. They eat their guts.

1037
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,630
Like they pulled them apart.

1038
00:57:58,631 --> 00:58:02,320
Like they're hold onto their body and
they pull like there's a video of one,

1039
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:07,100
like literally biting it through the hips
and like pulling it, pulling it apart,

1040
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:11,500
thing still alive and that screaming it
screaming and it's got this little face,

1041
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,780
a little face and its
little hands and screaming.

1042
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:16,900
And this champ is just eating it alive.
I mean that's a,

1043
00:58:16,901 --> 00:58:20,620
that's our closest relative. It's
crazy. But you know what? This is crazy.

1044
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:25,720
It made me feel fucked up. Just
visualizing that. You can watch it.

1045
00:58:25,721 --> 00:58:30,310
We can pull it up. No. Um, there's a, I
saw the back when I had to shut it off.

1046
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:34,120
It was on youtube has a bunch of them now
that they've caught quite a few videos

1047
00:58:34,121 --> 00:58:37,630
of it now, but what's more fucked up,
his fucking hate chimpanzees know.

1048
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:40,550
But those other chimps, I
think they should be able
to live, but I just fucking,

1049
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:43,030
I don't want it anyway. And we'd
be anywhere near one. This Gary,

1050
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,510
they're very scary. We
didn't, you know, we,

1051
00:58:45,511 --> 00:58:48,670
we had this idea that they weren't scary
because of Bj and the bear and all that.

1052
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:51,220
Tarzan. Yeah. All that
stupid shit from television.

1053
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:55,150
We decided that there were these
peaceful banana eating. You know,

1054
00:58:55,151 --> 00:58:58,330
we thought the eight bananas until like
a decade ago and we didn't even ever

1055
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,740
hear why they're so strong.

1056
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:04,630
Why I saw this whole fucking
thing is the way when they,

1057
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:09,610
their brain fires a message to
whatever the nerve endings or whatever,

1058
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:13,210
when they can't do, obviously they
can't sit down and like play a guitar,

1059
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,100
like they don't have that type of thing.
It's just like when they,

1060
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,020
they want their right arm to do things
like all the muscles from the tip of

1061
00:59:20,021 --> 00:59:23,210
their fingers all the way
into his shoulder, all the
way to the back or whatever.

1062
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,600
I mean I think it using those anyways,
but like our stuff is more like precision.

1063
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:31,910
Their shit is just like fucking a,
it's like a, like a defensive blitz.

1064
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:35,630
Like everybody's fucking
common. So I mean, I dunno,

1065
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:39,170
I just realized halfway through that it
was beyond my fucking understanding of

1066
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:42,410
the human body. But everyone, like
they just say like, just giant,

1067
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:47,590
like areas of muscle all just,
just enact at the same fucking time.

1068
00:59:47,591 --> 00:59:51,650
So have you ever seen one one looks like
without their hair, the jacked, right.

1069
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,980
Oh my God. Pull up. Pull
up a hairless Champix.

1070
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:58,150
But you look at them but they don't
outweigh you. So you feel like I,

1071
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,790
you fucker let's, that's, you know,
no biting, no biting. All right.

1072
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:07,040
I ought to be able to come out of a Dojo,
right with a brown belt in Jujitsu.

1073
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:12,350
If you've looked at the fucking
weight difference. Lewdness balls.

1074
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:16,160
Jesus Christ. We are the size of
the sack on that guy. Do that.

1075
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:21,161
Looks like Ivan puts the
Polish Power Wwba oh my God,

1076
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:24,920
Dude, look at those fucking hand on and
they know it now. I don't, I don't wonder.

1077
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,400
Yeah, we got the side of the
arms on the fucker. Yeah,

1078
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:33,080
he's probably 170 180 pounds.
It's probably like a as
big as a man, but there,

1079
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:36,830
the strength they have
is just unbelievable.

1080
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:41,000
I had a baby monkey on me.
Baby chimp on me wants on Newsradio.

1081
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,750
We had this episode that
they, they brought in a bunch
of animals for the scene.

1082
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,591
Who was our baby?

1083
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:48,860
It was like two years old and this
little guy was on top of me and he just

1084
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:53,210
started hitting me in the back and I
was like, whoa. Like what the fuck?

1085
01:00:53,211 --> 01:00:55,190
Like it didn't make any sense.
Was it testing you?

1086
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:58,700
I just beat my ass is a little tiny thing.
Just decided to start beating my ass.

1087
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:01,490
I mean he was little like I could pick
them up and I could hold them like this,

1088
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:05,960
but I knew like just from this two year
old chimp that if he decided to just

1089
01:01:05,961 --> 01:01:08,750
fucking go crazy on me,
I would have to fight for my life.

1090
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,880
There's a little two year
olds. Oh yeah, absolutely.

1091
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:13,790
Two year old person beat the fuck out
of a two year old every two year old on

1092
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:16,280
earth doesn't stand a chance.
Who was so slow? Yeah.

1093
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:20,990
Well Finna hop like a fucking squirrel
ran up your arm and started eating your

1094
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:25,070
ear. Like how far that thing would get
before you even just grab its tail. Yeah.

1095
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,970
Like you wouldn't even know what to do.
Like everything.

1096
01:01:26,971 --> 01:01:28,910
Snakes just lightening quick.

1097
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:33,670
Like how fucking like the fastest
hands in boxing is nothing.

1098
01:01:33,671 --> 01:01:38,120
Nothing compared to reptilian speed.
Yeah,

1099
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,340
they're fucking strong.
They don't have any fat either.

1100
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,400
There's a theory because of that.
It's called the aquatic ape theory.

1101
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:47,990
They think that people evolved around
water and that's one of the reasons why

1102
01:01:47,991 --> 01:01:49,250
you throw a baby in the water.

1103
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:52,430
They close their mouth and they hold
their breath immediately and they can

1104
01:01:52,431 --> 01:01:56,720
actually kind of float the float up to the
top. I don't know. Blue sappy, try back.

1105
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:59,330
I've only watched videos pick shit.

1106
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:03,320
People in lab coats just grabbing babies
by like the back of their pants and

1107
01:02:03,321 --> 01:02:06,350
just throwing them out. That's what I'm
talking about, right, that look at it.

1108
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:08,330
But if you throw a chimp in the water,
they drown.

1109
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:12,560
If you throw up like a baby chimp in the
water, they just start breathing water.

1110
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,800
They don't know what the fuck to do,
but babies instinctively hold the breath.

1111
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:16,820
All right.
The baby humans.

1112
01:02:16,821 --> 01:02:20,130
Did you see that video of those
chimps fucking with that otter or some

1113
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,720
shit?
It smells overseas.

1114
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:25,710
Zoos where they just stick
animals together that fight
because they don't give a

1115
01:02:25,711 --> 01:02:29,340
fuck. I don't know why. It definitely,
there's no way with Pete and shit.

1116
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:33,520
And you could do that in this country
with some sort of fucking honor or Zen

1117
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,400
China. They'll put like a
bear and with a lion. Yeah.

1118
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:41,000
And then watch it as they eat
some fucking Yak. Go Nana.

1119
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,700
Because then it makes it dick hard.
Um, that was a very stereotypical,

1120
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:50,310
so this fucking honor or whatever the
fuck it was. Sea Lion. I know what it was.

1121
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,280
This thing they kept
slapping the fucking thing,

1122
01:02:53,281 --> 01:02:54,600
like that thing was slapping your back.

1123
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:58,050
And what ended up happening is they
got hold of one of them and they just

1124
01:02:58,051 --> 01:03:00,870
fucking dragged it and the monkeys were
flipping out and they couldn't save it.

1125
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,500
Dragged it into the fucking water.
And they drowned at the honor. Yeah.

1126
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:08,750
Whenever the fuck it was, it was Neil or
something. It was something like that, uh,

1127
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:12,240
dragged the champion of the water
and drown in it and fucking whoa.

1128
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,810
Dragged the fucking thing in there and
the fucking monkeys were flipping out.

1129
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:21,170
And I on such a sadistic level enjoyed
that video like yeah you fuckers cause I

1130
01:03:21,401 --> 01:03:24,060
don't like bullies and I just
felt like they were bullying.

1131
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:25,920
Whatever the fuck was in the water.

1132
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:29,940
This is going to torture you or your
listeners cause I can't remember what

1133
01:03:29,941 --> 01:03:31,350
animal animal it was.
Cause like I said,

1134
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:35,350
I was probably doing 20 different
things at once and I watched them. Um,

1135
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:36,541
I don't know if he,

1136
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:40,200
if he'd go on their monkey verse something
eventually you to get to it wasn't a

1137
01:03:40,201 --> 01:03:44,250
chimp or a monkey. Uh, I
know it wasn't a chimp,

1138
01:03:44,251 --> 01:03:48,350
it wasn't a smaller, it was, it was
a baby baby one like a, I dunno,

1139
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:52,320
like I think it was small enough that
this little brown thing could drag it in

1140
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:54,060
the water. That's the best
you're going to get out of me.

1141
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:59,490
I would be the worst
witness in a bank robbery.

1142
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:04,530
They had legs and they were yelling a
lot. Pretty sure they were people. Yeah,

1143
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:10,230
I think they got what they wanted because
they left. Does that help you guys out?

1144
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:16,260
Because a lot of those fucking videos
out there too. If you could, if you go,

1145
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:20,300
you know, bear versus, or champ
versus, or tiger versus, oh,

1146
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:24,510
I watched them all the time.
I watch slap fights, you know,

1147
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:27,240
it's the funniest slab heights.
What's slap fights? People,

1148
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,480
it always ends up in a real fight
or somebody gets knocked out.

1149
01:04:30,481 --> 01:04:32,850
It's just I stand with
my hands behind my back.

1150
01:04:32,851 --> 01:04:37,230
You go first and you just wind up and
slap me in the face and then it's my turn,

1151
01:04:37,231 --> 01:04:38,460
whoever quits first.

1152
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:43,440
So there's always that one guy who slaps
with this meaty part here and catches

1153
01:04:43,441 --> 01:04:47,070
you on the jaw and then the
person gets knocked out. You know,

1154
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:48,180
one of my favorite things is,

1155
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,560
is the people when they scream
worldstar like at this point,

1156
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:55,350
they're so excited that
they're finally part of it,

1157
01:04:55,351 --> 01:04:57,780
that they filmed another human
being getting knocked out.

1158
01:04:57,781 --> 01:05:01,890
Like the level they'd like.
I think it's fucking goes through the,

1159
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,780
I'm sorry to you listen to I
suppose just blew up their ears.

1160
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:08,880
How fucking high up in bitchy the voice
goes and they scream it like 20 fucking

1161
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:13,700
times. Um, it's amazing that one site
became the spot where you would go,

1162
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:17,680
wants to be there as most epic
fucking knock. It's just like,

1163
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:21,580
like they, you know what it is
what them is. They had a standard,

1164
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:24,190
like you couldn't just get knocked out.
You,

1165
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:28,660
I'd like to base level is knocked
the fuck out all the way up to like,

1166
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,680
I guess, you know, is that
guy dead? I mean it's fucking
insane. Some brutal ones.

1167
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:35,380
Yeah, there are. There are without
a doubt. Like I have a certain,

1168
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:38,470
like my thing is I like if
two people at squaring off,

1169
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:42,160
they go at it and one person gets
knocked out and after then knocked out,

1170
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:44,950
that's it. I can watch those. But like,

1171
01:05:44,951 --> 01:05:47,440
you know when the person's on the ground
and then they catch like another two,

1172
01:05:47,441 --> 01:05:48,400
three [inaudible]

1173
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:49,850
when a kick them,
when they're down,

1174
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:54,140
there's a desire of this one guy who
was drunk and he was mouthing off to all

1175
01:05:54,141 --> 01:05:57,680
these people and one guy stepped up to
him and knocked him out and after he

1176
01:05:57,681 --> 01:06:00,650
knocked him out, while he was laying
on his back, people came over,

1177
01:06:00,651 --> 01:06:01,730
they pulled his pants down,

1178
01:06:01,731 --> 01:06:04,130
people started kicking him in the
face while he was unconscious.

1179
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:07,520
And then he was like making these horrible
moaning noises and guys would just

1180
01:06:07,521 --> 01:06:11,660
run up and punched him in the
face. Not just one. Like many,

1181
01:06:11,661 --> 01:06:15,440
many people did it and people die. I
don't know. He could have easily died.

1182
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:18,310
He could have easily died. No, there
was that kid knocked out. That kid,

1183
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,480
the kid square was getting
bullied by another kid.

1184
01:06:20,481 --> 01:06:23,750
He knocked him out and he was
like, uh, I dunno. I Dunno.

1185
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:25,820
In the area where the kid
hit the classic thing,

1186
01:06:25,821 --> 01:06:29,830
he and his back of his head and he went
to a comedy died that happened with the

1187
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:34,070
Kevin James worked with Kevin James
worked as a bouncer in Long Island and one

1188
01:06:34,071 --> 01:06:35,960
of the guys he worked with,
uh,

1189
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:39,440
got in a fight with a drunk k Odom
knocked him out. Like I fell back,

1190
01:06:39,441 --> 01:06:43,640
hit his head on the curb dead
and the guy wound up doing time.

1191
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:45,980
You know what I mean? He was
just stupid fucking, you know,

1192
01:06:45,981 --> 01:06:50,930
$10 an hour job as a bouncer and inmate
maybe shouldn't have hit the guy and

1193
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,550
maybe shit. I Dunno.
I Dunno what happened.

1194
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:54,800
I don't know what the circumstances was.
I can't picture Kevin.

1195
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:58,190
James is a bouncer. He's such a
sweetheart of a guy. He can fight.

1196
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:01,700
I know he can fight. He's a
tough guy. I mean you don't,

1197
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:04,220
you don't think that looking at him.
But Kevin James Hits hard.

1198
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:08,420
I wasn't saying that. I'm just saying he's
such like a nice guy. He's a nice guy,

1199
01:07:08,421 --> 01:07:12,290
but he's got a switch. Like, if people
pissed him off, you don't want to be,

1200
01:07:12,291 --> 01:07:15,010
he's a fucking gorilla.
That guy is, he looks at,

1201
01:07:15,011 --> 01:07:18,530
he's a sweetheart and he does all this
like physical comedy and laughing and

1202
01:07:18,531 --> 01:07:22,970
joking around. But he's like, no, I
hope of with them a long time ago to 50.

1203
01:07:22,971 --> 01:07:27,650
He's a great guy. Like certain people
who come like, like bouncers. Yeah.

1204
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:28,600
You know what I mean?
I know

1205
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:33,030
they want, they want to fight
and they like, I had a couple
of buddies of mine, um,

1206
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:38,050
from high school and on a slow night
they would just walk up to somebody and

1207
01:07:38,051 --> 01:07:41,800
just say, I, it got to go. Wow.
I didn't know that you got to go.

1208
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:44,080
And they would just escort them
just cause it was funny to them.

1209
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:48,010
So they pretend to be a bouncer? No,
no, no, no, no, no. They were bouncers.

1210
01:07:48,011 --> 01:07:51,040
But if it was a slow night, they
would just, they would just walk,

1211
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:53,440
they picked some nerdy guy and
just say, listen, you got to go.

1212
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:55,050
You got and just watched the guide.

1213
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:58,340
And then every once in a while they'd
get somebody that would get upset and we

1214
01:07:58,341 --> 01:08:00,450
start fighting and then they
would beat the shit out of him.

1215
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:03,730
I would just be like [inaudible] that's,
it doesn't sound like a good time to me.

1216
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:08,490
I saw a guy one time at Boston, right?
He got into this fucking fight and they

1217
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,090
the fucking,

1218
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:14,890
I just came in and grabbed him and I
remember they just picked him up by his

1219
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,440
fucking neck two guys and
just started running with him.

1220
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:22,160
It was the worst secure cause it was all
these people that had to scamper to get

1221
01:08:22,161 --> 01:08:24,860
out of the way and they're
running with this guy.

1222
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:28,040
Like I swear to God the guy's head was
like nine feet in the air and he was up

1223
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:29,840
there like on. All right. All
right. All right. All right.

1224
01:08:29,841 --> 01:08:31,970
Screaming our right as
they're running across.

1225
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:36,170
Then all the dance floor's party and
they got to the fucking door where they

1226
01:08:36,171 --> 01:08:38,570
were going to go out.
And the door was a typical,

1227
01:08:38,571 --> 01:08:42,890
was only like eight feet high so I can
shoulders and head were above it and he

1228
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:47,450
running like a four 40 and just boom,

1229
01:08:47,451 --> 01:08:51,740
he folded in half and then they
just threw him out into the street.

1230
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,920
And I remember even back then just
going like that was so fucking overly

1231
01:08:57,621 --> 01:09:01,110
excessive. And if I was running
this club I would be like, dude,

1232
01:09:01,111 --> 01:09:04,280
do you realize that you almost
just ran over 80 innocent people?

1233
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:05,510
I mean at this point,
dude,

1234
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:10,490
I'm 47 so like my idea of the way young
people think is from fucking 25 years

1235
01:09:10,491 --> 01:09:14,870
ago. So like, like my idea of what
like what a bouncer is and they, to me,

1236
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:15,860
they would just guys,

1237
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:20,140
I'll used to beat the shit
out of people and you know,

1238
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:23,840
in school and now just wanted
to do it for a living. You know,

1239
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,890
I think Kevin got the job though
because his Kung Fu instructor,

1240
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:31,840
Kevin used to be a really into martial
arts and his Kung Fu instructor worked

1241
01:09:31,841 --> 01:09:34,640
there and he got him a job.
It was just like a thing that it needed.

1242
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,920
I think he quit when
all this was going on.

1243
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:42,020
When I was 19, I worked
as a, uh, not a bouncer,

1244
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:45,620
but I guess like a security person at
this place called Great Woods Center for

1245
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:49,270
Katie Murphy on the raw tour.
Did you really?

1246
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:53,970
So I saw a Rodney Dangerfield right
after back to school and he got big.

1247
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:55,203
I was probably right

1248
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:57,350
work in there.
When you saw Rodney Dangerfield,

1249
01:09:57,351 --> 01:10:00,200
I was probably working backstage cause
that was when Rodney was wearing a

1250
01:10:00,201 --> 01:10:02,000
bathrobe was though they,

1251
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:06,900
those days when his hair was like yellow,
almost orange. Did he, did he died on?

1252
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,900
No, I think he came on a Tux.
Oh, real. I can't remember him.

1253
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:13,420
I remember Eddie came out in
the blue suit, but go ahead.

1254
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:18,320
Um, I saw bill Cosby there to,
Bill Cosby was there. I saw,

1255
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:22,190
um, I saw Kennison there like
right after his first special.

1256
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:25,670
That was interesting because
Kennison did his HBO special,

1257
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,580
it's atrial specialist fucking
giant, right? He was the biggest cup,

1258
01:10:28,581 --> 01:10:31,610
but then he had to write a whole new
hour and he didn't have a whole new hour.

1259
01:10:31,611 --> 01:10:34,730
And it was kind of obvious like you could
see like, oh there's a lot of filler.

1260
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,580
And I remember thinking like,
wow, this is interesting.

1261
01:10:37,581 --> 01:10:41,170
Like I hadn't even thought about doing
standup yet cause it's like 1986. Right.

1262
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:44,450
But I remember seeing him,
I was going, Whoa, like this
guy doesn't even have that.

1263
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:49,010
He doesn't have like the jokes like Carla
Beau would go on before him. And uh,

1264
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:52,220
there was a couple of other
guys too, I think, but, and
Carl had a pretty good act,

1265
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:54,320
you know, but calls act, his act was,

1266
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:58,170
it might not have been as
good as kinnisons was back
in the day, like, you know,

1267
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:00,740
during the Hbo Special Time.
But it was tight.

1268
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,130
Like you can tell his
punchlines were solid. He knew
we were, he's going with it.

1269
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:07,310
But with Kennison you could tell that he
was like kind of filling time, you know,

1270
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:10,220
it was, it wasn't, it wasn't
there anymore, you know,

1271
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:14,550
because he had worked for
probably 10 plus on that one hour.

1272
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:20,110
I never saw a guy like so
adversely affected by fame
me because I was such a fan

1273
01:11:20,111 --> 01:11:24,580
of his, just watching like
he kind of was every cliche.

1274
01:11:24,581 --> 01:11:26,080
And what kills me is when,

1275
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:29,170
right when he died was he was getting
sober and he was going to t like he was

1276
01:11:29,171 --> 01:11:30,610
going to turn it around.
I thought

1277
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:34,770
no, he died with coconut system. Like
I said, I mean, you know the guy,

1278
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:37,240
he had broken his system when he died.
He,

1279
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:39,900
he's autopsy revealed
that he had done coke. He,

1280
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:44,220
I think he died the ironic thing and he
was killed by a drunk driver because he

1281
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:47,420
used to do that bit. We're gonna
drink and we're going to drive bottom,

1282
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:51,300
pull it off. You know, why? Cause
we do it every fucking night.

1283
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:55,830
There was like one of his things like
that was one of his filler bits, you know,

1284
01:11:55,831 --> 01:12:00,831
after it just the first shit was so good
like the homosexual necrophilia acts

1285
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:05,930
and uh, the fucking
starving kids in Africa. Oh

1286
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:09,420
visit clip of him early on on uh,

1287
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:13,650
youtube where he doesn't have
control of the yelling yet.

1288
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:16,410
So it's really just like,
you know,

1289
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:18,870
cause like he learned by
the time of the HBO special,

1290
01:12:18,871 --> 01:12:21,420
he knew how to bring it really down
right now and start to come and then just

1291
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:24,120
fucking launch it and then
go back to being quiet again.

1292
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:28,080
There's a great one where you're
watching him the clip. Do you see?

1293
01:12:28,081 --> 01:12:32,070
It's before he quite has it figured out
and he's just way more yelling then he

1294
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:35,960
needs to do. But I, I get chills when I
watched the video cause I was just like,

1295
01:12:35,961 --> 01:12:37,590
like this guy is like,

1296
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:43,200
like noses on to something and he
has like sunglasses on, on stage.

1297
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:47,170
He's got like driving gloves. It's not,
it's before the trench coat and all.

1298
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:51,250
Oh I've seen that video. He has a comb
over. Yeah. He had a poodle come over.

1299
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:56,110
Thank God he went to the hat. Yeah.
[inaudible] we the baret. Yeah.

1300
01:12:56,111 --> 01:12:59,980
And in the end he switched from the Baret
to like these rock and roll poisoned

1301
01:12:59,981 --> 01:13:01,330
style bandanas.

1302
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:07,030
Remember he had those crazy bandanas and
it would get long and his hair was long

1303
01:13:07,211 --> 01:13:11,130
and the whole thing. And you've got
big, ugly fat. He got big. Nah, he just

1304
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:15,750
free intelligency just
uh, I mean, Jesus Christ.

1305
01:13:15,751 --> 01:13:17,220
I mean that he's one of
those guys that probably,

1306
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:20,220
you know his autobiography
be like 12 books. Yeah.

1307
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:23,990
His biographies. Good. We called
brother Bill. It's by, uh,

1308
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:28,940
his or his brother. Uh, Bill
wrote it. It's called a brother
Sam. My brother Sam. Oh,

1309
01:13:28,941 --> 01:13:32,720
I got to read this really good because
it talks about how he had a head injury,

1310
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:33,710
like a bad head injury.

1311
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:38,060
He was hit by a car when he was a
little kid and it changed him. Totally.

1312
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:41,090
It's one of the things that happens
to people that have head injuries.

1313
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:45,290
Like sometimes they get crazy
impulsive and they lose,

1314
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,560
they lose like whatever personality
they used to have common. Sane. Yeah.

1315
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:54,530
Completely fucking insane. It's
completely equal. But he, um,

1316
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,280
he got hit by a car, got all fucked
up, and when he got out of it,

1317
01:13:58,281 --> 01:14:02,030
when he healed up, he was just as
fucking maniac to, didn't give a shit.

1318
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:04,880
He's like the devil enter dem or something
like that. It was just a wild man,

1319
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:09,980
just was, had no impulse
control, just was going crazy.

1320
01:14:09,981 --> 01:14:12,190
And it was also when he was
trying be a preacher too. So

1321
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:16,330
like it's sort of fueled his
preaching. Yeah, man. It's really good.

1322
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,940
It's a really good book because,
uh,

1323
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:22,750
his brother bill is a very honest in
it and he even talks about Sam just Sam

1324
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:25,330
stop writing.
It was just partying all the time.

1325
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:27,940
He wasn't coming up with new
material and it talked about how Sam,

1326
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:31,720
before he made it was just this machine.
It's just like he was partying a lot,

1327
01:14:31,721 --> 01:14:35,260
but he was also working on his act and
it was important to him and you know,

1328
01:14:35,261 --> 01:14:38,320
and then, oh yeah, the difference
between his first and second Letterman,

1329
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,670
you can already see the fame thing coming
in through his first Laderman is just

1330
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:46,840
fucking, it's unbelievable.
It's unbelievable. The Rodney
Dangerfield one though,

1331
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,680
when he was on the Rodney
Dangerfield special, that
was, that was it. That was a,

1332
01:14:50,681 --> 01:14:55,030
that was just, you know, the, uh,
the owner of a danger field. Uh,

1333
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:57,850
Tony told me one night that,

1334
01:14:57,851 --> 01:15:00,280
you know how they used to just
let Sam do whatever you want it,

1335
01:15:00,281 --> 01:15:02,980
but it was just fucking crazy.
One night he went on stage.

1336
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:05,530
It's probably isn't funny now because
of all the shit that's happened in the

1337
01:15:05,531 --> 01:15:09,520
world, but he was standing there with this
trench coat for this late night crowd,

1338
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:12,040
right. Probably had half
full Dangerfield, you know,

1339
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:15,430
and he's just sitting there and he
had his hands in his pockets. He just,

1340
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:18,980
he just came on stage, right? And
he's gonna look at you people,

1341
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:23,300
you guys just sitting there drinking,
you know, you guys on a date,

1342
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:25,820
you having a good time.
He just sitting there.

1343
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:30,940
How do you guys know what
I have under this code?

1344
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:32,590
How do you,

1345
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:37,190
how do you not know that I don't have
to 12 gauges under this fucking coat?

1346
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,240
I could just bring them up and
just fucking blow your brains out.

1347
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:42,830
And he didn't let up.

1348
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:46,400
He just kept going with that and going
and going and gradually people started

1349
01:15:46,401 --> 01:15:49,570
getting up walking out and he just kept,
you know,

1350
01:15:49,571 --> 01:15:53,410
that low evil fucking voice he would do.
He just kept doing like, how do you know,

1351
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:58,300
how do you know if he were just kind of
fucking looking around and gradually,

1352
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:03,490
and Tony was telling me going like, yeah,
he fucking walked like half the room.

1353
01:16:03,491 --> 01:16:05,770
He goes, I was pissed because they
were buying drinks for everything.

1354
01:16:05,771 --> 01:16:08,660
But you know, hey, no, that's
how Sam wise. But uh, you know,

1355
01:16:08,661 --> 01:16:11,830
and ended up working out. He ended up
getting a good bit out of it or something,

1356
01:16:11,831 --> 01:16:15,220
but he used to like, to me what I think
is cool about that as the eighties,

1357
01:16:15,221 --> 01:16:18,790
just seem like it was so
much like, uh, like you know,

1358
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:22,210
so many comics that were just
because they needed a warm body.

1359
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,310
We're actually getting like
TV credits since and all that.

1360
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:26,830
It just wasn't all fucking big hair.
And you know,

1361
01:16:26,831 --> 01:16:28,750
what's the deal with this and
what's the deal with that?

1362
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:33,640
That there was actually a fucking guy
doing that. Taking crazy chances. Yeah.

1363
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:35,470
Well that's one of those things.
You just go in update,

1364
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:36,880
you're sick of your fucking act,

1365
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,120
you hate and people or whatever
and you just feel like doing that,

1366
01:16:40,121 --> 01:16:44,260
but I never had the nerve to start
walking the crowd. I never did that.

1367
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:46,300
I was like, all right, I'm
supposed to do a job here.

1368
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:50,350
Ever listened to the date of the laughter,
died the dice, dice God. I love that.

1369
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,420
I love that album.
It's great.

1370
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:57,900
It's a two disc album or like a two
disc CD of him bombing at danger fields

1371
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:03,720
unannounced decided as film or record
his comedy CD after he did dice rules,

1372
01:17:04,481 --> 01:17:07,630
right. There was the first one just called
dice, right? First one just called dice.

1373
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:10,160
I first one was,
I loved

1374
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:14,510
that album. The day the laughter died
is him going up to a crowd of tourists.

1375
01:17:14,511 --> 01:17:15,830
They have no idea he's going to be there.

1376
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,720
There's not that many people in the crowd.

1377
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:20,900
It sounds like there's probably like
50 people in the whole fucking room and

1378
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:24,530
he's just ad libbing to is add living.
He doesn't give a fuck.

1379
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:28,720
And I remember one guy gets up and as
he's leaving the guys leave leaving.

1380
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:31,370
He goes,
you're about as funny as a glass of milk.

1381
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:33,410
Like that's what the guy said to him.

1382
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,420
That's funny is that line I just met.

1383
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:42,900
My favorite one was when he was talking
about how not to get into a relationship.

1384
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:46,410
Remember that bit but how, how did he do
it? He was just, I can't, let's do it.

1385
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:49,770
A year is very, he's just being like,
you know, you meet some chick, you know,

1386
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:54,220
you like, you take a route you wine
yet Dinah and all this shit and,

1387
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:55,520
and she's not going to fuck you.
See,

1388
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:57,150
just keep taking her out
until you going to fuck her.

1389
01:17:57,151 --> 01:18:00,840
So then as she finally lets you,
you meet her parents and all that,

1390
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,480
you're banging away and as you're banging,

1391
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,200
are you thinking of fuck now I'm
in a relationship with this girl.

1392
01:18:07,201 --> 01:18:09,900
She thinks I like her. He goes, this
is how you get out of it. He goes,

1393
01:18:09,901 --> 01:18:14,700
you keep tagging a and right before
you come you go, oh, okay sweetheart,

1394
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:19,800
get ready for the gook.
Something like that. All right,

1395
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,030
here comes the gook.

1396
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:26,510
I remember listening to that by myself
and I literally fell off the couch.

1397
01:18:26,851 --> 01:18:31,830
It was so fucking gross.
And so it was just so like,

1398
01:18:31,831 --> 01:18:35,080
I can't even describe, it was one of
my, one of my favorite fucking, uh,

1399
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:37,530
now I saw him at the,
uh,

1400
01:18:37,531 --> 01:18:42,000
the Worcester Centrum at
the height of when he first,

1401
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:47,130
right after that New Year's
Eve special that he had 88,

1402
01:18:47,131 --> 01:18:52,020
89, 78. So I'm like November 88.
So it was just like, uh, you know,

1403
01:18:52,021 --> 01:18:55,080
everybody liked the end of 87. All
right, happy new year and see everybody.

1404
01:18:55,081 --> 01:18:56,700
Or maybe it was,
maybe it was 89.

1405
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:58,890
It might've been [inaudible]
89 maybe it's thing,

1406
01:18:58,891 --> 01:19:03,891
I remember he had some special that
came out towards the end of one of those

1407
01:19:03,901 --> 01:19:06,720
years and I use was working in a
warehouse on loading trucks and shit.

1408
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:07,801
And we were all just like,

1409
01:19:07,801 --> 01:19:10,260
and just one of those classic moments
back then when there was only so many

1410
01:19:10,261 --> 01:19:12,120
channels, so we would just
like, all right, see you later.

1411
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:16,110
Nobody said I'm watching that dice
shit, but this, we came back Monday.

1412
01:19:16,111 --> 01:19:19,560
Everybody had saw it and just, I
was just weird. It was just, it was,

1413
01:19:19,561 --> 01:19:23,640
he felt like everybody in new sod
somehow everybody fucking sought. Right.

1414
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,460
And then he became the biggest thing ever.
And um,

1415
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:31,470
I went and I saw him and
there was an unknown Eddie
Griffin opened. Really? Yeah.

1416
01:19:31,471 --> 01:19:34,020
I mean I was thinking like,
I think, believe it or not,

1417
01:19:34,021 --> 01:19:37,680
I'm like a year older than him. Or you
started really young Eddie Griffin. Yeah.

1418
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:42,300
Really? Yeah. Eddie's not even 50 that
guys like 46 40 saving Google a man,

1419
01:19:42,301 --> 01:19:43,500
something like that.
But wow.

1420
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:47,460
He opened up and people being rude and
bu and I was doing the same thing. Ooh.

1421
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:51,360
[inaudible] toys. Like I thought he made,
so I kind of deserve the Philly thing,

1422
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:55,710
but I thought it the dice.
Were you backstage go? Yeah,
these guys really like us.

1423
01:19:55,711 --> 01:19:56,910
Like it didn't dawn on me like,
hey,

1424
01:19:56,911 --> 01:19:59,310
maybe he's friends with Eddie
and he respects his comedy,

1425
01:19:59,311 --> 01:20:02,190
which now I know that that was the case.
Um,

1426
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:07,170
and I just remember dice came out and uh,
it was just,

1427
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:11,190
it was, he came out and he did like 10
nursery rhymes that we had all heard.

1428
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:16,080
So he would do the beginning and then
everyone would yell out the punchline and

1429
01:20:16,081 --> 01:20:18,390
then he got to a certain
point you'd be like, oh,

1430
01:20:18,391 --> 01:20:22,380
that's good you did your homework.
Well, I too have also been working.

1431
01:20:22,381 --> 01:20:25,530
And then he just busted out like
five new ones do it. And it was just,

1432
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:30,450
it was the sickest fucking thing
I have place was going crazy.

1433
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:33,240
There was something,
some star light star bright something.

1434
01:20:33,241 --> 01:20:35,460
I just remember it ended
my girlfriend's Twat.

1435
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:42,020
Punk Twat is such a funny fucking
word and the place do not,

1436
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:46,020
I'm telling you like murdering,
murdering this place.

1437
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:47,920
I never got a chance to
see him live and it's peak.

1438
01:20:47,921 --> 01:20:51,250
I only saw them live once I started
working at the store and saw him there.

1439
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:52,750
We went to see him live.

1440
01:20:52,751 --> 01:20:56,770
Me and Norton and Bobby Kelly and Anthony
from opie and Anthony and red band

1441
01:20:57,070 --> 01:21:02,050
went to see him live at the Riviera like
a few weeks, a few years ago. Oh, okay.

1442
01:21:02,230 --> 01:21:06,340
In the upstairs room. That big room
upstairs. It was fucking awesome. It was.

1443
01:21:06,341 --> 01:21:10,060
We were in town for the UFC.
I wasn't working on Friday
night and they were like,

1444
01:21:10,061 --> 01:21:13,930
Tyson town, let's call, let's go. So we
went and got a steak, like gentlemen,

1445
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:18,430
went to a nice restaurant, had a great
time, had some wine, clink glasses,

1446
01:21:18,431 --> 01:21:21,970
got an a limo, went to the dice
show. Oh well it's fucking legendary.

1447
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,530
That's fucking great.
It was so much fun.

1448
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:27,020
But he still does like a little bit
of nursery rhymes and stuff, but he's,

1449
01:21:27,021 --> 01:21:28,360
he's got a bunch of new shit now.

1450
01:21:28,361 --> 01:21:32,740
But the thing that was different about
him than anybody else was that it didn't,

1451
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,530
it didn't,
it was good that you knew the bits.

1452
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,170
Like you could sing them
like a song, like, yeah,

1453
01:21:38,171 --> 01:21:40,990
you would yell them out like Watson,
the ball.

1454
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:44,270
Oh,
everybody would go crazy though.

1455
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:48,240
He was giving you what you wanted and
then he was also still moving it forward.

1456
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:53,241
So it was a [inaudible] and the new new
ones were every bit as good as the other

1457
01:21:54,211 --> 01:21:57,240
ones and they were new.
And then you were trying to remember him.

1458
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,550
So I remember you go to the warehouse,
tell he's got new ones,

1459
01:21:59,551 --> 01:22:03,990
you've got new ones. It's fucking
awesome. Isn't it crazy though?

1460
01:22:03,991 --> 01:22:06,360
Because back then there was no youtube,

1461
01:22:06,361 --> 01:22:10,410
there was that we had to like go see it
under a membership to go see it and all,

1462
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:12,270
and that was another thing too
when there was so few chat.

1463
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:14,340
Even then there was still
like 80 channels or whatever.

1464
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:17,190
But like there was always those things.
Like nobody said,

1465
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:20,940
I'm watching that Dangerfield special.
It was just all of a sudden,

1466
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:22,770
Monday everybody came in and everybody,
you know,

1467
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,630
do you see that guy
move them with the food?

1468
01:22:24,631 --> 01:22:29,400
Is everybody knew who fucking Kinison
was or everybody knew who d dice was. Um,

1469
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,980
Eddie Murphy delirious.
I remember when that came out,

1470
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:35,330
that came out and like
everybody just fucking side,

1471
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:39,740
everybody saw it. It was, it was special.
Came out back then. It made you a star.

1472
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:44,150
It was a different thing. Is today like
an HBO special today? You don't hear shit.

1473
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,820
You, you know, they come out and
nobody hears anything about it.

1474
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:50,180
Oh yeah. Have gone t vose it. She'll watch
it like 30 days later. Yeah. You know,

1475
01:22:50,181 --> 01:22:52,910
I finally sat,
I watched part of it and then I had to go

1476
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:57,250
figuring it out. Now with Hbo Go,
you're, they're making HBO on demand,

1477
01:22:57,290 --> 01:22:59,490
stuff like that. They're figuring it
out. They're catching up to Netflix.

1478
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:03,340
But I found out all Kennison
because a girl I worked with,

1479
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,820
I was working at the Boston athletic.
I was 19 and a,

1480
01:23:06,821 --> 01:23:10,060
there's this girl I worked with,
she was a fucking hilarious,

1481
01:23:10,061 --> 01:23:13,420
just big Boston girl.
She was like five 11 she was hot,

1482
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:17,650
but she was just fucking big,
brash girl. And she, and she goes,

1483
01:23:17,651 --> 01:23:21,430
all my God, this is fucking guy named
Sam Kennison. Have you heard of him?

1484
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:24,570
Oh my God. He was so fucking
funny. I go, what did he do it?

1485
01:23:24,571 --> 01:23:28,420
She goes Comea she goes out in the
parking lot and she does the homosexual

1486
01:23:28,421 --> 01:23:32,800
necrophiliac bit for me in
the parking lot. She's lying
on her stomach. Oh my God.

1487
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:37,420
You mean live keeps fucking in the
ass even after you're dead. It never,

1488
01:23:37,421 --> 01:23:39,130
it never ends is the greatest line ever.

1489
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:43,660
And I remember thinking like try like
laughing at these girl wasn't a comic.

1490
01:23:43,661 --> 01:23:47,320
She was a fucking fitness trainer
telling me about this guy.

1491
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:51,760
And then I had to go see him and then I,
I think I got it on VHS tape,

1492
01:23:51,761 --> 01:23:56,050
if I remember correctly. The first time
I saw it, his HBO special and I was like,

1493
01:23:56,051 --> 01:23:58,590
Whoa, this was a game changer. Yeah.

1494
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:02,080
He was the first guy that made me think
that maybe I could do comedy because

1495
01:24:02,081 --> 01:24:06,730
before I would see like
Seinfeld or I would see like a,

1496
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:08,330
you know,
someone who was like,

1497
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:12,700
like just an evening at the Improv
type guy with the rolled up sleeves.

1498
01:24:12,701 --> 01:24:16,780
And did you ever notice? And
I'm like, God, it's not me.
I'm just, I'm too fucked up.

1499
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:19,810
My, my sense of humor is too
fucked up. I've been too fucked up.

1500
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:24,660
And then I saw Kennison I went, oh, that's
comedy too. Oh, comedy doesn't just,

1501
01:24:24,661 --> 01:24:26,670
just has to be funny.
Like maybe I could do it,

1502
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:31,800
maybe I can do it. He was a, he was
going to all of those guys I liked.

1503
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:36,990
I liked Seinfeld dice.
Kinison car leaves.

1504
01:24:36,991 --> 01:24:38,850
What's the Carlin ones?
I liked all of those guys.

1505
01:24:38,851 --> 01:24:43,050
Like basically if you were
funny, you know, uh, I totally,

1506
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:44,550
I got into all of that shit,

1507
01:24:44,551 --> 01:24:48,050
but what made me think I could do
comedy was actually those VH one standup

1508
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:50,700
spotlights. Ah, towards the end,

1509
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:55,320
towards the end when guys were
doing like their fifth one,

1510
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:58,140
just scraping the bottom of the barrel.

1511
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:03,150
And I remember this guy I worked with,
we used to,

1512
01:25:03,151 --> 01:25:07,000
uh, before we'd go out, we drink
beers in his room, you know,

1513
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:08,550
I go over to his house, hey, you know,

1514
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:12,240
misses whatever and we fucking go in his
room and you know, to save money for,

1515
01:25:12,241 --> 01:25:13,650
we go out and try to hit on chicks.

1516
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:16,590
We'd fucking weed drink like
a six pack or something.

1517
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:21,210
So he was in the stand up the way I was
and we'd fucking watch it. So fucked up.

1518
01:25:21,211 --> 01:25:25,070
We would get legally drunk and
then get in the car to go drive.

1519
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:29,070
This was like the late eighties and
nineties. It just what you did. And um,

1520
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:33,270
we use have breathalyzers back then.
Yeah.

1521
01:25:33,271 --> 01:25:36,960
They just for stud that came out in
somewhere like the late eighties or

1522
01:25:36,961 --> 01:25:39,710
something like that,
something like that. But I,

1523
01:25:39,711 --> 01:25:43,290
I had the total fucking classic,
you know,

1524
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:47,760
Boston upbringing where it ended with
the fucking Dui and all of that shit.

1525
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:51,060
Did you get a Dui? Yeah, it's been
a fucking couple hours in jail.

1526
01:25:51,061 --> 01:25:53,370
My Dad came down and got me out and says,
does that fuck with you now?

1527
01:25:53,371 --> 01:25:56,310
If you tried to get into Canada now,

1528
01:25:56,311 --> 01:26:00,450
because it doesn't officially show up
on your record until you get the second

1529
01:26:00,451 --> 01:26:04,190
one. That's how it worked in the state
I was in. And then, uh, the second

1530
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:08,510
one, then it says you got to, but what it
would fuck with this my pilot's license.

1531
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:12,350
Like if you get a Dui, you'd
done silver rail. Yeah,

1532
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:17,090
you had done so you got to solve it. Now
guys, can I take this thing up? Yeah.

1533
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:20,420
Landon clown to somebody's fucking
house. No, you can't do it,

1534
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:24,980
but you can get a pilot's license. You
can now, even though you have a Dur.

1535
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:28,610
Yeah. Wait, but I mean it's not
on officially on the record. Yeah.

1536
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:31,970
So if you had the second one,
if I just got one.

1537
01:26:31,971 --> 01:26:34,340
I think once you're a licensed pilot,
if you just get one, you just say,

1538
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:37,340
just take it away. It's gone.
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

1539
01:26:37,341 --> 01:26:40,800
That's a fucked up thing to do when
you're drunk. Didn't like Patrick Swayze.

1540
01:26:40,801 --> 01:26:43,940
You do that and he crashed his
plane trunk and then fucking run.

1541
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:47,450
Didn't he do that like towards
the end? I'm pretty sure. Well,

1542
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:52,010
I mean if there's ever a time to
leave the scene, I think he was,

1543
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:56,910
I think it was when he had cancer. I
think like when he had cancer, just said,

1544
01:26:56,930 --> 01:27:00,380
well fuck it. Let's just, let's just
burn this baby down to the core.

1545
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:04,250
I think he decided to
just go out guns blazing.

1546
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:09,030
He did. He didn't quit smoking already.
He really went out like, uh, you know,

1547
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:12,260
I can't, I didn't see all the things
he did, but he wouldn't stop smoking.

1548
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:13,890
He's like, I don't give a shit. Yeah.

1549
01:27:13,891 --> 01:27:17,070
I think he just decided I was just
burning out. Just ride that bitch,

1550
01:27:17,071 --> 01:27:21,300
run into the rocks. Just take that, which
is his right. Yeah. I think, you know,

1551
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,600
that's how he wants to go. Well,
if you don't do that, yeah,

1552
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:26,570
you die eventually
anyway. Right. You know,

1553
01:27:26,571 --> 01:27:30,460
why not end the game when you
want to end it? I don't know.

1554
01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:35,390
That's fucking hardcore fatal
fucking diagnosis and just be like,

1555
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,550
I guess what drinking,

1556
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:40,970
it's hard to imagine that you wouldn't
just try to clean your life up,

1557
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:42,860
try to soak some more life out,

1558
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:48,370
start eating Kale and doing yoga
and going on a juice cleanse.

1559
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:52,640
But the phonyness of it, you'd
probably be like, this isn't me.

1560
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:57,200
I'm just doing this because of, well shit.
He likes smoking and you like drinking,

1561
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:02,130
you know Christopher Hitchens, I mean
he, he died the same way. I mean, I,

1562
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:06,470
I don't think he tried to clean himself
up, you know, without us. I know the name,

1563
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,180
a famous intellectual,

1564
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:12,730
very famous atheist
English guy and brutal,

1565
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:17,270
a brutally honest and uh,
articulate gentleman,

1566
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:21,400
wrote some great books.
He also had that socially he was,

1567
01:28:21,410 --> 01:28:25,430
if he had that fan of Vanity Fair
article, women aren't funny. Then, uh,

1568
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:29,960
backed it up with a video explaining why
the women that are funny or all butchy,

1569
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:33,470
they're all like men because women
don't need that sort of, that,

1570
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:35,690
that sort of skill.
In order to attract men,

1571
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:38,910
all they have to do is be nice and we
like them, but men need that. It's,

1572
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:41,720
it's pretty interesting because it
got a lot of people pissed off. Oh,

1573
01:28:41,721 --> 01:28:44,390
I remember that. I
remember that. Yeah. Yeah.

1574
01:28:44,391 --> 01:28:47,660
He's like one of the four
horsemen of atheism. He's like a,

1575
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:51,020
like one of the more famous of the
atheist with Dawkins and Sam Harris.

1576
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:54,680
He seems like that guys like one of those
guys that gets a feather in your cap

1577
01:28:54,681 --> 01:28:58,160
if he goes to your party. Oh
yeah, for sure. Social Lights.

1578
01:28:58,161 --> 01:29:00,730
I was always fascinated by that.
Like you could make a living doing it.

1579
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:03,780
I was social life. Yeah. It's
just really great. At parties.

1580
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:06,210
So you just invite them and they,
what do you know?

1581
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:09,240
Anybody that's an artist that's involved
in like the art scene where they have

1582
01:29:09,241 --> 01:29:12,630
like art galleries and people go to
galleries and you have to like become

1583
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,430
friendly and Hob hobnob and these social
circles with people that have died,

1584
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:19,230
aren't I fucking hate that shit.

1585
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:23,010
I can't even tell you
how much I hate museums.

1586
01:29:23,011 --> 01:29:27,620
If it's a car museum or if it's
got some tanks and shit, let me go.

1587
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:29,910
I'm like a little kid. If it's
stuff like that, I like it,

1588
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:31,410
but I don't look at a bunch of old place.

1589
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:36,150
You know you should go to the
La County Museum of art. LACMA.

1590
01:29:36,151 --> 01:29:40,380
I think it's going to let Ella. Yeah,
it's the fucking worst. The fucking worst.

1591
01:29:40,381 --> 01:29:42,690
They have a box,
a plexiglass box,

1592
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:47,010
an empty box on the ground and that's
a piece of art. It's roped off.

1593
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:50,550
You can't go near it. You can't touch it.
And I go, what is that? Is that the art?

1594
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:54,720
That's the art. Yeah. I go,
well, what is it? Well, it's
supposed to represent space.

1595
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:59,550
It's the artist's representation of the
spaces and capsuled and you just sort of

1596
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:01,050
with your own imagination,

1597
01:30:01,051 --> 01:30:03,870
you decide what's in it and
you own a magnate imagination,

1598
01:30:03,871 --> 01:30:07,440
you create it cause he's not going to,
yeah, let's, let's shit, there's one,

1599
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:09,930
one giant wall of videos and the videos,

1600
01:30:09,931 --> 01:30:13,200
it's like a guy throwing a basketball
to another guy and then another one,

1601
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:17,640
there's a guy who pulls a chair out of a
away from a desk and sits down and then

1602
01:30:17,641 --> 01:30:20,250
another one a got plops down on a couch.
It's just nothing.

1603
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:21,570
It's just people doing shit.

1604
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:25,070
But it's all on like a bunch of different
videos that are spliced together on a

1605
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,540
big wall and like this
is art, this is art. Oh.

1606
01:30:28,541 --> 01:30:31,650
And those big fucking canvases
where they didn't draw anything,

1607
01:30:31,651 --> 01:30:34,140
they just scribbled all over the place,
shit on it.

1608
01:30:34,141 --> 01:30:37,560
Just put paint on their chest and
rolled around on it and it's just like,

1609
01:30:37,561 --> 01:30:41,430
yeah man, it's so bad. Yeah.
I don't get any of that.

1610
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,710
Like what does that say to you?
What does it say it it's like,

1611
01:30:43,711 --> 01:30:46,590
I don't know that it looks like the shit
I used to draw when I was five years

1612
01:30:46,591 --> 01:30:49,130
old. My mother would put it on
a refrigerator. You know what?

1613
01:30:49,131 --> 01:30:53,190
We didn't know how to draw anything. You
just take every marker, Zigzag with it.

1614
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,990
You know Bob Kirsch is guy ones, the gross
agency. I went to a party at his house,

1615
01:30:57,991 --> 01:31:02,920
he's got a house in Mount,
um, um, with Aspen, you know,

1616
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:07,200
Colorado with rich ski town, Beautiful
House. I mean fucking staggering house.

1617
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:10,020
And he had this piece on the
wall and I literally said,

1618
01:31:10,021 --> 01:31:11,730
it's is something this kid made like,

1619
01:31:11,731 --> 01:31:16,560
cause it was framed and tell them
it's awesome. Can they go? No,

1620
01:31:16,561 --> 01:31:20,700
no, this is a food. You
have goals. They go,

1621
01:31:20,701 --> 01:31:24,000
that's like $25,000. I go, you've
got to be fucking shitting me.

1622
01:31:24,001 --> 01:31:28,980
This is just cost $25,000 or whatever
it costs. It was so stupid luck.

1623
01:31:28,981 --> 01:31:32,820
And it was like a bunch of pieces of
paper that were crumpled up and painted

1624
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:36,510
different colors and they were glued onto
a piece of paper. Oh Dude. It's, it's,

1625
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:41,130
it's bullshit. Fucking bullshit.
Total bullshit. But why,

1626
01:31:41,131 --> 01:31:42,720
why do people buy into it?
What is it?

1627
01:31:42,721 --> 01:31:46,410
Because what makes that art and
the difference between of a kid?

1628
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:50,040
Because a kid can't sit here and
draw you how you sit. Right, okay.

1629
01:31:50,041 --> 01:31:53,670
But those guys can and they
choose not to. That's, that's,

1630
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:59,720
that's what's in the brochure as to why
that's the brochure as far as like their

1631
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,200
philosophy. Like they're
bored, man. Withdrawn.

1632
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:06,480
They didn't want to fucking
draw faces anymore. Yeah.

1633
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:09,430
So they want to fucking do some
abstract shit. It's like high,

1634
01:32:09,431 --> 01:32:11,020
but you got to kind of
keep the face there.

1635
01:32:11,021 --> 01:32:15,070
You want to drive like drawling some fun
house, Mirror look and face, that's fine.

1636
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:18,490
But if you just want to take every
color and your crayon box and just start

1637
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:19,480
scribbling around,

1638
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:24,740
I mean more if you can get some asshole
to pay 25 grand for that. All right,

1639
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:26,650
good for you. Good field. You know? Well,

1640
01:32:26,651 --> 01:32:30,410
how does one guy like that get
super famous? Like Jackson Pollack?

1641
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,350
He's a perfect example.
That guy just didn't even watch the movie.

1642
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:37,490
It was an interesting, I love Ed. I love
Ed Harris, but I didn't even see them.

1643
01:32:37,491 --> 01:32:40,350
I don't know anything about the gun.
I just don't give it.

1644
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:44,780
Somebody takes a paint brush and then
splatters. Yeah, it's shit. It's dog shit.

1645
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:47,660
But they sell for like 1 million bucks.
Like a,

1646
01:32:47,670 --> 01:32:50,450
an original Pollock is worth a
fuck load of money. You know why?

1647
01:32:50,451 --> 01:32:52,010
I think when you have shit like that,

1648
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:56,600
it makes people think that
you're intelligent. Worldly,

1649
01:32:56,810 --> 01:33:01,100
your culture and the colors, man. It's
like a, it's like a warm kind of thing.

1650
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:06,320
I don't get it. I don't get it, but
I do get it when people collect cars.

1651
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,440
Like I went to Jay Leno's place.
If you've been at Jay Leno's place,

1652
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:14,300
I'll take you. You want to go? Yes. It's
the craziest shit ever. He has a leather,

1653
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:18,640
he has 11 buildings. What kind
of pie does he like? What?

1654
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:21,290
I bet he likes pumpkin.
The pumpkin smells wonderful.

1655
01:33:21,650 --> 01:33:24,740
He's got 11 buildings filled with cars.
The Dad,

1656
01:33:24,741 --> 01:33:27,470
I totally get like if you're gonna
spend your money on shit that,

1657
01:33:27,471 --> 01:33:30,110
I told him he could have his own
traffic jam on the four. Oh fuck.

1658
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:31,610
He could have his,
I mean,

1659
01:33:31,611 --> 01:33:35,240
it's legitimately better than any
car museum I've ever seen in my life.

1660
01:33:35,330 --> 01:33:39,530
I've been to the, what's the big one
off of a set off libray Anderson.

1661
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:42,200
Is that the Peterson? Yeah, I've
been to the Peterson. It's very nice.

1662
01:33:42,290 --> 01:33:45,950
Nothing you can't fuck with Jay Leno. Jay
Leno has got way more, way more space,

1663
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:47,570
you know,
as a sick car collection.

1664
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:53,000
A Ralph Lauren doesn't unbelievable.
Like they were doing a thing one time.

1665
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:57,960
Uh, they were having this debate, our
cars art. So the whole thing was, uh,

1666
01:33:58,010 --> 01:34:01,280
they were taking Ralph Lawrence
or our fuck you say his name?

1667
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:03,920
He said Lauren Lorenda
rain. Lauren. Ralph Lauren.

1668
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:08,490
Wait, no, he's probably
fucking Italian. Um,

1669
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:14,690
they fucking, we're trying to figure out
how to get his cars into this museum.

1670
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:17,600
It was one of those museums in New York.
Can we get up to the second floor?

1671
01:34:17,601 --> 01:34:22,590
So half the documentary was
about, you know, just the,
the physical endeavor, the,

1672
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,590
the physics involved with the crane.

1673
01:34:24,591 --> 01:34:27,650
They had to create to get these fucking
cars into this museum without damaging

1674
01:34:27,651 --> 01:34:30,350
other pieces, without
ruining the integrity of the
structure and all that shit.

1675
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:34,790
But in the process they were showing his
fucking cars and did a brief interview

1676
01:34:34,791 --> 01:34:39,510
on him on how he comes, you know, how we
get to ideas for his clothing line. Um,

1677
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:43,210
off of like the lines of like,
these dude he had all like,

1678
01:34:43,211 --> 01:34:47,470
it was all like Ferraris, Lamborghinis
like, Oh wow, look at that deck.

1679
01:34:47,471 --> 01:34:51,550
Whatever the fuck that is. I mean it's
just like old and old Jaguar I think,

1680
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:53,970
but I don't know what it isn't that
the, what is it on the back, right?

1681
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:57,440
What is it you, the whole website for
it, Ralph Lauren car collection com.

1682
01:34:57,460 --> 01:35:00,770
All right, so flip through a couple of,
yeah, if you don't mind. No, please do it.

1683
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:02,340
Whoa. What the fuck is that? Yeah,

1684
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:07,360
it's all like Gotti [inaudible] 1938
and it's all like pristine that Bentley

1685
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:12,590
1929 Bentley.
God.

1686
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:16,640
Well wait till you get towards newer
shit. Really? That mercy. Hold on.

1687
01:35:16,641 --> 01:35:21,260
Backups to that Mercedes.
Look at that thing. 19 Whoa,

1688
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:25,280
look at that. It's
amazing. 1930 count count.

1689
01:35:25,290 --> 01:35:27,320
Trossy oh that's the sound of the engine.

1690
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,440
Oh you click on and you get the Sally
and this is why their tanks were better

1691
01:35:30,441 --> 01:35:33,900
than ours. Look how pretty that
are shit. 1930s it's like, oh God.

1692
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:37,140
Oh God,

1693
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:46,610
whoa. Look at that thing. An Alfa
Romeo from 31 that's fucking beautiful.

1694
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:50,690
And the whole thing is, it's all mint
condition too. Like if they have like,

1695
01:35:50,691 --> 01:35:54,380
you know those old leather straps said
held down the hoods like Oh dad's not

1696
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:59,270
even like a piece of thread hanging out
of it. Look at this fucking 55 Mercedes.

1697
01:35:59,271 --> 01:36:01,760
Yeah, those are worth of baby
boomers. Paid like over a billion.

1698
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:05,240
Like $1 million for those. The
gullwing Leno's got one of those. Oh,

1699
01:36:05,241 --> 01:36:08,930
he's got everything. I've watched almost
every video on that Jay Leno's garage.

1700
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:12,440
It's amazing. It's fucking
garage is amazing. No,

1701
01:36:12,441 --> 01:36:15,690
cause he's got the sickest cars and he
knows about him and he brings people in.

1702
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:19,600
You know, he had like Carroll Shelby
in there and just rest his soul. Yeah,

1703
01:36:19,610 --> 01:36:20,450
he's got everything.

1704
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:24,440
Jay Leno's got several cars that are
worth more than a million dollars and he

1705
01:36:24,441 --> 01:36:25,520
keeps him at the airport.

1706
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,630
But the Burbank airport because homeland
security guards the airport and he's

1707
01:36:29,631 --> 01:36:32,420
like, if alarm goes off, they
fucking move in with tanks.

1708
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,940
Like they don't fuck around.
That's amazing.

1709
01:36:34,941 --> 01:36:38,090
That Ferrari click on that for are you
just had right to the right of that write

1710
01:36:38,091 --> 01:36:41,780
to the right of that. Look at that.
God, look at that fucking thing.

1711
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:45,650
1962 gen is one of those, I read
this book one time called the limit,

1712
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:51,260
the limit. And it was about, uh, the
first American Formula One racer,

1713
01:36:51,290 --> 01:36:51,770
uh,

1714
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:54,910
that one that won the Formula
One championship and that
they would just talking

1715
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:58,610
all this shit that they Ferrari would do.
Like if you had like a,

1716
01:36:59,450 --> 01:37:03,260
for some reason,
like if you're going to race in the race,

1717
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:04,330
they had to make a space,

1718
01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:09,350
a certain amount of the cars available
to the public too. Oh, it be hopped up.

1719
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:13,970
So what they did was they were acquired
to make a hundred of this one car and

1720
01:37:13,971 --> 01:37:15,890
classic Italian.
What they did was they,

1721
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:20,990
they just started numbering them at like
63 and they only made like 37 of them.

1722
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:24,170
Now the car is like super, super
rare. They just acted like that.

1723
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:26,750
They made 100 of them cause they didn't
come down and check it out. They're like,

1724
01:37:26,751 --> 01:37:31,310
yeah, there's 67 there's 83 there's
number 100 over there. All right,

1725
01:37:31,311 --> 01:37:32,900
see you later.
No one ever said,

1726
01:37:32,901 --> 01:37:37,070
where's number one through fucking 50 or
what are they started number like they

1727
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:40,900
dig knocked off like 40 some cars.
But uh, the book, the limits, unreal.

1728
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:43,460
Like just as far as the fatalities do.

1729
01:37:43,461 --> 01:37:46,220
These guys have become a flying by and
like the crowd be standing on the side of

1730
01:37:46,221 --> 01:37:49,280
the road behind a rope and some of them
would get hit and they just go into the

1731
01:37:49,281 --> 01:37:51,740
crowd and just kill people.
Oh look up.

1732
01:37:51,741 --> 01:37:54,950
Dak count by von crash
or something like that.

1733
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,840
They have is fatal accident
on the fuck on Youtube.

1734
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,610
He just goes into the crowd with his car,
takes out a whole row of people.

1735
01:38:02,611 --> 01:38:03,480
He's still alive.

1736
01:38:03,481 --> 01:38:06,900
And he ricochets back out and said the
track gets t boned and then I think

1737
01:38:06,901 --> 01:38:09,840
ejected from the car. I'm not sure,
but the, the, the American guy,

1738
01:38:09,841 --> 01:38:13,310
when he got his first Ferrari,
oh, hey, go watch this

1739
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:18,280
to the crowd and killed.
Yup.

1740
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:24,060
What's the slow motion? Oh,
this is a, from the SPEC.

1741
01:38:24,061 --> 01:38:28,620
Somebody who died, that
person died. Jesus Christ.

1742
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:30,270
Well,
those cars,

1743
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:33,690
they're so primitive and the way they
can handle and the way they moved and

1744
01:38:33,691 --> 01:38:38,190
broke, like when you, when you lost, I
think that's him flying out on the left.

1745
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:41,910
That might be him getting thrown from
the car. Dude, they got another one.

1746
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:45,000
They got, oh dude, they got some
sick. It was that him laying there.

1747
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:48,970
Fuck Dude. This some sick
ones. There was like a,

1748
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:53,230
this one guy who went to a spin in his
fucking hood came off and Doug went to

1749
01:38:53,231 --> 01:38:54,630
the crowd like a Chinese star.

1750
01:38:54,631 --> 01:38:57,870
And just like the capitated a whole
row of people like that shit like that

1751
01:38:57,871 --> 01:38:59,730
happened.
Um,

1752
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:03,450
did you ever see Lamon the Steven
Queen Steve McQueen movie there is,

1753
01:39:03,451 --> 01:39:07,920
you saw him laying in the road.
These are all the spectators and shit.

1754
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:11,610
All the people that got
killed. Yup. That's horrific.

1755
01:39:11,611 --> 01:39:16,460
Look at that guys limp arm hanging
onto the stretcher. Yeah, no it's uh,

1756
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:18,810
so anyways, so the American
guy, when he first gets the car,

1757
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,420
the last driver had just died in it and
there was a fucking hole drilled through

1758
01:39:24,421 --> 01:39:28,290
the floor pan because the guy got the
capitated and like bled out in the car.

1759
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:32,050
So they just drilled the hole in the
bottom of it and drained it out and we'd

1760
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,800
talk about primitive.
You'd think that at least weld that over,

1761
01:39:34,801 --> 01:39:37,890
cause you wouldn't want the air to get
in it for like that extra a hundredth of

1762
01:39:37,891 --> 01:39:41,400
a second. But they just, that's
how he got the car. Whoa.

1763
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:46,710
That's a fucking sick book. Do they
drained it through a hole in the floor?

1764
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:51,150
Well it was so much blood in them. You
know, Jesus Christ books called the limit.

1765
01:39:51,710 --> 01:39:54,030
I've got to yet it did you
see Steve Mcqueen, that movie?

1766
01:39:54,031 --> 01:39:56,130
Lamanda have you seen
that? Long, long time ago.

1767
01:39:56,131 --> 01:39:58,410
It was like the eight o'clock movie.
Good fucking movie.

1768
01:39:58,470 --> 01:40:01,470
They don't even talk for like the first
10 minutes of the movie. It's amazing.

1769
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:04,560
They go through all these things. People
do things. They're just doing stuff,

1770
01:40:04,561 --> 01:40:06,990
setting things up. Nobody
talks. It's amazing.

1771
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:09,480
It's like those old movies
was just so different.

1772
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:11,730
So different with what
they could get away with.

1773
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:14,480
Like the attention span that people had.
You know?

1774
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:18,120
It was a little booklet that I saw
bullet recently too. That's another one.

1775
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:21,690
It's like long scenes where no one's
talking like there's this whole chasing

1776
01:40:21,691 --> 01:40:24,770
which Steve McQueen is running after
this guy in the airport. No one talking.

1777
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:29,040
Yeah, just one thing after another thing
and it's just, it's kind of realistic.

1778
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:31,980
It's just, it feels different. Feels
different than what you're watching today.

1779
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,190
I liked that old shit.
Although I'm trying to get into new shit.

1780
01:40:35,191 --> 01:40:38,610
I'm sick of being the guy that likes
old shit because it's such a pain in the

1781
01:40:38,611 --> 01:40:43,590
ass to keep it going. I get
home, I got old drum kits.

1782
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:47,830
I got an old truck.
I bought this old lighter at a,

1783
01:40:47,831 --> 01:40:51,030
sent it to some guy from Michigan.
This stuff, the old stuff is,

1784
01:40:51,090 --> 01:40:53,480
there's something about it
that you just can't like

1785
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:57,700
new things are cool. Like a Tesla.
Those are cool. They're cool to drive.

1786
01:40:57,730 --> 01:41:01,180
They're cool. It's new. But
that 1968 truck you have,

1787
01:41:01,450 --> 01:41:04,450
there's something about that too. Oh
it's cool. But we know what it is.

1788
01:41:04,451 --> 01:41:07,120
You know what sucks is when
somebody fucking, you know,

1789
01:41:07,121 --> 01:41:10,360
you just how much I have to slow
it down just to go around a turn.

1790
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:13,300
I just feel like it's not like that
the suspension is so primitive on it.

1791
01:41:13,301 --> 01:41:15,130
Like I feel like it's
gonna it's gonna tip over.

1792
01:41:15,131 --> 01:41:19,180
So would you consider putting a modern
suspension on it or would you want to

1793
01:41:19,181 --> 01:41:23,980
keep it original? Um, I for the longest
time when it, cause then when I got it,

1794
01:41:23,981 --> 01:41:26,140
it was all original three on the tree,

1795
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:30,130
a drum brakes all the way
around the original radiator,
the whole fucking thing.

1796
01:41:30,131 --> 01:41:32,180
So since then I put an
aluminum radiator in,

1797
01:41:32,181 --> 01:41:36,610
cause those old ones ran a little hot.
Titus, uh, showed me how to do the front.

1798
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,950
He basically did the breaks,
but I did one side,

1799
01:41:38,951 --> 01:41:40,410
he was just telling me what to do.
So we,

1800
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:42,790
I put it yourself really
disks on the front. Yeah.

1801
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:46,170
Tightness is a fucking nut with
that shit. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. No,

1802
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:51,130
he's a born to do it man. He's just,
he's fucking great at. Um, but then,

1803
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:54,880
um, so you change the brakes,
change that. Yeah. But then,

1804
01:41:54,910 --> 01:41:59,020
but then what happened too was I needed
leaded gas and it was a fucking pain in

1805
01:41:59,021 --> 01:42:02,320
the ass and somebody had put too much
unleaded and I put a little unleaded in

1806
01:42:02,321 --> 01:42:04,330
there. And what ended
up happening was, uh,

1807
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:09,220
the vows got little gunked up and uh,
ended up cooking the valve.

1808
01:42:09,221 --> 01:42:10,360
So I just said fuck it.

1809
01:42:10,361 --> 01:42:13,330
And we rebuilt the whole thing ice
and let's say we extend it to a guy,

1810
01:42:13,331 --> 01:42:16,660
he rebuilt the thing from the crank
shaft all the way up to the carburetor.

1811
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,970
And uh,
they came with the auto light to barrel.

1812
01:42:18,971 --> 01:42:20,770
I now have a Holley four barrel on it,

1813
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:22,930
which is cool cause the
barrels are actually smaller.

1814
01:42:22,931 --> 01:42:25,000
So when I'm just cruising around,
I get better gas mileage.

1815
01:42:25,001 --> 01:42:28,240
But if I step on it and
get that extra, yeah. Yeah.

1816
01:42:28,410 --> 01:42:33,310
So you get from a four barrel.
Yeah. So it's um, I love,

1817
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:36,820
I, I like fast and loud too. One of
my favorite fucking shows I watch,

1818
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:38,470
I watch all of those shows.

1819
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:42,450
So many of those shows that are
trying to be fast and loud. Yeah.

1820
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:45,190
So it was just like, I just wish that
they would, you know, cause you know,

1821
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:47,710
it's television, they're like,
all right, this is the formula.

1822
01:42:47,711 --> 01:42:48,880
We got to have this guy,

1823
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:52,210
we've got of the Richard Rollins guy and
then we got to have the level, you know,

1824
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:56,800
it's just, I, I wish they would just
be themselves and like, you know,

1825
01:42:57,370 --> 01:42:59,170
everybody builds different types of stuff,

1826
01:42:59,171 --> 01:43:01,270
but like [inaudible] at it like an artist,

1827
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:04,240
they're looking at it like they're just
trying to make widget. Yeah. Yeah. Like,

1828
01:43:04,241 --> 01:43:07,030
well these widgets or selling, if you
make them orange and this side, it's like,

1829
01:43:07,031 --> 01:43:11,590
I was devastated when that paint Guy Casey
left. I was like, fuck I, I see left.

1830
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:14,230
Yeah.
Shit as you make it fun of me

1831
01:43:16,230 --> 01:43:20,860
now he left, but he did. He, when
they let him, when they let them,

1832
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:23,860
when they let him do his fucking thing,
he did a lace top one time.

1833
01:43:23,861 --> 01:43:26,770
That was the shit. He did another
one. Then they'll make an a low rider.

1834
01:43:26,771 --> 01:43:30,970
Like when they would let him rather
be like painted green, paint it black,

1835
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,690
you know? Uh, like I really wished that
he had done more. They'd let them do more,

1836
01:43:34,691 --> 01:43:37,540
like to tone shit and stuff.
I like,

1837
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:41,220
that's funny.
It's funny because you're,

1838
01:43:41,221 --> 01:43:44,780
you get upset at your wife watching
Bravo or if you're watching this guy,

1839
01:43:44,781 --> 01:43:47,470
I would appreciate it if he
did more as a fucking artist.

1840
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:51,980
He's not some fucking horror
walking around making a
porno. They go, how dare you.

1841
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:56,930
You know what if I had some place to go,
I'd walk out on this podcast right now.

1842
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:59,930
I just turned my phone on
because I want to show you this.

1843
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:04,160
I bought this thing cause I'm also
a fan of old movies, so I'm free.

1844
01:44:04,161 --> 01:44:08,890
Bogarts one of my favorite favorites
and I was watching this thing, um,

1845
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:10,683
on a,

1846
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:14,330
the Maltese Falcon and
he's got this thing,

1847
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:18,170
this cool thing that beginning when he
goes to light the fucking cigarette. Yeah,

1848
01:44:18,190 --> 01:44:20,330
it's it. Yeah, I know what
I thought it was a match.

1849
01:44:20,331 --> 01:44:23,210
He stuck in there and I thought it
struck it, but it's actually, it's a,

1850
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:26,510
it's a metal one with like a little bit
of Flint or something on the end of it.

1851
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:29,120
It's called a Ronson touch tip lighter.
And I actually,

1852
01:44:29,121 --> 01:44:34,121
I bought one and found a guy in Michigan
that rebuilds the whole things for you.

1853
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:38,040
Really? Yeah. I got this things
foolish shit. Jimmy Polish it up.

1854
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:42,710
Ronson touch tip lighter. Yeah. Oh,

1855
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:44,680
here it goes. This is from
the movie that, yeah. Yeah.

1856
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:48,610
All right, now watch you watch. Just
say Humphrey Bogart. Maltese, Falcon.

1857
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:52,400
Good. And uh, I guess lighting
is, Oh, that's it right there.

1858
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:54,160
Okay.

1859
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,090
Yeah.
I want you to say,

1860
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:02,630
Huh? How fucking cool is that? I just saw
that. It was like, what is that thing?

1861
01:45:02,631 --> 01:45:05,360
I got to get one.
Do you use that to light cigars?

1862
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:06,440
Yeah,

1863
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:08,000
I have it more just as a show piece.

1864
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:09,710
Every once in a while I
got a real cigar smoker

1865
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:13,280
comes over. Um, I, I'll be like,
oh, you want to see some cool.

1866
01:45:13,281 --> 01:45:15,320
And I'll actually break it out.
The real cigar guys though,

1867
01:45:15,321 --> 01:45:18,640
they want to use a lighter.
They don't, they want to use uh,

1868
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:21,170
a match that's a would match.

1869
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:24,080
And then they want to light a
piece of Cedar and then they light.

1870
01:45:24,081 --> 01:45:27,560
So none of the chemicals and to the end
of it, they get really crazy with it.

1871
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:29,120
Absolutely they do.
Yeah.

1872
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:33,640
I have a locker with my business
manager at a, one of those, uh,

1873
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:37,220
schmancy places. Yes, I do.
I've had one for 10 years.

1874
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:41,540
I've got the same Cuban cigars in there
for 10 years. Anytime you want to go,

1875
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:46,460
let me know. All right, here we go. The
Havana Room. Here it is. Oh really? Yeah,

1876
01:45:46,461 --> 01:45:49,070
I'll definitely go.
Let's go. So here it is.

1877
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:50,990
Yeah.

1878
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:55,760
Oh Wow. That is pretty cool.
His neck. Now, does it put
any flavor on the cigar? No.

1879
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:58,810
No. Not that I could tell, but I'm not
the greatest when it comes to that.

1880
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:04,100
I like it. So, uh, all I know that if
you get, if you find a real cigar smoker,

1881
01:46:04,101 --> 01:46:06,860
they think it's the shit they did. They
have all these different ones out there,

1882
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:10,220
but I got some cigars here with a dried
out there from that Michael Dowd Guy

1883
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:13,720
who's from that. Um, the documentary,
the seven five, they just,

1884
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:16,120
we just left him here. We didn't
put them in a human door. Peanut,

1885
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:19,010
that documentary is depaulo toward,
turned me onto it.

1886
01:46:19,011 --> 01:46:23,960
It's a crazy documentary about police
corruption in like the 1980s in New York,

1887
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:28,790
like during the crack epidemic
and a, these guys are just
fucking addict control,

1888
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,370
just completely out of control.
It's a crazy documentary,

1889
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:34,610
but the one guy keeping all the money
and Shit, oh, just not just that,

1890
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:35,750
just robbing people,

1891
01:46:35,751 --> 01:46:39,470
being involved in drug deals and
just could just fucking insanity.

1892
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:40,730
But one of the guys,

1893
01:46:40,731 --> 01:46:44,660
Michael Dowd just got out of jail a few
years ago and they put together this

1894
01:46:44,661 --> 01:46:48,500
documentary and uh, you know, now
he's, he does podcasts and shit.

1895
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:50,100
And he came on.

1896
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,850
And you know, it's funny when you
go to jail for some serious shit,

1897
01:46:53,851 --> 01:46:56,160
when you get out,
there's like two jobs you can get.

1898
01:46:56,161 --> 01:46:59,190
It's either you can get into sales,
you can like sell cars,

1899
01:46:59,191 --> 01:47:02,340
they don't give a fuck. Or you get
into entertainment cause or like,

1900
01:47:02,350 --> 01:47:04,740
or you go back to crime.
But Dude,

1901
01:47:04,741 --> 01:47:08,460
you could literally come out from
a double murder for some reason.

1902
01:47:08,490 --> 01:47:12,240
They let you out. You could just
go sign up for a fucking open mic.

1903
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:16,250
And it's like, no, there's no background
check. He does. You're in show business.

1904
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:17,560
That's true.
Yeah.

1905
01:47:17,561 --> 01:47:20,650
I've never heard of anybody coming out
of jail for murder and going into, uh,

1906
01:47:21,070 --> 01:47:22,030
into comedy.
Have you?

1907
01:47:24,190 --> 01:47:28,060
Well, there's a, there was that one guy
who, uh, I don't know his fucking name.

1908
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:33,220
He would, I want to say he
was on, uh, the fuck show.

1909
01:47:33,221 --> 01:47:35,560
Was he on him and him being on Letterman?
They were talking about,

1910
01:47:35,561 --> 01:47:37,180
he got into a fight
and he killed somebody.

1911
01:47:37,181 --> 01:47:40,430
He went to jail and then
he got out and was, uh,

1912
01:47:41,690 --> 01:47:43,660
oh shit. Don King, Don King,

1913
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:46,490
donkey and killed two people.
I have them in one.

1914
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:48,830
I know he beat somebody to
death. Yeah. One of them,

1915
01:47:48,831 --> 01:47:51,520
I think he was acquitted for one of them.
I think they just,

1916
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:55,370
they decided it was like self defense
and then the other one was a manslaughter

1917
01:47:55,371 --> 01:47:58,750
charge. He beat some guy to
death that owed him money like a,

1918
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:02,870
when he was a loan shark, I think he
stomped him to death. I interviewed him,

1919
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:05,570
I interviewed him for the UFC.
He was true.

1920
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,190
I don't even know if it ever got anywhere.

1921
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:10,430
I don't know if the UFC ever did
anything with it cause I never saw it.

1922
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:14,990
But it was a crazy interview man. He just
doesn't answer questions like you go,

1923
01:48:14,991 --> 01:48:19,370
okay, so what was it like, you know, Blah
Blah Blah. He'll go only in America can.

1924
01:48:19,371 --> 01:48:24,371
A man of my fortitude in magnitude
and cum laude had come down from,

1925
01:48:24,531 --> 01:48:28,720
what would deal with today is
equality between the racism,

1926
01:48:28,730 --> 01:48:32,800
the sexism and women
today does suppress it. I,

1927
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:36,560
I'm a feminist. Like he's like,
he's got this crazy thing,

1928
01:48:36,561 --> 01:48:40,550
he's covered with flags and he's
dripping with diamonds. I go,

1929
01:48:40,610 --> 01:48:42,320
I mean like covered with gifts

1930
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:45,550
since one man show. Yes. It's
amazing how grades and it keeps,

1931
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:50,070
keeps calling don kick.
Yeah. Piece of shit. Oh,

1932
01:48:50,410 --> 01:48:53,460
was me under a million die. He sounded
like a comic. Talking about club owners,

1933
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:56,400
that fucking piece of shit. He
fucked me on this Gig. You know,

1934
01:48:56,401 --> 01:48:57,480
you never forget either.

1935
01:48:57,850 --> 01:49:00,680
Oh, I'm $100 million. Is that what he
owes him? Something like that. Who knows?

1936
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:02,450
Who knows?
But I asked him like,

1937
01:49:02,451 --> 01:49:05,990
what is it with all the gold look was
not gold and platinum or white gold is

1938
01:49:05,991 --> 01:49:07,040
just covered in diamonds.

1939
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:10,550
Just got like literally like hundreds of
thousands of dollars in diamonds on him.

1940
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:14,840
And he's like, that's for the ladies.
The ladies love it. They love diamonds.

1941
01:49:14,841 --> 01:49:19,340
Diamonds are a girl's best friend. He
just got an anecdote in a, in a, you know,

1942
01:49:19,341 --> 01:49:23,030
a saying for every single thing.
He's just prepared and ready to go.

1943
01:49:23,150 --> 01:49:25,760
But you never get to the real guy.
You know,

1944
01:49:25,761 --> 01:49:28,750
you just get the show
like that at that time.

1945
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:33,140
But you don't ever get to the
real guts old school. Yeah.
Oh yes. Old School. Well,

1946
01:49:33,141 --> 01:49:37,360
he's as old school as it gets. He's his
old school was a guy. Kills people. Yeah,

1947
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:40,070
we did. There was a fucking
loan shark. Well, there you go.

1948
01:49:40,130 --> 01:49:43,400
I want to talk to you about Madison Square
Garden. You did Madison Square Garden.

1949
01:49:43,401 --> 01:49:47,410
What the fuck was that like?
Oh, it was amazing. It was
fucking awesome. It's crazy.

1950
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,870
I got my money's worth because we,

1951
01:49:49,871 --> 01:49:52,900
I rented a drum kit and some amps
and me and my friends came in.

1952
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:57,190
Guys from the Goddamn comedy jam,
we came in and Ben Bailey,

1953
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:58,450
which is hilarious because I wanted,

1954
01:49:58,451 --> 01:50:01,180
me and Ben have been trying to get
together to play for fucking ever.

1955
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:04,360
And I find like, Hey, I'm in New York.
You want to come and play? He goes,

1956
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:07,750
Ben Bailey, Ben Bailey,
cash cab, cash cab.

1957
01:50:07,751 --> 01:50:10,600
Now you don't want you to stand
up comedian in New York guy.

1958
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:14,140
He never lived out here.
So, um, what's cash cab?

1959
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:18,640
Cash cab was a TV show where like you'd
think you would get into a taxi cab and

1960
01:50:18,641 --> 01:50:21,760
then, uh, you got it and all of a sudden
you weren't like a game show. Oh really?

1961
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:24,130
Yeah, and I asked him about it
go, did anybody ever get pissed?

1962
01:50:24,131 --> 01:50:26,230
Because they were going to the airport
and he'd laugh. He'd go all the time.

1963
01:50:26,231 --> 01:50:28,120
They were like, dude, what the
fuck? I don't got time for this.

1964
01:50:28,121 --> 01:50:29,230
I thought this was a real cab,

1965
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:32,770
but he had to get like his real taxi
light hack license and all that type of

1966
01:50:32,771 --> 01:50:35,940
Shit's really interesting that
the whole thing. But anyway,

1967
01:50:35,941 --> 01:50:40,941
so we went in there like fucking from
like two 30 to four in an empty Madison

1968
01:50:41,470 --> 01:50:44,290
Square Garden. Like we just
fucking played all this arena rock,

1969
01:50:44,291 --> 01:50:48,490
motley Crue guns and roses
and film some of it. Sure.

1970
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:51,920
What are you gonna do with it? Oh,
it's just for me, man. I says, oh,

1971
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:54,050
you gotta be shut on
youtube now saw it said,

1972
01:50:54,051 --> 01:50:58,030
we can tell me I suck at my hobby
because it's a horrible people who like,

1973
01:50:58,031 --> 01:51:00,100
you will think that's fun to watch a guy,

1974
01:51:00,101 --> 01:51:03,970
they'd like doing something that he always
dreamed of. I'll say, I want to see it.

1975
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:07,600
I'll show you some pictures. I
want to see it. Um, it, what is it,

1976
01:51:07,601 --> 01:51:10,510
like 14,000 people in there,
something like that.

1977
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:15,580
But what was cool cause I went in there
and we played there that it wasn't

1978
01:51:15,581 --> 01:51:16,221
intimidated.

1979
01:51:16,221 --> 01:51:20,280
Like I felt like I kinda got in there and
I got the feel for the room. Ha. Right,

1980
01:51:20,281 --> 01:51:23,560
right, right. And um, and when I went up,

1981
01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:26,260
I see the lights were in my eyes,
so I couldn't,

1982
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:30,910
I couldn't really see anybody, so
it wasn't bad. It was weird dude.

1983
01:51:30,911 --> 01:51:34,960
I was oddly not nervous and I went up
and I had a great time. I was like,

1984
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:40,480
after we played, I went
back to, um, I went back to,

1985
01:51:40,481 --> 01:51:43,420
uh, showing them pictures
right now. That's awesome.

1986
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:48,790
A smile on your face. Oh
yeah. Oh that looks so cool.

1987
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:52,240
So yeah, it just went back
to my apartment, you know?

1988
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:57,070
Right after that you keep harming
in New York. Got, yeah. Do you,

1989
01:51:57,550 --> 01:51:59,980
how often do you know why I bought
a place back there long time ago.

1990
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:03,940
And you just leave it there? Well,
I had a tenant for awhile. Uh,

1991
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:07,750
I was renting it out to de Derosa and
then once he left it's like I don't want

1992
01:52:07,751 --> 01:52:10,660
to deal with having somebody else
like I got to think paid off.

1993
01:52:10,661 --> 01:52:13,930
It makes me a local hire.
If I ever get acting work,

1994
01:52:13,931 --> 01:52:15,310
they don't have to put me up in a hotel,

1995
01:52:15,311 --> 01:52:17,830
although that's never fucking worked
out for me. I never get a kid.

1996
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:21,460
Everything shot in like fucking New
Orleans now. I'm trying to find this.

1997
01:52:21,461 --> 01:52:25,090
There is a,
there is a clip here somewhere.

1998
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:28,840
We just had, we just had the best
time at was. It was fucking awesome.

1999
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:32,200
I'll play it for you when it's off
the year. That sounds like a fun gig.

2000
01:52:32,370 --> 01:52:36,790
It sounds like it's one of those gigs.
It's like get an iconic place to perform.

2001
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:40,290
It's not just a regular
place. Yeah, no. See it's,

2002
01:52:40,291 --> 01:52:42,700
it's definitely totally
lived up to the hype,

2003
01:52:42,701 --> 01:52:45,110
but I went up there and
I did 90 minutes do it.

2004
01:52:45,111 --> 01:52:48,170
I did all of my jokes and I said at
one point that I wasn't going to leave.

2005
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:50,140
I didn't feel like leaving,
but I did record it.

2006
01:52:50,170 --> 01:52:54,080
I'm going to do something
with the recording of it.
I don't know what yet. Um,

2007
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:57,830
like an audio recording or video? Just
audio. Not the video thing. I just,

2008
01:52:57,890 --> 01:53:01,450
I don't know. It's just little
me on that giant stage, you know,

2009
01:53:01,470 --> 01:53:03,620
the fucking 200 foot curtain
behind you just don't,

2010
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:08,280
it looks good. Um, did they have
screens up so people could see? Yeah,

2011
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:12,080
yeah, they had all of that.
So it was, uh, it was,

2012
01:53:12,110 --> 01:53:14,690
it was fucking awesome and a wire to wire.

2013
01:53:14,691 --> 01:53:17,660
I had the best time Derosa and
Versie opened up for me to,

2014
01:53:17,661 --> 01:53:22,661
Rosa had this fucking old lady
sweater that he had on and it was,

2015
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:26,960
it was bugging me when I was backstage
and then he was just up there and nobody

2016
01:53:26,961 --> 01:53:27,830
heckled them for it.

2017
01:53:27,831 --> 01:53:30,590
So I just went on stage the first day
that there was just shit on what he was

2018
01:53:30,591 --> 01:53:32,840
wearing. So it was very like, you know,

2019
01:53:32,841 --> 01:53:36,560
comedy club kind of vibe
and the people would just,

2020
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:42,050
they would just in it from, uh, from
the second I got on there and I, I,

2021
01:53:42,051 --> 01:53:46,700
uh, yeah, I just woke up the next day.
There was no let down. There was nothing.

2022
01:53:46,701 --> 01:53:49,850
I was like, that was fucking awesome.
I did every joke I wanted to do.

2023
01:53:50,030 --> 01:53:51,520
I can't believe I got to do that.
It was,

2024
01:53:51,521 --> 01:53:56,420
it was totally a one of the
most satisfying things I
ever did and I, you know,

2025
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,360
and then, you know, the next
time I did stand up, you know,

2026
01:53:58,361 --> 01:54:01,580
it was from like fucking 20
people down at the comedy store,

2027
01:54:01,581 --> 01:54:02,270
but there wasn't like

2028
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:06,170
that old no wood over the dumb shit. I was
just like, oh this is never that. Right.

2029
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:09,350
Cause I know, I know what's what
it fucking write some more shit.

2030
01:54:09,530 --> 01:54:11,930
That's the thing about comedy
as opposed to I think music too,

2031
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:15,500
is that we always have to be, you always
have to perform. You've got to keep,

2032
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:18,430
keep banging on it. You always
have to keep coming up new stuff

2033
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:22,450
like you, Chris Rock, Louis, you know,

2034
01:54:22,451 --> 01:54:25,330
it's a handful of guys that
never stopped doing the clubs.

2035
01:54:25,331 --> 01:54:29,380
I even think those guys that once they
get there following where they just,

2036
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:32,500
you know, work out this shit
in front of their own crowd.

2037
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:36,850
I think that even then that makes it
hurts you a little bit because if you go

2038
01:54:36,851 --> 01:54:40,900
down to like the comedy store,
you know, as much as somebody,

2039
01:54:40,901 --> 01:54:43,120
if they're a fan of comedy,
might know who you are,

2040
01:54:43,330 --> 01:54:45,790
there's going to be a bunch who don't
and there's can be people and it's all,

2041
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:49,030
you know, and the, and the energy is going
to be different. They don't feel like,

2042
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:51,520
oh, I paid to see Joe Rogan.
It's like, oh cool, he's here.

2043
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:55,420
And then after they get over the
five minutes, then it's like, ah,

2044
01:54:55,421 --> 01:54:56,680
it's a different,
you know,

2045
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:00,260
it's more difficult as opposed to if
you're just doing your show and you're a

2046
01:55:00,261 --> 01:55:01,300
headliner tonight.

2047
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:05,970
Yeah. I did a Melbourne a of weeks
ago and Melbourne's fucking great.

2048
01:55:06,020 --> 01:55:09,710
That's awesome. And uh, I did the
comics lounge on Friday night. My,

2049
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:12,150
my theater shows were on Saturday night,
but you know,

2050
01:55:12,151 --> 01:55:14,970
they have that comedy club in
town. And uh, we called up,

2051
01:55:14,971 --> 01:55:17,760
let them know we're coming in. And
they gave us a spot, me and uh,

2052
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:21,860
Hinchcliffe and it was fucking great
because nobody had any idea it was coming

2053
01:55:21,870 --> 01:55:22,200
there.

2054
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:27,200
They weren't necessarily fans of mine and
I got just just fresh packed crowd and

2055
01:55:27,870 --> 01:55:31,650
I had legitimate response to your
material. Yeah. That's awesome.

2056
01:55:31,651 --> 01:55:35,280
I also feel like there's something about
knowing that the people aren't there to

2057
01:55:35,281 --> 01:55:38,450
see you. It puts you in a different
state of mind. Like you, you're,

2058
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:42,120
you're more like, you tighten
everything up. You know, you, you,

2059
01:55:42,330 --> 01:55:43,560
you Polish it a little bit.

2060
01:55:43,561 --> 01:55:46,320
You make sure that your delivery's a
little sharper because you want to make

2061
01:55:46,321 --> 01:55:47,630
sure you let them know,
you know,

2062
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:50,160
like that feeling that you would
get when you first started,

2063
01:55:50,330 --> 01:55:54,010
when when you'd open up you'd have to
open up strong because these people like,

2064
01:55:54,011 --> 01:55:55,710
who is this fucking,
you know,

2065
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:58,500
like you had to open up strong
and then once you got, um,

2066
01:55:58,530 --> 01:56:01,710
you get a get a couple laughs, then they
get a little confidence in your head.

2067
01:56:01,710 --> 01:56:04,410
This guy's pretty funny and then
you could kind of carry it on.

2068
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:07,650
So I kind of felt like that I kind
of felt like coming out of the gate,

2069
01:56:07,651 --> 01:56:12,210
like I had to have some good shit right
away, you know? I think that's important.

2070
01:56:12,211 --> 01:56:14,670
I think that's important
to do those random things.

2071
01:56:14,671 --> 01:56:18,000
You just show up at these places
and random soft if you don't. Yeah,

2072
01:56:18,090 --> 01:56:21,840
definitely get soft. So I know a lot of
guys, they don't, they don't go anywhere.

2073
01:56:21,841 --> 01:56:24,870
They just work out new material in
the middle of their theater sets.

2074
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:29,010
Oh yeah. I mean, I don't know
how they do. I'm on a roll,

2075
01:56:29,011 --> 01:56:32,170
I'll fucking throw something out there
like anybody. But like I, you know,

2076
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:36,450
the great thing coming up in the Boston
scene was you got to see at a very high

2077
01:56:36,451 --> 01:56:40,290
level what killing is.
And I just, you know,

2078
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:43,860
it has just a lot of guys I've run into,
like wherever they came up,

2079
01:56:43,861 --> 01:56:47,130
well I don't know what the headliners
were doing there, but Boston was like,

2080
01:56:47,131 --> 01:56:49,590
you know, death. Yeah. It
was like, it sounded like a,

2081
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:52,530
like a fucking train was
coming through the, yeah,

2082
01:56:52,590 --> 01:56:56,310
there were Nazi would stock it on a row.
Gavis Sweeney and those guys,

2083
01:56:56,311 --> 01:56:57,790
when they would get on a fucking roll

2084
01:56:57,950 --> 01:57:00,350
to this day, people don't
know. They don't know.

2085
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:03,830
It's hard to go and you watch the
youtube clips and you go, I don't see it.

2086
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:06,890
You had to be there in like 1989.

2087
01:57:06,980 --> 01:57:10,730
You had to be there when the thunder was
happening and those guys were just on

2088
01:57:10,731 --> 01:57:13,720
the top of their game that people
get tired of me talking about on this

2089
01:57:13,780 --> 01:57:17,230
pod. Duty was fucked up. Those
almost like a height requirement to,

2090
01:57:17,231 --> 01:57:20,890
they were all like six, two, six,
three, all of those guys, Lenny,

2091
01:57:21,670 --> 01:57:24,520
all those guys are like
at least six foot tall.

2092
01:57:24,521 --> 01:57:26,550
They were just a big fucking guys.

2093
01:57:26,870 --> 01:57:30,200
Men. They were like, they would
punch you. They would do coke.

2094
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:33,390
Yeah. Yeah. Those stories of, uh,

2095
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:37,450
Lenny punched somebody out one time
cause he stole his joke. I get offstage.

2096
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:40,510
He broke his fucking nose and then
went up and closed out the show.

2097
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:44,010
Yeah. Lenny was an animal. He
was one of the first guys I,

2098
01:57:44,011 --> 01:57:47,280
the first time guy worked for, were
open for our, we're open for, um,

2099
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:49,980
Warren Mcdonald. Who was, um,

2100
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:53,580
what was the car we used to fucking do
the open mic night? Bill Macdonald? No,

2101
01:57:53,820 --> 01:57:56,610
who's his name? [inaudible]
Michael. Michael McDonald.

2102
01:57:56,850 --> 01:58:00,420
He had the same name as the s and guy
with the ponytail. No, it wasn't him.

2103
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:02,880
George George MacDonald.
Yes.

2104
01:58:02,881 --> 01:58:05,910
George McDonald used to host the open
mic night and his brother Warren took me

2105
01:58:05,911 --> 01:58:08,340
on the road with him one night.
That was the first time I ever got paid.

2106
01:58:08,341 --> 01:58:11,100
The second time I ever got paid it
was opening for Lenny. How's that?

2107
01:58:11,101 --> 01:58:15,080
Jay's in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.
She ever worked for normal, the phone.

2108
01:58:15,090 --> 01:58:19,380
Would you ever do any of those gates
feels that way out? Yeah. It's north.

2109
01:58:19,381 --> 01:58:24,230
Northwest. Yeah. Kind of. Yeah. Not
quite like Amhurst way, but like, uh,

2110
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:27,720
it was fucking Boone. Dot. But it
was a great gig. It was a great gig.

2111
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:31,950
I fucking loved gag. That gig was so
far and we're doing lean mass. Lee,

2112
01:58:31,951 --> 01:58:34,740
Massachusetts, I think for Jeff
[inaudible], Jeff Apotheker,

2113
01:58:36,180 --> 01:58:39,360
you just call up his bespoke.
They called up answering machines.

2114
01:58:39,390 --> 01:58:42,790
Answering machine would just go
like you've reached Jeff Apotheker

2115
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:47,290
know that you've reached a master
of ceremonies, Jeff apothecary,

2116
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:51,410
nothing like that. And you like you like,
you know, hey, my name is Bill Murray.

2117
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:57,310
I got 10 clean minutes. I can do 50
you know, trying to get you your spot.

2118
01:58:57,311 --> 01:59:00,520
So he booked me in Lee,
Massachusetts.

2119
01:59:00,521 --> 01:59:04,480
I remember it was exit to off the mass
pike and I went out there and it was the

2120
01:59:04,481 --> 01:59:06,580
biggest fucking hell Gig I ever did.

2121
01:59:06,581 --> 01:59:11,581
It was this restaurant area and the
next to it was a function where bachelor

2122
01:59:11,831 --> 01:59:15,370
party was going on and there was no
door between their Roman and where I was

2123
01:59:15,371 --> 01:59:16,204
doing comedy.

2124
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:20,530
So I was standing on stage and these
guys started gathering from the Bachelor

2125
01:59:20,531 --> 01:59:25,531
party and just seeing this
fucking redheaded jerk off
the baby face bombing in

2126
01:59:27,281 --> 01:59:31,780
front of three people eating chicken pot
pie. And I was looking over, I was like,

2127
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:35,050
I didn't get what was going on because
that was so dumb. I was just like,

2128
01:59:35,051 --> 01:59:37,810
hey guys, you want to come into
the shows? Plenty of seats.

2129
01:59:37,870 --> 01:59:41,410
I don't know why I got to stand over
there. Right. And I fucking looked away.

2130
01:59:41,411 --> 01:59:43,180
And then I just heard,
boom.

2131
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:48,010
I turned around and saw me throw this
fucking dinner roll like 90 miles an hour

2132
01:59:48,011 --> 01:59:51,970
at me and just miss me. And I looked
and they were all gone. And, uh,

2133
01:59:52,030 --> 01:59:55,360
then I was on the mic, you
know, I snapped, you know,

2134
01:59:55,361 --> 01:59:58,210
as you always do when you're like that,
and I forget what the fuck I was saying,

2135
01:59:58,211 --> 01:59:59,230
a bunch of shit about them.

2136
01:59:59,231 --> 02:00:03,970
And then they started gathering at the
door and I was finishing my set and I was

2137
02:00:03,971 --> 02:00:05,980
like, these guys are gonna
beat the fuck out of me.

2138
02:00:06,610 --> 02:00:09,910
And I'm looking at the owner now.
The owner told me before I went on stage,

2139
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:14,470
he goes, he goes, yeah. Um,
or the bartender says, he
goes, yeah, this is the owner,

2140
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:18,070
you know, he also does stand up comedy.
And I was like, really? And he goes,

2141
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:21,370
he can guy goes, yeah. He goes, I got
like two and a half hours, their material.

2142
02:00:22,210 --> 02:00:24,550
I go, yeah, two and a half hours.
He goes, yeah, and I have to,

2143
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:27,820
tonight I'll have about three.
So I thought he was fucking with me.

2144
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:29,500
So as I'm standing on stage,

2145
02:00:29,501 --> 02:00:33,250
after they throw the fucking dinner
roll and shit and they're gathered over

2146
02:00:33,251 --> 02:00:33,911
there,
whatever,

2147
02:00:33,911 --> 02:00:37,000
I'm trying to go back into my act and
I look out in the crowd and I finally

2148
02:00:37,001 --> 02:00:42,001
noticed it in the owner is sitting there
writing down what I'm saying on stage.

2149
02:00:44,020 --> 02:00:45,430
And so long story short,

2150
02:00:45,431 --> 02:00:49,570
I ended up leaving get off stage
and I was just failing them.

2151
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:53,230
Like to the side of me as I
was getting paid by this guy,

2152
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:56,440
they all I had to do was look at them
and they were going to beat the fuck out

2153
02:00:56,441 --> 02:00:59,560
of me was one of those things
where I had to literally just,

2154
02:00:59,650 --> 02:01:03,040
I so wanted to just tell
him to go fuck themselves.

2155
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:05,470
But I mean I would have probably lost the
one of them. I'm not the best fighter,

2156
02:01:05,471 --> 02:01:05,811
but I,

2157
02:01:05,811 --> 02:01:10,660
I was fucking enraged and I just remember
getting into my fucking 83 Ford ranger

2158
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:14,380
driving out of there, yelling at them
as they went on the like, fuck yeah,

2159
02:01:14,381 --> 02:01:19,381
you fucking got all high pitched and
just driving home screaming at the my

2160
02:01:22,271 --> 02:01:24,640
windshield as I was driving home.

2161
02:01:24,641 --> 02:01:29,000
What the fuck out of a fucking owner
has a fucking batch party and you're

2162
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:31,300
writing down my material,
ted, a total meltdown,

2163
02:01:31,810 --> 02:01:33,490
driving home and I had to be back up,

2164
02:01:33,730 --> 02:01:36,040
back at work the next day at
like seven in the morning.

2165
02:01:36,041 --> 02:01:41,030
But what got me through it was I came
home that night and I either called Dane

2166
02:01:41,031 --> 02:01:46,031
or Patrice rest his soul and I told
the story and they were just laughing,

2167
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:49,430
which just may, you know, just brings you
back down. And then the guy, you know,

2168
02:01:49,431 --> 02:01:52,340
I had this gig and this happened and
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But like,

2169
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:57,020
that's probably the closest I ever came
to getting into at least wine to get

2170
02:01:57,021 --> 02:02:00,500
into like forgetting that I didn't know
how to fight. You know what I mean? Like,

2171
02:02:00,620 --> 02:02:03,610
you know what I mean? I mean, I could
do some bullshit, but I mean I'm,

2172
02:02:03,611 --> 02:02:05,840
there's no way I'm taking on
fucking five fucking guys.

2173
02:02:05,841 --> 02:02:07,760
But I just remembered them standing there.
I remember,

2174
02:02:07,761 --> 02:02:10,520
I still remember the guy that threw the
rule and I still remember the smile on

2175
02:02:10,521 --> 02:02:11,354
his face.

2176
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:16,540
He was just like almost lustfully
wanting me to fucking say something so he

2177
02:02:17,181 --> 02:02:18,710
could just fucking beat
the shit out of me.

2178
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:22,730
And that would have been one of those
Boston beat downs where you somebody

2179
02:02:22,731 --> 02:02:26,270
fucking bite your ear off. But there
was always that story. Do a kid,

2180
02:02:26,271 --> 02:02:28,940
I went to fucking high school,
bit of Guy's ear off, oof.

2181
02:02:29,090 --> 02:02:32,570
He was biting is here and the guy pulled
his head away. God took that away.

2182
02:02:32,571 --> 02:02:33,710
I met another guy that,

2183
02:02:33,711 --> 02:02:38,000
another comic I knew had his fucking
tip of his nose broke bit off.

2184
02:02:38,060 --> 02:02:38,893
Oh fuck.

2185
02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:43,220
He got into a fight at some frat and he
fucking hit this guy right in the nose.

2186
02:02:43,221 --> 02:02:46,160
And the guys knows fucking explode in
his frat brothers grabbed them and they

2187
02:02:46,161 --> 02:02:47,600
wrestled to the ground.
And this dude,

2188
02:02:47,601 --> 02:02:52,520
he fucking did it to God got on his
chest and he goes payback's a bitch.

2189
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:56,660
And as they held him down, he fucking
bit the end of the guy's fucking knows,

2190
02:02:56,661 --> 02:03:01,010
oh my God. And that kid was a rich
kid. So when they sued him and shit,

2191
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:06,040
like they got like just enough money
to reattach the fucking the guy's nose.

2192
02:03:07,770 --> 02:03:09,800
Fuck yeah. That's why. That's why I,

2193
02:03:09,860 --> 02:03:14,560
those stories were always
fresh in my fucking head. It's
why I stopped. Uh, I mean,

2194
02:03:14,570 --> 02:03:18,680
I think like the last fight I had was
at somebody fucking Flint street hockey

2195
02:03:18,681 --> 02:03:20,510
yourself that,
so it was probably like junior high.

2196
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:24,380
But after that everybody hit a growth
spurt and that's when like blood and

2197
02:03:24,381 --> 02:03:27,110
missing teeth started coming into fights
and I was just like, you know what?

2198
02:03:27,111 --> 02:03:31,160
I think I'm going to stick with being
funny. I can, I don't, I don't have,

2199
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:35,330
I didn't have that. Uh,
despite my anger, I didn't,

2200
02:03:35,331 --> 02:03:39,230
I didn't want that to happen to me and I
didn't want to do it to somebody that I

2201
02:03:39,231 --> 02:03:41,720
really didn't have.
You saw enough of it does that,

2202
02:03:41,721 --> 02:03:46,721
that's Dale awful taste of violence
that just sticks with you for like weeks

2203
02:03:47,211 --> 02:03:48,080
after it happens.

2204
02:03:48,081 --> 02:03:51,650
It just shies away from ever being
involved in anything like that again,

2205
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:55,100
I avoided all that shit when I was
a kid. Yeah, it did. Definitely.

2206
02:03:55,101 --> 02:03:57,920
It changes you if you, uh, look,

2207
02:03:57,921 --> 02:03:59,660
if somebody is picking on
you and you knock them out,

2208
02:03:59,661 --> 02:04:01,880
I think that's fucking great.
I think you'd feel good about yourself.

2209
02:04:01,881 --> 02:04:04,910
But there's something about like,
uh, you know, you had just said,

2210
02:04:04,911 --> 02:04:07,640
I have friends that just,
their idea of a weekend was going out,

2211
02:04:07,641 --> 02:04:12,210
getting into fights dog, and you want to
go dog in this weekend dog. And I said,

2212
02:04:12,620 --> 02:04:13,670
that's what they used to call it.

2213
02:04:13,970 --> 02:04:17,630
They do this shit with everybody at a
chain in the 80s so all of a sudden when

2214
02:04:17,631 --> 02:04:19,610
shit was getting, you know, getting tense,

2215
02:04:19,730 --> 02:04:23,060
they'd all be taken the fucking chains
off and putting them in their pockets.

2216
02:04:23,061 --> 02:04:27,290
So they're big Z cabaret cheese.
It was fucking insane.

2217
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:32,330
And then they'd be like those 2020 on
20 on 20 fights and some chick would

2218
02:04:32,331 --> 02:04:36,260
always try to run in and it's always
get fucking blasted in the face and then

2219
02:04:36,261 --> 02:04:38,950
everybody would fucking right. It
was brutal. It was fucking, I'm not,

2220
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:43,050
not saying this is all my friends, this
was just, this was just the environment.

2221
02:04:43,820 --> 02:04:44,251
And I,

2222
02:04:44,251 --> 02:04:49,251
and I never noticed how fucked up it was
until about seven years after leaving

2223
02:04:50,281 --> 02:04:54,750
Boston and really spending long periods
of time away from there that I finally

2224
02:04:54,751 --> 02:04:59,751
came back and went into a bar and just
felt the vibe that that somebody's going

2225
02:04:59,911 --> 02:05:00,980
to get suckered vibe.

2226
02:05:01,630 --> 02:05:04,640
It's just like you just could fit.
And it was weird. You could just

2227
02:05:04,660 --> 02:05:06,130
feeling, it was just like, wow,

2228
02:05:06,131 --> 02:05:09,580
like I live in New York and New York
has like this fucking crazy thing about

2229
02:05:09,581 --> 02:05:12,880
riding subways and shit and the warriors
and you think all of that type of stuff.

2230
02:05:12,881 --> 02:05:16,790
But I don't feel that vibe in New
York. Like the thing of, well,

2231
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,780
I think the great thing about
New York is that everybody,

2232
02:05:18,820 --> 02:05:21,490
the writing of the subway
actually keeps it safer.

2233
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:24,850
I think the fact that everybody's mixed
in together, he had kind of, you know,

2234
02:05:24,970 --> 02:05:29,050
the fact that you're on foot, there's
no getaway car, there's none of that.

2235
02:05:29,051 --> 02:05:33,940
She kind of had to, you know,
be more civil. You had to
be a great word. Exactly.

2236
02:05:34,070 --> 02:05:38,770
It had to be more civil where that shit
where you can just fucking go fucking

2237
02:05:38,771 --> 02:05:41,530
nuts. Throw a bottle at somebody
then jumping your eyebrows

2238
02:05:41,620 --> 02:05:46,090
z and fish tail down the
street. Yeah, I see. Yeah,

2239
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:49,540
I've heard the first time I took
Ari to Boston, I took him to uh,

2240
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:52,030
to Faneuil hall when they had
the comedy connection up there,

2241
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:56,260
which is about the most pedestrian place
you could have taken him to and a still

2242
02:05:56,290 --> 02:05:58,690
filled with psychos. Oh yeah.
All the bars down there.

2243
02:05:58,691 --> 02:06:02,320
Phil with Psychos and like as we were
leaving, were walking to the hotel.

2244
02:06:02,321 --> 02:06:04,300
We're seeing fucking street
fights left and right.

2245
02:06:04,750 --> 02:06:07,840
They were waiting in line at Mcdonald's.
They just decided to get out of there.

2246
02:06:07,841 --> 02:06:10,870
They're like, this is too dangerous. We
gotta get Outta here. And then he goes,

2247
02:06:10,871 --> 02:06:14,170
you grew up here. I'm like, this is the
spot. This is, this is what it's like.

2248
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:18,170
They fight here, they fight here. It's
Philly. Philly's got a creepy vibe too.

2249
02:06:18,730 --> 02:06:20,380
Late night getting a steak and cheese.

2250
02:06:20,381 --> 02:06:23,650
You start feeling like somebody going to
catch one and it ain't going to be me.

2251
02:06:23,770 --> 02:06:26,830
I'm getting the fuck I'm going
to get this to go. What is it?

2252
02:06:26,831 --> 02:06:31,831
Is it the cold weather's a fucking people
that the ancestors of the people that

2253
02:06:31,871 --> 02:06:35,800
came over on boats, it's like they're
all stuck. I don't know. There's a,

2254
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:38,700
because to me, New York,
Philly, Boston, they're all,

2255
02:06:38,730 --> 02:06:43,680
there's a through line of Sameness
to those kinds of people. And uh,

2256
02:06:43,890 --> 02:06:48,660
but I, I think the thing that struck
me about New York was, you know,

2257
02:06:48,661 --> 02:06:52,290
they always started, Dave used to try
to equate it to the sports teams that,

2258
02:06:52,291 --> 02:06:52,550
you know,

2259
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:55,800
New York would win championships in
Boston other than the Celtics didn't.

2260
02:06:55,801 --> 02:06:58,740
But now that even though you know that
we fucking won like a zillion in each,

2261
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:03,790
like it still hasn't gone away.
It is a, there's a, uh, and I,

2262
02:07:03,791 --> 02:07:07,830
I what you were saying,
how you have to act more civil there,

2263
02:07:07,850 --> 02:07:12,510
there just is that thing in New York where
it's just everybody is like stuck in,

2264
02:07:12,550 --> 02:07:15,330
in tight quarters.
So there's a,

2265
02:07:15,390 --> 02:07:20,390
there's a level of a common courtesy that
you have to sort of abide by or you're

2266
02:07:22,681 --> 02:07:27,190
not going to survive. You can't
walk around being, you know,

2267
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:30,140
like those fucking guys late at night
when you're going to get it, that,

2268
02:07:30,150 --> 02:07:34,110
that slice, you know, to absorb
the alcohol so you can drive home,

2269
02:07:34,111 --> 02:07:37,720
which was so fucking nuts back then
like that. You weren't going to survive.

2270
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:41,980
You're not going to survive
doing that there. You're
just not going to. So people,

2271
02:07:41,981 --> 02:07:44,450
I feel like they behave more civilly,
but um,

2272
02:07:45,020 --> 02:07:48,550
sportspeople tried to make it about
the Yankees and red sox and how uh,

2273
02:07:49,830 --> 02:07:51,870
it was so funny to me. Like
they would say like, they,

2274
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:54,520
like Boston has an inferiority
complex. It's like, dude,

2275
02:07:54,730 --> 02:07:56,770
they don't even know New York exists.

2276
02:07:57,100 --> 02:08:00,340
You don't understand like the same way
New Yorkers are all about New York.

2277
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:04,390
The Boston is all about Boston. They
know New York in New York knows Boston,

2278
02:08:04,391 --> 02:08:07,480
but they don't know shit about each
other unless you've been there and live

2279
02:08:07,481 --> 02:08:11,140
there, you're not thinking about it.
You thinking about your life, you chick,

2280
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:12,153
your world

2281
02:08:12,290 --> 02:08:16,260
going look, you know? Yeah. I wish
we would world series like to, yeah,

2282
02:08:16,261 --> 02:08:18,830
you don't even think about it
until the playoff series happens.

2283
02:08:19,230 --> 02:08:21,480
So I, I think that that
whole thing was just like,

2284
02:08:21,481 --> 02:08:25,950
I'm a romantic version of it,
but I really just think of socially.

2285
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:30,920
When you have a city like uh, you
know, I mean, look at La Shit there.

2286
02:08:30,930 --> 02:08:33,840
Those have a fucking, every was in
cars. You don't talk to anybody.

2287
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:36,810
People are fucking shooting each other
on the freeways. There's that thing.

2288
02:08:36,811 --> 02:08:38,460
When you're in your car,
you just feel like,

2289
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:41,420
yeah, outside of your car, it's a movie.

2290
02:08:41,810 --> 02:08:44,300
It's not really happening and then
all of a sudden your car won't start,

2291
02:08:44,301 --> 02:08:47,140
and I was like, oh, this
is really happening. Also,

2292
02:08:47,150 --> 02:08:50,400
I think the separation of
the classes in New York is,

2293
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:53,120
is different because everybody gets
together on the subway. Rich people,

2294
02:08:53,121 --> 02:08:56,840
poor people, they're all together
walking down the street together in La,

2295
02:08:56,841 --> 02:08:57,670
there's none of that.

2296
02:08:57,670 --> 02:09:02,240
It's a very few interactions between
people from Beverly Hills and people from

2297
02:09:02,241 --> 02:09:07,100
Compton or people from east La. There's
none. Unless there's like a benefit.

2298
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:08,140
I'm

2299
02:09:08,140 --> 02:09:09,250
shit.
You know what I mean?

2300
02:09:09,251 --> 02:09:13,480
There's some political thing and
somebody down there that's 100% true.

2301
02:09:13,481 --> 02:09:17,500
This is a problem with his culture here.
There's a great fucking documentary,

2302
02:09:18,220 --> 02:09:21,250
which of course I don't
remember the name of it. Uh,

2303
02:09:22,210 --> 02:09:27,190
what's his face does the, um, forest
Whitaker does the voiceover for it.

2304
02:09:27,191 --> 02:09:31,200
I believe it's forced would occur and
it's just about the history of, uh,

2305
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:32,620
the crips and the bloods.

2306
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:37,090
But what's cool about us is it starts
off and it outlines the neighborhoods.

2307
02:09:37,091 --> 02:09:39,490
You know, you always hear Compton,
you hear Watsi here, all these,

2308
02:09:39,491 --> 02:09:43,090
but you don't really know where it
is. You know, it's south of whatever.

2309
02:09:43,091 --> 02:09:44,260
But they would,
when they would say it,

2310
02:09:44,261 --> 02:09:46,750
they'd show a map and then they
would outline the neighborhood.

2311
02:09:47,260 --> 02:09:50,680
But they just showed how,
like with like racism,

2312
02:09:50,681 --> 02:09:55,090
how they got where they got all African
Americans to live and just all the stuff

2313
02:09:55,091 --> 02:09:55,360
that bill.

2314
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:59,800
But it was a really interesting thing as
far as like neighborhoods in la because

2315
02:09:59,801 --> 02:10:03,310
La, when you come out here, I still
have to being out here for eight years,

2316
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:07,270
there's no center to the city.
It's just like,

2317
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:12,670
it's just this sprawling fucking
thing that makes no sense. You know,

2318
02:10:12,671 --> 02:10:16,840
like the original center of
La was supposed to be long
beach, which makes sense.

2319
02:10:16,841 --> 02:10:20,260
You'd want to have it on the water.
Really? Like most major cities. Yeah,

2320
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:22,690
like that's where it was
supposed to be like that.

2321
02:10:22,691 --> 02:10:27,070
Whatever that peer is out there that's
like the second or third largest one in

2322
02:10:27,071 --> 02:10:27,551
the world.

2323
02:10:27,551 --> 02:10:31,630
I think like just the amount of product
that goes in and out during the course

2324
02:10:31,631 --> 02:10:34,100
of the day,
so like the major downtown area

2325
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:34,821
was going to be there,

2326
02:10:34,821 --> 02:10:39,821
but it was just like la very subtly is
one of the most gangsta towns that there

2327
02:10:41,721 --> 02:10:45,950
is out there where it just everything out.
He was just like the water.

2328
02:10:45,951 --> 02:10:50,750
Everything is just some fucking CD
goddamn story and there's always like a

2329
02:10:50,751 --> 02:10:54,140
fucking decomposed body in every
fucking story. No matter what happens,

2330
02:10:54,141 --> 02:10:57,050
they don't give a shit. They just
pave over it. There's no plaques.

2331
02:10:57,051 --> 02:11:00,710
This nothing like our Robert
Kennedy got whacked here. Yeah.

2332
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:04,340
You would think like what
they did with Dealey Plaza,

2333
02:11:04,370 --> 02:11:07,490
which I actually think they
went overboard. They kept
the entire fucking plaza,

2334
02:11:07,491 --> 02:11:10,420
the exact same you walk, they feel like
in, in, in the Zapruder film. Weird.

2335
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:15,060
But like they do the ambassador hotel.
That's where he got whacked. Right, right.

2336
02:11:15,061 --> 02:11:17,690
That they took it down.
Yeah. We used to film a film,

2337
02:11:17,691 --> 02:11:21,110
fearful to say they used to film shit in
there and then I took that out and now

2338
02:11:21,111 --> 02:11:23,600
it's like condos or a school or something.
Something.

2339
02:11:23,650 --> 02:11:27,830
I think somewhere there's a little
plaque like, oh, by the way, by the way,

2340
02:11:27,831 --> 02:11:31,490
Robert Kennedy got killed here. We walked
through the kitchen where he got shot.

2341
02:11:32,020 --> 02:11:34,460
We were hanging around there
when we were filming there.

2342
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:36,710
We're just trying to figure out where
he got shot. We're like a thing.

2343
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:41,450
It was like right here. Yeah. They didn't
have it roped off. There was no memorial.

2344
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:45,770
Nobody gave a shit. Nope. Yeah. That,
that hotel was creepy. There was, it was,

2345
02:11:45,771 --> 02:11:50,210
it wasn't being used for like a long time.
It was just, uh, just for filming stuff.

2346
02:11:50,211 --> 02:11:51,650
There's a lot of those things like that.
You know,

2347
02:11:51,651 --> 02:11:55,640
the original La Times building was
a terrorist act. It was blown up.

2348
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:57,530
I forget why I was reading
this thing about it,

2349
02:11:57,531 --> 02:12:00,710
but like there's no information that
I can find on the Internet where the

2350
02:12:00,711 --> 02:12:04,460
original one is. There's no plaque
downtown. It's just it happened.

2351
02:12:04,461 --> 02:12:09,020
I it's all over. Clean it up.
Barium, let's just fucking move on.

2352
02:12:09,410 --> 02:12:13,220
Well I remember from a member of Sopranos
episode where they were talking about

2353
02:12:13,221 --> 02:12:17,750
how many actual shipping
containers they actually inspect.

2354
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:20,900
Like what a small percentage of
shipping containers and get inspected.

2355
02:12:21,230 --> 02:12:24,040
I thought about that more and
fear factor in Long Beach too.

2356
02:12:24,050 --> 02:12:28,220
Cause we used to film there all the time
and we used to be there and we just see

2357
02:12:28,221 --> 02:12:31,970
these gigantic ships coming and he's
cargo ships fill with these containers.

2358
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:35,600
I knew what the fuck was in each one of
those things and they were all right.

2359
02:12:35,601 --> 02:12:38,800
They're just coming in big giant,
giant.

2360
02:12:39,020 --> 02:12:43,430
Everything from bootleg
shit, drugs, blood diamonds,

2361
02:12:43,431 --> 02:12:48,100
people to work in fucking rub
and tug prostitutes. Yeah.

2362
02:12:48,290 --> 02:12:52,400
Yeah. All on these little weird little
boxes. Ellie's is a strange place.

2363
02:12:52,550 --> 02:12:55,610
Strange when you watch those old
movies about La, but it's also great.

2364
02:12:55,650 --> 02:12:59,090
I love it out here. It's amazing. It's
a great city, but I also love New York,

2365
02:12:59,091 --> 02:13:03,050
but I, I kind of learned that because the
first time I lived out air I hated it.

2366
02:13:03,051 --> 02:13:05,630
But I just learned that I was not going
to hate where I was going to live.

2367
02:13:05,631 --> 02:13:10,120
Like I was going to give it a fair
shot. You know what I mean? And uh,

2368
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:14,090
it's, you know, the driving is
obviously the worst part of it.

2369
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:17,840
Both the traffic and just how
fucking awful the drivers out here.

2370
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:22,340
They just so fucking then they're maniacs
on the highway and then when they get

2371
02:13:22,341 --> 02:13:26,420
off, it's like they took a plot
cookie, like making a right hand turn,

2372
02:13:26,421 --> 02:13:30,320
how fucking long it takes.
Or if somebody's car's just
a little in their lane,

2373
02:13:30,440 --> 02:13:31,800
how they have to stop.

2374
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:36,000
They can't just fucking drive around.
God forbid you fucking tires go into,

2375
02:13:36,070 --> 02:13:39,870
there's nobody coming. Just go. They
won't go. This is fucking unreal.

2376
02:13:40,290 --> 02:13:42,480
The terrible with the left lane.
That's a bad one.

2377
02:13:42,481 --> 02:13:45,450
Like people get in the left lane, they
never moved from a straight up terrible.

2378
02:13:45,930 --> 02:13:47,910
They just terrible.
It's unreal.

2379
02:13:47,911 --> 02:13:51,540
And then they get on the fucking highway
and they will drive past you a hundred

2380
02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:54,060
miles an hour, pass you on the
right and you're trying to get off.

2381
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:56,400
That's why he's supposed to pass on the
left cause people trying to get off.

2382
02:13:56,640 --> 02:14:00,150
You got to go like, like, do you want of
times people will flip me off. It's like,

2383
02:14:00,151 --> 02:14:02,910
dude, I'm trying to get off this fucking
thing. You passing me on the right.

2384
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:07,110
There's like no co I think because
people who like commute on the highway,

2385
02:14:07,111 --> 02:14:11,370
it's such a motherfucker every day that
if, if they see any bit of daylight,

2386
02:14:11,371 --> 02:14:15,510
they just pin it and try to go as far
as they can before they're going to come

2387
02:14:15,511 --> 02:14:19,820
to a dead stop again, just to deal with
their frustration. I Dunno. Yeah. These,

2388
02:14:19,821 --> 02:14:21,090
these, these are just all theories. Joe,

2389
02:14:21,390 --> 02:14:25,230
I think you could live in in New York
again or do you like living out here?

2390
02:14:25,890 --> 02:14:28,770
I could live in an outside of the city.

2391
02:14:29,150 --> 02:14:32,610
Once you get a house and you don't have
to worry about where I'm going to park.

2392
02:14:32,850 --> 02:14:34,380
I don't think people
never lived in a city.

2393
02:14:34,381 --> 02:14:39,120
Understand how fucking great
it is to just drive home,

2394
02:14:39,121 --> 02:14:43,980
pull into your driveway. Yeah. Right.
And just shut the fucking car off and go.

2395
02:14:43,981 --> 02:14:47,850
And now I am a, uh, I, no,

2396
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:49,800
I don't think I would
live outside of the city.

2397
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:54,360
I love New York and I'm like
Westchester or something.

2398
02:14:54,640 --> 02:14:57,960
Yeah, whatever. Some long island someplace
up there. I don't know. Long Island.

2399
02:14:58,140 --> 02:15:01,860
That's a whole, yeah, and there's
just a lot of meat heads out there.

2400
02:15:02,830 --> 02:15:05,940
I just, it's like you're either
fucking, yeah. You're either like,

2401
02:15:06,970 --> 02:15:10,360
you're either like a free mason or
you like the dumbest person ever.

2402
02:15:11,070 --> 02:15:15,420
That's my experience with long island
and that's doing like the comedy clubs or

2403
02:15:15,421 --> 02:15:17,130
like,
it's either like you're,

2404
02:15:17,131 --> 02:15:21,570
you got the money to live in the
Hamptons and like, you know, Tom Hanks,

2405
02:15:21,571 --> 02:15:25,920
is that your brunch every other
week or like Howard stern or, yeah.

2406
02:15:25,921 --> 02:15:30,060
You got these fucking, yeah. You either
got that kind of money or you're just,

2407
02:15:31,110 --> 02:15:33,990
I don't know some, you know, I
did a lot of hell gigs out there,

2408
02:15:33,991 --> 02:15:36,820
so I probably shouldn't judge it that way.
I did a lot of hell gigs long.

2409
02:15:36,980 --> 02:15:41,790
It's long island was brutal.
Jersey hell gigs in Long Island hell gigs.

2410
02:15:41,791 --> 02:15:44,550
I think we're worse than the ones that
I did in New England because at least in

2411
02:15:44,551 --> 02:15:47,190
New England I was part of
the same drinking water.

2412
02:15:48,130 --> 02:15:52,260
So it was the same meathead that we run
into when you went to fucking some gig

2413
02:15:52,261 --> 02:15:56,060
in western mass or up in fucking God
knows where in New Hampshire or something.

2414
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:59,730
Main Gate, all those, those
what all those am towns,

2415
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:04,710
Malden, Medford, all of those fucking uh,

2416
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,610
Somerville. Somerville now was
like Nice. Yeah, gentrified.

2417
02:16:10,650 --> 02:16:13,260
It used to be called Slummerville
when, when we used to do, yeah,

2418
02:16:13,261 --> 02:16:16,500
there's like hipsters and cupcake shops
and all that shit. That's it. Seriously.

2419
02:16:16,501 --> 02:16:20,070
There are handcrafted coffee,
but like a, yeah, like revere,

2420
02:16:22,230 --> 02:16:25,290
revere, all of those fucking
place. Those gigs were brutal.

2421
02:16:26,070 --> 02:16:29,590
Revere Road Rudel spot. That's one of
the most brutal spots still, I think.

2422
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:31,690
I don't think that place
has been gentrified.

2423
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:34,710
Malden, Medford, and
there was one other one.

2424
02:16:34,780 --> 02:16:37,930
I lived in Medford. They all, you
know, all on the same does it again.

2425
02:16:37,990 --> 02:16:40,530
I did gigs and Lynn
Lynn was a raw land too.

2426
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:44,110
I think Connecticut's the worst though
cause Connecticut's depressing to me.

2427
02:16:44,370 --> 02:16:48,050
Could it be like Massachusetts was okay
cause that's why I was living. It was no,

2428
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:51,580
it felt normal to me. Like even if it was
a hell Gig, I was like yeah, whatever.

2429
02:16:51,581 --> 02:16:52,414
It just sucks.

2430
02:16:52,510 --> 02:16:55,570
But there's something depressing about
Connecticut where like Connecticut always

2431
02:16:55,571 --> 02:16:58,180
feels like there's no hope.
Like he doesn't feel like a real estate.

2432
02:16:58,420 --> 02:17:00,700
It feels like a highway
between Boston and New York.

2433
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,940
And then these people just live it on the
highway and then it would come to gigs.

2434
02:17:03,941 --> 02:17:08,020
Like to this day, like I did, um,
one of the casinos a few years back,

2435
02:17:08,290 --> 02:17:11,710
we did a, you know, a weekend
at the casino and I was like,

2436
02:17:11,770 --> 02:17:15,250
I don't ever want to fucking do this
again. This is horrible. One of those,

2437
02:17:15,310 --> 02:17:19,420
one of those Indian casinos, I was
like, this place is fucking depressing.

2438
02:17:19,421 --> 02:17:20,790
These people are like legitimate

2439
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:25,550
do next time you stay in New York
and then you go to the west side,

2440
02:17:25,551 --> 02:17:26,780
you just chop her over

2441
02:17:28,030 --> 02:17:31,450
two it chopper over to Connecticut.
Yeah. You Chop chopper everywhere.

2442
02:17:31,460 --> 02:17:34,060
Need to be just a straight line.
Like if you went to New York,

2443
02:17:34,061 --> 02:17:35,560
would you rent a chopper and fly?

2444
02:17:36,130 --> 02:17:38,220
Uh, no. No I wouldn't.

2445
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:43,030
I wouldn't because I'm not familiar with
the airspace. Uh, familiar with like the,

2446
02:17:43,060 --> 02:17:46,200
the rate, the amount of work
that I would have to do.

2447
02:17:46,201 --> 02:17:50,700
And then also you can get lost up there
really easily. You know what I mean?

2448
02:17:50,701 --> 02:17:54,830
And plus you're also like, I mean, dude,
this three international airports, this,

2449
02:17:54,831 --> 02:17:59,010
so that's all bravo airspace,
psycho fucking what are you doing here?

2450
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:04,290
Right. The stuff. So when you like when
you transition like Bravo airspace over,

2451
02:18:04,291 --> 02:18:08,550
uh, by lax like this, like specific,

2452
02:18:09,270 --> 02:18:11,790
like rules of like hardcore,

2453
02:18:11,791 --> 02:18:14,970
like you have to say your whole tail
number and the guy has to repeat your

2454
02:18:14,971 --> 02:18:18,480
entire tail number. And if he
doesn't, you got to repeat,

2455
02:18:18,481 --> 02:18:21,510
you've got to say your hotel number. Just
making sure, you know, number three, two,

2456
02:18:21,511 --> 02:18:25,860
three Sierra hotel, you know,
clear to transition, you
know, 500 feet, supple, veto,

2457
02:18:25,861 --> 02:18:30,300
whatever. Right? But you know, you
go by regular fucking airports.

2458
02:18:31,010 --> 02:18:33,330
It's not that, but the level
of traffic that, that, I mean,

2459
02:18:33,331 --> 02:18:35,970
you're talking about you're in the
vicinity of something who had killed 300

2460
02:18:35,971 --> 02:18:39,600
people plus people on the fucking
ground. So it's like, yeah,

2461
02:18:39,630 --> 02:18:43,950
well I mean I look at it, if I did it
then fuck me. You know what I mean?

2462
02:18:44,190 --> 02:18:46,810
Cause I'm an idiot. I'm an
idiot who did it. So it's, it's,

2463
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:49,410
so if I was to rent something there,

2464
02:18:49,411 --> 02:18:54,180
and the other thing too is you have no
idea what's going on with that helicopter

2465
02:18:54,181 --> 02:18:58,200
either where I fly out of,
I fly the same place where I,

2466
02:18:58,201 --> 02:19:02,790
they taught me and those guys
a great school and you know,

2467
02:19:02,820 --> 02:19:07,820
the 90% of the flying of those helicopters
is basically done with an instructor

2468
02:19:08,971 --> 02:19:13,030
in there. So they're looking to make
sure they don't overspeed the main, uh,

2469
02:19:13,050 --> 02:19:15,570
the main road. Then that Yank
and the guts out of it basically.

2470
02:19:15,580 --> 02:19:18,390
Because what happens is
every like 2100 hours,

2471
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:22,020
those things are entirely taken apart.
And then rebuilt Greens.

2472
02:19:22,050 --> 02:19:23,470
Why they're so safe. Yeah. Do.

2473
02:19:23,471 --> 02:19:26,290
Then I just sit like you fucking
fly over people's assistance.

2474
02:19:26,300 --> 02:19:30,590
Some shitbox 200 hours
of flying. Wow. So yeah,

2475
02:19:30,591 --> 02:19:33,170
and the overhaul like is a,
is a zillion fucking dollars,

2476
02:19:33,171 --> 02:19:35,870
which is why if you ever look at a
helicopter like why is this thing only 30

2477
02:19:35,871 --> 02:19:39,050
grand? It's cause it's, it's
due for an overhaul. So,

2478
02:19:39,110 --> 02:19:41,780
and how much is an overhaul cost?
Like hundreds of thousands.

2479
02:19:41,781 --> 02:19:45,650
It all like a hundred. Yeah. It's like you
almost got to buy the thing again. Wow.

2480
02:19:45,720 --> 02:19:50,630
And so you have to do that every
2100 miles, 2100 hours, 2100 hours.

2481
02:19:50,631 --> 02:19:53,270
2100 hours of flight is a thing.

2482
02:19:53,271 --> 02:19:57,440
So if something has 1500 hours on it,

2483
02:19:57,740 --> 02:20:02,300
but somebody has been flying it like a
jerk off fucking Yank and the guts out of

2484
02:20:02,301 --> 02:20:05,420
the fucking thing is,
then what happens is,

2485
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:10,850
is that 20 to 100 hours where something
could go wrong now becomes 2000 hours or

2486
02:20:10,851 --> 02:20:13,220
$1,800 because the thing
about metal fatigue,

2487
02:20:13,790 --> 02:20:17,930
like a weld failing or something like
that is you can't see that until it

2488
02:20:17,931 --> 02:20:20,400
basically happens.
So if somebody is,

2489
02:20:20,580 --> 02:20:24,680
is flying it like an asshole and
they're not maintaining it, you know,

2490
02:20:24,710 --> 02:20:27,950
like if you give somebody a fucking
car and they change the oil,

2491
02:20:27,951 --> 02:20:30,470
keep it lubed up and all that
and they're not red lining it,

2492
02:20:30,830 --> 02:20:32,330
that car's going to last 10 years.

2493
02:20:32,331 --> 02:20:37,331
You give it to some fucking jerk off
and they just started up and step on it.

2494
02:20:37,880 --> 02:20:42,450
It's a shitbox within fucking
a couple of years so that you,

2495
02:20:42,470 --> 02:20:44,540
it's for me anyways,

2496
02:20:44,570 --> 02:20:49,570
like just the hours that are on it is
just the first thing I need to know.

2497
02:20:49,971 --> 02:20:53,780
Like I'd have to know the school, I'd
have to know who's been flying the flag.

2498
02:20:53,810 --> 02:20:56,540
There's no fucking way I would,
I, I wouldn't, I just went.

2499
02:20:56,840 --> 02:21:01,490
So do you own your own helicopter or you
rent one? You rent one. Aye. Aye. I rent.

2500
02:21:01,610 --> 02:21:05,120
I can't justify doing that. What? So I
can just fly over dodger stadium. Oh,

2501
02:21:05,121 --> 02:21:09,350
that was cool. And put it back down. You
know, I uh, you, you fly to gigs, right?

2502
02:21:09,351 --> 02:21:12,310
Like didn't you fly to San Diego
for a Gig? Yeah, I flew down.

2503
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:15,710
I flew down with an instructor because
I was the first time I was doing it,

2504
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:19,160
I wasn't familiar and he was handling a
lot of the radio and the calls and that

2505
02:21:19,161 --> 02:21:23,150
type of shit. But uh, but I flew the
thing and it was a affluent are 44,

2506
02:21:23,151 --> 02:21:25,010
which is a four passenger
is fucking awesome.

2507
02:21:25,170 --> 02:21:28,820
You go down there and does he come
with you to the Gig? Oh yeah. Yeah,

2508
02:21:28,821 --> 02:21:29,601
it was perfect kid.

2509
02:21:29,601 --> 02:21:34,310
Him and his brother came and then a
Kevin Shay wrote in the back and uh,

2510
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:37,070
they had a great fucking time and uh,

2511
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:39,500
it would've been cool if we could
have landed right at the venue,

2512
02:21:39,501 --> 02:21:42,380
but what it was was it was in like this
canyon area and there was a bunch of

2513
02:21:42,381 --> 02:21:43,010
high wires.

2514
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:47,300
And by the time we got out it was going
to be a nighttime and it didn't want to

2515
02:21:47,301 --> 02:21:49,830
fly out of that. So that was the
only sort of buzz kill. But like,

2516
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:54,410
it like flying at night, I got video,
dude. It's fucking unreal. It's really,

2517
02:21:54,411 --> 02:21:58,700
it's really, uh, it's a beautiful
thing, dude. Flying out over the ocean.

2518
02:21:58,701 --> 02:22:02,930
And just seeing the shit that's out there
that's left compared to what the fuck

2519
02:22:02,931 --> 02:22:03,500
we did to it.

2520
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:06,440
But like just the amount of times I've
flown out over there and I just see like

2521
02:22:06,441 --> 02:22:08,630
look down like what the fuck is that?

2522
02:22:08,631 --> 02:22:11,660
And then you look up a couple hundred
yards of somebody sitting on a surf board

2523
02:22:12,020 --> 02:22:13,910
waiting to catch a wave.
You want to be like, dude,

2524
02:22:13,911 --> 02:22:16,580
there's something that could swallow
you whole like what'd you see?

2525
02:22:16,850 --> 02:22:18,680
I don't know what it was.
I saw a shark or something.

2526
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:21,500
I don't know what I mean you're, it's
weird like when you're up high, like,

2527
02:22:21,501 --> 02:22:23,630
you know,
1500 feet of water when whales come up,

2528
02:22:24,050 --> 02:22:27,330
like when they're just right at surface
cause they're there body and obviously

2529
02:22:27,331 --> 02:22:30,510
all went, when the sun hits it, they
look like almost like glow sticks.

2530
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:34,210
It's really fucking weird.
Like almost like a, I dunno,

2531
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:36,870
what the fuck is it a caterpillar and
it glows one of those fucking glow and

2532
02:22:36,871 --> 02:22:38,520
things. That's what it looks
like. But when you download,

2533
02:22:38,521 --> 02:22:41,130
there's been a couple of times,
AH, and I've had buddies too.

2534
02:22:41,131 --> 02:22:43,890
I know a guy who was doing, uh, you know,

2535
02:22:43,891 --> 02:22:47,040
he was flying to thing out for a shoot
and then he's really yanking the guts out

2536
02:22:47,041 --> 02:22:48,210
of it, you know, just on that one flight.

2537
02:22:48,211 --> 02:22:50,070
But he said he fucking
was coming back around.

2538
02:22:50,071 --> 02:22:52,530
They were filming like a boat race
and he fucking came around like that.

2539
02:22:52,530 --> 02:22:54,540
You know, he was on his side.
He looked down, he went, whoa.

2540
02:22:54,541 --> 02:22:59,100
It was a big fucking great white
shark. Um, near the surface. I mean,

2541
02:22:59,101 --> 02:23:00,840
they weren't like real low to the
ground. I mean they were like, you know,

2542
02:23:00,841 --> 02:23:02,700
500 feet up,
but you can't miss,

2543
02:23:02,790 --> 02:23:07,790
you can't miss a 30 foot 25 foot
fucking a great white or some,

2544
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:09,860
I know I've now pick,
I've ever seen a great white,

2545
02:23:09,861 --> 02:23:13,710
but I've seen like you can't pull in.
Maybe it's cause we're up in the air.

2546
02:23:13,711 --> 02:23:15,480
It seems like it's closer to the coast,

2547
02:23:15,481 --> 02:23:20,270
but you can't believe what the
fuck is due. That's like live,

2548
02:23:20,271 --> 02:23:24,060
like no one would walk into the jungle.
You know what I mean? Cause I'd be like,

2549
02:23:24,061 --> 02:23:27,840
dude, this is like tigers and lions and
cobras. Sydney, I'm not doing this shit,

2550
02:23:28,050 --> 02:23:32,340
but the ocean is the water version of a
jungle and you're just walking into this

2551
02:23:32,341 --> 02:23:36,330
shit and your head, well, you fucking
eyes are where you can see everything.

2552
02:23:36,670 --> 02:23:38,420
Would you ever walk into a jungle?
Like you know,

2553
02:23:38,430 --> 02:23:40,170
I get when somebody finishes
their basement, you know,

2554
02:23:40,171 --> 02:23:43,470
you can like push ahead through those
tiles, but have one of those on your head.

2555
02:23:43,710 --> 02:23:46,320
You can't see where you're going
and just walk into the jungle.

2556
02:23:46,321 --> 02:23:50,580
You would never do that to the ocean is,
is absolutely fucking terrifying to me.

2557
02:23:50,581 --> 02:23:54,870
And uh, I, I will never,
never, ever go in it.

2558
02:23:54,871 --> 02:23:56,550
So one time I did a flight,

2559
02:23:57,510 --> 02:24:01,170
I did a flight to Catalina island
and we're literally, we got like,

2560
02:24:01,310 --> 02:24:04,290
when you need to do that, man, you're
flying over water. It's a single engine,

2561
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:07,950
so you got to have flares.
You gotta fucking life jacket on and shit.

2562
02:24:07,951 --> 02:24:10,440
And that was the only thing I was
worried about. I was just like, dude,

2563
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:12,960
I'm not even, I'm not even
worried about dying right now.

2564
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:18,180
I'm worried about crash landing into
this shit living and then waiting to

2565
02:24:18,181 --> 02:24:19,014
fucking die.

2566
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:21,870
It doesn't happen often, but when
it happens, I never forget it.

2567
02:24:22,170 --> 02:24:23,910
There was a guy just
a couple of years ago,

2568
02:24:23,911 --> 02:24:26,160
I think maybe just last
year in Santa Barbara Cerf.

2569
02:24:26,161 --> 02:24:30,630
I got killed by a great white and my
favorite story was a guy in San Diego

2570
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:34,260
training for a triathlon.
It was him and a few other people.

2571
02:24:34,261 --> 02:24:38,190
They were all in a row and they were
all swimming in this fucking whopper.

2572
02:24:38,430 --> 02:24:42,900
I said it had to be like 18 plus feet
came along bit the guy in half in front of

2573
02:24:42,901 --> 02:24:47,860
everybody and just just, you know, severed
them in half. Killed him right there.

2574
02:24:47,861 --> 02:24:50,530
I just bled out. Everyone's
screaming. It's the best.

2575
02:24:50,710 --> 02:24:55,230
Swam away the best way. Yeah, just
bite me and half get it over with

2576
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:59,250
a shark coming at me.
I would fucking swim towards my head.

2577
02:24:59,400 --> 02:25:00,360
Shove it right in there.

2578
02:25:00,860 --> 02:25:03,720
I'm going to have you take a bite
on my leg and see if I'm editing

2579
02:25:03,720 --> 02:25:04,290
edible it.

2580
02:25:04,290 --> 02:25:07,650
See if you could get a tourniquet on
it before you can hobble the shore. No,

2581
02:25:07,660 --> 02:25:11,710
fuck all that. Fuck all of that.
Yeah. It's a, it's a weird way to go.

2582
02:25:12,010 --> 02:25:16,690
It is a crazy thing because if
sharks have monkeys, dude, that's it.

2583
02:25:16,730 --> 02:25:20,920
Too cheap. That fucking ripped
at woman's face or do they,

2584
02:25:21,010 --> 02:25:24,050
you know when they fight each other,
do they take fucking fingers, pull it

2585
02:25:24,110 --> 02:25:28,090
off and they fucking Yank the guy
that the fucking ball small bag off.

2586
02:25:29,870 --> 02:25:30,330
Okay.

2587
02:25:30,330 --> 02:25:34,230
That's the first thing they go for. Fuck
that. They know what makes you a person.

2588
02:25:34,290 --> 02:25:37,140
They know your fingers. They go for your
fingers, they tear your fingers off.

2589
02:25:37,530 --> 02:25:41,160
They bite them off. They bite your
balls off. Yeah. Yeah. They're ruthless.

2590
02:25:41,340 --> 02:25:43,710
They think too.
That's the problem is they're thinking,

2591
02:25:43,860 --> 02:25:46,830
do my dog thinks forget
about those things.

2592
02:25:48,850 --> 02:25:53,400
The Dad is like, you don't like when
there's just that big guy in a bar.

2593
02:25:53,401 --> 02:25:55,440
It was a fucking psycho and
you just sitting there going,

2594
02:25:55,441 --> 02:25:59,190
I wish there was somebody big enough to
fucking handle this so I can feel better.

2595
02:25:59,250 --> 02:26:03,150
Like that's that times a thousand.
If a chimp just goes, you know,

2596
02:26:03,151 --> 02:26:05,010
one of the guys bring
it back to f as a fan.

2597
02:26:05,011 --> 02:26:08,100
One of the guys that I work with got
attacked by a monkey one time on when he

2598
02:26:08,101 --> 02:26:12,480
was a kid. And, um, and to this day
he had the funniest thing. He goes,

2599
02:26:12,481 --> 02:26:16,110
I hate when I go on shoots and there's
monkeys. He goes, I fucking hate it.

2600
02:26:16,150 --> 02:26:18,660
He goes, cause what's going
to happen is the, you know,

2601
02:26:18,870 --> 02:26:21,720
you're going to get two or three
takes. Everybody knows. He goes,

2602
02:26:21,721 --> 02:26:22,920
you do two or three takes.

2603
02:26:22,921 --> 02:26:26,100
And then after that the monkeys just
going to do whatever the fuck it wants to

2604
02:26:26,101 --> 02:26:30,450
do. And then the handler's going to try
to get it back under the hood or whatever

2605
02:26:30,451 --> 02:26:34,920
the fuck it's doing. And uh, yeah, he, he,

2606
02:26:35,690 --> 02:26:36,523
I,
it just,

2607
02:26:36,690 --> 02:26:39,810
I've never heard any good things about
monkeys when we were in Costa Rica,

2608
02:26:39,811 --> 02:26:42,690
we were staying at this nice
resort and they had monkeys.

2609
02:26:42,750 --> 02:26:45,080
There were all other monkeys.
Howler monkeys are the worst.

2610
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:47,970
And there was the other ones is Pale faced
monkeys. They weren't the howler ones.

2611
02:26:48,070 --> 02:26:51,050
Halloran ones don't come close to you.
But the other ones, he's a little way,

2612
02:26:51,060 --> 02:26:52,740
but they won't shut the fuck up.

2613
02:26:52,810 --> 02:26:56,100
I was Costa Rica and fortunately
we didn't have those,

2614
02:26:56,101 --> 02:26:59,870
but we wanted to rough it. And my
wife was just like, yeah, listen,

2615
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:02,910
I just want to go on in the middle would
be fucking slept under a mosquito net

2616
02:27:02,911 --> 02:27:06,500
dude wear in the jungle to,
we will put it this way.

2617
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:10,210
We did a zip line tour through the
northern part of, we did. Yeah,

2618
02:27:10,230 --> 02:27:10,741
we were right there.

2619
02:27:10,741 --> 02:27:15,741
So we're staying under this
fucking mosquito net and
we have like United States

2620
02:27:17,130 --> 02:27:20,610
of America bug spray in like the rain
forest and they're just laughing at the

2621
02:27:20,611 --> 02:27:23,610
shit.
It's like,

2622
02:27:23,611 --> 02:27:27,270
I'm shooting a pellet gun and the guy's
got a 44 dude. It was like, it was like,

2623
02:27:27,271 --> 02:27:29,220
I might as well put a one on two.

2624
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:32,820
I had welts all up and down and
they'll bite and the shit out of us.

2625
02:27:32,821 --> 02:27:37,710
And I remember like the
second day, um, this,

2626
02:27:37,711 --> 02:27:40,980
these fucking army ants just took
over our, our fucking little,

2627
02:27:41,550 --> 02:27:42,630
I don't even know what you'd call it.

2628
02:27:42,631 --> 02:27:44,360
There was like these ex
patriots had a fucking,

2629
02:27:44,370 --> 02:27:46,530
literally this giant tree
forth that they lived in.

2630
02:27:46,980 --> 02:27:49,740
And then they had these little bungalows
so that you had to walk up a ladder to

2631
02:27:49,741 --> 02:27:54,741
get into and these fucking things just
took over the place and the guy's like,

2632
02:27:55,621 --> 02:27:57,420
came on and I go, yeah, I
did. I came, I was like, oh,

2633
02:27:57,421 --> 02:27:59,010
there's like a fucking thousand ants.
And they're like,

2634
02:27:59,011 --> 02:28:02,220
they were all in a single file and
he just came washed. He goes, yeah,

2635
02:28:02,221 --> 02:28:05,370
those are the army ants. He goes, yeah,
he just can't do anything about it. Uh,

2636
02:28:05,940 --> 02:28:07,920
was standing there looking
at him and I got like,

2637
02:28:07,921 --> 02:28:10,610
these flip flops on and he goes, you
can't do anything about, I'm just,

2638
02:28:10,630 --> 02:28:14,130
you just got to let them pass through,
take a couple of hours. And he goes out,

2639
02:28:14,131 --> 02:28:17,130
watch out though. They bite and write as
he said that one of them fucking bit me.

2640
02:28:17,131 --> 02:28:18,690
And I was just like,
dude, you gotta be fucked.

2641
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:20,400
Yeah.

2642
02:28:20,400 --> 02:28:22,310
So, uh, so they had a monkey

2643
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:27,020
and a spider monkey and pet.
Yup. Not really a pat. I mean,

2644
02:28:27,021 --> 02:28:31,250
not pet by its choice, but
he hung out. They had it. No,

2645
02:28:31,251 --> 02:28:35,390
they had it as a pet by their choice.
The monkey was was a prisoner. Oh,

2646
02:28:36,830 --> 02:28:38,620
so,
so he's in,

2647
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:41,230
so I went over there and it's done
now it's sitting on top of like,

2648
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:43,030
it looks like a birdhouse silicon asshole.

2649
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:47,330
I walk over to this fucking thing like
giving it food and everything and it

2650
02:28:47,331 --> 02:28:50,480
fucking jumps on me in two seconds.

2651
02:28:50,510 --> 02:28:54,620
It jumped on me inverted,
had its tail wrapped around my neck,

2652
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:56,030
reached into my pockets,

2653
02:28:56,031 --> 02:29:00,380
took my bungalow keys and then ran up
the fucking tree with the keys to my

2654
02:29:00,381 --> 02:29:03,080
bungalow so I couldn't fucking
get into it and it all,

2655
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:08,200
it all went down in like fucking like
0.3 seconds and things just went wow.

2656
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:13,970
Fucking that was standing there
feeling subhuman. I was like,

2657
02:29:13,971 --> 02:29:15,620
I just got out smarter by this thing.

2658
02:29:15,621 --> 02:29:18,650
Like this is one for their side and
the monkey was up there looking at me.

2659
02:29:19,020 --> 02:29:22,280
I know it's fucking laughing at me
going like, oh you dumb mother fuckers.

2660
02:29:22,460 --> 02:29:25,370
Keep it right in your right front pocket.
I get it every time.

2661
02:29:25,970 --> 02:29:29,300
So then I was sitting there going like,
all right, all right motherfucker. Right.

2662
02:29:29,690 --> 02:29:33,950
You want to have a battle of wits.
Here we go. So I get some food,

2663
02:29:34,610 --> 02:29:39,200
right? So I come down and I know
I'm judging, it's fucking leash.

2664
02:29:39,201 --> 02:29:40,610
How far can jump.

2665
02:29:40,611 --> 02:29:43,700
So it Kinda get all the way back down
on its little fucking bird house,

2666
02:29:43,701 --> 02:29:45,530
which was probably about three feet long.

2667
02:29:45,950 --> 02:29:49,460
So I'm sitting there walking with the
food and it knows I want the key and it's

2668
02:29:49,461 --> 02:29:52,220
actually holding the fucking key away
from its body and seeing if it can have

2669
02:29:52,221 --> 02:29:56,900
its cake and eat it like a fucking
human being. Ooh. So yeah. Wow.

2670
02:29:56,901 --> 02:30:00,170
So I get the food and
what I did was I set it,

2671
02:30:01,450 --> 02:30:05,570
I took a big chunk of whatever the fuck
it was, so we would need two hands.

2672
02:30:06,230 --> 02:30:07,450
So it's set down my keys.

2673
02:30:07,451 --> 02:30:11,180
So it's set down the keys on the
other side of the fucking thing.

2674
02:30:11,390 --> 02:30:12,290
And then it was walking,

2675
02:30:12,291 --> 02:30:16,730
it was slowly walking towards it
and right as it got to the food,

2676
02:30:16,820 --> 02:30:19,310
this is why I'm a sadistic
castle, raise it, got to the food,

2677
02:30:19,610 --> 02:30:23,030
I fucking slapped the food off the
house so it would be out of its reach.

2678
02:30:23,031 --> 02:30:28,031
And then I grabbed the fucking keys and
ran and this thing fucking leapt at me.

2679
02:30:29,590 --> 02:30:31,430
I swear to God,

2680
02:30:31,431 --> 02:30:36,431
I swear to God I could feel its breath
and I fucking made it away to the other

2681
02:30:37,281 --> 02:30:40,910
side of it. And it was fucking pissed
at me and I was standing there,

2682
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:44,390
this is middle of Costa Rica going, yeah,
fuck you motherfucker. Fuck you. Right.

2683
02:30:44,740 --> 02:30:47,240
So there is the funniest part,
right?

2684
02:30:47,630 --> 02:30:52,370
So I go to my bungalow and I'm fucking
still kind of pissed at that fucking

2685
02:30:52,371 --> 02:30:57,200
thing and I go and unlock the door and
I'm sitting there for like 20 minutes

2686
02:30:57,650 --> 02:31:00,780
reading a book or whatever.
And then I just got on.

2687
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:04,820
I just started thinking about the monkey
and I fucking looked out the window and

2688
02:31:04,821 --> 02:31:07,790
it was sitting there all by itself
looking all sad and everything.

2689
02:31:07,791 --> 02:31:08,750
And then I felt bad.

2690
02:31:08,751 --> 02:31:12,110
So then I went and I got food and
I didn't have my keys this time.

2691
02:31:12,111 --> 02:31:14,370
And I actually kind of made
friends with the thing after that.

2692
02:31:14,371 --> 02:31:16,700
But I felt when I saw it all lonely
and she, I was like, you know what?

2693
02:31:16,701 --> 02:31:19,500
This thing's a prisoner. It doesn't want
to fucking be here. And I'm being dick.

2694
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:23,160
I gotta give it to food. So I gave
it back to it. Yeah, I felt bad.

2695
02:31:23,310 --> 02:31:27,960
That's a happy ending. I felt
bad. I don't get it in me. Aww.

2696
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:32,410
That's cute. In the moment I do you know
what else is cute? EPSIS her family. Yes.

2697
02:31:32,430 --> 02:31:35,670
