1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,610
It's authentic.
That's sweet.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:03,883
Yeah.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,940
I'm just now getting over the hurricane
of Shannon Briggs.

4
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:11,950
It came through this with a storm of.
Let's go champ.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,990
He's a maniac.
He is a maniac.

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,751
So,
uh,

7
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:16,700
I'm glad we can get you in here today
because,

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,270
uh,
explained to everybody.

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,270
First of all,
people don't know Chris produced and

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,940
what'd you direct it and produce it in a
bigger,

11
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,280
stronger,
faster and prescription thugs and

12
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:30,520
prescription thugs,
which is particularly important because

13
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:33,270
a lot of it was about the prescription
industry and the,

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,940
the how many people get hooked and
you've had experience with it.

15
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:37,450
I,
we,

16
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,320
we've all known people in the last.
People that have had problems with

17
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:43,900
prescription pills,
but you want her to come in and talk

18
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:44,734
about Kratom

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,010
sure.
Yeah.

20
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:48,230
You know,
a while back when I was actually hooked

21
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:50,930
on pills,
I was looking for a way to get off of

22
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,260
how it's searched the internet every day
on a way to get clean and sober.

23
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,650
And I came across this thing called
Kratom and I said,

24
00:00:57,651 --> 00:01:00,230
are they sell it at these head shops and
different things.

25
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:00,890
And,
you know,

26
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,730
back then I wasn't really familiar with
the head shop singing or anything like

27
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,570
that.
So I actually,

28
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:06,800
um,
I never found it.

29
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,960
I never went out and sought it out.
And then,

30
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:10,520
um,
after going through Rehab,

31
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:14,060
I had heard about it a couple more times
from some people I've heard about people

32
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:16,370
taking it to get off of opiates.
It's a plant,

33
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:19,520
it's a,
it's a 100 percent natural plant comes

34
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:20,240
from,
um,

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,500
you know,
Thailand,

36
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:23,090
Indonesia,
Malaysia,

37
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,240
that's where they grow it.
It's been used for like 2000 years.

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,450
I'm basically,
it works sort of like an opioid,

39
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,550
but it's not a drug,
it's just a plant,

40
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,890
you know,
and it has these properties that have

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,910
helped people bridge the gap when they
get off of opiates so they don't have

42
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:40,610
withdrawals.
What it also does is help relieve pain

43
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,610
and it also helps with anxiety.
It helps with,

44
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,600
uh,
you know,

45
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:47,210
elevates your mood and it does all these
great things.

46
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,700
But the government now wants to make it
a schedule one drug.

47
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,190
But so you're saying it's not a drug
though?

48
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,151
Well,
you know,

49
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:54,710
that's,
I guess it's semantics.

50
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:56,750
It's like,
how do you classify something that's

51
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:59,990
been around for 2000 years?
No one's ever done any studies on it

52
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:02,150
being a drug and no one's ever done any
studies on it.

53
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,343
Well,
there's been some,

54
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,900
there's been actually a lot of studies
on it being a supplement,

55
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,310
but they aren't like these FDA approved
double blind placebo studies that

56
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:14,240
they're requiring for it to be on the
market as a normal supplement.

57
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,403
But it,
um,

58
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,030
does it,
uh,

59
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,140
has psychoactive properties.
Well,

60
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:19,550
it'll,
it'll elevate your mood.

61
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:22,520
So would just talk about Alpha brain are
some nootropics.

62
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:25,040
It'll work like that and it will elevate
your mood.

63
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,250
I mean,
I don't know where the real distinction

64
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:31,730
is between high and elevation of mood or
were,

65
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:33,860
you know,
what the difference is really there,

66
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,920
but it doesn't make you feel like.
It's not like I smoked pot.

67
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,900
It's more like I had a good cup of
coffee,

68
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,410
you know,
I'm fired up back in the day when it

69
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,470
used to take pre workout supplements.
Caffeine and ephedrine kind of feels

70
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:47,390
like that.
I just feel like fired up and ready to

71
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:49,220
go and I don't feel pain.

72
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,570
That's interesting to create them,
gets you fired up.

73
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,580
I would've never,
I would've thought it would've melted

74
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,130
you out.
I have zero experience or that you have

75
00:02:56,131 --> 00:03:00,010
some here now and you could drive in
this stuff is

76
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,120
that they tell you not to operate heavy,
heavy machinery and things like that.

77
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:07,030
But I've never had a problem with it.
I actually take it to drive.

78
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,700
So you know,
tomorrow I'm leaving for Thanksgiving.

79
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:12,100
I had to drive six hours.
So that's your ass.

80
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:15,850
I'm taking Kratom before I get in the
car to go because it actually helps me

81
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,890
focus.
It relieves the pain.

82
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,570
Wow.
That's,

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,820
that sounds crazy.
So it,

84
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,030
it,
it mimics the effects of opioids,

85
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,770
right?
Opiates.

86
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,830
But it also elevates you.
Well sure.

87
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:34,690
So like if you don't know if you've ever
taken oxycotton or a vicodin or any of

88
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:37,360
those things like that.
A lot of times when people take that,

89
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:38,420
they feel like,
you know,

90
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,330
they're indestructible.
I took violin and I think it was viking

91
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:45,790
in once when I had my first knee surgery
in [inaudible] 93.

92
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,350
I fucking hated it.

93
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,800
I took,
I took it literally one time and I guess

94
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:51,890
for me,
you know,

95
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,550
I guess it's different for everybody.
I think it was vodka didn't,

96
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,610
it might've been percosets,
but whatever the doctor gave me for

97
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:58,630
pain,
I took the pills.

98
00:03:58,631 --> 00:03:59,470
I was like,
oh my God,

99
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,690
I feel so fucking stupid.
I'm like,

100
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:03,550
I'd rather be in pain that field as
dumb.

101
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,810
Sure.
I think a lot of times,

102
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,620
like what happened with me is I came out
of anesthesia from a surgery and I was

103
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,540
all doped up on the drugs and I didn't
even know it,

104
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,030
so it just kinda like,
just kept going,

105
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,500
you know what I mean?
Like I never,

106
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,800
I never stopped getting high from the
time I was in the hospital for like six

107
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,250
years.
So,

108
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,620
um,
for me it was like,

109
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,780
you know,
opiates were real big problem.

110
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:23,800
They were ruining my life.

111
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,430
They were destroying me.
Now that I got sober a two and a half

112
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:29,710
years ago and I started taking Kratom I
feel great.

113
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,150
Like everything in my entire career is
going skyrocketing,

114
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,500
things are going great.
I relationship,

115
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:38,950
my girlfriend's great,
just everything's been been good so I

116
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:41,500
can't really see the badness.
So when they decided to make this a

117
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:42,430
schedule,
one drug,

118
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,510
we decided to make a documentary about
it and show the world what it,

119
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,760
what it really is.
That seems really bizarre that you would

120
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:52,600
have a problem with drugs and then this
would help you.

121
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,140
Like I would think that if you have a
problem with drugs you would want to

122
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:58,480
stay away from anything that's sketchy.
Sure.

123
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,980
But a big part of addiction you got to
remember is that we relapse relapse if

124
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:05,050
you can have something.
It actually helps with alcohol

125
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:06,550
withdrawals and alcohol cravings.

126
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,730
So if we have something that will help
me to not crave those things or even

127
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:16,360
think about them and also not feel pain.
Like why should I have to be in pain?

128
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,410
Like there's no,
you know,

129
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,910
no.
You in pain right now?

130
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,130
Not right now because I took them before
I came here,

131
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:24,010
but I would normally be in a lot of
arthritic pain.

132
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,890
Okay.
Just and you have arthritis just

133
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:27,724
naturally,
right?

134
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,600
Double.
Yeah.

135
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:31,450
Double hip replacement surgery.
I need both of my knees done,

136
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,000
my shoulder shot,
you know,

137
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:36,760
kinda everything.
I'm kind of pretty beat up and so for me

138
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:37,870
it just works.
You know,

139
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:41,770
my brother who was also a power lifter,
he takes it as well before he trains and

140
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:44,050
he really loves it too.
It takes it before he lifts weights.

141
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:44,920
Yeah.
Wow.

142
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,830
And he's trying to bench 600 pounds so
he's not like,

143
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,030
it's not like he's using a little bit of
weight.

144
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,980
He's your brother's a gorilla and he's
pushing it.

145
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,490
That's,
that's so strange to me.

146
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:54,760
And this is all like,
I'm glad we didn't talk before this

147
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:57,860
podcast because I had a thought in my
head of what this stuff is.

148
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,430
And you changing it right now.
I,

149
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,530
you think it was.
Well,

150
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:05,120
I felt like it was probably just a good
way that people could relieve pain

151
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:07,760
naturally,
but I felt like if someone was going to

152
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:09,650
describe it to me,
I thought they were going to tell me

153
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:12,740
about an opiate type of effect.
That it just mellows you out,

154
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:15,140
but it doesn't,
it doesn't hurt you.

155
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,380
There are different strains of it.
There's a strain called Bali,

156
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,160
which is supposed to be good for anxiety
and kind of calm you down.

157
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,500
There's a strand called green melee,
which is like sort of get.

158
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,330
That's the one that is a good pre
workout,

159
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,740
but they're all kind of the same thing.

160
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,330
You know,
they all have the same alkaloids.

161
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,420
Kratom has 27 alkaloids.
So when you look at it,

162
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:39,860
it actually has alkaloids that worked
like opiate stay attached to opiate

163
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:41,480
receptors,
but not in the same way.

164
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
If you look at oxycotton when it
attaches,

165
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,920
they went opiate receptor.
I mean it's like,

166
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,570
you know,
it's stuck in there.

167
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,170
It's like screwed in basically if you
think about like a screw and opiate

168
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:54,170
recite screwed in there so tight that
you could never just pull it out,

169
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,230
you'd have to unscrew.
So with um,

170
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,420
with,
with the Kratom though,

171
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:01,490
it kind of like balance,
it Kinda like drifts around the top of

172
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:02,780
that opiate receptor.
It doesn't,

173
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,080
it doesn't attach it nearly as hard.
They say that opiates attach a thousand

174
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:11,750
times greater to the opiate receptor
than anything found in nature and

175
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:13,940
Kratom's found in nature.
Oh Wow.

176
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,200
But what about heroin?

177
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,870
Like the actual poppy seed is found in
nature,

178
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,763
right?
So,

179
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,540
and they have to do stuff to it to make
it,

180
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,710
you know,
heroin.

181
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,470
They have to do stuff with a coca leaves
to make cocaine.

182
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:25,020
They have to,
you know,

183
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,020
it's like marijuana and Kratom are
probably the two most similar things.

184
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:31,340
And when I went to,
uh,

185
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,450
interview,
uh,

186
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,740
Senator Mark Pocan last week about a,
he was the one that wrote a letter to

187
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:38,510
the government.
He wants to keep Kratom legal.

188
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:39,770
He thinks that,
you know,

189
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:41,720
it should be allowed for everyone.
And I said to him,

190
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,120
what do you think about marijuana?
And he was like,

191
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:47,780
I just think it should all be legal.
And it was the first time I was ever in

192
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:50,900
the presence of somebody that works for
the government saying that they think

193
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:53,180
that weed and Kratom and all this stuff
should be illegal.

194
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,400
And it's because he had a good head on
his shoulders about the problems that

195
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,020
people face every day.
You know,

196
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,990
it's not black and white.
Like I live in this gray area.

197
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,370
I don't,
I'm in a lot of pain.

198
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:07,730
But I don't want to take opiates and I
shouldn't have to take opiates.

199
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,340
So where's the pressure coming from to
turn this stuff into a schedule one drug

200
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,850
if there's no.
If there's no negative response by the

201
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:19,070
body,
you're not having people die of

202
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:21,440
overdoses.
Is there an ld 50 rate on this stuff?

203
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,003
Well,
if you look at,

204
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,520
you know where,
where is the ld 50 explained.

205
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,510
Probably explained to people lethal dose
at 50 percent.

206
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:32,900
Meaning if you take 50 rats and you give
them a pound of this shit,

207
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:37,430
50 of them are 25 die at a certain show.
We've heard about,

208
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,320
you know,
there's been no deaths from marijuana,

209
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,450
right?
Freedom is the same thing.

210
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,530
No,
no deaths.

211
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,820
There have been zero deaths and there,
there have actually been 15 deaths that

212
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:49,070
have been brought to the FDA and the dea
is attention.

213
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,830
Those 15 that's.
I actually went and interviewed one of

214
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:52,790
the.
One of the mothers.

215
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,770
The kid was on three psych meds.
He was withdrawn.

216
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,070
He was

217
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,350
honored withdrawing from three different
psych meds.

218
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:00,600
I have a black box warning that says,
warning,

219
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:03,210
if you're a teenager,
you might commit suicide basically,

220
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,500
and this kid committed suicide.
He didn't die from a Kratom overdose.

221
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,400
He died from committing suicide and his
mother wants to blame Kratom.

222
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,590
She doesn't think that the,
uh,

223
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,750
the psych meds had anything to do with
it.

224
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:17,910
And I don't want to say that Kratom had
nothing to do with it.

225
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:20,910
We don't really know.
And what I really call for with Kratom

226
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:23,970
is just more research,
like I want people to put in the money

227
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,350
to do the research to make sure that
this is safe and let's see if we can

228
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,570
solve this opiod epidemic.
Let's see if we can crack down,

229
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,650
you know,
basically lower the amount of opiate

230
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:37,620
prescriptions we have in this country.
I just read an article the other day.

231
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,520
One in seven people in America are going
to be affected with addiction problems.

232
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,560
Wow,
that's crazy.

233
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,080
One in seven.
That means somebody in your family,

234
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,790
that's,
that's insane.

235
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,840
Somebody in your family will be affected
by it and that's 10 percent.

236
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,670
Yeah,
that's weird.

237
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,200
That's weird,
right?

238
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,410
And not everybody is.
It's not that everybody gets addicted

239
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,410
that are affected by addiction.
My girlfriend was really affected by

240
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,230
addiction because when she met me,
I was taking drugs and drinking every

241
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:06,840
day.
And um,

242
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,850
that's a,
that's a big effect on,

243
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:10,320
especially on women.
It's tough.

244
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,760
It's tough thing to handle.
Now I can understand this woman whose

245
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:19,380
son died being to understand her remorse
and looking to point the blame at

246
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:21,390
someone.
And a lot of times people are reluctant

247
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:24,660
to point the blame towards something
that a doctor prescribed and they'll

248
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:25,950
automatically say,
well,

249
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:27,090
it probably wasn't that.

250
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,760
It was probably this other thing that's
not regulated.

251
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,500
You know what she said to me?
She said,

252
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,440
Chris,
I'm going to pray for you because I know

253
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:37,470
you're taking Kratom and I'm going to
pray for you that you're okay.

254
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,560
And I was like,
you know,

255
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,750
lady,
you don't need to pray for me.

256
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:41,960
Like I've been taking it for a year,
you know?

257
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,480
And I think that people just get it
wrong and I feel bad for her.

258
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,220
I feel bad for her.
And the fact that,

259
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:50,040
um,
that she can't just realize that,

260
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,530
you know,
she can't look at the research and see,

261
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,450
you know,
because when I went and interviewed her,

262
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:54,901
she said,
well,

263
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:58,950
I'm not even sure if Kratom killed them
and this is after a gigantic,

264
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,843
you know,
uh,

265
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:00,631
they,
they,

266
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:03,900
they mount this gigantic media coverage
of this story,

267
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:06,300
right?
Like this was all over and now and now,

268
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:09,120
like two years later after the damage
has been done,

269
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,530
she's kind of coming back and say,
well,

270
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:12,120
I don't know if it was Kratom,
you know,

271
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,760
she already did the damage like that.

272
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,380
These are,
these deaths are the reason why the dea

273
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:17,670
wants to ban it.
Well,

274
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:19,940
the dea though is going on.
What kind of effort?

275
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:22,170
I mean,
when they do a scientific analysis of

276
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:25,460
creative and they break it down,
they find they don't find anything toxic

277
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:26,460
in it.
Do they know?

278
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:27,750
Well,
I talked to Melvin Patterson,

279
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:30,840
he's the spokesman for the,
for the dea.

280
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:34,200
And when I talked to Melvin Patterson,
what he told me is that they lean on the

281
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:36,570
FDA a lot for these kinds of decisions.
Right?

282
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,850
So they go to the FDA and they asked the
FDA,

283
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,630
can you give us an eight point?
It's like some sort of a thing that they

284
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:45,240
have in place.
It's like an eight point inspection to

285
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:47,430
make sure that this drug is not
dangerous,

286
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,960
you know,
and if it is dangerous,

287
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:51,810
it's deemed dangerous,
they'll take it off the market based on

288
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,320
the FDA's research.

289
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,350
So the dea had asked the FDA for that
eight point inspection,

290
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,000
the FDA never went ahead and did it.
So the DEA got upset and said,

291
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:02,380
well,
we're gonna abandon any way because

292
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:05,470
we're waiting on you guys.
And then there was a big uproar.

293
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,000
There was 100,000 people signed a
petition partly due to to you tweeting

294
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:12,880
about it and things like that.
It was a Guy Andrew Turner,

295
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,180
he tweeted you.
He was an Iraq war vet.

296
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,880
And um,
you should see his video.

297
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:23,260
He can't even speak without Kratom.
He cannot talk normal without Kratom.

298
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:27,580
He speaks with all these ticks and
twitches in his face due to they think

299
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,790
maybe ptsd and some other problems that
had affected him.

300
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,760
And now he takes Kratom.
And those twitches all go away.

301
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:36,400
He did a video on youtube that was kind
of amazing.

302
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:39,520
He stopped taking it for six days and
you can see all these twitches are

303
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:42,700
evidence and then he goes back on the
Kratom and they all disappeared.

304
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,520
Wow.
Wow.

305
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,790
So who's pressuring the dea to turn this
stuff into a schedule one drug.

306
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:53,080
And why schedule one?
There is a,

307
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,490
there's a couple of patents that are on
the alkaloids that are in the plant.

308
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,570
So I think that big Pharma would be the
first place to look.

309
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,840
They have a couple patents.
They want to basically take this,

310
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,940
you know,
I think it's actually,

311
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,601
I,
I don't,

312
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:10,240
I don't look at it as being that bad,
but why make,

313
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,200
why make the organic kratom illegal in
order to turn this into a more powerful

314
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:18,940
drug?
They think that they can extract some of

315
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:19,870
these alkaloids,
right?

316
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,670
There's two alkaloids,
metallothionein,

317
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:24,220
and the other one is like seven hydroxy
metallothionein.

318
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,440
It's too technical for anybody to really
care about,

319
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:29,770
but there's two alkaloids that they
really care about that help with opiate

320
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:31,750
withdrawals and help with pain.

321
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,570
And those are the two,
and actually just want to ban the two

322
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:36,190
alkaloids,
but you can't do that because it's in

323
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,680
the plant.
So you have to ban the whole plant.

324
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:39,491
And to me,
you know,

325
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:42,610
you said it the best.
He said making something else illegal.

326
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,950
It's like archaic.
It doesn't make any sense.

327
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,960
What are you going to do to the people?
You know,

328
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,230
five states just legalized marijuana.
Now you're going to throw people in jail

329
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:51,520
for Kratom.
It doesn't make sense.

330
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,140
Well,
I'm worried about this new

331
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:57,640
administration when it comes to men may
various reasons,

332
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,300
but I'm worried about them when it comes
to being compromised by big Pharma.

333
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:02,410
I really am.
You know,

334
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:06,580
it's just a such a business oriented
administration and he's bringing all

335
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:08,830
these old dudes over there right out of
the TV show.

336
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:11,800
The strain,
like the vampire dudes that are hanging

337
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:12,610
out with the Nazis.

338
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,210
Like I'm looking at all these people
like Mike Pence and all these old dudes.

339
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:18,180
He's bringing in with these archaic
ideas.

340
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,630
They're all against gay marriage.
I mean,

341
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,690
it's ridiculous.
You know,

342
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:25,890
I was hoping that maybe trump would
bring in some people that would be

343
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,390
opposite of his thinking and you know,
it just hasn't happened.

344
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:32,200
So he was a Democrat for a long time.
I mean Donald Trump was always a

345
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:34,890
democrat.
I mean him running as a Republican is

346
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,590
kind of odd if you look at this history,
but he's going all in with a lot of

347
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,010
these people in.
Some of them are deeply opposed to

348
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:47,011
marijuana legalization federally and
know that stuff is very counterintuitive

349
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:50,890
and counter progressive and the
marijuana legalization,

350
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,930
we've been reading a lot about that and
it's going to be what a lot of people

351
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:58,310
think might be a mess because we're
making it recreational opens it up to

352
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,880
Marlborough and all these other
companies that make tobacco products to

353
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:06,560
now start selling cannabis and a turn it
into what we already have.

354
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,730
Bullshit.
Well,

355
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,810
I'm not opposed to them making it
commercial because I feel like the more

356
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,710
people do it,
the better we're all going to be sure.

357
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,420
I really,
I really believe that.

358
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:18,021
I mean,
people say,

359
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:19,600
Oh,
your upload who'd brew,

360
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,940
but I really think it's a it.
I think,

361
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,770
I mean you can call it a drug,
but whatever it is,

362
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:27,710
it is a component of life that makes
people calmer,

363
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,350
makes people happier.
It makes people more sensitive.

364
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,710
I just think it's better for people.
I was 100 percent against it ever since

365
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:35,950
I was in college.
Like I had just thought like a

366
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,801
marijuana.
Wow,

367
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:37,070
that's.
So,

368
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,150
that's the worst thing,
you know,

369
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,500
and,
and steroids.

370
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:40,870
I thought marijuana,
steroids were the,

371
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,180
were the devil and come to find out it's
all the drugs that the doctors actually

372
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:46,760
prescribe us that are the devil that we
need to look out for.

373
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,290
You know,
they're not necessarily to say the

374
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,300
devil.
They help a lot of people,

375
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,120
but we have to be very careful about
what we're putting in our bodies that

376
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:54,860
our doctors give us.
We can't just say,

377
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,990
well,
the doctor said it's fine and just take

378
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:59,000
it.
And that's how I got addicted to

379
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,890
opiates.
And a lot of people want to say,

380
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,320
I'll get it on instagram all the time.
Well Bro,

381
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:04,220
it's your fault,
man.

382
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:06,350
It's all your fault and they know
nothing about addiction.

383
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:08,660
It's not my fault.
It's not anybody's fault.

384
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:11,090
These things happen because it's a
progressive,

385
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,040
you know,
these drugs were designed to make you

386
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,120
addicted,
so to say,

387
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:16,130
it's my fault.
It's kind of ridiculous because the drug

388
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:18,260
was actually designed so people get
hooked on it.

389
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,060
Yeah,
you just didn't outrun it.

390
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,620
That's all it is.
I did not run it.

391
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,270
Yeah,
I mean that's really what it is.

392
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:25,770
It's like some people out run it and you
get away from it.

393
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,560
You should have been stronger brew.
All right.

394
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,400
How many people have to get fucking
addicted before you recognize that it's

395
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:34,130
a problem instead of the giant problem
in this country?

396
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:37,100
We lose a person to addiction every 19
minutes in this country.

397
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:40,510
Accidental overdoses.
I think I've said that several times on

398
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,680
your show and it's just,
you can't say it enough.

399
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,680
You know,
we have this giant opiod epidemic and we

400
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:47,420
have something here,
you know,

401
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:48,590
in,
in our film,

402
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,360
we're just,
we're starting to make a documentary

403
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:52,000
about this and in the film,
you know,

404
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,930
we show a guy who has a,
not a,

405
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,160
not a huge habit,
but six vicodin a day habit and he cuts

406
00:16:58,161 --> 00:17:00,830
that down to zero using Kratom and we
watched that,

407
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,900
you know,
that process because I feel like that's

408
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:04,010
important to show that like,
Hey,

409
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:06,890
you can actually do this now if we have
people that are really,

410
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:10,790
really addicted to heroin and really,
really addicted to these other drugs,

411
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,520
they might need something like suboxone.

412
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,830
And then Kratom,
you know,

413
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,060
like we don't really,
we don't really know.

414
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,680
You know,
my friend Kelly done,

415
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,740
who owns the company,
uh,

416
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,830
urban ice that we were just,
we were just talking to,

417
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,220
he actually bought a farm up in
Washington and it's his intent if people

418
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:28,130
don't have money to go to rehab or do
whatever they can come up and visit him,

419
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,970
you know,
and get Kratom he's actually a licensed

420
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:33,620
therapists and all that stuff like that.
So like,

421
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:39,010
I feel like it's sort of this,
this grassroots movement to um,

422
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,040
to try to get people to even try Kratom.
That's what I've been trying to do is

423
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:43,681
get people like,
hey,

424
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:45,020
this,
just try it.

425
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:47,570
Like you said with marijuana.
The more people that try it,

426
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:49,750
the better off we'll be.
And I really feel that with Kratom to

427
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,710
making me want to try it now.

428
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,400
What is the name up Kratom plant?
Like what does the plant look like?

429
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,270
It's a plant.
It kind of looks like,

430
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,560
I don't know,
like a poison ivy plant.

431
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:03,210
I'm sure he can maybe pull one up,
you know,

432
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,010
but it basically just looks like just
like any other plant,

433
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:08,370
shiny green leaves.
And I don't think I even heard about it

434
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:11,640
until maybe a couple of years ago and I
didn't know how to pronounce it until a

435
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,230
month ago while people say Kratom
Kratom,

436
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,520
tomato,
tomato,

437
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:15,660
whatever.
I didn't.

438
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,050
I mean I've rarely heard of.
I think someone gave me some after a

439
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,110
show,
one day I'm more wrong,

440
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,560
you know,
what that looks like or it goes,

441
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,600
it kind of happens a lot.
Like somebody will say,

442
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:25,530
hey here,
try this,

443
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:27,110
and I,
I never trust that either,

444
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,090
but for me what happened to me is very
interesting.

445
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,240
I have a lot of friends in this,
you know,

446
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,280
in this world of fitness and whatever.

447
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,520
And so I just ended up talking to a lot
of people that try a lot of different

448
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:41,700
things.
So after I got done with the opiates,

449
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,970
I was on Dr drew show and he said,
well you should try advil and tylenol

450
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:48,120
and combination that's going to be
better than an opiate for your pain,

451
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,650
for your chronic pain.
So I said,

452
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:50,790
okay.
I started trying that.

453
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,780
Then I get a phone call from my friend
who's lives in England who tells me he

454
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:57,330
just had a kidney transplant because of
all the insights he was taken.

455
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,840
So now he doesn't.
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatories which

456
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,070
are advil.
Sure.

457
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,340
Yeah.
Advil and tylenol.

458
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,160
So that.
So he had a kidney transplant.

459
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:06,720
I just thought,
you know,

460
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:08,580
I didn't think that that was going to
necessarily happen to me,

461
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,160
but I was taking like 10 advil a day,
you know,

462
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,113
that could happen.

463
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,400
Then how many will your friend tig?
And he said about 20 and he was in new

464
00:19:16,401 --> 00:19:18,510
Bain addict before that,
so he doesn't know if it's a new Bain.

465
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:19,200
Right.
Blah,

466
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,621
blah blah.
Right.

467
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:21,150
So you're getting all these problems.
I just thought like,

468
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,880
well look,
taking 10 advil and tylenol a day

469
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,500
because I was taking them in
combination.

470
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,150
That just can't be good for your
campaign.

471
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,700
So my friend Kelly hit me up.
He's like,

472
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,130
hey man,
you should try this plant.

473
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,020
It might help you.
And what was your first experience with.

474
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,510
My first experience was um,
so my friend Kelly was a very serious

475
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,010
about this and he wants to help a lot of
people.

476
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,160
He said I'll fly to Sacramento.
I was living up by my brother at the

477
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:46,650
time.
So he flew out to Sacramento to see me.

478
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,670
He gave me some Kratom.

479
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,320
He went to his hotel.
I went to my house.

480
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,380
I had just been filming with my brother
for like five hours straight.

481
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,840
And my arthritis was like,
at its worst point,

482
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,650
like the worst it could possibly be.
Is that from standing?

483
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,940
Standing up?
Yeah.

484
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,880
Yeah.
Just get beat up,

485
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,760
you know,
and I'm also standing on concrete floors

486
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:05,200
and gyms and stuff like that,
so I was just like,

487
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,430
beat up.
I took the Kratom and then he came over

488
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,050
later that day to talk to me and I said,
dude,

489
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:12,060
you're not going to believe it,
but I'm in.

490
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,490
No,
I don't feel any pain right now.

491
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:17,370
No pain.
And it took a good two or three months

492
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:21,000
for me to really get into it because
like I might tell you now and you might

493
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:21,990
go home and try this,
right?

494
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,930
Right.
Anybody say,

495
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:23,431
yeah,
Chris,

496
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,710
whatever the fuck like that,
that doesn't work,

497
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,070
but then for some reason you'll go back
to it and then he'd go back to it and go

498
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:31,110
back to it and all of a sudden like it's
a miracle.

499
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,310
You.
I don't know what.

500
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:33,690
That's how.
That's how it was for me.

501
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,160
I'm not saying that's how it's gonna be
for everyone.

502
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,540
Well,
I'm not in any pain,

503
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,640
so if I took it,
it was just to get fucked up.

504
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,100
Well,
elevate your mood to elevate my mood.

505
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,040
I'm pretty happy right now.
I don't want to get more elevated.

506
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,060
I'll do something silly.
Yeah,

507
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:45,940
you might.
You never know,

508
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,220
but also helps with that lowers your
blood pressure.

509
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,360
It helps with anxiety,
blah,

510
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:49,601
blah,
blah,

511
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:49,961
blah,
blah.

512
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:52,150
Right.
So you can look at it for several health

513
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,040
band,
but it doesn't get you to a point where

514
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,430
you can't drive or you don't know how to
type.

515
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,460
I should probably get responsible and
say it hasn't gotten me to that point.

516
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,560
Hasn't gotten you to that,
but I have.

517
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,770
I have taken too much of it.
Oh,

518
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,520
okay.
Give me one of them packets and tell me

519
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,170
like how much you're supposed to take.
Well,

520
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,160
if it's all gonna be relative,
right?

521
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,930
You would take one of these.
What do you weight?

522
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,890
One Ninety,
200?

523
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,860
Yeah,
somewhere in the range of 200,

524
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,960
so 200.
So I take six of them that I worked up

525
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:21,720
to six of them pills.
Yeah.

526
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,640
I would say this is a packet of pills.
Sure.

527
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,340
Now now crate,
I'm a lot of times it's taken in a

528
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:32,110
powder form but it tastes disgusting so
I can't handle the powder so I just take

529
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:32,800
the capsules.

530
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,630
Yeah,
somebody gave me an a powder form and

531
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:35,980
I'm just like,
heroin.

532
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,380
You don't want to hear something really
interesting.

533
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,300
I,
I was supposed to speak at an AA meeting

534
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:43,240
the other day and um,
I got a phone call from,

535
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,060
from somebody at the AA.
If I took some right now.

536
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:47,310
How much should I take?
I take two.

537
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,120
Okay.
But you know,

538
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:49,954
like,
um,

539
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,800
I was supposed to speak at an AA meeting
and I got a phone call from a good

540
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:55,660
friend of mine and she said,
well,

541
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:58,060
I'm confused now because I'm not sure if
you're sober.

542
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,610
Oh,
because you're taking Kratom I'm taking

543
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:03,850
Kratom and it affects your mind.
So now I need to worry that you're

544
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:06,370
fucking up.
They're worried that I'm fucking up and

545
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:06,881
it,
you know what,

546
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:09,460
it actually hurt me.
Like it hurt.

547
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,130
It hurt to hear that from somebody that
like helped me get sober.

548
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,110
It really hurt my feelings.
Like,

549
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,020
I don't mean to sound like a pussy,
but like hurt my feelings to hear like,

550
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:18,220
Hey,
you're not sober from people.

551
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:21,190
I really looked up to him and I can
understand their worry.

552
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,690
I totally understand.
There I,

553
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:25,000
it's so confused.
It sounds like you're doing a heroin

554
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:26,210
substitute.
Sure.

555
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,300
Natural heroin substance and it's been
called,

556
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,350
you know,
herbal heroin.

557
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:31,810
So I can,
I can see their concern.

558
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,440
So is that maybe the same sort of
concern that led the dea to take a close

559
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:37,900
look at this?
Because I mean if you look at it,

560
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,790
I mean everyone wants to worry that the
dea is in bed with big Pharma and it's

561
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,610
all about business and they're really
here to screw over the American people.

562
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,810
Keep these legal,
natural things away from us.

563
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,560
But I had the same sort of reservations.

564
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,300
Man.
I didn't know until you came in here

565
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:57,130
today.
I didn't know that you could operate

566
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,060
cars on it and it doesn't fuck with you
and that you take it before a drive.

567
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,320
Like I would've never imagined that I,
I do want to stay in the area,

568
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,460
but I don't want to be here and be
irresponsible.

569
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:07,570
I don't think every.
I don't want to say,

570
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,890
oh,
everybody should take credit.

571
00:23:08,891 --> 00:23:09,730
I mean everybody,
you know,

572
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,020
but I feel like I feel like I know that
it's safe enough to try.

573
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,330
For example,
I know it's safe enough for anybody to,

574
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,300
to try.
So I've seen it.

575
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,820
I've seen any in thousands of people
that are,

576
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,700
that are using it.
I get emails everyday from people that

577
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:27,610
take Kratom because we're doing a
documentary and you know as well,

578
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:30,280
you know,
when I feel that media has the power to

579
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:32,260
change your world,
I feel like what you do,

580
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,720
what I do,
we actually have a voice and we have a

581
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:36,880
power that can change people's minds.

582
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,900
My film bigger,
stronger,

583
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:40,210
faster,
completely changed people's minds on

584
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,260
steroids.
It did,

585
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:44,980
it changed my mind.
It gave me a view into it that I'd never

586
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,750
before and that.
And then there was a.

587
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,970
was it an hbo real sports did a whole
thing on steroids.

588
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,063
Real sports.
Yeah.

589
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,570
Sports.
And they were essentially saying,

590
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:59,420
where's the body's like?
Everyone's talking about people dying

591
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:00,830
from steroid overdoses.
No,

592
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:02,900
it's not what's happening?
They're dying from pain pills.

593
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,260
I didn't get to tell you how I turned
around on marijuana.

594
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,830
Oh,
the Joe Rogan experience listening to

595
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:10,730
the show,
you know,

596
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:12,740
that's why I said media is important.
I feel like it's.

597
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,450
We can change the world.
We can change things.

598
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:17,030
I was dead set against it,
thought it was for losers.

599
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:17,901
I'm like,
oh,

600
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:19,970
Joe Rogan smokes pot.
Maybe it's not so bad.

601
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:22,490
So I started doing the research.
I'm not saying I just jumped in and

602
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:24,980
started doing it,
but I've done the research and I know

603
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:25,990
enough that it's.

604
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,750
That it's safe.
You know,

605
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,470
we know it's 100 percent safe.
I mean,

606
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,330
you could definitely take too much of
it.

607
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:34,190
Just like you were saying,
you could take too much kratom.

608
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,230
You can get too fucking high and freak
out.

609
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,510
That's true.
But if just get a little bit high,

610
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,940
you're gonna be all right.
Ma.

611
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,650
Marijuana and Kratom or both.
They're both miracle plants.

612
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,630
They're both plants that are put here.
I,

613
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,890
you know,
if you believe in God,

614
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,870
I believe that,
you know,

615
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,610
these things were put here on the planet
for us to use,

616
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,380
to heal ourselves,
to feel better.

617
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,000
There's nothing wrong with feeling
better.

618
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:56,540
I think we have a big aversion in this
country to people being able to feel

619
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:57,440
better.
Like anything,

620
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,503
you know,
I don't know,

621
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,470
taking Kratom I'll.
It makes you feel better.

622
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:02,370
Like why is that a crime?
It shouldn't be fine.

623
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,141
And she'd be,
you know,

624
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:05,480
we have alcohol on the market that makes
people feel better.

625
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,900
We have cigarettes and tobacco and that
makes people feel better and they get a

626
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:11,990
little buzz from it or whatever.
Why not Kratom like what's the big deal?

627
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,360
Yeah.
We have a reluctance to indulgence in

628
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:15,230
some ways,
right?

629
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:17,450
Like we're worried about indulging in
something,

630
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,820
something pleasurable,
like it's bad for you.

631
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,990
Well,
people say,

632
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,101
oh,
Kratom,

633
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:23,870
I heard that makes you high.
And I'm like,

634
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,450
well first of all,
what would it be wrong?

635
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:29,240
What would be so bad with that?
That's a good feeling for a lot of

636
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:29,990
people.
I don't,

637
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,990
I don't see that that's so bad to have a
little bit of euphoria,

638
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,330
you know,
now being high on cocaine or crack or

639
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,040
whatever.
That's a completely different story.

640
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,900
We're not talking about that.
We're just talking about like a little

641
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:42,890
elevation in your mood.

642
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,420
Yeah.
There's a big difference between being

643
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:46,520
high and being impaired short,
right?

644
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,030
I think we,
we put those two together and they're

645
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:52,760
always in the same category for some
strange reason and they don't

646
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:56,420
necessarily have to be like a nice cup
of coffee gets you high.

647
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,403
Yeah,
I made it.

648
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,130
Look,
I drink a cup of coffee in the morning

649
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:02,240
and I start slap my hands together and I
want to start doing shit.

650
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,430
You know,
if I drank that little caveman coffee,

651
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,690
sure I'd be bouncing off the walls
because that's so strong and it's.

652
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,130
I don't think there's anything wrong
with it.

653
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:12,440
I love it.
I think it should be legal and I think

654
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:16,850
that you know of Kratom is in the same
league as coffee and starbucks is the

655
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:18,620
biggest business in our country.
Like why?

656
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,490
Why is it so bad?
So since the people like people that are

657
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:24,410
sober and then are helping you with
that,

658
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:26,980
they have concerns about it and there's
a lot of people that are going to.

659
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,410
It seems like this is a drug or a plant
I should say,

660
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,310
that just does not have enough.
There's not enough data,

661
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,140
there's not enough research,
not enough research.

662
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,730
And that's what we want to do.
We would like,

663
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,331
you know,
look,

664
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:40,490
every time there's been an epidemic in
this country,

665
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,290
we had a polio outbreak,
right?

666
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,920
And our president was affected by it.

667
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,510
So what did we do?
We decided,

668
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:47,280
you know what?
No more polio.

669
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,490
Let's fix the problem.
I don't see why the government doesn't

670
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:50,851
say,
look,

671
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:54,570
we're losing a person every 19 minutes.
This is way more serious than polio.

672
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,040
Why are we not putting funding into
researching things like Kratom?

673
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,860
There's other things that are like
Kratom to why aren't we researching

674
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,240
these things?
There's another plant called Aka Uma and

675
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,050
other plant called soursop.
There's several plants that are,

676
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,300
that are like Kratom and do they do
similar things?

677
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:13,830
Why can't we study those to stop the
deaths,

678
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,510
to like slow it down,
you know,

679
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:19,050
to,
to make a dent and the deaths from opiod

680
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:20,700
addiction.
There's no reason why the government

681
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:21,840
can't fund that.
Now.

682
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:24,360
What are these other plants,
Aka Uma and what was the other one?

683
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,730
One's called Aka Uma and one's called
soursop.

684
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:30,180
And the reason why even know about those
is because what happens as soon as

685
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,490
something gets banned,
you look for the next thing,

686
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,483
right?

687
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,820
Oh Wow.
So you're a step ahead.

688
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:39,420
I don't even know what those things do,
but I know we like as soon as,

689
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:40,560
uh,
Kratom was band,

690
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:41,740
we were on the Internet looking for
like,

691
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,190
well,
what else is like it because I don't

692
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:45,690
want to have to deal without it.
Well,

693
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:47,900
I think it was you that tweeted
something and um,

694
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:52,200
I might retweet it or just read it,
but you tweeted something about someone

695
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:55,530
getting arrested,
like some big drug bust where they

696
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:57,720
busted him for Creighton,
which wasn't even illegal.

697
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,680
Yeah,
that's that,

698
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:01,140
that's a weird thing.
That was a guy I think,

699
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:02,360
um,
maybe because that,

700
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,200
that,
that guy's neighbor has had it out for

701
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:06,390
them,
they sorta like had it out for them and

702
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,380
they saw these big green bags of what
they thought was drugs at his house and

703
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:11,700
the cops went to write it and they're
like,

704
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:12,810
well,
we're not sure what this is,

705
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,220
so we're going to have to arrest you.

706
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,780
Oh God.
You know what I mean?

707
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:18,720
It took causes like a pretty,
pretty weird problem.

708
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:21,150
You know,
the thing was when they made it illegal,

709
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:25,820
I had two giant boxes of Kratom sitting
in my garage and all I could think about

710
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,281
was like,
okay,

711
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:29,130
the cops are going to come here and
they're going to bust me because they

712
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:30,840
know I'm doing a documentary about it.
I'm going to be,

713
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,220
you know,
the mark man.

714
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,800
But I decided that like no matter what
happened,

715
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:38,280
I was going to keep those boxes in my
garage and I wasn't gonna worry about it

716
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,800
because I figured like,
what are they going to come arrest me?

717
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:42,210
You know,
how stupid that would look because

718
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:47,160
that's all going into the documentary.
So I don't really have a fear that other

719
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:49,680
people have because I feel like I put
everything on camera and put everything

720
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,000
out there.

721
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,240
So I feel like.
But uh,

722
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,910
but other people,
it is serious,

723
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:56,370
like the um,
the vet I was talking about,

724
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,580
he can't live without Kratom.
What are we going to do?

725
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,050
Take it away from him.
What are we going to do in the meantime?

726
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:01,861
You know,
if we,

727
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:03,660
if we ban it,
what are we going to do?

728
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,300
What are we going to do with that guy?
Yeah.

729
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,300
Like where's she going to go back on
opiates to the VA hospital.

730
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,330
Like it's fuck what a weird situation.
So we really need you.

731
00:29:14,971 --> 00:29:18,810
Chris Documentary is actually important.
Yeah,

732
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:19,890
it's very,
very important.

733
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:24,720
It's very important because it's not
just about Kratom is about how the Dea

734
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,780
and the FDA protect the interest of our
federal government and they keep the

735
00:29:29,971 --> 00:29:33,030
money all in the pool to themselves and
they don't want anybody else in.

736
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,830
And I feel like it's just greed.

737
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,120
It's total greed.
It's not.

738
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,710
Has nothing to do with it being
dangerous.

739
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,800
Well,
we're definitely more aware of that kind

740
00:29:40,801 --> 00:29:45,490
of and those kinds of compromises where
these companies compromise various

741
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:47,890
branches of the government for their own
personal interest.

742
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:53,370
And this Kratom is a perfect example of
that because so many people including me

743
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,410
know almost nothing about it.
This is a weird one.

744
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:59,380
You know,
this is one where they almost got in

745
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,870
like before people could understand
what,

746
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,720
what exactly it was,
which is rare in 2016.

747
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,020
There's something like that available.
They've never had anything like this.

748
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:11,020
The Dea has never seen a reply like
this.

749
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:14,290
There was 100,000 people that signed a
petition,

750
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,530
but one thing that I need to get out
there to everybody,

751
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,260
one,
the one way we can keep this legal and

752
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:23,980
keep other things legal as well is
everybody needs to go to a website that

753
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:24,940
the dea is set up.

754
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,940
It's called Kratom comments.org.
So just Kra tlm comments.org.

755
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,500
You can go there and you can leave,
you know,

756
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,390
up to 5,000 word message.
You know about Kratom and it doesn't

757
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:40,060
have to be from somebody who takes it.
Like you could just be like,

758
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:40,930
hey,
I think this should,

759
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,300
I watched it,
this podcast and I,

760
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:45,870
I really feel this needs to be
researched more and you know,

761
00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:49,180
whatever,
whatever you feel needs to be said.

762
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,650
You can just say it here.
So you know,

763
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:54,910
like I went on and I left a comment
about why I use it and what I like about

764
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:58,300
it and I feel like everybody that does
needs to do that or they're not doing

765
00:30:58,301 --> 00:31:00,400
their job.
And what does that put that back up

766
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:00,911
again?
Jamie,

767
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:02,470
please.
It says December 20,

768
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,870
first December,
first deadline.

769
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,060
Submit your comments now what is the
deadline?

770
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,923
Well,
that's why.

771
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,440
That's why I was a pain in the ass and
kept texting you because I was like,

772
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:13,150
dude,
can we get on before this deadline?

773
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,340
Well,
it's very important that people know

774
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:18,610
that there's a deadline for these
comments and it's in a couple days.

775
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:21,550
It's December first and if you make a
comment by December first,

776
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,330
the dea has to read it like they have to
look at it.

777
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,580
So even if you write a bunch of
Jibberish they have to read it,

778
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:28,930
which is kind of funny now.
But don't,

779
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,000
don't do that though folks.
They'll go,

780
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,010
he's on Kratom and Kenny can't spell.
No,

781
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,860
but I'm saying they have to.
They have to look at all of them.

782
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:39,460
So if we can get 10,000 comments,
I think there's maybe half that right

783
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:41,260
now.
And your show is so powerful.

784
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,140
If we can get 10,000 comments then this
is going to stay legal.

785
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,040
Wow.
So it was supposed to be scheduled one.

786
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,920
They had a plan to make a schedule one a
while ago.

787
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,260
Very interesting.
The dea only has one option.

788
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,380
The only.
The DEA has an emergency scheduling.

789
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,360
So there was a drug called [inaudible].
Have you ever heard of flocker?

790
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,710
No.
Jamie can you look up Flocka Fla kkr

791
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,140
because you have to see this.
Flocka was a drug in Florida where

792
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:07,760
everybody was going crazy.
They were like smashing shit and like

793
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,530
they were like smashing through their
car windows and jumping on cars and they

794
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:15,610
were like zombies and that got banned
like immediately and nobody.

795
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,560
There was no,
like there was nobody that stuck up know

796
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,880
produce killer drug.
Yeah.

797
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,050
Well that was something.
So you made him crazy.

798
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:23,884
Yeah.
Anyway.

799
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,630
Well you see like what some of these
people do like paypal,

800
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,740
God that goes on there on Flakka is that
real?

801
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,600
But see what happens is,
I don't know,

802
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,610
I don't know.
It's a synthetic drug,

803
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,940
so I think Kratom gets lumped in with
these synthetic drugs like spice and

804
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,630
Flocka that are like,
watch this guy jumps into the back of

805
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:43,460
the car.
Oh my God.

806
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,550
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

807
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,330
See,
like what the fuck this is someone on

808
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:51,710
Flocka.
Holy Shit.

809
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,580
Can you imagine that's like that.
That's like that movie it goes flying

810
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:58,010
off the car back into the car.
It's amazing.

811
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,413
Whoa.

812
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,950
What the fuck?
Why am I not getting this guy smashing?

813
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,220
You know?
Oh my God,

814
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,740
that's like the most entertaining video
I've ever seen.

815
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:11,120
So even if it's not real,
I love it,

816
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:15,230
but I think it was a drug that they were
selling in head shops down in Florida

817
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,400
and it got banned within like,
I dunno,

818
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:22,530
a couple months of it being always
fucking Florida guys always handled

819
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,460
Florida.
The gateway to demonic possession.

820
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,400
I was saying that seems like that's like
I am legend.

821
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:32,120
Like they'll fucking crazy things from
the will smith movie monsters.

822
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:34,400
Yeah.
So this guy jumped on this guy's hood

823
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:35,930
and he's trying to shake them off.
Is that what happened?

824
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,520
What I'm saying is that when we sell
things,

825
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,920
you know,
things that they sell in,

826
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,100
in head shops like old spice members,
spice was a synthetic marijuana.

827
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,920
And the problem with it is that,
um,

828
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:47,270
a lot of times they're unregulated.

829
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,520
Like nobody know that spice just came on
the market.

830
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:51,980
There was no regulation.
They were selling in head shops.

831
00:33:51,981 --> 00:33:54,590
They were getting away for like,
I think everybody puts this stuff on the

832
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:57,020
market to get away with it.
But when Kratom was put it on the

833
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:58,820
market,
it wasn't put on the market to get away

834
00:33:58,821 --> 00:33:59,730
with it.
You know,

835
00:33:59,731 --> 00:34:01,010
it,
it's been in like,

836
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,670
the problem is like there's a,
there's a law in America called the act.

837
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,600
Have you heard of that?
It's a to Shay is basically the dietary

838
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:10,490
supplement health something act,
right?

839
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,190
I forget.
But basically what it does is anything

840
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,280
that was on the market before 1994 gets
grandfathered in and is illegal

841
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:20,450
supplement.
So like even if they didn't do the

842
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:24,860
research on it or whatever before 1994.
And that's something that Orrin hatch

843
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:27,470
put in place to kind of keep the
supplement industry,

844
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,910
you know,
it helped to supplement companies.

845
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,790
It doesn't help us as a consumer because
we don't know what we're getting because

846
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:33,680
there's no regulation.
But um,

847
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,420
but I feel like that,
you know,

848
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:39,890
that the Shea Act says if there was a
supplement on the market before 1994,

849
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:43,850
um,
that it needs to stay legal and flow and

850
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:46,670
um,
Kratom has been sold in Florida.

851
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,770
They've been selling it for 30 years.
You know,

852
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:51,740
they've been selling it before 1994.
So I'm actually just trying,

853
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,630
I'm,
I'm actually went to the freedom of

854
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:58,631
Information Act and summons the records
we saw in the records for importation of

855
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:00,860
Kratom.
Now if we can prove that Kratom's been

856
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:03,320
imported to the United States before
1994,

857
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:05,230
we have a pretty solid case to say,
you know,

858
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,800
look,
this gets grandfathered in just like

859
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:07,910
everything else.
Wow.

860
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:10,400
So we grandfathered in as a nutritional
supplement.

861
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,541
I don't know.
I mean it's,

862
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,130
I'm sure they're gonna make it harder
than that,

863
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,780
you know,
I'm sure like if we have the proof,

864
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,670
but I'm just going at at full blast,
you know,

865
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:19,870
I feel like if you go out something with
everything you got and he,

866
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,030
and you look down every avenue,
you're going to find something.

867
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,050
You know,
it's kind of like a,

868
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,450
I feel like a lawyer right now.
Wow.

869
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,020
What a strange predicament.
But it's very unusual that there's

870
00:35:30,021 --> 00:35:32,810
something that's this well loved by the
people that are taking it.

871
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:35,660
But so little is known about it by most
people,

872
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:37,860
including me.
I have to say something that's very

873
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:40,290
important.
The people that are against Kratom are

874
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,880
just against the fact that they don't
know a lot about it there.

875
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,890
There's very few people that are like
really dead set against it.

876
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:50,430
There's a congresswoman down in Florida
who's dead set against it because they

877
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:53,940
want to boost their election.
They want,

878
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,860
they want people to vote for them,
so they say,

879
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:57,060
oh,
we took this off the street.

880
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:59,430
We saved your children,
and like she doesn't really know nothing

881
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:02,900
about Kratom like to make it illegal.
What has she said about it?

882
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,733
Does she?
She said,

883
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,520
she told me,
this is great.

884
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,770
You didn't interview her.
I interviewed her down in Florida and

885
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:09,480
she told me that,
you know,

886
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,820
look,
when you talk to a mother who,

887
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,790
whose baby was born addicted to Kratom,
she's like,

888
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,710
that's going to change you.
And I said,

889
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:19,740
can you get me that mother's name,
address and phone numbers so we can

890
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:21,320
contact her a?
Yeah,

891
00:36:21,321 --> 00:36:21,691
yeah,
sure.

892
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:23,520
We'll get around to it.
They've never produced that.

893
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:26,670
We've asked them for aiming.
There really was a mother who was

894
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:28,920
addicted to them.
We've asked three or four times and we

895
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:31,980
haven't gotten it however,
however I did an interview,

896
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:36,060
a girl in Washington dc who said that
her baby was born,

897
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,630
she was born,
her baby was born addicted to opiates

898
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,420
and that was a terrible,
terrible thing that she had to go

899
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:45,570
through and um,
and now she takes Kratom and she's fine

900
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,900
and she's not going to relapse and
she'll be fine and her daughter ended up

901
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:50,010
being fine and stuff like that.

902
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,430
So what I'm saying is like these opiates
or what people will be born addicted to

903
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:54,871
Kratom,
you know,

904
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:57,990
they're looking down the wrong.
They're looking down the wrong rabbit

905
00:36:57,991 --> 00:36:58,390
hole,
you know,

906
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,250
like,
you know.

907
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,810
So does Kratom have any potential
addictive side effects?

908
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,690
Is that we don't know.
It's hard to tell.

909
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,011
You know,
I,

910
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:07,980
I,
I can give you.

911
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,920
How often do you take it?
I take it usually every day,

912
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,360
but I can give you some anecdotal
evidence that I went to Thailand for two

913
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:19,350
weeks a couple months ago and I had been
taking Kratom for four months straight.

914
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,340
Then I had a two week in Thailand.
We were actually shooting a kickboxer

915
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,050
movie and after,
uh,

916
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,660
after I got back from Thailand,
uh,

917
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:30,230
I wasn't,
I wasn't Jonesing for Kratom like I,

918
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,430
I didn't take it for two weeks because
it's illegal there.

919
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,620
So there was a reason it is illegal
there.

920
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,460
Yeah.
Like the last,

921
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,340
like I've never been to Thailand and
last thing I want to do is show up to

922
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:41,310
Thailand and end up in Thai prison.
Yeah.

923
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:43,260
That doesn't sound fun now.
It doesn't sound fun at all.

924
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,081
So I was like,
you know,

925
00:37:44,081 --> 00:37:46,830
I was like maybe maybe they don't even
take this seriously there and maybe it's

926
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,090
bullshit,
but I'm not bringing it.

927
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,490
But it is illegal over there.
Uh,

928
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:51,780
yeah,
it's illegal in Thailand,

929
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:52,920
you know,
why it's illegal in Thailand.

930
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:54,590
This is like,
it's really interesting because we

931
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,240
looked at,
this is what they call it.

932
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,030
It's like a kind of a tie,
a tie name.

933
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,710
But the reason why it's illegal in
Thailand is because it was cutting into

934
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:07,120
the opium profits.
Oh Jesus.

935
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:11,910
So what happens is people probably
exactly the same pressure over here.

936
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,130
Exactly.
So hills just happened in the forties,

937
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,990
1942 or three.

938
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,380
They a ban Kratom and they wanted it.
They basically kept it illegal because

939
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:23,150
it was cutting into the money.
The people,

940
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,770
people were taking it instead of opium
instead of heroin.

941
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,090
Wow.
And that's the same thing that's gonna

942
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,800
happen in this country,
but it's going to be different in this

943
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:33,450
country.
It's going to solve a problem.

944
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,640
You know,
is,

945
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,290
is opium legal and Thailand,
I don't think it's illegal,

946
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:39,640
but like I think even,
you know,

947
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:44,050
it's like they just try to get it gay
Kratom Kratom out so that nobody was

948
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:44,831
taking it.
Oh,

949
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:47,110
I understand.
So the people that were profiting off of

950
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,590
freedoms more illegal than opium,
if that makes sense.

951
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:53,260
That's hilarious.
Wow.

952
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,610
What a weird rabbit hole this is.
Yeah.

953
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,241
The whole,
you know,

954
00:38:59,241 --> 00:39:02,560
to me the whole thing is interesting
because I completely get the other side.

955
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,660
I don't want anybody taking something
that's unsafe.

956
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:06,440
I don't want to market something that's
unsafe,

957
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,320
but I don't make a dime from selling
Kratom.

958
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,280
Like,
that's not right.

959
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:11,740
You're not selling it.
That's not where my income comes from.

960
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:13,170
And I'm not going to sell it,
so it's like,

961
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,620
it's not something where I'm like,
hey man,

962
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:17,020
I can make billions of dollars off this.
Let me just go.

963
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,260
Not only that,
if anybody would have a an interest in

964
00:39:20,261 --> 00:39:22,270
not promoting something that's
addictive,

965
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:25,840
it would be a guy like you as an
intimate knowledge of what it's like to

966
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:27,600
be addictive and under the spell.
Sure.

967
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:31,240
I think addiction needs to be looked at
in a certain way though,

968
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,040
where you look at addiction and you go
like,

969
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,990
okay,
I'm addicted to coffee.

970
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,460
It's no big deal.
You know,

971
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:37,940
like what is that going to?
What is,

972
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,840
what's the problem?
What's the problem being like people are

973
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:41,890
addicted to coffee.
What's right.

974
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,590
There really is no problem.
Addicted to coffee,

975
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,990
addicted to sugar will lead to problems
down the road.

976
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,510
But not a problem today.
Addicted to cigarettes,

977
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:51,340
lead to problems down the road,
but not a problem today.

978
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,410
You know?
So we don't really know.

979
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:56,860
There's not any long term studies to
show that Kratom is good in the long

980
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,460
term.
There's not any interest studies,

981
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,450
but we can go by the evidence that we do
have,

982
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,160
you know,
and they've done a lot of studies in

983
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:06,400
mice and all the studies and in mice,
like none of the mice die,

984
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,890
you know,
they're not the.

985
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,530
And,
and the number one opiate addiction

986
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:14,600
study they did was at a university of
all,

987
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,900
it's all miss whatever that Mississippi.

988
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,430
So Ole Miss,
um,

989
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:21,520
Christopher mccurdy,
he's a guy that are doing the research

990
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:26,140
and he really feels that this could be
the savior for the opiod epidemic.

991
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,030
He feels that they need to make it
stronger.

992
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:32,140
He feels they need to extract it,
make it stronger and that would be used

993
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:35,140
for the opiate epidemic.
So that's why I said I think there is

994
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,220
potential for it to be studied as both a
dietary supplement and as a drug,

995
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,430
because if you can,
if you can make something out of Kratom

996
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,620
that's gonna help a lot of people,
you know,

997
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,850
it's like,
what's the big.

998
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,300
I don't really see it as a big problem
if,

999
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,200
if it could be both.
Right.

1000
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,090
You know what I mean?
Like let them make their money and

1001
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:53,530
whatever,
but keep it legal for us.

1002
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,990
So in doing your documentary,
what have you,

1003
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,750
what have you learned about the push to
try to make it illegal?

1004
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,100
And when,
when did it all start?

1005
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,550
It all started I think,
um,

1006
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,660
shoot.
When did it start?

1007
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,010
Started?
Like over the summer.

1008
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,280
I actually started doing the documentary
a little bit before it.

1009
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,380
I was like,
well maybe if people she should know

1010
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:12,580
about this,
maybe this is something.

1011
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:14,740
So you were doing it just to let people
know about it.

1012
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:17,050
And then along the way it started to be
threatened.

1013
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,890
He was weird.
It was like I started doing it going

1014
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,660
like,
is this going to be a movie or is this

1015
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:24,190
more like an infomercial?
Like what is,

1016
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,780
what is this going to be,
you know,

1017
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,790
like I don't,
I don't want it to be like an

1018
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:30,010
infomercial because I'm not selling it
and making money off of it.

1019
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,040
I want it to be something that's very
honest about what product does.

1020
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,190
And so to me,
the ban and the controversy is the best

1021
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:40,250
thing that could ever happen because now
people know about it and they're aware

1022
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,710
as long as it doesn't get banned,
we're okay.

1023
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,550
You have a knack for that.
You know,

1024
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,970
we think about it like in prescription
thugs,

1025
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:51,971
you're making this documentary on pill
addiction and then you get hurt during

1026
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:54,980
the middle of it,
started taking pills and become addicted

1027
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:57,260
to pills during the middle of a
documentary on pill addiction.

1028
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,030
How many there are blessed or cursed?
I don't know.

1029
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,350
I don't know what that is.
You know,

1030
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,840
you.
You might fucking manifested or

1031
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:03,674
something,
man.

1032
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,620
I hope not because actually the next
documentary is about cancer.

1033
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,350
Oh,
well the reason I'm doing that,

1034
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,690
the reason I do all my documentaries is
because,

1035
00:42:11,691 --> 00:42:13,790
like I said,
we have the power to change the way

1036
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:17,810
people think and we have the power to
open up people's minds about things that

1037
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:20,450
they might not know about well and also
explore things.

1038
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,030
You're very good at exploring things in
a very objective way,

1039
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:27,890
in a very honest way.
And I think that that's so important in

1040
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:31,400
today's day and age because it's so hard
to know where,

1041
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,760
why a person's promoting something in
one way or not promoting something in

1042
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:37,700
another way.
It's like,

1043
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,730
what is the interest behind it?
What's the motivation behind it?

1044
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,590
Sure.
So to know that there's a guy like you

1045
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:45,980
who's doing this stuff,
just completely honest and open and raw

1046
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:46,880
like that.
It's very,

1047
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:48,320
very important.
Well thank you.

1048
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:50,000
I really appreciate it.
Like number one,

1049
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,680
be being respected by somebody like you.
I just means so much to me because,

1050
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,720
you know,
all my life I'll ever wanted to do is

1051
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:58,220
like,
I always wanted to prove myself.

1052
00:42:58,221 --> 00:43:00,230
I always thought I had to prove myself
as a kid.

1053
00:43:00,231 --> 00:43:01,580
Like Oh,
I did this or that,

1054
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:04,610
but I feel like these movies just kind
of automatically do that for me.

1055
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:08,120
I think you've been like automatically
validating like everything I've tried to

1056
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:09,050
do my whole life,
you know,

1057
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,100
I wanted to be a big feature film maker
and make Arnold Schwarzenegger movies

1058
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,770
and that couldn't be the.
That's the furthest thing from my mind

1059
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:20,330
right now is to make movies that are big
action movies that are mindless.

1060
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,050
I want to make big,
you know,

1061
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,070
big documentaries that are smart.
Well,

1062
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,480
it's interesting as life goes on and you
know,

1063
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:30,020
you change and evolve and you know,
your motivations changed.

1064
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:31,990
But I,
I recommend your movies still.

1065
00:43:31,991 --> 00:43:32,880
A lot of people,
man,

1066
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,840
particularly the prescription thugs
because of this.

1067
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,210
So many issues that have come up over
the last,

1068
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,490
you know,
it seems like the last couple of decades

1069
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:44,510
in this country are just unprecedented
numbers of people that are addicted to

1070
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,070
pills.
It's crazy.

1071
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:49,610
There's a couple of million people
walking around completely checked out

1072
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,750
and I feel like,
uh,

1073
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,780
it,
it definitely needs to be.

1074
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,100
I,
I still,

1075
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:59,240
I can't wrap my mind around why the
government hasn't stepped in and said we

1076
00:43:59,241 --> 00:44:02,000
have to fight this opioid epidemic.
I think they're getting paid off.

1077
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,540
Why isn't the government putting,
making the companies that make

1078
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:06,590
oxycontin?
Like for example,

1079
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:07,880
purdue Pharma,
purdue,

1080
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:10,720
Pharma admitted like we got all these
people addicted.

1081
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,980
We lied to doctors,
they admitted it and they got fined.

1082
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,760
But the fine was only like a little tiny
percent of what they made you get fined

1083
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:19,130
200 million,
or even if you get fined a billion

1084
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,210
dollars,
he made $8,000,000,000.

1085
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:22,520
Who Cares?
You don't even feel it because you're

1086
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:25,820
going to make another billion next year.
And after that actually call it the

1087
00:44:25,821 --> 00:44:28,640
price of doing business.
They build into those fines into,

1088
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:29,960
you know,
into the product.

1089
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:31,010
So they know,
hey,

1090
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,040
we're probably going to get fined on

1091
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,370
this for 400 million.
Let's just build it into the cost of the

1092
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:35,941
drug.
I mean,

1093
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:38,640
it's,
it's an insane system that we have here

1094
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,830
for products that are supposed to help
people.

1095
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,990
Well,
it's also this disingenuous thing that

1096
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:44,880
politicians do with it.
Pretend they're looking out for the

1097
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:45,720
people,
but yet,

1098
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,420
how are you,
how come you haven't heard a single

1099
00:44:48,421 --> 00:44:51,060
politician in decades?
Say a word about cigarettes?

1100
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,840
Obama got into office,
he was smoking cigarettes,

1101
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:54,990
got in,
which is just,

1102
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:59,310
that's half a million people just in
this country die prematurely every year

1103
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:00,450
because of that.
And I think,

1104
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:01,021
uh,
you know,

1105
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:03,660
if we look at tobacco and we look at the
problems with tobacco,

1106
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,680
what's the big problems with it?
They put all these chemicals in the

1107
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:09,960
tobacco and if they could just pan that.
Let me,

1108
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:12,270
I don't think actual natural tobacco is
that bad for you?

1109
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,370
Well,
how many people are dying from cigars?

1110
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,900
Not a lot.
Not a lot.

1111
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:16,681
Not,
not that I know.

1112
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:19,170
I mean maybe it's abuse.
Maybe if you get crazy with it,

1113
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:21,690
but that's kinda like wine and the wine
is great.

1114
00:45:21,691 --> 00:45:24,120
But if you drink wine like four or five
bottles a day,

1115
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:25,450
you're going to kill your liver.
Yeah.

1116
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,320
It's just like so many things like
things like that,

1117
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:32,220
like wine and wine feels like kind of
like Kratom has this sort of self

1118
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:33,900
limiting thing.
Like wine.

1119
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:37,890
You could drink too much of it,
but if it feels so shitty and it's like

1120
00:45:37,891 --> 00:45:40,380
Kratom is kind of the same way.
Like as you take too much of it,

1121
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:44,250
you'll just feel so crappy that year.
You're going to know never to do that

1122
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:45,290
again.
Where does it do?

1123
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,650
How does it make you feel?
Crappy,

1124
00:45:46,651 --> 00:45:49,530
because you said yes too much,
just stomach aches,

1125
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,090
nausea,
um,

1126
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,640
you know,
and when I say so I guess I should,

1127
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,570
I should mentioned that.

1128
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:57,390
What I actually took,
I don't even know if it was Kratom when

1129
00:45:57,391 --> 00:45:59,370
I took was a product and I'll never do
this again.

1130
00:45:59,371 --> 00:46:01,250
It was,
it was like some extract as somebody

1131
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:03,390
gave me and I tried it and that's what
made me sick.

1132
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,240
So it could have been way stronger than
regular Kratom.

1133
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:07,470
There could have been something else in
it,

1134
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:10,050
but that's sort of,
that was my first like,

1135
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,760
okay,
be smart about this.

1136
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,930
Look at the,
look at the packaging and a lot,

1137
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:16,500
a lot.
A big problem with Kratom is most of the

1138
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:19,800
cranium that's on the market.
This is the only company in the entire

1139
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:23,190
country or world that packages credit.
I'm like a dietary supplement.

1140
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:24,990
Every other supplement,
if you look on the back,

1141
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,240
it'll say right here,
not for human consumption.

1142
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,610
That's problem.
Can they.

1143
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:30,840
Can people buy this right now?
Yeah.

1144
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,693
They could buy it.
Yeah,

1145
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,820
for now.
Sure.

1146
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,370
Yeah.
In this company is from Vegas so that

1147
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,240
they do a lot of business in Vegas to
actually in health food stores in Vegas.

1148
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:40,830
Explain it to people so they could get
an.

1149
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,010
Obviously you nor I have any stake in
this at all.

1150
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,100
This is called urban ice urban ice
organics.

1151
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,000
They have a website.
Yeah.

1152
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:51,220
They have a website,
I believe it's urban ice organics.com or

1153
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,970
urbanites.com.
I'm not even sure if they tell you the

1154
00:46:53,971 --> 00:46:55,830
truth,
but um,

1155
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:59,280
any,
any like head shop should have Kratom

1156
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,200
um,
they saw a lot of this in Vegas.

1157
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:03,520
So in Vegas it's all over.
Um,

1158
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,490
but you know what the other thing we
talked about,

1159
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:09,000
it's like why are they making illegal?
The Guy who owns this company made a lot

1160
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:10,680
of money off of it and I'm sure you
know,

1161
00:47:10,681 --> 00:47:11,820
millions and millions of dollars.

1162
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,100
So like when you make millions and
millions of dollars,

1163
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:15,390
people want to know like,
hey dude,

1164
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,150
you didn't go through the process.
And I think we are.

1165
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:22,680
Kelly and I were just talking like what
the process to make something a,

1166
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,380
you know,
dietary supplement is a long arduous

1167
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,500
process and I feel like Kratom may need
to go through that process because like

1168
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,740
we don't have enough information on it
and it hadn't been studied.

1169
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,200
It's sort of something that slipped
through the cracks.

1170
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:38,650
Like nobody really knew about it.
It wasn't that popular and it's been

1171
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:41,170
around for 2000 years and no one ever
decided to say,

1172
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:42,970
hey,
this is a dietary supplement.

1173
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,160
Wow.
Now these other ones that you were

1174
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:47,320
talking about,
the other ones when you were saying if

1175
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,490
this gets illegal,
there's,

1176
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,050
there's similar name those again,
what does it against?

1177
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:53,800
Our esop I think is one of them and Aka
Yuma,

1178
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:55,840
which is like,
I don't think it's Japanese or

1179
00:47:55,841 --> 00:47:58,690
something,
but Aka Uma and soursop.

1180
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,220
I've never tried them.
I don't know.

1181
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,250
I've just read about them,
but they have a similar effect.

1182
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,570
Allegedly.
That's what it says.

1183
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:05,650
Yeah.
That's what they say.

1184
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,570
But there haven't been as popular so
maybe,

1185
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,260
you know,
like,

1186
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,470
I feel like they're not as popular
because it probably not as good or

1187
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,110
strong,
but I don't know man.

1188
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:19,230
So what do we have isolated?
Like what is the pressure to try to get

1189
00:48:20,921 --> 00:48:22,510
it illegal?
Yeah,

1190
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:24,970
we,
we've kept trying to isolate,

1191
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,250
you know,
and we've talked to the people that are

1192
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:31,480
against it and their congress people
that are against it are grieving parents

1193
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:33,100
that are against it.
Um,

1194
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:33,971
we,
you know,

1195
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:35,890
like nobody in big Pharma is going to
come out and say,

1196
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:37,670
hey,
we're going to make this a drug and

1197
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:38,580
screw all you.
Like,

1198
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:41,800
they're not going to really say that.
So it's really when you get into

1199
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:43,840
Washington,
like we were just in Washington for a

1200
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,270
week and everything so shady and
underhanded in my mind,

1201
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,540
like all these people are,
are working together.

1202
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,740
They're all in cahoots,
you know,

1203
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:53,800
like everything's in everything seemed
to be like,

1204
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,630
I don't know,
just the,

1205
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,990
the congressman that I talked to mark
Pocan from Wisconsin,

1206
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,410
a marijuana and create them or both
illegal there and he's kind of fighting

1207
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:04,330
for it to be legal.
And like I said,

1208
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:07,690
he's one of the only congress people I
met that was willing to go to bat for

1209
00:49:07,691 --> 00:49:10,480
these kinds of things.
And I think we need more congress people

1210
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:13,180
like that,
that are looking out for the citizens.

1211
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:15,610
So there are state laws against it.
Uh,

1212
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,730
there's six states,
I believe that I've Ban Kratom.

1213
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,340
I think they're Wisconsin's one of them.
Uh,

1214
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,920
Tennessee,
Alabama,

1215
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,500
and I'll remember the rest of them,
but there's a couple of states where

1216
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:29,890
it's band.
And what do they cite when they say

1217
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:31,090
that?
It's deaths,

1218
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,630
deaths and danger and kids taking it,
you know,

1219
00:49:34,631 --> 00:49:37,570
everything's about protecting the
children and saving the children.

1220
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,880
But you know,
none of the people in the Kratom

1221
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,713
Industry,
I've never said like,

1222
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,310
hey,
let's age restrict this,

1223
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,150
let's make it,
you know,

1224
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,410
21 and over 18 and over are 25 and
older.

1225
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,253
It doesn't,
you know,

1226
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:48,880
whatever,
whatever they want to do.

1227
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:51,880
Like no one's even the FDA has never
even come and taught like it's

1228
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:55,240
impossible and this is the big problem.
It's impossible to talk to the FDA or

1229
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,850
dea.
I just spoke to the,

1230
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:01,900
the spokesman for the dea last week,
Melvin Patterson and I said,

1231
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:04,570
hey Mr Patterson,
I would really like to come down and do

1232
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:06,460
an interview with you.
He's like,

1233
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,230
Oh yeah,
sorry we don't do that and I want to say

1234
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,150
about you work for me.
Like you know,

1235
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,940
we pay,
we pay their salaries.

1236
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:15,370
I know people here that will done.
But like I think there just needs to be

1237
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:19,360
more transparency 100 percent in the dea
and the FDA.

1238
00:50:19,361 --> 00:50:22,090
You can't find out the FDA's like
scientology.

1239
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:24,010
Like you can't find out anything about
it.

1240
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:26,470
Like when you try to do research on and
try to find out,

1241
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,980
you know,
who's doing what or whatever,

1242
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,880
there's not a whole lot of transparency
and that's why documentary film makers

1243
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:36,290
like me have to use like the freedom of
freedom of Information Act where if we

1244
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:38,350
request something from the government,
you know,

1245
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,030
they have to give it to us and that's
something that really helps us.

1246
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,120
So this is a,
we were talking about what a rabbit hole

1247
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:45,950
this is,
but this is a weird rabbit hole for you

1248
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:47,650
to have started this out as something
like,

1249
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:49,400
you're,
you're finding this plant to be

1250
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:51,050
beneficial.
You see all these people that are

1251
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:52,310
benefiting from it and you're like,
hey,

1252
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,590
this is a great subject.
I want to let the world know about it.

1253
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,860
And then as you're doing it,
it's theirs.

1254
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,770
You start feeling this dark push for it
to be scheduled one and,

1255
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:03,500
and just start making illegal.
What's that journey been like?

1256
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,570
I'm weird.

1257
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:09,290
You know,
I think I'm scary a little bit because

1258
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:11,600
uh,
he started this thing and I thought it

1259
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,640
was just going to go down to two.
I mean,

1260
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:16,640
I thought they were going to maybe make
it illegal and then you know,

1261
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,450
maybe we have nothing.
You know what,

1262
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,330
once you make something a schedule one
drug,

1263
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:22,060
it's impossible.
Ask The people matter.

1264
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,110
The marijuana people,
it's impossible to take it off the

1265
00:51:24,111 --> 00:51:25,280
schedule one,
it's,

1266
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:29,150
it can happen but it's really hard.
So I think that the idea is not to get

1267
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,610
it there in the first place,
whether it was talking about the dea

1268
00:51:31,611 --> 00:51:34,940
removing marijuana from schedule one
this summer and they backed out of it.

1269
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,940
They were just.
I just read some more about that today.

1270
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:39,700
That's still kind of up in the air,
Huh?

1271
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:42,680
Well they got close to it and they said
they were going to reconsider it and

1272
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:44,360
apparently a lot of people were very
helpful.

1273
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,220
They thought this is gonna be at
scheduled ones.

1274
00:51:46,221 --> 00:51:47,900
Ridiculous.
No medicinal value.

1275
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:52,580
I mean they've shown marijuana to cure
some forms of cancer to say there's no

1276
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:55,100
medicinal value for it is completely
ridiculous.

1277
00:51:55,101 --> 00:52:00,101
We need to start dumping our money into
researching these plants because like

1278
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,410
how like look,
you have these Pharma companies and I

1279
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:05,960
don't know if you've seen this shell on
discovery where they show you how they

1280
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:08,600
come up with new drugs.
They basically take like there's a

1281
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:11,870
machine and it's like this fucking robot
and it takes like every fucking

1282
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:16,700
substance in the world and combines it
until like it makes millions and

1283
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,940
millions of different,
different kinds of fucking like things,

1284
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,730
you know,
different kinds of drugs and then they

1285
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:25,730
start testing it on like every different
disease to see if it works.

1286
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,250
So it's like it's like shooting in the
dark.

1287
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,360
It's like they have no,
like they're like there's a machine that

1288
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:34,760
will just make a drug and then they
figure out if it works on something

1289
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,130
rather than like we already know that
Kratom works for this,

1290
00:52:37,131 --> 00:52:39,350
this and this and we already know that
marijuana works for this,

1291
00:52:39,351 --> 00:52:39,740
this and this.

1292
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,800
Why not put the money into studying that
rather than the shooting in the dark,

1293
00:52:42,801 --> 00:52:46,200
making some weird combination.
Have you seen that?

1294
00:52:46,201 --> 00:52:46,611
That.
No,

1295
00:52:46,611 --> 00:52:49,580
I haven't seen it at all.
I have to find that sounds almost like

1296
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,650
that.
That sounds like a.

1297
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,690
they're like,
you know,

1298
00:52:53,691 --> 00:52:56,770
the like they use those algorithms to
try to work the stock market.

1299
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,780
That's something similar.
It just throwing numbers up.

1300
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:01,940
Yeah.
Well there's a lot of them to come out

1301
00:53:01,941 --> 00:53:02,721
real bad.
I mean,

1302
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:06,170
I know a dude who had a stroke,
a young guy from Vioxx.

1303
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,400
That stuff.
Yeah.

1304
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,020
You probably know about that.
Arthritis,

1305
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:11,360
arthritis medication.
Yeah.

1306
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:13,910
I know the guy in his thirties.
Who the Fuck Australian.

1307
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,773
That stuff.
Yeah.

1308
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:15,440
Yeah.
See,

1309
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,180
that's this.
They pulled it off the market.

1310
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,740
Yeah.
They pulled that off the market.

1311
00:53:18,741 --> 00:53:23,741
I think there was 55,000 deaths from
Vioxx and Kratom zero.

1312
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,040
Oh,
weird marijuana.

1313
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,020
How many strange.
Yeah,

1314
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,510
man.
That's A.

1315
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,270
There's a business in selling people
pills.

1316
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,280
You know,
living in a twisted world we live in.

1317
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,180
People are going to keep that from
somebody who's in pain is ridiculous.

1318
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,100
Well,
I'm hoping that as time goes on,

1319
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:45,600
we're slowly starting to understand that
it is impossible for your doctor to know

1320
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:48,300
all the ramifications and repercussions.
Sure.

1321
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,340
Involved in any.
Any drug.

1322
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,660
Yup.
And there's just no way.

1323
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:55,650
I was just on the show,
the doctors with a doctor whose son was

1324
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:59,400
taking Kratom,
he found his son was a drug addict and

1325
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:02,100
he kind of found out about it.
And then his son said,

1326
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,450
dad,
I'm going to get off all the heroin.

1327
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:06,600
I'm going to start taking Kratom.
And he said his son has been on Kratom

1328
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:08,160
now for,
I don't know,

1329
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,600
like six months.
He's been sober.

1330
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:14,250
He had been happier than he's ever been
and this doctor is 100 percent down with

1331
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:14,400
it.

1332
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,370
And he was on the show,
the doctors with me and he was arguing

1333
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,480
with,
you know,

1334
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:22,500
there's a guy from a.
what's that show intervention.

1335
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:26,370
One of the dudes from intervention was
on the doctors with us arguing like,

1336
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:27,930
yeah,
people get addicted to Kratom all the

1337
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:28,621
time.
It's like,

1338
00:54:28,621 --> 00:54:30,270
dude,
you're a marketing guy.

1339
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,460
Like these people in Rehab,
like you gotta understand.

1340
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:37,050
The reason why if you Google Kratom
rehabs come up is because rehabs have

1341
00:54:37,051 --> 00:54:39,120
marketing teams,
they're trying to get as many people

1342
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:42,360
into the doors as they can.
So they tell you Kratom's bad and they

1343
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:46,050
put it on their website.
Narcan on is a big a rehab center.

1344
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:49,500
They're owned by scientologists and
they're all over the Kratom thing saying

1345
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:50,130
like,
Hey,

1346
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,900
are you addicted to Kratom?
Call us,

1347
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:52,830
you know,
and it's just like,

1348
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,280
I feel like the people that get addicted
to it,

1349
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:56,700
like I,
I went to Rehab,

1350
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,840
I've been in rehab that with people that
were there for marijuana and you want to

1351
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:01,800
just be like,
dude,

1352
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:03,150
what the fuck are you doing here?

1353
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:05,820
Like number celebrity rehab.
Yeah.

1354
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,780
Yeah.
But,

1355
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:09,300
but people do have a problem with it,
so it's okay.

1356
00:55:09,301 --> 00:55:14,280
Like you can go to rehab for anything.
So going for Kratom is no different than

1357
00:55:14,281 --> 00:55:16,300
going for like depression or some
gambling.

1358
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,180
You have to go to rehab for gamble.
So I don't,

1359
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:20,640
I don't know why they're marketing it to
people.

1360
00:55:20,641 --> 00:55:24,120
I think it's kind of sadistic in a way.
Like they're looking for people that are

1361
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:25,350
on Kratom,
you know that to,

1362
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,220
you know,
if.

1363
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,900
I Dunno,
I mean I don't know why they.

1364
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,480
Well they don't have any personal
experience with it.

1365
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:32,910
Maybe they're not as nefarious as we
think it is.

1366
00:55:32,911 --> 00:55:34,170
Maybe they just ignorant.
Sure.

1367
00:55:34,171 --> 00:55:35,760
And the and the good rehabs aren't doing
that.

1368
00:55:35,761 --> 00:55:37,950
I should say,
like when I went cliffside Malibu,

1369
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:40,590
they don't have a Kratom thing on their
website because there are legitimate

1370
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,873
rehab center.

1371
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,870
I was talking about celebrity rehab.
I remember when Eric Roberts was on.

1372
00:55:45,871 --> 00:55:49,470
It was hilarious.
Everybody else has shaken throwing up

1373
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,120
and sweating.
Eric Roberts sitting there with a

1374
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:53,940
newspaper or a cup of Costco,
get slippers on.

1375
00:55:53,941 --> 00:55:55,560
He was just in there for pot.
Yeah.

1376
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,810
Like there's no,
there was no withdrawal.

1377
00:55:57,811 --> 00:55:59,350
There was nothing happened.
You know,

1378
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:01,200
they go with what does it feel like?
He's like,

1379
00:56:01,201 --> 00:56:02,790
I feel fine.
I just,

1380
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:06,780
I just don't have weed.
Well the problem with when you tell

1381
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:09,030
somebody that they have a problem,
they start thinking,

1382
00:56:09,031 --> 00:56:10,170
fuck,
I have a problem.

1383
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:13,740
If you ever had a cop behind you and you
never did anything.

1384
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,370
No.
But you're like looking at both hands on

1385
00:56:16,371 --> 00:56:18,840
the wheel and yeah.
You feel like it has my license.

1386
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,510
My license is good.
I pay my insurance,

1387
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,890
I have a gun.
There's a gun in his.

1388
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:23,980
Why am I afraid of

1389
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,480
fucking freaking out?
Am I speeding?

1390
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:28,480
Not going the speed limit,
but meanwhile there's something.

1391
00:56:28,481 --> 00:56:30,040
If someone tells you,
Hey,

1392
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,380
you've got a problem,
you've got a problem,

1393
00:56:32,381 --> 00:56:34,210
you might not think you have a problem,
but you got a problem.

1394
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:36,220
Like fucking got a problem.
What's my problem?

1395
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,520
Your problem is Kratom,
or your problem is sex,

1396
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,410
or your problem is whatever the fuck it
is.

1397
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:43,040
Exercise.
You're addicted to exercise.

1398
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,130
If someone could tell you have a
problem,

1399
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:48,430
and then most of us are at least a
little insecure,

1400
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,370
almost everybody I know is at least a
little insecure and as soon as someone

1401
00:56:51,371 --> 00:56:52,700
accuses you of something,
you all,

1402
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:54,790
you start considering the possibility
there,

1403
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:55,610
right?

1404
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,140
Yeah.
And then sometimes you try to hide it

1405
00:56:57,141 --> 00:56:57,871
more.
Yes.

1406
00:56:57,871 --> 00:56:58,704
That's,
that's my,

1407
00:56:58,770 --> 00:56:59,421
my,
you know,

1408
00:56:59,421 --> 00:57:00,650
as an addict,
I was like,

1409
00:57:00,651 --> 00:57:01,130
okay,
well,

1410
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:02,630
not now they're onto me.
I better really,

1411
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:05,360
really hide this.
I had a conversation one day with my

1412
00:57:05,361 --> 00:57:06,800
dad.
I'll never forget it.

1413
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:08,540
My Dad is like the nicest person in the
world.

1414
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:10,790
You've seen him in the movies and one
day,

1415
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,440
um,
I was out of money.

1416
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,960
I'm in my forties and I'm out of money.
That's ridiculous.

1417
00:57:14,961 --> 00:57:16,610
That's stupid.
You know what I mean?

1418
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:19,220
Because I was.
But I was a drug addict so my dad said

1419
00:57:19,221 --> 00:57:20,840
to me,
I don't know what's wrong with you,

1420
00:57:20,841 --> 00:57:23,390
but I think you're a drug addict or an
alcoholic or something,

1421
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:26,570
but there's no reason why a guy in there
40 years old,

1422
00:57:26,571 --> 00:57:28,370
she'd be out of money.
And I'm like,

1423
00:57:28,371 --> 00:57:29,570
you know what man,
he's right.

1424
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:34,340
And that was that conversation that it
was about three months before I went to

1425
00:57:34,341 --> 00:57:36,200
Rehab.
But like that was the conversation.

1426
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:37,810
It was that conference.
It was,

1427
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:41,450
it was my dad being disappointed in me.
It was like that conversation that

1428
00:57:41,451 --> 00:57:44,300
really sort of shook me to the ground.
Like somebody telling me I had a

1429
00:57:44,301 --> 00:57:46,970
problem.
It kind of shook me to the core because

1430
00:57:46,971 --> 00:57:48,830
he yelled at me when he said it.
He never yelled at me.

1431
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,710
Wow.
Well sometimes that's all you need is

1432
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:53,690
one person's opinion.
Who you really love.

1433
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,100
Yeah.
Boot and the asked from dad.

1434
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:56,540
Yeah.
And you go shit.

1435
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,180
And my dad's been through everything.
You know,

1436
00:57:58,181 --> 00:58:01,600
he's had cancer.
He's add his half of the intestine

1437
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:04,060
pulled out,
he's had all these issues and they're

1438
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:06,940
not due to drugs or alcohol.
So it makes me feel even more guilty

1439
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,280
because like my issues are just due to
something I'm doing.

1440
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:10,400
Right,
right.

1441
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:11,570
Well,
except arthritis.

1442
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,060
Yeah.
But I'm feeling it now.

1443
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,040
I don't know what it's doing,
but something's going on.

1444
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,590
Got a boner now.
Does that happen?

1445
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,810
Probably warning.
No shit man.

1446
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:23,690
I wish.
Um,

1447
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,970
no.
Just uh,

1448
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:26,370
I feel good.
Um,

1449
00:58:26,371 --> 00:58:27,440
it doesn't,
it's not.

1450
00:58:27,441 --> 00:58:29,870
I'm not negatively affected me in any
way.

1451
00:58:29,871 --> 00:58:34,190
I don't feel slow or anything like that.
That's what I was assuming it was.

1452
00:58:34,191 --> 00:58:35,024
I mean,
literally today,

1453
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:38,060
one of the things that I wanted to do
before I'm talking to you about this,

1454
00:58:38,061 --> 00:58:42,920
I wanted to do no research because I
literally wanted to just go in with my

1455
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:45,380
ignorance so that I can question you
from ignorance.

1456
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:48,130
And interestingly enough,
if you try to do research,

1457
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:51,040
it's kind of a,
it's kind of biased right off the bat

1458
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:51,990
from Google.
Like when you,

1459
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,790
like I said,
when you search Kratom,

1460
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:57,340
a lot of times what comes up are the
rehab centers that are paying to be

1461
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:00,300
or let's try it right now.
And then if you type in Kratom band,

1462
00:59:00,301 --> 00:59:02,730
you'll get more of a across the board,
up and down,

1463
00:59:02,731 --> 00:59:04,700
you know,
I'm going to try it with being because

1464
00:59:04,701 --> 00:59:08,010
I've been using windows so let's see if
they have the same thing

1465
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:14,040
mark and I don't know.
Big is not bad man.

1466
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:15,990
I don't,
I don't have any problems with bang.

1467
00:59:15,991 --> 00:59:18,930
Okay.
Kratom read on Amazon Dot Com.

1468
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:20,970
See they try to sell you it.
Oh,

1469
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,140
trying to sell it.
Yeah.

1470
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,020
Kratom red.
Okay.

1471
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:25,950
Drug Abuse.
Kratom affects.

1472
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,110
Okay.
Narcan,

1473
00:59:27,111 --> 00:59:29,510
not,
I did not know narcan on is owned by

1474
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:32,140
scientology,
but I have a,

1475
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,220
my buddy Anthony Roberts,
he was like,

1476
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:35,420
uh,
when I was doing bigger,

1477
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:36,101
stronger,
faster,

1478
00:59:36,101 --> 00:59:39,170
it was like this dude that would always
hit me up online about stuff.

1479
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:42,500
And he kind of knew everything.
So I hired him to work on this movie as

1480
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:44,180
a,
as a researcher and a writer and he's

1481
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:46,490
been.
He's been teaching me a lot about how to

1482
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:47,510
find stuff,
you know,

1483
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:50,000
let's,
let's see what the Narcan on people have

1484
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:52,160
to say about it.
Effects of drugs.

1485
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:56,270
So it's [inaudible] dot org.
The effects of drug abuse.

1486
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:59,540
It says Kratom is a relatively new drug
to the US and Europe and has been used

1487
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:03,650
for many years in Southeast Asia as an
anti dye or real medicine.

1488
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,870
Hey,
doesn't really,

1489
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,890
you know,
I've heard that.

1490
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,850
Yeah.
A lot of people.

1491
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:11,210
So you get diarrhea,
you take Kratom a painkiller and a

1492
01:00:11,211 --> 01:00:14,900
recreational drug.
Kratom is the popular name for a tree

1493
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:18,890
and the drug comes from its leaves.
The drug may be bought in leaf form,

1494
01:00:18,891 --> 01:00:22,670
but in this country is more likely pur
purchased as a capsule with a powdered

1495
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:26,640
leaf material or chopped up in the form
of a leaf that can be used for a tea

1496
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,411
over smoking.
Yeah.

1497
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:30,470
This says t on it that people make
actual 10 make tea out of it.

1498
01:00:30,471 --> 01:00:33,380
Tastes like shit.
I think it tastes terrible.

1499
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:34,550
It's pretty,
um,

1500
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,200
pretty bitter.
You know,

1501
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:40,220
it says the effects of Kratom come on
rather quickly and last between five and

1502
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:42,800
seven hours,
although high doses can last longer.

1503
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:46,190
It's heavily promoted as illegal,
undetectable safe drug that can be used

1504
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:50,390
to come off stronger drugs.
It is not illegal the United States,

1505
01:00:50,391 --> 01:00:55,280
but the breakdown products of Kratom can
be detected in some drug tests.

1506
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:57,410
Is that true?
Like for people that work at ups or

1507
01:00:57,411 --> 01:00:59,600
something?
I haven't seen that happen now.

1508
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,010
I don't.
I don't think that's true.

1509
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:02,440
They might be scaring you.
Yeah,

1510
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:04,910
probably trying to get you to join.
I don't think it will show up on a drug

1511
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:05,810
test.
It's not an opiate.

1512
01:01:05,811 --> 01:01:07,690
It's not the same,
you know,

1513
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:11,240
same ingredients.
It says the breakdown products of Kratom

1514
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,030
can be detected with some drug dose.
Hmm.

1515
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:15,700
Maybe,
maybe some drug tests that are looking

1516
01:01:15,701 --> 01:01:16,030
at.
Well,

1517
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,960
there,
there is a specific drug test that looks

1518
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:19,260
for it,
you know,

1519
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:20,960
that goes,
that will go in and look,

1520
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:22,790
you know,
look forward just Kratom and that's what

1521
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:24,890
they,
that's what they use when somebody

1522
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:26,540
commits suicide or whatever it makes
like,

1523
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,380
oh,
is there,

1524
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:29,660
is there Kratom in their,
in their system or whatever,

1525
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,220
you know,
and there's 15 deaths from Kratom at 14

1526
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:37,700
to 15 deaths are all polypharmacy,
which means we've taken several

1527
01:01:37,701 --> 01:01:39,860
different things,
but most of the time it's like

1528
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,600
polypharmacy.

1529
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,211
It's like,
oh,

1530
01:01:41,211 --> 01:01:45,080
they were taking Xanax,
Vicodin and Kratom and you're like,

1531
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,140
why would you blame it on the Kratom it
seems like the least,

1532
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:48,850
the,
uh,

1533
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:50,150
you know,
agregious of all of them,

1534
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,910
if it's only in combination with other
pharmaceuticals,

1535
01:01:52,911 --> 01:01:54,640
that sounds crazy.
I mean,

1536
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:56,390
that's like marijuana,
like,

1537
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,980
you know,
it's like,

1538
01:01:57,981 --> 01:01:59,870
who knows,
who knows how many people have died on

1539
01:01:59,871 --> 01:02:04,190
marijuana and other drugs.
It's funny that you bring up Thailand

1540
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:06,800
because they're using Thailand as an
example here.

1541
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:11,980
More than 13,000 people were arrested
for Kratom related crimes in Thailand.

1542
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:14,100
That's just because it's illegal in
Thailand.

1543
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:16,610
The leader of the opiod industry,
they conveniently ignore that,

1544
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:21,910
so the drug is abused for it's abused
for its sedative or stimulating effects,

1545
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,630
not used.
It says abused.

1546
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,680
Will say.
The thing is I.

1547
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:28,830
I don't think that like taking a normal,
you know,

1548
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,960
I think if I took,
you know,

1549
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:33,270
50 pills a day,
that'll be abusing it.

1550
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:36,630
I maybe take six pills a day,
maybe at the most 10.

1551
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:40,770
Then you're even the term pill is a
weird word because what you did

1552
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:42,630
basically taking this powder plants.
Yeah.

1553
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,250
Well the,
the term drug is a weird word.

1554
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:47,730
If you went back and read that statement
that you just read and substituted the

1555
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:49,560
word plant,
it wouldn't sound bad at all.

1556
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:51,440
The plant comes as a powder.
The plant is this,

1557
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:53,400
the plant does that.
It wouldn't sound bad,

1558
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:56,760
but when you use the word drug of course
sit in a corner.

1559
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,440
Well,
drugs such a weird word because it

1560
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,250
covers too many different effects.
You know,

1561
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,250
covers stimulants,
depressants.

1562
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:07,140
So here's what it says,
a person using this drug may expect or

1563
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,440
may not expect or want the following
undesirable effects of Kratom edginess,

1564
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,610
nervousness,
vomiting can be severe,

1565
01:03:14,611 --> 01:03:16,590
prolonged nausea,
it can be severe,

1566
01:03:16,591 --> 01:03:18,600
prolonged sweating,
itching,

1567
01:03:18,601 --> 01:03:20,220
constipation,
delusions,

1568
01:03:20,221 --> 01:03:22,590
lithology,
respiratory depression,

1569
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:24,840
tremors,
aggressive or combative behavior,

1570
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:28,080
psychotic episodes,
hallucinations and paranoia.

1571
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:32,310
There's a big thing you just mentioned
that respiratory depression and has not

1572
01:03:32,311 --> 01:03:34,800
been shown with Kratom.
And that's,

1573
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:39,310
and that's what kills people with oxy.
What about hallucinations to people who

1574
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:42,300
say on them?
I've never met one psychotic episodes,

1575
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:45,030
never met one aggressive or combative
behavior.

1576
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,200
Um,
Nah,

1577
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:47,940
never,
never really experienced that.

1578
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:51,930
The only thing I can say that I have
experienced are like people that feel

1579
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:54,720
better and are in better moods.
Here's an interesting one.

1580
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:59,760
Addiction affects me include number one,
loss of sexual desire.

1581
01:03:59,761 --> 01:04:04,761
People like,
fuck this drug last actually prolong you

1582
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,230
during sex.
Oh Shit.

1583
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,170
Prolong you.
So like make it harder to finish

1584
01:04:10,171 --> 01:04:13,590
basically darkening of the skin or face.
What do you want to be black.

1585
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:16,890
That's why that's an effect.
That's negative effect.

1586
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:17,661
Well,
you know,

1587
01:04:17,661 --> 01:04:20,850
you know where that comes from.
Darkening of the face and the skin comes

1588
01:04:20,851 --> 01:04:22,290
from.
I'm in Thailand.

1589
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:27,270
When they did the study in 1975,
they were researching a migrant like the

1590
01:04:27,271 --> 01:04:28,950
workers,
the workers out in the fields.

1591
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:32,070
So the research these workers out in the
fields that were,

1592
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,500
that were true in the Kratom leaves St.
Oh,

1593
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:37,510
they're turning brown because they're
out in the fear on the fucking Sun.

1594
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:42,510
So like these people are turning brown.
Oh my God,

1595
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:45,450
that's so stupid.
And that's listed as a side effect.

1596
01:04:45,451 --> 01:04:46,590
Melanin.
Well,

1597
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,570
and then you'll,
then you'll have people like

1598
01:04:48,571 --> 01:04:51,510
congresspeople and,
and other people that are fighting

1599
01:04:51,511 --> 01:04:53,490
against this.
Try to use that as a fact.

1600
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,910
Here's where it gets really weird.
Withdrawal effects of them are very

1601
01:04:56,911 --> 01:05:01,911
similar to those of opiate,
like heroin or prescription painkillers.

1602
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,530
Let's hear those.
Here's the withdrawal effects.

1603
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,630
Diarrhea.
I thought it was anti-diarrhea.

1604
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:09,310
Make up your fucking mind.
Um,

1605
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:11,880
muscle pain.
I thought it's good for pain.

1606
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:12,480
Yeah,
that's great.

1607
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,350
Right?
Okay.

1608
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,630
Muscle tremors or,
or jerking.

1609
01:05:15,631 --> 01:05:17,010
You were saying the,
the,

1610
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:17,853
uh,
vet

1611
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:20,290
all his muscle jerking and twitching
goes away.

1612
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,210
They're seeing that.
That's a side effect.

1613
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:25,720
Riff,
restlessness and sleeplessness.

1614
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,510
Does it help you?
Uh,

1615
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:29,530
you know,
I haven't,

1616
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,090
no,
I haven't like really stayed up all

1617
01:05:31,091 --> 01:05:31,924
night on it,
but,

1618
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:33,400
you know,
I let you know,

1619
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:37,390
there's adverse effects to everything
that we could possibly ingest.

1620
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:41,800
So it's more like let's take a big group
of these adverse effects and see which

1621
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:43,990
ones occur more often,
you know,

1622
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,880
when people.
And it really,

1623
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:50,020
it really hasn't been shown across the
board to do all these things to

1624
01:05:50,021 --> 01:05:51,080
everybody,
you know.

1625
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:54,700
So like there was one guy that was on
Kratom for three years and they said

1626
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,550
he's got to be addicted to Kratom.
We're going to study him and we're going

1627
01:05:57,551 --> 01:05:59,970
to see what happens when we take them
off credit,

1628
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,910
you know,
when he gets off Kratom.

1629
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:03,700
So he gets off Kratom and you know,
what happened to him,

1630
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:05,440
what he had a runny nose.

1631
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,400
Whoa.
Asked Gary.

1632
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:08,980
That was the only.
The only,

1633
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:13,180
the only thing that he complained about
was like a runny nose here in large font

1634
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:18,210
it says narcan can help the person who
is addicted to Kratom in large words and

1635
01:06:21,461 --> 01:06:24,040
then it goes back.
Why have you drunk has different

1636
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:25,780
effects?
Oh Man.

1637
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:29,920
The route back to sobriety is much the
same from person to person.

1638
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:35,080
Recovery.
Recovery must include release relief

1639
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:39,100
from incessant cravings and you're the
beginnings of Rehab.

1640
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,050
You know,
you know what we said about,

1641
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:45,280
we were talking actually heard your
podcast and you brought me up on a,

1642
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:46,490
on another,
you know,

1643
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,490
on another one of your podcasts and we
were talking about time.

1644
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,220
The amount of time it takes to get sober
and I still,

1645
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,450
I still believe that,
right?

1646
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:55,860
I still believe like it takes time and I
still be short,

1647
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,850
but the thing that we have to talk about
is like,

1648
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,710
you don't just take this and get off of
opiates,

1649
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,520
you take this and you go to Aa meetings
and you go to,

1650
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:04,480
you know,
whatever,

1651
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,950
whatever works,
counseling,

1652
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:06,910
go to counseling.

1653
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:08,890
You go to a therapist and go talk to
them.

1654
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,010
You talk to them about why you couldn't
get off the drugs and you tell them

1655
01:07:12,011 --> 01:07:13,540
you've taken us and you say,
Hey,

1656
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:15,550
let's see if we can.
If we can solve this problem,

1657
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,170
you know,
but it's,

1658
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,570
let's not be stupid about it.
Like I went to the doctor and I got one

1659
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:22,660
when I,
when I was addicted to opiates and I

1660
01:07:22,661 --> 01:07:24,730
was,
I would drive around my car crying.

1661
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,860
I'd be crying saying,
I just want help,

1662
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,990
you know,
my brother was dying from this.

1663
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,670
I knew he was going to die from it.
I knew it.

1664
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,800
So I was driving around.
I would cry and be like,

1665
01:07:32,801 --> 01:07:33,850
I need,
I need rehab.

1666
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:34,810
I need help.
I don't know what to do.

1667
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:37,990
Every Rehab I called was like $4,000,
$6,000,

1668
01:07:37,991 --> 01:07:40,570
and I didn't have the money.
At the time I was a drug addict,

1669
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:41,380
you know,
I was broke.

1670
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,300
If I,
if I had known about something like this

1671
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,450
back then,
it would have completely changed the

1672
01:07:46,451 --> 01:07:48,190
person I am now.
I would have,

1673
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:50,700
I wouldn't have lost five or six years,
you know?

1674
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:53,350
Wow.
That's fucking crazy.

1675
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,380
It's just crazy.
It's so.

1676
01:07:56,470 --> 01:08:00,640
It's so weird when you're a grown adult
and all of a sudden you find out about

1677
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:02,440
something that's been around for
thousands of years.

1678
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:03,430
It's been helping people,
you know,

1679
01:08:03,431 --> 01:08:05,860
like I,
I try to pay attention to how the fuck

1680
01:08:05,861 --> 01:08:09,190
did this one for me being like the guy
who did bigger,

1681
01:08:09,191 --> 01:08:09,910
stronger,
faster,

1682
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:11,170
always talking about supplements,
everything.

1683
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,270
I missed it too.
Wow.

1684
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:14,201
You know,
I know.

1685
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:15,700
I know about every supplement on the
market.

1686
01:08:15,701 --> 01:08:16,400
I know everything

1687
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,280
on it makes every supplement that's out
there.

1688
01:08:19,281 --> 01:08:20,960
I look at them,
I want to see what they do,

1689
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:22,450
you know,
and um,

1690
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,110
you know,
I missed it.

1691
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,140
It's the,
that is really fascinating.

1692
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,970
It's just really,
really fascinating.

1693
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:34,240
So now we're in this state where the dea
held off it scheduled one distinction

1694
01:08:35,931 --> 01:08:37,580
right there.
We're going to designate it as a

1695
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:42,581
schedule one and the dea isn't,
I think this big monster and everybody

1696
01:08:43,851 --> 01:08:44,601
thinks everybody's like,
oh,

1697
01:08:44,601 --> 01:08:49,601
the dea and the dea.
I believe from what I've gathered from

1698
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:55,100
this whole situation is a data.
They're not happy about what happened.

1699
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:55,990
They,
they,

1700
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:59,000
they didn't know.
They weren't aware that this many people

1701
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,690
use Kratom and are happy about it.
I think that they really didn't know.

1702
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,900
I don't think it's like,
I don't think it's as dvs as people

1703
01:09:05,901 --> 01:09:07,340
think like,
I don't think it was a big,

1704
01:09:07,341 --> 01:09:07,890
you know,
and,

1705
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:11,120
and now it definitely could be something
that is pushed by big Pharma,

1706
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:15,590
but I feel like the way that the dea has
reacted so far has been,

1707
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,240
you know,
pretty normal.

1708
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:18,830
Pretty reasonable.
Yeah.

1709
01:09:18,831 --> 01:09:19,581
Reasonable.
Yeah.

1710
01:09:19,581 --> 01:09:20,330
Like,
it's been like,

1711
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:21,020
like,
Hey,

1712
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,100
okay,
I'm sorry,

1713
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:24,500
let's open up a website and take some
comments.

1714
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:27,380
Well,
I really hope people listen to this.

1715
01:09:27,381 --> 01:09:29,060
Get to it,
give it to give the address that one

1716
01:09:29,061 --> 01:09:32,480
more time.
It's credit kratom comments.org Kratom

1717
01:09:32,481 --> 01:09:37,481
Comments Dot Org,
k r a t o m comments.org.

1718
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:42,560
And so December first,
once December first rolls around,

1719
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:47,390
which is right around the corner,
what happens if they get a bunch of

1720
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,690
notes and I mean they have to get
10,000,

1721
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,740
is that what it.
Don't have to get any certain number,

1722
01:09:51,741 --> 01:09:54,740
but I think if they get $10,000,
like that's the number we were at.

1723
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,000
Everybody.
That's where you were aiming for,

1724
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:56,821
was aiming for,
you know,

1725
01:09:56,821 --> 01:09:57,930
like,
what's great is um,

1726
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,430
I've actually become friends,
a lot of people in this Kratom community

1727
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,540
and it's not the kind of people that you
would think like,

1728
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,120
you know,
I feel like,

1729
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:08,030
um,
when I went to the march in Washington

1730
01:10:08,031 --> 01:10:10,220
DC,
I didn't know what kind of people I was

1731
01:10:10,221 --> 01:10:11,130
going to meet,
you know,

1732
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:13,770
but I bet you know,
mothers and grandmothers and you know,

1733
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:16,220
like all these people that were like,
they were like my mom,

1734
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:17,930
you know,
and I wasn't expecting that.

1735
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,340
I was expecting to meet a bunch of
people.

1736
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:24,350
Like what's up dude?
And that Kinda that Kinda saying like,

1737
01:10:24,591 --> 01:10:26,000
yeah man,
the government sucks.

1738
01:10:26,001 --> 01:10:28,340
Let's keep this legal tower seven bro.
Look into it.

1739
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,170
It was,
it was vets,

1740
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:33,500
you know,
veterans that fought overseas for us and

1741
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:35,630
you know,
have risked a lot for us.

1742
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:40,631
It was a mothers and grandmothers and
people like that more than it was of

1743
01:10:40,851 --> 01:10:43,160
these,
a devious characters that they think are

1744
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:46,130
using Kratom wow.
So this is,

1745
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:48,110
this is a really important issue.
And when,

1746
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:49,760
when is your documentary going to come
out?

1747
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:52,400
We're hoping to documentary will come
out early next year.

1748
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:55,250
So just a matter of how fast we can get
it together.

1749
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,620
So we're almost done shooting.
Okay.

1750
01:10:57,621 --> 01:11:00,860
So now it's just the editing process.
And then also are you going to wait

1751
01:11:00,861 --> 01:11:03,170
around to see what happens after
December first?

1752
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:03,591
Yeah.
Yeah.

1753
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:04,341
We'll,
we'll wait around.

1754
01:11:04,341 --> 01:11:06,530
We're going to start editing.
We're starting editing right now.

1755
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,130
So basically,
you know,

1756
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,070
if things happen,
for example,

1757
01:11:10,071 --> 01:11:13,590
Bernie Sanders is one of the guys who
signed the Kratom letter.

1758
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,790
I want to talk to him,
I'd love to.

1759
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,590
He.
He's kind of an amazing guy to me.

1760
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:19,740
I would love to pick his brain about
this and see what he thinks.

1761
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:22,290
So it's impossible now these people
down,

1762
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:25,740
but you never know when you might get
five minutes with Bernie at a rally

1763
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:26,450
somewhere,
you know.

1764
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:28,960
So we're going to continue to try to get
those,

1765
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,870
those bigger names that we wanted to
get.

1766
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:33,420
I think they're important.
Orrin Hatch's involved in this.

1767
01:11:33,421 --> 01:11:37,410
Orrin Hatch is a senator from Utah
that's been very involved in the dietary

1768
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:39,060
supplements for a long,
long time.

1769
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,200
So,
uh,

1770
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,970
we,
we'd like to get his opinion on it and

1771
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,020
you know,
but like,

1772
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:43,920
it's kind of crazy.

1773
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:48,580
I would hope that the dea and the FDA
would listen to this interview and like

1774
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:50,210
sit with us and do an interview.
I got one.

1775
01:11:50,211 --> 01:11:51,310
Yeah.
I would love to like,

1776
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:54,220
just let them speak their mind.
I don't do interviews where I go in,

1777
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,500
in an ambush.
People,

1778
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:57,540
I let them speak their mind.
No,

1779
01:11:57,541 --> 01:11:58,600
you don't at all.
Um,

1780
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,870
I,
I think I took it probably an hour ago,

1781
01:12:00,871 --> 01:12:02,280
right?
How long?

1782
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:07,020
I take it 15 minutes into the show.
It's A.

1783
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,580
Yeah,
I mean,

1784
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I guess I'd have like a mild,
very mild stimulant sort of effect that

1785
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,440
I feel.
But uh,

1786
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:17,580
it's,
it's,

1787
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:21,240
it's nothing,
nothing to be concerned with.

1788
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,540
You're not dying know it doesn't me.
You know what I mean?

1789
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,540
It doesn't really like I've taken some
stuff before I,

1790
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:30,570
I was in Colorado this weekend and I
took a lot of edibles.

1791
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,790
Whoa.
Who?

1792
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:34,680
Those fucking people aren't screwing
around,

1793
01:12:34,681 --> 01:12:36,340
man.
They're going deep in Colorado.

1794
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:37,830
Man.
I heard you are a special.

1795
01:12:37,831 --> 01:12:39,120
Talking about edibles.
That was amazing.

1796
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:41,970
So was pretty sensitive to them too,
right?

1797
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:43,560
I guess.
I Dunno man.

1798
01:12:43,561 --> 01:12:46,860
I'm more sensitive than Joey Diaz.
Joey Diaz that like,

1799
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:48,810
I'm on that level.
Like 300 milligrams.

1800
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,673
Yeah.
That's cool.

1801
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:50,543
That's what you take.
Oh,

1802
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:52,290
I,
I don't even do it because they just

1803
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:53,550
have.
I'd have to take too much of it.

1804
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:55,860
Well,
one time I did a podcast with Sam Harris

1805
01:12:55,861 --> 01:13:00,420
recently and I have this spray that is a
thousand milligrams,

1806
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:03,210
like I guess it's a thousand milligrams
and the whole bottle,

1807
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:04,790
but it's like,
I don't know.

1808
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,940
I don't know exactly how to spray.
This is the more mild version.

1809
01:13:08,941 --> 01:13:13,941
This one's 175 milligrams,
which think it's like 20 milligrams of

1810
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:18,270
pump or 10 milligram between 10 and 20
milligrams of pumped depending on how

1811
01:13:18,271 --> 01:13:19,680
strong the stuff that makes sense.

1812
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:23,850
This is jumbo.
Jumbo makes a bunch of great stuff.

1813
01:13:23,851 --> 01:13:27,690
All organic.
They used to get data dispensary.

1814
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:30,100
I'll hook you up.
But the uh,

1815
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:32,670
hey you want me to do is take this one
the spray.

1816
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,230
Enjoy.
Don't get crazy.

1817
01:13:34,231 --> 01:13:35,700
You know what's weird?
I don't know,

1818
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,770
I don't like to smoke pot.
I like,

1819
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:41,160
I like this stuff better because I'm
just so used to taking things like that.

1820
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:43,680
So.
And I also feel like I don't want to get

1821
01:13:43,681 --> 01:13:46,050
back into the hole.
My girlfriend would flip out if I

1822
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:49,590
started smoking pot,
but to use some like edible stuff and

1823
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,470
play around with this and see if it
works for pain and stuff like that to me

1824
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:54,470
is something that's very,
very viable.

1825
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:55,261
Yeah.
Isn't that funny?

1826
01:13:55,261 --> 01:13:57,330
Where people worry about like smoking is
like,

1827
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,680
oh,
he's smoking drugs,

1828
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,830
but if you're spraying breath spray
under your tongue,

1829
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:02,880
it's like,
Eh,

1830
01:14:02,881 --> 01:14:04,230
he's just relieving pain,
you know,

1831
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:07,470
I just think we need to open our minds
to a lot of these substances that are

1832
01:14:07,471 --> 01:14:08,730
out there that can help us,
you know,

1833
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:12,440
it's great to say don't take anything
that's not the world that we live in

1834
01:14:12,441 --> 01:14:12,670
now.

1835
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:14,260
Right?
Well CBDS,

1836
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:17,170
CBDS are great because they're not
psychoactive at all.

1837
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,940
And uh,
I.

1838
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:21,180
Shannon Briggs was just in earlier so
that it's helped him tremendously.

1839
01:14:21,181 --> 01:14:23,570
CBD.
That's pot that'll know that fucked up,

1840
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:27,080
so you carry care,
but you know,

1841
01:14:27,081 --> 01:14:29,050
the,
the difference being the editable

1842
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:32,260
version of marijuana has a very
different psychoactive effect too.

1843
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:34,210
That's why a lot of people think they're
getting spiked.

1844
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:36,760
Like they'll eat a pot cookie and
they'll think,

1845
01:14:36,761 --> 01:14:39,040
oh my god,
somebody put an acid in this because

1846
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:43,000
it's really psychedelic and the way it's
processed by the body,

1847
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:48,270
your liver produces this metabolite
called 11 hydroxy metabolite and it's

1848
01:14:48,611 --> 01:14:52,380
just way more powerful than thc.
You the only comedian that I've seen

1849
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:55,210
bring science into that fall into that
pit.

1850
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:57,350
That was amazing.
You know,

1851
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:01,600
just to kiss your ass a little bit.
That entire special is at the top of the

1852
01:15:01,601 --> 01:15:02,080
game.

1853
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,110
Oh,
thanks bill.

1854
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,220
Thanks.
I'm hustling.

1855
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:07,330
That's great.
So,

1856
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:08,230
uh,
I wanted to get you.

1857
01:15:08,231 --> 01:15:10,420
I don't have a whole lot of time,
so I wanted to get you in here today and

1858
01:15:10,421 --> 01:15:11,650
get it done.
But um,

1859
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:13,020
what else?
Um,

1860
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:15,310
can you tell people about this and what
else can be done?

1861
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:19,000
I think that people need to go to Kratom
comments that org leave a comment,

1862
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:19,900
uh,
people can,

1863
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:21,970
you know,
they can call the dea,

1864
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:24,610
they can ask for Melvin Patterson,
he's the spokesman.

1865
01:15:24,611 --> 01:15:27,670
They can leave a message with him.
I think this Kratom comments.org though

1866
01:15:27,671 --> 01:15:31,330
is going to be the most effective and
also like people need to seek it out and

1867
01:15:31,331 --> 01:15:33,880
people can hit me up on facebook or
instagram.

1868
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:35,800
I'm,
I'm pretty readily available so if

1869
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:37,670
people have questions and want to,
you know,

1870
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,270
hit me up then just hit me up.
I mean I'm a big,

1871
01:15:40,271 --> 01:15:43,130
strong,
fast on social media and I will answer

1872
01:15:43,131 --> 01:15:44,260
your questions as much as I can.

1873
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:45,850
Like I'm not,
I don't hide from people,

1874
01:15:45,851 --> 01:15:46,900
you know.
No you don't.

1875
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:50,530
And when the documentaries out,
can you come back in and I'll watch it

1876
01:15:50,531 --> 01:15:53,350
and we'll talk about it and will and
hopefully we'll have some good news

1877
01:15:53,351 --> 01:15:54,070
about it.
And.

1878
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:54,761
All right folks,
I'm.

1879
01:15:54,761 --> 01:15:56,440
Hi,
I'm Kratom right now and it doesn't do

1880
01:15:56,441 --> 01:15:57,880
anything.
My brother wants to get back in here

1881
01:15:57,881 --> 01:15:58,630
with you too.
Okay.

1882
01:15:58,630 --> 01:15:59,321
I love that.
Smelly.

1883
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:00,880
Yeah.
Can I mentioned something about him?

1884
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:01,540
Yeah,
for sure.

1885
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:04,870
He's got a big sale going on for a the
black Friday.

1886
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:08,470
If you enter the Code Rogan,
it's 20 percent opposite for his

1887
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:09,790
slingshot.
How much you bench?

1888
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:13,240
Dot Net is his website for slingshot
slingshot products.

1889
01:16:13,241 --> 01:16:14,200
I had to plug them.
Okay,

1890
01:16:14,201 --> 01:16:16,090
beautiful.
Will shout out to mark.

1891
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,460
All right,
well thank you Chris.

1892
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:18,610
Really,
really appreciate it.

1893
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,920
And do you have a name for this
documentary right now?

1894
01:16:20,921 --> 01:16:23,650
We're calling it a leaf of faith,
a leap of faith.

1895
01:16:23,651 --> 01:16:24,880
I like it.
I like it.

1896
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:28,280
So if you have a new name,
we'll have to go like that.

1897
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:29,860
I think I did that name.
It's cool.

1898
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:32,320
Let's go with a leaf of faith.
Beautiful.

1899
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:34,000
Thanks Chris.
Why are you so much?

1900
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:34,750
I appreciate it.
