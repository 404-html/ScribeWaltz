1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,150
Three
why Cheeto Santee.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,210
Know why that,
I'll tell you.

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:11,480
When I first moved to Los Angeles,
um,

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,890
I was playing this basketball league
with these kids from east La.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,930
There was like the only connection I had
in la with,

6
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:18,970
he's like a couple of kids that I knew
from Long Beach and uh,

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,170
we would go play ball on this league and
then afterwards we'd go to a bar and

8
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:25,290
just get shit faced,
like just blacked out out of our mind.

9
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,510
22,
like every dime we had was going to

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,440
booze and partying.
So we were partying and I'm wearing

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,270
basketball shorts like white people do
when you play basketball.

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,800
And all my Mexican friends,
you know,

13
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,660
they were like,
whatever they had on the floor that

14
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,450
morning,
it was like jeans and you know what?

15
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,260
There was no never basketball shoes for
them.

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,400
And we're sitting there drinking and
this Dude Paavo his buddy of mine,

17
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:46,460
he looks down at my legs and he goes,
dog,

18
00:00:46,461 --> 00:00:48,300
I got to fucking seo question player
like,

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,000
did you have fucking orange leg hairs
dog?

20
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:52,711
I was like,
Dude,

21
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:54,570
I've known you for years.
You've never seen that.

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,501
He's like,
no,

23
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:59,220
dog is so gross dog.
He's nasty to look at row.

24
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,610
It's kind of like if you ate a bag of
cheetos and you'll wipe the finger dust

25
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:04,680
all over your fucking legs.
And she got cheeto legs.

26
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,100
So the she don't think so.
Then all these dudes,

27
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,710
all these fucking,
all these homies were always like Chito.

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,260
It was just,
it just stuck so hard that when I got

29
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:14,310
twitter and Instagram,
I was like,

30
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,970
I have to have Cido as my shit.
Like I have to embrace the chain.

31
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,950
Crazy.
They embrace the cheeto man.

32
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,450
Wow.
Yeah.

33
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,470
That's a good time for orange haired
Comedians to the greatest of all time

34
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:26,610
have orange hair.
It's,

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,460
it's wild because,
uh,

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,840
I've always been such a massive fan of
bur.

37
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,980
I mean,
I can't preach them enough.

38
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:32,940
I think I,
I think I do it.

39
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,880
I did ride them so hard.
I think many people I talk to her like,

40
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:36,600
all right,
do it enough.

41
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,650
Like I get it.
You like him.

42
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:38,881
But I do,
man.

43
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:41,360
I,
I've always loved him and Louise changed

44
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:43,900
the game in a totally different way.
Um,

45
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,140
they're both those two days of all time.
Shocking bur right

46
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,220
now is he's doing something real special
and he's also a man's man and

47
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:56,850
unapologetic man who,
thank God there's so few.

48
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,330
Yeah.
It's such a hard time to be

49
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,171
guy.
Yeah.

50
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:01,840
You're not allowed to.
And shame on you say that.

51
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,720
If you say that people like booth and
Ooh,

52
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:07,210
it's so hard to be a man with all your
male privilege.

53
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,830
Oh,
cisgendered males complaining.

54
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,510
But how hard it is,
I was being judged folks from all judged

55
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,780
harshly white,
straight male and the literal enemy,

56
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:19,750
public enemy number one.
Right now I walk around,

57
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,360
you are the enemy.
You're automatically a rapist and a

58
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:26,080
massage therapist and an ego.
Maniacal money,

59
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:27,040
hungry,
driven,

60
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,290
bad human being.
It's so fucked up.

61
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,770
This is how ridiculous it's gotten.
There was an article,

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,450
oh,
they're still complaining about being a

63
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:36,330
man.
He was an article that I just read that

64
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:40,770
was advocating that women should never
go to prison.

65
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,310
It was like,
let's stop putting women in prison.

66
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,900
Yeah.
See if he could find that would fund.

67
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,700
It was,
the idea was that women are suppressed

68
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,320
and they already represents such a
significantly small portion of the u s

69
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:57,850
population that really needs no for

70
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,010
heinous crimes,
don't then they don't deserve

71
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,640
the same punishment as other people that
have heinous crimes.

72
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,470
The number of women hit men would just
go through the fucking roof.

73
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:06,304
Right?
My God,

74
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,940
if they couldn't be arrested.
Yeah.

75
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,290
Oh my God.
So much.

76
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,740
So much domestic.
Well that's like saying,

77
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:12,490
okay,
so if you're saying,

78
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,990
if that's what that,
if that's the article is trying to say

79
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:16,690
then then say any other repress group in
society,

80
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,700
then then minorities can't go to prison
anymore.

81
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,870
That's the same logic day represent a
much larger percentage though.

82
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:26,320
So the thing there she saying about
women is there so few women in prison

83
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:30,220
already and women are like a lot of
their behaviors due to the fact they've

84
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:33,040
been suppressed by men.
Okay,

85
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,390
sure.
Oh my gosh.

86
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,900
Well it's just the idea of us being on
two teams is so crazy.

87
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,780
The penis team and the vagina team,
it's that simple.

88
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,520
Shirts and skins,
it's that simple,

89
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,650
right?
You're all,

90
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,950
all people on your side are good.
All people in our side of the bed.

91
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:48,310
Do you know how fucking crazy that is
insane that,

92
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,610
well that's what I said like um,
not to sound like I'm plugging my

93
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:52,900
special,
but in my special,

94
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,980
I talk about,
I was shot in Chicago where I'm from and

95
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,860
at the time there was a lot going on in
Chicago as there always is a lot of cop

96
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:04,330
shootings and I think there's a big,
there's an immediate uproar of like fuck

97
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:06,670
cops.
And I hate that because I've cops in my

98
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:10,360
family and you can't just blanket
statement an entire thing.

99
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,840
Just like you can't blanket an entire
race of people,

100
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:15,880
sex class of people and say you're all
the same.

101
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,640
That's the same thing as saying like
every cop is a bad person.

102
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,180
Like are you out of your fucking mind?
Green was millions of police officers

103
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,090
that are great people.
You happen to hear stories about bad

104
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:27,010
humans that happens in any industry,
right.

105
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,490
And honestly,
if you look at it statistically like the

106
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:32,650
number of bad cops versus the number of
cops,

107
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:35,920
and then you have to break down the
number of interactions cops have with

108
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:37,780
people,
it's stunning.

109
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,910
Have you been,
have you met people?

110
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,900
They're awful.
People are fucking awful.

111
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:44,530
Can you imagine every day who,
but imagine how awful they are.

112
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:48,370
If you are a professional enemy,
they know that you're just a person just

113
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,870
like them.
So you're pulling this guy over,

114
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:52,870
this guy's done a crime,
you know he's going to lie to you and

115
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,330
you're the enemy and you don't even know
this fucking guy.

116
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,610
You don't even know him.
You don't even have a real beef with

117
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:57,820
them.

118
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,450
But now his whole life is on the line
right now in this altercation.

119
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,860
You never know if he's going to shoot
you.

120
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,210
You never,
you never know.

121
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:06,220
There's so many videos online there,
the most,

122
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,770
one of the most terrifying videos of
this cop,

123
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:11,710
Poland,
this guy over and the guy was some

124
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,950
Vietnam veteran who is a a real fucking
killer.

125
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,690
And he wind up killing the cop and they
show him killing the cop on the security

126
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:22,150
camera.
The guy's trying to give this guy all

127
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:23,350
the,
all the room in the world like,

128
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:24,700
sir,
please get back in your car,

129
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,290
sir,
please get back at star,

130
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,030
Sir.
Put your hands down sir,

131
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,620
sir,
put the gun down sir.

132
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,040
And then it gets to the,
I mean he's,

133
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:35,980
he's trying so hard not to be at con and
this guy shoots him and kills him and

134
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:38,320
you're telling me that other cops
haven't seen that video.

135
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,020
You don't think that they're terrified
that they're going to be the next guy

136
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:44,800
that's on some fucking youtube clip that
to comics are talking about on a podcast

137
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,890
because it could happen easy.
Every time you pull the guy over,

138
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:52,780
your life's on the line and the stress
of that is ungodly and we expect them to

139
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:55,930
manage it like robots.
We expect them to be like no person

140
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:56,870
we've ever met,
right.

141
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,430
Where just no problem.
No stress.

142
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,420
If you're a fucking accountant,
what is the worst shit that can happen

143
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:07,040
to you once you're in the office?
Printer breaks almost nothing is life

144
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:07,874
threatening.
No,

145
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,330
Microsoft Excel crashed this morning.
Everyone's going crazy in fucking

146
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:13,280
accounting,
beat cop,

147
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,920
Jesus Christ.
It's the same way with,

148
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:16,700
uh,
you know,

149
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,740
I know this is,
this is all this has been said,

150
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,200
but the way we treat veterans and shit,
it's like,

151
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,240
you know,
I grew up with a kid who was a really

152
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:23,780
close friend of mine.

153
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,040
They killed himself a couple of years
ago.

154
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,880
It was a veteran,
and I think the expectation of the

155
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:33,881
return to normalcy is not only it
ridiculous and insane request,

156
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,260
but it's just so illogical that that's
a,

157
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:38,510
that's not approach.
It's like,

158
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,160
dude,
these people can't come back from any

159
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:43,760
sort of combat and,
and just be pushed back into the real

160
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:44,151
world.
Like,

161
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:44,631
well,
you're good.

162
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:45,320
Right?
You're good.

163
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,790
Did we,
did you turn off the switch when you

164
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,750
landed back in the United States?
Yeah.

165
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,860
And it was just a little toggle in my
head and then I'm good now I should go

166
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,990
get a regular job.
I guess John,

167
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:58,730
the just the lack of responsibility that
we have for like taking care of those

168
00:06:58,731 --> 00:06:59,690
people.
It's crazy.

169
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,720
The lack of a emphasis on psychological
recovery on a giving them coping skills,

170
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,741
mental health,
man,

171
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:08,090
that's a biggest issue in the United
States.

172
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,520
I say that all the time.
It's like there's so much lack of help

173
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:14,240
for mental health dude.
You see it so constantly in so many

174
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:16,460
different facets now.
I think it's coming out more because of

175
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:19,370
the Internet because you see,
you know,

176
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,140
violent crimes and,
and,

177
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,990
and you see where mental health has kind
of led our country now.

178
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,320
There should be a bigger focus on it.
Did I had a psychiatrist in the podcast

179
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,880
yesterday,
Kelly Brogan who uh,

180
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,840
she wrote a book called,
what is it called?

181
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:34,070
The mind of your own mind,
of your own is the name of rubella.

182
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,330
We talked all about these psychiatric
drugs and when they prescribed them and

183
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:41,300
why they prescribed and what are the
side effects and how easily they

184
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:42,134
prescribed them.
Right.

185
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,850
And how so many of these same exact
symptoms can be cured by exercise and

186
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:48,560
diet and they don't even advocate that.

187
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,460
And she's talking about like how
incredible it is like her coming from a

188
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:56,900
background of psychiatry being an md,
going through the whole training thing,

189
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,420
writing a book about it and you realize
like Oh my God,

190
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,100
they're just doping people up.
Yup.

191
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,290
Cause it's easy fix man.
They want short term,

192
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,490
short term solution as fast as you can
working out and exercise sounds like

193
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:10,070
such a,
it sounds like a marathon and they just,

194
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:11,960
they're like give me the theme of the 40
Yard Dash.

195
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,270
Like what can we do to get them in the
40 yard dash and they're like here,

196
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:16,580
take this pill and that that changes
everything.

197
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:21,560
Just the disassociative quality of these
pills are so dangerous and we just hand

198
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:23,190
them out.
Not we obviously you and I aren't

199
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:24,880
involved,
but someone's not as far as their

200
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:25,910
audience knows.
We don't do it.

201
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,290
Imagine if you're a guy right now,
work at first pharmaceutical company and

202
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,490
every day you read the news,
you see some fucking mass killing.

203
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,190
Please don't let it be on our shit.
Please don't let them be Pfizer every

204
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,020
day.
It's like rolling the dice online.

205
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,570
Hope hoping.
It wasn't some guy on one of their

206
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,000
drugs,
she was talking about how the numbers of

207
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,850
people that commit these mass killings
that are on drugs,

208
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,190
they're on psych,
psychoactive,

209
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,170
some sort of cycle,
pharmaceutical drugs.

210
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,310
She's like,
it's crazy.

211
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:54,380
It's like a hundred percent yeah.
Well let me get,

212
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,590
let me get,
let me give you something.

213
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:56,430
This is how powerful

214
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,470
that world is.
I probably shouldn't say this,

215
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,300
but I'm with you,
so I don't really give a shit,

216
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,890
but on the only one thing I wasn't
allowed to talk about,

217
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,090
we're not talking about,
but specifically say on my showtime

218
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,840
special was about accutane.
I want an accutane when I was a kid.

219
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:11,910
Do you know this drug?
Do you know what?

220
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,040
Like you said,
sit dry.

221
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:13,874
Yeah,
it is,

222
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,070
but it's unbelievably unstable.
Okay.

223
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:20,760
It's caused a lot of suicide.
People got real fucked up from it.

224
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,850
So it caused a lot of chemical and
mental reaction that they didn't

225
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:25,350
anticipate for youth.
Youthful,

226
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,820
you know,
kids under 18 with underdeveloped

227
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:29,880
brains,
you used to have sign a form to say I

228
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:32,340
can die from this medication.
There's a risk of death.

229
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,560
That was a real thing for pimple
medication.

230
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,470
But on the special showtimes lawyers
called us and said,

231
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,830
I can mention the company,
but I can't say the joke.

232
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,270
Uh,
I said,

233
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,300
if you don't know what accutane was,
it was developed in the eighties and the

234
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,000
nineties to kill acne.
And then people and they,

235
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,260
they were like,
we can't say that.

236
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,420
I was like,
why can't I say that's a,

237
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,970
that's a fact.
And the guys,

238
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,010
you know,
lawyers were like,

239
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,700
there are massive sponsor,
Jesus Christ.

240
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,290
That was the crooked,
that was the control.

241
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,950
They were like the first of our
thoughts.

242
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,460
Showtime didn't have any sponsors.
CBS,

243
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,150
CBS is their mothership.
It's Viacom.

244
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:07,620
Right.
That's also a spite thing.

245
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,330
Yeah.
That was the only thing that they were

246
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:11,550
like,
we just can't say that,

247
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,260
which has a respectively removed.
Cause I was like,

248
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:14,940
I didn't need that piece anyway.
But I was like,

249
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:18,600
that's so weird that they are that
meticulous about this one small thing

250
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,450
because they wanted to cover up the fact
that people,

251
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,520
people used to die from it.

252
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,840
People want it.
Kids who are,

253
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,360
who are the most insecure point of your
life.

254
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,170
You've got shit all over your face and
you just want to fix it with a pill.

255
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:32,550
Cause you want to feel better about your
life.

256
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:37,551
You're already so vulnerable and ugly
and weird and they're willing to risk

257
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:39,930
their life for it.
But this company won't recognize that

258
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,270
that was a thing.
What,

259
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,990
what numbers of people died off?
I mean there was at one point I,

260
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,320
I remember when I was in high school,
there was like three kids.

261
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,600
It,
it made national news cause there's like

262
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:52,350
three kids in a row committed suicide.
It was a consecutive like three young

263
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,000
kids,
puppet boom that committed suicide.

264
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,150
And of course you can't just attribute
it to one thing.

265
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,220
I'm not saying you can point a finger
and say that's what it was,

266
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,200
but there's enough evidence surrounding
things like that that made the company

267
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,650
put more legal action behind,
uh,

268
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,930
release forms from when you take the
drug.

269
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,270
Uh,
nowadays I think it's,

270
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,030
I think there's different levels of it
you can't give to people under,

271
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,180
under 16 or a certain age because of the
strength of the medication.

272
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,380
Jesus.
Yeah.

273
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,870
Because all I wanted to do was not be
ugly anymore.

274
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:24,000
So what did it do to you?
You know what's funny,

275
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:26,880
man?
It cleared my skin up and I never had to

276
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:28,890
take it over again.
I know people that did it two or three

277
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:31,180
times and uh,
it,

278
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,600
it gave me a lot of joy because I felt
fine again.

279
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,520
I had,
so I had such bad acne.

280
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,000
I say I had such bad acne when I was a
kid that it made me not believe in God.

281
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,840
I was like,
nope,

282
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,200
nothing exists.
I'm alone on this earth.

283
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,720
And I was,
I felt like I was the ugliest person to

284
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:47,760
ever walk the planet because you felt
so.

285
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,820
So this thing [inaudible] it fixed me so
to speak.

286
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:52,350
It made me feel like everything was good
again,

287
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,040
which is gross.
But that's how

288
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,370
like shallow we are kids.
Cause you're just like so vulnerable

289
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:58,450
around your peers.
You're like,

290
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,270
I just want to be,
I just want to be normal.

291
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,480
When you're like 16 years old,
if you have a horrible acne attack,

292
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,460
it fucks your head.
It fucks you up.

293
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,470
You feel so weak.
Yeah.

294
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,690
He's like,
you're so at the mercy of this.

295
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:12,190
I mean obviously,
Ooh,

296
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,720
poor white,
cisgendered man worried about Zika.

297
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,480
Now you know what?
I understand there's worse problems.

298
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,460
Look at that.
That is this.

299
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,740
This is a list of the side effects of
this nice carriages,

300

00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:29,920

excessive bone growth,

00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,850
sight loss.
You can just lose your vision.

309
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,740
Well then you know,
you lose your vision.

310
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,080
You can't see your acne anymore.
So I guess that's kind of the caviar

311
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,970
list of birth defects.
Scroll back down again.

312
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:56,740
Please look at this part where it says
the list of birth defects.

313
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:57,341
No.
Up Up,

314
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,950
a little up,
a little up a little.

315
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,700
There you go.
Genetic name,

316
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,410
facial and nerve system deformities.
Mental retardations patients must be on

317
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:10,870
birth control when using it.
Yup.

318
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,050
Cause you get miscarriages.
Are you out of your fucking mind?

319
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,530
Net crazy patients must be on birth
control.

320
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,440
If you want to use this medication,
she can't get pregnant.

321
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,750
Your baby will come out of Mutant at
Jersey.

322
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:25,370
Man With 25 million verdict after you
alleged that Roche Acne drug gang,

323
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,920
Dan came,
inflammatory bowel disorder that

324
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:30,770
required the removal of his colon.
He had to rip out his fucking Kollel.

325
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,880
My God,
Jesus Christ,

326
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,280
you only get 25 million if they take out
your colon.

327
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,120
That's it dude.
You lose your,

328
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:42,121
but you get 25 one payday from the rock.
Like one of his big movies.

329
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:44,590
Maybe they take your colon,
he might get more than that.

330
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,490
It might get more than that for like
Baywatch and to,

331
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:49,270
they write in the,
in the memo of the check for colon,

332
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,240
fuck for colon,
for anus.

333
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,500
So,
um,

334
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,110
I worked at a hamburger place,
a place called Newport creamery when I

335
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:00,640
was in high school.
And uh,

336
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:03,880
I got graduated from dishwasher to work
in at the grill.

337
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,640
That's a big deal.
It was a big deal with the problem was

338
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:09,850
working at the grill.
You get fucking crazy zits dude.

339
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,250
Oh yes.
This is grease in your face all day.

340
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,250
Like literally you get out of there,
your face is covered in grease.

341
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,180
What will hold were you 15?
I guess I was 16 when I started working

342
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:19,330
there.

343
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,030
15 or 16,
some of my first job was McDonald's.

344
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,750
So of course I was really aiding in the
shit face of my life.

345
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,760
I was like,
let me eat shit food.

346
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,490
Uh,
be around Greece all day,

347
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,750
all day,
all day.

348
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:33,940
Last Friday.
Leaders like that shit's in the air.

349
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,730
What's gross?
Like you have a thin film of it on your

350
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:38,280
face coded.
Yeah.

351
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,470
And My zits got out of control and I
remember when there was this girl's

352
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:45,280
really cute girl that worked there and
she grabbed my face once.

353
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,230
Like she just has been nice to me.
She goes,

354
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:49,780
you're so cute.
She grabbed my face and all I could

355
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:50,770
think of was,
oh my God,

356
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:53,930
she just touched my zits.
I'm so disgusting.

357
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:56,060
I think about it to this day.
It's crazy.

358
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,430
It's crazy.
It sticks with you dude.

359
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,710
Dude was so devastating at the time.
I just like,

360
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,540
I'm like,
cause I was attracted to her.

361
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,430
She's very cupid.
I always felt like she was out of my

362
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:06,920
league and then she's all of a sudden
she's touching my face.

363
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:11,921
I'm like God Zits,
I remember we were going to like a a a

364
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:16,760
family function of some kind and I had
obviously just picked at something on my

365
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:20,270
stupid face and my little bread sister
was like,

366
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,560
you're bleeding.
Oh,

367
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:23,750
it was like out of my face.
I was like,

368
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:26,750
I'm a mutant.
You feel like you're like blanket me and

369
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:29,120
hide me in the back of the car.
The only thing what,

370
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,830
what changed it for me was exercise.
Yeah.

371
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,110
Yeah.
Once I started,

372
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:35,780
um,
I started like really heavily working

373
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:38,860
out,
it kind of went away like towards like

374
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:42,410
17 and 18 by the time I was 18 and it
stopped.

375
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,210
But man for for that 15 and 16 it was
bad.

376
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:49,070
Well I played sports all through high
school so that was an issue cause it was

377
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:51,710
always sweating and it was making him to
exacerbate it made it worse.

378
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,060
And then in college all I did was work
out and didn't play a lot active sports.

379
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,980
So,
but that time it was all cleared up and

380
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:59,600
I was fine.
But in high school was just like,

381
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:02,570
I did everything to make it worse.
Like everything possible.

382
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,360
Everybody would get a sunburn to kill
their zits.

383
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,150
Remember that we'll look at me.
I can sit in the sun.

384
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,520
I just would get,
I would get cancer and get worse skin.

385
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,090
That's like in the summertime,
I remember that was like,

386
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,750
Oh,
like,

387
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,340
oh boy,
it's going to be sunny out.

388
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,200
This is great.
I can cook off some of these.

389
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,790
Get a sign off these zits.
Yeah man.

390
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,530
I had a buddy of mine growing up.
I mean I cannot complain because my

391
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:28,311
buddy,
um,

392
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:32,140
had it real bad.
He was one of those guys that was like,

393
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,860
he's his,
everything.

394
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:38,270
His neck was covered in pock marks.
His face was covering apart Mars and the

395
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:40,610
poor kid was like barely hanging on.
Right.

396
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,490
He's like 1516 years old,
you know,

397
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:46,280
it wasn't like genetically gifted to
begin with and then all of a sudden he

398
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:50,270
gets hit with this hail storm on his
face.

399
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,320
I mean,
his whole,

400
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,410
all of his skin was just fucked and
there's nothing they can do about it.

401
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:55,790
And once that happens,
no,

402
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,670
unless you want to lose your colon,
if you want to take a pill than even

403
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:00,440
that,
it doesn't smooth your face out.

404
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,041
No,
no,

405
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,330
no.
They can smooth your face.

406
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:04,040
I,
once you have those scars all over the

407
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,020
places,
they have to fucking sandblast you

408
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,160
surgery.
Yeah.

409
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:09,430
It's crazy and it doesn't look good.
No,

410
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,030
no.
You can tell it's fucked.

411
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:11,391
I,
yeah,

412
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:13,610
no,
I feel like I'm lucky that that I that

413
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:15,770
had worked because I had friends who
worked in work and it was like,

414
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:18,710
Oh God,
that's just if you were my friend who

415
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:22,550
just got hit with the hail storm,
like you would think like maybe for that

416
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:24,710
guy be worth taking a chance at suicide.
Yeah.

417
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,544
Why not?

418
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,031
If you're going to do it,
do it.

419
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:29,541
Cool.
You know,

420
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,770
you never know.
You never know,

421
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:31,900
right?
You just rolling the dice.

422
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:34,070
You might be that one or that one out of
a thousand people.

423
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:37,190
That goes completely fucking insane.
Once that stuff hits your system,

424
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,810
it goes blind.
Insane.

425
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,020
Shit's yourself.
Sculpt pressure was the craziest thing.

426
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,230
Bone growth.
Weird bones are going to start to grow

427
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,350
horns.
You see Mike's Second Chin.

428
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:50,190
You just have another chin start

429
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,460
to grow below.
You ever.

430
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:53,150
We'll go to this lady.
Um,

431
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,410
uh,
Dr Pimple popper on instagram.

432
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,330
No pop zits dictated to this lady's
instagram page.

433
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,670
The point where it almost seems like
she's sponsoring this show.

434
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,920
Tell everybody about her.
You go to her page and every day she's

435
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,010
cutting open cysts,
popping zits.

436
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,080
And there's,
you can,

437
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,560
she's got millions of look at,
she's got 2.4 million.

438
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,390
Okay.
2.4 million humans watch this all the

439
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,211
time.
Constantly.

440
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:22,380
Dude,
I watch it.

441
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,960
But uh,
all of her stuff is um,

442
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,970
these giant Zit go to that will lower
right hand corner one

443
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,610
click on that.
This,

444
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:36,710
she's just cutting open these cysts and
it's so oddly addictive man.

445
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,960
When you,
she's got like this little circular

446
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:43,950
razor blade tool.
It takes a chunk of meat out of your

447
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:47,820
neck so that she can now push all the
boss.

448
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:48,923
God.

449
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,140
Isn't this insane like people's bodies
and these errors,

450
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,770
these like skin errors that we have.
Like how many of those do we have inside

451
00:18:58,771 --> 00:18:59,760
of ourselves?
You know,

452
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:03,570
like when people hear about people
having cysts and liver cysts and shit

453
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:05,760
like that inside of you like this dude,
I have,

454
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,270
I have a cyst when I was in,
when Jesus,

455
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,380
when I was in college,
I can't look away.

456
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:14,850
It's fucking insane.
No,

457
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:18,300
that's what I'm saying.
I'm in the sunken place,

458
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:20,090
Dude.
I can't fucking look away at the shout.

459
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,310
It's very interesting.
When I was in college,

460
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:24,930
Dude,
I thought I had nut cancer.

461
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,480
I thought I had testicle cancer and I
went into a doctor.

462
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,110
This is insane.
I want to do a campus doctor and he

463
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:34,380
feels around in my nuts and he feels the
bump and I'm sorry dude.

464
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,610
I tried for like two days.

465
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,410
He,
I started sucking my cock and he was

466
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,280
like,
I'm going to get that nut.

467
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,340
I'm going to get that.
There's only one way to get it out.

468
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,080
He said to me,
this is no shit.

469
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,490
He goes,
it's a buildup of seaman.

470
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,650
A fucking doctor said that and I was
like,

471
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,000
really?
He goes,

472
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:49,740
do you have a hot tub?
I was like,

473
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,720
there's one in my complex hook your
come.

474
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,700
He goes,
go in there and jerk off in the hot tub.

475
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,640
He told you to jerk off and swear to God
and tell me what time,

476
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:58,710
like 10 oh one and I don't want you to
look up.

477
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,251
He said,
well,

478
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:00,720
he's a military time actually.
Yeah.

479
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:05,721
He said,
he said at 2022 I want you to come close

480
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:09,970
your eyes.
If you're talking about a guy jerking

481
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,650
off and you're telling them how to do it
during military tiny 22 I want to watch

482
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,310
no dude.

483
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,930
This guy said it was a fucking,
I'm not kidding.

484
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:18,990
He said it was a build up of semen.
My Dad flew into town because he was

485
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:20,730
concerned cause I was like,
dude,

486
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:21,600
it freaked me out.
I was like,

487
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:24,930
I have this thing on my nut.
We went to the best doctor we could find

488
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,740
and the guy was like,
I should fucking have this other dude.

489
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:31,410
Like get his medical license removed.
He's like,

490
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:33,600
this is spilled up of semen is
completely incorrect.

491
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:36,330
This is a cyst on your testicle is not.
He's like,

492
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:37,560
it's benign.
It's you're fine.

493
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:39,970
But the fact that that's someone on
campus,

494
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,570
like a campus doctor told you that
that's a real medical professional.

495
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:44,670
He was probably high out of his mind.
Eight out of his fucking,

496
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,410
I went to Arizona state so he was
fucking lost.

497
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,920
Yeah.
It was just a dude.

498
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,040
They

499
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,550
found that morning at the bus stop.
That doesn't even make sense to me.

500
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,270
And um,
I don't have no medical training.

501
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,211
He said it.
I was like,

502
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:58,570
there's no chance send in video.
That's what it was.

503
00:20:58,571 --> 00:20:59,770
He's like,
take a video of it.

504
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,120
That's what I want you to do.
I want you to take your nuts and hold

505
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:07,780
them over a lamp so I could see through
your nuts and then take as many pictures

506
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,160
as you can.
No filter.

507
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,230
I'm going to bring in a couple other
boys in here.

508
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,750
Young boys don't use filters.
Have you seen that?

509
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,210
Have you seen that movie tickled?
Have you seen that documentary tickled?

510
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,140
I have not,
but it keeps getting recommended some.

511
00:21:18,141 --> 00:21:20,830
We're all going to have to watch it.
It's unreal.

512
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,100
If blows your fucking mind how these
guys were tricked into this.

513
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,170
It's as simple as young actors being
like,

514
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,990
you gotta,
you gotta just make a living.

515
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,150
Can,
can you let another guy tickle you on

516
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:34,630
the Internet for five minutes for a $100
and these young kids were like,

517
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,210
dude,
I've had friends get hit on by guys

518
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,550
during casting sessions.
Like just all,

519
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:41,470
just straight forward.
Like if you want to fuck.

520
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,030
Yeah,
like I've had friends,

521
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:47,080
like literally get propositioned.
I've had a few friends get propositioned

522
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:49,120
by some very,
very famous,

523
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,620
very famous people that are like,
you come to so's house.

524
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,200
No one will know.
No one will say anything.

525
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,690
But as a in the public eye,
people think they're straight.

526
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,990
There's such a leap man.
When you're a dude and you're straight

527
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:02,741
and you're like,
all right,

528
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:05,940
how much money is that really?
That is,

529
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:10,900
that is the crazy leap.
Like I honestly absolutely firmly

530
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:14,320
believe that prostitution should be
legal when you're 100% it doesn't make

531
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:16,960
any sense that you can decide to fuck
someone for free.

532
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,050
And we all agree that nobody got hurt.
But if some,

533
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:25,110
for some reason there's something wrong
with like someone paying you to jerk

534
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:26,470
them off,
well why?

535
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:26,860
What?
What?

536
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,290
What's the hires?
Can you imagine?

537
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,670
Do you imagine if fucking tiger woods,
if tiger woods could have had

538
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:36,040
prostitutes,
this would have never gotten exposed.

539
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,380
Do you think if that,
if prostitution was legal and it was

540
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:41,110
kind of not a full pot thing in society,
do you think he would have never had

541
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:45,370
this moment of collapse in his career?
He would change the way we look at sex.

542
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:48,520
If prostitution was legal like right.
Like it's,

543
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,780
it's so illegal and it's been illegal
for so long that if someone,

544
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:56,500
male or female has someone pay them for
sex,

545
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,880
you're a whore.
Right?

546
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,540
It's a label right away.
But we know for a fact that there's gold

547
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,460
diggers,
like gold diggers are real,

548
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,041
but they're not,
but,

549
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,800
and there are even hidden their blatant,
blatant,

550
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:05,950
yeah.

551
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,430
They just say Internet that you've seen
that if you ever seen that instagram

552
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,340
post where the,
there's these really hot like instagram

553
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:17,200
models and then it shows a picture in
the next box of a bunch of guys that are

554
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:22,201
like in their sixties with giant guts,
with hair on their guts is like those

555
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,420
instagram models in Dubai.
This is who's paying for those precise.

556
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,150
Yeah,
of course you,

557
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,960
we know those people exist and there's
nothing.

558
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,831
We don't care.
It's like,

559
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:31,540
look at her.
She got it good for her.

560
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,520
That like that Dan Bilzerian guy.
You know him?

561
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,300
Yeah.
That's like his,

562
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,440
that's his ammo.
Well,

563
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:36,940
sorta.
He's a good looking guy too.

564
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,230
Yeah,
but these women that are around,

565
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,250
they,
he knows what,

566
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,230
they're around four and she,
they know what they were around for it.

567
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,850
It's a,
it's a fucking mutual d.

568
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:45,200
It's a deal.
I think the best example of it was j

569
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:47,540
Howard Marshall and Anna Nicole Smith.
It totally,

570
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,850
and Anna Nicole Smith married that 90
year old dude.

571
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:54,851
It was in a wheelchair and she was just,
she was just giant titties and a big ass

572
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:57,290
and just out there.
Brilliant.

573
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,750
It was amazing.
It was amazing because it was so

574
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:01,250
blatant.
I had a whole bit about it.

575
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:02,270
In my act.
There is,

576
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:03,770
right.
She set the tone that's setting the

577
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:06,230
fucking town.
That's the gold standard of gold

578
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,210
diggers,
right?

579
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,103
Well,
yeah.

580
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,690
Come on.
And he's mourning.

581
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,830
Are there,
how is that not prostitution?

582
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,020
That's one of the funniest things
anybody said.

583
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,030
Go back to that photo.
Zoom in on his face.

584
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,300
Look at how unhappy he looks.
It's remarkable.

585
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,510
This guy is so fucking old.
He can't formulate a smile when he's

586
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:27,560
marrying a woman his age.
And I think at the time she was a

587
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:30,620
lesbian,
so she was just eating pussy and hanging

588
00:24:30,621 --> 00:24:33,440
out with him and she had to do like
marital relations with them.

589
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:35,390
And when she would do the marital
relations with them,

590
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,920
you know,
she would just like tell them to go to

591
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:38,630
work.
What does she,

592
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:40,040
what does she got to do?
He can't fuck.

593
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:40,874
What does she got to do?
Just that

594
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,780
tug.
Suck his dick.

595
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,370
I suck them exclusive.

596
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,780
Maybe.
Did they have Viagara back then?

597
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,400
No,
I don't think so.

598
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,340
I think they did.
I think we came up with the timeline for

599
00:24:51,341 --> 00:24:53,350
Viagara.
Maybe they came up with it for him

600
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:01,610
is all his research money,
not that close to Mary and Anna Nicole

601
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,870
Smith.
You piece of shit.

602
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,990
Make something.
Keep my tick hard for an hour and a

603
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,240
half.
I've got $10 billion and not a lot of

604
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:13,030
time and watch or listen to me.
You son of a bitch.

605
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,820
That's so crazy.
I love it.

606
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Good for him.
Go out with a bang or at least attempt

607
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,640
and attempted a bang.
Is he dead?

608
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,750
Yeah,
he's dead as fuck.

609
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:27,440
What'd he say?
Of Happiness data.

610
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,080
Being a boy.
He died in joy.

611
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,690
The world blessed him in his final
years,

612
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,210
but that's legal.
It's totally legal.

613
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,360
Totally marry someone and have sex with
them for money as long as you marry them

614
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:40,960
and then get to steal all their money.
And it's like a small transaction.

615
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:44,460
Like if he could just pay her like for j
Howard Marshall,

616
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:48,340
a multibillionaire type character up a
hundred grand's not out of the question.

617
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,810
It's nothing.
One,

618
00:25:49,811 --> 00:25:52,600
one evening for a hundred grand.
It seems like a worthy proposition.

619
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,381
Here's this,
this,

620
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:54,210
this.
If he's a b,

621
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,500
this is,
someone told me this recently,

622
00:25:55,501 --> 00:25:56,880
we were talking about this.
This is amazing.

623
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,330
The different between a million and a
billion because I think in America we

624
00:26:00,331 --> 00:26:02,280
just kind of like,
we don't even think about it.

625
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:03,001
You know,
you just hear it.

626
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:03,750
You're like billion.
Oh,

627
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,800
he must be a billionaire.
You know,

628
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,060
I'm sure someone,
Joe Rogan,

629
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,710
who's,
who's got to be a fucking billionaire

630
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:09,390
dude,
here's the difference that people don't

631
00:26:09,391 --> 00:26:13,350
realize a million seconds is,
is how many days would you guess?

632
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,780
A million seconds.
I've done this before and I always

633
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:18,480
forget it.
Do you know a million second million?

634
00:26:18,481 --> 00:26:20,460
Second 30 days.
That's a great guess.

635
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,030
Okay,
is it?

636
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,380
It's 11 days.
That's good.

637
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:25,300
Most people are fucking way off.
So it's 11 days chance.

638
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,490
Yeah,
that's good.

639
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,270
A million seconds is 11 days.
How many days is a billion seconds?

640
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,630
How many 31 years.
Jesus.

641
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,380
11 days to 31 fucking years.
Jesus,

642
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,560
look at that.
So when

643
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,460
trillion seconds is 31,000 years,
when tries to fucking say like they

644
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:45,810
understand what a billion is.
You're like,

645
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:47,610
you have no fucking idea what a billion
is.

646
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,580
Up to billion is so beyond far away.
Now,

647
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,150
as far as it's been explained to me,
and I've never researched this at all,

648
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,800
so I wonder if you could find this out.
Someone said to me that when you look at

649
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:01,860
the richest man in the world,
like they look at like Warren Buffet and

650
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:05,850
Bill Gates and all those George Soros,
all or characters that they're not

651
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:09,180
really the richest men in the world,
that the real richest man in the world

652
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,530
are these Saudi guys.
Yep.

653
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,040
And a lot of these oil guys,
but they're their monarchs and they

654
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,860
don't have to disclose their wealth.
They never do.

655
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,900
It's not like they're the CEO of a
corporation there.

656
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:22,560
Their head of a royal family that they,
oh no government,

657
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:24,600
any indication of what their earnings
are.

658
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,740
So this dude who knows one of those cats
was telling me that he's probably a

659
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:31,260
trillionaire fuck me.
And I was like,

660
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:32,100
what?
I go,

661
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:33,510
that's real.
And he goes,

662
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:33,930
yeah,
I go to,

663
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,310
I didn't know there was trillionaires.
He goes,

664
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,790
it's very likely this guy might have
access to $1 trillion.

665
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,920
Because the only thing that we know is
our famous billionaires were infatuated

666
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:47,820
with our billionaires that we kind of
have as these social icons.

667
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:49,560
You know,
like Zuckerberg and these guys that are

668
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:51,540
like,
they did something that we can recognize

669
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,580
these Saudi families that have had that
money,

670
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:56,130
have had that money for a fucking long
time.

671
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,420
It's not new money.
No,

672
00:27:57,421 --> 00:27:59,250
this is old bit.
They had,

673
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,280
they had hundreds of millions 50 years
ago.

674
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,980
Right.
So now it's only accumulated into

675
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,360
billions of,
I mean they own,

676
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,950
well the what the um,
that guy that the Chinese billionaire

677
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:11,820
that,
um,

678
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,140
what was his name?

679
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,660
He just bought the Basquiat.
Oh,

680
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:18,120
we had this Japanese.
Japanese,

681
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,030
yeah,
$100 million that we just were talking

682
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:23,610
about that which shows as bill burr.
Yeah.

683
00:28:23,611 --> 00:28:26,040
Dude,
on 110 I think it was.

684
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,870
I mean,
and he owns another one that he got for

685
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:30,630
like 57 but that 50 sevens nothing to
him that's like,

686
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:34,290
it's a flick guy's insane.
Who's this cat?

687
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,430
One point 4 trillion fucking dollars.
Oh my God.

688
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,930
See?
Oh my God,

689
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:44,931
the royal family is worth a staggering
one point 4 trillion Solomon bin.

690
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:50,660
Abdulaziz he sowed pictured is the
current king too.

691
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:55,320
That's balling on a whole new level.
So that's just new shit.

692
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,890
One point 4 trillion.
Oh my God.

693
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:01,380
Who is this guy?
The Rothschild Rothschild's.

694
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:02,250
Yeah,
for sure.

695
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,100
There's probably a bunch of those little
scoundrels running around taking a piece

696
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:07,250
of that pie,
but that's a,

697
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:12,270
so a billion is a thousand million
thousand 700 trillion.

698
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,690
The rothschilds estimated between 1
billion and 700 trillion.

699
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,490
Hey,
how about you do a better job?

700
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,110
I could do as good a job of estimating.
Is that no shit.

701
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:27,390
That's so far.
Probably a kazillion.

702
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,680
It's like when you ask a kid how much a
car is and they're like eight $8 and

703
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:32,041
you're like,
yeah,

704
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,600
it's like $8.
That's how much cars are.

705
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,950
$8 hundred dollars yes,
exactly.

706
00:29:35,951 --> 00:29:37,210
It is a Mercedes.
So

707
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,620
how the fuck could they have such
terrible like gap in there?

708
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,550
They're guesstimate.

709
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,230
Well,
that's gotta be key that see those kind

710
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:46,000
of old families that have been around
for that long,

711
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:51,270
you know that they hide money.
They don't like when they say x amount

712
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:54,550
of dollars,
it's because that's what they've been

713
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:57,130
told this for so many sources.
I used to know that.

714
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:58,400
You know the guy,
this Guy George Soros,

715
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,910
do you know who that is?
They got to bring them back in

716
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:01,180
Manhattan,
the name,

717
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,570
because everyone brings it up when they
talk about like anyone on the rights.

718
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:08,380
I like Alex Jones and said that George
Soros was making the marijuana stronger

719
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,960
from mind control.
I take it once a year.

720
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,450
I smoked marijuana to test the
efficiency.

721
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,350
I like how he's the gauge.
I'm going to do it for America.

722
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,370
Yeah,
I will smoke.

723
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:21,150
He says he's functioning once a year.
He said that during his custody trial

724
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,061
once,
that's it.

725
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:25,090
Just once a year to test its potency.
That's George Soros.

726
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:30,370
So I party with his kid one time,
25.2 billion.

727
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,300
I party with this kid

728
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:36,450
time with one of these Hollywood things
and I've never seen someone so,

729
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,230
and I'm not gonna say anything negative
about him and I just never seen that

730
00:30:40,231 --> 00:30:41,460
kind of money firsthand.
I've never,

731
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,460
I'd never known a billionaire I've ever
been friends with a billionaire and this

732
00:30:44,461 --> 00:30:49,350
kid was so lucid.
It was almost as if he's not living now

733
00:30:49,351 --> 00:30:50,550
at all.
He's just kind of go,

734
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,230
it's just flow.
He's so floating.

735
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,370
It's like whatever happens,
happens.

736
00:30:53,371 --> 00:30:54,480
I said,
where are you staying while you're here?

737
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:55,740
He's like,
with these guys,

738
00:30:55,741 --> 00:30:56,880
I guess.
I was like,

739
00:30:56,881 --> 00:30:58,230
what do you do?
You have suitcases and shit.

740
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,280
You're in town from New York,
like,

741
00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:00,150
are you not?
He's like,

742
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:00,990
Nah,
I just fucking,

743
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,790
I don't know.
I'm going to figure it out.

744
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:05,970
I guess bounce around a little bit.
I think it's just like there is no,

745
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,160
there's no groundedness.
When you're that rich,

746
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:09,240
it's almost like,
I don't know,

747
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:12,780
I can do anything all the time forever.
There's no source of

748
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,420
repetitiveness.
Yeah.

749
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,660
Yeah.
I don't think it's a good thing.

750
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,410
It's so bad.
It's,

751
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,170
it doesn't seem to work out.
I mean,

752
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:25,171
I would think the only way you would get
a kid through that is you got to take

753
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:27,820
them to sports or something.
You got to get them involved in some

754
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,560
adversity.
He's got to lose at something.

755
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:30,670
Yeah,
a lot.

756
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,760
If you lose,
if you lose it,

757
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:31,850
right?

758
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,580
Shit.
And you start to understand how human

759
00:31:34,581 --> 00:31:35,780
you are when you're like,
oh my God,

760
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:38,240
there's so many people better than me at
so many fucking things,

761
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,100
dude.
Because when you're given everything,

762
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,480
you never lose.
You never,

763
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,850
you never heard no.
There's no negative in your life.

764
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,090
It's just kind of like,
how do you get any sense of fucking,

765
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,970
you know,
any normalcy or anything grounded in

766
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:51,230
your hands when you're like,
yeah,

767
00:31:51,231 --> 00:31:52,550
we need feedback.
Yeah.

768
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,840
You need to know that that's not good
and that's okay and that's terrible and

769
00:31:56,841 --> 00:31:59,180
that's good.
You need to know where you land on the

770
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:01,610
spectrum of in the social world.
That's why so many rich kids are

771
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:04,490
socially so fucking awkward because they
never had to,

772
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,360
they never got beat up at school.
They never got made fun of whose it was

773
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:10,100
all like fucking flat

774
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,030
flats.
All flat.

775
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,020
Yeah,
you can't have all flat.

776
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,280
You don't want to have too many crazy
dips cause then you're fucking,

777
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:22,290
but you definitely don't want flat.
Like the worst drive ever is not the

778
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:25,380
longest drive.
The worst drive ever is like when you

779
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:27,360
drive in and those,
those roads,

780
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:29,640
the people we stopped take album cover
pictures in.

781
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,110
Yeah.
Well you just see just flat and nothing

782
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,680
forever.
There's nothing just flat.

783
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,700
Like if you go the same distance but
you're driving on like the the Pacific

784
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:40,670
coast and you're headed up to San
Francisco,

785
00:32:40,671 --> 00:32:43,180
it's fucking beautiful.
Barely recognize you.

786
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,900
First of all,
he's like the cliffs right there.

787
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,430
Fucking clips.
Right.

788
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,640
What if I just fucking,
you could just do that and people do do

789
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:52,160
that for sure.
They just go off that cliff and you just

790
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:54,380
want to make sure the guy on the other
side is not thinking,

791
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:57,470
I'm just going to head on this guy and
we're both going to go off this cliff,

792
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,180
do this shit together.
Let's do this shit.

793
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:00,980
I'm going to drag somebody with me.
Fuck him.

794
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,060
Ah,
the last moments of your life flying off

795
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:08,990
a cliff because some pilled up asshole
decided just slam into you and one

796
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:10,460
afternoon it can happen.

797
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,270
Have you seen those birds that jumped
off the cliff right after they're born?

798
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,470
Have you seen these [inaudible]?
This video?

799
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,770
Yeah.
Yes.

800
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,460
Look up.
Look up bird jumps off cliff after

801
00:33:21,461 --> 00:33:23,140
birth.
So the moment they hatched,

802
00:33:23,141 --> 00:33:26,500
the mother and the father go to the
bottom of this like 500 foot cliff and

803
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:28,540
the birds jump and he's,
and they hit them.

804
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,420
They hit rocks all the way down and
whoever survives survives with the

805
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:32,830
parents.
Oh my God.

806
00:33:32,831 --> 00:33:33,760
Dude,
it's fucking amazing.

807
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,720
I just saw it on,
it's on,

808
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,620
I think it's on,
um,

809
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,040
on planet earth.
Planet Earth.

810
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,120
I can't really show this thought.
It's the people.

811
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:41,530
I'll,
I'll link to Katie or something.

812
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,620
But what is a video called?
So people getting chicks jump off

813
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:45,820
cliffs,
chicks jump off cliff,

814
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,220
which is another one that they do here
in la,

815
00:33:48,221 --> 00:33:49,280
sometimes in Hollywood.
But

816
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,080
I think that different,
look at God,

817
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,330
this is insane.
They don't even have wings yet.

818
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,020
Nope.
Nothing.

819
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,720
Nothing.
Just fucking bold.

820
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,580
Oh my God,
this is insane.

821
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,390
This is insane.
So this poor little thing is,

822
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,700
it's kind of like a flying squirrel
looking situation.

823
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,830
This is insane,
dude.

824
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:13,750
The first time I watched it,
I was so baked.

825
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,310
I was like,
is this a loop?

826
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,960
Because it looks like it's never going
to end.

827
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:21,730
It's so far.
I think he says it 500 or 600 feet or

828
00:34:21,731 --> 00:34:24,700
something so insane that this is how
life gets born.

829
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,060
Oh my God.
And he hits the rocks and you've got to

830
00:34:28,061 --> 00:34:29,650
assume he's dead.
Nope.

831
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,500
Oh my God.
He's going to hit more rocks.

832
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,050
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

833
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:39,040
So many fucking rocks thing.
It's flipping head over heels.

834
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,930
It hits more rocks.
Oh,

835
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:42,860
he a little grass.
Derek got caught a break.

836
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,280
Break,
break,

837
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,540
break,
break.

838
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,940
Look at this thing.
It's going down the side of the cliff.

839
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,650
Head over heels,
headfirst,

840
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,230
asshole.
Head head to a rock for a second.

841
00:34:53,231 --> 00:34:54,460
Assault to a rock.
Got a minute.

842
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:55,510
We've got to break.
Nope.

843
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:58,140
Gotta let her mind break again.
And then more,

844
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,830
more bouncing.
Boom.

845
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,480
Head for others.
Your face.

846
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,510
There's your Dick Hole.
Here's a rock up your asshole.

847
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,600
Here's one of the side of your face.
She's one of your eyes.

848
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:09,550
Here's one year,
oh,

849
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:12,580
another hundred feet to go again.
There's mom and dad and mom's like,

850
00:35:12,581 --> 00:35:14,110
cause this mother fucker gonna make it.
Look it.

851
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,340
There's another one behind it.
No,

852
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,540
look at this.
Boom.

853
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,870
How's he doing?
So then the insane,

854
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,870
they stop and wait to see which ones,
which ones live.

855
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,370
Jesus Christ nature.
So harsh.

856
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,790
See,
I knew you would love this because I

857
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:30,830
thought about you the first time I saw
this and I was like,

858
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,920
this is so fucking proof about
surviving,

859
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:35,180
dude.
It's so survival.

860
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,710
This,
this is the most basic.

861
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,250
You have to leap and almost died

862
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,810
the moment you enter the world.
God chick is tough as fuck survival.

863
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:47,811
Do five rounds of Giorgio Petrosian and
just shake it off as rgo versus dead

864
00:35:49,121 --> 00:35:50,060
one.
Yeah,

865
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,450
there's one that didn't make it.
I'm sure there's a ton of dead ones.

866
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,260
Oh Jesus.
Fucking Christ.

867
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,700
Yeah.
You could actually hit one of those

868
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:59,580
corners and it could gut you.
You know for sure.

869
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,200
Yep.
I mean this is all shale.

870
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,740
That stuff is so dangerous.
That's all that one's dying.

871
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,371
Oh,
Jamie,

872
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,230
don't show us this.
This is so sad.

873
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,640
I had a bird come on my house the other
day and this poor little fuckers.

874
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,150
He flew right into the wind delt dunk.
I'm sorry to laugh.

875
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,870
Every time I see that he was going to go
out and then woke up and then flew into

876
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:23,580
another window full speed dunk out cold.
So I thought he was,

877
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,080
I thought he's probably dead.

878
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,520
And My,
my daughter's going,

879
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,860
oh no.
Is he going to die?

880
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:29,700
I go,
we don't know honey.

881
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:31,530
Let's,
let's put him outside and hopefully

882
00:36:31,531 --> 00:36:33,720
he'll wake up.
Fucker woke up.

883
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,501
He did.
Yeah.

884
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:37,950
He woke up like five minutes later.
He like shook it off and facility away.

885
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,340
Like imagine that was a person that
thing's going like 30 miles an hour

886
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:44,690
right into a window.
Dunk that tiny bird to just,

887
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,850
he got k code,
but then got up and flew away.

888
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,760
Came back for another round rock came in
the house.

889
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:52,460
That was weird.
Uh,

890
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,850
buddies.
I was at a buddy's house,

891
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:56,100
uh,
at this like party in a fucking

892
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,860
hummingbird flew right into the house
like right through the double doors.

893
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,260
Oh Geez.
Stuck in a skylights and it was

894
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,510
panicking because he didn't know what to
it.

895
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:06,720
Like it wasn't willing to come down.
So I was just fucked up enough that I

896
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:07,980
was like,
I have this idea.

897
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,550
Give me a fucking huge pan,
the biggest pan from the kitchen and

898
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:16,551
pour a sugar and water and heat up the
sugar a little bit so and put it and I

899
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:19,110
put the Pan Up to it.
I got an a ladder,

900
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,850
put it up.
It started getting in there to drink the

901
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:24,990
sugar water and I slowly took it down
and walked outside some wizard shit

902
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,900
wizardry dude.
I was fucking magic hands.

903
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,720
That's very smart.
You ever seen them in slow mo?

904
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:32,070
Man,
they're so bizarre.

905
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,430
They're fucking,
their wings are moving so fast.

906
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,870
Unbelievable.
It's insane.

907
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:38,130
Like it's beautiful to watch,
man.

908
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,040
Oh Man.
I was in Costa Rica and we went to this

909
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,140
place that had a,
a,

910
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,520
it had some sort of a sanctuary for
them.

911
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,630
The humming bird sanctuary.
Yeah.

912
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:48,180
Do you know what it is?
I went down to Costa Rica just last

913
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,470
year.
So they have,

914
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,280
you know,
you can,

915
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,340
they have these feeders to see,
just hang out by them and take slow mo

916
00:37:53,341 --> 00:37:56,190
on your iphone and you see the thing
floating around your head.

917
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,950
There it is right there.
I mean they could just hover.

918
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,070
It's so crazy.
Like how did they evolve like this?

919
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,560
It's so strange.
Like no other bird makes that,

920
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:10,730
that weird sound when it goes by you.
It's like they have little wings but

921
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:14,310
they move stupid fast.
How many,

922
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,740
how many?
How many per cause?

923
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,890
It'd say like how many,
uh,

924
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,760
I knew their heartbeat is insane.
The heartbeat is like there's a hundred

925
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:22,860
times ours or something like that.
They're so cute.

926
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,290
They don't seem like killers at all.
No.

927
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,240
Right.
They're just out there eating pollen and

928
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:28,074
shit.
Right.

929
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,070
Look at that.
Look at that.

930
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,880
It's incredible.
Did they eat bugs?

931
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,400
Like what do they eat?
They got that little tongue sticking

932
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:38,880
out.
Like going for like nectar and steps for

933
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:39,720
nectar.
Yeah.

934
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,600
This is going to have some facts for us.
How many birdly one to three egg several

935
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:45,940
times per year.
Eggs are about the size of a jelly bean.

936
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,083
Oh,

937
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,370
that's not good facts.
I want to know what they eat.

938
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,140
I want to know that kind of shit will
get ahead knows there's the craziest

939
00:38:55,141 --> 00:38:57,000
beaks too.
Like if that was a giant bird,

940
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,080
you'd be like,
what the fuck?

941
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,060
That's pretty sick.
Did you see what that just said?

942
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,880
You had an extra set of eyelids and they
can see ultraviolet.

943
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,970
Oh,
that's fucking amazing.

944
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,970
Whoa.
That beak is crazy.

945
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,450
That beats like a Narwhal Horn.
Like it's so tiny.

946
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:14,820
We don't notice how crazy long their
beaks are too.

947
00:39:14,821 --> 00:39:15,970
That's the other thing I haven't seen
that they can,

948
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,210
there is no consistency of color between
all the birds.

949
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,820
Do you know what I mean?
Like usually most species have a similar

950
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,550
color pattern or the,
is there a bunch of different kinds of

951
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:25,350
hummingbirds?
Oh,

952
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:26,870
they do.
Insects powers,

953
00:39:26,871 --> 00:39:29,670
saps out tree,
sap pollen and insects.

954
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,530
So they're omnivores.
Interesting that birds are a trip,

955
00:39:34,531 --> 00:39:35,320
dude.
They,

956
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,740
there are some of the most unique
animals on our planet.

957
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,270
I've I really 15 or them.
I really ignored birds until I saw my

958
00:39:42,271 --> 00:39:45,210
first eagle and person in the wild.
It's crazy,

959
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:45,610
right?

960
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,443
Yeah.
If I saw it,

961
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,190
I was with a Ari.
We were in,

962
00:39:48,191 --> 00:39:49,480
um,
uh,

963
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,920
Alaska.
We were in anchorage.

964
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,200
We're going fishing for salmon fishing.
We're like,

965
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:56,010
dude,
that's a fucking Wild Eagle Eagles.

966
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,320
You stand there on this branch.
Just looking down on us.

967
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,500
I was like,
what?

968
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,050
Like you started realizing what they
really are like,

969
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:04,990
well,
that's how I got murdering dinosaur bird

970
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,710
that flies around and snatches fish out
of the water was wearing a star fish.

971
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,780
It's chilling.
We were catching these fish do do.

972
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:12,010
They were like this big,
this salmon,

973
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:12,881
these,
these,

974
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:17,650
these powerful fish and this eagle comes
down and grabs it out of the water with

975
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:20,470
his talents and flies with it.
It's fucking awesome,

976
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:22,780
dude.
I started tripping out on birds after

977
00:40:22,781 --> 00:40:24,390
that.
Just be in DM.

978
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,660
Being near them in,
in the,

979
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,650
in the wild and seeing them move around.
It just seems so different than seeing

980
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:30,484
them in the zoo.

981
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,690
They're so fucking hardcore.
They're wingspans are so amazing to me

982
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:38,490
when they opened up how fucking huge
there.

983
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,870
Whenever you see one in person you're
like,

984
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,990
that is way bigger than I thought
whatsoever.

985
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:47,040
It's a view back to a much more ancient
style of living thing,

986
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,040
you know?
I mean it's a view back to dinosaurs and

987
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:54,120
they're starting to realize more and
more dinosaurs fossils are being found

988
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:56,040
with feathers.
Let me fucking birds is,

989
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,270
have you ever seen a moose in real life?
Oh yeah.

990
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:01,020
I've shot a Moose Moose right there.
Whenever I go,

991
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,180
whenever I go up to Canada like have you
ever been a Bam?

992
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,110
You know where that is?
An Alberta?

993
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,870
Yeah,
I know that it is dude that at that has

994
00:41:06,871 --> 00:41:09,360
the biggest Moose I've ever seen in my,
like I've seen,

995
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,760
I've seen Moose when I was kid,
but nothing like up in northern Canada.

996
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,170
Dude.
I mean beaut,

997
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,930
the size of a fucking school bus.
I mean it's so big.

998
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,810
I think people think they think they
know what a Moose is cause you're like,

999
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:20,430
yeah,
I think it's like a cow or something.

1000
00:41:20,431 --> 00:41:21,330
You know what I mean?
Dude,

1001
00:41:21,331 --> 00:41:23,040
they're massive,
massive pelvis.

1002
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,240
They're so big.
Shocking.

1003
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,800
It was twice the size of our car.
I was like,

1004
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,390
get the fuck Outta here.
That's a moose there.

1005
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,670
They're so big.
It's insane.

1006
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:31,710
And if you run into him like you hit him
with your car,

1007
00:41:31,711 --> 00:41:32,970
you're fucked.
You're fucked.

1008
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,040
They would read.
They'll requeue.

1009
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,960
That was a grown up in the midwest,
dude.

1010
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:38,240
I'd hear people getting bad car
accidents with deer all the time.

1011
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,580
These guys in Canada,
there is no stories about it.

1012
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,660
You Die.
You hit a fucking,

1013
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,321
it's not like,
dude.

1014
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:44,870
You hear about Mikey fucking hit a deer.
It's like you hit a moose.

1015
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:48,250
It's like Mike's car exploded.
Mike is,

1016
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,150
Mike is dead.

1017
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:52,420
Dear will fuck you up though.
There's plenty of mine who lives in

1018
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:56,080
Oregon of guy on the highway in his
neighborhood.

1019
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,470
Hit a deer.
The deer flipped over his car and hit

1020
00:41:59,471 --> 00:42:02,830
the car behind him.
Fuck and went through the windshield and

1021
00:42:02,831 --> 00:42:05,080
killed the guy.
Really Nice guy was fine.

1022
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,580
The first guy was fine.
The car,

1023
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,520
the deer flipped over his car,
like as he hit it,

1024
00:42:09,521 --> 00:42:13,090
it went flying through the air and then
it landed like right,

1025
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,580
right on his fucking into this guy's car
and killed them.

1026
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,640
The craziest Shit I ever saw.
I was like eight years old.

1027
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,970
My Dad drive it on the fucking Dan Ryan
in Chicago and a car.

1028
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,370
Uh,
the middle of the lane was,

1029
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,330
the fastening was under construction.
A car went over the fucking median on to

1030
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:30,000
oncoming traffic and hit another car.
Oh Geez.

1031
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,300
Like a hundred yards in front of us.
I watched it fucking happened.

1032
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,290
It was the craziest Shit I've ever seen
in my life.

1033
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,640
And he was like,
the afternoon,

1034
00:42:35,641 --> 00:42:37,360
I don't know if he was fucked up or what
booth,

1035
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,330
right over the median shred into another
car.

1036
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,090
She,
and you saw the whole thing I watched.

1037
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,350
I watch it happen.
I mean,

1038
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:45,000
it felt so fake when I was a kid.
I remember thinking,

1039
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,270
I remember getting older and asking my
dad if it happened because I thought,

1040
00:42:48,271 --> 00:42:48,601
you know,
in,

1041
00:42:48,601 --> 00:42:51,540
in your childhood sometimes you're like,
did I see that in a fucking thing?

1042
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:53,100
And that it wasn't real.
You know,

1043
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:55,830
and you formulate these different
stories in your brain as a kid cause

1044
00:42:55,831 --> 00:42:57,840
you're,
you know that line of what's real and

1045
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,400
fake when you're so young.
But dude,

1046
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:03,200
I w I can't forget that happened.
It was Cray Z.

1047
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,500
Dot.
Is Craig perfectly hit another car.

1048
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:08,400
It was almost as if like magnetic
fucking head,

1049
00:43:08,401 --> 00:43:09,750
right head on.
Wow.

1050
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,673
Yeah.
It was wild.

1051
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,800
I think those fast and the furious
movies at fuck people up when it comes

1052
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,690
to like what you can and can't do in a
car.

1053
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,470
Yeah.
Did they jump a car from like a building

1054
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,680
and shit to another building and live,
it's fucking insane.

1055
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,630
I mean there's a lot of

1056
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,400
dumb kids out there that watch those
movies.

1057
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,960
They gotta be like,
Yo man,

1058
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:31,350
I got to give that a shot.
Has to be someone cause it thinks that

1059
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,390
that's what's going to happen when they
get behind the wheel.

1060
00:43:34,391 --> 00:43:35,470
Bro,
I'm going to be the best ever.

1061
00:43:35,471 --> 00:43:38,020
I never even drove yet,
but once I drive,

1062
00:43:38,021 --> 00:43:39,640
I'm going to be the best fucking over
overdog.

1063
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:43,180
I watched that movie all the time.
He would just want to be cool.

1064
00:43:43,181 --> 00:43:43,750
They want to be

1065
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,610
the aunt ship,
spin that wheel.

1066
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,980
Did you ever watch those fail videos
online of people showing off like

1067
00:43:50,981 --> 00:43:52,750
showboating and nice cars.
That's my fear.

1068
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,980
That's one of my favorite stream.
Yeah.

1069
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:57,870
They were always like some guys like
some guys like spinning the wheels dude,

1070
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,640
some guy like a fucking gtr.
I was like

1071
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,680
just right into the fucking wall next to
him.

1072
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,270
Just spin out,
crash right away.

1073
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:05,890
It's just dude,
it's great.

1074
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,320
I love to see that shit.
I love to see people showing off and

1075
00:44:08,321 --> 00:44:11,740
then right away they're fucked.
I love that shit.

1076
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,210
Nothing funnier.
How many

1077
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:16,020
videos of that now too?
I mean there's so,

1078
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:19,070
it's almost like if you have a camera
and you're pointing it out,

1079
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,560
the guy who Kinda hexing him cause he's
saying,

1080
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:23,300
man,
I hope I don't fuck this up because it's

1081
00:44:23,301 --> 00:44:27,140
going to be on every site.
Everyone's twitter account,

1082
00:44:27,141 --> 00:44:29,930
instagram page.
It's like you're kind of like putting

1083
00:44:29,931 --> 00:44:33,270
too much pressure on them.
Your accident is now sharable.

1084
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,730
Yeah.
Your mistakes are now.

1085
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:39,000
Everyone's a joy.
That's the world we're in now.

1086
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,850
Your fuck ups could be of somebody great
Monday,

1087
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,950
you know,
come to the new world is brilliant.

1088
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,170
It's a crazy new world.
Man didn't exist.

1089
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,970
It was never like this.
Yeah.

1090
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:49,950
You didn't have to worry about someone
seeing your fuck up.

1091
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,990
How old are you?
33 I'm 49 when I was a kid.

1092
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,480
We didn't even have,
like when I was born,

1093
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:01,890
back in the day you heard stories,
somebody fucked up somewhere over there.

1094
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,330
This guy did that,
you know,

1095
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,201
that's all.
That's all.

1096
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:08,760
There was one guy in our town killed
someone in a car and dragged this guy

1097
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,370
around.
Like he,

1098
00:45:10,371 --> 00:45:13,260
he got the guy stuck under his car and
he just kept driving.

1099
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,480
Fuck.
Did he not know he was under there or he

1100
00:45:15,481 --> 00:45:16,051
was like,
fuck it.

1101
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:17,010
I don't care.
I'm going to prison.

1102
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:17,844
I know,
I know.

1103
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,370
They don't know if he was drunk.
I don't,

1104
00:45:20,371 --> 00:45:22,410
I don't know.
I don't know when he got caught either,

1105
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,290
but it was a story.
It was in the news and I remember it was

1106
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:26,030
in like,
uh,

1107
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:29,820
I was delivering newspapers at the time
so I saw it like in the newspapers that

1108
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:32,820
I was delivering.
It's so weird to have known someone and

1109
00:45:32,821 --> 00:45:36,000
then know that they ran over somebody in
a car and then dragged it around.

1110
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,050
Yeah,
I didn't know him well,

1111
00:45:37,051 --> 00:45:38,940
but he was like one of those guys in the
town.

1112
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,700
I think he was a little older than me,
but he was one of those guys that was

1113
00:45:41,701 --> 00:45:43,500
always kind of hanging out with a nice
car.

1114
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,900
He has had like a,
a nice trans-am IROC Z was about the,

1115
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,670
yeah,
his family had money and uh,

1116
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,560
he ran over someone and dragged them
around.

1117
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,950
There was always this thing about people
whose families had money,

1118
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,810
like the rich kids get away with it.
Well it was,

1119
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,130
it was a weird thing too.
It's like we knew that there were like a

1120
00:46:02,131 --> 00:46:04,920
little off.
Like you always knew that the rich kids

1121
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:08,110
were never like a complete human right.
They were always like,

1122
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,250
like there was just a few of them that
were just a little like if you knew

1123
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:12,720
their rich,
there's probably a lot of kids that we

1124
00:46:12,721 --> 00:46:14,820
did know they were rich and they are
rich,

1125
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:16,770
but it was,
they weren't fucked up so it didn't come

1126
00:46:16,771 --> 00:46:17,310
through.

1127
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,350
But the ones that wanted everybody to
know they were rich.

1128
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:23,370
Like I always had designer clothes on
and they always had the nicest shit and

1129
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:26,280
they always had like brand new cars.
Like when they were 17,

1130
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:28,860
this guy had a brand new car there.
It's almost like there are,

1131
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,740
uh,
a little bit,

1132
00:46:30,741 --> 00:46:32,070
uh,
animatronic like,

1133
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:35,760
or something robotic about really rich
kids where it's just kind of like a

1134
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:39,120
super,
super high functioning in a very like,

1135
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:43,110
disconnected level because they're so
unaware of what it's like to not have.

1136
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,480
Yeah.
Well I'm watching these shows.

1137
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,550
My kid,
we went to see this,

1138
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,950
a diary of a wimpy kid.
Yay.

1139
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:51,690
Thankfully a funny movie,
man.

1140
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,390
This is a funny shit in there.
I laughed hard a couple of times.

1141
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:55,224
That movie.
Yeah,

1142
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:59,130
I just went because they wanted to go.
But in this movie,

1143
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:02,490
one of the things that's like,
it really strikes home is like everyone

1144
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:03,270
is struggling.

1145
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,090
It's fuck kids.
Like everything has fallen apart always

1146
00:47:06,091 --> 00:47:07,050
constantly.
Right.

1147
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:09,990
And because of that,
he's kind of got a fun personality.

1148
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,840
Like he gets checked all the time.
As soon as he gets cocky,

1149
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,140
he gets crushed again.
Right.

1150
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:18,210
It just keeps happening through and
there's a whole series of these movies,

1151
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,480
but I like,
that's not happening to that.

1152
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,530
The rich kid that I grew up with,
no fuss.

1153
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:28,530
That's why probably when he hit the guy
in his car and had the guy stuck under

1154
00:47:28,531 --> 00:47:29,080
his car,
he didn't,

1155
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,560
what the fuck to do?
I mean,

1156
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,630
he just thought he was gonna get away
with whatever he figured.

1157
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,460
He figured,
I just gotta get,

1158
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,500
I gotta get away.
Just cleaned the car.

1159
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,910
There was a kid I went to high school

1160
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,970
with that,
uh,

1161
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,030
had a hit and run and didn't,
and they got,

1162
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:45,380
he got away with it.
I mean,

1163
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,850
obviously I didn't know it was this kid.
I went to high school,

1164
00:47:46,851 --> 00:47:48,440
but he got away with it for a long
fucking time.

1165
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,360
It was such a public story that f a
famous nascar driver at the time painted

1166
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,410
her name on his car,
like find so-and-so's killer because it

1167
00:47:57,411 --> 00:48:01,190
was such a fucking big deal.
This girl that was hit and run and he

1168
00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:03,440
came out years later,
this is crazy.

1169
00:48:03,441 --> 00:48:06,770
He was pilled pilled the fuck up.
And he showed up to her sister's house

1170
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,370
and admitted the whole thing to her
sister and was saying he was gonna like

1171
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:11,600
run away,
kill himself,

1172
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:13,160
whatever.
And she cleverly,

1173
00:48:13,161 --> 00:48:16,760
she spoke Polish,
she told her husband to fucking call the

1174
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:19,040
cops and was trying to call him this kid
down in the meanwhile,

1175
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:22,160
telling him to call the cops and they
finally caught this kid before he could

1176
00:48:22,161 --> 00:48:25,070
fucking off himself or something.
But he killed this girl on a hit and run

1177
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,870
and thought he and God,
for what it's worth,

1178
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:28,940
got away with it for a long time,
man.

1179
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:32,690
But he was probably not a bad person.
He just was weak at the time.

1180
00:48:32,691 --> 00:48:34,000
And it haunted for,
yeah,

1181
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,800
he had it had to come out fuck crazy.
Right.

1182
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,840
That's a mistake that if you make it,
God damn it.

1183
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,590
She liked that happened like,
like from from your area of where you

1184
00:48:42,591 --> 00:48:44,540
grew up.
Like do you read stuff now years later

1185
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:47,630
that you hear about fucked up shit from
back then but like said gotten exposed

1186
00:48:47,631 --> 00:48:50,900
now like these teachers,
like these teachers I knew ran a fucking

1187
00:48:50,901 --> 00:48:54,710
prostitution ring
came out in the paper.

1188
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,750
The teachers did.
Teachers did the shop.

1189
00:48:56,751 --> 00:48:58,730
The old shop teacher,
his daughter,

1190
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,290
the shop.
The shop teacher has pivot.

1191
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:04,520
Dude,
that's insane.

1192
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,800
Who the girls,
the girls were high school students?

1193
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,210
No,
not high school students.

1194
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,020
They were fucking just like girls in the
community probably grows.

1195
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:13,550
I went to high school and graduated,
but all the girls said they were pimping

1196
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:16,700
out from the school.
They were pimping from school.

1197
00:49:16,701 --> 00:49:19,400
What school was this?
This is out in the suburbs of Chicago.

1198
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,500
Wow.
Here's the question.

1199
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:25,280
If they did make prostitution legal,
it's set up just like you go get a

1200
00:49:25,281 --> 00:49:26,840
massage,
you can go off sex with somebody.

1201
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:28,610
Yeah.
How much would that change?

1202
00:49:28,611 --> 00:49:31,790
Like the notion of marriage
relationship.

1203
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,720
Nobody's getting married.

1204
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,250
It's over.
It's over.

1205
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,450
It's all only a law that's keeping like
what percentage of people married,

1206
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,280
I mean you,
you said it before when we were,

1207
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:45,810
when we,
when we touched on this prior,

1208
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,320
the reason that we make it okays cause
the church gets involved,

1209
00:49:49,321 --> 00:49:50,790
right?
So if the church says it's okay,

1210
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,590
it's like my dad was a drug addict grown
up,

1211
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,840
my dad was,
was in and out of prison my whole life

1212
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,750
when I was a kid and my mother divorced
my father when I was one.

1213
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:59,640
So I don't really have any recollection
of any of that.

1214
00:49:59,641 --> 00:50:01,080
So I don't have that like damage that
people,

1215
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,240
like my dad got divorced when we were 16
I didn't see it.

1216
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:06,780
I didn't know it.
But my mom came from such a hardcore

1217
00:50:06,781 --> 00:50:11,781
Irish Catholic world that my family,
the older generation didn't approve and

1218
00:50:13,801 --> 00:50:16,050
was like,
you can't divorce this man that's

1219
00:50:16,051 --> 00:50:18,720
against our religion.
And my mom was like,

1220
00:50:18,721 --> 00:50:23,010
he's a fucking terrible person to me.
I have to get out of this relationship.

1221
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,900
And now she was just,
they were both young,

1222
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,400
you know,
she just wanted to make the right move

1223
00:50:26,401 --> 00:50:27,290
for,
for a baby.

1224
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:27,980
But the

1225
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,300
church has so much influence on certain
parts of society that my grandmother was

1226
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:34,880
like almost disowning,
like,

1227
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,370
eh,
but that's such a reality for that

1228
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,380
generation that it was like,
how could you,

1229
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,680
what do you mean divorce?
I mean that's like you're,

1230
00:50:42,681 --> 00:50:43,514
you're,
you're,

1231
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,900
you're going to hell.
Like that's it.

1232
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,400
You're done.
So my mom had that kind of fuck up in

1233
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:52,460
her brain of like that.
And that's how much influence the church

1234
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:55,130
has over marriage and coupling.
And it's crazy.

1235
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,520
It's fucking crazy.
It's unbelievably ridiculous that people

1236
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:00,320
succumb to that.
It's so crazy.

1237
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,790
It's controlling man.
Well,

1238
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:03,650
the,
the Catholic church in particular is one

1239
00:51:03,651 --> 00:51:05,890
of the weirdest ones ever.
I'll show strangest,

1240
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,490
this insanely high percentage of people
that are involved in child abuse.

1241
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,610
I mean,
what other religion has that connected

1242
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:18,611
to it like that there's none.
What a Muslim is the biggest in the

1243
00:51:18,891 --> 00:51:19,724
world,
right?

1244
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:21,320
The biggest religion in the world,
right?

1245
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,640
I think it is.
It's not Christianity.

1246
00:51:23,641 --> 00:51:24,171
Yeah.
Start there.

1247
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:26,120
Probably Toto.
Either way.

1248
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,000
You don't hear about that.
So are they covering up shit?

1249
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,900
It's not the same thing.
The thing about the priests and the

1250
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:37,901
priests being forced to be celibate and
then spending time with boys like that

1251
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,220
shit has always gone bad.
Yeah.

1252
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,150
Forcing guys to be celibate,
bad forcing guys to hang out with boys

1253
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,050
back.
Awful.

1254
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:46,670
Someone.
Something is weird.

1255
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,040
Weird Shit's going to happen if there's
no parents in the room,

1256
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:49,581
dude,
when it,

1257
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:51,290
when as soon as you deprive someone of
something,

1258
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,290
they are going to have it.
They want it immediately.

1259
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:56,990
Then you attach to it.
The ultimate power that comes from being

1260
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:58,910
a representative of God.
Yeah.

1261
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,180
Like you're wearing a priest outfit to a
little kid.

1262
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:03,560
Like that kid will suck your Dick.

1263
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,570
He'll do anything you say.
Does he know what's going on?

1264
00:52:05,571 --> 00:52:07,670
He's a baby.
Oh,

1265
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,320
it's freezing.
So dark,

1266
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:09,850
deep,
deep,

1267
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:10,820
dark,
dark control.

1268
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,700
And when you find out how many of them,
yeah,

1269
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:17,190
that's the thing is it's not just one.
It's not just 10 I could,

1270
00:52:17,191 --> 00:52:19,340
the more you hear,
the more you're like to,

1271
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,100
this is not a fucking accident.
These are coincidences.

1272
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:25,880
This isn't like a,
a conspiracy that this is a fact that

1273
00:52:25,881 --> 00:52:29,780
this is rampant and it's crazy.
It's crazy because it's still happening

1274
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:30,490
now.
They don't talk about,

1275
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:30,801
yeah,
it's no.

1276
00:52:30,801 --> 00:52:31,634
It's like it's,
you know.

1277
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,260
Well,
how about that benedict guy?

1278
00:52:33,261 --> 00:52:37,010
The pope that had to resign,
they found out that he had been involved

1279
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:40,880
in the moving of these child molesters
from one place to another place,

1280
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:42,740
keeping them clean,
clothes the story down,

1281
00:52:42,741 --> 00:52:45,380
shut everybody up and then move that guy
to another place.

1282
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,980
And one of the guys went on to Molesta
hundred deaf kids.

1283
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,430
Yeah.
He get molested,

1284
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:56,780
a hundred deaf kids.
And he was put into that position by

1285
00:52:56,781 --> 00:53:00,410
this guy who wound up being the pope.
A hundred deaf hundred deaf kids.

1286
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:01,244
Yeah,
it was.

1287
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,660
It's horrible.
Fucking awful.

1288
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:05,180
It's hard.
There's so much involved in it.

1289
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,370
There's so many people that covered shit
up.

1290
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:09,620
There's so many different versions of
these stories.

1291
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:12,710
So many stories.
Thousands and thousands of stories that

1292
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:14,330
people are molested by priests.
Yeah.

1293
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,950
I mean,
it's crazy.

1294
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:20,060
And if you bring it up immediately,
you get people defending it now.

1295
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:20,781
Now,
now look,

1296
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:21,950
you're exaggerate.
I Blah,

1297
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:22,401
blah,
blah,

1298
00:53:22,401 --> 00:53:24,330
blah.
Like I've said this before.

1299
00:53:24,331 --> 00:53:28,110
It can imaginative nascar drivers.
Fuck that many kids.

1300
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,900
It'd be shut down.
You shut the fuck down.

1301
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,580
But because it's the church,
we're like,

1302
00:53:32,581 --> 00:53:33,360
well let's,
uh,

1303
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,140
you know,
but there's good things to their working

1304
00:53:35,141 --> 00:53:35,974
for God.

1305
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,390
Okay?
It's crazy that any organization can

1306
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:41,670
have a history of fucking kids were
working for God.

1307
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,680
It's God's side job,
fucking children,

1308
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:45,840
because that's not whatever it is.
It's not working.

1309
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,550
But we forgive them.
We will.

1310
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:50,190
It's not all bad.
We don't want to break the whole thing

1311
00:53:50,191 --> 00:53:51,750
up.
Definitely don't want to do that.

1312
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:54,480
No,
stealing is not that fucking a kid is

1313
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:59,481
the same as like some minor bullshit
infraction and society and thousands,

1314
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,490
thousands of cases,
maybe even millions of cases.

1315
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:06,060
It's and then still do you have these
world leaders like trump met with the

1316
00:54:06,061 --> 00:54:07,620
pope.
The pope was all bummed out.

1317
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,870
Trump should be like,
I'm bummed out to be next to you,

1318
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,200
motherfucker.
You represent you mad at me cause I'm

1319
00:54:13,201 --> 00:54:15,690
pulling out of the climate accord.
What about all the kid fucking,

1320
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,700
Bro,
you should bring up the kid fucking,

1321
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,110
he's been fucking kids.

1322
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:19,981
That's it.
Oh,

1323
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:21,060
that's right.
You do a good trump.

1324
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:23,520
Have you seen the pictures of trump with
the pope?

1325
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:28,140
The pope's totally disenchanted rail
bumped to pope should relax.

1326
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:31,020
He should slow as fucking role.
You're a part of a giant kid fucking

1327
00:54:31,021 --> 00:54:31,660
ring.
Yeah.

1328
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,630
Who Do you think you are?
Right?

1329
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,790
You're getting cocky because the
billionaire guy who tricked American

1330
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:38,370
devoting forum is uncomfortable.
Do you know what the best,

1331
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,170
you know what the Ma,
the thing that bothers me the most is

1332
00:54:40,171 --> 00:54:43,050
the church is all about fucking to
community and the people and they don't

1333
00:54:43,051 --> 00:54:45,540
pay taxes on all this great real estate.
They own tons of it.

1334
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,480
How come they can't house homeless
people or sick people in those churches

1335
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:50,340
all day long while they're there?
That's free property.

1336
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,480
Yeah.
I don't understand.

1337
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:52,180
There it is.
Yeah,

1338
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:55,500
it's fucking believe I got this trumps
like my hair looks good.

1339
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:59,580
Good hair day or good hair day.
Puppy like my hair.

1340
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,170
Touch it.
Thrill.

1341
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,470
I got a gun that the guy that I used
went to Tony and guy the hairstylist

1342
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:07,620
school.
The color of his hair is like the color

1343
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:12,030
of every retired Florida Golfer in his
70 [inaudible] so gross.

1344
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:15,540
He's got this weird blonde,
grey thing going on.

1345
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:20,430
It's like he moves it around a little,
like some days it's like a darker Brown

1346
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,230
Sundays.
It's like a blog on gray.

1347
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,790
It looks,
it's just like sand.

1348
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,400
He's getting it worked on.
It's what I'm saying like this is not

1349
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:29,370
the color of the hair.
Now what you do one or two things.

1350
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,640
Let me be clear about this.
Either you work on your hair or you

1351
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:34,110
don't work on your hair.
Okay,

1352
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:37,890
so either you die your fucking hair or
you don't dye your hair.

1353
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,420
It's one of those two things.

1354
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,120
How fucking when you dye your hair be
consistent.

1355
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:46,590
You can't go gray and then be blonde
again and it'd be dark haired.

1356
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,980
It's too confusing to me.
I need to know what kind of a person to

1357
00:55:49,981 --> 00:55:51,990
you,
like how much you working on your hair,

1358
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:56,490
what's your level of haircare,
how much time you spending putting that

1359
00:55:56,491 --> 00:55:57,780
together every day?
It does.

1360
00:55:57,781 --> 00:55:58,890
Did Donald Trump changes?
Eric?

1361
00:55:58,891 --> 00:56:00,350
Of course.
It was just fucking obvious and of

1362
00:56:00,351 --> 00:56:02,250
course he did.
He's changed his hair color.

1363
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,860
It goes.
He's moving it around as his hair is

1364
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,590
probably very great at this point.
He's in his seventies there's nothing

1365
00:56:07,591 --> 00:56:09,120
wrong with that.
What did you think about all this,

1366
00:56:09,121 --> 00:56:10,080
Kathy Griffin?
Shit.

1367
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:11,940
She's ridiculous.
It's fucking insane.

1368
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:14,040
She needs friends.
Why are you doing that?

1369
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,020
It's just,
it's a hundred percent attention.

1370
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:16,830
Attention,
man.

1371
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:20,610
What a bullshit call for attaching edgy.
She thought she was being edgy and she

1372
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:24,130
probably was talking with the wrong
people and got the wrong in her head and

1373
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,860
went with it and had no one like you
around and go,

1374
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:30,850
what the fuck are you talking about?
If that's the president.

1375
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,260
Right,
and it's a person.

1376
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:32,950
Yeah,
to human.

1377
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:33,551
Yeah.
You can't,

1378
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:35,620
you can't pretend you want to murder
him.

1379
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:38,710
Isis style on the hold his head up to
the camera like a hostage video.

1380
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:39,850
That's fucking crazy.

1381
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,700
I think it's just,
it's,

1382
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,630
it's one of those things where both both
parties,

1383
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:50,690
both extreme left and extreme right,
are at such a heightened version of

1384
00:56:50,761 --> 00:56:55,650
what's happening that people are
becoming blind to like logic.

1385
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,200
Yes.
I 100% right.

1386
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,500
Logic is like it's gone.
Yeah.

1387
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:04,230
You would fucking never,
if somebody did that with Obama,

1388
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:06,840
a holy shit.
Oh my God.

1389
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,880
I mean the fucking world would stop
spinning.

1390
00:57:08,881 --> 00:57:12,060
There'd be so much chaos from that.
It would be fucking,

1391
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,570
it w it would be an insane thing to see
that happen.

1392
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:16,920
Well,
look,

1393
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:20,930
it's just,
that's not any one solution.

1394
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,560
Like that's not a real sort of like
holding up that head is not a real

1395
00:57:24,561 --> 00:57:26,520
solution like killing anybody like that.
Okay.

1396
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:29,180
And not only that,
even if it's like the worst person in

1397
00:57:29,181 --> 00:57:31,520
the world cutting their head off and
holding it up like that,

1398
00:57:31,521 --> 00:57:35,300
it's fucking barbaric.
We wouldn't even want that from Osama

1399
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,380
bin Ladin.
If we found the,

1400
00:57:36,381 --> 00:57:40,250
the video of Osama bin Ladin and one of
the seals held him down and cut his head

1401
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:43,010
off and then held it up to the camera,
we'd be fucking extremely like,

1402
00:57:43,011 --> 00:57:44,570
what are we doing?
Why don't you just kill him,

1403
00:57:44,571 --> 00:57:45,650
kill him.
Like we're not them.

1404
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,230
We're not torturing them.
We're not trying to terrorize all these

1405
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,450
other people.
We are not going to become what we're

1406
00:57:50,451 --> 00:57:51,320
afraid of.
Right.

1407
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,000
Right.
And B,

1408
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,990
that's what she's doing.
By holding that head up,

1409
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,270
you are becoming what you were afraid
of.

1410
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:58,530
Your becoming a monster.
You're yours,

1411
00:57:58,531 --> 00:58:01,010
your tread face.
You're not even emotionally attached.

1412
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,140
The fact that you're holding up this
bloody head.

1413
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:04,940
No.
Like what kind of nonsense?

1414
00:58:04,941 --> 00:58:07,970
False imagery is this?
Like you don't really think that.

1415
00:58:07,971 --> 00:58:09,410
You don't really feel that.
Is it art?

1416
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,580
Like what is it?
Is it art?

1417
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,610
That's what the,
I'm sure that's what the argument from

1418
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:15,320
from Bruce Sake was.
It's an artistic piece where the with

1419
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,640
the,
with a photographer who's,

1420
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,270
but it's about a real person that's not
Medusa.

1421
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:22,810
You decide like a dragon's head you're
holding up if it's just crazy.

1422
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,220
Right?

1423
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,430
Is he here?
If it's your own head,

1424
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,800
it's your own head.
You can make a funny statement trying to

1425
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:27,634
make a statement.
Sure.

1426
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,620
But it's like what are you doing?
You're terrorizing that person if you're

1427
00:58:30,621 --> 00:58:32,700
that you have,
I know everybody thinks that the

1428
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:37,000
president has to assume a certain amount
of mockery and I agree that he does.

1429
00:58:37,001 --> 00:58:37,850
Sure.
I agree.

1430
00:58:37,851 --> 00:58:40,010
Everybody in any position of power like
that is going to,

1431
00:58:40,011 --> 00:58:41,460
you're going to have people coming at
you of course.

1432
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:46,760
But there's a difference between that
and advocating a brutal assassination

1433
00:58:46,761 --> 00:58:51,050
and terror video that's head removal.
That's just,

1434
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:51,920
yeah,
it's not,

1435
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,530
that's not,
no one's going to be sympathetic towards

1436
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,920
your idea and in fact you're going to
empower the people that are opposed to

1437
00:58:57,921 --> 00:58:59,570
you cause they're gonna Think,
oh,

1438
00:58:59,571 --> 00:59:04,490
these people are these crazy ideologues
who want to like literally promote the

1439
00:59:04,491 --> 00:59:07,550
murderer and torture of someone cutting
their head off.

1440
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,540
The whole thing is crazy,
but it's just,

1441
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,300
it's still something that people do
where they're trying to get attention

1442
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,790
and they're trying to entertain or
trying to be shocking that just,

1443
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,920
it's [inaudible].
It's a continuation of,

1444
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,300
of uh,
trying to be in people's,

1445
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:24,890
uh,
frontal lobe.

1446
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:26,540
You know,
it's like people in Hollywood at some

1447
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:30,980
point just want to stay in Hollywood and
I feel like that's what she,

1448
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,510
she does a lot.
I want to stay,

1449
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:35,840
I want to do something controversial on
the fucking New Year's eve hosts that

1450
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:38,360
she does or whatever so she can stay in
Hollywood.

1451
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:41,240
It's such this great,
this great director once told me that

1452
00:59:41,241 --> 00:59:43,630
the sat is never that.
Imagine if this is a,

1453
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,230
if this is an actor and and uh,
as if we're the sun and the sun and the

1454
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:50,330
earth and moving,
moving around one another.

1455
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:54,410
Just like an actor in a spotlight.
It says if the spotlight has is on the

1456
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:56,570
actor at some point,
but when it moves away,

1457
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:59,570
if he actually tried to move towards it
is when it becomes sad.

1458
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,880
When,
when it shifted out of your line of

1459
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:02,630
sight,
when,

1460
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:06,860
when your work and your progress has
shifted as if your time perhaps maybe

1461
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,760
coming to a close as far as it's worth
when you are continuing to search for

1462
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,320
it,
there's nothing more desperate and more

1463
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:13,280
obvious.
He's like,

1464
01:00:13,281 --> 01:00:17,090
you can always see when someone's
hunting for it again,

1465
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,890
it looks sad.
It looks,

1466
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:20,413
it looks desperate.

1467
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,260
It's also contrary to the very reason
people like you in the first place.

1468
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:27,640
Like people like you because you're
doing things they enjoy exact,

1469
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,700
doing good work.
You're doing good comedy,

1470
01:00:29,701 --> 01:00:31,340
you make it a good movie.
Whatever the fuck you do,

1471
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:33,230
making a good song.
That's why they like you.

1472
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:37,460
They don't want to like you because
you're trying to get attention or that

1473
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:40,730
you're trying to get people to,
to just,

1474
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:41,901
well,
I mean,

1475
01:00:41,901 --> 01:00:42,770
what is that?
I mean,

1476
01:00:42,771 --> 01:00:43,460
what,
what,

1477
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:47,210
what do you get out of holding ahead?
Like what kind of attention do you get?

1478
01:00:47,211 --> 01:00:50,180
Like what did she say?
Go girl.

1479
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:50,601
Like,
yeah,

1480
01:00:50,601 --> 01:00:53,080
we're with you fucking him.
Kill him.

1481
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,940
Like you're,
there's people that do things like that

1482
01:00:55,941 --> 01:00:58,220
and they could have easily been right
there,

1483
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:00,080
might be left.
They could have easily been,

1484
01:01:00,081 --> 01:01:00,920
right.
It's a,

1485
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:04,760
it's a way of thinking and you get that
way of thinking and then you program

1486
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,280
yourself,
you get locked into this predetermined

1487
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:08,210
pattern of behavior.

1488
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:12,890
Like all right wing people,
like a giant percentage of them have

1489
01:01:12,891 --> 01:01:15,260
like an established series of,
uh,

1490
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,990
of,
of opinions about certain things that we

1491
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:20,180
count on because they're the right,
right.

1492
01:01:20,181 --> 01:01:23,120
Like,
like abortion or even it used to be gay

1493
01:01:23,121 --> 01:01:25,580
marriage was one of them.
There's always a bunch of them that are

1494
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:30,110
just climate change is one of them.
Like it's like halfway there,

1495
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,020
like maybe 25% of them hardcore on the
right.

1496
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:35,870
Where's the left?
Climate change is almost 100% accepted

1497
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:37,790
without it.
Without question.

1498
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,290
It's weird.
I counted these,

1499
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:44,270
these ideas become right or left ideas
who logged them into the database of

1500
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:46,850
which side do they belong on?
It's talking points.

1501
01:01:46,851 --> 01:01:49,010
People on Fox News started talking about
it.

1502
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,770
People agree with it.
They liked convenient things.

1503
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:52,730
That's,
it's a cycle.

1504
01:01:52,731 --> 01:01:53,590
It comes,
goes,

1505
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,490
don't worry about it,
but we need is jobs.

1506
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,220
And then they run with that and it's a
tall,

1507
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:01,310
it's this,
this predetermined pattern that people

1508
01:02:01,311 --> 01:02:02,840
just love to fall into.
Man.

1509
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,170
It's weird.

1510
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:06,900
It's creepy.
That should no longer be separation of

1511
01:02:06,901 --> 01:02:09,270
just permanent party.
It shouldn't be.

1512
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:11,780
You're always left an always right.
That's so fucked up.

1513
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:14,570
Too Vulnerable.
I feel it myself.

1514
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:17,690
I feel myself.
The urge to be a part of groups.

1515
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,140
I do it all the time.
We all do.

1516
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,033
We all do.
Right?

1517
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:20,700
It,
that's uh,

1518
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,400
that's,
that's,

1519
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,530
that is nature and habit,
right?

1520
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:25,870
You,
everyone wants to belong to a community.

1521
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:28,690
That's why fraternities exist.
That's why when you join a gym,

1522
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:31,030
you start to eat in the moment you join
a gym.

1523
01:02:31,031 --> 01:02:32,740
You start to see people repetitively
that you know,

1524
01:02:32,741 --> 01:02:33,910
and you,
it starts off with a,

1525
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:34,510
Hey,
what's that?

1526
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:36,010
That guy you see all the time.
Then it's,

1527
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,350
hey man,
I've out it.

1528
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,940
Oh yeah.
And then it becomes a relationship you

1529
01:02:39,941 --> 01:02:41,710
create because it's communal because,
oh,

1530
01:02:41,711 --> 01:02:43,480
we both do this thing.
We both enjoy ICU.

1531
01:02:43,481 --> 01:02:46,000
Often we do this thing,
we create tribes.

1532
01:02:46,001 --> 01:02:48,880
We Love Haciendas.
We like to be a part of our little

1533
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:52,530
tribe.
And when it gets infiltrated it you,

1534
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,810
you become vulnerable.
You feel like you're,

1535
01:02:54,811 --> 01:02:57,150
the walls are weakening.
It's almost like when the word

1536
01:02:57,151 --> 01:03:02,151
gentrification,
gentrification really just means a tr,

1537
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,210
uh,
tribes area has been compromised.

1538
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,070
You know,
it's like this has been this for so

1539
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:10,680
long.
When white people or people of privilege

1540
01:03:10,681 --> 01:03:15,300
or money move into anywhere,
they're trying to overtake that tribe.

1541
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:19,320
That's why there's so much backlash.
That's why people fucking get so angry

1542
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:21,390
about neighborhoods turning over quote
unquote,

1543
01:03:21,391 --> 01:03:23,100
cause they're like,
what can be ours?

1544
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:24,960
That's,
it's such a fucking delicate thing

1545
01:03:24,961 --> 01:03:27,360
because you're like,
you can't stop that.

1546
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:28,590
You're never going to stop that.

1547
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,260
Well not only that,
it's there's a game being played in your

1548
01:03:33,261 --> 01:03:35,150
part of it because you're paying rent.
Yup.

1549
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:37,490
And there's a game being played.
Your part of it,

1550
01:03:37,491 --> 01:03:39,830
when you're working,
you're getting paid for your time during

1551
01:03:39,831 --> 01:03:41,030
the,
I know you have to decide what you're

1552
01:03:41,031 --> 01:03:45,590
going to do with that time and you might
feel very stuck in this game that you're

1553
01:03:45,591 --> 01:03:48,980
at right now where you paying this guy
for rent and you're working for that guy

1554
01:03:48,981 --> 01:03:51,650
and he's giving you a certain amount of
money and it all kind of evens out at

1555
01:03:51,651 --> 01:03:52,850
the end.
There's nothing leftover,

1556
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,430
but you're still playing a game.
This guy's playing the game too,

1557
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,580
but he's been playing it for 35 years
and his games,

1558
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:58,760
I buy houses,
right?

1559
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:02,360
And I sell them to white people and a,
I'm going to keep playing that fucking

1560
01:04:02,361 --> 01:04:05,090
game cause this is all legal and this is
why you pay me rent.

1561
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:06,230
Stupid.
It's a fucking,

1562
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,060
we know the game,
but the game is,

1563
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:10,520
I'm 30 years ahead of the game than you
and you know,

1564
01:04:10,521 --> 01:04:13,700
I'm a 70 year old guy with a fucking
pocket protector filled with pens and

1565
01:04:13,701 --> 01:04:17,120
I've got a bunch of apartment buildings
all over the place and I flipped those

1566
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:19,430
fuckers.
There's a lot of those guys out there

1567
01:04:19,431 --> 01:04:23,060
like why this gentrification thing?
I know it's uncomfortable with people.

1568
01:04:23,061 --> 01:04:24,650
They like,
we're losing the old neighborhood.

1569
01:04:24,651 --> 01:04:28,580
Like let's go back to the fucking tps.
Let's go back to the cave.

1570
01:04:28,581 --> 01:04:30,170
We lost the old caves,
man.

1571
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:32,480
We're,
we're not saying what she moved to other

1572
01:04:32,481 --> 01:04:33,500
case.
It's going to happen.

1573
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,300
They just shift.
Things change.

1574
01:04:35,301 --> 01:04:37,460
You can't hold them back.
You can't decide.

1575
01:04:37,461 --> 01:04:38,690
No,
we want this neighborhood to stay

1576
01:04:38,691 --> 01:04:39,650
shitty.
You know?

1577
01:04:39,651 --> 01:04:41,660
Or we want this neighborhood to be all
Puerto Rican.

1578
01:04:41,661 --> 01:04:43,700
Well listen,
sometimes it doesn't work that way.

1579
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:47,390
Some people die and New People move in.
Do you really care of Swedish people

1580
01:04:47,391 --> 01:04:48,890
move in your neighborhood?
You know,

1581
01:04:48,891 --> 01:04:50,510
we're losing chinatown.
What do we do?

1582
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:54,360
I you going to be okay.
Is it okay if they live here or people

1583
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:56,270
that there's going to be changed,
it's going to come and go.

1584
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:59,020
You can't control it and you can't
control it based on this stall.

1585
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:02,200
Gia,
this is always been East Harlem's fat

1586
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,850
finest show.
Slovaki place.

1587
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,130
We have to keep it like,
no we don't.

1588
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,480
No,
no one has to do anything.

1589
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,700
I do love East Harlem Harlem's famous
Lavaca place.

1590
01:05:10,701 --> 01:05:12,530
I will say to know what that is not even
a thing.

1591
01:05:12,531 --> 01:05:14,990
I'm searching for a word,
but it was like that.

1592
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:18,220
And that happens like when,
when restaurants and people get furious.

1593
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:19,690
Yeah.
So it doesn't have to fucking keep the

1594
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:20,860
restaurant open.
Stupid.

1595
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,580
I was just up in the change up in
Seattle and these guys,

1596
01:05:23,581 --> 01:05:25,380
a,
these Costa Rican guys I started talking

1597
01:05:25,381 --> 01:05:27,750
to at the,
at the Fremont brewery were telling me

1598
01:05:27,751 --> 01:05:30,570
about this great Caribbean food place up
the street.

1599
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:32,070
And I said,
uh,

1600
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,020
what makes it so great?
And he's like,

1601
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,980
you know,
it's just the recipe because a,

1602
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,460
the guy that used to own it was this
great,

1603
01:05:38,461 --> 01:05:41,810
this Cuban guy,
he's just brilliant chef and he key,

1604
01:05:41,811 --> 01:05:44,490
uh,
got sued for illegal wage wage

1605
01:05:44,491 --> 01:05:47,010
garnishing these illegal employees that
couldn't speak English.

1606
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:49,110
She had sued to the city,
shut them the fuck down.

1607
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:52,020
Some other fucking white rich guy came
in,

1608
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,200
bought the recipes from the guy,
took to help him out with his lawsuit,

1609
01:05:55,900 --> 01:06:00,240
still runs just as good.
I like it can be done if someone does it

1610
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:02,670
correctly.
He bought the recipes.

1611
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:03,670
He was like,
Eh,

1612
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,880
the mistake,
I think when people buy a bar or buy a

1613
01:06:05,881 --> 01:06:07,320
place,
they think they're buying the place.

1614
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:08,341
Now.
There's more,

1615
01:06:08,341 --> 01:06:10,620
there's more than just the brick and
mortar.

1616
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,520
There's more to it than that.
So he knew the food success was because

1617
01:06:14,521 --> 01:06:15,630
of this guy,
the way he did it,

1618
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:18,090
but you can't just like,
it's not just a Cuban restaurant or a

1619
01:06:18,091 --> 01:06:19,590
Caribbean restaurant.
He was like,

1620
01:06:19,591 --> 01:06:23,160
I want to do it exactly how you did it.
So he paid for him to give him those

1621
01:06:23,161 --> 01:06:26,530
recipes so he could just the recipe just
to show him how he was cooking and she

1622
01:06:26,531 --> 01:06:28,290
would cook that.
He paid him for the recipes,

1623
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:31,710
not to know the rest of the details,
but that is to get it back to where it

1624
01:06:31,711 --> 01:06:34,410
was and this dude from Costa Rica was
like still the same.

1625
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:35,820
I fucking love it.
Wow.

1626
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,620
He was just a couple of white guys that
are back there now.

1627
01:06:37,621 --> 01:06:38,340
He's the same food.

1628
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:40,440
It doesn't,
doesn't mean that I don't appreciate

1629
01:06:40,441 --> 01:06:43,110
people that live in these neighborhoods
that are being forced out and you'd have

1630
01:06:43,111 --> 01:06:45,660
to get a new place to live and you can't
afford it.

1631
01:06:45,661 --> 01:06:47,520
You can't afford to live in the
neighborhood anymore because people are

1632
01:06:47,521 --> 01:06:49,230
buying it up.
I get it.

1633
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:52,830
I understand that it sucks,
but ultimately it's probably good for

1634
01:06:52,831 --> 01:06:54,570
everybody.
It's definitely good for the

1635
01:06:54,571 --> 01:06:56,190
neighborhood.
The neighborhood's going to get like

1636
01:06:56,191 --> 01:06:58,290
these nice houses now and people are
going to move in.

1637
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:00,270
They're going to have that.
It's going to be more value.

1638
01:07:00,271 --> 01:07:03,780
If you did buy a place,
if you did take the risk and bought a

1639
01:07:03,781 --> 01:07:05,250
place,
that place can be worth more money.

1640
01:07:05,251 --> 01:07:07,530
Now I know maybe you couldn't buy a
place.

1641
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,041
I go,
well,

1642
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:09,570
it's hard to buy a place when I get
paid.

1643
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,610
I get it,
but you don't have to do that,

1644
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:11,910
right.

1645
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:13,650
I know.
You feel like you have to do that and

1646
01:07:13,651 --> 01:07:17,040
they can come up with a bunch of excuses
and everybody would argue all day long

1647
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:20,040
about white privilege and you're lucky
and this and that,

1648
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:22,530
but the bottom line is you're not in a
cage.

1649
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:24,390
All right?
If you're not in a cage and you're out

1650
01:07:24,391 --> 01:07:26,580
there doing something,
you could figure out a way.

1651
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:29,040
Maybe it's a month from now,
maybe it's six months from now to

1652
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:32,010
transition into something else.
Figure your way through the maze.

1653
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:33,900
Right.
We don't all start at the same spot in

1654
01:07:33,901 --> 01:07:34,734
the maze.
Nope.

1655
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:35,603
Agreed.
Could it,

1656
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:38,640
but don't ever complain about your spot
in the maze.

1657
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:40,680
Just figure,
figure your way through that thing.

1658
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:41,580
Right?
You're in the mace.

1659
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:42,413
Yeah.
It sucks.

1660
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:44,250
Definitely hard.
Not Easy.

1661
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,510
Keep moving.
Keep moving.

1662
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:48,120
Don't jam.
This up with your tears.

1663
01:07:48,121 --> 01:07:48,954
You Fuck,

1664
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:49,863
keep moving.

1665
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,980
You don't understand capitalism and
that's why I'm a socialist and okay,

1666
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,430
just keep moving though.
You don't,

1667
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,530
you know,
just talking too much and not move in

1668
01:07:58,531 --> 01:07:59,540
and I'll do it.
Yeah.

1669
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:02,090
There's not enough happening here that's
complaining about other things

1670
01:08:02,091 --> 01:08:03,380
happening.
I get it.

1671
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:04,790
I get it.
It's not good.

1672
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:08,090
The climate change agreement is a
terrible thing to leave.

1673
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:12,150
It's a bad thing to leave.
His own daughter told them not to leave,

1674
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,760
but I never liked [inaudible] so we got
to get out of Paris.

1675
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:19,250
She did it.
She has owned his own daughter was like,

1676
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:21,080
this is a bad idea.
This guy's crazy.

1677
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,160
He didn't want he and science.
He is perfectly out of his fucking mind.

1678
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:28,670
He's going against science.
The scientists are saying,

1679
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:32,240
Hey,
we've got to reduce emissions 100% we're

1680
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:33,980
polluting the air.
We breathe.

1681
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:38,210
We're ruining the very air that we need
to exist on.

1682
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,130
Yup.
Now that true,

1683
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:41,770
don't agree.
We bike.

1684
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:44,420
We bought new air.
There's show by Jay.

1685
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,860
Have you ever seen a chair?
There is.

1686
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:48,210
Maybe he's doing this because he's about
to move.

1687
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:53,270
Move into position to use one of those
gigantic building sized air filter

1688
01:08:53,271 --> 01:08:54,830
things.
Maybe it's going to have a trump air

1689
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:57,170
filter filters.
Set them up in every city.

1690
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:01,340
You could all go back and buy diesel
trucks and no one's going to care

1691
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:02,510
anymore.
We're going to clean that air.

1692
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:04,280
Nice.
It's kind of like idiocracy do you ever

1693
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:07,290
see that movie I ever saw that movie,
Dude.

1694
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,750
It was that kind of thing where the
future is like,

1695
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,700
they don't drink water anymore.
They be convinced by this,

1696
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:12,950
this like gatorade type drink where it's
like,

1697
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:16,400
this is better than water and people
like it's gotta be so everyone fucking

1698
01:09:16,401 --> 01:09:18,170
drinks it.
The big sense.

1699
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,050
I feel like it's better than water.
If you can convince enough people what

1700
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:22,700
it is,
people will get on board.

1701
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:25,520
Regard blind faith.
I'm trying to talk about that on stage

1702
01:09:25,521 --> 01:09:27,800
right now about blind.
We have so much blind faith.

1703
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:30,170
Like I had a fucking,
I would at the gas station to get this

1704
01:09:30,171 --> 01:09:31,460
thing.
I had a Brownie.

1705
01:09:31,461 --> 01:09:32,294
It was like,
uh,

1706
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:33,410
uh,
pow,

1707
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,540
you know,
protein packed Brownie or whatever.

1708
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:37,100
I just trusted it.
That's all real.

1709
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,750
I don't fucking know what the next is.

1710
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:41,210
Probably just a bullshit ass Brownie,
but it's packed with protein.

1711
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,250
Yeah.
If you actually got the real statistics

1712
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:44,061
on it,
it's probably,

1713
01:09:44,061 --> 01:09:44,721
gosh,
yeah,

1714
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:45,740
there it is.
Craved.

1715
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,560
It's got electrolytes.
It's who's brilliant and it's crazy.

1716
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,170
What was the name of the stuff?
What was it called?

1717
01:09:51,171 --> 01:09:53,480
Does it say what it was called?
The g the juice.

1718
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:54,830
It was like,
but it looked like gatorade.

1719
01:09:54,831 --> 01:09:55,280
It was like,
oh,

1720
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,930
they were watering their plants with it
and shit.

1721
01:09:56,931 --> 01:10:00,890
Nothing was alive anymore.
But out of the sink would come this

1722
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:04,460
fucking gatorade type looking drink.
[inaudible] that's right.

1723
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,670
Bronto thirst.
Muda lunar.

1724
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,770
That's hilarious.
I need to watch that movie.

1725
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:14,240
Click on that picture,
uh,

1726
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:17,900
to the up just all the way over down at
the left.

1727
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:19,580
That one.
Yeah.

1728
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:21,500
Look at that.
That's what the world has become.

1729
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,570
That makes sense.
You see the size of that Costco.

1730
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,110
That's hilarious.
That could happen.

1731
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,990
Totally.
That's all totally possible.

1732
01:10:29,991 --> 01:10:31,400
Have you been watching this handmaid's
tale?

1733
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,713
No.
What does that,

1734
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,020
no,
have you know about this,

1735
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:37,450
it on Hulu man was a book written.
Um,

1736
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:40,160
I want to say 20 years ago,
uh,

1737
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:43,430
it's Elizabeth Moss is the star of it.
It's essentially about,

1738
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,160
um,
if world war three broke out and we

1739
01:10:46,161 --> 01:10:49,040
became like an ultimate police state and
there was like a sub government that

1740
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:52,430
took over and we went back to
essentially biblical times when women

1741
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,880
who were fertile were used for the rich
as handmaids for making babies.

1742
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,391
Whoa,
dude.

1743
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:02,030
It's fucking trippiest shit.
Whoa.

1744
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,290
You got to watch it,
bro.

1745
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,090
You will.
It's based on modern time.

1746
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:07,640
Yes.
It takes place in modern time as if

1747
01:11:07,641 --> 01:11:09,410
world war three broke out.
I don't want to give you too many

1748
01:11:09,411 --> 01:11:10,960
details,
but then two,

1749
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:12,770
we're under a police state.
So these handmaids,

1750
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:14,130
these fertile women who are of

1751
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,430
lower socioeconomic status,
they must wear these things and abide by

1752
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:19,710
their masters,
which are the wealthy one percenters of

1753
01:11:19,711 --> 01:11:22,590
the world who own these fertile women
because their wives are infertile.

1754
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:25,620
So they must repopulate this new
community.

1755
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,150
Whoa,
dude.

1756
01:11:27,151 --> 01:11:31,320
It's fucking right up your alley.
It's insanely good.

1757
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:34,860
But it was a book that was written.
That's a total possibility.

1758
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:35,611
Well,
that's what I do.

1759
01:11:35,611 --> 01:11:36,840
It's getting so much love.
In fact,

1760
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:39,780
some of the parallels in the show of
what's going on in society now and some

1761
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:42,360
of the commentary cause this was shot
prior to the election.

1762
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:45,660
It's so specific.
I mean that's why people are falling in

1763
01:11:45,661 --> 01:11:48,030
love with it because they're like this
is creepily real.

1764
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:49,980
Like it's almost,
you know,

1765
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:52,980
I think with what,
especially from a for,

1766
01:11:52,981 --> 01:11:54,840
for what I've heard from women's
perspective,

1767
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:59,870
you know like taking the fear of women's
rights being removed as far as things

1768
01:12:00,421 --> 01:12:02,490
like planned parenthood or,
or what have you,

1769
01:12:02,491 --> 01:12:06,780
the choices of your own fucking body.
I think there's so much echoed in the

1770
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:11,781
show that it feels creepily real where
it's like you could one day just go like

1771
01:12:12,271 --> 01:12:14,250
they do in one of the scenes without
giving anything away.

1772
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:16,140
It's like all the women are fired today.

1773
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:21,500
Well you know that I ran of today is
nothing like I ran of like the 1960s no.

1774
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:25,230
Have you ever seen like the difference
between I ran then and now?

1775
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:30,250
No they became when I think when it was,
when the shop took no,

1776
01:12:30,331 --> 01:12:33,270
when the ayatollah took over.
Cause the ayatollah was a religious

1777
01:12:33,271 --> 01:12:37,470
figure and he took over and the change
of the country,

1778
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:39,240
I'm,
I'm terrible with Iranian history.

1779
01:12:39,241 --> 01:12:41,250
So if you listen to this and you're
upset that I'm getting it wrong,

1780
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:45,480
Iranians would fucking piss essentially.
They used to dress like much more free.

1781
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:46,950
Yeah,
look at it is like much more

1782
01:12:46,951 --> 01:12:47,784
Westernized.

1783
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:49,640
It's like the seventies in the seventies
yeah.

1784
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:50,820
Looked like seventies the United States.

1785
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:53,900
I mean,
and then shit changed.

1786
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:57,650
And now if you go there today,
I mean look,

1787
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:02,680
the Middle East is with a shiny example
of what is possible in 2017 as far as

1788
01:13:03,591 --> 01:13:05,600
like suppression.
Her shirt is there.

1789
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:08,420
Ah,
you're dead if you'd wear that.

1790
01:13:08,421 --> 01:13:11,750
No big old titties.
It's chocolate.

1791
01:13:11,751 --> 01:13:12,584
Chocolate.
Chocolate.

1792
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,290
Yeah,
but you ended up yet,

1793
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,740
right.
She'd be fucking slain for now.

1794
01:13:15,741 --> 01:13:18,740
They have to cover their head.
I mean they have like religious scarf

1795
01:13:18,741 --> 01:13:23,540
laws and you know what's really crazy is
there better than like Saudi Arabia.

1796
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:27,830
I mean,
Saudi Arabia's what you can and can't do

1797
01:13:27,831 --> 01:13:29,090
today.
I mean,

1798
01:13:29,091 --> 01:13:32,090
you're essentially like a second class
citizen if you're a woman below.

1799
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,220
I don't think there's they allowed to
drive now.

1800
01:13:34,221 --> 01:13:36,240
They changed that.
I mean there's,

1801
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:38,060
I know there's some people that are
trying to change that.

1802
01:13:38,061 --> 01:13:40,250
There's some people that are progressive
over there that are trying to change

1803
01:13:40,251 --> 01:13:40,620
that.

1804
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,800
They're straight property man.
That's what that they view him as a

1805
01:13:42,801 --> 01:13:45,230
straight numbers.
The idea that you have to keep your head

1806
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:46,870
covered,
you have to wear the those,

1807
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:50,960
those robes and the garb and and then
this women that are trying to say that

1808
01:13:50,961 --> 01:13:53,750
that's a source of empowerment.
There's a bunch of crazy people out

1809
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:58,010
there just like there was always uncle
Tom's like during the civil rights

1810
01:13:58,011 --> 01:14:01,220
movement and just like people are just,
there's always going to be like black

1811
01:14:01,221 --> 01:14:05,090
guys for trump.
Zoe's contrary is always there's going

1812
01:14:05,091 --> 01:14:07,220
to be women that said that the wearing
the,

1813
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:08,330
how do you say it?
His job,

1814
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,790
he jogged by three job.
That's a,

1815
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:13,360
it's for women to fuck it is you have to
wear it.

1816
01:14:13,361 --> 01:14:14,390
It's a religious symbol of

1817
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:15,370
depression.
How could you,

1818
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,290
how could you,
I understand being born into something

1819
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:19,080
and not knowing any other way.
I do understand that.

1820
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:19,923
Like I get it too,
right?

1821
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:22,690
But at the same time,
or born into and being convinced that

1822
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:27,670
this is the way that it should be.
But when you see freedom of the world,

1823
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,640
when you see the freedom of the world
that we're all born fucking naked and

1824
01:14:30,641 --> 01:14:35,230
free to be these things.
I don't know why there isn't a little

1825
01:14:35,231 --> 01:14:39,310
bit more of a click that goes,
why did these women and other places

1826
01:14:39,311 --> 01:14:43,210
have more freedom?
Because w because the goal of any sort

1827
01:14:43,211 --> 01:14:46,240
of religious fucking constriction is
questioning,

1828
01:14:46,241 --> 01:14:47,620
right?
So if you question it,

1829
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,160
you're automatically fucked.
But if you question it enough where you

1830
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:53,980
research and you look and you find out
and you learn,

1831
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:58,180
I would assume you would become
enchanted with the idea of being free,

1832
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:02,860
of just wanting to not have someone
fucking tell you where you can walk,

1833
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:03,694
what you can do.

1834
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:08,060
That makes sense.
But when you connect an ideology with,

1835
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,820
with God and with the idea of the divine
right,

1836
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,180
that's the ultimate,
that's the reason to stick around.

1837
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:16,760
Like the end of the day,
it's clothes.

1838
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,880
Clothes are made by people.
If you're telling me that God is saying

1839
01:15:19,881 --> 01:15:23,090
that you have to wear some kind of
clothes and not other kinds of clothes.

1840
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,680
I'm calling bullshit.
Yeah.

1841
01:15:24,681 --> 01:15:26,750
Who's the people?
You're not talking to God.

1842
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:28,610
He's never talked to you and told you to
wear that.

1843
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:31,610
This is crazy.
And when you have an ideology where

1844
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:35,330
you're trapped into dressing a certain
way or wearing certain clothes or

1845
01:15:35,331 --> 01:15:39,380
wearing a certain emblem or some sort of
assemble your trapped by the mind of a

1846
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:41,660
human being,
that is the mine of a human being.

1847
01:15:41,661 --> 01:15:45,890
They've created a pattern that they want
you to not deviate from whatsoever.

1848
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:47,570
I want you to walk around like this.

1849
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:50,420
We're going to cover this and you're
gonna wear these and maybe have one of

1850
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:53,840
those on your neck and maybe a certain
amount of beads that symbolizes your,

1851
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:55,970
you're single.
You're not bullshit.

1852
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,890
This is somebody,
this is by a person.

1853
01:15:57,891 --> 01:16:01,440
This is some cult shit to guy and 100%
has nothing to do with God like you.

1854
01:16:01,441 --> 01:16:05,330
You would be serving God more to be free
and naked like that.

1855
01:16:05,331 --> 01:16:07,010
God created you.
If God is real,

1856
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:10,640
he didn't make clothes.
God doesn't have any stock and Levi's.

1857
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:13,400
God's not making burgers.
God,

1858
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,950
we'd like you to be naked if they're,
if that's real,

1859
01:16:15,951 --> 01:16:19,790
if God just lets or wear whatever the
fuck you want because it's all there for

1860
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:22,170
humans to where like if people are
making clothes,

1861
01:16:22,171 --> 01:16:24,410
they're making clothes for people,
they should be able to wear whatever the

1862
01:16:24,411 --> 01:16:25,550
fuck they want.
If I was God,

1863
01:16:25,551 --> 01:16:25,851
I would say,
yeah,

1864
01:16:25,851 --> 01:16:26,330
that makes sense.

1865
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:28,550
Where would we like stay warm?
You know,

1866
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,140
don't,
don't die I guess.

1867
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,820
Yeah.
I think the only reason I'm just going

1868
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:34,910
to cover your hair,
why this is nonsense.

1869
01:16:34,911 --> 01:16:38,280
This is people talk and someone said
that a person said it.

1870
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,280
We believe in it.
Well the priest must trust like a

1871
01:16:40,281 --> 01:16:41,114
wizard.
Why?

1872
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:44,210
Why does he have to dress like that?
No one dresses like the pope anymore.

1873
01:16:44,211 --> 01:16:46,010
Why is the pope dress like the pope?
Shit.

1874
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:49,430
The fucking get the suit off.
Someone loved wizardry so much.

1875
01:16:49,431 --> 01:16:51,120
They were like,
I gotta we gotta fucking keep that and

1876
01:16:51,121 --> 01:16:54,140
we got to keep somebody in that.
I always think that when I was a kid and

1877
01:16:54,141 --> 01:16:55,160
I'd have to go to church,
I'm like,

1878
01:16:55,161 --> 01:16:57,020
why does he have to wear that stupid
fucking collar?

1879
01:16:57,470 --> 01:16:59,990
So selvans so silly to me?
What does that collar,

1880
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,060
he has to wear that collar,
so I know that he's real.

1881
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,050
And the one,
oh,

1882
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,820
he's got the thing on.
He's got the preschooler.

1883
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:06,570
Look at that.
Ooh,

1884
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,390
that pope,
he's got wings like,

1885
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:10,170
look,
he's in a a window,

1886
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:13,340
an MTV video in the 80s what does that,
that once,

1887
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:15,740
but that one sponsored by red bull.
Is that blowing in the wind?

1888
01:17:15,741 --> 01:17:17,390
Is that what it is?
That's the answer.

1889
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:19,070
My friend,
that's his wing and the wind is blowing

1890
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:20,840
in the wind.
Catholicism was one of the,

1891
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:24,620
and this is what I was raised in,
sort of a wizard wizard hat show.

1892
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:26,540
Just for you look above my,
my favorite.

1893
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:31,520
That is so funny.
And why is that any more outrageous than

1894
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:32,970
that fucking thing?
Yeah.

1895
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:37,070
That's even more weird.
Look at that giant crucifix.

1896
01:17:37,071 --> 01:17:39,190
Look at this fucking hat.
Oh my God,

1897
01:17:39,191 --> 01:17:41,480
they're so silly.
They're the silliest people.

1898
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,250
The fact that anybody says,
yeah,

1899
01:17:43,251 --> 01:17:43,940
yeah,
yeah,

1900
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:45,740
that guy.
Keep that picture up there.

1901
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,580
Don't change the that clothes.
Go full screen with that.

1902
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:53,590
What in the fuck are we looking at here?
This guy's got a three foot tall hat on.

1903
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:58,670
It's all gold and studied in ornate like
wouldn't you think that God want you to

1904
01:17:58,671 --> 01:18:01,040
be humble?
If you're a servant of God,

1905
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:02,660
he really supposed to be covered in
gold.

1906
01:18:02,661 --> 01:18:04,380
Gold is gold.
Fucking pimp rang.

1907
01:18:04,381 --> 01:18:08,210
Guy Represent God with my nugget ring
because that nugget,

1908
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,420
kiss it.
This is a Persian rug draped around his

1909
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:15,200
shoulders,
his fucking this elaborate work on that

1910
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,440
robe thing that he's got on.
It's so preposterous.

1911
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:21,110
The idea that God would want you to
dress like that.

1912
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:24,410
You know what I always think of when I
see like big elaborate things like this

1913
01:18:24,411 --> 01:18:27,350
is at the end of the day he's got to
like take that off to take a shit and

1914
01:18:27,351 --> 01:18:30,890
it's like so sad to like take that off
and drape it on the ground.

1915
01:18:30,891 --> 01:18:31,790
You know what I mean?
When he's sitting there,

1916
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:35,440
backs it on his lower back,
like wipe,

1917
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:37,610
did a terrible job of cleaning up.

1918
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:40,190
So the,
the bottom of it has a little shit stain

1919
01:18:40,191 --> 01:18:42,200
on it,
but he's still the pope,

1920
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:45,650
so he's bringing it up to the sink and
he's trying to wash it in the sink and

1921
01:18:45,651 --> 01:18:49,700
it's just sort of walk wet.
Brown is trying to get that little shit

1922
01:18:49,701 --> 01:18:52,350
streak out of the bottom of this thing.
We call him the pope,

1923
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:55,730
but don't say that.
Respectful to my beliefs.

1924
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,320
Your disrespect.
Yes.

1925
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:01,070
If this is what you believe,
I believe this guy is the fucking guy

1926
01:19:01,071 --> 01:19:02,780
who's talking for God.
Come on,

1927
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:04,460
man.
I'm not saying there's no god.

1928
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,950
What I'm saying,
we have to be very wary of people.

1929
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:11,060
They're just people and cults and people
and the patterns of thinking and

1930
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:13,280
behaving that they want you to engage
in.

1931
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:15,550
This is what we're looking at here.
This,

1932
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:18,230
there's two people holding this guy's
fucking coat.

1933
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:21,590
These two guys who are dressed like gay
matadors,

1934
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:26,800
like giant Golden crusted gay matadors
and they're holding on to his cape.

1935
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:30,260
They're fighting the devil and they're
walking with him as he walks around with

1936
01:19:30,261 --> 01:19:33,800
his giant staff of magic.
He's got a wizard's wand.

1937
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:37,970
It's a Goddamn Gandalf wand.
He's dressed like a wizard and he's got

1938
01:19:37,971 --> 01:19:40,760
a staff like,
why isn't that glowing?

1939
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:43,920
Why isn't there a lightening bolt going
from that up until the storm cloud that

1940
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:46,460
it looks like the level of Cape bitches
way above the other guys.

1941
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:49,100
Like that's a graduation for them to be
Cape Pitch is real big.

1942
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:52,490
That's a big deal.
Cape Bitch is a huge position in these

1943
01:19:52,491 --> 01:19:55,410
guys is to Cape pitches the guy and the
left's probably that annoying.

1944
01:19:55,411 --> 01:19:57,440
It's fuck.
I bet he tells a lot of long stories.

1945
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,730
Probably guessed the pope alone.
He's like,

1946
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:01,880
you know,
just wanted to tell you about my cousin.

1947
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:03,050
And uh,
his,

1948
01:20:03,051 --> 01:20:05,570
uh,
that is a safe in the Lord and you know,

1949
01:20:05,571 --> 01:20:07,770
I think right now he's not getting to
Guba.

1950
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,680
Is this the first pope that's okay with
gay marriage?

1951
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:12,000
Isn't that what he said?
Yeah,

1952
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:15,240
he's got to say this is the first one
that was like whatever he tossed out to

1953
01:20:15,241 --> 01:20:16,740
thrown too.
He's got a normal chair.

1954
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,150
Does he?
Yes.

1955
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,680
That's kind of cool.
It is kind of cool,

1956
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:22,320
but I think that was probably a joint
effort.

1957
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:25,190
They like look as a pc move,
it was a politically fucking car.

1958
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,450
Doors behind me.
There's a thousand kids back there

1959
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:28,530
waiting to suck your Dick.
Okay,

1960
01:20:28,531 --> 01:20:32,400
we've got to make this right though.
We've got damage.

1961
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:34,470
We're still gonna do plenty of kid
fucking,

1962
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:37,380
one of you saw the pope,
a throughway of chair and got one of

1963
01:20:37,381 --> 01:20:39,030
those like uh,
the medicine balls to sit on.

1964
01:20:39,031 --> 01:20:39,870
You know what I mean?
Like he started,

1965
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:42,360
he started really getting,
he had standing desks and shit.

1966
01:20:42,361 --> 01:20:43,800
He started getting like corporate
America.

1967
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:45,110
What is the,
what do you show me here,

1968
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:47,400
Jamie?
Is it the pope won't be all the new one.

1969
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:49,620
The popemobile,
the new one doesn't have bulletproof

1970
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:51,750
glass anymore.
The last pope was like,

1971
01:20:51,751 --> 01:20:53,770
I know they want to kill me.
I'm hiding liquor.

1972
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:56,430
They don't even need glasses all the way
up because his back arches silver so

1973
01:20:56,431 --> 01:20:57,930
much.
He doesn't sit up straight so they don't

1974
01:20:57,931 --> 01:20:59,850
need high glass.
It's like a child window.

1975
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:04,320
I wonder if that is different colors of
glass because I would imagine you want

1976
01:21:04,321 --> 01:21:06,660
to keep the head shots from coming down
from the roof.

1977
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,680
Totally.
I mean,

1978
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:11,220
if someone's going to shoot that dude,
but this guy doesn't even thinking he

1979
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:13,470
was going to shoot him and he's like,
if someone wants to shoot me,

1980
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:14,900
they'll fucking shoot.
Man.

1981
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,200
It's done.
Yeah,

1982
01:21:16,201 --> 01:21:17,250
he's,
he's exposed.

1983
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:18,590
Is it a Benz?
It's a Benz.

1984
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:20,030
Oha.
God.

1985
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:22,560
Oh,
he said he left Mercedes more baby.

1986
01:21:22,561 --> 01:21:26,140
Jesus loves the G Wagon Kid.
Like the other old one's a Benz to

1987
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:30,240
little light proof one.
I bequeath my son a Mercedes Benz boy.

1988
01:21:30,241 --> 01:21:33,960
There's nothing that says faith like
driving around in a bulletproof fish

1989
01:21:33,961 --> 01:21:35,850
tank.
Right?

1990
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:38,730
I mean that just shows you,
you really have a belief that God has a

1991
01:21:38,731 --> 01:21:40,380
plan,
can run flat,

1992
01:21:40,381 --> 01:21:43,530
half inch thick steel plate,
lightweight Kevlar Armor,

1993
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:46,080
God,
three inch composite plastic glass that

1994
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:48,600
was spoke with an explosive Jesus
Christ.

1995
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:51,510
It's five tons.
That's 10,000 pound truck.

1996
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,700
That's crazy.
15 miles a gallon.

1997
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:56,910
That's very efficient.
And that is really here to 66 seconds.

1998
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:58,050
What sets quick,
dude,

1999
01:21:58,110 --> 01:21:59,730
wait a minute.
How's that even possible?

2000
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,580
That's bullshit.
And get that fucking thing on top gear.

2001
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:07,140
Run a stop sign of Stopwatch with that.
That's no way that gets zero to 60 in

2002
01:22:07,141 --> 01:22:08,790
six seconds.
Going to rice.

2003
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:13,320
The pope mobile first is the king of
Saudi Arabia is mobile.

2004
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:15,600
That's hilarious.
Dude.

2005
01:22:15,601 --> 01:22:19,170
You sound like the guy from,
I'm not top gear.

2006
01:22:19,171 --> 01:22:21,250
It's like fifth gear or something like
that.

2007
01:22:21,251 --> 01:22:21,810
Yeah,
yeah.

2008
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:22,960
Got It.
Yeah.

2009
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:25,440
What's the other one?
That's who I thought you sound just like

2010
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:27,510
that's creepy.
The Pope Mobile.

2011
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,400
It's something I like about British car.
Uh,

2012
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:34,800
analysts.
Oh dude meet so much once they take the

2013
01:22:34,801 --> 01:22:37,290
piss out of everything.
I like how self deprecating there when

2014
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:38,730
they shit on cars.
It's my favorite.

2015
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,940
Jeremy Clarkson's the best cause it's
hilarious the way he shits on things.

2016
01:22:41,941 --> 01:22:45,750
There's so much fun and I just like to
see fucking friends dump on each other.

2017
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:46,740
On TV.
Yeah.

2018
01:22:46,741 --> 01:22:48,600
It's fun to watch people dump on each
other.

2019
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,170
Well,
especially in this day and age.

2020
01:22:50,171 --> 01:22:53,520
So that would be considered bullying.
Bullying their friend.

2021
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:55,320
That's really rude to pick on him like
that.

2022
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:57,440
Yeah.
They just go after each other constant.

2023
01:22:57,441 --> 01:22:59,260
It's fun show.
I probably,

2024
01:22:59,261 --> 01:23:01,280
they have a beer afterwards.
It's fine.

2025
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:05,110
It's fucking fine to stay playing
characters like James May would be

2026
01:23:05,111 --> 01:23:06,130
captain slow.

2027
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,023
Yeah.
Yeah.

2028
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:13,000
I love that shit.
They fucked up when they canceled that

2029
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:15,220
show.
Jeremy Clarkson punched some producer

2030
01:23:15,221 --> 01:23:17,620
and they cancel the show and fired them
if they knocked out a tooth or

2031
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:18,890
assumption like that.
Well,

2032
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:20,620
he's drunk.
It's what happens.

2033
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:22,380
You want to hang out in a big crazy
drunk dude.

2034
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,430
You want to talk shit,
Talk Shit,

2035
01:23:24,431 --> 01:23:27,550
Talk Shit.
Get hit that you guys are all drinking.

2036
01:23:27,551 --> 01:23:29,650
That's how it goes down.
You guys at a bar fight,

2037
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:34,420
six of the most normal thing happened
and he apologized afterwards and the

2038
01:23:34,421 --> 01:23:37,750
other guy accepted it.
It was just they fucked up and then why

2039
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:40,110
can't that be the end of it?
I don't know man.

2040
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:43,900
They have a new one they're doing now
and Matt Leblanc from friends is on it

2041
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:45,700
now.
You see a big car guy?

2042
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:46,630
Yes.
Oh Wow.

2043
01:23:46,631 --> 01:23:48,150
He's a giant car guy and he's a knight.

2044
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,590
He's a nice guy and I don't know
anything about him,

2045
01:23:50,591 --> 01:23:52,540
but I didn't know that it comes off like
a good car guy.

2046
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:55,690
It's not that he's bad,
it's just that God Damn Jeremy,

2047
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:00,840
Jeremy Clarkson is a fucking icon.
He's a maniac icon,

2048
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:05,350
but Matt Leblanc is a,
is he a car collector?

2049
01:24:05,351 --> 01:24:07,630
Does he have is he loves cars.
I don't know to what extent,

2050
01:24:07,631 --> 01:24:09,760
but he definitely loves cars.
He knows how to drive to,

2051
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,480
he drives on the show like he's driving
a porsche nine 11 are he can rip it.

2052
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:14,740
He knows what he's doing.
That's good.

2053
01:24:14,741 --> 01:24:15,940
Yeah,
he can drive.

2054
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,830
It's so,
so he must have some experience,

2055
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:22,780
some real track time experience,
but the Guy Chris Harris who's on it,

2056
01:24:22,781 --> 01:24:25,570
he's been on the podcast for that guys,
he's my favorite.

2057
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:30,010
He's all the guys out there that are
reviewing cars now and he knows so much

2058
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:30,520
about them.

2059
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:34,200
Like he really understands like the,
the geometry and the physics behind it.

2060
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:37,000
Like with the suspension,
they can tell you what they've changed,

2061
01:24:37,001 --> 01:24:40,120
what they've improved,
would it feels like and what's being

2062
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:42,730
lost in this.
That's always impressive to me.

2063
01:24:42,731 --> 01:24:45,130
To have a bevy of knowledge like that.
My Dad's worked in the automotive

2064
01:24:45,131 --> 01:24:46,930
aftermarket industry for,
so my Stepdad,

2065
01:24:47,010 --> 01:24:49,210
he was my dad.
But what does he do dude?

2066
01:24:49,211 --> 01:24:50,830
For years and years,
he worked for,

2067
01:24:50,831 --> 01:24:53,570
uh,
the ever famous turtle wax carwash.

2068
01:24:53,571 --> 01:24:55,930
He was the president of sales for turtle
wax to sell,

2069
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:57,580
towed away.
And then now he the standard,

2070
01:24:57,581 --> 01:24:59,610
the gold standard and now he works.
Uh,

2071
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:01,570
but the turtle fired him.
The shell fired him.

2072
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,740
Fuck,
fuck them.

2073
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:04,720
And then he works for this company
called Haynes,

2074
01:25:04,721 --> 01:25:07,750
who's out of la out of Britain.
And they,

2075
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:12,190
they are one of the last remaining
companies that makes zero,

2076
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:14,830
uh,
a to z manuals on hand building

2077
01:25:14,831 --> 01:25:15,664
vehicles.

2078
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:17,770
Wow.
So if you want to hand build kit cars or

2079
01:25:17,771 --> 01:25:19,930
you want to literally build a car from
fucking scratch,

2080
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,900
most of their sales go to like
mechanics,

2081
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:25,210
auto body shops,
but they're also,

2082
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:30,240
they own the rights to fictional,
how do I say this?

2083
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:33,050
The only rights of fictional mechanics,
uh,

2084
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:36,970
fictional mechanisms that in our film
world or real like the fucking

2085
01:25:36,971 --> 01:25:40,150
Millennium Falcon,
they own the rights to how to build a

2086
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:41,530
Millennium Falcon from scratch.
Whoa.

2087
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,560
And they sell that manual.
That's a real fucking manual.

2088
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:46,270
You can buy net fucking crazy.
That is crazy.

2089
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:49,780
They had that for a bunch of cars.
Kit cars are pretty wild to kick arse.

2090
01:25:49,781 --> 01:25:52,510
I was always fascinated with my buddy's
dad used to build mgs all the time and

2091
01:25:52,511 --> 01:25:53,350
let us fuck around.
And um,

2092
01:25:53,351 --> 01:25:56,460
and I was fascinated with mgs cause he,
he loved him.

2093
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:01,600
I mean he was just dope English kit car
that was for sale really recently.

2094
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:03,860
And you would do it,
buy it

2095
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,430
and then once you got it over here,
then you had to put an engine in it.

2096
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:08,360
Yeah.
Dude,

2097
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,040
sell it to you with no engine.
Right.

2098
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:11,780
You've got to bite you.
Will you build a first and they drop it

2099
01:26:11,781 --> 01:26:12,680
in there.
Jumped into,

2100
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:14,390
but it wasn't that,
it was different.

2101
01:26:14,391 --> 01:26:16,070
It was,
it wasn't a total kit car.

2102
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:18,860
Like you start from scratch,
you attach the suspension.

2103
01:26:18,861 --> 01:26:20,120
You're right.
It wasn't that.

2104
01:26:20,121 --> 01:26:22,010
It was like they would sell it to you as
a,

2105
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:25,940
as a car with no engine and then you
would have to put the engine in.

2106
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:27,690
It's a dope.
That's a current,

2107
01:26:27,691 --> 01:26:29,510
the name.
It's like it's right there,

2108
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:31,590
but there's so many,
so many blocks I could,

2109
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:34,640
there's only so many blocks I could fit
in that framework.

2110
01:26:34,641 --> 01:26:35,001
Right?
Yeah.

2111
01:26:35,001 --> 01:26:36,410
Yeah.
You would get like a parameter and you

2112
01:26:36,411 --> 01:26:40,160
know like a v eight ls one or something
like that and try to put it in there.

2113
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:41,300
God Damn it.
Noble,

2114
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,620
Noble.
That's what it's called.

2115
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:46,820
It's called the noble.
It's a dope look and Carmen and guys,

2116
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:48,470
I think they're just,
you know,

2117
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:50,750
you don't want to have a certain amount
of horsepower could take,

2118
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:52,670
but I didn't think,
I don't think he'd have the drive train

2119
01:26:52,671 --> 01:26:53,870
either.
I think he had to have the ad,

2120
01:26:53,871 --> 01:26:56,810
the drive train as well.
I think essentially it was just a frame

2121
01:26:56,811 --> 01:27:01,100
and the doors and all that shit.
It must've just been parts from other

2122
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:06,460
third party car manufacturers and they,
they got whatever parts they could it

2123
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:09,230
put them together.
You built that and then the engine is

2124
01:27:09,231 --> 01:27:12,830
what from anywhere at all?
I think you'd have to just know how to

2125
01:27:12,831 --> 01:27:15,230
do it.
I mean there's a whole market now or

2126
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:19,640
they buy engines and then they put him
in older cars so they'll buy like,

2127
01:27:19,641 --> 01:27:21,920
uh,
one of the big companies that does it as

2128
01:27:21,921 --> 01:27:23,210
a company called icon.

2129
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:25,490
And um,
uh,

2130
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:28,220
what they do is they take,
uh,

2131
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:28,790
like,
uh,

2132
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:33,790
69 bronco and they strip it down.
They put the car back together again

2133
01:27:34,221 --> 01:27:39,180
with a modern suspension and then they
take a 2017 Ford Mustang engine and

2134
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,570
enshrine the Bronco.
Yeah.

2135
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,240
So they put totally modern brakes,
totally modern suspension,

2136
01:27:44,241 --> 01:27:46,040
bronco engine.
What?

2137
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:47,290
But the Bronco Engines,
uh,

2138
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:48,440
19,
you know,

2139
01:27:48,441 --> 01:27:50,310
a 2017,
uh,

2140
01:27:50,350 --> 01:27:52,070
for,
for tea,

2141
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:54,740
it's called the coyote motor.
It's a really high end,

2142
01:27:54,741 --> 01:27:56,540
high tech motor.
It's a really nice motor.

2143
01:27:56,810 --> 01:28:00,110
So you have like this old school costs.
So they have like kits,

2144
01:28:00,111 --> 01:28:02,240
like they do that with ls one for
[inaudible].

2145
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:04,970
And maybe you and I talked about that
someone was saying that they were taking

2146
01:28:04,971 --> 01:28:07,880
classic methe Ford might have been doing
this themselves where they take classic

2147
01:28:07,881 --> 01:28:12,170
mustangs and put New Mustang engines in
old classic Mustang bodies.

2148
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,670
No,
we were talking about that.

2149
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:18,050
You and I were talking about that.
There's a guy who's got a page on

2150
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:21,290
instagram where he did it and it's,
I think it's a,

2151
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:26,291
I think it's called gt 500 super swap.
So he's got a somewhat,

2152
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:32,110
Ma had a shelby shelby gt 500 yeah,
from 2012 and he put that body of a 1969

2153
01:28:34,911 --> 01:28:38,840
car over the 2012 car.
Fuck.

2154
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:41,330
So it's the best of both worlds.
That's it right there.

2155
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,420
It is so beautiful.
It's so beautiful.

2156
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:46,520
Wow.
So this guy nailed it and,

2157
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:48,110
but he's only done one car.
What does,

2158
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,540
he was like doing it.
I thought there was a company that was

2159
01:28:50,541 --> 01:28:52,880
doing it,
but apparently it's just this one dude

2160
01:28:52,881 --> 01:28:54,350
who's done this.
What does that run for?

2161
01:28:54,351 --> 01:28:56,870
Did it say what he's selling those for?
I don't think he's selling it.

2162
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,160
No,
he just wants to fucking shit.

2163
01:28:58,210 --> 01:28:59,043
He just did his shit.

2164
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:03,420
He sell the fuck out of that thing.
You should sell the fuck out of that

2165
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:04,141
look.
That'd be what?

2166
01:29:04,141 --> 01:29:08,220
I had a 2012 gt 500 [inaudible] who was
a great car.

2167
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:10,410
That's another one though.
That's a different color.

2168
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:13,350
Oh,
it's different car for helping a

2169
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:14,240
friend's house.
Six eight Mustang.

2170
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:15,720
Three three K.
Ooh,

2171
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:19,560
that's a beautiful car.
33,000 miles is nothing.

2172
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:22,260
That is nothing.
That's a beautiful card.

2173
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:23,790
God,
those things were classic.

2174
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:27,720
Those 1960s mustangs are some of the
most beautiful shapes ever.

2175
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:33,020
And to take that and put a uh,
I think 2012 the GT 500 packed 550

2176
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:34,420
horsepower.
Yeah.

2177
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:38,010
Almost 600 isn't that crazy that this
won't be in the future,

2178
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:41,130
that like in the future,
like no one's going to have a lot of

2179
01:29:41,131 --> 01:29:43,440
these current cars now we're just going
to go by the wayside.

2180
01:29:43,441 --> 01:29:46,530
Like there's only so many cars that will
stick around as classics from the,

2181
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:49,260
you know,
early two thousands era.

2182
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:51,900
Yeah.
There's not going to be any like driving

2183
01:29:51,901 --> 01:29:53,340
yourself in a hundred years.
No,

2184
01:29:53,341 --> 01:29:56,580
it's over like that.
That idea is fucking dead.

2185
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:58,580
So we'll have that's a noble.
Yeah.

2186
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:00,930
Well that's it right there and not a
dope car cut out.

2187
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:04,170
It has a Ferrari body a little bit of
sort of like,

2188
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,540
like an old,
um,

2189
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:11,640
more like what is the car I'm thinking
of the [inaudible] used to look like

2190
01:30:11,641 --> 01:30:12,001
that.
Yeah,

2191
01:30:12,001 --> 01:30:14,310
the load as fast.
That's why like the loaded,

2192
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:15,960
the cool lotus is of like,
wow,

2193
01:30:15,961 --> 01:30:17,790
look at that.
Oh that's a newer one,

2194
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:18,601
Huh?
Wow.

2195
01:30:18,601 --> 01:30:21,300
That's tight.
That's a,

2196
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:23,850
that's a digital image.
We can't hear you.

2197
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:27,690
You know our website is pretty cool.
Where's it said Italy,

2198
01:30:27,691 --> 01:30:30,180
right?
Is that where they're out of British?

2199
01:30:30,181 --> 01:30:33,570
I think they don't have airbags or they
didn't have airbags.

2200
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,880
Yeah.
Cause if you go on one 80,

2201
01:30:34,881 --> 01:30:36,030
fuck that doesn't live there.

2202
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:38,460
Get an airbag to me and just looks like
a steering wheel.

2203
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:39,241
You Die.
You Die,

2204
01:30:39,241 --> 01:30:41,160
I guess.
Yeah,

2205
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,290
because think it's too complicated.
Yeah.

2206
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,270
Fuck it.
Fuck that airbag thing.

2207
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:49,890
I wouldn't,
I would want to find out like now that

2208
01:30:49,891 --> 01:30:52,630
looks like it might have one.
Actually I never an airbag nuts horn.

2209
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:53,550
That's a horn.
Yeah.

2210
01:30:53,551 --> 01:30:56,640
Fuck it.
I think that was the problem.

2211
01:30:56,850 --> 01:31:00,110
I think they hadn't gone through all of
the fcs.

2212
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:03,180
What is it?
What would be the,

2213
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:04,380
what is that,
the name of that now?

2214
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:06,330
I can't think.
The FAA not at the uh,

2215
01:31:06,990 --> 01:31:09,120
Ihsa safety mode.
Yeah.

2216
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:12,860
Ihsa yeah,
that's fucking really sexy looking.

2217
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,910
They're looking at all the carbon fiber
in there.

2218
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:16,680
God,
those seats look amazing.

2219
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:19,410
That he break is up,
but it doesn't look like it stick.

2220
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,780
That's just what you put your app in
your asshole.

2221
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:22,920
Oh,
that's where you get fucked.

2222
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:24,013
Oh,
when you,

2223
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:26,250
is there one of the front two,
can you suck one way?

2224
01:31:26,251 --> 01:31:28,060
You fuck.
You can't be greedy.

2225
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:35,570
That wouldn't be noble.
Look at the inside of that thing cause

2226
01:31:36,121 --> 01:31:38,670
he'd go back to that coffee.
So he does know that that's all push

2227
01:31:38,671 --> 01:31:40,860
button.
There is no fucking sticking on manual.

2228
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,960
No manual transmission.
That's what they're all using now.

2229
01:31:43,961 --> 01:31:46,030
When those exotic Italian cars and
everything,

2230
01:31:46,090 --> 01:31:47,880
everything is paddle shifts.
Now.

2231
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:49,350
We'll look at this.
Did you ever,

2232
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:50,250
do you see this?
I,

2233
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,030
I had this,
uh,

2234
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:52,440
this was for a thing.
Hold on,

2235
01:31:52,441 --> 01:31:55,620
let me show you.
I'm really bummed out the new NSX.

2236
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:56,730
Look at that fun thing.
Huh?

2237
01:31:56,910 --> 01:32:01,210
I rented that for the shoot that we were
doing all that's as the old magnum Pi

2238
01:32:01,210 --> 01:32:01,901
Ferrari man.
No,

2239
01:32:01,901 --> 01:32:05,800
that's a,
a couple years later it was three 55 Gt.

2240
01:32:05,801 --> 01:32:07,180
Right.
It's a similar design though.

2241
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:10,450
Jon Lovitz had one of those.
I drove that once.

2242
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:14,050
Dude.
John Level let me drive his car that

2243
01:32:14,051 --> 01:32:15,680
year of Ferrari.
Uh,

2244
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:16,631
or,
well,

2245
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:18,940
not just that year,
but I mean that was when Ferrari's,

2246
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,110
uh,
one was down,

2247
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:20,491
you know,
for our,

2248
01:32:20,491 --> 01:32:23,350
he's one is down instead of up reverses
up,

2249
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:24,460
but one is down two,
three,

2250
01:32:24,461 --> 01:32:25,060
four,
five.

2251
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:26,800
But that thing was so much fucking fun.
Look at that.

2252
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:28,361
Oh,
that's right.

2253
01:32:28,361 --> 01:32:30,970
I forgot that they had it backwards.
It goes backwards.

2254
01:32:30,971 --> 01:32:33,520
1995 was,
I think the year that Ferrari,

2255
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:35,620
somebody wrote Pontiac Fiero,
dope,

2256
01:32:35,621 --> 01:32:36,454
Pontiac,
fiero.

2257
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:40,240
But do you remember when they used to
have those kid cards go pontiac,

2258
01:32:40,241 --> 01:32:43,810
fiero and put like Ferrari bodies on the
outside,

2259
01:32:43,811 --> 01:32:45,560
like a fake Ferrari body?
Yeah,

2260
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:49,660
it's pretty great.
So much work.

2261
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,120
Somebody just showed me,
uh,

2262
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:54,760
I forgot about Lamborghini coon tosh and
it was like there something gear

2263
01:32:54,761 --> 01:32:56,590
anniversary.
And they just are rereleasing the coon

2264
01:32:56,591 --> 01:32:58,410
Tashas.
Do you remember those cars too?

2265
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:03,010
That was when I remember thinking that
that was the only car that I ever

2266
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:06,160
thought was worthy of any amount of
money that it was worth.

2267
01:33:06,161 --> 01:33:07,020
That was like,
that's the fun.

2268
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:10,060
Any dime that thing is fucking worth.
I went by that fucking thing.

2269
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:15,090
Do you remember he was such a low bar.
Rocky drove that car rocky for what he's

2270
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:19,103
done.

2271
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:24,460
And so he had like,
there's a crazy scene.

2272
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,900
Handsome basket was boxing shoes.
My boxing shoes.

2273
01:33:28,901 --> 01:33:31,510
A hilarious,
that's the coon tosh baby is beautiful

2274
01:33:31,511 --> 01:33:32,890
man back then.
Um,

2275
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:33,900
but there's a,
uh,

2276
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:37,930
like it's literally a music video where
they play,

2277
01:33:37,931 --> 01:33:41,560
where he's in the car and the music
starts playing when he's cruel.

2278
01:33:41,561 --> 01:33:44,170
He's driving.
It's so corny.

2279
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:45,280
So cheesy.
Yeah.

2280
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:48,700
Can we no easy way out and give you some
volume on this.

2281
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:55,660
People at home can hear this or no south
Paulino trouble plate was

2282
01:33:57,250 --> 01:34:01,480
so he's,
he's driving around and he's thinking of

2283
01:34:01,481 --> 01:34:04,210
Dolph lundgren kicking his ass while
he's driving a

2284
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:09,560
Lamborghini.
So Manchin,

2285
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:13,060
uh,
it's so silly.

2286
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,210
Oh Dude.
He's the fucking man.

2287
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,310
No smiles at all.
Not Happy.

2288
01:34:21,311 --> 01:34:22,640
Not excited about it.
Yeah,

2289
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:25,930
it took a deep breath.
I'll just call them.

2290
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,710
I'll just go to think about what my life
was going.

2291
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:34,300
The best part about it is to do this
movie or to do this fight.

2292
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:37,540
He had to go to old school methods and
move to the fucking woods and was

2293
01:34:37,541 --> 01:34:41,200
carrying logs around and running this
chopping down fucking trees.

2294
01:34:41,201 --> 01:34:43,030
Dude.
That's how you get in shape.

2295
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:43,841
Fucking name,
man.

2296
01:34:43,841 --> 01:34:44,770
Shit,
man.

2297
01:34:44,771 --> 01:34:49,771
Shit Woods.
Go out here chopped wood.

2298
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:58,040
I got to Chubb would then I'm going to
fuck you and then

2299
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,873
I'm gonna go whoop.

2300
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,990
Carry a log to this.
No.

2301
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:08,380
Shut this off for a die shit.
I can't do it anymore.

2302
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:10,400
Those movies are great though,
Dude.

2303
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:12,430
So fucking great.
Window into time.

2304
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:14,950
I know a return when it was okay to be
ridiculous.

2305
01:35:14,951 --> 01:35:16,230
And Helmet.
Yeah man.

2306
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:18,370
Now it's,
everything gets checked and balanced so

2307
01:35:18,371 --> 01:35:21,100
much that everything is like has to be
proven by the studio.

2308
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:22,750
Back then that was an idea.
He,

2309
01:35:22,751 --> 01:35:25,860
I'm sure he was like would a foam drug
when around thinking about the fight and

2310
01:35:25,870 --> 01:35:28,480
make a music video and they're like
great,

2311
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:30,610
we got an extra hundred grand at burn
this week.

2312
01:35:30,611 --> 01:35:31,444
Let's fucking do it.

2313
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,310
Dig.
We have a time lapse of all the shitty

2314
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:36,880
moments of my life.
All the things that worked didn't work

2315
01:35:36,881 --> 01:35:37,360
out.

2316
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:40,570
Can you go show a first time a family
member died?

2317
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:45,880
We'd go back to the first time I have
the Kista Adrian.

2318
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,171
Okay.
Yeah.

2319
01:35:47,171 --> 01:35:49,420
Rock.
We have some of our own scenes planned.

2320
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:53,260
[inaudible] that fuck.
I know my people

2321
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,340
he does though.
I mean he sneaked out action movies.

2322
01:35:57,341 --> 01:36:00,160
He's kicking people's asses and he's in
his seventies duty.

2323
01:36:00,161 --> 01:36:02,320
Can I tell you the one I did a fucking
benefit.

2324
01:36:02,321 --> 01:36:04,090
Uh,
I did like the standup at a better

2325
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:07,480
benefit for Tom Arnold for this thing.
This charity he runs and sly was there.

2326
01:36:07,481 --> 01:36:08,920
Cause there,
they've known each other for years.

2327
01:36:08,921 --> 01:36:10,390
And uh,
as I got off stage,

2328
01:36:10,391 --> 01:36:11,650
I walked past him and I didn't want to
like,

2329
01:36:12,010 --> 01:36:13,660
you know,
I didn't want to be like hey and fucking

2330
01:36:13,661 --> 01:36:15,610
call attention.
But as I walked by he goes very,

2331
01:36:15,611 --> 01:36:18,160
very good and I was like,
that's fucking awesome.

2332
01:36:18,161 --> 01:36:19,820
I was like,
that's enough for me.

2333
01:36:19,821 --> 01:36:21,070
He did very,
very good.

2334
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:24,990
I interviewed him once for the UFC.
There was some thing was going on.

2335
01:36:24,991 --> 01:36:26,700
He was,
some movie was coming out,

2336
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:28,260
I forget what movie it was,
but he wanted,

2337
01:36:28,270 --> 01:36:30,480
he was fun.
He was easy.

2338
01:36:30,481 --> 01:36:32,820
Does it take expendable is,
I don't remember.

2339
01:36:32,821 --> 01:36:34,220
I don't think it was,
he's the thing.

2340
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,600
It was another movie.
I forget what movie it was,

2341
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:39,930
but uh,
he was super like self deprecating and

2342
01:36:39,931 --> 01:36:42,900
easy to get along with.
That's how you stay fucking on earth.

2343
01:36:42,901 --> 01:36:45,870
Man said something about his mom that
someone yelled something out.

2344
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:47,580
Like someone like cackled them yelled,
somebody goes,

2345
01:36:47,581 --> 01:36:48,960
oh there's my mom.
She's up there

2346
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:54,450
like he's quick.
But he was like a genuinely nice guy.

2347
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,340
Like just friendly,
easy going.

2348
01:36:56,341 --> 01:36:58,500
Like one of the biggest movie stars in
the world in the world,

2349
01:36:58,530 --> 01:36:59,700
but like was like,
Hey,

2350
01:36:59,701 --> 01:37:00,540
what's up?
What's up?

2351
01:37:00,541 --> 01:37:01,890
How are you doing?
It was pretty cool.

2352
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:03,113
I liked it.
It was nice.

2353
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:06,120
Well that's what we were saying before
we jumped on at the level of,

2354
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:09,090
of what fame means to be an
international movie star now has changed

2355
01:37:09,091 --> 01:37:13,140
so much that like while I was in Japan
and I'm in Japan,

2356
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:15,960
I bring up my instagram cause these
young Japanese kids are wanting to like

2357
01:37:15,961 --> 01:37:20,580
see my social media and he sees the blue
check mark of the verified shit and he's

2358
01:37:20,581 --> 01:37:22,500
like famous,
famous and I'm like,

2359
01:37:22,501 --> 01:37:22,711
no,
no,

2360
01:37:22,711 --> 01:37:23,011
no,
no,

2361
01:37:23,011 --> 01:37:23,731
no,
no dude,

2362
01:37:23,731 --> 01:37:23,981
no,
no,

2363
01:37:23,981 --> 01:37:24,211
no,
no.

2364
01:37:24,211 --> 01:37:25,440
I was like,
and they give that to any fucking

2365
01:37:25,441 --> 01:37:27,660
asshole now.
And they're all like laughing cause

2366
01:37:27,661 --> 01:37:28,890
they're like,
well what,

2367
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:30,000
what do you do?
And I'm like,

2368
01:37:30,030 --> 01:37:31,050
ah,
comedian,

2369
01:37:31,170 --> 01:37:33,390
comedian.
And their faces were kind of like

2370
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:36,930
comedian and one guy goes,
will smith?

2371
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:38,150
And I go,
yeah,

2372
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:39,430
will smith.
That's exactly,

2373
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,890
that's exactly,
that's exactly right.

2374
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:43,053
But then you realize

2375
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:46,970
level of when you say what's famous
around the world,

2376
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,790
you're like slight when you say like who
was a famous,

2377
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I don't know if we have like I don't,
I don't know if the rest of the world

2378
01:37:53,001 --> 01:37:56,100
knows as many of our stars as they used
to.

2379
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:59,810
It used to be you are an international
star and that's what made you a mega

2380
01:37:59,811 --> 01:38:01,500
star.
Now it's Kinda like you can be famous

2381
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:05,790
here in film and not really be known at
all over there.

2382
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:07,740
I mean you could then,
but there was,

2383
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:10,530
so I feel like we were pumping out
international stars at one point.

2384
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,340
They were like,
uh,

2385
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:14,610
just a bevy of international action
stars.

2386
01:38:14,611 --> 01:38:17,790
You know what I mean?
That just became in that era of sorts

2387
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:21,030
and egg sly,
even like we were talking about John

2388
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:23,910
Claude van Damme before this Seagal,
like all these like Willis,

2389
01:38:23,911 --> 01:38:27,450
like all these mega international
superstars because the action movies

2390
01:38:27,451 --> 01:38:30,120
were so big.
Now we've put that into fantasy film.

2391
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:35,190
So now it's guardians of the galaxy.
Now it's any superhero movie that's

2392
01:38:35,191 --> 01:38:36,350
become it.
But I,

2393
01:38:36,351 --> 01:38:38,520
I miss the world of like,
why can't we have an action movie that

2394
01:38:38,521 --> 01:38:41,400
has isn't a comic book?
Where does that go?

2395
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:42,810
Yeah,
we would need,

2396
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:45,510
it would have to be like someone you
bill,

2397
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:47,470
you'd have to be the rock.
But that's not me.

2398
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:48,570
Like he could do it.
They can do it.

2399
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:49,800
But the why,
why doesn't it exist?

2400
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:51,330
Maybe people don't want those movies
anymore.

2401
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,260
Fuck,
why not?

2402
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:53,860
You have to have some sort of a metric
there.

2403
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:56,670
They're judging this from right?
Like when they're making these movies.

2404
01:38:57,210 --> 01:38:58,590
I think it's because they made a couple
of seconds

2405
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:01,300
near a movies.
I mean they made it a couple of comic

2406
01:39:01,450 --> 01:39:04,720
comic book films and they did so fucking
well that now we have a bevy of them

2407
01:39:04,721 --> 01:39:06,430
cause they know that there's such a big
market for it.

2408
01:39:06,590 --> 01:39:09,310
So I can't imagine you wouldn't want to
see another

2409
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:10,700
diehard type dudes.
Yeah.

2410
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:13,290
Why the fuck not?
Why haven't they done redone diehard?

2411
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:16,470
They did see they go,
yeah,

2412
01:39:16,471 --> 01:39:17,980
but don't read it.
They redo diehard.

2413
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,040
When did they didn't Redo it.
They just kept,

2414
01:39:20,041 --> 01:39:21,540
they're still doing it though.
It's,

2415
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:22,980
Oh,
it's being done right now.

2416
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:24,630
We're making another one,
right.

2417
01:39:24,631 --> 01:39:25,720
Who's,
who's the die hard?

2418
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:27,820
Bruce Willis.
Get the fuck out.

2419
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:32,780
Bruce Willis is not kept himself up.
It looks like you throw a punch and

2420
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:36,150
shoulder would blow out.
Fucking owl.

2421
01:39:36,590 --> 01:39:38,160
They're really hurt.
I mean,

2422
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:42,510
unless he's been working out since I
last checked in 2013 and then it says

2423
01:39:42,511 --> 01:39:43,640
future here.
Let's see.

2424
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,540
It's all,
they started it in 2013.

2425
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,600
That was the last one came out with,
did they try to do a TV show?

2426
01:39:48,601 --> 01:39:53,601
Is that what it was making another one
who was a die hard in 2013 with the

2427
01:39:55,051 --> 01:39:58,310
Justin Long I think was in it and his
daughter and

2428
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,090
I'd fucking net doesn't sound at all
familiar,

2429
01:40:03,150 --> 01:40:06,750
but if you had to tell me too,
and I'm a Bruce Willis Fan.

2430
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:08,330
I think Bruce Willis is awesome.
Shit.

2431
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,600
I load,
if you had to tell me like,

2432
01:40:09,601 --> 01:40:10,860
when was his last movie?
I'd be like,

2433
01:40:12,170 --> 01:40:16,140
um,
I assume he's just popping by agron

2434
01:40:16,141 --> 01:40:18,720
shoot loads all over the place.
I don't know what,

2435
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:21,410
what is his last fucking movie?
Die Hard.

2436
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:23,810
Good Day to die hard.
Wow.

2437
01:40:24,770 --> 01:40:26,660
And who's The guy?
Two sides that Kevin Hart?

2438
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:28,610
No.
Who is that dude?

2439
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:31,850
Never seen that guy in my life.
It was just a guy that was on set.

2440
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:37,010
Did anybody go to see that?
Wouldn't get an amd be 45% on rotten

2441
01:40:37,011 --> 01:40:37,870
tomatoes.
Wow.

2442
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:41,480
Wait,
we can you go to box office Mojo and

2443
01:40:41,481 --> 01:40:43,400
look that up?
Will you look it up on box office Mojo,

2444
01:40:43,730 --> 01:40:45,410
Office Mojo?
There was go back.

2445
01:40:45,411 --> 01:40:46,610
Sorry.
Go back to the previous page.

2446
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:49,910
What is box office Mojo?
It'll tell you like budget and I'll tell

2447
01:40:49,911 --> 01:40:52,670
you what it made here in international.
Look at that down there.

2448
01:40:52,671 --> 01:40:54,430
It says,
I know all the 92 million

2449
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:56,530
box office.
It made 304 million.

2450
01:40:56,531 --> 01:40:58,960
Is that what it says?
So it fucking killed.

2451
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:00,190
It did great.
Good.

2452
01:41:00,210 --> 01:41:02,470
Probably all all overseas.
How foreign sales?

2453
01:41:02,471 --> 01:41:03,490
Yeah,
go to box office Mojo.

2454
01:41:03,491 --> 01:41:05,830
It'll show you.
So maybe he's like one of the few guys

2455
01:41:05,831 --> 01:41:08,080
left that can still do that.
Yeah.

2456
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:12,460
You know like Steven Seagal still sells
a ton of movies overseas.

2457
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:14,230
Fuckload they do those,
uh,

2458
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:15,750
straight to,
you know,

2459
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:17,930
straight to video,
straight to DVD.

2460
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:19,390
Cds did.
He makes tons of money.

2461
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:20,860
He,
they've internationally sell the movie

2462
01:41:20,861 --> 01:41:22,090
before he even makes it.
Do you know that?

2463
01:41:22,210 --> 01:41:23,540
You know,
he's a Russian citizen.

2464
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:24,160
I know.
I love,

2465
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:25,600
I gave her a pass.
It's hilarious.

2466
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:28,060
He's sticking around.
There you go.

2467
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:30,700
Rushing passport.
There's a look at that as the proof.

2468
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:34,180
It made 62 million here and a 237
overseas.

2469
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:38,840
Wow.
International superstar did get that

2470
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:42,460
paper Bros pay bruce.
That's amazing.

2471
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:45,260
What do you think he walked away with?
Oh,

2472
01:41:45,370 --> 01:41:48,850
he took 10 upfront to make it.
He probably got a ton of money.

2473
01:41:48,851 --> 01:41:50,860
I don't know how it works.
Points.

2474
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:52,840
He's probably got 30 30 million out of
that.

2475
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:55,450
Maybe balling out of control.
Bruce hit us up,

2476
01:41:55,451 --> 01:41:57,210
dude.
Yeah,

2477
01:41:57,430 --> 01:42:00,190
he's good friends with dom.
Irrera yeah,

2478
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:01,360
those too.
That's so funny.

2479
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:02,510
I would love to see it.
Uh,

2480
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,630
just a dem too in a diner having a
conversation.

2481
01:42:04,710 --> 01:42:05,590
I know,
right?

2482
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:09,440
It's this Bruce Dama rare.
Tom Are rarer still doing the day.

2483
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:10,630
Dude,
I fucking love him.

2484
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:12,250
He did a bunch of episodes on the
showtime show.

2485
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:12,820
I did.
He?

2486
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:13,521
Yeah.

2487
01:42:13,521 --> 01:42:16,180

like real comics,

2488
01:42:16,181 --> 01:42:18,160

The showtime show looks great,

2489
01:42:18,161 --> 01:42:20,930

I love how authentic everybody looks and

2490
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:25,210

Real comics.

2491
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:29,890
Y'all magical you neuron Erik Griffin.
Jaren uh,

2492
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:33,040

fucking dumb.

2493
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:36,460
Earl Skakel does a few poppins on it.
Um,

2494
01:42:37,870 --> 01:42:38,740
oh my God.
Oh,

2495
01:42:38,741 --> 01:42:40,810
I'm sure I'm drawing such a blank.
There's so many other guys that like

2496
01:42:40,811 --> 01:42:43,540
came in and left.
She would get fucking gold.

2497
01:42:43,541 --> 01:42:45,040
Yeah.
That's that man.

2498
01:42:45,041 --> 01:42:46,860
That's crazy.
And Melissa,

2499
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:49,840
Melissa,
you guys feel like an extreme amount of

2500
01:42:49,841 --> 01:42:53,230
responsibility while you were doing this
because you're doing a movie that's

2501
01:42:53,231 --> 01:42:56,950
based on the most important comedy club
in my opinion.

2502
01:42:56,980 --> 01:42:58,060
Ever.
Yeah.

2503
01:42:58,210 --> 01:42:58,921
TV show,
but yeah,

2504
01:42:58,921 --> 01:42:59,261
yeah.
No,

2505
01:42:59,261 --> 01:42:59,721
yeah,
yeah.

2506
01:42:59,721 --> 01:43:02,860
You're doing a show.
The pressure was fucking,

2507
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:03,641
yeah,
man.

2508
01:43:03,641 --> 01:43:06,550
I felt the pressure,
the responsibility was fucking huge.

2509
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:10,660
Wow.
We premiered last night and it will air

2510
01:43:10,661 --> 01:43:12,220
this Sunday.
And uh,

2511
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:14,170
Jim Carey said some amazing things,
man.

2512
01:43:14,650 --> 01:43:15,730
Yeah.
That's our cast photo.

2513
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,110
That one that you clicked that one.
Yeah.

2514
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:22,210
Did it feel weird to be on that?
I mean it must have been like I can tell

2515
01:43:22,211 --> 01:43:25,780
you from the bottom of my honest heart,
it was the most important thing I've

2516
01:43:25,781 --> 01:43:26,500
done so far.

2517
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:27,640
Wow,
dude.

2518
01:43:27,641 --> 01:43:30,340
I mean we're paying homage to the world
that,

2519
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:34,570
that we love and respect so much and it
was a big effort on Jim's part and his

2520
01:43:34,571 --> 01:43:36,340
producing partner,
Michael Aguilar to like tell real

2521
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:37,930
stories.
A lot of the stories that people will

2522
01:43:37,931 --> 01:43:40,780
see if you watch the show,
and I hope you do come from Jim's real

2523
01:43:40,781 --> 01:43:43,390
life to do term Boston move.
They live in a fucking dude's closet in

2524
01:43:43,391 --> 01:43:46,180
West Hollywood and they used to be a guy
that would jerk off and watched him

2525
01:43:46,181 --> 01:43:48,400
change and Jim,
Jim put that story in the show,

2526
01:43:48,401 --> 01:43:51,070
man.
He wanted all these little great tidbit.

2527
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:54,020
There's a great moment about jokes
stealing in there and a fucking huge

2528
01:43:54,021 --> 01:43:56,150
fist fight that breaks out.
That was real from gyms,

2529
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:59,420
personal life about guys who used to
come in from the fucking radio,

2530
01:43:59,421 --> 01:44:00,890
from talk radio in the,
you know,

2531
01:44:00,891 --> 01:44:02,300
in the morning they come to the club at
night,

2532
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:03,890
come to the store,
steal shit.

2533
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,570
The next morning comics would fucking
hear it.

2534
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:07,490
Yeah.
That's a real common thing.

2535
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:09,980
And that was always going on.
You know what else was going on?

2536
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:11,390
A big one was,
uh,

2537
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:16,190
writers for sitcoms would come same shit
and they would watch people do sets and

2538
01:44:16,191 --> 01:44:18,670
then they would wind up putting their,
their bits and like,

2539
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:22,670
even in fucking Seinfeld kept wanting
Kevin James Signature bits got used on

2540
01:44:22,671 --> 01:44:26,240
Seinfeld after he had a bunch of
meetings and then they came to see him

2541
01:44:26,241 --> 01:44:31,241
perform a bunch of like top writers came
to see him performing an NBC showcase.

2542
01:44:31,570 --> 01:44:35,360
This is like when Kevin was a getting a
development deal and they came down and

2543
01:44:35,361 --> 01:44:37,550
watched him and then like the next
season,

2544
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:41,150
his muffin bit was on a Seinfeld episode
and he was like,

2545
01:44:41,151 --> 01:44:43,580
what the fuck man?
Well nowadays they fucking,

2546
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:45,090
they're blatant.
They tell you like I,

2547
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:48,350
I tested for Saturday night live and you
sign a form that says these characters

2548
01:44:48,351 --> 01:44:50,900
can be used after the audition.

2549
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:53,060
Whoa.
And this is crazy.

2550
01:44:53,061 --> 01:44:55,160
I'm not calling out anybody you're
saying anything.

2551
01:44:55,161 --> 01:44:56,630
But they did.
There was a character ended up on the

2552
01:44:56,631 --> 01:44:59,390
show that Vanessa Bayer did fucking
hilariously,

2553
01:44:59,391 --> 01:45:00,920
that I did something similar in my
addiction.

2554
01:45:00,921 --> 01:45:01,431
I was like,
damn,

2555
01:45:01,431 --> 01:45:02,750
that was really good.
It's winning me.

2556
01:45:02,751 --> 01:45:04,220
You so you,
you audition,

2557
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:06,040
you have a character you audition with.
Yeah,

2558
01:45:06,041 --> 01:45:08,750
I did this character.
It is fake or skills that they own that

2559
01:45:08,751 --> 01:45:11,360
now when you audition,
you surrender the character.

2560
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:12,410
Fuck you,
man.

2561
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:14,240
Yeah.
You sign a piece of paper that's crazy

2562
01:45:14,241 --> 01:45:17,580
than not even giving you money and
they're stealing your idea when you get

2563
01:45:17,610 --> 01:45:19,730
there.
That that's the respect that,

2564
01:45:19,731 --> 01:45:21,480
uh,
the SNL has earned in the,

2565
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,060
in that community who,
you know,

2566
01:45:23,090 --> 01:45:24,830
you don't have that respect.
It's crazy.

2567
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:26,330
That's stealing.
You're stealing.

2568
01:45:26,331 --> 01:45:27,280
Well,
I signed the form,

2569
01:45:27,281 --> 01:45:28,610
man.
Oh my God.

2570
01:45:28,611 --> 01:45:29,750
Dude,
that's so awful.

2571
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:32,330
I signed that sheet because you can
almost taste it.

2572
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:34,280
You know,
they're making you sign something

2573
01:45:34,281 --> 01:45:35,510
saying,
we're gonna steal from you.

2574
01:45:35,570 --> 01:45:37,310
Totally.
That's insane.

2575
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:39,830
We're going to steal from you.
We're not going to pay you anything.

2576
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:42,680
We're going to use this thing.
It might be a fucking Mike Meyers movie

2577
01:45:42,681 --> 01:45:43,670
someday,
and you'd have to say,

2578
01:45:43,671 --> 01:45:44,240
yes,
sir.

2579
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:46,340
May I have another take it and take
acid.

2580
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:49,040
Can I dig it?
It's so crazy.

2581
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:49,903
I took it,
man.

2582
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:51,710
I took it.
It was a wild process.

2583
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:55,670
Let the fact that some she usually
successful business wouldn't want to

2584
01:45:55,671 --> 01:45:59,140
compensate people for creating those
ideas to fly you out to,

2585
01:45:59,230 --> 01:46:04,070
to show yourself off in a few.
I mean even if you just don't hire them

2586
01:46:04,071 --> 01:46:06,860
but you liked that character,
you there should be like an established

2587
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:09,070
rate that you have to pay for things.
But I mean not,

2588
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:10,460
you know,
and my whole thing is like,

2589
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:12,260
I'm not saying what they did was what I
did,

2590
01:46:12,261 --> 01:46:14,160
but it was,
there was some similarities in,

2591
01:46:14,161 --> 01:46:17,450
in the nuances of the character that I
thought were either just,

2592
01:46:17,451 --> 01:46:19,880
you know,
a confluence of great ideas,

2593
01:46:19,881 --> 01:46:21,770
but um,
it is hard.

2594
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:25,550
You think about that stuff you're like,
is that close to what I did?

2595
01:46:25,551 --> 01:46:27,080
Because you know,
like we said back in the day,

2596
01:46:27,081 --> 01:46:29,090
like our show shows,
people were blatantly steep.

2597
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:31,670
People have been blatantly stealing in
comedy for fucking ever.

2598
01:46:31,671 --> 01:46:35,780
It's been like the beginning of time and
especially in the 70s which I think is

2599
01:46:35,781 --> 01:46:39,800
what we tried to show was like they
would steal these radio guys and fucking

2600
01:46:39,801 --> 01:46:41,240
show up again and be like,
hey,

2601
01:46:41,690 --> 01:46:43,290
like it was like it.
I can tell you how,

2602
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:45,440
come on buddy.
Hold on that that was one of your shit

2603
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:47,030
jokes from last night.
We always,

2604
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:48,740
we always promote you.
You ever,

2605
01:46:48,741 --> 01:46:50,030
you're in.
Yeah,

2606
01:46:50,830 --> 01:46:52,800
like I'm really,
I'm really lucky that I didn't grow up

2607
01:46:52,801 --> 01:46:55,680
in a generation where you didn't get
paid in the sense of like when I

2608
01:46:55,681 --> 01:46:58,260
remember hearing stories of guys that
would go on the road and then get fucked

2609
01:46:58,261 --> 01:47:01,580
out of a check.
You can get fuck still really get

2610
01:47:01,581 --> 01:47:02,281
fucked.
Yeah.

2611
01:47:02,281 --> 01:47:03,810
I've heard of people getting fucked.
Joey.

2612
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:06,330
Joey Diaz had a,
an experience about a year ago.

2613
01:47:06,430 --> 01:47:08,070
Well,
Joey's got to fuck with too.

2614
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:10,380
Yeah.
He called this guy up and started

2615
01:47:10,381 --> 01:47:11,760
screaming at him and said,
listen,

2616
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:14,430
you know you don't fucking pay me.
He goes,

2617
01:47:14,431 --> 01:47:16,290
I'm going to tell the whole world.
He goes,

2618
01:47:16,291 --> 01:47:18,630
I'm going to have all my friends tell
the whole world and no one's going to

2619
01:47:18,631 --> 01:47:20,220
fucking work here anymore.
That's it.

2620
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:22,440
Yeah.
And he wound up getting paid but it took

2621
01:47:22,441 --> 01:47:25,530
him a while to get paid.
There's a lot of club owners are still

2622
01:47:25,531 --> 01:47:28,140
doing coke.
Isn't that fucking insane?

2623
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:33,290
I know a guy,
I know a guy still getting placed on him

2624
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,190
every time I'm around him.
He's coked up.

2625
01:47:36,350 --> 01:47:39,240
No,
he's just limited like the old days.

2626
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:40,800
But here's the thing,
they never saw.

2627
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:42,750
It has been a part of it from the
beginning of time,

2628
01:47:43,090 --> 01:47:46,140
like from the beginning of when I
started doing standup,

2629
01:47:46,141 --> 01:47:49,770
there was a lot of club owners that were
on coke and they just normal.

2630
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,140
Yeah,
they partied Nick's comedy stop in

2631
01:47:52,141 --> 01:47:54,180
Boston.
It didn't never happened to me cause I

2632
01:47:54,181 --> 01:47:57,120
was never a coke guy.
But they would offer you if you wanted

2633
01:47:57,121 --> 01:47:58,980
to get paid in money or coke.

2634
01:48:01,110 --> 01:48:03,690
I'm not kidding.
Any other industry.

2635
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:06,840
They would pay the comics and cocaine.
Like Lenny Clarke has told me about it

2636
01:48:06,841 --> 01:48:09,180
in great detail and said I'll just take
the coke.

2637
01:48:09,181 --> 01:48:11,730
I guess some guys took the coke,
can you do a half a half?

2638
01:48:11,731 --> 01:48:15,270
Can you do like an eight ball?
And these guys were selling coke and

2639
01:48:15,271 --> 01:48:17,250
running comedy clubs and it's kind of
brilliant.

2640
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:20,100
I mean there was,
it was total on organized crime shit.

2641
01:48:20,130 --> 01:48:23,760
It was all organized crime.
It was just like at a level where it was

2642
01:48:23,761 --> 01:48:25,980
acceptable.
It wasn't like they were killing people

2643
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:29,370
but they were selling coke.
But coke was still okay that it was

2644
01:48:29,371 --> 01:48:29,841
like,
man,

2645
01:48:29,841 --> 01:48:33,450
that's fucking dude.
No one's totally captured the crazy days

2646
01:48:33,451 --> 01:48:36,810
of Boston.
I was a kid back then so I got to see it

2647
01:48:36,811 --> 01:48:39,300
really from the outside.
And it all started before I even

2648
01:48:39,301 --> 01:48:41,280
started,
about four years before I started.

2649
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:45,780
It was at its peak and like 84 yeah.
Those guys were maniacs out of their

2650
01:48:45,781 --> 01:48:48,860
minds.
Maniacs hammered every night on.

2651
01:48:48,861 --> 01:48:51,330
So like Mario joinder was talking about
it last night at the store.

2652
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:52,920
Yeah,
cause he was hosting the show that we

2653
01:48:52,921 --> 01:48:56,040
were doing and Mario joined.
It was like they would just go up there

2654
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:59,370
and just get hammered and just be
killing.

2655
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:00,780
It's crushing,
blacked out,

2656
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:02,250
crushing,
blacked out,

2657
01:49:02,251 --> 01:49:03,300
drunk,
hammered.

2658
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:06,570
It was a different,
it was a whole different groove,

2659
01:49:06,571 --> 01:49:08,460
man.
Now you have to be on your p's and q's,

2660
01:49:08,461 --> 01:49:10,650
man,
now everyone's got to be real tight.

2661
01:49:10,651 --> 01:49:12,450
I feel like the majority of people in
comedy,

2662
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:14,130
the,
the longer I've stayed in comedy,

2663
01:49:14,131 --> 01:49:17,400
the more I see people sober now.
I think a lot of people,

2664
01:49:18,030 --> 01:49:19,250
it's just not,
people are,

2665
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,870
I feel like there's a lot of,
there's a lot more clean people working

2666
01:49:21,871 --> 01:49:25,260
now than people who party.
I think there's a lot of people that

2667
01:49:25,261 --> 01:49:29,520
realize the consequences of partying.
You can only stay on that fucking train

2668
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:32,910
for so long because you look at the
great ones that got derailed,

2669
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:36,450
whether it's cat williams,
whether it's Kinison,

2670
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,790
the great ones that have been derailed
by cocaine.

2671
01:49:38,820 --> 01:49:40,890
There's Liz,
a ton of them that we know of.

2672
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:43,590
The cocaine one gets you ends in a bad
way.

2673
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:46,230
If you go back,
your creativity goes away.

2674
01:49:46,231 --> 01:49:48,430
You get paranoid,
you get tired.

2675
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,750
Your act diminishes greatly like
Kennison him and my opinions with a best

2676
01:49:52,751 --> 01:49:55,300
example.
He's the best example of a guy who at

2677
01:49:55,301 --> 01:49:59,120
one point in time was just arguably the
best ever for like two years and then

2678
01:49:59,121 --> 01:49:59,830
stop.
Good.

2679
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:03,790
Just a monster,
a Ma and a thing like no one had seen

2680
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:07,690
before.
Like there wasn't a Sam Kennison like an

2681
01:50:07,691 --> 01:50:08,524
archetype.
Yeah,

2682
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:10,270
it didn't exist.
He was,

2683
01:50:10,271 --> 01:50:15,271
this fat guy been fucked over.
I've been married twice and he just

2684
01:50:15,461 --> 01:50:19,780
would come out this giant fucking big
energy.

2685
01:50:19,781 --> 01:50:23,260
There's this thing,
I got fucking human storm of comedy,

2686
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:27,460
but then it dropped off so radically.
Like Ari was talking about the other

2687
01:50:27,461 --> 01:50:30,550
night.
Like if you go and watch his stuff after

2688
01:50:30,551 --> 01:50:33,820
the second special,
it's like it's just to eat.

2689
01:50:33,821 --> 01:50:38,560
The second special is a big dropoff.
The real shit is his cd or it wasn't

2690
01:50:38,561 --> 01:50:40,180
even a CD.
Warner brothers wouldn't even make it a

2691
01:50:40,181 --> 01:50:43,570
CD cause it was so homophobic.
They kept it a cassette for real.

2692
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:49,000
His cassette louder than hell and then
his hbo special and don't watch anything

2693
01:50:49,001 --> 01:50:49,230
else.

2694
01:50:49,230 --> 01:50:52,370
The HBO specials.
What I remember fucking seeing as like

2695
01:50:52,371 --> 01:50:55,520
one of the things where I was like,
this is insane.

2696
01:50:55,521 --> 01:50:59,210
This is like a fucking mad man who's
hitting all the marks.

2697
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,380
You know,
it's like,

2698
01:51:00,381 --> 01:51:00,951
uh,
uh,

2699
01:51:00,951 --> 01:51:02,120
smart madman.
Yes,

2700
01:51:02,121 --> 01:51:03,170
at Gigi a genius.
But he,

2701
01:51:03,171 --> 01:51:04,610
but he didn't,
but he's not,

2702
01:51:04,611 --> 01:51:06,650
but he didn't miss it was weird.
It was like,

2703
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:08,090
yeah,
it's like watching something that

2704
01:51:08,091 --> 01:51:09,890
someone do something brilliantly in
sports where you're like,

2705
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:13,130
everything worked perfectly.
It was like all the stars were aligning

2706
01:51:13,131 --> 01:51:16,550
for him to just chugging on this train
of crushing.

2707
01:51:16,610 --> 01:51:18,140
That was crazy shit to see,
man.

2708
01:51:18,170 --> 01:51:20,210
And it was like during the Reagan era

2709
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:22,620
where people started to get a little
buttoned down.

2710
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:25,380
Like that was like,
we went from Carter to Reagan,

2711
01:51:25,381 --> 01:51:27,660
right?
So we go from this hippie peanut farmer

2712
01:51:27,661 --> 01:51:29,970
from Georgia.
The couldn't get the hostages back from,

2713
01:51:29,971 --> 01:51:33,820
I ran to this movie star with a slick
back hair and oh,

2714
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:36,090
this is like,
there was,

2715
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:39,570
he was a part of that.
I mean there was a part of the whole

2716
01:51:39,571 --> 01:51:44,130
country was fucking crazy at the time.
And kinison came along and he sort of

2717
01:51:44,131 --> 01:51:46,740
embodied the frustrations that a lot of
people fell.

2718
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:48,960
The timing was perfect.
Perfect.

2719
01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:52,850
But cocaine got him like he wasn't the
same guy after,

2720
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:56,430
after that special,
there's the just this giant dropoff in

2721
01:51:56,431 --> 01:51:58,350
the amount of focus he put on his work.

2722
01:51:58,620 --> 01:51:59,221
Yeah.
Well,

2723
01:51:59,221 --> 01:52:01,080
because you become complacent and you
also like,

2724
01:52:01,081 --> 01:52:05,280
I think the more money and fame you get,
I think unless you have sense,

2725
01:52:05,281 --> 01:52:07,830
sense,
sense of groundedness and humility

2726
01:52:07,831 --> 01:52:09,240
around you,
like friends to be like,

2727
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:11,460
dude,
you got to fucking change your game.

2728
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,840
You're fucking up.
You're slipping,

2729
01:52:12,841 --> 01:52:14,670
you're not producing,
you're not producing any more.

2730
01:52:14,671 --> 01:52:16,200
You're not writing.
You're not developing.

2731
01:52:16,201 --> 01:52:18,150
You're not changing who you are as a
comic.

2732
01:52:18,450 --> 01:52:20,610
And if you don't have that around you,
if everyone around you is like more

2733
01:52:20,611 --> 01:52:21,660
fucking coke.
Fuck Dude.

2734
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:24,610
More bitches.
That's overages.

2735
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,340
That's it.
No,

2736
01:52:26,341 --> 01:52:27,530
I agree.
Um,

2737
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:29,850
the train crashes.
I don't know Kat Williams,

2738
01:52:30,210 --> 01:52:32,700
but uh,
I'll tell you what to this day,

2739
01:52:32,701 --> 01:52:35,890
like pimping chronicles,
the pimp chronicles him,

2740
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:39,240
whatever that special is that he did,
that is a god damn genius.

2741
01:52:39,241 --> 01:52:41,460
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

2742
01:52:41,550 --> 01:52:45,990
And apparently he looks to local.
Whew.

2743
01:52:46,410 --> 01:52:48,740
I don't know,
but I just wish he would clean up.

2744
01:52:48,770 --> 01:52:51,590
He's one of those guys.
I look forward when he puts out shit

2745
01:52:51,970 --> 01:52:54,110
cause it's so fucking different.
Crazy.

2746
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:55,820
Just wild.
Wild.

2747
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:57,560
He's real.
I mean it's just,

2748
01:52:57,590 --> 01:53:00,310
he's a maniac.
It's fucking hair's all slicked back

2749
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:03,950
sweating like a pig.
He paused especial to change his clothes

2750
01:53:03,951 --> 01:53:06,540
because he sweat so much genius.
That's how you know you're putting in

2751
01:53:06,550 --> 01:53:08,660
work,
sweat through his clothes.

2752
01:53:08,670 --> 01:53:10,580
You're getting your money.
When did it change?

2753
01:53:10,581 --> 01:53:13,880
It came back out and kept crushing.
That's how you know you're,

2754
01:53:13,881 --> 01:53:15,680
it's fucking near where he put in work.
Yeah.

2755
01:53:15,681 --> 01:53:19,280
And that was like after he had gone
through all those cancel shows and all

2756
01:53:19,281 --> 01:53:23,080
the craziness and like got on stage and
yelled at a heckler for five minutes and

2757
01:53:23,090 --> 01:53:26,150
then laughed and everybody wanted their
money back and they booed him and shit

2758
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:27,680
still came back and crushed.

2759
01:53:28,490 --> 01:53:29,041
Yeah.
Yeah.

2760
01:53:29,041 --> 01:53:31,400
He's fucking good.
It's that goddamn cocaine though.

2761
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:32,690
Get some,
gets everybody.

2762
01:53:32,691 --> 01:53:34,550
Everybody that we know that never made
it.

2763
01:53:34,551 --> 01:53:35,840
I mean,
how many guys do you know that were

2764
01:53:35,841 --> 01:53:37,250
funny?
That never made it,

2765
01:53:37,251 --> 01:53:39,800
they started doing coke.
A shitload of dudes.

2766
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:41,660
A shitload.
Not just coke too,

2767
01:53:41,661 --> 01:53:42,950
but just anything,
anything,

2768
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:43,640
anything.
I mean,

2769
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:45,410
as soon as they got into the party
world,

2770
01:53:45,411 --> 01:53:48,160
the hard party world of like,
yeah,

2771
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:49,250
coke,
it's got to be cold.

2772
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:50,510
It's coke one was bad.
It just,

2773
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:52,190
it just,
it just snacks people.

2774
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:57,450
God damn pin an ae disappear man.
Who Love Coke must hate my podcast.

2775
01:53:57,460 --> 01:54:00,980
Like you always shitting on coke.
You don't even never even done coke,

2776
01:54:00,981 --> 01:54:03,080
bro.
That's about rogen dude.

2777
01:54:03,081 --> 01:54:05,540
I like him,
but he's like a pitch about coke dog.

2778
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:07,640
Let it go bro.
A do little coke.

2779
01:54:08,690 --> 01:54:09,920
I do little coke every day.

2780
01:54:10,190 --> 01:54:12,380
Apparently.
That is the best way to get girls to

2781
01:54:12,381 --> 01:54:14,900
have sex with you though.
Like if you've got some cocaine,

2782
01:54:14,930 --> 01:54:18,290
it's did you gotta be in the right place
for people need cocaine?

2783
01:54:18,291 --> 01:54:20,600
Not Allowed to say no.
They just say yes.

2784
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:24,680
They just get crazy and they do coke.
I guess it's like a super inhibition

2785
01:54:24,681 --> 01:54:26,480
lowering thing.
You know?

2786
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:28,700
I think the idea is so fun that they're
like,

2787
01:54:28,701 --> 01:54:33,701
he can get coke,
like anybody can get weed,

2788
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:37,820
but it's like he couldn't get coke.
You're waiting at the house for the guy

2789
01:54:37,821 --> 01:54:40,370
to show up.
The guy shows up in a Lamborghini with

2790
01:54:40,371 --> 01:54:41,990
that fucking music playing in the
background.

2791
01:54:42,170 --> 01:54:45,800
There's no easy way out of his car.
Puts the break on Yo man,

2792
01:54:45,801 --> 01:54:49,130
I got your package.
You give him the money you hug like a

2793
01:54:49,131 --> 01:54:52,230
little bit too violently,
like a little slap hug.

2794
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:55,790
You know that slap the back hug cause
you know that you're dealing in some

2795
01:54:55,791 --> 01:54:58,940
seriously illegal things.
That guy knows where you live too.

2796
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:00,770
How's your sister man?
She's good bro.

2797
01:55:00,771 --> 01:55:02,000
Thanks for asking.
No Shit.

2798
01:55:02,030 --> 01:55:03,500
No shit for the coke man.
No doubt.

2799
01:55:03,790 --> 01:55:05,590
Good Shit.
Oh Yo the best yo,

2800
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:08,050
next time I got some non,
some really clean shit's not stepped

2801
01:55:08,051 --> 01:55:10,490
down dog.
So fucking hit me to fuck up right next

2802
01:55:10,490 --> 01:55:11,930
week.
Next week I got a new shipment coming

2803
01:55:11,931 --> 01:55:12,950
in.
And you gotta be careful though.

2804
01:55:12,951 --> 01:55:15,470
Don't Odi cause it should that strong
don't odd dude.

2805
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:18,290
I don't want that on my conscious but
just be dropping their panties for this

2806
01:55:18,291 --> 01:55:20,450
shit bro.
You gotta be bitches in the house?

2807
01:55:21,430 --> 01:55:22,161
No.
All right man,

2808
01:55:22,161 --> 01:55:26,600
I gotta get out here.
Did you see that?

2809
01:55:26,601 --> 01:55:31,370
That Mary Latino Lady that uh,
fuck that kid in school and went to jail

2810
01:55:31,371 --> 01:55:34,670
and then had a kid with all broke up
after 21 years together.

2811
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:36,710
Can you believe it?
This kid finally woke up.

2812
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:38,210
I was like,
this bitch is crazy.

2813
01:55:40,430 --> 01:55:44,250
21 years later,
still took two 21

2814
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:45,780
years.
This kid has been banging her.

2815
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,670
I got to get the fuck Outta here.
Oh,

2816
01:55:47,671 --> 01:55:50,670
you're not to fuck me when I was 12.
What am I doing here?

2817
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:52,020
Shit,
I didn't realize this was super

2818
01:55:52,021 --> 01:55:53,010
unhealthy.
All right.

2819
01:55:53,011 --> 01:55:53,910
Yeah.
Thanks.

2820
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,040
I gotta go.
I think they have a kid together.

2821
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:58,620
Do they?
10 year old daughter.

2822
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,210
18 year old dog.
Well,

2823
01:56:00,211 --> 01:56:01,980
she's going to be,
she's going to fucking have everything

2824
01:56:01,981 --> 01:56:03,300
in order.
I'm sure it's going to be the leader of

2825
01:56:03,301 --> 01:56:04,580
a punk band.
Yeah,

2826
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:06,510
she'll be,
she'll have her head shaved.

2827
01:56:06,511 --> 01:56:08,760
She'll be fucking wearing doc martens
stomping around.

2828
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:12,930
Mary Kayla turns husband.
We only split so I could sell pot.

2829
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,430
I love it.
I love life.

2830
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:23,640
Life's beautiful setting.
It's still happily together and he

2831
01:56:23,641 --> 01:56:27,330
merely filed for legal separation from
May 9th because he believes it will make

2832
01:56:27,510 --> 01:56:31,460
it easier for him to get a license to
distribute marijuana cigarettes.

2833
01:56:31,540 --> 01:56:33,120
She,
she's a registered sex offender.

2834
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:35,360
Oh

2835
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:36,940
yes.
She has to be right because he was

2836
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,860
underage.
That's hilarious.

2837
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:40,300
I've met,
she's still Afrique.

2838
01:56:40,930 --> 01:56:43,720
Totally dude.
I bet she puts like alligator masks on.

2839
01:56:43,721 --> 01:56:46,030
So He's 55.
She's 55.

2840
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:48,640
They're fine.
That just got legally divorced or they

2841
01:56:48,641 --> 01:56:49,474
could,
uh,

2842
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:54,130
seven years in prison for,
I'm happy for that.

2843
01:56:54,131 --> 01:56:57,130
Did she really?
Seven years is fucking wild.

2844
01:56:57,460 --> 01:56:58,720
That's so stupid.
He was,

2845
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:02,650
he was in sixth grade.
What's six grades that 1212 or 13?

2846
01:57:02,980 --> 01:57:07,060
Jesus.
That was a DJ in Washington.

2847
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:08,650
Would you go see your shows?
I was up in Seattle.

2848
01:57:08,651 --> 01:57:09,460
I should've gotten up there.
Yeah,

2849
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:10,780
it's probably awesome.
Really,

2850
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:11,633
really good.
Show.

2851
01:57:14,110 --> 01:57:17,560
A fire bomb goes off.
Fucking glitter in the air.

2852
01:57:17,590 --> 01:57:18,423
It's crazy,
bro.

2853
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:20,470
Shit is the shit.
He knows that a party.

2854
01:57:21,250 --> 01:57:22,750
What do you spin man?
Bam,

2855
01:57:22,830 --> 01:57:23,640
Bam,
Bam,

2856
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:25,180
Bam.
Whenever I'm feeling dog

2857
01:57:27,260 --> 01:57:28,030
amp.
Amp,

2858
01:57:28,030 --> 01:57:28,661
amp.
Amp.

2859
01:57:28,661 --> 01:57:30,790
Kids loved that music when they're on
the drugs though too.

2860
01:57:30,791 --> 01:57:31,710
When you're on net,
molly,

2861
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:35,500
you can't escape the beat.
How many times have you done ecstasy?

2862
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:37,030
Ecstasy.
I've,

2863
01:57:37,030 --> 01:57:40,630
I've done
two or three times.

2864
01:57:40,660 --> 01:57:44,080
Two or three and dma cause two different
things,

2865
01:57:44,081 --> 01:57:46,290
right?
I think Mtma is ecstasy.

2866
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:49,540
The old ecstasy that we did in high
school was definitely not what it is

2867
01:57:49,541 --> 01:57:51,850
now.
It was like whatever pill they crushed

2868
01:57:51,851 --> 01:57:53,770
together of shit from the sink.
They lied to you.

2869
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:54,820
Fuck yeah,
that was bad.

2870
01:57:54,821 --> 01:57:56,290
Shit.
You get lied to in Chicago.

2871
01:57:56,350 --> 01:58:00,610
MTMA was
Mtma the first time I ever did it was in

2872
01:58:00,611 --> 01:58:04,390
London and about 10 years ago,
that was the first time ever even heard

2873
01:58:04,391 --> 01:58:05,910
of it because he wasn't molly,
didn't they?

2874
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:07,990
No one's had molly,
but the guy was like,

2875
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:11,080
Andrew,
this guy who lived next door was that do

2876
01:58:11,081 --> 01:58:14,260
I've got these fucking a dude.
You've got to try it.

2877
01:58:14,650 --> 01:58:15,670
And I was like,
all right,

2878
01:58:15,671 --> 01:58:17,620
whatever the fuck his big like Jamaican
British dude.

2879
01:58:17,621 --> 01:58:18,431
I was like,
all right dude,

2880
01:58:18,431 --> 01:58:20,740
I'll try this shit.
We went down by the beach and watch his

2881
01:58:20,741 --> 01:58:22,780
concert and I was like,
Dude,

2882
01:58:22,781 --> 01:58:25,390
how do I get this all the time?
And he was like,

2883
01:58:25,391 --> 01:58:27,910
it's limited supply,
but I've got more for you.

2884
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:29,890
We did that shit for like four days
straight.

2885
01:58:29,950 --> 01:58:32,290
I was like,
this is the most fun I've ever had.

2886
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:35,350
And then I just stopped doing it for
years and years and years and I tried it

2887
01:58:35,351 --> 01:58:37,060
again one more time.
And that was it.

2888
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:39,550
Never again.
I only did it once,

2889
01:58:39,580 --> 01:58:41,650
but it was spectacular.
It's amazing.

2890
01:58:41,870 --> 01:58:42,080
The,

2891
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:43,030
the,
the calm down,

2892
01:58:43,031 --> 01:58:45,520
those who strong the comedown was
devastating.

2893
01:58:45,521 --> 01:58:47,800
I was like this.
Do you get hard crashes when you do

2894
01:58:47,860 --> 01:58:49,090
shrimps or no?
No.

2895
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:50,590
You don't crash at all?
No.

2896
01:58:51,310 --> 01:58:54,940
I mean I feel weird sometimes I fit.
I'm always so bill belittled,

2897
01:58:54,970 --> 01:58:57,940
not belittled,
so obliterated by the experience.

2898
01:58:58,030 --> 01:58:59,710
It's always like I'm trying to process
it.

2899
01:58:59,711 --> 01:59:02,140
They're like,
I'm barely aware of my physical state.

2900
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:04,030
Um,
almost like eating just to like,

2901
01:59:04,031 --> 01:59:06,640
just cause I have to,
I know I have to get calories excess and

2902
01:59:06,660 --> 01:59:08,130
it should be in my body.
I mean,

2903
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:10,000
let me just figure out what the fuck
just happened.

2904
01:59:10,330 --> 01:59:11,140
You know,
it's always like,

2905
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:12,220
oh yeah,
I knew,

2906
01:59:12,221 --> 01:59:13,930
I knew,
but I did know like I Kinda,

2907
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:17,740
I needed to see it but my crack at my
crashes were for some reason they used

2908
01:59:17,741 --> 01:59:20,110
to be fucking terrible.
I used to come down off of mushrooms and

2909
01:59:20,111 --> 01:59:22,510
I would feel fucking miserable.

2910
01:59:22,510 --> 01:59:25,240
Is it always every time he did it almost
man.

2911
01:59:25,330 --> 01:59:28,900
Did you ever think that like maybe the
one thing that does happen apparently is

2912
01:59:28,901 --> 01:59:32,380
that sometimes people grow mushrooms and
oddly enough the mushrooms have fungus

2913
01:59:32,381 --> 01:59:35,350
that develops on them.
I didn't get sick from the fungus and

2914
01:59:35,351 --> 01:59:37,480
then sometimes people say they have like
these,

2915
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:40,120
they have these almost like hangover,
like feelings.

2916
01:59:40,121 --> 01:59:42,220
Because of that.
I have read that I've never had a

2917
01:59:42,221 --> 01:59:42,971
hangover.
I mean I just,

2918
01:59:42,971 --> 01:59:45,940
I just remembered a lot of the crashes
being like a fucking bummer.

2919
01:59:46,140 --> 01:59:49,110
Like I was like,
this is for some reason acid was the

2920
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:51,130
first time I ever did.
Acid was had like,

2921
01:59:51,131 --> 01:59:53,740
I felt like even when I was off of it,
it was great.

2922
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:55,750
I didn't really didn't fuck with me.
Yeah.

2923
01:59:55,770 --> 01:59:58,600
I,
I did acid for the first time last year.

2924
01:59:58,910 --> 02:00:00,640
Like was it last year?
Six months ago?

2925
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:02,200
Something like that.
Yeah.

2926
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:03,280
Yeah.
But it didn't,

2927
02:00:03,281 --> 02:00:04,114
um,
it didn't,

2928
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:06,980
it didn't crash me.
If that felt weird when it was over.

2929
02:00:07,630 --> 02:00:08,880
I was just didn't want it.
I just,

2930
02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:10,330
I did it and I didn't want to do it
again.

2931
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:12,070
I remember doing it and being like,
Eh,

2932
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:15,370
I just didn't want to do it again.
They say the thing about ecstasy,

2933
02:00:15,371 --> 02:00:18,610
those if you take five htp,
you've got to take that shit.

2934
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:23,380
Like while you're on it cause it helps
rebuild your serotonin so it balances it

2935
02:00:23,381 --> 02:00:23,930
out.
Yeah.

2936
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:25,840
Cause it's the building blocks for
Serotonin.

2937
02:00:25,870 --> 02:00:30,250
Take that and it'll uh,
it'll help you a boost yourself back up

2938
02:00:30,251 --> 02:00:32,040
when you come through.
That's because once you come through,

2939
02:00:32,050 --> 02:00:34,270
cause it gives you this giant burst of
Serotonin.

2940
02:00:34,271 --> 02:00:37,510
You feel so wonderful.
But then it depletes train while before

2941
02:00:37,511 --> 02:00:40,930
it spools back up.
The five htp apparently can help

2942
02:00:40,931 --> 02:00:43,120
mitigate that and sounds like printer
ink.

2943
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:44,590
Yeah,
it does.

2944
02:00:44,590 --> 02:00:46,120
The five htp,
I guess.

2945
02:00:46,270 --> 02:00:47,920
It's so funny.
There's like a science enough staying

2946
02:00:47,921 --> 02:00:51,610
fucking healthy while you're on drugs.
I know when I first started doing drugs

2947
02:00:51,611 --> 02:00:53,290
it was like figure it out.
Did met you,

2948
02:00:53,291 --> 02:00:54,620
your lip off.
Uh,

2949
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:59,640
you get a Jig applesauce
home remedies like that.

2950
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:03,190
You were having a new Udo [inaudible]
minuto is the Mexican.

2951
02:01:04,270 --> 02:01:07,030
I'm like,
I'm like not what I thought it's a drug

2952
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:08,500
now I'm a noodle.
Yeah.

2953
02:01:08,501 --> 02:01:10,840
New though is a,
the Mexican hangover cure.

2954
02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:12,430
It's fucking great.
You can get it.

2955
02:01:12,431 --> 02:01:14,950
This is a legit Mexican joint down the
street,

2956
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:17,890
right?
It's pork basis and it's a bunch of shit

2957
02:01:17,891 --> 02:01:20,080
in there.
They have tried Chari soul and shit.

2958
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:22,420
There's,
there's like stomach like you like

2959
02:01:22,421 --> 02:01:24,430
pieces of like stomach in there.
That's it's,

2960
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:27,410
it's like this brown suit.
It's chick peas in it or not brown.

2961
02:01:27,410 --> 02:01:32,080
It's like a reddish stew stew.
It's God damn delicious.

2962
02:01:32,081 --> 02:01:34,720
I love it.
If you not get any real place,

2963
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,340
like a real Mexican joint that has real
menino,

2964
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:39,440
whoa.
What's the fucking spot up the should I

2965
02:01:39,441 --> 02:01:40,520
go to?
I'll show you.

2966
02:01:40,521 --> 02:01:41,354
Yeah.
You guys should get a,

2967
02:01:41,370 --> 02:01:42,330
I got a room.
I don't,

2968
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:44,350
I know exactly where it is,
but I don't know the name of it.

2969
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:47,240
Something Tacoria oh,
it's so good,

2970
02:01:47,241 --> 02:01:49,400
dude.
Everyone's watching Mexican tv.

2971
02:01:49,401 --> 02:01:51,170
You go in there,
everyone's speaking Spanish.

2972
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:53,150
They look at you like,
what the fuck you,

2973
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:55,610
how'd you find his blade?
Yeah.

2974
02:01:55,690 --> 02:01:56,523
And you're like,
hey fellas,

2975
02:01:56,570 --> 02:01:59,090
they barely speak English.
Barely.

2976
02:01:59,091 --> 02:02:00,680
When you're ordering food that's the
barely,

2977
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:03,860
and they have to ask you like two or
three times and you have to explain to

2978
02:02:03,861 --> 02:02:05,720
them and then,
you know,

2979
02:02:05,721 --> 02:02:07,100
you could try,
try to like,

2980
02:02:07,130 --> 02:02:07,970
you'll be embarrassed.

2981
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:09,660
Try to say it with,
uh,

2982
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:12,920
the Spanish flair,
but it's so good,

2983
02:02:12,921 --> 02:02:14,240
man.
Whore.

2984
02:02:14,330 --> 02:02:16,520
Chada there's big those bigger chat of
vats.

2985
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:17,780
I love the vats.
Yeah,

2986
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:19,183
that's,
that's,

2987
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:20,030
yeah,
that's it.

2988
02:02:20,030 --> 02:02:22,520
You're going to be a rich Mexican.
You want an Horchata Vat at your house.

2989
02:02:23,370 --> 02:02:25,720
You don't think Gabriel Iglesias as
hundred dollar.

2990
02:02:25,910 --> 02:02:28,610
He's got a giant one,
like an oral barrel and he wears the

2991
02:02:28,611 --> 02:02:31,350
helmet with tubes every morning when he
walks around with it.

2992
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:33,680
Oh.
Horchata helmet.

2993
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,290
It's going to be,
what am I hope she had a helmet.

2994
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:39,080
The fluff,
the fluff,

2995
02:02:39,110 --> 02:02:39,943
the fluff.
Scott it,

2996
02:02:40,030 --> 02:02:43,580
he's like taking time off that guy.
I mean he's fucking,

2997
02:02:43,581 --> 02:02:44,990
he's a machine.
He's been doing it for so long.

2998
02:02:44,991 --> 02:02:46,430
I think he probably needs a little bit
of a break.

2999
02:02:46,431 --> 02:02:48,110
Right.
I think he said he just wants to do a

3000
02:02:48,111 --> 02:02:50,780
bunch of shit now.
It's just going to have some fun just

3001
02:02:50,781 --> 02:02:52,370
party,
just doing some money.

3002
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:55,370
Fuck off by a boat.
Made so much money.

3003
02:02:55,490 --> 02:02:57,710
He's got all of it.
People don't even realize how much money

3004
02:02:57,711 --> 02:03:00,440
that dude made.
That's why he's so good at what he does.

3005
02:03:00,441 --> 02:03:02,570
Cause he keeps it on the low.
He doesn't end up like he has money.

3006
02:03:02,571 --> 02:03:04,370
He doesn't seem,
he doesn't come off that way.

3007
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:06,710
Yeah.
He's a real low to the ground with that

3008
02:03:06,711 --> 02:03:09,020
stuff.
He was doing so many shows.

3009
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:12,920
He has the record number of shows that
were sold out at the ice house.

3010
02:03:12,921 --> 02:03:15,230
He did like some crazy run.
We was doing three,

3011
02:03:15,231 --> 02:03:16,910
four shows a day.
It was something on the Wa.

3012
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:19,100
How many was it?
Would you say?

3013
02:03:19,101 --> 02:03:21,250
Jamie?
He's back on the roof.

3014
02:03:21,251 --> 02:03:23,570
Fucking so we took the time off and jump
back in.

3015
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:26,600
Fluffy is fucking back.
Oh,

3016
02:03:26,601 --> 02:03:28,940
he's got a new special.
Oh Shit.

3017
02:03:28,941 --> 02:03:29,790
Look at all those dates.

3018
02:03:29,790 --> 02:03:30,623
Huh?
He's hot.

3019
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:34,550
Look at all those dates every day.
I'm hustling,

3020
02:03:36,420 --> 02:03:36,921
dude.
Dude.

3021
02:03:36,921 --> 02:03:37,520
Dude.
Dude.

3022
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:40,450
Fluffy family is connected,
Bro.

3023
02:03:41,090 --> 02:03:43,580
I'm sorry for what I said.
When I was hungry I was going to Norway

3024
02:03:43,581 --> 02:03:45,110
and Sweden,
Estonia,

3025
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:47,510
the United Kingdom.
Germany,

3026
02:03:47,511 --> 02:03:48,680
Belgium,
Netherlands.

3027
02:03:48,681 --> 02:03:50,120
Holy Shit.
Finland.

3028
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:52,650
Vegas.
Wow.

3029
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:55,970
She's got a whole European leg of his
tour.

3030
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,470
Holy Shit.
Renee Park,

3031
02:03:57,620 --> 02:03:58,880
California.
Where's renee part?

3032
02:03:58,881 --> 02:04:00,410
Rohnert Park.
Good question.

3033
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:02,180
It's a place where white people
shouldn't go pro.

3034
02:04:03,090 --> 02:04:07,040
I'm going to say that Sioux falls back
on the road,

3035
02:04:07,041 --> 02:04:10,580
baby.
When is your showtime special?

3036
02:04:10,581 --> 02:04:12,500
It's coming out very soon,
right tomorrow.

3037
02:04:12,590 --> 02:04:13,560
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

3038
02:04:14,740 --> 02:04:18,860
June 2nd we released tomorrow baby.
What's it called?

3039
02:04:19,190 --> 02:04:20,720
Home field advantage.
Oh,

3040
02:04:20,721 --> 02:04:21,920
Jesus.
You do it in Chicago.

3041
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:24,470
Did it back home at the vic theater
where I used to go watch a band play

3042
02:04:24,471 --> 02:04:26,510
when I was in high school.
It was so fucking surreal dude.

3043
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:29,720
Wow.
Van and she'll see you cancel.

3044
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:32,560
You're looking cute man and wrong beard.
Strong beard.

3045
02:04:32,561 --> 02:04:33,650
And it was,
I was this when I was shooting the

3046
02:04:33,651 --> 02:04:34,700
shell.
Oh look at that.

3047
02:04:34,820 --> 02:04:37,040
Do you know what that is?
He'll go back to pictures.

3048
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:38,100
You know what that's suddenly mean.
Paying

3049
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:39,960
tribute to somebody.
Do you recognize that picture?

3050
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:40,950
No.
Or what I'm doing?

3051
02:04:41,130 --> 02:04:42,270
No.
Carol Burnett.

3052
02:04:42,590 --> 02:04:44,520
Ah,
fuck.

3053
02:04:44,521 --> 02:04:47,520
Yet in Carol Burnett used to fucking
touch your ear for her.

3054
02:04:47,521 --> 02:04:48,780
For Grant.
For a family.

3055
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:51,270
Wow.
This is a trip without her family.

3056
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:54,360
She used to touch your ear.
Grandmother was like touchy for me while

3057
02:04:54,361 --> 02:04:56,670
her grandma's,
I say I say hi to Nana on TV and she's

3058
02:04:56,671 --> 02:04:57,504
like,
I can't do that.

3059
02:04:58,050 --> 02:04:59,250
She's like,
the fucking fire me.

3060
02:04:59,610 --> 02:05:00,870
And she's like,
I promise I'll show.

3061
02:05:00,871 --> 02:05:02,520
I'll do something.
I'll think of something that you know,

3062
02:05:02,521 --> 02:05:04,620
like as a shout out to you.
And she told her like,

3063
02:05:04,621 --> 02:05:06,090
you know,
for short time later she was like,

3064
02:05:06,091 --> 02:05:08,040
I'm going to touch my year.
You'll know him thinking of you.

3065
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:12,990
So she used to do TV outside to appease
some annoying family members.

3066
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:15,420
Yeah man.
You gotta I bet you realize Nana.

3067
02:05:15,510 --> 02:05:16,800
I got shit I'm doing up there.

3068
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:18,150
Okay.
I'm working.

3069
02:05:18,151 --> 02:05:19,380
I'm God damn.
Carol Burnett.

3070
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:22,470
I'm wishing her a restaurant recently.
A couple of years ago I was at a

3071
02:05:22,471 --> 02:05:23,340
restaurant.
She was there.

3072
02:05:23,650 --> 02:05:25,860
It's weird.
It's like she was just hanging out this

3073
02:05:25,861 --> 02:05:27,530
restaurant really and there with some
guys kicking it.

3074
02:05:27,531 --> 02:05:29,040
Oh yeah.
She's,

3075
02:05:29,041 --> 02:05:30,960
I think she's fucking,
she was genius.

3076
02:05:30,961 --> 02:05:32,660
That show.
Carol Burnett show was a great fucking

3077
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:33,630
show.
She's brilliant.

3078
02:05:34,050 --> 02:05:37,590
Everything about her was like so
inventive of that fucking time period.

3079
02:05:37,591 --> 02:05:39,360
I can,
I appreciate that kind of Shit so much.

3080
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:42,690
Well you don't have to also have to
realize how crazy it was that someone

3081
02:05:42,691 --> 02:05:45,480
was willing to invest in a woman running
a show like Yup.

3082
02:05:45,930 --> 02:05:48,870
It was unheard of.
Carol Burnett shown as a sketch comedy

3083
02:05:48,871 --> 02:05:49,800
show.
Unheard of.

3084
02:05:50,030 --> 02:05:51,840
Yeah.
I mean fuck man,

3085
02:05:51,870 --> 02:05:53,580
look at her.
She's the only tugging on her ear.

3086
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:56,640
Yeah.
It's Kinda crazy man.

3087
02:05:56,641 --> 02:05:59,220
Like at the time,
so powerful man.

3088
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:02,760
How few women were like that at the time
that had that kind of poll.

3089
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:05,020
I mean Lucy,
lucy was the only one of,

3090
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:08,610
of that prior era that had fucking
massive influence in Hollywood.

3091
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:10,950
Yeah.
Who could say anything and be like,

3092
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:13,320
this is how it is.
In studios were like,

3093
02:06:13,570 --> 02:06:15,540
Huh,
we're show was called,

3094
02:06:15,541 --> 02:06:18,250
I love Lucy happening.
Jesus.

3095
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:19,950
It couldn't have been any other way.
You know what I mean?

3096
02:06:19,951 --> 02:06:20,640
For her,
it was like,

3097
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:22,140
she's like,
I am a star.

3098
02:06:22,350 --> 02:06:25,830
I'm going to be the star of the show.
I'm on the fucking intro to be my face

3099
02:06:26,310 --> 02:06:29,100
and then show Ricky Ricardo.
I don't even know Ricky Ricardo his

3100
02:06:29,101 --> 02:06:30,270
name.
How about that?

3101
02:06:30,930 --> 02:06:32,100
Who's that?
Ricky Ricardo Guy.

3102
02:06:32,130 --> 02:06:33,430
What was his name is.
Ah,

3103
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:36,330
it's not clean.
That's what I'm saying.

3104
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:37,860
It's so embarrassing.
I do know who it is,

3105
02:06:38,010 --> 02:06:39,840
but everybody knows who Lucille ball is.

3106
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:44,280
What's that dude's name?
I honestly thought it was ricky Ricardo

3107
02:06:44,850 --> 02:06:46,230
name,
Bro.

3108
02:06:46,231 --> 02:06:49,370
That's the TV name.
Desi Arnaz.

3109
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:51,090
Oh,
okay.

3110
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:52,050
I kind of had,
I must do,

3111
02:06:52,060 --> 02:06:53,640
but I knew that,
I knew that.

3112
02:06:54,210 --> 02:06:55,940
I just forgot it.
You're allowed to forget shit like that.

3113
02:06:55,980 --> 02:06:57,810
I wouldn't forget Lucille Ball.
Fuck No.

3114
02:06:58,010 --> 02:07:00,480
Hmm.
Can't good goddamn show back then.

3115
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:02,460
And that was back when the white girl
was a lot of data.

3116
02:07:02,461 --> 02:07:04,990
Cuban Cubans were,
were very white back then.

3117
02:07:05,110 --> 02:07:06,360
Well.
That was the only kind of cute,

3118
02:07:06,361 --> 02:07:08,040
but yeah,
it was the only minority she could date

3119
02:07:08,041 --> 02:07:08,791
on TV.
Yeah,

3120
02:07:08,791 --> 02:07:12,570
like if it's like if she had a show
called I love Mexicans and she was a

3121
02:07:12,571 --> 02:07:14,490
date dating a Mexican guy and not a
Cuban guy.

3122
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:17,550
Little humans are like from Spain.
It's like a Spaniard.

3123
02:07:17,730 --> 02:07:20,070
It was,
it was thought of as a different thing.

3124
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:22,860
Desi,
Desi Arnaz a handsome bastard back then.

3125
02:07:22,890 --> 02:07:25,800
He was think he ever bank lucy.
No disrespect.

3126
02:07:25,890 --> 02:07:28,470
They were married.
I'm saying,

3127
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:30,120
do you think you banged her though?
No,

3128
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:36,370
no charity in real life.
And then they worked together on TV.

3129
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:37,263
They were.
They were.

3130
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:39,370
Wow.
Look at that.

3131
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:41,320
Wow.

3132
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:43,210
The heyday,
back in the day,

3133
02:07:43,211 --> 02:07:45,730
man,
you ever watch old TV shows just to,

3134
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:49,090
just to get a glimpse of what it was
like to be back in that era.

3135
02:07:49,150 --> 02:07:52,480
My fucking old man loved Andy Griffith
is their favorite fucking show in the

3136
02:07:52,481 --> 02:07:55,300
history of television.
My parents watch Andy Griffith every

3137
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:56,080
day.
Oh God.

3138
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:57,670
They're assessed.
They love that shit.

3139
02:07:57,671 --> 02:08:00,700
My Dad loves that Shit.
They long for nostalgia heath.

3140
02:08:00,740 --> 02:08:05,740
He just thinks that like that's such an
iconic period of time when like comedy

3141
02:08:06,071 --> 02:08:11,071
was pure and clean and the jokes were
about life situations that were,

3142
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:14,890
yeah,
there was a town drunk and as a town

3143
02:08:14,891 --> 02:08:15,641
hall,
you know what I mean?

3144
02:08:15,641 --> 02:08:17,500
It's kind of like everything was such a
setup,

3145
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:18,451
but me,
mom,

3146
02:08:18,451 --> 02:08:20,650
behind the scenes,
they were just as freaky back then,

3147
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:24,090
if not don knotts used to use to stick.
Uh,

3148
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:26,740
the cop aton up his own ass right before
they shot every day.

3149
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:27,730
Are you sure?
Nope.

3150
02:08:30,820 --> 02:08:32,470
Look at that picture.
That's the baton going in his ass.

3151
02:08:32,471 --> 02:08:33,430
That's why Andy,
he's laughing.

3152
02:08:34,450 --> 02:08:35,520
Did you ever,
um,

3153
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:40,530
hear the fatty arbuckle story?
Fatty arbuckle was the big comedian from

3154
02:08:40,991 --> 02:08:45,991
like the 1930 [inaudible] 1940
[inaudible] and they had some girl that

3155
02:08:46,841 --> 02:08:51,310
they were doing something with and
someone put a bottle inside of her,

3156
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:55,090
like in a,
in a vagina and it broke and she died.

3157
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:55,953
Fuck yeah,
she died.

3158
02:08:56,200 --> 02:08:58,500
Yeah.
There was something along those lines.

3159
02:08:58,750 --> 02:09:00,700
There was a bit where it was like,
we're going to put a bottle in your

3160
02:09:00,701 --> 02:09:01,451
pussy.
I think so.

3161
02:09:01,451 --> 02:09:05,740
I think they were partying.
I think they were going too hard and a

3162
02:09:05,741 --> 02:09:08,590
fatty arbuckle was a huge star at the
time.

3163
02:09:08,610 --> 02:09:10,930
Yeah.
And when that woman died,

3164
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:15,990
I don't know if he was,
I don't know if he was a convicted,

3165
02:09:16,870 --> 02:09:20,440
he got charged with me whether or not he
was convicted.

3166
02:09:20,950 --> 02:09:24,280
I don't know if he was convicted,
but his,

3167
02:09:24,281 --> 02:09:26,860
his career was over and then it all
dried up for him.

3168
02:09:27,970 --> 02:09:29,590
I don't even know if he did it,
you know what I mean?

3169
02:09:29,690 --> 02:09:31,030
Um,
I'm not really sure.

3170
02:09:31,060 --> 02:09:33,520
He was probably around for the party
most likely.

3171
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:35,620
Yeah.
Hotel Room.

3172
02:09:36,630 --> 02:09:38,170
Yeah.
She sneezed in the bottle.

3173
02:09:38,171 --> 02:09:40,750
Broke.
Arbuckle was charged with manslaughter

3174
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:41,770
and endured,
not one,

3175
02:09:41,771 --> 02:09:44,440
not two,
but three trials for the alleged crime.

3176
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:47,530
Not going to go into the nitty gritty of
what went on in each trial,

3177
02:09:47,531 --> 02:09:52,240
but try to imagine the mismanagement and
publicity akin to the Oj Simpson trial

3178
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:55,330
and you'll be getting close.
Well then he should have got into it.

3179
02:09:55,390 --> 02:09:56,590
I mean,
who knows.

3180
02:09:56,650 --> 02:10:00,100
I Dunno.
Court TV,

3181
02:10:00,740 --> 02:10:03,670
there was no court TV coverage,
but there was a thriving tabloid press

3182
02:10:03,671 --> 02:10:07,600
and no shortage of bombastic rhetoric.
The assistant prosecutor for one of the

3183
02:10:07,601 --> 02:10:10,760
trials Minton Milton,
you wren.

3184
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:13,660
Hmm.
Became known for his flora.

3185
02:10:13,661 --> 02:10:18,550
Damning description of our buckles
lifestyle to wit a Babylonian feast was

3186
02:10:18,551 --> 02:10:23,440
in process in progress there.
The defendant had sumptuous quarters

3187
02:10:23,441 --> 02:10:25,660
with his friends.
Food was spread.

3188
02:10:25,661 --> 02:10:29,830
Wine and liquor were served and this
modern bells Johar.

3189
02:10:30,190 --> 02:10:32,710
I don't know what that means.
Bell Shahar.

3190
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:34,060
That czar

3191
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:39,560
our sat upon his throne surrounded by
his lords and there ladies,

3192
02:10:39,710 --> 02:10:42,290
there was music feasting,
singing and dancing.

3193
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,710
How do you know?
Were you there?

3194
02:10:44,890 --> 02:10:45,471
The,
yeah,

3195
02:10:45,471 --> 02:10:46,460
he's,
he just said above.

3196
02:10:46,461 --> 02:10:48,440
He didn't want to fucking get into
details and then he explained a bunch of

3197
02:10:48,441 --> 02:10:50,470
Shit.
A modern Belshazzar,

3198
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:53,630
however,
the last king of Babylonia sundered

3199
02:10:53,631 --> 02:10:56,870
[inaudible] his decadence.
This is some game of thrones s dooms day

3200
02:10:56,871 --> 02:10:57,800
stuff right there.
That's a,

3201
02:10:58,070 --> 02:11:01,100
that is an interesting thing that a
prosecutor could do back then.

3202
02:11:01,101 --> 02:11:04,970
They could make that sort of like
ridiculous description of the events

3203
02:11:04,971 --> 02:11:06,620
that took place.
Like you weren't there.

3204
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:08,900
Yeah.
You just say what you actually do not

3205
02:11:08,901 --> 02:11:11,870
know.
You'd actually do not know that this was

3206
02:11:11,871 --> 02:11:13,880
what happened.
It's a bit of big fish story.

3207
02:11:13,930 --> 02:11:15,380
And so did he wind up going to jail.

3208
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:23,520
You know how many people have stuck
bottles up people's pussies and they

3209
02:11:23,521 --> 02:11:26,670
didn't die and they went,
they read that story and I did it this

3210
02:11:26,671 --> 02:11:31,410
morning.
Have you got like one of those Mexican

3211
02:11:31,411 --> 02:11:34,340
coke bottles was real thick ones.
Those are hard to bless or heartbreak.

3212
02:11:34,350 --> 02:11:36,330
You'd have to fucking throw her against
the wall or something.

3213
02:11:36,660 --> 02:11:39,480
If she had a pussy that was so strong,
it could break one of those bottles.

3214
02:11:39,510 --> 02:11:41,700
They could probably endure the cuts to
oh yeah.

3215
02:11:41,790 --> 02:11:43,020
It's all good.
Dense.

3216
02:11:43,380 --> 02:11:45,930
It killed his career.
He third trial,

3217
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:48,380
he uh,
just pretty much lost left Hollywood or

3218
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:50,670
he's shunned by Hollywood and could no
longer find work.

3219
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:53,490
Isn't that crazy that he was acquitted
right?

3220
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:55,950
He got off.
He was acquitted and uh,

3221
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:56,970
it's still,
yeah.

3222
02:11:56,971 --> 02:11:59,010
I guess back then that was it.
It was,

3223
02:11:59,011 --> 02:12:01,200
it's on and there was only one machine,
you know,

3224
02:12:01,201 --> 02:12:02,820
there was no internet back then.
Nope.

3225
02:12:03,430 --> 02:12:07,200
He couldn't have had a youtube page.
Could have made his on youtube based

3226
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:09,770
Fatty arbuckle put out a special on
Seeso.

3227
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:10,613
Man.
It's pretty good.

3228
02:12:11,150 --> 02:12:13,950
It's on epix that they're going to sell
to Netflix and five years.

3229
02:12:18,150 --> 02:12:20,480
How's the working for showtime?
It was good too.

3230
02:12:20,490 --> 02:12:21,690
They've got good shows,
man.

3231
02:12:21,691 --> 02:12:24,180
They did me right.
I will say doing this special this

3232
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:25,710
Friday and then the show comes out on
Sunday,

3233
02:12:25,711 --> 02:12:28,830
so it's like this weekend they're gonna.
They're pairing it together and I

3234
02:12:28,831 --> 02:12:30,300
fucking,
they were great.

3235
02:12:30,301 --> 02:12:31,320
They did great by me,
man.

3236
02:12:31,321 --> 02:12:33,930
I can't fucking say anything negative
about that.

3237
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:36,720
The network is the shit right now.
Billions is good for them.

3238
02:12:37,260 --> 02:12:39,210
They still kicking out shameless people.
Fucking love.

3239
02:12:39,211 --> 02:12:42,660
Shameless still bloodline.
I mean there's a bunch of fucking really

3240
02:12:42,661 --> 02:12:43,494
good shows.
Yeah.

3241
02:12:43,710 --> 02:12:48,450
Showtimes resurfaced as a of the premium
cable network that it's w wanted to be

3242
02:12:48,451 --> 02:12:49,860
for a long time.
Yeah.

3243
02:12:49,861 --> 02:12:54,861
I did a a Netflix special in two oh five
and in 2006 showtime eared it.

3244
02:12:55,210 --> 02:12:56,910
They,
they've put together some good comedy

3245
02:12:56,911 --> 02:12:57,661
specials.
Well,

3246
02:12:57,661 --> 02:13:00,480
they have the Netflix and showtime have
to have some kind of deal because a lot

3247
02:13:00,481 --> 02:13:03,630
of the times you're showtime shit ends
up on Netflix.

3248
02:13:03,630 --> 02:13:05,040
They,
they buy out the rights of that.

3249
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:07,040
That would be smart.
You know,

3250
02:13:07,140 --> 02:13:08,400
if they did that,
that would be smart.

3251
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:10,560
Well a good move.
It's good move for everybody.

3252
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:13,020
You know what I mean?
And I hope they also have it available.

3253
02:13:13,021 --> 02:13:16,380
Like we,
it's easy to watch online know where the

3254
02:13:16,390 --> 02:13:19,500
mega with very few hurdles to be able to
watch it online because you've got to

3255
02:13:19,501 --> 02:13:20,700
give it to people.
Men At some point.

3256
02:13:20,940 --> 02:13:23,490
Well not only that,
more people find out how good it is.

3257
02:13:23,491 --> 02:13:25,350
More people watch it,
you know,

3258
02:13:25,351 --> 02:13:27,810
whether it's your show or whether it's
just stand up,

3259
02:13:28,230 --> 02:13:29,200
you know,
the more,

3260
02:13:29,201 --> 02:13:30,720
more,
more stuff that gets out there,

3261
02:13:30,721 --> 02:13:31,800
the better it is.
Right.

3262
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:32,720
Absolutely.

3263
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:37,470
Who getting these crazy day and age,
I hope you've come along in the golden

3264
02:13:37,471 --> 02:13:38,820
age of the comedy store.
You know that right?

3265
02:13:38,970 --> 02:13:40,740
It's fucking wild man.
Yeah,

3266
02:13:41,250 --> 02:13:43,720
the boom,
this is the boom right now we're gonna

3267
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:45,060
throw it.
Is the bubble going to pop?

3268
02:13:46,050 --> 02:13:48,960
I don't think so cause there's so much,
there's so many funny comedians.

3269
02:13:49,110 --> 02:13:51,840
That's the guys like yourself guys.
There's a lot of guys out there that are

3270
02:13:51,841 --> 02:13:54,360
really good and that are coming up that
are really good.

3271
02:13:54,390 --> 02:13:55,770
There's real good comedy going on.

3272
02:13:55,780 --> 02:13:56,531
I know.
It's crazy.

3273
02:13:56,531 --> 02:13:58,180
I think it's breeding really good
comedy.

3274
02:13:58,240 --> 02:13:59,950
I think because there's so much great
competition,

3275
02:13:59,951 --> 02:14:02,350
there's so many fucking good people.
I think it's breeding to people to be

3276
02:14:02,351 --> 02:14:05,110
stronger and stronger.
Sometimes I see fucking guys and I'm

3277
02:14:05,111 --> 02:14:06,320
like,
God damn are getting so

3278
02:14:06,470 --> 02:14:09,260
strong.
Well it's like you see really good stuff

3279
02:14:09,261 --> 02:14:09,951
around you.
You know,

3280
02:14:09,951 --> 02:14:13,310
you show up one night in Chappelle goes
up and then Chris rock goes on after him

3281
02:14:13,311 --> 02:14:17,180
and like you're seeing this stuff on a
regular basis and they'll like the

3282
02:14:17,181 --> 02:14:20,900
quality of the comedy that you say.
It's very high and that guy's coming up.

3283
02:14:21,770 --> 02:14:24,010
You know?
When I first started the store in 94 it

3284
02:14:24,011 --> 02:14:26,720
was a dead zone.
It was just a terrible time.

3285
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:29,330
It was like right after the Kennison
boom,

3286
02:14:29,331 --> 02:14:33,650
it ended Kennison left.
They're like 86 and then by the time I

3287
02:14:33,651 --> 02:14:35,180
came around,
it was an eight years later.

3288
02:14:35,181 --> 02:14:37,940
Kinison was dead and the place was
weird.

3289
02:14:37,941 --> 02:14:39,560
Nobody wanted to be there.
It was weird.

3290
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:45,350
It was weird there for a long time man.
Especially in terms of like talent

3291
02:14:45,351 --> 02:14:47,780
coming up,
you know the talent coming up.

3292
02:14:47,781 --> 02:14:49,700
Back then it was just like it was really
poor.

3293
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:52,130
This is the best you've ever seen it
since you started at percent?

3294
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:56,240
For me it's not even close for some guys
say was even better early on.

3295
02:14:56,270 --> 02:14:58,100
Dell's does.
They say it was even better.

3296
02:14:58,101 --> 02:15:02,330
Like I'm in the 80s they say like before
like the kittens and error,

3297
02:15:02,331 --> 02:15:05,690
like um,
dommo rare especially he says that like

3298
02:15:05,691 --> 02:15:08,060
there was a time when they were doing
three shows in the main room,

3299
02:15:08,061 --> 02:15:10,730
two shows in the or and they were just
rotating.

3300
02:15:10,731 --> 02:15:11,850
Just fuck.
Yeah.

3301
02:15:12,570 --> 02:15:15,190
But we're pretty close to that and I was
just going to say that's where we're

3302
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:18,770
knocking on that door to close two shows
in the main room all the time.

3303
02:15:18,771 --> 02:15:22,190
On the weekends we do two shows in the
or all the time on the weekends and

3304
02:15:22,191 --> 02:15:26,300
sometimes I've done four sets in a night
there where I did two shows in the main

3305
02:15:26,301 --> 02:15:28,010
room,
one show in the belly room in one show.

3306
02:15:28,011 --> 02:15:30,350
In the or.
That's fucking crazy.

3307
02:15:30,530 --> 02:15:33,010
Belly has developed itself and deal like
a real fucking great,

3308
02:15:33,670 --> 02:15:36,830
oh,
there's just so much creativity and fun

3309
02:15:36,831 --> 02:15:38,240
going on there.
That's what it is,

3310
02:15:38,390 --> 02:15:41,600
but you know I'm in the Improv is not
bad right now to the Improv has been

3311
02:15:41,601 --> 02:15:43,670
really good too.
It's like comedy is just like

3312
02:15:43,671 --> 02:15:45,680
experiencing it in a cool little bump.

3313
02:15:45,870 --> 02:15:46,703
Yeah,
it's wild.

3314
02:15:46,830 --> 02:15:48,450
I think people don't know how lucky they
are in la.

3315
02:15:48,451 --> 02:15:49,111
It's wild,
man.

3316
02:15:49,111 --> 02:15:50,460
People people live in La and they're
like,

3317
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:52,710
yeah,
how many guys are on tonight?

3318
02:15:52,740 --> 02:15:53,521
It's like,
well,

3319
02:15:53,521 --> 02:15:56,790
they're all going to be fucking amazing,
so stick around because everyone you're

3320
02:15:56,791 --> 02:15:58,530
going to see is going to be fucking good
comment.

3321
02:15:58,531 --> 02:15:59,670
I in a couple of that sock.

3322
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:01,070
Sure,
sure.

3323
02:16:01,490 --> 02:16:02,900
It's a few.
Sure.

3324
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:06,950
There's going to be a few.
There's a lot of a comedy tourism to

3325
02:16:07,790 --> 02:16:11,390
people coming here from Ireland,
Scotland and that's why it's strange

3326
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:13,040
like we've,
we flew over to watch the store.

3327
02:16:13,041 --> 02:16:14,990
Like what weird.

3328
02:16:15,930 --> 02:16:17,700
I hope that,
I hope our show helps that too,

3329
02:16:17,790 --> 02:16:19,920
because again,
it'll help push the idea of the store

3330
02:16:19,921 --> 02:16:23,640
being just another fucking iconic piece
that people don't know about.

3331
02:16:23,820 --> 02:16:25,140
You know,
for people that don't give a shit about

3332
02:16:25,141 --> 02:16:27,090
standup when they see this,
I think it'll be more like,

3333
02:16:27,690 --> 02:16:28,620
oh fuck,
that's kind of cool.

3334
02:16:28,621 --> 02:16:30,130
I'd like to go see more of that shit.
No.

3335
02:16:30,140 --> 02:16:31,990
Are you touring?
Are you going around the world?

3336
02:16:32,020 --> 02:16:35,440
What are you doing right now?
Because we're kind of waiting to hear

3337
02:16:35,441 --> 02:16:36,910
what showtime size.
If we're going to do this again,

3338
02:16:36,911 --> 02:16:38,440
that I have to fucking cancel a bunch of
dates,

3339
02:16:38,441 --> 02:16:42,850
but next week I go to Austin cap city,
then I go Chicago,

3340
02:16:42,851 --> 02:16:45,640
Denver,
just for laughs in Montreal.

3341
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:49,090
Raleigh,
some torn a little bit here into the

3342
02:16:49,090 --> 02:16:50,230
summer,
but if we have to shoot again,

3343
02:16:50,231 --> 02:16:51,640
I have to cancel a bunch of different
dates.

3344
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:52,630
No kidding.
Huh?

3345
02:16:52,630 --> 02:16:56,950
Showtime wastes of the first episode
airs to release any official

3346
02:16:57,190 --> 02:16:59,800
announcements to when is the first
episode Air Sunday baby.

3347
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:02,380
So if it does well on Sunday,
they make a choice.

3348
02:17:02,381 --> 02:17:04,080
Right?
Then in there it takes about,

3349
02:17:04,081 --> 02:17:04,760
you know,
it takes a,

3350
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:05,500
you know,
whatever,

3351
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:08,230
a little bit of fucking manipulation
time of them deciding what they want to

3352
02:17:08,231 --> 02:17:09,190
do.
But yeah,

3353
02:17:09,191 --> 02:17:12,040
usually shortly after the first episode
they talk about what's going to happen.

3354
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:15,100
So did you get a chance to watch it?
We did.

3355
02:17:15,101 --> 02:17:17,260
We saw it last night.
Last night was a premiere for like

3356
02:17:17,290 --> 02:17:20,560
internal for critics and shit.
Now it's fucking happy.

3357
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:22,870
Jim Carey said some fucking amazing
stuff.

3358
02:17:22,871 --> 02:17:24,400
He's an executive producer of the show
for,

3359
02:17:24,460 --> 02:17:25,750
I didn't,
I don't know if I said that earlier,

3360
02:17:25,751 --> 02:17:28,930
but he said some fucking really dope
shit man.

3361
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:31,510
He said how much this meant to him and
how,

3362
02:17:32,110 --> 02:17:34,080
how people don't really fucking know
some of the,

3363
02:17:34,150 --> 02:17:37,160
the true history of what that world was
like to perform for,

3364
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:38,193
for no money.

3365
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:40,360
And that,
that where there was one,

3366
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:44,650
there was one way in was Johnny Carson.
It was like you get on Carson,

3367
02:17:44,651 --> 02:17:46,450
it was like,
you are fucking on the moon dude.

3368
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:48,280
Wow.
And he talked about how

3369
02:17:50,290 --> 02:17:51,790
a lot of critics,
I guess,

3370
02:17:51,791 --> 02:17:52,391
Scott,
you know,

3371
02:17:52,391 --> 02:17:54,550
they got episodes a couple of weeks ago
and he said,

3372
02:17:54,551 --> 02:17:56,380
a lot of you guys have been saying the
word dark.

3373
02:17:57,130 --> 02:17:58,960
It's not a comedy.
He's like,

3374
02:17:58,961 --> 02:18:01,960
we never sold it as a comedy.
Never once did we promoted as a comedy.

3375
02:18:02,050 --> 02:18:04,990
It's a fucking dramatic show about the
world of comedy.

3376
02:18:05,350 --> 02:18:08,080
Is that funny?
Sometimes yet there's some really funny

3377
02:18:08,081 --> 02:18:10,960
fucking moments on our show,
but it's about the world that exists.

3378
02:18:10,961 --> 02:18:15,790
It's about what it's like to be fucking
23 and hungry and poor as fuck.

3379
02:18:16,090 --> 02:18:18,940
And trying to get pussy and trying to
get stage time and trying to figure out

3380
02:18:18,941 --> 02:18:20,110
what you're,
what you're doing,

3381
02:18:20,111 --> 02:18:20,950
who's beating you.

3382
02:18:20,950 --> 02:18:23,810
And it's just about fucking life.
The life of a standup,

3383
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:25,600
the life of a hustling,
hungry,

3384
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:27,190
angry,
angsty,

3385
02:18:27,550 --> 02:18:28,840
jealous,
fucking stand up.

3386
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:31,930
Cause we all go through that shit dude.
I'm excited.

3387
02:18:31,931 --> 02:18:35,440
I want to watch it right now.
It's fucking,

3388
02:18:35,441 --> 02:18:36,760
dude.
I really hope people enjoy it.

3389
02:18:36,761 --> 02:18:38,380
And I think the first episode is
powerful is shit.

3390
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:40,990
We have some do the at the pilot is
insane.

3391
02:18:40,991 --> 02:18:41,824
We have,
um,

3392
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:45,640
Robert Forester,
Cathy Moriarty from raging bull.

3393
02:18:45,910 --> 02:18:49,660
Melissa Leo is the
matriarch of the show.

3394
02:18:49,661 --> 02:18:52,630
She,
she plays Goldie who runs our comedy

3395
02:18:52,631 --> 02:18:54,130
club,
um,

3396
02:18:54,730 --> 02:18:57,520
who is a variation of Mitzi,
but she wouldn't say that we,

3397
02:18:57,521 --> 02:18:59,680
we're on our own space.
Um,

3398
02:18:59,830 --> 02:19:02,500
Ari Grainer,
Michael Lang Carano there's some fucking

3399
02:19:02,710 --> 02:19:04,450
just bangers on the show.
People that are,

3400
02:19:04,570 --> 02:19:07,480
they act their mind out that are just
fucking really good man.

3401
02:19:07,481 --> 02:19:09,790
And I'm jealous you,
I've sit along with those people and I'm

3402
02:19:09,791 --> 02:19:10,450
like,
fuck me.

3403
02:19:10,450 --> 02:19:12,790
These people are really good actors.
That's awesome.

3404
02:19:12,850 --> 02:19:13,660
Yeah.
Melissa was,

3405
02:19:13,660 --> 02:19:16,210
Melissa was the best worker that she
want to fucking academy where mentioned

3406
02:19:16,230 --> 02:19:18,580
won an Oscar for the fighter.
So it's like being around a fucking

3407
02:19:18,670 --> 02:19:21,130
human that won an Oscar is crazy.
Wow.

3408
02:19:21,460 --> 02:19:22,750
It's wow.
Because I never be,

3409
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:24,730
moriarty was enraging pool man.
Yeah.

3410
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:26,470
Man was also in the dice clay's show.
Yeah.

3411
02:19:26,890 --> 02:19:27,401
That,
uh,

3412
02:19:27,401 --> 02:19:28,880
what is it?
What was the name of the show?

3413
02:19:28,881 --> 02:19:30,140
Bless this house.
Lester's house.

3414
02:19:30,170 --> 02:19:31,280
Yeah,
that's right.

3415
02:19:31,281 --> 02:19:33,410
She was nice.
His wife Alfred fucking Molina.

3416
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:34,460
You know him.
Alfred Molina,

3417
02:19:34,461 --> 02:19:35,720
he's the shit.
He's in it too.

3418
02:19:35,721 --> 02:19:39,170
I mean we have dave,
they pulled out a few big names and you

3419
02:19:39,171 --> 02:19:42,270
always want to act or did you want to do
stand up or did you want to do both?

3420
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:45,230
When I went to school,
I went to school to,

3421
02:19:45,290 --> 02:19:48,230
to write to do journalism and English
and I knew I wanted to write and

3422
02:19:48,231 --> 02:19:50,210
perform,
but I was a pussy about performing in

3423
02:19:50,211 --> 02:19:50,510
school.

3424
02:19:50,510 --> 02:19:52,610
So I did a fall,
a few plays cause I really want it to be

3425
02:19:52,611 --> 02:19:54,920
on stage,
but I didn't like the idea of place.

3426
02:19:54,921 --> 02:19:59,390
I just wanted to get on stage to like
get my comfort level up and the w and

3427
02:19:59,391 --> 02:20:01,640
the training wheels he had do it.
And one of the fucking,

3428
02:20:01,880 --> 02:20:05,060
one of the teachers pulled me aside one
day and she was like,

3429
02:20:05,420 --> 02:20:07,010
you know,
you could actually be a good actor if

3430
02:20:07,011 --> 02:20:09,320
you didn't just fuck around when you got
onstage.

3431
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:10,910
And I was like,
well I,

3432
02:20:11,060 --> 02:20:12,740
I really want to fuck around on stage.
She's like,

3433
02:20:12,741 --> 02:20:15,080
well then why don't you go do that for a
living and no shit.

3434
02:20:15,110 --> 02:20:16,490
I was like,
I'm gonna try.

3435
02:20:16,970 --> 02:20:18,770
And I knew I wanted to do standup so
bad.

3436
02:20:18,771 --> 02:20:19,940
And I moved.
When I moved to La,

3437
02:20:19,970 --> 02:20:23,730
I started in La and I was like,
I'm either going to sink or swim and I

3438
02:20:23,731 --> 02:20:24,564
just start,
what year?

3439
02:20:24,830 --> 02:20:28,100
2000.
I moved here 2000 at the end of 2006 I

3440
02:20:28,101 --> 02:20:32,390
lived on a guy's fucking lazy boy in
Long Beach and I used to drive up my

3441
02:20:32,391 --> 02:20:33,920
buddy's truck every single fucking
night.

3442
02:20:33,980 --> 02:20:36,170
I drop him off at the casino.
He was a professional gambler.

3443
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:38,300
I drop him off the casino,
take his truck,

3444
02:20:38,301 --> 02:20:40,640
cause I didn't have car money.
Do fucking Mike's,

3445
02:20:40,641 --> 02:20:43,880
go to the store and get intimidated,
uh,

3446
02:20:43,910 --> 02:20:45,980
learn some lessons and then fucking
drive back home,

3447
02:20:45,981 --> 02:20:47,240
pick him up and we fell asleep,
you know,

3448
02:20:47,241 --> 02:20:48,860
could get a burrito and do it all over
again.

3449
02:20:48,890 --> 02:20:51,050
That's wild man.
So you started really coming to the

3450
02:20:51,051 --> 02:20:52,910
store when I was gone.
Yeah.

3451
02:20:52,911 --> 02:20:56,240
It was like 2007 as you weren't around,
put your legacy was there.

3452
02:20:56,840 --> 02:20:59,990
You know what I mean?
Like it was like we all knew those that

3453
02:20:59,991 --> 02:21:01,670
came before us and we,
those that we talked about.

3454
02:21:01,670 --> 02:21:04,970
But it was like I was right there when
you were,

3455
02:21:05,390 --> 02:21:08,750
when you had kind of left that left that
world a little bit,

3456
02:21:09,380 --> 02:21:13,430
but it's wild because it was like I
hated the store when I first started to

3457
02:21:13,910 --> 02:21:16,070
two thousand six thousand seven it was
fucking awful.

3458
02:21:16,430 --> 02:21:18,020
The people above us,
I didn't,

3459
02:21:18,050 --> 02:21:22,340
none of the older comics where that
fucking nice divide was negative as

3460
02:21:22,341 --> 02:21:25,430
shit.
There wasn't a lot of crowds.

3461
02:21:25,550 --> 02:21:27,170
Delvin Mike's,
we're fucking brutal.

3462
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:29,300
They were miserable.
They barely got watched.

3463
02:21:30,290 --> 02:21:32,090
You know?
It's just so many negative things about

3464
02:21:32,091 --> 02:21:34,550
that place at the time that I was,
we were going through it and then it

3465
02:21:34,551 --> 02:21:37,880
slowly kind of turned into this,
you know what we've seen now,

3466
02:21:37,881 --> 02:21:40,640
which is just fucking amazing.
We see now it's crazy.

3467
02:21:40,641 --> 02:21:44,320
You pull into the parking lot is jam.
The haulers are jammed with people and

3468
02:21:44,321 --> 02:21:46,040
it makes me smile from fucking year that
year.

3469
02:21:46,050 --> 02:21:47,690
Heared right.
Isn't it weird?

3470
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:49,990
It's weird.
It's weird.

3471
02:21:50,060 --> 02:21:52,490
I've been there since 94 minutes.
Never been like this.

3472
02:21:52,491 --> 02:21:54,560
This is a totally different thing.
It's just,

3473
02:21:54,620 --> 02:21:56,180
you know what?
It still does to me.

3474
02:21:56,390 --> 02:21:59,360
This is the truth.
You kind of get desensitized to shit,

3475
02:21:59,630 --> 02:22:03,320
but seeing my name up on the fucking up
on the board when it's a pack night,

3476
02:22:03,620 --> 02:22:06,260
it still gets me like,
I still get excited.

3477
02:22:06,261 --> 02:22:07,280
I'm like,
that's fucking cool.

3478
02:22:07,281 --> 02:22:11,600
I'm a part of this moment in time and
comedy at that fucking club,

3479
02:22:11,601 --> 02:22:13,070
in my opinion,
the club,

3480
02:22:14,060 --> 02:22:15,290
it's just something else,
man.

3481
02:22:15,470 --> 02:22:18,920
There's something powerful as shit.
That's sometimes I walk to the club

3482
02:22:18,921 --> 02:22:21,170
because I live in the neighborhood and,
and I like to walk instead of drive

3483
02:22:21,171 --> 02:22:24,380
because it helps me get out of my brain
and uh,

3484
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:26,040
time I fucking walk

3485
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:26,821
up that,
you know,

3486
02:22:26,821 --> 02:22:29,160
and I see my name up there.
There's like a fucking overwhelming

3487
02:22:29,170 --> 02:22:30,900
feeling.
The moment I see it,

3488
02:22:30,901 --> 02:22:32,280
it's like this is,
you know,

3489
02:22:32,630 --> 02:22:35,820
soak it in a little bit cause it's
fucking doesn't last forever.

3490
02:22:36,150 --> 02:22:38,550
It's nice to have a place that's like
that too.

3491
02:22:38,610 --> 02:22:43,590
Like to just have one place that stands
out as something that means more than

3492
02:22:43,591 --> 02:22:45,150
just a comedy club.
It's like,

3493
02:22:45,151 --> 02:22:46,080
it's,
it's,

3494
02:22:46,110 --> 02:22:48,690
it's an iconic thing.
Yeah.

3495
02:22:48,750 --> 02:22:50,490
There's,
there's something about that place.

3496
02:22:50,491 --> 02:22:52,920
Like we're at the store.
It's bigger than comedy,

3497
02:22:52,921 --> 02:22:53,780
man.
It's,

3498
02:22:54,040 --> 02:22:54,660
it's,
it's,

3499
02:22:54,660 --> 02:22:55,321
it's,
it's like,

3500
02:22:55,321 --> 02:22:57,040
uh,
it's something,

3501
02:22:57,160 --> 02:22:58,860
it's something big.
It's something fucking special,

3502
02:22:58,861 --> 02:22:59,250
man.
Well,

3503
02:22:59,250 --> 02:23:02,940
pauline and I were talking about this
and I told him that your moms,

3504
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,970
one of the most important people ever in
comedy period,

3505
02:23:06,300 --> 02:23:08,790
like ever one of the most influential
humans in the,

3506
02:23:09,250 --> 02:23:11,760
in the comedy world,
in the world of what we know today.

3507
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:14,220
A standup comedy.
Yes.

3508
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:15,073
Mitzi.
Sure.

3509
02:23:15,260 --> 02:23:18,810
Like without her,
like stop and think about what other

3510
02:23:18,811 --> 02:23:23,811
comedy club owner has had the kind of
influence even remotely similar to what

3511
02:23:24,031 --> 02:23:26,070
she's had.
I would know none of the above.

3512
02:23:26,100 --> 02:23:26,550
I mean,
I mean,

3513
02:23:26,550 --> 02:23:28,860
I guess the only person that you could
bring into that namesake,

3514
02:23:28,890 --> 02:23:31,530
maybe budd Friedman from the emperor,
maybe because he did evening at the

3515
02:23:31,531 --> 02:23:32,940
Improv,
any of the Monaco and everything like

3516
02:23:32,941 --> 02:23:35,100
that.
But I don't think in the hardcore sense

3517
02:23:35,101 --> 02:23:37,470
it's not a clothes won't be the same.
No,

3518
02:23:38,010 --> 02:23:39,390
but but,
but yeah,

3519
02:23:39,690 --> 02:23:43,320
what she did was shape and revolutionize
the business that you know today.

3520
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:46,050
She knew how to do it,
to leave it up to the Comedians,

3521
02:23:46,051 --> 02:23:49,890
leave him alone,
and then also give them hard spots

3522
02:23:50,320 --> 02:23:52,080
making going to come work for them,
work for it.

3523
02:23:52,081 --> 02:23:53,730
That was the,
that's the best part about that club.

3524
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:54,960
You think someone's funny,
good.

3525
02:23:54,961 --> 02:23:57,370
Put them on after dice or put them on
after you know,

3526
02:23:57,510 --> 02:23:59,490
whoever the fuck it was at the time that
was killing.

3527
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:00,960
See how funny they are after Richard
Pryor.

3528
02:24:00,990 --> 02:24:02,070
Exactly.
Yeah.

3529
02:24:02,071 --> 02:24:04,620
See how funny they are after someone
just destroys.

3530
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:08,100
He just got to go up to this wasteland
of the audience.

3531
02:24:08,820 --> 02:24:10,590
That's such a testament about that club
too.

3532
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:13,620
It's what they've always done.
You'd I feel it.

3533
02:24:13,710 --> 02:24:18,710
Plates of Shit in that place.
There's just no way around it following

3534
02:24:20,041 --> 02:24:23,100
everybody,
following anybody's I filed prior for

3535
02:24:23,101 --> 02:24:25,140
five weeks.
Fuck when?

3536
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:28,800
When prior was in a wheelchair so they
would have to carry him to the stage.

3537
02:24:29,610 --> 02:24:30,690
It was,
it was dark.

3538
02:24:30,970 --> 02:24:32,490
You know,
it'd be really funny for if you had to

3539
02:24:32,491 --> 02:24:34,560
go on and you had to carry him off and
then do your set,

3540
02:24:35,710 --> 02:24:38,740
like just start it,
start it from the crowd carried out.

3541
02:24:39,150 --> 02:24:40,490
Yeah.
It was a,

3542
02:24:41,030 --> 02:24:43,050
but that,
that philosophy that she had that make

3543
02:24:43,051 --> 02:24:46,770
you work for it make you sink or swim.
So important.

3544
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:50,640
Because if people that we know to this
day that are scared to have tough spots

3545
02:24:50,700 --> 02:24:52,590
and we know those people totally,
they will,

3546
02:24:52,591 --> 02:24:54,660
they see somebody like Joey Diaz in the
lineup and they're like,

3547
02:24:54,740 --> 02:24:56,250
oh,
I'm going to go for a drive.

3548
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:58,890
I'll be back in a little bit.
They'll let somebody else take their

3549
02:24:58,891 --> 02:25:00,820
spot and they come in and they check.
Oh,

3550
02:25:00,990 --> 02:25:02,180
oh,
is he up?

3551
02:25:02,370 --> 02:25:03,240
Oh,
I miss my spot.

3552
02:25:03,450 --> 02:25:05,040
Am I on next?
I thought you were just here.

3553
02:25:05,070 --> 02:25:06,030
What'd you go?
Yeah.

3554
02:25:06,031 --> 02:25:07,860
You hid from Joey Diaz.
Motherfucker.

3555
02:25:09,930 --> 02:25:13,950
The only way to go up after Joey Diaz is
to fucking,

3556
02:25:14,250 --> 02:25:16,500
is to just ride that line.
You got to ride the wave.

3557
02:25:16,530 --> 02:25:18,390
You gotta.
You have to enjoy him.

3558
02:25:18,391 --> 02:25:20,410
You have to have fun.
I fucking love watching him.

3559
02:25:20,411 --> 02:25:21,570
Yeah.
But that's what I'm saying,

3560
02:25:21,571 --> 02:25:25,270
like the problem with comics when it
comes to those sorts of situations is

3561
02:25:25,510 --> 02:25:29,500
you see someone killing and for some
reason you think that's taking away from

3562
02:25:29,501 --> 02:25:31,330
your ability to be funny.
It's a weird,

3563
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:32,500
the opposite.
Yes.

3564
02:25:32,650 --> 02:25:36,610
They want you to win with someone.
Let them know that you're there to win

3565
02:25:36,611 --> 02:25:38,940
again instead of,
Oh,

3566
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:42,310
I can't fucking follow that.
Not going to talk about what joy is

3567
02:25:42,700 --> 02:25:44,920
going to be disappointing.
Don't get your hopes up.

3568
02:25:45,070 --> 02:25:45,990
Yeah.
Oh,

3569
02:25:46,150 --> 02:25:47,590
well good.
I'm glad you set yourself up.

3570
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:49,060
Yeah,
it's fucking,

3571
02:25:49,390 --> 02:25:52,960
you also should be going up laughing
like it should be fun that something

3572
02:25:52,961 --> 02:25:56,530
happens to some comedians along the line
where they stopped being fans of comedy.

3573
02:25:57,020 --> 02:25:58,660
Like why did you get into this in the
first place?

3574
02:25:58,661 --> 02:26:00,150
Didn't you like watching it?
Right.

3575
02:26:00,220 --> 02:26:02,590
It wasn't going to stop watching it.
Now that you're a pro,

3576
02:26:02,591 --> 02:26:05,980
that's crazy.
It wasn't because of all the billions of

3577
02:26:05,980 --> 02:26:07,000
dollars that you thought you were going
to make.

3578
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:08,580
You know what I mean?
Nobody got in was like,

3579
02:26:08,581 --> 02:26:10,180
dude,
I can't wait to make so much fucking

3580
02:26:10,181 --> 02:26:12,170
bank on this shit.
Yeah,

3581
02:26:12,200 --> 02:26:14,800
no one's getting into comedy for that.
Although it can be done.

3582
02:26:14,830 --> 02:26:17,050
You Know Kevin Hart,
it can be done,

3583
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:20,170
but that's not why you get into it.
But it's like what we're talking about

3584
02:26:20,171 --> 02:26:23,200
earlier,
it's like people that are trying to get

3585
02:26:23,201 --> 02:26:27,040
the limelight.
It's that weird depressing thing versus

3586
02:26:27,041 --> 02:26:29,890
someone who's just like,
I'm just trying to do my best shit.

3587
02:26:30,160 --> 02:26:32,140
Just tone it.
Trying to put out my best,

3588
02:26:32,530 --> 02:26:35,440
my best stand up product.
I just want to pump out what I'm proud

3589
02:26:35,441 --> 02:26:35,980
of.

3590
02:26:35,980 --> 02:26:37,460
Just hammer that bitch.
Just one.

3591
02:26:37,461 --> 02:26:39,730
I'll fucking punch him enough fucking
head.

3592
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:41,080
Does the,
uh,

3593
02:26:41,110 --> 02:26:43,360
does the showtime special have your,
your rock bit,

3594
02:26:43,390 --> 02:26:44,620
the bit on the rock?
It's on.

3595
02:26:44,650 --> 02:26:48,490
It's on showtime right now on the south
by southwest to tour that.

3596
02:26:48,491 --> 02:26:50,460
I did.
They do the fucking behind the scenes of

3597
02:26:50,470 --> 02:26:54,040
south by southwest and I did a bit at
the showcase for south by southwest and

3598
02:26:54,041 --> 02:26:56,030
I put it up on there.
Is it in your showtime specialist?

3599
02:26:56,070 --> 02:26:57,400
Not Dude,
it's just on that.

3600
02:26:57,490 --> 02:26:59,930
How is that possible?
Because I did that first and showtime

3601
02:26:59,950 --> 02:27:01,690
put that up and I,
so what?

3602
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:04,990
I know I should have done it again.
I know.

3603
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:08,170
It's so good.
I should have done it again,

3604
02:27:08,200 --> 02:27:09,910
mother fucker.
I thought of you actually.

3605
02:27:09,911 --> 02:27:10,840
That's right.
I thought he,

3606
02:27:10,870 --> 02:27:11,351
I was like,
God,

3607
02:27:11,351 --> 02:27:13,270
I should have done that Joe.
I bet you fucking Joe.

3608
02:27:13,990 --> 02:27:15,730
Joe would have said,
I should have told against so many

3609
02:27:15,731 --> 02:27:17,530
people about that bit.
That's a funny bit.

3610
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:20,050
But the beauty is it links to it.
So it's on showtime so they can watch my

3611
02:27:20,051 --> 02:27:22,360
other set and all that stuff.
That's another 15 minutes that I didn't

3612
02:27:22,361 --> 02:27:24,220
put in my special that I did at south
by.

3613
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:25,480
Oh really?
Oh really?

3614
02:27:25,481 --> 02:27:27,310
Let's get that shit on youtube.
Somebody.

3615
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:30,650
Somebody won't rank wink,
wink knows at a strip things down.

3616
02:27:30,651 --> 02:27:32,810
I know that underground,
uh,

3617
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:35,710
no.
What does that say no more?

3618
02:27:35,711 --> 02:27:37,570
Is that under my first album?
That's my old album.

3619
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:39,310
When did you put on an album?
What year was this?

3620
02:27:39,340 --> 02:27:41,530
It was two years ago.
That was my first album that I put out.

3621
02:27:43,510 --> 02:27:46,000
Say No more,
Andrew Santina saying no more.

3622
02:27:46,330 --> 02:27:47,163
All right.
That's not it.

3623
02:27:47,250 --> 02:27:48,910
Let's,
let's bring this bitch home.

3624
02:27:48,911 --> 02:27:53,050
So a baby.
So the show starts Sunday.

3625
02:27:53,050 --> 02:27:54,670
That's my first air.
I'm dying up here.

3626
02:27:54,671 --> 02:27:57,520
Starts Sunday on showtime and a,
if you're a fan of comedy,

3627
02:27:57,580 --> 02:27:59,310
we definitely want that to keep going.
So let's,

3628
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:02,110
let's try a sport.
That thing and Andrew Santina was comedy

3629
02:28:02,111 --> 02:28:05,670
special called home field advantage
comes out this Friday tomorrow baby.

3630
02:28:05,740 --> 02:28:07,600
You're one of my favorite up and coming
guys.

3631
02:28:07,630 --> 02:28:10,320
I think you're a fucking hilariously
talented guy.

3632
02:28:10,321 --> 02:28:12,130
Thank you.
So it means a lot coming from you.

3633
02:28:12,131 --> 02:28:14,200
That means a ton to thank you brother.
My man.

3634
02:28:14,770 --> 02:28:18,370
All right folks.
We'll be back tomorrow with Bret

3635
02:28:18,370 --> 02:28:21,950
Weinstein and Bret Weinstein is that
college professor is being kicked out of

3636
02:28:21,951 --> 02:28:22,280
school

3637
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:26,090
because he's been forced out of school
because they actually closed evergreen

3638
02:28:26,091 --> 02:28:30,020
college down today because of threats
the students have taken over the college

3639
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:34,640
and that he was forced out because he
wasn't willing to participate in a white

3640
02:28:34,641 --> 02:28:37,790
stay home day.
They want it all white people,

3641
02:28:37,940 --> 02:28:40,430
all people of white privilege to stay
home and he's like,

3642
02:28:40,431 --> 02:28:43,310
that's ridiculous.
I'm not going to not teach because I'm

3643
02:28:43,311 --> 02:28:46,100
white.
And this guy's like a super progressive

3644
02:28:46,101 --> 02:28:47,240
guy too,
which is really crazy.

3645
02:28:47,241 --> 02:28:49,820
They're attacking him.
There's screaming in the hallways,

3646
02:28:50,060 --> 02:28:52,910
hey,
hey Ho Ho this racist teacher has got to

3647
02:28:52,911 --> 02:28:54,770
go.
They're calling them racist.

3648
02:28:55,160 --> 02:28:57,110
We are.
We are almost at the breaking point of

3649
02:28:57,111 --> 02:29:00,140
political correctness to Bret Weinstein
tomorrow about that.

3650
02:29:00,141 --> 02:29:02,990
And he's also brilliant professor with a
lot of other important stuff to talk

3651
02:29:02,991 --> 02:29:03,980
about.
So we'll see you soon.

3652
02:29:03,981 --> 02:29:04,814
Bye.
Bye.

3653
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:07,373
That was awesome.

3654
02:29:18,490 --> 02:29:18,670
Hmm.
