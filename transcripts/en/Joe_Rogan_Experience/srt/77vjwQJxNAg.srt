1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,350
Like there's a whole network of them,

2
00:00:01,351 --> 00:00:01,950
you know,

3
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,120
I've done Doug Benson's and Duncan
trussell's and Duncan will be on the show

4
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:08,310
tomorrow at three o'clock you know,

5
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:10,080
and did Mark Marin's and it's a,

6
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:11,760
I'm going to do Eddie F and M,

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,750
Jim Jefferies.

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,520
So like doing all these podcasts,

9
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:14,940
it's like,

10
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,773
you know,

11
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,740
it's like there's this cool network
of radio stations that's happening

12
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:20,640
organically,

13
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,061
you know,

14
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:23,790
instead of like Bubba the
love sponge and you know,

15
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:27,360
the Farell show all being stuffed
into one thing by a corporation.

16
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,900
Like everybody's kind of found themselves
and become like this network sort of

17
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:31,734
organically.

18
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,311
You know,

19
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:32,731
it's cool.

20
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:32,911
You know,

21
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:36,120
like fans of one we'll
hear about the other,

22
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:36,331
you know,

23
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:38,370
like Duncan Trussell got some fans when,

24
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,000
when you know,

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,510
he came and did this podcast and
I came and did his and you know,

26
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,030
we share each other's listeners and stuff.

27
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:45,200
It's,

28
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,500
it's really a fucking,

29
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,030
a very unique thing.

30
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,331
You know,

31
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:48,471
the,

32
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:49,530
this podcasting,

33
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,393
and as we said,

34
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,440
it probably wouldn't have
happened if it wasn't for Adam,

35
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,990
you know,

36
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,320
him,

37
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:53,701
him.

38
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:57,990
And I'm also an Anthony Kumina from opie
and Anthony because Anthony was doing

39
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,840
that lie from the compound thing
and that was green and Tom Green.

40
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:01,061
Yeah,

41
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:01,320
yeah,

42
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,771
absolutely.

43
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:01,941
Yeah.

44
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:02,160
Yeah.

45
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,150
Can't forget Tom Grant.

46
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,230
Yeah.

47
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:04,850
Tom Green,

48
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:05,100
uh,

49
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,761
doing his,

50
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:06,240
uh,

51
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,980
his show on Tom green.com,

52
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:08,150
which,

53
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,360
yeah,

54
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,270
I don't think it does anymore.

55
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:09,451
I,

56
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:09,781
yeah,

57
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:11,430
I'm not really sure what he does anymore.

58
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,410
I think he went to some kind
of subscription based things,

59
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:14,160
so I kind of,

60
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,760
I don't know.

61
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,700
Did you hear completely
getting off subject?

62
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:19,830
Did you hear what happened in Afghanistan?

63
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,530
The Taliban escaping out of the prison?

64
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:22,791
No.

65
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:23,250
What happened,

66
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:23,671
dude?

67
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:25,770
Some guy tweeted me this thing
and the guy who tweeted it,

68
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:26,604
it was really funny.

69
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,121
He said,

70
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:27,570
uh,

71
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,830
and a referee,

72
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,371
let's fucking,

73
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:30,600
what was his exact quote?

74
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,350
I don't want to fuck up this guy's quote
because it was such a funny situation.

75
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,370
Um,

76
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:35,880
they,

77
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,390
uh,

78
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,070
they dug 450 Taliban
fighters w escaped out of,

79
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:41,470
uh,

80
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,303
here's what he wrote.

81
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,530
He wrote 450 plus prisoners break out
of jail by digging a hole in the ground

82
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,960
and homage to bugs bunny
and raising Arizona.

83
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,860
The guy's name is Gary with two r's,

84
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:53,694
whoever.

85
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,710
And uh,

86
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,190
so I retweeted it and then I,

87
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:56,550
uh,

88
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,151
read the,

89
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:57,241
uh,

90
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:59,670
the link and it is pretty
fucking fascinating.

91
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:01,950
These guys dug a hole in the ground,

92
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,910
like a fucking movie and went under
the prison and got all the guys out of

93
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:06,390
prison.

94
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,223
Wow.

95
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,620
Yeah.

96
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:07,891
Did,

97
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:08,190
uh,

98
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,023
did they catch him?

99
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:09,780
No,

100
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,140
no.

101
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:10,441
I mean,

102
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:10,921
not yet,

103
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:11,161
but I mean,

104
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:12,980
just the whole thing and Afghanistan is,

105
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,321
I mean,

106
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:16,290
who's the fucking bad guy
over there and no escape.

107
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,160
They were all murdered.

108
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,110
These fucking guys are running around
with sandals on and the in the,

109
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:21,570
in the mountains and you know,

110
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:23,460
we've got drones flying overhead,

111
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:26,700
taking pictures of him shooting
missiles and the hundreds of thousand,

112
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:29,280
who knows how many thousands
of fucking soldiers over there?

113
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,183
Who's the bad guy?

114
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,721
I don't know.

115
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:32,190
It gets a little fucking blurry.

116
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,500
Right.

117
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:32,730
You know,

118
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,241
I don't know.

119
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:33,451
I mean,

120
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:33,691
you know,

121
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:33,871
they're,

122
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:34,081
they're,

123
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:34,291
they're,

124
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:34,591
they're,

125
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:36,900
they're evil terrorists and
they're attacking the Americans.

126
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,200
Well,

127
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,310
what are we doing over there?

128
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,790
Well,

129
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,600
you don't think you could.

130
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,070
You think you can just come
into someone's neighborhood.

131
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:42,150
They don't fucking shoot at you.

132
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,920
You can't just take over.

133
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,970
And then when you take over,

134
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:46,680
people fight back and
when they fight back,

135
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:46,771
well,

136
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:47,820
who's the fucking bad guys?

137
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:51,210
It's some kid who was born in
Afghanistan and this is only knows,

138
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:51,811
and this is the,

139
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:54,000
the neighborhood he grew up in and
all of a sudden he sees he's fucking

140
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:54,661
helicopters,

141
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:56,610
fly overhead and tanks
rolling around on the ground.

142
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,920
What would you think you think
you'd been invaded and the bad guy?

143
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:00,251
It's,

144
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:00,821
it's very,

145
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:01,990
very tricky man.

146
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:02,381
I mean,

147
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:05,920
I obviously never would want anything
bad to happen to any of our troops

148
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:06,640
overseas,

149
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,670
but I also don't want them to do
anything bad to all these fucking people

150
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:09,911
either.

151
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,210
The whole thing's a cluster fuck.

152
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,370
Who knows how many people have become
terrorists because of all the shit that

153
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,240
we've done overseas.

154
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:16,751
Who am I?

155
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:18,910
Who knows how many people lost
family members whom I know,

156
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,360
who knows how many people who would have
been like a sort of a moderate person

157
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:22,811
who really,

158
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:23,141
you know,

159
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:24,550
wouldn't get into this kind of stuff,

160
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,930
got drawn into it because a tragedy
got drawn into it because you,

161
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,920
someone they'd know or they get to watch,

162
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,341
you know,

163
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:33,670
video footage when you're dealing with
shit like what's going on in Iraq,

164
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:33,880
dude,

165
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,380
there's like a million dead people over
there over the course of the nine years

166
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:39,130
of this war or whatever.

167
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:39,920
It's been.

168
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,020
Million people have died.

169
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,180
That's an insane number of people.

170
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,421
I mean,

171
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:45,420
if you stacked a million bodies up in the,

172
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:48,760
in the middle of like Washington
state park and had everybody look,

173
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,080
here's everyone that's died in Iraq,

174
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,400
maybe then it would sink in.

175
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,360
Maybe then people would really kind of
realize how crazy war is in fact that

176
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:59,230
this is really how we have to do things
in 2011 you know what's crazy is that I

177
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:02,320
didn't know about that and it would
seem that that's something I should know

178
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:02,650
about.

179
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,000
You know a million people died in Iraq.

180
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,191
No,

181
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:04,331
no,

182
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:04,630
no.

183
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,250
About this new story you did,

184
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,090
but the other day I'm eating and it's
like we have breaking news here and now

185
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,890
we're going to go live
downtown Los Angeles.

186
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,140
Lindsay Lohan is going to jail.

187
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,900
Let's re let's interview this
sheriff and Blah Blah Blah.

188
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,501
And then it was like,

189
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:17,771
wow,

190
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:18,460
this is crazy.

191
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:18,810
Why?

192
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,210
What?

193
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,190
They spent like five minutes
on it and then you go,

194
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,800
all right now for another
top news story today,

195
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,690
the wedding of the century,

196
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,180
and it's those people that
are getting married in the UK,

197
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:29,530
the prints or whatever.

198
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:30,610
Have you heard about this shit?

199
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:33,790
I've very peripherally saw it's about it.

200
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,910
Every single news channel here
in the United States and I,

201
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,000
why do I care about some
prints getting married?

202
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,863
Like why is this?

203
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,700
Because people love gossip.

204
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,770
The news has become like people magazine.

205
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,770
I mean when you're talking
about two wars going on,

206
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,280
plus Libya plus actions
in Pakistan with drones,

207
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,460
there's a lot of crazy shit going
on every fucking day of the week.

208
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,353
A lot of it.

209
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,630
If you're hearing anything at all about
Lindsay Lohan and she hasn't killed 50

210
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,170
people.

211
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,990
I know there's something
wrong and I didn't know more
about Lindsay Lohan than I

212
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:04,050
do about fucking all these distributors.

213
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Do you think that that is because
that the networks are trying to,

214
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:09,910
you know,

215
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,890
make the,

216
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:11,221
the,

217
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:16,221
the easiest to digest sort of programs
after people are tired from work and just

218
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:17,500
give them,

219
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,030
give the dummies what they want.

220
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,480
Is it because the dummies want this or
it's because that's the only thing that's

221
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:23,580
on the air is it,

222
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,810
they have a mentality
that people are dumb.

223
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,820
And in pushing all this Lindsay Lohan,

224
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:28,420
Shit,

225
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:28,601
look,

226
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,141
here's the thing,

227
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:29,351
man.

228
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,490
I can get into it too.

229
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,040
You know,

230
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,171
I,

231
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:32,050
I understand it.

232
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:32,261
I mean,

233
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:33,490
I don't judge people for like,

234
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,040
Mrs Rogan likes to gossip
magazines sometimes.

235
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:36,461
She likes it,

236
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,930
like reading about things
every now and then.

237
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,771
And uh,

238
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,071
you know,

239
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:39,581
and I don't,

240
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:39,721
I,

241
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:40,690
I make fun of it.

242
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,441
I make fun of it,

243
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,940
but I'll fuck if I'm taking a shit,

244
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:43,870
I'll start reading it,

245
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,321
you know,

246
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:44,950
and I'll start reading.

247
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,220
Damn,

248
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,240
we just left it like that.

249
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,110
And what is she doing?

250
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,531
Oh man,

251
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:48,760
she's fucking that guy now.

252
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,181
Whoa,

253
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:49,811
this is crazy.

254
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:50,591
And now she's got a baby.

255
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:51,424
I bet he's mad.

256
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,470
You know,

257
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:52,860
it's,

258
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,693
it's easy.

259
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,830
We have instincts to gossip
and we have instincts to,

260
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:57,664
to follow,

261
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,161
you know,

262
00:05:58,161 --> 00:05:59,660
silly fucking stories in the news.

263
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:02,480
Whether it's about the princess
or especially when it's royalty.

264
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:03,620
That's when it's so squirrelly.

265
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,700
It's like that prince,

266
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,470
that guy doesn't do shit.

267
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,000
He doesn't do shit.

268
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,200
He's a prince.

269
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,591
I mean,

270
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:10,790
he hasn't done anything.

271
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,080
He hasn't been elected.

272
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,780
He hasn't written some awesome
books that everybody loves.

273
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,240
This guy has only famous
because he's a prince.

274
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,721
I mean,

275
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,330
that's just fucking completely insane.

276
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,310
That's that when you get into royalty,

277
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:26,870
it's the ultimate form of celebrity
in entitled celebrity for no reason.

278
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,410
At least Kim Kardashians suck some Dick.

279
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,580
You know what I mean?

280
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,970
And he's can masturbate to that.

281
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,301
Yeah.

282
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:32,541
Well,

283
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:32,841
you know,

284
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:36,800
everybody talks about how Kim got the
oceans become famous over nothing sort of,

285
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,630
but no,

286
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,150
no.

287
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,200
So you became famous because she lent
that black guy fucked the shit out of her

288
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:42,711
on camera.

289
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:42,980
Yeah,

290
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,310
but she is now making millions
and millions and millions
of dollars and then you

291
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:51,170
have like these girls work in like Joanna
Hayes that's not making millions and

292
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,610
millions of millions of dollars and
she pretty much does the same shit.

293
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,090
She did it once.

294
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,080
She did it once and it was her boyfriend
and then it caught on quite God out.

295
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,610
Who knows what their family's making?

296
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:01,170
17 what million?

297
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,251
Who knows how much?

298
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:03,084
It's a lot of money.

299
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,290
They're making a lot of money.

300
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,101
They're making a lot of money.

301
00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:06,180
She's everywhere.

302
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,160
But who you know?

303
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,080
Who knows who the fuck put that video out.

304
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,160
You can't really,

305
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,210
maybe she did.

306
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,811
Maybe she did.

307
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:13,590
Maybe he did.

308
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,280
Who knows?

309
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,480
Maybe someone else got ahold of it.

310
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:16,020
Who knows?

311
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,460
But the the,

312
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,290
the point is if we,

313
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,600
even if we knew like that
you put it out on purpose,

314
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,740
it's okay still.

315
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,680
It's like people gas.

316
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,790
As long as you say that you
didn't put it on purpose,

317
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,743
you get a pass.

318
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,400
But if you do put it on purpose,

319
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,530
if you make a porno video on purpose,

320
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:32,940
you fuck on camera on purpose,

321
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,013
you don't get in.

322
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,333
Isn't that strange?

323
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,010
No,

324
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,040
he is not going to give
you a fucking TV show.

325
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:38,431
You know?

326
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:41,730
You're not going to get nothing unless
it's a TV show on porn and it makes you

327
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:42,564
want to cry,

328
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,081
you know?

329
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:45,360
But then keeping up with the Kardashians
doesn't make you want to cry.

330
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,433
You know?

331
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,870
You've watched like one of
those inside pieces on Bella.

332
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:49,440
Donna,

333
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,101
did you ever watch that?

334
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:51,540
Show it down?

335
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,920
They said it made you want to cry,

336
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:53,190
right?

337
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:53,910
Definitely.

338
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,270
Yeah.

339
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,440
I'm glad she's retired now.

340
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,274
Hopefully.

341
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,950
Maybe he's happy and he was,

342
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,700
she was happier when
she's taking baseball.

343
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,160
Fascinating.

344
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,960
I was probably ahead.

345
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,171
Look,

346
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:03,570
it takes all kinds of people
do to make this world go round.

347
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,473
Yeah,

348
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,010
but for,

349
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:05,970
it is a weird thing though,

350
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:10,971
that you're allowed to do it as long as
you at least claim that you did it on

351
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:12,960
accident,

352
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,340
that it got released on accident.

353
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,710
But if we suspect that
you put it out on purpose,

354
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:18,840
you actually made your own
sex video and released it.

355
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:19,140
Yeah,

356
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,380
I think or I think it's pretty easy to
get a video out nowadays because I've,

357
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,470
I've been realizing how many recordings
now I've made of myself that I just

358
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,100
accidentally tweet.

359
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,160
The other day I accidentally tweeted
something that I thought was a direct

360
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:34,650
message out to everybody
and then I was like,

361
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:34,981
wow,

362
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:35,521
that's close.

363
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:36,690
I caught it right away

364
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,070
and my was a,

365
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,093
uh,

366
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,583
a video.

367
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,090
A video was a video,

368
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,280
some sexy time,

369
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:43,710
but yeah,

370
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:43,800
no,

371
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:43,921
no,

372
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:44,131
no.

373
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:45,330
It was a video of,

374
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:46,440
it could've been sexy time.

375
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,060
It was cheesy video,

376
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,110
like a cheesy like,

377
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:49,310
oh,

378
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,950
just make a video together
and accidentally put it out.

379
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:53,401
You know,

380
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:55,710
like I was trying to delete it,

381
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,250
Huh?

382
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:56,461
Yeah.

383
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:57,250
I deleted right away.

384
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,760
There's only one person
supposedly that commented on it,

385
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:02,640
but like 170 people solid and,

386
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,680
and I'm like probably luck if there's
just one person in there that grabbed that

387
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,430
video,

388
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,420
that would have been an awful,

389
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,100
how embarrassing is the video?

390
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,270
It's not that embarrassing.

391
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,460
It's just gross.

392
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,453
Gay.

393
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,280
You said it's not that
you list when you sit

394
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,720
down bear thing,

395
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,021
you,

396
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:22,350
you,

397
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,970
you like submitted to yourself.

398
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:25,500
You crawled inside of yourself.

399
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,460
It creeped me out.

400
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:26,940
When I saw,

401
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,020
when I realized I did it,

402
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:28,854
I was like,

403
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:29,130
well,

404
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,830
give us the cliff notes
version of what's on the video.

405
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,700
Uh,

406
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,863
being,

407
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,290
uh,

408
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:34,650
we did,

409
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,490
I didn't want to play it.

410
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,321
At least I don't have it on,

411
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:36,600
but you know,

412
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,433
I deleted it.

413
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:37,870
I,

414
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,750
once I get it off everything,

415
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:41,160
I can embarrass him.

416
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:41,251
Well,

417
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:42,090
give me the cliff notes.

418
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,220
It was like,

419
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:48,030
I'm laying in bed at seven in the morning
and my girlfriend's like laying on top

420
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,150
of you.

421
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,080
Make like wake up,

422
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:49,914
wake up and like,

423
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,983
oh,

424
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,960
I love you girl.

425
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,291
You know,

426
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:52,561
Shit.

427
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:53,100
Like,

428
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,820
Oh,

429
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,020
I love you girl.

430
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,101
You talked to her.

431
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:58,320
I don't know exactly how it talks to
her and pretend you're in a movie.

432
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,213
I love you baby.

433
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,520
If you don't know how to deal with checks,

434
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:03,600
maybe that's the best way to do it.

435
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,940
Just pretend you like
in a Tom cruise movie.

436
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,390
I did.

437
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,600
We did another blackout
podcast and it was,

438
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:11,850
we started drinking at like midnight,

439
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,260
we got,

440
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,800
we drank a whole bottle of vodka
and two huge glasses of great vodka.

441
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,701
Oh Shit.

442
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,534
And an hour.

443
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,240
And so it to me and
Veronica Richie and it,

444
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,870
but what's so hilarious,

445
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:28,040
it starts off Ronica Richie
girl is a penthouse pet.

446
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,411
Yeah.

447
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,244
But at the beginning of it,

448
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,770
it was really awkward conversation
because he's super shy,

449
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,110
super shy,

450
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,633
super shy,

451
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,043
family shot.

452
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,450
Her whole family's really shy.

453
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,900
People just fucking each other.

454
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:40,111
Right.

455
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:40,944
Is that what's going on?

456
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,670
I asked that.

457
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,720
That's how drunk became,

458
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,610
and then there was one point where she,

459
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,180
she,

460
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,330
she went stand up and she
fell and did like a backflip.

461
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,051
So winning me,

462
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:52,170
you've known this chick for awhile and
that's the only time you've ever talked

463
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:53,400
to her about molestation?

464
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,120
He did it on,

465
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,570
yeah.

466
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:54,781
Yeah,

467
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:55,350
it was pretty,

468
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,183
pretty great.

469
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,150
Did she respond?

470
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,290
You said,

471
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,020
listen to it.

472
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,030
I don't have that kind of time.

473
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,680
Just giving me what happens.

474
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,783
Uh,

475
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,373
she's uh,

476
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,831
I don't know.

477
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,664
I don't remember.

478
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,653
I blacked out.

479
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,550
She'd been molested.

480
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,270
Dude,

481
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,090
please.

482
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,340
You remember I blacked out.

483
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,230
She say she's been most of it.

484
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:12,781
I don't remember.

485
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:13,560
I blacked out.

486
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,430
That's ridiculous.

487
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:15,510
You're the worst actor ever.

488
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,070
So Bob,

489
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,641
I swear to God,

490
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:19,740
I haven't listened to re listen to it
because I don't really listen to me.

491
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,550
I don't sit around,

492
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,250
sit around,

493
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,950
listen to my fucking self again.

494
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:23,451
I don't get it.

495
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:24,390
So all the soap operas,

496
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:25,140
man,

497
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,760
I know they can't.

498
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,510
Can they cancel two
big ones the other day,

499
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:27,920
uh,

500
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,870
at when they canceled the
hospital went last year.

501
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,060
Say,

502
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,470
why do I know about those soap operas,

503
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,920
Muslim,

504
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,760
the opera is awful.

505
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,050
It might as well be opera.

506
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,950
Like what are you doing?

507
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:39,690
Something that's old and stupid.

508
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,351
All right.

509
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:44,720
And the idea that you're going to have
this crazy running drama every day and

510
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,060
like what's going to happen?

511
00:11:46,061 --> 00:11:51,061
And she comes home and finds him with
her and just every day there's drama and

512
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,980
crazy music.

513
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,220
And what a weird

514
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,300
way to live man.

515
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,380
Fucking stone Joe.

516
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:56,921
Hell yeah,

517
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:57,340
you are.

518
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,290
The two volcanoes got back in,

519
00:11:59,291 --> 00:11:59,690
you die.

520
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,850
He dove right back in.

521
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:05,380
Sunn o w dove in just an hour
ago and you dove right back in.

522
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,990
Have you ever tried one
of the fake the volcanoes?

523
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:08,660
That's like a,

524
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,550
a copy of it,

525
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:11,110
like a generic copy of the volcano?

526
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,213
No I haven't.

527
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,180
It's called like uh,

528
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,220
the wave or something.

529
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,230
I forget what it's called
but I just wondered if you,

530
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,470
cause it's only $90 compared
to whatever the volcano is,

531
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:21,430
like $400.

532
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,533
I don't know.

533
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:22,960
I don't know.

534
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,910
I wouldn't go budget on vaporizers.

535
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,600
Yeah,

536
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,640
it seems like complicated man.

537
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:31,660
It seems like there's a lot of shit go
on there and electricity and it's heat

538
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:35,080
and anytime just heat I say you got to
get the best thing cause you don't want

539
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:38,740
things burning through the fucking
cord and blowing up in your house or

540
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:38,980
whatever.

541
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,640
Some cheap piece of
shit would do just get,

542
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,060
get the stuff that's going to work.

543
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:44,080
And that the volcano thing,

544
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,080
what we're talking about is a vaporizer
and would vaporizing is ladies and

545
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:49,270
gentlemen is for the health
conscious amongst us,

546
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:53,770
the stoners that don't want any of those
bad nasty bits that you take in from

547
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:54,730
burning smoke,

548
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,120
which apparently is not nearly
as bad for you as tobacco smoke.

549
00:12:58,121 --> 00:12:59,890
But it's gotta be somewhat bad for you.

550
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:00,790
It's just smoke.

551
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,061
I mean,

552
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:01,894
I don't know.

553
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,861
It does.

554
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:04,360
It has some health benefits.

555
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:07,480
It's an expectorant and apparently it's
very good for people when they have

556
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:08,314
asthma,

557
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,161
people have asthma,

558
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:12,410
at least some of them have
reported that they have a,

559
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:13,690
a benefit from uh,

560
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,500
from small gangs,

561
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,430
from smoking the pot.

562
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,700
But with the vapor I does is it
cuts out all the health problems.

563
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:19,360
It just,

564
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,760
it heats it up but doesn't burn it.

565
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,540
So,

566
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,460
and it blows air through it and it
releases this THC missed and that is

567
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:28,294
collected.

568
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,550
And one of these,

569
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:31,241
and what this is,

570
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:31,580
is a,

571
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,190
you hear it iTunes folks,

572
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,620
it's a plastic bag at the end of it.

573
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:40,510
It has this whole novel and
you just suck out the pure THC.

574
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,950
And if you suck out enough,

575
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:43,030
you can see aliens.

576
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:43,790
And by the way,

577
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,590
the volcano,

578
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,380
I've tried every single kind
of vaporizer known to man.

579
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,650
And the volcano is the
only one that I recommend.

580
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,610
If you're going to get one,

581
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,480
get the volcano because that shit
works where the other ones you have to,

582
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,130
you're trying to adjust the temperature.

583
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:57,670
Right.

584
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,920
And sometimes it feels like
you're not getting anything.

585
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:03,400
Then other times it's like you got
too much dark smoke for some reason.

586
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,440
All that shit is just too ridiculous.

587
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:06,550
Just the volcano does it.

588
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:06,821
Yeah.

589
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:08,020
It just figures out how it works.

590
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,910
But I see how people don't
want to pay that money.

591
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,840
Much money to get home.

592
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,670
I was on craigslist looking in.

593
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,760
There was a lot of those
generic ones on it.

594
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:17,560
You know the only reason why all this
shit cost so much cause it's illegal.

595
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,433
It's the only reason.

596
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,160
The only reason everything costs
so much because it's illegal.

597
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,420
Marijuana should be cheapest.

598
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:23,020
Fuck,

599
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,771
it's a plant.

600
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:24,521
It's easy to grow.

601
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:25,600
It's a God damn weed.

602
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:26,680
It doesn't even get sick.

603
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,760
It doesn't rot.

604
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,151
You know,

605
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:28,511
you were like,

606
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:30,340
look at some trees and there's bugs.

607
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:31,150
Fucking them up.

608
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,450
Box.

609
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,150
Don't fuck up.

610
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,100
Re first pitch.

611
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,560
You didn't even have a chance.

612
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:36,550
Bugs and have a chance.

613
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,200
Reefer doesn't need pesticides.

614
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:39,370
Like people always say what happened?

615
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:40,360
Did they put pesticides?

616
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:40,761
You Weed,

617
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:41,180
man.

618
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,880
You like DDD poisoning bro.

619
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:43,820
That's what's wrong with weed.

620
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:44,771
No,

621
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:46,540
you don't need it doesn't need pesticides.

622
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,350
It doesn't get sick.

623
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,540
It's not like all these pussy ass plants.

624
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,680
It's one of the toughest
plants that's ever existed.

625
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,060
It's the best fiber,

626
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,600
the fiber that you make at a hamp,

627
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:56,400
like when you make hemp
jeans or clothes or,

628
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:57,260
but it's not.

629
00:14:57,261 --> 00:15:00,860
It's like so much more sturdy
than cotton and the paper,

630
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:03,260
like hemp paper is so superior to cotton,

631
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,550
it all became illegal.

632
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:05,660
Most people don't even know this,

633
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:10,010
but we came illegal back when they figured
out a more effective way to process

634
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:10,910
the hemp fiber.

635
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,320
It was legal forever,

636
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,030
but it became like something that people
stopped using because cotton became so

637
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:18,500
much more easy to process.

638
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,280
They came up with the cotton gin and
instead of just having slaves pick the

639
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:22,641
cotton,

640
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:23,930
which was a huge pain in the ass,

641
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,420
then they could run it through this
fucking machine and it made it way easier.

642
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,141
And so people were like,

643
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:27,974
fuck this hemp,

644
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,730
because hemp fibers like really tough
stuff and you got to break it down.

645
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,400
Have you ever watched like manual
breaking down of hemp fiber?

646
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,110
It's a laborious process,

647
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:36,590
men,

648
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,960
because the fucking stock of this plant,

649
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,990
this is like an animal or
an alien planet rather.

650
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,560
It's an incredible plant.

651
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:47,150
Like it's the fibers like
super fucking tough and strong.

652
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,130
You make the best rope out of it,

653
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,630
the best cloth out of it.

654
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:51,980
It's like so superior,

655
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,020
but it takes a long time to turn
that fiber into cloth or paper.

656
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,000
It's really difficult to break down.

657
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,870
And then in like the early 1930s a
guy came out with a machine called a

658
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:07,460
decorticator and with the decorticator
did was allow them to process it just

659
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:09,020
like the cotton gin processes.

660
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,840
Cotton allows it to
smash it down into this,

661
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,330
this pub and make it
more much more usable,

662
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,530
like almost immediately.

663
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,850
And then that's when they said,

664
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:17,601
fuck this,

665
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,340
and that's when pot became illegal.

666
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,760
Palm became illegal
entirely because of hemp,

667
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,550
which has nothing to do with
the psychoactive properties.

668
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,020
It became illegal because of William
Randolph Hearst who was running newspapers

669
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:34,430
and he also had paper mills and they were
going to make people start using hemp

670
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:34,851
paper.

671
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:36,770
That was going to be the
shit because you could,

672
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,640
you could tank like a forest full of
trees and you chop them down when you're

673
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:42,650
fucked because you don't
have any more trees.

674
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:42,900
Yeah.

675
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,200
It takes a long ass time for
those trees to grow back.

676
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,303
But hemp,

677
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,900
you grow it every four months.

678
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:49,370
You'd have a new fucking crop.

679
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:49,941
I mean,

680
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:52,970
you could use the same property
over and over and over again.

681
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,970
It's renewable and you
get much more paper pull.

682
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,120
So this motherfucker was going to
have to spend millions of dollars.

683
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,160
So them and Dupont,

684
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:01,941
William Randolph,

685
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:02,690
Hearst and dupont,

686
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,100
they got together and they said,

687
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:04,500
hey,

688
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,180
we will do,

689
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,210
we'll fucking say that pot makes um,

690
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,260
blacks and Mexicans rape white chicks.

691
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,670
And that's all they did.

692
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,631
That's what they did.

693
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:12,740
That's literally what they did.

694
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,240
They started printing stories.

695
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,740
William Randolph Hearst did in the paper
of this new drug called marijuana and

696
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:19,970
what marijuana was,

697
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,890
had nothing even to do with pot.

698
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:26,090
The original name for marijuana was
a slang for a wild Mexican tobacco.

699
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,440
So they call it marijuana and then
say blacks and Mexicans are smoking

700
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:30,950
marijuana.

701
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,410
So when congress made hemp illegal,

702
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,450
when they made a marijuana illegal,

703
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:37,880
Dee Dee didn't even know they
were making hemp illegal as well.

704
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,430
They fucked everybody and they did it.

705
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,440
19 fucking 30 something.

706
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,860
It's amazing that that
shit is still going on.

707
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,590
It's still illegal in
the age of the Internet.

708
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,671
We're all,

709
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:52,260
the information is at your disposal.

710
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,090
Everything you can Google search,

711
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,210
every fucking study ever done on pot,

712
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,870
and you could see right away
that most people want it legal.

713
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,950
Who's stopping it?

714
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,131
Oh,

715
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:03,090
people with money.

716
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,310
Why they stopped doing it?

717
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:04,531
Well,

718
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:07,680
because they're making money on marijuana
being illegal and they're using that

719
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:08,910
money that bribing politicians,

720
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:10,020
and that's how they keep it in place.

721
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,831
Fuck,

722
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:11,580
really?

723
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,190
In 2011 you can be that open.

724
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,370
It's that open where
you can see so clearly.

725
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,260
It's so sick,

726
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:19,890
man.

727
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,700
It's sick.

728
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,350
It's sick that we live like this.

729
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,610
It's sick that you can put people in
jail for Dwight and a smoke a joint and

730
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:29,590
kick back and listen to some
good music and you know,

731
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,420
eat some food and have some great
conversation with friends and not hurt

732
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:34,140
anybody.

733
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,400
And yet cops can come and lock
you up in a fucking cage for that.

734
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,170
It's ridiculous.

735
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,900
We know what drugs are bad folks.

736
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,430
We know we have to stop letting people
tell you that the drugs that are good or

737
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:49,230
bad because they're fucking wrong.

738
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,970
There's ones are bad.

739
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,740
Don't do math,

740
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,573
don't do heroin.

741
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,520
Or if you do,

742
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,050
you've got to be a musician or something,

743
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:55,711
you know,

744
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:57,540
heroin seems to be okay for musicians.

745
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,680
Did you see kills you?

746
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,000
Did you see that guy a bat?

747
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:01,541
What's his name?

748
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,374
Batiste.

749
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,460
Those Strikeforce guy.

750
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,250
Did you see how as a
thing on TMZ other day?

751
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,090
No,

752
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,570
he uh,

753
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,330
he was talking about how his deal got cut,

754
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:10,610
you know,

755
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,410
from the merger with the UFC and the
strike force and stuff like that.

756
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,180
Do you think that's something,

757
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:18,280
do you know anything about this guy or no,

758
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,840
I know anything more than a,

759
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:24,670
I saw there was a headline on
mma.tv or mixed martial arts.com.

760
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,210
Yeah,

761
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:25,960
I saw that,

762
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,740
but I didn't read it.

763
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,670
It's not interesting to me.

764
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,301
Not Interested.

765
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:28,600
No,

766
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,021
not really.

767
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:29,291
I mean,

768
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,360
he seems like a nice guy
and I wish them well,

769
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,090
but you know,

770
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,070
I'm interested in young guys
that are coming up and I mean,

771
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,610
occasionally a guy like Lester
Lester was like a serious wrestler,

772
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,370
you know,

773
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,980
like you're serious amateur wrestler.

774
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,230
Like that's what made him excited.

775
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,470
It wasn't just that it was a big guy.

776
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,410
Is this guy now?

777
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,720
I don't believe so.

778
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,231
I don't know.

779
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:47,500
I'm,

780
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,090
I really don't know his background,

781
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,680
but I feel like I would have heard about
him the way I heard about Lesnar when

782
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:56,740
lesbian was a wrestler and we got
back when he was doing pro wrestling,

783
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,510
I had heard about what a freak he was.

784
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,391
Like people were,

785
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:01,720
were talking about what a
crazy specimen this guy was.

786
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,071
Dude,

787
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:03,460
there's a fucking video of him.

788
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,420
Uh,

789
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,740
we've talked about in the podcast before,

790
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:06,340
but it's worth,

791
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,210
it's worth repeating.

792
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:07,390
Just,

793
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,410
it's so ridiculous.

794
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,930
He was 300 pounds solid muscle,

795
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:11,350
right?

796
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,050
He gets on top of the fucking
turnbuckle or whatever the hell it is,

797
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:19,000
stands on the ropes and flips through
the air and lands on his head.

798
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,940
Lans I his fucking head.

799
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:27,060
He flew through the air and landed on his
head and he was still conscious and he

800
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:30,030
climbed on top of the guy.

801
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:32,410
It's still got the pin and you watch it.

802
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,280
If you watch it,

803
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:34,140
you watch them do that and go,

804
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,320
that's supposed to kill people.

805
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,490
How did that not kill him?

806
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:37,880
Who's this guy?

807
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,230
How could,

808
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,710
how the fuck did that guy survived that?

809
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,640
It's supposed to snap your neck and
break every fucking bone in your spinal

810
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:44,300
column.

811
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,520
It's supposed to be just
chaos for you after that.

812
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:46,881
Meanwhile,

813
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:47,651
he liked finishes.

814
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:49,840
The match is ridiculous.

815
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,230
So he was already this guy where
people are like this Brock Lesnar guy,

816
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,770
man,

817
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,630
you ain't never seen a
heavyweight move like that guy.

818
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,630
And we had heard about his fucking times
and that was like one of the things

819
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:01,960
they talked about during his wrestling
days was his times in the NFL combine.

820
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,291
You know,

821
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,460
the NFL combine is,

822
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:03,941
you know,

823
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:04,331
it's like,

824
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:04,540
um,

825
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,880
I actually can pull up the numbers
because it's so ridiculous.

826
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:07,021
It's,

827
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:07,854
it's worth reading.

828
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,190
But the NFL combine,

829
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:12,160
it's when they take athletes and they,

830
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:12,490
um,

831
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:12,701
you know,

832
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:15,310
they run them through these tasks
like the 40 yard and you know,

833
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:15,911
see how fat,

834
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:16,870
let me find it real quick here.

835
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,720
I'm going to say something completely.

836
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:23,950
Stoney Brock and Shane,

837
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:24,440
here it is.

838
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:24,570
Here.

839
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,510
Let me read this to you right here.

840
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,630
This is his,

841
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,090
his crazy fucking numbers.

842
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,200
The 40 yard sprint,

843
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,760
4.6 seconds.

844
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,970
He's 200 and fucking 90 something pounds.

845
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:34,570
Okay.

846
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,190
4.6 seconds.

847
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,470
That's like eight times.

848
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:38,970
Fascinating.

849
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,803
You can do,

850
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:40,810
I mean,

851
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,830
stop and think about that.

852
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:43,450
40 yards of 4.6 seconds.

853
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,450
That's a fast 4,225 pound bench press,

854
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,730
43 repetitions,

855
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,520
43 of two 25.

856
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,710
What the fuck is vertical jump?

857
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,920
35 inches is broad jump 10 feet.

858
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,740
He hurls 300 pounds,

859
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,170
10 feet through the fucking air.

860
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,180
That's ridiculous shit,

861
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:05,014
dude.

862
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,190
That's a freak.

863
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:06,911
You know?

864
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:08,490
So we had heard about that shit like when,

865
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:09,520
when he was around,

866
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,090
we'd heard about that long ago and so
when I heard that he was going to go into

867
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:14,740
a to to MMA,

868
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:15,031
I was like,

869
00:22:15,031 --> 00:22:15,341
oh,

870
00:22:15,341 --> 00:22:16,300
I was there for his first fight.

871
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,320
I saw this first went live.

872
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,150
It was at a la at the coliseum.

873
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,060
It was for a k one took
his fucking dude down,

874
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:23,110
just smashed him.

875
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,550
And I remember looking at that going,

876
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,500
who's going to fuck with that?

877
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,810
Like that's a dangerous motherfucker.

878
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,070
Some freaky guy who can get on top of
you and just punch your brains in and try

879
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:33,581
stopping it.

880
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:34,210
Good Luck,

881
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,043
you know?

882
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,741
Of course,

883
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:37,630
you know Cain Velasquez
eventually did stop it,

884
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:38,464
but he was another,

885
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,700
another freak specimen.

886
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,480
When is it?

887
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,740
When's the rematch for that?

888
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,131
Well,

889
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:44,350
it's not going to happen
unless Brock gets by a junior.

890
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:48,260
Dos Santos that's going to be in June
junior dos Santos and him are coaching the

891
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:50,740
season of the ultimate fighter and
then they're going to meet up in June.

892
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,120
I was Brock's training right now.

893
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,160
Have you heard anything about,

894
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,710
I haven't heard anything other than he's
back with Greg Nelson who is the guy

895
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:56,991

896
00:22:56,991 --> 00:22:57,460

901
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:03,220
I'm a big Fan of his,

902
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,900

he does great worries,

905
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,140
formulates good game plans.

906
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:11,020
He's a real student of
the game and you know,

907
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:11,261

913
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:21,070

914
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:21,904

915
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,260

916
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,150
The guy that just wanted decision.

917
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,513
Fuck,

918
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,583
I hate that.

919
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,570
Opened up a Gracie to kill the Carney.

920
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,823
Um,

921
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,460

922
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,040
They opened up at Gracie Jujitsu in
Burbank right down the street from me.

923
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:37,930
Didn't,

924
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:38,710

925
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,280
No.

926
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,090
Why not?

927
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,440
I took a photo of it.

928
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:41,951
That's pretty funny.

929
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:42,784

930
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,480

933
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,720
Got a crazy spin.

934
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:48,890
Have you been at Gracie spin yet?

935
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,701
Took the woman's class,

936
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:50,240

They have ribbons.

939
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,100
Remember those ribbons with
the sticks given shape?

940
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:55,370
Girl,

941
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:55,981
you used to do that.

942
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:57,830
You used to tell me all the
time he used to do get in shape.

943
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:58,610
Girl.

944
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,031
By the way,

945
00:23:59,031 --> 00:23:59,864
have you seen this?

946
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,320
That guy,

947
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,690
did you ever watch that guy's animation
that he did for Burke crushers?

948
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,540
A staples video?

949
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,560
No.

950
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,070
Uh,

951
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,580
or win or a Barnes and know when he
used to work out in the basement of that

952
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:12,890
bookstore as somebody put it to animation.

953
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:14,070
The same guy that did the first line.

954
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,931
Fucking brilliant.

955
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:15,764
You got to watch it.

956
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,023
Yeah,

957
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,271
the guy,

958
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:18,104
he's great.

959
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,681
Fuck.

960
00:24:20,681 --> 00:24:21,610
Am I listening to you man?

961
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,690
You got to do a women's classes that's
been getting in shape with pink Kimono on

962
00:24:28,111 --> 00:24:28,251
and,

963
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:28,490
and,

964
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,070
and just look like a dyke.

965
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,001
Shave your face.

966
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:32,830
That's what am I to just go
on and say you're a dyke.

967
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,940
It's one way to do,

968
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:36,430
they allow transgender
and the women's classes.

969
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,430
I'll give you more a man and
you decided to become a woman.

970
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,620
Do they allow you to take a woman's class?

971
00:24:40,621 --> 00:24:40,810
Yeah.

972
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,510
Well you're allowed to when
you get postop or whatever.

973
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:44,410
Even if you're not fully,

974
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:45,760
you're allowed to go to
the woman's restroom.

975
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,450
Are you rolling?

976
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,060
Yeah.

977
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,190
Postop or whatever.

978
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:52,600
You know what the supposedly was behind
that woman getting beat up in that

979
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:53,310
Mcdonald's?

980
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,430
Uh Oh my God.

981
00:24:54,431 --> 00:24:55,040
Did you hear about that?

982
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,110
It's fucking crazy.

983
00:24:56,111 --> 00:24:56,471
Supposedly.

984
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:57,310
That's a transvestite.

985
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:57,850
Really?

986
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,270
Yeah.

987
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,830
That's what Amanda dresses like a woman.

988
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:00,670
I that's,

989
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,620
that's crazy that we
know about Mcdonald's.

990
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:03,011
Well,

991
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:03,940
that video is huge.

992
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:04,890
I haven't seen the video part.

993
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,581
You haven't seen it?

994
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:05,830
No.

995
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,663
It was pretty ruthless.

996
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,830
Cross beat the fuck out of that
girl and they keep going back.

997
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:11,770
They keep kicking him and then a girl
kicks her when she's down kicks boots are

998
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:13,660
in the hand and the
girl starts convulsing.

999
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,441
Oh God.

1000
00:25:14,441 --> 00:25:14,621
Yeah.

1001
00:25:14,621 --> 00:25:15,454
It's pretty rough.

1002
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,300
It's pretty rough.

1003
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,650
And people would call it so fuck.

1004
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,470
It looks so fake.

1005
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,841
Tell you what,

1006
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:19,674
it wasn't fake,

1007
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,820
that big gigantic kick to the head.

1008
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,930
That shit was real.

1009
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:23,291
You know,

1010
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,120
it's very possible and people don't know.

1011
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,290
People go into convulsions.

1012
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,170
So it's very possible that someone can
have a seizure from heavy brain trauma

1013
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:29,860
like that.

1014
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,500
Very possible.

1015
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,333
Don't think it's not,

1016
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,373
you know,

1017
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,790
the girl really kicked her
in the head like it was,

1018
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,190
it was really stumped her head,

1019
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,053
you know,

1020
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:37,923
it was pretty rough.

1021
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,651
And uh,

1022
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:38,891
you know,

1023
00:25:38,891 --> 00:25:41,230
the manager is trying to
keep the girls off of the,

1024
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,010
he can't,

1025
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,030
he's in effective,

1026
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,110
everybody got fired.

1027
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,183
The whole thing.

1028
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,390
It's pretty crazy.

1029
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,090
But the idea was that she was a,

1030
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,461
a he,

1031
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:50,740
she and she was going
into the woman's room.

1032
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,000
That's what I read.

1033
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,230
Whether or not that's true,

1034
00:25:53,231 --> 00:25:53,890
I haven't,

1035
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,800
I don't know if they've interviewed
her and got the whole full deal.

1036
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:56,981
See,

1037
00:25:56,981 --> 00:25:58,570
this is like another form of soap opera.

1038
00:25:59,130 --> 00:25:59,963
You know,

1039
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,931
Antwan Dodson,

1040
00:26:00,931 --> 00:26:02,680
he got arrested for marijuana possession.

1041
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:03,514
Did you hear?

1042
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,000
Did He,

1043
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,480
yeah,

1044
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,600
Ron and tell him that home home
home boy somewhere in Alabama.

1045
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,170
What's it doing in Alabama
is probably where he lives.

1046
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:10,531
No,

1047
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:11,610
I thought he moved back to La.

1048
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:15,190
I heard that he was living in la now
and they were filming a new show with a

1049
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:15,650
mallet.

1050
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,040
Yeah.

1051
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Maybe it went back home and say hi
to the homeys and they got busted.

1052
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,491
Hi.

1053
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:20,250
How amazed.

1054
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,083
Oh,

1055
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,400
oh yeah.

1056
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:23,420
Back then man,

1057
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,810
you still can get busted back there
rather back there is back then.

1058
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:28,400
That's funny because I said back then,

1059
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,930
you know meaning like Alabama,

1060
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,900
but it is back then in time as well,

1061
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,501
you know,

1062
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:35,030
I mean that's really what it is.

1063
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,300
I'm saying back then because I'm thinking
of it as it being in like the fifties,

1064
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,020
you know,

1065
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,250
I should've said back there,

1066
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,930
but back then is more appropriate.

1067
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,590
They live in a fucking time warp.

1068
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:43,980
Yeah.

1069
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,890
Stupid ass place where you
can get fucking arrested for.

1070
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,071
Oh,

1071
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:48,360
did you hear about the Rhode Island Guy?

1072
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,480
Here's another one I love hearing
about politicians to get fucked up.

1073
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,040
This guy who is a,

1074
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:53,640
um,

1075
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,540
he was a anti Marijuana
House minority leader,

1076
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:58,860
Robert Watson.

1077
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,470
He was arrested for
alcohol and drug charges.

1078
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,720
They pull homeboy over and uh,

1079
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,870
he failed the sup,

1080
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,300
the field sobriety test.

1081
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,320
So then,

1082
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,070
um,

1083
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,431
they,

1084
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:08,680
uh,

1085
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:08,870
they,

1086
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,520
they grabbed him and they searched his
pockets and they find out he's got a,

1087
00:27:12,521 --> 00:27:14,880
a plastic bag filled with
pot and a wooden pipe.

1088
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:20,330
So this fucking dummy who is this
anti pot guy gets busted with pot,

1089
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,261
you know,

1090
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:23,190
and that to me,

1091
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,821
you know,

1092
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:24,141
you,

1093
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:24,330
you,

1094
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:24,690
you,

1095
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:29,370
that's like a gay guy who secretly gay
votes against gay marriage and that they

1096
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:30,204
should be,

1097
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,380
they should be locked up.

1098
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:31,930
You're,

1099
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:32,530
that's like a,

1100
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,363
that's like a,

1101
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,860
you're like a trader.

1102
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,200
You're like a trader for humanity.

1103
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,790
Like you're a bad person.

1104
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,630
Like if you really want to lock people
in jail for pot and yet you enjoy pot,

1105
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,670
you're a shitty human being.

1106
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,880
You're willing to put your own personal
gain ahead of the betterment of the

1107
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:50,820
people.

1108
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,330
You,

1109
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,920
you're willing to take something that
you know is not right and push it because

1110
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:59,130
you think more people are gonna agree
with you because it's the contemporary

1111
00:27:59,131 --> 00:27:59,910
opinion,

1112
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,743
you know,

1113
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,081
that's a,

1114
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:02,490
that's a really shitty human being.

1115
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,271
That guy,

1116
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:03,631
you know,

1117
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:07,890
I hope that guy is ostracized from
the political community for life.

1118
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,540
I hope they never allow him back.

1119
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,531
And it's sad,

1120
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:11,580
but they probably will.

1121
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,080
He'll probably eventually show up
somewhere else and apologize or become a

1122
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:17,170
Christian or,

1123
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:18,640
or something stupid and,

1124
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,381
and they'll,

1125
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:20,660
they'll suck them right back in.

1126
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:24,450
Enough people will believe in him that
he'll get some shitty job at some shitty

1127
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:27,210
little fucking community where they won't
bother Google search and what a Douche

1128
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:28,044
bag he is.

1129
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,310
You know,

1130
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,690
hopefully it gets I herpes,

1131
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,890
I think that that should exist where you
can get herpes on your eyeball really

1132
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,690
and breaks out like once,

1133
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,770
once a month or whatever.

1134
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,150
Whenever it happens.

1135
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,220
I heard of a story and I
don't know if it's true.

1136
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,170
So Internet do your research.

1137
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,910
A wrestler was on a,

1138
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,390
uh,

1139
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,530
in the middle of a match.

1140
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,910
His contact fell out,

1141
00:28:47,911 --> 00:28:49,740
put his contact back in his eye,

1142
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,550
got staff from the contact lens and died.

1143
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,140
Is this true?

1144
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,250
I have no idea.

1145
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,770
This could very easily be
one of those urban myths.

1146
00:28:59,400 --> 00:28:59,821
But,

1147
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,001
uh,

1148
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:01,200
I heard the story and I was like,

1149
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:04,020
that is the scariest fucking
thing I've ever heard in my life.

1150
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:04,990
You know,

1151
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,360
you eyeball staff that winds up killing
you just because a contact lens fell on

1152
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:12,240
the ground and the ground
is so fucking polluted,

1153
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:12,751
you know,

1154
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,950
there's so much funk and fucking
human slime on that ground.

1155
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,560
That staff is some scary shit man.

1156
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:19,920
I Hammer.

1157
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,700
How scary like websites like
rotten.com used to be there.

1158
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,320
What was the one,

1159
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,940
the other one that was really bad?

1160
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,510
Uh,

1161
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,750
not rotten.com.

1162
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,860
That was the one I had like the red and
black and I don't remember what you're

1163
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,140
talking.

1164
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,180
I remember I would be scared to go there.

1165
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:36,721
There was a few,

1166
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:39,090
there's a few sites to this
day that I won't fuck with,

1167
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,440
but somebody posted up a
video the other day of a,

1168
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,020
a Mexican lady cutting some dude's
head off now I watched the whole time.

1169
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,623
I Dunno.

1170
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,080
That was weak as weak.

1171
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,003
You shouldn't have done it.

1172
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:51,460
They would,

1173
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:51,660
they'd,

1174
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:51,961
she,

1175
00:29:51,961 --> 00:29:55,330
she didn't just cut off as hatch to
do a lot of other shit to him too.

1176
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,220
And there's a video of it and they,

1177
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,450
they show the guy dying.

1178
00:29:58,451 --> 00:29:58,900
I mean,

1179
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,740
they show her.

1180
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,070
And um,

1181
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,510
I was amazed at how,

1182
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:06,670
how much I've gotten over
the impact of those things.

1183
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,250
You know,

1184
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,051
it used to be,

1185
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:09,700
I would watch that and
it would haunt my dreams.

1186
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:13,270
Like the first time I ever saw faces
of death and I realized he's a really,

1187
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:15,130
bodies like faces death.

1188
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:16,660
Some of the faces of death were,

1189
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:17,170
um,

1190
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,630
I don't know if it was
exactly faces of death,

1191
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:20,830
but one of those type of videos,

1192
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,050
I remember one of them
was super disturbing.

1193
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:27,130
It was in some Middle Eastern country
where they were killing a guy by tying him

1194
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:29,130
in between two trucks and pulling them.

1195
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,120
Oh yeah.

1196
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,030
Remember the blood orgeat
that was completely fake.

1197
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:33,630
Right.

1198
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,800
I don't remember that.

1199
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,663
The blood orgy was,

1200
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,260
they had a body in the
middle and they were like,

1201
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:37,800
Oh yeah,

1202
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,633
that was fun.

1203
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,810
It looked fake as fuck.

1204
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,230
Yeah,

1205
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:40,891
that looks stupid.

1206
00:30:40,891 --> 00:30:43,350
Train chick was the one that scared me.

1207
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:43,821
The old,

1208
00:30:43,821 --> 00:30:46,130
the girl steps in for the
train and get smashed.

1209
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:46,591
Oh,

1210
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:48,460
Marty flies towards the camera.

1211
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,650
Oh my God,

1212
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:50,484
that's hard.

1213
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,100
I forgot about that train one man.

1214
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,510
I forgot about that train one.

1215
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,170
Ooh,

1216
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,010
monkey brains.

1217
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,290
Monkey brains is rough.

1218
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:57,680
Yeah,

1219
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,431
but I'll tell you what.

1220
00:30:58,431 --> 00:30:59,031
That's a monkey.

1221
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,520
I don't really care
that much about a month.

1222
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:00,870
Tell me.

1223
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,420
I'm not happy that a monkey dies.

1224
00:31:02,421 --> 00:31:04,280
But you want to see monkeys get fucked up.

1225
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:04,911
Watch the chimps.

1226
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:05,960
Fuck up the monkeys.

1227
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,960
You know that's the most
disturbing monkey shit online.

1228
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,540
I'm just watching chimps eating
monkeys while they're alive.

1229
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,890
So monkey brains.

1230
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:14,030
I don't even know if that was real.

1231
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,023
Yeah.

1232
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:15,750
Who knows.

1233
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,100
I used to have a face of the death.

1234
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:17,934
I've talked about this.

1235
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,060
Maybe not in the podcast.

1236
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:19,851
The UFC.

1237
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:22,170
Do you have cause and
that was our scary tape.

1238
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,130
Like we be like guys,

1239
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,430
they got USC number two
in fear or whatever,

1240
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:27,420
the faces of death.

1241
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,880
So we'd go and watch that shit.

1242
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,181
Yeah,

1243
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,650
they used to disturb the shit out of me.

1244
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:33,371
Like that video,

1245
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:36,030
the guy's getting pulled to get
pulled apart by the trucks that,

1246
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:38,080
that fucking haunted me for days.

1247
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,910
But now I can watch it and it's like,

1248
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:41,140
it's so much easier to digest.

1249
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,500
My favorite one was not my favorite,

1250
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:48,520
the most disturbing one where that guy
gets shot in the stomach and gut or

1251
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,260
whatever it was.

1252
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,491
Ooh,

1253
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,030
la La and he falls down.

1254
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,441
I didn't see that one.

1255
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:52,770
You didn't?

1256
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,290
Oh that,

1257
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,360
that was one of the best of the,

1258
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,920
I think it was faces of death too.

1259
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,880
It was like a guy.

1260
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,420
Yeah.

1261
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,930
He goes and he falls down and
we used to always say that,

1262
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,290
oh,

1263
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,123
growing up,

1264
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,203
whenever I,

1265
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,000
whatever bug doors,

1266
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,000
the most disturbing or whatever he was,

1267
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:08,340
uh,

1268
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,780
was on one of those fucking things.

1269
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,690
Might not have been faced it.

1270
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:10,861
Dad,

1271
00:32:10,861 --> 00:32:12,180
I got a couple of other ones too.

1272
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,130
I shouldn't never watched those though.

1273
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,060
That's what I don't know.

1274
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,820
Do you think that it's bad
that you become desensitized?

1275
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:19,830
Cause I'm not desensitized
to it in real life.

1276
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,053
You know?

1277
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,130
What do you think it's good for your soul?

1278
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:23,761
Like I think,

1279
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:25,950
I think after I saw at the,

1280
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,140
that'd be heading video,

1281
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,190
the famous Iraqi be heading guy.

1282
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,201
I think after seeing that,

1283
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:30,451
I'm like,

1284
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:31,170
you know what?

1285
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,520
I'm cutting myself off of that and
just not gonna to do that anymore.

1286
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,350
There's no reason I don't need to see it.

1287
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,770
I've see what it looks like.

1288
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:38,660
Yeah.

1289
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:38,990
I don't know.

1290
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,280
Yeah,

1291
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,800
I'm,

1292
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,290
I'm,

1293
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,450
I'm in agreement.

1294
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,200
I still wash it and not all the time.

1295
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:45,981
Most of the time I'm,

1296
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:46,580
I'm,

1297
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,870
most of the time I'm avoiding it,

1298
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,900
but every now and then I'll get stupid
and I just get weak because it's

1299
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:51,734
something that,

1300
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,163
it's a little bit of that,

1301
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:53,780
a little bit of,

1302
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,990
I don't have anything particular
that I need to be looking at,

1303
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,130
so I just decide,

1304
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,430
hmm.

1305
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,690
Let me see what the fuck's on this.

1306
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,690
Let me see what's on that
page and then I'll see it.

1307
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,533
I'll,

1308
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,021
all right,

1309
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:03,590
let's click it.

1310
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,250
Let's just click it.

1311
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:04,760
Let's see what it,

1312
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,360
what it is.

1313
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,781
You know what?

1314
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:07,850
I think the best movie for you ever is.

1315
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:09,740
If they made like a horror movie,

1316
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:14,770
kind of like a free Friday the 13th but
it was like Friday 13th but the porn

1317
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:15,764
mixed in with it,

1318
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,880
like it was like there was like
six girls staying at this hotel.

1319
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,500
You know what?

1320
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,520
You're projecting your own
fucked up weird shit on me.

1321
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,750
I think that would be
your favorite movie ever.

1322
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,660
I don't like Friday movies.

1323
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,660
Yeah,

1324
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,910
I like Werewolf movies,

1325
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,590
but I've making it figure out why.

1326
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,940
What the fuck that is.

1327
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,640
I guess somehow or another
knowing that deep inside people,

1328
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:35,300
there's some,

1329
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,410
some sort of an animalistic nature
that that it is almost like a wolf,

1330
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,690
you know you're aware of.

1331
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:41,681
No,

1332
00:33:41,681 --> 00:33:42,910
I'm not in person.

1333
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,380
Fuck is wrong with you.

1334
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,230
Well,

1335
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,090
we'll stone exist.

1336
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:47,924
Stupid.

1337
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,720
I remember when twilight with the big
east always say you're aware of Wolf

1338
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,440
brand.

1339
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,310
You're going to give me a bad
reputation with these lies.

1340
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,151
I don't think that's cool,

1341
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:56,984
man.

1342
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:57,831
Poor friends.

1343
00:33:57,831 --> 00:33:59,360
You can't just fucking
him put shit like this.

1344
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,800
Put it up.

1345
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,441
Next thing you know,

1346
00:34:01,441 --> 00:34:03,410
it'd be on my Wikipedia page.

1347
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,483
That's going to become,

1348
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,230
that's the next thing
on the Wikipedia page.

1349
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:09,680
I'm not saying that you should put
in that during the twilight days,

1350
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,200
Joe Rogan often said that
he was aware of Wolf.

1351
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,030
I'm not saying you
should put that on there,

1352
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,080
but if it's on there,

1353
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,973
I ain't hating.

1354
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,850
You know what I'm saying?

1355
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,683
I ain't mad at you.

1356
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,400
I'm already on some man Shit.

1357
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:19,850
You know,

1358
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,683
because when they,

1359
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,450
when the Dale Wright's said
that y'all had some man shit,

1360
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,920
I said something about putting it on.

1361
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,480
I'm on Wikipedia and
apparently it's up there.

1362
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:29,810
Man.

1363
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,740
That shit's hilarious.

1364
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,970
I don't fuck with my Wikipedia.

1365
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:32,900
So if you want to write,

1366
00:34:32,901 --> 00:34:33,734
it's like a big ship.

1367
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,910
I got banned from Wikipedia.

1368
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:37,730
I support your fake writing
shit about me on Wikipedia.

1369
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:38,630
As long as it's funny,

1370
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:39,081
you know,

1371
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:39,891
just be funny with it.

1372
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:40,724
Just have some fun.

1373
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,590
What the fuck man?

1374
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,360
You know,

1375
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,691
it's it.

1376
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:44,990
The whole idea about those things,

1377
00:34:44,991 --> 00:34:45,790
it's silly.

1378
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,060
You know,

1379
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,100
you're going to allow everybody
to just contribute shit.

1380
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,230
How you gonna know I gonna to ever know.

1381
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,180
I ain't gonna ever know
that's someone corrects it.

1382
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:54,110
What if they don't correct it?

1383
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,250
What did you get banned for?

1384
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:55,930
I don't know.

1385
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,220
My Ip was band and I've never,

1386
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,990
I don't think I've ever used Wikipedia.

1387
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,270
And then one day just started being
managed and now I'm thinking like an ex

1388
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:03,830
girlfriend was like at my house going,

1389
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:04,161
oh,

1390
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:05,810
I might see Britney spears that has nine.

1391
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,081
It's hot,

1392
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:07,700
it's mining or something like that.

1393
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:07,811
You know?

1394
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:09,170
I really think that first of all,

1395
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:10,340
you let chicks use your,

1396
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:10,491
uh,

1397
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:12,380
your computer or they did
it with their own computer,

1398
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,390
like their own computer.

1399
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:13,801
You know what I mean?

1400
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:14,250
No check.

1401
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,370
You've got to stay off my IP address.

1402
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,701
When you,

1403
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:18,020
when you have a check over your house,

1404
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:19,340
when she starts fucking with your email,

1405
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,383
do you get to go,

1406
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:20,620
hey,

1407
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,050
hey,

1408
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,291
hey,

1409
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:21,561
hey,

1410
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:22,010
hey,

1411
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,540
well I'm fucking you doing,

1412
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,580
I'm pretty good nowadays.

1413
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,440
It's like I'm not like some crazy I
have you ever had that happen though?

1414
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,240
I would assume that in the past,

1415
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:29,711
cause you,

1416
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:33,360
you're always into all kinds of weird
shit and date and all these weird girls.

1417
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,720
It's mostly ex girlfriend talk like,

1418
00:35:35,721 --> 00:35:36,050
hey,

1419
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,040
what's this email with your ex girlfriend?

1420
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,980
Or something like that through
emails to find that Shit.

1421
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:41,610
I don't know.

1422
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:41,870
Yeah.

1423
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,703
I had to,

1424
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,980
had to be looking to your emails.

1425
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:44,880
How else would she know?

1426
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:45,750
Yeah.

1427
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,291
So she goes,

1428
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:46,800
any computer,

1429
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,461
it looks through emails.

1430
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:47,641
He goes,

1431
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:48,600
what the fuck is this?

1432
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,050
Yeah.

1433
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:49,890
And then what are you gonna say?

1434
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:50,911
Uh,

1435
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:52,050
you just tell him the truth.

1436
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,230
I mean like it's just them over reacting.

1437
00:35:54,231 --> 00:35:54,661
I'm things,

1438
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:55,230
you know,

1439
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,441
like,

1440
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:56,070
hey look,

1441
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,120
and just my ex girlfriend,

1442
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:57,480
you know,

1443
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,770
I dated her for seven years.

1444
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:00,480
I can talk to this person,

1445
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,613
you know,

1446
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,940
and then the music starts playing

1447
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,370
beginning of a music video
from the 90s you know,

1448
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:08,900
like Orange Juice Jones.

1449
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,893
Ah,

1450
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,820
and him walking in the rain

1451
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,370
this weekend.

1452
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:21,320
Toronto is a basically sold out the
only tickets that are available for the

1453
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,140
Massey Hall show.

1454
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,761
And that'd be amazing.

1455
00:36:22,761 --> 00:36:23,030
Hall.

1456
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,810

1457
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:24,770
Macy all mastering hall,

1458
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,613
whatever the fuck it is.

1459
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,500
Friday night,

1460
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:26,691
I'm,

1461
00:36:26,691 --> 00:36:30,080
the only tickets that are available
are like single seats by themselves.

1462
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,740
And A,

1463
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,090
I'm fucking super psyched.

1464
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:35,360
I'm super psyched to get to Toronto and
I'm super psyched to be bringing my man,

1465
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,100
Sam Tripoli with me.

1466
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,930
Sam The slayer.

1467
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,730
Him.

1468
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,060
Oh yeah,

1469
00:36:41,061 --> 00:36:42,080
Shady Sam triply.

1470
00:36:42,081 --> 00:36:42,381
He's a,

1471
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:43,214
he's awesome.

1472
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,770
And then the UFC of
course is the next night,

1473
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,780
so it's going to be their shit son.

1474
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,010
I can't wait.

1475
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,660
We are doing sow's comedy whole tomorrow
night and that'll be at eight o'clock,

1476
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,040
eight o'clock in Hollywood.

1477
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,410
Wow.

1478
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:55,670
Why do it,

1479
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,350
why you're frowning?

1480
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:56,471
Oh,

1481
00:36:56,471 --> 00:36:57,304
I didn't know that.

1482
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,750
I haven't put together any,

1483
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,160
you know.

1484
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,440
All right,

1485
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,140
I'll call sal.

1486
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,400
Alright.

1487
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:00,910
Tell him no.

1488
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,840
Tell him what the fuck they asked.

1489
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,260
They asked me today if you're doing it.

1490
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:03,750
I hadn't heard it.

1491
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,311
Anything about it.

1492
00:37:04,311 --> 00:37:05,600
So now we know.

1493
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,490
Yeah.

1494
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,140

No music while the sex is going on and
