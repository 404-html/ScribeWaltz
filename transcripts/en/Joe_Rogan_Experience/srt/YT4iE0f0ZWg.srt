1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
I didn't know I talked
about it before I did it.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,313
Um,

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,640
I hung up.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,860
Or is this like online now?

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:08,280
Ah,

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:08,471
yeah.

7
00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:09,120
Yeah.

8
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,690
Um,

9
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:09,961
dude,

10
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:11,790
your Internet legend right now.

11
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,883
It's online.

12
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,840
Oh yeah.

13
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,540
Um,

14
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,373
oh cool.

15
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:17,851
Wait,

16
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,421
this is on.

17
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:21,450
Do you see that old couple who
couldn't figure out the Webcam?

18
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,710
No.

19
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,430
Was a funny like viral video of this old
couple trying to figure out how to work

20
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:28,740
their Webcam and the webcams.

21
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,220
Ron,

22
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,570
it's recording the whole time.

23
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,350
Oh Wow.

24
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:31,830
Yeah,

25
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,700
it's like cute.

26
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,230
Um,

27
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,780
did you imagine being an
old person dealing with the
Internet and now they must

28
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:40,770
feel ripped off?

29
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,150
I already find little things that
I'm already getting annoyed about.

30
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:46,970
Like I'm doing the thing where I
don't want to learn it be type thing.

31
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,241
You know?

32
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:50,030
Like how like my dad
doesn't want a iPhone.

33
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:52,400
He wants a phone and he
doesn't want anything else.

34
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,520
He doesn't want to worry.

35
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,353
You know what I mean?

36
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,403
Crazy people.

37
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:55,731
Right.

38
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:56,750
Those crazy people.

39
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:57,040
Hey,

40
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,711
I don't look it.

41
00:00:57,711 --> 00:00:58,780
I don't want no taxes.

42
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,180
Yeah.

43
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,811
I used to be like,

44
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:01,220
I want a camera on you.

45
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,810
And you're like,

46
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,050
heck for anything though.

47
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:03,441
Or I mean,

48
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:04,470
I find myself things like,

49
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,650
like maybe video games maybe
or something like that.

50
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,331
The,

51
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:11,950
the swarm of technology
overwhelmed my life so quickly.

52
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:13,330
I embraced it so quickly.

53
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,370
I used to joke about text messages.

54
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:16,420
I had a bit about it.

55
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:16,770
Well,

56
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,040
why is it good

57
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:18,560
miss?

58
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,370
It's been a long time since I left the
fucking phone on ladies and gentlemen and

59
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:23,420
I do apologize.

60
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,500
Maybe it's a color.

61
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,800
It's a late night podcast
folks and I had been done.

62
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,320
Don't fear factor all day.

63
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,690
I know you're tired.

64
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,070
I don't know what's going on.

65
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,950
Let's hope they don't call back.

66
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,000
Fucks are.

67
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,930
I like to hear who it is.

68
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,943
It's kind of,

69
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,930
this one doesn't tell you
a better phone though.

70
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,611
I gave up on it.

71
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:45,560
Just constantly telling me who's calling.

72
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,910
Sometimes I don't give a fuck.

73
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,340
I don't want to be that voice
to that electronic voice.

74
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:50,750
It fucks up everybody's name.

75
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,213
Well,

76
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,100
receiving call from Brendan Dunn
bubble shows it repeated over and over.

77
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,070
Or do you have any audit
answering machines laying around?

78
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,290
No.

79
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,091
You should read if you,

80
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:04,240
if you have one,

81
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,580
find it like if you have one in
your basement or your garage,

82
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:10,540
plug that shit in and just listen to
the messages of your life from what,

83
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,100
seven years ago or something like that.

84
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,240
And it was the most creepiest shit ever.

85
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:15,491
I was like,

86
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:16,001
wow,

87
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:18,430
I was in a weird place right there,

88
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,971
you know,

89
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:19,300
like,

90
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,133
Hey Brian,

91
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,080
I need you to work to double
shifts here and there.

92
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:23,890
And uh,

93
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,210
I think I've got my girlfriend pregnant.

94
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,790
We're going to go over and do the
bowling alley later and I'm just like,

95
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,624
what

96
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,230
you used to talk to when you were in Ohio?

97
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:32,471
Yeah.

98
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:34,270
Like people from Ohio and stuff like that.

99
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,890
It was so fucking weird.

100
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,960
Do you look back on people from Ohio?

101
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:42,961
Like they don't know
that Ohio is like escape

102
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:43,741
I think.

103
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:45,390
I think people don't know how
I would just feel trapped.

104
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:45,661
Like,

105
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:48,150
it's more like they
don't trap they I think,

106
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,230
I don't think,

107
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:49,501
yeah,

108
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:50,820
I felt trapped when I was there,

109
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,121
you know,

110
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:54,420
because you don't make a lot of money
when you live in Ohio for the majority of

111
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:54,811
people,

112
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:55,644
you know,

113
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,480
or at least a class I was in,

114
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,060
I would,

115
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,680
I was just working like job to job,

116
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:00,100
getting laid

117
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,400
off,

118
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,791
you know,

119
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,320
whatever cause do another job.

120
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:03,154
And it was just like,

121
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:03,670
wow,

122
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,660
$13 an hour,

123
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:04,900
Ooh,

124
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,430
$14 an hour or something like that.

125
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,630
And uh,

126
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,860
but I didn't have enough money to like
move or go to California that seemed like

127
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,960
out of like s ridiculous,

128
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,550
you know,

129
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,790
it's,

130
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,101
it's a,

131
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:17,100
it's hard to move from like everywhere.

132
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,220
Especially with family.

133
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,570
Like the neighborhood I grew up in,

134
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:20,470
is it the same way?

135
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:21,700
Like when I moved to,

136
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,940
I lived in Ireland for a year in
like 96 and it blew people's mind.

137
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,091
They were like,

138
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,890
how the fuck do you go to Ireland?

139
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,240
Like,

140
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,080
what do you just bought a plane ticket?

141
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:32,441
And I was like,

142
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:32,980
yeah,

143
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,850
you can do that.

144
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,300
So that's what you did.

145
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:36,520
You didn't know anybody in Ireland.

146
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,363
You just,

147
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,001
yeah,

148
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:38,810
I just went.

149
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,890
That's pretty savage.

150
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,783
I love that.

151
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,080
I love that idea.

152
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,250
That's awesome.

153
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,630
That must've been a hell of an experience.

154
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,540
It was fun.

155
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,260
Yeah.

156
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,093
You learn a lot.

157
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,750
You learned that things usually work out.

158
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,950
What was the motivation for that?

159
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,060
Uh,

160
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,611
I actually,

161
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:51,781
you know,

162
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:54,810
I did talk about this on
Marin's podcasts recently.

163
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,510
Just play Marin's podcasts.

164
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,460
We'll go back and take it was,

165
00:03:59,461 --> 00:03:59,791
I mean,

166
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,580
the short story is I was a,

167
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,630
somebody I knew drowned and I knew
and I had to identify their body.

168
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,110
Whoa.

169
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,943
And,

170
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,660
and it just kind of like,

171
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:13,140
I was like 23 and she was pretty young.

172
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,180
She was like 22 or 23 and I was like,

173
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:19,740
and she was going taking classes in
the summer to graduate college earlier.

174
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,000
And I just thought like,

175
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,181
oh,

176
00:04:21,181 --> 00:04:22,290
she's taking classes,

177
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,160
like doing all this shit.

178
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,270
She didn't want to do,

179
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,291
I don't know.

180
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,130
I just was like,

181
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:26,851
oh,

182
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:28,140
you can just do whatever you want.

183
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,003
Like,

184
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,110
and life's short I guess,

185
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:31,944
or I don't know.

186
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,133
But I just,

187
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,710
that was kind of the
motivation for fucked.

188
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,160
And I saw a cheap ticket yeah.

189
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,110
To,

190
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,943
to Ireland.

191
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,780
I think you might've told
him the story before,

192
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,140
but it's a fascinating nonetheless.

193
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,530
But we very rarely get to see dead bodies.

194
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,221
You know,

195
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:49,401
we,

196
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:51,050
it's so rare that you get to see one.

197
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,000
I remember when I saw my grandfather,

198
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,000
my grandfather died of cancer and when,

199
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:56,270
uh,

200
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,700
when I went to the morgue,

201
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:57,890
you know,

202
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,510
when they have all dressed up and shit.

203
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,290
Yeah.

204
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:00,591
Yeah.

205
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,880
And you still standing near the body.

206
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:02,980
I was like in the Cask,

207
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:03,591
I realized,

208
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:03,951
I was like,

209
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:06,440
this is the first dead
body I've ever been around.

210
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,930
I've never really been around a dead body.

211
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,490
It's amazing that all these people die,

212
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:13,010
but we do such a good job
of keeping bodies away from,

213
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,340
from people's funerals.

214
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:14,870
Yeah.

215
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,520
Because it's so disturbing.

216
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,730
Well,

217
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,421
like viewing,

218
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:18,590
so it doesn't,

219
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:21,530
doesn't never kind of tweak you out
when you think about a dude who be a

220
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:22,280
mortician.

221
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:22,521
I mean,

222
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:24,460
I understand that it's
a very important job.

223
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,910
I understand it's an important job.

224
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,601
I do get it.

225
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:26,761
And,

226
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:27,290
and,

227
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:27,531
you know,

228
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:29,060
forensic medicine and the idea of,

229
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:29,660
you know,

230
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,100
solving crimes and,

231
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,760
you know,

232
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,580
checking people's corpses
and shit like that.

233
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,810
Dr. Michael and I love that it's,

234
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,490
that's an amazing show that HBO show,

235
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,600
but doesn't it fucking freak you out
that they're handling dead bodies?

236
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,590
There's something about that
man that tweaks my hand.

237
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:45,260
Yeah,

238
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,450
just touch and dead bodies.

239
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,760
The IMD a just the possibility,

240
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:53,660
and I know this is not the case with
these doctors and I know it's most likely

241
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:56,720
not the case with 99.9% of the morticians,

242
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,860
but the fact that

243
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,980
there's like the 1% that it would enjoy
fucking moving them around and smacking

244
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,550
him and putting on little
shows from south that,

245
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,413
um,

246
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,780
Sam Kennison bit.

247
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,800
I fucking made me pee my pants
at first time I heard it.

248
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,980
That kid bit got me when he lays him
about doing standup comedy that bit,

249
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,300
and it wasn't even told by Sam Kennison.

250
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:22,100
It was told by a girl that I worked with,

251
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:22,641
ah,

252
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:26,360
I was working at this health club and
this girl came in and she was just fucking

253
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:26,871
laughing.

254
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:27,261
She's like,

255
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,094
oh my God,

256
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,450
if that it heavy Boston accent.

257
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:31,370
I saw a fucking this guy on TV,

258
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,230
Sam Kinison all my God,

259
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,430
he was so fucking funny.

260
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,061
Sue.

261
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,310
She goes and she did on the floor.

262
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,330
She got down on the stomach.

263
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,640
He didn't live,

264
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,473
keeps fucking,

265
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,130
she did it and she did a pretty good job
of it because I was laughing so hard.

266
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,641
I was like,

267
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:47,151
wow.

268
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:48,110
He said what?

269
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,270
Like that's the craziest
thing I've ever heard of.

270
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,170
And then I got ahold of the VHS tape
and I remember watching that bid going,

271
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,110
God damn like that's comedy too.

272
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,430
That's comedy too.

273
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:00,500
I thought comedy was that
evening at the Improv stuff.

274
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,780
I thought comedy for white guys was,

275
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:05,420
you roll up your sleeves and
you'd talked about pet food.

276
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,680
You know what I mean?

277
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,930
That's really what you saw on TV a lot.

278
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:11,570
And as a child I saw that.

279
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,231
And you know,

280
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,490
occasionally you saw something
on the tonight show like

281
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,390
delirious.

282
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:17,710
I don't know.

283
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,070
I'm a little younger than you.

284
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,790
When I was 14 I saw delirious
and Andrew dice clay.

285
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,820
That is special from the Tla.

286
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,691
Yeah,

287
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:27,280
that was,

288
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,620
yeah,

289
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,880
delirious is another one.

290
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:33,110
I didn't then raw or delirious might have
been so good that I never even thought

291
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:34,700
I could possibly do stand up at that time.

292
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,380
Really ridiculous.

293
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,071
I think it was,

294
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:39,530
I was getting older when
Kennison came around,

295
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:41,100
I was more confident to keep,

296
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,240
I think delirious was when I was
younger and I remember watching them,

297
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:45,170
my friend Jimmy lawless,

298
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:45,980
his house,

299
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,250
me and him and his sister were
watching this and it fucking,

300
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,500
it was so funny.

301
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:51,631
No,

302
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:54,410
it's not Jimmy John Battle
Raco sister for the record.

303
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,510
We're all sitting around
and we're watching it.

304
00:07:56,511 --> 00:08:00,050
And it was so fucking funny that we were
like embarrassed to be sitting next to

305
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:00,670
each other.

306
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:00,900
I don't know.

307
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,990
It was so good for the time,

308
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:03,220
you know,

309
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,790
over a teenagers and high school.

310
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,590
Eddie Murphy raw was just like,

311
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,830
or delirious rather.

312
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:09,560
It was just really good.

313
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,020
I rented raw recently again and it's it,

314
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,033
did you like it?

315
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,641
I did,

316
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:14,690
cause I wasn't super,

317
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,930
I saw it a couple times
when I was a kid and,

318
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:18,350
uh,

319
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,740
just rented it because I couldn't
really remember any bits from it.

320
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,630
And uh,

321
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,300
and it,

322
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,230
it's pretty good.

323
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,551
I mean,

324
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:26,130
I don't know.

325
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,080
It's something this down just to it too,

326
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,740
right.

327
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,421
Algia to it,

328
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:29,991
but it's like,

329
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:30,201
God,

330
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:33,100
he's wearing like this
leather suit that's awesome.

331
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,081
Filing suit.

332
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:34,750
It was awesome.

333
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,210
Yeah.

334
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,520
Martin Lawrence had some
fucking awesome suits too.

335
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,560
Black guys can pull that off.

336
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,161
You know?

337
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:42,840
Could you imagine if some
white comic went onstage?

338
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,490
You know,

339
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,630
Patton Oswald started off doing
all of his shit and a leather suit.

340
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,390
Yeah.

341
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:47,841
You know,

342
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:48,830
that'd be hilarious.

343
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:50,180
It's something weird about that,

344
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:50,600
man.

345
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,120
Black comics can go way more sexy.

346
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,710
They can go way harder.

347
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,883
Yeah.

348
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:56,770
No,

349
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,170
that's true.

350
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,710
It's funny when my friend died.

351
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,000
Do you know Chelsea Peretti?

352
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:00,961
Chelsea Peretti.

353
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:01,671
I know the names.

354
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:02,250
She's fine.

355
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,360
She did a half hour for special for
comedy central last year and uh,

356
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,160
she was going to wear the red leather
suit that Eddie Murphy wars delirious.

357
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,600
We're trying to find something.

358
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:14,130
I don't know if she
really was going to do it.

359
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:19,131
But did you watch the roast of
Charlie Sheen when Mike Tyson,

360
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,640
uh,

361
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,920
held out his fist and Steve
overpass facing him broke his nose.

362
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,151
That was,

363
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:24,901
that was funny.

364
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:25,501
But you know what,

365
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:25,731
what,

366
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,290
what was the funniest part
was that woman who was that?

367
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:28,910
Oh,

368
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,450
the one that just attacked
the one that went after s?

369
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:31,720
Yeah.

370
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,553
Who is that?

371
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,460
Amy Schumer.

372
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,500
Amy Schumer.

373
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:34,990
Yeah,

374
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,823
that's what it is,

375
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,191
dude.

376
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:37,360
She's hilarious.

377
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,253
She's really funny.

378
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,140
Oh my God.

379
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,090
She attacked Mike Tyson.

380
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,300
It was one of the most bold and
vicious insult attacks I've ever seen.

381
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,400
And Tyson tried to come back,

382
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,820
like tried to go after.

383
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,190
He said something like,

384
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:52,700
um,

385
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,020
I think if there was as many
digs out you that within you,

386
00:09:57,021 --> 00:09:58,400
you will look like a porcupine.

387
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,460
Something like that.

388
00:09:59,460 --> 00:09:59,611
Yeah,

389
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:00,351
that's exactly what it,

390
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:00,901
is that what he said?

391
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:01,590
Yeah.

392
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,670
And she just goes,

393
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,210
does anyone have a translator for that?

394
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,641
Yeah.

395
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:06,474
Yeah.

396
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,201
Yeah.

397
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:07,980
She was really fun.

398
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,813
God,

399
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,501
I thought it was good though.

400
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,220
The whole show.

401
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,710
I didn't it,

402
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,550
I didn't watch it,

403
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,720
but I heard her shit.

404
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:15,070
They were planning on Opie and Anthony.

405
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,100
I was fucking howling when she said
about Bruce Willis and I'm Charlie Sheen

406
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:24,070
being really similar because they were
both big in the eighties and now they're

407
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:26,710
having their old slots
filled by Ashton Kutcher

408
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,731
far less good.

409
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:30,510
That's fucking hilarious.

410
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,010
Yeah,

411
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,720
that's a great joke.

412
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,950
It's a really well worded too.

413
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,950
She's hilarious.

414
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,701
Oh my God,

415
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:38,534
that girl's funny.

416
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,300
Seth Macfarlane was an awesome,

417
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,450
it was awesome on that too.

418
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,201
I have to watch it.

419
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:42,841
I'll have to watch it,

420
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:43,440
but

421
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,861
honestly,

422
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:46,200
I don't enjoy roasts for the most part.

423
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,950
I usually find them to be mean
spirited and fucking weird.

424
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:50,161
I don't,

425
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:51,330
I've never wanted to do them.

426
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,170
I didn't want to fucking shit on someone
that hard right in front of them.

427
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:55,610
I just,

428
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,490
it's like I don't,

429
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,410
it's cute and everything.

430
00:10:58,411 --> 00:10:58,591
I mean,

431
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,460
it's fun to watch,

432
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:00,840
but no thanks man.

433
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,180
If everybody knows each
other really well too,

434
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:04,900
you know,

435
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,460
like if you're all friends,

436
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:06,761
you know,

437
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:08,080
busting each other's balls,

438
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,670
but sometimes it's not,

439
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:10,420
don't matter the gender.

440
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,370
Watch the ones where they
went after Pam Anderson.

441
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,400
I didn't,

442
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,520
I don't think I saw
the panel Anderson won,

443
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:19,590
but I haven't seen the
Joan Rivers one either.

444
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:20,540
Ruthless,

445
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,340
ruthless.

446
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,750
It's ruthless shit like
you sit and watch it.

447
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,210
I don't remember any specific,

448
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:28,520
I very possibly,

449
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,870
I don't remember specifics,

450
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,870
but I remember being like
listening to it gone,

451
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:32,271
oh,

452
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:33,830
I don't want to hear this.

453
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:34,161
Like,

454
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:34,771
what are you doing?

455
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:37,970
You are you voicing what the problem is.

456
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,863
It's funny.

457
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,830
That's the problem.

458
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,840
The problem is it's good stuff.

459
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,741
You know?

460
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:43,101
I mean,

461
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:46,190
you're insulting the fuck out of someone
hurting their feelings for no reason.

462
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,540
But to me it's kind of hilarious
and it's unfortunate that it is,

463
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,140
you know?

464
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,250
But when you're hearing her tee off on
Mike Tyson was talking about Mike Tyson

465
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:54,491
having,

466
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:54,840
uh,

467
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,650
a slut,

468
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,220
a tattoo on his face.

469
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,510
You know that my Ben don't know whether
to punch him or to finish on him.

470
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,331
Yeah,

471
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:02,691
yeah,

472
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:03,524
yeah.

473
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:03,900
Really.

474
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,950
I fucked it up.

475
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:05,551
I think too.

476
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:06,384
I fucked up.

477
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,830
But it's great stuff.

478
00:12:07,831 --> 00:12:08,940
But it's so mean.

479
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:09,181
You're like,

480
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:10,020
whoa.

481
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,990
Any Jessel nick had a
couple really good ones.

482
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,540
Good again towards Mike Tyson.

483
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,374
He said,

484
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,610
I'm paraphrasing,

485
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,310
but the joke basically was,

486
00:12:20,311 --> 00:12:21,144
um,

487
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,710
best way to describe Mike Tyson is the
same name of a Richard Pryor album,

488
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,930
meaning not nigger's crazy was
awkward and then nobody really got it.

489
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,381
I got it.

490
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:33,990
And it was and Patrice O'Neal or what guy?

491
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,070
And Nick.

492
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,903
He's a white guy.

493
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,960
Um,

494
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,271
but he,

495
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:38,850
he didn't cut guy but he,

496
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:39,181
yeah,

497
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:41,040
but he didn't say the name of the album.

498
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:41,910
Oh no,

499
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:42,310
he didn't.

500
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,750
Oh.

501
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,200
Oh,

502
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,580
I've said as in,

503
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:47,040
and that was the joke that he was
going to spell it out to everybody.

504
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,160
No,

505
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,971
he didn't spell it out.

506
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:50,310
He just left it at the
same cause I was like,

507
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,090
wow.

508
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,100
No the same way or whatever.

509
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:53,311
Yeah,

510
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:57,330
he is the best way to describe him as
the name of a Richard Pryor album and,

511
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:58,470
and Patrice O'Neil.

512
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,110
It doesn't go over very well on that tree.

513
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:01,560
Says,

514
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,250
uh,

515
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:02,551
he goes,

516
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:02,720
oh,

517
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,451
there's too many,

518
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:04,284
uh,

519
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,490
too many white people here,

520
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:05,821
man.

521
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:06,750
They're not going to get that.

522
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,611
And Jasmine,

523
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:08,011
it goes,

524
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:11,160
have you ever heard anybody say
there are too few black people here?

525
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:13,770
Oh,

526
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,760
that's hilarious.

527
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,080
Yeah.

528
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,890
Those roofs,

529
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,300
those roles can get mean man.

530
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,190
Yeah.

531
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:20,641
I don't know.

532
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:21,690
I haven't seen a ton of them.

533
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,310
I heard the Joan Rivers one is good.

534
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:25,650
I heard when she comes
back it's really funny.

535
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,550
Yeah.

536
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,750
[inaudible] back at them.

537
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,613
Yeah.

538
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,190
Wow.

539
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,023
She's great.

540
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,960
That documentary.

541
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:31,681
It was pretty good.

542
00:13:31,681 --> 00:13:32,370
Did you see that?

543
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,410
I have not seen it,

544
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:35,310
but a lot of people recommended it.

545
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:36,630
What is it called again?

546
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,000
The Joan Rivers documentary.

547
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,230
I mean if you Google that,

548
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:41,064
it'll come up.

549
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,923
Um,

550
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,510
I think,

551
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,650
what the fuck is it called?

552
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,490
Gooseneck.

553
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,323
Is that what it is?

554
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,493
No.

555
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,030
Do you think she writes all her jokes?

556
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:49,020
Did he think she has like,

557
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,000
she buys jokes.

558
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:50,821
She doesn't people,

559
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:52,290
but she probably rights.

560
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,240
I mean she's pretty
quick on the civil work.

561
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:54,970
A piece of work.

562
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,830
That's really good.

563
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,350
I knew it was some kind
of euphemism on facelifts.

564
00:13:58,351 --> 00:13:59,184
Yeah,

565
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,730
it kind of is

566
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,653
a lot of people.

567
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,920
Totally worth,

568
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,300
did you see her on Louie?

569
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:06,811
No,

570
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:07,290
I didn't.

571
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,100
Do you watch,

572
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,180
do you guys watch Louis?

573
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,610
I didn't see her and Louis though.

574
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,300
I was a funny one too.

575
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:12,751
That's,

576
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,501
she's really funny.

577
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:14,550
It's a funny episode.

578
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:15,450
Season finale or something?

579
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,471
No,

580
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:17,340
it was early in the season.

581
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,620
I got to get into Louie.

582
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,510
I cut way back on my TV watching.

583
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,500
I cut way back to the point where
I'm only watching like documentaries.

584
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:25,040
Shit.

585
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,730
Yeah.

586
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,563
I just stopped.

587
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:27,560
I mean,

588
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,750
occasionally I'll watch
like a ancient aliens.

589
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,341
Yeah,

590
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:31,091
I love that show,

591
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:31,421
man.

592
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:32,620
I love the idea of Vr.

593
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,250
That breaking bad Louie
breaking bad is awesome.

594
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,570
Breaking bad's at best,

595
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:37,920
you know?

596
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,390
But Patton Oswald said it best.

597
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:39,691
He said,

598
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:41,340
I feel like it's homework.

599
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,170
You know when you get into a show,

600
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:43,531
it's like,

601
00:14:43,531 --> 00:14:44,221
it's homework.

602
00:14:44,221 --> 00:14:46,420
It's like you've got to keep
up with these fucking DVR.

603
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:46,790
Oh Man.

604
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,150
That's it.

605
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,700
That's what like it's a godsend.

606
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,440
You just fucking watch it.

607
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,040
About about like mad

608
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,251
men.

609
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:53,860
Everybody keeps telling me to mad men.

610
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,670
It's amazing.

611
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,503
I'm like,

612
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:56,520
no,

613
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,860
we missed it so crazy.

614
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,410
Unless,

615
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,020
unless we get a wicked flu,

616
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,020
but you where he can tear through
the four seasons in a weekend.

617
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:03,321
I mean,

618
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:04,910
we're four seasons behind us.

619
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:07,100
48 hours of television.

620
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,120
I missed last though.

621
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:08,930
I can't stop.

622
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,210
I wish I could talk
about loss and theories.

623
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,980
I'm missing go fuck itself.

624
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,930
I Know Jack killed it for me.

625
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:17,840
Who send it in by the end
of the show there's like,

626
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:17,991
oh,

627
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:19,130
I guess they brought him back to life.

628
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,850
He was like completely phoning in it
and towards the end of the show Jack,

629
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:23,690
he killed it for me.

630
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,591
That was the doctor.

631
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,230
Doctor.

632
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,300
Doctor killed it for me.

633
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,320
I had to stop watching.

634
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,341
I had stopped watching.

635
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:28,521
I'm like,

636
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:29,660
this guy is not really there.

637
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,100
He is not in the moment here.

638
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,431
Okay.

639
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,570
I'm not believing that you just dumped
a body in this fountain and then brought

640
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:34,961
in front of you.

641
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:36,560
You barely paid attention deuce.

642
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,270
Right.

643
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,610
You know,

644
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,540
I kind of fell off with I,

645
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,380
I kind of fell off with
loss pretty quickly.

646
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,730
It was fun for awhile,

647
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,100
but it can't fuck with
Battlestar Galactica.

648
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,490
Battlestar Galactica was one of the
best unexpected fun shows to follow.

649
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,840
That's a good God damn show.

650
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,700
That was a really good fucking show.

651
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:56,840
If you want to like sit down.

652
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,280
I think they went a few seasons.

653
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:00,030
How many seasons did they go for?

654
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:01,010
Five or something like that.

655
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,510
Either way.

656
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,980
It's a bad ass fucking show.

657
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,060
That's a good show.

658
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,450
I watched the whole thing on
DVD almost after the fact.

659
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:10,940
Then caught up right at
the very last season.

660
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,440
You just have to be in the mood.

661
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,960
It's like when you tear
through a book or something,

662
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:18,860
like sometimes I'll have like three books
that I want to read and they just sit

663
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:19,400
there and I'm like,

664
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:19,590
ah,

665
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,470
I don't want to touch them yet.

666
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,790
But then when you do make a commitment
and you just fly through it,

667
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,650
a lot of people probably angry
at me for what I said about lost.

668
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,940
I used to love the sharp people don't get,

669
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,080
don't get me running and she gave,

670
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,001
I used to love the show.

671
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:32,650
I'd love to show,

672
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,250
but it did bug me for real.

673
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:34,950
It did bug me.

674
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,730
I kind of explained a lot of that.

675
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,720
Okay,

676
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,553
I believe you.

677
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,641
But you know what?

678
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:42,350
I love the fact that I
never watched the ending.

679
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,230
You don't see it like that because
it means you didn't get me.

680
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,190
You don't even need,

681
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:46,440
ain't going.

682
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:46,880
No,

683
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,631
he didn't get me.

684
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,464
Bitch.

685
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,640
I snuck away clean.

686
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
I no longer feel your pole.

687
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,010
Yeah,

688
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,180
I no longer feel your poll.

689
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,860
I'm afraid you're a dealer.

690
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:55,551
They're all dealers,

691
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:55,850
bro.

692
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,050
All these people with TV shows,

693
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,220
me included.

694
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,971
I'm guilty as well.

695
00:16:58,971 --> 00:16:59,804
We're all dealers.

696
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,060
Get you hooked on some fucking crazy shit.

697
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,130
I love being hook chain breaking bad man.

698
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,210
That's a great fucking show.

699
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,693
Ooh,

700
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,630
I don't want to be spoiler alert,

701
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:09,470
spoiler alert.

702
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,650
But when he had the dude locked up
in the basement and he had that moral

703
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:13,580
decision to make,

704
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,173
did you watch that?

705
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,663
You know he's had,

706
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,750
he's had some altercations
with gang bangers and stuff.

707
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,070
Yeah,

708
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:21,950
there's a meth dealer.

709
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,190
And do you remember the one we had
the guy locked up in the basement.

710
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:26,870
He had to figure out whether
you should kill him or not.

711
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,640
Kept this season.

712
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,870
That's how it was last season.

713
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:30,231
Oh,

714
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:30,770
last year.

715
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,670
I think it was last season.

716
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,130
Yeah.

717
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:33,530
Either way.

718
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,530
It was like one of the most intense
scenes like I think I've ever seen in a,

719
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:39,591
in a,

720
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,424
in a,

721
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,500
like a made for television show.

722
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,341
It was like a movie.

723
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:44,174
It was a movie scene.

724
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,260
So fucking intense,

725
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,094
man.

726
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:46,700
Yeah.

727
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,860
That guy can act as fucking ass off.

728
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,763
They're great.

729
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,200
Everybody is great on that one.

730
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,290
What is the lead guy's name?

731
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,570
Bryan Cranston.

732
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,930
And I've really like a Gus man.

733
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,510
That guy.

734
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,140
Really?

735
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,060
I don't know how up on it you are,

736
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:01,530
but the last few episodes,

737
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:02,490
Gus is really,

738
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,860
which one's the head?

739
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:05,740
The like the,

740
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,410
the guy who owns the chicken shops,

741
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,310
the head,

742
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,390
the black dude with the
glasses don't drug dealer.

743
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,373
Oh God.

744
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,070
The guy that,

745
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,903
that um,

746
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:20,510
Walter and Jesse workforce in the bay
time lever for fucking television.

747
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,060
I mean it must be right if you stop
and think about some of the show,

748
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:24,900
I mean mad men,

749
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:26,040
people are really into,

750
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,220
which I'm sure is good.

751
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,450
Three me people were
obsessed with mad men.

752
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,270
People were obsessed with you.

753
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,140
Even if you watch anything on NBC,

754
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:35,190
like any of the new shows,

755
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:36,480
they fucking all suck.

756
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:37,620
Like they scare me.

757
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:38,340
How bad is,

758
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,810
they have laugh tracks again.

759
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:40,011
They,

760
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:40,201
they,

761
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:40,660
it's,

762
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,120
it's like there's a show laugh
tracks are awesome with Christiana.

763
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,120
I think if you use laugh tracks and
you should have to not be good at it,

764
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,470
you should have to do it,

765
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,741
but you,

766
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:49,911
you,

767
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:50,461
you can't,

768
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:54,510
you can't like let it fade off here
if you're going to use the last track.

769
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,193
Yeah,

770
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,360
really obvious and fake people would
probably start losing their minds.

771
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,810
Like what would be like
driving people crazy idea,

772
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:04,170
man.

773
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,100
The idea of a laugh track where we're
going to tell you that it's funny.

774
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:08,820
We're going to end,

775
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,860
we're not even going to do it
in front of a live audience.

776
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,780
We're going to insert some fucking,

777
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,460
this is where we want you to laugh.

778
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:15,070
Stupid.

779
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,070
[inaudible] I think Tim Heidecker tweeted
or he's got somebody removed the laugh

780
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:27,531
track from an episode of Big Bang theory
I think or how I met your mother or

781
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,520
something and I didn't hear,

782
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,450
him and Dunkin were talking
about it the other night and uh,

783
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,860
I haven't seen it.

784
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,180
Well in all fairness,

785
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:37,580
what it sounded a little areas,

786
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,110
a lot of those takes,

787
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,730
could have very easily have been a second
and third takes of a scene that you do

788
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:44,810
in front of a live audience.

789
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:45,980
And they just don't get a laugh.

790
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,830
I think he had somebody
go in and just remove it.

791
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,181
Well it could be,

792
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:50,781
but I'm saying,

793
00:19:50,781 --> 00:19:51,020
you know,

794
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,460
sometimes you have to do a scene,

795
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,930
you know,

796
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,150
you know,

797
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,220
if you're doing like a live
sitcom in front of an audience,

798
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,790
like on news radio we
would fuck up or you know,

799
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,040
we would have to do something over again
cause they wanted to rewrite something.

800
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,380
And so we would do the
same scene several times.

801
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,760
So it could very easily have been that
even if you don't hear the audience

802
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:08,570
laughing,

803
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,050
it could have been that we would
the film stuff after the fact,

804
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:13,160
like there was be scenes,

805
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:14,390
it wouldn't work pickups.

806
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,231
So yeah.

807
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,921
And we would,

808
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:20,330
we would like make totally new lines and
the producers would like fake laugh on

809
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:21,164
the side.

810
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,990
They will like stand there and
[inaudible] and all of jokes,

811
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,903
Huh?

812
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,290
It was,

813
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,830
it was so alien mouse.

814
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,740
So bizarre.

815
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,960
I'm surprised you weren't
offered for two and a half men.

816
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,470
Where are you?

817
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,651
Well,

818
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:31,251
no way,

819
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:31,670
man.

820
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,650
I think you'd be up for that.

821
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,760
I'm not famous enough for that.

822
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:36,360
How long were you on news radio?

823
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,483
Um,

824
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,570
five years.

825
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,403
I think it would be awesome.

826
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,330
Different.

827
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,070
That's a different level of
fame they're looking for.

828
00:20:43,071 --> 00:20:44,960
They're looking for that
Ashton Kutcher fame.

829
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,033
That's several.

830
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,050
Ashton Kutcher not be
the guy from jackass.

831
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,471
Why is it,

832
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:50,970
it's so ridiculous this cause
the other ones on Twitter or,

833
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,680
or uh,

834
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,330
uh,

835
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,020
whatever nature pumps.

836
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,741
It's like,

837
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:57,190
it's like,

838
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,610
I think his Twitter followers has gotten
into everybody's heads that he's not

839
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:01,900
the guy on the camera commercials,

840
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:02,230
you know?

841
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,063
Well,

842
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,460
the kid is a fucking business genius.

843
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,960
He's got a lot of shit going on,

844
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:08,141
man.

845
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,280
He's very smart and very,

846
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:10,210
I'm not saying he's not,

847
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:11,320
I'm just saying I'm going to say next.

848
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:11,921
So ridiculous.

849
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:12,580
How like,

850
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,040
it's like he's looked upon
like a Brad Pitt or something.

851
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:15,541
Well,

852
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,470
he's the handsome guy,

853
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:16,711
man.

854
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:17,880
He's a gorgeous dude.

855
00:21:17,881 --> 00:21:20,810
He's like six foot perfect bone structure.

856
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,053
Yeah.

857
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,700
Well,

858
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,360
no,

859
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,820
for real.

860
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,850
I mean he girls love that guy.

861
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,900
There's a reason why they love him.

862
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:28,920
He's delicious.

863
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,761
Yeah,

864
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:32,950
I mean pretty well liked across the,

865
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:33,821
yeah,

866
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:34,750
he's now I get no,

867
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,171
I met him,

868
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:35,800
get it from,

869
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,910
I worked for them actually.

870
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,210
Um,

871
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:37,541
there was,

872
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:37,930
um,

873
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,790
I did a game show in my head this,

874
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,850
a show that was his
production company produced.

875
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:43,631
I mean,

876
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:45,040
I only got to meet him once very briefly,

877
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:45,874
but it was a nice car.

878
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,451
He's just,

879
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:48,340
he seems like he's got his game together.

880
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:51,970
It was let them do this crazy
show game show in my head.

881
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,560
It was pretty good in this show though.

882
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,990
I'm not saying I never watched two
and a half men in the first place,

883
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,240
but did you watch the new one?

884
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,940
The new episode with him?

885
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,150
It was very dark,

886
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,781
very like,

887
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:02,300
whoa.

888
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,540
They,

889
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:02,840
they,

890
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,430
they uh,

891
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,740
took a weird approach where
they're making fun of his day.

892
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,700
I kind of want to see it,

893
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,590
watched it before,

894
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:10,960
but I want to watch it
because of the controversy.

895
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:11,730
You know,

896
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,350
I want to watch,

897
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,650
I watched one episode once and
I thought it was kind of lame.

898
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,311
No,

899
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:16,270
I didn't think it was kind of lame.

900
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:17,140
I thought it was terrible.

901
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,550
I don't remember what was going on,

902
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:19,270
but I remember like,

903
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,500
like what is this?

904
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,251
This is,

905
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:21,780
you know,

906
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,650
when you see something
it's just like alien.

907
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,011
It's like,

908
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:27,700
it's so not funny that it
just te Torques your insides.

909
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:28,534
Like what?

910
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,430
And it was like that and so
I never watched it again.

911
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:32,010
But that happens on any sitcoms.

912
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:33,700
There's a lot of weird sitcoms up there.

913
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:34,151
I left.

914
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:34,451
I like,

915
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:35,284
I,

916
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,293
I uh,

917
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,310
I watched a couple recently and uh,

918
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:39,521
yeah,

919
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:40,180
they just,

920
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,901
they were baffling.

921
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,920
I don't want to say their names.

922
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:42,140
I don't know.

923
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,973
She's hard to do.

924
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,370
It's hard to do a sitcom right now.

925
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,200
Most of them really,

926
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,540
a lot of people get involved in the mix,

927
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,320
you know?

928
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,230
It's only when someone has like
awesome control over things.

929
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:57,600
Like when one person is artistic vision
can truly shine through like the south

930
00:22:57,601 --> 00:22:58,550
park situation.

931
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,980
Those guys are so awesome
that no one fucks with them.

932
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,810
So they just do their shit,

933
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,240
which is why their show
so fucking brilliant.

934
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:12,241
It's like there's no more clear APP
like point like of a of reference.

935
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:16,690
If you'd like thinking about like one
prime example of a show where you can tell

936
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:18,640
the artistic minds behind it.

937
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:20,890
Don't have any influence by anybody else.

938
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:22,030
It's how far right.

939
00:23:22,031 --> 00:23:22,780
Yeah,

940
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,320
it's cause it's such a money jungle.

941
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:25,730
He,

942
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,110
yeah,

943
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:26,330
yeah,

944
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:26,980
yeah,

945
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,161
yeah.

946
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:28,180
I would say he's right there.

947
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,170
Yeah.

948
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:29,530
Yeah.

949
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,640
I wish Louie was longer.

950
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,210
I wish they would pay him five times
more and just have hour and a half does

951
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:35,620
everything himself.

952
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:35,981
Yeah,

953
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,240
but when you watch that show,

954
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:37,970
it's so

955
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,601
short.

956
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:41,030
Like you really start getting into
it and then it just drops out.

957
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,440
It's cause it's like 22 minutes long.

958
00:23:42,441 --> 00:23:42,500
Well

959
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,130
do you think about doing everything
yourself and doing it on a laptop?

960
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,000
That's what he does.

961
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:47,961
He does it all.

962
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:50,690
He edits it on a fucking
13 inch Mac book pro.

963
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,800
Unless he's like trolling.

964
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,673
Yeah,

965
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,610
he's trying to play the like
fucking super hard worker do it.

966
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,630
But really it's got like a whole crew
credited you Mexicans with fucking stolen

967
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:04,260
laptops.

968
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,093
It changes.

969
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,320
It goes from like edited by Louis Cane
and sometimes it's not edited by the way.

970
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,860
Oh really?

971
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,470
So He has other people working with him

972
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,850
good that he can trust people
enough with his baby like that.

973
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:14,430
But because I,

974
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:14,901
you know,

975
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:17,870
I talked to him after he did
his first show at Louis C CK.

976
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:19,370
Everybody knows if you don't know,

977
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:23,000
stand up wise is one of
the best comics alive.

978
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,850
He's like the elite of the elite.

979
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,440
He's just a great comic,

980
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,041
you know.

981
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:28,580
But his,

982
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,650
his HBO show,

983
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,180
just what didn't click,

984
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:32,750
you know,

985
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,620
some people liked it.

986
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:34,191
Lucky Louie.

987
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:35,024
Some people liked it.

988
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,410
It just,

989
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,100
there was something off about it.

990
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:37,934
There was something,

991
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,050
there was two,

992
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,680
two ham handed and I talked
to him about it and I said,

993
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:42,921
if he,

994
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:43,900
if he could do it all over again,

995
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,760
what would you do differently?

996
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,201
He was like,

997
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:45,560
I would,

998
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,700
I would fire everybody.

999
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,721
He goes on fire,

1000
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:48,620
all the writers and he goes,

1001
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:48,920
I'm saying,

1002
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,521
I'm sorry.

1003
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,170
You know you're,

1004
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:50,661
you're my friend.

1005
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:50,991
I love you,

1006
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,880
but I need someone else to do this.

1007
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,140
I got one shot at this.

1008
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,580
I got one shot at this to do this.

1009
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:56,240
Right.

1010
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,720
Wow.

1011
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,291
And so you know,

1012
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:57,681
when he did,

1013
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:58,011
he did.

1014
00:24:58,011 --> 00:24:58,880
He fired everybody.

1015
00:24:59,150 --> 00:24:59,930
Now he's doing it.

1016
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,220
All of it himself,

1017
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,030
you know?

1018
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,863
That's amazing.

1019
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,380
It's so weird how he showed doesn't
fall any kind of guideline like,

1020
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,410
like one day his daughter
is somebody else.

1021
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,643
Girlfriend's

1022
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,060
daughters are pretty consistent.

1023
00:25:15,061 --> 00:25:16,330
I know her kids,

1024
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,563
not all the time.

1025
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,621
It changes.

1026
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:20,900
There was like a totally different
girl there the other day and I'm like,

1027
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:21,770
who's this girl?

1028
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,260
Are you sure?

1029
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,831
Yeah.

1030
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:24,470
Are you sure about that man?

1031
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,670
Almost.

1032
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,380
I'd probably say 99% sure.

1033
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,780
I would think to doubt about that.

1034
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,020
I was Louie,

1035
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,590
if I could deal with the daughter,

1036
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:36,440
I would think that he would work out a
deal with the daughter because they have

1037
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:39,670
a handful of episodes that
revolve around the daughters.

1038
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:44,240
I think I have to make sure that that
would take me out of the show a little

1039
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:44,570
bit.

1040
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,070
It's daughters kept changing.

1041
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,270
That would fuck with my head.

1042
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,900
I'll have to take,

1043
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,030
it kind of freaks me out.

1044
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:50,300
That's,

1045
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,610
I mean,

1046
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,800
I'm a huge fan of that show,

1047
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:55,880
so I'm pretty sure unless I
was just dreaming the whole
thing once rogue and was

1048
00:25:55,881 --> 00:25:56,690
kissing some guy,

1049
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:56,931
hey,

1050
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,250
fellow Google it.

1051
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:58,760
Don't,

1052
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,220
don't keep bringing me
into your fucked up world,

1053
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:01,910
dude.

1054
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,743
I want out

1055
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,120
the guy.

1056
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,220
The other guy was delicious.

1057
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,280
We need to take less of those,

1058
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,630
those Alpha brands,

1059
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,573
son.

1060
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,021
Oh yeah.

1061
00:26:10,021 --> 00:26:11,420
I'm excited about taking those.

1062
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,280
I'll give you something
so they're back in stock,

1063
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:13,730
right?

1064
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,660
Everything's good to go.

1065
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,470
Yeah.

1066
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,303
It's not going to talk.

1067
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,350
Did you see a website by the way?

1068
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,543
On the banner?

1069
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:19,971
Yeah.

1070
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:21,110
There's a banner on my website.

1071
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:22,970
If you go to Joe
rogan.net and click on it,

1072
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,850
I looked at them during
the code name Rogan.

1073
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:26,750
You can get 10% off of your Alpha brain.

1074
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:27,920
It's juicy.

1075
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,300
It's becoming an Alpha brand commercial.

1076
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:30,380
I think we better stop for kids

1077
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,020
right now.

1078
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,130
I'm excited about it.

1079
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,760
You're going to find out.

1080
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,600
It's interesting stuff,

1081
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:34,434
but you know,

1082
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,530
people know this case

1083
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,630
vitamins for your dome son.

1084
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,270
There's a thing on the page.

1085
00:26:42,271 --> 00:26:43,740
Two of these are like a

1086
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,340
medical editor wrote some editorial of
references as to why this stuff works.

1087
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,930
Is His name Joey Coco Diaz.

1088
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,470
Doctor Joey wasn't cock socket.

1089
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,870
Made this shit myself.

1090
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,970
My special blend.

1091
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,020
So I was over listening to a gay guy
the other day at the comedy store.

1092
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,420
We're over listening to a gay guy.

1093
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,960
I was paying too much attention and uh,

1094
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,350
he was going off on one of
these like how everybody's gay.

1095
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:15,060
Like we were looking at the billboard,

1096
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:18,360
which was that guy from CNN that just
moved to like Fox with Anderson Cooper.

1097
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,050
And he was like,

1098
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:19,740
just like,

1099
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,510
I can't believe he hasn't come out yet.

1100
00:27:21,511 --> 00:27:22,171
He's Super Gay.

1101
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:23,270
I know a lot of people that said,

1102
00:27:23,271 --> 00:27:24,250
he's like,

1103
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,053
oh,

1104
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,000
oh,

1105
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,301
I see.

1106
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:27,781
I had no idea.

1107
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:28,614
I don't even fucking,

1108
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
and you're trying to out him,

1109
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:30,350
look at you.

1110
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:30,580
And then,

1111
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,920
and then he was saying how that nobody,

1112
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,980
here's the words that he was saying how
the new president of a apple is gay and

1113
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:38,191
I didn't know that.

1114
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:39,810
So now I'm just wondering if it's,

1115
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:41,490
so now max really will be gay.

1116
00:27:41,491 --> 00:27:41,701
Yeah.

1117
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,810
We're going back to shiny white Arizona

1118
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,400
because people are always like back Sergei

1119
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,800
online man,

1120
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:50,400
you're old.

1121
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,671
Yeah.

1122
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:53,500
Well those are the best kissers online.

1123
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:58,630
The message boards and shit and Max are
always treated as pretentious slobs who

1124
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:02,260
can't work real computers like
the vast majority are really,

1125
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,920
it seems like there's a camp,

1126
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:06,930
there's a PC camp and there's a Mac camp.

1127
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:09,600
And one of the things that
people always say is Max or gay,

1128
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,990
but now max really are gay dude.

1129
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,833
Yeah.

1130
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,860
I wonder what gay things are
going to happen to our Max.

1131
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,703
They're the best.

1132
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,821
You're embarrassed.

1133
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,690
So I have,

1134
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:20,220
I have a PC and I'm,

1135
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:23,640
cause I feel like people with Max just
really looked down their nose at people,

1136
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:24,510
a pcs.

1137
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,180
And I know it's not cool to have one,

1138
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,510
but you know what man,

1139
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,050
I don't,

1140
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,360
I don't fucking edit.

1141
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:29,480
Yeah.

1142
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,590
Music or videos.

1143
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:32,070
Really hair CESC objectives.

1144
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,780
Brand new fucking kick ass easy.

1145
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,340
Like you weren't keeping
buck if you were given a Mac.

1146
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,150
Yeah,

1147
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,710
you would use that Mac and then
never go back the same way.

1148
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:42,230
If like if you get an iPhone,

1149
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,820
you might be the biggest talks.

1150
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,490
You shouldn't shit talker ever saying
droids the best and everything.

1151
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,210
Every person I know that you used
to be that person got an iPad.

1152
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,730
You're just like all those crazy wind.

1153
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:53,940
I'm just going to,

1154
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,390
you're just like all those
crazy windows people.

1155
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,380
I'm going to get attacked like I
don't care that much about stuff.

1156
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,510
It's crazy that we didn't
even think about it.

1157
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:07,460
It's so weird thing that people are
have amazing desire to be on teams.

1158
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:07,940
Yeah,

1159
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,331
sorry.

1160
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:08,810
Yeah,

1161
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,441
that's crazy.

1162
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:10,790
You can eat a dick.

1163
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:11,624
That's what I'm saying.

1164
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:12,950
Hey listen.

1165
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,950
The house pitches and the
startup times quicker than ever.

1166
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,410
I was watching something on,

1167
00:29:17,411 --> 00:29:20,570
on the online where they're showing
how quick the startup time is a windows

1168
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:23,630
eight and from the time
you press the button,

1169
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,980
eight seconds and windows eight
starts up and it's like really quick.

1170
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,651
It's like Doo,

1171
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:28,761
Doo,

1172
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:28,861
Doo,

1173
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:29,330
Doo Doo.

1174
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:29,931
So what,

1175
00:29:29,931 --> 00:29:34,931
when it runs it sucks theater but we
know who's freaking out about how long it

1176
00:29:35,361 --> 00:29:36,680
takes her computer to start,

1177
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,080
isn't it on most of the time,

1178
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:42,160
99.9% of what the fuck are you even my

1179
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,830
computer's a piece of shit and uh,

1180
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,590
it starts up fast enough for like,

1181
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,000
do you give viruses?

1182
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,410
No,

1183
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,100
never.

1184
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,150
You don't go to the dirty,

1185
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:52,571
dirty,

1186
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:56,690
dirty sites and then all sudden every
time you tried to grab the whole browser a

1187
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,240
fucking pop up pops up.

1188
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:58,900
No,

1189
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,171
no.

1190
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:00,400
It happened with my girls laptop.

1191
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,800
She had this thing called
malware or something like that.

1192
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,900
And you all were aware.

1193
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,770
I don't even know what it
is because I've been on,

1194
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:06,221
I don't know.

1195
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:10,850
I've heard about where male where all
your ticket about is this gay shit.

1196
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,180
All Qa.

1197
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:17,050
It was so bad that that that Norton
didn't do kid and do anything.

1198
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:18,210
None of the chances aren't doing.

1199
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,920
Jim Norton can do anything about it.

1200
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,943
It's like,

1201
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,420
and it got so bad that like there was
nothing you could do is I started to do

1202
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:28,600
registry edits and like
fucking tried to add,

1203
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:30,580
do safe mode things just
to get this thing off.

1204
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:33,010
It was like sending information.

1205
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,200
It was a reading passwords.

1206
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,110
It was,

1207
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,440
it tricked itself as a,

1208
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:38,740
uh,

1209
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,110
windows of virus protection.

1210
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,940
So on top of it it was like saying,

1211
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,250
here's the way to get
this off your computer.

1212
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,430
Click here to buy this
virus scanning software.

1213
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,030
And so then now you're giving your credit
card information and sending your shit

1214
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:55,450
just to get some fucking thing to unlock
on your computer to get your computer

1215
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:56,000
back.

1216
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,350
So I had to fucking company,

1217
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,450
like I even,

1218
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,800
I followed all these instructors.

1219
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:04,030
I finally pretty much just had to wipe
the whole thing and it was so common.

1220
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:06,520
I found out like this is a normal
thing that a lot of people get.

1221
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,370
This is not like some crazy
virus she got out of nowhere.

1222
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,541
Holy Shit.

1223
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:11,470
What is it called?

1224
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,673
Uh,

1225
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,100
something antivirus.

1226
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,393
Uh,

1227
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,790
I read something insane
like the number of,

1228
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:21,970
uh,

1229
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,300
what are the number of
computer viruses out there?

1230
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,800
What would you say it is?

1231
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:27,741
Oh,

1232
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:28,730
there's a ton of them.

1233
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,480
I don't know.

1234
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,960
It's 480,000 I would say.

1235
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,650
I'd probably say it's in the millions.

1236
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,253
Millions.

1237
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:41,440
I'm trying to find it
because it's so ridiculous.

1238
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,570
Okay.

1239
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,130
But Apple's sucking a Dick Lately,

1240
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:45,480
so I might be going back to PC.

1241
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,760
I just got that final cut pro
and I had to pretty much read,

1242
00:31:47,761 --> 00:31:48,990
learn everything.

1243
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,710
And I feel dumb because it's so s one

1244
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,380
that's just one program though.

1245
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,030
Well that's,

1246
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,590
that's one of their main programs.

1247
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:58,180
They pretty much decided
to take their main

1248
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,850
mad at all of apple because of one thing.

1249
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,823
Oh No.

1250
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,590
Well I mean if that's the direction
they're going where they're like making

1251
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:05,820
everything more,

1252
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,133
I don't know,

1253
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,770
like friendly or ha look
easy looking or you know,

1254
00:32:10,771 --> 00:32:12,720
simple cut and paste,

1255
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,321
you know.

1256
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:14,010
And that like,

1257
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,640
I mean,

1258
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,250
the old final cut pro is
like you had pretty much,

1259
00:32:17,251 --> 00:32:18,390
you could do anything you want.

1260
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,140
Uh,

1261
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,000
this is like you're,

1262
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,321
you're,

1263
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:24,150
you have to do like backwards steps and
do all this extra bullshit just cause it

1264
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:24,671
looks pretty.

1265
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:24,770
Yeah.

1266
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,051
Well listen,

1267
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:27,380
how crazy this answer as to
how many computer viruses,

1268
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,080
it's not exactly known,

1269
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,480
but most likely in the millions.

1270
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,930
The real problem is that
new ones pop up every day.

1271
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,943
Yeah,

1272
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,170
yeah,

1273
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,003
yeah,

1274
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,221
yeah.

1275
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:41,750
I guess millions.

1276
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,970
Millions meant well from,

1277
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,950
Oh that are out there right now.

1278
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:50,120
Or from the stealing your
personal information that exist.

1279
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,441
Yeah.

1280
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:52,200
I don't know ma'am.

1281
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,801
Possible.

1282
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:53,210
How can going,

1283
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,660
somebody might just be talking shit,

1284
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:56,220
I need to get verification.

1285
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,510
Milligan's you've got to think how many
people does it take to make one computer

1286
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:01,344
virus?

1287
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,580
Why is it just one dude alone just
gets crazy and makes us on his own?

1288
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:06,900
Or is there other people involved?

1289
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,160
Like how many people
are making these things?

1290
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,060
I think what it is though,

1291
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,730
there's a lot of these viruses
are just all variation.

1292
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,580
So like you'll have one
virus that somebody will
change something small in it,

1293
00:33:14,581 --> 00:33:17,370
like the ports or whatever and
it's called something else.

1294
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:17,611
You know,

1295
00:33:17,611 --> 00:33:19,380
I don't think it's like all new voters.

1296
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:22,350
People get out of it just like
mischief fucking with people.

1297
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,490
Apparently there's the ones that go,

1298
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,880
that's all their goals is to steal your
information or you're trying to get your

1299
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:30,740
credit card information.

1300
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,910
A lot of people have all
that stuff stored on their,

1301
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:33,210
uh,

1302
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,080
on their computers.

1303
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,620
You know,

1304
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,161
they have,

1305
00:33:35,161 --> 00:33:35,430
uh,

1306
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:35,670
you know,

1307
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,220
you have the,

1308
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:36,670
the,

1309
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:40,830
the ie wallet set up so that you have
all your credit card information.

1310
00:33:40,831 --> 00:33:41,940
So if you want to buy something,

1311
00:33:41,941 --> 00:33:42,840
you can just use that.

1312
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,261
Oh yeah.

1313
00:33:43,261 --> 00:33:44,550
I don't get to do that.

1314
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,740
I just memorize.

1315
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,750
I know my credit card
number is a Google wallet.

1316
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,680
Is that a new thing?

1317
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,970
I think they've had it for a while,

1318
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:53,520
but I never used it for real or right.

1319
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,470
Mind is going to use Google wallet.

1320
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,580
What an amazing name.

1321
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,691
Give them my phone.

1322
00:33:57,691 --> 00:33:59,250
They keep trying to get for my g mail,

1323
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:00,670
a phone number for that.

1324
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:00,991
And I'm like,

1325
00:34:00,991 --> 00:34:02,720
what the fuck do you need
my phone number for it?

1326
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:03,930
Fuck you dude.

1327
00:34:03,931 --> 00:34:04,340
Yeah.

1328
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,680
You know,

1329
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,080
email,

1330
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,600
you could recover it in case someone
steals your passwords password.

1331
00:34:09,601 --> 00:34:10,434
I'm an idiot.

1332
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,690
We just need you to know real good.

1333
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:12,810
You already have a secondary

1334
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,480
fucked up when

1335
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,200
you ran out of Gmail space yet.

1336
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:19,571
No,

1337
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:20,270
I have not.

1338
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:25,270
I at 96% that's why stop sending
pictures of your Dick all around town.

1339
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,020
But what happens is Christ kid,

1340
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:32,250
why can't I do that all around town?

1341
00:34:32,251 --> 00:34:33,084
His Dick,

1342
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,341
his caucus,

1343
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:36,450
like Banksy frank.

1344
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:37,320
See it's all around.

1345
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,520
Did I tell you how I have a fake picture
of my Dick that a fake one that looks

1346
00:34:41,521 --> 00:34:43,860
exactly like my bedroom
window said lately.

1347
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:44,551
I say this,

1348
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:47,190
I have been sending it
out to random people like,

1349
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:47,640
hey,

1350
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,240
why don't you come over and I'll just
send it and it looks like it would be me

1351
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:54,200
laying in my bedroom and I'll
send it to like a sentence,

1352
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,043
a little Esther.

1353
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,123
And she was like,

1354
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:56,641
oh my God,

1355
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:57,474
what the fuck,

1356
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,583
lol.

1357
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,280
And she goes,

1358
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,113
Ooh.

1359
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,950
And then I send it to
somebody else and goes,

1360
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,371
all right,

1361
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:03,690
that was uncalled for.

1362
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,310
And Yeah.

1363
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,600
Do people don't want you
sending the cards here today?

1364
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:07,721
It's not my dig it.

1365
00:35:07,721 --> 00:35:10,710
It looks like my bedroom and it
looks like it would could be my dick.

1366
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,910
The Dick has like this weird black helmet
on it and it looks like ridiculous.

1367
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:16,140
If you really think that's my Dick,

1368
00:35:16,141 --> 00:35:16,970
but all these,

1369
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:17,970
is it really though?

1370
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,980
It's just a picture I found on Google.

1371
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,903
Oh,

1372
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,560
why are you sending people pictures?

1373
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,530
So it's a real day when you do this,

1374
00:35:25,531 --> 00:35:27,230
you just put your head on the body or no,

1375
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:31,050
it just looks like somebody laying
what looks exactly like my better.

1376
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:31,650
Okay,

1377
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,310
I get it,

1378
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,001
but there's a real,

1379
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:34,060
there's an actual dictator.

1380
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,580
Then it's fucking his dick.

1381
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,080
This is a big cover story.

1382
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,411
Why?

1383
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:38,244
It's so lame.

1384
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,080
He's planned this out.

1385
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:41,010
He's got to get through it.

1386
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:42,240
He's got to get to this cover story.

1387
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,850
It's funny you got the same
grape juice staying alive.

1388
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,150
It's fucking bedroom pods.

1389
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,951
Look at his cock.

1390
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:47,784
It's a trick.

1391
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,711
I'm going to send it to you.

1392
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:50,311
I'll send it to you.

1393
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:53,370
Tell me how you would react if you saw
this or then you look at it and he made

1394
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:54,204
you look at his dick.

1395
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,770
It's a trick.

1396
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,371
It's trickery.

1397
00:35:56,371 --> 00:36:00,270
So how could you be shocked at all?

1398
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:03,140
Did anybody freak out that
you just send them pictures?

1399
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:07,320
Because I would send it to like
ex girlfriends and ex girlfriends.

1400
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:08,370
They don't want that shit in their life.

1401
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:09,204
No Way.

1402
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,860
Plus Dick and recognize your dick or
I'll send it to other common looks,

1403
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:14,694
deformed

1404
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,943
black helmet.

1405
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,120
Like if you hadn't Bangor and six,

1406
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,130
eight months say and she
started dating someone else.

1407
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:24,360
Do you think she would remember?

1408
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:25,194
You're like,

1409
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:25,411
what?

1410
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:25,860
It looked like?

1411
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,590
Identify your Dick Shelly.

1412
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:28,740
Oh,

1413
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,410
put Dick puts on gas.

1414
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,293
Was it?

1415
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,390
Does it have a boner?

1416
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,330
Is it flashed age?

1417
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,410
It's just pretty quick
head and like thick.

1418
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,340
It's a big thick,

1419
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:39,174
juicy dick.

1420
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:44,670
Let's call a three quarter hard
on from now on the Brett Farve,

1421
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,210
let's call it,

1422
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,970
cause he retired or is he playing again?

1423
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,420
He's gonna play with Michael Vick,

1424
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:51,661
right?

1425
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:54,000
Isn't that the story of what
he's going to go on the eagles?

1426
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,890
I think that's what I'd heard.

1427
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:57,330
I know nothing about football though.

1428
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,420
I might have heard that from Joey Diaz.

1429
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:03,270
They've got to get that cock suck on
and he's going to show him how to play

1430
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:04,440
fucking football.

1431
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,620
I was going to make them billions,

1432
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:08,770
dog millions,

1433
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,530
so new Orleans was awesome.

1434
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,131
New Orleans,

1435
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:14,100
you should have to have a passport
to go to that fucking place,

1436
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:14,760
man.

1437
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,050
That's another country.

1438
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,160
New Orleans is another country
that's a wild ass place.

1439
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:25,460
I have never been in a city that has
such a unique personality as New Orleans.

1440
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:27,360
It's like the whole city.

1441
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:32,630
It's small and it's cranked up to nine
like everything's cranked up and people

1442
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:33,671
are friendly.

1443
00:37:33,671 --> 00:37:36,510
It's fuck everyone's drunk as shit.

1444
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,030
It's like,

1445
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,330
I feel fucked up if you're not drunk.

1446
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:39,931
You know,

1447
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:42,360
Dunkin and I were doing shots with dinner.

1448
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,790
We never have shots with dinner.

1449
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,360
Dinner,

1450
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,080
we got down.

1451
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,261
I said,

1452
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:47,990
I feel like having some
fucking whiskey goes,

1453
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,751
it's New Orleans,

1454
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:49,021
man.

1455
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:49,854
It tells it to you.

1456
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,590
We're fucking doing shots
while we eat and crab cakes.

1457
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,750
We went out and we had a
show at the house of Blues.

1458
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,130
It was fucking awesome.

1459
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,370
It was the energy in the room was just,

1460
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,540
whew.

1461
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,373
It was fun.

1462
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,270
What's the hot chick
level for new islands?

1463
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,223
They're beautiful.

1464
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,520
A lot of beautiful girls.

1465
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:08,881
We,

1466
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:10,830
there was a burlesque show on after us.

1467
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,360
We stayed in watch a burlesque show,

1468
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:13,740
which is very strange.

1469
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,960
Like everybody like dresses up.

1470
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,000
Like they're from a different time period.

1471
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:18,360
Yeah.

1472
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,480
And they kind of like dance
around and some of it did.

1473
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:20,611
The,

1474
00:38:20,611 --> 00:38:22,680
although beautiful is quite aimless.

1475
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,990
It's like it's just a lot of
dancing around and you're like,

1476
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:28,860
I guess you're just celebrating how
she was dressed and dancing around.

1477
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,650
It was kind of fun because everybody
was drunk and getting into it.

1478
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:36,220
But it's so many drunks and
so many fucking happy people.

1479
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,740
Like I didn't see a single angry drunk.

1480
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,550
It was weird cause like
there's so many people drunk,

1481
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,181
not,

1482
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:46,810
here's one of the things that are draw
driver was the coolest fucking guy this

1483
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:50,800
to Jeff and Jeff took us around and Jeff
was talking to us about how he could

1484
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:55,000
only live in New Orleans because he had
lived outside of New Orleans only for a

1485
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:55,780
little bit.

1486
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,600
And he got in trouble with
a cop because the cop,

1487
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:01,900
he's talking to the cop about something
and he was drinking a beer on the

1488
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:02,510
street.

1489
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,080
The cop was asking him where he's coming
from and he didn't know that you're not

1490
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:06,490
allowed to drink beer on the street.

1491
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,310
You can drink beer anywhere.

1492
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:10,630
You just drink beer on the street.

1493
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,400
So while he's talking to the cop,

1494
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:12,731
he said,

1495
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:16,450
he opened up a second beer
drinking that and the cop was like,

1496
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:17,350
are you stupid?

1497
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,790
Is there something fucking wrong with you?

1498
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,421
He goes,

1499
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:19,901
where are you from?

1500
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:20,351
And he goes,

1501
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:20,921
New Orleans.

1502
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:21,131
He's like,

1503
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:21,580
all right,

1504
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,260
you can't do that anywhere but there.

1505
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,243
Right.

1506
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,121
And he was like,

1507
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:25,271
well,

1508
00:39:25,271 --> 00:39:26,081
fuck this.

1509
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:29,860
And he moved back to
New Orleans is the shit,

1510
00:39:29,861 --> 00:39:30,221
man,

1511
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:30,731
that is a,

1512
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:32,770
and we were in Meddory too.

1513
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,201
That's,

1514
00:39:33,201 --> 00:39:34,000
so we went in,

1515
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,590
me and Goldberg and um,

1516
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,690
and um,

1517
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:36,910
uh,

1518
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:41,530
delegate and say karate went and had
dinner out there and Dunkin and it was

1519
00:39:41,531 --> 00:39:42,011
fucking,

1520
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:43,270
what a great town,

1521
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:43,600
man.

1522
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,070
People are so fucking friendly.

1523
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:49,120
Thrown this honkytonk slash
sports bar on a Friday night.

1524
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:50,800
We're eating cheeseburgers
with these people.

1525
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:51,011
You know,

1526
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:53,500
and they're like their local hall and
our Saturday night like where do they

1527
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:54,200
hang?

1528
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,520
It was bad ass man.

1529
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,850
People you met there and Leah's fuck man.

1530
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,850
Friendly is fuck like what a great
vibe that town as ghost town,

1531
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,820
happy vibe.

1532
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,490
You see any of the ghost towns like
I don't know how much time dude,

1533
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,870
I had very little time.

1534
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:09,130
You know there's a problem with,

1535
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:09,520
you know,

1536
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,660
I fly in somewhere,

1537
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:11,471
it's like boom.

1538
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:14,650
First thing that I've got to go do the
the Wayans and then my comedy show and

1539
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:15,970
then in the morning I get up,

1540
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:16,541
I work out,

1541
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:17,260
I do the UFC.

1542
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,170
There's no time really for
like too much sightseeing.

1543
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,940
Unfortunately it's the
greatest job in the world,

1544
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:24,160
but there's no time for a lot of shit.

1545
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,720
But we did get to go down
in the French quarter.

1546
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:29,500
We walked around Bourbon
Street and like this is crazy.

1547
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,090
How is this legal?

1548
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,190
This is the weirdest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1549
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,210
It's beautiful.

1550
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:34,721
First of all,

1551
00:40:34,721 --> 00:40:35,510
it's a fucking thing.

1552
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:35,780
It's,

1553
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,410
it's really a national treasure.

1554
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,800
The fact that a place like
this exists and this uptight,

1555
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,920
stuck up fucking just scared country we
live in now that you could go to a place

1556
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:50,020
and it's strip club,

1557
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,000
bar food,

1558
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,080
strip club,

1559
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,520
bar food,

1560
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,540
strip club,

1561
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:56,860
bar foods.

1562
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,470
This is the recipe.

1563
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:58,991
Yeah,

1564
00:40:58,991 --> 00:40:59,770
chickens,

1565
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:04,770
Voodoo all up the street and it's just
a swarm like salmon spawning of humanity

1566
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,980
with cups in their hands and
everybody is fucking blasted.

1567
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,260
And we're just wondering
through the streets,

1568
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:19,261
checking out the scene and the bars of
amazing quote that it don't go the fuck

1569
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,231
Outta here.

1570
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:21,700
No one's close and me,

1571
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,481
no clothes.

1572
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,770
And then she just stays open.

1573
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:24,640
They're just open,

1574
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:25,480
open.

1575
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,410
That's tough though.

1576
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:26,980
Like we,

1577
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,370
I did a show with Stan hope
there a few years ago and uh,

1578
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,980
I don't think our show got
started until like 1130

1579
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,581
or something.

1580
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:36,050
So by the time we got out of there,

1581
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:37,670
it was probably about two.

1582
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,301
And we're like,

1583
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:38,421
well,

1584
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:40,010
let's go get a drink at a bar.

1585
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,280
And we go to this bar and there's
people from the show hanging out.

1586
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,520
And I'm like playing pool with a
guy and we're getting pretty drunk.

1587
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:46,591
And,

1588
00:41:46,591 --> 00:41:47,330
and I was like,

1589
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,230
what time is it?

1590
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:53,231
And I look at my fucking phone and it's
like seven in the morning and I'm like,

1591
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:54,351
Doug,

1592
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:55,610
it's like seven in the morning.

1593
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,660
We've got to like,

1594
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,370
we had to leave at like nine 30.

1595
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,353
What do you need?

1596
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,150
What was it?

1597
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,930
Green?

1598
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:01,290
Uh,

1599
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,150
I can make some for,

1600
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,993
yeah.

1601
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,573
Uh,

1602
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:05,770
do you have the crane?

1603
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:06,500
No,

1604
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,221
you've worn it for me.

1605
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:07,790
Remember?

1606
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,750
Is it in the fridge?

1607
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:09,803
Put it to what?

1608
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,120
Did we even finish the
story of what you did too?

1609
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:14,954
So we're like,

1610
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,453
no,

1611
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,190
this isn't the one that
most funniest things ever.

1612
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:20,024
Most funniest.

1613
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,721
Most fans.

1614
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:23,150
Almost 37 yet.

1615
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:23,541
Look,

1616
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,374
I got Internet,

1617
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,430
uh,

1618
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,330
talk in my head,

1619
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:26,631
man.

1620
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:28,340
I don't talk in full sentences anymore.

1621
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,080
It's more gooder

1622
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,683
marketer.

1623
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,290
But uh,

1624
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,140
you pretty much on a,

1625
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:36,560
I love the PR.

1626
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,600
You have all this big
thing with practical jokes.

1627
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:40,160
Like you did this thing
where you print it out.

1628
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,510
I think we talked last time
where you print it out on top.

1629
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,370
A top chef,

1630
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:43,990
top chef.

1631
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,050
We'll put it on the billboard.

1632
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,913
There's a little thing of him,

1633
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,110
you're pouring stew and he put it on.

1634
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:49,670
And then,

1635
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,390
uh,

1636
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:50,691
then,

1637
00:42:50,691 --> 00:42:51,410
uh,

1638
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,360
this time you w w the last,

1639
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:54,041
there's a,

1640
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:54,861
in my neighborhood,

1641
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:57,230
there's a vacant circuit
city that's been there.

1642
00:42:57,231 --> 00:42:59,090
It's been vacant for almost three years.

1643
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:03,770
And I was talking with a friend of mine
about how there's no whole foods in our

1644
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:04,680
neighborhood and it,

1645
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:08,690
silver lake's a pretty hipstery like
it would be a perfect place for a whole

1646
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:09,524
foods.

1647
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,311
And he was like,

1648
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:10,461
yeah,

1649
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:11,750
that would be a good location.

1650
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:12,321
And I was like,

1651
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:12,681
yeah,

1652
00:43:12,681 --> 00:43:13,514
it would.

1653
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,510
So I made these banners that said,

1654
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,710
coming soon,

1655
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:19,821
whole foods,

1656
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:21,740
silver lake and uh,

1657
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:22,100
I'll show,

1658
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:22,940
I have pictures of them.

1659
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,273
Um,

1660
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,660
and I hung them on the fence
around the circuit city.

1661
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,920
So everybody thought that,

1662
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:28,754
uh,

1663
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,631
that that's silver.

1664
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:30,530
Like with like all these like,

1665
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:31,360

1666
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,031

00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:34,130
in their neighborhood.

1669
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:36,380
And it blew the fuck up on Twitter.

1670
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,790
It was on like websites,

1671
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:39,800
like Los Angeles weekly
and Shit like that.

1672
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,040

1673
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,350
w it everyone thought
whole foods was coming.

1674
00:43:42,351 --> 00:43:43,700
It was like a huge deal.

1675
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,970
People got really excited and then,

1676
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:47,171
yeah.

1677
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:48,230
And then well,

1678
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:48,441
you know,

1679
00:43:48,441 --> 00:43:51,140
you should talk to whole foods and
say listen to the demand is here,

1680
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:51,560
right?

1681
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:51,711
Oh,

1682
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:53,830
I'm sure they've talked to them already.

1683
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,470
I mean that place has been vacant
for so much money to convert it to a

1684
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:58,520
supermarket or something.

1685
00:43:58,521 --> 00:43:59,600
I was too expensive.

1686
00:43:59,660 --> 00:43:59,960
Have you,

1687
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,510
have you always been a practical joke
or have you done that your whole life?

1688
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:03,550
Like do you have any like,

1689
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:07,220
like biggest joke he ever did or
favorite one that you've ever done?

1690
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,303
Uh,

1691
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,540
there's,

1692
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,880
there's one that you can actually hear.

1693
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:16,820
They played it on another podcast.

1694
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,950
Everything I know.

1695
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:19,941
Well,

1696
00:44:19,941 --> 00:44:21,720
I mean there's nothing
wrong with that though.

1697
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,423
Um,

1698
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:25,940
I played the,

1699
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,560
I had this card where you can,

1700
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:27,981
it's funny though,

1701
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:28,880
you have to say that though.

1702
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:29,750
You do kind of have to say,

1703
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:30,771
I don't want people,

1704
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:33,440
people like if they only heard the story,

1705
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:34,340
it tells the same fucking,

1706
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,680
we're assuming that they're listening
to all these different podcasts.

1707
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,550
I don't think people have enough
time to listen to this podcast.

1708
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:43,890
I think we're deluding ourselves.

1709
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,670
Maybe,

1710
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,680
I don't know if you're on
radio you wouldn't be like,

1711
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:46,891
yeah,

1712
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:49,020
well I said there's a mark
and Brian like two months ago.

1713
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,380
I might depends.

1714
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,670
I don't want to sound like I'm,

1715
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:54,001
all right.

1716
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:54,420
So what happened?

1717
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:54,521
Well,

1718
00:44:54,521 --> 00:44:55,590
you can hear it online.

1719
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,453
Um,

1720
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,320
I called my fried this card,

1721
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:02,280
it's called a spoof card where you can
call someone and make it look like it's

1722
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:03,990
coming from any number in the world.

1723
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,950
Like I could call you,

1724
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:06,810
make it look like it's
coming from the White House.

1725
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,733
And uh,

1726
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:13,380
so I called my friend
from his wife's number,

1727
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,770
his newly ex wife's number and I would
make jokes about wanting to bang his wife

1728
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:17,670
all the time and stuff.

1729
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,823
So,

1730
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,760
so I call him in the middle of the night.

1731
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:23,640
And I think I was telling him that I was,

1732
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,670
that I was going to go out on a date
with her and I wouldn't really tip my hat

1733
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,320
on whether I was joking or not.

1734
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,550
And I,

1735
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,490
so I call him in the middle
of the night from his wife's,

1736
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:35,710
from what looks like his wife's number
and I use a voice disguise or did make

1737
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,110
kind of sound like a girl.

1738
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,220
And uh,

1739
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,430
basically I tell him I that it's his wife.

1740
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:42,210
I'm like Yan.

1741
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,290
And of course he thinks it's her,

1742
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:43,501
you know,

1743
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:46,740
he just got woken up at four
in the morning and I say,

1744
00:45:46,741 --> 00:45:47,460
uh,

1745
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:47,701
you know,

1746
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:49,380
I went over to your
friend Brennan's tonight.

1747
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,310
Fucked up man.

1748
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,010
I think he raped me.

1749
00:45:56,011 --> 00:45:56,440
And he's like,

1750
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,273
wait,

1751
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,040
it's a fucking big ass.

1752
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,050
His mind.

1753
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:04,430
But then,

1754
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,270
but it all ends like it all ends up.

1755
00:46:06,271 --> 00:46:06,541
Laughs.

1756
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:07,350
He goes,

1757
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,071
cause then he goes,

1758
00:46:08,071 --> 00:46:09,330
where are you right now?

1759
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:09,841
And I go,

1760
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:14,070
I'm in the hospital and then
there's like a pause and I say,

1761
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,440
there's Chis all over me.

1762
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,211
And he goes,

1763
00:46:18,211 --> 00:46:19,290
fucking Brendan,

1764
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,510
I know is you fucking card.

1765
00:46:21,511 --> 00:46:24,450
I can't believe you're
wasting your card on me.

1766
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,370
How does the card work?

1767
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:27,031
Cause it should league.

1768
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:27,571
He just,

1769
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:28,590
you call an 800,

1770
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:31,790
like there's an 800 number
that you call legal.

1771
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:32,893
How's this speakers?

1772
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:35,280
Probably in the last
four it there's actually,

1773
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:35,511
it's,

1774
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:36,540
it's a lot of people use it.

1775
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:38,560
Lindsay Lohan and was known
to always use that for,

1776
00:46:38,561 --> 00:46:40,020
for for whatever reasons,

1777
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,060
but you can pretty much,

1778
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,510
it's like when you use a calling card,

1779
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,390
like an old school calling card where
you call an 800 number and put in your

1780
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:46,224
code,

1781
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:50,940
but instead of a code you put in whatever
phone number you want and then you put

1782
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:51,480
in,

1783
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,460
you hit like pound and it calls.

1784
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:54,060
Wow.

1785
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,600
Making it look like it comes from that
and nonmedical and it'll even say like,

1786
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,291
well yeah,

1787
00:46:58,291 --> 00:47:00,030
obviously if it's like red ban,

1788
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,140
if you put in his number,

1789
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:04,300
his picture comes up on your phone
or however ranks when he calls.

1790
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:06,060
How is that legal?

1791
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,513
I don't know.

1792
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,031
To me,

1793
00:47:09,031 --> 00:47:09,864
after a show.

1794
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,831
That's crazy.

1795
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:11,250
You could,

1796
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,530
you could cause divorces.

1797
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:16,250
Fucking murdered people.

1798
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:16,470
Yeah.

1799
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,150
You can do all kinds of crazy
shit to somebody who was,

1800
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,570
I'd never done anything like,

1801
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:24,330
I've never done any frame
on Blake malicious or all
the mean people in the world

1802
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:25,710
with some of the like that.

1803
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:26,441
Oh God,

1804
00:47:26,441 --> 00:47:26,830
yeah,

1805
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:27,990
they can do some damage.

1806
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,770
There's probably some divorced mother
fucker googling spoof card right now.

1807
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:33,131
Like,

1808
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:33,460
yeah.

1809
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,130
Yeah,

1810
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:36,580
I probably just got them
like 10 grand in business.

1811
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,400
You should start your
own spoof card company.

1812
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:41,471
Yeah,

1813
00:47:41,471 --> 00:47:42,460
you should run.

1814
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:43,563
Yeah.

1815
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,351
Yeah.

1816
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:45,180
Okay.

1817
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,380
Maybe I'll go away from
this comedy thing and

1818
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:47,940
yeah,

1819
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,480
I'll start a whole new industry.

1820
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,900
You need to really get involved in
helping people ruin other people's wives

1821
00:47:52,901 --> 00:47:54,820
secretly be,

1822
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:57,270
they asked the Madison
I'm cloak and dagger shit.

1823
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,840
Seems like they shouldn't
be able to do that.

1824
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:01,570
I don't understand how that
could possibly be legal.

1825
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:05,920
How could you possibly be able to pretend
you're someone else and call someone?

1826
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,540
I don't think that's legal.

1827
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:10,630
I imagine that that seems like fraud,

1828
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:11,613
you know?

1829
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:16,510
I mean it seems like there
would be some sort of a Weirdo.

1830
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,970
It's terrorist law to
protect you against shit.

1831
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,020
I think it falls in the same categories.

1832
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:25,320
Like if you write a letter saying that
year you're writing it from the White

1833
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,130
House on the returns,

1834
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:26,590
you know,

1835
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:27,000
laying on.

1836
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,833
No Dude,

1837
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:28,703
I don't know.

1838
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:29,971
I mean I,

1839
00:48:29,971 --> 00:48:30,804
you know,

1840
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,450
hopefully I'll get in trouble
but I think there's an APP.

1841
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:33,631
No,

1842
00:48:33,631 --> 00:48:36,840
I think that it's something that's out
there and I don't think it's illegal.

1843
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:37,201
Yeah,

1844
00:48:37,201 --> 00:48:38,250
there's a actually an APP.

1845
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,000
It's the voice cause you can
also do like unknown number.

1846
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,313
I don't know.

1847
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,330
There's an APP that you can
buy that's a voice recorder.

1848
00:48:45,331 --> 00:48:50,331
It is called a recorder on the APP store
and it's the same kind of idea where

1849
00:48:50,491 --> 00:48:54,510
you put in your credit card information
and then it filters the call through

1850
00:48:54,511 --> 00:48:58,230
this app or something like that and it
records it for you so you can record

1851
00:48:58,231 --> 00:48:59,940
phone calls using your iPhone.

1852
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,350
It's called record

1853
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,220
to record phone calls using your eyes.

1854
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:05,760
So yeah.

1855
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,870
Record other people's phones.

1856
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,141
Yeah,

1857
00:49:07,141 --> 00:49:09,430
it uses like same thing where
it's like a calling card.

1858
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,090
Yeah.

1859
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,360
This doesn't seem to go but yeah.

1860
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,730
I don't know how this is legal
but there's even a button,

1861
00:49:14,731 --> 00:49:17,040
this is all recording on
the apps on your phone.

1862
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:19,260
Kid might want to rethink your app.

1863
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:22,890
There was one point in time when
I had four Fart apps on my phone.

1864
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,510
I got a new phone there.

1865
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,680
There were a bunch of free,

1866
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,260
I know that it's all pretty quick,

1867
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:31,880
but I mean,

1868
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,550
whatever

1869
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:33,810
three Fart apps,

1870
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:37,620
what satisfaction that someone
have with the mega free fart APP.

1871
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,060
One dude put a Joe Rogan I uh,

1872
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,570
iPhone application.

1873
00:49:43,571 --> 00:49:45,360
Some somebody made one and it's not me,

1874
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,170
it's not mine.

1875
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:46,980
But he's selling it.

1876
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:47,640
What to do?

1877
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,473
I don't know.

1878
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:49,351
I've looked at it,

1879
00:49:49,351 --> 00:49:50,184
but he's selling it.

1880
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:50,371
Well,

1881
00:49:50,371 --> 00:49:51,001
there's a lot of,

1882
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:51,960
is he allowed to do that?

1883
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:52,973
I don't think so.

1884
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:54,980
Well,

1885
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,830
you're the guy who should
probably look into,

1886
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,180
yeah,

1887
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,320
well I just found out about it.

1888
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,040
There's a lot of apps that you have like,

1889
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:00,280
you know,

1890
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,120
for celebrities,

1891
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:04,610
they'll have like the Britney spears fan
app where it's just like improve your

1892
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,700
home address and that's
probably what it is.

1893
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:08,110
It's probably something
like that where it's like,

1894
00:50:08,111 --> 00:50:08,590
I just,

1895
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,820
it's like a buck cost.

1896
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:10,391
A dollar.

1897
00:50:10,391 --> 00:50:11,710
Some someone's selling it.

1898
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,573
You want me to buy it?

1899
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:12,940
Yeah.

1900
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,370
Fuck it.

1901
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:14,203
Let's all buy it.

1902
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,333
Don't do it.

1903
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:16,863
Let me say it might,

1904
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:20,860
we're advertising something
that's done for the wrong place.

1905
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:21,910
Hit the dump onto that.

1906
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,273
We don't have a dump.

1907
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:26,090
There's the seven second delay.

1908
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:26,440
No,

1909
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,350
we're live dude.

1910
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:28,070
All that creepy

1911
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,120
shit you said earlier,

1912
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,770
the world know all that shit.

1913
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:31,940
I said seven seconds ago.

1914
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:32,990
Hold on a fucked up shit.

1915
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:33,824
You were thinking,

1916
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:35,511
you know,

1917
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:36,110
um,

1918
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,160
it brings me up to that,

1919
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:37,400
uh,

1920
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,540
the rose thing again.

1921
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,390
This is a funny thing
about that style of comedy,

1922
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:41,900
man.

1923
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,860
That real mean fucking ridiculous style.

1924
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,353
You know,

1925
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,650
I'm a big fan of that kind of style of
comedy is one of the reasons why I was

1926
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:55,670
kind of upset when that Tracy Morgan
thing went down and I was like,

1927
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:56,180
you know,

1928
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:56,421
yeah.

1929
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:59,900
What he said for sure he
shouldn't have said that,

1930
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,370
but he's out there swinging.

1931
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:02,750
Yeah.

1932
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,830
Crazy pitches.

1933
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:04,221
I mean,

1934
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:06,530
he's out there saying the
most fucked up shit possible.

1935
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:08,120
It's not that he really
means most of this,

1936
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:08,590
right.

1937
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:09,411
This is his act.

1938
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:13,490
His Act is ridiculous and extreme
and that's what's so funny about it.

1939
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:13,850
Yeah.

1940
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:18,850
It's like this weird line though where
people start judging in as a statement,

1941
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,061
you know,

1942
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:24,620
instead of just as something ridiculous
and people are just looking for shit to

1943
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:25,380
get upset.

1944
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,000
Like people are so like,

1945
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,180
we're so fucking ripped off and
fucked in this country right now.

1946
00:51:30,181 --> 00:51:30,630
It's like,

1947
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:34,710
Oh Tony Bennett said something about nine
11 let's have 9,000 new stories about

1948
00:51:34,711 --> 00:51:39,711
that and not about like I and whatever
it is might sound like a bit or

1949
00:51:39,871 --> 00:51:40,141
something.

1950
00:51:40,141 --> 00:51:44,880
But like you hear about all this job
creation stuff like talking about we're

1951
00:51:44,881 --> 00:51:45,750
going to create jobs,

1952
00:51:45,751 --> 00:51:47,670
but just stop outsourcing them.

1953
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:48,540
Is that like,

1954
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,580
has anybody said that?

1955
00:51:50,581 --> 00:51:52,710
Is that like a popular belief that

1956
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,451
well,

1957
00:51:53,451 --> 00:51:53,810
I think,

1958
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,051
yeah,

1959
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:57,830
a lot of people think that the economy
will be much better if we stopped doing

1960
00:51:57,831 --> 00:51:58,101
that,

1961
00:51:58,101 --> 00:52:00,620
but then I phones would be $7,000

1962
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:01,741
and all of a sudden,

1963
00:52:01,741 --> 00:52:01,981
hey,

1964
00:52:01,981 --> 00:52:03,660
maybe everybody doesn't have an iPhone.

1965
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:08,990
Thank God there's so many places
that have been established.

1966
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:10,730
So many electronics
have always been cheap.

1967
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:12,111
Yeah.

1968
00:52:12,111 --> 00:52:13,850
Well it's not because
we're making them though.

1969
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,713
I don't think tank,

1970
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,021
I mean,

1971
00:52:15,021 --> 00:52:16,730
how many electronics do we make over here?

1972
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,870
Barely none.

1973
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,420
But like telemarketing
could be done here still.

1974
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:21,351
Yeah.

1975
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:23,180
That's my point.

1976
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:23,451
Was it,

1977
00:52:23,451 --> 00:52:25,160
I think those people work too hard.

1978
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:26,810
I think if you looked at those,

1979
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:26,990
uh,

1980
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,130
what does it Foxconn,

1981
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:28,491
those,

1982
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:28,850
uh,

1983
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,680
all those things online about the,

1984
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,660
the people who make those iPhones.

1985
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,280
Like they would never do that here.

1986
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,020
That shit would never get done here,

1987
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:37,763
would never get done.

1988
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:38,480
So yeah,

1989
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:38,600
it's,

1990
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,433
you know,

1991
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:39,740
it would,

1992
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,610
it just wouldn't happen.

1993
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,271
Well,

1994
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:41,451
no,

1995
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:42,200
they can have,

1996
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,390
the Asians can keep all
the electronic stuff.

1997
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:45,430
They do a good job of that.

1998
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:47,370
We'll just do every,

1999
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:47,780
you know,

2000
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,080
like the sitting in a chair trying
to sell people shit over the phone.

2001
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,260
What was the point about why,

2002
00:52:53,261 --> 00:52:56,110
why did we get on the discussion of
how much those things cost to make?

2003
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:58,343
I don't know

2004
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:00,960
why.

2005
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,080
Attorney to you Brian,

2006
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,300
that's when you know it's dark out.

2007
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:05,380
Oh Man.

2008
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,213
As we know,

2009
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:07,300
the end is near,

2010
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:08,410
but I'm turning to you.

2011
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,830
Did you hear about this fucking
computer dealers who figured out the uh,

2012
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,280
talking about people?

2013
00:53:14,281 --> 00:53:15,114
I'm sorry.

2014
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:15,901
Do you want to move on?

2015
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:16,150
No,

2016
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:16,690
no.

2017
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:17,310
Hold on.

2018
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,470
About people being outraged about,

2019
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,363
uh,

2020
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,900
the met Tracy Morgan.

2021
00:53:22,901 --> 00:53:24,100
People are definitely looking,

2022
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:24,934
you're right.

2023
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:25,350
Look,

2024
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:26,183
you need to be out.

2025
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,290
Have you heard about
the Tony Bennett stuff?

2026
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:29,850
Like when he was on Howard Stern,

2027
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:31,860
he said something about the singer,

2028
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:32,723
the singer.

2029
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,660
What'd he say?

2030
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,070
He said something about,

2031
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,453
uh,

2032
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:37,343
that the,

2033
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,920
the terrorists like nine
11 was kind of like,

2034
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:42,150
we've been fucking with people.

2035
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:42,451
It's like,

2036
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:42,721
you know,

2037
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:44,190
it was bound to happen sooner or later.

2038
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:45,810
I don't remember exactly what he said,

2039
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,501
but he was like,

2040
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:46,681
well,

2041
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,011
you know,

2042
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:48,720
we'd done fucked up shit too.

2043
00:53:48,721 --> 00:53:49,520
So,

2044
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:49,970
you know,

2045
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:51,060
I supposed to say that though.

2046
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:51,631
No,

2047
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:52,381
he got a lot of shit,

2048
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:53,640
but I think it's overblown,

2049
00:53:53,641 --> 00:53:54,420
which is,

2050
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,253
you know,

2051
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:56,880
like the Tracy Morgan thing,

2052
00:53:56,881 --> 00:54:01,170
there's just always something with
enough buzz words like nine 11 or faggot

2053
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,350
where the news can latch onto
that and just keep everybody like,

2054
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:04,471
oh,

2055
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:05,191
look over there.

2056
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:05,491
You know,

2057
00:54:05,491 --> 00:54:07,740
while they're like fucking
stealing all their money.

2058
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:08,574
And

2059
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:09,590
yeah,

2060
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:13,280
it's amazing that the
other thing that we accept,

2061
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,590
like pretty openly is
that in times of war,

2062
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:20,450
you're not supposed to do anything that's
gonna possibly damage the soldiers'

2063
00:54:20,451 --> 00:54:24,410
morale or a upset the way
they look at things like,

2064
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:25,190
you know,

2065
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,440
you're not supposed to
say things that would,

2066
00:54:27,441 --> 00:54:27,980
uh,

2067
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:28,580
you know,

2068
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,750
possibly upset them.

2069
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,003
You know,

2070
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:31,690
it's kind of,

2071
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:32,060
it's,

2072
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,630
which,

2073
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:32,961
you know,

2074
00:54:32,961 --> 00:54:33,771
totally makes sense,

2075
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,780
but when you stop and think about it,

2076
00:54:35,781 --> 00:54:37,640
like what are you asking them to do?

2077
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:38,390
Yeah.

2078
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:39,990
That should I do already in the ward,

2079
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:40,790
you know,

2080
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,380
don't you think they're
figuring it out by now?

2081
00:54:42,381 --> 00:54:42,531
Like,

2082
00:54:42,531 --> 00:54:42,951
wait a minute,

2083
00:54:42,951 --> 00:54:44,870
this is fucking bullshit going on.

2084
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:45,710
Do you think,

2085
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:45,930
you know,

2086
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:46,190
I mean,

2087
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:49,310
some people can keep it
together so people look,

2088
00:54:49,311 --> 00:54:50,480
people are meant to do everything.

2089
00:54:50,481 --> 00:54:52,100
Then there's people that
are meant to do that.

2090
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,420
It sounds ridiculous,

2091
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:54,920
but I firmly believe it.

2092
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,560
I think there's a broad spectrum
of human beings in this world.

2093
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:58,471
Yeah,

2094
00:54:58,471 --> 00:54:58,780
no,

2095
00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:58,950
it's,

2096
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,570
I don't want to bring
anybody's more out down.

2097
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,130
Why,

2098
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:02,963
why would you,

2099
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,270
I think narrowing,

2100
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,313
I mean,

2101
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,860
do you ever think about joining the
military at any point in your life?

2102
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,440
No,

2103
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,280
not at all.

2104
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,780
I've always had a problem
with like authorities.

2105
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,071
I did too,

2106
00:55:16,071 --> 00:55:18,110
but I also thought that
I needed discipline,

2107
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:18,680
whatever.

2108
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,200
That's when I was 18 I almost
joined thought about it.

2109
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,460
I wouldn't say almost join,

2110
00:55:22,461 --> 00:55:25,640
but I thought about it like as a strong
possibility for a couple of days,

2111
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:30,200
which to me at 18 was with my
fucking heavy add was a big deal.

2112
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,640
I think it would have done me good.

2113
00:55:31,641 --> 00:55:32,120
But yeah,

2114
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,730
I wouldn't have why always
admired people that did it.

2115
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,970
I had a few friends that were in the army
and I have a few friends that had been

2116
00:55:37,971 --> 00:55:39,770
in the marines and they definitely,

2117
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:41,570
it came back like more,

2118
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:42,800
there was something about them,

2119
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:43,041
you know,

2120
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:44,720
they had more confidence,

2121
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:44,961
you know,

2122
00:55:44,961 --> 00:55:47,300
they had like been through bootcamp
and all that shit and they,

2123
00:55:47,301 --> 00:55:51,320
there was a passage or coming of age
sort of a thing that I hadn't experienced

2124
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:52,131
and I was like,

2125
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:53,420
I think there's something to that.

2126
00:55:53,421 --> 00:55:53,721
You know,

2127
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:55,670
I think like boot is good for somebody.

2128
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,710
I was always trying to figure
out what's the best way to think,

2129
00:56:00,711 --> 00:56:03,650
what's the best way to
maneuver your way through life?

2130
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:03,981
What is it?

2131
00:56:03,981 --> 00:56:06,320
And I was the thing that I
was most uncomfortable with,

2132
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:06,621
so I'm like,

2133
00:56:06,621 --> 00:56:07,520
I'm fucking Lazy,

2134
00:56:07,521 --> 00:56:07,910
man.

2135
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:08,810
I don't like this.
