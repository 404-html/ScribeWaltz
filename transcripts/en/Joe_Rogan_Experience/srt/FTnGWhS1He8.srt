00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,530
Hello Freak bitches.
When we chipping away at this thing,

2
00:00:05,531 --> 00:00:08,230
like we know that politicians are doing
an act.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,880
We know that there when,
you know,

4
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:12,280
I've always mocked the way they
communicate,

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,690
like the way that give speeches with
long pauses and this very distinct

6
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:20,500
pattern of behavior that's completely
alien to anything other than a political

7
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,590
speech.
Like the only way this country survives,

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,230
you know,
like that kind of the strange thing that

9
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:27,360
they do.
But when,

10
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,860
when we're always like chipping away at
that were always trying to like,

11
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:31,930
get to like be real key,
get look,

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,210
we gotta get,
we gotta find out what's real and then

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,450
we get this guy who realer than anyone's
ever been.

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,320
Yeah.
And we're like,

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,370
well,
fuck this.

16
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,960
This is crazy.
And it scares us.

17
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,500
That's the point of that documentary.
We like to be lied to.

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,750
Wwe.
It makes us all feel calm and

19
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:51,520
comfortable to be given a stable live
than to be showing the real truth of how

20
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:52,870
fucked up and unstable everything.

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,713
Yeah.
I mean,

22
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,940
the trailer has this tech stover over
just like stock footage.

23
00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:59,350
It's just,
and it's so scary.

24
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,184
It's,
uh,

25
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,570
the,
the words are,

26
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,120
uh,
politicians lie to us.

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,530
We know,
they lie,

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,940
they know,
we know,

29
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,740
they lie,
they just don't care.

30
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,420
And I always like sent chills down my
spine because it's so true and everybody

31
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:15,550
knows it.
And yet we're all engaged in this

32
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:17,320
willful suspension of disbelief.
Like,

33
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:17,521
no,
no,

34
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:18,490
no,
everything's good.

35
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,813
No,
no.

36
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,570
Both Americans,
both the greatest country on earth and

37
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:26,200
it needs to be made great again.
It's like we're all in this weird,

38
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:31,230
like we're unclear on what were even
arguing for that is guys like do crazy,

39
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:34,910
insane cardio.
Bisping's got insane.

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,630
Cardio and the Diaz Brothers Cardio.
Yeah.

41
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,970
Nick has swam back from Alcatraz five
times.

42
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,360
Me.
Whoa.

43
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,250
Five Times.
I said twice once.

44
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:47,350
And he corrected me online.
He said five now,

45
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,310
but they,
they can fit race every year.

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,430
They compete in triathlons all the time.
Yeah.

47
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,111
Oh My,
you know,

48
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:52,651
my,
you know,

49
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:53,430
my dad,
uh,

50
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,270
actually,
uh,

51
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,510
he was in a plane crash in his early
twenties and it was off San Francisco

52
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,260
and need to swim a couple of miles and
that water real survive and Holy Shit,

53
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:05,820
he crashed into the water.
Yeah.

54
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,160
Yeah.
Most people don't know that it's,

55
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,910
it's,
it's pretty crazy.

56
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:09,960
He and,
and I'm going to,

57
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,790
I'm going to butcher the details,
but,

58
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:12,510
uh,
just,

59
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,321
you know,
from growing up,

60
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:16,190
this is
exactly,

61
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,230
um,
but what happened was he was in the army

62
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,590
and uh,
it was right around the time the Korean

63
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,320
War was starting and he was,
they were flying,

64
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:29,880
they're doing a routine flight or
something and they had to crash land in

65
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:33,630
the ocean and it was getting night.
And I,

66
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,790
I believed,
I believed the pilot died and I could be

67
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,660
wrong on that.

68
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,580
The pilot died.
But his other guy,

69
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:44,930
he was with survived.
So him and him and,

70
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,080
uh,
this other guy,

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,740
they were there was swimming to shore
and they got split up cause it was

72
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:51,450
getting dark at night.
Whoa.

73
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,090
And so then now they're swimming alone.
And anyone who knows,

74
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,910
you know San Francisco is cold room.
Yeah,

75
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,340
definitely.
Jazz water dump.

76
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:00,731
Dump,
dump,

77
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,151
dump,
dump,

78
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:01,571
dump,
dump.

79
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:02,840
That's where they breed.
Yeah.

80
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,790
Early.
Yeah.

81
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,590
Great.
Whites breed in northern California.

82
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,070
There's like a nesting ground up there.
Yeah.

83
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,180
Fuck on now.
Or you want to crash a plane?

84
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:13,000
They're not where you want to swim from
Alcatraz five times either in your

85
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,170
underwear.
I know.

86
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:14,741
That's crazy.
Yeah.

87
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,380
I didn't know.
I guess I've heard of that race.

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,890
They know,
but that's crazy.

89
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:18,724
You've done that.
Yeah.

90
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,240
Wow.
So your dad had a swim two miles.

91
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,130
Yes.
I'm like that made more.

92
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,440
I could have been more,
he'd fuck,

93
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,080
but it was a long,
I'm going for a couple hundred yards.

94
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,990
I started looking for a log to hang
onto.

95
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,700
And what is the difference in the
results from someone who does that?

96
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:38,530
Because I know quite a few people who've
done it that way.

97
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:41,290
They've had injuries treated where they
suck the fat out are

98
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,750
there isn't any,
uh,

99
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,190
any research to differentiate like one
of these treatments versus another yet

100
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,170
it's just not available.
So it's all anecdotal.

101
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,900
It's terms of like talking to patients.
It's happening.

102
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:54,450
I mean people are collecting the data
but it's just not,

103
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,450
you know,
it's not at the mature stage where,

104
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,100
um,
you know,

105
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:01,610
where it's available and we have,
you know,

106
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,760
published stuff to look at and,
and personally know of anybody who's had

107
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:07,620
really good results using the fat
method.

108
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,360
Um,
yes,

109
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:10,560
actually,
uh,

110
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,220
a physician friend of mine in Memphis,
Tennessee,

111
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,040
her name's doctor Laura Lenderman.
Um,

112
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,070
she has utilized that quite a bit and
she's been very happy with the patients

113
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:24,390
that she's treated in.
Naturally.

114
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:27,060
Some people do better than others,
but you know,

115
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,620
the,
the real,

116
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:31,470
the rigorous study of this though is
still yet to come.

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,280
That's really fascinating.
Do you,

118
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,410
have you considered trying that or you
just definitely,

119
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:37,770
yeah.

120
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,980
But you don't so far you just do,
the stem cells haven't had anybody

121
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:45,420
specifically request it and uh,
everybody wants to lose a little fat and

122
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:46,980
fix her knees.
Yeah,

123
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,170
I mean that's,
that's probably taking things in a

124
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:53,860
direction I don't want to be going.
But by plastic surgery there are,

125
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,910
we know there are a number of different
options in terms of where these sources

126
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:01,320
of the cells can come from.
Um,

127
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,360
bone marrow is certainly,
um,

128
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,480
had a lot of use and Daniel Needs da had
that done.

129
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,650
That's what he told me.
Yeah.

130
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:10,770
He had a pulled out of his hip and he
said it was brutally painful then he was

131
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:13,210
walking with a limp for like two weeks.
It's a,

132
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,800
obviously it's a procedure.
Um,

133
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,400
there's pain and there's,
you know,

134
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,320
morbidity.
There's a consequence to,

135
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,920
you know,
putting a sharp object into the bone and

136
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:24,070
drawing that bone marrow.

137
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,553
So it means,
uh,

138
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,770
a bad thing.
I don't like that word now.

139
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,770
It's,
we don't like it either.

140
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,960
In medicine,
more bid is,

141
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:34,260
we have our word,
we have conferences called morbidity and

142
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:37,170
mortality.
And that's where he basically own up to

143
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:40,170
things that you've done a terrible job
with or explain,

144
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:42,840
you know,
why somebody has died as a result of

145
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:46,980
your care.
And it's a awful thing to go through.

146
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,870
And it's critically important to be able
to evaluate yourself and understand what

147
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:53,940
things happen when they don't go the way
that we want them to.

148
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:57,500
So it's an important exercise that
physicians go through to,

149
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,000
you know,
review cases.

150
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,650
So I can only imagine.
Yeah,

151
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,011
no,
I mean,

152
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:03,830
especially if you're dealing with people
that are broken apart.

153
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,780
I mean,
essentially as an orthopedic surgeon,

154
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,090
you're dealing with people's bodies a
failed,

155
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,400
right?
Your limbs have failed,

156
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,210
ligaments have torn off.
The bone and knees have exploded.

157
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,940
I mean,
you've told me some gnarly stuff in

158
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:18,920
terms of the kind of injuries that you
had to treat,

159
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,770
and I could only imagine some of bad
things.

160
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:22,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

161
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:32,720
Okay.
