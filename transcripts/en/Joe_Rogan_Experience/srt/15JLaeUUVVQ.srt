The Joe Rogan experience podcast is 
brought to you by the fleshlight,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,800
and if you go to Joe Rogan.net,
click on the link for the flashlight.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,280
You will get 15 percent off the number 
one sex toy for men.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,230
Oh yeah.
Is that me?

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,840
That's me in the background and my own 
computer.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,910
The fuck is wrong with me after all 
these months of doing this.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,140
Still can't get it right.
I shut the phone off though.

8
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,190
I fucking swear to God.
I did.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,590
Bert crashes in the House bitches 
experience the machine crisis spreading 

10
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:39,160
like herpes all across America.
Dude,

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:39,880
you're spreading.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,060
You're a pilot and you're affected and 
you're taking me everywhere with him.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,480
No,
no,

14
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:48,481
no.
It's impossible to make someone famous 

15
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:48,920
if they're not talented.
You are extremely talented and hilarious

16
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:52,220
and that's why you're becoming huge.
But I'm fucking hearing you everywhere.

17
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:54,260
I got a clip that opie and anthony sent 
me.

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,120
Were they a thing?

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,740
But think about where that started from.
It started for me,

20
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,680
the one that had the couch here.
We're telling you how to crazy.

21
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:03,290
Drove out.
Oop.

22
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,140
And I was telling you,
they're great guys and you're like,

23
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,850
I'm scared of doing their show.
I had this crazy dream when you go on 

24
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:10,850
Opiod,
Anthony,

25
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,540
and you can see opiod,
like looking at his computer and he's 

26
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:14,540
like,
sweet,

27
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:14,540
you dream about me.

28
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,910
Tell me about your dreams.
And I was like,

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,350
God,
God.

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,390
But it was literally in this show is.
So I was telling Brian,

31
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:29,810
I sang it the,
at the braves game yesterday,

32
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,910
uh,
did the seventh inning stretch.

33
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,090
And I sit up on the dugout.
Nice thing last year,

34
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:36,450
right after the first season of birth.
Concrete.

35
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,160
And no one saying the national,
no,

36
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:38,390
no,
no,

37
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:38,690
no,
no,

38
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:43,691
the stretch take me out to the ballgame.
So I get up on the thing black blasts 

39
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:49,571
you.
When I did at my kids were there and my 

40
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:49,571
wife was their whole families there.
And I got up and everyone just looked at

41
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:49,571
me like,
who the fuck's this guy?

42
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,620
Last night,
yesterday when I did it,

43
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,650
the whole side knew who I was.
And I'm telling you,

44
00:01:54,651 --> 00:01:59,420
so many people were yelling the machine.
So fucking bizarre.

45
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:01,910
Right?
You're talking about every show.

46
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:03,290
I do every show,
I do.

47
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,870
Not only do people give me joints and 
go,

48
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:09,830
this is a present for the machine.
Some chick gave me three.

49
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,760
Vicodin was like,
I thought the machine would like these.

50
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,880
I was like,
are you kidding me?

51
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,120
Last night the most buckled down,
uh,

52
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,220
people in the front row is a guy and a 
girl just really like Range Rover 

53
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,720
buckhead type of people,
you know.

54
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,370
And she says,
um,

55
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,610
I said something and she goes,
someone yells,

56
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:29,690
let machine.
And I said,

57
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,130
I'll tell that story.
And she said,

58
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,390
powerful Bert Kreischer

59
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,140
talk to you on the phone.
I just talked to him

60
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,700
and you had just said something like,
you fucking kidding me.

61
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,880
Like,
it's bizarre because you cannot put a 

62
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:49,880
finger on who is,
who is a fan of the podcast,

63
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,720
you know,
like it just doesn't make sense.

64
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,780
Who is or who is it that has some old 
lady the airport telling me she loves 

65
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,990
it.
So many people listen to this guy who 

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,610
traveled to handle any.
My boss is like,

67
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:02,560
I just want to catch you before you hop 
on the Rogan podcast.

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,880
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

69
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,890
I was like,
how many of you listened to.

70
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,170
It's insane.
I was telling you,

71
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:13,171
and I will always say this,
the last thing I'll say about this 

72
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:16,081
podcast before we talked about regular 
shit is I had to call you from New York 

73
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:20,551
when I was coming home from letterman 
because when I sat down in a letterman 

74
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:20,950
dressing room,
all the stories,

75
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,420
they were like,
can you tell this time?

76
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,790
Remember the story you told them?
Rogan's podcast can tell that.

77
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,030
Okay,
there are six stories I read before we 

78
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,981
about to go on letterman that are all 
pulled from literally pulled from this 

79
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:32,740
podcast and I went,
Holy Shit.

80
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:35,320
And I literally,
I called my wife that morning and it was

81
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:40,321
a surreal moment after you do Letterman,
I'm driving to the airport and I'm 

82
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:40,321
telling her,
I go,

83
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:40,960
it's all fucking Rogan.
Like it's,

84
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,760
you know,
that podcast is just such.

85
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,520
It's such a different thing than is out 
in media.

86
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,500
And she was like,
you need to call him right fucking now.

87
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,080
Like I'm not calling joe to tell him 
thank you.

88
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,370
She goes,
don't get that.

89
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:54,460
Is your that is your ego talking.
You just fucking call him and thank him,

90
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,690
and I was like,
fuck it.

91
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:56,100
I was hungover,

92
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,130
done check.
Talk to him like that.

93
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,430
You got to do podcasts and started to 
institute the rape joke and a hard fuck 

94
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,230
session just to get that out of her 
system.

95
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,740
Her let her know what the fuck did you 
just tell me to do?

96
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,090
Oh,
it's my ego,

97
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,400
my ego.
Just take that.

98
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,550
You're going to inoculate her with some 
sperm.

99
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,440
Clear her of all that nonsense,
telling you what to do.

100
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,340
Dude,
that was the nicest thing ever.

101
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:27,341
You know you.
You're such a thoughtful guy and you're 

102
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:30,041
such a friendly guy and a happy guy and 
that's why all these good things are 

103
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:30,041
happening to you,
man.

104
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,310
But there's very few people would have 
called and left such a nice little email

105
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:35,720
like that.
It was very heartwarming,

106
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:40,721
man.
You're a cool motherfucker was like I 

107
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:43,181
said,
there's no way it wouldn't have helped 

108
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:43,640
you if you weren't already hilarious.
It's just we,

109
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,070
you know,
people found out about you,

110
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,720
but it's you.
It's not us.

111
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,130
Excellent.
It's been been trying to work that tell 

112
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:53,130
a story.
Machine age,

113
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,080
ages so hard.
It's not,

114
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,950
it's not like,
dude,

115
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:55,910
that's your.
Get her done.

116
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,040
Don't even have to tell the story,
man.

117
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,850
You're the fucking machine,
you know,

118
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,450
just inform them that you're the machine
now.

119
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,460
Just let them know and then that's your.
Get her done because I'm the machine.

120
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,060
Oh,
Jean shirts yet?

121
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,290
No,
no.

122
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,980
Uh,
those,

123
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,920
those guys that are making that 
documentary or making machine shirts.

124
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,780
Uh,
I am the machine washing.

125
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,730
Yeah.
You heard about this documentary,

126
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,790
they're trying to follow him around for 
a month and raising money or I send you 

127
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:28,160
a tweet and what is the,
what is it would explain it.

128
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,200
So there's A.
Oh shit.

129
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:31,890
I should've had it fucking.
Yeah.

130
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,860
Let me find the tweet.
Go to kickstarter.com.

131
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,580
Ask Bert.
Oh,

132
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,240
I bet.
I'm sure I did send it to you that.

133
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,870
Hold on a second.
It's on kickstarter.com

134
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:43,180
and see twitter's deal.
But deletes your messages.

135
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,830
If you leave them on there too long,
you don't.

136
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,950
They don't keep them meat,
which means someone's probably reading 

137
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,080
your shit.
So the oldest one I got from you is,

138
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:51,870
it's something about you,
uh,

139
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,220
doing that,
a thing that you had to do in Florida?

140
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

141
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,290
Well,
not anymore.

142
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,530
The uh,
so,

143
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,040
so the

144
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,040
first time we did this,
the first time I did this podcast with 

145
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,281
this guy,
these two editors in this place called 

146
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:06,281
big boss isn't here the production 
company.

147
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:08,000
We're listening to it and you were like,
you should do a show,

148
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:13,030
you should write a book called exit 
strategies because all the crazy shit 

149
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,430
that happens on stage to me.
So and I.

150
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,240
and because of that I've just welcomed 
it and it's gotten even fucking crazier.

151
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:22,450
Like the Thursday night on stage I had 
three black guys onstage and we were 

152
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,651
trying to write a racist white joke,
like a joke that would hurt white 

153
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:28,220
people's feelings because I've never 
heard one and I've never heard a joke.

154
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,670
Like what do you call a white guy 
standing in front of a judge?

155
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,480
The lawyer I guess like there's no like 
great racist joke.

156
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,610
So we were trying to write one and then 
these guys.

157
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,610
And I came to the opinion that only 
white couples have a hard time getting 

158
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:42,920
pregnant.
Like that's the big,

159
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,170
that's our tragedy.
But you never hear like,

160
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:45,970
oh,
licorice and right.

161
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,980
Were having a hard time conceiving so he
can.

162
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,370
They were like,
we don't know.

163
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,010
One black couple has ever had a hard 
time because even so we tried to write a

164
00:06:55,011 --> 00:07:00,011
hurtful white joke,
but we just couldn't find the right 

165
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:00,011
rhythm anyway.
So all these women who have already done

166
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:00,011
it by now,
no.

167
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,400
The closest we could find were Polish 
jokes.

168
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:02,600
That's it.
Yeah.

169
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,880
Polish jokes are effective,
but you have to be Polish.

170
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,160
That's gonna suck.
If you're the one race,

171
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:09,890
that's automatically considered to be 
kind of a knucklehead race.

172
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,210
Yeah.
How rude.

173
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,630
Well,
you know how the Polish people got that 

174
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,221
right?
It was probably because they were 

175
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:18,221
illegal immigrants,
right?

176
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:18,221
Nope.
What it was doing.

177
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:19,700
The Germans rolled through Poland,
the Polish,

178
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,730
we're really proud and they brought in 
and tanks and the police came up and 

179
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,190
started hitting the tanks with sticks.
And the Germans are like,

180
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:28,230
are you fucking kidding me?
Just and killed.

181
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,630
We just killed them off and they're 
like,

182
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,100
these guys are fucking fighting with 
sticks.

183
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:32,660
But they were proud they were defending 
their country.

184
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,180
So then that started the rolling of 
Polish jokes.

185
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,670
Even put ski came along in the eighties.
Who's uh,

186
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,810
you know,
I haven't put.

187
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,760
Ski was a fucking very famous pro 
wrestler.

188
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,320
Polish power.
I haven't put ski.

189
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,930
It was a little short guy,
but he was fucking super yolked.

190
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,030
Seriously?
Yeah.

191
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,810
Polish power.
I haven't put ski.

192
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:52,490
Yeah,
it was a tank.

193
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,390
No,
I don't.

194
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,080
Anyway,
so.

195
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:55,280
No,
I don't remember this.

196
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:55,490
No,
no,

197
00:07:55,491 --> 00:08:00,491
no.
That's how Polish no racist joke for 

198
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,360
wiping.
Anyway.

199
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:01,490
Yeah.

200
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,490
So that's what we were doing on stage 
and then we end up doing a shot of 

201
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,491
Tequila and then we're all,
we all get off and then with these guys 

202
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:09,560
heard me on this podcast and said,
man,

203
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,990
your shit wild.
So wild on the road and all these stores

204
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:16,991
were crazy.
Let's see if we can try to capture 

205
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:18,911
lightning in a bottle,
will follow you for a month on the road 

206
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:19,810
and just document it and see if we can 
find some good stories that happened.

207
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,690
Should should've fucking fuck came this 
weekend.

208
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,480
It was chaos this weekend.
But,

209
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,180
but so then they,
they made this proposal,

210
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:27,930
put it on kickstarter.
It's on kickstarter.

211
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,910
Brian,
can you find it?

212
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:34,390
If you just type in kickstarter and then
go and then in the search type and burt 

213
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,620
you'll find it and every dollar you 
donate you get something back.

214
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,350
Whether it's a credit in the movie,
like a thank you in the movie.

215
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,660
A personal workout session in my man 
cave.

216
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,990
Like a tee shirt.
He's got a man cave without alligator 

217
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,860
hands and everything for the whole 
fucking man cave.

218
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,700
You got a man cave in your house?
Oh,

219
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,190
it's the best thing that's ever happened
to life.

220
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,120
Wow.
Oh,

221
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,710
remember you when you show me your,
your,

222
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,730
uh,
your,

223
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:58,020
uh,
garage Mahal.

224
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,910
The Gym.
Yeah.

225
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,640
And I was like,
Oh,

226
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:01,230
I think I'm getting a man.
Man-Cave I gotta fuck it,

227
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:03,370
man cave.
So after that you got out.

228
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,200
Did you make it yourself?
Diy Networks?

229
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:09,870
Tony started Uzzah.
Jason Cameron came to my house,

230
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:10,950
a man cave.
My Shit.

231
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,410
Wow.
The best thing that has ever happened in

232
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:14,730
my life.
When does it air?

233
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,840
It's already here.
It's already here,

234
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,720
but if you have ever had something so 
positive happening in your life and like

235
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:20,280
a week that you're like,
I'm totally dying,

236
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,380
I'm going to die in St Louis.

237
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,740
No,
I'm going to die before that happens.

238
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:25,230
I'll never get to see the.
Because it was so cool.

239
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,120
I was so excited for it.
So yeah,

240
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,770
but.
So what exactly did they do?

241
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,110
The A to 60.
Someone's going to come rob me,

242
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,210
but to 60.
Don't give out your address.

243
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,510
Flat screen.
Three d TV's a keg rater,

244
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:42,180
a wine refrigerator,
a thousand cigar humidor.

245
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,920
All 200 year old reclaimed lumber on the
inside from a barn in Indiana.

246
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,250
They,
uh,

247
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,440
a desk in there as a back of a corvette.
It's kind of cheesy,

248
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:53,820
but it looks cool,
like,

249
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,830
you know,
and they fucking polished.

250
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,500
Then they,
then they sealed up the one part,

251
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:01,500
the old entrance.
It was a door and they open up a wall to

252
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:06,501
the backyard and put in these humongous,
a fucking open like French doors.

253
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,780
10 foot French doors that open up to the
backyard,

254
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,940
put fill.
The whole backyard was 1700 square feet 

255
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:14,940
of pavers.
Gave me a fire pit.

256
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,680
I mean you're just supposed to make the 
man cave.

257
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:21,681
And they were like and Tony's Goossen 
and Jason and I got along and they're 

258
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:21,681
like,
fuck it.

259
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:21,750
Let's call out.
It's like a hundred grand.

260
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:22,800
They dropped on this fucking mannequin.

261
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,110
It makes my shit.
It's like when you see me,

262
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,320
like when you see me naked,

263
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,510
I've outgrown my Dick,
my Dick.

264
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:32,770
Smaller than my waist.
More.

265
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:34,930
They should be all my body.
That's what my house looks like compared

266
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:37,600
to my man cave.
A big guy with a little tiny dick.

267
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,610
It's wow.
That's fucking awesome.

268
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,670
Just increased the value of your house.
Probably we won't be able to for that 

269
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,740
shit.
Yeah.

270
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,050
No,
but it's the best thing that we only 

271
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,050
hang out with Medicaid,
but I'm going to go inside anymore.

272
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,820
Do you have to pay more taxes when your 
house is worth more?

273
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,420
Even if you already own it?
Yeah,

274
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,910
I think so.
That's what they told us.

275
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:56,620
They were like,
is that true?

276
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,930
Is that like people are people at old 
houses?

277
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,260
I thought as if he's getting it 
appraised or if he sold it.

278
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,980
I didn't know if it will.
If you just added to it.

279
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,710
Finances were exactly.
Men Boys,

280
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Lego my thing.
He just call Santa Claus with free hug 

281
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:24,831
coupon cat pictures and heard those guys
like cats with Brian.

282
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,780
Brian.
He's just talking about 10 different 

283
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:32,780
things.
Oh,

284
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:32,970
is crazy.
I go,

285
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:34,140
do you have add?
And he goes,

286
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,610
yeah,
yeah,

287
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,130
maybe.
Maybe,

288
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,730
maybe it doesn't matter.
I'm highest fucking shit right now.

289
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:40,650
Shit.

290
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,710
We did a podcast this morning with a 
grower and he was with a grower.

291
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,520
Yeah.
So let's do some dangerous characters.

292
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:51,460
Those growers to grow marijuana.
It's not easy.

293
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,390
I tried in New York.
Did you?

294
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,000
Yup.
I grew up plant on my,

295
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,360
on my fire escape,
and I was just like,

296
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,870
I was just water it and I'll get some 
sun.

297
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,360
It will be perfect.
And then so then growing.

298
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,220
It's one thing.
Then you got to drive the shit out.

299
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,240
Like you've got to drive much.
How big did it get about the.

300
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,880
About the size of my hand.
Whoa.

301
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,150
The buds.
No,

302
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,530
no,
no.

303
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,670
You know,
let's just ballpark it and just say it 

304
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,670
was marijuana.
I'm not even sure what I grew up.

305
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,120
I definitely smoked it and I definitely 
grew it and I dried it and we got high,

306
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,550
but I don't know,
it didn't look like the kind of weed you

307
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:23,230
buy.
So it was just shit weed.

308
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:24,610
You fucked up really bad read.

309
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,100
Well I think it's like anything else.
You got to really look into it.

310
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:32,101
You know,
I have a good friend who is a 

311
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:32,620
professional grower and has been forever
and went to jail time.

312
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,710
Mccormick has been on the podcast before
todd's been.

313
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,020
He's a,
he's a legit grower though.

314
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,970
You know what I mean?
I mean he grows for,

315
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,500
you know,
to Spencer's.

316
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,030
It's so difficult.
Right.

317
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,980
It's like I felt you just plant a seed.
You gotta Let.

318
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,180
Well you can.
I mean it does.

319
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:49,440
It's.
It is wild.

320
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,390
Yeah.
But it can grow on its own.

321
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,210
Yeah.
But they would.

322
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,140
This was when I was working at Barnes 
and noble when we grew it,

323
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,730
so I brought up with good on the 
basement,

324
00:12:56,731 --> 00:13:00,690
read books on marijuana growing and you 
have to like put it in,

325
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:06,140
you have to put it in.
I'm like a moist towelettes in the 

326
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,641
refrigerator and let the stems like let 
us start seeding and then plant it like 

327
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,440
you can't just bury it.

328
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,950
No,
because people throwing the fucking weed

329
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:19,951
out the window when they were being 
chased by cops and the grows because of 

330
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:19,960
the seeds take into the side of the road

331
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:25,070
grows if there's definitely a pop liquid
or my parents stopped because there are 

332
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:27,810
tons of seeds under.
There are so many factors.

333
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:29,880
You have to have parasites.
We got parasites.

334
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:33,540
It's like little little bugs one time 
and they just killed our whole crop.

335
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,750
Something in our house.
Yeah,

336
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:37,590
and there's a lot of shit you have to 
worry about growing,

337
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:40,420
but yeah,
that also then you have the miracle bugs

338
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,830
that just.

339
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,760
It's not to me,
it's not like in this,

340
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,090
in this day and age,
it's like the only way I would do it,

341
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,120
the only for,
the only reason was because like they 

342
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,330
say that about mushrooms as well,
that when you grow them that you develop

343
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:58,331
a relationship with them,
like they connect with you because 

344
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:01,541
you're nurturing them and taking care of
them and then when you actually finally 

345
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,380
eat it,
it gives you even more of a high real.

346
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,070
It's almost.
Yeah,

347
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:09,071
because it's almost like they say like 
there's a difference between going 

348
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:10,790
hunting and buying a steak at the 
grocery store.

349
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,820
There's a whole process that skipped 
when you buy the steak at the grocery 

350
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,361
store,
so you just become this sort of non 

351
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:22,031
thankful gelatinous fucking Slob who 
just say you don't have to be able to 

352
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:25,490
get that thing.
That thing is already provided for you.

353
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:30,670
Were you the person talking about eating
only like eating only like deers and 

354
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,560
like running me,
it means so much sense.

355
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,990
I was on a plane piss drunk listening to
that and I was like,

356
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,720
fuck that.
I was my own personal theory

357
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,770
thing that things are difficult to 
catch.

358
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:42,570
I probably way better for you.
Yeah,

359
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,850
that makes sense.
Because you got to be clever to catch 

360
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:47,850
them.
You got to be clever to catch a deer.

361
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:47,850
You're going to be clever to catch a 
fish,

362
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,260
you know?
That's why they're really good for you.

363
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,290
There is so filled with nutrients in 
there.

364
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,480
They know that that's why they're 
running like crazy.

365
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,780
The reason why they're running like fast
and cows are just kind of wandering in 

366
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,660
excuse cows or retards and are supposed 
to take them out and you know,

367
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:04,100
deer are two.
They're just faster.

368
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,560
Maybe if that that's suppose to be a 
challenge because you're not supposed to

369
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:07,550
eat it though.
Kind of like a.

370
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,860
like a snake has crazy colors and it to 
warn you off.

371
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,040
If it had thumbs you,
it would be eating you.

372
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,630
That's all.
You have to realize.

373
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:19,900
I've had snake snake,
I bet to make red rattlesnake 

374
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:19,900
rattlesnake every.
I had.

375
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,880
I had one when we did the extra we did.
They had a smorgasbord of,

376
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,410
of crazy animals like lion and tiger,
and it was just fucking.

377
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,780
Oh,
I see

378
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,130
growing your own shit,
man.

379
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,190
I think there's something to that.
I think there's something to that 

380
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:36,190
because if you talk to a guy that's,
you know,

381
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:41,010
like that's gone hunting and they'll 
talk to you about eating the food that 

382
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,501
you caught yourself,
whether it's a fucking rattlesnake or 

383
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:44,750
this whole shows on it about where they 
go.

384
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:49,751
And you know,
when people go and sustain themselves 

385
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:49,751
off the land,
like there was that guy that was on your

386
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:50,460
network.
Um,

387
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,290
but wild within Don wildman did the 
wildest thing.

388
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,910
I don't remember his name.
Yeah,

389
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,360
yeah,
yeah.

390
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,280
Is that still going on?
Is that they cancel it?

391
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:00,710
No,
but I want that dog that he went hunting

392
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,330
boars with.
That's the fucking dog.

393
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,470
Oh,
the dogs that logged they show is this 

394
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,290
show was really hardcore and they,
those dogs attack people though this dog

395
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,030
hits attack people less than those dogs.

396
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,840
Are you shitting my most pits or not?
Their dog aggressive number.

397
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,310
Then there are people,
aggressive dreams.

398
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,380
Are they.
Because my dog,

399
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,900
I used to have a pit that was a Hawaiian
boar hunting.

400
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,450
I want the Doggos Argentinos.
Yeah,

401
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:31,451
those are the dangerous ones.
Those are those ones that bite people 

402
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:31,451
don't like the size of a great Dane,
but the body of a pit,

403
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,600
huge pit bulls is what they are and they
use them for hunting bores.

404
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,810
They hold onto the board and then this 
guy comes along on fucking the travel 

405
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,650
channel and stabs him to death with a 
knife.

406
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,480
That's how they killed the bore.
They grab it and then you come along and

407
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:51,380
slice it's fucking throat right there.
I mean it is down and gritty.

408
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,020
And I watched that show and I was like,
wow,

409
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:56,180
what a show.
This is like this show.

410
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,810
I mean we used to have a show.
It's a fucking good God damn show.

411
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:00,740
Why did they cancel it?

412
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,160
You know,
it's the same shit that happens with 

413
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,160
everything good.
What it is,

414
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,980
it's too much right up front for 
everyone.

415
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:11,981
So what they'll do now,
I guarantee you tlcl do a show called 

416
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:12,800
boar hunting and that'll be the show.
That's how these,

417
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,080
like I did what I did when we did birth 
conquer,

418
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:17,240
we went a cafetiere scrabbling where you
put your hand on.

419
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:17,840
Oh yeah,
yeah.

420
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:20,660
If I catch a fish called noodling,
noodling catfish,

421
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:23,680
grappling dog in whatever redneck plays 
you're in,

422
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,630
they have a different name for it.
Grappling,

423
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,210
grappling,
Eman Gary a shit.

424
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,460
Fuck.
Yeah,

425
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,630
because you're doing it with rednecks.
Who you never think they felt the whole 

426
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:35,670
plant through.
The guys like Greg.

427
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,030
He goes,
he's go on and shelby,

428
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:44,110
I will hand back in Uganda and Rwanda 
and you're going to nibble now when you 

429
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:50,050
feel a nipple,
you better hold on that day as a and not

430
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,340
a alligator snapping turtle or a beaver.

431
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,390
I was like,
there's a fucking.

432
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,640
There could be an alligator in there.
Like there could be.

433
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,700
I was like,
how can we get something other than my 

434
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:01,700
fucking hand in there?
Something that we don't want.

435
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,720
I want my hand and then they just like,
don't be a pussy boy.

436
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,340
Oh my God,
man.

437
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:09,390
Let me tell you something.
When that fish bites on God,

438
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:10,910
you feel like a fucking warrior.
Like,

439
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,970
oh cause it,
cause it's,

440
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,070
it's,
it's go time,

441
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:15,330
like I'm waving at you,
just,

442
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,500
it's like Flash Gordon,
you got your hand in a hole and you're 

443
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,940
and you're underwater and you're waving 
your arm and back in a hole and you can 

444
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,851
hear the thump.
It thumps when it starts rolling and 

445
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:27,180
you're like,
and you can hear it under water,

446
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:29,370
right?
Because it took fucking 50 pound catfish

447
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,980
and then all of a sudden he goes,
you won't feel to nibble.

448
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:32,610
I was like,
yeah,

449
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,550
fuck a car door slamming on my hand,
just Bam.

450
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:39,450
And I pull a 50 pound kapish out of a 20
pound hole.

451
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,520
It's like pulling a kindergarten round,
a whole just like,

452
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,080
what the fuck is it?
It's massive.

453
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,620
And then I panicked.
I just dropped it.

454
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:47,110
I go get him.

455
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,220
Then they started,
they go,

456
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:52,230
what the fuck is you doing?
Get up on it.

457
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,660
And I was like,
I have no fucking idea to get.

458
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,150
Um.
So did you still have it?

459
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,350
It was flipping around.
It was,

460
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,910
there were three girls there because 
it's,

461
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,970
the whole pitch was that they do it with
girls and the girls definitely do it.

462
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,000
The girls definitely catch catfish,
but the dudes like set it up,

463
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,640
you can totally tell the dudes are 
setting it up and uh,

464
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:10,530
and then the catfish whereby a boat 
dock,

465
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,800
a ramp where a boat goes in and so the 
catfish,

466
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,890
I throw it and it became a boise and it 
went over to the dock and he started 

467
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:21,030
swimming up the boat,
ramp up the boat ramp.

468
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,980
So I just run and just jumped all over 
you.

469
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:27,981
A fumble lands on the catfish and just 
like all my body weight grabbed it.

470
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,790
And then a lot of them have spines to be
really careful.

471
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,840
I wish I had thought that whole thing 
through and stab,

472
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,590
you know.
No,

473
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,080
I was totally fine.
Oh my God.

474
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,560
And I've been stabbed by campus,
but if you see their spines,

475
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:42,780
yeah,
I used to fish a lot when I was a kid.

476
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,880
Really uncertain cat fish when you catch
them,

477
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:45,780
when you pick them up,
man,

478
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,990
get stabbed by their dorsal fins.
Know there's pictures of it online if 

479
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,660
you want to see how big the catfish was.
It was,

480
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,630
it was monster and I just dove on it and
then,

481
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,040
and then,
then I was like,

482
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,830
I was a fucking liberal because liberal 
bent again because they were like,

483
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,500
I was.
I was like,

484
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,710
you know,
I'm all excited.

485
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,050
I'm jazz,
I'm talking to the other redneck.

486
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:05,010
And I'm like,
Oh man,

487
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,940
that was fucking intense.

488
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,750
Like,
that's so crazy.

489
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:09,270
Like what fucking makes her bite my what
makes it bite my hand?

490
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:11,280
And he goes,
well she protecting her babies and I was

491
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:12,030
like,
what?

492
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,680
He's like,
there's babies in that hole.

493
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,660
That's why she's protecting her babies.
And I went,

494
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,190
I just pulled a fucking mom away from 
her kids and I started thinking like,

495
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:25,470
like what if someone just lifted my wife
away from my children and they were just

496
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:30,501
sitting in a hole going,
does anyone know how to make a grilled 

497
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:30,840
cheese?
Like just fucking panicking.

498
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:33,180
You're a Dick Burke.
So then so then I get down,

499
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,720
I get down on the thing and I were 
trying to run water through it skills.

500
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:41,721
I'm just pushing it back and forth like 
I'm fucking just so that's how you keep 

501
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:41,721
it alive,
keep it alive,

502
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:43,320
and then I just let it go and he just 
went and he goes,

503
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,550
what the fuck did you do?

504
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,350
I was like,
she got away.

505
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:47,950
I didn't mean for it to happen.
He was like,

506
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,910
Oh,
you lied.

507
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,020
You have fucking told her that.
I was like,

508
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:51,490
I can't let.
I can't let that happen.

509
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,090
I'm jumping off a fucking God damn 
bridge.

510
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,440
Extra catfish.
Went back there and ate dollars.

511
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Kids so stressed out.
We ended up catching for the entire 

512
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,020
days.
We ended up back there.

513
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,410
A bunch of them just slaughtered their 
babies and now there's a catfish,

514
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,460
a show the show.
So that was what my whole point of 

515
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,970
saying that is that that's how that 
works is that you'll,

516
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,040
you'll,
they'll see something really good like 

517
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,240
that guy and then I guarantee you that I
take that back.

518
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,610
There is a fucking show.
It's called Hoggin.

519
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,580
There is a fucking show.
I just heard about this.

520
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,680
There was a show called hog and it's all
about a feral hogs and I could tell you 

521
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,250
in two seconds because the production 
company that I was at birth,

522
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,940
the conquerors does birth,
conquer,

523
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,380
produces hoggin.
Well,

524
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:36,620
we don't realize

525
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,190
is out here in the city.
We don't realize out here with the white

526
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:45,191
man what the,
what the real fucking problem is with 

527
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:45,820
the white man.
Was that a real.

528
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,150
What I mean with the,
uh,

529
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:49,170
the urban man as I should have said,

530
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,990
city,
city,

531
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,160
urban,
using the correct term.

532
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,420
The person living in a city,
urban,

533
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,780
white,
urban,

534
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,480
urbanized is white people.
Fuck organs.

535
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,050
Our special is so fucking good.
Okay,

536
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:07,810
let's start.
Sorry,

537
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,250
you threw me completely off track.
Let's talk about urbanites.

538
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,120
Excellent.
Um,

539
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,480
what was I saying?
Well,

540
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,300
we don't understand.

541
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,940
Oh,
that how big of a fucking problem.

542
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,750
Wild hogs are wild hogs to people that 
live in rural areas.

543
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,610
There are fucking huge problem,
man,

544
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:23,980
because there's not a lot of people 
chasing after him.

545
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,830
So they're constantly breeding and 
they're smart as fuck.

546
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:30,760
And they hide from people and they 
destroy entire farms.

547
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,880
They just fuck up crops.
They just come in and there's not shit 

548
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,910
you can do about them,
so you can hunt them all year round.

549
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,920
There's no bag limit on them because at 
this point they are literally an 

550
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,630
infestation like we're lucky we don't 
live there.

551
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,660
Could you imagine if you went outside 
and you're fucking backyard and there's 

552
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:48,820
wild pigs,
big ones.

553
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,970
Fucking tusks.
Hundreds of pounds took out the king on 

554
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:54,690
game of thrones.
Was a fucking pig sending.

555
00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:59,691
Well Watch the game was going to hog 
hunting and they got them to drunk in 

556
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:00,520
the hall.
Gordon and Toro to stomach.

557
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,130
So he died.
Yeah.

558
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,880
Those fucking things are obese.
I had a friend,

559
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:05,020
James App,
Thorpe,

560
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,320
who used to hunt them and I don't know 
why you can't just shoot them with a 

561
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,560
bone arrow or something and get close to
them.

562
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,650
Oh really?
The dogs find them down.

563
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:14,770
The

564
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,870
dog's grabbed them and bite them and 
hold them down.

565
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:19,330
My,
my pit that I to have frank,

566
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,290
he was a hog hunting dog from Hawaii.
He was so crazy.

567
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,180
Craziest dog I've ever had.
Really?

568
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,790
And yeah,
he was a great dog with people,

569
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:31,710
but he was so animal aggressive,
like a never seen anything like this and

570
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,760
killed two of my cats.
He just,

571
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,250
he was always like,
cats would fuck with him.

572
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,570
He'd be fine with them and then they 
would piss in the corner or something.

573
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,480
He would just decide,
all right,

574
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:41,950
I'm going to kill one of your fucking 
cats.

575
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,960
It would just go kill one.
It was,

576
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,090
it was no joke.
My.

577
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:45,820
He would only do it.

578
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,520
I don't mean to be laughing,
but it's just.

579
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,150
He would only do it when I wasn't 
around.

580
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,180
That's the crazy thing in front of Eddie
Bravo and once in front of my wife.

581
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:00,610
That's what burt,
you keep on saying you went to this 

582
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:00,610
crazy dog that's.
You don't want those dogs,

583
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:00,610
Bro.
Trust me.

584
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,410
You might want to talk to him and just 
get a nice dog wars in my house.

585
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:05,590
I've had dogs killed dogs,
but you don't.

586
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,740
Yeah.
You don't know what that's like.

587
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,620
Do you come home and one of your female 
pitts has killed the other female pit or

588
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,510
killed her dead in your living room?
And I got to clean up the blood.

589
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,590
Yeah,
dude,

590
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,600
he's not a joke.
The those animals or they look cool 

591
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,890
because you and I are both 15 year old 
boys at heart,

592
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,180
so like fucking look at that fucking 
animal on that.

593
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,120
Dude,
I want to have that.

594
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,140
They're very dangerous and people get on
me all the time because I say this shit.

595
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,870
I see this as a guy owned pits for 10 
years.

596
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,200
I still love pits.
I think they're amazing dogs.

597
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,410
They're so fucking intelligent because 
the cruel nature of dog fighting.

598
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,820
Because the way it's set up,
they only allowed the purest of the 

599
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,200
bloodline to survive.
They kill off the ones that quit to kill

600
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:53,201
off the ones that don't want to fight to
kill off the ones that don't show 

601
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,040
absolute courage and no human 
aggression.

602
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,290
They're not supposed to ever be 
aggressive to humans.

603
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,560
The only attack dogs.
And that's way that way men can get in 

604
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:02,840
there and separate the dogs as they're 
fighting.

605
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,020
So what you develop is this super loyal,
loving wants to please you has this 

606
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:13,970
incredible drive like no other dog.
The driver pitbulls insane.

607
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,480
They will jump up and hold onto a tire 
with their jaw for an hour.

608
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:22,690
Just hang there.
Their drive is so different than any 

609
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:22,800
other dog,
and until you've appreciated that you,

610
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:23,780
you really,
you don't.

611
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,540
You don't know why people love those 
dogs so much,

612
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,400
but they're dangerous fact.
They're dangerous with dogs.

613
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,580
They're dangerous with little people.
They're dangerous with old people.

614
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,670
My dog did not like old people,
so one of my biggest fears was that old 

615
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,330
people would come by my fence and he'd 
go,

616
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,430
it wasn't like,
you know,

617
00:25:43,431 --> 00:25:48,431
hey,
better back the fuck away from the 

618
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:48,431
fence.
It's like,

619
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:48,431
I've got this.
I got this.

620
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:52,120
It was like his prey drive sense that 
this person was no longer a person 

621
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,021
anymore.
There was so weak and so old that his 

622
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:58,430
killer instinct,
like that's what you go after.

623
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:03,320
That's what a killer animal goes after.
They see a weakness like hyenas.

624
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,440
You can raise hyenas as a pet,
but if you show any signs of weakness,

625
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:13,630
like if you limp in front of a Hyena,
you better hope that fucking has got a 

626
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,520
muzzle on or you better hope that things
got a muzzle on because it won't be able

627
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:18,680
to protect it.
We're one people to help itself.

628
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,340
It won't be able to help itself even 
though you've raised it your whole life.

629
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,400
If a hygienist sees you limping the lock
on you with those fucking crazy eyes and

630
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:34,571
the strongest snapping jaws known to 
mankind in the mammal world at least,

631
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,490
and they just take a big chunk out of 
your asshole.

632
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,840
That's your pet hyena that you want to 
do.

633
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:43,880
You want this cooler,
cool.

634
00:26:43,881 --> 00:26:44,360
200

635
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,360
pound beast,
but you fucked up and went and played 

636
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,450
tennis and you gotTa Limp and you came 
home with me and it just eats you.

637
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,430
It would be so.
You need that.

638
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,220
Start watching dogs.
One one to really know about animals.

639
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,910
I've been researching dogs for the 
better part of every single weekend.

640
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,140
I'm on the road.
All I do,

641
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,220
my pal Bryan County,
and I talk about this all the time 

642
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,501
because we've all,
we've had pit bulls or whole life and 

643
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:11,631
I've called Brian in the middle of dog 
fights and his dogs fighting one of his 

644
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:11,631
dogs.
It's just his,

645
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,680
his,
his ex girlfriend's dog was this amazing

646
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:18,681
dog,
was also this crazy pit bull that was 

647
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:18,681
constantly getting in fights.
They get in fights,

648
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:18,681
man.
Period.

649
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:23,601
I don't give a fuck what anybody says.
It's very hard to stop that shit and 

650
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:24,090
it's not just the bureau,
it's not just the boys,

651
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:26,840
the girls,
the girl dogs are hyper aggressive.

652
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,330
There

653
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:32,830
were your parents.
Were your parents like you buy them as 

654
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:32,830
puppies?

655
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:32,830
Two of them,
what will.

656
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:37,171
One of them is a puppy and two of them I
rescued two of them you rescue and they 

657
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:37,870
were both very different,
but both very fucked up.

658
00:27:37,871 --> 00:27:42,871
One of them was a full,
full grown two year old female and she 

659
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:43,780
had mange all over her body and I saw 
her.

660
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,840
I found her friend.
A friend found her and then I came to 

661
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:48,840
he.
They called me and said,

662
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,020
we found this dog,
you know,

663
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,500
are you still interested in adopting a 
dog?

664
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:55,501
And I saw her and she was just.
She had the sweetness eyes and covered 

665
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:56,020
in mange and I was like,
oh my God,

666
00:27:56,021 --> 00:27:58,060
I have to save this dog.
It was just like,

667
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,590
this dog was like,
I don't know what to do.

668
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:01,330
Hey,
I'm just a nice dog.

669
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:03,700
I'm a sweetheart.
And she was the sweetest dog.

670
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,750
She was.
So.

671
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Except if she thought you were trying to
take too much attention from me or 

672
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,720
accept.
Really?

673
00:28:10,721 --> 00:28:11,140
Yeah,
yeah,

674
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:16,141
yeah.
Any dog she would fucking snap them and 

675
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:16,141
bite them in the face and fucking 
grabbed.

676
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:16,420
It was a weird thing,
man.

677
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,950
They have this incredible desire for 
human attention and approval.

678
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,650
All right.
Then we'll just get a friendly dog.

679
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:25,580
Man.
I want.

680
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,290
Here's what I want.
I want the other.

681
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:32,291
I was telling you guys,
this is when we walked in for the 

682
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:34,721
morning or the night.
My doorbell rang in the middle of the 

683
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:34,721
night.
I'm home.

684
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:35,150
The one night I'm home in the,
in the week the doorbell rings.

685
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:40,390
Both girls are in bed with me and lands 
in the girls room and I start panicking 

686
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:43,340
thinking this is how it goes down.
That ring the doorbell.

687
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,200
You go to the door,
you turn off the alarm,

688
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:46,880
you opened the door.
That's what a soccer would do.

689
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,970
Not Me because I'm fucking.
Because I'm already five steps ahead of 

690
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:51,970
them.
So I take the girls in the,

691
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,470
in the bedroom with Leanne,
I go everyone out the fucking window.

692
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,170
I'm going to stop whatever is happening,
but you guys out the window out the back

693
00:28:57,171 --> 00:29:02,171
door,
go to the corner of Laurel Canyon and 

694
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:02,171
uh,

695
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:02,171
this is before even go to the door 
before

696
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:04,600
I go to the fucking door because I'm 
like four in the morning.

697
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,010
Get a gun,
a doorbell for we,

698
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,000
we haven't gotten.
We haven't gotten the doorbell.

699
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,850
Four in the morning.
What the fuck?

700
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,570
There's no,
no good is coming out of that.

701
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,310
There's nothing good.
No one's like,

702
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,000
hey,
I broke down.

703
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,400
We live in a fucking busy intersection 
like we're a block away.

704
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,860
So I just fuck in.
I start panicking.

705
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,620
Leanne,
as I'm in talking to Leanne,

706
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,080
I hear the doorbell go again and I'm 
like,

707
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,280
uh,
now I'm like,

708
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,340
you will you ever get like,
where your asshole just goes wide,

709
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,750
like wide open like hall,
and you're like,

710
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:30,530
oh fuck.
And I go,

711
00:29:30,531 --> 00:29:31,360
do you hear it?
And she goes,

712
00:29:31,361 --> 00:29:33,970
it's the girls music,
the girls music's playing.

713
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:37,750
That's not the doorbell is the music.
So I'm like,

714
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:39,400
okay.
So it wasn't the fucking doorbell,

715
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,450
but then I thought to myself,

716
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,580
so I'm not crazy.
So then I'm like,

717
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:52,110
fuck it.
I want a beast in my house that is 

718
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,000
willing to give its life for my family.
I want somebody that is going to.

719
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:57,010
I got an alarm system and I got a gun.
No,

720
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,310
no,
no.

721
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,660
That's a good idea to have a dog.
I just don't recommend pitbulls.

722
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,240
I don't need to impress a canary in 
recommending those,

723
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,460
those,
those dogs that,

724
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:08,120
those are the dogs that uh,
that actor killed a man who,

725
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,770
who's the guy who was in pulp fiction?
The black dude with a shaved head.

726
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,660
What the fuck's his name?
Names.

727
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,690
Yeah,
thing.

728
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,910
Graham's had a let's find.
Let's find the article so we know.

729
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,800
Yeah,
my dogs the best guard dog.

730
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:25,801
So if he starts barking,
that means there's somebody around my 

731
00:30:25,801 --> 00:30:26,160
house and it's all in its brief because 
there's a Pekinese.

732
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,160
It was a,
uh,

733
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,560
that's what it was bred for as an alarm 
system dog.

734
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,930
Yeah.
Is this going to alarm dogs?

735
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:35,931
Kill worker at ving?
Rhames home or a 40 year old man was 

736
00:30:35,931 --> 00:30:40,431
mauled to death by as many as four dogs 
at the home of ving rhames before,

737
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,370
before Joe's dogs went crazy and went 
crazy.

738
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,800
He used to have me babysit his dogs when
he was out of town,

739
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:49,380
so I'd bring my girlfriend at the time 
and we'd go there to feed the dog.

740
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:52,440
And one time she's like feeding the dog 
and the dog like bitter in the hand.

741
00:30:52,441 --> 00:30:55,290
But it was kind of like a,
was that a playful bite or fight?

742
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:00,530
But I was so scared.
Every time I would go to his house 

743
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,381
because of that,
you can tell some dogs you just can't 

744
00:31:03,381 --> 00:31:04,500
trust.
That's why I'm surprised that little guy

745
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:09,530
in that TV show pit boss.
I'm surprised I didn't even alive shop 

746
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,530
was hanging out with lions.
Yeah,

747
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,590
I mean there's dogs are the size of him.
Yeah,

748
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,310
and he's like,
no,

749
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:16,230
they're just good.
They can take an Rv.

750
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,620
He rescued a dog that was all fucked up 
and beat up from dogfights the other day

751
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:24,621
in an alley and it was just him and his 
dog that had open wounds that just got 

752
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:24,621
done with a fucking.

753
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:25,900
They've staged that show.
There's so much stage.

754
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,920
At one time they were like,
they were like good that he showed up 

755
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,320
and there was a pit bull in a dumpster 
and I was like,

756
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,780
you know that some pa was like,
how close are they?

757
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,020
Why don't you have to put a pebble in 
the dumpster?

758
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:40,660
Shows.
Definitely fake like 90 percent of that 

759
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,000
90 percent of all those fucking show.
I can't even sit through half of them 

760
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,000
anymore.
When you watch the setup,

761
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:49,270
like you're like,
well like hulk Hogan walks in and he's 

762
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:49,270
like,
well my agent just called,

763
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,030
looks like we're going into the Bermuda 
this weekend.

764
00:31:50,031 --> 00:31:51,840
And they're like,
but I have these friends.

765
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,430
I'm like,
fucking seriously.

766
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,760
I watched,
I watched the,

767
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:57,810
uh,
the new.

768
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,840
What's uh,
what's the girl had the new Paris Hilton

769
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:03,270
one on its own.
Yeah.

770
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,660
What's owns that?
Oprah's Oprah's network.

771
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,960
Has a Paris Hilton Shell for real.
Paris Hilton's got to say that to him.

772
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,450
Paris whole gun.
Show this to me.

773
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,340
You're going to be doing.
Whereas hold on,

774
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:18,341
let's finish this job.
I show and then leave the newsletter 

775
00:32:18,341 --> 00:32:20,690
this month she'll gets.
Oh,

776
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,770
Paris Hilton.
Huge Joe.

777
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,420
Oprah Winfrey Fan.
Sorry.

778
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,280
Show from combining them.
People think I'm not really Oprah 

779
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,190
Winfrey,
Oprah Winfrey.

780
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,820
I think that if I was an old woman who 
didn't get any deck,

781
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:39,850
I think she was God show Oprah.
If I was a 40 year old women,

782
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,800
slightly overweight trying to find,
you know,

783
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,770
sense in my life and religion that 
didn't work out for me.

784
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:47,600
But I just,
Oprah speaks to means,

785
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:49,640
you know,
I think she's doing the right thing.

786
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,550
Paris blames oxygen for new shows.

787
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,670
Oh,
it's a good show.

788
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,400
It was not a good show,
but it's like so staged,

789
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,750
like so stage

790
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:03,950
blaming.
She Paris is furious that the show 

791
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,681
didn't premier at the time.
It was supposed to listen to this,

792
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,140
she worked her tail off doing promotion 
and publicity for the show and then 

793
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:16,590
because of a technical mistake that show
aired in a completely different time and

794
00:33:16,591 --> 00:33:17,880
a lot of markets,

795
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,960
uh,
every fucking TV show on cable,

796
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,920
she's getting pissy because.

797
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:29,010
Because the way to network the cable 
networks work is you premier on the East

798
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,320
Coast at 8:00.
Well then that means on the west coast,

799
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:34,870
your premieres at 5:00
and then your,

800
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,820
is that like 6:00?
It doesn't work.

801
00:33:36,821 --> 00:33:41,821
Normal.
All the ratings were fucked up for all 

802
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:41,821
those networks because the way cable 
setup,

803
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:43,570
she's just stupid because you do,
she never paid attention to it.

804
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:48,670
Now stupid.
When did they start dividing shows up 

805
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:48,670
where they would show like,
you know,

806
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,230
lost at 6:00
PM on the east coast,

807
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:52,130
but 9:00
PM,

808
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,810
you know what I mean?
Like when did,

809
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:55,610
when did they do that?
Did they use to do it?

810
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:56,960
Like where,
you know,

811
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:57,980
they,
they,

812
00:33:57,981 --> 00:34:00,530
the whole country aired cbs at the same 
time.

813
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:03,290
So people had to watch lost at six PM 
and La,

814
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,020
is that right?

815
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,390
No,
no,

816
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:04,740
no,
no.

817
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,870
If you have direct tv then then you will
be able to see the premiere at 5:00.

818
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,280
Of course,
of course,

819
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:13,160
but what I'm saying is when did they 
start switching it up?

820
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,490
When did they start having to 
broadcasts?

821
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,520
I think they did that for awhile.
Yeah.

822
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,670
Did they always have to feel that they 
had an east coast and the west coast?

823
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,800
I think so because after awhile they'd 
probably,

824
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,640
they probably figured out like when do 
people want to watch TV?

825
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,100
They get home from work at five ish,
six,

826
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,940
eight,
seven ish.

827
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,970
Eight ish is good.
Eight to 10 inches good and then we're 

828
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:37,120
tired and we got to go to bed or you're 
a Weirdo and you hate your life and your

829
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:39,030
staff and you watch late night.
I don't think they know

830
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,190
at all what they're doing.
Anyone who's programming television,

831
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:47,270
it has to be demand.
They need to switch it to no way to 

832
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,161
figure out what do you like?
Do you really think anyone saw jersey 

833
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:52,240
shore are going to be a hit now?
There's

834
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,040
like people that know,
look,

835
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:53,840
look,
we just.

836
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,530
UFC just signed a deal at Fox and we 
had,

837
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,820
I had a fucking suit,
like a retard.

838
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:01,730
I look like such a monkey's Fox or Fx,
Fox,

839
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:06,731
fx and fuel.
So a Fox TV is gonna have the big 

840
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:07,610
fights.
Fx is going to have the ultimate fighter

841
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:10,540
and a bunch of fight nights and fuel's 
going to have some programming on,

842
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,400
on as well.
And a no brainer,

843
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,530
but it's sorta been good.
Those guys,

844
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:20,150
no fucking sports like when you see like
all the mines comparing notes and trying

845
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,100
to figure out the best way to market 
things and push things.

846
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:27,101
Like there's a level of like they're,
these guys know how to push shows.

847
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:29,330
They know how to promote shows,
you know,

848
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:31,400
how to make things happen.
But you're right,

849
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:36,401
there's a lot of people that are doing 
that don't know what the fuck they're 

850
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:37,830
doing,
especially executives when it comes to,

851
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:42,831
in my opinion,
creative issues where it comes to like 

852
00:35:42,831 --> 00:35:46,550
see like comedies and things along those
lines when you have editors or you have 

853
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:47,150
rather,
um,

854
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,440
executives that are interjecting their 
ideas.

855
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,560
It almost is never good for the funny.
Almost never,

856
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,160
so they fucked that up,
but it's for sports.

857
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,050
I think they know exactly what the fuck 
they're doing.

858
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,200
You know what I mean?
It's like they can affect the outcome.

859
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,830
You know what I'm saying?

860
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:06,930
Course you're not going to you.
There's no way for an executive to 

861
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:07,400
throws to sense into an MMA fight.

862
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,210
They can't help themselves.
Man.

863
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:14,211
Their ego is so fucking strong ego that 
gets you to the position to be a high 

864
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:15,030
level executive.
Your Ego,

865
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,190
your shelf fucking right.
You're so.

866
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:18,390
No,
you're fucking right.

867
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:23,391
You know you're right.
And so it's so hard for them to like 

868
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:26,540
just let you make a show because until 
that show is south park where they just 

869
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,960
leave it alone because it's a monster 
and comedy central.

870
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:33,961
A guarantee.
They south park probably doesn't even 

871
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:33,961
lead comedy central.
Call them

872
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:33,961
probably.
You don't have my number.

873
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:35,360
You don't get my numbers stupid.
Yeah.

874
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:39,410
It's quite like you don't get my number 
dummy just on Tuesday.

875
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,920
I'm going to send a package to you and 
it will have the new episode and we'll 

876
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,680
do this every week.
That's Louis ck show show.

877
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,940
His deal is earned as a speculation.
It's just,

878
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:56,100
it's like the rumor mill,
but that he doesn't make a ton of money 

879
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,120
but they aren't allowed to touch his 
show.

880
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,990
That's amazing.
And everyone needed for sure.

881
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
He has to pass it by them.
No,

882
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,190
I know.
He throws it back.

883
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,800
Things that they have,
they've seen him do.

884
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:09,801
They've accepted that.
He didn't think they were going to 

885
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:09,801
accept.
Oh really?

886
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:12,310
Yeah.
He did an article where he's talking 

887
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:12,310
about.
It was like,

888
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:12,310
really?
We can do this.

889
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:12,310
We can get away with this.

890
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,560
That's the.
It's the fucking ultimate.

891
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:18,620
I love x now.
That's one of my favorite channels 

892
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:18,620
because they have a lot of good shows 
now.

893
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,760
They have the Philadelphia show.
They have there that Louis show and last

894
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:23,280
night I was watching the Louis show and 
deduct Stan hope episode.

895
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:28,281
Awesome episode,
but I was also watching him talk about 

896
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:28,281
masturbation.
He was using the word calm.

897
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:32,420
He was talking in great detail,
but she likes to masturbate and stuff 

898
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:32,420
and they're like,
this is awesome.

899
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,290
Fx letting him say I love when people 
talk about.

900
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,970
There was no sensory.
No,

901
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:43,010
there was there,
it was great seeing cable now embracing 

902
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:43,010
that like,
hey,

903
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:43,210
we're just not going to touch these 
show.

904
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:43,560
Well,
you know,

905
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,990
it doesn't have to.
The FCC doesn't regulate them.

906
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,340
We don't

907
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,850
realize that.
Most people don't realize that.

908
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:52,380
You see hpo you think that the reason 
why hbo has swears is because Hbo the.

909
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:53,220
Oh,
you pay for it,

910
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:54,020
so it's okay.
Yeah.

911
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,810
But no,
it's okay.

912
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:56,040
Through all of cable.
Yeah.

913
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,940
They're just losing their belts though.
These channels are loosening their belts

914
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:03,970
and seat.
The realizing because the Internet that 

915
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,950
people have different sensibilities.
It's just the same people that are 

916
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,020
listening to this podcast are also 
watching blank on TV.

917
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:09,360
They're also watching football.
They're also watching baseball.

918
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,720
You know,
I think people are realizing now that 

919
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,420
people's sensibilities are a lot 
broader.

920
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,230
It's the advertisers is who's taking it 
away from him.

921
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,630
Like I think,
I think our,

922
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,580
I don't want to fucking to show,
but I think I heard a

923
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,810
um,
uh,

924
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,960
the league

925
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,890
fucking rent as easy as easy saying 
they're gonna do whatever the fuck they 

926
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,861
want.
It's just how much are you willing to 

927
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:35,861
lose from advertisers for gain,
you know,

928
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:36,730
it's,
have to find the right advertisers,

929
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,760
you know,
I mean like the UFC had a hard time 

930
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,161
finding the proper advertises for while,
but then they got bud light and then 

931
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:45,700
they get Harley Davidson and you know,
it's now it becomes,

932
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,320
you know,
it becomes something that's easy to,

933
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:49,870
to,
to,

934
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,920
to connect with,
you know,

935
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:55,921
it's successful.
It's one something is not successful 

936
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:55,921
yet.
That's when it gets weird.

937
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:57,370
Like South Park thing.
Dude,

938
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,620
think of some of these shit they've done
on south park.

939
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:04,860
Think of when they had the whore off,
would that gay guy and Paris Hilton and 

940
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,220
he shoved pair of silver in his asshole.
You never that never seen south to sound

941
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,160
park.
It's never seen.

942
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:14,161
South South Park is,
it is an American gem.

943
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,240
It's,
what's the word I'm looking for?

944
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:22,320
It's a treasure.
It's a cultural treasure that shows a 

945
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,190
cultural treasure.
I don't watch it as much as I should,

946
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,540
but it's fucking

947
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:28,780
brilliant of art.
I only know.

948
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:32,080
I can only speak from American Justice 
League or team team America,

949
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,030
whatever it was fucking made me laugh.
My team,

950
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,810
America world police,
the funniest fucking thing of all time.

951
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,750
One of the funniest movies of all time.
It's exactly what South Park is.

952
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:41,800
Yeah,
but I never got into.

953
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:42,250
I never got it

954
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,390
did genius.
It's genius.

955
00:39:44,391 --> 00:39:49,040
It's the best comedy as far as that kind
of like silly animation type shit that's

956
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,900
ever been created ever.
In my opinion.

957
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,310
I don't think anybody can fuck with 
them.

958
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,740
I mean the simpsons obviously are 
brilliant and there's a lot of formulas,

959
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,740
but there's still have the simpsons.

960
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,420
I can't watch family guy either.
Oh,

961
00:40:00,421 --> 00:40:01,770
I love that.
I live alone.

962
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,340
If you opened me up,
it's bleeds playing the guy.

963
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:07,830
It bothers me that South Park likes this
shit on family guy so much.

964
00:40:07,831 --> 00:40:10,080
Sometimes it hurts my feelings and I 
like family guy.

965
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,420
Family guy is stupid.
I agree.

966
00:40:12,421 --> 00:40:14,460
It's not as good as South Park.
It's different,

967
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:19,050
but it's very short attention span.
I could just sit there and just be taken

968
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:21,320
away on this little silly journey.
You know?

969
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,500
It's a good show,
man.

970
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,640
Family guy is a good show.

971
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:26,450
I don't know.
I haven't seen American dad either.

972
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:30,740
I want what I like is that moment when 
you realize the brilliance,

973
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,530
like the first time you were watching 
family guy,

974
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,820
I was like,
what's this?

975
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,840
And then the joke hit and you're like,
oh fuck,

976
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,840
that's.
So I remember when someone was,

977
00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:46,841
uh,
I think that thing was someone was 

978
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:47,690
choking in the front yard and Peter ran 
out and,

979
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,230
and Brian and the dogs sitting there and
Peter runs out and he goes,

980
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,480
don't worry,
I know how to do this.

981
00:40:53,481 --> 00:40:56,090
I can do the Heimlich maneuver.
I read it in a book.

982
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,660
And Brian Goes,
Peter,

983
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,020
you sure you read it in a book,
are you sure?

984
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,020
Just wasn't nothing.

985
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,350
And I heard that and I just started 
laughing so fucking hard.

986
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,640
And this wasn't nothing,
nothing.

987
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,960
That's such a weird bug in live.

988
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:17,100
So I tried to get Leanne to my wife to 
watch family guy and she,

989
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,530
she'd sit there and watch it with me and
just didn't get it.

990
00:41:19,531 --> 00:41:22,590
And then the one time where Peter fell 
and skinned his knee

991
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:29,950
for like five minutes anyway.
And then all of a sudden my wife just 

992
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:29,950
starts laughing hysterically and she 
goes,

993
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,560
looks at me.
She's like,

994
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,480
how long is he going to do that for it?
I was like,

995
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,020
that's a funny joke.
That's what he's

996
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:39,030
done is brilliant.
I love those moments where you fucking 

997
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,030
get it.
You know,

998
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,871
like the,
we're just clicks in your head and you 

999
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:43,871
go,
oh,

1000
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:44,420
that's funny shit.
Like I want those all the time.

1001
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:44,860
Yeah.

1002
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,530
Mcfarland's a cool dude too,
man.

1003
00:41:46,531 --> 00:41:48,100
I met him.
I did a voice on a.

1004
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:52,460
I Guess I did myself on,
on wasn't buried meet.

1005
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,510
No,
they parodied me on American Dad,

1006
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,170
but on family guy came in and actually 
did the voice and he was so nice.

1007
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:00,360
He was so cool.
What's it like to be buried?

1008
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,560
Parodied?
It was weird.

1009
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,850
Well,
it didn't sound anything like me.

1010
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,880
It was like I pulled up in a car and I 
was drinking and I was like talking 

1011
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,650
about strippers or something,
which I guess is how they thought of me,

1012
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:16,010
which is kind of funny.
What if he had really hit home and it 

1013
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,341
really touched.
What if it was me last night it was 

1014
00:42:18,341 --> 00:42:22,431
drinking.
I was looking for strippers and my 

1015
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:23,250
accent did sound anything like me 
either.

1016
00:42:23,251 --> 00:42:24,840
It's just,
it's just a bad accident.

1017
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,680
I would love it if no one's ever been 
able to do an impression of me.

1018
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:33,950
You know,
there's certain guys that you can 

1019
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:33,950
imitate their voice,
like,

1020
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:34,140
like anyone can do an arnold 
schwartzenegger

1021
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,720
pressure.
I wish I could do impressions right now.

1022
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:37,430
I totally.
Let's try to do it joe real quick.

1023
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,720
You can't do it.
I always.

1024
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,240
Jeffrey.

1025
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,300
Jeff Richardson was convinced that he 
could.

1026
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,270
Jeff Bridges was convinced that he could
do it for a while.

1027
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,990
He was good at.
He's good at it.

1028
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,430
Yes.
He couldn't do me though.

1029
00:42:48,431 --> 00:42:50,350
He didn't have it.
I'm sure someone out there could,

1030
00:42:50,351 --> 00:42:51,790
but he couldn't.
Yeah.

1031
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,460
Morris a and maybe not.
No.

1032
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,880
Joe's.
Joe's got a 50 year old woman in like,

1033
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,820
hey.
Yeah.

1034
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,630
Hi here.
Checked out.

1035
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,620
Take time to tell you about all fucking 
Duncan trussell's.

1036
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:14,200
Can we just take a second?
Okay.

1037
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,570
Appreciate Duncan King.
Obsessed with him.

1038
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,490
He.
I could listen.

1039
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:23,720
I listened to him on this and they're 
not assessed with him the way he talks.

1040
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:24,620
I want to talk.

1041
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:28,200
He's a.
he's one of my favorite human beings.

1042
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,160
He's a fascinating guy.
I listen to this audio.

1043
00:43:32,161 --> 00:43:36,240
I'm Ron Bennington's interviewing Penn 
Jillette and it was so good.

1044
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:41,241
It was such a good interview that I had 
an email pen right afterwards and just 

1045
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:41,241
tell him.
I'm like,

1046
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:41,241
dude,
you like,

1047
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:45,780
he is such an interesting guy and he was
talking about so many cool things.

1048
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:51,090
It was really a fun interview man,
but one of the things that he said was 

1049
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,790
that the person who's in the room,
when you come up with something,

1050
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:58,791
the person who's in the room when you're
bouncing an idea around the person 

1051
00:43:58,791 --> 00:43:59,280
you're bouncing with has an effect on 
that idea.

1052
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,520
The person you're in,
the conversation where it's like if 

1053
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,290
you'd come up with the most brilliant 
idea and his thing was that the people 

1054
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,010
that are like say if you came up with an
idea for something,

1055
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:11,250
the people that were in the room with 
you should claim half of that,

1056
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:16,310
that that project.
Totally because you would not have come 

1057
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:19,431
up with that project,
you weren't in their presence and I'm 

1058
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:19,431
like,
that is so true.

1059
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:20,340
And Duncan trussell's the perfect 
example for that,

1060
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,640
both with him and with me because Duncan
has always said that like he never goes 

1061
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:28,740
as deep into the rabbit hole as he does 
when he's on this show

1062
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:32,910
is lavender lavender hour is nothing.
This show it's nothing.

1063
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:33,900
It's.
It is.

1064
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,540
It's a lot.
It's a lot lighter.

1065
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,850
But man,
when he's talking to you,

1066
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,720
you guys go into some deep shit where I 
am.

1067
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,230
Sometimes they'll give me panic attacks.

1068
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:48,850
He's given me some very interesting 
insight on the possibilities,

1069
00:44:48,951 --> 00:44:49,880
you know,
and a lot of people say,

1070
00:44:49,881 --> 00:44:52,940
well it's just fucking stupid hippie.
What if,

1071
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:54,270
what if talk,
you know,

1072
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,540
and that is a lot of it,
but there are,

1073
00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:00,380
I'm not sure what this is and I don't 
think you are either.

1074
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:05,440
I think you can pretend that you're sure
because it makes you feel better at 

1075
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,760
night and you can,
you can pretend that everything that you

1076
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:12,761
can't,
you can't hit with a hammer isn't real 

1077
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:13,590
and it's just your imagination.
It's just what?

1078
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,590
What the fuck is consciousness,
man?

1079
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:17,720
What is this?
What is life?

1080
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,580
What is this idea that,
oh,

1081
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:24,581
I'm going to call Bert Kreischer and 
asked him to come over to my house and 

1082
00:45:24,581 --> 00:45:28,541
burt somehow or another navigates his 
way through space and time and arrives 

1083
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:32,501
at my doorstep and us friends get to 
communicate and we're talking into some 

1084
00:45:32,501 --> 00:45:37,391
fucking thing that takes all of our 
voice and all the shit that we say and 

1085
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:42,641
throws it through some Internet and 
breaks it down to ones and Zeros where 

1086
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:45,380
it's then interpreted by other people's 
computers in real time.

1087
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,760
What the fuck is this?
Don't tell me you know what this is.

1088
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,510
This is the bizarreness.
If life wasn't real,

1089
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,420
it would be the craziest psychedelic 
trip ever.

1090
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:00,860
It's almost like when a real psychedelic
trip is something you're not used to,

1091
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,050
something you're not just throws you 
off,

1092
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:08,560
but life itself isn't the most uber 
bizarre thing ever.

1093
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,420
It would seem more plausible to say you 
would have many lives in different 

1094
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,071
parallels and you could travel through 
time then to say to someone that we 

1095
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:21,060
could talk to you from this room into a 
cave like that.

1096
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:24,840
You can send more voices,
like if you'd said pitched everything to

1097
00:46:24,841 --> 00:46:27,210
the cave men and you're like,
what's going to be more plausible?

1098
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:32,660
Three guys can then talk and it'll just 
travel around the country and everyone 

1099
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,390
can hear them talk or you just have 
another life.

1100
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:33,780
They'll be like,
oh,

1101
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:34,750
fuck another life.
Definitely,

1102
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,780
definitely one of another life.
I'm definitely.

1103
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,080
I'm deaf.
I completely believe in time travel.

1104
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,170
Well,
you know,

1105
00:46:41,171 --> 00:46:46,171
they've actually shown like recently the
most recent studies say that the speed 

1106
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:48,730
of light cannot be bypassed,
can't,

1107
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,630
can't surpass the speed of light.
So they believe that time travel will be

1108
00:46:52,631 --> 00:46:55,120
in fact impossible.
But that's just

1109
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,860
bullshit.
Fuck your dog.

1110
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,440
What else do you want to buy?
A dog knows whether or not they're 

1111
00:47:13,101 --> 00:47:18,060
correct.
We won't find out for a long time.

1112
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:23,070
Bird crusher.
Hopefully you and I will be alive 

1113
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:25,781
though.
Hopefully if we take our vitamins and 

1114
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:25,781
eat.
While I want to do those brain pills,

1115
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:26,840
some guy,
I'll give you a bottom.

1116
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:28,010
Some guy that's amazing.
Yeah.

1117
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:28,680
People,
look,

1118
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,070
people think it's nuts,

1119
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:35,070
but I can tell you 100 percent that 
vitamins have enhanced my,

1120
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,530
my,
my feeling,

1121
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,560
the way I,
the way my body feels and enhance my 

1122
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,200
energy.
I believe they give me a call.

1123
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,770
My body feels clear.
It feels like it's less needy.

1124
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:52,950
It feels like it's more filled.
When when your body is filled with 

1125
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,370
nutrients and you're eating healthy,
it works better.

1126
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:59,460
I really truly believe that.
We know that people died of scurvy 

1127
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,310
because they didn't get enough vitamin 
C,

1128
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:05,311
we know that essential nutrients are 
very important part of keeping the body 

1129
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:10,141
vibrant and healthy and when I eat well 
and I've been eating really healthy 

1130
00:48:10,141 --> 00:48:14,311
lately,
I've been drinking this vitamix thing 

1131
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:15,490
every morning and drinking these blended
Kale milkshakes and not milkshakes.

1132
00:48:15,491 --> 00:48:17,900
It's just,
it's just blended Kale and cucumbers and

1133
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:22,910
smoothies.
Smoothies and I feel really good and 

1134
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,310
because I'm giving my body all this 
healthy stuff,

1135
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,020
it feels like it works better.

1136
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,200
When I take these Alpha brain pills,
what they are is nutrients that are 

1137
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,300
supposed to enhance cerebral function.
Now,

1138
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:36,040
is that a fact?
Man?

1139
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,930
I don't.
I don't fucking know and shit.

1140
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,980
I can't tell you exactly what mean.
Cognitive function is a very hard thing 

1141
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,230
to to.
Unless you're testing someone,

1142
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,190
you know,
what are you going to do?

1143
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,070
You're going to make them perform tasks 
and then they're going to give him these

1144
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:49,930
pills and see if they can perform the 
tasks.

1145
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:54,040
I guess it'd be you got to factor in all
sorts of other things into account.

1146
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:55,870
How do I know that this guy isn't 
stressed out?

1147
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:58,060
How do I know that he's not tired?
How do I know that?

1148
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,190
I'll take it for a month and I'll test,
but you know what I'm saying.

1149
00:49:00,191 --> 00:49:02,170
I'm doing tests.
It's like you,

1150
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:02,660
you.
That's.

1151
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,750
There's other variables in this person's
life,

1152
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:09,840
so you'd have to do a lot of tests,
but the idea behind them is very sound 

1153
00:49:10,061 --> 00:49:15,061
and that idea is that nutrients can 
enhance cognitive function and I think 

1154
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:19,441
they can and I think that these pills do
and I know for a fact that I am feeling 

1155
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:21,070
good during the day.

1156
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:26,070
I feel like I have even energy and I'm 
having dreams man my dreams or a stray 

1157
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:32,200
psycho with my grandparents yesterday it
felt like it was real shit.

1158
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,450
Do you realize their dreams in the 
middle of them?

1159
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,810
No,
because I'm doing that all the time,

1160
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,840
but the detail was amazing.
Like I,

1161
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:45,040
I was remembering this old photo of my 
grandfather I saw a long time ago and he

1162
00:49:45,131 --> 00:49:47,320
had the exact same suit on the St Pants 
on.

1163
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,720
I saw this photo once at my mom's house,
but my mom,

1164
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,700
I was telling my mom about it.
She sent me the photo.

1165
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:54,160
I'm like,
that's exactly what I saw my grandfather

1166
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:56,760
wearing and the dream to the exact 
detail.

1167
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,780
Well,
what is it about remembering the dreams?

1168
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:03,781
Because that's the most shocking.
There's two shocking things that these 

1169
00:50:03,781 --> 00:50:04,060
pills have done for me is for us to 
remember one,

1170
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:07,390
remembering dreams and to being lucid in
the middle of a dream.

1171
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:12,540
I stayed in a dream.
I was in a dream and I stayed in the 

1172
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:12,540
dream.
I said,

1173
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,150
oh,
well this is just a fucking dream,

1174
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,250
and I just.
I didn't even go lucid,

1175
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:17,170
like I didn't try to control it or move 
around.

1176
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:22,320
I just let the dream play out,
but I realized it was a dream and I 

1177
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:22,320
still didn't wake up.
I have a.

1178
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,170
that's a rare thing.
Pills,

1179
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,660
just for that.
Dreams.

1180
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:28,190
I have dreams.
I have fucking crazy

1181
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,740
dreams,
but I am totally lucid inside my dreams.

1182
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:33,380
Dreams that I'm reading something and 
I'll go.

1183
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,700
I'll be to go.
Wow,

1184
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:37,400
that's so funny that I'm reading 
something because nothing's there in the

1185
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,180
dream.
I'll think this.

1186
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,580
Nothing's there in my mind is making up 
these words,

1187
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:42,530
but I'm still reading them.
That's so interesting.

1188
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:47,830
I had a dream one time that me and Elvis
walked into his potel room and there 

1189
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:47,830
were four dudes,
but fucking

1190
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:50,370
right,
and I just hear me who they were.

1191
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:54,570
Be One of the best sentences ever 
created.

1192
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,880
I had a dream that I was with Elvis and 
we walked into his dressing room.

1193
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:01,380
There was four dudes,
but fucking dot,

1194
00:51:01,381 --> 00:51:02,160
dot,
dot.

1195
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,300
Now hear me out.

1196
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:09,040
It gets weird or they're throwing up in 
Burger King Cups just walking each other

1197
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,620
and then I.
When I say this,

1198
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,990
I fucking just shut the door and I 
looked at Elvis.

1199
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:16,500
I go,
what the fuck's going on in your room?

1200
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,280
He said to me,
what's your Dream Baby?

1201
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:24,990
Oh Shit.
I wake up,

1202
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,000
I wake up.
I'm like,

1203
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:26,970
wake up,
check my.

1204
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,520
Make sure it's.
I'm like,

1205
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,800
well,
you don't really put me out.

1206
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:39,690
You don't really put me out.
Not that the guys were both fucking 

1207
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,130
right.
That they didn't know it was the product

1208
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,320
placement.
Like what the fuck did Burger King do to

1209
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:45,500
get it?
How the fuck?

1210
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,860
What if they figured it out yet?
You

1211
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:53,860
just don't know that there is way to 
interject advertising into your dreams 

1212
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:59,680
in the future.
Right now it's like I got chrysler 

1213
00:51:59,680 --> 00:51:59,680
stream about the Elvis and the butt.
Fucking ha ha.

1214
00:51:59,680 --> 00:51:59,810
No,
no,

1215
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:00,410
no,
but what is.

1216
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:05,470
There's a possibility that someone could
insert a product to a dream,

1217
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,900
right?
They could give you a cheeseburger and 

1218
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,220
that cheeseburger with some experimental
thing that would make you think about 

1219
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,360
burger king in a dream and see a burger 
and a dream.

1220
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,220
Do it.
You can do it.

1221
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:19,830
It's going Geico and shit.
Yes,

1222
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:25,210
in the future,
but that doesn't make any sense because 

1223
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:25,210
donald duck noises.
It's Geico.

1224
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,050
You have to eat something to have this 
happen to you.

1225
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,640
We're.
We're missing the whole packet.

1226
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,760
We're stumbling on something very 
brilliant right now.

1227
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,410
Well,
the idea is a possibility,

1228
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:34,310
but it's like,
you know,

1229
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,370
100 years in the future,
but 100 years,

1230
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:42,050
if you're drinking booze here,
one of the rare booze pod test,

1231
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,940
these guys,
these pussies,

1232
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:47,340
that drinking corona lights,
I got a heineken like a man tall tomboy.

1233
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:52,040
What if you could bring your wife's 
brain by talking to her while she slept?

1234
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,110
Well,
people think that you can do that.

1235
00:52:54,111 --> 00:52:59,111
People think that you can hypnotize 
people while they're sleeping and they 

1236
00:52:59,111 --> 00:52:59,111
believe they can do that.
You know,

1237
00:52:59,111 --> 00:53:02,510
hypnosis guys believed that they can 
control all sorts of behavior by putting

1238
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:07,511
people under,
so if you are already under and they 

1239
00:53:07,511 --> 00:53:09,350
started talking to you,
if a guy can really hypnotize you,

1240
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,310
that's the book that those comics cannot
be human.

1241
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,340
They can't do it too.
You know the kids with anyone.

1242
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:16,760
I don't believe.
No,

1243
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:17,030
no,
no.

1244
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,260
You're wrong.
You're wrong.

1245
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:21,050
One hundred percent do it for Santos was
a good friend of mine.

1246
00:53:21,051 --> 00:53:23,830
He was already to hit the test in a 
Bosch and say,

1247
00:53:23,831 --> 00:53:25,740
good friend of mine,
a good friend.

1248
00:53:25,741 --> 00:53:25,950
That was

1249
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,290
a front.
I know,

1250
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,660
but I shouldn't say like,
you're a good friend of mine.

1251
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,460
I would call you a good friend.
I love you.

1252
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:34,320
You're a great guy.
Good friend of mine.

1253
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,300
This guy is just a guy that I worked 
with,

1254
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:41,301
but he was a very nice guy and he was.
The only reason why I say this,

1255
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,710
if this was.
If he was alive,

1256
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:51,770
I would have stuck with a very good 
friend of mine and one of the reasons 

1257
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,290
why I said is he gave me one of my first
headlining gigs.

1258
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:57,291
He actually booked some clubs back in 
Boston and when I was making the 

1259
00:53:57,291 --> 00:54:00,801
transition between being a middle act on
the road and a headlight and really I 

1260
00:54:00,801 --> 00:54:01,920
wasn't a headliner as a joke,
I was like,

1261
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:03,720
goddamn amateur.
Really just amateur.

1262
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:05,940
The people are paying money to.
It's only been doing it a few years,

1263
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,480
but um,
he was one of the few guys that gave me 

1264
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:11,480
one of the first guys to give me a 
headline and getting.

1265
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,010
But he had a real hypnosis act.
It was legit.

1266
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,810
We've talked about it on the podcast 
before.

1267
00:54:15,811 --> 00:54:18,230
It just wouldn't work with you and it 
wouldn't work in the eye.

1268
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,360
We think about things too much because 
there are people out there waiting to be

1269
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:24,720
led and it's very strange because it 
almost seems like some invasion with the

1270
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:29,721
body snatchers,
invasion of the body snatchers type 

1271
00:54:29,721 --> 00:54:31,881
shit.
There's some people that are on a 

1272
00:54:31,881 --> 00:54:33,981
different frequency than Uri and you can
talk to those people and you can get 

1273
00:54:33,981 --> 00:54:36,750
them to believe that they're having sex 
with Madonna onstage.

1274
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,990
And then the orgasm.
This guy I saw guy orgasm and his pants.

1275
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,630
Yeah.
He talks to 100 percent,

1276
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,930
paid some money for them.
I'd pay money to someone.

1277
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,250
I used to work at stitches comedy Club 
in Boston and this guy,

1278
00:54:50,251 --> 00:54:53,610
Frank Santos would come in every week 
and he would do like,

1279
00:54:53,611 --> 00:54:54,390
you know,
he had a Gig,

1280
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:56,730
like maybe it was a Tuesday night or 
something like that.

1281
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:01,830
Everyone would feel the way Boston was 
in the old days in the golden days of 

1282
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:02,880
comedy.
Everyone had a night of the week,

1283
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,040
you know,
like Wednesday night would be Kevin Knox

1284
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:08,400
tonight at Nick's comedy stop and one of
the nights was Frank Santos night.

1285
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:13,401
So Frank Santos would come by and we 
would sit in the back and watch because 

1286
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:16,620
it took comics a while for it to go from
you just start working at the club.

1287
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:18,930
What is this are already did hypnosis 
to,

1288
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,920
okay,
Frank Santos is onstage,

1289
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,470
let's go watch.
Because that,

1290
00:55:22,471 --> 00:55:24,000
that.
And that was the natural progression.

1291
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:27,120
Once you realized it was real,
we would always,

1292
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:30,810
if I was outside the room and I knew 
that Frank Santos was on the stage,

1293
00:55:30,811 --> 00:55:35,811
I had to get in the room to see what he 
was going to do because he really could 

1294
00:55:35,811 --> 00:55:39,381
get people to believe that they were 
having sex and he was the r rated 

1295
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:39,381
hypnotist.

1296
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:40,410
So it was always,
you know,

1297
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:41,490
you got your,
your,

1298
00:55:41,491 --> 00:55:46,491
your lines,
and it was weird because this weird 

1299
00:55:46,491 --> 00:55:48,651
voice because you barely could 
understand it because I wrote those 

1300
00:55:48,651 --> 00:55:49,380
words together.
Whereas it was together,

1301
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,370
wasn't it?
Okay.

1302
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:52,170
Yeah,
it was a boobies are on top of you right

1303
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:53,140
now.
This is where your boobies,

1304
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,300
you've got big boobies on top of,
you know,

1305
00:55:54,301 --> 00:55:56,550
you're very happy,
very happy and boobies.

1306
00:55:58,290 --> 00:55:59,340
Boobies.
And I'm telling you,

1307
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:04,341
these morons really do get hypnotized 
and I think it is just easily.

1308
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:08,150
There are some people that their brains 
work different than you and I.

1309
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:08,150
You

1310
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:11,290
know what?
I'll tell you what I can tell when I've.

1311
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,270
Because lately I've been playing with 
fire a little bit on stage.

1312
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:15,350
By the way.
I just want to say this.

1313
00:56:15,351 --> 00:56:18,350
I tweeted the link to that documentary 
if you want to donate.

1314
00:56:18,351 --> 00:56:22,040
That's what I was trying to fucking time
documentary.

1315
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,910
Just it's on my twitter so if you want 
to donate,

1316
00:56:24,911 --> 00:56:29,911
you get Internet savvy bird again,
gonna retweet things with the whatever 

1317
00:56:29,911 --> 00:56:34,141
you donate,
you get extras with it and it should be 

1318
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:34,141
an interesting documentary.
So thank you joe.

1319
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:39,030
So we uh,
but so I don't know if it's because of 

1320
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:41,850
the first time we talked and then you 
were saying like you,

1321
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:46,890
I don't know if you were into it,
but then lately I've just been playing 

1322
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:47,560
with fire on stage to see how far you 
can take it.

1323
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:50,050
And it's bizarre.
I don't know if it's hypnotism.

1324
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,410
It definitely is inhibited them,
but there are personalities that you can

1325
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:56,710
read from stage and you go that personal
play with me,

1326
00:56:56,711 --> 00:56:58,240
you know what I mean?
I'll bring them up.

1327
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:03,360
Like I brought these.
Blockchain might not have ever been as 

1328
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,661
playful either until they met you and 
they just this people that are just 

1329
00:57:06,661 --> 00:57:07,060
willing to go with it.
Right,

1330
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,010
right.
I did a,

1331
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:13,020
I was in Miami and I brought a black 
chick and a Puerto Rican checkup on 

1332
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,560
stage and I had them cut the lights off 
and I said,

1333
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,270
when you said that you were a little 
urban,

1334
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:17,730
and the lady said,
did you notice it?

1335
00:57:17,731 --> 00:57:22,731
I notice them on staying mobile phase 
and uh,

1336
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:31,020
and uh,
and I had them cut the lights and I 

1337
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:31,020
said,
let's,

1338
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:31,020
let's Improv a threesome.
So let's like,

1339
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:35,730
let's just cut the lights cut.
So it's pitch black so the audience 

1340
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:35,730
doesn't see anything.

1341
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:36,100
The audience can't see anything.
It's just,

1342
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:38,480
it's like now it's like a radio show.
So I go,

1343
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:40,120
Oh wow,
that's a great idea.

1344
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,300
So I go,
the winters,

1345
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:46,340
what are they saying?
What the father with the waiters are 

1346
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,441
fucking when at this point when you have
a black ticket to Puerto Rican hot 

1347
00:57:49,441 --> 00:57:50,150
onstage with a white guy who let's 
three,

1348
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:53,680
the waiters are fucking just watching.
So I go,

1349
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,150
I go,
all right ladies,

1350
00:57:55,151 --> 00:57:56,920
I'm going to go into the bathroom and 
shaved my balls.

1351
00:57:56,921 --> 00:58:01,921
You guys meet each other and then I give
them the mic and I walked to the corner 

1352
00:58:01,921 --> 00:58:02,710
of the stage and these fucking chicks 
have murdered it.

1353
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,820
They were like,
they were like,

1354
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:07,300
how big do you think is digs going to be
the one girl's back not that big.

1355
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:09,030
I bet.
And then like I said,

1356
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:14,260
well you going to do to him and it's 
just going back and forth and I'm 

1357
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:14,260
sitting in the corner stage one,
it's fucking magic.

1358
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:14,980
I'm not having nothing to do with it.
I have nothing to do with it.

1359
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:20,160
But these girls who come out of their 
shells and then I walked back in and I 

1360
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:20,160
go,
ladies,

1361
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:20,160
I,
uh,

1362
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,790
have shaved my balls,
I want you to take a look.

1363
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:26,791
And then they start making fun of my 
Dick and it's just fucking craziness.

1364
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,920
But,
but I do believe you can read people 

1365
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,470
because I,
when I said I don't know if I,

1366
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:37,530
maybe I just,
because I would never do that with a 

1367
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:37,530
white person.
I bought it.

1368
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:37,530
Just bring a Puerto Ricans and blacks on
stage.

1369
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:39,820
You wouldn't try and white people.
Like they wouldn't do that.

1370
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:44,821
White people have a tendency to try to 
be funny and they and sometimes because 

1371
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:50,401
they've listened to my show and it's 
sometimes I'll say like edgy shit about 

1372
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:54,061
race because I've taken liberties.
They then feel like they can and they'll

1373
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:58,360
drop an f bomb or oh,
it makes me so on.

1374
00:58:58,361 --> 00:59:01,630
Urban people are hilarious.
I was at this hotel watching them swim,

1375
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:01,980
the other,

1376
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:04,910
you know,
and he just,

1377
00:59:04,911 --> 00:59:09,911
we just trumped line of the day,
urban hotel watching them swim.

1378
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,640
I can't wait to hear where this is 
going.

1379
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:17,700
It's a special new vacation to the 
story.

1380
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:20,490
That's all I want to know is I want to 
have a cigarette.

1381
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,220
They just sat there and made me laugh 
for 30 minutes.

1382
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:30,221
Just watching them swim and having fun.
They're pushing each other in and stuff 

1383
00:59:30,221 --> 00:59:30,320
like that.
It was hilarious.

1384
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:35,410
One girl had her phone on and she was 
trying to hold her phone up above water 

1385
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:35,750
so it wouldn't get wet.
And she's like,

1386
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:37,330
well,
you better get this phone for me.

1387
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:37,960
She threw it

1388
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:46,750
country old lady in a kid in the face.
She threw it and hit her on

1389
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,580
kid in the face like she was throwing it
out of her friend and it hit her kid.

1390
00:59:53,581 --> 00:59:56,850
If the kid starts crying and it's the 
sister,

1391
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:00,000
the kid through that kid that was crying
into the pool and I guess that kid can't

1392
01:00:00,001 --> 01:00:00,940
swim.
She's like,

1393
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:05,010
throw that kid and it was just nonsense.
It was 30 minutes.

1394
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,520
Just stuck with the accent.

1395
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:15,770
Mom and beverly hillbillies to Old Lady,
a squid delayed all the grandmothers in 

1396
01:00:20,521 --> 01:00:25,521
the corner going through the white guy 
just watching those swim and you were 

1397
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,660
just sitting there taking notes.
It was beautiful.

1398
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,840
I was in Atlanta,
was the big hair festival this weekend.

1399
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,210
Have you seen the movie good hair?
No.

1400
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:36,400
It's the best movie ever.
Not Best Movie Chris Rock movie.

1401
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:41,660
It's so good.
You learn so much about black women 

1402
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:41,660
about it's.
It's,

1403
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,020
it's an eyeopening movie and I really 
believe every white man,

1404
01:00:43,021 --> 01:00:48,021
she'll watch it because you realize how 
much white men and black women have in 

1405
01:00:48,021 --> 01:00:50,961
common about hair.
We all have issues with our fucking 

1406
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:53,511
hair.
I was sitting next to Vivica Fox on a 

1407
01:00:53,511 --> 01:00:53,700
plane one time and we just ended up 
talking about the stuff.

1408
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:57,390
Sometimes I'll use a sprint.
What's a super millionaires?

1409
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:00,480
I sprinkle it in my hair and like I use 
that to will call you.

1410
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,070
You use.
I was like,

1411
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,600
I was like,
I use like Fox were exchanging Vivica 

1412
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:06,960
functions.
Like you got to use two colors.

1413
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,470
It makes it look more natural.
Like,

1414
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,690
oh thank you.
So,

1415
01:01:09,691 --> 01:01:13,080
but that whole hair convention was 
happening in Atlanta.

1416
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:15,180
There was a hair convention.
Hair convention.

1417
01:01:15,181 --> 01:01:16,850
Black women have a hard when it comes to
hair,

1418
01:01:16,851 --> 01:01:18,840
if they can't like sleep,
just go to bed.

1419
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,280
They're going to like sleep sitting up 
like what the fuck are you talking 

1420
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,880
about?
A black woman with a thing of hair,

1421
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,380
like a good hairstyle.
You can't just fucking go to bed.

1422
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:31,210
They'll sleep sitting up.
This movie's amazing.

1423
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:33,900
So yes,
and first of all,

1424
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:39,080
I mean I'm making generalizations right 
now that I don't want them to sound 

1425
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:39,990
racist or I want them to sound like I 
watched a movie about this and I'm.

1426
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,790
And I maybe didn't pay attention all 
that well,

1427
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:46,170
but they get all their hair from Indian 
people.

1428
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,620
Like in the middle.
It can be you mean?

1429
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:50,610
Yeah.
And weeds are expensive as shit.

1430
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:52,260
And the brothers got to pay for that 
shit.

1431
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:52,940
Like the.

1432
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,600
It is weird that we have decided that 
white girl,

1433
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:58,760
that black women have to have white girl
hair.

1434
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:00,800
Yeah.
It's so fucking crazy.

1435
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:03,260
Black eyes are allowed to have black 
hair.

1436
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,630
He for a while they didn't like sugar 
ray Robinson.

1437
01:02:05,631 --> 01:02:10,631
These to have a conch.
These to like put some chemicals in 

1438
01:02:10,631 --> 01:02:13,571
their hair to straighten their hair out.
And guys like black guys would comb 

1439
01:02:13,571 --> 01:02:13,730
their hair like a white guy.

1440
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:17,120
Have you seen beyonce lately?
She has blonde hair now.

1441
01:02:17,121 --> 01:02:20,130
If you look at her album,
like from whatever five years ago.

1442
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,100
And you look at our album now,
it looks like Micheal Jackson,

1443
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:26,010
black and white.
She's now like gold skin,

1444
01:02:26,011 --> 01:02:29,280
blonde hair.
She looks like a white person now.

1445
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:34,370
And then you look at her old album and 
it looks like she's swimming in a pool 

1446
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:37,710
and she thinks she's lightening your 
skin.

1447
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:42,850
It it seems like at orange sheet or 
their photoshopping fuck out everything 

1448
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:46,250
to photoshop crazy photoshopping her 
because she does not look black.

1449
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,490
Get on.
I can't blackface,

1450
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,290
black girl hair.
One thing again,

1451
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:50,700
they have black hair.
You know,

1452
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:51,590
why does it have to be.

1453
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,260
Be like some do,
but I think.

1454
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:58,300
I think,
I mean it's just totally outright 

1455
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,390
better.
We've got to be so brutal man.

1456
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,320
Have you seen the feathers,
Dick?

1457
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:03,170
Have you seen the feathers?
There's this new trend now.

1458
01:03:03,171 --> 01:03:05,960
Girls are wearing fucking feathers.
Like they're fucking egos and shit.

1459
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,330
It's the dumbest shit ever.
Like I keep saying this.

1460
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,890
How many feathers?

1461
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:20,380
It's got attacked by a Falcon Philly and
she had a raccoon tail.

1462
01:03:25,781 --> 01:03:29,600
I guess that's popular right now.
We this raccoon tail from your film?

1463
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,370
Yeah.
Kids are wearing these raccoon tails.

1464
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,370
Like they're animals.
Like they're fucking Mario brothers.

1465
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:39,550
Like the raccoons.
They have raccoon tails and then this 

1466
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:39,550
girl had a raccoon tail and feathers in 
her hair.

1467
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,100
Wow.

1468
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:43,440
They're like on their way to being a 
furry but not quite there yet.

1469
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:46,680
Baby-Step furries was just wearing 
raccoon tails.

1470
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:52,340
There's some people that just one little
thing will help them feel a little bit 

1471
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,700
better man.
And if it's a raccoon tail I say,

1472
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:56,160
put that thing on.
Don't shoot yourself in the head.

1473
01:03:56,190 --> 01:04:01,190
Get yourself through this.
If you need to fucking raccoon tail to 

1474
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:01,190
make you feel happy,
then put it on.

1475
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:02,260
Son.
What are you?

1476
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:03,270
Uh,
are you a Fox?

1477
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,110
You are a man.
Police were to have a nice day.

1478
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,380
I would love to see you in the chimps.
Don't have tails.

1479
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:09,710
Foxtown.
Champs tone.

1480
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:13,280
That tells the animal on the chimp.
What'd you get?

1481
01:04:13,281 --> 01:04:14,090
A little chimp?
Nope.

1482
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:19,100
Just like a little nub of a tail that 
they would wear a prosthetic asshole 

1483
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:22,770
that swells in estrus.
I wouldn't be willing to do that,

1484
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:24,840
but I think that's only for the female.
I think the female,

1485
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:29,841
her butthole,
her nether regions death swell and 

1486
01:04:29,841 --> 01:04:33,741
become enlarged.
And the gorge and I tell the mail chimp 

1487
01:04:33,741 --> 01:04:33,741
knows it's time to get freaky.

1488
01:04:33,741 --> 01:04:37,600
He got caught watching dogs.
Fuck on youtube videos watching dogs.

1489
01:04:40,111 --> 01:04:45,111
Fuck.
You've caught yourself watching like 

1490
01:04:45,111 --> 01:04:45,111
four minutes to dogs.
Fuck

1491
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:48,340
playlist off dog.
Fucking playlist on Youtube.

1492
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,060
You just fucking said it there and get 
stoned and watch a bunch of dogs.

1493
01:04:52,061 --> 01:04:57,061
Fuck man.
It's kind of funny that we can't watch 

1494
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:57,061
people.
Fuck,

1495
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:57,530
you know,
you put people fucking on Youtube.

1496
01:04:57,531 --> 01:05:02,531
They'll pull that shit right off.
Did they just pull Tripoli's all if his 

1497
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:06,031
whole entire youtube account they pulled
the whole entire time once because he 

1498
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:10,141
had this thing called master tents 
theater where it was girls with like 

1499
01:05:10,141 --> 01:05:14,580
eyeballs glued onto their boobs and it 
looked like their like their faces and 

1500
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,110
stuff like that and they pulled it from 
that and just just through long.

1501
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,080
You don't show the nipple

1502
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,000
though.
They ain't do that.

1503
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,540
I guess not.
And that other girl nipple,

1504
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:25,090
you can shut down to youtube type in 
breastfeeding.

1505
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:29,890
It was a seven year old soccer tit.
Well,

1506
01:05:29,891 --> 01:05:34,891
you know that's funny because youtube 
was very rarely pulled down any of my 

1507
01:05:34,891 --> 01:05:38,491
videos,
but one they pulled down was one that I 

1508
01:05:38,491 --> 01:05:40,480
put said Joe Rogan drinks piss.
I saw that video.

1509
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:45,540
I saw that video and I trained.
I put it back up under the title of 

1510
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,780
urine therapy and they let it go 
through.

1511
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,070
Go through.
Yeah,

1512
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:53,730
that's,
I don't know if I can drink my own piss 

1513
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:53,730
[inaudible] right now.
We get it.

1514
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:58,520
What in your eye?
I looked at him.

1515
01:05:58,521 --> 01:05:59,090
I said,
come on,

1516
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,640
let's do it right now.
And he had a sparkle in your eye.

1517
01:06:01,641 --> 01:06:02,270
Like,
Oh yeah,

1518
01:06:02,271 --> 01:06:04,780
we're doing this marriage.
Yeah.

1519
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:06,800
There was a moment,
man,

1520
01:06:06,801 --> 01:06:11,801
where you realize we just entered into 
that chaotic world that you're so 

1521
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:11,801
comfortable with you.

1522
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:13,250
You loved that world,
man.

1523
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:16,940
You locked onto that.
You locked onto that moment.

1524
01:06:16,941 --> 01:06:17,990
That's why you could do that.
So.

1525
01:06:17,991 --> 01:06:19,080
Well,
age man,

1526
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,030
because I.
because I just can't say it.

1527
01:06:21,031 --> 01:06:24,280
I have a hard time when we were at the 
know you like chaos,

1528
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,040
love and enjoy it.
This guy,

1529
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:28,170
the at the,
at the braves game ball.

1530
01:06:28,171 --> 01:06:29,810
That's going to fucking go everywhere.
No,

1531
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:32,610
I think you're a skier.
At the braves game,

1532
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,340
gay beer came running up to me.
We're in the porch,

1533
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:37,080
the chophouse at the end and the back 
end,

1534
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:42,090
the outfield.
He comes running and he's like machine 

1535
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:42,090
and I go,
hey man.

1536
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:42,090
And he goes,
oh,

1537
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:42,690
fuck him up.
We got to do a shot right now.

1538
01:06:42,691 --> 01:06:45,120
It's the middle of afternoon,
I a Sunday show and I'm like,

1539
01:06:45,121 --> 01:06:46,020
I can't man,
and he goes,

1540
01:06:46,021 --> 01:06:47,760
come on some machine and I go,
all right,

1541
01:06:47,761 --> 01:06:48,360
let's fucking do it.

1542
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:53,630
And that my friends go,
I just watched you fold so fucking 

1543
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:53,630
quick.
I was like,

1544
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:53,630
well,
you said to machine.

1545
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:56,100
I mean,
how do I not like we're brothers now.

1546
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:01,350
You and I both have that same issue too,
that your party guys too.

1547
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:06,380
We're both chaos people.
I mean there's a thousand videos of me 

1548
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:09,270
is screaming at people on Youtube and 
and audiences and hecklers and stuff.

1549
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:12,930
When I was in Milwaukee,
the show,

1550
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,210
it was a,
it was a great audience.

1551
01:07:15,211 --> 01:07:20,211
Let me just.
It was a weird thing and then it got 

1552
01:07:20,211 --> 01:07:20,850
crazy and people yelling things out left
and right,

1553
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,720
but before that there they're laughing 
and everything.

1554
01:07:24,721 --> 01:07:29,721
They're like a great crowd.
There's just a few crazy drunk 

1555
01:07:29,721 --> 01:07:32,301
knuckleheads and it eventually wound up 
being like one of these question and 

1556
01:07:32,301 --> 01:07:32,690
answer type things where you know,
people,

1557
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,860
people are yelling things out.
I'm talking to them,

1558
01:07:34,861 --> 01:07:38,010
but people like that and you know what 
they like about it.

1559
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:43,010
They like when they have,
they know that you brought these girls 

1560
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:44,340
out of the audience there onstage with 
you and you're off in the corner shaving

1561
01:07:44,341 --> 01:07:49,341
your balls.
They know that this is just coming out 

1562
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:49,341
of nowhere.
That's what I know,

1563
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:50,280
but it.
But it makes it,

1564
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:53,790
it makes it like.
I almost feel like it's a,

1565
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,810
it's like shooting heroin,
like doing standard smoking,

1566
01:07:57,811 --> 01:08:02,811
heroin.
Then you get someone on stage and you 

1567
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:05,121
have this real fucking moment where you 
got three gangbangers dicks out and 

1568
01:08:05,121 --> 01:08:06,000
they're fucking real talk.
Mother fucker is the three.

1569
01:08:06,001 --> 01:08:07,020
Oh five.
And you're like,

1570
01:08:07,021 --> 01:08:08,640
do you have guys had their dicks out on 
stage?

1571
01:08:08,641 --> 01:08:09,630
Yeah,
I told you that one time.

1572
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:10,650
Yeah.
Explain that again.

1573
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:11,990
What happened?
I was in Miami.

1574
01:08:11,991 --> 01:08:14,250
Miami's my crazy fucking place.
I've,

1575
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,730
I,
it just chaos happens in Miami.

1576
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:17,540
Yeah.
Miami,

1577
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:20,060
if you want to starve to death,
open up a bookstore in Miami.

1578
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:28,950
Fucking jokes are so good.
How does that work that you say that?

1579
01:08:28,951 --> 01:08:29,180
No,
you.

1580
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:30,240
If you want to start done.
It was like,

1581
01:08:30,241 --> 01:08:31,870
where's he going with this?
And then you switch it.

1582
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,140
My brain starts going,
oh,

1583
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,330
time to giggle.
What does,

1584
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:38,790
how does that work?
It's time to Giggle,

1585
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,030
but other night.
Let's fuck.

1586
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:41,940
Let's put it on

1587
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:46,220
Carola's reading glasses and see if we 
can solve this with Adam Carolla here.

1588
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,060
Yeah,
man.

1589
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:51,610
I get fucking a-listers here.
I've got an issue.

1590
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:55,880
My eyes are really bad.
He needs reading glasses really bad.

1591
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:59,000
But.
But like there was this thing where he's

1592
01:08:59,001 --> 01:08:59,960
like looking at the receipt.
Like,

1593
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,790
what's this say right here?
Well,

1594
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:06,810
I can't see in low light in the 
highlight conditions is absolute true 

1595
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:07,320
and highlight conditions.
My,

1596
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:12,370
my eyes were great,
but in low light conditions have a 

1597
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:12,410
really hard time reading now.
I think it looks great.

1598
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:13,970
I think that's going to be your new 
style.

1599
01:09:13,971 --> 01:09:16,800
You're going to be one of those guys 
like random problems.

1600
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:21,870
My problem is that my eyes and Adam 
crawls eyes are in the same state of 

1601
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:23,310
deterioration.
Yeah.

1602
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:27,320
I thought it was a big guy.
Wow.

1603
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,910
This is so much better,
right?

1604
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:29,990
Yeah.
You need.

1605
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:34,991
It might do.
You could just get Oakley a rims and 

1606
01:09:34,991 --> 01:09:34,991
then just tell me what those.
Uh,

1607
01:09:34,991 --> 01:09:35,620
Linda.
No,

1608
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,800
you don't.
You don't want to wear them so sad.

1609
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:41,740
You've got to get the ones that flip up 
and fold up like old congressmen have.

1610
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:43,160
Yeah,
I can read this easily,

1611
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:44,570
but not.
It's not as clear.

1612
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:47,240
My Dad has these glasses.
They're magical.

1613
01:09:47,241 --> 01:09:49,510
They go one side as far sided.
One side is normal,

1614
01:09:49,511 --> 01:09:49,670
so yeah,

1615
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:54,750
if he ever wants to read something in 
the 30 some magic,

1616
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:05,210
there's a man named Harry Potter and 
lives in the castle and he solved the 

1617
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:07,560
problem of vision.
The warlock lenscrafters gave it to.

1618
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,880
I wonder men,
the first dude to come up with glasses,

1619
01:10:09,881 --> 01:10:11,560
man.
He must've been a goddamn wizard.

1620
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,660
Who's the first guy that got girls to 
swallow?

1621
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:17,200
That shit's been going on since the 
stone age.

1622
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:19,300
There's no one who could hold claim to 
that.

1623
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:21,550
There's probably a few charlatans from 
the 15 hundreds.

1624
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:22,910
I was the first.
No,

1625
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:23,380
no,
no,

1626
01:10:23,381 --> 01:10:28,381
no.
The cave man bitches were sucking dicks 

1627
01:10:28,381 --> 01:10:28,720
and swollen loads.
Loads contain nutrients.

1628
01:10:28,721 --> 01:10:31,120
Back then you had to learn hard to stay 
alive.

1629
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,530
GNC,
you drank your piercing.

1630
01:10:33,531 --> 01:10:35,810
He swallowed other people's loads.
Whatever.

1631
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,250
You don't like it,
but I just want to be healthy.

1632
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:42,640
It's tapioca pudding son,
Alphacam

1633
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:43,910
baby.
Oh,

1634
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:49,310
Alpha Alpha nails with my Alphacam.
So you noticed with those pills,

1635
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,750
those pills.
I,

1636
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,410
I,
you know what,

1637
01:10:52,411 --> 01:10:57,411
there's a lot of people online that are 
like crying about it because they will 

1638
01:10:57,411 --> 01:10:57,900
know no one who's known as Tegan is 
crying about it.

1639
01:10:57,901 --> 01:10:58,460
Right?
Exactly.

1640
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,270
That's what I'm saying.
Guy I met loves it.

1641
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:05,290
He don't want to believe that there's 
something that you can take that can 

1642
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:09,111
actually enhance brain function.
Like this would be like the biggest 

1643
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:09,111
thing that ever happened.
Neuroscience,

1644
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:13,020
we're not talking about some limitless 
pill that you take and all of a sudden 

1645
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:13,590
you're super genius,
but we're talking about is you when you

1646
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:19,010
don't.
You have moments where you feel at your 

1647
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:19,010
best.
Yeah.

1648
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:19,010
Yeah.
Did you?

1649
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,160
But it's at your best.
You're not on steroids.

1650
01:11:20,161 --> 01:11:22,250
You're not on limitless.
You not on some craziest,

1651
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:27,350
but it's you at your best and those 
moments are hard to attain and I think 

1652
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:29,520
they have a lot to do with rest and 
nutrition.

1653
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:34,260
I think you at your best has to do with 
what your body is processing.

1654
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:37,450
What is it?
Processing good foods and vegetables and

1655
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:39,600
vitamins and everything is smooth and 
easy.

1656
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:42,270
It's got everything.
It's required and when you do that,

1657
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:42,920
things work

1658
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:44,010
better.
I started,

1659
01:11:44,011 --> 01:11:49,011
I started not drinking on Thursday and 
Friday and Saturday,

1660
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,070
Friday,
Saturday.

1661
01:11:50,071 --> 01:11:53,040
I blow it out a bit on stage.
Definitely not drinking on Thursday.

1662
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:54,990
Going up on stage too much.
Is that going to bed,

1663
01:11:54,991 --> 01:11:56,820
getting a good night's sleep,
working out Thursday,

1664
01:11:56,821 --> 01:11:57,450
Friday,
Saturday,

1665
01:11:57,451 --> 01:12:02,451
Sunday workout every single day.
Eat healthy at the clubs and then 

1666
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:03,210
whatever I can get around the club,
around the hotel.

1667
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:05,700
I did it.
I'm grant funding.

1668
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:08,460
I did it one weekend but,
but,

1669
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:13,570
but I felt good.
I felt really good and I thought I 

1670
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:13,570
started thinking,
you know,

1671
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:17,850
that there is something to that.
Because this last weekend in Atlanta,

1672
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:20,820
I was on a bender,
a drink every morning.

1673
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:23,670
I drank every morning on radio.
I drank every,

1674
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
every evening on stage.
I spent the whole night out all night 

1675
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,150
and then every day like my friends would
come down and we'd go drinking or Jesus.

1676
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,760
It was,
it was a bender.

1677
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:35,850
Didn't drink pedialyte.
No.

1678
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:36,420
You know what,
man,

1679
01:12:36,421 --> 01:12:39,100
I wonder if I'm dehydrated as fuck.
Of course you will.

1680
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,120
Yeah.
Just start drinking fucking a coconut 

1681
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,410
water coconut water right now.
Uh,

1682
01:12:46,411 --> 01:12:48,270
well.
Don't want to interrupt my beers.

1683
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:50,600
The um,
the.

1684
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:51,810
Yeah,
I started doing that.

1685
01:12:51,811 --> 01:12:56,811
And then.
And then you don't want any drink on 

1686
01:12:56,811 --> 01:12:56,811
flights or drink complains heavily.
I drank.

1687
01:12:56,811 --> 01:12:58,840
I tried to slow down today because I was
like drink.

1688
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:01,980
It's panic but.
And that helps you know,

1689
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:03,720
fix it.
But I was like,

1690
01:13:03,721 --> 01:13:06,300
I don't wanna be a mess when I show up 
at your house and just be like fucking.

1691
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,620
I was hoping you were going to be a 
mess.

1692
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,290
Trust me when I say that.
I'm a good mess.

1693
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:13,140
I'm a fun math madness.
Yeah.

1694
01:13:13,141 --> 01:13:14,760
There's some people that I would say 
you're drinking.

1695
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,050
Um,
let's do this tomorrow.

1696
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:16,960
I'll do it tomorrow.
Did,

1697
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,230
but you're not that guy.
Do you know what?

1698
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:21,600
My Dad gave me a pony a

1699
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:35,230
me softly and show you where to go back 
to the old family field.

1700
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:53,050
Richard Dawson.
Did

1701
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,170
you.
You sent me that shit about Andy Dick by

1702
01:13:57,171 --> 01:13:59,380
the way.
What the fuck was going on?

1703
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:07,730
Tell me exactly what happened was I was 
watching it on the plane so I didn't 

1704
01:14:07,730 --> 01:14:08,960
really get the whole thing,
but andy was on.

1705
01:14:08,961 --> 01:14:11,610
Greg Fitzsimmons only said he was a Jew 
and they off on that,

1706
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:12,140
kept going

1707
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:15,110
on about hook nose Jew and calling them 
a hook known to look.

1708
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,500
Andy is obviously in a tail spin right 
now.

1709
01:14:18,501 --> 01:14:21,530
He's in a downward spiral,
you know,

1710
01:14:21,531 --> 01:14:25,390
he keeps getting.
He got sober when he was on our show who

1711
01:14:25,391 --> 01:14:27,890
was sober and then afterwards he got 
arrested.

1712
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:30,950
Did Ab maybe got arrested?
I mean maybe he was.

1713
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,210
Yeah.
You don't think he was so.

1714
01:14:32,211 --> 01:14:33,680
But you think he was cooking up?
I don't think.

1715
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:35,590
I don't know what he was and I don't 
want to say he was,

1716
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,600
but I do know he has the biggest,
a urinary track infection I've ever 

1717
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:40,660
seen.
Then because he keeps.

1718
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:44,370
He went to the back of my four times.
He could've been doing something there.

1719
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:47,180
He maybe he did that for confidence.
Who's worried about,

1720
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:52,210
you know,
he had talked to a lot of shit about me 

1721
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:52,210
and then all of sudden is going to be on
a podcast and he also,

1722
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:56,090
because he also,
the only reason I ever think this is 

1723
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:56,090
because I noticed that he went to the 
bathroom four times,

1724
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:57,800
but that also that he was saying he was 
sober,

1725
01:14:57,801 --> 01:14:59,240
but then people at the comedy store is 
like,

1726
01:14:59,241 --> 01:15:00,680
dude,
he was blacking out here last year,

1727
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:02,000
last night when you told him

1728
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,180
me that about that,
that people did at the comedy store.

1729
01:15:04,181 --> 01:15:06,010
Psalm all fucked up.
You know,

1730
01:15:06,011 --> 01:15:10,240
Andy and I have a lot of history and uh,
I understand Andy in a way that very few

1731
01:15:10,241 --> 01:15:11,360
people do.
And I,

1732
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:11,770
I,
when I,

1733
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:14,350
when I say that I honestly loved the guy
and I wish them the best.

1734
01:15:14,351 --> 01:15:16,860
I honestly do.
I really do.

1735
01:15:16,861 --> 01:15:20,170
And he's a,
he's a good person and his best moments,

1736
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,570
you know,
he's just crazy as fuck.

1737
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:27,900
And he blames me for a lot of,
like his bad times when he was on news 

1738
01:15:28,331 --> 01:15:30,550
radio and he's like,
he is so angry.

1739
01:15:30,551 --> 01:15:35,551
He was so mean to me.
He doesn't realize he was constantly 

1740
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,690
pushing my buttons.
He was constantly fucking with me and he

1741
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:39,910
was doing it because it's just in his 
nature.

1742
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:44,320
He had a,
an insane childhood and I don't know the

1743
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:48,130
full details,
but I know it was not good and you know,

1744
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,080
because of that he's,
you know,

1745
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:53,710
become this incredibly talented,
gifted,

1746
01:15:53,711 --> 01:15:56,190
sort of a needy cat.
And uh,

1747
01:15:56,230 --> 01:16:01,230
our,
our relationship has always been very 

1748
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:01,230
strange,
you know,

1749
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:02,290
like he literally bang on my trailer 
door,

1750
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:04,390
opened it up and he had his dick in his 
hand,

1751
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,960
but you do understand.
Friend was in the,

1752
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:09,720
in the room and he's like,
can you guys fuck?

1753
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:10,630
And he's like,
try,

1754
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:15,650
I mean it was fucking serious.
But you do understand that even though 

1755
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:16,290
when he was on the show that might've 
been like to you,

1756
01:16:16,291 --> 01:16:18,240
but that was in lot of people's 
opinions,

1757
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:22,740
the best fucking duo ever watching you 
and gather.

1758
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:25,920
It's probably one of the best things 
I've ever seen in my whole entire life.

1759
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:31,820
Interesting.
When we did the show and we did the 

1760
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,351
show,
we had this weird love hate 

1761
01:16:33,351 --> 01:16:34,791
relationship.
Like Andy could make me laugh harder 

1762
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:34,791
than anybody.
Man,

1763
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:38,121
when we did scenes together,
I would have to redo things like three 

1764
01:16:38,121 --> 01:16:39,300
or four times because I couldn't stop 
cracking up.

1765
01:16:39,301 --> 01:16:42,510
I couldn't help myself.
We had this one where there was pencils.

1766
01:16:42,511 --> 01:16:47,511
I had pencils in my hand and one of them
was obviously way longer than the other 

1767
01:16:47,511 --> 01:16:51,231
one,
which is the longest one is like the 

1768
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:52,820
attack and it gets in my face and he's 
like,

1769
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:55,860
it's just studying it and I couldn't 
stop laughing.

1770
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:57,090
He's fucking brilliant.
Oh

1771
01:16:57,090 --> 01:17:02,090
Man.
I remember falling in love with that 

1772
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:02,090
show.
He's not that guy anymore.

1773
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,240
He's now he's Andy at 50 or whatever.
It is.

1774
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:06,120
So sad.
What did he say?

1775
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:08,190
I mean,
what's that look?

1776
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,130
Here's the root of it.
Forget all

1777
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,980
the words that came out.
What's the intention behind it?

1778
01:17:12,981 --> 01:17:17,981
The intention behind it is to lash out 
at Howard stern so that Howard stern in 

1779
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:23,180
turn lashes back and maybe there's room 
for reconciliation and all this is just 

1780
01:17:24,531 --> 01:17:28,100
giant sums of attention.
If it was money,

1781
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:31,600
it would be a financial downpour.
It's attention.

1782
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:36,670
That's what it is,
and he probably doesn't even realize it 

1783
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:39,461
when he's saying it,
but Howard starting to do anything to 

1784
01:17:39,461 --> 01:17:39,461
him and he's,
you know,

1785
01:17:39,461 --> 01:17:39,461
what did I mean?
Did he owe money?

1786
01:17:39,461 --> 01:17:40,980
Oh No,
no.

1787
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:42,870
Howard stern doesn't know a fucking say 
human.

1788
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:47,520
He called him when Charlie Sheen was one
the show and wanted to like put his,

1789
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,940
he just wanted attention when Charlie 
Sheen was darn electronic,

1790
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:54,240
Jane or Charlie Sheen was there and uh,
and Howard wouldn't take the call and he

1791
01:17:54,241 --> 01:17:55,650
said something like,
Andy's,

1792
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:57,750
you know,
why are we going to take listen to him?

1793
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:59,940
He's living in a fucking trailer in the 
back of his house.

1794
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,490
He is or whatever.
And then Andy got upset,

1795
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:05,220
lashed out at,
at Howard all greg show.

1796
01:18:05,221 --> 01:18:08,140
And I heard Howard talk about it and I 
really,

1797
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:10,750
it really was like,
you know,

1798
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:13,860
it almost sounded like Michael Richards 
when he tried to like,

1799
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:15,120
you know,
the nigger thing,

1800
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:20,880
almost bain,
but it's super sad.

1801
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:24,960
I don't even want to say it's sad.
It's just because I don't want,

1802
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,850
I wouldn't want to put that energy out 
there,

1803
01:18:26,851 --> 01:18:31,851
but it is because man Andy was,
was so fucking talented.

1804
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,230
He still towns,
he's just crazy.

1805
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:35,650
Some layers.
It still cracks me up.

1806
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:37,970
I don't care if he's sober.
He's still cracks me up.

1807
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:40,360
He's not doing good right now.
That's what the problem is.

1808
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:42,670
If he was doing good,
if he was on a sitcom right now and he's

1809
01:18:42,671 --> 01:18:43,020
making

1810
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:48,250
tons of cash and you know,
and he could fuck off and then pull it 

1811
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:48,470
back together again,
he'd be okay.

1812
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,080
The problem is right now he's not on st 
and he's in.

1813
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:56,470
He's in a bad place.
It's not good and so he's lashing out 

1814
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:56,470
with Howard Stern.

1815
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:58,060
I think the lesson is don't ever tell 
people you're quitting drinking.

1816
01:18:58,061 --> 01:18:58,570
Just quote

1817
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,200
he was he,
he did it and then he would say,

1818
01:19:01,201 --> 01:19:02,910
you know,
I'm not saying it's forever.

1819
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:04,620
I don't know though.
His response,

1820
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,540
like Howard Stern's response to it.
That kind of freaked me out because it's

1821
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:08,530
like,
dude,

1822
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,620
why are you going off on,
what was it?

1823
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:12,060
Thirty minutes,
40 minutes.

1824
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:17,210
You immediately snapped and now like 
this guy that you obviously know it's 

1825
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:20,601
fucked up,
you're fucking destroying him in 30 

1826
01:19:20,601 --> 01:19:21,360
minutes and like him and robin just like
Kinda tore andy apart.

1827
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:26,630
Like I was like,
you have to understand where Andy is 

1828
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:26,630
right now.
And like,

1829
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:27,930
like you pretty much exposed yourself 
and just saying like,

1830
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:29,760
all right,
you don't give a shit about this dude.

1831
01:19:29,761 --> 01:19:31,800
So even if you have some qualms with 
this guy,

1832
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:37,010
you just pretty much just expose 
yourself as like thinking this guy is 

1833
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:37,350
the worst person in the room.
At least that's what I got from it.

1834
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:39,890
I don't understand what you're saying.
He just,

1835
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:40,930
he just,
he,

1836
01:19:40,931 --> 01:19:41,700
he,
he like,

1837
01:19:41,701 --> 01:19:46,701
he really focused on what Andy said 
about being a Jew or being like a Jew 

1838
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:46,701
Hook,
nose,

1839
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:48,690
Jew or whatever he like.
And if you look at old school,

1840
01:19:48,691 --> 01:19:53,691
Howard Stern,
Howard stern was the first person to 

1841
01:19:53,691 --> 01:19:53,691
like make fun of blacks.
Make Fun of fucking Italians.

1842
01:19:53,691 --> 01:19:53,910
Make Fun.
Like,

1843
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:58,530
like Howard used to be like this risky 
guy and he focused so much on like being

1844
01:19:58,531 --> 01:19:59,840
called a Jew,
like,

1845
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:04,850
like it,
like it seemed like the whole thing was 

1846
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:04,850
because of that,
like some anger at.

1847
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:05,250
Okay.
You know what I'm talking about?

1848
01:20:05,251 --> 01:20:07,430
Like kind of misordered knowing you're 
talking about.

1849
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,880
But honestly

1850
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,480
when I was hearing that I was the,
first of all,

1851
01:20:10,481 --> 01:20:12,780
I was like,
this is so low level.

1852
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:17,070
This is such a low level move to ses at 
Julie's a hook,

1853
01:20:17,071 --> 01:20:18,540
nose Jew.
I was like,

1854
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,020
come on man,
this is like,

1855
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,470
this is,
this is just more on shit.

1856
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:23,940
And it's like you're,
you're,

1857
01:20:23,941 --> 01:20:28,941
you're just going after this stuff that 
he goes after about himself and you're 

1858
01:20:28,941 --> 01:20:31,350
going after it and you're saying he's 
got a sore spot.

1859
01:20:31,351 --> 01:20:33,270
They're like,
what is this?

1860
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:37,470
It's just idiotic because what it is.
But his reaction to it,

1861
01:20:37,471 --> 01:20:41,640
you gotta realize Howard Stern is an old
school dude.

1862
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:42,870
You know,
he's older than us,

1863
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:44,490
man.
He's been around a long time,

1864
01:20:44,491 --> 01:20:47,790
pre internet and he grew up in a fucking
black community man.

1865
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:52,791
So you know,
that kind of racist or calling them a 

1866
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:52,791
Jew,
calling them a Jew is.

1867
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:54,270
It doesn't feel good man.

1868
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:57,120
It feels fucking shitty and it feels 
like something that he has to defend.

1869
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,830
And when he says that,
if anybody,

1870
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:02,280
if this guy did this rant about any 
other ethnicity,

1871
01:21:02,281 --> 01:21:06,180
if he did this rant about black people,
he would be all over the fucking news.

1872
01:21:06,181 --> 01:21:11,181
People would be talking about let's 
blackball hamlet's never hire him again 

1873
01:21:11,181 --> 01:21:12,480
because he's running off at the mouth 
about Jews.

1874
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:16,290
Nobody cares.
Because the presumption is that Jews run

1875
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:18,480
show business anyway.
Oh poor,

1876
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:19,740
you know,
$500.

1877
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:21,510
Millionaire,
Howard Stern.

1878
01:21:21,511 --> 01:21:23,050
It gets called a Jew,
you know?

1879
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,630
Oh,
you're going to be okay.

1880
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:25,980
You know,
that's the presumption.

1881
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,500
You don't know when you really.
I agree with Howard though.

1882
01:21:28,501 --> 01:21:29,090
I think,
you know,

1883
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:31,080
you got to point it out.
If this was,

1884
01:21:31,081 --> 01:21:33,540
if he was talking to my gaze and he 
wasn't gay,

1885
01:21:33,541 --> 01:21:34,650
but he was gay.
So if he is gay,

1886
01:21:34,651 --> 01:21:36,330
wouldn't you know,
Andy talked about gays,

1887
01:21:36,331 --> 01:21:37,260
that they'd be like,
whatever,

1888
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:42,320
you know what I mean?
But he had sort of gay gay style 

1889
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:46,010
sometimes at times every day being in 
the podcasts and it him sitting next to 

1890
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:47,340
me and going,
oh,

1891
01:21:47,341 --> 01:21:48,690
so attracted to you

1892
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:53,470
going back.
No fucking way.

1893
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,580
No Way.
Never do that.

1894
01:21:54,581 --> 01:21:55,420
You never.
No,

1895
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:55,770
no,
no.

1896
01:21:55,810 --> 01:22:00,810
That's it.
There's nothing good about killing him 

1897
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:01,160
with my hands.
Fuck.

1898
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:07,100
He always scared for you go to jail.
There's no follow up to that interview.

1899
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:13,250
No,
I'm just saying that you thought the 

1900
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:13,250
interview was really awful.
No,

1901
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:13,250
no,
no,

1902
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:13,270
no.
It was uncomfortable for me,

1903
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:15,140
but I didn't think it was an 
interesting,

1904
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:16,270
very funny.
Yeah,

1905
01:22:16,271 --> 01:22:16,750
yeah.
Yeah.

1906
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:18,520
And he's hilarious.
Look,

1907
01:22:18,521 --> 01:22:20,220
if Andy and I,
you know,

1908
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:23,380
if this is a true story,
this is a true statement.

1909
01:22:23,381 --> 01:22:28,300
Rather if a sitcom came up and they said
we want to do a sitcom with you and andy

1910
01:22:28,301 --> 01:22:33,301
and we're pretty sure we've got andy 
under control and Andy is talking to a 

1911
01:22:33,301 --> 01:22:34,450
therapist and he's on this new thing 
that's called Zoloft,

1912
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:34,990
Tinian

1913
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:38,250
fucking insights.
A lot of Zoloft.

1914
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,510
And apparently it's totally leveled them
out,

1915
01:22:40,511 --> 01:22:41,920
but he's funnier than ever.
And they let her.

1916
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,930
I smoke pot.
He's only allowed to smoke pot.

1917
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:44,980
I'd be like,
wow,

1918
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,030
okay.
What network?

1919
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:49,340
I swear to God,
man,

1920
01:22:49,341 --> 01:22:53,030
I loved working with that guy.
But if he said all those things,

1921
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,410
what about

1922
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:58,410
Howard that he said about me?
It wouldn't hurt me as much as it hurt 

1923
01:22:58,410 --> 01:22:59,920
Howard or make me as man because I know 
who he is.

1924
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:03,040
I know you can't trick me with a bunch 
of noise that comes out of your mouth.

1925
01:23:03,041 --> 01:23:05,010
I know where it all comes from.
I know.

1926
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,960
I know the fiber of his being in these 
crazy.

1927
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:09,760
He's crazy as fuck.
You know,

1928
01:23:09,761 --> 01:23:12,160
and he didn't know what he really means 
by all this.

1929
01:23:12,161 --> 01:23:14,680
As he feels abandoned,
he's got nothing going on.

1930
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:17,590
And so he lashes out and he says fucked 
up shit like that.

1931
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,510
But that's really what it is.
So when,

1932
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:21,550
when Howard got all mad and you know,
and,

1933
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,500
and freaked out about it,
I saw his point,

1934
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:27,970
but I also saw a point where someone 
needs to be right next to Howard going,

1935
01:23:27,971 --> 01:23:29,710
dude,
not about this guy,

1936
01:23:29,711 --> 01:23:31,630
this guy to go over this,
get out.

1937
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:34,300
Because he was going off about like,
you know,

1938
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:39,301
number one in the market,
have you try going into a market and 

1939
01:23:39,301 --> 01:23:39,830
become number one,
why all these comedians on Corolla?

1940
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:44,850
Yeah.
He was going off about why these 

1941
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:44,850
comedians are jealous of me.
Why know?

1942
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:44,980
Why do they say things about me?
Look,

1943
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:47,960
here's the deal.
Like if you walk around my house,

1944
01:23:47,961 --> 01:23:52,961
man,
you'll see lenny bruce all over the 

1945
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:56,171
place you've been.
You've seen these posters that have 

1946
01:23:56,171 --> 01:23:58,451
happened.
I don't want to sit around listening to 

1947
01:23:58,451 --> 01:23:58,451
lenny.
Bruce.

1948
01:23:58,451 --> 01:23:58,451
Okay.
I don't,

1949
01:23:58,451 --> 01:24:02,531
I don't.
It's not like I listen to them every 

1950
01:24:02,531 --> 01:24:02,531
day,
but in my mind,

1951
01:24:02,531 --> 01:24:06,640
the only way I would've ever gotten to 
do what I'm doing with my life is if 

1952
01:24:07,101 --> 01:24:10,070
there was some bad mother fucker from 
the sixties,

1953
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:15,460
some crazy Jew named lenny bruce and 
this motherfucker was such a bad ass and

1954
01:24:16,581 --> 01:24:17,960
a risk taker.
It didn't.

1955
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:21,230
He got arrested.
They put them in jail for saying certain

1956
01:24:21,231 --> 01:24:26,231
words.
He was a guy who got on stage in front 

1957
01:24:26,231 --> 01:24:26,231
of a bunch of people in a mixed audience
and started calling.

1958
01:24:26,231 --> 01:24:27,400
Where are the niggers were the 
negatives?

1959
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:29,170
Whereas a nigger over here,
we've got a Nigga over there.

1960
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,060
We've got a Nigga over here,
we have a Nigga,

1961
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:32,150
we gotta,
we gotta jude.

1962
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:33,660
We got kick.
Here's a kite.

1963
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:35,210
We gotta go over here.
Really?

1964
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:35,900
He would.
Yeah,

1965
01:24:35,901 --> 01:24:36,230
yeah,
yeah.

1966
01:24:36,231 --> 01:24:38,180
He was with a spic dirty spic right 
there.

1967
01:24:38,181 --> 01:24:39,620
That's like,
here's a SPEC.

1968
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:41,540
Here's a walk.
We got New Guinea wop.

1969
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:43,350
We've got a Jew,
a giddy up.

1970
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:45,350
We got two niggas.
Are you saying?

1971
01:24:45,351 --> 01:24:50,351
He said,
and he said that he had this whole bit 

1972
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:51,110
about.
If you say that enough,

1973
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:53,750
then it's not going to hurt a little 
kid's feelings.

1974
01:24:53,751 --> 01:24:58,751
It won't be so shocking.
Will take away the power from this 

1975
01:24:58,751 --> 01:25:02,021
stupid word.
He was the first guy to use a joke 

1976
01:25:02,021 --> 01:25:05,740
about.
There's two jokes that I've heard that 

1977
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:07,781
people ripped off.
They probably didn't even realize they 

1978
01:25:07,781 --> 01:25:07,781
ripped off,
but they were lenny bruce jokes.

1979
01:25:07,781 --> 01:25:10,460
One of them was he goes,
being a homosexual is illegal.

1980
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:15,490
Dig.
So what would happen is when the see 

1981
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:15,490
someone,
they arrest you,

1982
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:18,851
they put you in jail,
but men want to have sex with you mean 

1983
01:25:18,851 --> 01:25:20,060
we can't.
In our.

1984
01:25:20,061 --> 01:25:23,540
In our context of our society in 2011,
our,

1985
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:28,810
our level of social evolution,
we're far beyond where we were in the 

1986
01:25:28,810 --> 01:25:32,561
sixties,
but this guy in the sixties was fucking 

1987
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:34,690
revolutionary and so that's why I have 
posters of money,

1988
01:25:34,691 --> 01:25:38,120
bruises all over my house.
If you want to talk about radio,

1989
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:43,660
there's only one guy you want to talk 
about and that's Howard stern and that 

1990
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:45,860
is a fact.
I don't give a fuck what you say.

1991
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:51,070
That guy is revolutionary.
He's the one guy who stepped in when 

1992
01:25:51,531 --> 01:25:56,270
everybody was doing the same stupid shit
and he took chances.

1993
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,580
He did crazy shit.
He,

1994
01:25:58,670 --> 01:26:03,670
he went deep and dark and it's not 
because he really means all the things 

1995
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:04,080
that he's saying he wants to putting

1996
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,680
on a show,
extreme entertainment,

1997
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:09,260
extreme and attainment,
but in doing so,

1998
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:12,440
you put out a lot of you.
You take a lot of chances,

1999
01:26:12,441 --> 01:26:17,441
you expose yourself and you become very 
sensitive and through all of his 

2000
01:26:17,441 --> 01:26:20,951
attacks,
I think he's become more sensitive 

2001
01:26:20,951 --> 01:26:21,980
because I don't think that Howard stern 
of 10,

2002
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:25,110
15 years ago would have reacted the way 
he reacted to any deck.

2003
01:26:25,111 --> 01:26:28,490
Now I think he would mock Andy Dick 
because I think,

2004
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:30,170
I don't want to say he was correcting 
who is incorrect,

2005
01:26:30,171 --> 01:26:32,090
but if Andy says something about me like
that,

2006
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:36,400
I would have it on and I would start 
laughing and say I need to call

2007
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:37,870
Dick.
Well,

2008
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:42,880
life counselor was thinking,
what do I need to do to get my life in 

2009
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:42,880
order?
Well,

2010
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,210
I'm a hook.
No Jew is fix the sandy.

2011
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:45,760
You know,
like,

2012
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,140
what the fuck are you trying to say?
Not only that,

2013
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:50,860
here's a guy living in a shed who's 
giving this advice out,

2014
01:26:50,861 --> 01:26:53,300
which just makes it even more ironic.
That's marriage.

2015
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:55,150
Do you think that's him?
Him and Howard death.

2016
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:57,400
Who the fuck do I know?
I'm not wanting to come.

2017
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,460
I don't know him that well.
If I knew him that well,

2018
01:26:59,461 --> 01:27:01,320
it do a show more often.
I don't know him that well.

2019
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:02,310
She's older.
Yeah.

2020
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:05,690
Once you get older,
you're going to extreme human being,

2021
01:27:05,691 --> 01:27:10,691
man.
He's an extreme example of what's 

2022
01:27:10,691 --> 01:27:10,691
possible.
There's in any sport,

2023
01:27:10,691 --> 01:27:11,570
man,
you know,

2024
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,460
but it's,
oh Michael Jordan's a douche bag.

2025
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:18,730
But you know what,
Michael Jordan can dunk from fucking 

2026
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:18,730
half court,
so shut the fuck up here.

2027
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:21,050
We don't know why that guy's a Douche 
bag and I'm not.

2028
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:24,650
I'm not giving him a free pass.
I'm not giving anyone a free pass,

2029
01:27:24,651 --> 01:27:28,770
but excellent examples of human beings 
in any form that doesn't.

2030
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:30,590
They don't come balanced.
Okay?

2031
01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:35,330
For someone to reach the highest heights
and set the standards in a way that have

2032
01:27:35,331 --> 01:27:40,331
not been set before,
whether it's through comedy or music or 

2033
01:27:40,331 --> 01:27:40,331
radio or anything,
that person,

2034
01:27:40,331 --> 01:27:44,501
that fucking purse,
that pioneer way at the front of the 

2035
01:27:44,501 --> 01:27:44,840
line,
running through barriers,

2036
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:47,810
that guy's not going to be balanced 
because if it was balanced,

2037
01:27:47,811 --> 01:27:49,190
you wouldn't have the energy to get 
there.

2038
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:53,120
The way you have the energy to get there
is that you are imbalanced.

2039
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,460
So you've got to respect that man.
You know,

2040
01:27:55,461 --> 01:28:00,461
and then you have to grade things on a 
curve and you should judge people based 

2041
01:28:00,461 --> 01:28:04,751
on their accomplishments almost as much 
as you judge them based on their 

2042
01:28:04,751 --> 01:28:05,840
personality to personality is what's 
most important.

2043
01:28:05,841 --> 01:28:08,030
If you want to be around them for sure 
you know,

2044
01:28:08,031 --> 01:28:13,031
you don't want someone to around you 
that wants to be the king of the world 

2045
01:28:13,031 --> 01:28:13,190
and once you know all the conversations 
to be about him,

2046
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:18,370
but he got to realize that in order to 
start some giant mega corporation in 

2047
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:18,520
order to,
you know,

2048
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:22,460
to be the guy at the head of Halliburton
when you really have to be that guy.

2049
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:24,620
There's this,
it's not possible without.

2050
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:25,440
You can't,
it's not,

2051
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:26,870
not as.
You can't just,

2052
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:27,710
I,
you know,

2053
01:28:27,711 --> 01:28:30,440
I say that sometimes about nine.
None of this is really downplaying it,

2054
01:28:30,441 --> 01:28:35,441
but about standup in order to want to 
stand in front of a group of strangers 

2055
01:28:35,441 --> 01:28:36,440
for an hour and speak something fucked 
up with you.

2056
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,820
Dude.
I say it on stage.

2057
01:28:37,821 --> 01:28:40,790
I do a whole bit about it.
How ridiculous it is that here I am,

2058
01:28:40,791 --> 01:28:41,270
I'm saying,
well,

2059
01:28:41,271 --> 01:28:46,271
I want a job where I'm the only one who 
gets to talk for an hour in front of a 

2060
01:28:46,271 --> 01:28:47,270
bunch of people.
You're right there.

2061
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:48,950
You're right there.
This is not like the Internet.

2062
01:28:48,951 --> 01:28:51,890
Like right now we've isolated this 
situation where there's only three of us

2063
01:28:51,891 --> 01:28:53,330
in my office and we're hanging out 
talking,

2064
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:55,010
but when you're on stage,
man,

2065
01:28:55,050 --> 01:28:57,140
I'll do that shit in front of a thousand
people,

2066
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:02,620
2000 people,
even there's 2000 people in the 

2067
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:02,620
audience.
I'm talking and they don't give a shit.

2068
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:06,410
The weirdest scenario in the world is my
friends.

2069
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:09,860
I went out with a bunch of friends.
All my friends are single and Atlanta.

2070
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:14,020
Single and fucking rich as fuck.
Like these criminals.

2071
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:15,410
Do.
They know they own bars.

2072
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:20,530
Like my one buddy owns a bunch of bars 
called Tin Lizzy's because they owned 

2073
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:21,350
bars.
They're all just wealthy.

2074
01:29:21,351 --> 01:29:24,290
They're just single guys who have 
nothing but disposable income,

2075
01:29:24,291 --> 01:29:29,291
but what are there?
The reason why I'm asking that because 

2076
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:31,270
the reason why they're single.
A lot of people in the bar business or 

2077
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:31,270
fucking single.
Yeah,

2078
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:35,420
I know.
I think he got into the bar business 

2079
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:35,420
because he's single not.
You know what I mean?

2080
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:36,610
I don't think has any.
I don't think there's any.

2081
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,900
He wanted to make money,
but he also was like,

2082
01:29:38,901 --> 01:29:40,040
fuck,
it's a great way to meet chicks.

2083
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,550
He opened like one of the biggest parts 
of Atlanta back in like,

2084
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:47,580
like when email just started,
he owned a bar and he got everyone's 

2085
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:47,930
email addresses and so now he's locked 
down Atlanta.

2086
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:50,930
There was a dude who wrote a post on the
underground forum about

2087
01:29:50,990 --> 01:29:53,000
this chick that he dated that was in a 
bar.

2088
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:55,970
She was so she worked in a,
as a waitress in a bar and that over the

2089
01:29:55,970 --> 01:30:00,970
years he watched her change over the 
years of being in that environment and 

2090
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:04,201
constantly being around party pitbulls 
and constantly being around the light 

2091
01:30:04,201 --> 01:30:05,000
and the nightlife that he watched her 
change and I'm like,

2092
01:30:05,001 --> 01:30:10,001
man,
that is got to be one of the most 

2093
01:30:10,001 --> 01:30:10,001
depressing things in the world.
Do you being in love with a chick,

2094
01:30:10,001 --> 01:30:14,861
you're living with her and watching her 
change because she's around all these 

2095
01:30:14,991 --> 01:30:17,060
rich guys that are trying to stick their
dick under her.

2096
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,640
So every night they're dancing.
The Devil's dance.

2097
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,520
They got fucking fired,
redness,

2098
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:27,370
a Ferrari,
and after a while there,

2099
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:32,740
even though she loves her man,
there is a real resentment that builds 

2100
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:36,581
up.
Why can't the man that I love provided 

2101
01:30:36,581 --> 01:30:36,581
me with the Ferrari?

2102
01:30:36,581 --> 01:30:40,120
Why can't the man that I love giving me 
this House that this guy could give me 

2103
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:42,020
if I just took that evil Dick,
that dirty,

2104
01:30:42,021 --> 01:30:45,160
scaly,
scratchy for covered cock,

2105
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,160
like a little wolverine.
Dick's,

2106
01:30:49,161 --> 01:30:54,161
Dick's inside of just a monster man,
some fucking horrible person that just 

2107
01:30:54,471 --> 01:30:57,800
wants to get money and money and money 
dancing the dance,

2108
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,870
and every night she sees these guys 
dancing,

2109
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,550
dance,
throwing thousand dollars,

2110
01:31:01,551 --> 01:31:03,740
tips her way and she didn't.
Come on baby.

2111
01:31:03,741 --> 01:31:05,900
Any night I'll take you away from this.
You don't look at it.

2112
01:31:05,901 --> 01:31:08,120
I'm looking at settle down.
I'm looking to get out of this game.

2113
01:31:08,121 --> 01:31:10,280
Private jets.
I'm looking to get out of this game.

2114
01:31:10,281 --> 01:31:15,281
Yeah man.
This dudes that will show up at 

2115
01:31:15,281 --> 01:31:15,281
nightclubs especially,
you know Miami.

2116
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:21,340
Miami's a Goddamn joke.
This dude's flying in on private planes 

2117
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:23,390
from all over the world.
Just to be a baller in Miami.

2118
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,390
There's a few spots in the world where 
it's like,

2119
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:30,290
it's a clutch move to show up and be a 
baller,

2120
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:35,380
you know,
where people will fly in the super 

2121
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:35,870
elite,
ultra billionaire type characters that,

2122
01:31:35,871 --> 01:31:39,260
you know,
we'll fly in during conn and France.

2123
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:40,600
I want to be,
don't,

2124
01:31:40,601 --> 01:31:43,900
don't you kind of want to try it once,
but like just be,

2125
01:31:43,901 --> 01:31:46,450
I want to be the guy that rolls in on a 
private jet.

2126
01:31:46,630 --> 01:31:48,220
Like I was with my friends and I was 
watching them.

2127
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,720
They're all,
they're all,

2128
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:51,850
they're all fucking liquid.
No kids,

2129
01:31:51,851 --> 01:31:52,780
no nothing.
No.

2130
01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:56,260
Don't worry about anything and end this 
whole time I'm a news stand up.

2131
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:59,110
They've been spitting game of bitches.
So this,

2132
01:31:59,130 --> 01:31:59,420
this

2133
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:06,180
gentleman known as the urban influence.
Whole time I've been doing this comedy 

2134
01:32:06,461 --> 01:32:08,650
thing.
They've been spitting game at bitches.

2135
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:11,860
They're game is soul time.
You got married and had this whole time.

2136
01:32:11,861 --> 01:32:16,861
So like we all went out to the.
One of my buddies bars and Mike and I 

2137
01:32:16,861 --> 01:32:21,070
watched them operate with women in 
watching a pro on stage.

2138
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:22,180
Yeah.
But do you know what dude?

2139
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:24,610
That's all nonsense.
You know they have card tricks.

2140
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:26,710
You're Bert Kreischer.
You're a fucking comedian.

2141
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:32,040
You know what I'm saying?
Do you understand that they can't be 

2142
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:32,040
jealous and these guys are good at 
bullshitting.

2143
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,190
They have to bullshit.
All you have to do is go,

2144
01:32:33,191 --> 01:32:34,580
ladies,
I'm onstage.

2145
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:38,530
Where's the shot's cut?
Two or three hours later,

2146
01:32:38,531 --> 01:32:41,910
you hotel room,
one girl locked onto your balls like one

2147
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:45,730
of those land in the bottom of a shark 
and the other ones suck it on your shaft

2148
01:32:45,731 --> 01:32:50,731
and you squirt while you throw your arms
up in the air and victory right here.

2149
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:56,340
One of the girls go,
powerful burt Chrysler,

2150
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,110
Chrysler.
Yeah,

2151
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,790
exactly.
Fuck your friends in their bars.

2152
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,620
You're Bert Kreischer.
If you were single dude,

2153
01:33:02,621 --> 01:33:04,600
you'd be doing damage right now,
son.

2154
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:07,260
You would be doing.
Oh,

2155
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:09,570
you didn't have the little babies and 
the wife and the whole,

2156
01:33:09,571 --> 01:33:12,100
the whole package.
And he went out there and like the whole

2157
01:33:12,101 --> 01:33:12,530
pack.
Look,

2158
01:33:12,531 --> 01:33:15,540
I love the whole package so people don't
believe that I.

2159
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:16,960
You know,
you don't think that you would,

2160
01:33:16,961 --> 01:33:18,460
but you do.
It's like being.

2161
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:21,460
It's like,
it's like almost like being an alcoholic

2162
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:24,600
or a Christian,
but you can only connect.

2163
01:33:24,610 --> 01:33:28,010
Like I tried to tell my friends like how
great it is and they just don't see this

2164
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:28,980
guy.
I'm,

2165
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:29,620
I'm good.
I'm good.

2166
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,720
I'm good.
It's not for everybody.

2167
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:32,430
You know?
I,

2168
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:37,600
I used to hate when people who had kids 
would say that the only way to live a 

2169
01:33:37,851 --> 01:33:42,851
fulfilled life is to have children,
but I think that's preposterous and I 

2170
01:33:42,851 --> 01:33:42,851
still do.

2171
01:33:42,851 --> 01:33:44,870
Do you believe it's the only way to 
fucking.

2172
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,480
I haven't touched this one here.
Take this one.

2173
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:49,520
It's not the only way.
It's ridiculous.

2174
01:33:49,521 --> 01:33:52,790
Why don't you just suck on that before 
it spills all over my goddamn table.

2175
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,750
Son.
You got to.

2176
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:56,300
You're on your own iphone.
Their fellow.

2177
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:57,530
No,
this is yours.

2178
01:33:57,531 --> 01:33:59,270
I think crusher.
Sloppy drunk.

2179
01:33:59,690 --> 01:34:00,470
No,
I just,

2180
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:02,660
um,
you know what's so funny is my iphone.

2181
01:34:02,661 --> 01:34:05,210
You Fuck?
Igor taught me how to.

2182
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:08,570
What's a foreign bottle like that?
What's a fun off the side?

2183
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:10,360
That's where you going to tell me no 
ego.

2184
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:12,920
I told you that last week.
Didn't the side of the table.

2185
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:17,950
No beer bottle of beer bottle robin to 
get a Napkin.

2186
01:34:18,530 --> 01:34:19,670
Oh,
don't worry about it dude.

2187
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:22,510
Okay,
grab that towel off

2188
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:23,680
the wall.
Grab the towel.

2189
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:27,010
Just don't lose the blue angels photo.
That shit's important man.

2190
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:30,910
Best wishes from the blue angels.
February 22nd,

2191
01:34:30,911 --> 01:34:32,590
1999.
Folks.

2192
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:37,270
I flew in an f 18,
seven and a half g's.

2193
01:34:37,271 --> 01:34:38,500
I had a whole bit about it.
I did.

2194
01:34:38,501 --> 01:34:41,200
And one of my specials back in the 
design was true,

2195
01:34:41,201 --> 01:34:43,540
man.
I was incredible.

2196
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:45,970
You realize how fast those fucking 
things go.

2197
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:48,130
You can't even wrap your head around it,
man.

2198
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:49,910
Who we were.
Um,

2199
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,460
and these guys were started.
Man.

2200
01:34:51,461 --> 01:34:52,590
These fucking dudes.
Who are these,

2201
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:56,590
these fighter pilots.
I can't be over a certain height because

2202
01:34:56,591 --> 01:34:57,390
you have to,
uh,

2203
01:34:57,590 --> 01:35:00,110
maximize the amount of g force you can 
take.

2204
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:02,300
You should be short.
So you can do that.

2205
01:35:02,301 --> 01:35:07,301
The hooking thing where you hold onto 
the thing or just what the fuck that 

2206
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:08,290
what you're doing is as you're hitting 
that,

2207
01:35:08,291 --> 01:35:13,291
Geez,
you're doing what's called hooking and 

2208
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,641
you're holding onto the handle and to go
on this and what you're doing is forcing

2209
01:35:17,781 --> 01:35:22,781
blood into your brain because the 
pressure of the g force is literally 

2210
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:25,670
pushing the blood out of your brain.

2211
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:27,180
I think that would make me black out.

2212
01:35:27,370 --> 01:35:29,450
It course it was.
That's it does make you.

2213
01:35:29,451 --> 01:35:33,620
But will that keeps you alive under,
under normal conditions.

2214
01:35:33,621 --> 01:35:35,870
Maybe that would make you black enough.
I don't think it will,

2215
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:37,240
but the,
the,

2216
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:42,330
the pressure is with trying to get you 
to blackout and the hooking is what 

2217
01:35:42,330 --> 01:35:43,510
makes you stay alive.
And uh,

2218
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:46,520
we were um,
we were flying in his fucking fat and we

2219
01:35:46,521 --> 01:35:48,410
did some crazy drills.
Man,

2220
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,270
were we,
one time we hit,

2221
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:52,820
we went to,
we went to five and he goes,

2222
01:35:52,821 --> 01:35:55,890
you cool with five?
I can handle five and went to six.

2223
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:56,780
You know,
you're cool with sex.

2224
01:35:56,781 --> 01:35:57,380
I go,
I did it.

2225
01:35:57,381 --> 01:35:58,060
I did.
I did it.

2226
01:35:58,340 --> 01:35:58,720
He's like,
Oh,

2227
01:35:58,721 --> 01:35:59,990
I'm going to take this up.
I'm gonna take this out,

2228
01:35:59,991 --> 01:36:02,810
and we went to seven and a half g's,
but he was hooking to.

2229
01:36:02,811 --> 01:36:04,930
That's what it was freaky to.
He was going through this.

2230
01:36:06,150 --> 01:36:11,150
Then you could.
You could see consciousness like an 

2231
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:14,530
elevator door.
You could see there was darkness on 

2232
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:14,530
either side

2233
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:14,530
side.
Getting choked out.

2234
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:14,820
Yeah,
exactly.

2235
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:17,970
He's choked me out.
That fucking freaked me out.

2236
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:21,480
You watch it go close and then it's 
almost like you're dancing.

2237
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:22,840
You're head's on the.
You're.

2238
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:27,870
You're buried.
Your body's buried your head bay and 

2239
01:36:27,870 --> 01:36:29,841
you're dancing.
There's a whole world underneath you to 

2240
01:36:29,841 --> 01:36:29,841
stairs that go down and then you got 
them back up and you're like,

2241
01:36:29,841 --> 01:36:30,240
Hey,
what happened?

2242
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:35,280
Well,
you get a little tiny dose of 

2243
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:35,280
psychedelic is what happens when you get
choked out.

2244
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,180
You have little dreams.
Have Weird things.

2245
01:36:37,181 --> 01:36:37,660
Yeah,
yeah,

2246
01:36:37,661 --> 01:36:37,960
yeah.

2247
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:39,110
Have you ever been choked out?
No.

2248
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:40,430
Check yourself.
Never been choked.

2249
01:36:40,431 --> 01:36:41,860
Unconscious Joe.
No.

2250
01:36:41,861 --> 01:36:43,370
Never told me to do it too.
You know,

2251
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,430
I've done it lot.
It's a tap.

2252
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:48,770
I'm not stupid.
I know when I'm going out,

2253
01:36:48,830 --> 01:36:50,060
when I'm going out,
I just tapped.

2254
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:51,650
But it could happen.
It could happen tonight.

2255
01:36:51,651 --> 01:36:56,651
I'm going to class tonight.
I get choked unconscious tonight and 

2256
01:36:56,651 --> 01:36:56,651
happens all the time.
Oh Man.

2257
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,120
He ain't get choked out or.
Yeah,

2258
01:36:58,121 --> 01:36:58,550
let's.
Yeah,

2259
01:36:58,551 --> 01:36:59,870
let's do that.
You should do Jujitsu,

2260
01:36:59,871 --> 01:37:01,280
man.
I've been thinking about it.

2261
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:06,340
Fuck yeah man.
A lot of my head of one of my friends 

2262
01:37:06,361 --> 01:37:11,361
who got the the laughing skull and 
Atlanta's is massively into Jujitsu and 

2263
01:37:11,361 --> 01:37:11,361
he's like,
you know,

2264
01:37:11,361 --> 01:37:13,760
it calms me down a,
a lot of energy and angry energy.

2265
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:19,030
And he goes,
the other day a guy got really pissed 

2266
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:19,030
about his bar tab at the club and he got
my face and he's like,

2267
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:19,790
I just didn't like.

2268
01:37:19,970 --> 01:37:21,710
There was no anger towards him.
I was just like,

2269
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:24,260
listen man,
we're fine.

2270
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:24,990
You know,
like he,

2271
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:26,690
he's like,
it centered me.

2272
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,600
I've been thinking about it.
My problem is I'm not around anywhere.

2273
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:31,350
I don't know it on the road.
I'd be,

2274
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,530
I'd be at the brand new.
I'd be the fucking punching bag.

2275
01:37:33,570 --> 01:37:34,190
Every.
Yeah.

2276
01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:36,170
Every day.
Yeah.

2277
01:37:36,171 --> 01:37:38,150
It's good for you.
Good for you to get your ass kicked.

2278
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:39,440
Really?
Yeah.

2279
01:37:39,441 --> 01:37:41,010
It's good for you to know how easy it is
for man.

2280
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,010
Kick your ass to eyes,
good for you,

2281
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,980
good for you to get destroyed,
as good for you to get mounted.

2282
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:51,440
Triangle choked and shit.
It's good because you realize how easy 

2283
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:54,441
it is for someone to do that to you 
because most people have no idea they 

2284
01:37:54,441 --> 01:37:56,030
walked through this world.
Having no idea how

2285
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:01,100
summer Marcello Garcia character could 
just fucking take your life anytime he 

2286
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,520
wanted to and not just take your life.
How about this?

2287
01:38:02,521 --> 01:38:04,710
How about taking my life?
What I've been doing Jujitsu,

2288
01:38:04,711 --> 01:38:09,711
for instance,
96 and that little dude from Brazil get 

2289
01:38:09,711 --> 01:38:12,720
struggled the fuck out of me one day he 
wants and that's a reality and I'm 

2290
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,730
almost a black belt.
I'm like high level and there's a lot of

2291
01:38:14,731 --> 01:38:16,980
people have choked out.
I can choke out some good people,

2292
01:38:16,981 --> 01:38:21,981
man,
and that guy could just tap me anytime 

2293
01:38:21,981 --> 01:38:24,261
he wants.
So for me to be like almost a black 

2294
01:38:24,261 --> 01:38:25,140
belt,
I might as well have never done Jujitsu.

2295
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:27,990
I'll just be able to hold them off for a
little is gonna get me.

2296
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:32,160
It's inevitable that that's the kind of 
reality that exists for most people.

2297
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:37,250
If you know Jujitsu for most people,
if you're in some sort of a street 

2298
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:37,410
altercation with someone and you get a 
hold of them,

2299
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:39,030
that's why you have to do so.

2300
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:40,740
I have to do hang on because you know 
what?

2301
01:38:40,741 --> 01:38:43,830
In class in class,
you're going 100 percent,

2302
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,500
100 percent.
Yeah.

2303
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:47,160
You know why?
Because you don't hit each other.

2304
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:49,560
You're trying to choke and grappling and
grappling.

2305
01:38:49,561 --> 01:38:51,530
You're allowed to go 100 percent.
Doesn't mean you heard it.

2306
01:38:51,531 --> 01:38:52,470
Your,
your partners.

2307
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:54,430
If you have a lock,
if you have a choke you,

2308
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:56,880
you put it to a certain position and you
can just hold it and let it go,

2309
01:38:57,030 --> 01:39:02,030
but the point is it takes 100 percent of
your effort to get to that position and 

2310
01:39:02,030 --> 01:39:02,910
that's exactly what's going to come up 
in a fight and a fight.

2311
01:39:02,911 --> 01:39:07,911
It's going to be 100 percent effort 
except you're used to doing 100 percent 

2312
01:39:07,911 --> 01:39:08,280
effort three,
four nights a week,

2313
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:09,570
three,
four nights a week.

2314
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:14,930
I go in,
there's grown men and they're going to 

2315
01:39:14,930 --> 01:39:17,151
try to kill me with their bare hands and
I'm going to try to kill them and then 

2316
01:39:17,151 --> 01:39:17,151
we're going to slap hands and we hugged 
and I said,

2317
01:39:17,151 --> 01:39:20,130
thanks brother,
and we move onto the next guy and you go

2318
01:39:20,131 --> 01:39:21,300
to the next one.
The next one,

2319
01:39:21,301 --> 01:39:24,420
he's tap hands you.
You go at your slap hands and said,

2320
01:39:24,421 --> 01:39:27,360
everybody does and any lockup and this 
is the goal.

2321
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:32,361
I'm going to try to get you to tap and 
what you're saying when you tap is you 

2322
01:39:32,361 --> 01:39:32,550
could have just killed me and then 
you're gonna.

2323
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:34,360
Try to do the same thing to me and if 
you get me,

2324
01:39:34,361 --> 01:39:36,600
it's something I'm going to have to tap 
and I'm not going to want to,

2325
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:38,040
but I'm going to have to because very 
important.

2326
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:38,670
You don't want to die.

2327
01:39:38,930 --> 01:39:42,640
I thought opportunity right there,
just do it.

2328
01:39:42,650 --> 01:39:44,860
Hence Hensville.
Henzel gracie.

2329
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:49,890
Benzos told me he was like,
come on out to the the place and I will 

2330
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:51,670
see,
will teach you Jujitsu.

2331
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:52,810
Sure.
Why don't you do it.

2332
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:54,790
I was like,
I know.

2333
01:39:54,791 --> 01:39:56,470
After I did the thing I said that was 
really cool.

2334
01:39:56,471 --> 01:40:01,471
I felt really grounded when I got dunks.
I got beaten up a couple times and once 

2335
01:40:01,471 --> 01:40:01,900
you get your ass beat,
but you know it's not.

2336
01:40:01,901 --> 01:40:06,901
There's no malice and you don't have to 
go home to your little sister and she 

2337
01:40:06,901 --> 01:40:06,901
looks at you and goes what happened?
And you're like,

2338
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:07,410
like

2339
01:40:07,550 --> 01:40:12,550
it's a game.
And the game is using your body to 

2340
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:13,130
dominate another person's body with 
technique and leverage.

2341
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:18,200
I want to do it.
I want to do it because there I have so 

2342
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:20,721
many anxieties of just k.
it's the reason I want to get a fucking 

2343
01:40:20,721 --> 01:40:23,991
massive dog.
It's the reason I want to fucking live 

2344
01:40:23,991 --> 01:40:23,991
in Montana.
The reason I want to buy a shotgun,

2345
01:40:23,991 --> 01:40:23,991
every.
Everything.

2346
01:40:23,991 --> 01:40:25,770
I'm in Iowa,
it's like I just,

2347
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:27,210
the reason I drink on planes,
it's,

2348
01:40:27,211 --> 01:40:28,870
I just,
I'm afraid like,

2349
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:31,770
like you're afraid of a fight on a 
plane.

2350
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:32,670
Uh,
today.

2351
01:40:32,671 --> 01:40:36,570
Yeah.
Fucking guy.

2352
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,800
How many,
by the way before we get started,

2353
01:40:40,830 --> 01:40:44,730
how many fucking fight stories I've ever
been started by this fucking thing?

2354
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:49,820
Got that statement.
So fucking things that like what you got

2355
01:40:53,921 --> 01:40:57,490
in a fight to fucking guy like that 
statement.

2356
01:40:57,491 --> 01:41:00,430
This fucking guy is probably number one.
All time.

2357
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,710
Maybe the most appearances ever.
Fox Story.

2358
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:08,820
Start this fucking guy.
This guy had his jumpsuit on.

2359
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:13,240
He had two jackets on,
right?

2360
01:41:13,241 --> 01:41:15,640
So I'm watching him and then,
uh,

2361
01:41:16,050 --> 01:41:21,050
and he kept going to the bathroom.
He went to the bathroom like five times 

2362
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:21,070
while I went.
Once I kept watching him,

2363
01:41:21,071 --> 01:41:22,480
I was like,
what the fuck she doing in the bathroom?

2364
01:41:23,490 --> 01:41:28,490
So then I go in and after it goes in,
like the fifth time I go into and it 

2365
01:41:28,490 --> 01:41:29,620
smells like Bengay,
like really fucking,

2366
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:30,820
like really,
uh,

2367
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:34,240
intense and I go and then I'd watch them
going like five more times.

2368
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:35,890
And the one time he goes to the 
bathroom,

2369
01:41:35,891 --> 01:41:37,660
I just walk up and I look at him and I 
go,

2370
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:39,190
what are you doing in the bathroom?

2371
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:44,430
And the guy was like,
so you're on top of this guy's bathroom 

2372
01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:44,430
shit.
Fuck you.

2373
01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:45,200
Where you like,
you think you're a cop of deodorant?

2374
01:41:45,201 --> 01:41:45,970
I don't.
You know what?

2375
01:41:45,971 --> 01:41:48,970
Here's the thing is I don't,
I don't know what he thought I was.

2376
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:50,800
It wasn't deodorant.
I realized,

2377
01:41:50,801 --> 01:41:55,801
I think I realized what it was.
I think he was smoking something a 

2378
01:41:55,801 --> 01:41:58,390
cigarette or those or the fake 
cigarettes.

2379
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:01,810
Electronic cigarettes cause it,
it smelled like,

2380
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:04,660
like menthol in the back of exactly what
he's figured it out.

2381
01:42:04,661 --> 01:42:06,550
But when I said,
what are you doing in there?

2382
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:08,230
He.
He was like,

2383
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:08,760
oh no,
no,

2384
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:10,540
I'm gonna go to the bathroom and went 
okay.

2385
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,400
But I didn't want.
I didn't know if he knew who I was,

2386
01:42:12,401 --> 01:42:14,590
but I was thinking if I could have 
fucking fight this guy.

2387
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:15,940
I was like,
how's this going down?

2388
01:42:15,941 --> 01:42:17,540
He might've thought that you were like,
oh,

2389
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,750
martial arts.
Exactly what I was thinking.

2390
01:42:19,751 --> 01:42:24,751
I was like,
I don't want them to think anything 

2391
01:42:24,751 --> 01:42:24,751
because I'm like the least suspecting 
Air Marshall.

2392
01:42:24,751 --> 01:42:26,690
I just want him to know.
He told me.

2393
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:35,170
He just gave us crazy eyes,
but he told me he wants to go and then I

2394
01:42:35,171 --> 01:42:40,171
realized he was smoking one of those 
cigarettes in there probably it was 

2395
01:42:40,171 --> 01:42:42,750
sketches of sketchy and he had like,
and here's what the way my crazy brain 

2396
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:45,970
thinks is he had those eyepatch patches 
that you put on to sleep on a plane.

2397
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:49,240
He had those like on his head,
like a pair of sunglasses like up here.

2398
01:42:49,241 --> 01:42:54,241
And I was like,
in my head I start going crazy and I'm 

2399
01:42:54,241 --> 01:42:54,241
like,
he's a,

2400
01:42:54,241 --> 01:42:54,460
he's a fucking,
it's a plant.

2401
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:59,640
He's got those because they told him and
terrorists class who make it look like 

2402
01:42:59,640 --> 01:42:59,640
you're going to take a nap.
Like,

2403
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:01,240
no,
this guy get the neck thing.

2404
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:02,710
Oh,
I'm not going to blow up the plane.

2405
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:07,890
So I just kept walking.
So you're really paranoid enough to 

2406
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:07,890
think that people are.

2407
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:09,040
You're watching people's bathroom 
behavior or something.

2408
01:43:09,070 --> 01:43:14,070
Have you ever thought it's just like 
knocking yourself out and sleeping the 

2409
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:16,531
whole time.
Like that's what I wanted them to take 

2410
01:43:16,531 --> 01:43:16,531
the laptop to watch a movie on your 
account.

2411
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:21,180
I definitely listened to the podcast 
with you and a Ra.

2412
01:43:21,330 --> 01:43:23,590
Do you write on planes over?
Who are you?

2413
01:43:23,591 --> 01:43:25,210
That guy that stands up in the middle of
the island.

2414
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:27,880
It looks at everybody acts like they're 
getting something out of the front,

2415
01:43:27,881 --> 01:43:29,500
but then you're just checking everybody 
out like,

2416
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:30,060
no,
no,

2417
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:32,170
this today was a special occasion.
I know.

2418
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:37,200
Normally freak out on planes.
Today was a special occasion because he 

2419
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:37,450
was going to the bathroom so much.
I went,

2420
01:43:37,451 --> 01:43:38,770
something's going on the fucking 
bathroom.

2421
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:40,330
Like I was just in my head.
I was like,

2422
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:45,360
he's fucking dude.
There's something going on in the 

2423
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:45,360
bathroom and I'm the only person that 
noticing.

2424
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:45,460
He went to the.
When he was smoking a cigarette,

2425
01:43:45,670 --> 01:43:47,290
that's what he was doing.
He was smoking with a cigarette.

2426
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:48,760
Can you can't ride on a plane?
You said?

2427
01:43:48,761 --> 01:43:50,170
No,
because I'm.

2428
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,660
I'm a fucking mess.
I can't.

2429
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:57,270
I want.
If you're listening to this and you can 

2430
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:57,270
fucking fix my flying,
you fucking do it.

2431
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:58,010
I hate it.
I hate that.

2432
01:43:58,011 --> 01:44:03,011
I.
I can't listen to your podcast when you 

2433
01:44:03,011 --> 01:44:03,011
do them on planes.
Really fucking give me a call.

2434
01:44:03,011 --> 01:44:05,200
I have another one I have to give you.
We did a 20 minute when me and Joey,

2435
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:07,450
so there's a bonus bonus footage coming 
ladies,

2436
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:08,320
Joan,
but I can't.

2437
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:11,470
I can't listen to them.
Like even just gives me anxiety.

2438
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:13,330
You guys give me anxiety.
I don't know man.

2439
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:15,730
I wish I could figure it out because 
we're on a plane and you're going to put

2440
01:44:15,731 --> 01:44:16,780
all this sudden.
I'm telling them no,

2441
01:44:16,781 --> 01:44:17,110
no,
no.

2442
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,300
If I want to play,
I'll never fucking listen to that one.

2443
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:22,200
Want to noise reduction?
Apple plain bucket.

2444
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:30,440
Eavesdropping on you and Tom Behind me.
Now he can't even listen to you on a 

2445
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:31,950
plane at home.
Like if I can't listen to it,

2446
01:44:32,190 --> 01:44:33,610
it gives me anxiety.
Wow.

2447
01:44:33,611 --> 01:44:35,860
When you're at home and you listen to 
our podcast on the planet,

2448
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:36,610
me,
anxiety me.

2449
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:38,660
Am I the first guy to do podcasts?
And I'm playing.

2450
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:44,640
That'd be awesome.
If I were you molested by a plane as a 

2451
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:44,840
young child.
No question.

2452
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:47,680
My first lesson on my first plane trip 
ever,

2453
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:48,600
my dad is uh,
my,

2454
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:53,660
my dad is a great man,
but he was not prepared to have you say 

2455
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:58,670
my dad is a great man,
but soft things,

2456
01:44:58,690 --> 01:45:00,630
there's a list of them things that he,
uh,

2457
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:05,220
that he did did as a parent that maybe I
wouldn't have done.

2458
01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:10,490
Like number one.
Like I remember when I was in first 

2459
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:10,490
grade,
I came home,

2460
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:10,490
I was real problems.

2461
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:10,830
Like Dad,
I'm the fastest kid in my class.

2462
01:45:10,831 --> 01:45:11,280
And he was like,
well,

2463
01:45:11,281 --> 01:45:12,630
you're not faster than me.
I was like,

2464
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:13,950
Dad,
I'm pretty fucking fast.

2465
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:15,240
I didn't say fuck,
but I was like,

2466
01:45:15,241 --> 01:45:16,240
I'm pretty fast.
And he was like,

2467
01:45:16,290 --> 01:45:17,250
really?
I was like,

2468
01:45:17,251 --> 01:45:17,550
yeah.
He goes,

2469
01:45:17,551 --> 01:45:18,720
let's go outside and race.
I said,

2470
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:20,220
alright.
So we got outside,

2471
01:45:20,221 --> 01:45:25,221
I pull my knee socks up to my knees,
I get my little startup position that 

2472
01:45:25,221 --> 01:45:27,180
almost went to the Olympics for track.
So we go and he's like on your mark,

2473
01:45:27,181 --> 01:45:29,850
get set,
go and I take off and I got the lead and

2474
01:45:29,851 --> 01:45:31,980
all of a sudden he blows by me and he's 
running backwards.

2475
01:45:31,981 --> 01:45:33,090
He's like,
looks at me,

2476
01:45:33,091 --> 01:45:38,091
and he goes,
you'll never beat me at anything like 

2477
01:45:38,091 --> 01:45:39,420
fucking first grade dad.
So when I took my,

2478
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:42,480
I took a plane flight to Pennsylvania.
I remember,

2479
01:45:42,540 --> 01:45:45,150
uh,
the catcher for the,

2480
01:45:46,110 --> 01:45:47,550
uh,
for the Yankees,

2481
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:49,110
uh,
was named,

2482
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:50,850
um,
Shit.

2483
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:55,850
It's escaping me,
but he died in a plane crash and I 

2484
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:55,850
remember saying to them,
a god,

2485
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:57,750
I can't believe he.
He died in a plane crash.

2486
01:45:57,780 --> 01:45:58,770
And my dad goes,
yeah,

2487
01:45:59,280 --> 01:45:59,880
like,
what was it,

2488
01:45:59,881 --> 01:46:04,881
like a special plane flight?
I was a kid and taking my first plane 

2489
01:46:04,881 --> 01:46:04,881
flight.
And he goes,

2490
01:46:04,881 --> 01:46:04,881
nope.
Sometimes planes go down.

2491
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:06,870
And I was like,
like the one I go on.

2492
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:07,270
And he goes,
yeah,

2493
01:46:07,271 --> 01:46:08,490
let's go.
They go down.

2494
01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:10,560
I was like,
Oh fuck.

2495
01:46:10,590 --> 01:46:13,440
And then I got on the plane and we 
started taking off and I looked at my,

2496
01:46:13,570 --> 01:46:16,380
my dad was on the plane with me and my 
mom and my sister were taken off.

2497
01:46:16,381 --> 01:46:18,210
I remember looking at my mom growing,
we're high enough right now,

2498
01:46:18,211 --> 01:46:20,450
I don't want to this.
And then he kept going and go,

2499
01:46:20,470 --> 01:46:22,530
stop going higher.
I start yelling.

2500
01:46:22,531 --> 01:46:23,160
How old were you?

2501
01:46:23,190 --> 01:46:25,500
Like fucking probably,
I want to say first grade,

2502
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:27,990
first grade.
I had like a number of traumatic things.

2503
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:29,850
I watched the dude light himself on 
fire.

2504
01:46:30,310 --> 01:46:32,100
Yeah.
Fuck yes.

2505
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:36,030
This kid John,
my end with the crazy part of this is my

2506
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:41,060
uncle John was staying with us.
This kid John took me and corky gains 

2507
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:42,120
down the street.
It was like a redneck neighborhood.

2508
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,400
And he goes,
uh,

2509
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:45,480
you guys want to see a magic trick?
And we're like,

2510
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:46,410
hey.
So he goes,

2511
01:46:46,411 --> 01:46:49,020
watch this.
So he dips a leaf in a,

2512
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:49,850
in a,
uh,

2513
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:54,950
in a butter jar,
butter tub of solution and then light 

2514
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:58,941
sitting in lights on fire.
The butter thing is obviously gasoline 

2515
01:46:58,941 --> 01:46:58,941
going like,
wow,

2516
01:46:58,941 --> 01:46:58,941
that's amazing.
And he was,

2517
01:46:58,941 --> 01:47:03,290
I can do it again.
And so he did it again when I go and he 

2518
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:03,290
goes,
watch this.

2519
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:06,381
And He poured a little bit and he lit it
and then the thing exploded and they 

2520
01:47:06,381 --> 01:47:08,550
caught him on fire and he went like,
so I go taking off,

2521
01:47:08,551 --> 01:47:11,520
running to my house and I run into my 
house screaming.

2522
01:47:11,521 --> 01:47:13,860
John's on fire.
John's on fire.

2523
01:47:13,861 --> 01:47:16,530
My uncle John is sleeping on the couch 
thinking he's on fire.

2524
01:47:16,531 --> 01:47:21,531
He's like pissed all over the couch,
but I saw that happen and it fucking 

2525
01:47:21,531 --> 01:47:23,430
traumatized me.
What happened to the kid?

2526
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:25,540
Quirky gains.
Oh,

2527
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:28,380
quirky games rolled in dog shit like two
days later.

2528
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:32,100
But John John,
he has pants.

2529
01:47:32,210 --> 01:47:34,220
My mom came down and my mom was like,

2530
01:47:34,570 --> 01:47:37,470
okay.
And he was like two days late.

2531
01:47:37,471 --> 01:47:40,530
It seems like crazy by the way.
Crazy right now is drunk.

2532
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:41,880
No,
I'm not drunk.

2533
01:47:41,881 --> 01:47:42,930
I'm stone.
So many drinks.

2534
01:47:42,931 --> 01:47:46,980
Have you had your not stone sober?
You've had at least three beers.

2535
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:49,220
Three Beers.
Joe,

2536
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:53,360
do you think your stone sober?
I Bet I could do a field sobriety test.

2537
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:54,730
Oh,
field sobriety.

2538
01:47:54,731 --> 01:47:59,731
You blow into a breathalyzer sign.
You're got to be locked up in the pokey 

2539
01:47:59,731 --> 01:48:00,340
government.
Drunk is little bit different things.

2540
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:02,160
Your government drunk.
Well,

2541
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:02,700
let's.
Okay,

2542
01:48:02,701 --> 01:48:04,470
let's be fair right now.
We're all.

2543
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:05,760
Jeremiah started drinking

2544
01:48:05,870 --> 01:48:09,730
at eight in the morning.
Cal earn or east coast?

2545
01:48:09,970 --> 01:48:11,530
Yeah.
We just won the moment.

2546
01:48:11,531 --> 01:48:13,720
You talked about that other dude,
Roland and dog shit.

2547
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,930
Oh,
I thought you were asking what?

2548
01:48:16,931 --> 01:48:19,480
I'm going to coordinate gains.
So you saw a guy get lit on fire,

2549
01:48:19,481 --> 01:48:21,400
but nothing happened to him.
He's his pants.

2550
01:48:21,610 --> 01:48:22,690
His pants were on fire.
My mom,

2551
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:23,190
that's it.

2552
01:48:24,730 --> 01:48:25,300
Are you kidding?
He's like,

2553
01:48:25,450 --> 01:48:25,820
yeah,
yeah.

2554
01:48:25,850 --> 01:48:26,740
He was crying.
He was like,

2555
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,390
I'm fine.
I'm upon nothing happened.

2556
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,340
Don't tell my mom,
and then we just went home.

2557
01:48:30,341 --> 01:48:32,170
I never really hung out with that kid 
ever again.

2558
01:48:32,730 --> 01:48:33,980
Wow.
I had a bunch

2559
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:37,880
of traumatic shit.
Dude,

2560
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:43,090
that ain't that big a deal,
but do you ever look at got lit on fire 

2561
01:48:43,090 --> 01:48:47,321
and didn't even get hurt?
Fuck that guy guys to enroll you into a 

2562
01:48:48,351 --> 01:48:53,351
judo class.
Now that I'm saying that I'm hearing 

2563
01:48:53,351 --> 01:48:53,890
what I'm saying,
real hardships in childhood.

2564
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:01,400
I saw my dad beat the fuck out of my 
mother because she brought home 

2565
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:01,400
hamburger.
Are you serious?

2566
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:06,550
Beat the fuck out of her.
Does that ever creep up in your foster 

2567
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:07,940
with an open hand?
Is Palm strike during the face?

2568
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:10,670
Knocked her down.
Blood was coming out of her nose.

2569
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:16,480
Screamed at,
or do you ever buy extra hamburger when 

2570
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:19,361
you're at the store?
Because it never stopped me from 

2571
01:49:19,361 --> 01:49:20,660
enjoying the hamburgers.
I didn't allow it to.

2572
01:49:20,661 --> 01:49:22,640
I fought through it,
but that's nothing.

2573
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:24,740
No,
I just had a Douche bag for a dad.

2574
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:25,980
That's nothing.
You know,

2575
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,220
there's people that have had real shit 
happened to them.

2576
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:34,090
A few real things happening.
That was nothing that got lit his pants 

2577
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:35,270
on fire a little posy.
My Shit's not real.

2578
01:49:35,271 --> 01:49:40,271
Now that you tell your story,
not the worst thing,

2579
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:43,860
you just need more dramatic shift in 
your life to think about.

2580
01:49:43,861 --> 01:49:46,470
So you wouldn't think about little shit.
No lifting.

2581
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:48,010
Where a martial art

2582
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,190
comes into place,
martial arts is so difficult and so hard

2583
01:49:51,191 --> 01:49:56,191
to do and you get nervous before every 
class that it literally allows you to 

2584
01:49:56,191 --> 01:49:58,000
look at other things as like their 
minor.

2585
01:49:58,001 --> 01:50:00,100
Now you control these.
They're nothing.

2586
01:50:00,101 --> 01:50:02,050
They're not that big a deal.
Like a lot of people,

2587
01:50:02,051 --> 01:50:04,930
they break a bone or something like that
and it's like a really traumatic thing.

2588
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:07,060
I haven't had like a gang of surgeries 
do it.

2589
01:50:07,061 --> 01:50:10,240
I've had my nose fixed.
Both my knees fixed.

2590
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:12,100
It's,
I've got a lot of shit done,

2591
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:17,280
you know,
because things are always breaking 

2592
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:18,811
because you're getting them Yankton,
twisted and torked and but because you 

2593
01:50:18,811 --> 01:50:23,251
get used to that,
you have a higher threshold for 

2594
01:50:23,251 --> 01:50:24,400
uncomfort,
a higher threshold for,

2595
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:26,690
for dealing with traumatic situation.

2596
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:29,100
So you think ultimately if I started 
getting into Jujitsu,

2597
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:31,100
my fear of flying would disappear.
Yes,

2598
01:50:31,110 --> 01:50:34,710
because I would be feeling fear of 
flying is your fear of everything

2599
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:38,470
got connected and your fear of getting 
mounted by another man.

2600
01:50:38,471 --> 01:50:41,200
We tried to choke you unconscious.
You're going to get past that.

2601
01:50:41,201 --> 01:50:46,201
As you get past that,
you'll get better at this whole flying 

2602
01:50:46,201 --> 01:50:46,201
thing too.
That's what I believe.

2603
01:50:46,201 --> 01:50:50,580
It's a vehicle.
All martial arts are vehicles for your 

2604
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:54,030
human potential.
If you're not trying to be a 

2605
01:50:54,030 --> 01:50:55,681
professional fighter,
they're trying to advance your human 

2606
01:50:55,681 --> 01:50:55,681
potential.
I mean,

2607
01:50:55,681 --> 01:50:55,681
it's nice to have something to defend 
yourself,

2608
01:50:55,681 --> 01:51:00,631
but just get rich and hires and 
bodyguards if that's all you're looking 

2609
01:51:00,631 --> 01:51:00,631
for,
you know,

2610
01:51:00,631 --> 01:51:04,960
but,
but per personal sovereignty for your 

2611
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,610
ability to be able to push your body to 
a certain limit past that,

2612
01:51:06,611 --> 01:51:09,610
limit past the limit of what you thought
you were capable of,

2613
01:51:10,070 --> 01:51:11,800
that's all shit as you chug

2614
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:17,140
the capable of that.
But if you ever look at the ratio of 

2615
01:51:19,490 --> 01:51:22,610
people that died in plane accidents,
like car,

2616
01:51:22,611 --> 01:51:27,611
I don't have a fucking plan look ratio.
People that jump out of planes and die 

2617
01:51:27,611 --> 01:51:29,210
is so uncomfortably I,
oh,

2618
01:51:29,211 --> 01:51:34,211
it's like 70 people a year.
There's only a few people like really 

2619
01:51:34,211 --> 01:51:35,290
high.
And that was fucking panic.

2620
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:37,460
Did you get to touch Rachel?
Rachel Ray,

2621
01:51:37,461 --> 01:51:42,461
right?
You get to touch her boobs on the way 

2622
01:51:42,461 --> 01:51:42,461
down or anything.
I fucking freaked her out.

2623
01:51:42,461 --> 01:51:43,950
Imagine if you died and at the moment 
you die.

2624
01:51:43,951 --> 01:51:48,951
The moment you both,
neither one of your parachute's hit the 

2625
01:51:48,951 --> 01:51:49,020
ground or neither one of your 
parachute's expand.

2626
01:51:49,290 --> 01:51:54,290
You both hit the ground screaming and as
on impact,

2627
01:51:54,810 --> 01:51:58,170
you immediately burst into another 
dimension both completely naked,

2628
01:51:58,171 --> 01:52:01,520
floating in space and you're banging 
Rachel Ray.

2629
01:52:01,530 --> 01:52:03,110
Yeah.
From behind that,

2630
01:52:03,111 --> 01:52:08,111
and then it's pure ecstasy.
It's like you're on ecstasy and Viagra 

2631
01:52:08,111 --> 01:52:12,321
and and and almost pot to maybe even 
mushrooms and your banging Rachel Ray 

2632
01:52:12,321 --> 01:52:15,030
floating through space way.
He imagined that that's what death.

2633
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:17,700
I would love to Bang Rachael Ray and 
heaven and you're like,

2634
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:19,080
and you're like,
God dammit.

2635
01:52:19,110 --> 01:52:21,540
I was scared of this.
I was scared of this.

2636
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:22,980
I Love Rachel Ray.
Oh,

2637
01:52:22,981 --> 01:52:27,290
I see what you're saying.
As you hit the ground is awesome.

2638
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:30,030
Hot on the network.
That's a great rate statement.

2639
01:52:30,031 --> 01:52:30,720
When you said,
Oh,

2640
01:52:30,721 --> 01:52:32,400
I see what you're saying.
The fuck you did.

2641
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:39,840
Russian Shaker network.
That's really sexy.

2642
01:52:39,860 --> 01:52:42,770
Which is that her name?
Her.

2643
01:52:45,150 --> 01:52:49,240
So sorry.
Hot.

2644
01:52:52,830 --> 01:52:53,900
So I walked up.
I,

2645
01:52:53,901 --> 01:52:56,180
we were in A.
I'm in the admiral's Club at,

2646
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:01,560
at lax and I see her and she works for 
food network and that's like how he 

2647
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:05,741
throws it in there or not.
I was at lax and I saw he was in the 

2648
01:53:05,741 --> 01:53:09,491
admiral's club,
was the first class lounge I was flying 

2649
01:53:09,621 --> 01:53:14,270
to do letterman and I saw her and now 
we're both,

2650
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:15,890
uh,
owned by scripts,

2651
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:20,920
both our networks and so I said that I 
see her but I've been drinking because 

2652
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:24,821
I'm about to fly and I just,
and our flights being delayed and 

2653
01:53:24,821 --> 01:53:25,580
everyone's kind of sitting around and I 
just looked at her and I go,

2654
01:53:25,990 --> 01:53:27,920
um,
we're owned by the same people.

2655
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:33,610
She has no idea who the fuck I am.
I'm just saying we're owned by the same 

2656
01:53:33,610 --> 01:53:33,610
people.
And she said,

2657
01:53:33,610 --> 01:53:34,370
excuse me.
I'm like,

2658
01:53:34,670 --> 01:53:36,660
I go like,
look at it.

2659
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:37,440
I go on Bertha car,

2660
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:44,960
no,
my birthday because I'm drunk and I'm 

2661
01:53:47,041 --> 01:53:52,041
trying to relate to God.
Give me one of those.

2662
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:55,810
She goes,

2663
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:57,630
she goes,
I'm sorry.

2664
01:53:57,631 --> 01:53:58,410
And I go,
I go,

2665
01:53:58,411 --> 01:54:00,720
I'm on travel channel.
I'm on travel channel.

2666
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:02,220
And she goes,
yeah,

2667
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:03,590
and then.
And she,

2668
01:54:03,591 --> 01:54:04,230
yeah.
She's like,

2669
01:54:04,290 --> 01:54:04,590
are you?
Yeah,

2670
01:54:04,591 --> 01:54:06,830
I'm on travel channel.
Did you're on food network?

2671
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:07,770
She goes,
what do you mean?

2672
01:54:07,771 --> 01:54:09,750
I go script scripts onto both of us.
She goes,

2673
01:54:10,230 --> 01:54:11,430
they don't own me,
and I was like,

2674
01:54:11,431 --> 01:54:16,431
no,
I meant like they own our networks and 

2675
01:54:16,431 --> 01:54:16,431
we're on the.
I got,

2676
01:54:16,431 --> 01:54:19,001
my name's Bert.
I'm sorry I should have started this 

2677
01:54:19,001 --> 01:54:19,001
differently.
She goes,

2678
01:54:19,001 --> 01:54:22,730
okay.
I just walked away and then our plane 

2679
01:54:22,730 --> 01:54:26,301
got delayed and she drove home.
She drove home or playing out the lady 

2680
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:31,200
and she fucking drove home and uh,
and did not fly with me.

2681
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:32,730
Wow.
That sucks.

2682
01:54:32,830 --> 01:54:35,540
Rachel Ray.
No know ray.

2683
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:36,660
That was the original.
Raised my,

2684
01:54:36,930 --> 01:54:39,270
my girl.
We're going to Mexico in September.

2685
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:40,950
If you were single,
Rachel Ray was finger,

2686
01:54:40,970 --> 01:54:42,090
would you try to fuck her?

2687
01:54:43,670 --> 01:54:46,210
She just nodded.
Rachel's to podcasts.

2688
01:54:46,270 --> 01:54:51,270
It's mostly primarily audio.
So that's a little extra treat for the 

2689
01:54:51,270 --> 01:54:51,910
youth stream viewers.
Rachel is,

2690
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:54,780
I will say this,
I will say this candidly,

2691
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:59,960
she's married,
I'm married and I don't think there's 

2692
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:00,060
any sexual attraction that she has 
towards me.

2693
01:55:00,061 --> 01:55:01,200
I'm,
I'll put that out there.

2694
01:55:01,470 --> 01:55:04,590
But man,
she's so sexy.

2695
01:55:04,591 --> 01:55:06,480
Like there's something very powerful 
about her,

2696
01:55:06,481 --> 01:55:09,000
like she just handles herself with so 
much,

2697
01:55:09,001 --> 01:55:10,040
like,
like,

2698
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:10,770
like,
uh,

2699
01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:15,870
like initiative,
like the way she talks to you keep 

2700
01:55:15,870 --> 01:55:15,870
popping those beers.
I've been while you're talking,

2701
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:17,010
she's just,
she's just,

2702
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:18,370
she's awesome.
I have,

2703
01:55:18,450 --> 01:55:22,190
I have a great time with her.
Just makes me giggle and I fucking,

2704
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:24,720
I love her.
I think she's hot.

2705
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:25,840
She's hot.
Yeah.

2706
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:29,150
I like that.
I would like rate and take her on a date

2707
01:55:29,151 --> 01:55:34,110
and never spending more than 40 bucks,
30 minutes fucking home run.

2708
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:38,070
But she's achieved on those websites.
Are you serious?

2709
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:40,350
Well,
you're on the website on another one,

2710
01:55:40,351 --> 01:55:43,440
but I came on in defending myself.
Wait,

2711
01:55:43,441 --> 01:55:44,070
what did they say about

2712
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:44,310
you?

2713
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:45,530
Oh,
it wasn't even me.

2714
01:55:45,531 --> 01:55:47,600
It was actually a friend of mine and it 
was in Providence,

2715
01:55:47,601 --> 01:55:48,400
Rhode Island.
The,

2716
01:55:48,401 --> 01:55:48,900
the,
uh,

2717
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:50,540
the cameramen were,
uh,

2718
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:52,700
in town and this lady was really 
retarded.

2719
01:55:53,290 --> 01:55:55,000
You're the guy from survivor.

2720
01:55:55,310 --> 01:55:55,980
I said,
no,

2721
01:55:55,981 --> 01:55:56,300
no,
no,

2722
01:55:56,310 --> 01:55:56,820
no.
I'm kind of,

2723
01:55:56,821 --> 01:55:58,650
I'm the guy from fear factor.
She goes,

2724
01:55:58,680 --> 01:55:59,700
oh,
okay.

2725
01:56:00,350 --> 01:56:01,290
Like,
disappointed.

2726
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:04,020
Like I said,
something wrong or I corrected her,

2727
01:56:04,021 --> 01:56:06,750
upset at me that I corrected her and 
like it was,

2728
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:11,860
it was real weird and she came up to me 
and she wanted to take a picture of the 

2729
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:12,470
membership.
Terrible stinky breath and I,

2730
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:14,040
I agreed to take a picture of it.
Okay.

2731
01:56:14,041 --> 01:56:15,010
Thank you.
Nice to meet you.

2732
01:56:15,011 --> 01:56:16,560
And I said,
nice to meet you and that's it.

2733
01:56:16,561 --> 01:56:20,160
I left and then she wrote some whole 
thing about me being a shitty temper and

2734
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:22,050
that was really,
really rude.

2735
01:56:22,070 --> 01:56:24,060
Was Not even true.
I didn't even buy anything.

2736
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:26,010
Came in.
They were already there.

2737
01:56:26,011 --> 01:56:27,840
I just came in and sat down and by the 
way,

2738
01:56:28,090 --> 01:56:29,490
forever by the law,

2739
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:31,640
be as generous as humanly possible.

2740
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:33,000
Sometimes he tips.
I'm like,

2741
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:33,760
Joe,
I,

2742
01:56:33,761 --> 01:56:34,520
I,
you know,

2743
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:37,170
understand that that's like your bills.
$20.

2744
01:56:37,171 --> 01:56:39,900
And he just tipped 100.
That's ridiculous.

2745
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:40,420
Yeah.
But I

2746
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:41,870
love it.
They feel good.

2747
01:56:41,871 --> 01:56:43,490
You know,
if someone's waiting on you and they get

2748
01:56:43,491 --> 01:56:43,850
that,
it's okay.

2749
01:56:44,630 --> 01:56:47,110
Wait tables where you start going out to
eat and go,

2750
01:56:47,111 --> 01:56:49,600
hey,
can I just wait my question?

2751
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,900
Nick Lodge,
do you feel obliged?

2752
01:56:52,901 --> 01:56:54,180
Because,
uh,

2753
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:58,120
because you would,
it's safe to say that all your friends,

2754
01:56:58,350 --> 01:57:00,070
uh,
don't make as much money as you.

2755
01:57:00,190 --> 01:57:02,080
Do you feel obliged that you have to 
pick up the tip,

2756
01:57:02,170 --> 01:57:03,130
the tab every time?

2757
01:57:03,270 --> 01:57:06,450
I do have most of the time because the 
way I say it is,

2758
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:09,870
you know,
you can get into this who deserves it or

2759
01:57:09,871 --> 01:57:14,130
you know,
who's is it fair or what is money to you

2760
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:15,420
could,
what's a dollar to you?

2761
01:57:15,421 --> 01:57:17,030
It was $5 to you,
you know,

2762
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:21,450
when I was doing like fear factor,
especially money became very strange.

2763
01:57:21,590 --> 01:57:26,590
You know,
it becomes very strange when you have a 

2764
01:57:26,590 --> 01:57:26,590
lot of it,
you know,

2765
01:57:26,590 --> 01:57:29,720
because then it's like,
why would you look if you pay $5 for 

2766
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:29,720
your meal,
then you have to think,

2767
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:31,260
okay,
now I have 20 bucks left for the day.

2768
01:57:31,890 --> 01:57:34,590
If I'm paying $5 for a meal,
I don't think about it at all,

2769
01:57:34,591 --> 01:57:37,260
so let's just let me pay for it.
And then that way we don't have to think

2770
01:57:37,261 --> 01:57:42,261
about it.
And it's like the best allocation of 

2771
01:57:42,261 --> 01:57:44,901
resources is how I looked at it.
It's the way I looked at as like I'll 

2772
01:57:44,901 --> 01:57:46,710
pay for the tab every time simply 
because it's easy for me to pay the tab.

2773
01:57:46,711 --> 01:57:51,711
Like it doesn't bother me at all.
Like if there's $100 missing from my 

2774
01:57:51,711 --> 01:57:52,560
account or not,
it's not gonna hurt me.

2775
01:57:52,590 --> 01:57:54,360
It's not gonna change the way I feel.

2776
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:55,610
Yeah.
But you know,

2777
01:57:55,611 --> 01:57:58,500
it sucks being friends with joe is that,
that gets to.

2778
01:57:58,540 --> 01:58:01,220
I mean the first in six months I knew 
Joe,

2779
01:58:01,221 --> 01:58:02,480
I always felt like I was like,
no,

2780
01:58:02,481 --> 01:58:03,410
no,
here's $20.

2781
01:58:03,411 --> 01:58:05,540
But then I gave up on that.
You just have to give up.

2782
01:58:05,690 --> 01:58:08,360
But then I'll find myself like feeling 
bad about it,

2783
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:10,400
like all the time.
So it'd be like at starbucks?

2784
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:10,870
No,
no,

2785
01:58:10,910 --> 01:58:11,990
let me get this coffee.
No,

2786
01:58:11,991 --> 01:58:12,290
no,
no,

2787
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:13,100
no.
Seriously,

2788
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:17,930
like it does drive me crazy because I 
feel like,

2789
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:22,960
uh,
I mean every time you go out to eat 

2790
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:25,001
especially were on the road,
it's just like you're always picking up 

2791
01:58:25,001 --> 01:58:27,191
the bill.
It makes me almost not want to eat like 

2792
01:58:27,191 --> 01:58:29,500
normal.
Like normally I would go to like a 

2793
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:29,500
restaurant,
be like,

2794
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:29,500
all right,
I want the steak,

2795
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:30,740
I want an appetizer,
but then when I'm like,

2796
01:58:30,741 --> 01:58:32,390
all right,
Joe's going to take that so silly.

2797
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:35,090
It's so silly.
Whatever the fuck you want to eat,

2798
01:58:35,091 --> 01:58:37,550
I know,
but it still gets to you after.

2799
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:40,830
He's a strange thing.
You know?

2800
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:44,090
It's,
it's real strange when it becomes a like

2801
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:49,100
a dividing thing between people and it 
can really easily where people don't 

2802
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:52,921
feel like you're doing your part or 
they're paying too much or I think 

2803
01:58:52,921 --> 01:58:56,521
probably more fights between human 
beings or financial more than anything 

2804
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:58,720
just excite you at all.
Excite me.

2805
01:58:59,110 --> 01:59:01,630
I like having it because it takes care 
of problems.

2806
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:06,750
The good thing about money is you can 
need things or want things or you know,

2807
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:11,350
want free time or money takes care.
All that shit.

2808
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:14,740
If you.
If you have to fix your roof,

2809
01:59:14,741 --> 01:59:16,720
you got a hole in your roof.
Oh Shit.

2810
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:19,450
Well when you have money,
it's just a matter of calling a roof guy

2811
01:59:19,451 --> 01:59:20,920
and having them come over and fix your 
roof.

2812
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:26,070
When you don't have money,
it becomes very stressful and it's a 

2813
01:59:26,070 --> 01:59:26,070
fucking nightmare.
You think,

2814
01:59:26,070 --> 01:59:26,560
man,
I'm barely paying my rent.

2815
01:59:26,561 --> 01:59:29,140
How am I going to come up with the extra
two grand to fix this roof?

2816
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:30,730
You know,
it becomes a real issue.

2817
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:35,200
I like having it because of that,
but I'm not like,

2818
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:38,350
not big on.
I'm not a flashy person and I'm not.

2819
01:59:38,351 --> 01:59:40,360
I like cars.
That's about it,

2820
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:41,530
but I don't,
you know,

2821
01:59:41,531 --> 01:59:46,531
I'm not in a showy person.
Some people get really addicted to like 

2822
01:59:46,531 --> 01:59:47,230
keeping up with the Joneses and that 
becomes,

2823
01:59:47,290 --> 01:59:48,610
that becomes a real problem.

2824
01:59:48,770 --> 01:59:49,700
We're not,
but it's my,

2825
01:59:49,710 --> 01:59:52,590
my wife grew up in a trailer so we're 
not the family.

2826
01:59:52,890 --> 01:59:57,890
Yeah.
But you could get that way when you get 

2827
01:59:57,890 --> 01:59:57,890
really rich,
you know,

2828
01:59:57,890 --> 01:59:59,250
if this birth to conquer goes into 
seasons 16 and you know,

2829
01:59:59,251 --> 02:00:01,920
the fucking travel channel has you and 
they're big.

2830
02:00:01,980 --> 02:00:06,980
You're big giant fucking face on the 
corner of like advertisements in a birth

2831
02:00:07,061 --> 02:00:12,061
to conquer entering the [inaudible] 16 
season and then all of a sudden you're 

2832
02:00:12,061 --> 02:00:12,061
living in Beverly Hills.

2833
02:00:12,061 --> 02:00:12,810
Oh,
I'm already fucking fucked up.

2834
02:00:12,890 --> 02:00:14,080
I'm fine.
Oh yeah.

2835
02:00:14,110 --> 02:00:16,000
In what way?
I'm fucked up in the whole,

2836
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:18,970
like the prospect of fame,
I mean fame,

2837
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:21,160
fame,
and I'm definitely not famous,

2838
02:00:21,161 --> 02:00:22,390
but like,
man,

2839
02:00:24,690 --> 02:00:29,690
I don't even want to say this because 
it's like telling a secret about your 

2840
02:00:29,690 --> 02:00:29,690
soul.
So,

2841
02:00:29,690 --> 02:00:31,300
okay,
just don't judge me.

2842
02:00:31,630 --> 02:00:36,630
Just hear me as a friend.
So I'm with my friends and uh,

2843
02:00:37,970 --> 02:00:39,790
this,
I feel dirty even saying this.

2844
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:42,580
So I'm with my friends who are all,
have a ton of money.

2845
02:00:42,581 --> 02:00:44,860
Not that that matters,
but they're all in great shape.

2846
02:00:44,861 --> 02:00:49,861
They're all in the driving range rovers 
and they own bars and respite and mad 

2847
02:00:49,861 --> 02:00:52,390
came and gave.
My buddy has a best pickup line.

2848
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:57,600
He goes up to this hot groaning goes,
who does everyone tell you you look 

2849
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:57,600
like?
And she's like,

2850
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,540
Gwenyth paltrow.
And he was like,

2851
02:00:58,570 --> 02:01:00,370
I was gonna say missy Elliott.
And he walks away,

2852
02:01:00,371 --> 02:01:01,260
right?
Girls like,

2853
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:03,910
fucking all over his shit.
Just insulting or right.

2854
02:01:03,911 --> 02:01:05,320
Anyway.
Anyway.

2855
02:01:05,321 --> 02:01:05,850
Anyway,
anyway,

2856
02:01:07,460 --> 02:01:10,230
Douche bag guy,
you guys said it's good.

2857
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:14,220
And those lines like that,
that's a substitute for personnel.

2858
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:17,020
So anyway,
so if I was a chicken,

2859
02:01:17,021 --> 02:01:18,220
hate your friend.
Okay.

2860
02:01:18,221 --> 02:01:23,221
So anyway,
a bunch of hot chicks were like rolling 

2861
02:01:23,221 --> 02:01:23,221
up around us and,
and,

2862
02:01:23,221 --> 02:01:23,221
and they're,
and they're like,

2863
02:01:23,221 --> 02:01:28,021
and everyone's having a good time and in
my head because I'm this fucking father 

2864
02:01:28,021 --> 02:01:31,210
of two who's just sitting there,
I hear my brain go,

2865
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:34,180
um,
I hope someone recognizes us.

2866
02:01:34,780 --> 02:01:36,850
Like I hope I get recognized.
Like really?

2867
02:01:36,851 --> 02:01:38,500
Yeah,
because I might in a weird way,

2868
02:01:38,501 --> 02:01:42,000
my ego's fucked up because I know that 
the girls for no,

2869
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:45,240
so no one is banging you.
You're going home alone.

2870
02:01:45,250 --> 02:01:50,250
So like the only satisfaction you can 
get out of this is one of the girls 

2871
02:01:50,250 --> 02:01:50,250
going,
oh my God.

2872
02:01:50,250 --> 02:01:53,060
Exactly.
So I catch myself doing that and I go,

2873
02:01:53,061 --> 02:01:54,470
oh,
what the fuck is that?

2874
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:55,970
Did you ask them to listen to the 
podcast?

2875
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:01,220
So I didn't understand a thing.
And then I'm sitting there and heard the

2876
02:02:01,221 --> 02:02:04,730
machine and I'm watching and I'm,
and everything's going down and I go,

2877
02:02:04,731 --> 02:02:06,860
this is,
this is unhealthy behavior right now.

2878
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:09,230
What's going on is unhealthy.
And then as soon as I said,

2879
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:11,780
this girl comes up and goes,
I got to get a picture with you.

2880
02:02:11,781 --> 02:02:12,890
And then my,
I'm like,

2881
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:14,030
okay,
I'm done,

2882
02:02:14,031 --> 02:02:15,560
I don't need to fuck anyone tonight.
I'm done.

2883
02:02:15,561 --> 02:02:16,790
I got recognized like it's,
Oh,

2884
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:17,890
it's,
yeah,

2885
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:19,070
but that.
But that is,

2886
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:20,270
it's,
it's addictive.

2887
02:02:20,271 --> 02:02:21,080
This shit,
the,

2888
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:26,900
the,
the idea of getting recognized or being 

2889
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:27,560
acknowledged for your work is so self 
gratifying.

2890
02:02:27,770 --> 02:02:30,210
It's like,
it's almost like masturbating.

2891
02:02:30,211 --> 02:02:34,340
It's,
it feels good and it's shallow,

2892
02:02:34,570 --> 02:02:35,930
it's so fucking empty.
Shallow.

2893
02:02:35,931 --> 02:02:40,430
But in a weird way I can totally see how
people get fucked up on it.

2894
02:02:40,650 --> 02:02:40,910
Well,

2895
02:02:41,530 --> 02:02:45,340
shallow and maybe what you do is get 
pete,

2896
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:47,290
that's,
it's been a long time.

2897
02:02:47,710 --> 02:02:52,710
And uh,
it's been a normal thing for me to get 

2898
02:02:52,710 --> 02:02:55,771
recognized for more than a decade.
So since fear factor was to get,

2899
02:02:59,860 --> 02:03:00,520
you know,
look,

2900
02:03:00,550 --> 02:03:05,550
the way I always say it is,
it's a bunch of people being nice to 

2901
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:05,550
you.
That's what it is.

2902
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:05,550
People go,
does it ever get annoying?

2903
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:10,441
Does it ever get tired?
It's just a bunch of people being nice 

2904
02:03:10,441 --> 02:03:10,441
to you.
It's cool.

2905
02:03:10,441 --> 02:03:13,300
But I think it's very important to not 
understand where it was,

2906
02:03:13,330 --> 02:03:14,050
you know,
the chain.

2907
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:15,520
It's addictive.
It feels good.

2908
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:18,460
It's very important to like put it all 
into perspective,

2909
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:23,820
you know,
and it's good to be recognized for your 

2910
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:23,820
stuff and it's good to do good stuff 
that people like,

2911
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:25,570
you know,
the beautiful thing about seeing,

2912
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:26,320
you know,
you,

2913
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:31,330
you run into someone out in public is 
most of the time they're going to enjoy 

2914
02:03:31,330 --> 02:03:31,330
what you've done.
You know,

2915
02:03:31,330 --> 02:03:32,530
most of the time if someone comes up to 
you,

2916
02:03:32,531 --> 02:03:34,180
it's like they appreciate what you've 
done.

2917
02:03:34,181 --> 02:03:36,400
And so you've given them something 
already and you already,

2918
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:38,680
you really,
even though you don't even know it,

2919
02:03:38,890 --> 02:03:40,300
you have a relationship with this 
person.

2920
02:03:40,330 --> 02:03:40,900
Yeah.
No,

2921
02:03:40,901 --> 02:03:41,470
no,
no,

2922
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:42,220
no.
Okay.

2923
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:43,750
No,
in all fairness.

2924
02:03:44,110 --> 02:03:45,340
Uh,
so,

2925
02:03:45,730 --> 02:03:48,820
but how did it feel when Bourdain,
who you,

2926
02:03:48,910 --> 02:03:51,420
who you're a fan of comes up to you and 
is like,

2927
02:03:51,430 --> 02:03:52,360
I'd love to do your project,

2928
02:03:52,940 --> 02:03:57,350
one of sitting next to each other,
just completely randomly really at a,

2929
02:03:57,410 --> 02:03:58,820
at a restaurant in Vegas.
Oh,

2930
02:03:58,821 --> 02:03:59,750
seriously,
totally.

2931
02:03:59,751 --> 02:04:01,460
Seriously.
I literally,

2932
02:04:01,461 --> 02:04:06,461
he was as close as you are to me.
So I sat down and he reached up and he 

2933
02:04:06,461 --> 02:04:06,500
said,
hey,

2934
02:04:06,501 --> 02:04:07,250
you know,
uh,

2935
02:04:07,251 --> 02:04:09,920
I,
I keep getting asked to things in life,

2936
02:04:09,921 --> 02:04:12,740
one to go fuck myself and to,
to do your podcast.

2937
02:04:12,890 --> 02:04:13,680
Are you serious?
Yeah,

2938
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:14,980
that's what I said now.
Okay.

2939
02:04:14,990 --> 02:04:19,990
Be Honest.
So your heart flutter totally same shit.

2940
02:04:21,610 --> 02:04:24,820
I think that's the same shit ultimately.
So.

2941
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:25,760
So.
Oh God,

2942
02:04:25,761 --> 02:04:26,780
I'm obsessed with bordain.

2943
02:04:27,140 --> 02:04:28,100
Yeah,
he's a great guy.

2944
02:04:28,170 --> 02:04:30,200
Yeah.
I enjoyed talking to him and he actually

2945
02:04:30,201 --> 02:04:32,020
came to my show at the,
uh,

2946
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:36,250
the Mandalay Bay theater and I was 
really any tweeted how funny it was.

2947
02:04:36,251 --> 02:04:37,230
He was like,
I mean,

2948
02:04:37,231 --> 02:04:38,460
I,
I love to this tweet.

2949
02:04:38,461 --> 02:04:40,650
It said saw Joe Rogan dive.
Very,

2950
02:04:40,651 --> 02:04:42,070
very funny.
You know,

2951
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:44,190
I said we're going to have great things 
to talk about in the podcast,

2952
02:04:44,191 --> 02:04:46,050
like interests and stuff.
That's what you said in the tweet.

2953
02:04:46,290 --> 02:04:47,610
And I remember reading that going,
wow,

2954
02:04:47,611 --> 02:04:50,020
I feel like I live in some sort of a 
fucking fantasy land.

2955
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:52,320
Some sort of a strange world that's not 
real.

2956
02:04:52,350 --> 02:04:53,320
Fuck Dane,

2957
02:04:53,380 --> 02:04:54,450
man,
I enjoy that guy.

2958
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,340
He does not.
He does not.

2959
02:04:56,341 --> 02:05:01,341
He's not.
He would not tweet something he didn't 

2960
02:05:01,341 --> 02:05:01,341
feel and,
and,

2961
02:05:01,341 --> 02:05:05,730
and he is a judge.
He's not a guy that if he didn't think 

2962
02:05:05,730 --> 02:05:07,440
it was funny,
he would have never tweeted it.

2963
02:05:07,890 --> 02:05:11,410
And the fact that getting like three 
various holy Fuck Vegas

2964
02:05:11,410 --> 02:05:14,650
man in Vegas during the night before the
UFC and it was me,

2965
02:05:14,651 --> 02:05:15,820
Joey Diaz.

2966
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,120
Hey,
who else did you get to meet?

2967
02:05:17,121 --> 02:05:19,370
Joey does.
Doug Benson.

2968
02:05:19,660 --> 02:05:22,020
George sucralose was there and I just,
yeah,

2969
02:05:22,030 --> 02:05:25,300
Joey Diaz went out and crushed it.
We just let it fly.

2970
02:05:25,570 --> 02:05:30,570
Those,
those fucking Vegas shows are fun as 

2971
02:05:30,570 --> 02:05:30,570
shit man.
When that place fills up and that,

2972
02:05:30,570 --> 02:05:33,370
that Mandalay Bay theaters like 1600 
people,

2973
02:05:33,371 --> 02:05:36,160
it's huge.
It's fucking awesome to man.

2974
02:05:36,580 --> 02:05:38,720
And so bordain being the audience was 
like,

2975
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:41,260
it was really weird because I'm getting,
I'm,

2976
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:43,600
I'm used to being around like,
you know,

2977
02:05:43,690 --> 02:05:48,480
Chuck Liddell and Rashad Evans and 
fucking Leo Machida and Bj Penn and like

2978
02:05:48,490 --> 02:05:51,430
some of the best fighters in the world 
where a lot of people would freak,

2979
02:05:51,640 --> 02:05:52,960
you know,
I see them like pj,

2980
02:05:52,961 --> 02:05:53,620
what's up?
You know,

2981
02:05:53,621 --> 02:05:54,850
it's like they're my friends,
you know?

2982
02:05:54,851 --> 02:05:57,130
To me it's like normal.
It's like meeting meeting you,

2983
02:05:57,490 --> 02:06:02,490
but you know,
for me to be around and do like Anthony 

2984
02:06:02,490 --> 02:06:02,490
Bourdain,
it's like this is a different world.

2985
02:06:02,490 --> 02:06:03,950
He's a guy from the show

2986
02:06:04,050 --> 02:06:07,700
problems,
lb side first world problems.

2987
02:06:08,690 --> 02:06:11,660
First world problems is when he talks 
about veganism,

2988
02:06:12,580 --> 02:06:16,090
vegans and vegetarian and he's like,
this is a first world option,

2989
02:06:16,150 --> 02:06:21,150
you know,
and that's what I've always felt when 

2990
02:06:21,150 --> 02:06:21,150
people would go off about vegetables and
they're like,

2991
02:06:21,150 --> 02:06:22,510
you need to be a vegan animal.
Cruelty.

2992
02:06:22,511 --> 02:06:25,150
And I agree animal cruelty is fucked up,
but I don't agree.

2993
02:06:25,151 --> 02:06:30,151
You shouldn't kill animals.
You can go fuck yourself or what are 

2994
02:06:30,151 --> 02:06:30,550
they going to live forever and cure 
cancer if they stay alive.

2995
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:32,530
This is ridiculous.
And guess what?

2996
02:06:32,531 --> 02:06:37,531
They'd kill you too.
There's a lot of shit that would kill 

2997
02:06:37,531 --> 02:06:37,531
you and maybe maybe me live in,
you know,

2998
02:06:37,531 --> 02:06:39,660
I just,
I just don't know.

2999
02:06:39,740 --> 02:06:44,740
I don't agree with that.
So I don't hear very many people say 

3000
02:06:44,740 --> 02:06:46,951
that.
So when bordain started saying that the 

3001
02:06:46,951 --> 02:06:46,951
vegetarianism is a first world problem,
like,

3002
02:06:46,951 --> 02:06:47,230
yes,
thank you.

3003
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:52,560
So the people in the world,
they need to kill things to sustain 

3004
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:52,560
themselves.
For Real.

3005
02:06:52,620 --> 02:06:57,620
It's like there's no options.
It's not like whether or not you choose 

3006
02:06:57,620 --> 02:06:58,390
to not eat pig.
Like that's the only animal we have.

3007
02:06:58,391 --> 02:06:58,870
Stupid.

3008
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:03,290
Eat The fucking peg is.
Are you going to get bored?

3009
02:07:03,291 --> 02:07:07,020
Eight on September 11th had really 
American 11.

3010
02:07:07,450 --> 02:07:09,830
Are you fucking kidding me?
September 11th,

3011
02:07:09,890 --> 02:07:11,060
2011,
nine.

3012
02:07:11,061 --> 02:07:15,110
11 food.
Not 11 food hot dogs,

3013
02:07:15,111 --> 02:07:16,060
Bro.
Anything American?

3014
02:07:16,430 --> 02:07:20,770
Would it be awkward if I just showed up?
Now it's like you want to come in.

3015
02:07:22,220 --> 02:07:24,020
You ever hung out with them?
Never even met the guy.

3016
02:07:26,430 --> 02:07:31,430
Really great guy.
Great on his show.

3017
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:33,740
Bring Rachel Ray.
You would be awesome on his show.

3018
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:35,680
Where did you grow up?
Terrible.

3019
02:07:35,770 --> 02:07:37,800
Tampa.
Maybe you could take him tampon.

3020
02:07:37,810 --> 02:07:42,810
Show what's up to eat and Tampa clubs.
I'm not kidding,

3021
02:07:43,091 --> 02:07:43,820
man.
For Real.

3022
02:07:44,230 --> 02:07:46,180
If you have strip clubs that serve 
Nachos,

3023
02:07:46,181 --> 02:07:48,490
Anthony Bordain will go there and eat 
the Nachos.

3024
02:07:48,970 --> 02:07:53,970
Actually,
they're quite delightful and he would 

3025
02:07:53,970 --> 02:07:53,970
sit there and eat Nachos at your strip 
club.

3026
02:07:53,970 --> 02:07:53,970
Dude,
he eats.

3027
02:07:53,970 --> 02:07:56,110
Or street food.
Have you even watched the show?

3028
02:07:56,110 --> 02:08:01,110
Love Him.
I talked to the president of travel to 

3029
02:08:01,110 --> 02:08:01,110
the other day.
My man needs treat fruit or renee called

3030
02:08:01,110 --> 02:08:01,360
me.
She goes,

3031
02:08:01,450 --> 02:08:06,160
you need to watch anthony show and just 
watch it because she called him Tony.

3032
02:08:06,430 --> 02:08:09,790
She's like,
because what he's doing is perfect.

3033
02:08:09,970 --> 02:08:12,190
It is.
It is fucking perfect.

3034
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:15,160
It is his voice.
It is his personality.

3035
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:17,590
He doesn't do two or three takes of 
anything.

3036
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:20,780
It is fucking bear and he does it.
Personality driven.

3037
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:23,260
It is personality driven.
When I said to him,

3038
02:08:23,261 --> 02:08:24,040
when I met him,
I said,

3039
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:26,800
someone,
when you first started doing that show,

3040
02:08:26,950 --> 02:08:28,900
they must have just left you completely 
alone.

3041
02:08:28,901 --> 02:08:30,310
He was totally.
He goes,

3042
02:08:30,311 --> 02:08:33,180
they just let you do whatever you do.
You like your show.

3043
02:08:33,210 --> 02:08:36,710
It's obvious that no one had a hand in 
this like this is.

3044
02:08:36,711 --> 02:08:41,711
It's so clear that there haven't been 
meddling executives to checking the way 

3045
02:08:41,861 --> 02:08:42,970
he does his narratives.

3046
02:08:42,980 --> 02:08:44,750
No,
not 100 percent sense.

3047
02:08:44,751 --> 02:08:48,460
This podcast,
this podcast is so pure like that.

3048
02:08:48,461 --> 02:08:51,390
You listened to it and you go,
it's a Ah.

3049
02:08:51,420 --> 02:08:54,040
It's almost like,
like watch it,

3050
02:08:54,110 --> 02:08:55,930
like Doug Fan hope we called it the 
quickening.

3051
02:08:56,260 --> 02:08:58,630
Like it just,
it just happens and you're like,

3052
02:08:58,890 --> 02:09:03,890
oh fuck.
Like this podcast that we've been on 

3053
02:09:03,890 --> 02:09:03,890
today,
it's so bizarre because I've laughed.

3054
02:09:03,890 --> 02:09:08,341
Hardy Shit.
I've fought hardest shit I've felt I've 

3055
02:09:08,341 --> 02:09:10,150
never enjoyed.
Out of the three ones I've done,

3056
02:09:10,270 --> 02:09:15,270
this is the one I've enjoyed the most.
Doing like this has been just fucking 

3057
02:09:15,270 --> 02:09:18,400
because we're hammered.
Bready clink,

3058
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:21,250
clink,
clink,

3059
02:09:21,270 --> 02:09:21,570
clink.

3060
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:27,250
Rachel Ray Skater over.
Would you fuck her first?

3061
02:09:27,770 --> 02:09:31,140
When did you make her cook for you first
and then fucker her.

3062
02:09:31,141 --> 02:09:34,240
You fuck her then make or cook for you?
I'll cook for her.

3063
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:35,630
Really?
Fuck Ya.

3064
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:37,020
And then he'd be tired.
You went in,

3065
02:09:37,370 --> 02:09:39,280
put her leg and outstanding performance 
together.

3066
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:40,600
Here's a question for you.
Joe.

3067
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:42,580
Do you get,
if you get stuff,

3068
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:44,070
do you have to wait 30 minutes?
Like,

3069
02:09:44,250 --> 02:09:49,250
like pull style before you have sex?
Because I've noticed lately it depends 

3070
02:09:49,250 --> 02:09:52,771
on whether it be generous.
Sometimes I just want it like I know 

3071
02:09:52,771 --> 02:09:53,490
that the kids are awake and so I,
I can't,

3072
02:09:53,530 --> 02:09:58,530
I can get it off with a quickie quickie,
quickie boom and then I'll fall off the 

3073
02:10:00,611 --> 02:10:03,610
bed and go into a coma.
When I get those freebies,

3074
02:10:03,611 --> 02:10:05,200
what I'm going to have to make her come.
That's awesome.

3075
02:10:07,090 --> 02:10:10,270
That's all the time.
So when you have kids,

3076
02:10:10,271 --> 02:10:15,271
but then sometimes you get a sneak one 
in real quick and I've been told this 

3077
02:10:15,271 --> 02:10:15,271
joke on stage.
You have to balance it out.

3078
02:10:15,271 --> 02:10:15,640
You have to make them come to.
Yeah.

3079
02:10:15,730 --> 02:10:16,220
Well yeah.
No,

3080
02:10:16,230 --> 02:10:16,930
I go,
I'll go.

3081
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:18,220
I'll go down on her.
Yeah,

3082
02:10:18,290 --> 02:10:20,330
it's very important,
but I'm not willing to listen to them.

3083
02:10:20,450 --> 02:10:21,900
Oh,
go down on her.

3084
02:10:22,950 --> 02:10:26,710
The way you said that was like my uncle 
used to take us fishing.

3085
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:39,800
You have to go away to Vietnam.
You stepped back,

3086
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:42,180
Shane Garner.
I was,

3087
02:10:42,220 --> 02:10:45,140
I was having sexual needs one extra 
level.

3088
02:10:45,141 --> 02:10:50,141
You know my dad,
my dad gave me the speed and your dad 

3089
02:10:50,141 --> 02:10:50,570
gave you speak.
Hold on,

3090
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:51,470
hold on,
hold on,

3091
02:10:51,471 --> 02:10:52,370
hold on,
hold on.

3092
02:10:52,530 --> 02:10:55,850
Hear me out.
My Dad,

3093
02:10:55,910 --> 02:10:57,540
my dad is on this.
He's,

3094
02:10:57,620 --> 02:11:00,190
he doesn't call it speed.
He calls it digests.

3095
02:11:00,230 --> 02:11:01,910
I tell you this,
Brian Daddy's medicine.

3096
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:06,940
He calls it,
a doctor gave it to him for him to lose 

3097
02:11:06,940 --> 02:11:06,940
weight and so my dad gave me like six of
them.

3098
02:11:06,940 --> 02:11:08,600
It's a weird.
He's going to eat to lose weight.

3099
02:11:08,830 --> 02:11:13,830
Yes.
They give you the speed and then it's 

3100
02:11:13,830 --> 02:11:13,830
not like a ton of speed.
It's not like.

3101
02:11:13,830 --> 02:11:18,770
But it's,
it definitely curbs your appetite and 

3102
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:19,010
definitely are on speed.
But he gave me six.

3103
02:11:19,011 --> 02:11:19,460
He's like,
buddy,

3104
02:11:19,461 --> 02:11:21,070
I'm concerned about your weight.
Let's just jump.

3105
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:23,960
Started a diet with these.
So he gave me six of them.

3106
02:11:25,600 --> 02:11:27,950
So I took one and then the second I took
it I was like,

3107
02:11:27,980 --> 02:11:29,650
this is fucking speed.
I called my dad.

3108
02:11:29,651 --> 02:11:29,990
I go,
dad,

3109
02:11:29,991 --> 02:11:32,210
it's speed.
You got to stop because it's speed.

3110
02:11:32,211 --> 02:11:33,110
And he's like,
buddy,

3111
02:11:33,140 --> 02:11:34,980
doctors aren't gonna prescribe the speed
I was,

3112
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:40,040
it's like adderall.
It's like it's anything but A.

3113
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:41,990
First of all I didn't need a fucking 
thing.

3114
02:11:42,050 --> 02:11:47,050
I eat a grape and I appealed it.
And how many,

3115
02:11:49,250 --> 02:11:50,390
how long,
how many hours?

3116
02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:53,060
Like 12 hours.
Just didn't need it.

3117
02:11:53,090 --> 02:11:56,000
I was,
oh and I wrote like crazy.

3118
02:11:56,240 --> 02:11:59,320
Like I'm working on a book and I just 
put up like,

3119
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:01,670
oh,
you're so in the zone,

3120
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:02,870
but it.
But you know,

3121
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:04,130
it's,
I know it's unhealthy.

3122
02:12:04,190 --> 02:12:07,580
What is it like the come now?
What's the come down like a not there.

3123
02:12:07,950 --> 02:12:08,440
No,
no.

3124
02:12:08,450 --> 02:12:09,920
Come down.
So you took adderall.

3125
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:11,840
It's basically adderall.
It's,

3126
02:12:11,870 --> 02:12:12,450
it's,
but it's an,

3127
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:17,560
it's an APP.
It's specifically an appetite 

3128
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:17,560
suppressant.
What it is is.

3129
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:18,260
Do you remember phen phen?
Yes.

3130
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:23,320
It is the second of the fence.
I know a girl who lost a fuck load of 

3131
02:12:23,320 --> 02:12:27,131
weight on phen phen.
Phen phen was a mood inhibitor and a 

3132
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:29,180
speed,
a mood inhibitor.

3133
02:12:29,630 --> 02:12:31,610
Serotonin.
It would induce your serotonin.

3134
02:12:31,611 --> 02:12:36,611
It was like one of those things.
First phen was like a zoloft and the 

3135
02:12:36,611 --> 02:12:37,310
second one,
I fucking hate that.

3136
02:12:37,311 --> 02:12:39,590
I am talking right now and I'm really 
not sure.

3137
02:12:39,591 --> 02:12:40,380
Joe.
I don't know.

3138
02:12:40,381 --> 02:12:43,460
I'm just kind of speculating.
This is my,

3139
02:12:43,470 --> 02:12:45,320
this is.
I'll just give you my research.

3140
02:12:46,430 --> 02:12:49,400
The first fan was like a mood inhibitor.
The second one was speed,

3141
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:54,460
like agora fennel hall or something.
And what my dad is taking is the second 

3142
02:12:54,460 --> 02:12:54,860
of the two friends.

3143
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:58,700
And so he gave some to me and he's like,
buddy,

3144
02:12:58,701 --> 02:13:02,960
you just gotta jump started dying man.
It fucking works.

3145
02:13:02,990 --> 02:13:03,950
Really?
Yes.

3146
02:13:03,951 --> 02:13:05,270
And then you don't come down.
It's just.

3147
02:13:05,390 --> 02:13:10,390
I mean it's just,
you just get tired at the end of the 

3148
02:13:10,390 --> 02:13:10,390
day.
On the pills on you.

3149
02:13:10,390 --> 02:13:10,610
Give me one.
I have one left on you right now.

3150
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:11,420
Snorting.
Really?

3151
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:13,700
Just it triple it up.
Yeah.

3152
02:13:15,570 --> 02:13:20,570
So we can.
So you can go fucking fight some guys 

3153
02:13:20,570 --> 02:13:22,940
and Brian and I can drive back to la.
It might have a heart attack.

3154
02:13:23,190 --> 02:13:28,190
This stuff's rolling on speed.
But there's a doctor in Tampa that that 

3155
02:13:28,190 --> 02:13:31,900
prescribes it to all my friends.
All my friends have lost a ton of 

3156
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:34,091
weight.
Of course they're all going to be dead 

3157
02:13:34,091 --> 02:13:34,091
in a decade,
you know?

3158
02:13:34,091 --> 02:13:35,310
But it's like so low grade,
it doesn't feel like my dad's,

3159
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:40,460
my dad's cardiologist knows he's on it 
and my dad's cardiologist is better for 

3160
02:13:40,460 --> 02:13:43,860
you to take that and lose the weight 
because that's better for your body then

3161
02:13:43,861 --> 02:13:48,030
to the fat than to be fat.
So it get you down to my dad lost and my

3162
02:13:48,031 --> 02:13:53,031
dad.
Now this motherfucker is eating 500 

3163
02:13:53,031 --> 02:13:53,420
calories a day.
Five hundred horrible.

3164
02:13:54,050 --> 02:13:56,350
Eddie's taken female urine.
What?

3165
02:13:56,390 --> 02:13:57,960
Like he's taken.
We all do that.

3166
02:13:57,961 --> 02:13:58,560
But what?

3167
02:14:00,930 --> 02:14:04,320
Ryan,
this is your best podcast I've ever been

3168
02:14:04,321 --> 02:14:04,670
on.
Brian,

3169
02:14:04,671 --> 02:14:07,010
you are murdering it today.
Much better when he's hammered.

3170
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:13,440
No,
he's taken this female female get drunk 

3171
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:13,590
everyday.
This female urine drip under his tongue.

3172
02:14:13,591 --> 02:14:15,420
He's got a hold of me in a minute.
Once.

3173
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:17,010
Just fucking come on.
Dog.

3174
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:19,530
Female urine drip.
Call Your Dad.

3175
02:14:20,210 --> 02:14:22,440
This is ridiculous by the way.
His Dad,

3176
02:14:22,460 --> 02:14:23,850
uh,
we called his dad last time.

3177
02:14:23,851 --> 02:14:27,210
What was the for a soft softball.
Oh,

3178
02:14:27,211 --> 02:14:28,160
he broke his.
Yeah.

3179
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:29,730
This is my dad's house.
This is crazy.

3180
02:14:29,820 --> 02:14:30,990
I'm broke.
Uh,

3181
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:33,660
I was playing a baseball game when I got
hit their mouth and I got 26 teeth,

3182
02:14:33,661 --> 02:14:35,890
knocked out 2016.
And my dad,

3183
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:38,130
my dad pulled me.
I have 32,

3184
02:14:38,140 --> 02:14:40,320
82.
Well you lost all your teeth.

3185
02:14:40,410 --> 02:14:42,490
All of these are from when you're 
looking at from a softball,

3186
02:14:43,450 --> 02:14:44,100
baseball,
baseball,

3187
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:47,760
women's softball.
That's incredible.

3188
02:14:47,790 --> 02:14:49,590
How long did it take before they put the
teeth back?

3189
02:14:49,770 --> 02:14:51,480
Uh,
they will.

3190
02:14:51,481 --> 02:14:55,410
They started that that day,
like they started healing and putting in

3191
02:14:55,411 --> 02:14:58,620
caps and crowns and posts and everything
that day.

3192
02:14:58,890 --> 02:15:00,140
But um,
but I,

3193
02:15:00,280 --> 02:15:02,940
this is totally true.
Totally fake teeth.

3194
02:15:02,941 --> 02:15:04,020
One hundred percent fake.
No.

3195
02:15:04,060 --> 02:15:09,060
Yeah,
like everything you're seeing all the 

3196
02:15:09,060 --> 02:15:09,060
way to the gold ones.
Yeah.

3197
02:15:09,060 --> 02:15:09,630
Wow.
So crazy.

3198
02:15:09,631 --> 02:15:11,580
Listen to this.
So my dad,

3199
02:15:11,770 --> 02:15:12,660
I,
this happened,

3200
02:15:12,661 --> 02:15:14,430
my dad was my coach and I was like,
oh,

3201
02:15:14,490 --> 02:15:19,490
my teeth run home plate.
I was catching my teeth won't fucking 

3202
02:15:19,490 --> 02:15:19,490
plate.
And I was like,

3203
02:15:19,490 --> 02:15:19,490
oh.
And he was like,

3204
02:15:19,490 --> 02:15:19,940
buddy,
take off the couches,

3205
02:15:20,030 --> 02:15:21,910
catcher gear,
go to shortstop.

3206
02:15:22,060 --> 02:15:22,890
And I was like,
what?

3207
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:24,840
He's like,
you gotta finish eating a real,

3208
02:15:24,841 --> 02:15:26,340
lose a game.
I was like,

3209
02:15:26,490 --> 02:15:27,930
the fuck you talking about.
And he was like,

3210
02:15:27,931 --> 02:15:30,960
come on,
let's go man up over and shortstop.

3211
02:15:31,510 --> 02:15:34,760
He made all his teeth,
got knocked out.

3212
02:15:34,761 --> 02:15:37,710
I was a child.
My Dad is a really great guy.

3213
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:39,250
I'm making him sound horrible.
But,

3214
02:15:39,550 --> 02:15:41,460
but he said,
well,

3215
02:15:41,461 --> 02:15:42,840
just douchey.
No,

3216
02:15:42,841 --> 02:15:43,980
he's just,
he's he,

3217
02:15:43,990 --> 02:15:48,990
let's call them.
Find out about the speed or the women's 

3218
02:15:48,990 --> 02:15:48,990
urine friend.
The name of it to is.

3219
02:15:49,230 --> 02:15:51,780
Does your dad feel bad about doing that 
to you as a child?

3220
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:53,400
You know,
he was just a different guy.

3221
02:15:53,790 --> 02:15:56,580
It was a different time.
That's a different time.

3222
02:15:56,820 --> 02:15:58,980
Like he was running marathons.
He was.

3223
02:15:59,390 --> 02:16:00,240
Sounds like you could.

3224
02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:08,010
Oh No,
I'm sorry.

3225
02:16:08,011 --> 02:16:09,630
I doubt my house,
my house,

3226
02:16:09,810 --> 02:16:11,250
my old house.
I got home.

3227
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:13,260
Sorry.
I meant to my mom and dad.

3228
02:16:13,470 --> 02:16:14,760
God,
that fucking scared me.

3229
02:16:15,030 --> 02:16:17,730
I was just like,
oh my parents are like scares you bro.

3230
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:20,580
Yeah.
Why is this scared when we start smoking

3231
02:16:20,581 --> 02:16:21,190
some weed?
No,

3232
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:22,680
when he did,
when he did the,

3233
02:16:22,681 --> 02:16:23,610
uh,
when he did the,

3234
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:28,720
the,
the noise of me hitting the ground and 

3235
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:28,720
going into the next dimension.
You saw me jump.

3236
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,720
Alright,
here we go.

3237
02:16:35,670 --> 02:16:40,670
It's a,
it's a pregnant female urine he puts 

3238
02:16:40,670 --> 02:16:40,670
under his tongue.

3239
02:16:40,670 --> 02:16:40,760
Okay,
well who doesn't do that?

3240
02:16:43,950 --> 02:16:45,760
We [inaudible] you've reached the 
crushers.

3241
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:49,640
You know,
they used to use rabbits.

3242
02:16:49,970 --> 02:16:54,970
Lisa inject women's urine into rabbits 
to find out if the woman was pregnant 

3243
02:16:54,970 --> 02:16:58,040
and it's the rabbit died.
That means that the woman was pregnant.

3244
02:16:58,090 --> 02:16:58,980
Are you serious?
Yeah.

3245
02:16:59,270 --> 02:17:00,120
Yeah.
It's called the rabbit.

3246
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:02,420
Yeah.
You didn't know that.

3247
02:17:02,450 --> 02:17:02,810
The rabbit

3248
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:07,860
test.
I've got good news and I've got bad 

3249
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:07,860
news.
Your rabbit's going to die.

3250
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:08,170
It's my parents,
my parents.

3251
02:17:08,171 --> 02:17:08,680
Okay,
hold on.

3252
02:17:08,681 --> 02:17:10,480
I'm pretty sure they call you back.
Hello?

3253
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:12,040
Albert,
what are you

3254
02:17:12,190 --> 02:17:12,770
Ahmed?
Uh,

3255
02:17:13,180 --> 02:17:14,200
my friend's house.

3256
02:17:15,470 --> 02:17:17,700
We're a Joe Rogan's house.
Mom,

3257
02:17:17,701 --> 02:17:20,100
are you familiar with Joe Rogan's work,
Khalid Jew boy.

3258
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:22,080
Joe Rogan.
You are?

3259
02:17:22,770 --> 02:17:23,520
No,
she's not.

3260
02:17:23,530 --> 02:17:28,360
She's not familiar with your birth mom.

3261
02:17:28,620 --> 02:17:31,230
What is,
what does dad put under his tongue?

3262
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:32,480
How forcible,
how much weight is dead?

3263
02:17:32,490 --> 02:17:32,910
Last,

3264
02:17:33,450 --> 02:17:35,280
uh,
23 pounds.

3265
02:17:35,580 --> 02:17:36,990
And what does he put under his tongue?

3266
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:39,790
I'm going to the refrigerator to find 
it.

3267
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:44,410
And I want you to know I've put your 
life on hold to talk to you.

3268
02:17:44,730 --> 02:17:45,750
Okay,
great.

3269
02:17:46,170 --> 02:17:49,720
It is called ready Google this.
It's female.

3270
02:17:49,750 --> 02:17:50,970
It's pregnant.
Women's urine,

3271
02:17:50,971 --> 02:17:51,360
right?
Mom.

3272
02:17:52,310 --> 02:17:56,570
Oh,
God knows whether that's what it is.

3273
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:00,020
I'll text you the technical date.
Okay.

3274
02:18:00,180 --> 02:18:01,140
You can't just say it.

3275
02:18:03,270 --> 02:18:04,140
Okay.
I'm A.

3276
02:18:04,140 --> 02:18:08,400
I'm a phonics teacher,
but flora run the chorionic.

3277
02:18:09,180 --> 02:18:10,050
Chorionic.

3278
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:11,230
Not that one.

3279
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:13,930
No,
I don't.

3280
02:18:14,350 --> 02:18:14,730
To go

3281
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:17,670
a few minutes,

3282
02:18:17,690 --> 02:18:18,610
Lori.
I got dod,

3283
02:18:18,620 --> 02:18:23,620
Doj.
Japan is done to check the hormone hcg 

3284
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:23,960
in blood or urine

3285
02:18:24,150 --> 02:18:25,340
yesterday.
They tti?

3286
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:30,700
Yes.
Some hcg tests measure the exact amount 

3287
02:18:30,810 --> 02:18:33,090
and some just check to see if the 
hormone is present.

3288
02:18:33,091 --> 02:18:36,570
HCG is made by the placenta during 
pregnancy.

3289
02:18:37,260 --> 02:18:37,950
The HCD

3290
02:18:39,800 --> 02:18:43,470
fucking told you it can be used to see 
if a woman is pregnant or as a part of a

3291
02:18:43,471 --> 02:18:45,210
screening test,
but he's lost.

3292
02:18:45,990 --> 02:18:47,340
He's lost a lot of weight though,
right?

3293
02:18:48,060 --> 02:18:49,380
It has something to do with pregnancy

3294
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:56,300
because he's put magnet urines 500 
calories a day.

3295
02:19:00,190 --> 02:19:02,110
Wow.
That doesn't sound like enough,

3296
02:19:02,810 --> 02:19:07,810
but he really doesn't eat 500 calories a
day because he told Dave that he cheats 

3297
02:19:07,810 --> 02:19:09,920
and space under a thousand and that's 
why he's last week.

3298
02:19:09,990 --> 02:19:11,900
Thousand.
Sounds reasonable.

3299
02:19:11,901 --> 02:19:13,190
500.
Sounds crazy,

3300
02:19:13,230 --> 02:19:13,640
right?
Mom,

3301
02:19:13,700 --> 02:19:14,750
I'm going to let you go.
I love you.

3302
02:19:15,570 --> 02:19:16,650
Love you too sweetie.
Bye.

3303
02:19:16,820 --> 02:19:19,990
5,000
calories is too little too though.

3304
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:22,630
I mean like,
like if you're only doing 500 calories,

3305
02:19:22,631 --> 02:19:24,270
what is he eating?
His chicken.

3306
02:19:24,340 --> 02:19:28,250
I did it one day with him when I was.
It's a half a chicken

3307
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:33,250
breast and a handful of Broccoli and 
that's one meal and the next one is 

3308
02:19:34,011 --> 02:19:37,130
another handful of Broccoli and another 
half a chicken breast and you're allowed

3309
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:42,160
a bread stick that's so extreme.
The urine stuff gets you.

3310
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:45,580
It's like a testosterone thing.
It starts sort of jasmine,

3311
02:19:45,581 --> 02:19:48,200
you and he gets like B,
12 shots and he goes to this doctor

3312
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:54,060
all the time and yeah.
Pissed or whatever.

3313
02:19:55,020 --> 02:19:58,210
I've never worked for the news.
Yeah.

3314
02:19:58,270 --> 02:20:02,530
You to be more specific.
They invaded Sam B.

3315
02:20:02,530 --> 02:20:03,770
Twelve shots.
The fucking pregnant.

3316
02:20:03,771 --> 02:20:05,030
Piss on.
You know,

3317
02:20:05,380 --> 02:20:10,380
he's on speed.
Was he got sentenced to use this?

3318
02:20:15,460 --> 02:20:16,800
She say placenta.
Yeah.

3319
02:20:17,980 --> 02:20:21,350
Yeah.
Have something to do with placenta.

3320
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:23,690
I get my Puente students at GSA in 
Glendale.

3321
02:20:24,950 --> 02:20:27,840
It's cheaper in Glendale.
Yeah,

3322
02:20:29,090 --> 02:20:29,690
Glendale.
Really?

3323
02:20:29,820 --> 02:20:31,720
I don't know.
There's just more in Glendale.

3324
02:20:32,130 --> 02:20:34,200
Glendale.
Yeah.

3325
02:20:35,570 --> 02:20:37,160
I just got your uh,
laptop.

3326
02:20:38,110 --> 02:20:39,920
What?
I just understood your laptop.

3327
02:20:39,950 --> 02:20:40,600
Oh,
it's snow white.

3328
02:20:40,790 --> 02:20:43,380
Still waiting in the apple laptop broke 
just now.

3329
02:20:43,750 --> 02:20:45,560
The crusher.
Quite hammered.

3330
02:20:45,910 --> 02:20:47,300
I'm not.
I'm first of all,

3331
02:20:47,301 --> 02:20:48,620
I'm the suburbs.
One in the whole room.

3332
02:20:48,621 --> 02:20:50,180
That's impossible.
No 100 percent.

3333
02:20:50,181 --> 02:20:53,780
Impossible or possible sound possible?
It's totally possible.

3334
02:20:53,781 --> 02:20:58,781
The person that says that the service 
person in the room is rarely sobers 

3335
02:20:58,781 --> 02:20:58,781
person in the room.
Let's do a protest.

3336
02:20:58,781 --> 02:20:59,000
All right.
Let's.

3337
02:20:59,010 --> 02:21:03,230
Do you want to do a google it?
Sober tests if you had a Dui?

3338
02:21:03,400 --> 02:21:04,640
Never will.
Listen,

3339
02:21:05,060 --> 02:21:07,090
I could do those things when I'm drunk.
Uh,

3340
02:21:07,460 --> 02:21:10,070
would you eat Rachel Ray's ass?
No.

3341
02:21:10,071 --> 02:21:12,220
Why are we doing Rachel Ray?
I would say

3342
02:21:12,390 --> 02:21:16,370
it's over time.
It's totally going to lose Brian.

3343
02:21:16,380 --> 02:21:19,350
So Brian is sober.
He's been cleared.

3344
02:21:19,980 --> 02:21:24,980
Please leave the room.
You are cleared me to left.

3345
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:27,860
This is like fucking heads up.
Poker.

3346
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:30,860
I'm all in.
I'm all in with my liver.

3347
02:21:30,890 --> 02:21:35,890
You're all in and you're stuttering.
Okay.

3348
02:21:37,291 --> 02:21:38,520
Congratulations.
By the way,

3349
02:21:38,521 --> 02:21:43,521
on the hurricane this weekend,
you will not be get having a show with 

3350
02:21:43,521 --> 02:21:44,650
Carlson.
Celia Mysia.

3351
02:21:44,690 --> 02:21:49,690
Joe,
you've been getting this wrong so many 

3352
02:21:49,690 --> 02:21:50,880
years.
It's been a whole lot of weight lately,

3353
02:21:50,881 --> 02:21:53,520
so maybe he needs to be called them Sia.
Yeah.

3354
02:21:53,521 --> 02:21:55,450
Maybe he's turned over a new leaf.
Yeah.

3355
02:21:55,770 --> 02:21:58,370
Maybe or all.
He's probably into Jujitsu.

3356
02:21:58,790 --> 02:22:00,330
Married woman's hearing

3357
02:22:00,810 --> 02:22:05,810
isn't a woman's urine.
HCG,

3358
02:22:07,410 --> 02:22:12,410
the Glendale.
And you've got to get the good pregnant 

3359
02:22:12,410 --> 02:22:14,360
woman's during the Mexican shit.
That's the strong stuff.

3360
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:20,700
Just a touch of Jalapeno in it.
Squirted into your mouth.

3361
02:22:22,300 --> 02:22:23,820
You just.
The weight just sheds.

3362
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:25,920
Appeals.
Yeah.

3363
02:22:26,980 --> 02:22:29,820
My favorite podcast ever.
I think it's my favorite.

3364
02:22:29,900 --> 02:22:31,720
I just want to do it sober one again.
All right,

3365
02:22:31,721 --> 02:22:32,330
now listen,
we can.

3366
02:22:32,380 --> 02:22:37,380
You just drank.
The last one we did drunk was Doug 

3367
02:22:37,380 --> 02:22:37,380
Stanhope.
That was like a great fucking.

3368
02:22:37,380 --> 02:22:38,230
Why don't you come back?
We needed that.

3369
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:41,580
We love to man before he shoots himself.
Oh,

3370
02:22:41,581 --> 02:22:45,420
that's just the show.
Doug's good.

3371
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:46,750
No,
it's sad watching that.

3372
02:22:47,250 --> 02:22:48,840
Although if he kills himself,
you know,

3373
02:22:48,841 --> 02:22:53,841
hunter s Thompson style,
when he decides that his body's falling 

3374
02:22:53,841 --> 02:22:53,841
apart,
I wouldn't be surprised.

3375
02:22:53,841 --> 02:22:55,560
But I think that's probably a really 
logical way to do it.

3376
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:57,630
Have you heard his podcast with Tom 
Rhodes?

3377
02:22:57,950 --> 02:23:01,060
Here's a hope.
He did a podcast with Tom Rhodes.

3378
02:23:01,090 --> 02:23:01,920
Really?
Uh,

3379
02:23:01,930 --> 02:23:02,590
it's,
I,

3380
02:23:02,610 --> 02:23:05,020
I just stumbled on it because I was 
going through this,

3381
02:23:05,050 --> 02:23:06,810
uh,
Tom Rhodes phase and I,

3382
02:23:07,730 --> 02:23:09,610
and I found it.
He,

3383
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:13,210
they date it is the most beautiful 
ending of a podcast I've ever heard.

3384
02:23:13,750 --> 02:23:18,750
They talk about taking mushrooms 
together and then thinking the earth 

3385
02:23:18,750 --> 02:23:20,050
who's going to spend them off and Tom 
Rhodes starts going,

3386
02:23:20,051 --> 02:23:25,051
yeah,
and this song was playing in the 

3387
02:23:25,051 --> 02:23:25,051
background and Doug was like,
it was,

3388
02:23:25,051 --> 02:23:28,531
and then I decided I didn't have the 
wherewithal to to get up and use the 

3389
02:23:28,531 --> 02:23:30,070
restrooms,
urinated in my pants and Bingo.

3390
02:23:30,071 --> 02:23:31,730
Took my pants and change me and Tom 
Rhodes,

3391
02:23:31,731 --> 02:23:33,730
he goes,
who was one of those beautiful moments?

3392
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:37,000
And then they start singing together 
together.

3393
02:23:37,210 --> 02:23:42,210
They start singing the song and it picks
up in the background and it's the most 

3394
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:44,950
awesome moment I've ever heard and I was
like,

3395
02:23:44,951 --> 02:23:46,120
it's so beautiful.

3396
02:23:46,210 --> 02:23:51,210
If you just go.
If you googled the podcast and you just 

3397
02:23:51,210 --> 02:23:54,070
hear,
don't listen to the whole thing because 

3398
02:23:54,070 --> 02:23:54,670
Tom Roses sometimes Tom Rhodes sometime 
mean I liked tom rose,

3399
02:23:54,671 --> 02:23:56,320
but like he tells doug,
he goes,

3400
02:23:56,321 --> 02:23:57,430
Doug,
what's going on with the stand up?

3401
02:23:57,431 --> 02:24:00,340
And Doug's has been drinking again and 
he's on an ambient in this podcast.

3402
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:02,580
And so.
And he,

3403
02:24:02,830 --> 02:24:04,510
he's been drinking a lot.
So he says at the beginning,

3404
02:24:04,511 --> 02:24:06,070
don't miss anything.
I'm saying because I don't know what I'm

3405
02:24:06,071 --> 02:24:11,071
fucking saying tonight.
And then Doug says he was dealt with 

3406
02:24:11,071 --> 02:24:11,071
standup.
Doug goes,

3407
02:24:11,071 --> 02:24:11,680
I'm fucking done.
I hate it.

3408
02:24:11,740 --> 02:24:14,200
I've done everything I'm doing.
I'm just rewriting the same jokes.

3409
02:24:14,201 --> 02:24:19,201
I'm a shill.
If I could just quit this and fucking 

3410
02:24:19,201 --> 02:24:19,201
never come back,
I'd do it tomorrow.

3411
02:24:19,201 --> 02:24:21,780
And then silent Tom goes,
so what do you like about my standup?

3412
02:24:30,610 --> 02:24:33,670
It was a fake question.
It's clear that there,

3413
02:24:33,671 --> 02:24:38,120
but just so fucking hammered in this 
podcast and if you add that,

3414
02:24:38,650 --> 02:24:41,900
that's how we should end today.
We should all sing a song together about

3415
02:24:42,070 --> 02:24:43,720
my standup.
That's the name of the song.

3416
02:24:46,870 --> 02:24:50,950
Are you guys in key?
I did.

3417
02:24:50,951 --> 02:24:55,951
Um,
I did mushrooms with Doug the day the 

3418
02:24:55,951 --> 02:24:55,951
war broke out the very day of we did,
you know,

3419
02:24:55,951 --> 02:24:58,690
it was breaking out.
We knew it was broken out,

3420
02:24:58,691 --> 02:25:01,630
so we decided to go out to the desert to
do drugs.

3421
02:25:04,390 --> 02:25:06,640
We went to a yawn,
Irvin's house.

3422
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:09,180
My man who was on this podcast,
we've ever done that.

3423
02:25:13,460 --> 02:25:16,560
Dan's a good guy.
Didn't work out,

3424
02:25:16,561 --> 02:25:19,560
but listen to thinking it was Aubrey 
Plaza.

3425
02:25:19,561 --> 02:25:23,710
I told Brian that,
who's the girl from 30 rock?

3426
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:24,550
Mark Marin

3427
02:25:24,550 --> 02:25:27,400
had interviewed.
I'll reply to you interviewed the Aubrey

3428
02:25:27,400 --> 02:25:32,400
Marcus.
I just saw Aubrey and read the 

3429
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:32,400
description on Marin's and I go to 30 
rock chick.

3430
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:35,080
I want to hear how I want to hear how 
joe deals with it before I go to Marin.

3431
02:25:35,190 --> 02:25:38,800
It's only here the jove version first 
because that'll be a little different.

3432
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:41,260
It's going to be all gossip.
Celebrity gossip.

3433
02:25:41,470 --> 02:25:43,330
Marin.
I want to hear how joe deals with it and

3434
02:25:43,331 --> 02:25:44,920
I hear it and it's operating.
That's a dude.

3435
02:25:44,921 --> 02:25:45,220
I go,
oh,

3436
02:25:45,221 --> 02:25:47,890
that must be the dude from from parks 
and recreation.

3437
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:48,640
And he's like,
yeah,

3438
02:25:48,641 --> 02:25:50,620
I changed my name.
I did all this Iowaska and I'm like,

3439
02:25:51,230 --> 02:25:52,810
fuck,
there's couple of balls.

3440
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:55,200
He's on NBC talking about going to 
Iowasca.

3441
02:25:55,201 --> 02:25:57,100
It's fucking driven as balls.
NBC.

3442
02:25:57,160 --> 02:25:59,370
He's on parks and recreation.
Oh,

3443
02:25:59,410 --> 02:26:01,710
that's funny.
You thought it was the whole podcast.

3444
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:02,620
I'm like,
man,

3445
02:26:02,621 --> 02:26:05,890
this guy is a deep motherfucker and then
I go to Marin's and it's a chick.

3446
02:26:05,891 --> 02:26:06,460
I go,
oh,

3447
02:26:06,490 --> 02:26:11,490
fucking different offerings.
But what you're saying about mushrooms 

3448
02:26:11,490 --> 02:26:11,970
and you and hope that we did it,

3449
02:26:12,090 --> 02:26:17,090
data war broke out.
We knew that the war with the United 

3450
02:26:17,090 --> 02:26:17,490
States was going to war on this 
particular day.

3451
02:26:17,491 --> 02:26:20,520
So we drove out to the desert with this 
dude lived.

3452
02:26:20,550 --> 02:26:24,240
We got blitzkrieg on machines.
We took a couple different kinds.

3453
02:26:24,510 --> 02:26:29,510
We started out with the Amanita 
[inaudible] area and then we moved our 

3454
02:26:29,510 --> 02:26:29,880
way into psilocybe cubensis.

3455
02:26:30,070 --> 02:26:31,210
Wait,
there's different mushrooms.

3456
02:26:31,240 --> 02:26:32,110
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3457
02:26:32,111 --> 02:26:34,390
The ammunition and Endeca.
Endeca.

3458
02:26:34,440 --> 02:26:36,130
What's,
what's the ones that grow on a cow?

3459
02:26:36,131 --> 02:26:36,370
Shit.

3460
02:26:36,480 --> 02:26:38,070
Those are [inaudible] cubensis 
mushrooms.

3461
02:26:38,071 --> 02:26:39,870
But there's different kinds of cubensis 
mushrooms.

3462
02:26:39,871 --> 02:26:42,030
There's a bunch of different species of 
psychedelic mushrooms,

3463
02:26:42,031 --> 02:26:46,830
including some that have no history or 
known history of human use,

3464
02:26:47,130 --> 02:26:52,130
their psychedelic chemicals that people 
that we don't even believe that people 

3465
02:26:52,130 --> 02:26:54,670
discovered like a Hawaiian baby.
Woodrow.

3466
02:26:54,780 --> 02:26:55,770
Um,
there's a,

3467
02:26:55,771 --> 02:27:00,771
I believe there's no evidence of human 
use of that until I really recently.

3468
02:27:01,110 --> 02:27:05,250
And it contains the same chemical 
compounds as Lsd,

3469
02:27:05,790 --> 02:27:06,810
a believer.
I'm,

3470
02:27:06,870 --> 02:27:07,220
yeah.
I'm,

3471
02:27:07,221 --> 02:27:09,570
I'm might be a little off on that.
Lysergic acid.

3472
02:27:09,571 --> 02:27:11,340
I know it's something to do with that 
and there,

3473
02:27:11,341 --> 02:27:14,040
but either way it's a very strong 
psychedelic compound,

3474
02:27:14,310 --> 02:27:16,470
but there's almost no history of human 
use,

3475
02:27:16,710 --> 02:27:19,860
so it was like one of those weird things
where people might have missed that one,

3476
02:27:19,910 --> 02:27:21,410
you know?
No,

3477
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:24,550
I can't do psychedelics anymore.
No.

3478
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:31,100
Why do you say that?
Because I know my brain the last time I 

3479
02:27:31,100 --> 02:27:33,830
keep saying that,
but let me tell you something that 

3480
02:27:33,830 --> 02:27:35,720
anybody tells me.
I know my brain is the number one 

3481
02:27:35,720 --> 02:27:39,351
candidate for a psychedelic experience 
because you say that you can't do 

3482
02:27:39,351 --> 02:27:39,570
psychedelics,
but you know your brain.

3483
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:44,600
What I.
What I hear is my ego has tricked me 

3484
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:47,481
into this position who are have stood my
ground and I'm terrified of anything 

3485
02:27:47,481 --> 02:27:48,600
really truly frightening and 
revolutionary,

3486
02:27:48,780 --> 02:27:52,020
so I'm going to operate by clearly 
defined,

3487
02:27:52,021 --> 02:27:57,021
predetermined pattern of behavior that I
find acceptable and I'm going to stick 

3488
02:27:57,021 --> 02:27:58,470
to that whenever anybody brings it up 
and then everybody brings it up.

3489
02:27:58,471 --> 02:27:59,130
I'm going to say,
well,

3490
02:27:59,131 --> 02:28:00,120
I know my brain,

3491
02:28:00,350 --> 02:28:02,790
and the last time you did it,
you did it before a show.

3492
02:28:03,480 --> 02:28:08,480
You can't.
You can't do shrooms in the show and 

3493
02:28:08,480 --> 02:28:10,151
didn't get work on a show,
and I was watching shadow people in the 

3494
02:28:10,151 --> 02:28:10,360
crowds and he's scared of shadow people.
Every time we shrooms,

3495
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:11,650
he.
I can't.

3496
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:12,440
I know.
I mean I could,

3497
02:28:12,470 --> 02:28:17,470
I could,
I could theoretically eat mushrooms if 

3498
02:28:17,470 --> 02:28:17,470
it was the right moment.
The right time.

3499
02:28:17,470 --> 02:28:17,990
Could 100 percent.
No,

3500
02:28:18,110 --> 02:28:20,670
but it would definitely need to be 
during the day,

3501
02:28:20,850 --> 02:28:23,510
like couldn't do it at night.
I'd never been able to do it at night.

3502
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:26,340
Heightened states of tension that are 
appropriate.

3503
02:28:26,430 --> 02:28:28,880
You know,
it's understandable if you're at war,

3504
02:28:28,900 --> 02:28:29,760
if you're,
you know,

3505
02:28:29,761 --> 02:28:32,340
you're hunting,
gathering your fucking chasing a deer,

3506
02:28:32,610 --> 02:28:36,720
but heightened stakes for no reason 
which you seem to acquire.

3507
02:28:36,810 --> 02:28:38,540
Yeah.
I don't know how to deal with them.

3508
02:28:38,790 --> 02:28:43,790
To me,
you look at the natural balance of a 

3509
02:28:43,790 --> 02:28:46,731
human being.
Genetically we have the same DNA as 

3510
02:28:46,731 --> 02:28:50,990
fucking people that live 10,000
years ago that were throwing pointed 

3511
02:28:50,990 --> 02:28:53,010
sticks at running animals.
We have the same Goddamn DNA yet we have

3512
02:28:53,011 --> 02:28:56,370
these bodies that we don't exercise.
We don't push them,

3513
02:28:56,520 --> 02:28:59,880
we don't make them do things and I think
there's a great deal of,

3514
02:28:59,881 --> 02:29:04,881
of,
of human tension and stress and and and 

3515
02:29:04,881 --> 02:29:06,960
imbalanced that comes from not taking 
care of your body,

3516
02:29:07,260 --> 02:29:12,260
that your body misfires and sends 
chemical signals that don't make sense 

3517
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:17,001
and it's confused and doesn't know how 
to handle itself and it's insecure and 

3518
02:29:17,001 --> 02:29:18,150
it's fucked up and it's weird because 
you don't understand it.

3519
02:29:18,151 --> 02:29:20,670
Exactly.
And that makes your body.

3520
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:25,080
Did it fucks with you,
it deceives you,

3521
02:29:25,320 --> 02:29:26,700
it throws you bad signal.

3522
02:29:27,080 --> 02:29:31,640
I'm afraid I'm afraid because when like 
my brain already fires by itself,

3523
02:29:31,700 --> 02:29:34,430
like it just starts saying things and I,
and I think we're comedy.

3524
02:29:34,460 --> 02:29:38,540
My comedy comes from at least and I'm 
afraid when like now I get to a point,

3525
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:43,560
this is where I was last time is we took
some mushrooms and I realized that the 

3526
02:29:43,881 --> 02:29:47,600
second I took them that I'm a father and
I was like,

3527
02:29:47,630 --> 02:29:52,630
what the fuck am I doing?
I can't get off the grid the way I did 

3528
02:29:52,630 --> 02:29:52,630
in college.
I can't just hop off the grid,

3529
02:29:52,630 --> 02:29:57,550
disappeared for six hours,
have a fun adventure down the itch and 

3530
02:29:57,550 --> 02:30:01,100
Tuck me like I'm a father who's fucking 
with not only my livelihood but the 

3531
02:30:01,911 --> 02:30:06,911
livelihood of my children,
like if I do pull a trigger in my head 

3532
02:30:06,911 --> 02:30:08,990
and I can't come back if something fucks
up in my head,

3533
02:30:09,290 --> 02:30:11,070
I have now ruined life for too long and 
that,

3534
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:13,490
that thought is what fucked me up for 
the night.

3535
02:30:13,910 --> 02:30:18,910
And then one of my buddies like,
fucking just get as drunk as you 

3536
02:30:18,910 --> 02:30:18,910
possibly can.
I was like,

3537
02:30:18,910 --> 02:30:18,910
alright,
that's what we'll do.

3538
02:30:18,910 --> 02:30:19,340
So.
But that.

3539
02:30:19,341 --> 02:30:24,341
And it was a fun night.
I had a great night after that when I 

3540
02:30:24,341 --> 02:30:24,341
was like,
fuck it,

3541
02:30:24,341 --> 02:30:24,530
I'll just keep drinking.
That's my biggest.

3542
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:26,270
That's my,
that's where my head.

3543
02:30:26,430 --> 02:30:28,310
It lives when it comes to psychedelics,

3544
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:31,470
will you talk to the wrong dude?
See if you were talking to me.

3545
02:30:32,120 --> 02:30:32,750
Oh,
I see.

3546
02:30:32,840 --> 02:30:37,840
Okay.
You're the kind of person that I would 

3547
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:37,840
be.
I would be fine.

3548
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:37,840
Um,
I would,

3549
02:30:38,420 --> 02:30:43,420
if I was going to do mushrooms again,
I would definitely want you to do it 

3550
02:30:43,420 --> 02:30:43,420
with you.

3551
02:30:43,420 --> 02:30:46,550
Even if you're not going to be okay,
it's eventually going to be okay.

3552
02:30:47,030 --> 02:30:48,670
I wouldn't remember that.
Remember,

3553
02:30:49,070 --> 02:30:50,990
I wouldn't even know what.
You're not going to be.

3554
02:30:50,991 --> 02:30:55,991
Okay.
You're eventually going to be okay 

3555
02:30:55,991 --> 02:30:56,780
because this is temporary.
Even if you're not going to be okay,

3556
02:30:57,080 --> 02:31:02,080
you're going to be okay.
I just want to get your deprivation 

3557
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:02,080
tank.
You can do it.

3558
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:05,860
Why wouldn't you do drugs with me?
Because I think you would freak me the 

3559
02:31:05,860 --> 02:31:05,860
fuck out.
Well,

3560
02:31:05,860 --> 02:31:09,630
just it'd be way too intense and you 
would scare the fuck out of me.

3561
02:31:09,801 --> 02:31:12,310
Like it'd be too intense for me.
Joey Diaz was scared.

3562
02:31:12,311 --> 02:31:14,960
The fuck could not do mushrooms to Joe 
and say,

3563
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:17,380
Oh,
I cannot deal with Joey.

3564
02:31:17,390 --> 02:31:19,680
Just all of a sudden snapping and 
yelling me for no reason.

3565
02:31:20,580 --> 02:31:23,370
Which by the way,
red already got mad at Brian when he was

3566
02:31:23,371 --> 02:31:25,100
on acid.
Serious?

3567
02:31:25,820 --> 02:31:26,160
Yeah.

3568
02:31:26,750 --> 02:31:27,860
Uh,
oh yeah.

3569
02:31:27,861 --> 02:31:29,870
I said at the UFC,
but he got he.

3570
02:31:29,990 --> 02:31:30,910
Joe,
you know,

3571
02:31:30,920 --> 02:31:33,650
I'm starting to think that I just don't 
mix well at Jewish people.

3572
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:39,040
Oh a great way to end or Hollywood.
Andy Dick on the line now.

3573
02:31:47,710 --> 02:31:48,420
Just kidding.
No,

3574
02:31:48,421 --> 02:31:53,421
I mean he's always mad at me,
I always rubbed me the wrong way and 

3575
02:31:53,421 --> 02:31:53,421
it's,
it's like,

3576
02:31:53,421 --> 02:31:58,180
because it already is a certain people 
that I always get along with and then 

3577
02:31:58,180 --> 02:32:00,400
there's people like Laurie who is 
already is already like,

3578
02:32:00,430 --> 02:32:01,290
and I will,
you know,

3579
02:32:01,610 --> 02:32:03,540
you know,
are a million ways better than I do,

3580
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:08,070
but I will definitely say that Ari is a 
different type of human being.

3581
02:32:08,130 --> 02:32:10,650
He told me the other day,
Tom Scott calls me.

3582
02:32:10,651 --> 02:32:15,651
He goes,
someone's telling that Tracy Morgan 

3583
02:32:15,651 --> 02:32:15,651
story that's working with already this 
weekend.

3584
02:32:15,651 --> 02:32:15,651
I said,
shut up.

3585
02:32:15,651 --> 02:32:20,450
I go,
what had already said already say to 

3586
02:32:20,450 --> 02:32:20,450
him.
He goes,

3587
02:32:20,450 --> 02:32:20,450
oh,
nothing.

3588
02:32:20,450 --> 02:32:20,450
I go,
wait.

3589
02:32:20,450 --> 02:32:23,601
So ours is working with a guy that was 
telling the Tracy Morgan story and he's 

3590
02:32:23,601 --> 02:32:23,601
saying some other celebrities tell him 
this,

3591
02:32:23,601 --> 02:32:28,280
but it really happened to me.
This art is working with the guy for 

3592
02:32:28,280 --> 02:32:28,280
fucking six shows.

3593
02:32:28,280 --> 02:32:29,640
Who is this guy?
It's a black comic and he told the whole

3594
02:32:29,641 --> 02:32:33,250
weekend,
I don't know the name because fucking he

3595
02:32:33,251 --> 02:32:35,970
doesn't know his name.
He worked with already the whole weekend

3596
02:32:35,971 --> 02:32:39,350
and told this story on stage.
Fucking sad.

3597
02:32:40,510 --> 02:32:41,730
He doesn't remember.
He goes,

3598
02:32:41,731 --> 02:32:42,930
I forget,
you know,

3599
02:32:42,931 --> 02:32:44,820
I was trying to work some fuzzy.
I was pretty high.

3600
02:32:44,821 --> 02:32:46,050
They had good.
We'd like,

3601
02:32:46,051 --> 02:32:48,660
it was just typical bar that I go,
I go,

3602
02:32:48,661 --> 02:32:51,180
how do you not like,
I love like if that,

3603
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:54,000
if someone was telling a story of or 
Joe's or yours,

3604
02:32:54,070 --> 02:32:58,080
the onstage,
I would be texting you tomorrow.

3605
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:00,270
But rhs was like,
well that's fucked up.

3606
02:33:01,090 --> 02:33:01,440
Okay.

3607
02:33:01,590 --> 02:33:04,410
Right.
People don't drink,

3608
02:33:04,411 --> 02:33:09,411
don't know how good food is because 
right now I've had a couple of periods 

3609
02:33:10,830 --> 02:33:15,830
right now.
I've had a couple of beers and I'm 

3610
02:33:15,830 --> 02:33:18,170
looking at the clock and I know in 10 
minutes [inaudible] in culver city 

3611
02:33:19,681 --> 02:33:24,681
closes.
We can't really make it unless we leave 

3612
02:33:24,681 --> 02:33:24,681
right now.

3613
02:33:24,681 --> 02:33:26,530
Now the only way to get a real sausage 
sub sausage with fucking sausage.

3614
02:33:26,670 --> 02:33:29,520
Tomato sauce.
Sausage and peppers in culver city.

3615
02:33:29,640 --> 02:33:30,450
Cavaradossi?
No,

3616
02:33:30,460 --> 02:33:31,980
not culver city.
Um,

3617
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:32,790
did I say culver city?

3618
02:33:32,990 --> 02:33:33,530
He did,
yeah,

3619
02:33:33,570 --> 02:33:35,160
he did.
I guess he was drunk.

3620
02:33:36,170 --> 02:33:38,130
What's his name?
Is M A,

3621
02:33:38,770 --> 02:33:42,770
a c might be chatsworth.
No.

3622
02:33:43,130 --> 02:33:43,330
Huh?

3623
02:33:45,090 --> 02:33:46,470
Canoga Park.
Canoga Park.

3624
02:33:47,130 --> 02:33:47,890
That's what it is

3625
02:33:50,140 --> 02:33:51,690
though.
Unfortunately.

3626
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:53,850
I'm fuck up.
That's blues man.

3627
02:33:54,270 --> 02:33:55,860
Dudes,
you don't know.

3628
02:33:56,130 --> 02:33:58,710
That's one of the things I love about 
bordain that eats treat food.

3629
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:01,740
He'd fucking fried sausage peppers on 
the side of the highway

3630
02:34:02,250 --> 02:34:04,710
and he doesn't.
I get terrified sometimes that I go,

3631
02:34:04,950 --> 02:34:06,580
Oh man,
I don't like you ever seen those.

3632
02:34:08,190 --> 02:34:10,740
It's always fucking terrified about 
something.

3633
02:34:11,860 --> 02:34:14,580
You get terrified about everything.
I wanted to stop.

3634
02:34:14,610 --> 02:34:15,930
I want it.
You wanted to start?

3635
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:21,080
I wanted to stop,
but I just like worried though that if 

3636
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:21,080
it stops the you're not going to be fun 
anymore.

3637
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:23,650
They wanted to put me on pills.
They said I had social anxiety disorder.

3638
02:34:23,980 --> 02:34:24,740
I was like,
I don't fucking,

3639
02:34:24,770 --> 02:34:26,560
I don't like that shit.
And they were like,

3640
02:34:26,561 --> 02:34:28,150
well we want to get you on a mood 
stabilizer.

3641
02:34:28,180 --> 02:34:31,390
Like one of those mood stable as a cola 
broke pill.

3642
02:34:31,660 --> 02:34:33,640
Yeah,
take away what makes you interesting?

3643
02:34:33,641 --> 02:34:38,641
Yeah.
It's the thing that like my brain works 

3644
02:34:38,641 --> 02:34:38,641
a certain way.
I'm cool with that.

3645
02:34:38,641 --> 02:34:39,280
My Wife's school that my kids are cool 
with it.

3646
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:41,500
My friend circle that,
if you don't know me,

3647
02:34:41,501 --> 02:34:43,910
it may be weird,
but I get it and I,

3648
02:34:43,970 --> 02:34:45,790
I fuck around and I,
you know,

3649
02:34:46,300 --> 02:34:49,450
I will test the boundaries of my mind,
but I definitely wouldn't.

3650
02:34:49,480 --> 02:34:50,920
I don't know.
It's good.

3651
02:34:50,921 --> 02:34:51,430
Your brain is

3652
02:34:51,540 --> 02:34:52,690
good.
This is different.

3653
02:34:53,020 --> 02:34:53,680
You know,
this,

3654
02:34:53,681 --> 02:34:58,681
I believe that there's a bunch different
components and ingredients that all put 

3655
02:34:59,111 --> 02:35:04,030
together to make everything including 
society and human beings and people have

3656
02:35:04,031 --> 02:35:09,031
to be different.
There has to be different kinds of 

3657
02:35:09,031 --> 02:35:10,891
people and you know,
and too much society wants to take 

3658
02:35:10,891 --> 02:35:12,650
people that really don't have problems.
They're just.

3659
02:35:12,730 --> 02:35:17,730
I mean everybody has problems but 
they're just fucking different and 

3660
02:35:17,730 --> 02:35:20,140
society wants to curve their edges and,
and,

3661
02:35:20,141 --> 02:35:25,141
and,
and straighten their curves and make 

3662
02:35:25,141 --> 02:35:25,141
them,
you know,

3663
02:35:25,141 --> 02:35:25,950
something that fits.
Yeah.

3664
02:35:25,960 --> 02:35:26,770
No,
and that's,

3665
02:35:26,830 --> 02:35:29,800
that's unfortunate man,
because the most brilliant people,

3666
02:35:29,801 --> 02:35:34,801
the most fun people in my life,
the Doug stand hopes and the Joey Diaz 

3667
02:35:34,801 --> 02:35:36,850
is and the burke crushers and you know,
all these people.

3668
02:35:37,010 --> 02:35:39,790
This life is richer because I know 
people like that.

3669
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:42,580
I liked the spontaneity.
All I keep thinking the whole time,

3670
02:35:42,930 --> 02:35:47,150
let's drink some pis like that's all 
that because of the.

3671
02:35:47,180 --> 02:35:49,670
Because we talked about.
I wonder how bad it is.

3672
02:35:49,671 --> 02:35:51,490
Like I'm just in the right mood.
Bad.

3673
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:52,790
Did you get your money?
No,

3674
02:35:52,791 --> 02:35:54,440
I don't want to drink your pitch.
Why not?

3675
02:35:54,660 --> 02:35:59,420
And you want me to go get some glasses?
Come on and bring it forward.

3676
02:35:59,670 --> 02:36:00,150
Drink.
Yeah,

3677
02:36:00,210 --> 02:36:01,880
we'll just trying to close.
Brian.

3678
02:36:01,881 --> 02:36:03,350
Scared.
There's no reason

3679
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:10,600
I'm taking a little trip to the man.
You just got to demand table.

3680
02:36:12,030 --> 02:36:13,020
We're talking about drinking.

3681
02:36:13,750 --> 02:36:15,450
Pulled his dick inside.
Like a little turtle.

3682
02:36:16,010 --> 02:36:21,010
I don't trust my own P and L.
No.

3683
02:36:21,080 --> 02:36:22,970
Just be beer.
He got scared.

3684
02:36:23,180 --> 02:36:24,440
Yeah.
It would just be straight beer.

3685
02:36:24,441 --> 02:36:25,670
You just be drinking warm curoil.

3686
02:36:26,730 --> 02:36:31,730
That's what I'm drinking right now.
I might as well just as far tonight.

3687
02:36:32,940 --> 02:36:35,590
Each other's faces,
but that's better brand.

3688
02:36:35,650 --> 02:36:36,880
I'm gonna.
Take you to a doctor.

3689
02:36:38,070 --> 02:36:39,990
Dr.
Burt's.

3690
02:36:39,991 --> 02:36:41,210
Okay.
But I think you fucked up.

3691
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:44,730
You might need those pills that he ran a
weekend to do Jujitsu class and it takes

3692
02:36:44,740 --> 02:36:45,400
them.
No,

3693
02:36:47,490 --> 02:36:52,490
Brian.
Brian is down for pregnant woman 

3694
02:36:52,490 --> 02:36:56,721
Jujitsu.
He's only compete with pregnant women 

3695
02:36:56,721 --> 02:36:58,100
because they don't really try that hard 
go.

3696
02:36:58,101 --> 02:36:59,310
Like when there's a baby here,
it's like,

3697
02:36:59,311 --> 02:37:00,270
okay,
so you're tapping.

3698
02:37:00,900 --> 02:37:05,900
Tapping right to have a baby in here.
Okay.

3699
02:37:08,100 --> 02:37:10,260
If you only had to fight a woman who was
like nine months pregnant,

3700
02:37:14,920 --> 02:37:16,030

Bert Dot com.
Okay.

3741
02:39:04,831 --> 02:39:08,790
And this is a documentary where a,
obviously after listening this podcast,

3742
02:39:08,791 --> 02:39:10,830
he realized that he needs to be 
followed,

3743
02:39:11,310 --> 02:39:14,090
so needs to fall part crusher.
It's just snow.

3744
02:39:14,130 --> 02:39:19,130
No two buts about it.
Thank you to a opie and Anthony who 

3745
02:39:19,130 --> 02:39:20,490
remained my friends and some of the 
coolest fucking people on radio.

3746
02:39:20,700 --> 02:39:22,990
I did live at the compound this,
uh,

3747
02:39:22,991 --> 02:39:24,090
the other night,
uh,

3748
02:39:24,110 --> 02:39:28,410
I was at home on a Saturday night or 
whatever the fuck it was and anthony was

3749
02:39:28,411 --> 02:39:31,890
doing his show and it was like 2:00
in the morning and in New York.

3750
02:39:31,891 --> 02:39:33,840
And so I called in and I was on their 
show.

3751
02:39:33,870 --> 02:39:35,370
I was on his show for like a half an 
hour.

3752
02:39:35,430 --> 02:39:36,120
Seriously?
Yeah,

3753
02:39:36,121 --> 02:39:36,380
yeah,
yeah.

3754
02:39:36,390 --> 02:39:38,640
He does a show in his basement.
That's how cool he is.

3755
02:39:38,850 --> 02:39:40,800
He,
even though he's on Opie and Anthony,

3756
02:39:40,980 --> 02:39:45,980
he does his own show from his fucking 
house and he's the inspiration for why 

3757
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:50,571
Brian and I chose to do this and why we 
started out doing it on ustream and 

3758
02:39:50,571 --> 02:39:53,430
doing it on a webcast brass craft.
Anyway,

3759
02:39:53,431 --> 02:39:54,930
it was really cool to do that.
Um,

3760
02:39:55,080 --> 02:40:00,060
thank you to everybody made the podcast 
number one out of all podcasts on itunes

3761
02:40:00,061 --> 02:40:03,840
this week that is seeing that the most 
downloaded podcast,

3762
02:40:03,841 --> 02:40:07,080
number one out of all the podcasts on 
itunes was crazy,

3763
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:10,530
seeing number one and number four was 
really crazy.

3764
02:40:10,570 --> 02:40:13,080
I can.
So we had number one and number four,

3765
02:40:13,230 --> 02:40:16,470

3768
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:22,920
And the reason why we love doing it is 
because you guys enjoy it.

3769
02:40:22,921 --> 02:40:24,990
If you guys weren't listening it would 
be absolutely useless.

3770
02:40:24,991 --> 02:40:27,840
And if we were just by ourselves,
we would run out of shit to talk about.

3771
02:40:27,841 --> 02:40:30,870
So thank you very much for Mr Kreischer,

3772

one of the coolest things about having 

3773
02:40:35,871 --> 02:40:37,230
this podcast is to be able to bring all 
of us together like this.

3774
02:40:37,640 --> 02:40:40,230
It's an amazing thing.
How much boy bitches.

3775
