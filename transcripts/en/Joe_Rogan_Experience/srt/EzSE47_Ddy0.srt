1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,770
Try My day,
Joe Rogan podcast by night,

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,230
all day.
I always find a way to get my shit

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,260
together and,
and dig myself out of a situations and

4
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:15,270
like,
and ultimately rise above beautiful as

5
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:20,271
long as you don't count on it right now
where I'm sick of getting in my own way

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,040
and like,
like UFC 200.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,780
Let's talk about that.
I literally what happened.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,730
I did everything that I could to be back
in the position to win that belt back.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,500
I was getting ready to show this
triumphant amazing story of someone who

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,790
she's made it through a hit and run
situation.

11
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:40,830
It had almost had everything taken from
them and got it all back.

12
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:41,730
And then,
um,

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,160
and then,
um,

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,090
I'm sorry,
I'm thinking about so many things at

15
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,150
once.
Might have been.

16
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,030
So let's just talk about what happened.
You,

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,040
you tested positive for some
estrogen inhibitors or blockers

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,900
yesterday and blockers that a lot of
people associate with people who take

19
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:06,730
steroids.
People take steroids and you want to

20
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:09,850
restart their system.
Or if you want a testosterone boost,

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,900
you take clomid or clomiphene and these
are,

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,160
these are standard drugs in the steroid
users world.

23
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,083
Yeah.
This is,

24
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,680
yeah.
All new for me.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,060
Yeah.
Um,

26
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,610
basically what did you take?
So I took a,

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,150
I took an offbrand Cialis bill off
brand.

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,000
It was,
it wasn't actual Cialis,

29
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,960
but it was described to me as being a
cialis.

30
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,720
And so I thought it was a Cialis and I,
I just took it.

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,530
So why is it guy like you need.
Seattle's have a huge God,

32
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,080
Jo.
It's too big.

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,200
It's too big.
It's a good answer.

34
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,150
We don't have the resources to get it
normally.

35
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,360
Just,
yeah.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,760
You know,
I um,

37
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,130
you were partying.
No,

38
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,030
it wasn't even necessarily party and
know I've taken like a melon hazmatt

39
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:00,710
before and for people who haven't taken
it,

40
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,480
you literally,
you know,

41
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:05,940
you go from being like that to just.
It puts the twist at the end of the

42
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:08,550
punch list at the end.
You know what I mean?

43
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:09,970
Is it like,
it,

44
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,263
it,
it's,

45
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,880
it's a good time,
you know,

46
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,090
it's a good time to be a quote.
That's a good time.

47
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,403
Now.
Um,

48
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,000
what was this like?
One of them's gas station,

49
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:23,360
right?

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,193
Pills.
Yeah.

51
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,920
No,
I had an edit teammate basically tells

52
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,360
me,
hey,

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,910
uh,
he was talking about how his

54
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:32,690
girlfriend's a pharmacist and he,
he's capable of getting all this stuff

55
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:34,430
and,
and all that type of stuff.

56
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:35,264
And I was like,
wow,

57
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,740
I don't do drugs or anything like that.
And he's like,

58
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,940
you ever take a seattle?
Yeah.

59
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,531
So I was like,
yeah.

60
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:42,700
He's like,
I got to see Alice.

61
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:43,361
And I was like,
well,

62
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,800
you said you don't do drugs or anything
like that,

63
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:46,960
but you would done drugs.
Well,

64
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:47,411
yeah.
Yeah.

65
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:48,790
But no,
he was talking about all these

66
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:53,791
painkillers and all this different shit
than other things on top of that he has

67
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:56,310
because his girlfriend's a pharmacist
and he was,

68
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,360
she getting this off brand stuff from.
It's like,

69
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,100
I don't know,
people get a lot

70
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,870
of stuff from China.
I mean that's what happened with

71
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:04,930
Anderson.
Anderson got liquid cialis from China

72
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,390
and it was tainted.
Look,

73
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:08,980
this happens.
I know for a fact that,

74
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,630
I mean everyone knows for a fact that
happens.

75
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,330
The,
the supplement industry has a giant

76
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,340
issue with the people that mix the
stuff,

77
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,670
like if you have a VAT and you're mixing
up whatever,

78
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:21,130
creatine or something like that and
right before,

79
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,380
I mean,
if this is done in some country or some

80
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:25,600
place that doesn't have excellent
standards,

81
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:29,470
it's not scrupulous.
You could be scooping up steroids in the

82
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:32,740
batch before that and you just throw the
creatine in it and some of it gets

83
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:34,510
contaminated if they don't clean it.
Yeah.

84
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:37,000
That's pretty much a while.
I'll get to that.

85
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:39,640
But.
So you take this off brand Seattle guys,

86
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:40,670
like do you ever.
You ever do

87
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,420
flaggers and all that stuff?
And I'm like,

88
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,120
yeah,
I've,

89
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,330
you know,
I've had melanoma pills before and he's

90
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:45,661
like,
oh,

91
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:46,710
I guess yeah.
I was like,

92
00:03:46,711 --> 00:03:47,341
oh,
this is great.

93
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:50,670
So I ended up taking one of the cialis
pills and um,

94
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,750
um,
and I thought everything was fine and

95
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:58,620
dandy.
I had no clue

96
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,240
what Ha,
you know,

97
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,350
that I,
that I was now having something else.

98
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:08,480
To me that was illegal.
I took her to the bill on June the 14th

99
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,420
of June,
16th.

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,900
Um,
you cited,

101
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,620
came over to my house 6:00 in the
morning.

102
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,150
Hey,
what's up guys?

103
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,910
That coffee going offer and everybody
water bottles.

104
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,170
Super Nice,
hospitable.

105
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:22,260
Come in,
laughing and joking with them.

106
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:25,740
I had no clue that that test was going
to be the test that derail my life.

107
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,350
And um,
you know,

108
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:32,610
right before UFC 200,
my manager now he calls me over to his

109
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:33,450
hotel room and he's like,
Hey,

110
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:34,880
I want to talk to you man,
like,

111
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,640
what's going on?

112
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,031
He's like,
Hey,

113
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:38,970
you're not going to be fighting.
Are you talking about?

114
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:39,960
He's like,
you know,

115
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,840
you didn't feel you didn't pass your
drug test and a,

116
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,700
the level of her and just and confusion
and I literally had an anxiety attack

117
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:52,560
and I had never had one of those before.
What does that feel like?

118
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,470
I felt like the whole room just came in
on me,

119
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,530
like the whole room came down on me and
I was just,

120
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,310
I couldn't breathe.
I remember opening up his hotel window

121
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,360
looking for a balcony so I could just
breathe and realize that I'm not

122
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,440
trapped.
Um,

123
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,970
there's a little window opened that much

124
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,860
so you don't trump hotel in vegas where
it was in Vegas.

125
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,490
Fucking freak and I'm breathing.
They don't want gamblers leaping through

126
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:20,720
the years

127
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,230
back in.
I'm breathing in through the thing,

128
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,900
calm myself down.
And um,

129
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,860
and I instantly started thinking about
the weight of the.

130
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,960
I had the weight of the world literally
on my back.

131
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:33,200
I knew that.
I knew that I wasn't going to be

132
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:35,370
fighting a few hours before everyone
else knew,

133
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,700
the public knew and I was just,
I could already start hearing

134
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,040
everything.
Even my uncle just been looking at me

135
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,310
like just their hearts were on the
floor.

136
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,370
Like I had done so much to get back to
fighting at UFC $200.

137
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,670
Like get my life in order,
getting the people around me in order to

138
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,680
my,
my health,

139
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:59,630
my mind,
you just being in order to beat DC.

140
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,530
And,
and like literally right now I've done

141
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,800
so much.
So much of the right things to be back

142
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:10,550
in a good position and right now now
people look at me as if I still don't

143
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:14,210
have my shit together,
but the only thing that I did was I took

144
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:15,270
a pill,
uh,

145
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,740
that I thought was gonna give me a boner
and it literally,

146
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,800
it's caused me a lot of heartache and a
lot of disappointment and a lot of just

147
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,080
threw me

148
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,590
here in any way,
shape or form.

149
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:28,930
When someone gives you this pill and you
don't know where it came from,

150
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,670
you don't know.
What did you think,

151
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,900
man?
I don't know what's in this.

152
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,271
No,
I didn't.

153
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,740
No,
I didn't think of it because,

154
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:37,470
um,
I had been dealing with the athletic

155
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:40,980
commission.
I've been in the UFC for a long time and

156
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:42,960
I've taken a little gas station,
take pills before,

157
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:43,771
like,
you know,

158
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:47,430
like,
and I've never felt the drug test ever.

159
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,160
Did you ever think that you might have
got lucky?

160
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,540
No,
I didn't think I got lucky.

161
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,000
I thought that you failed drug tests
when you're doing sketchy shit.

162
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,320
Right?
But didn't you think there might be some

163
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:56,970
sketchy shit?
And some Chinese,

164
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,950
no station Rhino,
Dick pill.

165
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,910
I,
I,

166
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:01,620
um,
what you know about the rhinos.

167
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,420
My friend Ryan,
my friend Brian called it,

168
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,190
he was on the,
on the podcast.

169
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,350
He said,
know John Likes to party.

170
00:07:07,351 --> 00:07:08,310
I bet he took one of them

171
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,323
pills.
Um,

172
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,510
no.
Um,

173
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,110
it's funny you called it.
Yeah.

174
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,030
Well he,
he was,

175
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,720
he was on.
I haven't,

176
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,730
I've taken them several times before.
And with the Nevada State Athletic

177
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,940
Commission,
I always pass my drug test and,

178
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,960
and I know that I would never do
anything to keep this sport,

179
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,330
have a lot of pride in my work ethic and
knowing that dude,

180
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,020
I've been skinny my whole career.
Whooping people's ass.

181
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:40,170
I'm not a knockout artist.
I wouldn't because I'm smart and you

182
00:07:40,171 --> 00:07:41,160
know,
I work hard.

183
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,550
Um,
but with you with the Knob,

184
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,430
Nevada Athletic Commission,
I never had an issue.

185
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:50,040
And then I was suspended when you
started came,

186
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,670
so I was never really educated on how
serious you shot a really was like,

187
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,950
I um,
I came back into the game and there's

188
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,291
like,
oh,

189
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,650
hey,
we've got this new company name and

190
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,150
Usada instead of Nevada.
What were you suspended for when you saw

191
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:06,600
the king?

192
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,970
Oh,
you mean when they come into the sport?

193
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:09,990
I understand what you saying.
You know,

194
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,450
when they came into your house.
So when you started came into the sport.

195
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,130
I was looking because my head right.
And so I never had even met anyone who

196
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:18,950
worked for your side.
I'd never been sat down.

197
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,570
I know you started seminar,
what to do and what not to do and how

198
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:23,400
serious it is and what could have it if
you do this.

199
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:26,160
And only thing I knew is I had to report
where I was at.

200
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,940
Like if I go to La for the weekend,
I got a little sad to know that I'm in

201
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:33,090
La because like a drug spent anytime.
That's the only thing I really knew

202
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:35,310
about Usada.
I didn't know that.

203
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,880
Doing something that I had done several
times before I could ultimately lose me

204
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:40,920
a fight.
So I'm.

205
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,510
The only difference was I had taken like
little gas station pills and I've taken

206
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,260
by Agora before this was,
this teammate gave me something that was

207
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:51,080
Seattle is.
I thought the only thing that it would

208
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:55,710
do is make me bigger and stronger for
longer.

209
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,150
That's all I thought it was going to be
happening and then when I find out that

210
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,920
that I just failed the drug test.

211
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,040
Do you know that via Viagara is actually
illegal in the Olympics.

212
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,400
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

213
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,560
You can't take that stuff.
The Viagra is a performance enhancer.

214
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,660
Vaso dilator,
I believe.

215
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:17,410
I believe that's how they describe it
and it actually has athletic performance

216
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:20,260
enhancing properties to it.
How does it,

217
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,670
how does it help you?
I don't know.

218
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,430
We'd have to look into that,
but I think it's similar in a lot of

219
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,890
ways to nitric oxide supplement.
Like a pro,

220
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,720
like a pre workout.
Get your.

221
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,083
Yeah.
Yeah.

222
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,340
It does something to open up your blood
cells and get you pumped.

223
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:35,140
I mean,
it does something not just to your Dick

224
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,490
but to all of your muscle.

225
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,750
Yeah.
I don't know if I would want it to be

226
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:41,450
pumped up during a fight.
I don't think it works that way.

227
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,131
I mean,
I don't.

228
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:45,530
I think it actually can possibly
potentially help endurance.

229
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,521
Well,
yeah,

230
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,580
I know,
but I know that athletes take it for

231
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:51,260
that reason.
That's why it's spanned from the

232
00:09:51,261 --> 00:09:52,160
Olympics.
Yeah.

233
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,503
But,
um,

234
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,670
but yeah,
you know,

235
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,590
I understand that it wasn't your
intention.

236
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,610
It was not my intention and I had no,
I had no clue that I needed to report

237
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:03,620
this to your side up because I thought,
you know,

238
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,330
literally I was reporting everything
else.

239
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,620
What supplements,
what a pre workout,

240
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,210
what,
you know,

241
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,720
my amino acids,
protein powder,

242
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,170
like you saw that had all my stuff.
And what happens once you find out?

243
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,120
Did you,
how'd you narrow it down to this pill?

244
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:22,060
I literally,
I went through my supplements and I um,

245
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,600
handed it to.

246
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,560
I hired a private lab in the lawyer and
we started handing it,

247
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,580
given them everything that I took,
which isn't really a lot of stuff at all

248
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,040
know stuff that everyone should take.
Fish oil,

249
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,560
basic basic supplements,
protein,

250
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,220
protein powder,
fish oil,

251
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,860
um,
you know,

252
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,170
liver cleanse that like or whatever.
I'm just grapeseed extract,

253
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:48,650
that kind of stuff.
Very multivitamins for men,

254
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,560
Beijing very basic stuff.
And um,

255
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,820
and then,
and then get nutrition is like,

256
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,540
you know,
we,

257
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,450
we've scanned all of our stuff.
We know it's not from that gut nutrition

258
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,890
website though,
was fucking hilarious.

259
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,230
Gat Nutrition website at the moment we
found out about it that someone said,

260
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,980
John sponsored by Gat Nutrition.
So we've,

261
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,080
oh,
let's check that out.

262
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,840
Get nutrition is some fucking dude.
As soon as

263
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,630
they have a lot of great,
great products,

264
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,630
but if you want to get big and strong
and you can definitely go to them.

265
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,910
But as soon as we saw that,
we were like,

266
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,490
what in the holy fuck is he taking?
Oh No,

267
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,260
I mean,
but people saw you.

268
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,500
You've got gigantic electronically.
Completely,

269
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,660
completely,
completely natural.

270
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,090
That's what I have great pride in being
a natural athlete.

271
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,940
But um,
but uh,

272
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,790
so they got,
they got all the cat stuff,

273
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,700
test it and clear,
right?

274
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,220
Everything was clear.
Um,

275
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,620
this gets to have other things that you
don't regulate.

276
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,660
Absolutely.
But the things that they gave me,

277
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,140
they're super smart about and uh,
out in all the products I was thinking

278
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,690
with clear and um,
and so my managers,

279
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,720
I think outside of the box I did you
take anything that could have possibly

280
00:11:58,721 --> 00:11:59,554
been.

281
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,700
And I was like,
I don't think so.

282
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:01,870
Then I was like,
well,

283
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:05,860
one of my teammates did give me this
pill and he's like,

284
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,700
I need those.
So where you got those pills tested and

285
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:12,430
sure enough,
they and their ingredients,

286
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:16,870
they listed about five products and
their ingredients.

287
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,960
And they actually are,
there's actually like seven products too

288
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,100
that weren't listed in the ingredients.
The two estrogen blockers were never in

289
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:28,280
their ingredients.
Um,

290
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,140
so,
um,

291
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,220
it was a tainted pill.
It would say what I'm saying.

292
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,750
Yes.
So,

293
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:38,200
um,
so the,

294
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,970
you,
you cited was able to tell,

295
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,800
okay,
this was totally inattention or there's

296
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:46,801
no engine,
no way in Hell I'm John would take these

297
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,690
estrogen blockers on purpose.
First of all,

298
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:52,180
it was very small traces,
so it wasn't like I was loaded up with

299
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:56,200
estrogen blockers and um,
why the fuck would they put estrogen

300
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:58,080
blockers and put them into digital?

301
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,780
We believe that,
uh,

302
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,870
the factory that created these,
uh,

303
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,590
these Dick Pills,
um,

304
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,330
were maybe manufacturing these pills in
a dirty laboratory,

305
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:09,400
whatever.
And because of this container just

306
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:10,211
tainted.
Yes,

307
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:12,970
because each pill that we,
that we had tested,

308
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
some of them had more estrogen blockers,
some had almost no estrogen blockers,

309
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:20,320
some head small traces.
Actually none of the pills were

310
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:22,060
consistent.
So it was obvious that.

311
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,730
And we,
we tested several different packages.

312
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,940
So it was obviously that,
that these pills were probably getting

313
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,090
made in the same machine and there was
just traces,

314
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,250
right?
Literally,

315
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,460
which is enough to show up in your
system.

316
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,910
When drug do.
We found some of these dick pills that

317
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:38,790
had none.
No estrogen blockers.

318
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,431
They're like,
damn,

319
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:40,810
why didn't I get that one?
Yeah,

320
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,190
exactly.
So I,

321
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,580
I took one that was just contaminated
enough and literally I got tested two

322
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:48,310
days later and it was in my system.

323
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,010
So it was,
it was obvious that it was complete

324
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:54,970
accident and even,
and even if I would have reported the

325
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:58,480
Deq pill to Usada,
they would have read the label and the

326
00:13:58,481 --> 00:14:01,240
label would have never said that it was
estrogen blocker in there and I still

327
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,960
would have had a dirty.
Right.

328
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,440
Good attachments contaminated.
Where does that leave you?

329
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:07,740
How much time did they suspend you for?
I got suspended for,

330
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,590
for a year back from starting from back
in July.

331
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,610
So now I fight in July of 2000.
I'd love you shot up.

332
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,140
I love what they're doing.
I don't agree with things like that.

333
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,040
I don't agree with things like that.
Because what you took does not enhance

334
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,090
your performance?
No,

335
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:24,400
it does.
It's especially in such a trace amount.

336
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,840
I feel like in certain circumstances,
like there's been several fighters like

337
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,290
Chad Mendez.
Um,

338
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,770
he has a,
I believe he has eczema.

339
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,440
He was taking an Eczema cream that had
some sort of a,

340
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,880
was it a hormone precursor or a hormone?
Peptide?

341
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:44,570
I believe some sort of a hormone
peptide.

342
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:49,571
I think that enhances the,
the use of this

343
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,710
preme.
I don't,

344
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,800
I don't know the full.
I'm

345
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,970
obviously not a doctor or a scientist,
but um,

346
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,360
there's something about suspending
someone for something like that.

347
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,223
That seems ridiculous.

348
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,940
Well,
in my situation they,

349
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,900
they,
the,

350
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,780
the evening you said his lawyer,
he showed,

351
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,880
he showed a little bit of remorse.
I could,

352
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,880
I could feel that he felt bad about what
was happening to me because I think he

353
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:16,160
could really,
even the arbitrators,

354
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,620
they could tell what had actually
happened,

355
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,730
but their problem was they said John was
just negligent.

356
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,580
Like you didn't,
you should have reported this pill,

357
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,700
but it seems to me that's silly.

358
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,170
But even if I were to report it the
pill,

359
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:33,690
they would've read the ingredients and
they would've never saw that there was a

360
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:36,540
trace of,
of something that wasn't advertised.

361
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,700
So why suspend someone for something
like,

362
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,421
because they,
they.

363
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:41,640
Because they said it was zero tolerance
policy.

364
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,690
It was just like I was the first fighter
to ever take them to into arbitration

365
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,280
and and they were more upset that I
didn't let them know that I took the

366
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:53,670
pill.
Then what actually happened was like the

367
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:57,180
rule is you tell us what you take and we
can point you in a different direction,

368
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,500
but I never told him what I took.
My whole argument was if I told you what

369
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:04,410
I took,
it still was never on the label.

370
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,540
Yeah,
so unless you guys were going to spend

371
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:10,470
all the money to take it to a private
lab or take it to a laboratory to test

372
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:12,450
this individual pill,
you get what I'm saying?

373
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,610
I still don't run into the same
situation.

374
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,840
I think it's great to protect people
from people that are cheating.

375
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,710
I don't think it's great to punish
someone for taking something that has a

376
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:24,920
trace amount of something that does them
absolutely no benefit whatsoever and

377
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:26,930
clearly.
And was it supposed to be in that bill

378
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,740
and wasn't supposed to be in that pill
and clearly wasn't being taken to

379
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,450
enhance athletic performance.
Right.

380
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,760
That seems silly.
It seems like a mess.

381
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,770
It seems like a mass that.
I mean,

382
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,840
I,
I understand there zero tolerance

383
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:40,160
policy.
I don't agree with it.

384
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:42,200
In this war of the Chad Mendez
situation,

385
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:42,980
you know,
there's,

386
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,580
there's weird ones like Yoel Romero.
He tested positive for something.

387
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:49,640
They found out that it was a in one of
the protein powders or something.

388
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,190
He was taken.
It wasn't supposed to be in there,

389
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,530
wasn't listed that way and they gave him
an abbreviated sentence.

390
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,460
You should have.
No,

391
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,720
no,
no part of it whatsoever.

392
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:02,390
But my whole thing is I'm so grateful.
I'm still optimistic,

393
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,600
man.
I'm always looking for light in every

394
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:06,434
situation

395
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,230
and I think that's the way I deal with
things.

396
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:12,390
I just am always trying.
I always believe there's going to be

397
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:13,260
good.
At the end of the day,

398
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,620
that's just how I am.
I'm just so grateful where most people

399
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:19,530
would be so upset with themselves and
all this type of stuff.

400
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:21,900
I'm really not.
I'm upset about the fans that are let

401
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:24,120
down who flew out to UFC 200 and things
like that,

402
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,810
but as far as the whole situation,
I'm just glad that that my,

403
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,840
my name will no longer be associated
with steroids.

404
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,820
Right.
Rather be vulnerable boy or whatever you

405
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:34,590
want to call me,
you know,

406
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,240
whatever you want to call me,
but steroids that that was really.

407
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,000
That was really bothering me,
so I'm just glad that it's out.

408
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,020
What actually happened.
