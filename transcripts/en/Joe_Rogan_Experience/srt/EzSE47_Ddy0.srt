1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,730
Drive by day Joe Rogan podcast by night
all day.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,650
I always find a way to get my shit
together and dig myself out of

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,630
situations and like ultimately rise
above situation.

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,470
Beautiful as long as you don't count on
it right now where I'm sick of getting

5
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:22,050
in my own way and like,
like UFC 200.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,780
Let's talk about that.
I literally what happened,

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,760
I did everything that I could to be back
in a position to win that belt back.

8
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:34,530
I was getting ready to show this
triumphant amazing story of someone who

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,840
she's made it through a hit and run
situation,

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,830
had almost had everything taken from
them and got it all back.

11
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:41,730
And then,
um,

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,160
and then,
um,

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,740
I'm sorry,
I have,

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,080
I'm,
I'm thinking about so many things at

15
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:49,914
once.
What happened?

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,633
Um,

17
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,030
so let's just talk about what happened.
You,

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,690
you tested

19
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,280
positive

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,050
for some
estrogen inhibitors,

21
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,640
Sgl blockers yesterday and blockers that
a lot of people associate with people

22
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:05,550
who take steroids,
right?

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,090
People take steroids,
they want to restart their system or if

24
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:13,091
you want to testosterone boost,
you take clomid or clomiphene and these

25
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:16,370
are,
these are standard drugs in the steroid

26
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:17,204
users world.

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,710
Yeah.
This is on new for me.

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,090
Yeah.
Um,

29
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,640
basically what did you take?
So I took a,

30
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:27,540
I took an offbrand cialis pill.
Offbrand it was,

31
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,420
it wasn't extra Cialis,
but it was described to me as being a

32
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:32,690
cialis.
And so I thought it was a Cialis and I,

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,390
I just took it.
So why does a guy like you need cialis?

34
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,770
Have a huge got jail that's too big.
It's too big.

35
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,903
That's a good answer.

36
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,050
Okay.

37
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,150
We don't have the resources to get it
normally.

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,460
Uh,
yeah.

39
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,770
You know,
I um,

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,280
you were of,
no,

41
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,880
it wasn't even necessarily a party and
no,

42
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,020
I,
I've taken like a melon harassment

43
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,630
before and for people who haven't taken
it and you literally,

44
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,600
you know,
you go from being like that to just,

45
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,610
it puts the twist at the end of the
punch list.

46
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,830
You know what I mean?
It,

47
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,080
it like,
it.

48
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,260
[inaudible]

49
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,880
it's a good time.
You know,

50
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,920
I had to go to be a quote.
It's a good time now.

51
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,020
What was this like?
One of them's gas station.

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,630
Rhino

53
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,463
pills?

54
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,920
No,
I had an edit teammate basically tell

55
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:27,371
me,
hey,

56
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:28,900
uh,
he was talking about how his

57
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:30,860
girlfriend's a pharmacist and,
and he,

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,950
he's capable of getting all this stuff
and,

59
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,780
and all that type of stuff.
And I was like,

60
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:36,100
wow,
I don't do,

61
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,730
I don't do drugs or anything like that.
And he's like,

62
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,410
you ever take a Seattle said?
I was like,

63
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:41,801
yeah.
He's like,

64
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:43,180
I got to Cialis.
And I was like,

65
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,440
well,
you said you don't do drugs or anything

66
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:46,240
like that,
but you would done drugs.

67
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,141
Well,
yeah,

68
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:47,741
yeah,
but no,

69
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:50,350
he was talking about all these
painkillers and all this different shit.

70
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,770
Other things on top that he has because
his girlfriend's a pharmacist and I,

71
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,050
and he was getting this off brand stuff
from,

72
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,440
it's like,
I dunno,

73
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,130
people get a lot

74
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,870
of stuff from China.
I mean that's what happened with

75
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:04,930
Anderson.
Anderson got liquid cialis from China

76
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,360
and it was tainted.
Yeah.

77
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,080
Look,
this happens.

78
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:10,130
I know for a fact,
and it mean everyone knows for a fact

79
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:13,330
that happens.
The supplement industry has a giant

80
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,340
issue with the people that mix the
stuff.

81
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,810
Like if you have a VAT and you're mixing
up whatever creatine or something like

82
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,130
that.
And right before,

83
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,380
I mean,
if this is done in some country or some

84
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:25,570
place,
it doesn't have excellent standards.

85
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:29,470
It's not scrupulous.
You could be scooping up steroids in the

86
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:32,740
batch before that and you just throw the
creatine in it and some of it gets

87
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:34,510
contaminated and they don't clean it.
Yeah,

88
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:36,030
that's pretty much,
uh,

89
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,030
log.
I'll get to that,

90
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:39,360
but okay.
So you take this off brand Cialis,

91
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:40,031
the guys like,
do you ever,

92
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:40,900
do you ever do less

93
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,420
flaggers and all that stuff?
And I'm like,

94
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,200
yeah,
I've,

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,570
you know,
I've,

96
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,480
I've had melly hairspray pills before
and he's like,

97
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,440
oh,
I got cialis.

98
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:46,861
And I'm like,
oh,

99
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:49,350
this is great.
So I ended up taking one of the cialis

100
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:50,730
pills and,
um,

101
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,750
um,
and I thought everything was fine and

102
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:58,620
dandy.
I had no clue.

103
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,870
Um,
what Ha,

104
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,681
you know,
that I,

105
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:05,160
that I was now having something else to
me that was illegal.

106
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,440
I took at the Seattle Spiel on June the
14th,

107
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,530
June 16th,
um,

108
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,650
you side came over to my house,
six o'clock in the morning.

109
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,180
Hey,
what's up guys?

110
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,880
That coffee going off her and everybody,
water bottles,

111
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,170
Super Nice,
hospitable,

112
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:20,230
come in,
um,

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,270
laughing and joking with them.
I had no clue that that's test was going

114
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:27,000
to be the test that derail my life.
And um,

115
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,940
you know,
right before UFC 200,

116
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,860
uh,
my manager mouth,

117
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:33,360
he calls me over to his hotel room and
he's like,

118
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:34,320
Hey,
I want to talk to you man,

119
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,590
and that what's going on?

120
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,031
And he's like,
Hey,

121
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:38,970
you're not going to be fighting.
What are you talking about?

122
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,961
It's like,
you know,

123
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:43,770
you didn't feel,
you didn't pass your drug test and uh,

124
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,260
the level of hurt and just,
and confusion and I literally had an

125
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:51,600
anxiety attack and I had never had one
of those before.

126
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,170
What does that feel like?
I felt like the whole room just came in

127
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:57,990
on me.
Like the whole room came down on me and

128
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:00,330
I was just,
I couldn't breathe.

129
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,840
I remember opening up his hotel window
looking for a balcony so I could just

130
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,200
breathe and realized that I'm like not
trapped.

131
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,230
Um,
there's little,

132
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,960
the window opened that much.

133
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,750
What the fuck?
So you don't jump out hotel in Vegas?

134
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:18,510
Where was it?
Vegas fucking brick and I'm breathing.

135
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,060
They don't want gamblers or sleeping

136
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,230
back in.
I'm breathing through the thing,

137
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,900
calm myself down.
And um,

138
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,860
and I instantly started thinking about
the weight of the,

139
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,960
I had the weight of the world literally
on my back.

140
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:33,210
I knew that,
I knew that I wasn't going to be

141
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:35,400
fighting a few hours before everyone
else knew.

142
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,700
The public knew and I was just,
I could already start hearing

143
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,470
everything.
Even my own coaches,

144
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,310
we're looking at me like just their
hearts were on the floor.

145
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,370
Like I had done so much to get back to
fighting at UFC 200,

146
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,540
like getting my life in order,
getting the people around me in order,

147
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,680
getting my head,
my health,

148
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:58,550
my mind.
You just being in order to,

149
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:03,530
to beat DC and,
and like literally right now I've done

150
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,830
so much,
so much of the right things to be back

151
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:08,450
in a good position.
And right now,

152
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,550
you know,
people look at me as if I still don't

153
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:14,210
have my shit together.
But the only thing that I did was I took

154
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:19,211
a pill that I thought was going to give
me a boner and literally it's caused me

155
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:23,150
a lot of heartache and a lot of
disappointment and a lot of,

156
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,680
and it just threw me

157
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,590
here in any way,
shape or form.

158
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:28,930
When someone gives you this pill and you
don't know where it came from,

159
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,670
you don't know.
What did you think,

160
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,900
man?
I don't know what's in this.

161
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,271
No,
I didn't.

162
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,740
No,
I didn't think of it because,

163
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:37,470
um,
I had been dealing with the athletic

164
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:40,980
commission.
I've been in the UFC for a long time and

165
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:42,930
I've taken a little gas station,
Dick Pills before,

166
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:43,770
like,
you know,

167
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:47,420
like,
and I've never felt the drug test ever.

168
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,590
But then you,
did you ever think that you might've

169
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,700
gotten lucky?
No,

170
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,040
I didn't think I got lucky.
I thought that you felt drug test when

171
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,000
you're doing sketchy shit.

172
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,320
Right.
But didn't you think there might be some

173
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:56,970
sketchy shit,
some Chinese,

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,290
no.
Station Rhino.

175
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,490
Dick pill.
I,

176
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,450
I,
um,

177
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,370
what do you know about the rhinos?
My friend Ryan,

178
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:04,320
my friend Brian called it,
he was on the,

179
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:06,030
on the podcast.
He said,

180
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,350
you know,
John Likes to party.

181
00:07:07,351 --> 00:07:08,430
I bet he took one of them.
Did

182
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,350
pills.
Um,

183
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,530
no.
Um,

184
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,420
that's funny.
He called it.

185
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,690
Yeah.
Well he,

186
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:14,640
he was,
he was on,

187
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,000
I haven't,
I've taken him several times before and

188
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,730
with the Nevada State Athletic
Commission,

189
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,950
um,
I always pass my drug test and,

190
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,960
and I know that I would never do
anything to cheat this sport.

191
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,280
I have a lot of pride in my work ethic
and knowing that dude,

192
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:36,150
I look,
I've been skinny my whole career,

193
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:38,010
whooping people's ass.
I'm not a knockout artist.

194
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:40,440
I wouldn't because I'm smart and you
know,

195
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,160
I work hard.
Um,

196
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,580
but with you,
with the nod,

197
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,430
Nevada athletic commission,
I never had an issue.

198
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:50,040
And then I was suspended when you cited
came.

199
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,380
So I was never really educated on how
serious you shot.

200
00:07:55,381 --> 00:08:00,381
It really was like I um,
I came back into the game and there's

201
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:01,411
like,
Oh hey,

202
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:04,360
we got this new company name and each
side of instead of Nevada.

203
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,550
What were you suspended for when you saw
the king?

204
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,970
Oh,
I'm into this sport.

205
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:10,950
I understand what you're saying.
When we came into your house,

206
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:14,550
so when you started came into the sport,
I was used to spend it because my hit

207
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:17,870
and run and so I never had even met
anyone who worked for you that I,

208
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:20,160
I'd never been sat down.
I know you signed a seminar,

209
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:22,920
what to do and what not to do and how
serious it is and what could happen if

210
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:24,900
you do this.
And only thing I knew it was I had to

211
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:28,320
report where I was at.
Like if I go to La for the weekend,

212
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:31,530
I got a little sad to know that I'm in
La because they can drug test me at

213
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,090
anytime.
That's the only thing I really knew

214
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:33,990
about.
You saw the,

215
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,350
I didn't know that doing something that
I had done several times before.

216
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:40,380
It could ultimately lose me a fight.
So,

217
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:43,470
um,
the only difference was I had taken like

218
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,440
little gas station pills aren't,
I've taken viagara before.

219
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,230
This was,
this teammate gave me something that was

220
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:54,120
Seattle is I thought the only thing that
it would do is make me bigger and

221
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:57,120
stronger for longer.
That's all I thought was going to be

222
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,020
happening.
Right.

223
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,150
I,
and then when I find out that,

224
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,920
that I had just failed the drug test.

225
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,040
Do you know that via Viagara is a
actually illegal in the Olympics?

226
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,770
I didn't know that.
You can't take that stuff.

227
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,830
The Viagra is a performance enhancer
though.

228
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:13,660
It's a Vasso dilator,
I believe.

229
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:17,410
I believe that's how they describe it.
And it actually has athletic performance

230
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:18,750
enhancing pro,
um,

231
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,260
properties to it.
How does it,

232
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,700
how does it help you?
I don't know.

233
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,130
We'd have to look into that,
but I think it,

234
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,660
it's similar to,
in a lot of ways to nitric oxide

235
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,970
supplement.
Like a PR,

236
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,720
like a pre workout.
Get your,

237
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,710
yeah.
Yeah.

238
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,340
I mean it does something to open up your
blood cells and get you pumped.

239
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:35,140
I mean,
it does something not just to your Dick,

240
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,490
but to all of your muscle.

241
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,610
Hmm.
Yeah.

242
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,040
I don't know if I would want it to be
pumped up during a fight.

243
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,720
I don't think it works that way.
I mean,

244
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:42,141
I don't,
I don't,

245
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:45,530
I think it actually can possibly
potentially help endurance.

246
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,511
Well,
yeah,

247
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,580
I know,
but I know that athletes take it for

248
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:51,260
that reason.
That's why it's banned from the

249
00:09:51,261 --> 00:09:52,120
Olympics.
Yeah.

250
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,503
But,
um,

251
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,670
but yeah,
you know,

252
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,590
I understand that it wasn't your
intention.

253
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,210
It was not my intention.
I had no,

254
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,990
I had no clue that I needed to report
this to your side of it because I

255
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:03,710
thought,
you know,

256
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,330
literally I was reporting everything
else.

257
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,050
What supplements,
what preworkout what,

258
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:10,430
you know,
my amino acids,

259
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,270
my protein powder,
like you saw it,

260
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,170
it had all my stuff.
And what happens once you find out?

261
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,120
Did you,
how'd you narrow it down to this pill?

262
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,560
I literally,
I went through my supplements and I,

263
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:23,550
um,
handed it to,

264
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,540
I hired that private lab in the lawyer
and we started handing it,

265
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,340
giving them everything that I took,
which isn't really a lot of stuff at

266
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:31,911
all.
You know,

267
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:34,040
stuff that everyone should take.
Fish oil,

268
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,960
basic,
basic supplements,

269
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:37,410
protein,
protein powder,

270
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,140
fish oil,
um,

271
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,230
you know,
liver cleanses or whatever.

272
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,680
I'm just grape seed extract,
that kind of stuff.

273
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,760
Yeah.
Just very,

274
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,650
you know,
multivitamins for men,

275
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,180
Beijing.
Very basic stuff.

276
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,560
Okay.
And um,

277
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,820
and then,
and then get nutrition and it's like,

278
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,540
you know,
we,

279
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,480
we've scanned all of our stuff.
We know it's not from that gut nutrition

280
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:00,890
website though.
It's fucking hilarious.

281
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,870
Got Nutrition website.
The moment we found out about it that

282
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,730
someone said,
John sponsored by Gat Nutrition.

283
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:06,151
So we've,
oh,

284
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:07,140
hey,
well let's check that out.

285
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,190
Get nutrition.
There's some fucking dude is,

286
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,840
they have a lot of great,
great products that you want to get big

287
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,640
and strong and then you can definitely
go to them,

288
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,560
you know?
But as soon as we saw that,

289
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:20,650
we were like,
what in the holy fuck is he taking?

290
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,560
Oh,
no,

291
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,281
no,
I mean,

292
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,410
but people saw you,
you got gigantic,

293
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:26,510
huge,
completely,

294
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:27,500
completely,
uh,

295
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,200
completely unnatural.
I,

296
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,100
that's what I have great pride in being
a natural athlete.

297
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,353
But,
um,

298
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,690
but uh,
so they got,

299
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,360
they got all the cat stuff,
test it and clear,

300
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,530
right.
Everything was clear.

301
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,920
Um,
this gets to have other things that you

302
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,230
saw don't regulate.
Absolutely.

303
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:48,800
But the things that they gave me they
were super smart about and I,

304
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,660
all the products I was thinking with
clear and um,

305
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,870
and so my manager was like,
think outside of the box.

306
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:59,140
Like did you take anything that could
have possibly been?

307
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,670
And I was like,
I don't think so.

308
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:01,870
Then I was like,
well,

309
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:04,630
one of my teammates did give me this,
this dick pill.

310
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,850
And he's like,
I need those.

311
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,270
So we got those pills tested and sure
enough,

312
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,300
they and their ingredients,
they listed about five products in their

313
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,670
ingredients and they actually,
uh,

314
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,840
there was actually like seven products
too that weren't listed in the

315
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:27,100
ingredients.
The two estrogen blockers were never in

316
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:28,690
their ingredients.
So,

317
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:30,850
um,
it was a tainted pill.

318
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,630
It was what I'm saying.
Yes.

319
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,260
So,
um,

320
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,330
so the [inaudible] was able to tell,
okay,

321
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,330
this was totally in attention or there's
no engine,

322
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:47,670
no way in Hell I'm John would take these
estrogen blockers and purpose.

323
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,680
First of all,
it was very small traces.

324
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:53,050
So it wasn't like I was loaded up with
estrogen blockers.

325
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,830
And why the fuck would they put estrogen
blockers out?

326
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,920
We believe that,
uh,

327
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,850
the factory that created these,
uh,

328
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,650
these Dick Pills,
um,

329
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,750
were maybe manufacturing these pills in
a dirty laboratory or whatever.

330
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,820
And there were because of this container
just tainted.

331
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,530
Yes.
Because each pill that we,

332
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,230
that we had tested,
some of them had more estrogen blocker,

333
00:13:16,231 --> 00:13:19,320
some had almost no estrogen blockers,
some had small traces.

334
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,860
Actually none of the pills were
consistent.

335
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:24,760
So it was obvious that when we started,
we tested several different packages.

336
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,940
So it was obviously that,
that these pills were probably getting

337
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,120
made in the same machine and there was
just traces,

338
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,910
which is to show up in your system.
We found some of these dick pills that

339
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:38,800
had none,
no estrogen blockers.

340
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:39,431
They're like,
damn,

341
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:40,810
why did I get that?
Yeah,

342
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,990
exactly.
So I took one that was just contaminated

343
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:48,310
enough and literally I got tested two
days later and it was in my system.

344
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,010
So it was,
it was obvious that it was complete

345
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:54,880
accident and even,
and even if I were to report it,

346
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,200
the Dick Pill to you side,
uh,

347
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,990
they would have read the label and the
label would,

348
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:01,900
it never said that it was extra blocker
in there and I still would have had a

349
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:04,710
dirty right.
Entertainment contaminated.

350
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,810
Where does that leave you?
How much time did they suspend you for?

351
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,110
I got suspended for,
for a year from starting from back in

352
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:13,420
July.
So now I find in July of two subs,

353
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,670
I love you shot up.
I love what they're doing.

354
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,280
I don't agree with things like that.
I don't agree with things like that.

355
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:21,820
Because what you took does not enhance
your performance.

356
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,391
No,
it doesn't.

357
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:27,370
It's especially in such a trace amount.
I feel like in certain circumstances,

358
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:29,920
like there's been several fighters like
Chad Mendez.

359
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,953
Um,
he has,

360
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,770
uh,
I believe he has eczema.

361
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,490
He was taking an Eczema cream that had
some sort of a,

362
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:40,910
was it a hormone precursor or a hormone?
Peptide?

363
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:44,540
I believe some sort of a hormone
peptide.

364
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,830
I think that enhances,
uh,

365
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,550
the,
the use of this

366
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,890
cream.
I don't,

367
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,800
I don't the full,
I'm

368
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:57,190
obviously not a doctor or a scientist,
but there's something about suspending

369
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,110
someone for something like that.
That seems ridiculous.

370
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,520
Yeah.
Well in my situation,

371
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:04,140
they,
they,

372
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,290
the,
the evening you start his lawyer,

373
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,690
he showed,
he showed a little bit of remorse.

374
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:12,550
I can,
I can feel that he felt bad about what

375
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:14,490
was happening to me cause I think he can
really,

376
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,190
even the arbitrators,
they could tell what had actually

377
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:21,980
happened,
but their problem was they said Janet

378
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,560
was just negligent.
Like you didn't,

379
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,570
you should have reported this pill.

380
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,500
But that's it seems to me that's silly.
That means that,

381
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,200
but even if I would have reported the
pill,

382
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:33,660
they would have read the ingredients and
they would've never saw that there was a

383
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:36,540
trace of,
of something that wasn't advertised.

384
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,473
So

385
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,620
spend someone for something like,

386
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,260
because they,
because they said it,

387
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,970
there was zero tolerance policy.
It was just like I was the first fighter

388
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:46,190
to ever take them to into arbitration
and,

389
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,510
and they were more upset that I didn't
let them know that I took the pill.

390
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:55,570
Then what actually happened was like the
rule is you tell us what you take and we

391
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:58,070
can point you in a different direction.
Right.

392
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,370
But I never told him when I took,
my whole argument was even if I told you

393
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:02,450
what I took,
right,

394
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,560
it's still was never on the label.
So unless you guys were going to spend

395
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:10,460
all the money to take it to a private
law or tickets to a laboratory to test

396
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:12,440
this individual pill,
you get what I'm saying?

397
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,600
I still don't ran into the same
situation.

398
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,840
I think it's great to protect people
from people that cheating.

399
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,710
I don't think it's great to punish
someone for taking something that has a

400
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:24,920
trace amount of something that does the
absolutely no benefit whatsoever and

401
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:27,890
clearly and wasn't supposed to be in
that pill and wasn't supposed to be in

402
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:32,090
that pill and clearly wasn't being taken
to enhance athletic performance.

403
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,440
Right.
That seems silly.

404
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,120
It seems like a mess.
Right?

405
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,770
It seems like a mass that,
I mean,

406
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:38,840
I,
I understand their zero tolerance

407
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:40,960
policy.
I don't agree with it in this war,

408
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,680
the Chad Mendez situation,
you know,

409
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,870
there's,
there's weird ones like Yoel Romero,

410
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,680
he tested positive for something.
They found out that it was a,

411
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,120
in one of the protein powders or
something he was taking,

412
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:53,240
it wasn't supposed to be in there.
It wasn't listed that way and they gave

413
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:54,530
him an abbreviated sentence.

414
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,730
He should have had no,
no,

415
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,830
no parts whatsoever.
But um,

416
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,210
I mean,
my whole thing,

417
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:00,800
Joe,
is I'm so grateful.

418
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,060
I'm still optimistic,
man.

419
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,290
I'm always looking for light in every
situation.

420
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,503
Um,

421
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,230
and I think that's the way I deal with
things.

422
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:11,430
I just,
I'm always trying.

423
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,260
I always believe there's going to be
good at the end of the day.

424
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,650
That's just how I am.
I'm just so grateful where most people

425
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:19,530
would be so upset with themselves and
all this type of stuff.

426
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:22,140
I'm really not,
I'm upset about the fans that I let down

427
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,120
who flew out to UFC 200 and things like
that.

428
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,080
But as far as the whole situation,
I'm just glad that that my ne,

429
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,840
my name would no longer be associated
with steroids.

430
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,420
I rather it be bowling or boy or
whatever you want to call me.

431
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,570
You know,
whatever you want to call me.

432
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:39,240
But steroids that that was,
that would have really,

433
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,060
that was really bothering me,
so I'm just glad that it's out.

434
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,020
What actually happened

435
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,840
[inaudible].
