1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,743
Is it working?

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,330
Is it live?
Says it's alive.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,010
Gregory,
we're live.

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,920
This is it.
This is it for.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,030
There's definitely more of an echo in 
this room.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,790
We're going to have to do some tweaking.
Ladies and gentlemen,

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,430
this is episode number one in the new 
spot.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,710
Oh,
Jamie's fucking up already.

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,990
Jesus does extra mics on.
I had all the mics on.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,060
Oh,
the mics are off now.

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,590
Oh,
that sounds bad.

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,580
Yeah.
It changed everything.

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,770
Yeah.
Your wizard.

14
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,990
How'd you notice?
You could feel it.

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,410
He could sense it in the room.
Should be behind a curtain.

16
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:44,120
Like the wizard of Oz.
Yeah.

17
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:46,130
What color was the wizard of Oz curtain?
It was green,

18
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:48,680
right?
Wasn't it?

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,150
Ain't no city,
right?

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,950
Yes.
Yeah,

21
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,700
right.
Emerald city.

22
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,620
Gregory.
Welcome.

23
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,920
I feel so happy to be here on the first 
episode.

24
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,700
Dude.
I'm honored.

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,290
I'm honored that you're number one.
Yeah.

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,641
Perfect.
Yeah,

27
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:03,710
this is perfect.
Fuck crazy.

28
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:06,590
Right?
He just gave me a tour of this place and

29
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:10,100
it's like I,
I saw the first half and was like,

30
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:12,140
what the fuck's he going to do with all 
this space?

31
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,840
The back half is bigger than the first 
half.

32
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,460
Well,
it's going to be a gym.

33
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,770
Yes.
An actual full gym.

34
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,500
I don't like going places.
Do it.

35
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:23,090
Alright here.
Catch your,

36
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,500
your tank.
Your sauna does a 47 yard indoor archery

37
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:28,334
range in here.

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,180
That's going to be bad ass.
Yeah.

39
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,373
It's why not fuck it.
But the big thing is to set up the 

40
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:40,100
studio and have it as close to the old 
one as possible.

41
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,993
We basically,
we built it sort of the only 

42
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:43,670
differences.
The Sky,

43
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,350
uh,
thanks to octo lights.

44
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:49,130
Now we have clouds in the sky instead of
stars.

45
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,340
Decided to mix it up a little bit,
changed the curtain color.

46
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,923
I love that.
It feels the same as the other one now 

47
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,163
pretty fucking soon.
The dimensions or are they exact 

48
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,840
dimensions?
Very close.

49
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,910
And this is,
this is a standalone.

50
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,450
I mean this was built so it was built to
the same size.

51
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:07,700
I mean this was,
this did not exist.

52
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,000
So this is all constructed.
Basically.

53
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,650
We just,
I had all these ideas like,

54
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:13,484
well I'll do it this way and I'll do it 
this way and I'll make a table that's 

55
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:15,870
different.

56
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,703
And then,
and then as time went on and I started 

57
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,090
doing the planning and everything,
I said,

58
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:21,100
do you know what?
I don't,

59
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,440
I don't think I want to change much at 
all.

60
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,540
Like this table,
first of all is giant.

61
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,740
Like I love this table and it's got all 
this weird history to it.

62
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,630
A little bend to it.
Yeah.

63
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:36,530
Well when we got it,
the wood hadn't been killed.

64
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,750
Killed dry.
Kiln dried.

65
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,673
Yeah.
Yeah.

66
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,873
So it wouldn't,
would sits out or it goes and where it 

67
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:42,824
gets damp and then when it dries out it 
starts to warp a little bit and change 

68
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:48,044
and shift.
So it's got a little warp to it at this 

69
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,670
desk.
Got History.

70
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,500
It's got history and the red brick wall 
looks exactly the same.

71
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,993
Pretty close.
Pretty close per Roland Cheney's over 

72
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:03,940
there.
And his spot,

73
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,400
it's pretty close.
I mean it's like it doesn't,

74
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,710
I have to remind myself that we're in a 
new spot.

75
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,970
That's perfect.
Yeah.

76
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,893
I mean,
after we do a few episodes here will be 

77
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:13,960
like,
oh,

78
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,310
it's just,
this is the spot.

79
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,690
I'm sure if I companion.
Yeah,

80
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,533
yeah.
Especially once the booze and starts 

81
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:19,954
again.
Once the boozing and the weeds start 

82
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,920
again in November.
How hard has that been for you?

83
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,840
Easy.
Super easy.

84
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,063
Like is he the other day went to Mexican
food and I wanted a Margarita and I 

85
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:30,250
went,
Damn,

86
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,120
I can't have a margaret.
Yeah,

87
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,043
that's it.
That's literally my only craving people 

88
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,220
talk to you about.
His initial thing wasn't quitting.

89
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:40,054
We'd write.
The initial thing was just getting Bert 

90
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,070
Kreischer to not die.
So like our idea was like,

91
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,230
let's see if we can get them to go sober
for a month.

92
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,921
Yeah.
And he was like,

93
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:48,910
I can run a marathon.
I'm like,

94
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,100
stop.
He fucked this.

95
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,360
You're not going to run a marathon.

96
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,891
Like,
listen,

97
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,930
how about instead of you running a 
marathon,

98
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:58,720
we just have you do 15 hot yoga classes.
And they're like,

99
00:03:58,721 --> 00:03:59,471
oh,
that'll be easy,

100
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:00,304
but she hasn't even done one yet.
You don't know if it's easy and now 

101
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:05,680
they're,
they're slogging away through like,

102
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,350
I think they're all like number six or 
seven.

103
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,560
Do we have video of a bird in a hot yoga
class?

104
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,430
No.
Video.

105
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,200
No,
but they,

106
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,150
they take videos after him and tom get 
out and they're both,

107
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,070
you know,
beet red and it's covered in sweat.

108
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:22,030
It's pretty obviously drenched,
but burdens done amazing.

109
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:22,864
First of all,
his blood pressure has dropped 

110
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:24,994
radically.
He was actually on high blood pressure 

111
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:27,934
medication and after this,
after stopping drinking just 

112
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:34,550
immediately,
his blood pressure dropped radically.

113
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,473
Yeah.
So like he doesn't even need blood 

114
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:39,490
pressure medication if he doesn't drink,
that's amazing.

115
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,500
It's the only thing that's doing them in
is the booze.

116
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,760
Right.
So,

117
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,053
and then.
But people would come up to me about 

118
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:45,514
the,
we'd see the weed wasn't in the 

119
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:48,580
original.
The original bet was just no booze,

120
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,370
which I thought would be pretty easy.
And then they're like,

121
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,091
all right,
we're going to go,

122
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,230
no,
no weed too.

123
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,011
And I was like,
no,

124
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,240
weed,
fuck you.

125
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,730
Like I'm just doing this for Bert.
Like I don't want to stop.

126
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,860
And then they were giving me a hard time
about it.

127
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:03,220
They started this Hashtag pray for Joe 
Campaign because I was addicted to pot,

128
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,550
so I initially thought I'll just get off
weed and not tell them until the end and

129
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:10,080
go.
It was fucking easy.

130
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,923
Pussies.
Yeah.

131
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,360
But then our,
he was making such a big deal out of it.

132
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:14,200
I would say.
Actually,

133
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,700
dude,
I'm not smoking pot either,

134
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,990
just to let the cat out of the bag.

135
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,590
Tom Ziglar already knew.
But people would come up to you like,

136
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,710
like you're not eating for a month like 
you.

137
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:23,501
Okay.
Yeah.

138
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:24,191
Right,
right.

139
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,920
How do you feel you,
you off heroin for good.

140
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,900
You know,
but it's such a part of it for you is it

141
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:34,020
never seemed like an addiction.
Drugs to,

142
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,013
for my vision of you doing drugs.
It's always mind expanding and it's 

143
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:42,910
always just to relax.
It's never like an addiction.

144
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:43,744
It never felt like you needed to.
I definitely don't need it obviously 

145
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,163
because I've had some great sets too,
which has been very interesting because 

146
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:50,640
I usually like to go on state.
Hi.

147
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,600
I haven't done that at all though.
No,

148
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:56,710
no pot for 17 days.
Today is what's today?

149
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,453
Seventeenth.
So no pot for 17 days or do you miss it 

150
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:03,590
the most before going on?
No,

151
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,450
I haven't missed it.
Wow.

152
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,343
It's been weird.

153
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,293
I was like,
maybe there's going gonna be a moment 

154
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:08,421
where like,
wow,

155
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:09,254
I'd like to have some weird.
I'm a little nervous about smoking 

156
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:11,920
again.
Yeah,

157
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,913
because I know I'm going to get so high 
that I'm be so paranoid and all these 

158
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,830
demons are going to come creeping up 
into my consciousness.

159
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:22,831
He gets paranoid psychic demons.
It is going to come floating by.

160
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,560
It's like that first orgasm after you 
get your prostate removed.

161
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,790
Yeah man.
For Real.

162
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,900
You know,
like once,

163
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,290
once you're back,
you know,

164
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,124
it's just,
it just seems like it seems like it's 

165
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,720
going to hit you way,
way,

166
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:40,510
way harder.
Right?

167
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,353
That's what everybody says.
You take a month off and then you get 

168
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:43,904
back on the pot.
Then you know why everybody freaks out 

169
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,500
when you get them high.
You know,

170
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,180
because we're so used to getting high 
that will we get high.

171
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:51,014
It's no big deal,
but when people don't get high and 

172
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:53,741
they're like,
oh,

173
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:56,520
I'll smoke a little weed with you,
but they haven't smoked pot.

174
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,890
Maybe like six months or something like 
that.

175
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:59,360
Yeah.
Those people are fucked.

176
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,740
Right?
They're in a bad place.

177
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,380
Yeah.
I get a nice easy rhythm going.

178
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,590
I got the little vape pen and I'm seeing
when I'm on the road,

179
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,860
you know,
Thursday,

180
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:10,870
Friday night couple

181
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,650
hits and that's pretty much it.
And you never do it before shows,

182
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,760
right?
Never,

183
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,410
never,
ever.

184
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,160
And you took a long time.
Like when,

185
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,930
when I first met you,
we back in the day,

186
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,690
um,
when we first started out you would just

187
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:28,030
quit boots.
Just quit.

188
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,400
And you weren't doing nothing.
No Pot,

189
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:31,600
no booze,
no nothing.

190
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,560
Like what was it that made you realize I
could smoke a little weed?

191
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,260
It was New Year's eve of 2004.
Whoa.

192
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,590
So I had not smoked pot for 14 years or 
drank or anything.

193
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,770
And then I'm standing outside of the 
Improv in San Francisco and I'm with,

194
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,903
I won't mention the manager's name,
but it manager who smokes a lot of pot 

195
00:07:58,161 --> 00:07:58,994
that we all know and love and the entire
cast of the marijuana logs this Doug 

196
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,460
Benson,
Tony,

197
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:05,294
a comedian,
and I'm Brian Hossein and they're all 

198
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:11,510
there.
It's just like a weird thing where,

199
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:12,344
you know,
I don't know if you've ever done New 

200
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,083
Year's eve in San Francisco,
but there's like three different venues 

201
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:17,570
that all do comedy,
you know,

202
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,430
there's cops,
there's the punchline and then there's a

203
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:22,730
big theater that the pal,
a the palace of fine arts or whatever.

204
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,073
And then there's an after party at the 
punchline and it's the greatest after 

205
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,374
party because usually go on the road and
after your show you're just kind of 

206
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:31,550
alone.

207
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,830
Maybe you got your opener or whatever 
and you hang out.

208
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,480
But this is always like,
you know,

209
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,500
every Comic Sans Francisco comes 
together and I'm standing up front and,

210
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:41,720
and they're standing there with a joint.
They hand it to me and I just,

211
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,200
I felt like this is the moment I'm 
supposed to smoke pot again.

212
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,350
And I did.
And uh,

213
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:54,150
and then the weirdest fucking thing 
happened is I went down to help molly,

214
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,290
you know,
she had a,

215
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,124
um,
the van coming from the palace and she 

216
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:59,184
had a box of booze that had been the 
backstage bar and she's carrying a 

217
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:08,871
bottle of vodka and she's walking 
towards the steps and this group we were

218
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:13,080
talking about San Francisco homeless 
people before group of like,

219
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,943
you know,
they're like 21 and they're like street 

220
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:17,520
urchins there.
Like,

221
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:18,570
you know,
it's almost like,

222
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,270
yeah,
the warrior has come out.

223
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,320
It's like that type of person.
And they grabbed the bottle of booze out

224
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:28,710
of molly's hand and I'm standing there 
with Todd Barry,

225
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,170
Paula Tompkins.
And like,

226
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,750
I think Greg proops is like two guys in 
suits.

227
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,380
And so they grabbed this bottle from 
molly and she chases after them.

228
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,660
I'm like,
what the fuck are you doing this?

229
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,280
Not your booze.
It's the clubs,

230
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,250
booze.
And she runs right in the middle of them

231
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,970
and they,
uh,

232
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,823
she grabs a bottle and she's fighting 
with this woman over it and these guys 

233
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:56,130
are surrounding her and I run in and I 
grab her and start pulling her out.

234
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,620
But at the same time,
guys a fist cocked,

235
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,460
waiting to take a shot at me and I'm 
yelling to these guys,

236
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,443
hey,
how about a little help here and 

237
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,630
nothing.
And so,

238
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:07,464
uh,
I kind of pull her out of there and we 

239
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:10,890
have runaway.

240
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,040
And then as we're walking up the stairs,
they threw a blockbuster and m,

241
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:16,874
a o Jesus.
And it landed right near us and it blew 

242
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:23,610
out o and m,
there was lesbian.

243
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,300
I don't know what that means is a 
firecracker hold.

244
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,620
We're super bits and eighth of a stick 
of dynamite isn't really that.

245
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,920
That's what an mat is.
Jesus Christ.

246
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,110
I didn't know it was that powerful.
Yeah.

247
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,160
I mean you feel it in your chest and a 
blue out molly's hearing for like a year

248
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,350
and a people were crying.
It was like really traumatic.

249
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,060
And I'm high.
I'm like,

250
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:50,061
this is the fucking war.
After 14 years I was just like,

251
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,480
fuck,
this is nuts.

252
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,690
I was walking the girl back to the hotel
because she was sobbing.

253
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,730
I wasn't tig.
It was a,

254
00:10:56,731 --> 00:11:00,540
it was a lesbian comedian who had a 
girlfriend with her and uh,

255
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,580
yeah,
it was fucking crazy.

256
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,980
Whoa.
Yeah.

257
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,713
Yeah.
We were talking about how San Francisco 

258
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:09,580
is just a little bit too lenient with 
their homeless population.

259
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,423
There were just a little silly with it 
and we were talking about how they have 

260
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:16,550
it mapped out where people shit in the 
streets now.

261
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,490
So you could avoid human shit.
Yeah.

262
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,880
It's either a website or an APP.
I'm not sure which one it is,

263
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:23,714
but they,
they're basically keeping up to date 

264
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,140
human poo stats.

265
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,260
How do they know it's human versus dog?
Probably smells worse.

266
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,520
People are growing a little toilet paper
next to it.

267
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:34,750
Okay.
Dog

268
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,280
Shit all over the house last night.
My dogs.

269
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,280
I have a young dog and two old dogs.
Right?

270
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,170
And my big old dog is a massive and he's
super cool with every dog.

271
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,240
And the dog comes over who are doing.
Yeah,

272
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,133
he's super friendly,
but my little dog is kind of a twat 

273
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,130
something going on with the lights.

274
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,370
Well,
it just dim.

275
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,760
Oh,
they're turning off.

276
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,910
Scary.
Scary.

277
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:03,040
Spooky.
What kind of dog is the little dog?

278
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,360
What does that Jamie.
The motion sensor fire.

279
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,230
We're getting everyplace.
Oh,

280
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:11,170
so things were not here.
How do we fix that?

281
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,050
That's dumb.
Okay.

282
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,150
Anyway,
the little dog is a.

283
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,890
he's not that little.
He's a medium sized dog.

284
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,110
He's a Shiba Inu English bulldog mix,
right.

285
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,560
Nice.
And uh,

286
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:25,990
he has,
um,

287
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,140
he has an issue with any dark.
He's a little cunt,

288
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:34,060
like any dogs or her.
And the poppy is 11 months old.

289
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:37,360
I have a golden retriever.
He's the sweetest dog in the world.

290
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,970
He's the best,
but he can't go near the bulldog.

291
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,730
Bulldog beat him in his face when he was
a puppy.

292
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,500
No Shit really hurt.
I'm like,

293
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:49,501
put a big cut in his nose to the vet.
It was so to have the dogs sleep in this

294
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:55,510
one little contained area,
but they opened up the door and wandered

295
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:59,080
around the house and just took a shit in
the middle of the living room,

296
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:03,370
pissed on the wall and they did all this
because the other dogs in the house,

297
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,630
the other dogs.

298
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,221
And they're like,
well,

299
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:06,054
if he's in here,
we're just going to shit all over the 

300
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,800
place and mark this place up.
They never,

301
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,723
never done that before.
So it was really interesting like dog 

302
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:16,720
psychology.
Like they were pissed that the other dog

303
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,583
gets to be in better spots than them.
So they decided to shit in the living 

304
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:21,910
room.
Wow.

305
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,970
That's a statement.
Their statement,

306
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,160
you know it.
It's funny because the big one,

307
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,580
I could have him with the new dog.
No problem.

308
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,530
He's,
he loves them,

309
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,780
they play together.
He has a great time,

310
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:40,180
but I just don't trust that other one.
So what are you going to do?

311
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,810
Shoot the other one in the head hunting 
accident?

312
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,280
Uh,
just keep them separated.

313
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:48,840
I mean,
I,

314
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,010
I can have morale and together when I'm 
there,

315
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,253
you know,
he just,

316
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,610
he's a cool dog.
He likes people.

317
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,290
He loves people.
Like people come over,

318
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,200
he loves you.
He's,

319
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,930
he's a very sweet dog.
He just doesn't.

320
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,940
It's apparently an English bulldog 
trait.

321
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,180
They just do not like other dogs.
They just don't.

322
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,120
They want dogs and they and they have a 
lot of health issues.

323
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:11,470
Say fucking wheeze.
He's had two surgeries on his knees.

324
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,450
Both his front knees are fucked up.
He's just got like,

325
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,640
they just,
it's a terrible thing what they've done.

326
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,593
Designing them like that,
taking them and putting them into this 

327
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,970
shape that it's really not supposed to 
exist.

328
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,833
Shortening their nose.
It's like it's really fucked up what 

329
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:29,320
they've done.
Yeah,

330
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,230
just hit that breed may need to be put 
down.

331
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,630
Lots of.
It's weird.

332
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,643
Like why?
Why did anybody decide to have a dog 

333
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:39,580
that has a flat face?
It can't breathe.

334
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:41,330
You can't walk very good.
They just,

335
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,750
they're always in pain,
so they just want to lie down.

336
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,450
Like those dogs aren't done on ball 
chasers.

337
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,050
You throw a ball to an English bulldog.
He's like,

338
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,550
fuck off,
I'm not running after that thing.

339
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,070
Everything hurts.
They just waddle everywhere.

340
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,410
You know?
It's weird because the original bull dog

341
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,720
was a dog that they literally used to 
use for what they call bull baiting with

342
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:06,344
bull baiting is they would tie a bull 
down and so it couldn't go anywhere and 

343
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,610
then they would sic the dogs on the 
bowl.

344
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,720
That's what a bulldog.
Yeah,

345
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,990
it's like sport.
What was the point of that?

346
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,240
I don't know,
just to fuck with the ball.

347
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,620
I'd have to look into it.
No,

348
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,140
I think it was like a betting thing,
you know,

349
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:29,141
so like a bloodsport thing.
That's originally what a bull dog looked

350
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,113
like.
Do you know what American bulldog looks 

351
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,264
like now?
American bulldog is like sort of pit 

352
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:35,624
bull ask,
but larger much larger American bulldog 

353
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,930
has got kind of a pit bull,
like face,

354
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,370
sort of a flat nose,
but nothing like an English bulldog.

355
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,500
They're really smart dogs.
They're very good dogs.

356
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:52,430
Like a buddy of mine had one and it was 
great dog there.

357
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,240
Tanks filled like this big jacked up 
like,

358
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,430
but a totally functional dog.
They run,

359
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,300
they use them for protection,
they,

360
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:00,980
you know,
they're,

361
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,480
they're just really good dogs and the 
English version of them is like,

362
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,050
what that dog is like.
I might be fucking this up,

363
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:14,051
but I think they took the dog and 
somehow or another bread it down to this

364
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:18,170
really gross,
cute fat flat nose,

365
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:19,004
shitty breathing English bulldog.
Did they want it to look like the royal 

366
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:27,311
family had the sisters only fuck your 
sister only fuck your sister.

367
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,290
And then they took those properties.
No,

368
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:30,530
no,
no,

369
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,160
you can't.
Fuck you.

370
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,450
Fuck your sister.
Okay.

371
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,560
And then the baby's fuck each other.
Your baby's fucking each other.

372
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,970
I'm fine.
And as Irish just,

373
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:42,420
I don't know,
just,

374
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,240
it's weird that they all came from 
wolves.

375
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,880
You know,
a wolf could fucking English bulldog and

376
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,860
get it pregnant.
That's what's incredible.

377
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,813
It's like the shit.
The genetics are the same and they 

378
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:56,090
didn't know this until like I say,
I want to say less than a decade ago.

379
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,740
They used to think that all wolves were 
like wolves.

380
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,633
And then dogs.
We're like a combination of a bunch of 

381
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:04,754
different things while candidates like 
jackals and coyotes and all these 

382
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:09,764
different things and that we had somehow
or another bread them down because 

383
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:15,950
there's no real record of how anybody 
ever did that.

384
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,910
And if you go back to the history of 
domesticated dogs spans over 10,000

385
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,800
years.
So it predates human history.

386
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,650
We don't really don't know how the fuck 
anybody made a Chihuahua.

387
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,663
We just know that it's Chihuahuas.
I know that the first domesticated dogs 

388
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:33,020
were the ones that basically we're,
we're,

389
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,270
you know,
docile.

390
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,930
They could come near the fire.
Yes.

391
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,500
And so the ones that were friendlier and
nicer,

392
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,630
captain,
they killed the other ones.

393
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,360
I put up a picture on instagram 
yesterday,

394
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:47,540
a re posted.
So he sent me with this fucking lady,

395
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,553
found a,
a young coyote and she thought it was a 

396
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:51,720
dog and she washed it

397
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,970
and they put it up on facebook and she,
it's kind of aggressive,

398
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,233
but now it's sleeping and it's like a 
little coyote and this lady's washing a 

399
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:03,650
fucking chaos.
Just writing.

400
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,070
It's kind of a period that just fucking 
lunges at attacks are.

401
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,300
There it is.
Look at that Chamberlain road.

402
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,130
No collar.
Seems a bit aggressive.

403
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,440
Also doesn't like bass,
but she was pretty dirty.

404
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,630
Took,
took most of the night,

405
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,690
but she's resting comfy now on the bed.
Look at that thing.

406
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:31,691
That is a fucking coyote obviously,
and it's obviously a little one too.

407
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,970
It's probably a young one,
like a yearling or something.

408
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:37,040
Yeah.
You can't domesticate a coyote,

409
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,530
but you can in a weird way.
I know a guy

410
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,850
who,
well I don't know him,

411
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,640
but I follow his instagram account.
I forget his name,

412
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,370
Shit.
But anyway,

413
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,593
oddly enough,
this guy has dogs that he uses to hunt 

414
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:56,130
coyotes width,
which is really crazy to kill.

415
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:01,250
Hunt to kill.
And he found coyote puppies in a den and

416
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:02,604
so they found these coyote puppies in 
the den and he felt bad that these 

417
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,263
little coyote puppies,
like I don't know what happened to the 

418
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:12,360
mother.
So they raised one,

419
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,920
so he took a coyote puppy in and now it 
lives with them.

420
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,933
Wow.
Yeah.

421
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,430
And it gets a lot like the only problem 
is when they feed it.

422
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,743
Is that him?

423
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,500
Yeah.
So he's a German shepherd.

424
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,393
Yeah.
I mean,

425
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,340
but he's had it since it was a baby.
The dog,

426
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,440
I think that is that.
I don't know if that's him,

427
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,640
but this guy has all this video of it on
his site of him with this coyote puppy,

428
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:42,270
with his other dogs.
They're all barking together and shit.

429
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:43,104
And he said the only,
the only problem they get along great 

430
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:45,924
until it's time to eat.
And when Simon to eat the coyote is 

431
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,440
like,
fuck off.

432
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,240
Fuck.
All right.

433
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,290
This is like full feral as soon as it's 
time to eat.

434
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,124
But he's had the thing since,
I think he said it was like a couple 

435
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,140
months old when he got it.
But just freshly weaned.

436
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,520
That's amazing.
Yeah,

437
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:04,080
you can.
You can raise them.

438
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,860
But they're wolves.
Wolves.

439
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,170
My friends have a Dingo.
What did it eat?

440
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,004
The baby

441
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,710
dangling.
A dingo ate my baby.

442
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,003
And this thing is the same way.
If you get some food on the counter and 

443
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:21,220
it's four feet off the ground,
that fucking thing.

444
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,990
You leave the room for one second.
That food is gone.

445
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,320
Yeah,

446
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,730
they're just feral.
Yeah.

447
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,743
It's funny,
like my puppy was like that when he was 

448
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,580
little.
It's like I was.

449
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,453
I mean that's how puppies are,
but I forgot because I haven't had a 

450
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:37,261
puppy in a while and I was eating and I 
put some food on his plate and he saw it

451
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:39,100
as like,
oh,

452
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:41,110
I want some of that.
They jumped up,

453
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:41,944
put his feet on the table,
leaned in and tried to try to bite it 

454
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:46,480
and got a piece of meat in his mouth and
I was like,

455
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,070
hey fucker.
I

456
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,770
got to teach them this.
They don't know.

457
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
They feel like,
well the food's right.

458
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:53,950
They're trying to get the food.
There's the food.

459
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,630
Here it is,
it's right there.

460
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,471
He,
our neighbors,

461
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:58,090
we're having people over there.
We're having a party.

462
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:03,040
And I was over there and they had a 
husky fucking bad ass Alaskan Husky.

463
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,780
And this thing was,
you know,

464
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,150
beyond puppy was big and they had 
meatballs.

465
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,200
Swedish meatballs,
like for platters of them were right out

466
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:13,990
of the oven,
still fucking hot and they left the room

467
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:16,840
and they came back and they were gone.
He had all of them,

468
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:19,360
all the Swedish meatballs.
Hot.

469
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,850
He didn't give a fuck.
He's like,

470
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:24,130
here's my chance.
You have a full belly or have a,

471
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,240
you know,
or burn,

472
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,130
burn your tongue and have a full bay or 
not.

473
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,200
No food and this is an Irish party.

474
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,850
This wasn't like there's Swedish 
meatballs and there is a sausage.

475
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,743
No Irish.
This one fucking thing and now it's 

476
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:37,624
gone.
The Swedish speak was dog eat all the 

477
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:40,440
food.
Yeah.

478
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,260
Yeah.
Dot.

479
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,560
It's a weird relationship that humans 
have with dogs because you know a lot of

480
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:45,394
people have dogs to sleep in their beds 
that come with you places they hop in 

481
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:49,234
the car and then then there's the 
assholes that have those emotional 

482
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:55,270
support dogs.
Yeah.

483
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:57,640
What is,
what is the jury out on that still?

484
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,660
It's fucking ridiculous.
Part of modern 21st century life that we

485
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:07,090
allow that stupid shit.
I was in a fucking restaurant,

486
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,313
like a really nice restaurant.
This lady came in and she's a lady from 

487
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,060
real housewives.
She was one of those.

488
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,620
Uh,
no,

489
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,360
not the show.
Desperate housewives.

490
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:18,490
She's a famous actress.
I want to say her name.

491
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:19,923
Very pretty lady.

492
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,580
She hit the skids though.
Um,

493
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,730
but anyway,
she's bringing,

494
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,970
brings in this fucking dog and,
and people are looking at her like what?

495
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,660
It's a dog,
like a golden lab and a big dog.

496
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,543
Yeah.
And she brings his dog and then just 

497
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:36,760
sitting there eating.
And there's dogs on the floor where like

498
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:40,520
you might drop a fry or your four can 
pick it up and wipe it off.

499
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:43,540
And this dog's assholes just rubbing on 
the ground right there.

500
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,733
I mean basically you have this,
this animal's Dick is like rubbing on 

501
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:51,790
the ground and rubbing on things and 
dirt on its feet.

502
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:52,624
It's probably stepping in shit.
And had people have allergies to dogs 

503
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,180
for sucked up there night.
One hundred percent.

504
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,720
Yeah.
And it's somehow or another they can get

505
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:02,554
a note from their doctor that says 
they're too fucking week to exist 

506
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:08,140
without this dog with them 24 hours a 
day.

507
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,320
It's an emotional support dog.
Does a lot of comics that have them.

508
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,620
Yeah,
but it's a like a loophole.

509
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:15,850
Look,
Natasha has one,

510
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:18,130
but she like openly admits it's a 
loophole.

511
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,960
I should take.
Bring the dog everywhere.

512
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:21,670
She's got a doctor's note.
Yeah.

513
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,540
So she's soft.
He.

514
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,860
Yeah.
I think is.

515
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,260
What's your name has to be allies.
Allies is.

516
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,183
Does she have it set up?
I sure that thing doesn't leave her 

517
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:34,210
side.
Yeah.

518
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,400
She'll make you watch it though when she
goes on stage here.

519
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:37,171
Hold this.
Yeah.

520
00:23:37,171 --> 00:23:38,004
Right,
right.

521
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,490
Yeah.
I know the people finger it.

522
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,750
I love.
I don't know.

523
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,030
A lot of people do and I just

524
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,873
want to hear her.
The dog waits for her to go out and it 

525
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,610
just takes the task.
The air and starts running.

526
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,810
He had presents.
Just literally runs backwards.

527
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,950
She's going to hear this speech so bad.
We're kidding.

528
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,290
Eliza.
We're kidding.

529
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,530
Don't call her.
Eli's either.

530
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,320
Get Mad at that too.
Eliza.

531
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,303
Eliza.
You know she doesn't use the last name 

532
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:06,200
anymore.
Well,

533
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:07,850
neither does I.
Will Christina?

534
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:09,830
Is Christina pain now?
Really?

535
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,723
Sebastian Maniscalco was just Sebastian.
Now are white people getting crazy 

536
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:15,830
lately.
Chicken is just tig.

537
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,820
Is that cultural appropriation two's a 
white person to use only one name.

538
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,900
I always forget what's cultural 
appropriation.

539
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,510
We need to constantly be reminded.
I tweeted something today.

540
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,300
I was reading a fucking article and I 
almost punched my screen.

541
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,050
They're saying that hoop earrings are 
cultural appropriation.

542
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:33,884
Now.
Girls aren't allowed to wear hoop 

543
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,830
earrings.
Really?

544
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,040
Cultural appropriation.
Damn.

545
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,143
Cue How fucking privileged you have to 
be like how sought legal hoop earrings 

546
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:47,090
criticize as cultural appropriation.

547
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,170
Do you know how soft you have to be to 
give into that,

548
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,783
to give you that and how?
How fucking dumb you have to be to say 

549
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:56,954
that.
Yeah.

550
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,810
You have to be so dumb and racist.
I think it's the.

551
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,550
It's the cit is racist against white 
people is racist against black,

552
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:05,384
but what their jungle jungle people that
only were giant fucking hoops in their 

553
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:12,050
ears.
What I read was Latinas.

554
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,840
Latinas are criticizing it and saying 
it's a part of their culture.

555
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,610
Their culture.
Yeah.

556
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,473
It's like people just pick them black.
That black people don't want girls to 

557
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:22,380
wear braids.
Oh,

558
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,040
cornrows.
Cornrows.

559
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,540
Yeah.
You could wear like regular white people

560
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,580
braids,
but a little skinny brains.

561
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,100
That's cultural appropriation.
What about Goldie locks?

562
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:32,810
She was white.
What about golf shirts?

563
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,710
Are they allowed to work off?
Right?

564
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,100
They shouldn't be.
If we start crazy with these braids,

565
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,270
it's green pants.

566
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,490
Here's the problem with all this 
bullshit.

567
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,610
The entire country is a melting pot of 
cultural appropriation.

568
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,850
You dumb cunts.
Alright.

569
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,793
That is the whole idea of having a 
civilization as that you get to share 

570
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:58,070
each other's food,
share each other's recipes,

571
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,053
listened to each other's music,
listened to each other's jokes and 

572
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:04,820
stories.
Get by each of those clothes.

573
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:05,871
You know,
there was this,

574
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:06,704
um,
is journalist that went to Japan and 

575
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:11,630
they were talking about cultural 
appropriation,

576
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:12,464
whether or not they thought that like 
white girls like Katy Perry wearing the 

577
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:17,360
geisha outfit was cultural 
appropriation.

578
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,270
And they were like universally saying 
no,

579
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:24,170
we're happy that people love Japanese 
culture and that they do that.

580
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,670
They're happy.
Yeah.

581
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,493
But over here you get these fucking 
dummies that are just looking to 

582
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:32,324
complain and criticize and just call out
everything and everybody about 

583
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:37,280
everything.
Yeah,

584
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,170
it's a,
Oh my God,

585
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,520
I,
I see this.

586
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,413
What is this?
No,

587
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,320
Jeremy Lin,
uh,

588
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,070
came out

589
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,550
with a,
a in the preseason.

590
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,403
I think he had dreadlocks in his hair 
and a former NBA player called him out 

591
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:50,820
on it.
Kenyon Martin.

592
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,730
But Jeremy Linds response to it was 
actually really good.

593
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:55,440
If you want to check that out.
Hey Man.

594
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:56,790
It's all good.
You don't have to like my hair.

595
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,190
Definitely entitled to your opinion.
Actually,

596
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:02,040
I,
I legit grateful you Sharon.

597
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:04,530
It tbh to be honest,
at the end of the day,

598
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:09,531
I appreciate that I have dreads and you 
have Chinese because I think it's a sign

599
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:10,584
of respect and I think as minorities,
the more we appreciate each other's 

600
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,123
cultures,
the more we influence mainstream 

601
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:15,834
society.
Thanks for everything you did for the 

602
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:18,084
nets and hoops.
Had your poster up on my wall growing 

603
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:21,500
up.
Oh Shit.

604
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,153
That's really classy.
I'm somebody really needed to tell him 

605
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,120
like,
all right bro,

606
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:29,190
we get it.
You want to be black,

607
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,200
like we get it.
But the last name is Lynn.

608
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:33,034
All right,
well he's said that the other guy who 

609
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,990
was the other guy,
Kenyon Martin is.

610
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,550
There was a picture of his but it's been
removed.

611
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,543
Yeah,
well he's a dummy and that Jeremy Lin 

612
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:46,320
guys are very classic character for the 
way you answered it.

613
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,030
First of all,
dreads or not black.

614
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,660
They were a sign of people not washing 
their hair.

615
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,540
That dates back to the Greeks and the 
Romans.

616
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:58,140
There's ancient sculptures of Caucasian 
looking people with dreadlocks.

617
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,393
Dreadlocks were worn by the vikings is 
not a black thing because some black 

618
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:05,790
people wear them.
Does not mean it's the idea that this is

619
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:06,624
a real thing.
That's cultural appropriation that 

620
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:08,544
people go around pointing at people 
saying you can't wear your hair a 

621
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:13,284
certain way.
Like we're limiting hairstyles and it's 

622
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:19,470
just so many people are just looking 
forward to criticizing,

623
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:21,960
getting shitty with people over almost 
nothing.

624
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,040
Yeah.
It's just no.

625
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,913
The whole.
The whole energy of this country is 

626
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:30,340
supposed to be complete assimilation.
Like you said,

627
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,174
let's pick the best shit from each 
culture and may get just American 

628
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:38,290
hodgepodge and that's what it's about 
with gentrification.

629
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,153
You know,
you want people to not all live in one 

630
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:44,170
neighborhood and all dress exactly the 
same as each other.

631
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,140
You want there to be a merging of 
different looks,

632
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,150
different addresses.
Sure.

633
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,890
Working in different trades,
you know,

634
00:28:50,891 --> 00:28:53,050
they used to be.
If you were Irish,

635
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,940
you were a cop.
That's it.

636
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,010
That's what we fucking did.
You know,

637
00:28:57,011 --> 00:28:59,890
we were cops are,
we were soldiers when we first came over

638
00:28:59,891 --> 00:29:02,170
here and like the 18 sixties during the 
famine,

639
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,380
they just got off the boat hungry and 
they threw a fucking uniform,

640
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:10,060
honest and sent us into fight lines 
against the south or you were a cop

641
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,690
and then after that they got into the 
trades.

642
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,090
There's a lot of Irish people in unions.
Right?

643
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,580
And a lot of Irish in the Longshoreman's
union.

644
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:20,400
A lot of Irish in the carpenter's union.
Yeah.

645
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,730
But look,
fusion restaurants,

646
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,910
what's a fusion restaurant?
And take a couple of different cultures.

647
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,910
You combine their food and do some sort 
of a unique thing and it's.

648
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,850
It was a big thing for awhile.
People loved fusion.

649
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,743
Yeah.
They love that kind of food and now 

650
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,870
there's a ton of people complaining when
White People Cook Mexican food.

651
00:29:39,871 --> 00:29:41,800
Yeah.
Like there's this famous guy,

652
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,760
I forget his name can be that famous 
because he's not that famous.

653
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:46,594
I forget his name,
but he's a famous white guy who loves 

654
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,253
Mexican food and he opened up a Mexican 
restaurant and all these people got 

655
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:59,320
pissed that this guy is a cooking 
Mexican food,

656
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,740
but this guy has been writing books 
about Mexican cuisine.

657
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,573
He goes down to Mexico.
He learns how to Cook Authentic Mexican 

658
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:07,684
dishes from people that live in these 
villages and towns in Mexico and and 

659
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:16,090
like has a deep love and appreciation 
for the culture of Mexico.

660
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,520
Yeah.
I mean this guy is essentially a Mexican

661
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:23,110
cuisine scholar and all these people 
give is fucking poor guy.

662
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,700
That's his name.
What is his name?

663
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,320
Rick bayless and he's famous.
I mean I've,

664
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:30,154
I've read one of his books on Mexican 
food and I've seen articles written on 

665
00:30:34,691 --> 00:30:38,770
them and video interviews and stuff and 
this guy is getting in,

666
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,083
in trouble with other people.
When chefs become famous cooking other 

667
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:43,870
cultures,
food,

668
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,330
you don't own your culture,
you fucking idiot.

669
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,430
You know why?
Because you didn't create it.

670
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,400
You didn't invent pizza.
You didn't invent pasta,

671
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:55,870
you didn't invent Chinese food.
It's been around for hundreds of years.

672
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,170
You were just born,
you were born with a certain ethnicity.

673
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,003
You don't own that ethnicity.
The idea that you can keep other people 

674
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,400
from enjoying it and appreciate the 
history of other human beings is fucking

675
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:10,360
racist.
It is stupid.

676
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,640
This,
this thing that we're getting into.

677
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,310
We were criticizing people,
you know,

678
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:20,370
based on various aspects of culture that
they enjoy.

679
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,800
It's insanity.
It's insanity.

680
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,753
I know.
Think about how Italians have affected 

681
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,563
the like fashion in this country.
I mean from high fashion all the way 

682
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:37,381
down to like the disco era when all of a
sudden music were all calling themselves

683
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:40,300
Gadi and they were all calling the Al 
Capone.

684
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,650
I mean,
come on man.

685
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:42,484
I mean,
how many fucking rap songs like have 

686
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:48,700
godfather lyrics in and just cut the 
shit.

687
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:52,420
It's so stupid.
It's so stupid and that's my culture.

688
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:53,380
I'll tell you,
you can have it.

689
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,573
That's why I love one of the seminal 
moments in American culture was 

690
00:31:56,921 --> 00:31:59,950
aerosmith,
getting together with DMC and doing walk

691
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:00,400
this way.

692
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,770
That was,
that's what America's bus today.

693
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,993
Yeah.
It's just,

694
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,200
it's kids today looking to point the 
finger,

695
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,383
uh,
the world they see and looking to find 

696
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:14,890
fault in it and find fault in each 
other.

697
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,380
And it's this call out culture that we 
see.

698
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,160
There's plenty of Shit is wrong in the 
world.

699
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,023
There's plenty of shit.
And I guess this is just a byproduct of 

700
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:26,860
people having the freedom to 
communicate.

701
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,210
I mean,
I guess that's what we're seeing,

702
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,403
but there's,
there's plenty of shit to really pay 

703
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:32,284
attention to.
Jeremy Lin wearing dreadlocks isn't on 

704
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:35,890
that list.
You know,

705
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,100
girls that wear hoop earrings.
Then on that list,

706
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,100
it's just

707
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,320
fucking white kids that wear baggy 
pants.

708
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,760
So what,
so what,

709
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:44,720
who gives a shit?
Yeah.

710
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:48,350
To me that's a sign that they're like 
accepting black culture.

711
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,940
They want to enter intermix.
They want to hang out together and share

712
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:56,540
each other's fashions and ideas and 
drugs and women.

713
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,220
Well,
the white people,

714
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,293
especially like from the suburbs,
have always looked towards black people 

715
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,033
that grew up in difficult circumstances 
and admired something about how tough 

716
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:12,960
they were or how,
how,

717
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:14,070
uh,
you know,

718
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,670
street smart or how cool,
cool they were.

719
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,410
They were a people that,
look,

720
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,343
it takes pressure to make a diamond.
You don't make a diamond in Sherman 

721
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,050
Oaks,
you know?

722
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,103
Yeah.
Whew.

723
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,830
We went to the gallery.
It was crazy.

724
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,510
Went to the food court,
were radical,

725
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,710
you know,
that's not,

726
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,671
you know,
those,

727
00:33:32,671 --> 00:33:36,870
those people that live in these safe 
suburban neighborhoods.

728
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,530
The one thing that the troubled kids 
coming up want to be.

729
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,550
They want to be associated in some way 
with something tougher,

730
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,050
something harder.
Something where,

731
00:33:47,051 --> 00:33:49,620
you know,
people had to earn their stripes.

732
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,710
That's why they have this love of rap 
music.

733
00:33:52,711 --> 00:33:54,960
Especially Gangsta rap.
You mean?

734
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:55,794
That has always been.
That's always been an issue with young 

735
00:33:58,771 --> 00:33:59,604
white kids.
Like since since Gangsta rap was 

736
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:02,544
invented,
there's always been like young white 

737
00:34:04,591 --> 00:34:07,050
kids who live in the suburbs.
Who Will it?

738
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,003
I mean,
it's always comical watching them sing 

739
00:34:09,601 --> 00:34:10,434
the lyrics,
talking about robbing people and 

740
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:12,654
shooting people and dealing drugs and 
meanwhile they're living in thousand 

741
00:34:15,691 --> 00:34:16,420
oaks or something.

742
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,253
Yeah.
Whose son was it was at like Tom Hanks 

743
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:20,414
says yes.
The big rapper Tom Hanks' son as a 

744
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:25,830
rapper and get so much shit.
Yeah.

745
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,700
I don't know if Tom Hanks has commented 
on it,

746
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,940
but it's Kinda suck yet because he's got
to support him.

747
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,580
It's his son,
but the kid is like,

748
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,630
that's it.
Oh my God.

749
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,770
Is this a limo life?
Live a life.

750
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,810
It says that on his knuckles.
Oh,

751
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,110
good Lord.
Oh boy.

752
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,910
For eggs.
He did it.

753
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:48,890
He did everything right.
What did he do wrong?

754
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,450
Yeah,
but he didn't do everything right.

755
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,730
See,
because he's working all the time.

756
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,780
Yeah,
he worked too much.

757
00:34:53,781 --> 00:34:55,190
Yeah.
If you're working all the time,

758
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,053
is that his son with the green hair and 
the neck tattoos and the lower right 

759
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:00,500
hand corner.
Let's say green day guys.

760
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,670
Is it?
I don't know.

761
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:06,790
Is it Tommy Hilfiger?
Son taught you son of a bitch.

762
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,570
Tommy Hilfiger son has limo life.
He's a rapper as well.

763
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:12,770
Oh,
terrific.

764
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,370
All you need is a neck tattoo here.
Let.

765
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,210
He's smoking cigarettes.
Yeah.

766
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,201
No,
it's true.

767
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:20,450
That kind of working too much.
Jane was racist.

768
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,310
All white people at the same time.
Yeah.

769
00:35:22,311 --> 00:35:23,144
What's up man?

770
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,300
Can we do me and Tom Hanks thing,
right?

771
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:33,980
Same thing there.
Jamie thought that it would think.

772
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,203
Think what?
Oh,

773
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,500
he's jacked.
Damn.

774
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,540
He's good luck.
Yeah.

775
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,463
That's awesome.

776
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,600
It's probably getting all the pussy.

777
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,671
Oh,
Howard Stern.

778
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:41,504
Adam?
Yes.

779
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,710
No,
he fused with Howard Stern.

780
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,600
Why he threatens them.
Hold on.

781
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,570
Go to that site visit please.
What is that about?

782
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,890
What is this top me?
Scroll down.

783
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,400
We could read that.
Tom,

784
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,030
Tom Hanks,
rapper son,

785
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,690
feuds with Howard Stern.
Threatens violence.

786
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,770
Make that large place.
Tom Hanks.

787
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:07,850
Rapper Son Chester,
Aka Chet Hayes.

788
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,150
Oh,
his name is chet hates.

789
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,373
Took to twitter to threaten radio shock 
jock Howard stern this week after 

790
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:18,801
stirring question.
Hague's Hayes Gangsta credentials as the

791
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,230
son of a famous Hollywood celebrity.
Oh my God.

792
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:23,064
He joked at Tom Hanks.
Must be annoyed that it's someone 

793
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:28,320
pretends to be a hardened rapper while 
he grew up in a Tony,

794
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:29,154
California.
Sabra.

795
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,860
I always loved that word,
Tony,

796
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,870
and let people use it for posh.
Where'd he grow up?

797
00:36:33,871 --> 00:36:36,840
Beverly Hills Stern joked.
That's what a fucking Douche.

798
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,390
Ah,

799
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,620
so what did he say?
What'd he say?

800
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,950
He's unleashed a torrent of tweets.
Threatening violence.

801
00:36:44,951 --> 00:36:48,880
Calling him a fucking Jheri curl con.
What is he saying?

802
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,340
Oh,
you said Howard Stern.

803
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,410
Give your sorry ass.
White Yuppie.

804
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,910
Fencing entertainment.
Oh,

805
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:55,803
you can't say white Yuppie fans when 
you're a white Yuppie and invite me up 

806
00:36:59,231 --> 00:37:00,064
there.
I promise I won't physically whoop your 

807
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:02,434
ass.
After stern apparently stopped 

808
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:06,460
responding to Hayes.
He took the threats up a notch.

809
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:11,670
How we do you have any idea how badly I 
am going to assault you when I see you?

810
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,180
You can't run from me for forever and 
knocked knees.

811
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,823
Haze.
Then knock stern for not having much 

812
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:23,290
bread as my spread as much bread.
Oh,

813
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,124
it's his family.
Despite despite the fact that according 

814
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:28,890
to Forbes Stern is worth an estimated 
95,000,005,

815
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:33,010
he gets $500 million every two years.
It's something crazy like that,

816
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:33,580
right?
Yeah.

817
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,630
Howard Stern,
it's a shame.

818
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:36,640
You don't hang the same circles as my 
family.

819
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:39,180
Not Enough bread for that because you 
see,

820
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,540
if you did,
I would have already seen you tomorrow.

821
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:44,374
TMZ or Gawker will write an article 
about a b o I t this rent and all I 

822
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:52,930
gotta say is,
keep riding my Dick bitches.

823
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,540
Ah Ha.
Wow.

824
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,340
Magic as your kid.
Imagine if that was your kid,

825
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,780
I would choke conscious.
Fuck it.

826
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,683
Take him down.
I would take us back and I would put 

827
00:38:04,431 --> 00:38:06,920
them to sleep and then I'd take pictures
of my dick on his forehead.

828
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:07,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

829
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,590
An outline it.
That's enough.

830
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,480
That's intervention time.
Son of a bitch.

831
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,623
You're threatening the greatest radio 
personality in the history of the known 

832
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:21,050
universe because he said you.
You're a fucking goof.

833
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,610
Yeah.
And what do you do?

834
00:38:22,611 --> 00:38:25,360
You act like a fucking goof.
Goddammit.

835
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,630
Assault you so hard.
But think about it.

836
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:34,350
Why can't a rich guy be a bad ass?
He maybe he is violent.

837
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:35,950
Maybe he's a little nuts.

838
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,300
He likes guns.
I,

839
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,230
I've never heard his rap.
Do we have even wrapped available?

840
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,860
There are.
I'm sure rich guys who grow up rich,

841
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,723
who severely overcompensate because they
feel like they live in this soft 

842
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:53,960
environment,
so they fucking go to crossfit every day

843
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:56,680
and Tattoo Jitsu and become a hard ass.
Yeah.

844
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,663
I don't think he's on that list now.
I don't think Tom Hanks was beating his 

845
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:01,150
ass at night.
I just don't.

846
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,253
I just think what he's doing is just 
trying to be hard and trying to respond 

847
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:09,160
to Howard Stern,
calling them out about that.

848
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,720
It's just like,
come on kid.

849
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,230
Like,
did you,

850
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:16,360
was your dad not around like and you 
call him and talk to him about it.

851
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,560
He would say.
He would say,

852
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:19,930
what the fuck are you going to say?
Don't say that.

853
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,930
And how old is he?
If he's under 23,

854
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:25,430
I'll give them a pass.
It's almost like God son,

855
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,283
remember God is God.
His son was always trying to be a bad 

856
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:31,600
ass son was a criminal.
Yeah.

857
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,840
I mean he was in the families in the 
family business.

858
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,150
I guess it's different with the,
with the mafia,

859
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,960
but he's not like Dr Dre is kid.
Yeah.

860
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,450
You know what I'm saying?
He's fucking forrest gumps kid.

861
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,500
No disrespect.
Tom Hanks.

862
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:49,270
I'm a big fan.
I love Janet Green Mile.

863
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,000
He's a great actor.
He's the best dad.

864
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,810
He's a great actor and by all accounts,
a lovely person.

865
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:58,480
Yes.
I don't know if he did his job or not.

866
00:39:58,481 --> 00:39:59,314
I mean,
I'm just talking shit about him not 

867
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:00,574
being around,
but I just got to assume that if you're 

868
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:03,250
doing that many movies,
you're not around.

869
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,860
It's producing to be.
Didn't he?

870
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,750
Didn't you have a studio also?
I don't know.

871
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,090
I think he's got his hand in a studio as
well.

872
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,660
That's always amazing to me.
It's like you're being handed literally.

873
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,494
If you're Tom Hanks,
you're the first guy that gets offered 

874
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,180
every script.
It's in your age range that comes along.

875
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,520
What are you gonna you gonna fucking 
produce.

876
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:24,220
Also what it would take on the headache 
of producing movies.

877
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,083
Maybe enjoys it,
but what have been enjoying hanging out 

878
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:27,730
with your family a little bit.

879
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,713
I got weirded out with him when he 
started doing those movies about like 

880
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,550
the fucking secret biblical fucking 
Divinci Code.

881
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:37,384
Yeah.
I was like,

882
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,310
did you read these scripts?
Yeah,

883
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,530
that was bad.
These are terrible movies you got.

884
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:43,450
Damn.
Tom Hanks was a bad book.

885
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,763
Has It?
Has a bad book and it become a good 

886
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:47,620
movie.
There were so clunky.

887
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,543
Yeah.
I was like,

888
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,403
this just seems to me like something 
someone does when they don't have 

889
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:54,730
anything else to do.
And the guy who wrote the book,

890
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,130
Dan,
something around Dan Brown,

891
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,053
he I think had a hand in the movie so he
would ever chance it had of upgrading 

892
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,020
was destroyed.
Well,

893
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,240
I don't think they wanted to upgrade.
I think it's like.

894
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,820
I mean,
did they want to upgrade the fucking.

895
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,683
What is the vampire movie that the girls
like with the vampire is a lot of live 

896
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,313
in the day.
Twilight.

897
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,510
They're not trying to upgrade twilight.
Right.

898
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,760
They wanted to give them,
kind of made it popular,

899
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,130
but I think they kind of did.
Are you a secret trial?

900
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,920
I got a daughter.
I've seen it,

901
00:41:22,921 --> 00:41:23,754
yeah.
I've seen them and they're fucking 

902
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:26,140
great.
We're just really well done.

903
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,590
Really well done.
You're getting emotional.

904
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,420
I could see the milk coming out of your 
nipples while you're saying.

905
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:33,860
Yes.
Ridiculous.

906
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:34,100
Dude,

907
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,140
I just took her to see,
uh,

908
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,660
the beach boys last weekend.
Oh my God was real beach boys,

909
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:42,440
Brian Wilson and it was a,
didn't one of them die recently.

910
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,890
Um,
I think one of the brothers May die,

911
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:46,724
but it was a al Jardeen who founded the 
beach boys with Brian Wilson and then 

912
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:55,574
they had a couple other than they had al
Jardeen son who can hit the fucking 

913
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:00,860
notes now.
His son is a bad ass singer,

914
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,203
but it was just fucking crate.
They play the entire pet sounds album 

915
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:05,923
song by song and then they played all 
the hits and it was just me and my 

916
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:11,900
daughter just had such a blast because 
she has,

917
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,973
she's 14 and she loves fucking like the 
Mamas and the Papas and the allman 

918
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:24,740
brothers and Cheryl Jam and she's got 
amazing taste and she,

919
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,200
and she's a surfer.
She's been surfing for five years,

920
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:28,130
like three days a week.

921
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,830
The beach boys are her favorite,
sad pet sounds is their favorite album.

922
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,664
So that was my birthday present was two 
tickets and I brought her and she was 

923
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:40,160
singing to every fucking word and we 
were laughing.

924
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:43,070
We had a contest about every time you 
see a Hawaiian shirt,

925
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,810
you get to punch the other person in the
arm.

926
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,200
If you see a bald guy with a ponytail 
that's two punches,

927
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,210
open toed sandals with a Hawaiian shirt.
And the ponytail was three punches.

928
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:54,044
So shoe must have beat the fuck out.
She fucking nailed me because I got bad 

929
00:42:57,261 --> 00:42:58,094
eyes.
She was spotted these guys from a 

930
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,010
hundred yards away.
Well and um,

931
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,950
and a psychotic game.
Yeah.

932
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,620
Fucking beach boys concert.
You get beaten to death,

933
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:07,853
right?
Kennison had a bit about the beach boys 

934
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:11,414
in the fucking eighties.
He had to beat a bit about the beach 

935
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:15,650
boys phoning it in,
in the eighties,

936
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,430
I think it was.

937
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,480
You can tell they're just looking at 
their watch away.

938
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
Big California Yoga.
Right,

939
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,870
right.
I'll tell you what though,

940
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,840
fucking gives you goosebumps when you 
hear it.

941
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,310
Really,
it really because you will,

942
00:43:28,311 --> 00:43:30,500
you realize he's not going to be doing 
this much longer.

943
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:31,880
Right.
And uh,

944
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:33,980
you know,
I feel that way when I see the stones.

945
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,140
I want to see the stock and show.
What'd you see?

946
00:43:36,141 --> 00:43:36,974
The stones?
I saw them in giant stadium and then I 

947
00:43:39,531 --> 00:43:44,531
saw them at the staples center.
I heard Mick Jagger is a very frugal.

948
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,130
That's a nice one.
I heard of you.

949
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,210
That's what I heard.
Yeah.

950
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,880
Like how could you be?
Yeah.

951
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,540
He's got to be worth hundreds of 
millions of dollars.

952
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:52,374
Yeah.
He's still performing all over the 

953
00:43:53,481 --> 00:43:54,320
world.
All right.

954
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,260
Just saving that cash.
That's right.

955
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,720
Putting it away for a rainy day.
But he's got a lot.

956
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,340
A lot of kids.
A lot of wives.

957
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:03,060
That's right.
He's got a bunch of baby mamas,

958
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,500
but still the money.
Crazy money.

959
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,660
He's got a recent one.
Does he?

960
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:09,494
Yeah,
he knocked a checkup a couple of years 

961
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,390
ago.
Mc.

962
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,793
She's hot too.
I think she's Brazilian and I think 

963
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:17,960
she's like 28 or something like that.
And how old is he?

964
00:44:17,961 --> 00:44:19,580
Seventy five.
Ballerina.

965
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,550
Feel like she's a ballerina.
So if he's 75,

966
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,863
you're guaranteeing that this child will
experience his father's death in the 

967
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:28,100
first 20 years.
Of his life,

968
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,190
you don't want something really crazy 
happens like technologically,

969
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:37,320
like medical technology gets to some 
point where they can reverse aging,

970
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,083
which is apparently when you talk to 
people who are like legitimate 

971
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:45,560
scientists about this,
they're like,

972
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:46,403
this is not outside the realm of 
possibility by any stretch of the 

973
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:51,270
imagination,
like within our lifetime.

974
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,133
It is entirely possible that they 
figured out a way to stop the aging 

975
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:56,960
process dead in its tracks.
Yeah.

976
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:00,090
Well Silicon Valley believes it.
All those dudes,

977
00:45:00,091 --> 00:45:00,924
if got think tanks gallon for a 
cryogenically saving well cryogenics I 

978
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:07,470
would imagine if you do it regularly,
I bet that difference.

979
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,733
You're talking about cryotherapy.
Cryogenics is actually freezing the 

980
00:45:11,761 --> 00:45:12,590
body.
Right?

981
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:13,120
Right,
right.

982
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,620
Yeah.
Therapy I would think would add some,

983
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,620
some time with,
as a company in northern California,

984
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:24,570
the takes the blood of young people,
injects it into the bodies of old people

985
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:25,703
and there's anecdotal research and 
research with mice that points to the 

986
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:35,730
fact that it's opposed to radically 
improve behavior and energy and mice.

987
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,073
And conversely,
when they take the older mice is blood 

988
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,630
and they put it in a younger mouse and 
younger males like,

989
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,513
what the fuck?
Y'All just starts acting like an old 

990
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:47,820
mouse shit.
Yeah.

991
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:48,654
And so we had um,
Eric Weinstein on the other day who 

992
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:53,154
works for Peter Teal and Peter Teal is 
that billionaire guy in Silicon Valley 

993
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:57,563
who,
uh,

994
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:01,380
he was the guy that funded that Hulk 
Hogan lawsuit against Gawker.

995
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,790
That crushed Gawker.
Yeah.

996
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,140
Yeah,
because they outed him.

997
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:07,470
Apparently they outed him as being gay 
and he was really pissed at them.

998
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:10,170
They wrote some really shitty articles 
about him and he was like,

999
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:11,040
all right,
fuck you.

1000
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,660
How about I just use my money and crush 
you?

1001
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,420
So he went after that.
Oh Shit.

1002
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:16,254
Yeah.
Apparently he's offering the women who 

1003
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:20,430
have accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual 
assault.

1004
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,300
He's offering each one of them $100,000
to go after him.

1005
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,710
Wow.
Yeah.

1006
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,150
This guy,
he's,

1007
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,090
he's like,
he's an interesting,

1008
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,730
very interesting character,
but super rich,

1009
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,250
super smart.
It doesn't give a fuck.

1010
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:38,010
And so the rumor was that he was doing 
this therapy,

1011
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:39,683
but since I've been,
I've heard that does not confirmed was 

1012
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:47,420
that Jamie Teal is not harvesting the 
blood of the county.

1013
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,970
That's a good picture of Elon musk 
though,

1014
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:54,720
trying to work on some kind of life 
longevity thing.

1015
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,460
Really.
He's probably working on everything.

1016
00:46:56,461 --> 00:46:58,740
That fucker.
He makes me feel really stupid.

1017
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,413
He was at a comedy show once that I did 
with that chick that he just dumped 

1018
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:07,950
Johnny Depp's old girlfriend and uh,
I got legitimately nervous did he was in

1019
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:12,951
the audience and the audience.
I have a bit about inventors.

1020
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:19,110
Yeah.
I mean a guy like I as a comedian,

1021
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,003
and I hope this doesn't come out the 
wrong way in order for me to be able to 

1022
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:26,070
get on stage in front of hundreds of 
people and take the reins and go,

1023
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,133
alright,
you hundreds of people are going to all 

1024
00:47:28,771 --> 00:47:29,770
shut the fuck up.

1025
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,390
I'm the funniest one of them.
I merit you all being quiet for an hour.

1026
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:37,210
You have to do mind games with yourself 
sometimes,

1027
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:38,890
like,
especially when you're starting out.

1028
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,053
And so you have to some.
Sometimes if it's a Gig I'm intimidated 

1029
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:44,440
by,
I'll think to myself,

1030
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,450
I'm smarter than everybody in this room

1031
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:49,643
and I know I'm not,
but I have to tell myself that that's a 

1032
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:55,620
ridiculous.
And then it's so hard when you get up.

1033
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:56,813
And um,
I remember I did a Gig at this very 

1034
00:47:59,521 --> 00:48:03,150
hipster place in New York and Johnny 
Depp was in the audience and he was with

1035
00:48:03,151 --> 00:48:03,984
some fucking model who looked like she 
was literally starving to death and 

1036
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:11,400
everybody in the crowd was just in black
and they were all here.

1037
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,160
And I really felt like.
And I said it on stage,

1038
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:14,994
I go,
usually I just tell myself I'm better 

1039
00:48:16,651 --> 00:48:19,620
looking and I'm richer than everybody in
the audience.

1040
00:48:19,621 --> 00:48:23,040
And tonight I realized I'm the poorest,
ugliest person here

1041
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:32,230
trying to convince yourself I'm the best
looking down a of ladies and gentlemen,

1042
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:35,460
please welcome Greg Fitzsimmons Ball.

1043
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,620
Rankled short

1044
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,450
shimming onstage.

1045
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,690
But that's the mind game.
That's the trick.

1046
00:48:45,691 --> 00:48:47,550
It's like visualization.
Why?

1047
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,610
Why that trick you're supposed to.
Because I get scared.

1048
00:48:50,611 --> 00:48:52,500
I get intimidated.
Not Anymore.

1049
00:48:52,501 --> 00:48:54,480
But when I was starting out I used to 
all the time.

1050
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,573
Well,
when I come back and I look at like 

1051
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,350
starting out when you and I both started
out,

1052
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:03,950
we were both like 21.
What the fuck does a 21 year old have to

1053
00:49:03,951 --> 00:49:04,920
say about anything?
Yeah,

1054
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:06,890
we're so dumb.
I know.

1055
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:12,310
Like I imagined myself today going on 
stage at 21,

1056
00:49:12,651 --> 00:49:13,484
like being in the room,
watching myself going onstage at 21 and 

1057
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:17,840
just thinking what a fucking idiot.
Yeah.

1058
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,750
Like you don't know anything about life.
Yeah.

1059
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,310
You're basically fresh out of high 
school.

1060
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,280
Just paying your own bills for like a 
couple of years.

1061
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:26,163
Yeah.
And here you are talking into a 

1062
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:30,620
microphone.
We're grown adults.

1063
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:35,650
Like I went on stage exactly 16 days 
after it was legal for me to drink.

1064
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,793
Yeah.

1065
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,730
And you get middle aged people that have
real jobs,

1066
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,260
mortgages,
mortgages,

1067
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,410
back from the war.

1068
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:49,960
People with college degrees,
master's degrees.

1069
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,930
People have pulled people out of burning
buildings.

1070
00:49:53,931 --> 00:49:54,530
Yeah.
Okay.

1071
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:59,530
I've lost friends and gunfights guy,
widows 21 year old talking to a widow,

1072
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,550
trying to make them laugh.
Fucking idiot.

1073
00:50:01,551 --> 00:50:02,384
I was

1074
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:06,300
but this.

1075
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,553
But there's no other way to do it.
Like Dane Cook said this once and is a 

1076
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,330
very insightful thing.
He was like,

1077
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:18,750
if I had to do it again,
like I've had to start comedy again.

1078
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,580
I really don't think I could do it.
He's like,

1079
00:50:20,581 --> 00:50:22,140
it was just,
it's so overwhelming.

1080
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:24,780
The idea of starting again,
like 10 years in,

1081
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,310
you know?
Yeah.

1082
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:27,620
But that's kind what

1083
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,160
we've done with podcasting.
We start over again.

1084
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,500
I mean we had momentum because we had 
been in an entertainment,

1085
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:39,080
but I feel like it was the healthiest 
thing in the world,

1086
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:44,081
the podcast for me because you know,
would have been all these years would do

1087
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:48,500
and stand up and you get to a certain 
point where I always think of it as like

1088
00:50:48,501 --> 00:50:51,830
your bottom and your top rise over the 
years.

1089
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:52,664
They should,
they should get to like the worst bomb 

1090
00:50:54,381 --> 00:50:55,214
you're going to have now is so much 
higher than the worst bomb you would 

1091
00:50:58,211 --> 00:51:00,050
have had five years ago,
10 years ago,

1092
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:03,550
20 years ago.
And so you do need to challenge yourself

1093
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,384
and like with the podcast,
it's a whole different rhythm and if 

1094
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,533
you're not,
you're not getting immediate feedback 

1095
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:10,190
and,
and plus it's a business.

1096
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:12,250
You've got to build it,
you've got to get your equipment and you

1097
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:13,084
got to,
you know,

1098
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,660
sell ads and all that shit.

1099
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,493
And it was like,
for me it was really good at woke me up 

1100
00:51:17,331 --> 00:51:17,781
again.
Like,

1101
00:51:17,781 --> 00:51:18,620
oh yeah,
I got.

1102
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,870
It gave me confidence that I could do 
something new.

1103
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,300
That's interesting because you already 
doing the radio show,

1104
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,650
right?
Well,

1105
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,620
I did the podcast about a year after I 
started the radio show.

1106
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,840
How long have you been doing the 
apologize?

1107
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,730
Like eight or nine years?
Yeah,

1108
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:35,570
I didn't think of it at all that way.
I thought of the podcast is just fun.

1109
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,633
Yeah,
it was something to do for a goof and I 

1110
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:42,941
did it for years,
like irregularly before I ever wanted up

1111
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:43,993
committing to it,
but like every few weeks and then 

1112
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:46,583
finally in a room,
the green room we would do in the 

1113
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,850
greenroom.
Joey Diaz would always get mad.

1114
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,043
Shut that fucking thing off.
You guys were always fucking online to 

1115
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:56,180
fuck around online.
Shut it off.

1116
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:58,070
Joe Rogan.
He'll would get mad.

1117
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:59,420
I'd be like,
people like it.

1118
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,340
You waste your fucking time on the 
Internet.

1119
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,130
Yeah,
I was relentless.

1120
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,360
That's like the biggest part of his 
life.

1121
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,580
Now.
His podcast is gigantic for him.

1122
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,433
Yeah.
Yeah,

1123
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:14,740
just did it the other night.
He was so high he fucking gave me the.

1124
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,950
He,
I've forgot where his studio was,

1125
00:52:17,951 --> 00:52:19,470
so I said,
send me the address again.

1126
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:22,600
So He sends me address if I fucking pull
up on this dark road.

1127
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:23,860
And I go to,
I go,

1128
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:24,941
oh,
he wants to suck,

1129
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:27,430
fucking switch the studio or something 
because this isn't the old one.

1130
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,780
So I got her.
What the fuck?

1131
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:30,820
It's a house I guess he's doing in the 
back of his house.

1132
00:52:30,821 --> 00:52:33,220
I fucking ring the doorbell.
It's his house.

1133
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:35,590
It was so high.
He gave me his fucking home address.

1134
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,800
I'm texting him,
I'm out front.

1135
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,230
I'm looking.
The fuck has street something.

1136
00:52:44,231 --> 00:52:47,710
Greg Fitzsimmons and I walk in and he's 
chewing down those.

1137
00:52:47,711 --> 00:52:49,590
What are they?
Black start something.

1138
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:53,050
He's got a bond going.
He's had mushrooms.

1139
00:52:53,051 --> 00:52:56,710
Least Siad is sitting there.
His eyes are shut.

1140
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:00,760
His eyes are shut.
I don't know how he does it.

1141
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,000
Leaks.
We can't handle it

1142
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:03,710
in his eyes sometimes.
Look,

1143
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:07,610
I've been on the show before and when 
someone says something,

1144
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:08,623
I always feel like we're having a 
conversation and someone says something 

1145
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:10,850
like,
well what do you mean by that?

1146
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,170
Yeah.
And then we'll have a talk.

1147
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,240
But if you say like Lee said something,
I go,

1148
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:15,870
what does that mean?
And he was like,

1149
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:21,560
lock up.
Like it's just way too high to have this

1150
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:26,030
guy.
He was talking about how he

1151
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,873
was like,
it seems like audio is the thing of the 

1152
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:30,090
future.
I go,

1153
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:31,050
what?
What do you mean?

1154
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:31,800
He goes,
well,

1155
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,633
just seems like people like they always 
on their phones while they're on tv or 

1156
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:37,014
the watched the movie.
They're talking on their phone or 

1157
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:40,163
they're looking through their phone and 
they're listening to things while 

1158
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:42,534
they're doing other things are at what 
I'll get you when you're listening to 

1159
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:50,340
things while you're watching TV,
you're watching who the fuck was playing

1160
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:52,290
with their phone while they're watching 
TV and he's like,

1161
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:57,050
fuck it.
Paranoia.

1162
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:57,903
Wash over him.
Like a tidal wave of my area that we 

1163
00:53:59,351 --> 00:54:03,870
have this poor guy to hi.
Joey makes him do everything he does.

1164
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:07,800
Not Always Joey do that.
Joey swaps edibles on him like,

1165
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,880
please try this.
It's only 50 milligrams and it will take

1166
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:12,714
a 500 milligram pot and they'll put it 
in the wrapper of a 50 and twisted 

1167
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:17,383
backup.

1168
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:18,863
Mild to smile.
I have four of them and so it gives him 

1169
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:23,663
enough to make you reconsider your 
existence in the universe while he's 

1170
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:30,120
running the soundboard and he doesn't 
fuck up.

1171
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:31,620
He's a good engineer.
It's very good.

1172
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

1173
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:33,623
It's like,
I don't know if it's healthy to be 

1174
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:39,420
around joey all the time like that.
Like it can be really dangerous.

1175
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,280
We'll also joey so good to him.
You know?

1176
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,620
They just have like a very,
very unique relationship man.

1177
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,830
I mean that's a,
that's a god shell,

1178
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,830
that relationship right there because 
Joe,

1179
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,060
he's like a father figure to him.
Kind of.

1180
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,130
Yeah,
and some insane way.

1181
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:57,840
Joe.
He's a sweetheart.

1182
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,610
As long as your on his side.
Yeah.

1183
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:05,840
But the worst place in the world is a 
guy who's against joey.

1184
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,510
Joey's what the worst.
I've seen like God,

1185
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,950
Joey have feuds with people.

1186
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:14,210
It is a horrible thing to watch,
you know,

1187
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:15,063
like,
because he's so passionate about his 

1188
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:21,210
friendship with people that when someone
turns on him,

1189
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,370
like he's the,
as,

1190
00:55:23,371 --> 00:55:26,910
as loving and is friendly and as warm as
he is,

1191
00:55:26,911 --> 00:55:28,890
like you know how he is like when he 
sees you,

1192
00:55:28,891 --> 00:55:29,724
it's all hugs and you know,
he calls you up because her greg 

1193
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,150
Fitzsimmons,
what's going on?

1194
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:35,650
He said he's going to have you guys been
a dick.

1195
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:37,590
You know what you're doing dog,
you know,

1196
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,300
and he loves you.
I love Joey.

1197
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,050
I mean he's my family.
One hundred percent.

1198
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:46,500
But if you turn on him,
man,

1199
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:49,350
it's a fucking horror.
I've seen him go after people.

1200
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:52,530
It's airy.
It's crazy.

1201
00:55:52,531 --> 00:55:57,180
He's so like he's Cuban know.
And he came up.

1202
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,300
He had a really fucked up situation 
going growing up.

1203
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,940
His,
he found his mom did when he was 13.

1204
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:04,410
He was on acid.
Yeah.

1205
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,830
I mean,
so he was raised by his friends.

1206
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,680
Famous a tit that night too.
It wasn't.

1207
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:11,940
Yeah,
it was second.

1208
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,550
Some girls tit on acid found his mom.
Dad.

1209
00:56:14,551 --> 00:56:15,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

1210
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,130
Boy.
Some symbolism in that.

1211
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,040
Oh,
remember when Sugen until it was like,

1212
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,500
oh,
it goes against.

1213
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,920
I don't need anything better than this.
I still.

1214
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,813
It's still my wife.
Thank God I could not have married a 

1215
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:28,654
woman that didn't have nice tits.
There's a lot of women out there with 

1216
00:56:30,551 --> 00:56:32,110
little tips that are angry at you right 
now.

1217
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,880
Sorry,
you're not real women.

1218
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,000
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

1219
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,313
But I couldn't have married one.
I respect you and I'll hang out with 

1220
00:56:41,141 --> 00:56:43,150
you.
I'll let you into my shows,

1221
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,613
but I'm not gonna marry you.
If you get out of the Itty bitty shitty 

1222
00:56:50,591 --> 00:56:52,660
committee early and you want to go see a
comedy show,

1223
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,080
you know,
I,

1224
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:55,990
I look,
I respect all women.

1225
00:56:55,991 --> 00:56:59,500
I just think I really told them.
What about mean ones that kill people.

1226
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,310
Respect them even more.
They're fighting back their meat,

1227
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,120
their meat tooling out there.
Huh?

1228
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,490
Do you hear about the Hashtag?
Me Too.

1229
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:13,060
No,
you're going to love this Joe Rogan.

1230
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,240
There's a thing now because of Harvey 
Weinstein.

1231
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,560
There's a hash tag.
Women that have been sexually harassed.

1232
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:25,980
Pound sign me to on their social media,
Jesus Christ and the end.

1233
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:29,800
You sexually harassed,
I would say it's probably a 100 percent.

1234
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,950
Yeah.
Because it's a murky definition,

1235
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:33,490
right?
You know,

1236
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:34,323
I mean some of the stories that you hear
and I look this Harvey Weinstein thing 

1237
00:57:38,771 --> 00:57:39,604
is atrocious and guys that are like that
are the reason why guys like us have to 

1238
00:57:44,081 --> 00:57:44,914
watch what we say.
All the sensitivity that we've been 

1239
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:51,190
talking about is because of a few,
not a few assets.

1240
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:53,830
There's a lot of assholes,
but it's not.

1241
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,110
I mean we're not talking about a person 
trying to get late.

1242
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:00,270
We're talking about a person who is 
holding employment over people power.

1243
00:58:00,271 --> 00:58:03,430
And did you see the TMC thing?
We're TMZ.

1244
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,073
They were describing the nature of his 
contract that he had sexual assault and 

1245
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:11,463
um,
and sexual harassment lawsuits written 

1246
00:58:16,811 --> 00:58:18,170
into the contract.
Again,

1247
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,840
like a wave or find?
Yeah.

1248
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,360
How much you would be fined.
And for one,

1249
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,160
one,
one.

1250
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:29,080
I'm the person saying it.
It was a certain amount of money for two

1251
00:58:29,081 --> 00:58:30,450
allegations.
Oh no shit.

1252
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:33,660
It was more for three,
it was like he was like 100,000

1253
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,920
to 57 $50 million

1254
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,120
law written in like caps on how much he 
should have to pay.

1255
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:41,103
No,
like how much they would pay him like 

1256
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,950
your or how much he would have to pay 
according to the contract.

1257
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,560
If Weinstein treated someone in 
properly,

1258
00:58:47,561 --> 00:58:50,260
in violation of the company's code of 
conduct,

1259
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,830
he must reimburse twc for the 
settlements or judgments.

1260
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:54,664
Additionally,
you Weinstein will pay the company 

1261
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:01,750
liquidated damages of $250,000
for the first such instance.

1262
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,840
Five hundred thousand dollars for the 
second such instance,

1263
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,713
7:50
for the third and a million for each 

1264
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:13,300
additional instance to just imagine that
they wrote this in.

1265
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:14,830
They're complicit,
they're all complicit.

1266
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:16,860
There's another provision,
uh,

1267
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:20,750
he can be fired for the purpose,
to purpose,

1268
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,010
to Asian.
Have you

1269
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,040
ever sent a perpetuation?
That's a weird word.

1270
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:27,980
Yeah.
It is perpetuation by you.

1271
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:32,090
A Weinstein of a material fraud against 
the company.

1272
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,710
Okay.
What does that mean?

1273
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,260
The question,
where's the fraud?

1274
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:39,380
Lance Mirror off a board member who 
negotiated the Weinstein.

1275
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,243
200,
15,

1276
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,500
2015 contract.
Said in an interview,

1277
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:43,543
and we've confirmed the board knew 
Weinstein had settled prior lawsuits 

1278
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:47,384
brought by various women,
but they assumed it was the coverup 

1279
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,790
consensual affair.
Sure it was.

1280
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,660
The board's assumption does not 
constitute fraud on Weinstein's part.

1281
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,590
Scroll up,
let's keep going.

1282
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,090
More surprisingly is how twc fired 
Weinstein's.

1283
01:00:05,091 --> 01:00:09,860
Suppose Weinstein.
No Weinstein supposedly without giving a

1284
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:10,694
specific reason,
which could potentially violate the 

1285
01:00:12,471 --> 01:00:14,480
terms of the contract.
Oh my God,

1286
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:18,080
that's crazy.
Here's the kicker.

1287
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:18,943
Even if Weinstein had committed fraud by
not fully informing the board of 

1288
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:22,934
directors,
the contract says before he can be 

1289
01:00:24,711 --> 01:00:26,870
fired,
he has the right to mediation.

1290
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:29,360
If that doesn't work,
he's entitled to arbitration.

1291
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,373
He got neither.
He was summarily fired and sources 

1292
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:33,224
connected with Weinstein.
Tell tmz he was never given a specific 

1293
01:00:36,201 --> 01:00:37,370
reason.
Wow.

1294
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:38,470
Well,
he's fighting it.

1295
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:40,870
Yeah,
I love that.

1296
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,540
Where do you get the balls to fight

1297
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,473
back right now?
I guess he feels like he's the only way 

1298
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:51,800
to sort of reclaim some ground.
Yeah,

1299
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:53,510
I mean,
is that a way to look at it?

1300
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,520
Well,
that's that mentality and you know,

1301
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:58,460
at that level,
the power brokers that run Hollywood,

1302
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,590
you know,
they're all fucking.

1303
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:03,080
It's trump is like that too.
It's all aggression.

1304
01:01:03,081 --> 01:01:05,190
It's all come at you when you come here.

1305
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:06,343
Yeah,
I mean it's got to be a crazy position 

1306
01:01:09,121 --> 01:01:11,850
to be in,
to be the head of Miramax.

1307
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:12,773
Yeah.
No,

1308
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,030
I mean it's like,
it's the biggest,

1309
01:01:15,031 --> 01:01:16,130
it's one of the biggest,
right.

1310
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,280
What's the biggest,
what is the biggest studio,

1311
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:24,060
if it's not Miramax is universal.
Miramax,

1312
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:29,240
so at the very least he's responsible 
for some of the most iconic movies over.

1313
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,313
Yeah.

1314
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,280
Certainly the most Oscar is of any 
studio in the last year,

1315
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,780
20 years.
So everyone's kissing his ass.

1316
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,673
Yeah.
Massive amounts of power and this 

1317
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,960
influence over people like royalty,
right?

1318
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,700
Barks,
they all come,

1319
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:45,983
you know,
everybody's at his whim constantly and 

1320
01:01:49,261 --> 01:01:50,094
then tries to fuck all these starlets.
Like if he had just stuck with like 

1321
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,850
prostitutes,
it probably still would come out,

1322
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,380
but it wouldn't come out the same way.

1323
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,313
It wouldn't come out.
You will think about the fact that they 

1324
01:02:01,691 --> 01:02:06,550
covered up sexual assault on it sounds 
like a weekly basis.

1325
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,960
I mean this,
this story broke what five days ago,

1326
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,033
something like that and is already so 
many women that have come out and now 

1327
01:02:14,441 --> 01:02:16,480
you've got a bounty on more women to 
come out.

1328
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:20,250
Like somebody.
I think that somebody is offering

1329
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,890
a certain amount of money for every 
woman that comes out against him,

1330
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:27,930
so it's going to be like cosby all over 
again and you think about.

1331
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:31,480
But God,
because bea was drugging and raping,

1332
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,550
nobody just means it's another step.
Another step more evil though.

1333
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:36,413
Right?
I'm just talking about like the 

1334
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:41,010
frequency of it and,
and the complicity of people that set up

1335
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:44,630
the meetings.
You're covered up to lawsuits.

1336
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,880
Oh yeah.
Gave the women work after the meetings.

1337
01:02:47,881 --> 01:02:49,710
You know,
a lot of them got script deals,

1338
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:53,490
got roles in movies because that's a lot
of them didn't walk out of the room.

1339
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,540
A lot of them gave him the back rub or 
whatever else.

1340
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:57,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

1341
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,340
Well that was what Whitney was talking 
about the other day.

1342
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:01,620
Whitney.
Cummings was telling me,

1343
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:04,020
her and one of her friends who's an 
actress,

1344
01:03:04,021 --> 01:03:04,854
I did their show at the largo the other 
night and they were in the green room 

1345
01:03:07,681 --> 01:03:08,514
and they were talking about how many 
women literally wrote into their 

1346
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:13,620
contract,
like not wrote into it,

1347
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:17,730
but there was an agreement that they 
would fuck him to get like editor's cut.

1348
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,300
They would fuck him to get more lines 
there.

1349
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:21,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

1350
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,033
Girls like prominent actresses had sex 
with him to ensure that they got big 

1351
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:28,890
roles.
This was written down.

1352
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,180
Some of it was agreed upon.
I don't know if they wrote it,

1353
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:34,343
but these things were agreed upon and 
that he always kept his end of the 

1354
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,670
bargain.
He was known.

1355
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:43,671
She's known for hooking them up is part 
of how he got this whole thing to work,

1356
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:46,283
which means every director and editor 
that kept those lines in new because 

1357
01:03:51,121 --> 01:03:54,840
editors all the time or chop chop out 
whole scenes because they don't work.

1358
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,240
Yeah,
but that's only.

1359
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:01,860
That's like say like when did it happen?
Did it happen before the film was shot?

1360
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:05,220
Like she would give them final cut like 
you would allow them to,

1361
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,083
you know,
to be in the editing room or was it 

1362
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:10,241
like,
oh,

1363
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:13,050
I will give you the choice part,
whatever.

1364
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,940
It was like some sneaky deal.
Yeah.

1365
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:16,550
I mean,
who knows who,

1366
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:18,450
how he said it,
who knows how they did it,

1367
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:21,960
but the idea that all these actors are 
coming out and like,

1368
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,580
I have no idea.
I can't believe it.

1369
01:04:23,581 --> 01:04:24,414
I'm so horrified.
How do you not know that I'm a road 

1370
01:04:26,851 --> 01:04:29,520
comic and I knew about it.
I'm not in the middle of Hollywood.

1371
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:31,650
Yeah.
I've known about it for 15 years.

1372
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:35,040
What did you know?
I knew that he was a casting couch guy.

1373
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,530
Everybody knew that he was the sleazy 
fat.

1374
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:38,633
I always would joke about how like I 
think he makes himself less attractive 

1375
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,290
because it's more of a power trip for 
him.

1376
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:44,443
Fun.
Yeah.

1377
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:45,833
Yeah.
To have his fat gut resting on their 

1378
01:04:47,401 --> 01:04:49,130
forehead was shoots a load in their 
mouth.

1379
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,500
You got the part.
Yeah.

1380
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,193
Doesn't blow.
Doesn't wash on purpose as his balls 

1381
01:04:59,671 --> 01:05:03,270
just stink like locker rooms.
Yeah.

1382
01:05:03,271 --> 01:05:04,470
It's a weird thing,
man.

1383
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,220
It's a weird thing that that's.
That went on for forever in this,

1384
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,620
in this industry,
not this industry and the music,

1385
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:12,900
the movie industry,
the music industry as well.

1386
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:18,350
Sturgill Simpson was telling me some 
story about some guy who was a known

1387
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,690
peder asked who is like,
there's.

1388
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:24,720
He's in a similar position in the music 
business and like people know like you,

1389
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:27,040
you can't have like young boys around 
this guy.

1390
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,940
He's some big time powerful guy.
He told me the guy's name.

1391
01:05:30,941 --> 01:05:32,980
I literally can't tell you who the fuck 
it was,

1392
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,240
but he was saying like,
man,

1393
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,093
there's.
There are people in the music business 

1394
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:37,983
that everything the exact same situation
like they fuck people to have them move 

1395
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:43,354
on and move up and move forward.
Especially back when radio was a big 

1396
01:05:47,051 --> 01:05:47,884
deal,
right?

1397
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,330
Radio and record sales were inexorably 
connected.

1398
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:55,150
You could not sell records unless you 
get on the radio.

1399
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:59,830
The only band that that managed to move 
through that was kiss,

1400
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:04,300
kiss was rarely on the radio.
They were rarely on the radio,

1401
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:09,780
but kiss had such a loyal following and 
they put together such an amazing show,

1402
01:06:10,961 --> 01:06:14,710
a live show that they've.
They were selling millions of albums and

1403
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:17,650
got almost no radio time selling out 
arenas,

1404
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,513
almost no radio,
and they were like mocked relentlessly 

1405
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:21,970
by people who really loved rock.

1406
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:23,890
Yeah.
I never liked kiss,

1407
01:06:23,891 --> 01:06:27,250
but I respect what they've done.
I love kiss.

1408
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,360
Really?
Oh yeah.

1409
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:30,250
When I was a kid,
I loved them.

1410
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:33,300
How many songs are there?
Do they really have good shitloads?

1411
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,410
Depends on if you like that kind of 
music.

1412
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:36,191
Yeah,
look,

1413
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:39,820
I mean it's like if I compare it to led 
Zepplin,

1414
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:45,340
like in terms of like,
like the style of music,

1415
01:06:45,341 --> 01:06:50,200
that depth of the composition of the 
music and the lyrics and you know,

1416
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,650
like they don't have anything that's 
like a whole lot of love or anytime.

1417
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:53,920
You know what I mean?
There's like,

1418
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:57,790
there's certain songs that are just on 
another level,

1419
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:59,140
you know,
they don't have any of those.

1420
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,820
Yeah.
But they have fun songs.

1421
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,420
You know,
they're were a live band.

1422
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,390
Yeah.
They have great live shows.

1423
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,240
Yeah.
The live shows a great but and then some

1424
01:07:07,241 --> 01:07:08,074
of their,
some of their song like Beth is a good 

1425
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:11,490
song.
They have a bunch of good songs that are

1426
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,333
like uncharacteristic for like what you 
would think of when you think about 

1427
01:07:16,391 --> 01:07:17,224
kiss.
Yeah.

1428
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:20,620
But you know,
they had like the style of music.

1429
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:23,850
It was like a fun party.
Rock'n'roll Ah,

1430
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:28,600
well no.
Rock and roll and party every day.

1431
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:30,953
Right.
I think that the couple songs I know 

1432
01:07:32,551 --> 01:07:33,384
there is I like,
but when you think about the phenomenon 

1433
01:07:35,941 --> 01:07:36,774
that is kiss,
they really don't have the songs to 

1434
01:07:38,641 --> 01:07:39,474
support it.
Like I feel like the same way I'm going 

1435
01:07:40,761 --> 01:07:41,594
to get shit about saying this aerosmith.
Sarah Smith has like three of the 

1436
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:50,320
greatest rock songs of all time.
Like literally my top 50 rock songs.

1437
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:51,440
Let me,
three of them are error.

1438
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:54,450
We'll walk this way,
dream on dream on.

1439
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:59,630
And a mama can.
No sweet emotions when emotions.

1440
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:03,150
Those three are my top in my top 50 and 
then it ends.

1441
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:06,420
Then he got love in the elevator and all
this shit that makes me go like,

1442
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:09,570
I got to delete my files on this,
on these clowns.

1443
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:10,620
What?
Well,

1444
01:08:10,621 --> 01:08:13,020
you know what happened to them?
Movies.

1445
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:16,130
They started doing those movie anthems 
should never

1446
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:16,963
do those movie anthems.
They did those like armageddon 

1447
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:19,994
soundtrack type things where you know,
like this middle of the road popcorn 

1448
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,143
music for stupid blockbuster film.
They started trying to figure out what 

1449
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:34,580
the audience wanted and giving it to 
them instead of being themselves.

1450
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:36,740
I don't know.
I mean for whatever it is,

1451
01:08:36,741 --> 01:08:39,890
it's like you have two different schools
of thought in that band.

1452
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,410
You have Joe Perry,
who I know.

1453
01:08:42,411 --> 01:08:44,690
He's a great guy who doesn't give a fuck
about fame.

1454
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:45,883
Joe Perry's like a guy from Boston who's
just a bad ass guitarist who loves 

1455
01:08:50,301 --> 01:08:51,620
making rock and roll.
Yeah,

1456
01:08:51,621 --> 01:08:54,080
he's awesome.
And then you've got what?

1457
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,280
Steven?
Tyler Tyler,

1458
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:58,250
who likes being famous and he likes 
doing like what is he on?

1459
01:08:58,251 --> 01:09:01,000
America's got talent or one of those.
Which one of those was the on?

1460
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,900
You did American idol.
Yeah.

1461
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:07,900
It was just once he's an excel,
but that kind of shit like,

1462
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:10,490
could you imagine Robert Plant doing 
American idol?

1463
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:11,893
Well,
I could imagine Mick Jagger doing 

1464
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:15,440
something like that and Keith Richards 
pictures is like the,

1465
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:16,191
uh,
what's that?

1466
01:09:16,191 --> 01:09:17,024
Just to bank checks just to bank checks.
But I think Mick Jagger and Keith 

1467
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:20,900
Richards have a similar kind of 
situation.

1468
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,780
Mick wanted to be famous.
Keith is just a bad ass rocker.

1469
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,340
Mm.
Maybe.

1470
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:28,200
I Dunno.
Huh?

1471
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:31,570
I mean like there's nothing wrong with 
wanting to be famous.

1472
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:32,413
That's what you're into.
But when the music suffers or the music 

1473
01:09:35,391 --> 01:09:37,040
changes,
you know,

1474
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:38,373
you go from sweet emotions to some 
nonsensical moron ballad that literally 

1475
01:09:43,731 --> 01:09:46,090
like it.
It hurts your feelings.

1476
01:09:46,091 --> 01:09:48,320
Yeah.
He listened to some of those ballads and

1477
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:50,060
he just like,
all right,

1478
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:51,980
billy,
Joel's like that.

1479
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:54,820
He's got some of the greatest fucking 
son.

1480
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:55,843
Remember last time we shot pool,
we listened to a few billy Joel's songs 

1481
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:02,270
and then you've got uptown girl.
I've got a billy Joel theory talks about

1482
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:02,760
console.

1483
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,340
Angry.
I know exactly what happened.

1484
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:06,680
Christie Brinkley?
Yeah.

1485
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,010
Too Hot.
A good little guy from long island.

1486
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,173
All of a sudden he's banging the 
supermodel that pitches hot today and 

1487
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:14,870
she's like,
yeah,

1488
01:10:14,871 --> 01:10:16,130
right.
It's hot as fuck.

1489
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:19,490
She's like the hottest 64 year old woman
on the planet.

1490
01:10:19,491 --> 01:10:21,740
And have you seen pictures of her?
I just played.

1491
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,660
I bowled with her recently.
Shut up.

1492
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,381
Yup.
No,

1493
01:10:24,381 --> 01:10:25,910
you didn't look.
See that's when they were together.

1494
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:27,850
That's when he lost his marbles.
Yeah,

1495
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:30,240
that's when it was in the lane next to 
me.

1496
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,870
She looks fucking beautiful.
So where was this?

1497
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:36,860
Venice.
She bowls and Venice and that crazy that

1498
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:38,660
she's in her sixties and he would bang 
it.

1499
01:10:38,661 --> 01:10:39,494
Right.
Would you tell him just because he 

1500
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:44,300
fucked her.
You fuck him because he fucked her.

1501
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:46,010
Yeah.
I wouldn't go that far.

1502
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:47,803
But do you think I would.
I would worry that you would break 

1503
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:50,963
because she's 64.
Send it home here at cracking in her 

1504
01:10:53,481 --> 01:10:55,850
hips.
Is that her in the water?

1505
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,193
How is that possible?
How does she look so hot and so many 

1506
01:10:59,871 --> 01:11:01,820
women falling?
I didn't see Christie,

1507
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,830
frankly.
Cindy Crawford.

1508
01:11:03,831 --> 01:11:08,030
I a new son of a bitch.
You just like Jamie.

1509
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,570
Oh my God.
Look at her.

1510
01:11:11,571 --> 01:11:13,290
But Oh,
that's on her.

1511
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,420
I was like,
that's insane though.

1512
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,840
Oh it is her daughter.
No,

1513
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,770
they're hugging some bitch.
Where's her?

1514
01:11:22,771 --> 01:11:27,710
But he'll come out of that.
But see that's the thing I didn't,

1515
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,630
I don't think you can have a 64 year old
ass.

1516
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:32,110
I think that.
Yeah,

1517
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:32,963
every picture is like from the front and
noticed the bent leg to kind of hide 

1518
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:37,440
any.
Will they all do that?

1519
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:40,890
It's hot as fuck.
Right.

1520
01:11:40,891 --> 01:11:41,724
But look,
you don't see your but go google 

1521
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:48,630
Christie Brinkley's.
But listen,

1522
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,370
you're objectifying women.
No,

1523
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,213
I'm just trying to.
I'm doing a on anatomical survey or 

1524
01:11:54,121 --> 01:11:57,420
something.
Something that's a famous shot.

1525
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,200
Yeah.
But that's like,

1526
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,060
that's her sports illustrated shot.

1527
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,440
Christine blinkers.
But at 60.

1528
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:12,990
Well either way she's done a remarkable 
job of staying attractive.

1529
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:13,973
Very proud.
And I guess what that is is just 

1530
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:16,950
constant effort.
Right?

1531
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:20,700
And maybe some surgery but at the very 
lot of DNA involved too,

1532
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:21,660
right?
Must Be.

1533
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:22,523
Yeah.
Yeah.

1534
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,300
But constant effort,
right?

1535
01:12:24,301 --> 01:12:27,510
Like constant gym time,
watching the Diet.

1536
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:29,240
No.
All that stuff.

1537
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:31,290
A lot of water creates,
you know.

1538
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:34,260
And also they have take it all the best 
skincare products.

1539
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:37,470
Yeah,
I mean that's the business,

1540
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:39,000
you know,
that's her business.

1541
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,330
It's super shocking is when a woman was 
like,

1542
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:47,310
just some smoke and hot and then she 
just lets it go.

1543
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,980
Just let it go.
Like Kathleen Turner.

1544
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:51,960
Ever Seen Kathy Turner today.

1545
01:12:56,370 --> 01:13:00,990
She could be Joey d as a starting level.
Would you have sex with a.

1546
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:02,970
just to say you had sex.
Kathleen Turner though.

1547
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:05,650
What do you think now?
No,

1548
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:07,230
we'll get that picture.
Wow.

1549
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:08,243
Dude.
She was fucking smoke and she had that 

1550
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:15,390
voice.
But I feel like there's a health issue.

1551
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:18,930
Like she's so big.
It doesn't make sense a lot of times.

1552
01:13:18,931 --> 01:13:19,890
Um,
you know,

1553
01:13:19,891 --> 01:13:20,724
they have to take a steroid for 
something and they blow up from the 

1554
01:13:23,221 --> 01:13:25,230
steroid.
Oh Jesus.

1555
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:28,050
Is that real good?
Make that bigger.

1556
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:31,690
See,
I think it's probably alcohol too.

1557
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,920
When you see someone that big,
it's like,

1558
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,510
boy,
you have to eat a lot of foods.

1559
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:36,820
Stay that big.
Yeah.

1560
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:40,260
Unless your booze in it.
Like I know this lady,

1561
01:13:40,261 --> 01:13:43,140
she works out all the time,
but she boozes all the time.

1562
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:44,723
Maybe you just can't.
Her legs are always like just thick and 

1563
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,253
weird.
Fuck the fucking empty calories and 

1564
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:55,490
booze for people who drink like 
everyday.

1565
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,120
Those everyday drinkers.
Man,

1566
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:01,290
that's a,
that's a fucking drunk.

1567
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,510
You're not a real health nut about what 
you eat.

1568
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:07,470
Pizza and fucking.
And then when you wake up in the morning

1569
01:14:07,471 --> 01:14:08,310
you feel like,
shit,

1570
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:10,710
eat more shit.
Oh,

1571
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,153
some P,
I dunno.

1572
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:12,993
Maybe Kathleen Turner.
Maybe she made so much money and her 

1573
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:18,910
natural body is big and she just went,
fuck it.

1574
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:22,180
I'm going to enjoy my life and not 
suffer like Kathleen,

1575
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:23,980
like I'm Christie Brinkley.

1576
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:25,563
That sounds like something,
a woman who got really big would say no 

1577
01:14:29,561 --> 01:14:32,650
one's natural bodies overweight.
That's just not that.

1578
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:33,603
If you're doing that,
it's because you're eating the wrong 

1579
01:14:35,081 --> 01:14:37,060
food.
You're not exercising,

1580
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:40,600
you're definitely overeating and you're 
most likely drinking.

1581
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:44,300
Like that's not someone who's thick.
That's,

1582
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,600
you know,
that's an obese woman.

1583
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:47,500
Yeah,
I mean that's,

1584
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,300
that's.
We'll get our dude.

1585
01:14:49,301 --> 01:14:52,330
She was the hottest woo.
She was hot.

1586
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,750
Was that movie body heat with her?
And uh,

1587
01:14:56,140 --> 01:15:00,100
was that Jeff Bridges or William hurt?
Romancing the stone?

1588
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,053
Oh,
that was like a rip off of Indiana 

1589
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:03,131
Jones,
right?

1590
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:05,140
With Michael Douglas.
Yeah.

1591
01:15:05,141 --> 01:15:07,900
Those like Michael Douglas was like the 
Indiana Jones character,

1592
01:15:07,901 --> 01:15:11,260
but it was kinda like a semi comedy.
Romancing the stone.

1593
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:13,990
Yeah.
It was like he was the archaeologist.

1594
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,273
God,
it's hard to remember why they made a 

1595
01:15:16,871 --> 01:15:20,410
lot of shitty movies back then,
romancing the stone,

1596
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,590
trying to go back and watch those 
things.

1597
01:15:23,591 --> 01:15:24,270
You'd be like,
wow.

1598
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:28,170
I know they were so dated Hirsi working 
girl lately.

1599
01:15:28,171 --> 01:15:31,980
What's that?
It was a melanie griffith and she played

1600
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:32,814
a girl from Staten Island who like is a 
secretary at a law firm and she's a 

1601
01:15:38,551 --> 01:15:40,370
paralegal or something.
No,

1602
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:43,800
maybe an ad agency.
Yes.

1603
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:45,840
No,
that's not her.

1604
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:48,300
That's I'm Melanie Griffith.
Is it?

1605
01:15:48,301 --> 01:15:49,020
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1606
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:49,853
Because you know,
who else has got the big hair on this 

1607
01:15:50,701 --> 01:15:53,700
movie is I'm Joan.
Joan.

1608
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:56,130
Joan cusak.
Yeah.

1609
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:01,460
So there's supposed to be like girl from
long island or something.

1610
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:02,323
Yeah.
And they're working at the fancy 

1611
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:04,184
Manhattan office,
but they're like the gum chewing 

1612
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,910
cigarette smoking,
like that's real.

1613
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,140
And then she,
uh,

1614
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:11,240
she,
she loves her way up.

1615
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:14,390
Oh,
it's a great fucking movie,

1616
01:16:14,391 --> 01:16:19,391
but it's so the fashion and the Harris.
She was hot back in the alien days,

1617
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,220
right.
She was so hot.

1618
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:29,810
It's a rough world man.
Look at Harrison Ford Hansen bastard.

1619
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:31,003
It's weird that we're watching these 
people age to like the point of decay 

1620
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:41,020
right in front of us because that really
wasn't a thing until about 50 years ago,

1621
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:44,270
but if you really stopped,
you never got to see that.

1622
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:46,520
You never got to see someone that age in
front of you like that,

1623
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:50,420
like until mean 50 years maybe.
No,

1624
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,780
maybe a little bit more.
Maybe let's get generous.

1625
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:54,643
Seventy,
80 years like this is a new cultural 

1626
01:16:56,841 --> 01:17:01,841
phenomenon to have visual evidence of 
decay that you go over with a fine tooth

1627
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:05,360
comb and never like this where I could 
say,

1628
01:17:05,361 --> 01:17:06,620
hey,
pull that shit up Jamie.

1629
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,690
Let's take a look at Kathleen turn when 
she was young.

1630
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:09,980
Oh yeah.
I'm

1631
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,840
sure it didn't exist before.
After pictures.

1632
01:17:11,841 --> 01:17:15,050
They're already smashed together in some
photos for sure.

1633
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:15,621
And it's like,
no,

1634
01:17:15,621 --> 01:17:16,454
you look at like Bette Davis.
She got to a certain age and then she 

1635
01:17:18,561 --> 01:17:19,670
just went,
okay,

1636
01:17:19,671 --> 01:17:21,710
I'll be in my match and lock it up 
behind me.

1637
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,950
I'll see you at my funeral.
They just crawled out of the way,

1638
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:27,350
like a pigeon that got injured or 
Elizabeth Taylor.

1639
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:32,351
She just kept marrying new gay guys.
Some new obviously gay guy.

1640
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:38,030
She does.
She know like what the fuck's happening?

1641
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:39,150
She was like seven,
eight.

1642
01:17:39,151 --> 01:17:41,780
They were like 45 year old gay guys.
Oh,

1643
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,673
look at that.
Nineteen 83 smirnoff with Bette Davis 

1644
01:17:45,921 --> 01:17:47,000

1645
01:17:47,001 --> 01:17:49,580
Jim beam.
To have a kind of originals.

1646
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:50,271
Why don't I say,
oh,

1647
01:17:50,271 --> 01:17:53,600
smirnoff vodka ad.
Wow.

1648
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:55,010
Who was that?
The other one.

1649
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,560
Diane.
What is her name?

1650
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,720
Where it says in the ad right there on 
83 smirnoff vodka.

1651
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:06,280
What's the woman's name?
Who's Diahann Carroll.

1652
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:07,123
What a weird way to spell diane.
D I a h a n n maybe she's a 

1653
01:18:11,391 --> 01:18:13,040
photographer.
Maybe she's a lot of work.

1654
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:16,940
She likes changed the spelling.
Her name be crafty.

1655
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,420
There's a lot of Diane's d I a n,
e R,

1656
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:22,460
not a lot of women.
I'm very definitely get mad when you.

1657
01:18:22,461 --> 01:18:26,990
Correct People d I a h a and yeah,
if you read it out,

1658
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:31,470
dum dee had diane.
My name is Diane,

1659
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,620
but why don't you spell it?
Diane?

1660
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,350
Crazy bitch.
So phonetic language.

1661
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:38,570
Yeah.
Who?

1662
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,410
Oh,
she goes dynasty.

1663
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,100
Oh,
from dynasty.

1664
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:45,860
There's a new dynasty apparently.
How good.

1665
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:47,870
There's an ad.
It's hilarious.

1666
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:51,410
It's a billboard and the billboard,
there's like a,

1667
01:18:51,411 --> 01:18:52,244
this guy and a couple of pretty women 
behind them and one of the pretty women 

1668
01:18:54,531 --> 01:18:56,760
has our tongue out like this,
like,

1669
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,210
like showing you a little of her tongue.

1670
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:02,900
That's something that unless you're a 
Rockstar,

1671
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,530
men just don't do like men never take a 
picture.

1672
01:19:05,531 --> 01:19:07,820
Try to look sexy and like.
Yeah,

1673
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:08,541
right.
Yeah.

1674
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:09,470
Look,
just look at her tongue.

1675
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,780
Oh yeah,
that fucking picture.

1676
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:13,130
Like what is,
first of all,

1677
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,220
it's on the CW,
which uh,

1678
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,513
I don't even know if I have,
there's certain channels like I didn't 

1679
01:19:21,171 --> 01:19:22,640
even know.
I don't have epics.

1680
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:23,773
Direct TV doesn't have epics,
so I try to watch someone special on 

1681
01:19:27,321 --> 01:19:28,250
epics and I was like,
oh,

1682
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:29,113
I don't have that fucking thing.
So that one bitch is pulling the other 

1683
01:19:31,581 --> 01:19:35,240
bitches hair with the tongue out.
Hung out like,

1684
01:19:35,241 --> 01:19:36,380
yeah,
don't want to violate.

1685
01:19:36,381 --> 01:19:39,290
I stick my tongue out to lick the tip of
Dick's.

1686
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:41,383
Like,
what is that?

1687
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:42,283
Like?
Who told her to stick her tongue out 

1688
01:19:42,981 --> 01:19:43,581
like that?
Yeah,

1689
01:19:43,581 --> 01:19:44,630
baby.
Perfect.

1690
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:45,680
Perfect.
I like it.

1691
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,023
What if they didn't live it?
They photoshop their tongue out there 

1692
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,030
and she got the photos.
Just like,

1693
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:52,250
what the fuck is this stupid shit?
Yeah.

1694
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:55,370
What of my tongue out.
The editor made a choice.

1695
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:58,310
An artistic choice.
This is the new like kiss,

1696
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,080
kiss face.
The selfie face.

1697
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:02,330
Who's the one that you just pulled up?
That gay picture you just pulled up.

1698
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,280
Oh,
it was a bunch of guys.

1699
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:06,830
While the guys are fighting,
the black guy's going to kick that white

1700
01:20:06,831 --> 01:20:07,411
guys.
Why?

1701
01:20:07,411 --> 01:20:08,250
We were pretending he's not.

1702
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,410
Now he's eyeballing them that were 
black.

1703
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:15,090
I was going to fuck that white guy up.
I can tell by looking at their faces.

1704
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:18,210
Yeah,
that's true.

1705
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:20,150
You find that with mma you can

1706
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:22,560
tell from the way ends and all that?
Nope.

1707
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,000
Who's got an edge?
Definitely can't.

1708
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:25,140
Now.
You think you can.

1709
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,300
You're often wrong.
Yeah,

1710
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:29,190
you can't.
You can't tell.

1711
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:31,050
There's a lot of guys that look like 
doughboys,

1712
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,140
but they could fight.
They just know how to fight in.

1713
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,680
It's also they know how to endure.
Sometimes guys,

1714
01:20:37,681 --> 01:20:39,750
when they don't look physically 
impressive,

1715
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:40,763
have had to deal with so many people 
fucking with them their whole life that 

1716
01:20:43,431 --> 01:20:47,250
the develop this sort of like Werewolf 
personality,

1717
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:49,230
like where they can just go,
oh yeah,

1718
01:20:49,231 --> 01:20:52,260
mother fucker.
And then they just keep coming.

1719
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:54,270
They keep coming at you and they just 
never.

1720
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,770
They never get discouraged.
Yeah,

1721
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:57,773
and those guys,
like a lot of times guys are not 

1722
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:00,564
physically gifted.
They have incredible work ethic because 

1723
01:21:03,481 --> 01:21:07,240
they have to because that's the only way
they can compete and so they like,

1724
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:10,380
they'll slowly break guys down just with
toughness.

1725
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:15,770
The problem with those guys is they take
all the extreme beating,

1726
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:18,300
right?
We're right and it's not sustainable.

1727
01:21:18,301 --> 01:21:23,301
And then one day they run into a guy who
was both like see there's discipline and

1728
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:25,314
there's talent and a lot of times 
talented people don't have discipline 

1729
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:29,423
and you just wish they did because then 
they'd be the greatest ever will the 

1730
01:21:32,641 --> 01:21:35,310
greatest ever or the guys with talent 
and discipline,

1731
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,590
like Anderson Silva or someone like 
that,

1732
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,513
like talented,
but also like physically superior just 

1733
01:21:42,451 --> 01:21:46,650
moves faster and then also works 
incredibly hard.

1734
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:49,740
Right?
And then also can perform under pressure

1735
01:21:49,741 --> 01:21:50,574
and knows how to come back from behind.
Like knows that knows that it turned 

1736
01:21:53,851 --> 01:21:56,040
around when he's getting his ass kicked.
Yeah.

1737
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:59,430
That's the third aspect is you have to 
have the psychological.

1738
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:00,473
You have to be able to take it.
You have to be able to be the hammer or 

1739
01:22:02,041 --> 01:22:02,874
the nail,
right?

1740
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:05,490
You gotta be able to be the nail bar.
Guys can't be the nail.

1741
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,020
They start getting hit on me like fuck 
this,

1742
01:22:07,021 --> 01:22:07,854
I'm going to get out of there.
And some guys are great in there like 

1743
01:22:11,131 --> 01:22:13,620
that some.
So there's some great fighters that just

1744
01:22:13,621 --> 01:22:15,990
can't take a beating.
It's a very strange.

1745
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:21,320
Fighting is the weirdest of all sports 
because it's not really a sport.

1746
01:22:22,561 --> 01:22:24,780
It may kind of is.
It's an athletic endeavor,

1747
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:26,093
but it's so much more emotional intense 
than just a regular sport like calling 

1748
01:22:30,391 --> 01:22:33,780
it a sport.
It's just there's so much more to.

1749
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:36,150
It's more personal.
Taken off to the bathroom.

1750
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:40,320
Jamie can't handle it.
Jamie can't handle it now.

1751
01:22:40,321 --> 01:22:42,470
We don't get to see him sneak around 
behind you anymore.

1752
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,980
We have a new setup.
Yeah.

1753
01:22:43,981 --> 01:22:45,750
You should have a camera in the 
bathroom.

1754
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:49,090
You can get sued for that.
You can.

1755
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,360
Yeah.
You ever hear about Chuck Berry?

1756
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:52,203
Yes.

1757
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:58,790
That came out.
That was another thing I knew.

1758
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,900
I had heard rumors and again am I in the
fucking music industry.

1759
01:23:03,170 --> 01:23:06,880
I had heard rumors that chuck had hours 
and hours

1760
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,713
of footage of women pissing and shitting
and that he had cameras hidden in the 

1761
01:23:13,361 --> 01:23:16,270
toilet seats of his restaurant in 
Illinois.

1762
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:17,463
I knew this shit for years and then all 
of a sudden it came out in the news and 

1763
01:23:21,761 --> 01:23:24,820
there was a class action law suit that I
believe he lost,

1764
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:28,900
I should say,
I should say all of this with supposedly

1765
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:30,700
allegedly don't get sued.
Allegedly.

1766
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:31,563
Well,
he's dead.

1767
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,433
He can get away with.
Oh,

1768
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,940
is he dead?
But I mean,

1769
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:36,790
it's amazing that this shit is out 
there.

1770
01:23:36,791 --> 01:23:37,624
Bill Cosby,
I knew that Bill Cosby was molesting 

1771
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:40,144
women soda juice.
I knew it because when I was on the set 

1772
01:23:42,431 --> 01:23:43,264
of news radio people knew him from 
whatever thing and there was always the 

1773
01:23:47,741 --> 01:23:49,390
thing that bill cosby drugs.
Women.

1774
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:51,910
Yeah.
And I had heard it like what he does.

1775
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:53,540
Yeah.
Like it was always some weird thing.

1776
01:23:53,541 --> 01:23:54,730
I never met him,
but I,

1777
01:23:54,731 --> 01:23:58,960
I don't even think I knew someone who 
had been around him.

1778
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:02,840
I think it was just like one of those 
things where people just knew.

1779
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:08,230
You just knew like that Michael Jackson 
was probably Dylan kids.

1780
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:11,070
We knew it because we knew,
uh Oh,

1781
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:13,450
well that's a thing that's coming up.
What do we know?

1782
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:14,583
Do we know somebody who did we know we 
knew somebody who was sent a boy to the 

1783
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:21,490
ranch.
What's,

1784
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:22,863
who's we?
I don't want to say on the air who it 

1785
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:26,134
is.

1786
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:31,460
Somebody in the industry,
but when you say we knew like who's we?

1787
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:33,550
You and I me.
Yeah.

1788
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,360
I did not know someone who sent a boy to
the.

1789
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:39,050
Unless I didn't know they send a boy the
ranch.

1790
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,630
Maybe you didn't know.
You didn't know.

1791
01:24:41,631 --> 01:24:43,550
I'll tell you off the air.
Jesus Christ.

1792
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:46,120
What about all these people that are 
listening to this fence right now?

1793
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:48,410
I know I shouldn't have brought it up.
Yeah,

1794
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:53,500
you shouldn't have some of the pitch 
night making all these people out there.

1795
01:24:54,201 --> 01:24:57,530
Don't know.
Girl.

1796
01:24:57,531 --> 01:24:59,660
Hanging out with Fred.
Who Was it?

1797
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:02,840
Yeah.
Well I think it's one of the reasons why

1798
01:25:02,841 --> 01:25:05,030
we like really good stuff too,
right?

1799
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,180
Because we can't imagine being able to 
do that.

1800
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,103
Right?
Like when you see someone who's like 

1801
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:13,850
playing like you see like Gary Clark Jr,
something playing guitar on stage.

1802
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,530
Mesmer.
Damn.

1803
01:25:15,531 --> 01:25:17,660
That guy's good.
Like Holy Shit.

1804
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:19,940
You know,
there's something about watching someone

1805
01:25:19,941 --> 01:25:20,774
who's mesmerizing that's equally 
captivating as watching someone who's 

1806
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:24,830
awful.
Yeah.

1807
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:27,530
Look at um,
what's his name from Queen?

1808
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:30,500
Freddie Mercury.
Freddie Mercury.

1809
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:33,200
Oh yeah.
I mean that guy fucking went for it.

1810
01:25:33,910 --> 01:25:37,310
He went for it back in the day when no 
one even knew he was gay.

1811
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:38,213
Right.
They didn't understand like what a gay 

1812
01:25:39,561 --> 01:25:44,060
front man was like,
now you could be a gay front man now,

1813
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:44,894
like Elton John is openly gay.
Everyone knows it and he goes out there 

1814
01:25:48,321 --> 01:25:52,360
and sayings and everybody goes nuts and 
back then you couldn't.

1815
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:57,370
Then he Lindley stadium with a mustache 
sticking out and a leather vast.

1816
01:25:58,340 --> 01:26:01,190
We have champions.
Yeah.

1817
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:03,980
But you got to think he must gotten that
big

1818
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,650
when they were playing bars and saloons 
on their way up.

1819
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,100
He must've been going big then.
Yeah.

1820
01:26:09,101 --> 01:26:11,060
Yeah.
Where it probably looked ridiculous,

1821
01:26:11,061 --> 01:26:12,710
but certain people got it.

1822
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:16,620
Well,
he's so good that even when he was doing

1823
01:26:16,621 --> 01:26:17,454
those bars,
people must have heard that voice and 

1824
01:26:18,631 --> 01:26:20,040
went,
Holy Shit.

1825
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:21,550
Listen to this guy.
Right?

1826
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:24,480
Because he could carry a fucking note.
Look at that.

1827
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:25,363
Pretty sure.
That's from the movie that they're 

1828
01:26:26,971 --> 01:26:28,280
making about them.
Oh really?

1829
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:30,000
That's not him.
Oh Wow.

1830
01:26:30,001 --> 01:26:31,430
That guy looks amazingly well.
Can.

1831
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:32,280
Yeah.
Oh,

1832
01:26:32,281 --> 01:26:37,281
I thought his name is Malik is the 
actor's name was Brian j singer.

1833
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:39,993
Is that that?
I think Sasha Baron Cohen wanted that 

1834
01:26:42,121 --> 01:26:43,110
role.
Really?

1835
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:44,520
Yeah,
he probably would have nailed it.

1836
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:48,060
Yep.
Wonder whether they give it to them.

1837
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:50,850
I mean,
it's almost like a keep bob.

1838
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:52,800
Did you see that?
What was it?

1839
01:26:52,801 --> 01:26:57,000
Live aid where they were simulcasting 
from London and Philadelphia at the same

1840
01:26:57,001 --> 01:26:57,900
time.
Scroll up,

1841
01:26:57,930 --> 01:27:00,750
scroll up there,
and he fucking stole the shell.

1842
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:05,910
That's him for real live aid.
Where Sasha Baron Cohen stole the show.

1843
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:08,160
Who now we're a Freddie.
Mercury.

1844
01:27:08,161 --> 01:27:13,161
Did know it was back in 80 fourish.
When did he die?

1845
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:19,630
He was like one of the first big names 
to diabetes.

1846
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:22,420
Where you heard about you on what?
Right.

1847
01:27:22,930 --> 01:27:24,520
Fucked up man.
Ninety one.

1848
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:25,760
Eighty one.
Ninety one.

1849
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:27,550
Ninety one.
Nobody dies ways.

1850
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:28,870
Now.
It's a very rare.

1851
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,970
Yeah.
I don't say nobody,

1852
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:34,150
but it's saying like nobody dies a 
syphilis and you still can,

1853
01:27:34,151 --> 01:27:39,040
but she,
the California just recently reduced the

1854
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:44,041
penalty of not telling someone that you 
have HIV.

1855
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:45,190
Oh,
did they?

1856
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:48,970
Yeah.
Like wantonly infecting someone with HIV

1857
01:27:48,971 --> 01:27:51,070
is no longer a felony.
Why?

1858
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:55,120
The guy who introduced it,
the senator,

1859
01:27:55,121 --> 01:27:55,954
there's a fucking picture of him.
New California law reduces penalty for 

1860
01:27:58,631 --> 01:28:01,690
knowingly exposing someone to HIV.
Why the fuck would you do that?

1861
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:04,480
HIV is a public health issue,
not a criminal issue.

1862
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:08,140
California state Senator Scott Wiener 
said in support of the bill,

1863
01:28:08,141 --> 01:28:13,141
which takes now Google that guy and find
a picture of him with his shirt off with

1864
01:28:13,301 --> 01:28:14,134
a leather vest on a six pack and a dog 
collar around his neck and I'm not 

1865
01:28:17,051 --> 01:28:17,740
kidding.

1866
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:21,010
I'm not kidding.
Like there's a fucking image of him.

1867
01:28:21,011 --> 01:28:22,810
That's him,
but he's jacked.

1868
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:24,700
There's.
But there's a photo.

1869
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,500
Oh yeah.
Look at this.

1870
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:28,510
Sorry,
not a dog collar.

1871
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:31,360
He's got a leather tie wrapped around 
his neck.

1872
01:28:31,361 --> 01:28:33,610
Might as well be a dog collar.
But look at this.

1873
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:37,270
This is the guy.
If he's not gay,

1874
01:28:37,271 --> 01:28:38,104
he's certainly sympathetic to the cause 
and this is the guy that's supporting 

1875
01:28:41,291 --> 01:28:44,350
this bill saying that HIV is a health 
issue.

1876
01:28:44,351 --> 01:28:46,240
No,
it's not a health issue.

1877
01:28:46,270 --> 01:28:47,103
If you fucking knowingly give it to 
somebody via knowingly shoot a hot load 

1878
01:28:51,761 --> 01:28:54,820
into someone knowing you have HIV,
you get back from the doctor.

1879
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:55,780
Doctor says,
Greg,

1880
01:28:55,781 --> 01:28:59,800
I got some bad news for you.
You got the Hib and you're like,

1881
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:00,634
well,
I got bad news for everyone's shooting 

1882
01:29:02,251 --> 01:29:04,150
loads to because I'm not going to tell 
them.

1883
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:05,720
I like shooting loads into people.

1884
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:09,060
I don't like condoms.
Like you're doing a criminal act.

1885
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:10,740
It's.
It's a deadly weapon.

1886
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:14,760
Your semen is a deadly weapon.
Not Today if you get treatment,

1887
01:29:14,761 --> 01:29:16,350
but what if someone doesn't like 
doctors?

1888
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:17,910
Yeah.
What have they're afraid of?

1889
01:29:17,911 --> 01:29:19,620
Doctors.
There's a lot of people that are afraid.

1890
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:22,470
They're afraid to go into the doctor so 
they don't go to the doctor.

1891
01:29:22,471 --> 01:29:24,450
HIV turns into a's.
They'd die of AIDS.

1892
01:29:24,451 --> 01:29:27,720
You fucking gave it to him that that was
that not a felony.

1893
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:29,910
Right?
Who would want to reduce that crime?

1894
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:31,073
Who'd want to reduce the crime of 
knowingly exposing someone to a death 

1895
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:36,623
dealing disease,
a disease that's killed untold hundreds 

1896
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,330
of thousands if not millions of people 
worldwide.

1897
01:29:42,331 --> 01:29:43,164
Right?
Mean,

1898
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:45,090
I don't know what the numbers,
but it's probably the millions,

1899
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:46,560
right?
Yeah.

1900
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:47,453
But why would you do that?
Like who's clamoring for that to be 

1901
01:29:50,701 --> 01:29:53,940
reduced?
When I think about how many guys are,

1902
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:57,210
what do they call it on the down low 
where they go out and they have sex with

1903
01:29:57,211 --> 01:29:58,044
men,
get sick and then have sex with their 

1904
01:30:00,001 --> 01:30:00,740
wives.

1905
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:04,580
A lot of wives get aids or HIV,
right?

1906
01:30:04,581 --> 01:30:06,460
I get HIV.
Yeah.

1907
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:09,200
That's,
that's uh,

1908
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:13,110
that's one of those diseases where they 
essentially found a cure for it.

1909
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:15,930
Right?
They have a treatment and that treatment

1910
01:30:15,931 --> 01:30:18,840
reduces it to the point where it's not 
even.

1911
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:22,110
You can't even detect it in the blood 
anymore.

1912
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:23,443
Oh,
it's that good.

1913
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:24,803
It's undetectable.
Like Magic Johnson said that Jesus did 

1914
01:30:27,391 --> 01:30:28,920
it for him.
Jesus made,

1915
01:30:29,210 --> 01:30:32,730
made my hiv go away.
No longer detectable.

1916
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:36,990
That is so cool to magic.
Johnson accent is horrible impression.

1917
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:38,311
But yeah,
they,

1918
01:30:38,311 --> 01:30:41,610
they literally have gotten into the 
point where it's undetectable.

1919
01:30:41,611 --> 01:30:45,390
What does it say number of deaths due to
HIV AIDS estimates by country?

1920
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:46,740
Yeah,
there was a million last year,

1921
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:50,300
but it has no data for United States.
See,

1922
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:51,383
the thing about that is,
and this is how it's been explained to 

1923
01:30:53,611 --> 01:30:54,444
me,
so I'm sure if someone will correct me 

1924
01:30:55,201 --> 01:30:58,200
if I'm wrong,
the problem with this distinction,

1925
01:30:58,230 --> 01:30:59,063
and this is one of the real problems 
with the way they used it to describe 

1926
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:02,903
Africa,
they were saying all these people in 

1927
01:31:06,121 --> 01:31:08,700
Africa get aids and die.

1928
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,650
Well,
this doctor was telling me,

1929
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:13,710
and he's just completely off the record 
when he was telling me this because he's

1930
01:31:13,711 --> 01:31:14,340
like,
well,

1931
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,420
progressive,
very smart liberal guy.

1932
01:31:16,421 --> 01:31:17,870
So like,
okay.

1933
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,600
He goes,
what you're talking about is people with

1934
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:22,463
extremely compromised immune systems.
That's from a variety of different 

1935
01:31:25,291 --> 01:31:26,310
reasons.
He goes,

1936
01:31:26,311 --> 01:31:28,110
dude,
they're not getting HIV tests,

1937
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,033
and he goes,
these people in these really poor areas 

1938
01:31:30,691 --> 01:31:31,620
in Africa,
this is,

1939
01:31:31,621 --> 01:31:33,900
you know,
we're talking like early two thousands.

1940
01:31:34,190 --> 01:31:35,023
He's like,
they're not giving these people HIV 

1941
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:37,524
tests.
They're not flying to Africa and 

1942
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:41,130
administering these expensive tests on 
these people.

1943
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:42,143
He's like,
these people have extremely compromised 

1944
01:31:43,141 --> 01:31:45,060
immune systems.
They checked their t cell count,

1945
01:31:45,061 --> 01:31:45,894
low t cell counts are very low,
they're very unhealthy and so they say 

1946
01:31:48,781 --> 01:31:52,830
they have aids and that's how you get 
funding and get funding.

1947
01:31:52,831 --> 01:31:53,664
As you say,
there's a million cases of AIDS in 

1948
01:31:54,871 --> 01:31:55,410
Africa.

1949
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:56,243
You don't get funding when you say 
there's a million cases of people who 

1950
01:31:58,111 --> 01:32:02,260
are malnourished,
who have a host of horrific diseases and

1951
01:32:02,261 --> 01:32:03,094
acceptable that we're trending to 50 
percent of African American gay bi men 

1952
01:32:07,301 --> 01:32:09,580
having HIV must end this health 
disparity.

1953
01:32:09,581 --> 01:32:10,271
Why are you pulling that?
Oh,

1954
01:32:10,271 --> 01:32:11,500
that's.
That's wiener.

1955
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:13,630
That's the guy.
His name's wiener,

1956
01:32:13,631 --> 01:32:16,400
which is hilarious.
Now they're wiener wiener,

1957
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:17,643
but unacceptable that we're trending to 
50 percent of African American gay bi 

1958
01:32:20,081 --> 01:32:22,870
men having HIV.
Meanwhile he says,

1959
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:23,704
must end this health disparity and the 
best way to end it is to reduce the 

1960
01:32:26,861 --> 01:32:30,140
penalty from knowingly giving it.
It's just,

1961
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:35,020
I don't want to say that he has it and 
he just wants to make it a little easier

1962
01:32:35,021 --> 01:32:37,060
on himself,
but it's.

1963
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,790
Why would you do that?
Like why would you want to reduce that?

1964
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:42,190
Owen Benjamin had a great tweet about 
it.

1965
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:47,590
Allow Charlie something about allowing 
Charlie Sheen to,

1966
01:32:47,591 --> 01:32:48,424
uh,
California is allowing Charlie Sheen to 

1967
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:51,423
have less of a penalty for having 
unprotected sex with unsuspecting young 

1968
01:32:56,591 --> 01:32:58,460
women.
You fucking psychos like that.

1969
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:00,250
Yeah.
Well,

1970
01:33:00,251 --> 01:33:00,790
it's,
you know,

1971
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:03,760
the question is can you legislate 
behavior,

1972
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:04,530
right?

1973
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:07,100
Kenya,
it's a tricky one.

1974
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,660
Can you lead,
do you want to write?

1975
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:14,900
Do you want to legislate behavior or do 
you want people to just be like,

1976
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:19,290
but you have to punish people for why.
Like if,

1977
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:22,770
if you have some sort of an incurable 
disease,

1978
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,040
aids obviously is curable or HIV is 
right.

1979
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:29,670
At least at this point it's treatable.
I shouldn't say curable,

1980
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:32,580
but if you have something like what 
would it be?

1981
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:33,570
Okay.
Like,

1982
01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:34,680
here's a perfect example.
Member.

1983
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:35,543
When that woman came back from Africa 
and they suspected that she had been 

1984
01:33:38,401 --> 01:33:39,234
exposed to Ebola and people were 
freaking the fuck out because she was 

1985
01:33:41,671 --> 01:33:42,840
wandering around,
she was like,

1986
01:33:42,841 --> 01:33:44,180
I'm not,
I'm not going to be quarantined.

1987
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:45,810
Fuck off.
And they're like,

1988
01:33:45,811 --> 01:33:47,650
this bitch is a monster.
Right?

1989
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:53,520
That's much more communicable than HIV 
is,

1990
01:33:53,521 --> 01:33:56,350
I guess,
but not much difference in terms of like

1991
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:59,190
what it can do and then you're talking 
about something that kills people,

1992
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:00,053
right?
It's Kinda the same thing and a lot of 

1993
01:34:01,681 --> 01:34:02,514
ways,
but we,

1994
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:07,640
we tend to look past things that are 
sexually transmitted because I don't get

1995
01:34:08,461 --> 01:34:09,291
fucked,
you know what I mean?

1996
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:10,170
Problems,
you know,

1997
01:34:10,171 --> 01:34:11,004
don't do anything that Jesus wouldn't 
want you to do and you don't have any 

1998
01:34:13,321 --> 01:34:14,850
issues.
What do you take it in the ass,

1999
01:34:14,851 --> 01:34:18,150
you fucking piece of shit.
You horrible person.

2000
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:19,583
No.

2001
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:21,070
Now it's like,
now we're there.

2002
01:34:21,071 --> 01:34:21,904
Um,
they're allowing companies to not have 

2003
01:34:24,851 --> 01:34:29,140
to cover women's birth control and it's 
like they want to shame.

2004
01:34:29,141 --> 01:34:31,780
They want to shame people from having 
sex.

2005
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:34,150
It's the same thing with,
uh,

2006
01:34:34,690 --> 01:34:35,410
you know,
uh,

2007
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:37,960
not paying for abortions.
Do you really think that's what it is?

2008
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,310
I think orgasms are free and the,
and the,

2009
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:41,840
the,
the,

2010
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,370
the haves fucking drives me crazy.
I don't think that's what it is.

2011
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:48,960
I think it's a financial issue.
I think if you look behind it,

2012
01:34:48,961 --> 01:34:52,260
I bet there's probably insurance 
companies that are involved in.

2013
01:34:52,261 --> 01:34:54,300
This was probably a lot of people that 
look,

2014
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,970
if you're,
if you have to pay or companies,

2015
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:57,983
if company has to pay for your 
employee's birth control pills and you 

2016
01:35:00,921 --> 01:35:02,390
have 100,000
employees,

2017
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:04,220
how many birth control pills you paying 
for?

2018
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:05,860
That's a lot of money.
I mean,

2019
01:35:05,861 --> 01:35:08,090
and you go across the board and also you
set a precedent.

2020
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,670
If you have to pay for that,
maybe you have to pay for something that

2021
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:11,504
comes along with similar to for men or 
some other issue that women might have 

2022
01:35:14,301 --> 01:35:15,134
that has to be covered.
I think it's all financial expensive 

2023
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:21,680
though to have women missing work for 
pregnancies,

2024
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:22,573
firearm,
fuck them.

2025
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:26,150
It's kind of a weird thing,
right?

2026
01:35:26,151 --> 01:35:27,770
It's because.
Because if somebody works for you,

2027
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,690
they don't just work for you.
Right?

2028
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:32,480
We are assuming that person is dependent
upon you.

2029
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,700
Just one of the weirder things about 
employment.

2030
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:38,720
It's like that's not just someone who 
works for you.

2031
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:39,554
You have to take care of that person.
You're supposed to provide them with 

2032
01:35:42,771 --> 01:35:43,604
insurance.
You're supposed to provide them with 

2033
01:35:45,261 --> 01:35:49,580
benefits.
He's supposed to allow them to take time

2034
01:35:49,581 --> 01:35:53,500
off and it's a weird thing because 
we're,

2035
01:35:53,501 --> 01:35:54,334
we're like,
we've settled into the idea that this 

2036
01:35:56,061 --> 01:35:58,310
person is completely dependent upon 
their employer.

2037
01:35:58,760 --> 01:35:59,593
You know,
I think I'm like this idea that if a 

2038
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:08,291
woman has a child that you have to give 
her maternity leave,

2039
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:09,343
we have to pay her while she has the 
baby and that you have to maybe pay 

2040
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:13,934
child support or some sort of child care
while she has the baby that people 

2041
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:20,990
really want that they want that as part 
of it because people,

2042
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:23,990
the way people live in this country in 
particular,

2043
01:36:23,991 --> 01:36:28,991
and we just assume that you have to live
this way because we compare ourselves to

2044
01:36:29,151 --> 01:36:29,984
people that live in,
like indigenous tribes are in third 

2045
01:36:31,791 --> 01:36:32,624
world countries where they don't have 
constant employment and they don't have 

2046
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:37,520
high overhead.

2047
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:38,353
Right.
Rent,

2048
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:40,580
bills,
all the different things that we have,

2049
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:44,420
but we have this system set up where 
once you're in the system,

2050
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:45,733
once you start making that money,
you need that money and when the kid 

2051
01:36:48,021 --> 01:36:48,854
comes,
you can't just quit work like no one 

2052
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:51,554
does that anymore.
Like we don't think anyone should do 

2053
01:36:52,821 --> 01:36:55,280
that anymore.
We assume that woman is eventually going

2054
01:36:55,281 --> 01:36:56,114
to go back to work,
so she's going to get maternity leave 

2055
01:36:57,890 --> 01:36:58,723
because the company values are as an 
employee and then once she's done with 

2056
01:37:02,931 --> 01:37:03,764
her maternity leave,
maybe there'll be some sort of 

2057
01:37:05,181 --> 01:37:06,014
compensation or some sort of a and she 
definitely won't be working long hours 

2058
01:37:09,621 --> 01:37:10,454
or overtime anymore.
I've just got to get home and take care 

2059
01:37:11,781 --> 01:37:12,614
of a kid.
You know?

2060
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:17,720
That's the hidden thing in the whole 
argument against the financial,

2061
01:37:19,911 --> 01:37:20,744
the difference in the amount of money,
like income disparity between men and 

2062
01:37:23,181 --> 01:37:24,830
women,
but the big one,

2063
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:27,950
one of the big ones is the number of 
hours that women are willing to work.

2064
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:29,780
There's a series of choices,
right?

2065
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:30,853
There's the,
the,

2066
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:34,790
the jobs they gravitate towards.
There's the number of hours that they're

2067
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:35,624
willing to work.
There's taking time off when they have 

2068
01:37:37,611 --> 01:37:38,444
children and another one of the big ones
is this is one that works sort of 

2069
01:37:43,041 --> 01:37:43,874
against them.
That doesn't get discussed when men are 

2070
01:37:46,581 --> 01:37:49,160
trying to say that the income inequality
thing is all bullshit.

2071
01:37:49,550 --> 01:37:53,420
Women are not as good at negotiating for
a better salary.

2072
01:37:53,421 --> 01:37:56,040
They're not as aggressive in negotiating
for a better salary

2073
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:57,293
and even if they do just as good a job 
as the man that that's the one area 

2074
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:02,693
where they sort of seem to fall behind 
where it's like a rational distinction 

2075
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:10,890
that a woman is doing the same job as a 
man and not getting paid as well because

2076
01:38:10,891 --> 01:38:13,170
when you look at the income inequality 
between men and women,

2077
01:38:13,171 --> 01:38:15,540
you know it's like 77 percent cents on 
the dollar.

2078
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:16,703
It's really not real.
It's not like they're working the same 

2079
01:38:18,001 --> 01:38:20,400
job next to each other.
You were telling me it's because they've

2080
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:23,130
mental work more dangerous jobs that 
tend to pay more.

2081
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:25,320
Yeah.
More dangerous jobs tend to pay more.

2082
01:38:25,321 --> 01:38:27,090
Men are much more likely to die on the 
job.

2083
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:28,103
It's.
It's much more likely to get injured on 

2084
01:38:29,251 --> 01:38:30,084
the job.
There's a bunch of fields that men 

2085
01:38:31,801 --> 01:38:32,634
gravitates toward,
gravitate towards that are particularly 

2086
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:37,583
just interesting and attractive to men 
that women don't gravitate towards and 

2087
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:43,800
if they do,
it's in lower numbers.

2088
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:44,633
And this obviously these are gross 
generalizations because there's women 

2089
01:38:47,071 --> 01:38:48,840
who are MMA fighters,
right?

2090
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:51,120
A lot of them,
I mean I see him all the time.

2091
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:53,700
A lot of them are lesbians that a lot of
them with a few.

2092
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,970
So it's like people are,
you know,

2093
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:58,350
you can't like just pigeonhole people.
You know,

2094
01:38:58,351 --> 01:38:59,910
there's a lot of men that are florists,
right?

2095
01:39:00,230 --> 01:39:01,063
Is you can't.
It's very difficult to just like say a 

2096
01:39:03,181 --> 01:39:04,014
man is this and a woman.
Is that because this trends obviously 

2097
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:08,053
for sure trends and to deny those trends
seems to be the state of discourse 

2098
01:39:13,351 --> 01:39:15,170
today.
People like to deny those,

2099
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:20,210
those trends and any accepting of those 
trends is some sort of accepting of this

2100
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:21,953
systematic oppression of women or 
systematic oppression of gay people or 

2101
01:39:25,621 --> 01:39:29,280
it's a very weird.
In this woman who wrote that book,

2102
01:39:29,281 --> 01:39:31,050
lean in.
I think it was a lot about that.

2103
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:33,060
Like negotiate,
you know,

2104
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:34,283
it shouldn't be mandated.
You should be able to go in and fight 

2105
01:39:36,511 --> 01:39:38,640
for your salary,
get a better salary,

2106
01:39:38,641 --> 01:39:40,850
fight for the corner off,
as you know.

2107
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:41,703
Don't,
don't wait for it to be handed to you 

2108
01:39:42,721 --> 01:39:47,310
because the patriarchal system is not 
going to suddenly just make things fair,

2109
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:48,840
but it's a patriarchal system.
Real.

2110
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:52,400
Is there a patriarchal system like 
Weinstein?

2111
01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:52,920
I mean,
okay,

2112
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,500
that's a different thing because that's 
a power issue,

2113
01:39:55,501 --> 01:39:56,670
right?
And when you,

2114
01:39:56,671 --> 01:40:00,240
when you have absolute power like that 
guy had and you're also a fat,

2115
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:01,103
ugly fuck,
and you realize this is a way to get 

2116
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:06,320
gwenyth paltrow suck my dick.
You know,

2117
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:07,830
that's,
that's,

2118
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:10,260
that's a unique situation.
But also,

2119
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:14,850
but I think the dynamic of it is that 
since men do obvious,

2120
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:15,713
quantifiably have more power positions 
on boards of companies and management 

2121
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:20,843
partners,
that women are intimidated by that 

2122
01:40:23,641 --> 01:40:25,470
they're intimidated to go up against it.

2123
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:30,620
I think there's also a thing where women
don't want to be a bitch,

2124
01:40:31,290 --> 01:40:32,670
right?
They like,

2125
01:40:32,671 --> 01:40:33,504
men don't view a woman who's aggressive 
the same way they view a man as 

2126
01:40:37,321 --> 01:40:38,154
aggressive.
Like if you and I work in an office and 

2127
01:40:39,331 --> 01:40:40,164
you're like always hustling and getting 
ahead and always fighting for what's 

2128
01:40:42,331 --> 01:40:43,164
yours.
Like Greg's Greg's and aggressive 

2129
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:45,630
motherfucker.
You get shit done.

2130
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:47,880
But if a woman is doing the exact same 
thing,

2131
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:49,770
that fucking bitch,
I don't want to be around her.

2132
01:40:49,771 --> 01:40:51,310
She's such a bitch,
you know,

2133
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:54,310
like a woman who exhibits the same of 
aggressive tendencies

2134
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:55,720
is,
it's negative.

2135
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:58,120
Whereas the guy's an ass kicker.
Right,

2136
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:59,190
right.
You know,

2137
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:01,150
do you remember who was the comic up in 
Boston?

2138
01:41:01,151 --> 01:41:02,550
Who had that?
She was like,

2139
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:05,070
every comic had one great joke and this 
guy's choke was,

2140
01:41:05,071 --> 01:41:05,904
uh,
behind every successful man is a woman 

2141
01:41:08,110 --> 01:41:10,990
and behind every successful woman or two
guys calling her a lesbian.

2142
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:13,420
Fuck was that.
Remember that guy?

2143
01:41:13,421 --> 01:41:15,610
He was Kinda,
he had a wire rim glasses.

2144
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:20,611
He was a little bit Chubby.
Goddamn you remember that joke though?

2145
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,390
I do remember it now.
He just said it.

2146
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,540
I'm just trying to remember who the fuck
are really.

2147
01:41:25,490 --> 01:41:26,323
God Damn.
Who was I to give him a shout out if 

2148
01:41:27,911 --> 01:41:28,744
he's still doing it.
I always wonder about like if guys like 

2149
01:41:30,341 --> 01:41:32,920
that are still doing it,
I wonder if they do do it.

2150
01:41:32,921 --> 01:41:33,754
Look,
they just do it every now and then they 

2151
01:41:34,601 --> 01:41:35,860
have a job,
right?

2152
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:37,570
I'll give you have a regular job and 
you're like,

2153
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:40,270
go out on the weekends.
Do addict already Gig here and there.

2154
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:42,940
Pick up 300 bucks over the weekend,
shock it,

2155
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:44,580
fuck it,
and get and have a good time.

2156
01:41:44,581 --> 01:41:46,630
Have a good time.
Get some free drinks.

2157
01:41:46,631 --> 01:41:49,120
Maybe a if you're single,
maybe meet a one.

2158
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:52,870
What better way to meet women than 
getting on stage for you know,

2159
01:41:52,871 --> 01:41:53,704
if these guys do in 20 minutes or half 
hour and then get off stage and mangle 

2160
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:59,890
better than fucking what?
Going to a beef steak.

2161
01:41:59,891 --> 01:42:04,490
Charlie's standing at the bar looking at
a rusty trombone on the wall.

2162
01:42:04,491 --> 01:42:05,324
Ninety nine,
ordering some wings and a beer and 

2163
01:42:06,701 --> 01:42:09,280
looking around,
creeping people out.

2164
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:12,610
Hey,
where are you from?

2165
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:16,330
What we got?
And for a man to try to stand out,

2166
01:42:16,570 --> 01:42:18,700
it's such a grind for a guy to stand 
out.

2167
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:20,180
That's why guys peacock,
right?

2168
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:23,980
You wearing like big watches and rings 
and driving a fancy car.

2169
01:42:23,981 --> 01:42:27,200
Just trying to peacock.
Yeah.

2170
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:30,880
Let me get everybody looking at because 
we're gross.

2171
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,060
Gross women are beautiful.
You don't see statues of men,

2172
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:35,750
statues,
statues.

2173
01:42:36,030 --> 01:42:38,980
Men that don't look like us will 
different.

2174
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:41,110
And maybe a little bit,
maybe a little of that.

2175
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:44,760
Somebody had a great joke the other day.
He was like,

2176
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,860
the Greeks invented the difference 
between the Greeks and Italians.

2177
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:52,510
The Greeks invented making love.
The Italians did it to women.

2178
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,513
Well,
I was thinking when we were with a guy 

2179
01:42:58,440 --> 01:42:59,273
of course told me that joke.
We were both in Italy last summer and 

2180
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:02,493
uh,
it's like looking at the statues of the 

2181
01:43:04,181 --> 01:43:07,570
men and they're like,
they're fucking beautiful.

2182
01:43:07,571 --> 01:43:08,404
Like their abs are just perfect.
And then they have dicks and it's so 

2183
01:43:12,191 --> 01:43:17,080
weird because if you were to statue 
that's that realistic in like the Grove,

2184
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:21,880
some Christian would cloak it and they'd
carted off because it was too graphic.

2185
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:23,133
And you gotta think like when you,
when you're the sculptor and you're 

2186
01:43:25,841 --> 01:43:26,674
putting that much effort where the Deq 
has like a slightly bent shaft and you 

2187
01:43:30,341 --> 01:43:33,420
can see the crown and there's almost 
like a slit at the tip of the day.

2188
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:35,820
It's like after a couple of days you got
to look at the fit.

2189
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:37,180
They,
the sculpted like,

2190
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:38,920
okay,
we think you got it.

2191
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:42,190
Yeah.
There's a puddle of drool on carving out

2192
01:43:42,191 --> 01:43:43,024
this car.
He's got his hand on the balls fall 

2193
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:47,270
follies working on this shaft.
Well,

2194
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:48,303
here's what was interesting.
There's two different things that are 

2195
01:43:49,901 --> 01:43:51,730
interesting about dicks in those

2196
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:56,540
ancient Roman times.
One thing is that the original,

2197
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:57,433
the early days,
these two days to have just the cock 

2198
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:00,360
hanging out,
right?

2199
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:01,693
Then there came a period of time where 
they started because of some religious 

2200
01:44:05,301 --> 01:44:08,060
influence.
He started covering them with leaves and

2201
01:44:08,061 --> 01:44:10,220
that was like after the fact and they,
they,

2202
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:13,430
they actually added leaves,
says dig under there.

2203
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:14,540
Yeah,
some of them.

2204
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:16,113
And then they start.
They started doing some statues where 

2205
01:44:19,731 --> 01:44:23,360
they put the leaf over the Dick,
like as they were constructing it,

2206
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:26,750
but they did retrofit some some statutes
for Dick's,

2207
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,460
but he'll go back to that again real 
quick.

2208
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:29,960
Is pictures of Dicks.
Hilarious.

2209
01:44:29,961 --> 01:44:31,430
Here's what's interesting about these 
dicks.

2210
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:32,533
You look at these guys and these like 
big athletic looking like wrestle 

2211
01:44:35,151 --> 01:44:35,984
characters.
They all have little decks and one of 

2212
01:44:37,431 --> 01:44:41,570
the reasons why they had little dicks is
because in this time of.

2213
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,210
I mean this is my interpretation of it,
right?

2214
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:45,433
And this is what I.
I had a really good professor that took 

2215
01:44:47,901 --> 01:44:50,690
us on a tour in Rome of the Vatican.
It was,

2216
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:51,733
we got super lucky.
We hired a professor and he was 

2217
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:59,660
fantastic and he loved that.
I knew a lot about ancient history,

2218
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:03,740
particularly their use of drugs.
So like we were talking about that giant

2219
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:06,860
pine cone that's in the middle of the 
Vatican.

2220
01:45:06,861 --> 01:45:11,090
They have this outdoor area with a big 
pine cone and he goes and he goes,

2221
01:45:11,091 --> 01:45:12,260
do you know what that represents?
I go,

2222
01:45:12,261 --> 01:45:14,960
that's the pineal gland that he goes,
how do you know?

2223
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:18,590
And then we started talking and we 
started talking about like drugs and you

2224
01:45:18,591 --> 01:45:19,424
know,
endogenous production of 

2225
01:45:20,121 --> 01:45:22,210
dimethyltryptamine and shit,
like no shit.

2226
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:24,710
And he and I like fucking ignored my 
family.

2227
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:28,670
We were holding hands and wander through
the Vatican together.

2228
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:33,110
But as this guy was explaining that I 
go,

2229
01:45:33,111 --> 01:45:35,540
why are their dicks also a little?
And he goes,

2230
01:45:35,570 --> 01:45:36,403
that's a very good question.
And he said that a large dick was 

2231
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:44,360
thought to be like a gross primitive 
thing like this,

2232
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:45,433
like to have a large Dick.
You were like a non evolved thing and 

2233
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:54,820
that hit when you think about how close 
these people were to cave people,

2234
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,580
right?
Like you're thinking about a thousand,

2235
01:45:58,790 --> 01:46:00,500
2000 years ago,
right?

2236
01:46:00,770 --> 01:46:05,240
Go back 2000 years before that.
And what the fuck do you have?

2237
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:07,400
You know,
I mean you have ancient Egypt and a few,

2238
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:08,593
but you have essentially like small 
villages 2000 years before that you 

2239
01:46:12,651 --> 01:46:14,120
don't have the wheel.
Okay.

2240
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,190
So you're,
you're talking about the wheel,

2241
01:46:16,430 --> 01:46:21,170
I believe,
goes back somewhere around 5,500

2242
01:46:21,171 --> 01:46:22,004
years ago.
It's the first evidence of the wheel 

2243
01:46:23,090 --> 01:46:23,923
that is super recent.
So these people were essentially 

2244
01:46:27,441 --> 01:46:30,650
realizing that there's a better way.
Like now we have Rome,

2245
01:46:30,830 --> 01:46:33,710
we have a sophistication,
we have art,

2246
01:46:33,890 --> 01:46:34,723
we have culture,
we have music and wine and we're not 

2247
01:46:36,861 --> 01:46:37,694
going to go back to those big dick ways,
smashing heads and just fucking like 

2248
01:46:41,210 --> 01:46:42,043
wild animals.
And I think when they thought of like 

2249
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:46,820
the barbarian hordes that would come and
and you know,

2250
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:50,130
just fucking rape and pillage,
they probably those big

2251
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:50,963
fat,
juicy dicks were one of the reasons why 

2252
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:54,953
there was so horrible and so,
so base and vile and primitive and has 

2253
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:03,750
been hogs and smash and skulls and 
raping and killing.

2254
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:05,043
They were trying to move past that.
And one way that they tried to express 

2255
01:47:08,071 --> 01:47:10,650
that was in their art,
this sophisticated,

2256
01:47:10,651 --> 01:47:14,400
incredibly anatomically correct art.
And they all have these little tiny baby

2257
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:16,303
and these baby dicks were supposed to 
represent like culture and 

2258
01:47:18,301 --> 01:47:19,134
sophistication.
Sort of like how a fat woman was 

2259
01:47:21,871 --> 01:47:24,690
supposed to represent.
Like a woman who ate a lot,

2260
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:26,280
right?
As a woman of culture.

2261
01:47:26,281 --> 01:47:28,110
So they were attractive.
Like look at that guy.

2262
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:32,820
He's built like Brock Lesnar and he's 
got a dick like peewee Herman,

2263
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:33,990
like,
look at that.

2264
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:35,220
I don't know if people are hurting us a 
little bit.

2265
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:36,173
I always thought it was because over 
time the Deq must've just got knocked 

2266
01:47:39,181 --> 01:47:40,950
off and that's why they were so small.

2267
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:41,851
No,
no.

2268
01:47:41,851 --> 01:47:42,684
They purposely represented these 
gigantic muscular men as having tiny 

2269
01:47:48,931 --> 01:47:49,764
penises which showed sophistication.
So there were almost in this 

2270
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:57,150
transitionary period of like the muscles
were big.

2271
01:47:57,151 --> 01:48:00,300
The body was obviously like very primal.
You know,

2272
01:48:00,301 --> 01:48:03,780
they were there obviously very fit,
but they had these little tiny cox in.

2273
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:04,710
Wow.
What they,

2274
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:06,630
what they admired.
If that holds.

2275
01:48:06,631 --> 01:48:07,464
I wonder if that translates to the myth 
that the African American man has a big 

2276
01:48:12,631 --> 01:48:16,460
penis goes to that as well.
And a myth pal,

2277
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:21,450
you got news for you.
We have movies lacked.com

2278
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:26,000
is a website.
It's called blacked out.

2279
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:26,913
Yeah.
There's a couple porn stars that have 

2280
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:30,150
followed on twitter and they'll just 
like post,

2281
01:48:30,230 --> 01:48:32,010
like that's the weird thing about 
twitter.

2282
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:34,940
Sometimes I'll forget that I'll follow 
porn stars.

2283
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,300
I'm going through my twitter feed and 
like,

2284
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:37,134
oh,
there's a dick and an ass just out of 

2285
01:48:39,310 --> 01:48:40,143
nowhere.

2286
01:48:40,170 --> 01:48:41,003
There's a girl like taking a hot with a 
face like like twitter is one of the 

2287
01:48:45,841 --> 01:48:48,090
things that I actually love about 
twitter.

2288
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:52,650
Twitter in a lot of ways is still wild.
You know?

2289
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:55,020
I think they're trying to get ahold of 
it.

2290
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:58,710
I'm trying to get jack from twitter,
the head guy on the podcast.

2291
01:48:58,711 --> 01:49:01,650
We've been going back and forth and he's
expressed some interest about it,

2292
01:49:01,651 --> 01:49:02,484
but a little trepidation.
He's a little worried about how to 

2293
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:04,883
because they're trying to censor people,
but the people they're trying to censor 

2294
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,350
or the people that are actively 
harassing people,

2295
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:14,273
the people that are using unwanted 
sexual advances and sending unwanted 

2296
01:49:18,541 --> 01:49:22,560
naked photos and things on those lines 
to people right up ending elections.

2297
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:24,173
That's a little different.
Here's something I thought was 

2298
01:49:25,171 --> 01:49:26,310
fantastic.
Fascinating.

2299
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:27,213
I fucking.
I retweeted it and accidentally 

2300
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,310
unreached tweeted it and then I couldn't
find it.

2301
01:49:33,450 --> 01:49:36,870
She never do things on my computer when 
it's late at night and I'm barely paying

2302
01:49:36,871 --> 01:49:37,704
attention,
but someone posted something that this 

2303
01:49:41,341 --> 01:49:44,700
person that was claiming they were from 
Rhode Island,

2304
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,433
uh,
posted the tweeting about Hillary 

2305
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:48,520
Clinton.

2306
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:49,353
It was like in response to something 
that Donald Trump had done really 

2307
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:52,053
recently that was fucked up and about 
hillary and are deleted emails and they 

2308
01:49:55,631 --> 01:49:58,510
left their location on and it was 
Russia.

2309
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:00,070
Oh No,
there's tons of that.

2310
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:03,970
There's tons of,
a lot of these unknown accounts.

2311
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:08,020
It was like Kevin Underscore 2012 or 
something like that,

2312
01:50:08,350 --> 01:50:13,350
but a lot of these accounts where these 
people are attacking Hillary Clinton and

2313
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:18,790
supporting trump and he's like,
right wing talking points.

2314
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:21,880
We literally have to understand this 
isn't just,

2315
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:22,893
this isn't just a trope.
This isn't just like some weird talking 

2316
01:50:27,791 --> 01:50:28,624
point the Democrats keep using.
There are thousands and thousands of 

2317
01:50:34,481 --> 01:50:35,314
fake Internet accounts that are designed
to attack people that are supporting 

2318
01:50:42,161 --> 01:50:42,994
someone who's in opposition of their 
interests and to support someone who is 

2319
01:50:47,081 --> 01:50:50,050
on their side.
And these are these people,

2320
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:50,913
these online,
whether they're real people or whether 

2321
01:50:52,991 --> 01:50:55,600
they're bought,
they're all pro trump,

2322
01:50:55,780 --> 01:50:56,620
all of them,
and they're all

2323
01:50:56,690 --> 01:50:57,523
pro trump and a lot of them are like,
I'm stoking the racial tension because 

2324
01:51:01,970 --> 01:51:03,890
that helps.
That helped trump get elected.

2325
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:04,760
Oh,
of course.

2326
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:06,590
Of course.
And it's just,

2327
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:09,260
it's fascinating that people are denying
this.

2328
01:51:09,290 --> 01:51:10,123
You know,
that a lot of people in the right or 

2329
01:51:11,331 --> 01:51:12,530
denying this and saying,
oh,

2330
01:51:12,531 --> 01:51:15,050
the Democrats are just whining and you 
lost.

2331
01:51:15,051 --> 01:51:16,730
Get over it.
I've seen a lot of that.

2332
01:51:16,731 --> 01:51:17,564
You lost get over it.
You got to understand what's happening 

2333
01:51:20,391 --> 01:51:23,300
here.
You're not necessarily dealing with real

2334
01:51:23,301 --> 01:51:25,310
discourse.
It's not really the right.

2335
01:51:25,370 --> 01:51:28,790
And the left communicating stand each 
other's points.

2336
01:51:28,970 --> 01:51:29,900
Debating,
no.

2337
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:32,330
There's a bunch of people that don't 
have a fuck.

2338
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:36,170
They're not even here.
And they're pretending that they're here

2339
01:51:36,410 --> 01:51:37,243
and they're talking shit about the left 
and they're talking shit about Anthony 

2340
01:51:41,540 --> 01:51:42,373
Wiener or Hillary Clinton.
And they're not even necessarily real 

2341
01:51:44,511 --> 01:51:46,370
people.
They might be,

2342
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:47,293
but they might just be people that meant
it might just have scripts that they 

2343
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:52,460
send out from hundreds of different 
accounts.

2344
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:57,680
They might be looking for key words like
there's a weird information war going on

2345
01:51:57,681 --> 01:52:00,050
right now and an influence war going on 
right now,

2346
01:52:00,260 --> 01:52:02,300
and there's a lot of people that don't 
want to admit it's real.

2347
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:04,480
It's fucking a hundred percent.

2348
01:52:04,730 --> 01:52:05,740
It's 100 percent real.
I mean,

2349
01:52:05,741 --> 01:52:10,090
facebook has already gotten rid of 
thousands of accounts because they found

2350
01:52:10,091 --> 01:52:10,924
that they were Russian accounts and the 
ads that were being taken out on 

2351
01:52:13,811 --> 01:52:14,644
facebook where they track the money.
They were ads that were bought by 

2352
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:21,220
Russian.
I don't know if it was the government or

2353
01:52:21,221 --> 01:52:22,054
just the oligarchy,
but they were purchasing ads on 

2354
01:52:24,881 --> 01:52:25,960
facebook.
What is this?

2355
01:52:25,961 --> 01:52:28,750
The best twitter tool and you can buy.
Just googled real quick,

2356
01:52:28,870 --> 01:52:30,700
tell me what this is.
All this stuff you can buy.

2357
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:32,770
It's called tweet attacks.
Product

2358
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:37,110
is designed to run thousands of twitter 
accounts at the same time.

2359
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:40,200
Twenty four slash seven to auto follow.

unfavorite.
So they just do everything.

2365
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:49,900
Every account can have its own setting,
dust,

2366
01:52:49,901 --> 01:52:52,970
preventing twitter from becoming 
suspicious about the account.

2367
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:57,830
Plus the software can simulate human 
operation perfectly,

2368
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:00,920
exclamation point,
$7.

2369
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:04,420
So you buy this for $7 and you just go 
on a goddamn.

Greg fitzsimmons promoting rampage one 
day.

2371
01:53:07,171 --> 01:53:12,171
We notice at the bottom the syntax 
designed for everyone's need.

2372
01:53:12,650 --> 01:53:15,350
That's not an American writing that.
No,

2373
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:19,640
not limited by the twitter API because 
we don't use it.

2374
01:53:19,970 --> 01:53:21,080
Exclamation point.
Okay.

2375
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:22,303
We should do an experiment.
We should buy that and see how much we 

2376
01:53:27,861 --> 01:53:30,140
can jack up your twitter account.
I love it.

2377
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:31,820
Like what's your twitter account at 
right now?

2378
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:33,920
I don't know what's great.

2379
01:53:34,070 --> 01:53:39,070
Greg Fitzsimmons fits dog radio on 20 
something thousand dollars.

2380
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:41,550
Not a lot.
Just under 85,000.

2381
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:42,393
80 5,000
are wonder if we could get you up to 

2382
01:53:44,781 --> 01:53:47,810
like a quarter million and like a couple
of months at about 7 million.

2383
01:53:47,811 --> 01:53:48,644
Probably by the end of the week.
A million by the end of the week might 

2384
01:53:51,771 --> 01:53:52,604
get noticed because I think that's it.
As long as we're really open about what 

2385
01:54:01,671 --> 01:54:02,504
we're doing,
I think that will be really a 

2386
01:54:03,231 --> 01:54:05,170
fascinating experiment.
You know,

2387
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:09,070
and you do it well.
We use these things and then we,

2388
01:54:09,130 --> 01:54:12,090
we buy you a bunch of fake accounts,
right?

2389
01:54:12,710 --> 01:54:15,230
I mean not fake accounts.
Fake followers.

2390
01:54:15,290 --> 01:54:16,880
We get,
we just use it.

2391
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:19,070
You can get fake followers.
Right.

2392
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:21,650
How does that work?
Like I checked the other day how many of

2393
01:54:21,651 --> 01:54:22,484
my followers are fake.
I swear to God it was the exact same 

2394
01:54:24,081 --> 01:54:26,630
feeling I had when I took an HIV test 
and 93.

2395
01:54:26,631 --> 01:54:27,320
I was like,
whoo,

2396
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:31,140
here we go.
It's like Kinda.

2397
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:32,053
I kinda enjoy looking at the number of 
followers I have and they were all 

2398
01:54:35,421 --> 01:54:38,900
Russian bots,
not mine.

2399
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:42,920
It's almost all real,
but the number of that the president has

2400
01:54:42,921 --> 01:54:45,680
is like 50 percent,
like 50 percent fan accounts.

2401
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:46,963
I wonder if he did that.
I wonder if he hired or if they just 

2402
01:54:50,031 --> 01:54:50,864
follow him because he's the president 
and it's a good thing to have like a 

2403
01:54:53,991 --> 01:54:57,560
fake account falling the president,
especially these Russian troll accounts.

2404
01:54:58,010 --> 01:54:58,843
I think this came up.
I feel like the first time when John 

2405
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:01,513
Kerry was running against Obama and they
found out they did like a twitter auto 

2406
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:04,303
in his account and found out he had a 
recent influx of like a million 

2407
01:55:07,340 --> 01:55:09,530
followers on his account and it seemed 
like,

2408
01:55:09,830 --> 01:55:12,440
what did he do it or did someone just do
it to him?

2409
01:55:12,580 --> 01:55:13,630
Well,
I think people,

2410
01:55:13,690 --> 01:55:17,560
if I was running a campaign and I was 
already a sleazy piece of shit running a

2411
01:55:17,770 --> 01:55:20,740
presidential campaign or some sort of 
political campaign,

2412
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:23,200
you got to think they're going to use 
every tool at their disposal.

2413
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:24,980
For us,
that's what they do right?

2414
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:27,220
When they,
they muck rake and they fucking go after

2415
01:55:27,221 --> 01:55:28,054
people and pull out some shift from 
their past and make up some shit about 

2416
01:55:31,001 --> 01:55:33,130
their past and use every influence they 
have.

2417
01:55:33,131 --> 01:55:33,964
Like,
look,

2418
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:37,390
I think it's a good thing that we found 
out that donald trump's kind of god that

2419
01:55:37,391 --> 01:55:38,350
wants to talk about,
hey,

2420
01:55:38,351 --> 01:55:39,470
just grab them by the Pussy.
You know,

2421
01:55:39,690 --> 01:55:41,470
it's good that we know,
oh,

2422
01:55:41,471 --> 01:55:45,750
this is how he really talks and behaves,
but make no mistake about it.

2423
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:46,853
That came about through dirty pool day.
Dave went and searched and did their 

2424
01:55:50,971 --> 01:55:51,804
best in the.
I know people that work at access 

2425
01:55:53,401 --> 01:55:56,820
Hollywood or wherever and they tried to 
find out what do we got?

2426
01:55:56,821 --> 01:55:58,080
What do we got on and we got to get 
something.

2427
01:55:58,081 --> 01:56:00,050
What can I give you?
Give me this list.

2428
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:02,210
Going to record it and just talking 
about grabbing posters.

2429
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:03,240
Oh,
bobby,

2430
01:56:03,241 --> 01:56:05,220
if you can get me that I will get 
something for you.

2431
01:56:05,820 --> 01:56:08,190
I mean this is all like how these people
do this.

2432
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:10,440
If you don't think that they would get 
fake accounts.

2433
01:56:11,290 --> 01:56:12,123
Yeah.
Now I know a lot of comedians that have 

2434
01:56:14,141 --> 01:56:14,974
done that,
that have built up to because club 

2435
01:56:16,841 --> 01:56:18,640
owners look at that shit.
Oh yeah.

2436
01:56:18,850 --> 01:56:21,040
For sure.
Where they book you and come up with how

2437
01:56:21,041 --> 01:56:22,030
much they're going to pay you.
They,

2438
01:56:22,031 --> 01:56:24,250
they quantify you.
Yeah.

2439
01:56:24,251 --> 01:56:25,610
Like what do you think?
Uh,

2440
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:29,260
what do you think we'd have to do to get
greg up to a million?

2441
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:30,600
What do,
what do you have to do?

2442
01:56:31,930 --> 01:56:32,763
You got to talk into the microphone.
I listened to the podcast recently and 

2443
01:56:35,051 --> 01:56:38,410
sometimes you have it off you because I 
have the mic off sometimes.

2444
01:56:38,590 --> 01:56:39,520
I don't know.
I understand.

2445
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:43,330
Um,
let me see what this says.

2446
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:45,460
But I was listening to it.
I couldn't understand a word.

2447
01:56:45,461 --> 01:56:47,890
You're son will get up on the mic.
They get up on that bitch.

2448
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:52,360
I'll try to eat it.
He Siad eats that shit.

2449
01:56:52,660 --> 01:56:54,820
I don't know exactly on this particular 
one.

2450
01:56:54,821 --> 01:56:56,680
This one wants you to pay a fee per 
month.

2451
01:56:56,681 --> 01:56:57,514
There's other ones that you can pay like
a one time fee and whatever you're 

2452
01:56:59,651 --> 01:57:02,830
asking to happen will just happen over 
just happen days.

2453
01:57:02,890 --> 01:57:06,010
It doesn't happen instantly,
but I've seen a couple of youtube videos

2454
01:57:06,011 --> 01:57:06,844
doing what you're describing.
They did it to an employee of theirs 

2455
01:57:08,801 --> 01:57:09,634
without telling them like,
watch your instagram account what 

2456
01:57:12,580 --> 01:57:13,413
happened today?
And like,

2457
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:15,160
he's like,
I got 2000 new likes today.

2458
01:57:15,161 --> 01:57:15,994
I usually get 20.
That's an started felt like popular or 

2459
01:57:18,671 --> 01:57:19,504
whatever.
You know,

2460
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:21,420
the screening.
Get excited.

2461
01:57:21,830 --> 01:57:22,663
Yeah.
When do we get you up to give me a 

2462
01:57:24,851 --> 01:57:27,340
budget and I can figure it out.
Let me give you a budget.

2463
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:28,743
Okay.
What do you think how much we need to 

2464
01:57:29,621 --> 01:57:32,080
spend 100 bucks?
500 bucks.

2465
01:57:32,110 --> 01:57:33,310
500 bucks.
Could do a lot.

2466
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:34,290
There's A.

2467
01:57:34,290 --> 01:57:38,490
I know a girl who did that and she went 
from like 30,000

2468
01:57:38,491 --> 01:57:40,050
followers to a million on it.

2469
01:57:40,570 --> 01:57:41,403
Do you want to also bump up your spotify
numbers or your youtube numbers or 

2470
01:57:45,201 --> 01:57:46,850
anything like that because you can do 
that as well.

2471
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:48,200
Instagram,
the

2472
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:49,033
girl did it on instagram.
The way they found out people is not in 

2473
01:57:51,621 --> 01:57:52,454
our business and another business,
but the way they found out that she was 

2474
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:58,280
doing it was because the amount of likes
that she got was the same.

2475
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:02,120
The amount of likes or images got and 
the amount of comments.

2476
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:07,180
They remained the same but it didn't go 
on portional.

2477
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:08,113
Right.
Like if you see a like a have you put 

2478
01:58:10,611 --> 01:58:12,350
something up on like,
okay,

2479
01:58:12,590 --> 01:58:13,423
let's for instance that picture that we 
put a you when we first started this 

2480
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:16,970
podcast.
All right,

2481
01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:20,240
we did that a couple of hours ago.
Right?

2482
01:58:21,050 --> 01:58:26,050
And we'll go to it right now and it has 
17,913

2483
01:58:26,870 --> 01:58:30,380
likes and 257 comments.
That's,

2484
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:32,990
that means that's normal,
if that makes sense.

2485
01:58:33,390 --> 01:58:38,390
So like a photo of a funny comedian.
First episode on New podcast is.

2486
01:58:38,990 --> 01:58:40,160
Here you go.
There it is right there.

2487
01:58:40,161 --> 01:58:41,350
I look at you.
You said Bitch,

2488
01:58:41,650 --> 01:58:42,040
I put

2489
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:42,873
up yours.
The picture you doing the exact same 

2490
01:58:44,111 --> 01:58:46,940
pose.
Two thousand 48.

2491
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:50,790
But that all makes sense.
So now if you,

2492
01:58:51,130 --> 01:58:52,360
what's going on with you,
with the,

2493
01:58:52,361 --> 01:58:55,100
uh,
the other one with the EU and the um,

2494
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:56,583
the dentist was that photo kind?
I just got my wisdom tooth pulled out 

2495
01:58:59,381 --> 01:59:00,840
the other day.
Yeah.

2496
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:05,290
Oh Jesus.
Oh God,

2497
01:59:05,291 --> 01:59:06,011
Dude.
What happened?

2498
01:59:06,011 --> 01:59:07,950
Was it getting impacted?
Um,

2499
01:59:08,190 --> 01:59:08,831
no.
I,

2500
01:59:08,831 --> 01:59:09,664
uh,
it had a filling in it and I guess I've 

2501
01:59:12,391 --> 01:59:13,860
a cracked you will,
I,

2502
01:59:13,861 --> 01:59:15,310
you know,
I have adhd.

2503
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:19,230
So the doctor gives the last seven or 
eight years I've been on,

2504
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:23,670
I'm like Ritalin and it makes me grind 
my teeth and I,

2505
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:28,830
I ground my,
a crack into my wisdom is Christ dude.

2506
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:32,950
So he went in with some pliers and it 
took like two seconds.

2507
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:34,960
I thought it was going to be like,
you know,

2508
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:38,020
like his foot on my forehead and 
sweating and pulling it.

2509
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:41,230
He just went and popped it out through 
some gauze on it.

2510
01:59:41,231 --> 01:59:43,530
I did three shows that night.
No worries.

2511
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:44,980
No problem.
Really.

2512
01:59:45,010 --> 01:59:47,530
Some people have like a week long bad 
reacts to it.

2513
01:59:47,531 --> 01:59:50,530
I got lucky.
Nothing just pop right out now.

2514
01:59:50,540 --> 01:59:51,373
And so what do they do now?
They put a like a crown in there or 

2515
01:59:53,651 --> 01:59:56,080
something or a wisdom tooth.
So they just leave it out.

2516
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:57,140
Oh No.
Yeah.

2517
01:59:57,700 --> 01:59:58,533
So it's got like a.
But you have to keep rinsing with 

2518
02:00:01,181 --> 02:00:03,480
saltwater.
Otherwise you get a infection,

2519
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:08,520
dry hole or something they call it 
because your bone underneath is exposed.

2520
02:00:10,070 --> 02:00:12,370
Oh,
you need a blood clot to get in there.

2521
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:13,233
And if the blood clot doesn't form then 
your bone is exposed and your breath 

2522
02:00:16,431 --> 02:00:17,264
apparently becomes like a fucking 
nightmare and you get an infection and 

2523
02:00:21,491 --> 02:00:23,470
you'll get a pain all the way through 
your ear.

2524
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:26,740
And it happens to like five percent of 
people that get their wisdom teeth taken

2525
02:00:26,741 --> 02:00:27,030
out.

2526
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:27,863
Do you know the people that get mouth 
infections oftentimes get heart attacks 

2527
02:00:30,701 --> 02:00:32,050
because of him?
I've heard that.

2528
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:33,850
Yeah.
What the fuck man?

2529
02:00:34,110 --> 02:00:35,560
You would think you just have bad 
breath.

2530
02:00:35,710 --> 02:00:36,520
Yeah.
No,

2531
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:37,540
he could die,
dude.

2532
02:00:37,541 --> 02:00:40,210
What do you do when somebody you know 
well has bad brown.

2533
02:00:40,450 --> 02:00:42,420
Do you fucking done that?
Yes.

2534
02:00:42,510 --> 02:00:43,690
No.
Well me too.

2535
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:44,553
Yeah.
Tell me,

2536
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:48,610
tell you my breath stinks sometimes.
I trick a lot of coffee.

2537
02:00:48,611 --> 02:00:50,830
That's my downfall,
my mind as well.

2538
02:00:50,831 --> 02:00:52,620
You also have your brush your tongue,
man.

2539
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:56,560
You got to brush your tongue goodbye and
account that had 240,000

2540
02:00:56,561 --> 02:00:57,394
plus followers.
That's over five years old for 150 

2541
02:00:59,261 --> 02:01:00,160
bucks.
Oh,

2542
02:01:00,161 --> 02:01:03,160
but that's all a whole account taking 
over the account.

2543
02:01:03,161 --> 02:01:06,160
But when you switch the name of your 
followers wouldn't know the difference.

2544
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:08,590
Why does to count?
I was following.

2545
02:01:08,591 --> 02:01:09,424
It must have been some meme account.
I just noticed that it switched to like 

2546
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:15,310
booty pics or some shit like that.
I was like,

2547
02:01:15,311 --> 02:01:17,530
when did I start following like that?
Right.

2548
02:01:17,531 --> 02:01:19,320
But that's not,
that's not good.

2549
02:01:19,670 --> 02:01:21,010
So it won't be the same thing.
We could,

2550
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:23,140
instead of having $85,000
tomorrow,

2551
02:01:23,141 --> 02:01:25,030
he will have $250,000.
Yeah.

2552
02:01:25,031 --> 02:01:26,890
But they wouldn't be the same followers.
Right.

2553
02:01:27,390 --> 02:01:29,140
I think it makes it blends them 
together.

2554
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:31,710
Oh.
So he adds those followers.

2555
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:33,310
Weird.
What happens when that goes down?

2556
02:01:33,390 --> 02:01:36,490
So you,
he would add an additional 250,000

2557
02:01:36,491 --> 02:01:38,440
followers or 240,000
followers.

2558
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,040
I'm in,
I'm

2559
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:40,873
into that.
I'm apparently when you eat a ketogenic 

2560
02:01:46,041 --> 02:01:47,450
diet,
which I'm on,

2561
02:01:47,540 --> 02:01:52,280
it's like a low carb,
high fat diet.

2562
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:54,350
It makes your breath smell like fuck it 
shit.

2563
02:01:54,380 --> 02:01:55,310
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2564
02:01:55,311 --> 02:01:59,060
So I'm pretty cognizant of that.
I'm pretty aware I was it a lot.

2565
02:01:59,610 --> 02:02:00,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

2566
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,300
Because the meat doesn't digest just 
fat.

2567
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:03,163
It's just fat burning.
See I did your body burns fat as a fuel 

2568
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:08,700
instead of protein,
or excuse me,

2569
02:02:08,710 --> 02:02:12,140
instead of carbohydrates,
like the standard American diet,

2570
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:14,900
we eat a lot of refined carbohydrates,
breads,

2571
02:02:14,901 --> 02:02:16,160
pastas,
things along those lines.

2572
02:02:16,190 --> 02:02:21,190
And what I try to do is lean to a much 
more fat based Diet.

2573
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:25,970
A lot of coconut,
a lot of avocado meet things along those

2574
02:02:25,971 --> 02:02:28,130
lines.
I don't have very much carbs.

2575
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:31,760
My carbon takes pretty low except when I
go off the rails,

2576
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:32,893
I go off the rails like maybe once a 
week or so I'll have like pasta or 

2577
02:02:35,571 --> 02:02:38,000
something like that,
you know,

2578
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:38,863
not pizza.

2579
02:02:38,870 --> 02:02:41,120
I haven't had pizza in a while.
That's my super off the rails.

2580
02:02:41,121 --> 02:02:41,954
Food.
That's when you're in New York for a 

2581
02:02:43,131 --> 02:02:43,964
couple of days.
You eat a full pizza and then just feel 

2582
02:02:46,041 --> 02:02:49,160
like a fucking slob too.
So disco.

2583
02:02:49,190 --> 02:02:51,200
It's amazing what I'm willing to do for 
mouth.

2584
02:02:51,201 --> 02:02:53,870
Pleasure.
Just for that second.

2585
02:02:54,050 --> 02:02:54,883
Yeah.
So Trish and then you just feel like 

2586
02:02:57,351 --> 02:02:58,184
shit for hours.
Like the taste only lasts for like 20 

2587
02:03:00,591 --> 02:03:02,060
minutes,
but.

2588
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:03,193
So what?
I'm willing to sacrifice hours of 

2589
02:03:05,241 --> 02:03:07,790
health.
But what do you sacrificed for an orgasm

2590
02:03:07,791 --> 02:03:08,624
when you're single?
The amount of booze that you'll buy a 

2591
02:03:10,641 --> 02:03:13,580
girl and conversation you'll listen to 
and yeah,

2592
02:03:13,581 --> 02:03:16,340
but that doesn't have their own size.
Second Orgasm.

2593
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:17,263
The only downside is you fuck someone 
you don't really like and then you have 

2594
02:03:19,611 --> 02:03:23,000
to talk to them anymore.
It's like those brutal days,

2595
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:24,113
right?
You know what the most brutal move was 

2596
02:03:25,341 --> 02:03:26,660
ever when I was young and stupid.

2597
02:03:27,590 --> 02:03:30,680
You would go on a vacation with a girl 
that you didn't really know that.

2598
02:03:30,710 --> 02:03:31,543
Oh,
or invite her to come out with you on 

2599
02:03:33,561 --> 02:03:34,780
the road.
Like,

2600
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:37,310
Hey,
I'm working in Philadelphia this weekend

2601
02:03:37,780 --> 02:03:40,440
and Uncle Chuck Rolles fucker fest.
Fucking.

2602
02:03:42,170 --> 02:03:45,800
And you would have them come with you 
and you know,

2603
02:03:45,801 --> 02:03:49,010
an an hour after you came,
you couldn't deal with them.

2604
02:03:49,390 --> 02:03:51,470
You would just like,
I can't believe I did this.

2605
02:03:51,471 --> 02:03:53,390
Like you thought it was the perfect 
idea.

2606
02:03:53,391 --> 02:03:55,400
We'll get together.
We'll have some fun.

2607
02:03:55,401 --> 02:03:57,110
I'll take her to dinner.
We'll have.

2608
02:03:57,680 --> 02:04:01,490
She can come see my shows and back then 
man,

2609
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:02,833
like people didn't have cell phones so 
we were like on top of each other and 

2610
02:04:05,930 --> 02:04:08,790
didn't have anything to do phone.
Yeah,

2611
02:04:09,090 --> 02:04:10,520
right.
He got to.

2612
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:11,373
You Got Cable TV and you're gluing had 
cable and if you're on the road you a 

2613
02:04:16,131 --> 02:04:19,670
lot of times just staying back then 
you're staying in these terrible hotels.

2614
02:04:20,090 --> 02:04:21,530
Right.
He didn't have any money,

2615
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:22,813
so you stayed in some bullshit ass hotel
was like three channels that you could 

2616
02:04:25,491 --> 02:04:27,110
watch.
It's like one restaurant,

2617
02:04:27,111 --> 02:04:27,944
some Shitty Deli and you're.
You have nothing in common with the 

2618
02:04:30,681 --> 02:04:33,140
person.
You just had sex with zero.

2619
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:37,100
That's when you just start drinking.
That leads to the fight.

2620
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:38,363
There's a bus stop involved.
Is it fucking trailways station 

2621
02:04:41,461 --> 02:04:43,300
involved?
It's crazy.

2622
02:04:43,890 --> 02:04:46,710
You know,
thinking about like finding someone that

2623
02:04:46,711 --> 02:04:50,070
you are compatible with that you also 
want to fuck.

2624
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:51,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

2625
02:04:51,210 --> 02:04:52,890
Because those are two totally different 
things.

2626
02:04:53,070 --> 02:04:53,903
Like you could find someone that you 
have amazing conversation with but you 

2627
02:04:56,551 --> 02:05:00,990
have zero sexual attraction to them,
so you have to find a combo.

2628
02:05:01,350 --> 02:05:02,183
You have to find someone that you're 
sexually attracted to but you really 

2629
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:04,704
enjoy them as a human being.
Talking to and sometimes those are just 

2630
02:05:07,591 --> 02:05:09,230
not the same things.

2631
02:05:09,650 --> 02:05:10,483
Like especially for guys.
I guess it's must be that way for girls 

2632
02:05:12,450 --> 02:05:13,283
obviously can't speak for them,
but when you're a guy and you meet a 

2633
02:05:15,451 --> 02:05:20,451
girl like who's got a little ways and 
big tits and a big ass willing to put up

2634
02:05:20,551 --> 02:05:22,920
with a lot of nonsense,
you don't even notice.

2635
02:05:22,921 --> 02:05:27,840
You're not even putting up with it.
You're so fascinated by the looks at the

2636
02:05:27,841 --> 02:05:28,674
whatever she's saying.
It's just kind of flowing through bar 

2637
02:05:30,901 --> 02:05:32,250
together.
She's talking nonsense,

2638
02:05:32,251 --> 02:05:36,060
but then she puts her claws on your back
and just rake some down a little bit and

2639
02:05:36,061 --> 02:05:41,061
squeezes you a little later.
The promise of pleasure.

2640
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:44,410
She put her claws on a brow.
She told me,

2641
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:45,263
came to the back scratch like,
you know what's going to happen 

2642
02:05:47,191 --> 02:05:48,750
eventually,
you know,

2643
02:05:49,310 --> 02:05:49,860
and she's like,

2644
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:51,930
I need my drink.
I need my drink.

2645
02:05:51,931 --> 02:05:52,940
You have to get me my

2646
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:53,853
what?
Like what would the annoying chick 

2647
02:05:54,761 --> 02:05:57,040
drink?
I can have sex on the beach.

2648
02:05:57,080 --> 02:05:57,570
Yeah.

2649
02:05:57,570 --> 02:05:59,400
Oh my God.
I have to have a long island iced tea.

2650
02:05:59,401 --> 02:06:01,830
I need my long island ice tea.
I need it

2651
02:06:02,450 --> 02:06:05,590
that she drinks half of it or a few sips
pounds it.

2652
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:07,810
That's better.
Yeah.

2653
02:06:07,820 --> 02:06:09,030
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2654
02:06:09,031 --> 02:06:10,560
It shrinks.
A few sips and just leaves it there.

2655
02:06:10,590 --> 02:06:11,820
Yeah,
yeah,

2656
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:13,680
yeah.
I have.

2657
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:18,420
Every she ordered is a fucking lobster.
Eats one claw.

2658
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:19,493
Well,
there's some girls that don't like to 

2659
02:06:19,771 --> 02:06:21,500
eat in front of men.
They don't like.

2660
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:22,980
Dude.
First of all,

2661
02:06:22,981 --> 02:06:26,560
they don't want to be judged by you 
eating by them,

2662
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:27,413
eating in front of you.
They don't want you judging how much 

2663
02:06:29,301 --> 02:06:32,550
easy eating this disgusting.
She's going to be a big car.

2664
02:06:32,551 --> 02:06:37,551
When she gets older,
she's just fucking shoveling in a face.

2665
02:06:38,430 --> 02:06:42,360
I can't afford the upkeep or keeping up 
with this fucking food dispenser.

2666
02:06:42,630 --> 02:06:45,330
She's going to take a giant shit in my 
apartment.

2667
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:46,193
Oh my God.
What if a girl has to shit but tries to 

2668
02:06:49,081 --> 02:06:51,240
hold it in?
She doesn't want you to know.

2669
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:54,360
Uh,
I had a buddy of mine and he had a,

2670
02:06:54,361 --> 02:06:56,310
uh,
like a one bedroom,

2671
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:57,293
not even a one bedroom.
It's like a studio and the bathroom is 

2672
02:07:00,241 --> 02:07:03,390
right beside the bed was just like right
over there.

2673
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:08,730
And he was dating this girl and she's 
just sweating there and just wrecked it.

2674
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:12,210
Just wrecked his bathroom.
And she's,

2675
02:07:12,290 --> 02:07:13,123
she would do it like every time she came
over she would just go in there and 

2676
02:07:15,210 --> 02:07:20,210
records bathroom,
always complained about it and know what

2677
02:07:23,041 --> 02:07:24,360
to do.
He's like,

2678
02:07:24,361 --> 02:07:26,310
dude,
this is such a killer.

2679
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:30,840
I would show her right to the door.
The first time that happened as she came

2680
02:07:30,841 --> 02:07:33,360
out of the bathroom,
I'd take her arm gently and say,

2681
02:07:33,361 --> 02:07:34,590
it's time for you to go.
Okay.

2682
02:07:34,591 --> 02:07:36,040
But what do you do?
What do you do

2683
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:36,910
if you have to?
Shit.

2684
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:40,000
Like what is you go over a girl's house 
and she lives in a studio apartment.

2685
02:07:40,290 --> 02:07:42,820
He could take a walk.
You go to a Mcdonald's or something?

2686
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:43,900
Yeah,
I'll be right back.

2687
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:46,270
I left something in my car and you go 
shit in the bushes shit.

2688
02:07:46,271 --> 02:07:47,950
And the bushes.
San Francisco.

2689
02:07:47,951 --> 02:07:52,480
You go ride on the sidewalk and going to
shit.

2690
02:07:52,481 --> 02:07:56,740
I mean even with my wife like I,
I closed the door.

2691
02:07:56,741 --> 02:07:59,200
I hide the shit.
She doesn't care.

2692
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:03,820
Door open sits with their legs crossed.
You hear him taking a dump and it's just

2693
02:08:03,821 --> 02:08:04,654
so discouraging.
That echo from the fart before the shit 

2694
02:08:09,281 --> 02:08:10,114
comes up.

2695
02:08:12,890 --> 02:08:13,980
PLOP.
No,

2696
02:08:14,130 --> 02:08:17,080
I gotta go race a race.
Bad memory.

2697
02:08:18,860 --> 02:08:21,670
It's so weird.
We know everyone shits.

2698
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:22,533
It's like why is it so disturbing to us?
Like we have this idealized image of 

2699
02:08:26,981 --> 02:08:28,990
like some movie woman,
you know,

2700
02:08:28,991 --> 02:08:31,540
and when it doesn't turn out to be that 
way turned out to be.

2701
02:08:31,550 --> 02:08:36,070
She's an actual human who shits like 
regular people were so discouraged,

2702
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:38,560
which so sad.
Show upset.

2703
02:08:38,830 --> 02:08:41,260
It is weird.
When I see certain beautiful women,

2704
02:08:41,261 --> 02:08:43,990
I remind myself that they shit and then 
I can't.

2705
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:45,820
I can't process it.
I can't.

2706
02:08:45,821 --> 02:08:47,260
I go,
no she doesn't.

2707
02:08:47,261 --> 02:08:48,094
She can't.

2708
02:08:50,070 --> 02:08:52,990
Such as Kathleen Turner Shits.
Oh yeah.

2709
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:55,750
Giant dumpster.
Just probably never really wipes good.

2710
02:08:56,890 --> 02:08:57,723
Probably was disaster.
She just gives up halfway and starts 

2711
02:09:00,161 --> 02:09:02,770
drinking.
She does one light no matter what.

2712
02:09:02,771 --> 02:09:06,760
That's her file as they got a flask 
right there sitting on the bowl.

2713
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:11,880
So she just doesn't even look.
One wife doesn't inspect,

2714
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:14,440
just drops it.
No.

2715
02:09:14,441 --> 02:09:15,274
We got here,
one of those Japanese toilets and has a 

2716
02:09:16,811 --> 02:09:17,644
button.
You press a button and it shoots water 

2717
02:09:18,431 --> 02:09:19,720
up your ass.
Yeah.

2718
02:09:20,650 --> 02:09:21,483
Cleans you up.
Is that the one that's gonna have the 

2719
02:09:23,981 --> 02:09:25,410
flotation tank in it?
No.

2720
02:09:25,420 --> 02:09:26,740
No.
The one over here.

2721
02:09:26,830 --> 02:09:27,551
Oh,
right.

2722
02:09:27,551 --> 02:09:30,250
They're good to have those two to have 
those things here.

2723
02:09:30,510 --> 02:09:34,120
What temperature is the water though?
It's always warm.

2724
02:09:34,121 --> 02:09:35,830
Arms War.
It's nice.

2725
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:40,390
I need to go there before I leave.
I don't even have to.

2726
02:09:40,391 --> 02:09:42,190
Shit.
Just force yourself.

2727
02:09:42,210 --> 02:09:43,210
Yeah.
Well that's the thing.

2728
02:09:43,210 --> 02:09:44,650
If you shoot that water up,
your asshole,

2729
02:09:44,710 --> 02:09:46,330
you will have to shit.
Oh,

2730
02:09:46,331 --> 02:09:47,520
you do it before?
No,

2731
02:09:47,530 --> 02:09:50,320
you can if you want to.
I mean if you just want to sit there and

2732
02:09:50,321 --> 02:09:51,760
press the button,
it doesn't know whether or not you.

2733
02:09:51,761 --> 02:09:53,170
Shit.
It's not like Greg,

2734
02:09:53,410 --> 02:09:55,390
why do you want me to shoot water on 
your ass?

2735
02:09:55,960 --> 02:10:00,430
You haven't even taken a shit.
This is a logical he ever.

2736
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:03,610
Have you ever been a day?
That's so fucking dull.

2737
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:04,473
I had one yesterday where you get,
you feel a shift coming and you get 

2738
02:10:08,441 --> 02:10:10,300
excited.
Something to do.

2739
02:10:10,340 --> 02:10:13,180
It's something to do and then you shit 
and it feels good.

2740
02:10:13,181 --> 02:10:15,460
I'm not going to lie to you.
It's that might sound gay or whatever,

2741
02:10:15,820 --> 02:10:20,260
but a big hard shit come out of my ass.
It feels enjoyable,

2742
02:10:20,261 --> 02:10:21,094
like some good relief chemicals are 
released in your body or anybody denies 

2743
02:10:24,851 --> 02:10:25,810
that.
I don't want to talk to them.

2744
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:28,660
Yeah.
I don't have time enough time to talk to

2745
02:10:28,661 --> 02:10:30,850
you about that,
but if a woman tells you that,

2746
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:32,560
would you get upset if a woman's like,
oh,

2747
02:10:32,561 --> 02:10:34,190
I love taking a good fat

2748
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:35,023
shit.
This is something about taking a shit 

2749
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:40,820
feels so good.
You bombed out.

2750
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:41,773
Well,
it would mean that she's up for ass 

2751
02:10:43,041 --> 02:10:46,760
play.
Would it be sensitive anus?

2752
02:10:46,820 --> 02:10:48,110
Are you.
Absolutely.

2753
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:50,480
Are you ready to take one in the d?
The asshole.

2754
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:51,343
Not a dick,
but like a pencil or something with a 

2755
02:10:56,710 --> 02:10:59,720
coke day.
Dude,

2756
02:10:59,721 --> 02:11:02,420
I had a girl do that.
She was blowing me way,

2757
02:11:02,450 --> 02:11:04,490
way back when in Boston.
This chick,

2758
02:11:04,491 --> 02:11:08,540
she was a guido from revere and I think 
I met her with you.

2759
02:11:08,541 --> 02:11:11,250
As a matter of fact,
we were doing like a Katie.

2760
02:11:11,270 --> 02:11:13,640
Remember this?
A cable access show and revere?

2761
02:11:13,790 --> 02:11:15,650
Yes,
and it was too hot.

2762
02:11:15,651 --> 02:11:20,651
Chicks there do that with us too.
I probably Gucci.

2763
02:11:20,750 --> 02:11:21,291
Yeah,
yeah,

2764
02:11:21,291 --> 02:11:22,600
yeah.
That sounds like the line.

2765
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:26,180
But we met these two girls in the girl I
met.

2766
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:27,313
She had on,
she just had on like a college 

2767
02:11:28,221 --> 02:11:31,550
sweatshirt when I met her hair was up in
a potato chip clip and you know,

2768
02:11:31,551 --> 02:11:35,150
the leggings and the high top white 
reeboks that look.

2769
02:11:35,290 --> 02:11:36,170
Oh yeah.
Little Velcro.

2770
02:11:36,171 --> 02:11:39,650
Reebok's fell apart.
Reeboks aerobics shoes number.

2771
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:43,090
So I asked her out and then she goes,
um,

2772
02:11:43,700 --> 02:11:44,720
she goes,
okay.

2773
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:46,610
And uh,
and we drive.

2774
02:11:46,611 --> 02:11:48,860
She picks me up,
my car was broken,

2775
02:11:49,310 --> 02:11:50,143
so I go,
will you pick me up and we're going to 

2776
02:11:51,171 --> 02:11:54,080
go do a Gig in Rhode Island.
She's like,

2777
02:11:54,081 --> 02:11:57,110
all right.
So I go down to Kenmore Square,

2778
02:11:57,111 --> 02:11:58,550
she's going to pick me up a Kenmore 
Square,

2779
02:11:58,551 --> 02:12:02,510
a fucking white corvette pulls up.
This is not what I expected.

2780
02:12:03,530 --> 02:12:05,990
Hair is now done.
It's fucking up.

2781
02:12:05,991 --> 02:12:10,070
It's touching.
The top of the car nails are done.

2782
02:12:10,130 --> 02:12:11,870
She got on a hot little dress and I'm 
like,

2783
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:13,453
sweetie,
we're going to a fucking roadhouse in 

2784
02:12:15,561 --> 02:12:16,910
Narragansett,
Rhode Island.

2785
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:18,493
And I get in her car and we drive down 
and we get to the club early and we 

2786
02:12:22,881 --> 02:12:25,610
start fooling around.
And uh,

2787
02:12:25,730 --> 02:12:26,563
she sucks my dick before the show.
This like we haven't even had dinner 

2788
02:12:30,441 --> 02:12:33,230
yet.
Sucks my dick takes her finger,

2789
02:12:34,100 --> 02:12:34,933
sticks it up my ass during the blowjob.
But the fingernail is like a scrape the 

2790
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:42,193
inside of my ass and it up.
I had blood on the toilet paper when I 

2791
02:12:46,911 --> 02:12:48,560
went to the bathroom later that night.

2792
02:12:51,110 --> 02:12:53,180
What were you thinking?
Animal.

2793
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:55,070
She started putting it in.
I've,

2794
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:57,080
I opened up.
I didn't,

2795
02:12:57,440 --> 02:12:59,060
I wasn't thinking about the nail.
Did she?

2796
02:12:59,061 --> 02:13:01,380
Liquor finger first so she could score.
Drive.

2797
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:06,110
She did that porn drool thing on the 
finger,

2798
02:13:06,950 --> 02:13:11,950
just come off a big wine cobweb light.
Uh,

2799
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:14,510
and then,
uh,

2800
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:15,903
uhm,
and then we went into the club and it 

2801
02:13:17,601 --> 02:13:20,150
was like this,
it was like a roadhouse,

2802
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:24,410
just like in the middle of nowhere.
There was this just boxy kind of a room.

2803
02:13:24,411 --> 02:13:26,400
Was that a Brian deery?
Oh yeah.

2804
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:29,640
Yes.
And we go in and uh,

2805
02:13:30,260 --> 02:13:31,093
I was doing this joke,
you probably remembered as one of my 

2806
02:13:33,061 --> 02:13:37,440
standard jokes back then have like a,
they actually now,

2807
02:13:37,450 --> 02:13:39,630
I don't remember,
but it was about the sign,

2808
02:13:39,631 --> 02:13:40,464
no radio in car and people used to have 
those signs because they didn't want 

2809
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:45,930
someone breaking into the car and stay 
on the radio.

2810
02:13:46,710 --> 02:13:51,710
So I had a joke about how I had that and
that somebody then broke into my car and

2811
02:13:52,771 --> 02:13:53,604
they took the sign or Sunday took the 
radio and the sign wood or whatever it 

2812
02:13:55,981 --> 02:13:56,814
was.
And somebody yelled at it was probably 

2813
02:13:58,951 --> 02:14:02,190
a.
and he said n word and I went,

2814
02:14:02,191 --> 02:14:04,230
what?
And I said,

2815
02:14:04,231 --> 02:14:05,310
what?
Like I may,

2816
02:14:05,311 --> 02:14:08,460
I've repeated it to make them say like 
as if to shame them.

2817
02:14:08,910 --> 02:14:11,010
And then somebody else on the other side
of the crack goes.

2818
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:14,640
He said his dad was like,
all right,

2819
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:17,340
let's wrap this one up.
And uh,

2820
02:14:17,430 --> 02:14:20,690
and I,
and I see her laughing like word.

2821
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:22,790
Yeah,
she thinks she thinks it's great.

2822
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:29,240
She's sucking that finger that she had.
And she drove me back.

2823
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:36,090
She drove back to Boston and I,
at that time I was still a,

2824
02:14:36,091 --> 02:14:36,924
I was a banquet waiter in the morning,
so I used to have to wake up at like 

2825
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:40,073
4:30
in the morning and go down to the 

2826
02:14:41,311 --> 02:14:42,144
Marriott and copy place and set up 
coffee stations for these fucking 

2827
02:14:45,660 --> 02:14:46,493
conventions.
I remember this story and so I get in 

2828
02:14:49,501 --> 02:14:54,501
the car to drive home.
I fucking fall asleep in the car,

2829
02:14:54,731 --> 02:14:55,564
Inner Corvette as she drives me home and
then I get out at my house and I go to 

2830
02:15:01,081 --> 02:15:02,400
kiss her goodnight and she just looks at
me.

2831
02:15:02,410 --> 02:15:05,640
She goes,
don't ever fucking call me again.

2832
02:15:06,210 --> 02:15:08,130
Whoa.
And I just lives.

2833
02:15:08,131 --> 02:15:09,450
You fold it in the door?
Yeah.

2834
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:11,213
Whoa,
that's it.

2835
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:13,410
She's angry that she was angry,
that I fell asleep.

2836
02:15:13,530 --> 02:15:14,910
That was it.
She picked me up,

2837
02:15:14,911 --> 02:15:16,140
drove me,
blew me,

2838
02:15:16,470 --> 02:15:17,700
and then I just passed out.

2839
02:15:19,830 --> 02:15:22,590
I passed out because she blew me.
That's what I do.

2840
02:15:26,220 --> 02:15:28,590
But how funny is that?
Don't ever call me again.

2841
02:15:28,591 --> 02:15:29,424
You slept.

2842
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:37,800
That's what did it.
She washed her corvette word.

2843
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:40,860
Not the finger in the ass like that.
All those were acceptable.

2844
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:45,310
Sucking your Dick like moments after 
meeting you all those.

2845
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,193
Oh,
that's normal.

2846
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:49,310
You know the horrible food.
I'm sure they served that gigs.

2847
02:15:49,311 --> 02:15:52,500
She probably had some Mozzarella sticks.
They were hard as a rock.

2848
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:54,590
Funny is that.
That was all fine.

2849
02:15:54,640 --> 02:15:55,920
Asleep.
Pissed her off.

2850
02:15:55,940 --> 02:15:56,773
Yeah,
but people don't like that when you're 

2851
02:15:57,601 --> 02:15:59,370
driving and you don't talk to them.
Yeah.

2852
02:15:59,540 --> 02:16:01,020
You can just pass out.
Yeah.

2853
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:03,240
Wow.
That's great story.

2854
02:16:03,750 --> 02:16:06,420
I remember that.
I remember that story because I remember

2855
02:16:06,421 --> 02:16:10,170
you being like stunned that someone 
yelling out the n word.

2856
02:16:10,350 --> 02:16:13,650
How long is it going to be before you 
not allowed to say the n word,

2857
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:18,810
like just that phrase.
The phrase describing the word.

2858
02:16:18,990 --> 02:16:23,430
How long before people think that's just
as bad as saying the word itself as it's

2859
02:16:23,431 --> 02:16:24,360
coming.
Yeah.

2860
02:16:24,361 --> 02:16:25,194
Let's come and just like hoop earrings 
and braids and dreadlocks or getting 

2861
02:16:28,081 --> 02:16:29,090
people in trouble.
Yeah.

2862
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:30,633
People run out of things to get mad at 
and then we'll go after people for 

2863
02:16:33,311 --> 02:16:34,560
saying the n word.
Right.

2864
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:35,673
You shouldn't even acknowledge it.
We need to get it out of our front 

2865
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:39,460
killer.
Completely.

2866
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:41,200
Yeah.
By acknowledging it,

2867
02:16:41,890 --> 02:16:42,723
you're not helping.

2868
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:47,170
What a fucking weird time.
I only just started saying the n word.

2869
02:16:47,171 --> 02:16:50,530
I used to say the n word on my radio 
show.

2870
02:16:50,531 --> 02:16:52,960
I would just say it.
And why did you stop saying that?

2871
02:16:53,350 --> 02:16:54,183
Don't you think that by not saying it,
it becomes like this ridiculously 

2872
02:16:57,731 --> 02:17:01,420
charged magic word.
You're not a racist like wire words.

2873
02:17:01,421 --> 02:17:02,254
Magic.
Aren't words supposed to be sounds that 

2874
02:17:04,631 --> 02:17:08,740
you make that convey intent,
intent or description?

2875
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:09,881
Both.
Well,

2876
02:17:09,881 --> 02:17:10,714
that's the difference.
You can use the n word or you can say 

2877
02:17:13,181 --> 02:17:13,770
the n word,
right?

2878
02:17:13,770 --> 02:17:14,310
Well,
you're.

2879
02:17:14,310 --> 02:17:15,143
You're conveying intent.
Your intent is to describe a scenario 

2880
02:17:18,461 --> 02:17:23,461
where someone said something in a very 
particular way that showed racism.

2881
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:24,533
Yeah,
right.

2882
02:17:24,550 --> 02:17:28,420
That's your intent.
When you say the n word,

2883
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:32,790
you're saying the kid cannot be.
It cannot be altered.

2884
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:35,770
It is sacred word.
It is a magic word.

2885
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:38,050
If you say it,
candy man will come.

2886
02:17:38,700 --> 02:17:40,540
Now it's like,
it's very weird.

2887
02:17:40,750 --> 02:17:42,520
It's very weird that we've ever allowed 
that.

2888
02:17:42,730 --> 02:17:47,730
It's one thing like you could say spic.
No one's going to get mad,

2889
02:17:49,310 --> 02:17:51,920
you know,
like it's not as racially charged,

2890
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:54,260
you know?
Yeah.

2891
02:17:54,410 --> 02:17:55,670
And then,
and then there's other ones,

2892
02:17:55,671 --> 02:17:57,590
so like you can just get away with all 
day,

2893
02:17:58,130 --> 02:17:58,963
like Irish ones,
the Italian bank or Guido or they don't 

2894
02:18:02,331 --> 02:18:03,590
give a fuck.
Yeah,

2895
02:18:03,770 --> 02:18:06,170
you can call me a guido all day.
I don't give a fuck.

2896
02:18:06,171 --> 02:18:09,170
No one cares.
They get very upset about.

2897
02:18:09,940 --> 02:18:11,350
Yeah.
How about Google?

2898
02:18:12,090 --> 02:18:14,830
That's a really rough one now.
But the n word,

2899
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:15,673
you won't say it.

2900
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:16,900
Look,
look at you

2901
02:18:20,610 --> 02:18:25,610
nigger.
It's a charged word.

2902
02:18:26,990 --> 02:18:30,180
See?
But if you say someone,

2903
02:18:30,210 --> 02:18:33,900
if you're saying that you're at the club
and someone yells out,

2904
02:18:33,901 --> 02:18:37,350
it was probably in that gap,
which is probably exactly.

2905
02:18:37,351 --> 02:18:40,410
They said that that's not,
you're not racist.

2906
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:44,040
Not being racist,
but by saying he yells out,

2907
02:18:44,041 --> 02:18:44,874
it was probably an n word.
Like you're putting all this weight on 

2908
02:18:47,791 --> 02:18:48,760
that word.
Right?

2909
02:18:48,870 --> 02:18:49,710
Right,
right.

2910
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:53,490
And you're not using it in any way,
shape or form.

2911
02:18:53,491 --> 02:18:57,540
You personally are not using it to 
promote racism.

2912
02:18:57,600 --> 02:18:58,433
You're doing the opposite.
You're talking about what apes you're 

2913
02:19:01,711 --> 02:19:06,330
doing standup for a.
This girl was laughing at those apes.

2914
02:19:07,670 --> 02:19:12,670
And also the crazy thing is that some 
people can get Latino.

2915
02:19:15,520 --> 02:19:17,930
They can say,
they can still say it even like a,

2916
02:19:17,990 --> 02:19:20,690
you see Middle Eastern kids that grow up
in the hood.

2917
02:19:20,870 --> 02:19:21,703
They say it.

2918
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:23,153
Yeah.
As long as you seem to be in some sort 

2919
02:19:25,531 --> 02:19:27,680
of a marginalized group.
Yeah.

2920
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:30,140
I've seen a lot of Chinese people use 
it.

2921
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:31,900
Yeah.
Yes.

2922
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:33,050
Yeah.
It's interesting.

2923
02:19:33,051 --> 02:19:35,440
And then like into.
Yep.

2924
02:19:35,750 --> 02:19:37,540
People are really into hip hop.
Yeah.

2925
02:19:38,060 --> 02:19:38,893
You know,
they'll use it and they use with the a 

2926
02:19:41,451 --> 02:19:42,284
on the end of it,
but black people just throw it around 

2927
02:19:44,961 --> 02:19:46,040
like a beach ball to concert.

2928
02:19:46,230 --> 02:19:47,063
Well,
my son likes rap and I go and he sings 

2929
02:19:48,901 --> 02:19:49,734
it and I go,
what do you do when you hit the end 

2930
02:19:50,811 --> 02:19:54,860
where he goes,
I just say player friends,

2931
02:19:55,050 --> 02:19:56,100
they say,
player,

2932
02:19:57,280 --> 02:20:02,280
what do you think Tom Hanks' son says?
He says it be losing power.

2933
02:20:04,360 --> 02:20:06,240
Oh,
it's getting dark and that's back.

2934
02:20:06,790 --> 02:20:07,623
That's so strange.
What a stupid thing to have said that 

2935
02:20:10,020 --> 02:20:13,060
like four times yesterday.
Did they set that up on purpose?

2936
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:16,450
Now we need to switch that out.
I get to say for the first show,

2937
02:20:16,810 --> 02:20:18,280
it's gone very smoothly.
Oh yeah.

2938
02:20:18,281 --> 02:20:19,114
I mean,
we have a few hiccups that we need to 

2939
02:20:19,931 --> 02:20:20,764
deal with.
I thought that echo was going to be an 

2940
02:20:22,061 --> 02:20:22,894
issue,
but it seems like it's just those 

2941
02:20:23,411 --> 02:20:24,640
microphones.
That was the echo,

2942
02:20:24,670 --> 02:20:25,630
right?
It is right.

2943
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:27,220
Because it doesn't sound any different 
than me.

2944
02:20:28,480 --> 02:20:30,480
I like the purple behind you.
It's fetching.

2945
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:32,560
It's really for your skin tone.
Let me say.

2946
02:20:32,561 --> 02:20:33,640
Put me up on like,
oh yeah.

2947
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:35,200
I like,
it's a nice change,

2948
02:20:35,230 --> 02:20:36,420
you know,
and the real,

2949
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:38,290
the only reason in all,
honestly,

2950
02:20:38,291 --> 02:20:40,180
we want the purples because the guy was 
doing it,

2951
02:20:40,181 --> 02:20:41,140
said,
uh,

2952
02:20:41,160 --> 02:20:44,780
I couldn't find red the first time,
so I'm going to look at his new places.

2953
02:20:44,780 --> 02:20:44,981
Like,
well,

2954
02:20:44,981 --> 02:20:46,780
what do you got?
And he said,

2955
02:20:46,930 --> 02:20:47,790
well,
there's a lot of the girls.

2956
02:20:47,791 --> 02:20:48,730
I go,
you've got purple.

2957
02:20:49,270 --> 02:20:49,721
And he goes,
oh,

2958
02:20:49,721 --> 02:20:50,770
we can get purple.
I'm like,

2959
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:52,450
let's go with purple.
Fuck it.

2960
02:20:52,540 --> 02:20:57,540
Purple is the ancient.
A color of royalty isn't he had Jesus.

2961
02:20:58,601 --> 02:20:59,434
There was a lot of.
It was always a symbol of Jesus purple 

2962
02:21:01,811 --> 02:21:03,210
because it meant,
it meant,

2963
02:21:03,211 --> 02:21:04,001
uh,
you know,

2964
02:21:04,001 --> 02:21:05,710
the royals.
I didn't know that.

2965
02:21:05,770 --> 02:21:08,260
Yeah,
it's a beautiful color.

2966
02:21:08,350 --> 02:21:09,500
It is.
Flowers,

2967
02:21:09,940 --> 02:21:11,110
tulips and shit.
There we go.

2968
02:21:11,500 --> 02:21:12,333
Royalty in Europe.
Since the time that the Roman emperors 

2969
02:21:14,381 --> 02:21:19,190
wore a tie.
Tyrian tyrian Purple Poopoo A.

2970
02:21:20,230 --> 02:21:22,690
hmm.
Toga pray.

2971
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:27,780
Well,
P r a e t e x t a.

2972
02:21:28,180 --> 02:21:29,270
How do you say that?
Pray.

2973
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:30,113
Texta protect stuff.
Purple has been the color most 

2974
02:21:33,221 --> 02:21:36,850
associated with the British royal family
and other European royalty.

2975
02:21:36,851 --> 02:21:40,750
Still use it as a ceremonial color on 
special occasions.

2976
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:42,513
What does that plant said?
Some purple cabbage or some shit to 

2977
02:21:44,820 --> 02:21:46,060
cauliflower.
Cauliflower.

2978
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:48,311
Pretty.
Pretty.

2979
02:21:48,311 --> 02:21:51,730
Pretty color purple.
I was associated with prince.

2980
02:21:52,450 --> 02:21:54,280
That's her right?
There you go.

2981
02:21:54,340 --> 02:21:57,010
That was the one of the biggest bummers 
for me of,

2982
02:21:57,070 --> 02:21:59,350
uh,
of like celebrity deaths.

2983
02:21:59,390 --> 02:22:01,060
Prince was one of the all time biggest.

2984
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:02,453
That's amazing.
I was talking to because when Tom Petty 

2985
02:22:04,711 --> 02:22:06,770
died,
that one really goes a hard one too.

2986
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:11,810
That was a hard one because he was such 
the fucking soundtrack of our teen years

2987
02:22:13,050 --> 02:22:13,883
and older years.
I mean free fallen when I was in my 

2988
02:22:15,961 --> 02:22:20,961
thirties and like his songs continue.
But somehow prince who didn't have,

2989
02:22:21,030 --> 02:22:25,200
you could name more than three prince 
songs and yet I could.

2990
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:26,250
Most people can't.

2991
02:22:26,370 --> 02:22:27,790
Yeah.
I was a dude.

2992
02:22:28,350 --> 02:22:32,010
Yeah.
Prince played a big part in my late teen

2993
02:22:32,011 --> 02:22:33,030
life.
Wow.

2994
02:22:33,090 --> 02:22:35,120
Yeah.
I was always a huge purple rain,

2995
02:22:35,121 --> 02:22:37,080
tight controversy.
Even before that,

2996
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:38,333
I was a fan of prince from his first 
cassette when it was just him with no 

2997
02:22:43,501 --> 02:22:44,334
shirt on,
a on the cover looking very androgynous 

2998
02:22:47,311 --> 02:22:50,010
like there was no one like him before.
I remember seeing that,

2999
02:22:50,060 --> 02:22:53,790
that cover somewhere and going,
what the fuck is this?

3000
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:57,180
Like what is this guy?
And then I heard some of the songs.

3001
02:22:57,181 --> 02:23:00,090
I don't even remember what the big hits 
were off of the first one.

3002
02:23:00,091 --> 02:23:03,030
This is pre purple rain though,
but I remember controversy.

3003
02:23:03,250 --> 02:23:05,590
Dan,
Dan,

3004
02:23:05,880 --> 02:23:06,920
Dan,
Dan,

3005
02:23:06,950 --> 02:23:07,783
no controversy.
You remember that song now do I believe 

3006
02:23:12,991 --> 02:23:13,824
in God to believe in me.
Some people want so they can be free 

3007
02:23:21,820 --> 02:23:23,960
controversy,
but I've done it.

3008
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:27,090
That's it.
That's the cover.

3009
02:23:28,620 --> 02:23:29,453
Look at them.
Just a little tiny patch of hair in the 

3010
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:31,680
middle of his chest now,
but.

3011
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:36,680
But my point being for not knowing a big
catalog of his music,

3012
02:23:37,170 --> 02:23:38,730
it did mean a lot to me.
He was.

3013
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:41,130
What was that released in the seventies?
Really?

3014
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:43,590
What does it say?
Seventy nine.

3015
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:47,130
Wow.
Released in 1979.

3016
02:23:47,131 --> 02:23:48,600
October 19th.
Wow.

3017
02:23:48,601 --> 02:23:53,420
Real close to today.
Real close to today in 79.

3018
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:55,290
Almost 40 years ago.
Wow.

3019
02:23:55,350 --> 02:23:56,220
That's crazy.

3020
02:23:58,400 --> 02:23:59,233
That's crazy.

3021
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:04,450
Bit more of an impact on you than Bowie.
Yeah,

3022
02:24:04,480 --> 02:24:05,510
for me.
Yeah.

3023
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:07,000
I mean,
I was a big Bowie fan too,

3024
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:08,553
but the thing about prince that was a 
harder than Bowie for me was that Bowie 

3025
02:24:13,331 --> 02:24:15,460
died of a disease,
right?

3026
02:24:15,550 --> 02:24:16,480
Yeah.
Disney.

3027
02:24:17,260 --> 02:24:18,510
Yeah.
He had a.

3028
02:24:18,980 --> 02:24:21,400
was a cancer.
I think you have some type of cancer.

3029
02:24:21,700 --> 02:24:23,540
Prince died from painkillers.
Yeah.

3030
02:24:23,710 --> 02:24:26,920
That's what drove me nuts.
It's like that goddamn fentanyl.

3031
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:32,100
They found fentanyl in his body and I 
remember thinking at the time like,

3032
02:24:32,651 --> 02:24:37,150
God damn it,
I can't believe these fucking pills.

3033
02:24:37,151 --> 02:24:40,600
Gun prince like potatoes.
That was the Michael Jackson drug to,

3034
02:24:40,601 --> 02:24:41,500
right?
No,

3035
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:41,921
no,
no,

3036
02:24:41,921 --> 02:24:43,780
no.
Michael Jackson died.

3037
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:46,330
Yeah,
he died from anesthesia.

3038
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:49,510
He was so fucked up.
That was before he died.

3039
02:24:50,350 --> 02:24:53,320
He couldn't sleep,
so he would get a nest of ties.

3040
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:54,753
Just stop and think about how many 
demons you have to have where Ambien 

3041
02:24:58,301 --> 02:25:03,301
doesn't work anymore.
The amazing thing is he would get up out

3042
02:25:04,110 --> 02:25:06,300
of that and they said he was first guy 
on the set,

3043
02:25:06,750 --> 02:25:10,230
choreograph in his own shit.
Rehearsing harder than anybody.

3044
02:25:10,450 --> 02:25:12,030
Well,
I wonder when he started doing that,

3045
02:25:12,300 --> 02:25:14,700
because you know his last tour,
he was like that.

3046
02:25:14,701 --> 02:25:19,470
He was preparing for his final tour and 
he was working his fucking balls off.

3047
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:22,980
Yeah,
you can do that very long apparently.

3048
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:23,980
Apparently that's part

3049
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:28,420
of the problem was that stuff.
It limits your rem sleep,

3050
02:25:29,530 --> 02:25:30,670
which is,
by the way,

3051
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:32,793
one of the biggest things that's been 
happening to me since I'm not smoking 

3052
02:25:36,401 --> 02:25:38,980
pot for all these days,
all these many,

3053
02:25:38,981 --> 02:25:42,040
many moons,
16 days that we said 17 days.

3054
02:25:43,630 --> 02:25:47,650
The dreams are way different.
Way Different.

3055
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:52,510
Like intense dreams.
Like I have weird dreams man.

3056
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:56,830
Like they're very vivid and I never 
thought about that before.

3057
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,410
Are they the same?
Same dreams over and over again?

3058
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:00,640
No,
not at all,

3059
02:26:01,060 --> 02:26:01,893
but they're very vivid,
like way more vivid than when I was 

3060
02:26:04,331 --> 02:26:05,164
smoking pot or like way more.
Because you think you're in a deeper 

3061
02:26:08,291 --> 02:26:12,340
rems cycle.
I've heard things,

3062
02:26:12,341 --> 02:26:13,480
but I don't know what it is.
Jamie.

3063
02:26:13,481 --> 02:26:14,470
Pull.
Pull up that.

3064
02:26:14,471 --> 02:26:18,310
See if you can find out what it is.
What's the cause for it?

3065
02:26:18,311 --> 02:26:20,340
I thought it had to do with the Alpha 
waves.

3066
02:26:20,340 --> 02:26:24,250
State that marijuana.
Does that make sense?

3067
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:26,913
Because you can't.
Your body is not at rest or your brain 

3068
02:26:28,211 --> 02:26:30,100
isn't restful.
It's to an Alpha Beta waves.

3069
02:26:30,101 --> 02:26:33,010
I think for rest.
I don't know what what it is,

3070
02:26:33,011 --> 02:26:35,560
but whatever the fuck it is.
When you don't smoke pot,

3071
02:26:35,561 --> 02:26:38,200
when you smoke pot all the time for 
years and then you don't smoke pot,

3072
02:26:38,201 --> 02:26:41,190
you have some fucking dreams baby.
Whoa.

3073
02:26:41,570 --> 02:26:45,100
Like they're intense.
Sometimes I wake up to pee and I go,

3074
02:26:45,101 --> 02:26:48,640
what the fuck is going on in my head?
Like weird,

3075
02:26:48,641 --> 02:26:49,474
crazy dreams.
Like being in a plane where it comes 

3076
02:26:53,021 --> 02:26:53,854
really close to hitting a mountain and 
the next thing you know you're hanging 

3077
02:26:55,961 --> 02:26:56,794
on the ledge of a building and the next 
thing you know you're running through 

3078
02:26:58,301 --> 02:26:59,134
the woods and next thing you know you,
you know it's fucking freezing cold and 

3079
02:27:03,221 --> 02:27:05,490
you're trying to stay warm and you got a
fire going.

3080
02:27:06,450 --> 02:27:08,970
Kind of fucking Wacky,
primal dreams.

3081
02:27:08,990 --> 02:27:10,660
My going through here.
That's awesome.

3082
02:27:11,230 --> 02:27:15,490
It's very weird because I'm waking up 
and I'm just like,

3083
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:17,140
it's not going to wake up and I'm 
scared.

3084
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:19,960
I wake up going,
what the fuck am I doing?

3085
02:27:21,730 --> 02:27:24,910
Studies on cannabis and sleep were 
conducted in 19 seventies.

3086
02:27:25,690 --> 02:27:28,990
Some information about the possible 
effects of cannabis and sleep.

3087
02:27:29,170 --> 02:27:32,260
Low dose of Thc,
four to 20 milligrams.

3088
02:27:32,290 --> 02:27:36,070
Mildly decreased rem sleep in both 
regular users and non users.

3089
02:27:36,100 --> 02:27:36,933
Interestingly,
deep sleep was increased when cannabis 

3090
02:27:39,911 --> 02:27:40,744
was initially used,
but this effect disappeared after 

3091
02:27:43,031 --> 02:27:48,031
repeated use with high doses of thc.
Fifty to 210 milligrams.

3092
02:27:48,700 --> 02:27:50,310
Now stop.
And think about Lisa.

3093
02:27:50,311 --> 02:27:54,880
I'd eaten $500 and that's edible,
which is way different.

3094
02:27:55,390 --> 02:27:58,900
Rem Sleep was decreased in both regular 
users and non users.

3095
02:27:58,901 --> 02:27:59,734
Total sleep time was not affected,
but deep sleep was decreased when thc 

3096
02:28:03,431 --> 02:28:07,630
was stopped,
some rebound in rem sleep was found with

3097
02:28:07,631 --> 02:28:11,410
reduced sleep time and increased time to
fall asleep.

3098
02:28:11,950 --> 02:28:12,783
Now this is interesting because what I 
want to know who that some people do 

3099
02:28:16,061 --> 02:28:16,894
have withdrawal symptoms when stopping 
prolonged and heavy use of cannabis and 

3100
02:28:19,961 --> 02:28:24,770
this can adversely affects sleep.
I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms.

3101
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:26,030
Zero.
None.

3102
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:30,380
Not One.
But what's interesting to me is I wonder

3103
02:28:30,381 --> 02:28:31,214
if there's any benefit to not have to 
having those dreams rather versus not 

3104
02:28:35,841 --> 02:28:36,674
having those dreams.
Like I wonder if in some way I'm doing 

3105
02:28:38,661 --> 02:28:41,960
myself a disservice by smoking pot all 
the time.

3106
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:44,930
I wonder if there's like a,
you know,

3107
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:47,900
is there like a point of diminishing 
returns about [inaudible]?

3108
02:28:47,940 --> 02:28:49,610
Like there's a lot of benefits for 
cannabis,

3109
02:28:49,611 --> 02:28:50,444
right?
There's a lot of benefits in terms of 

3110
02:28:51,141 --> 02:28:51,974
the antiinflammatory effects.
There is neuroprotective effects of 

3111
02:28:54,921 --> 02:28:55,754
cannabis that they found that regular 
users like they think it might actually 

3112
02:28:58,791 --> 02:29:01,190
like hold off Alzheimer's and some 
people.

3113
02:29:01,940 --> 02:29:02,940
But I wonder,
you know,

3114
02:29:03,010 --> 02:29:05,150
what's the,
what's the balance?

3115
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:08,360
Because I'm really,
I've never really considered that it was

3116
02:29:08,361 --> 02:29:09,194
an issue at all.
I always felt like there was zero 

3117
02:29:11,211 --> 02:29:12,044
health,
like negative health effects of using 

3118
02:29:14,481 --> 02:29:15,440
it.
For me personally,

3119
02:29:15,770 --> 02:29:18,890
I'm like,
I get my blood work done regularly.

3120
02:29:19,270 --> 02:29:21,410
I'm healthy,
I eat really well.

3121
02:29:21,411 --> 02:29:24,980
I take a lot of vitamins,
I exercise regularly and I like pot so I

3122
02:29:24,981 --> 02:29:26,900
smoked pot and obviously it's not 
hurting me.

3123
02:29:27,110 --> 02:29:27,943
It's not like people drink all the time 
and fuck up their liver and their body 

3124
02:29:30,111 --> 02:29:31,970
and.
But now I'm wondering,

3125
02:29:32,050 --> 02:29:34,160
does it affect your memory?
A great memory.

3126
02:29:34,490 --> 02:29:35,930
It's pretty good.
Maybe it'd be better.

3127
02:29:36,860 --> 02:29:39,380
Maybe you know,
essentially what do,

3128
02:29:39,450 --> 02:29:40,283
what do you have here at Jimmy?
The longer article about alcohol and 

3129
02:29:42,861 --> 02:29:45,410
marijuana effects on sleep,
but this is the marijuana part.

3130
02:29:45,500 --> 02:29:45,951
Oh,
okay.

3131
02:29:45,951 --> 02:29:47,150
What does it say?
Furthermore?

3132
02:29:47,151 --> 02:29:47,984
Can increase slow wave nrem deep sleep,
which is good because that's where 

3133
02:29:52,701 --> 02:29:55,610
experts believe most of your actual 
recuperation takes place.

3134
02:29:55,610 --> 02:29:56,443
However,
as you continue to consume your slow 

3135
02:29:59,361 --> 02:30:00,194
wave sleep will get severely reduced.
Reducing the restfulness of your sleep 

3136
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:05,233
is supposed to provide.
Reducing rather the restfulness you're 

3137
02:30:07,701 --> 02:30:09,950
asleep is supposed to provide.
Hmm.

3138
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:12,020
So,
but here's the thing,

3139
02:30:12,021 --> 02:30:12,854
like what if I get high during the day?
Like why is it affecting my sleep at 

3140
02:30:15,741 --> 02:30:17,810
night?
That's what's confusing because it's not

3141
02:30:17,811 --> 02:30:18,644
like I get high a lot at night.
Sometimes me and the missus we'll smoke 

3142
02:30:22,321 --> 02:30:24,050
a little before it gave her something 
like that.

3143
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:25,270
Nice.
Yeah,

3144
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:26,180
sure.
Feels better.

3145
02:30:26,181 --> 02:30:28,810
That one punch her.
You smoked that stuff.

3146
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:30,410
Fuck.
Ugh.

3147
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:31,400
Wow.
That's a hard.

3148
02:30:32,870 --> 02:30:34,850
That's why I'm scared of Chris.
He thinks he's too old.

3149
02:30:35,330 --> 02:30:36,163
She can't take it anymore.
I told you to duck Christy and I want 

3150
02:30:40,251 --> 02:30:42,530
him to bleed like your butthole did that
day.

3151
02:30:43,990 --> 02:30:47,870
A couple days.
You know you have sex with someone.

3152
02:30:47,910 --> 02:30:49,970
They start breaking.
That's not good.

3153
02:30:50,690 --> 02:30:54,470
But I'm wondering,
I'm wondering like I need to know.

3154
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:55,473
I want to find out like what's the deal?
I'm going to start looking into this 

3155
02:30:58,911 --> 02:31:01,940
now.
Now is that different than a.

3156
02:31:02,180 --> 02:31:05,210
That stuff that.
A CBDS?

3157
02:31:05,211 --> 02:31:06,080
Yeah.
Very different.

3158
02:31:06,230 --> 02:31:07,160
Yeah.
Very different.

3159
02:31:08,460 --> 02:31:11,540
Psyche psychoactivity disagree.
No,

3160
02:31:11,550 --> 02:31:12,920
you're.
I know what you're talking about.

3161
02:31:12,921 --> 02:31:14,600
You're talking about that Charlotte's 
web.

3162
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:17,450
Yes.
See she gets me high.

3163
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:19,200
Yeah.
See it doesn't get me high,

3164
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:20,093
but

3165
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:24,180
I'm not.
I'm not sure if we have the same.

3166
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:26,760
Obviously we have the same.
Don't have the same body,

3167
02:31:26,820 --> 02:31:28,090
you know,
what affects you,

3168
02:31:28,380 --> 02:31:31,170
you know,
food wise and everybody's different when

3169
02:31:31,171 --> 02:31:35,370
it comes to that stuff.
But Charlotte's web has a bunch of other

3170
02:31:35,820 --> 02:31:36,653
cannabinoids.
It's not just cbd and that's one of the 

3171
02:31:38,851 --> 02:31:41,430
more beneficial aspects of it is that 
stuff.

3172
02:31:41,490 --> 02:31:46,490
It uses the full plant so maybe cbd 
wouldn't get you high,

3173
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:52,440
but maybe that kind of hemp oil or more 
comprehensive cannabis oil would get you

3174
02:31:52,441 --> 02:31:53,760
high.
That's interesting.

3175
02:31:53,761 --> 02:31:55,350
They get you high.
Like how high?

3176
02:31:55,980 --> 02:31:56,813
Nice high.
Just like mellow more like takes the 

3177
02:31:58,771 --> 02:32:03,000
anxiety out and makes me just really,
really nice.

3178
02:32:03,001 --> 02:32:04,710
At the end of the day,
around 5:00

3179
02:32:04,711 --> 02:32:05,544
when you're reentering the family,
maybe you have maybe some of that 

3180
02:32:10,381 --> 02:32:11,214
anxiety is coming from inflammation and 
maybe what it's doing is reducing 

3181
02:32:14,341 --> 02:32:15,770
inflammation and relaxing.

3182
02:32:16,050 --> 02:32:18,180
Yeah,
that's what I would guess.

3183
02:32:18,300 --> 02:32:19,133
Yeah.
Because it doesn't make people test 

3184
02:32:20,581 --> 02:32:21,414
positive for thc.
So like if you had a company and you're 

3185
02:32:24,211 --> 02:32:26,220
working for them,
I don't want to get anybody fired,

3186
02:32:26,430 --> 02:32:27,263
but I'm pretty sure they've tested this 
stuff and if you had a company and 

3187
02:32:31,141 --> 02:32:31,974
you're working for them and you know,
they piss test you and if you're taking 

3188
02:32:35,060 --> 02:32:37,350
like Charlotte's web oil,
I don't think it doesn't even do.

3189
02:32:37,590 --> 02:32:38,950
I don't think it shows up.
Right.

3190
02:32:39,150 --> 02:32:42,660
How fucked up is that man having a job 
that tests your pis?

3191
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:44,033
Hey Greg,
what are you having fun over the 

3192
02:32:45,570 --> 02:32:45,930
weekend?
Yeah,

3193
02:32:45,930 --> 02:32:47,570
you fucking loser.
Yeah.

3194
02:32:47,940 --> 02:32:50,790
It does the same job to tell.
You can't date anybody from work.

3195
02:32:50,791 --> 02:32:51,570
It's like,
all right,

3196
02:32:51,570 --> 02:32:52,403
so you got me working 12 hours a day.
I don't see anybody else in my life and 

3197
02:32:56,251 --> 02:32:58,590
I can't date the women that I'm,
you know.

3198
02:32:58,660 --> 02:33:00,450
Yeah.
But that's complications,

3199
02:33:00,451 --> 02:33:02,730
man.
I know that they should make it illegal.

3200
02:33:03,090 --> 02:33:03,630
Fake,
true.

3201
02:33:03,630 --> 02:33:07,260
They can suggest.
It felt weird to tell people what to do.

3202
02:33:07,290 --> 02:33:08,123
They do.
They fucking tell a manager he can't 

3203
02:33:10,290 --> 02:33:11,123
sleep with an employee.
Well that's because they're worried 

3204
02:33:12,121 --> 02:33:13,850
about some harvey wants to.
Oh yeah.

3205
02:33:14,040 --> 02:33:15,210
Right.
That makes sense.

3206
02:33:15,260 --> 02:33:17,520
Because that's always the thing,
the boss fucking the secretary.

3207
02:33:17,521 --> 02:33:18,630
Right.
You know,

3208
02:33:19,290 --> 02:33:20,940
I know a guy,
a real recently,

3209
02:33:20,941 --> 02:33:23,340
a guy that works for this big ass 
corporation.

3210
02:33:23,341 --> 02:33:25,350
They got busted.
Yes.

3211
02:33:25,351 --> 02:33:28,020
And then at home to the secretary,
Baby.

3212
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:30,660
Oh Shit.
That office day in,

3213
02:33:30,661 --> 02:33:32,490
day out,
looking at each other,

3214
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:33,353
giving each other a nod.
He done and then one day in the 

3215
02:33:39,721 --> 02:33:41,190
workplace.
So they went to a hotel.

3216
02:33:41,220 --> 02:33:43,020
I don't know.
I don't know the specifics,

3217
02:33:43,021 --> 02:33:45,780
but he's in trouble.
You know him personally.

3218
02:33:45,810 --> 02:33:49,410
I know I can't talk.
I'll tell you later when you tell me the

3219
02:33:49,411 --> 02:33:51,330
story about the guy who gave babies to 
Michael J.

3220
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:53,370
Oh,
I know you're talking about.

3221
02:33:54,090 --> 02:33:56,450
Oh,
that's right.

3222
02:33:57,390 --> 02:34:00,180
Even worse,
your story involves kids dying.

3223
02:34:00,510 --> 02:34:02,370
That got sent to Michael Jackson isn't.
It?

3224
02:34:02,730 --> 02:34:04,770
Isn't not what it is.
It's entirely possible.

3225
02:34:04,771 --> 02:34:06,840
Yes.
Now I know what you're referring to.

3226
02:34:06,900 --> 02:34:07,920
Yeah.
Oh,

3227
02:34:07,950 --> 02:34:09,660
I got other things to tell you about 
that guy.

3228
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:11,093
That guy.

3229
02:34:13,980 --> 02:34:17,300
We can't tell you folks because.
Well,

3230
02:34:17,480 --> 02:34:20,560
you don't want to get sued.
Yeah.

3231
02:34:20,960 --> 02:34:22,390
You just can't talk about certain 
things.

3232
02:34:22,510 --> 02:34:24,370
But who knows what was actually going 
on.

3233
02:34:24,970 --> 02:34:25,803
You Know My,
I've always had the weirdest theory 

3234
02:34:26,891 --> 02:34:29,560
about Michael Jackson,
that he was castrated.

3235
02:34:29,590 --> 02:34:32,560
He's a castrol.
I would buy that.

3236
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:34,000
The voice,
the voice,

3237
02:34:34,001 --> 02:34:38,830
the body extremely thin.
It didn't look like any muscle at all,

3238
02:34:39,460 --> 02:34:40,293
which is like what someone has been 
castrated would look like no 

3239
02:34:42,490 --> 02:34:45,820
testosterone at all.
Couldn't sleep super high pitched voice,

3240
02:34:46,060 --> 02:34:48,100
kept down high,
pitched voice deep into his fifties.

3241
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:49,931
Yeah,
I mean,

3242
02:34:49,931 --> 02:34:50,764
I don't think the sleep thing,
I think just riddled with anxiety and 

3243
02:34:53,081 --> 02:34:55,660
craziness and all the fucking plastic 
surgery.

3244
02:34:56,050 --> 02:35:00,160
I mean he was an literally an exercise 
in madness.

3245
02:35:00,460 --> 02:35:04,060
That was a person who went mad from 
people paying attention to them.

3246
02:35:04,120 --> 02:35:06,260
Yeah.
With unlimited resources.

3247
02:35:06,261 --> 02:35:08,950
Yeah.
That applicant jacked.

3248
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:12,520
Mm.
That doesn't look as Jack does.

3249
02:35:12,521 --> 02:35:15,520
A girl goes across with,
you know what's amazing though about him

3250
02:35:15,521 --> 02:35:18,130
is for a scrawny,
a feminine guy.

3251
02:35:18,460 --> 02:35:23,200
He acted like a bad ass in his videos.
Do you know what I mean?

3252
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:27,730
He actually played the part of a guy who
is like,

3253
02:35:28,090 --> 02:35:28,923
you know,
going to kick somebody's ass mood 

3254
02:35:30,580 --> 02:35:33,460
criminal journey,
have a sports jacket on,

3255
02:35:33,461 --> 02:35:34,630
and uh,
the thriller video,

3256
02:35:34,631 --> 02:35:35,920
like a Letterman's jacket.
Right.

3257
02:35:36,010 --> 02:35:37,570
When that plays out.
Yeah.

3258
02:35:37,571 --> 02:35:39,520
I watched thrilled the other day.
My kids love it,

3259
02:35:39,521 --> 02:35:40,354
man.
They love the scene where he turns into 

3260
02:35:41,351 --> 02:35:43,300
a werewolf.
My youngest daughter go,

3261
02:35:43,301 --> 02:35:44,134
he's like a little cat person.
It's not even a wall to making it a 

3262
02:35:46,691 --> 02:35:49,690
cartoon or some shit.
I just thriller in some way or another.

3263
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:52,630
The Werewolf was so corny.
Look,

3264
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:55,150
and now it's like,
it was so weird.

3265
02:35:55,450 --> 02:35:57,790
Like it was not really a werewolf.

3266
02:35:57,820 --> 02:36:00,310
It was like a werewolf cat sort of 
thing.

3267
02:36:00,430 --> 02:36:01,740
You remember?
Remember what it looked like?

3268
02:36:01,741 --> 02:36:02,750
Yeah,
like the,

3269
02:36:02,751 --> 02:36:03,584
the whiskers grew out of his face.
I remember being like super excited 

3270
02:36:07,031 --> 02:36:09,160
about it because it was rick Baker that 
did it.

3271
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:10,233
He's the same guy who did the American 
Werewolf in London who did a costume 

3272
02:36:13,361 --> 02:36:15,830
guy.
He's a makeup special effects guy.

3273
02:36:15,831 --> 02:36:18,300
He created those masks and all the crazy
shit that you,

3274
02:36:18,340 --> 02:36:20,350
all special effects that you saw and 
like a lot of the,

3275
02:36:20,351 --> 02:36:23,000
like the really bad ass horror movies 
back then like there.

3276
02:36:23,020 --> 02:36:25,540
That's it.
Like what is that?

3277
02:36:25,690 --> 02:36:28,300
That's not a wolf.
What are those whiskers like?

3278
02:36:28,301 --> 02:36:31,050
That's some like a monkey mouth.
Yeah,

3279
02:36:31,260 --> 02:36:33,130
you're right.
It's like almost like a baboon mouth.

3280
02:36:33,131 --> 02:36:34,360
Right?
What is that?

3281
02:36:35,310 --> 02:36:37,510
He's like a baboon's man.
Snake eyes.

3282
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:39,570
It's like a lot of thing.
Yeah.

3283
02:36:39,580 --> 02:36:41,400
But that one looks like a werewolf.
Go,

3284
02:36:41,401 --> 02:36:43,780
go full screen on that one you got.
Oh See.

3285
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:44,800
Ooh,
that's bad ass.

3286
02:36:46,230 --> 02:36:48,120
It was pretty cool.
It was interesting.

3287
02:36:48,440 --> 02:36:49,273
Yeah.
But it was a not aware wolf like you 

3288
02:36:52,321 --> 02:36:54,960
would think of a werewolf like an 
American Werewolf in London.

3289
02:36:54,961 --> 02:36:57,170
Werewolf that also had on the,
uh,

3290
02:36:57,200 --> 02:36:59,280
high school jacket.
Right.

3291
02:36:59,700 --> 02:37:02,130
Did he pull up the American Werewolf in 
London?

3292
02:37:03,910 --> 02:37:05,420
I don't remember that.
Oh,

3293
02:37:05,421 --> 02:37:08,330
maybe not an American Werewolf in 
London.

3294
02:37:08,331 --> 02:37:12,380
Maybe he did when they were walking 
through the bogs because he was supposed

3295
02:37:12,381 --> 02:37:16,100
to be a college guy.
So maybe you had a college jacket on.

3296
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:17,530
Oh No,
it's just a.

3297
02:37:17,870 --> 02:37:18,703
yeah,
it was just.

3298
02:37:19,590 --> 02:37:21,590
Yeah,
it was just a down coat.

3299
02:37:22,490 --> 02:37:23,960
Fuck.
That's a good movie.

3300
02:37:24,230 --> 02:37:26,060
That was.
I got to show my kids that movie.

3301
02:37:26,450 --> 02:37:27,510
Don't show them.
Oh,

3302
02:37:27,530 --> 02:37:29,870
they're old enough.
It's an intense movie.

3303
02:37:29,950 --> 02:37:30,783
Oh,
look at that.

3304
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:32,360
Jesus Christ.
Go full screen on that.

3305
02:37:32,361 --> 02:37:34,900
I don't remember that scene.
Oh.

3306
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:36,693
Oh,
obviously.

3307
02:37:37,970 --> 02:37:38,803
Whoa.
How old should my daughter before she 

3308
02:37:41,241 --> 02:37:44,030
watches Bruno?
Once Bruno.

3309
02:37:44,090 --> 02:37:47,370
Oh,
that's the gay now buckets.

3310
02:37:47,420 --> 02:37:47,931
Okay.
Right.

3311
02:37:47,931 --> 02:37:48,764
Yeah,
she likes the beach boys show some gay 

3312
02:37:49,581 --> 02:37:50,414
shit.

3313
02:37:54,770 --> 02:37:57,170
She'll ask me if she can watch a movie 
at dinner and he's like,

3314
02:37:57,290 --> 02:38:00,350
I don't know what's appropriate anymore 
for anybody.

3315
02:38:00,410 --> 02:38:02,480
My wife got mad because I showed the 
nine year old,

3316
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:04,570
the original alien movie.
Oh,

3317
02:38:04,580 --> 02:38:05,870
did scare.
No,

3318
02:38:07,010 --> 02:38:08,870
she's a little bad ass.
She hung in there.

3319
02:38:08,871 --> 02:38:10,250
She loved it.
She's like,

3320
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:12,673
kids like that.
There's intention span is too short for 

3321
02:38:14,310 --> 02:38:16,550
slow movie like that.
You really think I'm moving slow.

3322
02:38:16,910 --> 02:38:18,530
Oh yeah,
I heard blade runner.

3323
02:38:18,531 --> 02:38:22,190
The new blade runner is very slow,
but now the old one was very awesome.

3324
02:38:22,220 --> 02:38:23,031
Really?
Yeah,

3325
02:38:23,031 --> 02:38:26,170
I heard it's like super underrated.
People are like,

3326
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:27,750
it's not doing well.
Yeah,

3327
02:38:27,830 --> 02:38:29,870
I haven't seen it,
but I need to see it,

3328
02:38:30,260 --> 02:38:32,690
but a lot of people are saying that it's
like really slow.

3329
02:38:32,780 --> 02:38:35,390
Yeah,
no movies are doing well this year.

3330
02:38:35,930 --> 02:38:39,830
What do you think that is?
Maybe people were watching Netflix more.

3331
02:38:39,890 --> 02:38:40,723
I think that's exactly what it is 
because the movie experience is an hour 

3332
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:45,260
and a half,
two hours.

3333
02:38:45,261 --> 02:38:48,350
Right?
Plus get their parking a lot of money.

3334
02:38:48,590 --> 02:38:49,850
Yeah.
Netflix is like,

3335
02:38:49,851 --> 02:38:50,684
what?
Nine bucks a month and you can just 

3336
02:38:52,641 --> 02:38:55,400
binge watch house of cards.
Your fucking head falls off.

3337
02:38:55,930 --> 02:38:58,610
Yeah.
I'm watching the OAA right now.

3338
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:00,620
Do you know what that is?
So weird.

3339
02:39:00,621 --> 02:39:04,910
Supernatural thriller on Netflix.
It's really great.

3340
02:39:05,180 --> 02:39:06,013
It's great.
Although some assholes on twitter 

3341
02:39:08,931 --> 02:39:11,610
thought it was a good idea to give me 
some spoiler.

3342
02:39:11,660 --> 02:39:12,493
That's fucked up.

3343
02:39:14,930 --> 02:39:15,763
I shouldn't have said.
I was just trying to tell people that I 

3344
02:39:17,881 --> 02:39:20,960
found a good show and then I fucked up 
because again,

3345
02:39:20,961 --> 02:39:23,690
late at night I barely paid attention.
Read some of the comments.

3346
02:39:23,691 --> 02:39:27,380
I'm like,
God to go to wolf shirt on.

3347
02:39:30,490 --> 02:39:32,890
What does it say?
We don't need a season two of the.

3348
02:39:32,891 --> 02:39:35,110
Oh,
a Oh fuck off.

3349
02:39:35,590 --> 02:39:36,423
People just think it's such a great idea
to be negative and he's so much fun to 

3350
02:39:40,901 --> 02:39:42,280
be negative.
Although I,

3351
02:39:42,281 --> 02:39:45,310
bad mouth aerosmith on this episode did 
a little bit.

3352
02:39:45,850 --> 02:39:47,560
I'm a hypocrite.
I don't feel good about that.

3353
02:39:47,830 --> 02:39:49,000
Wow.
You did what you gotta do.

3354
02:39:49,210 --> 02:39:50,540
Oh my,
um,

3355
02:39:50,560 --> 02:39:54,910
you know what the best show I've seen in
a long time as the Americans.

3356
02:39:54,940 --> 02:39:55,790
It's on.
Um,

3357
02:39:56,590 --> 02:39:57,423
it's on Amazon prime.
It's about this couple that comes from 

3358
02:40:00,101 --> 02:40:04,060
Russia and they've been,
they've been taught to be Americans from

3359
02:40:04,061 --> 02:40:05,440
the time they were like,
you know,

3360
02:40:05,890 --> 02:40:07,030
12 years old,
you know,

3361
02:40:07,031 --> 02:40:08,860
that's based on a true story.
Yeah.

3362
02:40:08,861 --> 02:40:10,510
Montclair New Jersey.
Dude.

3363
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:14,580
Fucking the acting is Keri Russell.
I forget the guy's name,

3364
02:40:14,581 --> 02:40:18,480
but they're just so fucking good.
She's a bad ass.

3365
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:19,380
Keri Russell will.

3366
02:40:19,380 --> 02:40:22,020
What else has she been in?
She was in that,

3367
02:40:22,021 --> 02:40:23,790
uh,
felicity,

3368
02:40:23,850 --> 02:40:28,530
which was huge 15 years ago on Fox.
Yeah.

3369
02:40:30,250 --> 02:40:31,290
But it's like,
oop,

3370
02:40:31,610 --> 02:40:34,140
I watched,
I watched six seasons of it in,

3371
02:40:34,180 --> 02:40:37,530
in six months and they fucked a bunch of
other people.

3372
02:40:37,531 --> 02:40:38,364
Right.
Like that was part of that is part of 

3373
02:40:38,791 --> 02:40:39,624
their job is they both go off to fuck 
other people and one of the people that 

3374
02:40:42,101 --> 02:40:43,560
you ask the fuck.
Well I don't want to.

3375
02:40:43,561 --> 02:40:45,910
Spoiler alert,
settle it down.

3376
02:40:45,930 --> 02:40:47,510
You'll see.
You'll see.

3377
02:40:48,600 --> 02:40:50,220
Don't say nothing.
All right,

3378
02:40:50,221 --> 02:40:51,054
let's wrap this up and we're going to 
talk about all the things we couldn't 

3379
02:40:52,591 --> 02:40:53,870
talk about on the air.
Yeah.

3380
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:56,140
Hey,
thank you so much for being on it.

3381
02:40:56,390 --> 02:40:57,570
On my.
My pleasure.

3382
02:40:57,571 --> 02:40:59,010
Can I give you some dates?
Fuck yeah.

3383
02:40:59,011 --> 02:40:59,550
Yeah.
Okay.

3384
02:40:59,550 --> 02:41:01,580
Let's do music.
Let everybody know where the fuck break.

3385
02:41:01,650 --> 02:41:05,790
Ladies and gentlemen,
