1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,520
Five,
four,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,200
three,
two,

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,700
one.
Nick the Paolo,

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
Joey,

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,521
boy.
Nick.

6
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:09,354
How do we become old men that don't 
understand computers and technology 

7
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:12,570
anymore?
Uh,

8
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,610
that happened even.
Even if I was 20,

9
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:16,140
I still wouldn't get it.
I'm not smart enough.

10
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,080
Stop.
Stop being so hard on yourself.

11
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,150
Your boy Jamie seems to have a grasp on 
it.

12
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,150
Jamie's Jermel no,
he's just on the ball.

13
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,210
He just understands shit.
You understand certain shit that.

14
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,080
Is there anything that I understand that
you don't understand a lot of shit about

15
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,210
cars or was it a net rate and chicks?
Right.

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,770
What happens in a lot of thing about 
cars,

17
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,110
but that's just because you don't,
you don't pay attention to cars.

18
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,070
It doesn't register it.
Some of it just,

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,590
it goes in and out.
Costa.

20
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,160
I've heard about it a lot.
Some things with electronics is the same

21
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:47,370
way.

22
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,203
There's certain level of electricity.
I'm scared of all music and stuff like 

23
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:51,860
that.
I just started.

24
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,670
I don't want to die,
so I just stopped listening.

25
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,090
My Buddy Jimmy did teleo from Newton,
Newton mass.

26
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,480
He is an electrician and one of the guys
that he used to work with,

27
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,120
I'll never forget this,
he was telling me that this.

28
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,983
Oh look,
someone likes to fucking hear the Ding 

29
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:05,694
every time.
The testicles.

30
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,533
No,
I don't.

31
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,383
Um,
that's how bad I'm shutting enough 

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,010
electricity.
Who was working with this guy and uh,

33
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,983
I don't remember what he was working on,
but the guy just got just totally 

34
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,030
zapped,
blew off his,

35
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,650
his,
all of his skin.

36
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,710
His fucking ears have gone.
His eyelids are gone.

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,980
I mean,
it just became a monster but survived.

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,873
And I'll never forget that.
I'll never forget him telling me about 

39
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,660
that guy.
And from that moment on,

40
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:31,494
from when I was 16,
I've been fucking terrified of 

41
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:34,524
electricity.

42
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,330
Yeah,
because you can't see it and shit.

43
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,520
That's crazy.
We live in a box,

44
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,383
right?
And in the walls of this box is this 

45
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,880
fucking invisible thing that if you 
stick a fork in there,

46
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:48,000
it'll kill you.
Just blow your fucking brains out.

47
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,231
Well,
it actually does.

48
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:50,430
It's like a fail safe.
Right?

49
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:53,340
If you stick a fork,
you just get a horrible jolt.

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,250
That's the thing.
I don't know what isn't that?

51
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,550
That's the difference between 
alternating current and direct current,

52
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:01,020
right?
Isn't it?

53
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,000
If I knew that answer,
I wouldn't be afraid of it.

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,193
Well,
apparently in England they have a far 

55
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:10,110
higher level of electricity that's going
through their walls.

56
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,963
Yeah.
Because the shit when you go over the 

57
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,930
special adapt as it just kills every 
stupid.

58
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,030
We let this two people live in England.
If you stick a fork in the wallet,

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,960
good finds your whole family kills them 
to be super powerful.

60
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,300
I was changing the filter.
I have a generator,

61
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,183
a generator,
you know it runs on natural gas and 

62
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:30,860
shit.
Oh,

63
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,693
because the winter comes one winter.
I live at the end of a dirt road in the 

64
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,210
woods.
So when when the power goes out,

65
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:38,880
mind use the first house to go out and 
it kicks right.

66
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:39,714
It's the best thing I ever did,
but I'm out there like fucking changing 

67
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,653
the filter on and then all the sudden I 
look over and his little instructions 

68
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:45,534
like on the inside of the door saying,
you have to disconnect the battery when 

69
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,870
we went down and you're not.
I got like a can of coke in my hand.

70
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,540
I can see what a screwdriver in your 
mouth.

71
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,650
I am frightened that I would.
I lived in Colorado.

72
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:00,460
We had one of those.
It was running on propane,

73
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,680
so when the power would go,
it's awesome.

74
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,543
The power would go out.
We go to click and then you would hear 

75
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:08,590
it immediately and one second and just 
let them.

76
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,483
It's.
I had the guy that told me the house 

77
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:13,390
told me to get it.
He had like a small one.

78
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,710
He.
She said you should get her,

79
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,840
you know,
does yours run on propane?

80
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,083
Yeah,
it's 250 gallons that last a long time 

81
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:21,904
to write 250 gallons of Iran for.
We had last year we had a storm and the 

82
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,183
power went out and ran for two and a 
half days and it only moved the needle 

83
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:30,280
like a little.
It was like,

84
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:31,870
this is the fucking balls man.
I know.

85
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,720
It is kind of crazy how little it uses.

86
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

87
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,643
When I'm that big storm hit,
was that like a year or two years ago 

88
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:42,360
with the one where there was no food and
people are going to Dunkin donuts and up

89
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,770
all the songs.
There was nothing there.

90
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,470
It just goes to show you how God damn 
fragile.

91
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,363
Our whole structure is.
We have this false sense of security 

92
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,380
that much more so over there than over 
here.

93
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:56,170
Over here at least it doesn't get cold,
but over there,

94
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,800
you know when,
when you get trapped in snow's,

95
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,240
you're kind of fucked.
Like I just got back from New York.

96
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,253
Oh yeah,
yeah,

97
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:02,920
yeah,
yeah.

98
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,820
I just flew back yesterday and I was 
supposed to fly in on Thursday,

99
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:07,654
but they got,
they got hit with 14 inches and 

100
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:10,840
everything just shut down.
They just canceled the flight.

101
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,520
I was headed to Chicago.
Mind got canceled.

102
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,190
So,
uh,

103
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,313
then the,
uh,

104
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,890
the airlines like that through your 
favor,

105
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,830
they send you a text like at three in 
the morning while you're sleeping.

106
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,750
Exactly.
Find you another bucking.

107
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,680
Oh,
that's great.

108
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,050
It's a fucking Laguardia,
which is 48 miles from my house.

109
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,400
It's at 7:00
AM.

110
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,910
You sitting in seat 48 only.
Thanks.

111
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,820
I had to change in Louisville and I did 
that.

112
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:34,654
And the uh,
we sat on the tarmac to tarmac for two 

113
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:37,864
hours because that was fun.
This is why I don't do the routing 

114
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,640
people out here yell at me.
You never come to California.

115
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,940
I go,
I'll drive to New Jersey.

116
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:44,774
You make the same money one night also.
It's hard to get out here in the winter 

117
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:48,520
especially.
Yeah.

118
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,543
I was on the tarmac yesterday and they 
had a d ice and then we apparently sat 

119
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,390
on the runway too long.
We had to go back and dis again.

120
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,083
Whatever I'll.
Complainant used to take six months to 

121
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,650
go over here on a horse.
No,

122
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,160
but it's,
it's still fucking aggravating,

123
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:08,380
I mean is to ride horses.

124
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,363
They used to take a horse with a wooden 
wheeled fucking sled behind it and you 

125
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,204
should know that and your baby would be 
on the sled with your wife and everyone 

126
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:19,080
would be scared of Indians.
They still do that and tells us.

127
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,990
I don't think they do that anymore.
I actually,

128
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,353
I actually.
But people make fun of the flyover 

129
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:28,024
states and and I,
I sit in New York traffic because I now 

130
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,890
live in the suburbs.
I'm going to ask you,

131
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,230
I have to drive into the city and the 
car.

132
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,350
The mayor does not want cars on a city.
He's made it impossible.

133
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,553
There's bike lanes on both sides of the 
skateboard lanes is lanes for old 

134
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:44,290
people.
This is in New York City.

135
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,060
Doesn't move.
Oh yeah.

136
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,980
No.
The city doesn't work.

137
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,030
Change the lanes.
Oh fuck you.

138
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,470
You can't.
You can't,

139
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:51,780
you,
you should not bring your car in.

140
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,860
And I do all the time like an idiot and 
I'm.

141
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,590
Well I'm sitting in the Ed and then 
complaining in my car.

142
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,740
I,
you know,

143
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,100
I would

144
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,933
fucking kill to live in Tulsa right now.
Eight minutes downtown to pick up 

145
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,374
something.
Everybody has a totally different 

146
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:08,270
opinion of the flyover states now that 
trump's president.

147
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,133
They're like,
oh,

148
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,820
they get to vote to he.
Yeah,

149
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,550
exactly.
I always liked them.

150
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,990
No,
you're exactly right.

151
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,240
That's exactly right.
Several different work.

152
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,990
This is real.
They are paying attention to in Ohio.

153
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,153
Well,
yeah,

154
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,360
that was a really good point that a lot 
of people had when trump got elected was

155
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:27,194
that all these people that live in these
predominantly liberal areas like 

156
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:31,040
California,
New York,

157
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,570
in particular,
New York City in California,

158
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,220
they were all like,
oh my God,

159
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:35,330
trump is horrible.
Oh my God,

160
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:37,040
trump is horrible.
We'd love Hillary.

161
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,050
We're so excited to have our first 
female president.

162
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,120
It's going to happen.
It's 100 percent.

163
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:41,954
It's going to happen.
Do you know anybody that's voting for 

164
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:44,240
trump?
I don't.

165
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,283
Because they're so insulated.
They literally don't know any 

166
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:47,894
conservative,
so they were convinced that she was 

167
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:50,564
getting exactly right.
If you take out La county in New York 

168
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,570
City that like he would have won the 
popular vote to just to kind of,

169
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,473
not even the whole state of California,
just La County and like a couple of 

170
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:03,380
bottles of New York City.
He would've won the popular,

171
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,233
but you're right there.
We're in a bubble and what's crazy is 

172
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:07,424
like he's not a good candidate.
It's not like he's like the perfect 

173
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:13,520
Republican and he's not like Reagan 
character directly.

174
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:14,354
Right.
Come upstanding guy who just looked at 

175
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:16,911
him and like,
yeah,

176
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:18,440
that's a precedent right there.
No,

177
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:20,450
no.
Which is kind of refreshing.

178
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,620
I mean,
I feel like it.

179
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:24,530
Yes.
Everybody for the last 30 years.

180
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,470
I don't want to go there,
but you guys know about right wingers.

181
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,250
I'm not fucking.
I'm sure your fans are like this.

182
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,030
Well not.
I'm labeled that.

183
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,870
Are you a right winger or you were like,
oh,

184
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,670
I have a centrist.
I am a Centrus,

185
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,513
but people in show business,
if you lean right on two issues that 

186
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:39,870
have 400,
you're a fucking Nazi.

187
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,840
Had been called a right winger.
Well,

188
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:43,870
yeah.
I'm pot-smoking Hippie for the minute.

189
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,710
You're a nice blend.
You're not perfect.

190
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:46,544
You're like fucking Jerry Brown.
When he was what he was saying when he 

191
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,990
was saying crazy.
Fuck,

192
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:52,330
I can't believe he's really the 
governor.

193
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,730
Nobody even notices the California 
doesn't even need a governor.

194
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:57,830
Like if he'd died and no one said 
anything,

195
00:07:57,831 --> 00:07:58,611
he'd be like,
where's Jerry?

196
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,560
I don't know what you guys want to do.
Let's go eat.

197
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,410
What do you want to do?
You're right.

198
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,870
He doesn't show up much.
He just pops up every once in a while.

199
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:09,330
Nobody talks about him ever in this 
state and he's 71.

200
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,180
He's got to be 70,000
years old.

201
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,283
No one complains about them.
No one talks about them knowing praises 

202
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:15,164
him.
It's just he's a nongovernment when 

203
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:19,010
swartz and edgar was the governor,
everybody talks about,

204
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:19,983
I can't believe the terminators.
The governor had governor or tee shirts 

205
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:26,120
at the fucking airport you could buy.
I mean it was.

206
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,013
It was a real governor.
Like we knew we had a governor right 

207
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,773
now.
You ask the average person just walked 

208
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:32,540
on the street,
who's the governor of California?

209
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,580
They will fucking stare at you like you 
have three heads.

210
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,160
They don't even know I liked that.
Well,

211
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,390
it's California.
Gonna succeed from the Union.

212
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,710
What we have to.
We have to.

213
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,083
It's like you might as well.
All those assholes that are using 

214
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,130
nonorganic.
What is this?

215
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,290
Where as governor Jerry Brown.
Jerry,

216
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,100
what is this?
Twenty four minutes ago it was put.

217
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,680
There we go.
Perfect.

218
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,050
Governor Jerry Brown's office remains 
mom on his location.

219
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,160
Oroville grapples with emergency efforts
can say,

220
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,060
oh,
you heard about that fucking that flood.

221
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,380
The dams ready to blow.
Holy Christ dead.

222
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:07,110
They're evacuating the area while the 
governor.

223
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,100
Hold on a second.
Go back to that.

224
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:10,770
Sorry.
While the government issued an emergency

225
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:11,700
order,
Sunday,

226
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,020
there has not been an update since.
His office with was mom on his location.

227
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,950
Oh,
he's fucking dead.

228
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,060
He's dead and they don't want to give a 
position that works.

229
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,670
It sounds very Russian.
Remember the Russian leaders,

230
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,513
they all of a sudden you don't hear 
about them or scientology when that 

231
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:28,010
guy's wife was missing?
No one talks.

232
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,060
Oh yeah.
And Leah had the balls to ask,

233
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:31,980
which he was sued.
I had her on the podcast.

234
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,320
I love her.
And like the major she's.

235
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,300
She's a ballsy lady.
Yeah.

236
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,150
Yeah.
She's a little animal.

237
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,663
Very,
very interesting that she was a 

238
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:42,234
scientologist for whole life.
It almost goes contrary to like how she 

239
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:45,924
called bullshit on everything.
Like how the hell did you not call 

240
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:49,560
bullshit on that.
It's weird.

241
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,840
That's my first question.
When I watch that stuff,

242
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,733
I go rally into some office in La and 
fucking they gave us some pamphlets and 

243
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:57,451
said,
look,

244
00:09:57,451 --> 00:10:01,350
we can put these on fucking.
How is Catholicism any less ridiculous.

245
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,910
I don't.
I don't believe in that shit.

246
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,150
And I was raised.
Yeah,

247
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,083
I was forced to go to church about 
seventh grade and I used to start 

248
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:09,930
wrestling my father,
you know,

249
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,600
breaking shit on Sunday and he wasn't a 
religious man.

250
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:15,330
He was laying in his bed and go,
go to church with your mother.

251
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,450
I think there's a real problem with 
having a right in having a left.

252
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,730
I think as soon as you have two sides 
that people can pick.

253
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,640
People just get on one side and then 
fucking dig their heels in.

254
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,503
Well,
I read that book recently and it's been 

255
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:27,080
out for about 10 years.
You probably are.

256
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:29,640
I know your boy Alex Jones's mentioned 
thousand times in it.

257
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,050
Uh,
the,

258
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,630
you know the truth about the Bilderberg 
group,

259
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,970
it was written like 10 years ago.
They keep updating it.

260
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
I,
I'll never vote again.

261
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,410
It really is like 40 people running the 
whole fucking plant.

262
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,940
Well,
if it really is though,

263
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,610
how the fuck did trump get in?
Because I don't think he wanted him in.

264
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,230
No.
But that sees a part of that.

265
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,280
Yes.
So it's a trick,

266
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,780
but he doesn't know.
He's a part of it.

267
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,740
Oh,
deep.

268
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:51,450
It runs.
It doesn't swear to God.

269
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,284
Don't you know,
this is the guy's name is Daniel 

270
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,070
[inaudible],
e s t u l I N it's about eight,

271
00:10:59,130 --> 00:10:59,730
nine years old.

272
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,563
His book.
And you will fuck I write it on 

273
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:03,990
vacation.
I was,

274
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:04,943
I was walking around the beach.
I didn't see anything that was in a fog 

275
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,543
going.
I can't believe what a sucker I've been 

276
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:11,610
my whole.
I remember I fucking bombed.

277
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:12,444
And Connecticut and not in Connecticut 
and Pennsylvania wants because a buddy 

278
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:17,320
of mine gave me a copy of,
um,

279
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,290
best evidence by David Lipton.
It was a conspiracy,

280
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,710
a book about the assassination by this 
Guy David Lifton,

281
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:27,600
assassination of JFK,
by this guy who was,

282
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,673
he was apparently,
he was an accountant and he was given 

283
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:35,270
some task to write some paper about the,
uh,

284
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:36,104
the President or about the Warren 
Commission and as he was going through 

285
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:40,050
the warrant commission,
which is just this enormous thing,

286
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:40,890
many,
many volumes.

287
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,993
He found all these inconsistencies and 
things didn't make sense and no one 

288
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:46,260
expected everyone to read whatever the 
fuck it is,

289
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:47,520
900 volumes.

290
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,683
So this asshole read at all.
And then he just went into detail about 

291
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,100
how ridiculous the Warren Commission 
report was.

292
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:54,934
And then he started investigating the 
actual facts behind the assassination 

293
00:11:57,971 --> 00:11:59,860
itself.
It freaked me the fuck out.

294
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:01,600
I was like,
they killed the president of man.

295
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,030
You went on stage,
right?

296
00:12:03,031 --> 00:12:05,810
I'm at it.
I've done nothing.

297
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,740
Nothing's funny.
Eight deck.

298
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,360
I've done that a couple times.
God,

299
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,320
goddammit.
Well,

300
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:14,950
I did when I was living in La,
I read Robert Bork,

301
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:15,784
Judge Barker,
and it to me it crystallized a lot of 

302
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:21,700
shit that I was thinking that I go,
oh my God,

303
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:22,534
all this history and,
but I was living in La at the time and 

304
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,640
I'm trying to spew some of that shit 
like it lawyer companies can do.

305
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,760
That probably is a little bit more 
exactly.

306
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:33,490
But as the military,
the original room at the comedy store,

307
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,324
they weren't really having some lady got
so fucking mad at me at the original 

308
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:41,800
room where I was just saying that I 
don't think that women should be able to

309
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:42,670
guard the White House.

310
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,190
You know,
that bit that I had and the bit was that

311
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,113
I can guard the White House either.
You know how I know because I met 

312
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:49,600
Shaquille O'neal in his Dick is where my
face is.

313
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,853
I'm like,
well the White House is experiencing a 

314
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,620
Shaq attack.
I'm the wrong dude to save the world.

315
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,290
Like people are not fucking even.
We're not even.

316
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,020
And then the joke and she was fucking 
screaming and yelling at me and go,

317
00:12:59,021 --> 00:12:59,591
listen,
stupid.

318
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:01,060
I just said,
I can't do it either.

319
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,470
I the do.
Do you understand that?

320
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,870
Now?
They don't hear that part.

321
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,680
They hear the part.
You said women shouldn't.

322
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:07,250
Exactly.
That's all they glom onto.

323
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,280
I'm like.
Then I said,

324
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,203
look,
this is where she gets really crazy and 

325
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:13,420
I wound up having to kick her out and I 
go,

326
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,250
my favorite people in the world where 
all women.

327
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:16,510
I have a wife,
I have three daughters.

328
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,010
They're my favorite people in the planet
guy,

329
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,340
but I can beat the fuck out of all of 
them and she went crazy.

330
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,880
She was like,
that's what I can't line it up,

331
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:27,730
set it up,
set it up and put the house on me.

332
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,023
What you just crystallize there?
I've been going through for like 30 

333
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:34,360
years on staff.
It's so crazy.

334
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:36,010
It's just.
But I'm saying myself,

335
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:36,844
I'm like,
I feel with physical combat on a daily 

336
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,890
basis almost.
I know what you can and can't do.

337
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,793
You can't leave a girl guarding the 
fucking White House by yourself unless 

338
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:49,450
you have that bitch in a robo cop suit 
with fucking nuclear weapons.

339
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,940
She's not going to pull it off.
I said,

340
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,803
well,
one of my bits was talking about women 

341
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,360
in the military.
This was again,

342
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:56,700
I think I was living in la when I wrote 
that.

343
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:57,534
I don't think they should be in the 
middle of die because they don't throw 

344
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:00,034
that.
Well,

345
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,751
I don't,
I don't,

346
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:01,584
I don't think I go,
I don't think you should die because 

347
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:07,840
Pam's grenade landed a flip from the 
bumper and it's one of my best,

348
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,140
you know,
I did it on Letterman.

349
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,500
That's fun.
I made and,

350
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,343
but uh,
every time there'll be a table at girls 

351
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:15,110
that would get the feathers.
Well,

352
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,280
I'm not black.
I'm not happy that Ronda Rousey lost.

353
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:19,114
But in a way it makes things easier 
because there was a bunch of fucking 

354
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:23,230
people that were going,
oh yeah.

355
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,970
What about Ronda Rousey?
She'll kick it.

356
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,520
And I made the mistake of saying like 
hyperbole.

357
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:28,930
Okay,
I'm the master of hyperbole.

358
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,790
I've exaggerated all the time.
I was like,

359
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,000
she could probably beat half the men 
bantamweights and true.

360
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,440
No,
it's not true.

361
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,070
I shouldn't have said it at the time.
Now.

362
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:39,904
It's definitely not true.
She could beat a few that aren't good 

363
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,250
outside the sport.
Look,

364
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,203
if she gets guys in the ground,
she can fuck a lot of people up or judo 

365
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:48,160
is 100 percent legit.
Her arm bars are amongst the best in the

366
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:48,994
business,
but we're always saying that bank debt 

367
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,190
to me,

368
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,150
she'll flip your,
your head.

369
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,860
You're fucked.
I'm fucked.

370
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,360
I'm kidding.
I fuck you up.

371
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,560
But the point is even with some coconut 
oil or all these fucking.

372
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:02,390
We were like,
what about Ronda Rousey Ronda,

373
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:03,050
right.
Okay.

374
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:06,080
And then thank God.
Now that she's lost,

375
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,590
everyone's relaxed with that,
but then the argument is,

376
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:10,640
well,
who she lost to.

377
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,950
You know who,
who fucked her up the most lesbian.

378
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,343
I mean.
Yeah.

379
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,170
Yeah.
No,

380
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,023
that's exactly right.
Here's the thing with the feminist 

381
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:20,960
movement,
they used to,

382
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,430
you know,
we can do anything men can do,

383
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,060
but they wouldn't push the physical 
thing they did,

384
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,700
but not anymore.
No.

385
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,990
I was at Gotham comedy club about three 
years ago and I'm doing a fight.

386
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:31,190
Breaks out,
had nothing to do with me.

387
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:34,430
Two tables got into it.
I mean a big.

388
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,440
There's a woman in the middle standing 
in the middle,

389
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:39,110
a girl,
and I don't mean like a butch dykey like

390
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:39,690
a brunch.

391
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,870
She's thinks that she can.
She's got her hands up,

392
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,113
she throws a punch at one of the door 
man or woman comes over and knocks her 

393
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:49,160
out.
Like she was fucking Larry Holmes in his

394
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:53,060
sixties.
She went down like she was shot and uh,

395
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,800
I never heard any lawsuits or anything,
but she was throwing haymakers at that,

396
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,520
like the fucking door.
They really believe.

397
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,750
And again,
like you said,

398
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,500
Amanda Nunez,
I'd be scared of that broad.

399
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,720
But,
uh,

400
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,370
Amanda Nunez and knock a lot of dudes 
out.

401
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:04,941
Yeah,
that's it.

402
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:07,400
I mean Ken Lesbian.
But it could be something there.

403
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,111
Well,
yeah,

404
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:10,110
she's half a guy,
you know,

405
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,940
that was an interesting to just fine.
Well,

406
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:12,950
I eat,
she's not,

407
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,090
she's all,
she's all woman.

408
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:17,090
She's a woman,
but you don't think some of her.

409
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,000
She's got a little more in a less 
estrogen than my wife.

410
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,520
A little,
little more man.

411
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,353
Joe.
I think it's all by saying that I'm not 

412
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:27,070
being derogatory and I made.
Yeah,

413
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:32,150
I think she should be more celebrated 
than she is because she's the first ever

414
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:36,140
woman of lesbian champion in mma.
I mean there's,

415
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,780
you don't see how come lesbians get 
their own designation.

416
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,650
Like they're not just gay,
like it's lbg,

417
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,570
you know what I mean?
Lesbian,

418
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,490
lesbian and gay.
Like they get their own thing.

419
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:49,040
They're not just gay,
but you can't be a gay woman.

420
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,770
You're also a lesbian.
Like a gay man is not a thing.

421
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,640
Like he doesn't have an extra thing.
It's not like you're also a lesbian,

422
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,520
you know,
you're,

423
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,340
you know what I mean?
Now you're talking to Tom Cruise,

424
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,500
you know what I'm saying?
I mean,

425
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:03,500
lesbians are not just gay.
They have their own little designation.

426
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,600
That's how they want it.
They get what they want.

427
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,570
This I was reading,
I was reading those.

428
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,580
Joey,
I was reading those,

429
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,360
uh,
like the terms now.

430
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,890
CISGENDER.
Oh yeah,

431
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:15,050
those are wonderful.
I ran out,

432
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,130
I ran out of printing paper.
I'm not shitting.

433
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,240
I would spit out was,
I was on like page 78.

434
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:22,700
I ran out of paper and I just started 
reading them.

435
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,743
I actually do this in my special,
my CSO special that's coming out 

436
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:26,804
Thursday.
I was talking about like what's so 

437
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,300
confusing now,
the libs,

438
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:32,970
you confuse every and nobody knows what 
bathroom to use and I got out at a night

439
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:34,670
club the other night and here's the 
ladies room right here,

440
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:35,504
and the men's room is right.
Next one's a pile of shit in the middle 

441
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,880
with a Tampon.
Stuck it in effect mustache.

442
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,950
It's true and I'm not being derogatory.
I actually have a relative who's like

443
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,940
transgender.
I wouldn't want to fucking have the dea,

444
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,530
you know,
but,

445
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,363
but we're talking about these people,
like they make up 60 percent of the 

446
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:56,364
population.
That's where I get a little fucking 

447
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:58,381
angry.
Well,

448
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:59,214
who's that guy from road has been the 
guy with the mustache that talks like 

449
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:02,830
this.
You know that guy.

450
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,590
I was always in La.
Trust Sam Elliot,

451
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,610
Sam Elliot.
Yes.

452
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,473
There's a great meme with Sam Elliott 
and it was like they used to be a time 

453
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:10,104
where we worried more about the safety 
of women and children than men who like 

454
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:16,810
to wear dresses.
It was one of those memes online.

455
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:17,850
I'm like,
Holy Shit,

456
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,120
and someone put it up and everybody went
crazy because here's the thing,

457
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:24,870
like there are people who are fucking 
crazy,

458
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,900
who are men who liked to wear dresses,
want to pretend they're a woman.

459
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,123
There's transgender people and then 
there's sick fucks that also likes to 

460
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:33,720
wear dresses or go into the women's 
room.

461
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,660
Opened the door.
You open the door to everybody.

462
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,171
Well,
that's it.

463
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:38,004
I said to these young kids and I'm 
onstage like these kids in their 

464
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:40,134
twenties,
like you should be taken advantage of 

465
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:42,570
this confusion.
You had a nightclub,

466
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,613
you see a hot chick.
You just slap it on and follow her into 

467
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:49,440
the ladies room and go.
I identify as a dyke tonight.

468
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,830
Open that I'm Annie Lennox went back 
when she used to wear suits,

469
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,330
but I'm definitely a woman.

470
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,823
Any Linux used to wear suits,
sweet dreams are made of and I don't 

471
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:03,930
remember what.
But when,

472
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:04,321
when,
when.

473
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:06,630
That was big.
When we looking at it going,

474
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,710
Whoa,
what will.

475
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:13,170
Sexuality is good and it's super hot.
Everything.

476
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,660
Beautiful shoes.
So did she come up there?

477
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:16,494
She is.
No,

478
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,970
she's a woman.
She's a woman.

479
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,460
She actually looks good there for crisis
with orange hair.

480
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,660
Fuck Bush.
That looks like if trump was transgender

481
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:27,810
in his teens,
not even as teens.

482
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,280
Like what?
He's like 11.

483
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,090
It looks like the president.
What a weird haircut.

484
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,780
Look at that.
He's got to let his hair go.

485
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:41,430
I want to talk to him.
I want to get him on mushrooms.

486
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:44,880
Get them shave his head toe.
Trump can change a lot.

487
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,010
He should let it go.
Gray.

488
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,230
He's not just great like what the fuck 
is going on?

489
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,123
I don't know is there's so much stuff 
happening in his head while he's got a 

490
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,390
trim around the years.

491
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,740
This isn't 19,
75.

492
00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:00,900
I'm just saying,
but I think he's picky.

493
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,130
He likes keeping it long so he could 
fucking spin it around and cover all the

494
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:07,830
barren lands.
Well,

495
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,320
that's true.
You can hide a lot of deficiencies.

496
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,183
He's definitely got something going on.
There's a whole theory as to what's 

497
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:14,514
happening in his hair that there was a.
There was a guy that ran a company that 

498
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,584
will.
They would take hair and they would buy 

499
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,443
hair from like people in India and then 
they bleach it to whatever color your 

500
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:28,020
hair is and then they would attach it to
your skull,

501
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,810
these micro filaments,
and it's kind of get that done.

502
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,310
Well,
it looked like shit and they went out of

503
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:33,144
business except they had an office in 
trump tower right below below trump's 

504
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:38,880
office and so the company went out of 
business,

505
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:42,390
but the office still remains.
So the idea is that he's the only client

506
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,553
and trump comes down,
gets his hair done by this guy who was 

507
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:46,910
in like,
I don't want to.

508
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,130
That's a great

509
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,980
idea.
I want to say it was like esquire or Gq,

510
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:53,950
like one of those magazines and it was 
like the secret behind trump's hair.

511
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:57,550
There's this whole investigative report 
on trump's hair.

512
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,230
It sounds like a plot for CBS Sitcom,
you know?

513
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,510
Did you see what was going on?
And I think it was chilly.

514
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,460
There was a paper,
a newspaper that had a photo of trump or

515
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:08,990
they use the Alec Baldwin picture 
instead of the Donald trump picked.

516
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,650
They fucked up or they did it on 
purpose.

517
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,330
He did it on purpose.
NBC will be doing that gun we fucked up.

518
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,510
Yeah,
right.

519
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,853
Here it is.
This is what the guy used to do the 

520
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,173
micro cylinder.
So it's like these little things that 

521
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:24,514
glue to your hair.
So it looks like the hairs are coming 

522
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:27,364
straight out of your scalp because they 
glue these little like little tiny hula 

523
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:34,300
hoops with hair attached to it I guess.

524
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,420
And it sticks right out of your hair 
right out of your head.

525
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,160
Yeah,
I don't totally understand it.

526
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:41,470
It's probably like pubes from a third 
world country.

527
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,710
Apparently it looked like shit.
Which makes sense because his hair looks

528
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:46,680
like shit.
Right.

529
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,170
Look at that.
See 500 here is added in 90 minutes.

530
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,900
He's got this thing going around his 
hair.

531
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:55,210
See that?
I mean that is like trump's hair.

532
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,300
That is.
Yes.

533
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,990
So this guy was bald and now he's got 
this flop that.

534
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:01,990
There it is.
See that's a wave in Hawaii.

535
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,870
Somebody should be writing like it does.
His hair doesn't make any sense.

536
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,040
It's like there's so much volume,
but so little volume at the same time.

537
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,271
Well,
when.

538
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:11,450
Yeah,
when you 70,

539
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,870
it shouldn't be long in the back.
Well all of it should.

540
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,773
It's chaos.
Like why not just shave your fucking 

541
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,310
head bro?
It's so easy.

542
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:19,690
You're,
you're worth a fucking $100,000,000,000.

543
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,930
You or your wife has not down with you 
because of the way you look.

544
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,970
You know,
like shave your fucking head.

545
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,953
You can do whatever you want,
but when you're that age and you got 

546
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:28,900
that much here,
you don't want to shave it.

547
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,090
Like you look good for the ballpark.
I feel good.

548
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,920
I'm not just kissing your ass,
but you do.

549
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,083
Uh,
but he,

550
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,133
I mean he,
something tells me he's got a big veiny 

551
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,803
giant scared the shit out of both 
Republicans and Democrats who had like 

552
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,160
an Ogres Dick.
I don't know what that looks like.

553
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:55,890
Just veiny and angry.
Big Slot and magically find.

554
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,870
I really was a dickhead.
Like he's got a whole,

555
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:03,130
like a whale whole top of his head and 
she just pre comes Lincoln out.

556
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,340
Holy Shit.
Cover it,

557
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:16,150
cover it on the plane.
On the way to Chicago,

558
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,710
I opened the airplane magazine because I
fucking forgot to bring my shit,

559
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,783
so I'm reading that and his Joe Rogan 
front and center talking about 

560
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:26,020
Valentine's Day.
Oh yeah,

561
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:26,854
yeah.
That was saying I wrote something that 

562
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:31,510
was so outrageous,
but it was really good.

563
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,340
Well,
what they would put in there,

564
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:34,840
it was like a fraction of what I wrote.

565
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,950
What I wrote was filled with swear words
and not mine.

566
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:38,963
You have,
you would just let Leo female side show 

567
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,483
with a little.
My female side is all they left in the 

568
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,500
stuff.
I,

569
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,330
he,
the guy asked me to write something.

570
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:47,841
I'm like,
all right,

571
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:48,674
so I'm going to give a fuck.
So I smoked a joint and I wrote 

572
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,470
something crazy and uh,
Sarah to them and they're like,

573
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,060
well they have to edit it heavily.
I'm like,

574
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:55,340
let him who cares?
And so what's in there?

575
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:58,070
It's like barely mine,
but it made sense.

576
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,030
It was kind of.
I was like,

577
00:23:59,031 --> 00:23:59,830
oh my God,
he's.

578
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,663
Because you said like in a few years 
what the grasp of the whole article was 

579
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:05,600
you saying let it go.
Let it out.

580
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:07,510
It's like you love your wife,
write it in a car and stuff.

581
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,410
Let that shit out.
Because in a few years we're going to be

582
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:10,670
able to read each other's minds.

583
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,893
Right?
Wasn't that the justice and it made 

584
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:14,270
sense and I usually don't believe in 
that shit.

585
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:15,030
I'm like,
Ooh,

586
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,863
we're.
We're about 30 years away from being 

587
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:19,400
mind reading robots.
I really believe that.

588
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,490
I don't think we've got to be done that,
so I don't give a fuck.

589
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,620
I think we're gonna we're going to be 
some sort of a combination of people and

590
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:30,230
machine within the next 30 years.
I really do.

591
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,333
I don't.
I think if you think about how close we 

592
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:33,704
are with communication about how we can 
tweet and send pictures and share 

593
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,680
information so quickly,
almost instantaneously,

594
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,713
then the next possible step is that 
we're going to be closer than that and 

595
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:46,680
we're going to have that shit in your 
head and we're going to make a chip that

596
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,660
has.
So I think so they were already doing or

597
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:51,950
not.
They've some probably.

598
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,530
I know the audience I played in Chicago 
that seemed like they had chips.

599
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,300
I'm like,
you know,

600
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:58,190
it was great,
you have to do that in Chicago,

601
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,170
but this Rosemont great,
unbelievable ideas.

602
00:25:02,171 --> 00:25:03,940
Just did as a CSO special there.
Yeah,

603
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,490
that's what they told me.
Room,

604
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,120
great room.
She goes to me,

605
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:09,830
she goes,
but she even want me.

606
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:11,030
He goes,
the Saturday crowd.

607
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,550
I sold out three of the four,
or should I was excited about it.

608
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:16,370
She goes to Saturday early shelf.
Might be they get a little rowdy.

609
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm on stage five minutes.
I'm making fun of Hilary.

610
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,960
You know,
they got mad at you.

611
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,801
I'm like,
no,

612
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:23,090
just one fat,
ugly bitch.

613
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:26,000
Got Mad at.
I wanted to kick her fucking ugly.

614
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:28,760
Head off her shoulders.
This chubbies fucking miserable.

615
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,860
Uh,
I'm,

616
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,621
I'm going.
Yeah,

617
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:31,460
I could tell them,
you know,

618
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:32,240
Hillary wasn't healthy.

619
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,860
I can tell you shit stain in her pants 
suit.

620
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:35,970
She's going up the stairs,
his blood come out of the nostrils.

621
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,670
Earwax and,
and she goes,

622
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,770
this lady right up front.
It's because you're a fucking asshole.

623
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,630
And it gives me the finger.
Whoa.

624
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:42,511
Like,
and,

625
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:43,610
and you know,
it's her hero,

626
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:45,650
Bro.
Why don't you be nice to her hero?

627
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,120
Fuck her heroine,
fuck her,

628
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,003
because a new picture of Hillary and 
bill and Hillary bills looks like he's 

629
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:52,064
wearing something from a motorcycle 
movie from the 19 seventies and Hillary 

630
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:57,920
is dressed like the villain and every 
Kung Fu movie,

631
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,800
and I'm not kidding.
She's literally wearing a fucking car.

632
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,663
I've joked around about that before that
she dresses like the villain in every 

633
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,283
comfortable,
but let's get to the next level and she 

634
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:10,370
literally has like an Asian jacket on 
and some fucking scarf underneath it.

635
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,610
She's trying to cover up the Turkey neck
because she loves China.

636
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:18,670
It's her version of a comb over.
She's just going to the miles from that.

637
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,500
How shall I saw her on the woods the 
other day?

638
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:23,620
She's like,
yeah,

639
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,490
and he lived four miles from their 
house.

640
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,040
They have a house in the day,
have a house in Chappaqua.

641
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,510
These are really up at Westchester.
I'm flaky.

642
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,350
They probably have 100 houses was 
crooks.

643
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,300
They would make so much money being 
civil servants.

644
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,190
Well,
they didn't dig once they get out.

645
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,480
Well,
even when they were in.

646
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,373
Well,
well W,

647
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,890
I mean he was given the majority of it 
when they started that foundation.

648
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,083
We know how they made it.
I'm in the selling influence all over 

649
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,210
the world.
Foundation just took a big hit.

650
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,280
Something just happened with that 
foundation.

651
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,660
Oh yeah,
they're going to shut it down.

652
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,600
There's no exposed during the election 
that it was a.

653
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:57,600
There was a big article like very 
recently.

654
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,240
I didn't read it.
I saw someone was telling me about it.

655
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,540
I don't know what it is,
shop talking,

656
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:07,470
but I walk into podcasts.
I fly when I'm like,

657
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:08,304
I don't know what I'm talking about.
That's where I step on the gas when I 

658
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:13,850
dig my heels and start fucking swearing.
Yeah.

659
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,473
How about that picture I sent you 
yesterday that I pull it to Duke 

660
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,293
Fitzsimmons podcasts.
Clinton foundation partner hiked opiod 

661
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,860
overdose,
hiked opiod overdose reversal drug price

662
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,950
by 90 percent.
That's very republican of Jesus Christ.

663
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,530
Jesus fucking Christ.
Yeah,

664
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,513
so an opiod overdose reversal drug which
saves people from opiate and they hiked 

665
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:41,070
the price.
It's opioid.

666
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,900
Am I saying it wrong?
I say opioid,

667
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,800
right?
I'm saying it wrong.

668
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,550
Opioid refers overdose.
We're fruit,

669
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,750
it shouldn't be a word like that.
Opioid,

670
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,760
it's heroin.
It's fucking heroin to say,

671
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,960
we'll call it horse overdose reversal 
drug by 680 percent.

672
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,800
Oh,
I'm sure that we have the testaments.

673
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,510
We have dual side is far.
Stockholders are important,

674
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:09,060
but I support Hillary Clinton and women 
that I support.

675
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:14,061
A woman's right to choose a woman's 
right to choose.

676
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,560
It's very important.
How many times have you heard the word,

677
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,720
the phrase a strong woman in the last 
fucking 20 years old,

678
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,540
nasty women.
Everyone's a nasty woman.

679
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:25,420
Now,
remember that when?

680
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:26,254
When trump called her nasty woman,
then all of a sudden all of these women 

681
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:31,410
had nasty woman as their twitter handle.
Yes.

682
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,290
You Jen Kirkman.
She called her self Gen Kurt Nasty.

683
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,930
Kirk woman.
She wasn't cooking anymore.

684
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,700
They're having fun with it,
I guess,

685
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,710
and went nuts when that tape.
I'm about.

686
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,960
Trump loves to grab pussy.
So does Hillary.

687
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,900
Why is it controversial?
Does or what you think it's saying?

688
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,490
Are you trying to say that?
Are you kidding me?

689
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,870
She burped in my face once.
Cvs.

690
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,590
Oh,
like a three.

691
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,423
All macro.

692
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,350
Like a candidate.
Small muscles in the back of the minivan

693
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:03,870
for three weeks in August.
I like smoked oysters.

694
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,950
Oh,
I don't know.

695
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,780
I'm not going to think about them now.
When I open them up.

696
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,160
I'm gonna.
Think of Hillary's breath.

697
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,750
You'll think a clit so when you open.
He's really.

698
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:11,883
Yeah,
it looks like a mutilated clitoris 

699
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,570
because there are a good way of 
maintaining a ketogenic diet.

700
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,850
Nick Depaulo not because I'm 
disparaging.

701
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,250
I know about all that shit.
I saw you eating.

702
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,413
You put up those little videos.
I know it was a facebook live or 

703
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:24,144
whatever.
You will make them breakfast with like 

704
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:27,810
five eggs and Kimchi and shit.
I went and I.

705
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,160
I have like four or five eggs every 
month.

706
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,553
I lawyer those goddamn criminals 
probably that worked for the Clinton 

707
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:35,034
administration.
They were trying to convince us for a 

708
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:40,060
long time that eggs are bad for you.
That cholesterol does.

709
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,980
Listen to me folks.
Not Bad.

710
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,873
Very good for you.
I saw you had like Kimchi and it was 

711
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:46,530
enough.
It looked like good.

712
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,560
Last you.
Two weeks.

713
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,550
Let's [inaudible] you hypostome oh 
right.

714
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,010
I'm still hyper.
God dammit.

715
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,113
I have this right here,
you need a workout while I'm talking to 

716
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:58,500
people and I want to try that elk Ross 
get made.

717
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,080
I was hoping you had some leftovers.
My,

718
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:01,914
my buddy John Dudley had this guy,
Chad board on his podcast and Chad Ward 

719
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:08,350
is this a barbecue master and he was 
basically saying that we're,

720
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,203
when I cook that what I'm doing by 
grilling things over high heat that you 

721
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:15,250
fuck it up because you dry out the meat 
somewhat.

722
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,241
So it was like,
all right,

723
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:17,074
well what does he say to do?
It says don't cook anything over 275 

724
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:19,511
degrees.
I'm like,

725
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:20,344
all right,
I'll try it.

726
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,243
So I put an elk roast on last night.
I put a meat thermometer in that bitch 

727
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:24,244
and I love it in slow,
low and slow for like an hour and a 

728
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:25,930
half.

729
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,790
I cooked this roast and it wasn't a big 
roast either.

730
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,700
Cook different hour and a half.
Got It to 125 degrees.

731
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:34,360
Then I took up frying pan and you said 
the south side?

732
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:35,590
Yeah,
with with butter.

733
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,710
Hot butter,
butter.

734
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,573
You wrap it up in aluminum foil and you 
put it in a cooler because the cooler 

735
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:44,710
will keep it warm.
Just like it keeps it cold.

736
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:46,420
Right?
I put it in a Yeti cooler.

737
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,620
No Shit.
Yeah.

738
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:48,454
Yeah.
This is what the.

739
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,303
All those barbecue masters do.
They let it finish in a cooler and then 

740
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:53,110
I pulled that bitch out.
I sliced it up.

741
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,780
Holy Shit.
I was looking at the pictures.

742
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,210
It was cooked.
Holy Shit.

743
00:30:58,211 --> 00:30:59,044
Was He right?
It was so delicious and it was so much 

744
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:01,924
moister than any row.
I'd cook some delicious rose in the 

745
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:06,790
past,
but they were always a good cook.

746
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,190
I've been told that I can cut into it 
too soon and that's why there's all that

747
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,033
bleeding out.

748
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,830
A teenager was amazing.
I poured that blood all over it.

749
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,600
I enjoyed that behind you.
Okay.

750
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:17,950
What's on the outside of it?
Go.

751
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,590
What's the rub?
Not to turn this into kosher salt.

752
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,410
Kosher salt,
black pepper and garlic powder.

753
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,760
So I put all that on before I put it.
Excuse me,

754
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:28,594
before I put it into the grill,
before I put it into the pellet grill 

755
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,680
pellet grills.
If you don't have one of those,

756
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,720
I don't.
They have a pellet gun.

757
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,620
Oh,
do you?

758
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,760
Yeah,
she'd squirrels and shit.

759
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,720
Yes.
Pellet grills are the shit because they,

760
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:45,240
they maintain the same temperature and 
it's all run on wood because it's.

761
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:46,074
It's totally healthy because they have 
an element like a heating element in 

762
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:51,280
there and they have these wood pellets 
in the wood.

763
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:54,370
Pellets are made when they cut wood for 
a table like this,

764
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,383
they take the hardwood from that stuff 
and then decompress it and then natural 

765
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:01,360
sugars in the would allow it to stay in 
these pellets and the pellets.

766
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,193
You can break them up in your hand.
It's not like they're like really easy 

767
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:06,760
to break because they're not really 
solid,

768
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,863
but when the heating element cooks them,
then the heat from that and the fire 

769
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:14,860
from the pellets and the smoke flavors.
The meat.

770
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,560
So it's natural wood flavor and 100 
percent natural.

771
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,930
No Chemicals.
You can get flavored pellets,

772
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:20,430
you mean?
Yeah,

773
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,263
you can get.
No,

774
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,420
you can get apple,
applewood,

775
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:24,150
you can get oak,
you can get hickory.

776
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,500
I don't think they have posted,
but you can probably start it.

777
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,050
You could probably start your own 
company.

778
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,403
Yeah.
Just have a bunch of girls sit in there 

779
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:35,440
by the lumberyard.
Just take it rubbing on the snatch that.

780
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:36,060
No,
that looked.

781
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,970
I saw that.
I'm like,

782
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,470
Dad,
that is cooked perfectly well.

783
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:41,660
Nice crunch on the outside to guys.
Definitely.

784
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:44,110
Right.
Because before I was doing it all by eye

785
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,210
and doing it by timing,
but using a meat thermometer.

786
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,350
I got the inside to 125 degrees this 
which is not quite enough.

787
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,540
It's a little low then cooking.
Yeah,

788
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:54,374
exactly.
So then when you sear it on the outside 

789
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,280
it gets a little more inside because of 
that.

790
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:01,310
And then when you wrap it up in aluminum
foil because a searing it was only a few

791
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,150
minutes and then you see her at the end,
which is just the opposite.

792
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:05,984
What people used to do the outside,
well this guy's a world champion 

793
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:09,920
barbecue guy,
so I just listened to him,

794
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,910
you know,
but I don't know ma'am.

795
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:14,000
They do it differently at certain 
steakhouses that state councilors you're

796
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:18,170
cooking a beef,
beef steak and a beef steak is so filled

797
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:20,080
with fat.
It's so different now.

798
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,470
Now the,
uh,

799
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,640
elk,
is it lean,

800
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,310
super lean,
punch back.

801
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,540
Oh,
it's the most flavorful.

802
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,400
Usually isn't.
That's why people eat beef.

803
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,810
It's got a rich different kind of taste 
to it because it's just,

804
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:36,370
it's such a healthy animal because that 
it's a giant fucking animal and it's out

805
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,180
there running around eating whatever the
fuck it wants.

806
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,350
It's not,
it's not a,

807
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,370
it's not at this seven,
11 and midnight.

808
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,000
It's like you're eating an athlete,
you know,

809
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:48,110
it's like you're going to lose his ass.
It's like you got something that can run

810
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:53,111
and sprint Tyson me joke.
Just to bring you back from the Ed.

811
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:55,860
Is that what it said on the menu when 
you started salivating?

812
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,190
Thinking about Carla was bent over a 
sofa?

813
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,000
No,
after I ran a three fucking charity.

814
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,770
Poland his ass apart days.
Good luck.

815
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,900
Herschel Walker.
Yeah.

816
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:09,980
It would have been better.
Yeah.

817
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,160
No,
that's um,

818
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,540
but you're getting,
you're getting like this is healthy,

819
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:17,300
strong animal.
It just has more vitamins in it,

820
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:19,520
more nutrients.
It tastes different.

821
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:20,354
It's just got.
It's more vibrant unless I fucking 

822
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:25,470
killed it,
so I know where it came from.

823
00:34:25,471 --> 00:34:27,740
I was there.
When you hit it on the one on one,

824
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:30,470
it's not shot with a bow and Arrow,
so that was my cousin.

825
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,730
He said,
fucking cousin,

826
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,920
cousins of killer.
Not a bow and Arrow guy.

827
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,830
It's to me it's like,
I dunno man.

828
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,860
Maybe it's not for everybody.
You went to Englewood.

829
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,403
I went to watts.
I found it outside of a liquor store at 

830
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:46,430
3:00
in the morning.

831
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:50,870
Bugling where'd you go?
Hunt and seriously,

832
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:52,190
but elk.
That one,

833
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,413
I think that was from a honed ranch,
which is not honestly not that far from 

834
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:57,140
here.

835
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,500
He was on a ranch and was pen then 
that's not pending at all.

836
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,060
Two hundred 70,000
acres.

837
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:04,330
Free Range.
We're here notes.

838
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,493
It's upstate.
It's like outside of like a half hour 

839
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:08,390
outside of Bakersfield.
Yeah.

840
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,440
It's a huge ranch.
The biggest ranch and all California and

841
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,410
so I've been there.
I've hunted elk there.

842
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,100
I've got a deer that I shot in Iowa that
I'm going to cook that way tonight.

843
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,911
Yeah.
My cousin,

844
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:22,460
that's what he does.
Boeing arrows.

845
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:23,294
The way to go.
It just takes way too long to learn how 

846
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:28,630
to do it for most people,
but it does not loud,

847
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,110
you know,
like there's no,

848
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,690
like this is my friend Cameron hanes 
always likes to describe it.

849
00:35:32,691 --> 00:35:34,350
He's like,
when you go to the woods,

850
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,470
like everything is peaceful and quiet 
and the guns like boom.

851
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,040
He's like,
you don't

852
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,710
seem out of place to go.
What the fuck?

853
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,150
He's like,
but with a bow and Arrow,

854
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:43,530
it's like almost silence,
like black,

855
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,470
you know,
but it just takes off and it's harder.

856
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:49,650
It's much a sport.
When you got a little more even,

857
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,760
you got to get closer.
You got to get way closer.

858
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,690
Are you going to be like sitting on its 
back when you got to be fucking sneaky?

859
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,910
Because that's,
that's what's really exciting about like

860
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,773
when you're stocking,
like one of the most fun hunts I went 

861
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:00,790
on,
I was,

862
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,940
I failed.
I went to Nevada,

863
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:05,280
we went a spot and stalk hunting for 
mule deer,

864
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,353
and so you're like,
you're creeping up on these deer and 

865
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:08,934
these fucking deer.
A mule deer is one of the largest deer 

866
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:15,840
species and it lives in mostly in the 
west.

867
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,300
And um,
they,

868
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,630
uh,
that's a mule deer right there.

869
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,350
And that's a mule deer right there.
That one with the velvet stone.

870
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,373
It's a big deer and they live in the 
woods and you got to creep up on these 

871
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:29,010
fuckers because they're used to being 
attacked by mountain lions.

872
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,640
So like,
here's a huge,

873
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,483
like a mules ear.
That's why they call them mule deer and 

874
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:35,940
see how big their fucking years.
I'm like,

875
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:36,600
Hey,
what's going on?

876
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,860
Because Obama,
what's over here?

877
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,723
What's over here?
How dare you fucking big ears you and 

878
00:36:41,771 --> 00:36:45,180
not an Obama Fan.
I'm a a Bama fan as a statesman.

879
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,850
I don't think a lot of things.
He did a very good point,

880
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,320
but as a statesman think he was an 
excellent representative.

881
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:53,640
I buy that.
That's part of the problem with trump is

882
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:55,970
that now assholes have a king.
You know?

883
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,790
It's like usually there so that.
But see,

884
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,633
that's what Allah.
He's,

885
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,810
he's plain spoken.

886
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:01,643
That's what I like about him.
He's not a fucking professional 

887
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:07,230
politician and know that's sort of what 
I like about him.

888
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,840
He's not a professional message and 
don't get me wrong,

889
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,730
but what do you.
What do you like about him?

890
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:15,030
What do you like about the farm?
Yes,

891
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:15,864
I did.
Oh,

892
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,000
how dare you.
They're not going to let you leave.

893
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,620
Huh?
Jerry Brown's going to raise up funds.

894
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:25,690
Going fucking smoking dope or not bad 
for you.

895
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:27,780
How dare you?
I forgot what I'm talking to.

896
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,960
What show I was.
See,

897
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:33,030
that's why I confused because I have 
guns in.

898
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:33,930
We'd.
Yeah,

899
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,430
I like the two of them together.
The Great.

900
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,440
Don't be scared.
What did you do?

901
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,170
I told you my story.
I did.

902
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,004
I.
Yeah?

903
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:41,900
Yeah.
Well,

904
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,733
edibles are a different trip,
especially for a guy wouldn't have 

905
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:45,224
joined since 1992.
She start super slow and acid put me 

906
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,940
fucking freaked out.

907
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,960
We were on vacation recently and my wife
can put away the fucking animals.

908
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,823
She likes edibles.
She likes to eat adult before she goes 

909
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:00,750
to bed and our friend of ours,
who is a guy from England,

910
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:02,250
really great guy,
very smart guy,

911
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,640
doesn't speak French and doesn't smoke 
the pot at all.

912
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:06,680
And my wife was like,
I'm going to,

913
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,080
I'm going to take my medicine.
And she,

914
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:09,780
she takes,
she takes it before she goes to bed.

915
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:10,830
She likes it,
it relaxes her.

916
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,360
And he's like,
well,

917
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:17,430
you know what was that every night like 
every night and not sleep without it.

918
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:18,840
If she doesn't have,
she gets to leave without it.

919
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,760
She sleeps better with it,
but she,

920
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,860
she goes down,
me and she fucking,

921
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,580
she,
she,

922
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,610
she doesn't get Joey Diaz doses but she 
takes high doses.

923
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,860
So anyway,
um,

924
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:32,490
she gives some to our friend and uh,
she gives him half of what she takes,

925
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:32,671
like,
oh,

926
00:38:32,671 --> 00:38:33,780
that's too much.
She's like,

927
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,680
oh,
he's going to be fine.

928
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:35,890
This motherfucker,

929
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,043
like an hour and a half later it was 
like we have to check on the children 

930
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,360
and make sure they're still breathing 
mine.

931
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,330
And next day he was still high.
The next day woke up for breakfast,

932
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:52,480
still high.
Just tripping his balls off because when

933
00:38:52,481 --> 00:38:54,640
you eat it,
it's a psychedelic drug.

934
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,630
It's not the same thing.
Fuck.

935
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,330
And first of all,
like I said,

936
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,193
literally I hadn't smoked a joint.
I wasn't ever a weed guy since like the 

937
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:04,204
early nineties.
So just weed in general is stronger and 

938
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:10,810
then to make it an edible.
And then I did the typical rookie stupid

939
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:13,150
thing.
I took a corner of it and I waited about

940
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,110
31 minutes.
I'm like,

941
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:16,260
this ain't doing shit exactly that.
I ate the rest,

942
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,530
like a snickers bar.
Next thing.

943
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:19,660
And I'm like,
fucking those are the four words.

944
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:21,370
No,
never say after you take weed.

945
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,423
I don't feel shit.

946
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,860
It was my first word yourself up for 
disaster.

947
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,290
I had no idea.
You know,

948
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:30,124
I didn't eat the whole thing,
but I took another bite and then I'm 

949
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:33,760
watching my fucking,
like I said,

950
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:34,594
my flat screen TV 51 inch and then all 
of a sudden it looked like a black and 

951
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:39,730
white 11 inch TV.
You start freaking and it sounded a mile

952
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:42,580
away and she had.
So I did what you supposed to do in that

953
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:43,414
situation.
I ran into a dark bedroom in standard 

954
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,250
alarm clock.
Well,

955
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,400
you know what,
you should do fucked up like that.

956
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:50,140
Drink coffee.
That's one thing.

957
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,120
The coffee does counteract the,
uh,

958
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,740
the cannabis.
That's one thing to do.

959
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,080
If you ever really freaking out.
If you have too much pot,

960
00:39:56,081 --> 00:39:56,960
your system,
drink coffee.

961
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,870
Another one,
take a cold shower.

962
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,280
Who's getting them cold as fuck?
Just get in there and suffered where you

963
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,114
can't breathe.

964
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,660
You know those cold showers?
Are you clothed?

965
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,660
She's just.
No,

966
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,310
I don't.
I love those showers.

967
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,190
I'd take those showers all the time.
Especially after yoga.

968
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,590
I take a hot yoga and then I take a cold
shower.

969
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:16,330
Like funny it goes.
It gets.

970
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,270
If you're wide awake.
If I could put ice in the water tank,

971
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:20,650
I would do that.
It's just like,

972
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,553
whew.
Mysterious illness linked to marijuana 

973
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:25,570
use and the rise and legal weed states 
that Scott Adams,

974
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:26,890
what they do to him.
You've got younger.

975
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,940
This story was going around for a couple
of weeks ago.

976
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,560
Why does it at the end of the year,
it's called a.

977
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,000
it's called it's killing causes damage.
Cannabinoid.

978
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,130
Hyper Misa Syndrome.
Is it real?

979
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,620
Oh,
I had no way you can look up on it.

980
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,200
People went to the Er for it,
but we have this nausea,

981
00:40:44,201 --> 00:40:49,201
vomiting and crampy abdominal pain.
Walking off pussy hot showers or baths.

982
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,900
Interesting.
Relieved by hot showers.

983
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,450
Okay.
Maybe I'm giving the wrong advice.

984
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,450
Just take a hot shower.
Oh,

985
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,930
I'm saying cold.
Thanks.

986
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,620
Jeff.
Declamation pussy.

987
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,633
You know why it says hot shower?
Because you're too much of a pussy to 

988
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,940
take a cold shower.
A cold shower.

989
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:05,980
Probably qg quicker.
Uh,

990
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,790
I love cold showers because it's like 
it's suffering.

991
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,840
You have to suffer there.
Yeah,

992
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:12,331
yeah,
yeah.

993
00:41:12,331 --> 00:41:14,550
I was when I lived in a fraternity,
university of Maine,

994
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,670
a hot water heater broke down.
It's,

995
00:41:16,671 --> 00:41:16,931
it's,
yeah,

996
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:18,050
February main.
Okay.

997
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:21,610
Let her literally minus 21 outside and 
we didn't have.

998
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,773
I go in the shower and it's so called.
You could feel each individual drop 

999
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,330
hitting you on the head.
Like it hurt.

1000
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,830
It was made my eyes.
Water.

1001
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:34,430
It's fucking like almost 32 degrees.
Exactly.

1002
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:39,080
Just a shade over ice when I was doing 
back in the top window days,

1003
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:41,420
there's this guy named Bob Rella and he 
was.

1004
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,493
My instructor is one of my instructors,
first black belts and it was just a 

1005
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:48,500
complete psycho and Bob Calf Rela you 
said always take cold showers.

1006
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,210
That's what he said.
He slept in the gym.

1007
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:51,044
He lived in the gym.
He said teach classes there for the 

1008
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:53,354
longest time and he would take cold 
showers because it was good for the 

1009
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:56,924
spirit.
This guy didn't take a quick shower 

1010
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,474
either.
It wasn't like,

1011
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,190
okay,
we're done.

1012
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,023
No,
they're just sitting there and we would 

1013
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:06,650
all be terrified of him and we get in 
that cold shower.

1014
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:09,980
We knew how cold it was and it was like 
a different level of psycho.

1015
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:11,990
He was.
It's a horrible way to die.

1016
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,020
You don't die that way.
You just get cold.

1017
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,370
Nondisabled people have fallen through 
ice and.

1018
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,540
Oh yeah,
and I mean,

1019
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,260
can you imagine there's a photo that 
they found recently of a moose.

1020
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,060
It was like half in,
half out.

1021
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:23,923
It just got tired trying to get out of 
the ice and [inaudible] moves a walk on 

1022
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:27,800
frozen lakes,
but no,

1023
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,753
they're fucking 1800 pounds and then 
they'll step in one area where it's not 

1024
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:32,864
that thick.
This fucker went right through and you 

1025
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:35,114
just got stuck

1026
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,670
any and they froze.
Their froze there in the lake.

1027
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,420
Like that lady in the news last week.
The goodwill bin.

1028
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,940
You read that one right?
In some way?

1029
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:49,560
I think it was in Pennsylvania.
She goes to a goodwill bin to put it in.

1030
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,060
Yeah,
at two in the morning.

1031
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,090
Although they said she had items out 
when they found her,

1032
00:42:54,091 --> 00:42:57,450
it sounded like she was robin it to me,
but she's in the goodwill bank tone.

1033
00:42:57,451 --> 00:42:59,490
The morning the fuck,
and she's on a foot ladder.

1034
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,760
Know the band lead,
falls in on her arm.

1035
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,000
Her arm and wrist.
She's hanging from the side of the band.

1036
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:08,580
The latter.
She's caught there listening to this.

1037
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:11,250
That happened at two in the morning.
They find were frozen to death.

1038
00:43:11,251 --> 00:43:12,930
The next one.
Oh Jesus.

1039
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,510
Not fucking whore.
She's doing a nice thing.

1040
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,920
Contributing close.
Talk about it.

1041
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,860
No good deed and they find her hanging 
from the bins

1042
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,380
people do that.
They don't realize how risky it is.

1043
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:26,780
Like you ever see someone trying to fix 
their gutter with a ladder.

1044
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:29,050
And that was my old man.
I can't.

1045
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,970
That's how well already lane's dad fell 
off her eyes.

1046
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,980
Yeah,
I'm fucking ladders.

1047
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,183
My old man will be on a ladder with 
fucking like a cigarette work and 

1048
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,140
there'll be a gas pipe of floataway know
Christ like data.

1049
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:43,640
The guy from Osha wants to talk to you.

1050
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:44,743
I was at a gas station recently in 
Hollywood and some asshole came up to 

1051
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:47,960
me,
asked me about my car and he's smoking a

1052
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:51,200
cigarette and the guy who run the gas 
station screaming at him,

1053
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:54,110
get the fuck away from the gas,
get the fuck away from the guest.

1054
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,910
And he's like,
fuck you bitch.

1055
00:43:55,911 --> 00:43:56,744
He was like,
this weird guy was just hanging out 

1056
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,370
wearing black and I wasn't black.
That was weird.

1057
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:06,200
He was like pretending the Indian guy I 
think you know good though.

1058
00:44:06,201 --> 00:44:07,140
Fuck.
He was.

1059
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,003
It was so caricature because he was like
a caricature of an Indian gas station 

1060
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:12,614
owner.
But he really wasn't actually in India 

1061
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:18,920
there's a gas station that I go to is 
run by Indians and they even have like a

1062
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:19,754
fucking old sign on the door.
It's like the peaceful gas station 

1063
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,290
because the nicest people,
they're all Indians at work.

1064
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,660
They're super cool.

1065
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:28,263
Sometimes it'll be a table,
like when I'm doing a show and they 

1066
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:32,010
hanging on

1067
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,620
every word polite and I point everybody 
else.

1068
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,590
Why can't you be like the let's say to 
the rest of the audience,

1069
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,453
look at this Indian table with manners 
and Indians in general are very 

1070
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:46,380
interesting people because they have a 
caste system that they don't.

1071
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,550
They just,
they have rich people,

1072
00:44:48,551 --> 00:44:49,384
like extremely rich people that exist 
with extremely poor people with no 

1073
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:55,050
problems.
It's real weird.

1074
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:56,150
Like they had.
There's a,

1075
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,520
there's a man that's the key to the is 
that the key is,

1076
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,420
oh,
so there's too much integration there.

1077
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,550
There's,
there's a,

1078
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:07,410
there's this extremely wealthy guy in 
India and he has this fucking palace and

1079
00:45:07,411 --> 00:45:10,080
surrounding his palaces,
like utter slums and ghetto.

1080
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:15,180
And he's got a golden palace and his 
name is Aziz Ansari.

1081
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,060
Trussell.
Peter's ladies and gentleman.

1082
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:18,881
Oh,
Russell P,

1083
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:20,830
I forgot there's a bigger guy.
Yeah,

1084
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,910
he's the biggest.
Russell Russell's the biggest Indian.

1085
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,260
Well,
he's one of the biggest comedians in the

1086
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:26,970
world.
He's also one of the biggest nice guy.

1087
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:31,971
He is a sweetheart dust at the festival.
He takes us all to a blue,

1088
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:35,690
a blue jays game and throw out the first
pitch or some shit.

1089
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,870
Yeah,
he slept in a bed.

1090
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:37,704
Nicer man.
Russell Peters is live in the goddamn 

1091
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,330
dream.
Really is.

1092
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:42,510
He's one of the greatest guys I've ever 
met in my life.

1093
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,320
I love him and I really,
I don't know Aziz.

1094
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,430
I see.
I used to see him at the comedy cellar,

1095
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,230
but I don't.
He's a fan.

1096
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:52,090
That impression.
I'm left wing.

1097
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,930
I have zero problem with them.
I've always said hi to him.

1098
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:57,240
I always got along with them,
but other people have issues with them,

1099
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,840
but I never know what that issue is 
hard.

1100
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,940
You know when someone has issues with 
someone,

1101
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:03,361
you're like,
okay,

1102
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:04,410
are you jealous?

1103
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:07,680
Are you a dick?
Do you think that he deserved.

1104
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:08,760
It's always,
you know,

1105
00:46:08,761 --> 00:46:09,594
it's,
it's hard to tell because the knock on 

1106
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:12,084
some people are the like,
like someone said this to me and I 

1107
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,120
don't,
I don't agree with it,

1108
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:16,740
but this is what they said.
They were like,

1109
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:17,574
you know,
all the only reason why he's as famous 

1110
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:19,410
at all.
It's because he's Indian.

1111
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:20,320
He's not funny.
No.

1112
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:21,510
I was like,
well that camp,

1113
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,610
that doesn't make any sense.
Yeah.

1114
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,070
That doesn't make any sense.
So I,

1115
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,353
he,
I know he's a fucking hard hard worker 

1116
00:46:28,891 --> 00:46:33,300
because I played up at Albany and I was 
talking to Tommy Nikki because name that

1117
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:36,570
runs into Albany club and he told me is 
he came up,

1118
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:39,030
he was tightening up but like an arena,
you know,

1119
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,590
and he did and one night he did a 5:45
minute sets.

1120
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,420
I believe it's five.

1121
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,460
We worked together at the comedy store,
which,

1122
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:48,343
and he some point I did three shows in a
row back to back three shows in a row 

1123
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:54,990
and he's got his notes out and he's 
working on material follow anybody.

1124
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

1125
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,293
Good for him at this thing that happens 
when someone becomes famous where 

1126
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:03,120
instead of people like if you don't,
even if you don't get it,

1127
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:04,920
there's a lot of people that I don't 
get.

1128
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:06,840
I don't think they're famous,
but I don't talk shit about.

1129
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,010
No,
I don't care.

1130
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:08,933
After Bay when we were younger,
like I'm much better now when you're 

1131
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:13,170
younger,
when you get into the business,

1132
00:47:13,171 --> 00:47:14,280
you're like,
why is he making it?

1133
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:18,150
I'm not putting back.
Then when you see how hard it is and you

1134
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:20,850
got to put the work in regard this,
like you said in this context,

1135
00:47:20,851 --> 00:47:24,630
you might not like what they do and as 
you get older you can appreciate what it

1136
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,340
took to.
Of course,

1137
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,270
right?
Yeah.

1138
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:28,730
Speaking of that,
let me ask you,

1139
00:47:28,731 --> 00:47:30,010
but probably do you have those

1140
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,110
going on and I'm like,
ah.

1141
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,103
I'm like Bernie Sanders.
He's writing a letter we have to deal 

1142
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:35,614
with.
It's called incoming equality and come 

1143
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,060
to greg.
That was in the bathroom.

1144
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:42,610
I saw hillary's balls.
She's got a big bulky black lives matter

1145
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,310
and yeah,
I tried to help them with that.

1146
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:46,930
That's why he lost.
He couldn't get the black vote.

1147
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,760
I said,
change your first name to colonel.

1148
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,870
What the fuck?
It's right in front of you.

1149
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,470
Nothing here and fucking a fucking 
woodland hills China that you're talking

1150
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:58,240
about.
Delicious food and that's racist.

1151
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,243
Is that chilled?
Does this show that big where you have 

1152
00:48:02,471 --> 00:48:03,304
to worry about offending sponsors?
Meet in my basement by myself saying 

1153
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,630
answers are fine.
Don't worry.

1154
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:11,620
They've seen it all by now.
It's not a fucking single thing we could

1155
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:13,420
throw at them,
although match.com

1156
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,310
it.
They were one and done with me.

1157
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,330
I was like,
c'mon.

1158
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,550
Everybody wants to fuck.

1159
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,870
Cut.
Cut.

1160
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,850
Cut me off after one ad to people like 
chlamydia.

1161
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,680
I'm like,
look,

1162
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,790
everybody who doesn't like to fuck?
Am I lying?

1163
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,980
I'm trying to get you guys some money.
Who doesn't?

1164
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:33,050
I'm 50.
You don't like to fund anymore place.

1165
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:33,903
I got the hips of fucking 70 year old 
soccer player whom we can get you to 

1166
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:36,994
yoga class.
Get you some fucking kettlebells toward 

1167
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,980
doing some swings before.
Let me again.

1168
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,350
Do you know George Lopez?
Yes.

1169
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,690
Never met him.
Fucking love him.

1170
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,430
Yeah.
Love is comedy.

1171
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:49,264
I just,
I can't believe I haven't run into him 

1172
00:48:50,321 --> 00:48:51,310
somewhere he could.
Dude,

1173
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,173
I know.
He seems like he called me up after the 

1174
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:54,544
Carl's been CEO thing.
This is his first words out of his 

1175
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:57,860
mouth.
My motherfucker.

1176
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,420
I know I would like.
I,

1177
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:06,700
I look,
I know he's not crazy about yet,

1178
00:49:06,701 --> 00:49:07,990
but he does it.
So funny.

1179
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:08,940
Going half towels,
soft,

1180
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,450
white people are in shit.
He's,

1181
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,280
he's,
he's a true to me.

1182
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:14,800
Fun Comic Man.
It makes me laugh.

1183
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:19,360
I'm a funny guy offstage.
He's a comic jam and I never fucking met

1184
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:19,901
him.
I just,

1185
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:21,630
I,
I thought I'd run into him somewhere,

1186
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,470
but I guess it's not surprising at them.
You'd love them.

1187
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:25,810
Why am I going to see that thing where 
he got in trouble?

1188
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:26,910
Yeah.
What?

1189
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:30,370
Chewing out the girl.
Me Every night for the last 40 years now

1190
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:31,240
he said,
well,

1191
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,920
what he said was funny.
He says,

1192
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:33,791
he goes,
Latinos,

1193
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:34,624
we have two rules.
Don't park it from my house and don't 

1194
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,264
marry a black guy.
I mean he's just being funny and some 

1195
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,610
lady stands up and starts yelling at 
him.

1196
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:44,080
Black.
I don't know.

1197
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,840
I don't know,
they wouldn't mention it on TMZ.

1198
00:49:46,841 --> 00:49:48,730
You might want to put that in the 
fucking article it.

1199
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:50,380
So she bought this store.
Couldn't tell.

1200
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,330
I'm saying yes.
You think so?

1201
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,393
Yeah.
Maybe she was one of my hand Jack 

1202
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:55,360
couldn't be.
She's like enough,

1203
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,590
but no,
you're right.

1204
00:49:56,591 --> 00:49:57,424
It could be a white lid,
but I'm guessing I was just guessing 

1205
00:49:59,061 --> 00:50:00,480
that the way he said it and shit.
But,

1206
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,290
but it's not going to hurt his career.
No,

1207
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:06,610
it's going to help his career.
But you would get more trouble.

1208
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,160
Like when Tracy Morgan said if I have a 
baby and was gay,

1209
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:10,180
I'd kill it.
Oh,

1210
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:11,014
that bed.
Even though he said I stabbed a little 

1211
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,550
Nigga.
Oh,

1212
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,070
that's different.
Matter of fact in have pass.

1213
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,640
I thought he used the word kill but 
stab.

1214
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,980
But he's,
he's fucking hilarious.

1215
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,010
But my point being he,
he got,

1216
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,140
he got a little hot water for about a 
day and a half.

1217
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:28,130
Well he actually had to apologize.
He

1218
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,330
apologized.
Fine.

1219
00:50:29,331 --> 00:50:30,164
But,
but if that was you or somebody at your 

1220
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:34,340
level of fame and you're white,
you're poly Dourdan matter,

1221
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:36,430
you'd be fucking booted.
Yeah,

1222
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,990
I guess so man.
I just,

1223
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:38,824
I feel like you know,
so there has to be a line where you 

1224
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:43,610
realize that someone is just fucking 
around.

1225
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,700
There has to be aligned with whatever 
happened to just fucking around.

1226
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:49,910
If you want to kill just brian and his 
fucking followers.

1227
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,360
I'm not asking them anyway.
Nobody knows where he is.

1228
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,160
He's dead.
He's hiding under the.

1229
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:56,440
He's underneath the fucking.
Hey,

1230
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,250
I'm trying to fix it with crazy glue.
That's true.

1231
00:50:58,251 --> 00:51:00,200
Nobody has seen him lately.
Is that currently?

1232
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:01,460
He's old as fuck,
man.

1233
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:03,350
When you that old,
you're going to have some days where you

1234
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:06,950
can't go outside for days.
Right?

1235
00:51:06,951 --> 00:51:09,020
You're shitting your pants,
you got problems.

1236
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:13,970
Hip doesn't work,
but I saw him like I'd say last summer,

1237
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,210
right?

1238
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,043
I'd say months ago.
Makes it seem like the idiot that he 

1239
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:17,504
always has been.
I literally have not seen a thing from 

1240
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:22,460
him since he's been the governor.
Not a thing.

1241
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,810
You sure?
Nothing.

1242
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:25,520
I don't know.
See Yoga,

1243
00:51:25,521 --> 00:51:27,740
you get kettle bells.
You get fucking family.

1244
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,990
I see that fat fuck from New Jersey all 
the time,

1245
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,380
but he disappeared for a few months in 
New York.

1246
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,300
They were asking where he was.
They were going to kill him.

1247
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,753
Mean that guy got he.
There were some real shit that happened 

1248
00:51:38,391 --> 00:51:40,460
when he closed that bridge.
When we get close that bridge.

1249
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:42,320
Some people like we're supposed to go to
the hospital.

1250
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:45,770
Couldn't make it to the hospital as 
parents probably.

1251
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,740
No,
I'm just saying from Bergen.

1252
00:51:48,741 --> 00:51:49,401
Yeah,
North Bergen.

1253
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:50,960
Yeah.
Well he's um,

1254
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:51,823
he's,
he's going to be in hot water for years 

1255
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,470
for that.
He'll never escape that.

1256
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:57,350
And that's one of the reasons why trump 
pulled them from the fucking cabinet and

1257
00:51:57,351 --> 00:51:58,850
now he's,
he's criticizing trump.

1258
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,880
It's kind of interesting.
I,

1259
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:01,880
Christie,
I never,

1260
00:52:01,881 --> 00:52:04,040
he seemed like A.
I loved it.

1261
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,360
Like I saw a clip,
pam talent,

1262
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:10,010
some woman at a town hall and sit down 
and shut up some screaming about a union

1263
00:52:10,011 --> 00:52:11,990
and just fucking,
that's nice when you're local,

1264
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,900
you can do.
Exactly.

1265
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:16,490
But I'm saying,
but he still seemed kind of whiny to me.

1266
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,560
And then I saw him in the Yankee 
uniform.

1267
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,640
Oh God.
Jesus h Christ is gaunt,

1268
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:26,690
his lower pussy area was sticking up.
There's no way that guy's seen as Dick.

1269
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,810
No one way.
No.

1270
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,720
I think his wife could see it from where
she said,

1271
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:31,660
I don't mean to be offensive.
Mr.

1272
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,540
looked like an ice cream cone.
It started fucking.

1273
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:38,150
He looks like one of those things that 
you use for pastries to write.

1274
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:39,430
Happy Birthday.
Next three bags.

1275
00:52:39,431 --> 00:52:40,460
Just squeeze it.
Yes.

1276
00:52:40,461 --> 00:52:41,294
Yeah.
Look at that.

1277
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,120
What the fuck?
Did he know what he looked like?

1278
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,233
He's definitely not one that thing.
He would have been better in a hoop 

1279
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:47,810
skirt.
Look,

1280
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:50,450
he wouldn't look.
This poor bastard is an addict.

1281
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,790
That is a food addict.
That is 100 percent.

1282
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,410
Look at the one above it.
Go to the one above it.

1283
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:56,240
Jamie.
The one which shows his pussy area.

1284
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,550
Look at that.
What in the fuck is going on there?

1285
00:52:58,940 --> 00:52:59,780
What?
Where's your deck,

1286
00:52:59,781 --> 00:53:01,250
Bro?
Holy Christ.

1287
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,020
Looks like that.
Looks like Hillary's pantsuit.

1288
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:06,200
A goddamn insane.
That is a goddamn insane pose to.

1289
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:07,610
She never put your hand on your hip like
that.

1290
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:10,310
If you look like this,
don't stand like that.

1291
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,560
You should stand like a sumo wrestler at
all times.

1292
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:15,170
You should have a wide stance.
Should never let your legs rub together.

1293
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:16,970
You should be standing like you're ready
to shoot a blast.

1294
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:19,850
Double on.
Don't you have advisors Jan term?

1295
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,620
Can you turn my thing up?
Do Control.

1296
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:25,820
My volume was probably over here.
I can't hear myself.

1297
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,490
They only got right there.
Is that letter to right there?

1298
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,260
That's good.
Yeah.

1299
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,260
Yeah.
It was on way low.

1300
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:32,910
He I got to fail.
No.

1301
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:34,660
Even if he was skinny,
we dropped piggy.

1302
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:38,850
Even if even if he was skinny,
he had like a horrible.

1303
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,090
Well he doesn't have the best genetics,
but more important than that.

1304
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:42,953
Well,
who knows if he has the best genetics 

1305
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,220
because I looked it up on the genealogy 
site.

1306
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,270
Oh,
where's he from?

1307
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,720
His mother was a Malibu in Sicily and 
I'm not going to be running there.

1308
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:54,570
It looks like Kevin James there.
I could get that fucking guy in shape.

1309
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:55,404
I swear to God.
I swear to God I'd have to do is get 

1310
00:53:57,331 --> 00:53:57,540
them off.

1311
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,910
The sugar would take awhile,
but he's addicted to sugar.

1312
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,110
No,
he lives on salads.

1313
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:01,944
They said no dressing.
Writing is a picture of him at the game 

1314
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:06,143
and he's got a little bag of m and m's,
a large bag of m and m's and he's 

1315
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,380
pouring the little bag of m and m's into
the large bag of m and Ms.

1316
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:14,670
I'm not joking.
Look at that.

1317
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:15,563
See?
He's got him with the best and he's a 

1318
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:19,860
sugar addict.
See how he's pouring it in there?

1319
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:21,630
Well,
he's my little one into the big one.

1320
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,300
You're not fat at all.
No.

1321
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,930
I'm just sad.
I don't like sugar,

1322
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:25,764
but I can't.
I was hoping to get a ball so I could 

1323
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:29,800
lose this last 20.
That's what happened.

1324
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:33,150
Know you shipped blood for 18 months.
Just don't eat at night.

1325
00:54:33,151 --> 00:54:35,370
We talked about this before the podcast.
Don't do that.

1326
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:36,953
I when I heard you say that,
I almost fainted because I've been 

1327
00:54:38,281 --> 00:54:39,720
saying that to my wife.
I said,

1328
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:42,690
the only time I've ever lost weight my 
life is when I'd go to bed hungry.

1329
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:43,763
It's not just that you lose weight.
Your body actually produces more dense 

1330
00:54:47,071 --> 00:54:49,160
muscle cell or more lean muscle.
Yeah.

1331
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,240
When you,
when you're burning fat,

1332
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:54,510
well he's definitely,
but it's also your body has more time to

1333
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:56,430
rebuild your tissue.
You recover better.

1334
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,770
It's not just like going to bed hungry 
thing.

1335
00:54:58,771 --> 00:54:59,604
It's actually good for you just don't.
The idea is as Dr Rhonda Patrick said 

1336
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:05,610
this,
you can send like a little African kid,

1337
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,810
just a fucking sandwich.
Just you need to edible an edible.

1338
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:12,570
I'm never doing that again.
This is why I love you though,

1339
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:14,610
Joe,
because the last time I was here I go,

1340
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:15,990
uh,
I said,

1341
00:55:15,991 --> 00:55:18,220
yeah,
I thought about was like,

1342
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,560
I want to take steroids at this age.

1343
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,393
I'm fucking sick of working out now.
I've said that to about 20 people and 

1344
00:55:22,471 --> 00:55:22,971
they were all like,
well,

1345
00:55:22,971 --> 00:55:24,290
how do you do that?
You're gonna fucking be kidney.

1346
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,860
Had 55.
You looked at me and go,

1347
00:55:25,861 --> 00:55:27,930
why wouldn't you do it?
Fuck it.

1348
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:29,243
They work.
There's a reason why you didn't even 

1349
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:32,411
hesitate.
You Go,

1350
00:55:32,411 --> 00:55:33,990
why wouldn't you with a puzzled look on 
your face?

1351
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,650
Whenever someone tells me,
Whoa Boon,

1352
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:37,460
you know,
55 years of age,

1353
00:55:37,461 --> 00:55:39,060
really think it's a good idea to take 
steroids.

1354
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,650
Yes,
that's the perfect time.

1355
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,780
Yeah,
because you got alternative is dying.

1356
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:45,360
Well also you only have like 20 years 
left anyway.

1357
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,450
Like what are you going to do that?
That's true.

1358
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:51,920
What are you going to cut it back by?
Five 80.

1359
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:52,773
Oh my God.
Only have 15 years of looking like 

1360
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,690
fucking sylvester stallone in rocky 
four.

1361
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,693
Yeah.
You pulled up a picture of him and I 

1362
00:55:59,421 --> 00:56:00,100
said,
that's.

1363
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,590
I said,
that's got to be from 30 years ago.

1364
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:02,010
You're like,
no,

1365
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:04,240
from last Wednesday.
He's 70 years old.

1366
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:05,820
Oh,
100 percent.

1367
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,340
How does he not find me?
The doctor.

1368
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:10,200
I'll pay fucking good money.
Get you a doctor.

1369
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:15,330
Testosterone and original rule.
The belly room.

1370
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,000
Cousin.
He was doing a set upstairs.

1371
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,280
I got a guy.
You gotta meet him with the darks.

1372
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,720
Do you have a fake mustache?

1373
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:25,250
Dr Benito Batch.

1374
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:26,543
Well,
testosterone replacement and hormone 

1375
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:30,610
replacement therapy is a.
there's a real science to it.

1376
00:56:30,611 --> 00:56:31,444
The idea is you don't take too much.
You take what you would have in your 

1377
00:56:33,701 --> 00:56:36,760
body if you were a younger man.
That's what you do and people are like,

1378
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:38,050
well,
you're not a younger man anymore.

1379
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,080
Duh,
like people just want you to wither away

1380
00:56:41,081 --> 00:56:42,880
and die.
So you have you jojo.

1381
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:43,803
I take testosterone replacement therapy 
and I've done it for almost 10 years 

1382
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,950
with 49.
Yeah.

1383
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:51,490
Thirty nine started when I was like 39,
37,

1384
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,740
38.
I start rubbing this cream on me.

1385
00:56:53,741 --> 00:56:55,870
Which wasn't that effective.
Was that the clear?

1386
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,370
No,
no.

1387
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:58,223
That's anything I take.
I take mild stuff like that or my dog 

1388
00:57:03,121 --> 00:57:03,954
and here's the thing about the stuff 
that like barry bonds takes and all the 

1389
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,430
bodybuilders take like they're taking 
like hyper human levels.

1390
00:57:09,431 --> 00:57:10,720
I don't fuck with anything like that.

1391
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:15,430
What I do is I take what I would have in
my body naturally when I was like 27.

1392
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,293
That's what I take so that that is 
healthy and that that does almost no 

1393
00:57:20,681 --> 00:57:22,990
evidence that there's evidence that if 
you have a bad heart,

1394
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:23,824
if you're an older person and you start 
jacking your body up with testosterone 

1395
00:57:25,921 --> 00:57:28,210
and doing crazy workouts,
your body's not ready for it,

1396
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,490
but also that could be a conditioning 
issue.

1397
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,620
There's a lot of factors involved in 
something like that.

1398
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:33,454
When,
when people go from being sedentary and 

1399
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:35,794
out of shape to all of a sudden having 
young levels of testosterone and then 

1400
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,001
get shocked.
Yeah.

1401
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:44,260
So that's when you factor in those 
situations with people that have um,

1402
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,233
like pretty significant heart issues 
after taking testosterone therapy 

1403
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,900
according to my doctor,
that's what they're dealing with these,

1404
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,790
he's like,
you can't,

1405
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:55,150
you have to judge each one of them on an
individual basis and he's also like,

1406
00:57:55,151 --> 00:57:55,984
you have to get your blood work done and
you have to be really meticulous about 

1407
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,400
it was I get my blood work done every 
couple of months,

1408
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,630
but not just for testosterone,
not just for her,

1409
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:05,231
but also,
yeah,

1410
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:05,950
for bad stuff.

1411
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,700
And also for nutrient levels.
I want to make sure,

1412
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,700
like I found out that I need more nice 
into my system.

1413
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:12,800
I found out I need more vitamin B,
Vitamin D,

1414
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,260
three.
D three is a big one.

1415
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:15,550
It's huge.
It's very important.

1416
00:58:15,551 --> 00:58:16,384
It's very important for um,
for a muscle is very important for the 

1417
00:58:19,511 --> 00:58:20,344
way your brain works.
It's also works in symbiosis with a 

1418
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:24,680
bunch of other nutrients.
You have to have your,

1419
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:27,000
your nutrient levels tested.
You can't just go on.

1420
00:58:27,001 --> 00:58:28,460
I feel pretty good.
You good?

1421
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:31,570
You might feel pretty good,
but there might be.

1422
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:34,560
There might be some fucking shortcomings
in your,

1423
00:58:34,561 --> 00:58:36,730
your diet or your,
your supplementation.

1424
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,793
I,
I,

1425
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,833
you know,
I,

1426
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,083
when I play,
I play ball up at Maine in college back 

1427
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:44,650
in the eighties and they were all 
juicing and I got a lot of teammates who

1428
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:47,680
are like a one guy who saw like a 
convalescent home.

1429
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,023
I mean they will fucking crazy with the 
shit he's in convalescent home now at 

1430
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:52,240
55.
He was at.

1431
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:53,770
He's,
Oh my God,

1432
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,190
fuck.
And another one.

1433
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:59,840
There's two other guys I know that have 
kidney problems from it and they will,

1434
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:00,813
they will muscular.
We were college age kids and they 

1435
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,050
fucking knit and they would just said,
you know,

1436
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:05,913
that's the whole line was if you want it
to be a pro athlete back then the 

1437
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:11,440
fucking Jose Canseco days,
you kinda had to.

1438
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:14,830
Those guys were all gorillas.
Even at Maine.

1439
00:59:14,831 --> 00:59:15,670
I go,
Holy Shit,

1440
00:59:15,671 --> 00:59:19,090
these guys were so mean.
The lineman and I loved them.

1441
00:59:19,091 --> 00:59:21,800
I hung out with them like when they were
not drinking and shit,

1442
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,350
but when they would get drunk and they 
go,

1443
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:25,184
this isn't main commands,
what goes on at University of Miami or 

1444
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:32,770
all these football factories you have.
Can you imagine one AA football?

1445
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:35,180
And I'm like,
this guy's a fucking crazy.

1446
00:59:35,181 --> 00:59:37,910
Well that's what gets you and I love him
to death and that's book.

1447
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:38,803
What gets us ahead in this sport were 
mean as far as like the shit we crack 

1448
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:42,134
jokes on.
Think about the shit that we say when 

1449
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:45,380
you and I get together,
we just start fucking around now.

1450
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:49,210
I do observational shit like David.
Brent noticed when a stock goes into the

1451
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:51,360
dryer,
it doesn't come out.

1452
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,540
When you breathe out,
where to go,

1453
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:59,250
where to go,
where that song.

1454
00:59:59,351 --> 01:00:01,280
Cool.
There's two songs now.

1455
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:02,114
There's one where to go.
Hicks used to remember you did a bit of 

1456
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:05,483
fun of Jerry somebody call balls.
When you think about how we talk when 

1457
01:00:10,461 --> 01:00:14,390
we're fucking really cool because for us
like that's what gets us ahead is saying

1458
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:16,580
shit that makes us go,
oh Jesus Christ.

1459
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,533
Like you'll say some things.
When you're around me that I'm sure you 

1460
01:00:18,801 --> 01:00:20,900
probably wouldn't say if you're around 
other people and I will do the same way.

1461
01:00:20,901 --> 01:00:21,980
You know,
that's my problem.

1462
01:00:21,981 --> 01:00:23,840
I say it everywhere.
That's how football players,

1463
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,430
that's why I'm in.
Yeah,

1464
01:00:25,431 --> 01:00:26,870
no,
I said you're right.

1465
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,160
Fighters like that.
Yeah.

1466
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,340
Fighters will like that.
It's the same way.

1467
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:32,383
I had a buddy of mine,
my friend Mike Blight from South Boston 

1468
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:35,053
and uh,
he was,

1469
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,180
he was very humble looking like he used 
to wear glasses and,

1470
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:41,300
but he's a psycho.
He's a psycho as they come and he wore.

1471
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:42,143
He's a very smart guy and he wore like a
golf shirt and he used to like a polo 

1472
01:00:46,341 --> 01:00:47,990
shirt.
So he looked like a fucking dork.

1473
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:50,450
He had his shirt tucked in,
his pants was belt the whole deal.

1474
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,090
And he worked at the rat.
You remember the rats?

1475
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:53,480
Yeah.
Yes.

1476
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:54,523
Well he was a bouncer there and people 
would give him a hard time because the 

1477
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:57,404
way he looked,
he was just waiting for someone to say 

1478
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:01,490
something stupid so he could rearrange 
their face.

1479
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,960
Just,
he's a pro boxer.

1480
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:03,823
He was always,
but he was almost setting them up by 

1481
01:01:05,031 --> 01:01:07,580
wearing the shirt and just setting them 
up like a trap.

1482
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:08,503
Like he was beat boy duck.
He was a straight up psycho and he 

1483
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,870
would,
he would,

1484
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,900
he wouldn't wait for someone to get out 
of line and do something to him,

1485
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,110
push him,
grab his shirt,

1486
01:01:18,111 --> 01:01:18,944
and then next thing they'll cook crack 
dudes or flatline and spasming going 

1487
01:01:22,491 --> 01:01:23,630
into seizures.
Yeah.

1488
01:01:23,631 --> 01:01:25,580
This kid,
this kid,

1489
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:26,700
Danny,
I won't say that,

1490
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,550
but for these guys are from the Cape.
They,

1491
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,573
you know,
they played football down in Cape in 

1492
01:01:31,281 --> 01:01:32,250
high school and they were friends.

1493
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,940
But this one guy Danny mcclung used to,
he was big fucking.

1494
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:38,270
He had these dead,
dead eyes,

1495
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:40,640
those,
those Pale blue eyes and you know,

1496
01:01:40,641 --> 01:01:41,540
they look sad.
You know,

1497
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:42,560
I'm in the like,
sag down.

1498
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,740
And uh,
when he got drunk,

1499
01:01:44,741 --> 01:01:49,730
I mean he was like fucking Clint 
Eastwood in unforgiven when he would get

1500
01:01:49,731 --> 01:01:50,564
drunk as well.
Your money where your money killer of 

1501
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,030
women and children.
We have two dogs and our fraternity,

1502
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,770
two little dogs,
a white woman.

1503
01:01:57,771 --> 01:01:59,240
I'm black.
He threw them in a punch bowl.

1504
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:00,323
Oh,
well that's really my white one was 

1505
01:02:01,911 --> 01:02:02,301
written.
No,

1506
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,134
he didn't hurt them,
but I'm just saying I thought you going 

1507
01:02:04,211 --> 01:02:06,950
to say wood chipper and and then he hits
that beating up men,

1508
01:02:06,951 --> 01:02:08,810
women,
whoever looked at him wrong.

1509
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:10,243
Yeah.
There's guys like and a few other 

1510
01:02:10,971 --> 01:02:12,410
lineman.
I shouldn't have singled him out.

1511
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:14,360
He was actually.
People feed off each other.

1512
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:15,194
That's why mob mentality is work.
The reason why the mob mentality exists 

1513
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:20,070
because someone sees someone doing 
something crazy

1514
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,023
and the other people get crazy too,
and here's the thing we need to 

1515
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:24,720
recognize right now that's going on like
uc Berkeley.

1516
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:26,840
That is mob mentality.
That doesn't.

1517
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,400
That's not justice.
It's not rational.

1518
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:30,323
It's not a real fucking protest.
That is a goddamn mob and they are 

1519
01:02:33,091 --> 01:02:36,120
rioting and they're wrong.
They're wrong because that guy,

1520
01:02:36,121 --> 01:02:36,954
all he wants to do is talk.
If someone wants to talk and which you 

1521
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:40,134
want to do is light the fucking campus 
on fire and throw a fucking chair 

1522
01:02:42,961 --> 01:02:44,670
through a plate glass window at 
starbucks.

1523
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:49,470
That is a mob mentality and it's the 
same goddamn thing and not only that,

1524
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,020
but all you're doing is pumping him up.
It's the streisand effect.

1525
01:02:53,021 --> 01:02:56,310
Do you keep him from fucking pro to keep
him from speaking?

1526
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,340
You make him bigger.
He's going to be even larger now because

1527
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:02,970
of that and you're just showing 
everybody what you're making.

1528
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,520
You lost the battle of ideas when you do
that.

1529
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:08,300
That's when it gets in the battle of 
ideas.

1530
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:10,413
That's what I'm saying.
This Nazi thing is fucking crazy where 

1531
01:03:12,481 --> 01:03:13,314
everybody calls everybody a Nazi.
We're talking about the Sarah Silverman 

1532
01:03:15,181 --> 01:03:17,760
thing before the podcast.
I don't know if she was joking around or

1533
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:20,520
not,
but she put on her twitter.

1534
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:21,383
Is this like a Nazi who doesn't know how
to make a swastika and everybody just 

1535
01:03:23,911 --> 01:03:24,744
tore apart because everybody wants to 
call everybody a Nazi today and those 

1536
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:31,200
symbols on the ground,
it's what people do when their surveyors

1537
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:34,560
and they want to mark where the power is
or the gas lines are.

1538
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:39,180
They have specific lines so that like 
it's specific colors for electricity,

1539
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:41,430
a different color for gas line and she's
like,

1540
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,480
oh look,
there's she can the swastika.

1541
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,430
Yeah.
Out of anything.

1542
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:46,530
It's like,
what the fuck is going on with everybody

1543
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:47,364
calling everybody?

1544
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,500
Well,
that's like an old ploy from the law.

1545
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:50,343
I'm 55.
I mean every republican that ever ran 

1546
01:03:52,231 --> 01:03:53,064
since I've been know was always a label 
that Nazi and they see that this is the 

1547
01:03:57,781 --> 01:04:01,860
line walking to get coffee.
Saw these Oliver Sidewalk and tournament

1548
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:05,130
is an attempt at Swastika,
goes to neo Nazis not have google.

1549
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,790
Just.
It's a combination of she's being silly.

1550
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:12,040
You should be instead of to them both.
You can take it either way.

1551
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,840
Okay.
It's a construction that Arthur innocent

1552
01:04:15,841 --> 01:04:19,170
mistake for a Jew.
That gut gets burnt in an oven.

1553
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:21,990
What?
At least weekly on twitter.

1554
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,020
Still pretty close though.
Oh No,

1555
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:26,873
it's the wrong way.
And an s with a line and it looks like 

1556
01:04:29,311 --> 01:04:32,040
Swanson's dinners every once in a minute
joke,

1557
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:35,310
a dyslexic to the dyslexic German kid.
Draw this,

1558
01:04:35,311 --> 01:04:36,030
uh,
you know,

1559
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:37,260
something of that.
Well,

1560
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,410
I don't know,
just she's got big innocent mistake.

1561
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,100
She says,
well,

1562
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,870
it's so when it gets burned into 
twitter,

1563
01:04:42,871 --> 01:04:46,710
so she's because of the shit that people
say to her on twitter.

1564
01:04:46,711 --> 01:04:50,030
She's saying that's why she's doing it.
She lost me on the,

1565
01:04:50,031 --> 01:04:50,880
uh,
the oven thing.

1566
01:04:50,881 --> 01:04:51,714
I think what she's trying to do is take 
some of the blame away from her for 

1567
01:04:54,541 --> 01:04:55,374
putting something ridiculous on twitter 
and by saying that people tell her to 

1568
01:04:57,481 --> 01:05:00,120
get an oven because she's a Jew and this
is why she's sensitive.

1569
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:03,180
Oh No.
This Nazi thing that everybody's saying,

1570
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:04,860
punch Nazis.
If you've seen this slightly,

1571
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:09,861
we should punch Nazis like campus Nazi.
Can anybody who doesn't think like who's

1572
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:14,040
anybody who doesn't think like a fucking
left these a Nazi.

1573
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,350
It's very crazy.
It's very,

1574
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,070
it's a very crazy thing we've got

1575
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,170
going on now because by calling someone 
a Nazi,

1576
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:22,570
you can immediately hit them.
Yeah.

1577
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:23,380
No,
it's,

1578
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:23,831
it's,
it's,

1579
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:24,664
it's way out of whack.
It's real weird way out of fucking 

1580
01:05:26,471 --> 01:05:28,030
whack.
I'm hoping it settles down,

1581
01:05:28,031 --> 01:05:28,864
but I don't think it's gonna.
I feel like this trump thing is just 

1582
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,950
going to ramp up because he keeps doing 
stupid shit.

1583
01:05:32,951 --> 01:05:35,380
Like the way he's disagreeing with the 
Supreme Court.

1584
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:36,910
See you in court.
What court?

1585
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,100
Which court?
They just,

1586
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:39,670
you were in court.
You just lost in court.

1587
01:05:39,671 --> 01:05:41,450
You won't see him in court again.
Like what?

1588
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,130
Go to the Supreme Court now.
Okay.

1589
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:47,160
See you in another court.
Yeah,

1590
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:49,390
I'm,
I'm undecided on that.

1591
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:51,810
I understand why he tweets because they,
you know,

1592
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:54,360
the fucking media is just ridiculously 
unfair to him.

1593
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:55,720
So,
but,

1594
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:57,650
but he does it too much.
Yeah.

1595
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,620
You know,
I mean wait for big things and,

1596
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:00,130
and yet.

1597
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:00,791
But you know.
Yeah.

1598
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:01,624
You don't have to be.
How do you feel like during unfair 

1599
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:02,741
there?
I'm like,

1600
01:06:02,741 --> 01:06:04,710
what do you think is unfair?
I know I shouldn't have said that.

1601
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:05,800
No,
I'm just asking.

1602
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:06,693
Just just hitting me.
Just give me a specific example about 

1603
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:10,930
them.
Like how so?

1604
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:12,280
Well,
what did I see this morning?

1605
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:15,400
Oh,
he had a meeting down at Mara Lago.

1606
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:19,120
He was down there as his place in 
Florida and they were talking about,

1607
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:20,013
uh,
I guess they were talking about Russia 

1608
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:21,544
at the table and the headlines on CNN.
He's discussing a military secrets and 

1609
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,000
in public,
you know,

1610
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:29,530
at my,
what's it called?

1611
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,750
Trump turns the lago club situation 
room.

1612
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:35,200
I mean,
everything he does,

1613
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:36,080
Joe,
he did,

1614
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,053
you know,
they usually get a new presidents get a 

1615
01:06:38,441 --> 01:06:41,180
fucking honeymoon.
This guy has been under attack.

1616
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,180
It's just ridiculous.
Well,

1617
01:06:43,181 --> 01:06:45,720
I mean everything he says they fucking 
go after him,

1618
01:06:45,721 --> 01:06:48,850
but don't think that he is also 
instigating a lot of this.

1619
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:50,950
But like when he pointed it from CNN and
said,

1620
01:06:50,951 --> 01:06:53,440
you're fake news.
That was refreshing to me.

1621
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:56,800
Well,
I had been saying that since 1988 before

1622
01:06:56,801 --> 01:06:58,240
I even follow politics.
I go,

1623
01:06:58,241 --> 01:07:01,480
does anybody watch this fucking network 
and see how fucking stupid it is?

1624
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,940
I mean,
they blatantly fucking left wing.

1625
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:05,400
Well,
they're blatantly leftwing.

1626
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:07,990
Fox is blatantly right.
When you switched back and forth,

1627
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:09,580
you don't get.
They get,

1628
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:10,443
you get both.
And I love having this dragon because 

1629
01:07:11,681 --> 01:07:12,850
everybody says that to me.
I go,

1630
01:07:12,851 --> 01:07:13,661
well,
do you watch fox?

1631
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:14,530
And I it not,
wouldn't,

1632
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,090
it's too stupid.
Then how the fuck do you know?

1633
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:19,150
You get both.
There's people at Fox who hate trump.

1634
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,610
I spend time over there.
I know.

1635
01:07:21,611 --> 01:07:25,090
Who is this that this guy's on during 
the day?

1636
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:27,370
A fucking shepard.
Smith fucking hates them.

1637
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,050
Um,
who else?

1638
01:07:29,051 --> 01:07:31,300
There's a woman who has Smith's,
an interesting character.

1639
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:33,340
Does he admit he's gay?
Uh,

1640
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:35,020
I keep telling him,
but he won't admit it.

1641
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:37,330
He looked beautiful.
He attacked me if I was gay,

1642
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,193
what?
He attacked me and him and judging the 

1643
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,393
is like a real,
real innocent for what Nikki didn't 

1644
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:45,700
provoke that did in the judge did it?
Yeah.

1645
01:07:45,701 --> 01:07:49,510
Like pilot fan.
He wants to come on the podcast.

1646
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,870
I've got to get that guy on.
We were talking about what a bad ass is.

1647
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,173
The uh,
the Strat is something called the 

1648
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:57,640
strategy room.
He has a goal set us up.

1649
01:07:57,641 --> 01:07:59,440
No,
it was a streaming show on Fox.

1650
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:01,450
What did you do wrong?
I showed up,

1651
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,373
be honest,
and we're talking about the elections 

1652
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:04,774
and I go,
well,

1653
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,960
the fucking media was in the tank for 
Obama and Shepard Smith.

1654
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:11,720
I just met him.
He sitting there and they fucking double

1655
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:13,650
teamed me.
Huh?

1656
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,430
He goes,
it's so typical.

1657
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,380
You're the type of guy you could tell he
hated it.

1658
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:21,830
He must have known me from like tough 
crowd or whatever and my politics.

1659
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:24,420
You could tell it was something before I
met him that.

1660
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:26,090
Well,
whenever you have to blame every.

1661
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,410
Yeah,
you have to blame.

1662
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:28,540
You're the type of guy that has to play 
him.

1663
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:30,800
Everybody.
He went off like a fucking fight and for

1664
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:32,920
once in my life I sort of sat there 
like,

1665
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:33,863
like high,
like a mature because he was making an 

1666
01:08:36,201 --> 01:08:37,280
ass of himself.
Oh,

1667
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:38,120
so you let them?
Yeah.

1668
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:39,900
Wow.
Where'd you get that restraint?

1669
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:40,880
I don't know.
That day,

1670
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:42,890
that day was just there.
Just for that five minutes.

1671
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,920
I've never had it again.
Let's six.

1672
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,750
I was in the tank.
I was too lazy to fight back.

1673
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:48,910
No,
I was in a fog.

1674
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:49,803
I'm in the Fox building.
I was trying to show some respect where 

1675
01:08:51,261 --> 01:08:54,800
you could tell he has since asked me to 
come on his show.

1676
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,690
So if you haven't.
No,

1677
01:08:56,691 --> 01:08:57,620
I couldn't.
I was going,

1678
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,560
I was on the road or something he wanted
but,

1679
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:00,403
but,
but I don't punch shit against anybody 

1680
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:03,150
because um,
you know,

1681
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:06,200
I fly off the handle all the time,
but it came out of,

1682
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:09,530
I could tell he must've known my comedy 
and didn't like it,

1683
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:11,180
but it was homophobic or whatever the 
fuck.

1684
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:12,621
I mean,
yeah,

1685
01:09:12,621 --> 01:09:13,800
probably that,
you know what I mean.

1686
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:15,770
And so we went with the right wing 
thing.

1687
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:18,230
Yeah.
Well he said you have the type of person

1688
01:09:18,231 --> 01:09:20,800
as to blame people.
I didn't know what the fuck that meant.

1689
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,920
I'm a big fan of blaming people,
especially when you do something.

1690
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:26,350
Totally blame them.
That's how we show that to them.

1691
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,010
It's all good.
I'm stupid.

1692
01:09:28,011 --> 01:09:29,260
I know.
But uh,

1693
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,250
they learn if you don't blame them.
But yeah,

1694
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,980
I mean if they don't,
if you don't blame them,

1695
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:34,814
they just keep going.

1696
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,990
They go like people.
My mother always used to say to me,

1697
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:39,950
you don't let anything go.
And I go,

1698
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:40,784
I still don't at this age,
if an eight year old girl fucking gives 

1699
01:09:43,101 --> 01:09:45,050
me lip and I think she's wrong,
I'll tell her why.

1700
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:49,010
You know why it's a teaching moment that
once president so let them know.

1701
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,200
Otherwise they don't know.
It's a learning moment.

1702
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,230
I think of it like that.
Yeah.

1703
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:54,020
If you don't let them know,
you know what happens?

1704
01:09:54,021 --> 01:09:54,854
You get spoiled kings.
I mean that's what a spoiled kings 

1705
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:59,060
that's now my next cd.
That's a good idea.

1706
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,690
I mean that's what someone is when they,
they just,

1707
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:02,563
anyone can tell them anything.
I mean that's what you always say about 

1708
01:10:03,711 --> 01:10:04,544
like super rich celebrities.
You always hear that about people that 

1709
01:10:06,621 --> 01:10:07,454
are untouchable.
They don't speak to like when Meryl 

1710
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:12,860
Streep got in front of all those people 
and was given a speech,

1711
01:10:12,861 --> 01:10:15,320
you know,
and she was going off with that.

1712
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:16,183
That is someone that never has anyone 
talking to her and correcting her and 

1713
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:21,800
telling her how ridiculous.
Well that's like,

1714
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:23,780
that's 98 percent of Hollywood.
Exactly.

1715
01:10:23,781 --> 01:10:24,614
Yeah.
Especially really famous people like 

1716
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,553
when you get into that Tom Cruise realm 
where they just don't communicate with 

1717
01:10:30,411 --> 01:10:31,244
anybody.
Right.

1718
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:32,650
That's,
that's,

1719
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:35,330
that's not a good thing.
It's a good thing,

1720
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:37,020
you know,
one call you out on your shit.

1721
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:42,020
You mean fucking Tom Cruise's sous chef 
might not be Republican.

1722
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:43,423
Tom Cruise sous chef was from fucking 
planet feet and for sure I learned that 

1723
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:50,210
from Leah Remini.
Everybody around.

1724
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:52,550
That guy's a scientologist.
Everyone you know.

1725
01:10:52,551 --> 01:10:54,950
I didn't know that.
Giovanni Ribisi is a scientologist,

1726
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,680
so now I see that ad for his new show.
I'm like looking at crazy.

1727
01:10:57,681 --> 01:10:58,431
Fuck.
Who is that?

1728
01:10:58,431 --> 01:11:00,090
I said no,
that Giovanni Ribisi.

1729
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:03,140
He's been in a shitload of movies.
Very good actor,

1730
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:07,670
but he's in the Irish Amazon things.
Sneaky Pete.

1731
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:09,020
There he is.
That guy.

1732
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:11,240
Scientology as fuck.
Look at.

1733
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,090
Look at that mustache.
That looks that one though.

1734
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:15,013
Yeah,
look at that.

1735
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:20,090
That's a look.
What the Hell [inaudible] ladies imagine

1736
01:11:20,221 --> 01:11:21,960
that look.
Chilling down on your box.

1737
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,760
A.
Yeah.

1738
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:28,450
He's a scientologist.
He looks at it says,

1739
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:31,380
it is amazing that there's still people 
in that amazing.

1740
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,750
There's only 10,000
people according to Leah Remini,

1741
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,600
how many edits worldwide,
how many edits?

1742
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:37,970
Oh fuck,
fuck.

1743
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:38,650
Load.
Yeah.

1744
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:40,260
Yeah.
They have so much money though.

1745
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:43,440
What's incredible is those people have 
donated so much money.

1746
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:46,170
They like the number two real estate 
holders in Los Angeles.

1747
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:49,370
They're all over the place.
They're like starbucks.

1748
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:54,440
A lot of cash they ever miscavige.
They're a good group to have behind you.

1749
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:55,850
If they're behind you.
Look,

1750
01:11:55,851 --> 01:11:56,684
if you're a scientologist and you're 
also like an actor or something like 

1751
01:11:58,321 --> 01:12:01,120
that,
they'll fucking insulate you again.

1752
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,150
That's what I wanted to ask her if I 
haven't met her.

1753
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,610
Because you had a lot of success while 
you were doing that,

1754
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,730
like in your profession as an accurate.
Did you attribute it to.

1755
01:12:08,731 --> 01:12:10,260
Do you think scientology help you?

1756
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,410
She definitely did at one point in time.
Yeah.

1757
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:15,690
I think what you think about the work 
that's involved,

1758
01:12:15,691 --> 01:12:16,524
like she was telling me that everyday 
they'd have to do two and a half hours 

1759
01:12:18,631 --> 01:12:19,464
where the work every day you're 
constantly working on it and constantly 

1760
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,330
like reading the stuff and going over 
things.

1761
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:28,320
I think anytime you have that kind of 
discipline that translates over to other

1762
01:12:28,321 --> 01:12:31,530
things like people ask me like,
how can you like,

1763
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:32,364
why do you have so much discipline?
Like with comedy or with all the like 

1764
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,110
how much you work so hard because I had 
to do with fighting.

1765
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,153
With fight.
If you don't have discipline with 

1766
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:39,930
fighting,
you get fucked up.

1767
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,680
That's just the way it is.
You get your good sports are very good.

1768
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:46,560
Kids guns,
good to lose.

1769
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:48,030
We don't want to have chem class.
It's unfair.

1770
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:49,350
Shut the fuck up if you don't.

1771
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:50,670
I know a comic,
I won't say his name,

1772
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:54,060
but he's been pretty open about it,
about one of the reasons why he's fucked

1773
01:12:54,061 --> 01:12:54,894
up as an adult because his parents 
didn't encourage him to do anything 

1774
01:12:57,121 --> 01:12:59,240
competitive when he was young,
so he didn't learn to live.

1775
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:02,010
Mark Marin,
you didn't learn how to lose.

1776
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,670
Yeah.
That seems like that seems like half the

1777
01:13:05,671 --> 01:13:07,380
fucking Democrats now.
Yeah.

1778
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:09,210
You got a freaking out that trump won.
I'm like,

1779
01:13:09,211 --> 01:13:11,850
did any of these people play sports 
seriously?

1780
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:14,790
I think there's a lot of people that are
freaking out that trump won because this

1781
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:16,260
guy is,
first of all,

1782
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:17,830
he's not using the secrets where it was 
used.

1783
01:13:17,831 --> 01:13:18,664
His own security people is tweeting 
bigger problems and it's got a black 

1784
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:21,991
guy.
Oh,

1785
01:13:21,991 --> 01:13:24,930
he's got a android phone that someone 
could easily hack into.

1786
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:26,940
He's,
he's a maniac.

1787
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:28,463
He's basically running things his way.
Like he does a business and you got 

1788
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:35,430
abandoned all of the visitor.
It's not really a corporation.

1789
01:13:35,431 --> 01:13:37,380
That's all I've been hearing from the 
left since I was 10 years old.

1790
01:13:37,381 --> 01:13:39,600
Now you get a businessman.
They rapidly.

1791
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,480
You're eating wood over there.
He's gone crazy fever.

1792
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:49,260
This coffee stirrers drank caveman 
coffee,

1793
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,290
fucking the homeless,
homeless.

1794
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:53,780
This and I got to get on the plane in a 
couple hours.

1795
01:13:53,781 --> 01:13:57,420
I'm going to be shitting blood.
You say you're going to be very creative

1796
01:13:57,421 --> 01:13:59,100
on that plane.
I hope you brought a laptop.

1797
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:03,180
You're going to have some thoughts.
I have a coloring book and uh,

1798
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,760
what else am rushack prints from my 
childhood?

1799
01:14:05,761 --> 01:14:08,070
You could write in your phone.
I got to get a new mug.

1800
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:08,904
A take that tip my hat with you,
I'll give you a pen and you generate 

1801
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:12,280
some great jokes

1802
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,940
all the way home.
Do you know,

1803
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:16,300
you mentioned that earlier you write 
when you're fucking high,

1804
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:17,200
right?
All the time.

1805
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:18,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

1806
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:21,190
Almost sober.
I write sober.

1807
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:23,440
I do everything sober and high.
They do both.

1808
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:27,610
I take a couple excedrin pm before I 
write and that's why I've slowed down as

1809
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:29,130
far as productive now.
Um,

1810
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:30,130
you,
you fucking.

1811
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,810
Yeah.
Well I think,

1812
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:32,653
uh,
I gotta believe Steven Wright used to 

1813
01:14:34,031 --> 01:14:34,960
write like that,
right?

1814
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,140
I don't think he did.
No,

1815
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:38,480
I think he's just a really bright guy.
You know,

1816
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,290
Stephen writes stuff is almost like too 
obscure to right when you're high.

1817
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:48,510
Used to work in a fire hydrant plant.
Couldn't park anywhere near the place.

1818
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,450
That kind of stuff.
He,

1819
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:53,293
he,
me and him hung out for a week doing 

1820
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:56,410
horace and Pete.
Louisa.

1821
01:14:56,411 --> 01:14:57,700
Oh yeah.
Thing he did.

1822
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:58,743
Uh,
so me and steven became like asshole 

1823
01:14:59,891 --> 01:15:00,724
buddies for that week out of my mouth.
He'd be puking belly laughing it insane 

1824
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,950
here.
And,

1825
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:05,863
and then Louie had ellen all the same,
all this racist shit as this racist old 

1826
01:15:09,791 --> 01:15:12,680
bartender.
I mean dropping the n bomb and shit.

1827
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,160
Did you ever see,
I never saw horace and Pete,

1828
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:18,100
is it only online on Lewis website or is
it somewhere else?

1829
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:18,910
No,
I don't.

1830
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:20,120
That's a great question.
It's got to be,

1831
01:15:20,121 --> 01:15:20,954
it's going to end up.
I got a blade has got end up on Netflix 

1832
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:24,700
when I felt like,
I felt like I'm just gonna wait.

1833
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:26,170
But he had,
he had,

1834
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:27,940
uh,
he had a woman,

1835
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:32,560
one of the characters had tourette's and
she'd yell out like,

1836
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:34,700
fucking Edward and shit now fucking,
you know.

1837
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:37,330
And I can't even say it even on your 
podcast,

1838
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:39,370
but me and steven would look at each 
other,

1839
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:40,204
you know,
he'd be sitting here at the end of the 

1840
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:44,620
bar and I'd see his shoulders because 
Alan Alda,

1841
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:47,620
the Edward Halk IPF is like being this 
racist and low.

1842
01:15:47,621 --> 01:15:48,454
He had this girl that was supposed to 
have tourette's in the show saying the 

1843
01:15:50,771 --> 01:15:51,604
most heinous shit you have ever heard.
And me and steven comics within comics 

1844
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:57,040
that whole life.
So you think it'd be jaded at that,

1845
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:59,320
but only low he could come up with shit.
So outrageous.

1846
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,990
But to see it coming out of hock ips is 
molly.

1847
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:05,350
I'm liberal from the west side was 
making me hard.

1848
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:06,573
That's hilarious.
And Steven was crying it put his head 

1849
01:16:08,381 --> 01:16:08,820
down,
you know,

1850
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:11,170
they would.
Dad Is fucking hilarious.

1851
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,173
What did he do?
Horace and Pete with like real people 

1852
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:18,460
and then animated over the real peoples 
and how he did it.

1853
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:19,950
No,
he shot it.

1854
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,570
He shot it like a,
a play.

1855
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,620
So it's not an animated.
No,

1856
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:25,650
no,
no.

1857
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,120
There was an animation.
So please watch it.

1858
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,490
I love it.
This is how low he described that one of

1859
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:32,680
the interviews because it's like really 
dark and kind of.

1860
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:34,860
He goes,
it's kind of depressing and shit.

1861
01:16:34,861 --> 01:16:36,700
He goes,
it's like the show cheers.

1862
01:16:36,701 --> 01:16:41,701
If everybody had cancer around the bar,
you will.

1863
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,000
You'll lead it up.
Okay.

1864
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,500
First of all,
from the same hometown,

1865
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:45,334
right?
Is Louis?

1866
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,680
Yeah.
You'll fucking eat it up.

1867
01:16:47,681 --> 01:16:48,340
It's,
it's.

1868
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,930
I think it's the best shit he's ever 
done.

1869
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:51,730
He said,
whoa.

1870
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,860
Why didn't he let go broke making it?
He,

1871
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,753
well he wouldn't really know exactly.
Emptied is whatever you have laying 

1872
01:16:57,611 --> 01:16:59,650
around.
He went on stern to explain these people

1873
01:16:59,651 --> 01:17:03,190
going broke and he went on Sterno one of
these radio shows that he went,

1874
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:04,000
oh,
I didn't go.

1875
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:04,833
He goes,
every every production company when 

1876
01:17:06,281 --> 01:17:07,870
they're doing a production is in the 
red.

1877
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:08,853
He goes,
I'll go tour for three months and I'll 

1878
01:17:09,771 --> 01:17:11,210
make my money back.
But he.

1879
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:12,830
Yeah.
He spent a ton of his own money.

1880
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:15,100
Yeah,
that's what I so ballsy of him.

1881
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:16,770
It's so funny when people say that,
like Louis C,

1882
01:17:16,771 --> 01:17:17,604
k.broker,
the Lucy does one show and he's not 

1883
01:17:19,251 --> 01:17:20,450
broke anymore.
Do you understand that?

1884
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:23,390
Because you Madison Square Garden and 
make more than you do in 10 years.

1885
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,340
When I'm tired.
He just wanted hour.

1886
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,220
He makes like years and years of salary.
Like stop.

1887
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,150
He's not broke.
No,

1888
01:17:29,151 --> 01:17:29,984
exactly.
Yeah.

1889
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:31,970
You'll eat the shit up.
I'm telling you.

1890
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:35,690
I'm sure at one thing he's ever done 
that I don't like.

1891
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:36,670
He is so he,
he,

1892
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:37,401
he,
he goes,

1893
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:39,860
come over to my house.
This was before he did horace and Pete.

1894
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,300
I saw him at the comedy cellar,
he goes,

1895
01:17:41,301 --> 01:17:42,134
give me a ride home.

1896
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,190
So he goes,
come in,

1897
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,720
and he showed that I'm working on the.
He goes,

1898
01:17:44,721 --> 01:17:47,000
read this,
and I read some fucking shit.

1899
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:49,760
And then I know a week later he goes,
come to my house tomorrow for lunch.

1900
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:50,591
I,
I fucked.

1901
01:17:50,591 --> 01:17:52,760
I rang the doorbell.
Alan Alda opens the door.

1902
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:53,540
I'm like,
what the fuck?

1903
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:56,150
Where does he live?
A exactly.

1904
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,770
He said,
give us extra address.

1905
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:01,580
He's a to 11 bleecker street,
apartment three C,

1906
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,140
fourth floor.
Got a red door.

1907
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:04,660
Dong.
He's,

1908
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:06,400
yeah,
he lives out in,

1909
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,420
within a half mile the comedy cellar 
somewhere here.

1910
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:11,980
And he just bought another thing.
So He's,

1911
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:12,843
he's got a lot of moves around.
But I saw Alan all the answers that 

1912
01:18:15,131 --> 01:18:16,490
door.
I uh,

1913
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:17,690
I,
I go in the kitchen.

1914
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:20,750
Steve is Jamie's in the kitchen.
I'm making all these.

1915
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,190
Uh,
and then,

1916
01:18:22,191 --> 01:18:23,024
uh,
you know who ed?

1917
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:23,923
Ed Falco rings the doorbell like five 
minutes later and was sitting there 

1918
01:18:25,971 --> 01:18:27,110
reading this current nanny show.

1919
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:29,240
Huh?
What did the nurse and nurse,

1920
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,910
Jackie,
she got Kinda mad at me because I go,

1921
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,020
I went up there.
I said,

1922
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,940
I go,
you are one of the best actors I've,

1923
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:35,630
uh,
you know,

1924
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:37,190
I got.
I'm still hung up on the car.

1925
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,480
I go,
I still watched the sopranos,

1926
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:39,800
like on a loop.
And she goes,

1927
01:18:39,801 --> 01:18:40,634
that's too bad.
And she like walked away I think 

1928
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:42,441
because,
you know,

1929
01:18:42,441 --> 01:18:44,030
actors,
famous people that if you don't know the

1930
01:18:44,031 --> 01:18:45,920
latest work,
they get kind of bent out of shape.

1931
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:46,813
Oh really?
She hadn't bent out of shape a little 

1932
01:18:48,201 --> 01:18:49,700
bit.
That's how I read it.

1933
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:50,960
Just takes herself seriously.

1934
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:54,173
Just like this fucking asshole.
I saw Shepard Smith tell you a new 

1935
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:56,870
asshole.
She loved me.

1936
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:57,770
No,
she was,

1937
01:18:57,770 --> 01:19:02,540
she loved me.
She was working with Ferrara.

1938
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:05,190
Ferrara was on that nurse.
Jackie and she,

1939
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,440
she's a,
she was great.

1940
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:09,500
I had a little line or two with her.
She was a bartender,

1941
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:12,170
but you gotta watch it just to see the 
woman with Tourette's.

1942
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,590
She'll be right in the middle of like a 
serious conversation.

1943
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,770
Look my buzzer.
You fucking asshole.

1944
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:16,723
Whoa.
And I look over at Steven Wright and 

1945
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:19,610
he's trying to put his head down and I 
supposed to be.

1946
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:22,370
And then Louie Louie would be behind the
bar,

1947
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,233
right.
In some scenes he'd be bartending and 

1948
01:19:25,071 --> 01:19:25,904
like Ed fail.
Colby having a chat with some other 

1949
01:19:27,651 --> 01:19:28,484
actors in the scene.
He'd come over to meet and like had a 

1950
01:19:30,471 --> 01:19:32,570
little piece of paper had drawn shit 
like a big Dick.

1951
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:38,500
I mean he is God.
He hands me.

1952
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:43,040
He hands me a note and it says we used 
to do the knotty pine for $75.

1953
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:45,530
Do you remember that Gig?
And Quincy called the knotty pine.

1954
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:46,700
Yeah,
I do remember that.

1955
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:48,220
Good.
He hands me that and I,

1956
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:49,340
I,
I turned it off.

1957
01:19:49,341 --> 01:19:50,031
I wrote back,
I go,

1958
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:54,590
I'm doing it next week.
One hundred 25 Gig.

1959
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,450
Yes.
It was very casual.

1960
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:59,510
It was like a dance floor.
Those are the best.

1961
01:19:59,511 --> 01:20:01,490
Bring you onto the ball spinning.
And they'd go,

1962
01:20:01,491 --> 01:20:02,510
okay,
get off the dance.

1963
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:03,344
But we got a comedian coming up till you
get in a fistfight and one of those 

1964
01:20:05,331 --> 01:20:10,180
places I guess just to actual comedy 
clubs to actual comedy clubs.

1965
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:13,920
Giggles and Seattle and giggles and 
Boston.

1966
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,110
What should down anymore?
Right.

1967
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,033
That was like a real.
Wasn't it like a real Christian room or 

1968
01:20:18,871 --> 01:20:20,340
something like that?
You had to be clean.

1969
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:21,030
No,
no,

1970
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:23,410
fuck no.
He hit me in a headlock.

1971
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,260
You would've loved it.
Yeah.

1972
01:20:28,261 --> 01:20:29,610
Two,
two different incidents.

1973
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:33,000
And with my act I was talking about with
the woman who runs the club in Chicago.

1974
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:33,940
I go,
I've only been in like,

1975
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:36,210
I've only had two altercations.
And she goes,

1976
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:37,500
that's it with that fucking.
I go,

1977
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:38,360
exactly.
I go,

1978
01:20:38,361 --> 01:20:40,560
I'd and say that's pretty damn good.
That is pretty good.

1979
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,300
Um,
broke my hands in both though.

1980
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,140
I have hands punching people.
Jesus,

1981
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:47,790
you.
I mean they fucking punching back joke.

1982
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:50,130
Don't act like throw elbows.
Very difficult to break.

1983
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:51,960
Oh you have to teach me.
I'll show you.

1984
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:53,670
But I got the shoulders of 100 year old 
man.

1985
01:20:53,671 --> 01:20:54,504
You know,
didn't you have like you had serious 

1986
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:56,910
surgery,
reconstruction on both of them.

1987
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,880
Does it feel good now?
Do they feel they never bothered me.

1988
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:00,803
I went on to play.
I wasn't supposed to have the high 

1989
01:21:02,281 --> 01:21:02,490
school.

1990
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:05,790
The guy did them right up to high school
and they told me you shouldn't really go

1991
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:06,624
play.
And I went up to Maine and blade 

1992
01:21:07,381 --> 01:21:09,370
football and the guy did such a good 
job.

1993
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:11,340
I still remember his name,
lyle mchaley.

1994
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:14,010
He still gives speeches about that.
He's got to be in his seventies now.

1995
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,903
Wow.
And he did such a great job of putting 

1996
01:21:16,381 --> 01:21:17,214
my shoulders back together that I played
a couple years in college and they're 

1997
01:21:20,161 --> 01:21:21,000
fine and,
and,

1998
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:23,460
and I don't even have pain lake when I 
wake up at them.

1999
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:25,020
I'm sure that's going to change in her 
week.

2000
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,870
But uh,
well do you do exercises with them yet?

2001
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:28,261
Well,
I,

2002
01:21:28,261 --> 01:21:29,230
you know,
I,

2003
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:30,143
I work out,
but for exercises specifically for 

2004
01:21:32,371 --> 01:21:34,470
shoulders,
I just start now and within the last few

2005
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,303
years because I had shoulder injuries,
but one of the best ones ever is 

2006
01:21:37,741 --> 01:21:39,460
kettlebells.
Well,

2007
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,520
kettlebells,
I think you showed me,

2008
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:44,820
I don't think I showed you this because 
I've recently gotten into what the fuck?

2009
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:45,890
That 120 pounds.
No,

2010
01:21:45,891 --> 01:21:47,910
there's only 40 pounds.
But you do bottoms up,

2011
01:21:47,911 --> 01:21:50,200
meaning you hold it like this.
So you have to balance it.

2012
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:55,020
Stabilization Muscles.
Oh yeah.

2013
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,220
Constantly adjusting and move.
And then that lands on your nose.

2014
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,900
No,
it's all good for your grip too.

2015
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:04,330
So you work on those and.
Well,

2016
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:05,700
you know,
it's good to say it for me.

2017
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,500
I used to laugh at people that use the 
uh,

2018
01:22:07,501 --> 01:22:09,420
you know,
what those meetings,

2019
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:11,280
those flies.
Yeah,

2020
01:22:11,281 --> 01:22:12,330
those are good.
Those are good.

2021
01:22:12,331 --> 01:22:13,620
It's good for you.
You know what I mean?

2022
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:14,603
Yeah.
I never used to do specific shoulder 

2023
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:17,760
exercises.
I did everything in the shoulders.

2024
01:22:17,761 --> 01:22:19,410
Got worked well.
I was doing all those things,

2025
01:22:19,411 --> 01:22:20,244
but I never did specific shoulder 
exercises until I had a shoulder 

2026
01:22:22,831 --> 01:22:23,920
industry.
Yeah.

2027
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:26,460
Then I started doing a lot of rotation 
exercises,

2028
01:22:26,461 --> 01:22:29,180
all these different things to build up 
the rotator cuff and stuff.

2029
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:31,560
So right after the surgery I did a ton 
of it.

2030
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:33,060
Yeah.
You got to do all that stuff.

2031
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:34,290
This guy was so good.
Lyle,

2032
01:22:34,291 --> 01:22:36,360
mckayla.
I went to a doctor a couple of years ago

2033
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:37,223
in New York in Westchester county where 
I live because I was having problems 

2034
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:42,180
with my road and he goes,
boy,

2035
01:22:42,181 --> 01:22:44,210
what's with the scars?
I go ahead,

2036
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:45,053
uh,
something called a bankart procedure 

2037
01:22:46,051 --> 01:22:49,020
back in the eighties and he and uh,
I go,

2038
01:22:49,021 --> 01:22:50,700
a guy named lyle mckayla did.
He goes,

2039
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,810
I'll be damned.
He goes,

2040
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:53,250
I went to a convention.
I've been harvard.

2041
01:22:53,251 --> 01:22:56,710
Dad talked his convention.
He was speaking about shoulder injuries,

2042
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:01,080
angry at sky back then.
And uh,

2043
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:04,080
God bless my parents to find like a 
decent doctor and yeah,

2044
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,160
he did a fucking job.

2045
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:08,260
I can't.
Right after I had them done,

2046
01:23:08,261 --> 01:23:10,150
I couldn't bench heavy anymore and share
it,

2047
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:10,461
you know,
I mean,

2048
01:23:10,461 --> 01:23:13,360
you're stuck behind my neck is a lot of 
people don't believe in bench and heavy.

2049
01:23:13,361 --> 01:23:14,194
Anyway.
Gretchen heavy just fucks your 

2050
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:16,480
shoulders.
That's,

2051
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:19,110
that's how I originally fuck them up.
Yeah.

2052
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:19,983
Especially back in the eighties,
nobody knew about warming up and 

2053
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:22,720
stretching.
I was like,

2054
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:26,170
benching with alignment.
And what happens is you're still growing

2055
01:23:26,171 --> 01:23:27,004
at that point.
You were a big fuck when I first met 

2056
01:23:28,781 --> 01:23:30,130
you,
when I first met you,

2057
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,530
one of the,
it was very encouraging to me because,

2058
01:23:32,531 --> 01:23:33,364
uh,
I had always thought that to be a comic 

2059
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:38,620
you had to be out of shape and goofy 
looking and I always felt they hate us.

2060
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:40,600
Yeah.
I felt like I didn't belong.

2061
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:43,420
And then Joe onstage killen and I was 
like,

2062
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:45,730
I want to be okay,
but you know what?

2063
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:48,790
They fucking still hit.
Nothing has changed.

2064
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:50,560
Well,
barren even admitted it to me.

2065
01:23:50,561 --> 01:23:52,560
Like when I did his podcast,
he was saying like,

2066
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:54,790
you shouldn't,
you shouldn't be doing this.

2067
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:55,900
This is our thing.
And I was like,

2068
01:23:55,901 --> 01:23:58,060
well that's crazy.
That was the mentality.

2069
01:23:58,150 --> 01:23:59,710
It's like,
what are you talking about?

2070
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:01,360
What does that got to do with being 
funny?

2071
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:03,610
I love this idea.
You have to have low self esteem,

2072
01:24:03,611 --> 01:24:05,380
shitty parents,
a shitty upbringing.

2073
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:06,573
You have to punch up.
I think it's funny when you punched 

2074
01:24:08,221 --> 01:24:10,390
down,
will that punch punching a little kid in

2075
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:11,224
the back of the head?
There's definitely things that are 

2076
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:13,280
funnier than that.
No,

2077
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:15,530
I don't have kids.
You're healthier punching,

2078
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:19,300
kill kids,
kids that deserve no Irish kids,

2079
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:23,620
but the punch and I had an argument with
a be canvas professor who's a,

2080
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,450
wrote a book on comedy.
Remember that guy?

2081
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,670
He just does his name.
He wrote a book on on Compton.

2082
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:30,340
He was like,
well,

2083
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,620
punching up is always was always 
funnier,

2084
01:24:32,621 --> 01:24:33,454
and I'm like,
okay,

2085
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,960
that's not true.
That's not true.

2086
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:35,883
Sam kinisons bit about starving kids in 
Africa is one of the greatest bits of 

2087
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:42,970
all time as punching down as you ever 
can get because it's so fucked up.

2088
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:43,953
You're listening to Eco Jesus.
I can't believe he's saying this and 

2089
01:24:46,001 --> 01:24:47,050
you're fucking crying.
Laughing.

2090
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,570
Funny is funny.
Well,

2091
01:24:48,571 --> 01:24:50,920
you acquainted,
you know like sports and comedy,

2092
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:52,390
like you said,
football and fighting.

2093
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,260
I want.
I'm going to fight.

2094
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,080
I throw up,
down sideways every day.

2095
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:56,951
Right?
And a lot of ways.

2096
01:24:56,951 --> 01:24:58,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

2097
01:24:58,090 --> 01:24:59,590
They come from punches come from 
everywhere.

2098
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:00,513
Exactly.
That's why this whole thing about 

2099
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:05,980
punching down so fucking stupid or the 
idea that you have to be a Dork in order

2100
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:06,640
to be funny.

2101
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,980
Some of the funniest people I ever met 
were savages.

2102
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:10,640
Like that's where I learned how to do 
comedy.

2103
01:25:10,641 --> 01:25:12,190
He was in the gym.
I know guys.

2104
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:14,620
That's the reason why I got into stand 
up in the first place.

2105
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:17,850
I would make people laugh when we were 
on a bus on the way that tournament.

2106
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:18,843
It was like gallows humor.
Everybody was scared and I would be the 

2107
01:25:21,731 --> 01:25:24,760
guy who is making everybody laugh.
There were all savages.

2108
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:27,070
Yeah.
Those guys are Tan with the linemen that

2109
01:25:27,071 --> 01:25:27,904
took the kids there.
There was some of the funniest 

2110
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:32,020
motherfuckers have ever met in my life 
and not dumb jock.

2111
01:25:32,021 --> 01:25:32,801
Funny.
They,

2112
01:25:32,801 --> 01:25:35,080
I mean they would actually come up with 
clever shit and.

2113
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:37,360
But uh,
yeah that was the mentality.

2114
01:25:37,361 --> 01:25:40,000
Like Kevin Flynn,
I remember good soccer player.

2115
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,760
Umass.
He was like a real good soccer,

2116
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:43,020
really good soccer player.
Right.

2117
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:43,571
And,
and,

2118
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:44,404
and,
uh,

2119
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:45,453
he used to talk about because him,
him and me came together at the Boston 

2120
01:25:48,371 --> 01:25:51,160
scene.
He was another one and they hated us.

2121
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:53,320
Jeannine,
I tell and I love fucking gene.

2122
01:25:53,321 --> 01:25:55,660
I still do.
The first night I met Janine,

2123
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:58,600
it was fucking like open mic.
Alright.

2124
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,330
I've been in the business about fucking 
eight months,

2125
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:02,380
10 months,
maybe it was that stitches.

2126
01:26:02,381 --> 01:26:04,040
I walk in sitting in the little

2127
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,730
box office,
she goes nice acid washed jeans and they

2128
01:26:07,731 --> 01:26:08,564
weren't,
they were faded,

2129
01:26:09,450 --> 01:26:11,350
who actually faded.
They were fair to.

2130
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:15,200
She goes nice acid washed jeans and I'd 
never met before.

2131
01:26:15,201 --> 01:26:15,910
I'd go.
Nice.

2132
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:18,530
I go nice boots where they going to 
clamming lady account.

2133
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:22,060
That's how I met Janeane Garofalo and 
it.

2134
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:25,010
And it didn't even phase her,
which made me like her number one.

2135
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,860
She didn't even fucking,
she kind of like smirked and,

2136
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:28,703
and then um,
and people even now my friends don't 

2137
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:33,250
believe that you.
How do you like her comedy?

2138
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,093
And I watched her,
it stitches going in after Steve 

2139
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:36,611
Sweeney,
you know,

2140
01:26:36,611 --> 01:26:39,760
the whole boys club.
And I did that young comedian specials.

2141
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:41,750
She always had her own point of view 
when Shit,

2142
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,520
you know,
it's not a,

2143
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:45,290
but my friends always never believed 
that.

2144
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:47,130
Uh,
I thought you liked that kind of thing.

2145
01:26:47,131 --> 01:26:47,870
She's funny.

2146
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:49,890
We used to play softball with her.
She used to.

2147
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,580
She used to be on the comedian softball 
thing.

2148
01:26:52,581 --> 01:26:54,980
I used to meet on Mondays were in New 
York.

2149
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,030
No,
Boston.

2150
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,830
Yeah,
Dave Cross was in it.

2151
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,160
Um,
there was a lot of people,

2152
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,950
some good athletes.
Janine,

2153
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:05,150
David Cross,
Brian Frazier.

2154
01:27:05,290 --> 01:27:06,330
You ever?
Brian Frazier.

2155
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:08,090
He was another one.
What happened to him?

2156
01:27:08,091 --> 01:27:09,710
Joe?
I think he's writing now.

2157
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:11,990
He was another one.
That guy was giant.

2158
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,480
He was fucking built like a brick shit 
house.

2159
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:15,673
One time he went on stage with a shirt 
on like a golf shirt after I got them 

2160
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:20,010
upstairs.
You Go,

2161
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:21,350
dude,
you can't dress like that.

2162
01:27:21,351 --> 01:27:21,621
I go,
look,

2163
01:27:21,621 --> 01:27:23,960
I'm your friend and I can't stop staring
at your arms.

2164
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:26,690
Like you can't.
You can't dress like that because he was

2165
01:27:26,691 --> 01:27:29,300
a bodybuilder at one point in time.
They got really big.

2166
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:31,190
Absolutely right.
And who else?

2167
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:32,210
There was another.
Oh,

2168
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:33,044
Brian Kylie.
Kylie was a gorilla and he's like a 

2169
01:27:36,591 --> 01:27:37,580
really cerebral,
right?

2170
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:38,450
Yeah.
So yeah,

2171
01:27:38,451 --> 01:27:39,950
that whole myth of,
you know,

2172
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:43,370
they do resent yet and I still feel like
an outsider in this business.

2173
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:45,470
I still,
I got a couple friends,

2174
01:27:45,471 --> 01:27:47,660
you know,
fucking putting an outsider at all.

2175
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:50,720
Well,
you know Colin Quinn is like,

2176
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,010
you know,
we're on the phone every night.

2177
01:27:53,011 --> 01:27:55,970
He's probably my closest and Louis,
but they're not.

2178
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:56,833
I don't have much in common with them 
outside of outside of the shell 

2179
01:27:59,451 --> 01:28:01,190
business.
Well you can't go to the UCB.

2180
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:03,223
I have just to ruin the night,
go in and I blow it up and I go follow 

2181
01:28:06,261 --> 01:28:07,094
that.
Go fuck another mediocre story with two 

2182
01:28:08,681 --> 01:28:11,880
punch lines every 30 minutes.
Well go there and not get paid to.

2183
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:12,773
I'm about that stupid fucks.
The that allowed these people to create 

2184
01:28:16,641 --> 01:28:18,740
an empire with not paying millions.

2185
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:19,603
That is so disgusting.
This Duncan trussell had a whole bit 

2186
01:28:22,161 --> 01:28:23,950
about it.
Like it's like,

2187
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:24,823
what have you done?
Like you've decided to do this one 

2188
01:28:27,471 --> 01:28:29,960
thing,
this one place where the cerebral people

2189
01:28:29,961 --> 01:28:31,040
go,
you make all the money.

2190
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:32,570
That's not very cerebral.
Right?

2191
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:34,880
That seems pretty fucking stupid.
How'd they do that?

2192
01:28:34,881 --> 01:28:36,290
How do they get away with that?
I don't know.

2193
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:38,390
I don't understand it.
People.

2194
01:28:38,391 --> 01:28:41,300
There's always people who want to be in 
the arts.

2195
01:28:41,301 --> 01:28:42,770
They will fucking work,
but nothing and.

2196
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:45,920
Yeah,
and they also want to be in the inside.

2197
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:47,380
They want to be on the inside.
Yeah.

2198
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:49,560
I never felt that way.
They want to be in the clinic,

2199
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:53,600
got to go there to click like a,
like Patton Oswald,

2200
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:55,250
who I've,
you know,

2201
01:28:55,251 --> 01:28:56,084
he came on tough crowd and um,
he almost insinuated that I was like a 

2202
01:29:00,321 --> 01:29:01,890
Dick joke specialism in

2203
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,800
even calling.
We like fucking what we,

2204
01:29:04,801 --> 01:29:06,650
you know that your addiction 
specialists.

2205
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:09,480
Yeah.
I made a joke on that episode,

2206
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:10,343
a Black Dick joke or something and he 
kind of implied that's what I do is 

2207
01:29:12,661 --> 01:29:15,990
something like me and turned on him and 
uh,

2208
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:17,120
and I'm like,
Eh,

2209
01:29:17,121 --> 01:29:17,954
I never,
I always thought he's kind of overrated 

2210
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:20,334
as a stamp,
but I've really grown to love his stand 

2211
01:29:22,141 --> 01:29:23,070
out or stand ups.
Very good.

2212
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:23,791
Yeah.
He's um,

2213
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:26,730
he's a great guy but he's a nerdy who we
have nothing in common.

2214
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,240
And sometimes when I like people like 
that,

2215
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:31,283
they don't necessarily,
I think via like more the so called 

2216
01:29:34,111 --> 01:29:36,270
tolerant crowd is a lot less tolerant 
than I am.

2217
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:39,420
It's true.
It is true that you mean tower people,

2218
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:41,400
would they consider themselves to be 
progressive?

2219
01:29:41,401 --> 01:29:44,580
People are oftentimes very intelligent.
Not Actually.

2220
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:47,130
He's a good dude.
I hit him up on twitter and you know,

2221
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:49,800
and the so,
you know,

2222
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,900
actually,
but um,

2223
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:52,391
yeah,
I,

2224
01:29:52,391 --> 01:29:54,370
I still feel I,
I,

2225
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,010
I don't watch movies.

2226
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:58,240
I hate what the political correctness,
which I haven't,

2227
01:29:58,250 --> 01:29:59,820
you know,
Big Bang theory and shit.

2228
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:01,410
Like what am I doing?
You know,

2229
01:30:01,411 --> 01:30:03,480
his wife died from that fucking fentanyl
shit.

2230
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:07,940
She's another the.
Is that what caused her that?

2231
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,440
God Damn Fentanyl,
the same shit that killed prince,

2232
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:14,310
same shit that killed a buddy of mine 
was the autumn season.

2233
01:30:14,311 --> 01:30:15,180
Yes,
yes.

2234
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:16,093
Yeah.
It was a combination of things with 

2235
01:30:16,761 --> 01:30:18,970
fentanyl was in the mix because he said 
no,

2236
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:19,823
not too long ago.
He said he thought it was like an 

2237
01:30:22,081 --> 01:30:23,370
accidental overdose.
Right.

2238
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:24,833
Fucking horrible man.
Fentanyl is supposedly hundreds of 

2239
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:28,770
times,
hundreds of thousands of times stronger.

2240
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:29,604
Someone was explaining it the other day.
It's stronger than opiod than regular 

2241
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:34,270
opiods.
Yeah.

2242
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:37,150
It was a horse sterilizer,
a horse tranquilizer rather than.

2243
01:30:37,151 --> 01:30:38,580
That's not good.
Yeah,

2244
01:30:38,581 --> 01:30:40,410
it's fucking terrifying.
Terrifying Shit.

2245
01:30:40,411 --> 01:30:41,244
That stuff they decided that uh,
oxycontins are killing people quick 

2246
01:30:43,501 --> 01:30:44,334
enough so they,
they came up with this stuff and if you 

2247
01:30:45,511 --> 01:30:47,760
fuck up one way or the other with that 
fentanyl,

2248
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:51,540
just a slight overdose.
I'm a puss or drugs.

2249
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:53,760
I'm a put that.
Fentanyl Shit is terrifying.

2250
01:30:53,761 --> 01:30:56,580
It's killing people like crazy.
But you like your mushrooms and share,

2251
01:30:56,581 --> 01:30:57,680
right?
You stuff's.

2252
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:01,700
I would never do that in a trillion us.
Oh,

2253
01:31:01,701 --> 01:31:02,534
you should do it.

2254
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:05,310
Definitely do it.
It's good for.

2255
01:31:05,450 --> 01:31:08,040
And you kidding me.
I told you the oedipal story.

2256
01:31:08,210 --> 01:31:10,410
I might as well been doing.
Mushroom kills the ego.

2257
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:11,363
It's good for you.
It kills it for a long good to step 

2258
01:31:13,951 --> 01:31:15,810
outside yourself and see who you all my 
ego.

2259
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,510
I come back,
it'll come back.

2260
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:23,980
I'm just saying that like it gives you 
the street now.

2261
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:25,770
She'll go crazy.
She'll shit her pants.

2262
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,540
So yeah,
be terrible.

2263
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:29,750
She'd be like that bathtub girl here.
See the bathtub girl?

2264
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:32,730
No one in the Japanese lady with her 
asshole on the air.

2265
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:35,250
Shit spraying up in the air and hit her 
in the face.

2266
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:37,860
That was Margaret Cho's last specialists
that we've talking about.

2267
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:40,180
Come on

2268
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:42,280
guys.
Fucking La Faggots,

2269
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:49,900
safe bagging all

2270
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:52,050
the time and I will continue to say,
wow,

2271
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,570
I always call.
I said that on stage and then I,

2272
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,400
I've faggot.
I think low.

2273
01:31:56,401 --> 01:31:57,520
He actually had a bit about it,
but I,

2274
01:31:57,521 --> 01:32:00,010
I've called everybody but gay person a 
faggot.

2275
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,750
My brother and I'll fucking Louis don't 
get word.

2276
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:05,050
Yeah,
it's a good word.

2277
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,710
And I said that on the unmasked thing I 
did with Ron Bennington.

2278
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,190
He goes,
so you think that makes it right?

2279
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:10,024
And I go,
yeah.

2280
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,670
Ron Bennington was trying to progressive
you.

2281
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:15,070
How dare he girls show him,
love him.

2282
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,440
He's a good guy in my house.
Show isn't just whole.

2283
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,230
Ron Bennington's whole show is what?
Breaking down.

2284
01:32:20,630 --> 01:32:22,210
Silly.
Silly.

2285
01:32:22,211 --> 01:32:23,044
Uh,
is it rally hard to listen to them and 

2286
01:32:24,881 --> 01:32:25,840
it's a fun show.
I love him.

2287
01:32:25,841 --> 01:32:27,750
He's smart and funny.
I don't hear it anymore.

2288
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,650
I don't have serious anymore.
I stopped with the.

2289
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,510
You realized that because I'm going to 
do.

2290
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:34,230
I might get a show on there.
Well,

2291
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:37,380
I'll get it off bittorrent.
That sign I,

2292
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:41,160
I even know about that aren't just put 
it online.

2293
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:42,453
I'll get.
I just did.

2294
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:43,870
I think that car.

2295
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:46,030
What do you.
V Eight car and you go into a tunnel.

2296
01:32:46,031 --> 01:32:46,864
It doesn't work.
I've refused to support that Chris 

2297
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:51,340
Christie,
but I think it's fucking stupid.

2298
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:52,323
I think it's stupid.
I think satellite is stupid I think and 

2299
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:55,103
I think you live in the dark ages 
because I go through the time I go 

2300
01:32:58,291 --> 01:32:59,124
through the tunnels in New Jersey now 
you can listen to satellite radio 

2301
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:02,230
tunnel,
regular radio,

2302
01:33:02,231 --> 01:33:06,430
but not satellite radio.
They have ready radio signals.

2303
01:33:06,431 --> 01:33:08,880
They have transmitters in the title and 
have a little freak.

2304
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:10,150
Absolutely right.
Yeah.

2305
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:11,013
Satellite doesn't work.
No wonder if you could you try to get 

2306
01:33:12,941 --> 01:33:14,860
uh,
get the signal in La.

2307
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:17,050
You go under a bridge,
like an overpass.

2308
01:33:17,051 --> 01:33:18,370
It doesn't work.
Fuck you.

2309
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:20,530
So that means someone could be talking 
about some important shit.

2310
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:22,930
I have to stop traffic and I'd be like,
hold on.

2311
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:24,930
Did people beep?
And I'm like,

2312
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:25,840
I don't want to cut out.

2313
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,760
I see the red light.
I know I've done that.

2314
01:33:27,761 --> 01:33:28,594
I've pulled that.
I've been pulling into my garage and 

2315
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:30,874
I'll hear you on to somebody.
I like Louis or whatever and that 

2316
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:35,020
affects my back out of my garage.
That's what.

2317
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:36,310
No,
no,

2318
01:33:36,311 --> 01:33:38,470
I agree with you.
And commercials to.

2319
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:41,630
We're going to have strings on our roof 
that go directly to the transmitter.

2320
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:44,620
Far.
We have wired cars.

2321
01:33:44,621 --> 01:33:46,450
Will wires are criss crossing each 
other?

2322
01:33:46,451 --> 01:33:48,280
Well,
it's fucking stupid.

2323
01:33:48,281 --> 01:33:49,114
It's a stupid technology.
They won't take the job that was 

2324
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,210
internet.
The Internet is the way to go.

2325
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:56,410
Goddammit.
You went to other people have figured it

2326
01:33:56,411 --> 01:33:57,340
out.
That's not true.

2327
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:58,293
A lot of people figured it out.
Joey Diaz gets millions of downloads a 

2328
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:02,230
month now because he,
you know,

2329
01:34:02,231 --> 01:34:03,840
because of him because he's fucking 
funny.

2330
01:34:03,841 --> 01:34:05,800
You know?
I know he's funny.

2331
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:07,920
I'm just saying.
But you started them off for.

2332
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:09,890
You didn't have to do the same for you.
Neck.

2333
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:10,960
Well,
we can help you.

2334
01:34:10,961 --> 01:34:14,700
Come sit down.
Rub My back with Joe.

2335
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:15,543
Joey did.
He didn't seem like champagne with me 

2336
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:21,310
pulling this rope and make sure that I 
came out here.

2337
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:24,410
Seriously.
That's why I came up.

2338
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:25,930
Because when,
by the way,

2339
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:29,520
hit me up at Nick Depalo and twitter and
instagram and all that other shit.

2340
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:30,720
You people,
it's out fat.

2341
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:34,570
Oh my goodness.
Are you fucking children of the coin?

2342
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:36,220
It's on my twitter.
You can find them.

2343
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,380
Uh,
but um,

2344
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:40,480
no,
but when I last time I did the show.

2345
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:42,060
I did twice,
right?

2346
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,113
I go home before Christ.
By the time I get home I had like 500 

2347
01:34:45,011 --> 01:34:46,660
new followers,
like on twitter because I go,

2348
01:34:46,661 --> 01:34:49,060
what the fuck kind of rocket ship is he 
driving here?

2349
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:49,923
Well,
it's way crazier now because the last 

2350
01:34:50,621 --> 01:34:51,970
time you hear it was what?
A year ago.

2351
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:52,893
How long was it?
I,

2352
01:34:53,150 --> 01:34:54,790
I,
it's either a year or two.

2353
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:56,560
Jamie knows he's got it in a folder 
called,

2354
01:34:56,670 --> 01:34:57,503
but it is the number of downloads that 
we've had since then is like more than 

2355
01:35:01,971 --> 01:35:03,770
10 times.
And why is that Joe?

2356
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:05,270
I don't know.
Something's happened.

2357
01:35:05,271 --> 01:35:06,740
I think you're talented,
motherfucker.

2358
01:35:06,741 --> 01:35:08,330
Thanks Sweetie.
That's so nice.

2359
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:13,040
July last year.
July last year.

2360
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,500
Actually.
Twenty 15.

2361
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,353
Thank you.
Okay.

2362
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:20,150
I believe when the year came by,
I told you I was going to come out every

2363
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:20,983
year at least once a year time.
I was even thinking every six months or 

2364
01:35:23,191 --> 01:35:24,290
whatever,
they call me up.

2365
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:25,124
You can come anytime you want.
You told me that you all open the place 

2366
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:28,130
oil and uh,
but,

2367
01:35:28,131 --> 01:35:28,990
but here's the thing.
And,

2368
01:35:28,991 --> 01:35:29,824
and a year what came?
I'm a guy who I should be going out to 

2369
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:32,700
Joseph.
I couldn't get off the couch.

2370
01:35:32,701 --> 01:35:34,340
I go,
I can't fucking go to laguardia.

2371
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:36,800
Go through all that hard too hard out 
there.

2372
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:40,110
It's don't.
It is.

2373
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:41,421
But um,
no.

2374
01:35:41,421 --> 01:35:44,180
I'm just saying this show is like I was 
saying at the Queen on the phone,

2375
01:35:44,181 --> 01:35:44,750
I go,
I go,

2376
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:46,220
do you doing enrollments?
Punk guy.

2377
01:35:46,221 --> 01:35:48,340
It's like doing a TV show.
Somebody said,

2378
01:35:48,341 --> 01:35:49,360
are you going to do corn on a drill?

2379
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:52,220
I go into Joe's podcast.
I do know and I love Conan.

2380
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:54,420
I'm just Colin's.
He wouldn't sell me on it anyways.

2381
01:35:54,430 --> 01:35:55,161
He,
he doesn't like,

2382
01:35:55,161 --> 01:35:56,330
you know,
he loves me.

2383
01:35:56,331 --> 01:35:59,660
I'm just saying I wouldn't use social 
media.

2384
01:35:59,661 --> 01:36:00,740
I could have plugged that.
I guess.

2385
01:36:00,741 --> 01:36:01,574
You know what?
The problem is you won't shine on Conan 

2386
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:04,253
seven minutes,
the way you shine and a couple of hours 

2387
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,550
does a couple of hours things.
What's up?

2388
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:09,093
Yeah,
see he's pointing at me for people 

2389
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:11,700
listening.
Smiling cameras.

2390
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:12,913
Yeah,
but a lot of people were listening way 

2391
01:36:13,821 --> 01:36:16,070
more people who are listening and 
watching a four minute.

2392
01:36:16,071 --> 01:36:16,904
You're right.
A four minute interview on her as 

2393
01:36:18,441 --> 01:36:19,274
opposed to a Joe Rogan doing a.
I was supposed to do seth Myers last 

2394
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:25,820
week and it got canceled because of the 
snow storms.

2395
01:36:25,821 --> 01:36:26,654
My flight got canceled and I was going 
to do his show because I really like 

2396
01:36:28,161 --> 01:36:29,210
him.
I think he does a great job.

2397
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:30,650
He's funny.
He's an old lack of anymore.

2398
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:34,370
I used to fuck.
He's turning on lefty on lefty.

2399
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:36,440
What his first 10 minutes make the daily
show.

2400
01:36:36,441 --> 01:36:37,274
Looked like a Fox news channel,
but doesn't it make sense what he's 

2401
01:36:39,861 --> 01:36:40,694
saying?
Can't you see you're on team fucking 

2402
01:36:42,981 --> 01:36:44,690
Ryan.
I'm not an entity's.

2403
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,830
I'm different than you.
Oh yeah,

2404
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:46,760
I'm on team.
Right?

2405
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:49,780
You talking about the left?
I'm not.

2406
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:52,881
Okay.
Again,

2407
01:36:52,881 --> 01:36:54,650
that's one.
That's one issue.

2408
01:36:54,651 --> 01:36:56,720
How about that?
I'm just to hunt.

2409
01:36:56,810 --> 01:37:00,270
I cook roasts,
commentator,

2410
01:37:00,271 --> 01:37:03,990
so a hippie.
You do psychedelics and the but how am I

2411
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:05,540
in team?
Right?

2412
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,050
You definitely funny.
I.

2413
01:37:08,110 --> 01:37:12,230
I approached Goddammit job.
This was going so well.

2414
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:13,183
I'm fucking pro,
like I said in this business that 

2415
01:37:15,491 --> 01:37:18,250
consider me conservative,
but I fucking gate.

2416
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:23,290
No problem with gay marriage either side
of the keep don't put yet.

2417
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,333
I would like to watch an episode of 
chopped where it's not a girl with a 

2418
01:37:27,411 --> 01:37:30,640
crew cut and free reigns in on.
Knows what the hell is a network show?

2419
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:35,660
Jamie knows I'm talking about the guy 
from queer eye for the straight guy.

2420
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:36,680
What's his name?
Ted Allen.

2421
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:38,690
It's called chopped.
Is it all about salads?

2422
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:40,670
No,
they get baskets at the beginning.

2423
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:41,533
It's actually,
it was actually a good show for about a 

2424
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:47,570
month until it became like a gay cause 
of every episode.

2425
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:51,060
Is a transgender guy going,
I'm going to take the $10,000,

2426
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:53,870
get myself a pussy and I get my,
my uncle,

2427
01:37:53,871 --> 01:37:56,310
a pair of tits and uh,
I'm sorry.

2428
01:37:56,310 --> 01:38:01,310
I put too much lemon in the homies.
I'm serious.

2429
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:05,240
And I know Ryan.
I know 10 Allen.

2430
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:06,570
I met him at a roast.
I like them.

2431
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:09,240
I'm just saying when people talk about,
you know,

2432
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:12,250
everything's gate up on TV.
That show is a perfect example.

2433
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:13,530
It up.
Oh my God.

2434
01:38:13,550 --> 01:38:15,090
And again,
that's not,

2435
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:16,530
I'm not saying anything against gay 
people.

2436
01:38:16,531 --> 01:38:17,760
I'm just saying.
But,

2437
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:20,340
but that show is what would piss people 
off.

2438
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:23,490
You know,
I get it till you sorta.

2439
01:38:23,491 --> 01:38:24,460
Yeah,
I know what you.

2440
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:25,373
I mean,
I get a sensitive to people that attack 

2441
01:38:26,761 --> 01:38:28,460
your own ideas.
Like when people,

2442
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:31,020
when someone,
someone's like,

2443
01:38:31,021 --> 01:38:31,854
Seth Meyers is attacking your ideas.
My ideas make it up a bunch of fucking 

2444
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,233
real soft jokes about trump.
He had one very good bit that he did 

2445
01:38:39,571 --> 01:38:42,510
recently where they were talking about 
the ban the ban on immigrants.

2446
01:38:42,610 --> 01:38:45,050
Like when they were like,
no one is saying ban.

2447
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:47,010
It's not a band.
We've never used the word ban.

2448
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:47,963
And then he cuts to a clip,
a montage of trump and all the other 

2449
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:53,100
saying that you could go to any 
politician.

2450
01:38:53,101 --> 01:38:57,930
It's just fucking cheap trickery,
but not as much as I used to like um,

2451
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:00,690
but,
but I think NBC sat him down and said,

2452
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:03,450
you gotta go fucking.
You got to be the point man on this.

2453
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:04,443
We think so.
Oh,

2454
01:39:04,450 --> 01:39:05,283
I do.
I've never had a sat down having been 

2455
01:39:08,611 --> 01:39:09,444
sat down.
I've never had a sat down and I sat 

2456
01:39:11,551 --> 01:39:11,970
down.
Yeah,

2457
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:13,440
will never.
No one's ever sat me down.

2458
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:15,570
Oh No.
No one's ever sat me down and said,

2459
01:39:15,571 --> 01:39:16,800
hey,
you got to go this way.

2460
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:18,360
That's never happened.
Literally ever.

2461
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:19,223
Well,
of course not because you are a 

2462
01:39:19,421 --> 01:39:23,900
mushrooms and you lift weights.
They're not going to accuse you.

2463
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:26,930
Shoot an elk on the one slash nine out 
of the back of the bow and Arrow who the

2464
01:39:26,931 --> 01:39:28,200
who the fuck gonna tell you to do 
anything.

2465
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,033
Go.
But people accuse you if you have an 

2466
01:39:30,901 --> 01:39:35,190
idea and you run with a cause,
they accuse you of being sat down by the

2467
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:36,033
elite.
So of course I think that point they 

2468
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:41,183
didn't know it is probably how he feels.
So why would they sit them down if you 

2469
01:39:44,090 --> 01:39:46,700
already know it feels that way.
And BC does that.

2470
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:51,120
They never did when I was on.
Why would they do it with you?

2471
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:54,210
But no one ever sits.
I don't think people sit.

2472
01:39:54,211 --> 01:39:55,530
Anybody down.
I you don't.

2473
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:58,560
I know they do,
but if you ever experienced not,

2474
01:39:58,561 --> 01:39:59,394
not let's.
I know you've taken me literally hit 10 

2475
01:40:02,491 --> 01:40:03,324
years.
They get points from the New York Times 

2476
01:40:05,551 --> 01:40:09,210
and oh by the way,
seth is funny and he's a likable guy.

2477
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:11,310
Matter of fact,
when he first had his late night show,

2478
01:40:11,311 --> 01:40:12,640
I go,
I go,

2479
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:14,010
he could be a tonight show host.

2480
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:17,910
She's likable.
She'll spend the 10 minutes.

2481
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:21,090
I can't fucking watch a closer look.
And it's 40 trump jokes.

2482
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:23,370
Well,
it's low hanging fruit.

2483
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:26,280
It's not easy to make fun of trump.
Yes it is.

2484
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:27,830
Trump jokes and you're a site.
Yeah,

2485
01:40:27,831 --> 01:40:29,700
I know what he said.
Absolutely.

2486
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,790
I want you to do your act what you do 
your rack,

2487
01:40:32,791 --> 01:40:34,160
but you criticize him.
I,

2488
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:36,540
I do.
I said he made it look too easy.

2489
01:40:36,541 --> 01:40:37,374
Number one,
he was just telling people what they 

2490
01:40:38,011 --> 01:40:38,844
want her to hear.
What I was running fucking trump a 

2491
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,360
little bit about your healthcare plan.
Well,

2492
01:40:42,361 --> 01:40:43,950
but the skinniest people alive.
The next question,

2493
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:45,470
any followups?
No.

2494
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:47,280
Next question about Baba,
you know,

2495
01:40:47,281 --> 01:40:48,690
and uh,
and uh,

2496
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:50,040
was the fucking fine?
Yeah.

2497
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:51,900
There's no way you can deport 11 million
people.

2498
01:40:51,901 --> 01:40:54,190
Have you seen the size of my jet?
Three trips but,

2499
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,110
but you know,
I fucking take shots at them.

2500
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:57,570
That's not really.
Yeah.

2501
01:40:57,890 --> 01:40:58,990
Oh,
what are you a fucking night?

2502
01:40:59,000 --> 01:40:59,290
You're,
you're,

2503
01:40:59,290 --> 01:41:01,090
you're on the left.
The left.

2504
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:03,580
So you don't have a bunch of shit on 
him.

2505
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:06,310
I didn't say I did.
I like what he's doing.

2506
01:41:06,370 --> 01:41:07,840
Do you like the wall?

2507
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:13,190
I can build the wall.
I think the idea that people who,

2508
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:16,220
if you say you,
I want to protect our borders,

2509
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:17,083
makes you a racist.
That's some real left wing stupidity 

2510
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:19,903
right there.

2511
01:41:20,770 --> 01:41:22,230
Hm?
Yeah.

2512
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,370
Left wing's stupidity.
Yeah.

2513
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,510
Do you know California?
Jerry Brown.

2514
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:32,490
Nancy Pelosi Berkeley.
Do you think he's stupid?

2515
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:35,760
Name is ever going to come?
A time where there won't be any walls,

2516
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:36,653
there won't be any borders.
And everyone literally go anywhere they 

2517
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:40,134
want.
Not.

2518
01:41:40,230 --> 01:41:42,930
I don't know what the word lab work like
that ever,

2519
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:47,070
but how do you know what mean humanity?
Because people are psychotic,

2520
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:47,963
but how can we can do that here?
How come people can buy this country 

2521
01:41:50,071 --> 01:41:52,620
held to a different standard when it 
comes to that shit?

2522
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:54,960
Why don't you try sneaking into Mexico,
see what's happened to you,

2523
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:56,033
where the cat you invite people from all
over the world will let us go into 

2524
01:41:59,041 --> 01:42:00,100
Mexico like that.
Oh,

2525
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:02,070
you know that you could just drive to 
Mexico,

2526
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:02,821
you know that.
Right?

2527
01:42:02,821 --> 01:42:06,890
Have you ever done any gun illegally?
I'm just driving into my point.

2528
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,490
If you try to sneak in.
Right?

2529
01:42:08,491 --> 01:42:09,324
But,
but my point is when you try to go down 

2530
01:42:10,501 --> 01:42:11,910
to Mexico,
they didn't even stop you,

2531
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:14,280
so you believe is dry,
so you don't believe in borders.

2532
01:42:14,281 --> 01:42:15,114
You think that could actually work?
I think that there's an even watching 

2533
01:42:17,611 --> 01:42:19,290
what's going on in Europe right now.
Well,

2534
01:42:19,291 --> 01:42:20,124
that's a problem for sure,
but I think part of the reason that's a 

2535
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:24,930
problem is that culturally the places 
these people are coming from are archaic

2536
01:42:24,990 --> 01:42:25,823
and that's something that the left 
doesn't want to admit and I'm with them 

2537
01:42:27,211 --> 01:42:29,760
100 percent and it's a real problem 
because what's interesting,

2538
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:32,160
but here's the problem.
That's right.

2539
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:33,211
It is right.
Please.

2540
01:42:33,211 --> 01:42:35,010
All cultures aren't equal.
Never were.

2541
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:35,970
No,
they're not only the.

2542
01:42:36,030 --> 01:42:39,390
That's the left main tenant was a goal,
but those.

2543
01:42:39,391 --> 01:42:42,450
What's interesting to me is that those 
cultures that are the problem,

2544
01:42:43,310 --> 01:42:44,920
they're uncredible massage.

2545
01:42:44,930 --> 01:42:45,763
Right.
And we're ready to fucking feminist 

2546
01:42:46,621 --> 01:42:47,760
yelling at them.
And if you.

2547
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:48,653
If you say anything about those year 
Islamophobia and you're a right wing 

2548
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:52,164
hate monger,
but you're talking about cultures that 

2549
01:42:53,521 --> 01:42:56,700
are incredibly restrictive of women's 
Bible.

2550
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,140
Yeah.
It looks like 11 a.

2551
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:00,720
I always say that,
but that's my point.

2552
01:43:00,721 --> 01:43:02,380
And even Bill Maher pointed it out.
Yeah.

2553
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:04,350
He was yelling at the left,
the feminist.

2554
01:43:04,351 --> 01:43:07,260
Where are you yelling at trump?
Because he loves to grab pussy.

2555
01:43:07,261 --> 01:43:09,780
Meanwhile they lopping off heads because
a girl shows their ankle.

2556
01:43:09,781 --> 01:43:12,020
It's true.
It's like that's what I'm talking about.

2557
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:13,830
I'm not a huge.
You're trying to make me have to be like

2558
01:43:13,831 --> 01:43:14,680
a huge trump.
I'm not,

2559
01:43:14,990 --> 01:43:15,721
I'm not,
I'm not,

2560
01:43:15,721 --> 01:43:18,960
but I'm saying at one point in time 
we'll take the watchers like that,

2561
01:43:18,990 --> 01:43:21,000
but at one point in time that was the 
norm,

2562
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:22,530
like 2000,
3000 years ago.

2563
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:23,940
That was a normal worldwide.
Right?

2564
01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:27,180
I mean there was a,
there was a restrictive policies against

2565
01:43:27,181 --> 01:43:29,850
women and things along those lines.
That was the norm worldwide.

2566
01:43:29,851 --> 01:43:30,570
I guess.
So.

2567
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:31,403
So how is it not that you are right now 
in California because people progress 

2568
01:43:34,111 --> 01:43:34,944
and evolve.
So don't you think she can progress 

2569
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:39,510
involve worldwide to the point where we 
don't have to have right now.

2570
01:43:39,511 --> 01:43:42,000
That wasn't even a question.
It's a long time.

2571
01:43:42,330 --> 01:43:43,163
Well,
my question is will there be a time 

2572
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:48,030
where people can just go everywhere and 
you said you don't think the world works

2573
01:43:48,031 --> 01:43:49,470
that way.
I really don't.

2574
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:52,000
People all flawed as a species.
We're definitely fly the

2575
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,170
species here in California.
It's never going to change.

2576
01:43:54,171 --> 01:43:56,480
You could drive to sonoma right now.
No one's gonna stop you.

2577
01:43:56,481 --> 01:43:57,314
You don't have to show your papers.
I feel like there's gotta be a come a 

2578
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:00,044
time in history where human beings are 
allowed to travel freely wherever they 

2579
01:44:04,011 --> 01:44:05,900
want to go live,
wherever they want to go,

2580
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:07,430
and the only thing that's stopping that 
is it.

2581
01:44:07,431 --> 01:44:12,110
Some places are far less far less 
prosperous than we are here.

2582
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:12,750
So

2583
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:14,910
what it states deeper and not just 
prosperous.

2584
01:44:14,911 --> 01:44:15,744
It's because like you said,
you're seeing what's going on in Europe 

2585
01:44:19,110 --> 01:44:19,943
and it's not fucking working.
It's not as close to open borders as 

2586
01:44:22,171 --> 01:44:23,670
you're going to get well.
So

2587
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,830
and a lot of these other countries,
they got a little silly and they thought

2588
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:28,693
the rest of the world is like them and 
they just let all these immigrants in 

2589
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:31,933
instantaneously with this,
but my point is not that we should let 

2590
01:44:34,731 --> 01:44:36,620
everybody in and just let do whatever 
you want.

2591
01:44:36,621 --> 01:44:40,940
My point is that at some point in time,
that's got to be the way the world works

2592
01:44:40,941 --> 01:44:43,490
where you could literally go anywhere 
you want and then I don't think.

2593
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:44,383
I think you know,
like the Tower of Babel and the idea 

2594
01:44:46,481 --> 01:44:47,314
that one point in time people spoke one 
language and then the God decided they 

2595
01:44:49,881 --> 01:44:51,920
were getting too crazy and then he split
them up,

2596
01:44:51,921 --> 01:44:52,754
but all over the world and gave them a 
bunch of different languages to never 

2597
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:55,333
communicate with each other.
It seems to me that if human beings 

2598
01:44:57,711 --> 01:44:59,510
continue along the path that we're on 
now,

2599
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,640
how long it takes,
whether it's 5,000

2600
01:45:01,641 --> 01:45:02,474
years or whatever,
we're going to come to a point in time 

2601
01:45:03,681 --> 01:45:04,514
where we have a universal language and 
it might be within our grandchildren's 

2602
01:45:07,821 --> 01:45:08,654
lifetime where people are allowed to 
communicate with people all over the 

2603
01:45:10,581 --> 01:45:15,581
world and if technology can evolve our,
our,

2604
01:45:15,641 --> 01:45:16,474
our cultures to the point where these 
people that live in these unbelievably 

2605
01:45:19,401 --> 01:45:20,234
restrictive environments and communities
can get to the point where they're like 

2606
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:25,483
the United States.

2607
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:28,520
We have disagreements,
but you're free to go wherever you want.

2608
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:30,380
I mean,
that's gotta be the future.

2609
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:31,130
That's what I think.

2610
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:32,300
Yeah.
Yeah,

2611
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:33,163
but that doesn't make him a racist for 
wanting to protect our borders and 

2612
01:45:36,081 --> 01:45:37,510
that's at notch.
He's at nap,

2613
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:40,360
fascist.
Nazi goes not doing anything bad.

2614
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:44,240
This look at a view of life that's the 
fire left.

2615
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:47,120
Their ideas work great on paper.
Everybody agrees with them.

2616
01:45:47,121 --> 01:45:48,230
Yes,
they should be open,

2617
01:45:48,231 --> 01:45:49,064
but it just,
like you said,

2618
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:49,903
everybody should be able to live 
together and that all make sense to toe 

2619
01:45:53,291 --> 01:45:54,124
the rubber hits the road.
It sounds good technically and it will 

2620
01:45:56,961 --> 01:45:58,460
eventually.
Hopefully they'll get there,

2621
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:02,990
but I'm just saying you can't label 
people fascist and a racist that want to

2622
01:46:02,991 --> 01:46:05,790
fucking protect the water.
I agree with you.

2623
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:06,823
Somebody who loves lead,
he knows because they are like Italians 

2624
01:46:08,391 --> 01:46:09,224
to me.
They look like I'm not just Latinos now 

2625
01:46:10,851 --> 01:46:13,940
we have Central America and the whole 
world coming and Canadian.

2626
01:46:13,941 --> 01:46:15,740
I'm Canadian,
so I'm half Canadian.

2627
01:46:15,741 --> 01:46:16,574
French Canada.

2628
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:18,113
You know what's really fucked up is that
it's really easy to come over here from 

2629
01:46:20,071 --> 01:46:20,904
Syria.
It's really hard to come over from 

2630
01:46:22,441 --> 01:46:23,274
Canada.
They've made it more difficult for 

2631
01:46:25,711 --> 01:46:26,544
places.
Other places that are like almost offer 

2632
01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:31,740
zero problems to.
To emigrate to America.

2633
01:46:31,741 --> 01:46:34,140
Like if you're a Canadian and you tried 
to get a job in America,

2634
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,153
good luck.
I know a lot of people that are 

2635
01:46:36,271 --> 01:46:38,520
Canadians that you've got to plan,
you've got to marry somebody.

2636
01:46:39,150 --> 01:46:40,620
You got to find some chick.
Yeah.

2637
01:46:40,950 --> 01:46:42,720
And the hook it up,
you know?

2638
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,670
Good Canadian boy.
Come on over here.

2639
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:46,470
Or a good Canadian girl.
Yeah.

2640
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:47,260
Not

2641
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:48,160
that hard to,
to,

2642
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,340
to come here from Syria.
I mean Obama

2643
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:51,173
was busting people to cities and 
dropping them off without even telling 

2644
01:46:53,611 --> 01:46:55,240
the mayors and shit.
That's all you know.

2645
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:56,160
Really.
Oh yeah.

2646
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:58,110
He was doing it himself.
Did he drive the bows?

2647
01:46:58,111 --> 01:46:59,220
His.
It was his.

2648
01:46:59,430 --> 01:47:01,110
Was his idea of executive orders?
Yes.

2649
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:02,110
How?
What did,

2650
01:47:02,110 --> 01:47:03,780
how did that order go?
Do you know what the order was?

2651
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:05,730
Oh,
now now you're getting almost asking.

2652
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:07,360
I don't know.
Well,

2653
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:08,633
I've never heard this before.
Aca and all that stuff is questionably 

2654
01:47:12,341 --> 01:47:14,520
on constantly.
You didn't hear about it exactly because

2655
01:47:14,521 --> 01:47:15,354
the media wouldn't cover it.
If you go online and talking to mayors 

2656
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:21,720
in Pennsylvania,
schools are being,

2657
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,530
you know,
we're one place was overwhelmed.

2658
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:24,403
Lynn,
Massachusetts schools are being 

2659
01:47:25,531 --> 01:47:28,070
overwhelmed by kids who,
you know,

2660
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,420
have been here for five minutes.
Brilliant.

2661
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:34,500
Lot of unconstitutional shit went on.
You know,

2662
01:47:35,070 --> 01:47:37,350
I never heard about that.
I'm not making it up.

2663
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:39,210
It was so many things going on in the 
world.

2664
01:47:39,211 --> 01:47:40,860
It's impossible to be abreast of all 
that.

2665
01:47:40,890 --> 01:47:42,540
Absolutely.
That's what I'm saying.

2666
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:46,380
Just it's not that hard.
I'm saying,

2667
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:49,890
you know,
so we just got so lucky.

2668
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:53,790
That's the problem in America.
We got so fucking lucky geographically.

2669
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:55,260
Oh the luckiest.
Yeah.

2670
01:47:55,261 --> 01:47:56,640
But you know what?
That's all changed.

2671
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:00,180
How so?
What do you mean plane?

2672
01:48:00,270 --> 01:48:02,220
They can fly over now.
They don't have to fucking,

2673
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:05,280
you know,
but that's all changed.

2674
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:08,130
Nine slash 11 or trying to get.
I'm in a long time ago,

2675
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:14,710
I'm just saying you were right for years
because of a.

2676
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:18,050
We were at geographically with two 
oceans will not just bought.

2677
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,570
It's things like flight and.
But it's also the spot itself,

2678
01:48:21,571 --> 01:48:24,060
like just having the opportunity you 
have here in America.

2679
01:48:24,061 --> 01:48:26,070
It's so unusual.
It's so unusual.

2680
01:48:26,071 --> 01:48:26,904
No caste system.
Like we were talking about India yet 

2681
01:48:28,291 --> 01:48:28,500
yet.

2682
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:31,860
Yet all you hear is how racist isn't and
homophobic yet people,

2683
01:48:32,030 --> 01:48:36,110
both black and brown people are trying 
to sneak in a.

2684
01:48:36,110 --> 01:48:37,830
is that,
is that all you hear?

2685
01:48:37,831 --> 01:48:39,870
Is that America,
America's racist if you watch TV,

2686
01:48:39,871 --> 01:48:40,920
mainstream media.
Yeah.

2687
01:48:40,921 --> 01:48:42,510
That's all you hear.
I don't.

2688
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:43,740
Yes.
Oh yeah.

2689
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:48,060
I know you don't want to yet.
You exactly.

2690
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:51,090
I don't watch programming the trend of 
program.

2691
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:55,280
You think the mainstream media is like 
an has a left slant to it at all?

2692
01:48:55,350 --> 01:48:56,640
I definitely.
Did they admit that?

2693
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:58,343
I definitely do,
and that's what people get their 

2694
01:49:00,871 --> 01:49:01,900
information.
Yeah.

2695
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:02,491
No.
Well,

2696
01:49:02,491 --> 01:49:04,920
if you're on the right,
you have to feel pretty alienated by the

2697
01:49:04,921 --> 01:49:09,921
media because the mainstream media,
which is primarily in New York and La,

2698
01:49:10,650 --> 01:49:11,483
California,
those are these big central locations 

2699
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:15,120
for liberal thinking.
Yeah.

2700
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:18,240
Isn't it weird though that when you get 
big giant groups of people together,

2701
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:20,880
they become liberal is weird.

2702
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,833
How so?
Predominantly like New York dominantly 

2703
01:49:23,731 --> 01:49:25,470
liberal.
California's predominantly liberal.

2704
01:49:25,471 --> 01:49:27,030
Those are the population centers of the 
country.

2705
01:49:27,031 --> 01:49:28,740
They're also the education centers of 
the country.

2706
01:49:29,010 --> 01:49:30,900
It's really fascinating to me that when 
you,

2707
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:31,763
and even in Chicago,
Chicago's kind of predominantly liberal 

2708
01:49:33,621 --> 01:49:35,490
as well,
yet they lost the election,

2709
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:37,260
but it was,
but isn't it strange though?

2710
01:49:37,261 --> 01:49:38,094
I mean I understand.
I'm not saying a bubble who don't hang 

2711
01:49:39,511 --> 01:49:40,770
around with other people.
It's bad,

2712
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:41,713
but.
But why is it though that when you get 

2713
01:49:43,471 --> 01:49:46,770
giant clumps of people that have to live
together in huge groups,

2714
01:49:46,771 --> 01:49:48,040
they primarily liberal.

2715
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:49,880
What's interesting cities in the midwest
that aren't,

2716
01:49:50,190 --> 01:49:51,370
you know,
but what?

2717
01:49:52,090 --> 01:49:53,870
That aren't liberal named one.
Yeah.

2718
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:57,720
Like what?
I don't know it.

2719
01:49:58,170 --> 01:49:59,930
That's not the Midwest.
I know.

2720
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:01,360
I was trying to think of the midwest 
myself.

2721
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:03,780
It was the middle school.
I was liberal but.

2722
01:50:03,781 --> 01:50:05,380
But it's also.
Is there man?

2723
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:06,820
No.
I know he wore a dress,

2724
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:08,640
but I sell out of Minneapolis.
They love me.

2725
01:50:08,641 --> 01:50:09,490
Tow.
I bet they do.

2726
01:50:09,491 --> 01:50:11,170
There's plenty of people.
That's what I'm saying.

2727
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:14,200
You're a funny guy.
You know you'd sell out in New York.

2728
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:15,980
What the fuck you talking about?
You know.

2729
01:50:15,981 --> 01:50:16,461
No,
I don't.

2730
01:50:16,461 --> 01:50:17,294
You know,
you will now know when you put on the 

2731
01:50:18,681 --> 01:50:19,750
robe.
I go,

2732
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:25,000
it's the belly of the beast.
Find a fucking Nyu students.

2733
01:50:25,001 --> 01:50:27,340
What are you shitting me?
All the Nyu students are hilarious.

2734
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:28,570
All students.
Hilarious.

2735
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,490
How about college campuses?
That seems pretty fair.

2736
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:31,323
What goes on there?
I have a friend of mine who goes to Nyu 

2737
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:35,020
and she sent me this.
Um,

2738
01:50:35,130 --> 01:50:37,720
this thing that was abolishing whiteness
was a.

2739
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:39,430
oh,
I covered that on my podcast.

2740
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:40,820
Abolishing whiteness.
Yeah.

2741
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:42,493
That's a,
that's a class and almost every college 

2742
01:50:43,751 --> 01:50:44,950
now.
That's what I'm talking about.

2743
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:46,510
How's that fair?
Yeah.

2744
01:50:47,290 --> 01:50:49,060
I don't know.
I don't know how it was a pharaoh.

2745
01:50:49,690 --> 01:50:50,523
It's not.
It just seems to me that there's just 

2746
01:50:53,471 --> 01:50:54,304
too much us versus them.
And that's where real part of the 

2747
01:50:56,261 --> 01:50:57,720
problem.
Media is.

2748
01:50:57,730 --> 01:50:59,190
That immediate way.
Of course,

2749
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:04,440
that's part of the media.
Why are you so are you,

2750
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:06,610
you're,
you're in a slight way.

2751
01:51:06,611 --> 01:51:08,320
You're doing it very softly,
but how so?

2752
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:09,213
Oh,
you're a lefty,

2753
01:51:09,610 --> 01:51:11,100
but you think I am.
Well,

2754
01:51:11,110 --> 01:51:13,090
just get you eat.
Elk doesn't make you a fucking right.

2755
01:51:13,091 --> 01:51:14,070
But what makes me a righty?

2756
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:17,660
What would I have to do know?
What would make you a righty?

2757
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:18,753
What?
What would make me a lefty buck and 

2758
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:23,000
paying for punching somebody I disagree 
with spot.

2759
01:51:24,270 --> 01:51:25,600
That's tough.
You'd calm down.

2760
01:51:25,650 --> 01:51:26,483
That's why I would.
If I didn't have this generator first 

2761
01:51:28,401 --> 01:51:30,840
and I had to rely on my neighbor's man,
I just say,

2762
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,190
I just drank a quarter.
Your coffees fired,

2763
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:35,840
whatever,
but what makes it a little bit,

2764
01:51:35,841 --> 01:51:37,790
but what are the primary things?
I don't know.

2765
01:51:38,530 --> 01:51:40,450
Labels.
People writing me.

2766
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:42,130
Not Yo,
your side.

2767
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:44,550
My side.
My Newton.

2768
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:48,120
Newton.
Where you grew up?

2769
01:51:48,730 --> 01:51:50,230
False.
Blue collar.

2770
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:52,160
What's up or falls?
I know.

2771
01:51:52,910 --> 01:51:53,950
I know.
The poor area.

2772
01:51:53,951 --> 01:51:57,910
Would they make only out in 40 grand?
That's a poor part of noting.

2773
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:02,050
Just imagine this is a place where 
people average 140 grand a week.

2774
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:03,963
Imagine it's called Apple.
Anybody who works in Cupertino is that 

2775
01:52:08,201 --> 01:52:08,920
nice up there?

2776
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:11,530
Beautiful Kid got attacked by a mountain
lion last year though.

2777
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:13,530
That's part of the problem with 
liberals.

2778
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:17,500
Didn't want to kill mountain lions,
so that's why I'm not on their side with

2779
01:52:17,501 --> 01:52:18,590
that issue.
Exactly.

2780
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:19,653
It was a bunch of.
That's how you protect the border with 

2781
01:52:20,891 --> 01:52:24,270
fucking online.
Mexicans know how to handle mountain.

2782
01:52:24,271 --> 01:52:25,930
I know gonna be scared of them.
Yeah.

2783
01:52:25,931 --> 01:52:27,780
Then that's doing 10 minutes.
Eat.

2784
01:52:27,830 --> 01:52:30,980
I'm good.
Backstrap cook them up.

2785
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:34,200
The Mountain Lion Loins tastes like pork
is really good.

2786
01:52:34,230 --> 01:52:34,961
Lion.
No,

2787
01:52:34,961 --> 01:52:36,940
but I know a friend of mine was shot 
one.

2788
01:52:36,941 --> 01:52:38,330
He says delicious.
Sarah's.

2789
01:52:38,410 --> 01:52:39,910
Yeah.
What is it malicious,

2790
01:52:39,911 --> 01:52:43,360
really a wolf.
Have you had.

2791
01:52:43,361 --> 01:52:44,560
Well,
no I haven't,

2792
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:45,763
but uh,
Steve Rinella who was on the podcast is 

2793
01:52:47,451 --> 01:52:50,330
a very famous hunter and author and 
historian.

2794
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:51,343
He was telling me that there was this 
famous mountain man and a wolf was his 

2795
01:52:54,261 --> 01:52:56,060
favorite meal.
You like to eat wolf?

2796
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:58,330
Yeah.
Terrorists.

2797
01:52:58,370 --> 01:52:59,203
Guys to shoot wolves and eat them.
But I wonder if his faction faction of 

2798
01:53:03,891 --> 01:53:04,724
eating a wolf because you know,
it could eat you like that's probably 

2799
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:10,310
what I figured you would be drinking a 
wolf's blood and shit.

2800
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:12,110
I'm going to be bear.
I've eaten a lot of bear.

2801
01:53:12,130 --> 01:53:12,921
Right.
You probably.

2802
01:53:12,921 --> 01:53:15,800
And you do it for like reasons like the 
Japanese he chocked fens.

2803
01:53:15,801 --> 01:53:19,460
You want the county and the vitality of 
seat and Rhino.

2804
01:53:19,461 --> 01:53:20,350
Dicks and shit.

2805
01:53:24,090 --> 01:53:24,870
No,
they,

2806
01:53:24,870 --> 01:53:25,703
they should bear because they have to 
because there's so many bear and they 

2807
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:31,460
buried all the mix and if some guy,
and I'm not,

2808
01:53:31,570 --> 01:53:33,980
it's funny now he has robbed,
not like a fucking righty,

2809
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:35,113
like when I was younger I'd killed 
pheasants and Shit and my grandmother 

2810
01:53:37,161 --> 01:53:39,410
would cook and I'd shoot rabbits and 
shit like that.

2811
01:53:39,590 --> 01:53:42,440
As I get older though,
as you get older you appreciate,

2812
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:45,170
you know,
I mean when I see people shooting,

2813
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:46,033
taking down a giant elephant,
safari is really hard to kill an 

2814
01:53:50,031 --> 01:53:50,864
elephant.
I could walk up to it and stabbed to 

2815
01:53:52,161 --> 01:53:52,994
death.
You definitely couldn't fucking kill 

2816
01:53:54,711 --> 01:53:56,080
you.
Throw you it.

2817
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,190
How hard is it to hit an elephant with a
gun,

2818
01:53:58,191 --> 01:53:59,180
Joe?
Not very hard.

2819
01:53:59,390 --> 01:54:01,160
Not very hard.
Or you get a moose?

2820
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:03,500
Well,
Moza delicious.

2821
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:04,970
And uh,
I,

2822
01:54:04,971 --> 01:54:08,030
I don't get close to it.
You couldn't shoot a moose.

2823
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:10,460
I could like,
there's so many dare my where I live,

2824
01:54:10,461 --> 01:54:12,350
I could suffocate them with demos.
I could,

2825
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:15,810
I could stop here with the dry cleaning 
bag and my back.

2826
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:18,530
Well you have a lot of Moose in.
There are a lot of deer in your area,

2827
01:54:18,531 --> 01:54:19,940
right?
That area is overrun.

2828
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:21,770
Okay.
Be careful of ticks,

2829
01:54:21,771 --> 01:54:23,510
right?
Don't just lyme disease.

2830
01:54:23,511 --> 01:54:25,910
I got it.
And you get lyme disease.

2831
01:54:26,810 --> 01:54:29,270
I had the tick.
I had the big bullseye on my back and my

2832
01:54:29,271 --> 01:54:31,880
wife got it.
Buck and luckily we caught it early,

2833
01:54:31,881 --> 01:54:35,780
but I go by Johnny [inaudible] by John.
His wife got lyme disease.

2834
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:36,950
It's fucking dangerous,
man.

2835
01:54:36,951 --> 01:54:37,730
I know.
I know.

2836
01:54:37,730 --> 01:54:38,563
10 people that have it.
I have to check my boss before I go to 

2837
01:54:40,341 --> 01:54:41,940
bed every night for texts.
Yeah,

2838
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:45,020
in the summertime.
Well they give you an antiseptic.

2839
01:54:45,021 --> 01:54:46,130
That's what's weird.
Ticks.

2840
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:49,460
They have like antiseptic saliva.
So then when you're biting you,

2841
01:54:49,461 --> 01:54:50,730
you don't even feel it.
Right.

2842
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:54,680
Creepy little fuckers,
man.

2843
01:54:55,070 --> 01:54:56,780
And there's diseases.
They say that in the.

2844
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:57,883
Somewhere in New York there was some,
some place like near Long Island where 

2845
01:55:01,131 --> 01:55:01,964
they tested the ticks and they found 
that 60 percent of the ticks had lyme 

2846
01:55:05,781 --> 01:55:07,160
disease.
Six zero.

2847
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:09,890
That's fucking insane.
It was insane.

2848
01:55:09,891 --> 01:55:11,330
Yeah.
My wife's knee blow up.

2849
01:55:11,331 --> 01:55:12,164
She got this big fucking.
So did she take the antibiotics and 

2850
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:18,050
declare it all that shit because we 
caught it quick.

2851
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:21,800
People you don't even know.
We're not a guy on our podcast.

2852
01:55:21,801 --> 01:55:22,634
Steve Kotler and he had lyme disease for
a fucking year before they diagnosed it 

2853
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:31,130
and it fucked him up so bad that he was 
in the hospital for three years,

2854
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:33,500
three years from lyme disease.
Remember that?

2855
01:55:33,501 --> 01:55:34,334
Jamie will.
Yeah.

2856
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:35,413
Scary.
My wife had to walk around with like an 

2857
01:55:37,131 --> 01:55:39,020
IB thing.
Oh Jesus Christ.

2858
01:55:39,021 --> 01:55:39,980
And uh,
no.

2859
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:41,980
It's like a silent epidemic in this 
country.

2860
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:44,970
Those goddamn and come off the fucking 
deer that come off the deal.

2861
01:55:44,971 --> 01:55:46,620
Look so cute and shit.
Yeah.

2862
01:55:46,890 --> 01:55:48,630
But it's terrifying.
Yeah.

2863
01:55:48,631 --> 01:55:52,470
When I shot that deer in Colorado,
we found a bunch of ticks on it.

2864
01:55:52,471 --> 01:55:54,240
We got to be super careful cleaning it 
up.

2865
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:55,591
Oh,
is that right?

2866
01:55:55,591 --> 01:55:56,251
Yeah.
Yeah.

2867
01:55:56,251 --> 01:55:58,050
We found ticks like nearest balls and 
shit.

2868
01:55:59,020 --> 01:56:00,360
You have to be careful.
Ticks,

2869
01:56:00,361 --> 01:56:02,600
love balls won't fix her.
Gross man.

2870
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:03,453
They just fucking creepy little animals 
that have this bizarre disease that we 

2871
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:09,420
were fairly recent.
I know it's a recent disease.

2872
01:56:09,421 --> 01:56:10,290
I mean it's,
it's not,

2873
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:12,470
it's not that it's probably been around 
right,

2874
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,100
but they didn't know what it was back in
the day.

2875
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:15,720
I don't think they think that.
No,

2876
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,910
they think that it's something that is 
a,

2877
01:56:18,130 --> 01:56:18,963
something created by the right.
There's a bunch of conspiracy theories 

2878
01:56:21,571 --> 01:56:22,790
about lyme disease.
Yeah.

2879
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:23,653
It's definitely could pay and completed 
by the right because it affects mostly 

2880
01:56:25,501 --> 01:56:26,334
white people.

2881
01:56:26,350 --> 01:56:30,000
That's why there's too many of us.
It depends.

2882
01:56:30,930 --> 01:56:31,830
Group.
Oh,

2883
01:56:31,831 --> 01:56:33,180
read that book.
I'm scared.

2884
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:34,800
Sarah Z.
I'm never voting again.

2885
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:37,290
So what do you just think that it's all 
a scam?

2886
01:56:37,710 --> 01:56:39,600
Toe Drain it.
It's not a scam.

2887
01:56:39,601 --> 01:56:40,800
It's planned.
The fucking,

2888
01:56:40,801 --> 01:56:41,634
the rockefellers.
They are the ones at the heart of all 

2889
01:56:43,471 --> 01:56:44,304
this shit selling to the book.
Trump is involved in it and he doesn't 

2890
01:56:46,771 --> 01:56:49,410
know it so far.
They think ahead.

2891
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:53,950
You know Bill Hicks's bit right about.
Just pop it on the left.

2892
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:54,833
No,
I knew the puppet on the right is one 

2893
01:56:56,341 --> 01:57:01,341
guy controlling both puppets.
Book makes that crystal fucking clear.

2894
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:04,710
Will look at you.
Your eyes are bulging tense.

2895
01:57:05,090 --> 01:57:07,350
It's like I get an eight ball with this 
fucking rocket fuel.

2896
01:57:07,351 --> 01:57:10,080
You put in me,
don't drink one of these,

2897
01:57:10,081 --> 01:57:11,280
whatever you do.
No,

2898
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:12,153
I can't say that.
Seventy milligrams caffeine and that'll 

2899
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:17,780
make me cry in the plant and I got a 
beat it soon.

2900
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:18,341
Okay.
[inaudible].

2901
01:57:18,341 --> 01:57:20,440
I got my car.
Jerry Sandusky.

2902
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:22,860
Son Jeffrey charged with child sexual 
abuse.

2903
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:25,680
Oh,
runs in the family.

2904
01:57:25,681 --> 01:57:27,720
Of course it does.
He probably did it to his own kid.

2905
01:57:27,750 --> 01:57:28,583
More than five.
Yeah.

2906
01:57:28,810 --> 01:57:31,140
Oh my God.
Jesus fucking Christ.

2907
01:57:31,141 --> 01:57:31,974
It's terrifying.
Did that just come out a jam 11 minutes 

2908
01:57:34,141 --> 01:57:35,730
ago?
God,

2909
01:57:35,731 --> 01:57:36,564
that's so terrible.
I was supposed to go bowling with him 

2910
01:57:37,621 --> 01:57:38,454
next week.
Criminal solicitation and corruption of 

2911
01:57:40,561 --> 01:57:42,240
minors.
14 counts.

2912
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:44,040
Oh God.
He's 41.

2913
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:47,250
Jesus Christ.
That's so gross.

2914
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:48,820
How many comps?
14.

2915
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,300
That's probably all they caught him with
his old man's like,

2916
01:57:51,301 --> 01:57:52,370
hey,
couldn't keep up with me.

2917
01:57:53,310 --> 01:57:56,250
You're lacking like every other kid.
Got It.

2918
01:57:56,251 --> 01:57:57,084
Easy.
You got it.

2919
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:59,790
Good.
So he's going away should.

2920
01:58:00,030 --> 01:58:00,863
But that's the crazy thing about child 
sexual molestation that it seems to 

2921
01:58:03,550 --> 01:58:06,720
affect the kids and the kids wind up 
doing it.

2922
01:58:06,721 --> 01:58:08,410
It's like what you just said it pro.

2923
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:10,890
We don't know for a fact,
but you're probably right.

2924
01:58:11,010 --> 01:58:11,791
Yeah,
sure.

2925
01:58:11,791 --> 01:58:15,450
He got dead old.
I'm sure his dad was so fucking piece of

2926
01:58:15,451 --> 01:58:17,250
shit.
He probably fucked him too.

2927
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:19,770
He probably fucked everybody,
but he knew a three,

2928
01:58:19,771 --> 01:58:20,820
four defense.
I'll tell you.

2929
01:58:21,170 --> 01:58:22,010
Did He,
was he good at it?

2930
01:58:22,011 --> 01:58:24,360
I don't know.
He was there for years though.

2931
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:27,710
It's tuned to watching on the sideline.
It's too bad job.

2932
01:58:27,711 --> 01:58:28,544
Paternal dot.
I would like to have known what he knew 

2933
01:58:29,550 --> 01:58:31,890
about two minutes after he retired.
He was,

2934
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:35,120
was actually lucky we didn't get the 
grill rest must have been like.

2935
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:36,900
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

2936
01:58:36,901 --> 01:58:37,734
You know,
and the guy that age took down a statue 

2937
01:58:39,631 --> 01:58:42,100
and all that shit and realize that like 
his whole legacy

2938
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,980
was tainted by being connected to this 
fucking criminal.

2939
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:47,260
And then they replaced the statue with 
peewee Herman.

2940
01:58:47,261 --> 01:58:48,640
That was kind of a dig at them or 
anything.

2941
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:50,260
So the joke.
Yeah,

2942
01:58:51,030 --> 01:58:52,270
thyroid.
Jamie got it.

2943
01:58:52,271 --> 01:58:55,180
And look at these fucking laughed.
What do you tell a producer not to laugh

2944
01:58:55,181 --> 01:58:56,710
out loud.
Funny laughs and everything.

2945
01:58:57,310 --> 01:59:00,040
It's constantly laughing.
I just didn't know what you're saying.

2946
01:59:00,150 --> 01:59:02,350
I was confused.
Yes.

2947
01:59:02,351 --> 01:59:04,240
Peewee Herman's a stature and Penn 
state.

2948
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:07,870
He's got to be a statue somewhere.
Google statue of peewee Herman.

2949
01:59:07,930 --> 01:59:08,763
I bet it's up somewhere.
It's right in front of the cub scouts 

2950
01:59:11,291 --> 01:59:11,921
building.
Ben,

2951
01:59:11,921 --> 01:59:13,920
when he got arrested for beating off in 
a theater,

2952
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:14,883
who hasn't done that?
That's the old school way theaters and 

2953
01:59:17,111 --> 01:59:18,790
beat off.
I liked John so much.

2954
01:59:18,791 --> 01:59:22,120
I dragged off during jazz.
When a cop that arrest someone for doing

2955
01:59:22,121 --> 01:59:22,954
that.
Did you go to jail for misappropriation 

2956
01:59:24,191 --> 01:59:25,024
of public funds?

2957
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:25,973
You're a jerk.
You're arresting people for jerking off 

2958
01:59:27,551 --> 01:59:29,640
at a porno theater.
Which what do you want to.

2959
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:33,570
I thought he was at the lowest cineplex.
Did you really?

2960
01:59:33,590 --> 01:59:34,510
I didn't know it was a bond.
No.

2961
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:36,770
He went to a goddamn gay porno theater 
for.

2962
01:59:36,790 --> 01:59:38,170
For Christ's.
Exactly,

2963
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:39,004
but apparently people were getting upset
that other regular folks couldn't just 

2964
01:59:41,831 --> 01:59:45,430
go and watch guys watch each other in 
the mouth and not pull the ticks out.

2965
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:49,750
What kind of business are you running 
here?

2966
01:59:49,870 --> 01:59:50,703
Whose men masturbating and somebody had 
to fire off an email to the theater 

2967
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:54,700
manager.
Well,

2968
01:59:54,701 --> 01:59:56,230
you know what it is as low hanging 
fruit.

2969
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:59,830
It's like they just decided to arrest 
someone they needed,

2970
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:00,673
uh,
needed to get a collar and that's how 

2971
02:00:01,541 --> 02:00:02,880
they did it.
Yeah.

2972
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,080
I think depaul you have to leave.

One hundred percent support.
CSO.

2994
02:01:01,901 --> 02:01:04,060
CSO is the shit.
They're doing amazing stuff.

They have so many.
They have stan hope has this special

She had one a few months ago.

2999
02:01:15,310 --> 02:01:17,910
Her only piece of work.
Like standup.

3000
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:19,030
Yeah.
She doesn't have a body of work.

3001
02:01:19,031 --> 02:01:20,960
That was always the criticism.
Well,

3002
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:25,000
I think she has one and a dude.
I really don't want to wait a year.

3003
02:01:25,001 --> 02:01:26,860
I just hate traveling so much.

3005

Anytime we can do it,

3006
02:01:29,890 --> 02:01:31,300
She wanted to do it that way.
