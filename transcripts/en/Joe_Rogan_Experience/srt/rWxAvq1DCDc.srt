1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,140
They give it to him?

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:01,800
No,

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,633
no.

4
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,860
Half light cotton.

5
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,650
The best jeans I've ever worn.

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,330
I don't get paid for him.

7
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:10,020
The guy just said,

8
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,690
we live who live ladies and
mother fucking gentlemen.

9
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,190
This is a fight companion podcast.

10
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:16,350
What that means is we're
watching the fights.

11
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,440
This was supposed to be the heavyweight
title fight and I was supposed to be in

12
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:20,190
Vegas.

13
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,830
It's supposed to be for BC over
doom versus Cain Velasquez.

14
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:24,720
But Cain Velasquez got hurt.

15
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,480
Uh,

16
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,620
and he pulled out of the fight and
then steep meo chick replaced him.

17
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:29,850
And then [inaudible] said,

18
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:30,840
well I'm hurt too.

19
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:31,674
Fuck this.

20
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,670
And he pulled out,

21
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:34,220
cause I guess he had a couple of injuries.

22
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:34,831
Smart move.

23
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:36,030
I guess if you're injured,

24
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:36,511
you know,

25
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:36,961
he figured,

26
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:37,231
fuck it.

27
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:38,850
I'm just going to fight
cane no matter what I guess.

28
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,080
And then when,

29
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:40,860
um,

30
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,990
when he found out I
was Mijo chickies like,

31
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:43,590
listen,

32
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,250
I'm hurt.

33
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,600
Fuck this smart move.

34
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,260
Yeah,

35
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,910
because usually you do it.

36
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:49,190
This is before we go ahead and have it,

37
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:49,501
this,

38
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:52,530
this is a fight companion
podcast is not a regular podcast.

39
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:53,940
So we're watching the fights.

40
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,890
But honestly,

41
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,920
it's almost never us watching the fights.

42
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,510
So if you listen to this right now,

43
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:00,751
you're like,

44
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:01,950
I don't give a fuck about fights.

45
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,690
Most of the time we don't either.

46
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,800
Any Bravo's here?

47
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,190
My brother Eddie Bravo,

48
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,350
the greatest endeavor did it.

49
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:10,770
What?

50
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,603
Holla.

51
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,780
Brian Cowen,

52
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,711
my dog,

53
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:17,850
one of my favorite human beings on the
planet as well as my brother Brendan

54
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:17,851
Shop.

55
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:20,280
Also one of my favorite
humans on the planet.

56
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,950
So these are my favorite
podcast more than anything.

57
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:25,020
I look forward to these
fucking things the best.

58
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,950
There's so much fun.

59
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,761
The best.

60
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:29,010
It's like we get to hang
out and be ourselves.

61
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:30,180
We get to fuck around.

62
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,270
Just talk level dude's Oh,

63
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,300
just talking shit.

64
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,470
We get tell bro out.

65
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,440
We just throw out for three hours,

66
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:39,090
go out on a Pearl authentically,

67
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,051
have some fun,

68
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:40,980
watch some fights.

69
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,270
Talk about what we,

70
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,880
Brian is going to try
on this barbell jeans.

71
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,650
I got him some flexi jeans.

72
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,190
It's kids funny how guys
don't change my son.

73
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,700
I went hiking with him and all he was
talking about for two days is I want you

74
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:55,440
to teach me how to chop down a tree.

75
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,061
He's obsessed.

76
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:57,481
I'm like,

77
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:57,861
all right,

78
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:58,070
it was,

79
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,560
but I need to chop a tree down and
constantly go and we call it quote unquote

80
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:02,480
tropic tree none.

81
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,050
And I get him a hatchet.

82
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,850
He hasn't put that hatchet down.

83
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:07,410
You give that kid any kind of a weapon.

84
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,180
My daughter looks at the hatchet like,

85
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,080
what is going to,

86
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,540
maybe I can decorate it.

87
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,440
She wanted to know.

88
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,060
She wanted to put sparkles on the handle.

89
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:15,661
And my son was like,

90
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:16,290
why?

91
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,101
You know what's interesting?

92
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:19,440
You say gay men can go one of two ways.

93
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,850
They can go towards like girly type
stuff or they can go just as manly.

94
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:25,880
We talked about how to be assigned,

95
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,060
talking about the beers.

96
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,710
Well there's just not even know.

97
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,930
It's like two different styles of gay men.

98
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,170
Like I've a gay couple that
lives on my street stud.

99
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,490
Nicest fucking dudes.

100
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,570
There's so nice.

101
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,610
And one of them is the man.

102
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:38,881
Yes,

103
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:40,020
he's into trucks.

104
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,360
Yup.

105
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,621
And,

106
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:40,860
and,

107
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,290
and it makes all the cash.

108
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,740
You can break it down to one,

109
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,430
one to be talked trucks.

110
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,870
You can break it down.

111
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,703
One Guy,

112
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,770
one fox guys and the other doesn't,

113
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,671
well I don't know.

114
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:54,630
I don't know how that works.

115
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:55,830
I don't get personal with them.

116
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,430
They're just the coolest motherfucker.

117
00:02:57,431 --> 00:02:59,890
It'd be the best neighbors.

118
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,340
I know.

119
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,470
Come to wipe that and I
get personal with them.

120
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,543
But then there's,

121
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,590
then there's like the
twinks who are there.

122
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,690
They're super girly.

123
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,700
Then why would you want
to just be with a girl?

124
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:10,181
You know what I'm saying?

125
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:11,140
Or like the lesbians.

126
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,970
Well how come some dude's like girls?

127
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:13,750
A big acid.

128
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,991
Some,

129
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:14,561
some girls,

130
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,090
dude's like girls are really skinny.

131
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,280
Everyone likes a girl with a big band.

132
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,450
Like there's some guys that are
into like really skinny girls,

133
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,330
like really skinny model
type girls with no acid.

134
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,680
I none of my friends,

135
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,630
it's all over the map that
it's a good way to put it.

136
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,500
It's all over the map.

137
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,540
He said the truck tried to
talk fucking suspension shit.

138
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,040
My heart,

139
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,351
John,

140
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:37,010
see you later.

141
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:37,250
He goes,

142
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:37,991
sucks days.

143
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:39,670
Husband is actually in the trucks too,

144
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:40,690
so it's weird.

145
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,700
But the point being is like,

146
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,070
they're very different
personalities that are gay.

147
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:47,980
Like I know gay dudes that
don't seem even a little gay.

148
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:48,911
And then,

149
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:49,151
you know,

150
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:50,970
they had eventually come out and it,

151
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,310
you know,

152
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,620
explain the whole thing like a,

153
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,813
do you know why?

154
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,220
Like this is like the fuck's his name.

155
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:57,670
Like,

156
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,720
let me think of like a good example
what this just so there's a lot of,

157
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,070
there's a lot to name him.

158
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,610
My Buddy,

159
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,990
my buddy Keith is,

160
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:05,500
is,

161
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,110
he's the man in the
relationship and he wrestled a,

162
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:08,470
you know,

163
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,110
and,

164
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,300
and college made millet makes millions
of dollars and he was with a bunch of

165
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:16,240
straight guys were all eating and
stuff hanging out that frank was there.

166
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,621
And he goes,

167
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:18,040
um,

168
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,611
he just said it.

169
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:19,720
So matter of fact that he goes,

170
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:19,900
man,

171
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,450
I think the only difference between
me and you guys is I suck cock.

172
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:23,284
You know,

173
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,570
it's got a really deep voice differences.

174
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:29,440
I'm not going to get fucked,

175
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,101
you know,

176
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:30,480
but I mean,

177
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,031
I fuck him.

178
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:31,690
You know,

179
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,450
that's Hilarious Guy,

180
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,750
right?

181
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,900
Some will only fund my
buddy Keith is that way.

182
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,200
Some will only fuck some of them.

183
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,720
Don't give blowjobs write up.

184
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,250
Some don't get blowjobs only
give blowjobs gay singles sites.

185
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,380
I bet they have to say that at that bit.

186
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:48,190
There's a name for that,

187
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,720
like a duty doesn't Suck Dick.

188
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,620
He's got to have a name.

189
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:51,670
There's gotta be like a code while

190
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,420
he's a think of a name.

191
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,080
I had the weirdest conversation with a
gay couple wants after a show I did in

192
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,640
Connecticut way back in the day.

193
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,150
Man,

194
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,680
I don't even remember what bid it was.

195
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,700
They were upset about,

196
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,890
but they came up to me after the show
and they were saying that they just,

197
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,890
just to let you know,

198
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,260
most gay guys don't fuck
each other in the ass.

199
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,580
Like we're married,

200
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:14,090
we're gay or there are a cop.

201
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,690
I don't know if they were,

202
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,850
it was legal to be married back then
because you're talking about like 91 92

203
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:19,351
something like that.

204
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:19,750
Yeah,

205
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,170
and he was talking about we just
blow each other when I was like,

206
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:24,004
okay,

207
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,510
I know where to go with this.

208
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,190
Was talking to me about
after a while I would,

209
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:30,770
I been,

210
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,420
I said,

211
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,050
I would've said,

212
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,920
I don't believe you,

213
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:33,491
but no,

214
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:33,641
no,

215
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:33,821
no.

216
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:34,151
He was,

217
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:34,871
he was being honest.

218
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,141
He was like,

219
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:35,974
we're not into it.

220
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,730
And he's like,

221
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,570
it seems like the kind of humor like that
kind of gay humor like fucking the ass

222
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,890
humor is like,

223
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,870
it goes over really big
out here in Connecticut.

224
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:44,140
Like,

225
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,150
but we mostly we hang out in the city.

226
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,133
Like he was one of those guys.

227
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,640
It was like big on telling you that.

228
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:48,870
I'm,

229
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,960
I'm very sophisticated.

230
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm always in the city and I
don't even take it in the ass.

231
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,520
I'm just getting my dick sucked by guys.

232
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,870
This trained just fucking
conversation that guys like that,

233
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,580
that,

234
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,413
uh,

235
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,700
I went to him was,

236
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,360
it was like,

237
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,841
but you know,

238
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,400
guys do get fucked in the ass.

239
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,583
Yeah.

240
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,700
What I'm talking about someone
fucking some of the ass.

241
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,400
It's not like I'm making things up now.

242
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,190
No,

243
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,870
I was under the impression
that they all did that.

244
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:14,740
They don't,

245
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,540
they definitely don't.

246
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,820
They definitely don't option though,

247
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:17,061
right?

248
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:17,510
Yeah.

249
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,011
The first time,

250
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:18,570
I don't know.

251
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,190
I don't at least on their birthday
every now and then on the birthday,

252
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,501
boom,

253
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:22,040
you got to give up.

254
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,873
You know what I mean?

255
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,190
I'm having him do a
survey once in a while.

256
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,400
A complaint.

257
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,750
I bet that's the number one complaint.

258
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:30,320
That's why they,

259
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,520
they break up when that,

260
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,280
when they stop fucking in the ass and
it's just hand jobs that you know it's

261
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:34,630
over.

262
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,160
Yeah.

263
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,750
Fuck out.

264
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,583
Get the fuck out.

265
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,560
This is the kind of fight shot
Mike piles about the fights.

266
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,340
Sean's man.

267
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,080
How's the kind of fight that makes me
wish that TRT was legal cause pile so

268
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:47,120
fucking smart and exactly.

269
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,640
He's so fucking smart and crafty.

270
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,890
I wish they could get that dude on TRT.

271
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,100
You know what I'm saying?

272
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,260
100% needs it.

273
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,440
Well of course you definitely
need it when you hit for so long.

274
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,810
40 and think how long he's been fighting.

275
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,510
He's been fighting for a long
time and he's taken some,

276
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,530
some hard shots.

277
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:06,140
He's been Kod by guys like Matt Brown.

278
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:06,950
Tough.

279
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,530
He's been killed by Roy McDonald.

280
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,530
A few other guys too.

281
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,750
He's a tough fucking smart dude though.

282
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,300
He's his skill levels very high,

283
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,460
but you know there's a reality.

284
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:19,700
This is a goddamn difference
between a 21 year old body,

285
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:22,400
a natural one and a
natural 40 year old body.

286
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,234
They're just his,

287
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,070
his fight Iq is half the very highest,

288
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,660
very high.

289
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,710
He's a savage man.

290
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:32,650
About 10 years ago we did a movie together
were extras and it will be called a

291
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,610
the assassination of a
high school principal.

292
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,940
We play like I'm 35 years old and I'm
playing a fraternity guy and it was

293
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:41,120
terrible.

294
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,661
It was terrible.

295
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,550
So,

296
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,510
but we're both in it and I,

297
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,730
that guy is such a savage,

298
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:48,050
I've never seen anybody.

299
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,460
We went to a club that night.

300
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,380
Afterwards he went into a club,

301
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,080
grab a girl like a savage,

302
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,410
just Tucker grabbed that
bitch by the opponent down.

303
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,030
We went back to the hotel
and he handled business.

304
00:07:59,031 --> 00:07:59,864
I never seen,

305
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,803
damn,

306
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,420
we don't know what his status was that
we don't know what happened between 10

307
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:06,320
and 20 years ago.

308
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,910
He could have been a hundred years ago.

309
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,430
Mike Pyle is,

310
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,190
one thing I remember about
Mike is he is a savage.

311
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,400
I've never seen anybody get down like
let's be real careful with those kinds of

312
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,413
details.

313
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,710
Those can be brought up.

314
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,431
Yeah,

315
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:19,910
that's true.

316
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,840
That's assault brother.

317
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,890
He can't be doing that.

318
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,910
Well he's uh,

319
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,270
yeah.

320
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,160
You can't say you do that anymore.

321
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,160
It used to be that that was
like an old movie trick.

322
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,600
Do you know who's the biggest savage as
far as getting chicks I've ever seen and

323
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,340
you would never guess want
to give you a hundred tries.

324
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,290
Me and him were in Toronto.

325
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,090
Give you a hundred tries.

326
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,240
Jake shields,

327
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,000
so I would imagine just Asian.

328
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,560
So he's a handsome Asian girls.

329
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,900
He's doing something you thought
he's Tom Cruise up in that bitch.

330
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,190
They scheels a very handsome guy.

331
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,043
I mean he's cool,

332
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,871
but he was like,

333
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,051
Hey,

334
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:50,120
I need you to be my wing
man and help me out here.

335
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,133
I was like,

336
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,891
what do you mean be?

337
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:52,724
Say it's cool.

338
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,260
Like you don't think
that's a good looking guys,

339
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,800
not Luke Rockhold Oh,

340
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,010
come

341
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,400
on.

342
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:56,881
I wouldn't say,

343
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:57,631
is that handsome there?

344
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:57,900
I said,

345
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,231
oh,

346
00:08:58,231 --> 00:08:59,310
he's not as hands on with Luke.

347
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:00,144
Rockhold is ridiculous.

348
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,993
The time piece.

349
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,540
He's a straight coupon level,

350
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,403
that's for sure.

351
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,150
And your bonds a straight model.

352
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,070
He's alive and he's talking about,

353
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:12,210
those guys will tell you know the story
about Alan's Siobhan had a big photo

354
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:15,300
shoot in New York City like
two weeks before his fight,

355
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:16,650
so he had a cut weight twice.

356
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,790
She cuts wait for his photo shoots.

357
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,760
He gets shredded for his photo shoots.

358
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,630
I talked to Kenny Johnson
about his wrestling coach.

359
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:23,401
Is Versace,

360
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:23,760
right?

361
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,031
Yeah.

362
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,740
He's got a big fucking campaign man.

363
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,990
He's going to make bank Dan.

364
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:30,840
He's a beautiful person and not just the
way he looks the most like it's a great

365
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:31,674
guy,

366
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,381
great guy.

367
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:33,090
His heart.

368
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,180
He's the sweetest guy and a young don fry.

369
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,340
He's such a nice guy,

370
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,030
like to train with and everything too.

371
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:40,170
He's so polite.

372
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,610
He's just a great guy.

373
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,331
Like Alan Jaeger.

374
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,470
Bands are salt of the earth.

375
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,280
I agree.

376
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,050
But anyway,

377
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,230
it doesn't get any better looking

378
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,993
bitch.

379
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,170
Jake shields is a mate that's strong.

380
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:52,451
Yeah,

381
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:53,760
he's a strong strong.

382
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Can you help me out here?

383
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,033
I say,

384
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:57,980
Oh,

385
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,720
come on.

386
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,553
Come on,

387
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,770
take yourself.

388
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,610
I'll give you a hit of weed

389
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,660
out sambo five I'm now fears
don't hell critical to help.

390
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,580
He's a nine girls like fucked up years.

391
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,680
Curls like the giant,

392
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:21,450
like a guy who's been through some danger.

393
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,580
They don't like a guy who
was terrified of danger.

394
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,560
It's a natural instinctive reaction.

395
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,030
It's to protect your genetics.

396
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:31,050
A guy who has never experienced danger
may very well fall apart in the face of

397
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:31,800
danger.

398
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,700
So a guy who does crazy shit
like does flips in bikes.

399
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,810
Why do you think they do that?

400
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:40,650
They do that because it attracts females
because females are attracted to a guy

401
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,060
who's very risky.

402
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,200
The guy who takes chances and does nutty
shit because those guys can survive

403
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:46,980
pressure.

404
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,700
That makes sense.

405
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,710
I'm just saying with all the UFC fighters,

406
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:51,390
I'd give myself a five because we're all,

407
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:51,691
you know,

408
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:54,000
we're all [inaudible] be a solid eight.

409
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:54,181
Yeah,

410
00:10:54,181 --> 00:10:55,014
about that.

411
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,880
[inaudible] saw an eight
maybe eight and a half,

412
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:57,720
but you're better.

413
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:57,871
You're,

414
00:10:57,871 --> 00:10:59,370
you're a notch better than Jake shields.

415
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:00,420
Cause you're way bigger than them.

416
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,830
Like I see girls look at you.

417
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:02,664
It's hilarious.

418
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:02,850
It's,

419
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,940
I'm looking at in their
little ovaries go hungry eyes.

420
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,953
Oh Shit.

421
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,070
Every parents,

422
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,000
everything we've done,

423
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,680
not just fighter and the kid fence.

424
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,960
My,

425
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,793
a friend of mine,

426
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,100
he's never even met shop before.

427
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,551
It was like,

428
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:15,384
who is your friend?

429
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,930
If you could tell her a little loins were

430
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,820
tender at the comedy store,

431
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:25,790
a bartender comments are
accountable now till fucking bro.

432
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,013
That's awesome.

433
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:27,963
Oh my gosh.

434
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,210
See I was already talking about her.

435
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,830
I'm just saying general mother fucker,

436
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,671
the waitress at the,

437
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:32,791
uh,

438
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,830
the waiters [inaudible] one of
the waitresses at the cottonwood.

439
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,870
How about nothing?

440
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,793
I would say,

441
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,970
what's a 10 Jovan?

442
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:42,721
He's up there.

443
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:44,090
Saatchi not lesson.

444
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,390
Well,

445
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,290
you're being kind of chops
and a good looking at,

446
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,280
he's got personality.

447
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,320
Personality means more than two points.

448
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:53,500
It does an eight.

449
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:53,891
Look at that.

450
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:54,724
Alan Japan.

451
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,140
Lord,

452
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,340
that's not even a real person.

453
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,680
Tell me he should at least tell me.

454
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:00,460
It's five [inaudible] eight tall,

455
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:01,294
six feet.

456
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,180
He just did the campaign for an equinox.

457
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,750
Alan Joe Ban Hater.

458
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:10,720
You fucking hate people because he's
one of the best people I've ever met.

459
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,501
I agree.

460
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:12,311
Just a great,

461
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:12,921
great dude.

462
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:13,960
It's fucking great guy.

463
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,160
Can't say anything bad about them.

464
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,941
If I look like that,

465
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:17,260
I'd wake up every morning and be like,

466
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,550
this going to be a good day.

467
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,391
I'm telling you though.

468
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:20,800
I mean he's not a pretty boy.

469
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,240
I mean this mother fuckers and scrap
some serious fights and he bites down on

470
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:26,074
that mouthpiece.

471
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,863
Very good fighter.

472
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,320
He fought to men off man to man off
is a mother fucker dude motherfucker.

473
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,350
I just liked that match up.

474
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,520
His efficiency and his stroke
is a tough fight for anybody.

475
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,020
Especially tough fight when you start.

476
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,940
He cut week two weeks but no,

477
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:40,960
he got knocked out in the first round.

478
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,071
No,

479
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:41,170
no,

480
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:41,350
no.

481
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,300
I'm saying not the result.

482
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:44,200
I'm saying on paper.

483
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:45,370
That's a tough fight to pick.

484
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,230
I wouldn't have taken it and if I,

485
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:47,910
if I was in there,

486
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,160
if I'm Joe man and I just
[inaudible] I wouldn't have taken it.

487
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,830
I wouldn't have taken it
because I don't think,

488
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,371
it's not that.

489
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:55,630
I don't think he could beat that guy.

490
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,870
I just think right now men off striking
is so smooth and efficient and heavy and

491
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,370
down the pipe string.

492
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,490
It's also very fluid.

493
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,620
Like he can go from throwing a jab to
throw in a lead up or cut in a straight

494
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:14,740
right hand and every one of
them is perfect and they count,

495
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:15,821
they count,

496
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,720
they're accurate and the mechanics
behind them are totally Crary.

497
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:20,080
Dude.

498
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,240
Like there's guys that
probably hit harder.

499
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:24,790
Like Tyron Woodley probably
hits harder than anybody.

500
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,370
Tyron Woodley like one shot for one shot.

501
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,700
Like when when he KLJ heroin,

502
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,161
I was like,

503
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:31,390
Jesus Christ,

504
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,610
he doesn't explode.

505
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,820
Exploder dude,

506
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,850
if he catches you perfectly
on that explosion,

507
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:37,684
he's going to put you away.

508
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,650
And it's not saying that like his
efficiency is bad cause efficiencies way

509
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:46,540
better even now because he's training
with Duke Roufus but to Nofx doesn't have

510
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,850
that one shot power that Woodley has,

511
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,980
but his efficiency is perfect.

512
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,900
Everything is perfect.

513
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,910
You see a guy that hits hard,

514
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:57,640
one of the things you see
almost invariably is there.

515
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,920
Their body positioning is always perfect.

516
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,490
Like when when a guy's throwing
like a ridiculous punch,

517
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,260
you'll see the bend in the legs,

518
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,710
you'll see the term body.

519
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,790
You know when a guy's like a serious
power Stryker with two Manav,

520
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,810
everything's in place.

521
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,000
It's all like the knees in the right spot.

522
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,990
When the hook,

523
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,830
when he's throwing the hook,

524
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:15,830
his foot's in the right spots,

525
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,080
waits in the right spot.

526
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,280
There's no like,

527
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,460
no bullshit.

528
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,780
Then he'd come out of the
Russian amateur boxing his thing.

529
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,310
He's a master of sports and boxing.

530
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,420
They keep fucking kicked too,

531
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:25,751
man.

532
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,470
He can Kish there was amazing.

533
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,330
Here's a program.

534
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,830
Yeah,

535
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,110
it's,

536
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,750
he's unexpectedly
dangerous with his kicks,

537
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:33,050
but he lost his last fight.

538
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,970
I didn't know.

539
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,151
No,

540
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:36,270
he beat a lark and that's right.

541
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:37,390
But it wasn't a great course.

542
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,700
It wasn't a great fight.

543
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,950
I love that fight really so close
because they're so dangerous.

544
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,090
We do a fight campaigning for that.

545
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:43,991
I don't think so.

546
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:44,870
This was the one with Lorens.

547
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,210
Lark was throwing those wheel kits.

548
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,351
That's right.

549
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:48,820
And Feminine Up is fucked up,

550
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,040
but to Nauv hung in there to the

551
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,830
end and one is super close fight.

552
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,800
I honestly thought that
Larkin pulled it off,

553
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,090
but I wasn't upset at the
decisions are so close.

554
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,850
It's so weird.

555
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:02,750
Those does low.

556
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:03,201
We'll kicks.

557
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,060
He does all kinds of weird,

558
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,080
skewed is a bad mother fucker dude.

559
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,780
He's one of the dark
horses in that division.

560
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,740
His take down defense.

561
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,600
I'm till I haven't seen
anything like in a long time.

562
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,670
He came up to rain to train with Munios.

563
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,220
Pat comes and myself
and his wrestling day.

564
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,851
I was like,

565
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:16,971
oh,

566
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:18,260
we're just going to take this full down.

567
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,210
Well I don't want to take it up by really
large was going to have the Kiki and

568
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:23,080
advantage in two minutes.

569
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,130
It's going to have the striking
advantage and that's how it turned out.

570
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,680
But God damn was a close ass fight.

571
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,390
Laura Larkin actually has braces and
during the fight is fucking braces were

572
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,590
sticking into his mouth.

573
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,311
Oh my God.

574
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:35,990
If something went wrong with his braces,

575
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,570
he was like trying to
fix it in between rounds.

576
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,710
Fucking Ufo with brace.

577
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,820
He shouldn't be fighting with braces or
Invisalign and he's very good looking

578
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:44,320
man.

579
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,330
He is the frank shamrock
racist and needs him.

580
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,930
The silver mouth,

581
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,680
I don't know.

582
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,041
I don't know.

583
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,490
I didn't see it until a,

584
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,130
they're talking about
an in between rounds.

585
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,993
The corner.

586
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,600
I still feel bad about
myself after seeing has got,

587
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,150
I wonder if Bella tours getting let
Benson Henderson fight with a toothpick in

588
00:15:59,151 --> 00:15:59,984
his mouth.

589
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,000
Three of them do whatever
the fuck he wants.

590
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,463
He's going,

591
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,510
Oh shit.

592
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,190
Oh,

593
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,870
he's covering heads up really bad.

594
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,081
Oh,

595
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,070
he's come on pile.

596
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,833
Don't get too crazy.

597
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,710
Oh,

598
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,150
it's three Oh one right now.

599
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:17,240
Three two 59 to 58 to 57 St.

600
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:20,090
That shit up a Mike Pyle
versus John Spencer.

601
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:20,924
Is that is fighting?

602
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,183
Is that the uh,

603
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,671
just got stocks.

604
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:24,490
Spencer got rock.

605
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:24,850
Is it?

606
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,090
Oh,

607
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:25,521
his name.

608
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:26,690
We shouldn't say that's his name.

609
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,340
[inaudible] oh shit.

610
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,333
Um,

611
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,690
Ben Henderson's fighting for
already for the title shot.

612
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:32,871
Right.

613
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:33,650
And he fighting Brooks.

614
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,350
Do you know that's like secretly my
biggest fear is he going to fight for the

615
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,184
title?

616
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,240
It's next month.

617
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,820
My biggest fear is for getting what
someone's name is in the middle of the

618
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,181
fight.

619
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:42,200
We'll calling the five cat.

620
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,840
Good thing you don't have the headroom.

621
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,683
How you doing?

622
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,560
Good thing dark.

623
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,650
I have Alpha brain and notes.

624
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,540
You got enough for
preying on you right now.

625
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,280
I could use some of that right now.

626
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,240
Um,

627
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,073
where's the chug?

628
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,921
It should be a jug of it.

629
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:55,754
Yeah,

630
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,450
there it is.

631
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,240
Good fights tonight man.

632
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:00,260
The best stuff is the,

633
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:00,891
the new stuff.

634
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:02,440
We have an instance.

635
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,420
The Shit I take for instance,

636
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:06,290
stuff is awesome.

637
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,810
I love from happening here too,

638
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:10,460
that Kyle Kingsbury on the other day,

639
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,680
he's the best great guy.

640
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,401
Oh my God.

641
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:14,270
What a sweetheart.

642
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,390
So fucking smart to his
wife is a smoke show.

643
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:19,700
3002 she used to be UFC ring card.

644
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:20,400
Yes.

645
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,770
It's very cool chick to
like real whole family.

646
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:23,540
Just good people.

647
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:23,790
They're,

648
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,531
they're salted.

649
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:25,220
The earth.

650
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,390
What'd you call so cool.

651
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,630
Salt of the earth dams.

652
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,820
I said smoke show.

653
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,773
Oh smoke show.

654
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,890
Salto their smoke show.

655
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,700
Um,

656
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:31,861
mine.

657
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:32,780
Mine's more old school.

658
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,120
You're just probably better.

659
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:35,540
Yeah,

660
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,880
she's just really sweet person too.

661
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,350
It's cool seeing them parents too.

662
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,630
It's wild because they have to or no one,

663
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,350
one little boy.

664
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:42,651
God,

665
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:43,580
he's so fucking cute.

666
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,680
You just start smoking weed like recently,

667
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:45,890
right?

668
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,650
And kind of like a,

669
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,330
I don't think so.

670
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:47,780
No,

671
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:47,991
no.

672
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:49,010
He does everything.

673
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,760
He's big in the IOWASCA.

674
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,113
Thomas was like,

675
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,393
shit,

676
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,810
I was under the impression.

677
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,981
Just started.

678
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:57,060
What do you mean like,

679
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,680
or maybe it's the week
before he did a bunch of uh,

680
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,680
Wasco and then flop pat.

681
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,471
Oh yeah.

682
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:07,470
Molly walked by Pat I had is a mother
corner pattern that fight pat Cummings is

683
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:08,130
a motherfucker.

684
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,350
Look how smart Mike Pilot.

685
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:10,360
It's like Oh,

686
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,820
efficient and smooth,

687
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,571
you know,

688
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:14,250
sees the shots he slips him like,

689
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,810
and he's in real good shape.

690
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:16,710
I mean don't get me wrong,

691
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:20,340
but that's just a reality about what a
40 year old body can do as far as the way

692
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:21,330
he pushes himself.

693
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,810
Like that was what recovery and
stuff are Nard Hopkins back.

694
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,591
You know,

695
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:29,960
like Bernard Hopkins just couldn't keep
a pace with a guy like surrogate Kovalev

696
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:30,070
off.

697
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,370
Like he had to go and do like
a defensive mode against him.

698
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,270
It was tough to watch,

699
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,820
but it was because he was 49 years old.

700
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,510
If he fought Kovalev
when he was 35 Holy Shit.

701
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:40,870
That would have been an amazing fight.

702
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,430
Fight,

703
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,781
amaze.

704
00:18:41,781 --> 00:18:43,650
You see Cole of less white dude.

705
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,461
What the fuck?

706
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:45,570
He's a murderer.

707
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,640
Him and at him and Andre Ward.

708
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:48,270
That's the fight.

709
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,500
He killed the guy in the ring.

710
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:49,681
Yeah,

711
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:50,460
he did.

712
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,170
And it didn't kill the guy.

713
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,320
Yeah.

714
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,570
It didn't affect him the
way it affects most people.

715
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,530
It's very interesting.

716
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,710
I get it hurted Russia.

717
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,061
Yeah.

718
00:18:57,061 --> 00:19:00,240
It didn't take anything off of his
desire to compete does not give a fuck.

719
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:00,540
He,

720
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,051
that's a,

721
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:04,380
that's one thing that happens
to fight or sometimes and man,

722
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:04,900
they're,

723
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,840
they're rarely the same
after someone dies.

724
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,480
Zany.

725
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:07,951
That happened.

726
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:09,780
He was never really the smell Griffith.

727
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,061
They say that,

728
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:11,750
that uh,

729
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,000
you know,

730
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,070
Emil Griffith's they say was
gay and that Benny Perez,

731
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,840
the guy who was fighting was talking to
a lot of shit about him being gay and

732
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:23,841
was saying a lot of like gay slurs and
Ameel Griffith beat the fuck out of that

733
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:24,530
dude.

734
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:24,771
I mean,

735
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:25,350
he died,

736
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,400
he died him to death.

737
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,303
They beat him to death.

738
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,863
Yeah.

739
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,140
I don't remember what round was.

740
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:31,590
If I went,

741
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,251
if I had a guest,

742
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:33,690
I want to say it was like the 14th round,

743
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,250
there's a documentary on boom,

744
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:35,580
boom.

745
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,200
Saying how when that guy died,

746
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:38,100
he was never the same.

747
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:38,511
Oh yeah,

748
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,344
of course.

749
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,470
He didn't want to find fighters and by
I think the guy's name is bond key moon

750
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:44,151
or something like that.

751
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:44,330
Cool.

752
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,330
Kim Duck who came,

753
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:46,260
that's what I was packing.

754
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:51,261
My boy you were close by king man is he
works as the is I think it's the correct

755
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:51,610
number,

756
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,940
the UN or something.

757
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,000
Um,

758
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,421
he was,

759
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:54,870
um,

760
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,681
his dad was his,

761
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:55,890
uh,

762
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,990
his dad was his coach.

763
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,010
Boom.

764
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,840
I know.

765
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,710
Uh Oh Jesus Christ.

766
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:02,241
Summer man.

767
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:03,660
Well that was another extreme.

768
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,710
Dehydration fight.

769
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,540
Extremely dehydrated.

770
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,540
You get down to one 35.

771
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:07,650
[inaudible]

772
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,950
shit was on national TV.

773
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,580
He also had weigh ins
the day of the fights.

774
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,660
It's a terrible idea.

775
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,411
They did.

776
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:15,240
Somebody did something I read
and I don't know if it's true,

777
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:19,080
but they said that pretty sure I remember
a number of people who've died in the

778
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:20,640
ring had dad's for their coach,

779
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,280
you know,

780
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,113
don't push themselves.

781
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,783
They're not a lot.

782
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,080
But apparently that's,

783
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,990
it's very common for guys
to push themselves to,

784
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:30,270
they get really hurt because
their dad's in the corner.

785
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,601
Well,

786
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:32,250
Wonderboy Thompson is trained by his dad,

787
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:33,970
isn't he?

788
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,230
Yeah,

789
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,470
yeah,

790
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,100
that's right.

791
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,120
And so sage,

792
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,500
sage,

793
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,240
Northcutts Dad,

794
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,133
um,

795
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,940
he's been Darren Cruickshank
trained by his dad.

796
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,710
You think sage is,

797
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:44,544
uh,

798
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,120
all the,

799
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,490
all the flak he's getting
on the Internet is just,

800
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,360
what do you think about that?

801
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,661
No,

802
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:50,021
listen,

803
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:52,360
I think like if you ask any fighter,

804
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:52,871
hey,

805
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:55,390
if Dane off do you 1440
going to take it at 19.

806
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,223
Fuck yes.

807
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,071
It's not his fault.

808
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:58,060
This whole hype machine.

809
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,170
Well you know what man,

810
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,980
it's uh,

811
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,070
it was a good fight for him to experience,

812
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:03,640
to learn.

813
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,770
That's all he needs to learn some,

814
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,161
you know,

815
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:08,380
some ground defense and he
needs to learn some Jujitsu,

816
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:09,700
but that's to be expected.

817
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,880
He's only fucking 19 years old Jim.

818
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,280
All the top guys that are good at you get,

819
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:13,960
I get caught.

820
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,250
I think it was the best
thing to happen to.

821
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:19,330
Sky's the limit though as far as he's
essential at 19 years of agency to have a

822
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:20,350
very good attitude.

823
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,720
He's a smart kid at like athletically.

824
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:23,680
He's ridiculous.

825
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:24,660
Fucking,

826
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,100
if you see those flush front flips,

827
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:26,860
it's crazy.

828
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,590
Off One off the toe off one
toe on the way he does it.

829
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:30,880
It looks like it looks fake.

830
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,080
It looks like he's on a stick.

831
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,040
You're spinning.

832
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,030
I'm like one of those uh,

833
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,990
foosball tables.

834
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:35,081
Yeah.

835
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:38,050
He said he was on antibiotics too in
that fight cause he looked like shit.

836
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,610
I mean we had strep.

837
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,810
It was one of the reasons why apparently
he tapped so quickly cause like when it

838
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:44,860
was clamping on his throat,

839
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:45,700
he was already swollen.

840
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:46,750
His throat was already fucked up.

841
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,613
He had strep.

842
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,030
He's going to be fine.

843
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,811
He gets a lot of,

844
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:50,410
hey,

845
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,061
it's a lot of head.

846
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:52,330
Of course it's tough.

847
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:52,780
Like,

848
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,440
uh,

849
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,160
like you see Tony Ferguson made a video
videos like I tapped out like a bitch.

850
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,560
It's tough if you're a guy like
Tony Ferguson who's grinding,

851
00:21:59,570 --> 00:21:59,950
right,

852
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,170
he doesn't get nowhere near as much love.

853
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,120
Well like sage,

854
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:03,791
you know,

855
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:07,600
Tony Ferguson is in the PR business
as well as in the fight business.

856
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:09,640
That's the reality and
the post McGregor error.

857
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,140
You're in the PR business,

858
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:11,410
man.

859
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,550
Look what Conor Mcgregor did.

860
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,240
He's a,

861
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,600
Ooh,

862
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,201
my pile.

863
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:15,140
Got a good gay teens.

864
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,290
Got An Amo scooting in here.

865
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,601
Look at,

866
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:18,460
I'm scooting in here.

867
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,331
Watch that.

868
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:19,961
Right Butterfly.

869
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:20,621
He will mount.

870
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:21,454
He will fucking,

871
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,033
aw,

872
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,370
you missed it.

873
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,113
Missed the mount.

874
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,800
It was smart.

875
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,340
Bloody wrapping it all.

876
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:28,540
Yeah.

877
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,450
He's a bad motherfucker.

878
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,303
Mike Pyle,

879
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,860
he fought rampage Jackson
like in 2013 pro fights.

880
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,100
It was his first pro fight was
rampage Jackson in Tennessee.

881
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,620
Rampage is way bigger than he is.

882
00:22:40,621 --> 00:22:41,020
Yup.

883
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,320
Yup.

884
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,370
I'm telling you Mike Pyle and that was
one of the reasons that Matt Brown was

885
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:47,290
like so respectful about
him after the fight.

886
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:47,501
He's like,

887
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,840
people don't know how good Mike Pyle is.

888
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,520
I guess in the training room too.

889
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:52,240
He's even better.

890
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,070
I guess he's up mother fucker right here.

891
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,031
They say in the train room,

892
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:59,050
he's like unstoppable telling the TRT
is designed for dudes like this can't do

893
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:02,050
it anymore and now they have fun.

894
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,250
They have testing rates.

895
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:03,520
Yes.

896
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:03,890
Yes.

897
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:07,210
They have a testing HGH that
gets you from 21 days out.

898
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,450
Why tell you're really fun.

899
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:10,180
It used to be like a day.

900
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,550
How do they to be like
24 I do shit anymore.

901
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,443
Can't do shit.

902
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,953
Gene doping be,

903
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,061
well,

904
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,540
I told you Novitsky said that they've
already at least theoretically have

905
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,840
testosterone that's derived from
animals instead of wild yams.

906
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,660
So the carbon isotope tests hasn't work.

907
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,231
Yeah,

908
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:27,470
it looks like human testosterone.

909
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,030
Wow.

910
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,380
Dirty bird shit.

911
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:30,460
Your names the dirty bird.

912
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,171
Yeah,

913
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:33,940
but it does of course

914
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,690
Mike Pyle,

915
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,910
Shawn Spencer throwing down man,

916
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,520
props to Spencer for surviving that.

917
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,860
That exchange just fights in Vegas.

918
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,501
Yeah.

919
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:46,050
This is at the

920
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:46,821
[inaudible] stadium.

921
00:23:46,821 --> 00:23:47,930
Looks empty.

922
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:48,411
It's empty.

923
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:50,510
But I'm sure when the
main event dropped out,

924
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:52,190
I'm sure a lot of people
canceled their trips,

925
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,521
do it.

926
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:53,440
I'm not mad at for doom.

927
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,470
I was gonna tell you
about at the beginning.

928
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:54,710
Yeah,

929
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,740
it makes sense because since
he's the heavyweight champ,

930
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,980
the way it works out a lot of times is
you get a percentage of paper views,

931
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,570
but you have to hit a certain number.

932
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:02,960
Right.

933
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,410
It's hard to market steep a
verse for Doom on two weeks.

934
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:06,590
Yeah.

935
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,570
He's not going to hit those papers.

936
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,404
You numbers.

937
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,021
So when he was like,

938
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:09,171
oh,

939
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:09,561
I'm out.

940
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:09,801
I was like,

941
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:10,760
that's fucking brilliant.

942
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,870
But he's definitely hurt.

943
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,920
I'm the word that I'm hearing from
everybody said he's fucking hurt and he's

944
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:16,110
out.

945
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,870
He's been having some back
problems for a while now.

946
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:21,510
Apparently he was having it on
one side of his back and uh,

947
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,580
it would lock up,

948
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:23,630
but he was working through it and he,

949
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,010
Oh shit.

950
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,380
Oh Shit.

951
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,214
He got some

952
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,430
shit.

953
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,150
Ow.

954
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,333
Ow.

955
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,323
Ow.

956
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,233
Stop it.

957
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,073
Oh.

958
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:37,911
Oh Man.

959
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:38,744
John Spencer's,

960
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,650
who's the RAF is that you

961
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,440
stop loving son.

962
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,000
That's a brutal pile.

963
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:47,691
Just looked at him.

964
00:24:47,691 --> 00:24:48,310
Stop it.

965
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,970
[inaudible] he's not defending himself.

966
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,570
Eve Levine let shit who Talla is,

967
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,413
but you keep that was,

968
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,200
that was not good.

969
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,033
I agree.

970
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,491
But you don't,

971
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:56,620
if you've got eve Levina as your rep,

972
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:56,870
you're like,

973
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,051
oh,

974
00:24:57,051 --> 00:24:58,490
I'm about to get you fucked up.

975
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,720
It's a violent sport.

976
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,940
It is about to happen.

977
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:01,160
Yeah,

978
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,060
but we can prevent bad.

979
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,820
He doesn't know what five of those
shots and some of that pressure,

980
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,081
dude,

981
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:09,290
four or five of those shots,

982
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,770
he's been a ref for fucking the pressures.

983
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,500
If he would have stopped it
early and everyone found no,

984
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:13,761
no,

985
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:13,980
no.

986
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,050
What he gave a fuck.

987
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:15,860
That guy was out.

988
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,580
I guys in trouble rather have it go a
little late then we'll know that hurts the

989
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:19,910
sport.

990
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,510
My man,

991
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:20,681
that's,

992
00:25:20,681 --> 00:25:21,050
that's a hurdle.

993
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:21,710
Fucking sport.

994
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,330
I disagree.

995
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,390
How is that hurting the sport?

996
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,160
Are you getting paid little violence?

997
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,431
Yeah,

998
00:25:25,431 --> 00:25:27,470
but a little late is unnecessary.

999
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:28,460
That wasn't that late man.

1000
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:29,670
That was a very entertaining,

1001
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:34,671
I might be one last fight on
[inaudible] is what we pay for theirs.

1002
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,530
You know what?

1003
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,090
It's real subjective Eddie cause
you're right in a lot of ways.

1004
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,000
But then again like there's guys
that survive it like Frankie Edgar,

1005
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,510
right?

1006
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,070
If you stopped every fight with Frankie,

1007
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:43,940
Edgar was wobbled,

1008
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,220
you'd be in jail.

1009
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,770
I mean he would never be gray Maynard
and that second fight by Kao Cause he got

1010
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:51,760
hurt hard in that first round
and a lot of trigger happy would,

1011
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:52,970
would've pulled the trigger on that fight.

1012
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:54,410
And there's a shitload
of fights like that.

1013
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:55,490
There was a whole list of them.

1014
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,443
But this one,

1015
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,280
this one is prolonged would,

1016
00:25:58,281 --> 00:25:59,780
this is my problem with this.

1017
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,450
He's not hitting back and
he's not defending him.

1018
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,170
How's he going to win?

1019
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,040
He's not doing anything.

1020
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,210
He's just taking shots.

1021
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,560
He's not [inaudible],

1022
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,373
but

1023
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,470
those last shots,

1024
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,430
he's not moving.

1025
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,780
He's not moving at all.

1026
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,640
He's just surviving on its [inaudible].

1027
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,240
Celebrity Rehab was definitive call.

1028
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,380
It wasn't on the fence.

1029
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:23,060
It's not because a little over the fence.

1030
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,340
That's why there's subjective thinking,

1031
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:25,710
dude,

1032
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,490
how different different points of view.

1033
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:29,324
But you know,

1034
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,290
I see your argument.

1035
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,501
Well,

1036
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,960
we got to realize why
are we watching this?

1037
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:33,794
We're watching,

1038
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,900
we're watching this for brutality.

1039
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,201
Right,

1040
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:40,450
but you got to protect the guy when the
highlights or I'll buy it from his own

1041
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,323
timeline.

1042
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,920
That's a beautiful highlight.

1043
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:45,843
Highlight,

1044
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,343
highlight,

1045
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:47,910
highlight,

1046
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,450
highlight.

1047
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,320
If you stopped it,

1048
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,510
three punches before it still highlight.

1049
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:51,811
Yes,

1050
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:52,410
I agree.

1051
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,570
I agree to take on to,

1052
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,750
but it's not the worst.

1053
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,820
That was up the worst dot.

1054
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:55,951
Oh,

1055
00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:56,730
not at all.

1056
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,740
Like you know what's worse?

1057
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,633
You know what was worse?

1058
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,180
Rockhold and Chris Weidman,

1059
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:01,290
100% was worse.

1060
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,210
It was a site that should have been
stopped 100% when they weren't.

1061
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,400
When he was on top of them.

1062
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:05,941
I was saying,

1063
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:08,990
what does Luke Rockhold have
to do to get a stoppage?

1064
00:27:08,991 --> 00:27:09,780
Cause this is a,

1065
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,591
this is terrible.

1066
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:12,210
Like Chris Weidman is taken damaged.

1067
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:13,600
It's unnecessary.

1068
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:14,580
I'm not just unnecessary,

1069
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:17,640
but most likely when you
take get beaten up like that,

1070
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:18,450
you're not going to recover.

1071
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,950
But really there've been many,

1072
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:23,970
many fights where they could have easily
stopped it and the guy came back to

1073
00:27:23,971 --> 00:27:25,410
rock cars are loud.

1074
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,841
Yes,

1075
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:26,460
Joe.

1076
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,170
There's a lot of fights like that.

1077
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,010
You got to let it go for
the fans and pisses depends.

1078
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,940
65 fucking dollars now come on.

1079
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:33,690
We don't want,

1080
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,630
we'd rather have them
be taken serious early,

1081
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,973
late low.

1082
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,100
Early is always going to win.

1083
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:42,630
I think Brock Lesnar Brock Lesnar looked
better versus Shane carbon didn't.

1084
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:43,464
Weidman did.

1085
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,910
Oh hundred percent there
really wasn't any damage.

1086
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:46,230
Right.

1087
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,520
He's getting hit but covering up,

1088
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:48,390
but there's no blood.

1089
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:48,841
But he was,

1090
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:49,980
he looked like he was there.

1091
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,251
Yes,

1092
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,110
he Weidman was calling.

1093
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,920
Thumped on face was literally like
someone shot him with the greatest moments

1094
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,120
and made a bunch of
peanuts because of that.

1095
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,520
That's why the fuck,

1096
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,390
that's why.

1097
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,020
That's why hardly nobody's doing MMA.

1098
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,490
Cause did the brutality.

1099
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:06,060
That's why.

1100
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,280
That's why people are paying $65 for it.

1101
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,450
If it was all decisions,

1102
00:28:09,451 --> 00:28:10,380
no one would pay for anything.

1103
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,600
If it was a scroll that regardless,

1104
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,740
that wasn't that bad.

1105
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,380
We don't have to argue about it.

1106
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:17,790
I see Eddie's point of view and I,

1107
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:18,210
I'm,

1108
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,100
I'm leaning more towards your side.

1109
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,920
I think maybe it could have stopped it
because you're just standing there taking

1110
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:23,730
shots.

1111
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,690
He wasn't moving.

1112
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:28,500
No head trauma guys just stand there
taking shots and he's not moving.

1113
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,000
He's waiting for the referee stopped.

1114
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,650
He was standing fully erect.

1115
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,820
He wasn't walking

1116
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,730
stud.

1117
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,481
He's a stud.

1118
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,600
He's in excellent shape but
that's how a lot of guys die.

1119
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,570
Like a lot of the guys that
have died from getting beat up,

1120
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,620
they didn't go down.

1121
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,850
They got beaten down.

1122
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:46,050
They sank into the ropes.

1123
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:47,520
How many people have died in MMA?

1124
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,710
5,000 about MMA mostly,

1125
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:50,544
but boxing,

1126
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,570
mostly boxing.

1127
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,561
Well you know,

1128
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:55,560
one of the things that MMA has going
for it is that you could fucking clinch,

1129
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,540
it's the cruelest shit ever to watch.

1130
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:01,290
A guy like rocked in a boxing match and
the referees like pulling them off and

1131
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,190
holding onto the guy.

1132
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,760
The only thing that's keeping that guy,

1133
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,760
that's the only thing keeping them alive.

1134
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:09,001
They're like,

1135
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:09,271
nope,

1136
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:10,170
you can't hang on.

1137
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,071
They're going to break up.

1138
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:11,461
Break it up.

1139
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:11,760
You're like,

1140
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,890
oh no.

1141
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,281
If you don't let go,

1142
00:29:14,281 --> 00:29:15,450
I'm going to disqualify you.

1143
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,680
Oh Shit.

1144
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,031
It's the worst.

1145
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:18,870
It's really dumb.

1146
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,000
Mike Pyle,

1147
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,250
powerful Mike Pyle is a big win for him.

1148
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,630
Congratulations to him.

1149
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,340
He's been fighting for ever man.

1150
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:27,180
40 years old.

1151
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,270
I remember the first time I
heard his name Ed clay fit.

1152
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:31,590
There's a guy from Tennessee,

1153
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:31,771
may,

1154
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:32,371
Mike Pyle,

1155
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:33,330
he trains at my gym.

1156
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,680
Watch out for this guy.

1157
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,520
This is 2001 or 2000 so long ago.

1158
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:39,810
He's 40 now.

1159
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:40,923
It's crazy.

1160
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,910
No taller than head.

1161
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:49,180
I think MMA in a way has a longer
lifespan regardless of what you're taking.

1162
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,790
Even if you're taking nothing,

1163
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,340
then boxing desk cause it's not as
completely dependent upon reflexes.

1164
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,140
There's so many different skills to learn.

1165
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,980
Oh Man.

1166
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,161
Yeah,

1167
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:58,120
it's trust is brutal.

1168
00:29:58,121 --> 00:29:59,260
See that's when he looked at the left.

1169
00:29:59,270 --> 00:29:59,700
Wait,

1170
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,533
stop.

1171
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,573
Stop.

1172
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,610
Stop wanting to make sure it,

1173
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:03,851
boom.

1174
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:04,121
Okay,

1175
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:04,660
we're done.

1176
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,590
He's still on his feet.

1177
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:06,940
Guy Wasn't doing shit though.

1178
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,980
Shaun's was just taking it because I
didn't need to take that last name.

1179
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,063
All right.

1180
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,403
Violet.

1181
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,050
Poor baby.

1182
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,010
Rip His head off.

1183
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,620
Eddie.

1184
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,421
Eddie's die.

1185
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:17,560
Rip His head off.

1186
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:18,631
It wasn't the worst,

1187
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:20,140
but just trying to be honest here.

1188
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,890
That's it.

1189
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,600
I'm just trying.

1190
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:21,750
I,

1191
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,840
I see what you're saying,

1192
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,100
but poor baby

1193
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,493
man.

1194
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,550
This guys just fought.

1195
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:28,440
It's harder like,

1196
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:29,681
hey,

1197
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:30,190
that's what,

1198
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,230
that's what people are
paying $65 and they know the,

1199
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:32,921
they know the game.

1200
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:33,521
I don't know man.

1201
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:34,510
I ain't know the game.

1202
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,680
They know it's brutal.

1203
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,170
Everybody's well aware
they're in a fucking cage,

1204
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:38,590
man.

1205
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:38,841
Dude,

1206
00:30:38,841 --> 00:30:41,650
you're throwing full blown
Shin kicks to your skull.

1207
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,120
No one's trying to stop that.

1208
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,900
That's what hurt.

1209
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:48,370
They are trying to stop that.

1210
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,990
That's the whole idea behind it.

1211
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,460
What would you rather take?

1212
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:54,190
What he went through against the fence
like that with those elbows like that and

1213
00:30:54,191 --> 00:30:58,250
you were kind of standing or Edson
Barboza just throwing a straight fucking

1214
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,570
kicking your face.

1215
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,463
That switch.

1216
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,280
That switch kicked Kira
floating around on the switch.

1217
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,153
I'm talking about,

1218
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,830
I'm talking about the
wheel kick with the heel.

1219
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:09,780
That'd be the hardest hit.

1220
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:15,050
It doesn't feel good to take those
Mike Pyle elbow all definitely.

1221
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,790
His fucking wheel kick is perfect.

1222
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,910
His switch kick in his wheelchair
collect the best I've ever seen.

1223
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,780
The fastest to eat.

1224
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,960
His leg kicks are so God
damn fast and everything.

1225
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:29,300
Barbels is probably the fastest
kicker maybe I've ever seen.

1226
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,380
I think I've ever seen
anybody kick his fastest.

1227
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,530
Him Not even close to,

1228
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,161
I can't even think.

1229
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:37,300
A lot of fucking chaos with those
wheel kicks over the last five years.

1230
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,730
Look at Wonderboy Thompson common now.

1231
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,250
Do you remember we used to talk about
it and I was like just people don't know

1232
00:31:42,251 --> 00:31:42,810
how to do it.

1233
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,090
Yeah,

1234
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:43,301
I go,

1235
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,140
people know how to do it.

1236
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:45,040
It's horrific.

1237
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:45,280
Yup.

1238
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,510
Because of it lands.

1239
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,290
I'd never seen anybody get wheel kicked
in the head by a guy who is good and not

1240
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:51,040
go out.

1241
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,210
Like when you get healed,

1242
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,560
when a heel hits your head,

1243
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,920
sometimes you catch guys with
the toes and those guys are okay,

1244
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,470
but you got to get slapped.

1245
00:31:58,471 --> 00:31:58,810
Yeah,

1246
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,990
but when a heel hits you in the head
from a guy who really knows how you got

1247
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:03,460
your boot on and you've got the bulldog,

1248
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,900
Wonderboy landed.

1249
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:05,321
No,

1250
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:05,471
no,

1251
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:05,621
no,

1252
00:32:05,621 --> 00:32:05,801
no,

1253
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:06,041
no.

1254
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,970
You had your boot on as
opposed to like this.

1255
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,241
Well,

1256
00:32:10,241 --> 00:32:10,550
the,

1257
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,580
the key is it's just
like throwing a punch.

1258
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,301
The idea,

1259
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:14,530
like when you throw in a punches,

1260
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,890
you don't want your hand completely
clinched up until you're going to make

1261
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:22,180
impact because then slows the punch down
so you're supposed to punch and then

1262
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,850
tighten your hand up
as you're about to hit.

1263
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,150
It's like kind of a timing thing and a
lot of ways you want to keep everything

1264
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:31,560
as loose as possible while
exploding in the right way.

1265
00:32:31,561 --> 00:32:32,740
It's the same thing with a kick.

1266
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,180
When you throw in that wheel kick,

1267
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:39,390
you want everything to be almost like
ballet until like halfway there and then

1268
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,900
halfway there you're pulling your leg
back and you pull it and you put in

1269
00:32:42,901 --> 00:32:45,500
pushing your foot forward and
you stick in that heel out.

1270
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,490
But it doesn't come into like there.

1271
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,580
It's like as you're in
the middle of the spin,

1272
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,590
once you get like they're,

1273
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:54,050
that's when everything
hardens up and boom,

1274
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,330
and then you come across with
a heel that's of Barboza.

1275
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:57,920
No MMA fighters.

1276
00:32:57,921 --> 00:32:59,690
We're working on that shit and

1277
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,353
fuck me,

1278
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,680
nobody was working on,

1279
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,330
everyone is now though
did PBS to make fun of it.

1280
00:33:06,331 --> 00:33:07,220
She brought it up,

1281
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:07,851
I would say,

1282
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:10,190
you know like once people
learn how to really throw,

1283
00:33:10,191 --> 00:33:10,761
spinning back,

1284
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:11,600
kick to the body,

1285
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,111
I'm like,

1286
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:13,370
it's like getting hit by a car.

1287
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,020
It was more really when people,

1288
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,820
when the people that
already know how to do it,

1289
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:18,980
learn how to wrestle and did you get to,

1290
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:22,010
so they're not afraid to throw it because
everybody that was karate guys and

1291
00:33:22,011 --> 00:33:23,180
taekwondo guys in those times,

1292
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,610
but they were told by their MMA coach,

1293
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,550
don't fucking throw that shit cause these,

1294
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,270
these guys going to take
you down to choke you out.

1295
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,530
So they were limited like,

1296
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:30,891
okay,

1297
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:31,724
we're going to keep it,

1298
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,151
you know,

1299
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:35,300
nice and simple and we're not going to
do the spin kicks that we know what to do

1300
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:36,470
because we suck on the ground.

1301
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,040
But once like Stephen
Thompson or Wonderboy,

1302
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,670
Wonderboy Ellenberg he's
good on blue motherfucker.

1303
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:44,901
Yeah,

1304
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:45,671
you guys after it,

1305
00:33:45,671 --> 00:33:49,370
Helen Burger said that it was a
waste of time to throw those things.

1306
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:49,641
He's like,

1307
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:51,950
I'm not worried about is
spinning to said waste of time.

1308
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,671
That's what he said.

1309
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:56,240
He's like that's a waste of
energy in the bend of the review.

1310
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,221
Did he really?

1311
00:33:57,221 --> 00:33:58,130
Not In the preview.

1312
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:01,850
So Wonderboy moves like a fucking snake.

1313
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,180
That's the future right there like that.

1314
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:06,140
Like Conor Mcgregor,

1315
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,820
like a Diego Brandao.

1316
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:09,460
Those guys that just throw every opened.

1317
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,873
That's Chris.

1318
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,740
He throws a lot of fun.

1319
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,700
It's a great striker,

1320
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:14,021
isn't there?

1321
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:17,670
I'm not going back to those to those
was a lot of spinning shit you throw,

1322
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:21,150
they throw some wild meat
compared to as Joanne in the wild.

1323
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,123
Did you ever,

1324
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,380
did you ever throw spitting shit
and you know what I'm saying?

1325
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,160
Never.

1326
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,220
Never ever.

1327
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,500
Why you're super athletic.

1328
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,911
No one really taught me.

1329
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:32,420
I never had,

1330
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,060
I never had a kickboxing
coach or taekwondo coach.

1331
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,470
No one ever said you should.

1332
00:34:36,471 --> 00:34:41,471
Every now and then it's good to have
a fucking game over game over a weapon

1333
00:34:41,571 --> 00:34:43,760
right there at said that we'll kick man.

1334
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,960
It's no one ever told you that,

1335
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:45,710
huh?

1336
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,490
A lot of fighters though
or don't throw much.

1337
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,210
Most I would say not 80%
still don't throw them right,

1338
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,240
so a lot of them can't.

1339
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,040
Totally project thing.

1340
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:57,140
He's had to learn a lot of time on
that shit and it's not exactly if,

1341
00:34:57,141 --> 00:34:58,160
if you're putting it in,

1342
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:02,930
you know what priorities put spinning
wheel kick number 30 is a long term

1343
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:04,460
project for such a shit.

1344
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,480
That's why it helps if you have a martial
arts background star with when you're

1345
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,050
a kid,

1346
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,400
you learn that shit first.

1347
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,390
It becomes normal.

1348
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,180
Like if you see a little four year olds
through onside kicks and then we'll

1349
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,481
kicks.

1350
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:17,840
It's hilarious and it's adorable
because their legs are so,

1351
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,580
they're so used to throw their legs.

1352
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:19,970
Yeah.

1353
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:20,350
You know,

1354
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,780
if they throw their legs up in the air
and it's normal and then as they get

1355
00:35:23,781 --> 00:35:25,070
older and their legs get heavy,

1356
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,130
their body's used to the dynamic.

1357
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,710
Habib number,

1358
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,200
Madoff and Tony Ferguson,

1359
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,550
Agler Hearns and chase.

1360
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,740
Thank God he's going
to fight Johnson again.

1361
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:36,960
I was like,

1362
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,370
what the fuck is this?

1363
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,600
Settle the fuck down.

1364
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,990
What are the odds that that fight is
really gonna take place Xero to not

1365
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,720
hurt all the time.

1366
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,130
He's unfortunately,

1367
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,570
he's super talented,

1368
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,100
but he's hurt all the time.

1369
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,120
He's going to get hurt again.

1370
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,060
Get you could get hurt again easily.

1371
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:54,620
You know what?

1372
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,260
He's going to hurt the not,

1373
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:57,094
I'd say.

1374
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,260
Which sucks.

1375
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,411
Yeah.

1376
00:35:58,411 --> 00:35:58,741
Look,

1377
00:35:58,741 --> 00:35:59,574
people get hurt,

1378
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,680
so that's a,

1379
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:06,110
there's a 50% chance of him getting
hurt or 80% let's say 60% that's a lot.

1380
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,740
That's a Fox card apparent.

1381
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:09,900
That's a lot on my calendar.

1382
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,040
At least that's a Fox card.

1383
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:13,110
I don't know if that's going
to be an fs one or Fox card.

1384
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,760
I don't think it's a,

1385
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,410
I don't think it's an Aka thing.

1386
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:17,460
How have you guys are getting hurt?

1387
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:20,880
I think Khabib and cane,

1388
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:23,940
they just have so much experience with
wrestling and doing combat sports.

1389
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,170
They're just getting up there,

1390
00:36:25,171 --> 00:36:25,470
man.

1391
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,930
They trying to train like regular dudes
and they're getting hurt while the

1392
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:28,431
people were like,

1393
00:36:28,431 --> 00:36:28,561
oh,

1394
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,400
that's gay.

1395
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,480
Habib's young guy.

1396
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,540
He has a ton of experience.

1397
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,640
Does wasn't,

1398
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,650
they're world champions,

1399
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,850
master of sports and it's
interesting because when it,

1400
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:39,723
yeah,

1401
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,040
just a wrestler and he
beat the brakes off though.

1402
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,520
He looks like when you,

1403
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:46,800
when you're watching them compete,

1404
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:47,670
he looks like a wrestler.

1405
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,450
His wrestling wrestling is
outstanding leg lock in people.

1406
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,570
Not really smashing people on the ground.

1407
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,201
Those guys,

1408
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:57,330
those guys in Russia do a
lot of Greco too though.

1409
00:36:57,331 --> 00:36:58,350
When you're Samo guy,

1410
00:36:58,351 --> 00:36:59,790
you're also doing a
lot of Greco typically.

1411
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,450
Well his,

1412
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:05,160
his clinch is insane is a bit of ability
to control from the top is insane.

1413
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:05,630
Well,

1414
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,390
which was,

1415
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,050
I was going to say about
Rockhold the other day.

1416
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:09,030
It's two fights in a row.

1417
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:14,180
Rockhold impressed me in a huge way with
his ability to control from the top we

1418
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,310
against Machida and then against
Weidman cause Machida was impressive.

1419
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:17,641
But I was like,

1420
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:18,261
I think he had,

1421
00:37:18,261 --> 00:37:20,760
but she had a fucked up before they
went to the grounds of the temple thing.

1422
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:21,660
But you don't want to the ground.

1423
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:22,410
He destroyed them.

1424
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,970
I think Maci was already fucked up,

1425
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,950
but Weidman wasn't like,

1426
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:26,210
why?

1427
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:26,641
Why me?

1428
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:29,430
He just caught a wheel kick in a fight
where there was real close fight.

1429
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,720
But once he got him on the ground,

1430
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:30,990
man,

1431
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,823
God damn,

1432
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,170
game two,

1433
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,711
I think he's,

1434
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:34,921
you know,

1435
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:38,490
he's Wyman was walking around
it in one 93 apparently.

1436
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:42,750
And I mean rock two weeks before the
fight with two 16 technique to his

1437
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:43,830
technique is nasty.

1438
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,660
You can't just say size sizes,

1439
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,191
it's conditions,

1440
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:47,611
obviously.

1441
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:47,880
God,

1442
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,840
he's also training with,

1443
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:49,201
I don't know,

1444
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,650
Daniel Cormier and came to Alaska.

1445
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:52,050
I think that's a huge part of it,

1446
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:52,650
man.

1447
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,940
I think that's a huge part
of it because like Ledcor me,

1448
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:56,700
he said when he fought John Jones,

1449
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:59,640
he didn't have cane is corners that came
was all fucked up from surgery and he's

1450
00:37:59,641 --> 00:37:59,731
like,

1451
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:00,840
I made a big impact on me.

1452
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,673
I really felt it.

1453
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,040
Whether or not that had anything to
do with him blues into Jon Jones.

1454
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:08,580
You making that face or fights and I
want to see if any job I want to see

1455
00:38:08,581 --> 00:38:09,331
Anthony Johnson,

1456
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:10,164
John Jones fight.

1457
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:10,951
Oh yeah.

1458
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:11,740
I want to see that too.

1459
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,440
That's what I want to call me a,

1460
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:13,741
uh,

1461
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:17,460
I want to see him with cane in
his corner training with him,

1462
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,660
see if that has any impact.

1463
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,730
But I'd like to go going down,

1464
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,740
right canes going through surgery.

1465
00:38:22,741 --> 00:38:24,150
Apparently it's going
to have back surgery.

1466
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,223
Really?

1467
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,400
He already had it.

1468
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:26,670
Yeah.

1469
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,390
You already had it.

1470
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,110
He already had him.

1471
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,400
What do you think about home and tape

1472
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,320
that came back?

1473
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,910
Surgeries?

1474
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,930
Not An easy thing.

1475
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,860
Like there's not like a small deal.

1476
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,880
You're taking pieces of,

1477
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,160
your disc is out for a
while at a diskectomy,

1478
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:39,460
right?

1479
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:39,970
Is that correct?

1480
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:40,540
What does that mean?

1481
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,340
That means the,

1482
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,360
the Gel that separates your discs.

1483
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:45,940
He had a piece of it removed because
it was pressing into his nerve.

1484
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,411
She's,

1485
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:49,660
it's very controversial procedure because
some people feel like you don't have

1486
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,051
to do it.

1487
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:50,890
Like Louie Simmons,

1488
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:52,540
the guy from west side Barbell,

1489
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,590
they uh,

1490
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:57,700
wanted to take him and fuse his discs
and that's why he created that machine

1491
00:38:57,701 --> 00:38:58,660
that I have outback,

1492
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,441
the hyper,

1493
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:00,070
uh,

1494
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,520
the uh,

1495
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,121
back,

1496
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:01,720
um,

1497
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,530
the fuck's it called
reverse hyper reverse.

1498
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,423
Reverse hyper.

1499
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,350
Oh,

1500
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,170
that's a big glass of
wine and not mad at that.

1501
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:07,780
Want to try and get,

1502
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,600
I hear setting that's trying
to get drums in the background.

1503
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,521
My favorite county.

1504
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:11,860
Right.

1505
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,693
Tomahawks

1506
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:15,611
brought the fire,

1507
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:16,430
get involved in the case.

1508
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,380
What do you do with Kane?

1509
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,303
You got to be careful.

1510
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,540
You got to rehab that back,

1511
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:19,781
man.

1512
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:19,961
I don't,

1513
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:22,480
I'm not necessarily a big fan
of cutting your back right away.

1514
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,410
I think you got to take some time off a
training and really heal that bitch up

1515
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:27,010
correctly.

1516
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,360
I'm pretty sure you already had surgery.

1517
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,980
Here's my thoughts though.

1518
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,870
If you want to get back
into it really quick,

1519
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:32,883
that's the way to do it.

1520
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,780
But longterm health,

1521
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,600
I'm not entirely convinced I need,

1522
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:37,751
Oh,

1523
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:38,980
obviously I'm not a doctor,

1524
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,540
but I've recovered from bulging discs.

1525
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,250
I had a bulging disc in my back
that doesn't exist anymore.

1526
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:46,630
And a bulging disc in my neck.

1527
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,920
It doesn't exist anymore.

1528
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,060
If you look at it on the Mri,

1529
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:49,923
it looks different.

1530
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,150
It's from long term Rehab.

1531
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,160
I had to take a lot of time off a rolling.

1532
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,390
I had to do spinal decompression with a,

1533
00:39:58,391 --> 00:39:59,141
I did it at a,

1534
00:39:59,141 --> 00:40:02,500
an an office with a chiropractor at
first and then I got some machines we can

1535
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,311
strap them up,

1536
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:04,090
some mechanical sheet.

1537
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,230
You strap your door at your house.

1538
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,290
I went through Regena keen injections.

1539
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:10,870
I went through a lot of rolfing and uh,

1540
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,070
like breaking apart scar tissue that
was pulling on everything and that

1541
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:16,030
everything was all fucked
up and tightened up.

1542
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,700
It was just like years and
years of wear and tear.

1543
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,160
But now through that and through yoga,

1544
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,570
I don't have any of those issues anymore.

1545
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,433
They're gone.

1546
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,750
So I don't know what his,

1547
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,100
how bad his was,

1548
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,121
but I know mine was,

1549
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:29,410
my fucking hands were numb,

1550
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:30,311
you know,

1551
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:32,770
my left hand was going down my fingers,

1552
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:33,190
my,

1553
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,270
my two fingers,

1554
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,580
my ring finger and my pinkie
finger were going numb.

1555
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,630
So let me ask you this Joe,

1556
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:38,950
what do you do with the
heavyweight division?

1557
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,150
You have their doom fight.

1558
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,920
A guy like Rothwell what cane
should concentrate on if I was cane,

1559
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,460
I mean get your body
completely fucking healthy.

1560
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,340
There's a lot of people that have like
severely criticized his strength and

1561
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:53,020
conditioning videos that are online.

1562
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:54,460
I don't know if he works
with this guy anymore,

1563
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,640
but he was working with a guy that was
like the strength and conditioning coach

1564
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:58,480
and he had him doing these,

1565
00:40:58,850 --> 00:40:59,620
you haven't seen this.

1566
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,430
Oh my God.

1567
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:00,910
Pull up.

1568
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,760
Is He doing some bullshit?

1569
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:02,603
Ain't oh yeah.

1570
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,690
Pull up cane.

1571
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,270
Uh,

1572
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,060
does a 200 pound kettle bell swings.

1573
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:12,360
His form is according to Steve Maxwell
and according to a bunch of other

1574
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:13,960
respected Kettlebell trainers,

1575
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,100
completely wrong,

1576
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,970
and this guy's got him lifting this
insane weight and doing this completely

1577
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:19,100
wrong.

1578
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,110
Almost like a shrug.

1579
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,130
He's 200 pounds.

1580
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,023
Yeah,

1581
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,920
I think it's more than 200.

1582
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:25,600
I think it's 200 plus here is,

1583
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:26,800
it's two or three pounds.

1584
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,060
So this is his train and like
I'm telling you the reviews on,

1585
00:41:31,061 --> 00:41:33,070
on youtube by people that suited.

1586
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,340
Know what the fuck they're talking about.

1587
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,323
Like watch this.

1588
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,270
He's training it looks like,

1589
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,720
but look at this like what he's doing.

1590
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:39,650
He's doing a shrug.

1591
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,640
That's not a swing.

1592
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,140
That's not as swinging on a swing.

1593
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:42,530
Yeah.

1594
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,850
No wonder you're back's fucked up.

1595
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,400
You sir,

1596
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,580
you can totally get fucked up doing this.

1597
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,600
The fuck is that.

1598
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:48,434
It's wrong.

1599
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,630
And the guy had him doing leg extensions.

1600
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,350
We'll look.

1601
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,650
The guy's obviously a big fucking
guy himself and didn't mean shipping.

1602
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,330
This is better than doing nothing.

1603
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:56,651
Right?

1604
00:41:56,651 --> 00:41:57,230
You disagree,

1605
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,360
but it's not optimal.

1606
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,310
It's not the best.

1607
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,173
He fighting

1608
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,180
100% it's a big ass kettlebell.

1609
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,070
Those bouncy balls that my son has.

1610
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,720
Yeah man,

1611
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,060
he's lost human as swinging and
then doing like an upright row row.

1612
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,391
Yeah,

1613
00:42:11,391 --> 00:42:11,571
it's,

1614
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:12,440
well it's a shrug.

1615
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,520
It's like he swings,

1616
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,121
he swings,

1617
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:15,170
he gets to wear his dick is,

1618
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:17,440
and then he showed a shitty shrug up row.

1619
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,820
It's just fucking nother kettle
but not a kettle bell swing.

1620
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,100
And it's probably not good for you.

1621
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,300
It doesn't look right.

1622
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,660
And Steve Maxwell was furious
when Steve Maxwell saw it.

1623
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:27,831
He was like that.

1624
00:42:27,831 --> 00:42:28,460
That is,

1625
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:28,850
that's like,

1626
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,430
he was like almost
essentially calling you.

1627
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,400
I'm like malpractice.

1628
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:32,960
I told them I don't have a degree in it,

1629
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:34,280
but that looks terrible.

1630
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,860
So around the weight room I
entirely fucking terrible.

1631
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:39,080
You got with Cain and you've
got to fucking super athlete.

1632
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,870
A guy who just do what you tell him
and fucking push through everything.

1633
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,200
Yeah.

1634
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,390
And that's probably one of the
reasons why he's been injured.

1635
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,460
It's cause he's pushed through some,

1636
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,380
some pain that maybe
you should lay off of.

1637
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:49,920
And I don't know.

1638
00:42:49,921 --> 00:42:50,361
Like what?

1639
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:50,571
I mean,

1640
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,730
maybe this can help me for him is perfect.

1641
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,570
Maybe it's perfect.

1642
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,570
Maybe it's a real simple thing like maybe
it's only sticking out a little bit on

1643
00:42:56,571 --> 00:42:57,320
one side.

1644
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,011
If they trim it,

1645
00:42:58,011 --> 00:42:59,180
he'll be back to training four weeks.

1646
00:42:59,181 --> 00:42:59,810
I don't know.

1647
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:04,520
But I know that for a lot
of people what you can,

1648
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,990
you can get like real hasty and make a
decision to jump into surgery and it's

1649
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:09,950
not the best decision,

1650
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,690
but especially when there's
a lot of money on the line.

1651
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,250
We have to fight though.

1652
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,930
That's the thing for a lot of these guys.

1653
00:43:14,931 --> 00:43:18,020
Like they might have to fight in six
months so you'd have to get the surgery

1654
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:21,950
because realistically with six months
of therapy you might not be ready again

1655
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:22,280
yet.

1656
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:22,491
Dude,

1657
00:43:22,491 --> 00:43:24,020
he has to fight before six months.

1658
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:25,820
The heavyweight belts
on your wait six months.

1659
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:26,361
Well,

1660
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:29,510
if his health is on the line
and going flying arm triangle,

1661
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,160
if his health is on the line,

1662
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:31,310
man,

1663
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,170
this guy's good man would wait.

1664
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:33,620
Is this,

1665
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,530
is this heavyweight two oh
five this is the main card.

1666
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:36,971
No,

1667
00:43:36,971 --> 00:43:37,320
May,

1668
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:37,611
yeah.

1669
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:39,680
Mischka Serp Serp.

1670
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:40,160
Cool.

1671
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,720
KNAUF is Russian Guy Hop Russian dud
couple of one two bodies on them.

1672
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:47,630
That was pretty brutal.

1673
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:48,710
Good hair.

1674
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,610
Good hair on that guy.

1675
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:50,631
I'm just saying,

1676
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:50,871
Joe,

1677
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:51,380
you,

1678
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,370
if he's out six months,

1679
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:53,204
you're gonna have to have it.

1680
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:53,590
Well,

1681
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,423
you don't have the title,

1682
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,403
the title,

1683
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,290
you're going to have
somebody else buy a Rothwell.

1684
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:57,910
Yeah.

1685
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:01,280
He would do both of them in that time
that it takes him to realistically come

1686
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:01,970
back.

1687
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:02,360
Yes.

1688
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,180
But he's got,

1689
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:03,861
I don't Dunno.

1690
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:05,750
He's got to be careful and he's just,

1691
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,130
he's still fairly young.

1692
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:07,281
I mean,

1693
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:08,091
I think Keynes like what?

1694
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:11,030
34 34 is a lot of experience.

1695
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:11,511
You know what I'm saying?

1696
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:12,380
Like it catches up,

1697
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,240
but he could realistically fight at the
highest level for the next three years,

1698
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,160
but these injuries,

1699
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:19,940
wow.

1700
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,540
Yeah.

1701
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,310
I Dunno.

1702
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,370
It's real controversial,

1703
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:23,750
but in my experience,

1704
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,310
talking to different doctors,

1705
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,670
there's doctors that say she gets
surgery and there's doctors should say,

1706
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:32,460
you should absolutely not concerned
scale until you've exhausted all the

1707
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,030
options.

1708
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:33,420
Yeah.

1709
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:33,820
Either way.

1710
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,420
Still in the grace of all
time heavyweights easily.

1711
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:36,871
Well,

1712
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:37,441
Jake shields,

1713
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,610
they were telling him he was fucked.

1714
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,031
What happened?

1715
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:39,990
You're telling him he couldn't,

1716
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:40,824
couldn't fight again.

1717
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,200
You should stop training
started and he was really mad.

1718
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:43,411
He's like,

1719
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:46,650
he's fucking doctors are so negative
fan because first of all they're just

1720
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:47,451
regular doctors.

1721
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,110
Dee Dee used to dealing
with regular people.

1722
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:49,290
Yeah.

1723
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:52,410
A lot of them not you stealing with the
elite athletes and guys who are willing

1724
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:54,900
to go through like the kind of rehab that
a guy like Jake shields is willing to

1725
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:58,770
go through like some serious
fucking pain and discomfort.

1726
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,031
But he got through it.

1727
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,864
He's fighting now.

1728
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:03,300
He just backed out of it.

1729
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:04,800
Is fighting a world series.

1730
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,240
Apparently it's a contract thing.

1731
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:06,990
Yep.

1732
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,190
Do you know the full details?

1733
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:09,423
I don't.

1734
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,330
Apparently what it is is it's,

1735
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,360
it's a title fight.

1736
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:16,170
So if he fights for the title because
Paul Harris got stripped this trip.

1737
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,270
Paul Harris after the John Fitch fight.

1738
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:21,000
Cause they say held it too long.

1739
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,370
Right?

1740
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:21,830
Was it a Fitch?

1741
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:22,061
Fine.

1742
00:45:22,061 --> 00:45:23,260
I thought he know

1743
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,010
his eyes.

1744
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:26,221
Yeah.

1745
00:45:26,221 --> 00:45:28,230
Stripped him after that and then,

1746
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,480
but here's the thing about that,

1747
00:45:29,481 --> 00:45:30,314
the eye gouge.

1748
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,570
Like you either stop the fight
like while it's happening.

1749
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:33,871
Yeah.

1750
00:45:33,871 --> 00:45:34,710
You don't let it go.

1751
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,450
I can't see and then to to like to
a strip of afterwards for I gouges.

1752
00:45:39,451 --> 00:45:39,781
It's weird.

1753
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,190
That's super unprecedented.

1754
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:41,341
Well,

1755
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:45,600
maybe they saw tape and realized he
was dragging his finger through it.

1756
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:46,050
He was too.

1757
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,340
He was hiding what he was doing.

1758
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:47,851
It was different.

1759
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:48,684
She'll just like,

1760
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,650
yeah,

1761
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,510
like transfer on midstream
oil and it was very evident.

1762
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:51,840
Right.

1763
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,070
Replay through one solid.

1764
00:45:53,071 --> 00:45:53,310
Yeah.

1765
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:53,750
They're just like,

1766
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:53,880
ah,

1767
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,331
you're good.

1768
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:54,811
Just keep on.

1769
00:45:54,811 --> 00:45:55,381
Keep on.

1770
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:56,160
One's a cheater.

1771
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:56,970
He was cheating.

1772
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,920
He was definitely sticking
fingers in the eye.

1773
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:00,390
That was a real bad guy.

1774
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,490
What people got mad about was the Kimora.

1775
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,840
He held the Camorra,

1776
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:06,930
but I don't think that was
that bad because the referee
was in the wrong place.

1777
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,531
The referee,

1778
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:07,831
fuck,

1779
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:08,520
don't look at it again.

1780
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,450
He's tapping his back.

1781
00:46:09,451 --> 00:46:11,610
You're expecting him to
recognize that that's a referee.

1782
00:46:11,611 --> 00:46:14,640
Tapping is back in the middle
of a ferocious cage fight.

1783
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,710
The referee supposed to be
in between the two of them.

1784
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,880
He's supposed to stop it if it
was a normal guy known for it.

1785
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,300
He's done it so often.

1786
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,470
If it was a normal guy,

1787
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,431
like if it was you,

1788
00:46:23,431 --> 00:46:25,110
if you had Mitch reone
in that same position,

1789
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:26,580
you hit that Kamora and
you held it for that long.

1790
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:27,750
Why the referee was tapping you.

1791
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,640
I do not think you'd get
the same kind of grief.

1792
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,031
I agree.

1793
00:46:30,031 --> 00:46:32,190
I think you would say I was
in the middle of the fight.

1794
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,690
I didn't even realize referees tap me.

1795
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:35,610
I didn't see him cause the
referees in the wrong place.

1796
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,990
The referee in that position,

1797
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:38,580
it's supposed to get in
between the fighters.

1798
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:41,400
He supposed to be in front so
he could look him in the eye.

1799
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:43,500
We'll pour Horace has that
Kimora he was out of place.

1800
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:44,371
He was over here.

1801
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:45,240
He's supposed to be over here.

1802
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,420
What about Paul Harris
versus Gary telling him,

1803
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,110
damn,

1804
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:49,943
I love that.

1805
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,680
Where's that taking preschool gangsters.

1806
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:53,650
Gary telenet holds.

1807
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,870
Explain to Gary.

1808
00:46:54,871 --> 00:46:55,704
Tony Blair,

1809
00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:00,180
I hope Carrie is a Jujitsu show,

1810
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,310
the Jujitsu event held in England.

1811
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,630
It's Kinda like metamorris.

1812
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,770
They have a bunch of single matches
that are submission only and I think if

1813
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:10,410
there's no submission it ends
up being a draw 20 minutes.

1814
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:11,910
It's just like metamorris in that respect.

1815
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,650
I think 1520 minutes.

1816
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:14,484
I'm like that.

1817
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,870
And they put on great shows,

1818
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:18,000
great match ups and a man,

1819
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,830
Gary Tonin is taken on.

1820
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:20,723
I saw that.

1821
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,370
That is so fucking gangster.

1822
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:23,950
I agree with.

1823
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,910
I saw scared wants to,

1824
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,010
he's the only guy that's
asking for Paul Horez.

1825
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,370
Nobody wants

1826
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:31,060
Paul Harris.

1827
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,530
Just in general buddy.

1828
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,690
The last five guys that are far powers.

1829
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,800
It's because they just,

1830
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:39,070
they offered the fucking fight to
them and had no one's going after him,

1831
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:40,050
you know,

1832
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,520
and then just graphical Horace.

1833
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:44,580
It's,

1834
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:44,771
you know,

1835
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:47,260
it's highly possible that he's
going to Eleague luck Paul Harris.

1836
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,620
But it gives you an idea how good Jake
shields was because he was beating Paul

1837
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,550
Harris up on the ground.

1838
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,870
He was controlling his body.

1839
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,791
He's unbelievable.

1840
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:55,241
Hey Jake.

1841
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:57,490
Jake shields is one of the past.

1842
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,420
Hey tone in though,

1843
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,330
when we saw him at your event,

1844
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,170
I was,

1845
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:01,330
yeah,

1846
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,470
you were talking to of mirror last time
I saw something like a motherfucker.

1847
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,330
He was eating these dudes up.

1848
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:05,921
Well.

1849
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:07,750
Then leg lock came that John Danaher,

1850
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,970
her leg lock game is very high level man.

1851
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:10,804
Him and Eddie,

1852
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,003
Eddie Cummins,

1853
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,201
the,

1854
00:48:12,201 --> 00:48:14,110
both of those guys are
fucking wizards man.

1855
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,240
And Danaher apparently
is a wizard to like,

1856
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:17,530
I never seen Donna her role,

1857
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,850
but everybody says he's just,

1858
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,350
he's sad.

1859
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:23,230
He's so God damn smart and I'll start
it with dean lister Douglas or went to

1860
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:28,260
[inaudible] in like late nineties 2000
2001 and dean lister came into the

1861
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,910
Jujitsu world already as a sambal guy.

1862
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,440
So he was always the guy,

1863
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:33,460
even as a white belt,

1864
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:35,320
as a blue belt in southern California.

1865
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:36,154
Dean,

1866
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,150
we grew up together,

1867
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:37,860
Jujitsu.

1868
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,460
He was always that leg lock dude,

1869
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:42,100
that Samo guy who got into Jujitsu.

1870
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:45,970
So that dude dean lister
goes on to win Abu Dhabi,

1871
00:48:45,971 --> 00:48:50,971
absolute leg lock and fuck and everybody
that knee bar that he hits Salo Roberto

1872
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:56,251
with Holy Shit in 2003 watch
that shit to the knee bar.

1873
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:59,800
He had solid Robero solar barrel
was like one of the best ever,

1874
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:01,780
one of the greatest players ever.

1875
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,660
And doing that.

1876
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:07,180
That knee bar that he got him with was
Gary Tone and I don't want the current

1877
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:07,690
rank are,

1878
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,590
but as he number one,

1879
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:09,640
he in person,

1880
00:49:09,641 --> 00:49:13,780
he might be the best I've ever seen
real official rankings because there's a

1881
00:49:13,781 --> 00:49:14,614
point,

1882
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,320
there's a point game and then
there's a submission only game.

1883
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:17,591
But,

1884
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:18,700
but let me finish really quick.

1885
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,571
So that guy,

1886
00:49:19,571 --> 00:49:20,440
dean lister,

1887
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:25,530
he goes to Hem Zos and Danaher's there
Danaher's a a little prodigy and he

1888
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,560
leaves an impression with a debt.

1889
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:28,970
Danner,

1890
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,130
I'm sure he left.

1891
00:49:30,131 --> 00:49:30,850
Uh,

1892
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:31,570
he left a couple,

1893
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:31,931
oh man,

1894
00:49:31,931 --> 00:49:33,000
he's fucked is Jello.

1895
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,680
And the Danaher took what he learned from
Dean lister and he just blew that shit

1896
00:49:38,681 --> 00:49:39,190
up.

1897
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,720
And Dan is like a scientist,

1898
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:43,480
I think he's a physicist
or something or so rock.

1899
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,270
Under Armour has her phd in
philosophy and something like that.

1900
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,570
Philosophy and Houston,

1901
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,940
hence I used to give him,

1902
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:49,990
hence her back.

1903
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,890
This is literally,

1904
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:51,281
I don't know,

1905
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:53,020
I've got 2003 or whatever.

1906
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,490
Hansa when somebody come into kind of
challenge and somebody who's really good,

1907
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,520
he would kind of casually give John,

1908
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:01,121
he'd said,

1909
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:03,100
roll with John for a while
and see how you do first.

1910
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,480
And John would just,

1911
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:08,740
you'd watch him tap these dudes like these
really good Samo guys or whoever they

1912
00:50:08,741 --> 00:50:09,490
were and he just,

1913
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:10,060
just like,

1914
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,230
he was moving in slow motion.

1915
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:12,603
He's a minimalist,

1916
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,300
right?

1917
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,940
He's just really smart ones.

1918
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:19,000
He was a builder or power lifter

1919
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,930
and then just ridiculous as strong and
he wanted to learn martial arts to deal

1920
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:26,764
with,

1921
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,040
like in bouncing

1922
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,581
situations,

1923
00:50:28,581 --> 00:50:30,080
he realized I should
probably have some skills.

1924
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:30,961
That's insane.

1925
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:31,250
Yeah.

1926
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:31,941
I had no idea.

1927
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:32,930
He doesn't look like it now,

1928
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:33,191
but he's,

1929
00:50:33,191 --> 00:50:34,760
he's still obviously very strong.

1930
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:35,541
If you look at him,

1931
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:36,590
he's thick and fit,

1932
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,920
but apparently he used to be like
really bad and my summer a UFC event,

1933
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:44,390
he was like at the bar afterwards and
he had on a fucking rash guard and some

1934
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:45,390
jeans tucked in.

1935
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:46,810
No fucks given me.

1936
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,320
These guys have Alzheimer's wedding.

1937
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,100
That's his thing.

1938
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,410
He was dead.

1939
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,590
So gangster always salmon.

1940
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:53,120
Her and I,

1941
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,570
every time he wasn't stop foods.

1942
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,260
Look,

1943
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,750
he's created Eddie Cummings,

1944
00:50:56,751 --> 00:50:57,770
Gary Tonin,

1945
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:59,860
because Gary Tonin went to hens,

1946
00:50:59,861 --> 00:51:03,050
owes to train with Danner and
he didn't have any leg locks.

1947
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,460
He was all rear naked choke.

1948
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,030
He had his,

1949
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,270
you know,

1950
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,631
basic.

1951
00:51:05,631 --> 00:51:06,650
He was already a black belt.

1952
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:10,190
He went to Dan or that's when he started
learning the leg locks from him and

1953
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:11,030
through Eddie Cummings.

1954
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,420
They,

1955
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:11,670
you know,

1956
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:14,480
then him and Eddie come and just became
like best friends and training partners.

1957
00:51:14,481 --> 00:51:15,570
I was so impressed with Gary.

1958
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:16,551
I took,

1959
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:17,970
I took privates from John Donner.

1960
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:19,820
Yes,

1961
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,820
like probably five and that was,

1962
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:22,581
I got this new guy,

1963
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:26,480
Gordon Ryan who just got his black belt
is fucking amazing as well as the new

1964
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:26,661
guy.

1965
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:27,650
You're going to shuck corn.

1966
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:32,080
She knows another leg
lock master the people.

1967
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,340
Forget Dave Terrell.

1968
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:37,990
You remember Dave to WRAL versus
Ricardo Almeida in 2003 in Abu Dhabi.

1969
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,290
Don't remember that dude.

1970
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:43,250
Dave Terrell had some nasty
ass fucking leg locks.

1971
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,920
Dave Tarell was so explosive.

1972
00:51:45,921 --> 00:51:48,620
I've heard legendary stories
about him in the training room.

1973
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:49,731
He's the best ever.

1974
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,241
I saw it.

1975
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:52,760
I was seeing him compete like
watching him and Abu Dhabi,

1976
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:56,150
I always expected he was going to be
UFC champion because he went into MMA,

1977
00:51:56,151 --> 00:51:57,320
starts smashing people.

1978
00:51:57,321 --> 00:51:59,090
He knocked out Matt
Lindland at first round,

1979
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:04,420
but Evan Tanner got him and he also had
a series of catastrophic ear injuries.

1980
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,370
He had to have it removed from his head.

1981
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:07,831
Why can't,

1982
00:52:07,831 --> 00:52:11,810
it's like staff inside
his head from his ear.

1983
00:52:11,811 --> 00:52:13,700
His ears were just Gonzo,

1984
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:14,031
right?

1985
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:17,360
They were like these just
fucking ash trays on his head.

1986
00:52:17,361 --> 00:52:18,470
Hard as a rock,

1987
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,790
just all cauliflower.

1988
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:20,001
Dot.

1989
00:52:20,001 --> 00:52:23,240
But apparently like just years and
years of hard training yet he got an

1990
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:26,680
infection inside his ear and
they had to take it on his bike,

1991
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,790
his whole fucking ear off his head,

1992
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,170
clean it all out,

1993
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,070
like try to fuse it and
swap it and cauterize it.

1994
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,110
She get could get it to stop oozing,

1995
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,350
pus you in,

1996
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,190
your ear falls off and it didn't work.

1997
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:42,540
They had to do it again like he's got he,

1998
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:43,490
he went through like,

1999
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,380
and like when your ears fucked.

2000
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,880
Have you ever had an earache or can your,

2001
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:50,360
your equilibrium's off?

2002
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:51,400
You can't do shit or worse.

2003
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:53,590
So he's like a mythical creature and uh,

2004
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,790
nor nor cal two.

2005
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,900
And there's so many crazy stories
about that guy who was Syme compete.

2006
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:58,341
I was like,

2007
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:02,120
that fucking guy moves like
a ghost as fast as fuck.

2008
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,380
And his students,

2009
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:03,740
uh,

2010
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,161
one of them,

2011
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:04,791
Joe Soto,

2012
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:07,220
they're so good at leg lock defense.

2013
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,210
Joe Soto,

2014
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,740
when you're generally,

2015
00:53:09,741 --> 00:53:11,900
when you game plan against Eddie Cummings,

2016
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:17,140
the game plan is stay away from any kind
of footsie battles you don't want to

2017
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:18,380
battle was at.

2018
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:19,223
Avoid it.

2019
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:20,420
Avoid it.

2020
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,180
Try to do the,

2021
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:21,420
the,

2022
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,710
the Super Basic Jujitsu strategy.

2023
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:25,471
Like what?

2024
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:25,920
Uh,

2025
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,460
um,

2026
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,760
I think it was Lucas dupree
and Abu Dhabi did a Gary Tonin.

2027
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,740
It was either Lucas
the pre or Leandra low.

2028
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,530
I kicked those guys
mixed up all the time on,

2029
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:33,860
well,

2030
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,610
one of those guys that I will dobby when
against Gary Tonin and he just straight

2031
00:53:37,611 --> 00:53:38,490
knee slice,

2032
00:53:38,491 --> 00:53:38,911
boom.

2033
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:39,780
Stayed tight,

2034
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,250
stayed in side control,

2035
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,910
top half tight.

2036
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:45,600
Never let Gary get anywhere near his legs.

2037
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,231
You know,

2038
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:49,320
that's the game plan against a
leg lock guy like Eddie come.

2039
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:49,740
That's it.

2040
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,930
You try to play footsies with them,

2041
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:51,300
you're,

2042
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,133
you're retarded.

2043
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,610
But Joe Soto,

2044
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,440
he went in there in the finals,

2045
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,274
that Ebi three,

2046
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,510
he went in there and just said,

2047
00:53:57,511 --> 00:54:01,530
he sat on his ass and I'm
gonna play footsies with
Eddie comes and it wore for a

2048
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:04,410
long time and everybody
was just blown away.

2049
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:04,801
It's like,

2050
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:09,270
how the fuck is he leaving his legs out
there for Eddie Cummins grafters legs

2051
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,200
and Joe Soto just displayed
just this incredible,

2052
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:13,811
uh,

2053
00:54:13,811 --> 00:54:14,620
of defense.

2054
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,870
His leg lock defense.

2055
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,310
I was reffing gone.

2056
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:18,750
What the fuck dude?

2057
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,680
Is He really playing?

2058
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:20,700
Footsies with Eddie coming?

2059
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,380
He ended up getting caught.

2060
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,790
Eddie Cummins did catch him,

2061
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,940
but he showed tremendous fucking savagery
for going in there and plan legs with

2062
00:54:31,411 --> 00:54:31,770
them.

2063
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,240
And I talked to him
afterwards and he said,

2064
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:33,451
dude,

2065
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:33,720
I,

2066
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,530
I roll with Dave Tarell all the Goddamn
time that guys always after our legs.

2067
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,401
Are you kidding me?

2068
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:42,030
We're used to this shit kill or
be killed if you're in a leg lock.

2069
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:43,230
Speaking of submissions,

2070
00:54:43,231 --> 00:54:44,460
Cummings knees all fucked up.

2071
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,270
How about your boy Rob
Barnett and Roswell?

2072
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,200
And so it'll fuck called that insane,

2073
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:50,123
insane.

2074
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,180
Insane.

2075
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,950
Apparently when Rothwell
gets a hold of your neck,

2076
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:53,800
he just knows how to speak.

2077
00:54:53,801 --> 00:54:55,110
He was showing me what he got him in.

2078
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:55,530
Oh,

2079
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:56,280
that's horrible.

2080
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,600
I don't know how his hands are though.

2081
00:54:57,601 --> 00:54:58,730
I don't know how he's gripping his hand.

2082
00:54:58,730 --> 00:54:59,563
I don't know it is either.

2083
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,680
It's a 10 finger essentially,

2084
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,070
but the coach wanted to call it a go.

2085
00:55:04,071 --> 00:55:05,220
Go choke hard because it,

2086
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:06,660
it goes against your throat.

2087
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,550
Sort of like a Google Plata or if
there's no one hot on the UFC division

2088
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,540
heavyweight division right now,

2089
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:13,970
then no Rothwell's the police.

2090
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:14,830
He's the beast.

2091
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:15,870
You'd like being that guy right now.

2092
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:16,581
Their confidence.

2093
00:55:16,581 --> 00:55:17,850
He pays the bees too though.

2094
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,730
It's like it's real close like well
after Steve Bay destroyed Orlowski like

2095
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:21,300
that.

2096
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,290
Steve Bay's right in there.

2097
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:24,930
Man will face Mickey Gal.

2098
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:29,150
It is year apparently one earlier
tonight he did and he's a,

2099
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:32,190
I was hearing a lot of
criticisms about a face off.

2100
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,350
Cm punk walked in.

2101
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:36,570
It was the first prelim
ever to have a face off.

2102
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:37,470
I just feel like,

2103
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,840
I don't know why he would want to do that.

2104
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,200
I feel like if he was smart he
would just start fighting and small

2105
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:44,100
organizations,

2106
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,293
you know,

2107
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:50,360
I get that you want to get a lot of money
because I'm the UFC is where it's at

2108
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:51,690
with money.

2109
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:55,350
But I would think like the smart move
is what he's already done training wise.

2110
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:56,370
Go to a real camp.

2111
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:57,391
He goes to Rufus,

2112
00:55:57,391 --> 00:55:59,670
perfect roof is going
to teach him how to uh,

2113
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,710
strike as good as anybody in the world.

2114
00:56:01,711 --> 00:56:02,190
Agree.

2115
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:04,770
And then you got real good
wrestling with Ben Aspirin.

2116
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,240
You got a real good Jujitsu,

2117
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,410
you got everything there,

2118
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,130
everything,

2119
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:08,940
everything there.

2120
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,050
I heard they offered him,

2121
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,500
I heard they offered him and go
through the tough show and he's like,

2122
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:13,921
Nah man,

2123
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:14,970
I'm trying to write to the shell.

2124
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:16,860
So I think tough would
have been better for them.

2125
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:18,270
You get ratings.

2126
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,171
We see how he does.

2127
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:20,340
He gets warm up and then,

2128
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:20,731
you know,

2129
00:56:20,731 --> 00:56:21,480
then he goes,

2130
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,440
but for your first fight
to be in that octagon,

2131
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:26,040
good fucking who was
Mickey gauzy tough though?

2132
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,231
Well,

2133
00:56:26,231 --> 00:56:27,210
he's a newcomer.

2134
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,880
They found them on that looking for a
fight show on HBO and a small show or in a

2135
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:33,460
youtube rather in a small organization.

2136
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:34,240
We are looking for it.

2137
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:34,540
He's a,

2138
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,640
he's a brown belt brown belt.

2139
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,260
Significant that.

2140
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,270
That's what I read earlier
today after he won,

2141
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:42,430
he won by submission.

2142
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,600
They said he was a brown.

2143
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:44,320
I heard,

2144
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,460
I heard blue and purple.

2145
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:46,950
The UFC said brown belt,

2146
00:56:46,951 --> 00:56:47,391
so I don't know.

2147
00:56:47,391 --> 00:56:48,224
Okay,

2148
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,290
well we might've gone is
brown right before the fight.

2149
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,900
You know a little pump me up.

2150
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:55,780
That's three more belts ahead of cm
punk that she goes to the ground.

2151
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,003
Yes.

2152
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,060
That's a big difference.

2153
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:00,820
So who knows what cm punk
has been able to do in the,

2154
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,051
well,

2155
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:02,320
he's been training for over a year.

2156
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,110
Can you imagine if cm punk
goes in and she gets murked?

2157
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,060
It'd be like from the
waterboy when Michigan,

2158
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:08,740
the water boy water boy,

2159
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,430
he certainly could write,

2160
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,180
he could turn to get Merkt.

2161
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,920
Who knows if this kid can strike,

2162
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,180
like if he can strike,

2163
00:57:16,181 --> 00:57:16,691
if the kid has,

2164
00:57:16,691 --> 00:57:18,250
you could use it to any good strike.

2165
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,941
Good luck.

2166
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:21,940
Learn how striking a year she's got
doesn't have any striking under him.

2167
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:22,870
Can you imagine?

2168
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:23,191
Okay,

2169
00:57:23,191 --> 00:57:24,310
like you're going to harass signs,

2170
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,540
strike some,

2171
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,690
some dude who's got like some serious
knockout power and you're going to

2172
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:29,530
practice for a year.

2173
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,220
That's ridiculous.

2174
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,840
I like cm punk as a person,

2175
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:34,710
but for the sport I think
it's best if he gets murked

2176
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:38,920
was that fucked all the way
going to make headlines.

2177
00:57:38,921 --> 00:57:41,200
I'm happy when anybody
says gets marked me too.

2178
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:43,990
But gets high a style
like when you get stuck,

2179
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,093
I forget

2180
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,120
about rumble and Jon Jones go,

2181
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,120
you never know man.

2182
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,670
Rumble could starch him
and we said starts at like,

2183
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:52,720
oh he could.

2184
00:57:52,721 --> 00:57:54,250
He could a good start to anybody.

2185
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:58,150
Anybody in the world rumble can hit you
on the temple and your shit could just

2186
00:57:58,151 --> 00:57:59,310
go born you on your way.

2187
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,000
I think John mops the floor.

2188
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:03,340
He has the biggest head and
long steep I've ever seen.

2189
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,380
I rob could almost head is gigantic.

2190
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,460
It's a big fucking head.

2191
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,200
If he connects against Jon Jones,

2192
00:58:08,201 --> 00:58:08,950
that's,

2193
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:09,760
I don't think you will though.

2194
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,750
I think John takes him down.

2195
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:11,890
Where's the mountain?

2196
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:12,371
Takes us heart.

2197
00:58:12,371 --> 00:58:14,980
People forget the Steepbank
got stopped by skyscraper.

2198
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,520
Stephan's truth come out.

2199
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,633
Yeah.

2200
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:21,040
Stepdad knocked knockdowns truth,

2201
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:21,610
man.

2202
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,050
He's had some real tough fights.

2203
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:25,270
There's a guy who has had
some real tough fights.

2204
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:29,890
He's had some like brutal knockout losses
to the losses and put seven foot tall

2205
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,050
basketball back in the day.

2206
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:36,670
The kid had some mad potential and
still does because I was 26 27 right?

2207
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:36,870
Yes.

2208
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:37,990
So many fights on man.

2209
00:58:37,991 --> 00:58:40,480
His Age is not what I count.

2210
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:40,811
I count.

2211
00:58:40,811 --> 00:58:41,261
He has what?

2212
00:58:41,261 --> 00:58:42,001
40 fights?

2213
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:42,640
Some shit.

2214
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,250
He's had some ruthless
knockouts inside the octagon.

2215
00:58:45,251 --> 00:58:47,350
And when's the last time you
saw seven foot tall grandpa?

2216
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,633
Anyone?

2217
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:49,960
They don't live long.

2218
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:50,710
Anybody,

2219
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:51,550
anybody?

2220
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:51,851
No,

2221
00:58:51,851 --> 00:58:54,460
they don't know.

2222
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:54,910
Yeah,

2223
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:55,340
they all,

2224
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,410
they're all have heart conditions.

2225
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:57,680
They're just too big one.

2226
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,080
If they can mitigate that today,

2227
00:58:59,210 --> 00:58:59,440
man,

2228
00:58:59,440 --> 00:58:59,640
when,

2229
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,570
if they understand like
what it is that though,

2230
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,010
like you're dying,

2231
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,770
so fuck yourself bro.

2232
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:13,693
Betty and I

2233
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,860
both are going to be a hundred.

2234
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:17,540
I'll be,

2235
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,120
I'm on the back nine for sure.

2236
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:19,391
Well,

2237
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:19,991
you know what though?

2238
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:24,860
Honestly do you really to live
past 80 fucking what kind of dog?

2239
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:25,250
Shit.

2240
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:25,941
Arthritis.

2241
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:27,350
Written existence is that.

2242
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:27,621
Oh,

2243
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:29,290
by former athletes,

2244
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:33,810
former athlete pass 80
good lord and less than

2245
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,000
40 years from now.

2246
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:39,310
Who the fuck knows?

2247
00:59:39,311 --> 00:59:39,890
Who knows?

2248
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:40,723
Three

2249
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,213
Daddy.

2250
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,360
What's going to happen
when I'm 45 and he's yeah,

2251
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,410
asked me that for Ron.

2252
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:48,831
I said,

2253
00:59:48,831 --> 00:59:49,664
Shit,

2254
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:50,571
you'll be a copy of all.

2255
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:51,440
They're going to be dead.

2256
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,030
That's what I said.

2257
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:58,810
I just don't want to be dead when he's
going to be 45 [inaudible] 23rd sorry.

2258
01:00:00,201 --> 01:00:01,120
I know that you got to call us.

2259
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,353
Oh,

2260
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,280
April 23rd I'm Jim.

2261
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,350
John Jones has been lifting weights.

2262
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:07,581
Hey,

2263
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:08,001
I love it.

2264
01:00:08,001 --> 01:00:08,900
All John's lifting weights.

2265
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:09,321
Everyone was like,

2266
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:09,471
no,

2267
01:00:09,471 --> 01:00:09,770
he's,

2268
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:10,910
he's a good guy now.

2269
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,140
Everything's all good.

2270
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,310
Like cause he's post pictures,

2271
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,153
lifting weights.

2272
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:16,040
He's a fucking monster now.

2273
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,940
John John's is ridiculous.

2274
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,100
Good luck beating him.

2275
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:23,523
Yeah.

2276
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,210
And I don't think rumbles
going to wait for a,

2277
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:27,163
for a title shot.

2278
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:27,771
Yeah.

2279
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:29,350
Now I said he's not going to like it.

2280
01:00:29,351 --> 01:00:31,020
I wouldn't wait to eat
if I was wrong by wood,

2281
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,113
some quick work in.

2282
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:33,650
And if he got busted with coke,

2283
01:00:33,651 --> 01:00:34,484
again,

2284
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:35,890
blind beggar.

2285
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:36,441
I love the guy.

2286
01:00:36,441 --> 01:00:36,741
We said,

2287
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:37,240
oh shit,

2288
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,120
that ain't snowflake.

2289
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,721
I'm a fucker.

2290
01:00:38,721 --> 01:00:40,520
Came riding shot a low single,

2291
01:00:40,521 --> 01:00:41,331
just stayed on it.

2292
01:00:41,331 --> 01:00:43,100
Also hanging on to a Kamora

2293
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:45,081
big guy.

2294
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:47,950
So Hutto Johnson versus,

2295
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,180
that's the cool manner.

2296
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,670
Is that the Olympic wrestler to

2297
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:56,300
gold medalists?

2298
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,133
Yeah,

2299
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,123
he bites it.

2300
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:59,300
Those guys are super smart.

2301
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,023
I was like,

2302
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:02,953
Ooh,

2303
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,460
girl is division guys are quick.

2304
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,013
That's what I say.

2305
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,570
This guy's a scramble.

2306
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,710
What were we're talking about?

2307
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,540
Are we just talking about

2308
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,530
a rumble and that quick work?

2309
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,280
Ryan Bader.

2310
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:22,490
Oh,

2311
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:23,720
I keep trying to finish that.

2312
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:23,960
Uh,

2313
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,410
Kimora like that's a hard move to
pull off on a strong dude as it is.

2314
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:28,130
Right?

2315
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:31,910
A guy strong is rumble was on top and
you don't even have half panic I think.

2316
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,010
But he had no control when
he was holding on to it.

2317
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:35,360
He had to do something with his legs.

2318
01:01:35,361 --> 01:01:37,190
He just didn't have the
dexterity to get into a position,

2319
01:01:37,191 --> 01:01:41,430
like a half guard or something and then
get up to the like to the dog fight,

2320
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:41,840
right.

2321
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,381
Rumble said,

2322
01:01:42,381 --> 01:01:44,810
what the fuck is thinking
at empty half at one point,

2323
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:45,733
right?

2324
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:50,030
Well the problem is
he's so fucking strong,

2325
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:50,760
explosive.

2326
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,070
The beginning of the round,

2327
01:01:52,071 --> 01:01:55,670
he's 100% he's not even remotely tired.

2328
01:01:55,700 --> 01:02:00,500
I jumped on your back or he's got you
on your back and it's not top of you and

2329
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:03,290
you know one of those punches
is going to change your life.

2330
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:04,483
One Punch.

2331
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:05,090
Just one.

2332
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,770
You gotta be really good on your back.

2333
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:07,611
That's all that is.

2334
01:02:07,611 --> 01:02:10,650
You gotta be really fun
when you take him to grant.

2335
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,560
John Jones is going to ram right there.

2336
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,930
He tried to take an ankle.

2337
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:15,710
No,

2338
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:16,740
I'm saying to John Jones,

2339
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:17,511
gonna take rumble down.

2340
01:02:17,511 --> 01:02:18,110
Maybe.

2341
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,190
I promise he's going to incite

2342
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:20,411
trip.

2343
01:02:20,411 --> 01:02:21,340
I'm take them down my,

2344
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:24,650
he's going to break them
and the TKL they might not.

2345
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,231
Man,

2346
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:26,064
you're so confident.

2347
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,270
How could you say that?

2348
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:28,021
You're so calm.

2349
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:28,240
Fucking,

2350
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,073
I was just going to happen.

2351
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:32,220
Dan was getting better and better
and now they're just trying to,

2352
01:02:32,221 --> 01:02:32,881
when Neil Ballantyne,

2353
01:02:32,881 --> 01:02:34,080
he's getting his grappling in order.

2354
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:34,740
I hear you Joe.

2355
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:35,130
It's all,

2356
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:35,301
yeah,

2357
01:02:35,301 --> 01:02:35,700
I agree.

2358
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,301
He's a monster.

2359
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:36,960
Advertised.

2360
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,730
Johnson was Johnson at Juco champion.

2361
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,230
He asked.

2362
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:41,063
He might,

2363
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:43,951
he might,

2364
01:02:43,951 --> 01:02:45,380
he has the skills to starch.

2365
01:02:45,381 --> 01:02:46,710
Anyone in the words of Joe Rogan.

2366
01:02:46,711 --> 01:02:48,090
But yeah,

2367
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:49,890
he's got the skills to
stiffen them all up.

2368
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,490
It's mother whether or not he can apply
it against the very best of the best,

2369
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,700
but he's at this edge like I
don't think he's done improving.

2370
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:58,170
So he's had this edge right now.

2371
01:02:58,171 --> 01:02:59,370
We're only a guy like core me.

2372
01:02:59,371 --> 01:03:00,990
Aa Can beat him cause everybody else,

2373
01:03:00,991 --> 01:03:01,920
Jimmy Manawan,

2374
01:03:01,921 --> 01:03:03,540
everybody gets the fuck beat out of him.

2375
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,290
Gustafson gets the fuck beat.

2376
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:06,810
David.

2377
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:08,100
I think it's five and five.

2378
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:11,970
We'll take a flight has been a rumble.

2379
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:13,270
Johnson's good fight match up.

2380
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,540
Got this and got headbutted.

2381
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,950
Actually they had one fight and he starts,

2382
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,020
he smashed him.

2383
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:19,291
Yeah,

2384
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:19,830
I know.

2385
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,210
I'm saying that doesn't happen every time.

2386
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:25,560
I don't know when they don't know what
happens every time you got a good point,

2387
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,193
no one goes,

2388
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:28,710
it might not happen every time,

2389
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,110
but with the data that we
have currently available,

2390
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:37,660
[inaudible] scary guy who
knocks everybody dead.

2391
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,070
He knocked him dead.

2392
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,090
And so you've got to think,

2393
01:03:42,091 --> 01:03:42,750
okay,

2394
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:43,380
first of all,

2395
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:45,810
the kind of beating that
Gustafson took in that fight.

2396
01:03:45,811 --> 01:03:46,890
You don't want to take it again.

2397
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:50,280
I agree that that was a bad beat about
the data when going to see Anthony

2398
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,590
Johnson Bracey break.

2399
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,280
He broke him.

2400
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,980
He definitely broke guy break John Jones,

2401
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:56,730
who's broken?

2402
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:59,700
Everybody including DC DC.

2403
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,593
That's not good.

2404
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:05,850
Let's look at the data we have
here according to the data.

2405
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:06,061
Right,

2406
01:04:06,061 --> 01:04:07,130
but that we're not talking about him.

2407
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:08,280
We were talking about Gustafson.

2408
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,291
I know you're talking about,

2409
01:04:09,291 --> 01:04:09,571
I'm saying,

2410
01:04:09,571 --> 01:04:12,130
but you got Jamie pull up that got,

2411
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:14,100
but that was a monster fucking fight.

2412
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:18,480
But definitely looks like watch
this and everybody can get broken.

2413
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:19,653
Everybody.

2414
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,293
If a guy says,

2415
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:23,143
break you,

2416
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:24,700
really multiple guy,

2417
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,150
great ones don't get
broke because they're not,

2418
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:31,800
they don't fight anybody that much
better than them at Lombardi said.

2419
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:32,634
Vince Lombardi said,

2420
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,740
fatigue makes cowards of us all.

2421
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:37,450
And that's a great shirt.

2422
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:37,791
Look,

2423
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:38,790
I'll look up fatigue.

2424
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,070
John was against mess of men,

2425
01:04:41,071 --> 01:04:41,320
right?

2426
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:41,550
Yeah.

2427
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:42,383
Yeah.

2428
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:43,860
I've thought of that all the time.

2429
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:45,061
Yeah,

2430
01:04:45,061 --> 01:04:45,900
it makes me a pussy.

2431
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:46,640
Ah,

2432
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,160
retired.

2433
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:47,993
I turned to such.

2434
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:51,400
Everyone does cardio shaves motherfucker,

2435
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:52,830
but you know what man,

2436
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:56,160
I've been getting into this straight
cardio over the last few months.

2437
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:59,250
I've been doing like these hardcore
cardio workouts just because I hate them.

2438
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:00,240
What are you talking about?

2439
01:05:00,241 --> 01:05:02,670
Like what kind of ridiculous sprints?

2440
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:04,560
Like not like a Tabata protocol,

2441
01:05:04,561 --> 01:05:07,770
but I do a 32nd on 32nd off
on an elliptical machine.

2442
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:10,710
I I adjusted from 16 which is pretty hard.

2443
01:05:10,711 --> 01:05:15,240
Pretty stiff to 20 which is like you're
wrestling this fucking thing and I'll do

2444
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:17,040
these death sprints.

2445
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,460
30 and 30 that's good.

2446
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:20,630
Does it for how many 30 offhand?

2447
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,113
It depends on,

2448
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:23,770
it depends on what I'm trying to do,

2449
01:05:23,771 --> 01:05:24,604
but I do,

2450
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:28,060
I do a 45 minute workout and what
I'm doing the 45 minute workout,

2451
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:29,140
the first 15 minutes,

2452
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:30,580
I'm just getting everything ramped up.

2453
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,680
So the first 15 minutes was no sprints.

2454
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:36,850
The first 15 minutes just keep it on
16 and going out at a very fast pace.

2455
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:40,480
Then once I get to the first
15 minutes and I'm sweating,

2456
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:41,950
then it's death runs.

2457
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:46,900
I go on these 30 segment death runs it
for a whole 30 minutes depending upon how

2458
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:47,110
much,

2459
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,490
how long I can last,

2460
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,840
how many death runs I can do.

2461
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:51,580
Cause sometimes I can't do the death runs.

2462
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,960
I just have to just pace myself at 16
but then when I feel like I've got my

2463
01:05:55,961 --> 01:05:56,641
heart rate down,

2464
01:05:56,641 --> 01:05:57,190
cause my,

2465
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:59,020
my elliptical things got
a little heart rate thing.

2466
01:05:59,021 --> 01:05:59,741
Kind of just want to go.

2467
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:01,280
Do you have that heart rate monitor?

2468
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:02,610
Beast of a workout?

2469
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:03,453
You just got to,

2470
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:04,120
oh they're all,

2471
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:04,781
they all can.

2472
01:06:04,781 --> 01:06:06,280
Everybody uses elliptical machines.

2473
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,960
They just kind of go steady.

2474
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:09,640
But if you go on a death run,

2475
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:12,010
you got to go on a save your life,

2476
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:13,150
save your loved one,

2477
01:06:13,151 --> 01:06:16,630
save your mom from fucking I do it.

2478
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:17,380
I just do it.

2479
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:17,531
No,

2480
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:19,490
but I mean like what makes you a spread?

2481
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:21,870
My inner insecurity.

2482
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,860
Like think you're sprinting,

2483
01:06:23,861 --> 01:06:26,290
but you're like during the
sprint time you're like,

2484
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:27,250
you know,

2485
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:27,730
man,

2486
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:29,710
I'm fucking proud as fast as I can,

2487
01:06:29,711 --> 01:06:30,544
whatever.

2488
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:35,410
There's a number of revolutions per minute
and I want to keep it above a certain

2489
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:35,591
number.

2490
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:36,170
I don't remember.

2491
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:39,190
I don't remember what it
is at at one 80 or at um,

2492
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:43,240
at 20 but at somewhere where you want
your heart rate to be somewhere around one

2493
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,260
80 and the,

2494
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:46,600
I forget what the revolutions are because
there are different on the one that I

2495
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:48,700
use at the gym versus the
one that I use at home.

2496
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:51,550
But you could have a number where
you could keep it at that number.

2497
01:06:51,551 --> 01:06:53,230
So it's at like one 47 I think.

2498
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:57,310
So when you hit one 47 and you just got
to fucking keep it there for 30 seconds

2499
01:06:58,810 --> 01:06:59,650
and it's big,

2500
01:06:59,651 --> 01:07:01,630
deep Wim Hoff breaths the whole time

2501
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:05,890
and just wrestle this
thing for 30 seconds.

2502
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:07,380
Do you know it's a nightmare and relax.

2503
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:07,850
Yeah.

2504
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:08,080
You know,

2505
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:08,591
it's a nightmare.

2506
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,630
He's setting just a little something.

2507
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:15,900
Set the treadmill at 15 incline and it
put it at four miles an hour and walk,

2508
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:18,070
walk for for 15 minutes.

2509
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:21,000
Try to try to stay small
pace towards their kill.

2510
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:21,641
You did.

2511
01:07:21,641 --> 01:07:22,870
I have,

2512
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:23,201
I have.

2513
01:07:23,201 --> 01:07:26,770
I talked about what the cardio I did
from Metamora sprinting in the pool.

2514
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:27,250
Yeah.

2515
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:27,470
Yeah.

2516
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:28,303
That's awesome.

2517
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:28,900
Well,

2518
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,270
Tim Ferriss runs death runs in recovery.

2519
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,091
That's what it's all about.

2520
01:07:32,091 --> 01:07:32,210
Yeah.

2521
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:33,550
Think about the pool thing though,

2522
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:38,551
is the way I did it was there's a
giant clock and every time it hits 12,

2523
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,080
you sprint across the pool.

2524
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,960
So when you get to the end of the pool,

2525
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,640
whatever's left in that minute,

2526
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:46,503
you get to rest.

2527
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:46,661
Right?

2528
01:07:46,661 --> 01:07:46,930
Yeah.

2529
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:47,531
So when you're,

2530
01:07:47,531 --> 01:07:48,850
when you're doing that,

2531
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,670
no one has to tell you bust ass,

2532
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:53,760
you're busting ass to rest.

2533
01:07:53,761 --> 01:07:53,980
Yeah.

2534
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:54,611
Cause you know,

2535
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:55,870
after the first,

2536
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:56,800
uh,

2537
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,230
maybe six laps or easy,

2538
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:00,820
soon as the clock hits 12,

2539
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:02,260
you bust ass across the pool.

2540
01:08:02,261 --> 01:08:02,890
Your sprint,

2541
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:06,370
you get past and it's like you got 35
seconds to rest and then you rest and you

2542
01:08:06,371 --> 01:08:07,204
do it back.

2543
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:12,330
As soon as it hits the 12 boom
after like 12 dad in the pool.

2544
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:16,070
And no matter how chaotic it doesn't
take long breathing is you got

2545
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:16,600
it.

2546
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,930
No matter how tired you are,

2547
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:21,110
you got to keep your breathing on
point because to swim your shit.

2548
01:08:21,111 --> 01:08:21,800
So you got,

2549
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,120
you're like dying.

2550
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,170
But at the same time,

2551
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:26,780
there's something in your
mind and you're on dude,

2552
01:08:26,781 --> 01:08:27,950
survival mode,

2553
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:28,731
you're dying,

2554
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:30,410
but you're breathing's gotta be perfectly,

2555
01:08:30,411 --> 01:08:31,970
you're going to swallow water,

2556
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,770
you're going to swallow water and use.

2557
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:37,880
That to me was super fucking
crucial in the grappling.

2558
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:38,061
Yeah,

2559
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:38,710
exactly.

2560
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:41,720
Wrestling with no matter
what you're breathing,

2561
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,790
no matter how chaotic your situation is,

2562
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:44,300
it,

2563
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:44,710
it,

2564
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:45,080
it,

2565
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:45,440
it,

2566
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:45,680
uh,

2567
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,740
you practice breathing
and chaotic situations.

2568
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:49,753
Cause if you,

2569
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:51,890
if you a hiccup at all,

2570
01:08:51,891 --> 01:08:52,910
you swallow water.

2571
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:53,670
This is a good fight.

2572
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:56,690
Allows that Makowski and Joseph
Benavidez this is a very good fight.

2573
01:08:56,691 --> 01:08:57,680
I've been looking forward to this.

2574
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:59,690
Benevidez get another title shot.

2575
01:08:59,691 --> 01:09:03,650
You think maybe he's down at muscle farm
and he's a training with bang again,

2576
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,150
doing all his training with bang.

2577
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:05,641
Uh,

2578
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,540
I don't know what's going on
with those guys in Sacramento.

2579
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:09,531
What's happening?

2580
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:10,400
Like how many,

2581
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:11,234
how often they're,

2582
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,700
him and Lance Palmer had
been bouncing all over.

2583
01:09:13,701 --> 01:09:14,391
I don't mean to cut you off.

2584
01:09:14,391 --> 01:09:17,510
Joe Jimenez Palmer had been bouncing
all over though to Jackson's and went to

2585
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:19,220
muscle farm and a must for me.

2586
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:19,341
No,

2587
01:09:19,341 --> 01:09:20,990
it's t they got a hell
of a team down there.

2588
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:21,824
Tj,

2589
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:22,723
Lance Palmer.

2590
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,770
Benevidez Neil magni batch will benefit.

2591
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:27,050
Has got to do what he's gotta do.

2592
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:27,291
I mean,

2593
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:29,000
he doesn't have any
meat in many years left.

2594
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:30,470
I think he's in his thirties as well.

2595
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,131
And especially,

2596
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:34,040
I think he's 34 but at one oh boy.

2597
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:34,670
Wow.

2598
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,230
What's he do if he loses 25 well,

2599
01:09:37,231 --> 01:09:40,310
we wouldn't be loses to McCroskey
tonight and Makowski beats this guy,

2600
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:42,440
but maybe just took them down.

2601
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:42,920
I agree.

2602
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,720
Let's say he fights Dj for a third time.

2603
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:45,290
He loses.

2604
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:46,123
Hey man,

2605
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,120
we can't do four.

2606
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:47,631
I'm sorry.

2607
01:09:47,631 --> 01:09:48,464
I can't do it for,

2608
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,520
we got to move on.

2609
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:50,120
Well,

2610
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,170
what does he do then?

2611
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:52,281
It's a real question.

2612
01:09:52,281 --> 01:09:53,114
Opens a gym.

2613
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:53,973
Did you see,

2614
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,750
did you see Justin Scoggins today?

2615
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:57,320
Yes.

2616
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,990
Jesus Christ Jesus.

2617
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:03,080
He looked fantastic and fucking Scoggins.

2618
01:10:03,081 --> 01:10:03,771
Holy Shit.

2619
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:04,610
Holy Shit.

2620
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,080
God Damn Dude.

2621
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:06,890
Yes.

2622
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:08,990
That karate style shit about him,

2623
01:10:08,991 --> 01:10:09,171
dude.

2624
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:09,380
I'm,

2625
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:10,250
I'm not like you guys.

2626
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:11,810
I'm not like an encyclopedia right now.

2627
01:10:11,811 --> 01:10:12,770
There's too many UFC.

2628
01:10:12,771 --> 01:10:13,190
He's like,

2629
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:14,180
I can barely keep up.

2630
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,590
I didn't know what the fuck he was,

2631
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:16,970
but I saw him for the first time today,

2632
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:18,290
the prelim and I,

2633
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,131
I was thinking,

2634
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:20,600
Holy Shit,

2635
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:21,620
I guess Ray Borg,

2636
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,513
because before,

2637
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,310
before the fight started,

2638
01:10:25,311 --> 01:10:29,900
they had mentioned they got Scroggins
thinks he has the best movement in MMA.

2639
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:30,620
And I'm like,

2640
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,120
oh my motherfucking God,

2641
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,380
how retarded can this guy be the best

2642
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,790
fucking retard.

2643
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,920
And then after one round I'm like,

2644
01:10:39,921 --> 01:10:40,311
okay,

2645
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:43,030
he might have here,

2646
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:45,590
can you,

2647
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:46,730
can you keep the pace?

2648
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:47,540
And then he was,

2649
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:50,500
he looked really good on the
corner is grounded cause he rests,

2650
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:52,910
his wrestling was very
good and it's striking.

2651
01:10:52,911 --> 01:10:54,410
Was this like coming from also,

2652
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,590
he left and he's fighting right at it.

2653
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:00,590
He's thrown every kick and
spinning everything like Holy Shit.

2654
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:04,850
He's one of the best guys at standing
in that sideways karate style stance and

2655
01:11:04,851 --> 01:11:06,220
using their front leg too.

2656
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:09,370
He Front Lake side kicks your
Thigh Front Lake sidekicks.

2657
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,240
I Dunno if brainless
does that mother fucker.

2658
01:11:12,241 --> 01:11:12,891
I'm correct.

2659
01:11:12,891 --> 01:11:13,200
Or,

2660
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,700
but he was talking about how,

2661
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:15,451
and I don't know,

2662
01:11:15,451 --> 01:11:15,901
like I said,

2663
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:17,220
I don't know anything about Scroggins,

2664
01:11:17,221 --> 01:11:18,001
but Brian,

2665
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:21,360
Stan was saying that when
he fights a southpaw,

2666
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:22,980
he fights more karate.

2667
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:24,090
And when he fights ride that,

2668
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:24,390
you know,

2669
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,170
Orthodox,

2670
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:26,070
he's fighting more and more.

2671
01:11:26,071 --> 01:11:27,660
We tire or something like that.

2672
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:30,600
Like we fighting right hand the style
and it's finally left hand this style.

2673
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:30,901
I'm like,

2674
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:31,561
Holy Shit,

2675
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:32,400
how cool is that

2676
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:34,823
style?

2677
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:35,820
But he changes it up.

2678
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:36,691
Like right here.

2679
01:11:36,691 --> 01:11:38,640
I feel good when we tie right here.

2680
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:39,570
I'm a karate guy.

2681
01:11:39,571 --> 01:11:40,870
You know why be fucked?

2682
01:11:40,871 --> 01:11:41,490
It's amazing.

2683
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:41,910
His,

2684
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:45,060
his sideways stance allows
them to use that front leg.

2685
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:48,420
So if you're finding a guy that
doesn't know like that style,

2686
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:49,710
you can get away with a lot of shit.

2687
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:52,050
Like if you're used to a guy
who's fighting Moy Thai style,

2688
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,150
would that light front
leg and the more of a,

2689
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,470
like a closed off stance,

2690
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,690
you can get away with
that with a Moy Thai guy,

2691
01:11:57,691 --> 01:11:58,740
but with a karate guy,

2692
01:11:58,741 --> 01:12:00,210
he'll stand sideways.

2693
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:01,980
Like what standards.

2694
01:12:01,981 --> 01:12:02,460
Dot.

2695
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:02,671
Yeah.

2696
01:12:02,671 --> 01:12:06,150
He'll stay on sideways and throw
those fucking front leg sidekicks.

2697
01:12:06,151 --> 01:12:07,260
And you don't know what to do.

2698
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,630
Like he throws him from way outside.

2699
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:12,150
He's like a lot of these
Moyie Thai style guys.

2700
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:15,000
They're standing right in
front of each other for Zach.

2701
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:15,421
What's north?

2702
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:15,820
South?

2703
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:17,040
He's all over the place.

2704
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:19,190
It's still trained.

2705
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:22,260
Anybody describe a fighter like that?

2706
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,060
Have you ever heard of that before?

2707
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:25,030
No.

2708
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:26,910
Goggins probably told him that,

2709
01:12:26,911 --> 01:12:27,121
you know,

2710
01:12:27,121 --> 01:12:30,170
he probably had a conversation with
them about the different then before.

2711
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:30,690
Have you heard?

2712
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:32,010
I've never heard that before,

2713
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:33,750
but it makes sense if
you see how good he is.

2714
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,673
Birthday switch.

2715
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:36,930
They're playing the same shit.

2716
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,210
When the mayor,

2717
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:40,021
there's like,

2718
01:12:40,021 --> 01:12:40,860
Holy Shit.

2719
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:43,720
Well you know who else is
like super versatile and uh,

2720
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:45,160
being able to uh,

2721
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,530
switch back and forth.

2722
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:50,160
Connor's a wizard with some good

2723
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:53,023
uh,

2724
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,360
former Strikeforce champion.

2725
01:12:54,361 --> 01:12:55,940
Just fought welterweight.

2726
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:56,800
Uh,

2727
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,500
dammit.

2728
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,230
Saturday.

2729
01:12:58,230 --> 01:12:58,531
Yes.

2730
01:12:58,531 --> 01:12:59,220
Terex affidavit.

2731
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:02,500
It's fucking hair happening as a
wizard and going back karate style.

2732
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:05,000
He had Dutch kickboxer.

2733
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:05,550
What does he,

2734
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:05,821
um,

2735
01:13:05,821 --> 01:13:06,151
no,

2736
01:13:06,151 --> 01:13:06,960
not Dutch.

2737
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,360
He is from Germany.

2738
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,660
He's a German kickbox no,

2739
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:12,420
Turkish targeting is Turkish.

2740
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:13,940
No,

2741
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,270
I want to say Belgium from Belgium.

2742
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:17,790
That's Chris from Brussels.

2743
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:19,733
He's from where,

2744
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:20,280
uh,

2745
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,770
vandamme his muscles from.

2746
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:22,140
Well,

2747
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:22,973
there you go.

2748
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,013
There you go.

2749
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:25,260
I love me man.

2750
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:26,190
He's the reason I thought,

2751
01:13:26,191 --> 01:13:26,880
man,

2752
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,020
I want to meet him a couple of times.

2753
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:31,480
Damn movie.

2754
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,880
I've seen him a couple times
in and he's got tight jeans on.

2755
01:13:35,881 --> 01:13:40,020
Always have beautiful bug kind of
Fan Paul ass and a fanny pack bubble.

2756
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:41,460
But with a fanny pack.

2757
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:42,890
He still has one.

2758
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,640
I just do rocks when he
lives in Marina del Rey.

2759
01:13:44,641 --> 01:13:45,470
I live in Marina del Rey.

2760
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:46,740
I see him all the time driving.

2761
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,173
I don't want a super,

2762
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,950
he meet.

2763
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:56,183
We should have them on.

2764
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,000
Ah.

2765
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,430
Oh my God.

2766
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,930
He's a great guy.

2767
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:03,580
Condo near here.

2768
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:08,870
Marina Marina del Rey blood van Damme on
this show would be fucking amazing when

2769
01:14:10,511 --> 01:14:12,330
I come or terrible decide

2770
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:14,980
to make my comeback against
the Thai world champion.

2771
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,280
He's been talking about making
a comeback for like tea.

2772
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:18,123
Actually fight.

2773
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:18,850
No,

2774
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:19,683
listen to me.

2775
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:23,320
If you want to see something that
is amazing that no one talks about,

2776
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:25,870
you need to watch the John
Claude van Damme reality show.

2777
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,590
I watch it fucking one CD.

2778
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:30,450
You're talking about j B c,

2779
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:31,210
d.

2780
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:32,043
Great.

2781
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:32,330
No,

2782
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:32,520
no,

2783
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:32,671
no,

2784
01:14:32,671 --> 01:14:32,821
no,

2785
01:14:32,821 --> 01:14:33,060
no,

2786
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:33,330
no,

2787
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:33,570
no,

2788
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:33,771
no,

2789
01:14:33,771 --> 01:14:33,960
no,

2790
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:34,281
no,

2791
01:14:34,281 --> 01:14:34,541
no.

2792
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:35,400
It's a reality show.

2793
01:14:35,401 --> 01:14:37,150
A reality show is insane.

2794
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:39,420
I love

2795
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:42,603
watching with me.

2796
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:44,610
I might come here,

2797
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:45,170
Youtube.

2798
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:45,760
I'm like,

2799
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,160
watch how crazy people to be the best.

2800
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:48,401
Well,

2801
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:52,400
I think it aired in another
country and Baird it.

2802
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:53,513
Showtime picked it up.

2803
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,200
What is real ridiculous?

2804
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:57,250
He's amazing.

2805
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,050
He keeps talking about having this fight,

2806
01:14:59,051 --> 01:15:00,460
but he's been scheduling for years.

2807
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:01,210
Thai guy.

2808
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:01,690
No,

2809
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:02,590
he's his tiger.

2810
01:15:02,591 --> 01:15:03,640
It gives them a little scratch.

2811
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:05,370
My friend come on hugging,

2812
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,473
fighting

2813
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,130
my face.

2814
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:11,770
He pretends he's going to fight this
guy and they fucking knuckle up.

2815
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:12,490
They have these,

2816
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:13,810
these press conferences and he goes,

2817
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,530
he's batshit crazy.

2818
01:15:17,531 --> 01:15:20,230
Does this speech about having
to fight for the children.

2819
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:21,610
I'm tow of the cocaine.

2820
01:15:21,611 --> 01:15:22,690
I'm done with this.

2821
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:23,770
I'm done with the party.

2822
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,900
That motherfucker needs better friends,

2823
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,541
better friends.

2824
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:29,374
He gets up,

2825
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:33,850
he gets GAC to the gills on coke and he
goes to the price was brushing all the

2826
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:34,684
guards.

2827
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:37,880
They fly him out to Chechnya,

2828
01:15:37,881 --> 01:15:38,251
October.

2829
01:15:38,251 --> 01:15:41,200
Those two fucking disco with a
with a fucking champagne bottle.

2830
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:43,780
With both hands and he wakes up
in the morning and it feels bad.

2831
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:45,450
It feels bad that the children,

2832
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,673
the children,

2833
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:49,360
I'm going to fight to show
that you got to watch it,

2834
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:49,990
have it.

2835
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:54,040
You got to watch it to be on the show.

2836
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:55,660
He's bat shit crazy now.

2837
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:57,560
You will have it.

2838
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,393
He still loves me.

2839
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:00,640
Does he fly private everywhere?

2840
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:01,630
He's a bad motherfucker.

2841
01:16:01,631 --> 01:16:05,630
Got money and everybody
made all these money.

2842
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:06,230
Listen,

2843
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:06,891
movie was great.

2844
01:16:06,891 --> 01:16:07,600
He made a lot of money,

2845
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,250
but that last week we
probably made eight ball,

2846
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:14,120
$8 $70 for all those other movies
that he made his whole life.

2847
01:16:14,121 --> 01:16:16,210
If he was just reasonably frugal,

2848
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,980
he has hundreds of millions of dollars.

2849
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:18,970
Really?

2850
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:19,810
Oh my God.

2851
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:22,440
How much money did he make
over his career cop baby?

2852
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:23,453
That was,

2853
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:26,373
it

2854
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:28,691
was a blockbuster.

2855
01:16:28,691 --> 01:16:32,550
I went to go see her on that Friday
night and we had to get [inaudible].

2856
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,181
Here's something you have.

2857
01:16:34,181 --> 01:16:37,150
He's Elvis and Easter certainly have
to consider ownership of the movies,

2858
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:38,740
sales of the movies.

2859
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:42,090
He existed back in the day
where people bought DVDs.

2860
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:43,061
Oh Shit.

2861
01:16:43,061 --> 01:16:43,770
This is a good fight.

2862
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:44,603
Makowski on top.

2863
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:46,750
He existed back in the day of blockbuster.

2864
01:16:46,751 --> 01:16:48,550
Back in the day where
people would buy movies.

2865
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,200
You get a percentage of that.

2866
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:52,180
You get a percentage of it
when they sell it to showtime,

2867
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:52,811
Hbo,

2868
01:16:52,811 --> 01:16:53,644
Cinemax,

2869
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:54,730
Tvs,

2870
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:55,420
all that shit.

2871
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:56,980
He got to pretend you have all of that.

2872
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:57,940
I use ball to you.

2873
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,590
He was producing,

2874
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,200
he was a part of the
ownership of those films.

2875
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:04,720
He might have made an
ungodly amount of money.

2876
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:05,380
Yeah.

2877
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:06,070
Brian,

2878
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:07,450
could you beat up how much they man,

2879
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:07,941
how much he,

2880
01:17:07,941 --> 01:17:08,050
man,

2881
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:09,690
I don't think anybody can beat up tableau.

2882
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:10,041
Hold on.

2883
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:10,790
Jamie.

2884
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:11,190
Jamie

2885
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:13,350
up seeing a lot of information online,

2886
01:17:13,351 --> 01:17:15,330
but something I just found said he is the

2887
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,660
hot top 10 highest paid actors for 2016
with an estimated 82 million in combined

2888
01:17:21,661 --> 01:17:22,110
or no.

2889
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:22,943
Oh,

2890
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:24,820
well let's look at his overall earnings.

2891
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:25,663
This

2892
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:27,641
dude,

2893
01:17:27,641 --> 01:17:28,580
I am so hungry.

2894
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:32,710
Sales two 45 $245 million,

2895
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:37,630
like 45 million people don't understand,

2896
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:40,000
but he still looks good.

2897
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:41,140
Let's on flying private.

2898
01:17:41,141 --> 01:17:41,441
I was like,

2899
01:17:41,441 --> 01:17:41,531
oh,

2900
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:42,710
he's being stupid with his money.

2901
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:43,923
Fine.

2902
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:44,590
No,

2903
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:45,280
he's fine,

2904
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:45,491
dude.

2905
01:17:45,491 --> 01:17:46,390
He Scrooge McDuck.

2906
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:49,540
He owns a football team
and vodka and per few does.

2907
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,433
Yes.

2908
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,393
A lot of money.

2909
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:56,480
[inaudible] John Claude van Damme,

2910
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:03,800
you need to stay in Lake [inaudible] name.

2911
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:04,810
I love that guy.

2912
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:05,770
He's my hero.

2913
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:06,850
He's got so much money.

2914
01:18:06,851 --> 01:18:07,371
He could paint a,

2915
01:18:07,371 --> 01:18:09,010
got a fight where they can choreograph.

2916
01:18:09,011 --> 01:18:10,080
He's paying them to show up

2917
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:12,670
a fight,

2918
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:14,470
but they choreograph press conferences.

2919
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,090
He would fuck up everyone in this room.

2920
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:19,120
Maybe he's thought about actually
fighting about three or four times,

2921
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:23,560
but most of the time what it is is just
getting together and saying that you're

2922
01:18:23,561 --> 01:18:25,570
thinking about fighting
and to schedule a it,

2923
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,890
but I have movies tend to,

2924
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,630
he blinded somebody in one of his movies
with that wheel kick and he had to do a

2925
01:18:34,631 --> 01:18:35,800
deposition at his,

2926
01:18:35,801 --> 01:18:37,440
at a trial about how,

2927
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:37,960
look at him.

2928
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:38,710
Look at him.

2929
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:39,543
He's a brilliant,

2930
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:40,450
hey,

2931
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:41,400
who's better looking at Denver,

2932
01:18:41,401 --> 01:18:42,234
Joe Real.

2933
01:18:42,670 --> 01:18:42,881
Oh,

2934
01:18:42,881 --> 01:18:44,590
he's definitely not as
good looking as Alan.

2935
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:49,620
Now back in the day time in the day,

2936
01:18:49,621 --> 01:18:50,500
it was really close

2937
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:53,620
to him all day.

2938
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:01,210
There's no one better looking than
Allen Joe ban that just different.

2939
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:03,710
You don't get better looking.

2940
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:06,210
That's a good cost is not going to be,

2941
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:07,053
this is back.

2942
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:07,841
Oh Shit.

2943
01:19:07,841 --> 01:19:08,674
Look at this.

2944
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:11,140
Meanwhile we don't have
any idea who won and

2945
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:16,340
if any of you fuckers try
to say Benevidez get robbed.

2946
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:17,183
I was

2947
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,290
watching it,

2948
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:21,930
I think is head comes out.

2949
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:24,610
We would do a worse job than you know.

2950
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:26,260
Name your least favorite judge.

2951
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:31,140
I got benefit as the head
cause he's been fucked.

2952
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,330
Turned to the screen.

2953
01:19:34,331 --> 01:19:35,050
Get tired.

2954
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:36,040
I can feel it.

2955
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:37,443
I could feel it.

2956
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,870
Do you put the jeans on man,

2957
01:19:40,871 --> 01:19:41,270
right?

2958
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:42,101
No sweats off.

2959
01:19:42,101 --> 01:19:43,600
Put those genes out right now.

2960
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:46,030
Brian cal and a pair of the barbell jeans.

2961
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,290
So props to barbell jeans.

2962
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:47,731
Eddie Bravo,

2963
01:19:47,731 --> 01:19:51,130
which just took the
second large glass of Vino

2964
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,353
low.

2965
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:58,690
If you were in a fine restaurant,

2966
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:00,190
it's a double son.

2967
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:01,230
Come on most.

2968
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,050
Of course

2969
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,790
he pours a slight sipping thing.

2970
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:07,260
It's a,

2971
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,340
this is a delicious

2972
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,173
wine by the way.

2973
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:12,060
Let me tell you something about Cowan.

2974
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:14,010
This mother fucker knows his one.

2975
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:16,890
I've got a dinner with him and he gets
in a conversation with this shit more.

2976
01:20:16,891 --> 01:20:17,570
Yay.

2977
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:18,403
The bed says,

2978
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:22,620
what do you have in a burgundy from 97 d?

2979
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:23,490
And the guy goes,

2980
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:24,360
oh shit,

2981
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:27,000
this mother fucker's for real cow.

2982
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:28,650
Start talking about different comp,

2983
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,560
different grapes that are
grown on different hillsides,

2984
01:20:31,561 --> 01:20:32,520
and he'll explain,

2985
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:34,320
he'll explain some shit.

2986
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:38,430
We were at this restaurant
and the small we AA was like,

2987
01:20:38,431 --> 01:20:39,120
yes,

2988
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:39,570
correct.

2989
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:40,171
That's correct.

2990
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:41,004
Correct.

2991
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:41,701
Who started,

2992
01:20:41,701 --> 01:20:42,780
he started talking about,

2993
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:44,041
oh my God,

2994
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:45,210
I got to work on your technique.

2995
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:48,660
Inside Kik is you gotta pick your knee up.

2996
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,010
I think John Claude van Damme.

2997
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,090
Where's those two though?

2998
01:20:51,091 --> 01:20:51,600
For sure.

2999
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:51,990
Stretch.

3000
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:53,760
That's why you have to
put your knee up higher.

3001
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:57,120
They look good and there's nothing
that has nothing to do with stretching.

3002
01:20:57,121 --> 01:20:59,750
It's just you just haven't
thrown a sidekick in a while.

3003
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,993
It's a little rusty.

3004
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,593
You can do it.

3005
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,850
You gotta put your socks on before
he came back and people ask him,

3006
01:21:06,851 --> 01:21:08,070
why do you want to put your socks on?

3007
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:09,030
Does that help your kicking?

3008
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,680
You want to put a shoe on?

3009
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,220
Oh,

3010
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,330
you like to kick with shoes on?

3011
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:18,750
Do you still wear those shiny shoes so
that you could throw a roundhouse kicks

3012
01:21:18,751 --> 01:21:19,830
quicker cause he pivots.

3013
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:24,500
If you have a shiny sol
like that's terrible.

3014
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:27,210
You got to pick your knee up.

3015
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:28,860
You have no,

3016
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,930
see it's not bad,

3017
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,500
but you have a inherent flaw in your
technique that probably was never,

3018
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:37,740
never explained to you for 49 million.

3019
01:21:37,741 --> 01:21:38,574
Ain't bad.

3020
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:40,283
It's pretty good.

3021
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:41,213
Not Right.

3022
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:42,900
I wouldn't want to get hit by that.

3023
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,553
Get hit hidden.

3024
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,520
Riding your shower.

3025
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:48,510
That's where you would get hit.

3026
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:50,423
Oh Shit.

3027
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,170
I washed my hands still spinning kicks.

3028
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,073
Right

3029
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:57,301
dude,

3030
01:21:57,301 --> 01:21:58,520
it's wrong though.

3031
01:21:58,521 --> 01:21:59,940
Sounds those genes or Helen.

3032
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:03,630
I used to being serious there.

3033
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:04,261
Are you being serious?

3034
01:22:04,261 --> 01:22:04,830
Show me what?

3035
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:06,530
Show me a real front lake side for real.

3036
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:07,680
All Bullshit.

3037
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,513
All Bullshit.

3038
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:09,480
Well,

3039
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:10,980
just this from here and just throw it.

3040
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:14,120
Let me see the spinning one.

3041
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,481
Show him spinning.

3042
01:22:15,481 --> 01:22:16,314
One kick.

3043
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:17,530
Yeah,

3044
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:18,990
that's my favorite that he does.

3045
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:22,240
It's my favorite two old tear you.

3046
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,760
You just all you have to do different.

3047
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:24,720
The all you're doing wrong.

3048
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:25,920
You're coming up.

3049
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:30,030
You're foot is going up from the
ground like an almost like a half moon,

3050
01:22:30,031 --> 01:22:30,650
right?

3051
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:31,320
Yeah.

3052
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,060
You want to get your knee up higher.

3053
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,100
That's one of the cool
things about those jeans.

3054
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:35,993
Way Higher than that.

3055
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:37,770
You cool things about those June.

3056
01:22:37,771 --> 01:22:38,011
Yeah.

3057
01:22:38,011 --> 01:22:38,640
There's genes.

3058
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,900
These genes that were wearing,

3059
01:22:39,901 --> 01:22:40,830
they're like sweat pants,

3060
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:41,520
man.

3061
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,420
You she just had no,

3062
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:42,491
no,

3063
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:43,020
no.

3064
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:45,360
Don't throw the kick
until your knee is up.

3065
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:47,850
Get your knee up first
and then throw the kick.

3066
01:22:47,851 --> 01:22:49,680
The problem is you're doing
both at the same time.

3067
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:49,821
No,

3068
01:22:49,821 --> 01:22:49,920
no,

3069
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:50,430
no.

3070
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:52,110
Don't throw the kick
into your knees up hot.

3071
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:55,380
Lift your knee up way high past
your waist and then throw the kick.

3072
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:56,940
Yes,

3073
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:59,790
me up first and then don't
look over your stomach.

3074
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,840
Look over your shoulder.

3075
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:02,760
Yeah,

3076
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,260
but knee first here.

3077
01:23:04,261 --> 01:23:05,094
Hold on.

3078
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:06,730
This fucking hysterical.

3079
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:08,140
This is ridiculous.

3080
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:12,310
That's why I'm drunk.

3081
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:13,203
I can't watch.

3082
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:19,820
Watch Joe is going to go off.

3083
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:21,460
Dude.

3084
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,271
Genes on genes,

3085
01:23:22,271 --> 01:23:24,200
on genes here,

3086
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:25,680
up here,

3087
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:25,900
up.

3088
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,330
So flexible pipe companion from here.

3089
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:30,240
Turn your shoulder to the right turn.

3090
01:23:30,241 --> 01:23:31,660
You shown to the right to right now.

3091
01:23:31,690 --> 01:23:33,910
Extent extension and extension straight.

3092
01:23:33,911 --> 01:23:34,870
Don't look over your stomach.

3093
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:37,130
Look over your shoulder like this.

3094
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:37,840
Like that.

3095
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:38,500
That's how you look.

3096
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,340
I know that's not yet.

3097
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:41,680
That's the flexible.

3098
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:42,880
You're fine left right from here.

3099
01:23:42,881 --> 01:23:43,714
Watch.

3100
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:44,950
Oh sons.

3101
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:46,420
Damn

3102
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:49,700
fucking blush.

3103
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:53,380
You lift your knee and then kick.

3104
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,230
I still think John Claude van Damme
beats the fuck out of both of you.

3105
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:59,460
Then kick watch one too.

3106
01:23:59,530 --> 01:23:59,771
Okay.

3107
01:23:59,771 --> 01:24:00,370
Ready?

3108
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:01,630
I'm not mad at Joe's format.

3109
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:06,100
All know no one and then two one up.

3110
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:07,173
All right,

3111
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,370
and he can do play by play.

3112
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:10,023
Shit.

3113
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:11,350
Don't look on your stomach.

3114
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:12,250
I don't know what the fuck.

3115
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:12,900
Well,

3116
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:14,890
I know John Claude van
Damme would be proud.

3117
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:16,590
Are you calling your shoulder?

3118
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:17,440
Look,

3119
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,210
I'm throwing it up here.

3120
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:21,203
I'm like this.

3121
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,240
I'm never like this.

3122
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:23,260
Look at Joe's ass.

3123
01:24:23,261 --> 01:24:24,094
When he throws the kick,

3124
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,080
it's just looking at it.

3125
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:26,920
Don't look,

3126
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:27,671
don't look at the foot.

3127
01:24:27,671 --> 01:24:28,600
He has a set of [inaudible].

3128
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,070
Look at the foot honeydews on them,

3129
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:31,480
right into the glutes.

3130
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:33,100
Looking deeply into them.

3131
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:34,271
Dude,

3132
01:24:34,271 --> 01:24:36,360
I'd love to see our
actual taekwondo match.

3133
01:24:36,361 --> 01:24:36,641
Shrink,

3134
01:24:36,641 --> 01:24:37,474
Callen and relevant.

3135
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:43,930
I would just stare at their asses
to my barbell fucking monster.

3136
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:44,681
They're awesome.

3137
01:24:44,681 --> 01:24:45,130
Right?

3138
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:45,431
Yeah,

3139
01:24:45,431 --> 01:24:45,581
we,

3140
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:46,414
you see my cakes,

3141
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:48,613
you see mine?

3142
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:53,110
Just fundamentally a
little off a little bit.

3143
01:24:53,111 --> 01:24:53,561
He's been here.

3144
01:24:53,561 --> 01:24:54,394
So you get there,

3145
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,400
but that dose does,

3146
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:56,120
that span.

3147
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:56,720
Here is,

3148
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:57,820
everybody fucks that up.

3149
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:58,870
Everybody fucks that up.

3150
01:24:58,871 --> 01:25:01,990
It's a number one thing about the side
kick that people get wrong and it changes

3151
01:25:01,991 --> 01:25:02,824
everything.

3152
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:04,030
If you learn to do it right,

3153
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:05,200
you learned to get that knee up high.

3154
01:25:05,201 --> 01:25:07,890
The power differences fucking substantial.

3155
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:09,843
No,

3156
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:11,891
no.

3157
01:25:11,891 --> 01:25:14,770
You just gotta do it
right with Rogan's help.

3158
01:25:14,771 --> 01:25:16,090
You could be the best

3159
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:19,513
kick yourself.

3160
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:24,460
Dear diary today.

3161
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:27,130
Here's a two bro.

3162
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:28,001
Here's the thing.

3163
01:25:28,001 --> 01:25:29,110
You don't just throw it,

3164
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:31,680
you have to throw it right
or don't throw it right.

3165
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,640
You can't be happy with the scoop

3166
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,120
and the scoop doesn't exist.

3167
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:37,300
Right?

3168
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:38,140
You can't do it.

3169
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:39,003
Fuck your shit.

3170
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:39,941
Kick like that.

3171
01:25:39,941 --> 01:25:41,080
I'd be sick for a year.

3172
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:42,330
Just run

3173
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:47,830
through a bad time.

3174
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:49,570
But it's not,

3175
01:25:49,570 --> 01:25:51,430
it's not a bad sidekick.

3176
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:53,980
It's just you need to
learn how to do it right.

3177
01:25:53,981 --> 01:25:56,860
You need a knee has to come up
high and then you can do it right.

3178
01:25:56,861 --> 01:25:57,370
Like once,

3179
01:25:57,370 --> 01:25:58,480
once I showed you how to do it,

3180
01:25:58,630 --> 01:25:59,560
you were doing it way better.

3181
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:00,071
I'll tell you right.

3182
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:01,270
Last one was the best one.

3183
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:01,781
I'll tell you right now.

3184
01:26:01,781 --> 01:26:03,770
You feel that sidekick with
John Claude van Damme in here.

3185
01:26:03,771 --> 01:26:04,401
He's gonna throw up.

3186
01:26:04,401 --> 01:26:05,450
He's never coming back.

3187
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:05,940
No Dude,

3188
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:06,773
can we get better?

3189
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,840
I'm Dallas to Kim's dangerous.

3190
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:09,770
It's real simple.

3191
01:26:09,771 --> 01:26:12,720
You either do it right or you don't do
it and that's the only way to be a good

3192
01:26:12,730 --> 01:26:14,580
test is 5:00 AM all ready for my,

3193
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:15,030
my,

3194
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:15,651
my last cell.

3195
01:26:15,651 --> 01:26:17,000
You will get quicker.

3196
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,290
You'll feel it.

3197
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:20,450
I'll put a pad you up like Justin.

3198
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,130
I put Justin my Laos and pads.

3199
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,601
Well I pay him.

3200
01:26:23,601 --> 01:26:26,350
Well that's why I hit him on heavy bags
cause you'd be like Freddie Roach about

3201
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,080
three years.

3202
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,400
Leg Pads on him.

3203
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,400
I have leg one guy body pat on him.

3204
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:32,900
I don't kick them in the body though.

3205
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,960
I only kicked him in the tie pads but I
fucked him up with body shots like body

3206
01:26:38,331 --> 01:26:39,164
shots,

3207
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,133
flexeril.

3208
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:41,740
It's so fun.

3209
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:45,740
It gets to the point where here like
paying like dudes to not wear pads.

3210
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:49,340
Let me fuck you up.

3211
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:50,903
Don't

3212
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:56,530
think someone's done that and
you're just bringing them in.

3213
01:26:56,620 --> 01:27:00,040
You just come in and you take a beating
and it'll give you fucking thousand

3214
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,970
dollars time for the kid and he can't.

3215
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:03,980
You know too much about brain damage.

3216
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:11,150
Who knows what's going on with your
[inaudible] going on with your liver.

3217
01:27:11,151 --> 01:27:16,151
When you get fucking like they'll sign
Joe's kick cowboy and the body in that

3218
01:27:16,191 --> 01:27:16,881
need of the body.

3219
01:27:16,881 --> 01:27:17,360
Hi.

3220
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:21,560
Did you show him those spinning heel
kicks and so his body to listen,

3221
01:27:21,561 --> 01:27:22,394
man.

3222
01:27:23,610 --> 01:27:28,610
People get launched across the fucking
the floor from attorney side kick to the

3223
01:27:29,241 --> 01:27:30,020
body.

3224
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:30,980
They get launched

3225
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:33,231
back kicks.

3226
01:27:33,231 --> 01:27:33,531
How many,

3227
01:27:33,531 --> 01:27:34,070
well,

3228
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:37,610
there's a video of me on youtube
kicking the guard and he soars.

3229
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:38,090
Yeah,

3230
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:42,020
he sources the video of me doing that
and they took it down because it's too

3231
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:42,310
dense.

3232
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:42,981
Too dangerous.

3233
01:27:42,981 --> 01:27:43,790
Makes Sense.

3234
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:44,690
I slew him.

3235
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:46,013
I said,

3236
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:47,323
yeah,

3237
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:50,660
I told you guys,

3238
01:27:50,661 --> 01:27:52,730
I called it a love that guy.

3239
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:53,630
Oh Shit.

3240
01:27:53,631 --> 01:27:54,340
He was right.

3241
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,360
I was playing a lot of
games week in this corner.

3242
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:59,540
A kick to the body is always
painful because your leg is strong.

3243
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:01,220
Even if you have a half ass kick,

3244
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:02,630
he throws a kick to the body.

3245
01:28:02,631 --> 01:28:06,590
It's usually stronger than most people's
punches unless you're like some tune

3246
01:28:06,591 --> 01:28:07,220
off type care.

3247
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:08,960
So your shoulders should
take to kick around.

3248
01:28:08,961 --> 01:28:10,970
But when you learn how
to kick and you kick,

3249
01:28:10,971 --> 01:28:13,010
good kick to the body is horrific.

3250
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:13,850
It's horrific.

3251
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:15,050
I save your shoulders account.

3252
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:16,670
You should work on your body.

3253
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:16,970
Stop,

3254
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:17,750
dedicate your life.

3255
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:18,590
All I'm doing,

3256
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:19,740
I cannot do the pocket.

3257
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:21,410
Dedicate your life to kicking.

3258
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:23,710
I think you can afford to pay.

3259
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:25,160
Have to fucking,

3260
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:25,721
hey,

3261
01:28:25,721 --> 01:28:26,760
it's not going to kill him.

3262
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:29,613
Kill him,

3263
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,073
kill him.

3264
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:38,480
Dude's will only be able to last
like 90 seconds tops with Joe.

3265
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:39,270
Joe's going to,

3266
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:40,330
he kicks hard,

3267
01:28:40,331 --> 01:28:40,640
dude,

3268
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:43,610
he's going to need eight guys at
49 he kicks his heart as anybody

3269
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,033
have a few months.

3270
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,960
That's $10,000 you do the kick harder.

3271
01:28:47,961 --> 01:28:49,400
I've been around kicking for a long time.

3272
01:28:49,401 --> 01:28:50,270
You kick harder the name.

3273
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:50,481
Well,

3274
01:28:50,481 --> 01:28:51,370
I learned it.

3275
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,910
I just said I've been
around kicking Toronto.

3276
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:53,810
Good.

3277
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:54,643
That'll feel dated.

3278
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:55,560
Do that.

3279
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:58,890
If he kicks hard back in the day and I,

3280
01:28:58,900 --> 01:28:59,930
and I was right next to him.

3281
01:29:00,150 --> 01:29:02,040
Who I watched boss Rutan.

3282
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:02,850
Hi.

3283
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:03,300
Come on.

3284
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:04,890
Oh my gosh.

3285
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:08,220
How did it sound like I sound
like somebody shooting a shotgun.

3286
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:10,590
Sean's I've ever heard kick a bag,

3287
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:11,920
Pedro.

3288
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:12,450
Yup.

3289
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:13,580
Pedro has those leg kicks.

3290
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:16,140
They scared me more than anything I've
ever seen in my life to wide his hips

3291
01:29:16,141 --> 01:29:16,800
I've ever seen.

3292
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,900
When I saw him kick the bag
of Beverly Hills Jujitsu.

3293
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:19,080
Oh,

3294
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:19,940
all I thought of is,

3295
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,780
is just would take one and I'd be over.

3296
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:24,720
There's no way I would survive
if he kicked me once in the leg.

3297
01:29:24,721 --> 01:29:25,740
My Shit would just give up.

3298
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,480
Had the hardest cake I've ever seen.

3299
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:27,810
Who?

3300
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:30,000
Shane Carlin was a gorilla.

3301
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:30,330
He,

3302
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:32,690
but he never threw every easily
is too tempted to throw him.

3303
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:35,280
He wasn't tempt to throw them in the fight
because they thought to heavy weights

3304
01:29:35,281 --> 01:29:36,114
get counter.

3305
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:38,970
He fucked up so many guys legs in the gym.

3306
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:40,320
They banned them from kicking.

3307
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:40,531
Oh,

3308
01:29:40,531 --> 01:29:41,790
how am I gonna stop kicking?

3309
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:42,571
Well,

3310
01:29:42,571 --> 01:29:43,590
that's terrible idea.

3311
01:29:43,591 --> 01:29:44,850
Why didn't they fucking pay people?

3312
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:46,160
The money does go down.

3313
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:47,953
Just

3314
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:49,970
like car would like,

3315
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,450
didn't Trevor Whitman train him?

3316
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:53,670
Why didn't Trevor have him throwing kicks?

3317
01:29:53,671 --> 01:29:56,910
Because Trevor's a wicked
kicks kicks all the time,

3318
01:29:56,911 --> 01:29:59,610
but then you want to be stowed
in sparring and do it in fights.

3319
01:29:59,670 --> 01:29:59,911
Man,

3320
01:29:59,911 --> 01:30:00,421
that's too bad.

3321
01:30:00,421 --> 01:30:01,440
It's like to a show heavy,

3322
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:05,790
like fuck up your ACRM win
a fucking freak specimen.

3323
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:09,360
As far as like his skeletal muscular
structure every day for how many years?

3324
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:10,470
I can't even imagine.

3325
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:11,671
How would you,

3326
01:30:11,671 --> 01:30:13,800
I don't know how you get
out of the car today.

3327
01:30:13,801 --> 01:30:16,740
I'm going to sh chat stuck in Denver.

3328
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:17,783
Not much to do.

3329
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:22,440
Do they got to start wrapping
or play basketball or class?

3330
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:23,251
Spark car.

3331
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:25,020
Would you wear a football
helmet or something?

3332
01:30:25,021 --> 01:30:27,060
I would never Helma wouldn't help.

3333
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:29,130
Bigger thing for him to hit.

3334
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:30,001
Oh Dude.

3335
01:30:30,001 --> 01:30:33,840
I was living in boulder and I was
training in a mall Easton's and this guy

3336
01:30:33,841 --> 01:30:35,190
walked in and I was,

3337
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:36,300
we were in the middle of the class,

3338
01:30:36,301 --> 01:30:36,481
right?

3339
01:30:36,481 --> 01:30:38,610
We're going over drills
and I saw this guy walk in.

3340
01:30:38,611 --> 01:30:38,851
I'm like,

3341
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:40,110
that's not even a real person.

3342
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:41,730
Can be a real person.

3343
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:44,700
Then I realized it was car when he had
his tee shirt on that looked like it

3344
01:30:44,701 --> 01:30:46,230
probably was made for me.

3345
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:47,223
Dude,

3346
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:52,800
his fucking arms were
my thighs essentially.

3347
01:30:52,801 --> 01:30:54,510
He looks like juggernaut from x men.

3348
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:55,680
He was at the time,

3349
01:30:55,681 --> 01:30:56,470
I mean he wasn't making,

3350
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:59,400
he had to make to 65 so it
car when he's cutting weight.

3351
01:30:59,460 --> 01:30:59,611
Yeah.

3352
01:30:59,611 --> 01:31:00,750
He's caught in a little bit of weight.

3353
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:02,280
He was so big.

3354
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,031
You'll quick me.

3355
01:31:03,031 --> 01:31:04,440
She takes the hottest MMA,

3356
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:07,470
so I a one two biddies on it.

3357
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:11,900
The booty is just out of control and all.

3358
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:13,380
She's just a nice person.

3359
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,670
She's sweet by far.

3360
01:31:14,671 --> 01:31:15,301
The hottest girl.

3361
01:31:15,301 --> 01:31:16,630
I think she's also just,

3362
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:16,981
yeah,

3363
01:31:16,981 --> 01:31:17,814
she's awesome.

3364
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:20,140
There's some fucking pretty decently hot,

3365
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:21,433
hotter.

3366
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:23,960
Some girl that just started fighting
and Bella toward it looks really hot.

3367
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:24,560
Really?

3368
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,180
Yeah.

3369
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:26,790
It was pictures of her tiff time.

3370
01:31:26,791 --> 01:31:27,540
Balmain.

3371
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:30,240
I would've kicked her out of bed frame
and crackers and kicking me in the face.

3372
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:32,790
Roses,

3373
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:33,180
roses,

3374
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:33,960
hottest shit.

3375
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:34,980
Paige vanzants hot.

3376
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:35,331
Yeah,

3377
01:31:35,331 --> 01:31:36,580
I know he pays.

3378
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:37,590
Got Her ass whooped like that.

3379
01:31:37,591 --> 01:31:37,910
I'm like,

3380
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:39,200
I'm off that train now.

3381
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:43,771
No page.

3382
01:31:43,771 --> 01:31:44,640
I'm a page fan.

3383
01:31:44,641 --> 01:31:45,421
Don't get me twisted.

3384
01:31:45,421 --> 01:31:46,254
I'm a page fit,

3385
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,590
but still Misha Tate pound
for Michelle Waterman is sick.

3386
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,350
She has married,

3387
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:52,540
what the fuck

3388
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:55,680
know?

3389
01:31:56,190 --> 01:31:58,170
Agent's Voice of morality.

3390
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,010
Oh really?

3391
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:00,040
That's all I don't

3392
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:00,671
like seeing him around.

3393
01:32:00,671 --> 01:32:01,504
They get punchline that,

3394
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:02,770
well,

3395
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:03,820
enjoy this kick then.

3396
01:32:03,821 --> 01:32:04,654
So

3397
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:09,783
Shit,

3398
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:12,370
they try everything in their
power not to show that.

3399
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:13,241
No,

3400
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:13,691
they don't.

3401
01:32:13,691 --> 01:32:14,830
They show that fucker all the time.

3402
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:15,821
That's in the loop.

3403
01:32:15,821 --> 01:32:16,270
Now.

3404
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:16,871
You know the loop,

3405
01:32:16,871 --> 01:32:18,970
that knockout loop to
plays to Baba O'reilly,

3406
01:32:18,971 --> 01:32:19,804
the WHO Song,

3407
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:20,880
they put Ryan on the,

3408
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:22,610
Oh shit.

3409
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:25,600
Of course he does.

3410
01:32:25,601 --> 01:32:25,731
He,

3411
01:32:25,731 --> 01:32:26,710
he's a part of it.

3412
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:27,580
You fucked up.

3413
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:29,990
You fucked up light.

3414
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:33,120
Dana's going to listen to this and
that shit's going to be marked out.

3415
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:35,730
They listen.

3416
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:38,290
Holly Holm is a fucking legit champion.

3417
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:40,120
He doesn't play favorites that much.

3418
01:32:40,210 --> 01:32:42,790
He might have a love for
Rhonda like as a person,

3419
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:44,570
but the bottom line is business.

3420
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:45,371
Business is business,

3421
01:32:45,371 --> 01:32:46,950
and Holly is the fucking champions.

3422
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:49,180
And with a spectacular result,

3423
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:52,480
you couldn't remove that spectacular
because that was the most spectacular

3424
01:32:52,481 --> 01:32:55,000
result in the history of
women's MMA in the UFC,

3425
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:55,470
right?

3426
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:57,450
100% yes.

3427
01:32:57,950 --> 01:32:59,880
I saw Holly on a private jet,

3428
01:32:59,881 --> 01:33:02,260
which is what we're seeing now.

3429
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:04,710
Holly's having her
first FiveStars trouble,

3430
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:09,740
so it was this mother fucker say before
the podcast started [inaudible] he got,

3431
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,260
we're talking about this for me.

3432
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:18,520
I sucked you in.

3433
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:19,623
Fuck you bro.

3434
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:22,150
I can't handle this on my local

3435
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:24,740
kitchen.

3436
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:25,720
About to go into Ketosis,

3437
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:26,963
emotion,

3438
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:27,990
emotional cutoff,

3439
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:28,841
I think.

3440
01:33:28,841 --> 01:33:30,010
I think it's really easy.

3441
01:33:30,011 --> 01:33:31,300
Meet Misha and Holly.

3442
01:33:31,330 --> 01:33:33,350
I think if if Nisha keys,

3443
01:33:33,351 --> 01:33:34,450
it took Holly down.

3444
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:36,130
If Meesha can't take Holly down,

3445
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:37,090
Holly's going to win.

3446
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:41,470
She's easily going to precision or she
can be shamed if she could take her down.

3447
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:42,800
If she could take her down.

3448
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:44,350
I don't think,

3449
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:47,310
I don't think Holly's Jujitsu
is anywhere near me shows

3450
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:52,330
and she's going to write her up.

3451
01:33:52,331 --> 01:33:52,511
Hey,

3452
01:33:52,511 --> 01:33:53,710
Misha went three rounds.

3453
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:56,283
Hit the brakes.

3454
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:59,230
Let's not say she's going to do
this because we really don't know.

3455
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:01,170
I really have a problem
when people get that

3456
01:34:04,450 --> 01:34:05,201
he's going to lie to her.

3457
01:34:05,201 --> 01:34:06,034
Hey,

3458
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:08,140
get her mind her up.

3459
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:09,670
I don't really think we should say that.

3460
01:34:09,671 --> 01:34:11,200
You don't think that's a fair assessment?

3461
01:34:11,201 --> 01:34:12,240
Just disrespectful.

3462
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:13,030
Disagree.

3463
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:13,750
This is what I think.

3464
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:14,590
I think honestly,

3465
01:34:14,591 --> 01:34:16,210
I think Misha Tate is a better grappler.

3466
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:19,050
I think we should take dominated Sarah
McMahon on the ground and flipped her

3467
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:20,860
over on her back and held her down,

3468
01:34:20,861 --> 01:34:22,180
which is a giant accomplishment.

3469
01:34:22,181 --> 01:34:22,420
Yes.

3470
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:25,990
How grappled her out ground around and
showed some bad ass striking against

3471
01:34:25,991 --> 01:34:28,590
Jessica [inaudible] with a Ken strife.

3472
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:30,520
I man also is not going to be ridiculous.

3473
01:34:30,521 --> 01:34:31,630
She's not going to charge.

3474
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:35,200
She's not going to be Chin
up face first Thompson out.

3475
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:38,380
All I'm saying is that I don't
think it's disrespectful.

3476
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:39,430
I would never be disrespectful.

3477
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:40,580
However,

3478
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:40,801
no,

3479
01:34:40,801 --> 01:34:40,990
no,

3480
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:41,823
no,

3481
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:43,181
no.

3482
01:34:43,181 --> 01:34:44,014
10 minutes ago.

3483
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:47,680
Hey Dash rectal junk lot for sure.

3484
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:47,901
No,

3485
01:34:47,901 --> 01:34:49,780
the chitlins genes haven't
been worked out yet,

3486
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:52,520
but those jeans are
like fucking yoga pants.

3487
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:54,550
They need to be these fibers.

3488
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:55,650
The fibers is still tight.

3489
01:34:55,651 --> 01:34:57,860
I put these on today and
I from the broken man,

3490
01:34:57,861 --> 01:34:57,980
look

3491
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,720
at how flexible you
are from the same pack.

3492
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:00,710
I'm getting turned on.

3493
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:02,300
I like listen,

3494
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:02,750
listen.

3495
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:03,920
They come from the same box.

3496
01:35:03,921 --> 01:35:04,720
These are new.

3497
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:05,553
Those are,

3498
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:06,500
hold on,

3499
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:06,770
let me,

3500
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:06,920
yeah,

3501
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:07,300
now the,

3502
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:07,871
now they're broken.

3503
01:35:07,871 --> 01:35:11,090
I said no because I still
have the tag on them.

3504
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,590
I don't know about that
does look very broken down.

3505
01:35:12,591 --> 01:35:13,101
I think you're lying.

3506
01:35:13,101 --> 01:35:13,970
I just got them now.

3507
01:35:13,971 --> 01:35:15,230
You put them on that machine you bought,

3508
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:15,921
you bought it,

3509
01:35:15,921 --> 01:35:16,970
put them on a gene machine.

3510
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:17,923
Just listens.

3511
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:19,281
I didn't buy them.

3512
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:20,210
They send them to me for free.

3513
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:21,403
I don't think it's

3514
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,200
the greatest strikers ever,

3515
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:27,890
ever for women in MMA.

3516
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:32,340
MMA you wanna you want
to Emj check I signed,

3517
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:33,650
I would say Holly,

3518
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:36,370
Holly and Holly.

3519
01:35:36,590 --> 01:35:41,590
Holly and you want to say that to say
she would like anybody out for k o power

3520
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:43,400
but to say that Hollywood line up,

3521
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:44,660
anybody's not disrespectful.

3522
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:45,500
It's a compliment to Holly.

3523
01:35:45,501 --> 01:35:48,080
It's not a dis this till we were
saying she's going to light her up.

3524
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:48,973
I believe that.

3525
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:52,460
And that's not being disrespectful or
Meesha might take her to the ground to be

3526
01:35:52,461 --> 01:35:55,070
able to dominate her from there cause
I've taking her down her take down the

3527
01:35:55,071 --> 01:35:55,400
fences.

3528
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,040
Awesome.

3529
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:56,873
She's never been to,

3530
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:59,450
she might not be able to get taken down.

3531
01:35:59,451 --> 01:36:00,500
She's never been down before.

3532
01:36:00,501 --> 01:36:01,400
She can,

3533
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:01,870
if she,

3534
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:03,410
if we should think DFA,

3535
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:05,660
I think Misha is going to,

3536
01:36:05,661 --> 01:36:06,080
uh,

3537
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,460
if she can take her down,

3538
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,280
she's going to be all over on the ground.

3539
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,100
We don't know cause it's really a mystery.

3540
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:16,640
Like we haven't seen Holly on the ground
except for those brief moments with

3541
01:36:16,641 --> 01:36:16,971
Rhonda.

3542
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:20,210
What she got out of Ron is armbar
attempt and where she took Rhonda down.

3543
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:21,303
All we know,

3544
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:25,160
it's all I know as far as you might have
some inside information from gyms for

3545
01:36:25,161 --> 01:36:26,060
people who trained with her.

3546
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:27,410
I'd always seen,

3547
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:28,311
I know this,

3548
01:36:28,311 --> 01:36:31,970
I think it's a tougher matchup
stylistic wise for Holly then Rhonda.

3549
01:36:32,050 --> 01:36:32,200
Well,

3550
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:33,033
what do you know?

3551
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:33,640
Well,

3552
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,130
um,

3553
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:35,270
I know that uh,

3554
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:38,150
she's not obsessed with Jujitsu.

3555
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:40,700
She's one of those and there's
a lot of MMA fighters like that.

3556
01:36:40,701 --> 01:36:41,420
I couldn't go,

3557
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:44,180
I could just rattle
names off left and right.

3558
01:36:44,181 --> 01:36:45,110
There's a lot of guys,

3559
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:47,730
they just want to stand and bang and work.

3560
01:36:47,731 --> 01:36:48,281
The wrestling.

3561
01:36:48,281 --> 01:36:49,370
I'll work to get up.

3562
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,200
They don't want to
fucking learn Jiu Jitsu.

3563
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:52,011
There's so many.

3564
01:36:52,011 --> 01:36:53,000
They're still around.

3565
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:54,770
They didn't want to work on their back.

3566
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,750
They just want to beat
the shit out of people,

3567
01:36:56,900 --> 01:37:01,010
take them fucking down and get on top or
not even fucking take them down to stay

3568
01:37:01,011 --> 01:37:02,330
in bang and,

3569
01:37:02,331 --> 01:37:03,770
and work on their takedown defense.

3570
01:37:03,771 --> 01:37:04,610
If they get taken down,

3571
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:05,930
work on getting back up.

3572
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:06,831
That's sad.

3573
01:37:06,831 --> 01:37:07,520
That tree.

3574
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:08,690
That's barbarian.

3575
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:10,023
That's Holly.

3576
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:12,290
Yeah.

3577
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:13,430
That's a lot of guys like that.

3578
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,960
And I hear Holly is one of those guys.

3579
01:37:14,961 --> 01:37:17,330
She just wants to stay in the girl girls.

3580
01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:19,100
She's one of those fighters.

3581
01:37:21,330 --> 01:37:22,160
And what,

3582
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:22,971
what those,

3583
01:37:22,971 --> 01:37:23,420
uh,

3584
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:28,420
fighters all have in common that they're
generally not known to have a dangerous

3585
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:32,990
weapons off their back and they usually,

3586
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:36,020
she gives a fuck up and kitchen
kicks bitches in the face,

3587
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:39,830
especially in women's divisions

3588
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:42,483
do,

3589
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:43,520
does she have to worry about,

3590
01:37:43,521 --> 01:37:44,354
and the women's division,

3591
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:50,120
she works on takedown defense a lot
and she works on getting back up a lot.

3592
01:37:50,121 --> 01:37:50,954
That's what I hear.

3593
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:51,820
And that then kicking,

3594
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:56,130
you can get it through their
lesson to be learned that MMA math

3595
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:58,770
doesn't really work and
it styles really match up.

3596
01:37:58,771 --> 01:37:59,610
Weird sometimes.

3597
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:02,110
And this might be a case like
the Misha Tate [inaudible],

3598
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:03,040
Holly Holm fight,

3599
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:04,620
I think a very tough fight.

3600
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:06,163
She's sneaky,

3601
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:07,550
she's sneaky and she's tired.

3602
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:08,910
She does a lot of good.

3603
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:10,530
She's got a lot of good skills.

3604
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,221
He's got good skills.

3605
01:38:11,221 --> 01:38:13,980
She's handwriting or two fights
with their fucking hands up high.

3606
01:38:13,981 --> 01:38:16,710
She doesn't rush in and take
crazy chances and she can pop.

3607
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:18,120
She dropped Jessica.

3608
01:38:18,121 --> 01:38:20,410
I was super game as fuck.

3609
01:38:20,470 --> 01:38:21,390
She ain't she,

3610
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,850
she's crying and she's
great in the transition.

3611
01:38:24,130 --> 01:38:25,180
Really good trend and like,

3612
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:26,250
like Holly,

3613
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:29,230
she's lost and been beaten up before
she got beat up by cats and gone,

3614
01:38:29,231 --> 01:38:30,330
oh she's been to the mountain.

3615
01:38:30,350 --> 01:38:32,910
Just came back strong hundred
percent that coming back stronger.

3616
01:38:32,911 --> 01:38:35,190
It's big cause she came
back and beat Jessica,

3617
01:38:35,191 --> 01:38:36,300
I and Sarah McMahon.

3618
01:38:36,301 --> 01:38:39,510
I thought like showing more
determination show like more grit.

3619
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:43,170
Like she was her back was against the
wall after losing that fight to cat and

3620
01:38:43,171 --> 01:38:44,150
she came back stronger.

3621
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:46,380
Let's see what I've seen from
what I've seen with my eye,

3622
01:38:46,410 --> 01:38:47,243
whether I'm right or not,

3623
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,930
it just looks like Holly.

3624
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:51,450
Holly not only is a higher level striker,

3625
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:52,800
I think Holly,

3626
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:53,791
just from what I've seen,

3627
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:55,520
has much more snap and speed.

3628
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:56,320
No question.

3629
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:56,740
But you know,

3630
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:57,990
it just so many fast.

3631
01:38:57,991 --> 01:38:58,990
She's a 19 he shows,

3632
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:02,690
he shows record is way better than,

3633
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:03,543
but Maven,

3634
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:04,111
here's the thing.

3635
01:39:04,111 --> 01:39:04,321
Yeah.

3636
01:39:04,321 --> 01:39:07,040
But then mainly a striker
and not an MMA person.

3637
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:07,251
Right.

3638
01:39:07,251 --> 01:39:09,690
He sang her boxing is
unquestionably better.

3639
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:10,381
Unquestionably.

3640
01:39:10,381 --> 01:39:14,430
She's arguably going kicked best striking
credentials ever in the history of the

3641
01:39:14,431 --> 01:39:15,241
women's division.

3642
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:15,451
Sure.

3643
01:39:15,451 --> 01:39:16,380
And kicking time,

3644
01:39:16,381 --> 01:39:17,340
world boxing champion.

3645
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:19,290
The only one who comes
close as you want her,

3646
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,840
cause she's six time world more touch him.

3647
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:21,150
Right.

3648
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:22,410
When it comes to actual champions.

3649
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:25,620
But Meesha can grapple,

3650
01:39:25,621 --> 01:39:26,580
she can clinch,

3651
01:39:26,581 --> 01:39:29,700
she can avoid striking and she doesn't
necessarily have to kickbox with her.

3652
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:31,470
So it becomes a very
different proposition.

3653
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:32,840
So if they went kickboxing,

3654
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:33,660
kickboxing,

3655
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:34,051
yes.

3656
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:36,090
If they had an MMA kickboxing match,

3657
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:37,170
which is where they essentially,

3658
01:39:37,171 --> 01:39:41,400
the Rhonda fight was except for two
brief moments if they went kickboxing.

3659
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:41,641
Yeah.

3660
01:39:41,641 --> 01:39:42,720
Holly's gonna fuck her up,

3661
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:45,570
but in MMA me Shit's fucking smart.

3662
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:46,170
She's,

3663
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:47,100
she's sneaky.

3664
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:50,730
She knows a lot of shit and she's been
there before and she's tough and she

3665
01:39:50,731 --> 01:39:51,570
knows she's tough.

3666
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:55,590
She knows she can grind it
out in a grueling brawl.

3667
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:56,070
Yes.

3668
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:59,100
And she has a real shot.

3669
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:00,390
She's got a real shot.

3670
01:40:00,391 --> 01:40:00,571
See,

3671
01:40:00,571 --> 01:40:01,110
I think,

3672
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:02,010
I think Misha,

3673
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:04,170
she's never going to beat Rhonda,

3674
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,270
but Meesha can be Holly to be champion.

3675
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:07,740
I just think stylistic wise,

3676
01:40:07,741 --> 01:40:08,710
it's a much better match.

3677
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:10,980
The Holly Holly's lateral movement,

3678
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,550
we won't know a lot,

3679
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,070
but I know in mixed martial arts,

3680
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:17,640
I think stylistic was Misha has a way
better chance beating Holly and then she

3681
01:40:17,641 --> 01:40:18,110
does Ron.

3682
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:18,260
Yeah.

3683
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:22,890
Also there's a big difference between
someone who is fighting off the back leg

3684
01:40:22,891 --> 01:40:24,000
as a counter person,

3685
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:27,750
which Holly is just ridiculously
good at her counters.

3686
01:40:27,751 --> 01:40:29,640
Her timing was fucking spectacular,

3687
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:32,580
but Rhonda was presenting
a predictable target.

3688
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:34,050
There was a lot of ride forward.

3689
01:40:34,051 --> 01:40:35,100
There was a lot of aggression.

3690
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:35,211
It's,

3691
01:40:35,211 --> 01:40:35,401
I'll show,

3692
01:40:35,401 --> 01:40:38,310
you know Holly had to do so all
hog it had to do was be patient,

3693
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:42,540
find the right foot work and catch her
coming in cause she knew she was coming

3694
01:40:42,541 --> 01:40:42,820
in.

3695
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:45,150
So it was an exercise and
moving back in countering,

3696
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:47,910
she knew exactly what
she was preparing for me.

3697
01:40:47,911 --> 01:40:48,900
She's not going to do that.

3698
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,310
He'll remember.

3699
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:54,010
But if you remember like
there was a a fighters like

3700
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:58,150
most notably Patrick Otay that fought
Anderson Silva and he didn't lead and when

3701
01:40:58,151 --> 01:40:58,901
he didn't lead,

3702
01:40:58,901 --> 01:41:00,550
Anderson did not look nearly as good.

3703
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,180
Horrible.

3704
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:04,630
He's a horrible fight because
cat [inaudible] has an iron jaw,

3705
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:07,270
he's got knockout power and he's smart.

3706
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:08,350
So what does he do?

3707
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:10,480
He knows that Anderson is
a wizard at countering,

3708
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:12,580
so he's not his predictable,

3709
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:14,170
usual aggressive.

3710
01:41:14,171 --> 01:41:16,530
So I don't think those two
girls on the same level is no,

3711
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:17,680
they're not on the same level.

3712
01:41:17,681 --> 01:41:21,190
Holly is Holly's on a very
high level Shaman for women.

3713
01:41:21,191 --> 01:41:25,900
When I was at a higher level striking
did an under hook and trying to find out

3714
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:28,020
what's the right,

3715
01:41:28,190 --> 01:41:29,080
this is what we're going to find.

3716
01:41:29,081 --> 01:41:29,914
What surprised me.

3717
01:41:30,450 --> 01:41:31,271
I think Holly,

3718
01:41:31,271 --> 01:41:33,160
I think Holly is so much stronger.

3719
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:37,150
I was amazed at how she looked
and so much stronger than Rhonda,

3720
01:41:37,151 --> 01:41:38,410
Rhonda strongest Shit.

3721
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:40,750
And it felt like Hollywood does fight.

3722
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:42,100
Ain't got his phone around by the way.

3723
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:46,840
And she's gonna be stronger than me
despite out of the first early phase.

3724
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:49,110
Xiao Casey's house looked like Doodoo.

3725
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:49,983
They Lee.

3726
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:50,291
Well,

3727
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:51,520
he's had some rough fights,

3728
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:51,970
man.

3729
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:55,390
Patrick Cummings really
beat him down last round.

3730
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:56,470
That was in Brazil.

3731
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:57,850
That was a crazy fight,

3732
01:41:57,851 --> 01:41:58,300
man.

3733
01:41:58,300 --> 01:41:58,421
Oh,

3734
01:41:58,421 --> 01:41:59,450
sees a motherfucker.

3735
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:01,590
He's in the first round and
he's a super athlete man.

3736
01:42:01,591 --> 01:42:03,760
And that powerful left kick sick.

3737
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:05,260
He's got a nasty left kick.

3738
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:06,970
He's a dude that just
keeps getting better too.

3739
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:08,440
If you can get him down,

3740
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:09,820
if he can get him down,

3741
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:12,670
you can win the III trial
for the NFL a bunch of times.

3742
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:13,533
Nope.

3743
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:14,111
I thought he did.

3744
01:42:14,111 --> 01:42:14,530
Nope,

3745
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:15,210
he just played that,

3746
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:15,390
uh,

3747
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:15,650
you know,

3748
01:42:15,650 --> 01:42:16,930
she had Tennessee and
then went straight to,

3749
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:17,440
uh,

3750
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:17,741
he didn't,

3751
01:42:17,741 --> 01:42:18,131
he didn't,

3752
01:42:18,131 --> 01:42:18,964
uh,

3753
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:20,200
he's a serious athlete,

3754
01:42:20,201 --> 01:42:20,800
ma'am.

3755
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,000
Maybe you went to combine or something,

3756
01:42:22,001 --> 01:42:22,440
but yeah,

3757
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:23,530
not the NFL combine,

3758
01:42:23,531 --> 01:42:24,180
but he really,

3759
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:24,310
no,

3760
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:28,150
he didn't get tryouts with the NFL
when he knocked out shogun step away.

3761
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:28,983
Left Hook.

3762
01:42:29,030 --> 01:42:29,771
He was nasty.

3763
01:42:29,771 --> 01:42:31,510
He let everybody know what's up.

3764
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:31,760
I'll do.

3765
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,500
It was a big message Jamie.

3766
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:34,343
While they're doing shogun.

3767
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:37,053
No shogun.

3768
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:38,111
It is.

3769
01:42:38,111 --> 01:42:38,381
Yes.

3770
01:42:38,381 --> 01:42:38,741
Yes,

3771
01:42:38,741 --> 01:42:39,310
yes.

3772
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:41,570
Who's Liotta fighting Leona's
fighters don't understand him.

3773
01:42:42,330 --> 01:42:43,120
Nothing.

3774
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,400
That's a weird fucking for
nothing on both of those.

3775
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:46,180
How dare you.

3776
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:47,013
Thanks for nothing.

3777
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:48,010
You wouldn't watch that.

3778
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:49,000
Nah.

3779
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:49,840
10 years ago I would.

3780
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:50,620
Okay.

3781
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:55,620
I will absolutely watch Leo's crunk
always crunk crunk photo oto fight.

3782
01:42:57,190 --> 01:42:58,530
Cause the Oto just uh,

3783
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:02,140
a year and a half ago knocked out Mark
Munoz with that wicked left head kick.

3784
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:04,510
Leo was one of my favorite
people on the planet.

3785
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:06,250
I'm just saying and sold.

3786
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:07,450
Can we give them something else?

3787
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:08,020
Well,

3788
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:11,680
Dan Henderson has a bunch of fights left
and his contract and I think he still

3789
01:43:11,681 --> 01:43:12,580
thinks that he can do it.

3790
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:13,563
And uh,

3791
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:14,800
you got to let it go like that.

3792
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:15,760
He deserves the right.

3793
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:16,643
Yeah.

3794
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:19,540
Two unsuccessful attempts
to professional football.

3795
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:20,351
So there it goes.

3796
01:43:20,351 --> 01:43:20,741
You were right.

3797
01:43:20,741 --> 01:43:22,150
Brian doesn't say NFL though,

3798
01:43:22,151 --> 01:43:22,630
does it?

3799
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:22,841
Well,

3800
01:43:22,841 --> 01:43:24,250
I would imagine on football.

3801
01:43:24,251 --> 01:43:24,700
No,

3802
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:26,880
not at [inaudible] Italian.

3803
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:28,690
You can be CFL.

3804
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:29,470
AFL,

3805
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:31,180
really peripheral ton.

3806
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:31,931
Brendan Schaub,

3807
01:43:31,931 --> 01:43:33,820
former NFL player with fucking logic.

3808
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:35,500
Maybe you should listen.

3809
01:43:35,660 --> 01:43:36,493
I know

3810
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:38,423
for 20 years

3811
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:40,653
who got hurt?

3812
01:43:41,830 --> 01:43:43,330
He kicked him and he fucked his leg up.

3813
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:45,580
He kicked him fucked up.

3814
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:46,443
Where did he kick him?

3815
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:51,450
I need to see him again so he
can't get his legs fucked up leg,

3816
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:52,853
but he's limping.

3817
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:54,013
He might hurt his knee.

3818
01:43:55,110 --> 01:43:56,330
His training camp.

3819
01:43:56,331 --> 01:43:56,931
His team.

3820
01:43:56,931 --> 01:43:57,764
I have no clue.

3821
01:43:57,860 --> 01:43:59,360
I have no idea who he's
trading in his leg.

3822
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:00,850
His left leg is real wobbly man,

3823
01:44:00,910 --> 01:44:01,171
man.

3824
01:44:01,171 --> 01:44:02,004
She changed.

3825
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:03,530
When you went to South Park,

3826
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:04,900
did you see what happened at the April?

3827
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:05,780
This is auctioned off.

3828
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:07,360
Did you see what happened to me?

3829
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:10,250
He kicked a homeboy and hurt his leg.

3830
01:44:10,251 --> 01:44:10,820
Kicking him.

3831
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:10,950
Oh,

3832
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:11,960
like Shinny Shin.

3833
01:44:12,090 --> 01:44:15,230
Something happened like this
back to ou stuck it again.

3834
01:44:15,231 --> 01:44:16,064
He's not moving.

3835
01:44:16,090 --> 01:44:17,990
I saw that was the wrong leg.

3836
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:18,770
He's not moving at face.

3837
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:20,020
Y'All just to the right leg.

3838
01:44:20,021 --> 01:44:21,600
You're talking about the left leg and

3839
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:24,383
he switched us.

3840
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:25,840
He started out in south Pandosy.

3841
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:29,620
Switch cause is fucked up so he's
kicking with the fucked up leg is is

3842
01:44:29,621 --> 01:44:30,920
supporting line the leg.

3843
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:33,500
His right leg is super fucked up.

3844
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:34,893
Punched.

3845
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:35,773
Oh that's weird.

3846
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:36,021
Yeah,

3847
01:44:36,021 --> 01:44:37,160
he got his knee messed up.

3848
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:40,100
Isn't it weird just to try to see
a guy tried to hide that shit.

3849
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:42,290
You know what was the
best I've ever seen at it?

3850
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:43,021
You're right.

3851
01:44:43,021 --> 01:44:43,854
Hall.

3852
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:49,060
Uriah hall had his foot fucked up so
bad that it's toe was hanging off and he

3853
01:44:49,491 --> 01:44:53,690
came back to his corner and you can see
we've got a camera on it so we could get

3854
01:44:53,691 --> 01:44:54,524
a look at it.

3855
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:57,500
His foot was completely
fucked up like his toe.

3856
01:44:57,501 --> 01:44:59,420
The bone was sticking out of his toe.

3857
01:44:59,830 --> 01:45:00,663
Jon Jones,

3858
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:01,401
Jon Jones,

3859
01:45:01,401 --> 01:45:02,480
that was after the fight.

3860
01:45:02,481 --> 01:45:04,180
That was after it was over your Riaa.

3861
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:06,080
What I'm saying is he
went back to his corner,

3862
01:45:06,081 --> 01:45:09,750
like barely could walk and then when
the round started that motherfucker

3863
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:11,210
completely ignored it.

3864
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:12,710
He was throwing kicks with it.

3865
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:16,400
It's fucking toe was hanging off and
he's throwing wheel kicks with it.

3866
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:16,941
Yeah.

3867
01:45:16,941 --> 01:45:18,950
There's this total like you
see how fucked up it is.

3868
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:22,650
It was broken off to the right
and the bone was coming out.

3869
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:24,710
Like I could see the worst air shows.

3870
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:27,260
Uriah hall is a bad motherfucker.

3871
01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:28,940
He is a bad motherfucker.

3872
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:30,163
He hasn't fun awhile,

3873
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:30,890
Huh?

3874
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:32,660
Well he lost a gay guard member.

3875
01:45:33,930 --> 01:45:34,551
Beat gay guard.

3876
01:45:34,551 --> 01:45:35,410
Then he lost two.

3877
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:36,753
I'm sorry dude.

3878
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:37,623
We lost her

3879
01:45:39,190 --> 01:45:39,681
being very,

3880
01:45:39,681 --> 01:45:40,520
very careful here.

3881
01:45:40,521 --> 01:45:41,180
Huh?

3882
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:43,190
The fight we gay guard was
spectacular victory for him.

3883
01:45:43,191 --> 01:45:45,720
1:00 AM I getting gate guard
still ranked higher than them.

3884
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:46,581
That's crazy.

3885
01:45:46,581 --> 01:45:47,414
That doesn't make any sense.

3886
01:45:48,450 --> 01:45:49,130
Fells ladies.

3887
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:49,430
Right,

3888
01:45:49,430 --> 01:45:49,820
right.

3889
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:50,270
Yeah.

3890
01:45:50,270 --> 01:45:50,741
Tail slate.

3891
01:45:50,741 --> 01:45:51,574
This and I haven't seen,

3892
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:55,250
and this is another one who fought
very smart against Anderson Silva.

3893
01:45:55,490 --> 01:45:59,860
He's another one that went five
rounds where they're swinging,

3894
01:45:59,861 --> 01:46:00,291
so I'm like,

3895
01:46:00,291 --> 01:46:01,124
oh,

3896
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:01,971
you had him.

3897
01:46:01,971 --> 01:46:02,690
Wow.

3898
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:04,790
You had him look at that look.

3899
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:05,780
Oh Shit.

3900
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,450
It looks like he can throw some
elbows from the guard and open.

3901
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:08,730
Same.

3902
01:46:08,730 --> 01:46:10,740
Who's on top right now with a phage?

3903
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:11,623
His guard.

3904
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:14,180
He's got good left elbow with the card.

3905
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:18,350
One thing about a guy like phaseout though
is it Fazio was a really good striker

3906
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:21,620
and really good strikers are hard to
ground and pound cause they don't panic.

3907
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:22,400
They don't lock up,

3908
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:23,150
relax.

3909
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:24,110
They get used to getting hit.

3910
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,900
They know how to roll with things
and they know what's coming.

3911
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:31,460
You know like their Iq as far as like
striking like where the right hand's

3912
01:46:31,461 --> 01:46:31,760
common,

3913
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:32,740
where the left hand is coming,

3914
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:35,210
what position you're in to put
like real torque behind something.

3915
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,360
You rarely catch some clean like look out,

3916
01:46:37,490 --> 01:46:40,710
see how clever he's moving
when he's off his shit.

3917
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:44,040
Fight Anderson back in the day on and off.

3918
01:46:44,290 --> 01:46:47,540
No he fought king mo and knocked him
out and strike force to win the title.

3919
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:48,590
He's a bad motherfucker.

3920
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:49,980
Yeah but you know phase

3921
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:50,530
Xiao.

3922
01:46:50,530 --> 01:46:51,490
Is that a tough stint?

3923
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:52,020
Yeah,

3924
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:53,220
he's had some ups and downs.

3925
01:46:53,221 --> 01:46:54,054
He might've took,

3926
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:56,610
he might've gotten the UFC like
a little later in his career.

3927
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:56,851
You know,

3928
01:46:56,851 --> 01:46:59,520
it'd be a little late for
like him at his best effort.

3929
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:04,140
Should they be massaging
has near right now.

3930
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:05,573
Do something.

3931
01:47:06,450 --> 01:47:06,811
No,

3932
01:47:06,811 --> 01:47:07,980
I don't know what's wrong with it.

3933
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:09,173
I mean,

3934
01:47:09,410 --> 01:47:10,200
it's Ashley,

3935
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,520
could it have been a charley horse?

3936
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:13,410
We know that Sasha is,

3937
01:47:13,411 --> 01:47:14,190
fuck,

3938
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:14,760
I push.

3939
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:16,590
It depended upon he's
putting a skin patch.

3940
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:17,673
Might hurt his foot.

3941
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:18,690
I feel like this a bad idea.

3942
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:19,950
Put ice before you go out there.

3943
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:20,480
Yeah.

3944
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,170
Might be praying the inflammation down.

3945
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:25,260
Oh,

3946
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:27,310
he might've broke his foot
when he threw that leg kicks.

3947
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:28,153
He's,

3948
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:29,880
you know,

3949
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:31,600
he might've blew his knee out or blue.

3950
01:47:31,601 --> 01:47:32,670
His foot out or something.

3951
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:34,020
Yeah.

3952
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:34,890
Damn man,

3953
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:35,701
that's too bad.

3954
01:47:35,701 --> 01:47:35,921
Yeah.

3955
01:47:35,921 --> 01:47:36,121
Yeah.

3956
01:47:36,121 --> 01:47:37,200
He's having a hard time on it.

3957
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,430
See how it's kind of wobbly.

3958
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:40,403
Kind of get that win.

3959
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:42,180
But it's just interesting.

3960
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:42,481
You know,

3961
01:47:42,481 --> 01:47:44,430
like little variations in someone's gait.

3962
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:45,533
You could see it.

3963
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:47,521
Oh,

3964
01:47:47,521 --> 01:47:48,120
look at them.

3965
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:52,530
This is why I think I'm so excited about
what's going on right now with MMA,

3966
01:47:52,531 --> 01:47:57,531
with guys working on this crazy footwork
like the Duane Ludwig like camp with

3967
01:47:58,021 --> 01:47:59,700
the Tj Dillashaw style foot work,

3968
01:47:59,701 --> 01:48:01,200
Dominick Cruz's footwork,

3969
01:48:01,410 --> 01:48:02,700
Conor Mcgregor's footwork,

3970
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:04,810
emotion coach show all this coaches.

3971
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:05,210
Yeah,

3972
01:48:05,210 --> 01:48:05,660
tape.

3973
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:06,810
She texted me the day goes,

3974
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:07,793
hey man,

3975
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:09,510
you have any movement coach in La?

3976
01:48:09,511 --> 01:48:10,320
I text back.

3977
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,153
Fuck you.

3978
01:48:15,010 --> 01:48:17,010
I don't deal with that bullshit.

3979
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:21,780
Fuck fuck you started laughing.

3980
01:48:21,890 --> 01:48:23,040
Do that is so funny.

3981
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:24,720
If you an MMA fan,

3982
01:48:24,721 --> 01:48:25,710
you understand why that will.

3983
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:28,530
That is so funny because I'm
guilty of it as much as anybody,

3984
01:48:28,531 --> 01:48:32,070
but I can't shut the fuck up about
moving balls deep in it balls deep.

3985
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:33,900
I had the move game guy.

3986
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:37,800
Can we keep that guy who made coach?

3987
01:48:37,801 --> 01:48:38,400
He was great.

3988
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:38,551
Oh,

3989
01:48:38,551 --> 01:48:39,180
what's your uh,

3990
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:39,770
background?

3991
01:48:39,770 --> 01:48:40,290
Uh,

3992
01:48:40,290 --> 01:48:42,240
as a kid I climbed on
trees and played with rock.

3993
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:44,000
Oh,

3994
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:44,760
mark tick.

3995
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:45,180
Oh yeah.

3996
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:45,871
What's your degree?

3997
01:48:45,871 --> 01:48:47,190
I played with Legos as a kid.

3998
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:47,670
Yeah.

3999
01:48:47,670 --> 01:48:50,360
It would've been nice if he
had to like a more like ready

4000
01:48:51,950 --> 01:48:53,490
as zero.

4001
01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:54,810
And I think he knows a lot.

4002
01:48:54,811 --> 01:48:55,644
I mean

4003
01:48:58,960 --> 01:48:59,793
real about it.

4004
01:48:59,820 --> 01:49:04,290
I think he knows a lot
about proprioception and
some of the things he was

4005
01:49:04,291 --> 01:49:04,771
talking about,

4006
01:49:04,771 --> 01:49:06,350
about balance and coordination.

4007
01:49:06,610 --> 01:49:07,860
Look like in Carlos fight.

4008
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:08,990
Listen man,

4009
01:49:08,990 --> 01:49:09,670
he's always wanting to,

4010
01:49:09,670 --> 01:49:10,800
you won that fight anyways,

4011
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:11,790
but I don't think he moved to,

4012
01:49:11,791 --> 01:49:14,820
well I think he's only been working with
them for a short amount of time and you

4013
01:49:14,821 --> 01:49:18,660
know as much as I do that new things
you're going to incorporate into like high

4014
01:49:18,661 --> 01:49:19,510
level cage fighting.

4015
01:49:19,511 --> 01:49:21,280
It takes a long time to really apply.

4016
01:49:21,281 --> 01:49:22,530
That's not climb on logs.

4017
01:49:22,531 --> 01:49:23,890
Maybe go to the gym and grapple.

4018
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:27,280
I had a ponytail

4019
01:49:28,830 --> 01:49:31,710
I'll look like just someone on the
underground said that some stealing their

4020
01:49:31,711 --> 01:49:32,100
line.

4021
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:33,390
They all looked like Jesus.

4022
01:49:33,391 --> 01:49:35,970
Why don't ponytails whoever
it is that did that.

4023
01:49:35,971 --> 01:49:37,080
A tweet me so I can,

4024
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:39,480
there you go.

4025
01:49:39,481 --> 01:49:40,440
What's your background Dan?

4026
01:49:40,570 --> 01:49:41,160
He went,

4027
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:41,641
Nah man.

4028
01:49:41,641 --> 01:49:43,580
I just like typed on rocks as a kid,

4029
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:44,720
climbed some trees.

4030
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:45,723
As soon as I heard

4031
01:49:47,230 --> 01:49:48,130
mom turn this shit

4032
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:48,963
off,

4033
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:50,283
why was,

4034
01:49:50,410 --> 01:49:53,260
I was confused still even
at the end like how the,

4035
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:55,180
how they sort of design their protocol.

4036
01:49:55,450 --> 01:49:56,031
I mean what,

4037
01:49:56,031 --> 01:49:56,650
what,

4038
01:49:56,650 --> 01:50:01,280
how he designs like what they're going
to do that day out of my first son.

4039
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,250
It was such bullshit,

4040
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:04,363
Connors,

4041
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:05,961
move on.

4042
01:50:05,961 --> 01:50:06,430
Do you want?

4043
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:06,760
Okay.

4044
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:10,090
For everyone else stayed the fucking
the gym and work on your sports.

4045
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,440
This if you haven't done it.

4046
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:13,780
I honestly belay man,

4047
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:14,800
unless you've done it,

4048
01:50:14,801 --> 01:50:15,730
you wouldn't have like,

4049
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:16,241
okay,

4050
01:50:16,241 --> 01:50:17,320
here's a perfect example.

4051
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:18,640
You're doing yoga now.

4052
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,490
Would you not fit?

4053
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,990
That shit was for housewives
before you ever did it.

4054
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:23,591
Nah Son.

4055
01:50:23,591 --> 01:50:24,424
I liked that shit.

4056
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:27,400
Go to yoga to be like,

4057
01:50:27,401 --> 01:50:27,731
listen,

4058
01:50:27,731 --> 01:50:28,980
I'm going to beat Andre or last night.

4059
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:29,950
Let me go get some hot.

4060
01:50:29,951 --> 01:50:30,401
Yo Listen,

4061
01:50:30,401 --> 01:50:33,520
I'm not talking about why you as an
experienced yoga person goes to yoga.

4062
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:35,890
I'm talking about your
prejudice against Yoga.

4063
01:50:35,891 --> 01:50:36,910
Before you ever did yoga,

4064
01:50:36,911 --> 01:50:37,630
what was it?

4065
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:38,290
I didn't happen.

4066
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:38,650
I did.

4067
01:50:38,650 --> 01:50:40,180
I'm open minded bull shit.

4068
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:40,661
I swear.

4069
01:50:40,661 --> 01:50:45,010
How dare you fucking green some aligned.

4070
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:47,400
Show us or show us your roots.

4071
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:49,573
You didn't

4072
01:50:52,150 --> 01:50:52,983
think

4073
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:56,193
it

4074
01:50:57,780 --> 01:50:59,950
turned out to be way easier,

4075
01:50:59,951 --> 01:51:00,784
way harder.

4076
01:51:01,850 --> 01:51:02,683
Well,

4077
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:04,270
you didn't think your
perception of it was there.

4078
01:51:04,271 --> 01:51:05,590
It was way easier than it actually was.

4079
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:06,560
Hey baby is way harder.

4080
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:07,091
Harder,

4081
01:51:07,091 --> 01:51:08,350
but in the middle of training camp,

4082
01:51:08,351 --> 01:51:08,920
I'm like,

4083
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:11,590
thank God for Mrs. Downs in this yoga.

4084
01:51:11,591 --> 01:51:12,670
Otherwise I wouldn't move.

4085
01:51:12,671 --> 01:51:13,240
Is good,

4086
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:14,710
but there's a lot of movement in training,

4087
01:51:14,711 --> 01:51:14,981
right?

4088
01:51:14,981 --> 01:51:15,814
I mean jabbing

4089
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:23,410
your chuck full of movements that don't
they have a lot of yoga movements and

4090
01:51:23,411 --> 01:51:23,770
movements.

4091
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:24,300
Yes.

4092
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:24,490
Yeah.

4093
01:51:24,490 --> 01:51:25,750
There's definitely a lot of movement,

4094
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:30,280
a lot of payrolls and you to see a degree
and he sees some sort of scientific,

4095
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:32,980
hold on a second there because
there's people that don't get degrees.

4096
01:51:32,981 --> 01:51:33,880
Like how about,

4097
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:38,770
how about the a a natural
that Hixon Gracie tributes
to a lot of its flexibility

4098
01:51:38,771 --> 01:51:41,530
and movement like before
these movement coaches.

4099
01:51:41,531 --> 01:51:41,711
Okay.

4100
01:51:41,711 --> 01:51:43,060
This is what people
that need to understand.

4101
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:47,560
Back in the fucking early
nineties Hickson was like a guy.

4102
01:51:47,561 --> 01:51:48,071
You didn't want it.

4103
01:51:48,071 --> 01:51:49,030
He was like candy man.

4104
01:51:49,070 --> 01:51:49,260
Yeah.

4105
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:50,800
He didn't want to say
his name three times.

4106
01:51:53,970 --> 01:51:54,750
It's true.

4107
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:55,210
He did.

4108
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:56,190
He was the motherfucker.

4109
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:57,910
Motherfuckers is heartbeat down,

4110
01:51:57,911 --> 01:51:58,511
all that stuff.

4111
01:51:58,511 --> 01:51:59,470
He was a Yogi.

4112
01:51:59,471 --> 01:52:01,890
He's a legit Yogi and gymnastic natural.

4113
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:03,770
Exactly.

4114
01:52:03,770 --> 01:52:04,540
It was both.

4115
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:05,020
He come,

4116
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:05,853
he applied,

4117
01:52:06,610 --> 01:52:08,690
he applied fire broth.

4118
01:52:10,510 --> 01:52:15,510
That's why he's alleging also
then he did 40 years of Jujitsu

4119
01:52:17,490 --> 01:52:20,170
it out from all the graces he stood out.

4120
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,033
Hixon Gracie.

4121
01:52:21,070 --> 01:52:22,630
All of them would cause he did the movie.

4122
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:25,510
This is backwards.

4123
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:26,923
That's

4124
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,020
a,

4125
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:31,420
maybe it's the maybe had
something to do with that.

4126
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:31,661
Yeah,

4127
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:33,640
but here what you're saying here too.

4128
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:34,420
Yes.

4129
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:34,841
It's not,

4130
01:52:34,841 --> 01:52:36,370
they're not mutually exclusive.

4131
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:40,480
Exclusive Hex and the reason why he was
the greatest ever it was because he was

4132
01:52:40,481 --> 01:52:41,380
the perfect storm.

4133
01:52:41,530 --> 01:52:42,940
He was the guy who was super smart.

4134
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:44,110
He was super tough.

4135
01:52:44,111 --> 01:52:44,680
He was a war.

4136
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:49,680
He had a warrior mentality and he was
intelligent enough to apply a bunch of

4137
01:52:50,151 --> 01:52:53,780
really unconventional training
modalities like some serious yoga,

4138
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:56,690
that fucking video of him on
the bars and Santa Monica,

4139
01:52:56,691 --> 01:52:58,520
but before he fought
in Japan Valley Tudos,

4140
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:00,260
he's doing balance beam shit.

4141
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:04,190
Go into a full split standing there
on his fucking bar on the beach.

4142
01:53:04,490 --> 01:53:05,500
He's doing all these real,

4143
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:06,531
this is,

4144
01:53:06,531 --> 01:53:08,300
I'm not saying the movement doesn't work.

4145
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:09,110
It was both.

4146
01:53:09,110 --> 01:53:10,580
It was I.

4147
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:14,380
Hell you say it doesn't help
that he's been doing anyway.

4148
01:53:14,970 --> 01:53:15,950
Positive Jim.

4149
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:21,010
I'm saying it was an MMA fighter in the
UFC on my list of priorities to become a

4150
01:53:22,011 --> 01:53:23,060
UFC champion.

4151
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:27,050
Hiring a movement coach who his background
is climbing on rocks and climbing

4152
01:53:27,051 --> 01:53:27,884
trees.

4153
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:29,120
I'm going to fuck it.

4154
01:53:30,730 --> 01:53:33,150
I can't say it about
this foretell guy he had.

4155
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:34,033
Now he's a god.

4156
01:53:34,230 --> 01:53:35,780
That diary don't diss
him cause I'll come out.

4157
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:39,180
Fuck you ain't gotta give you say
only know side kick the fuck out.

4158
01:53:39,190 --> 01:53:41,300
Don't know what his total
or one the core can do.

4159
01:53:41,301 --> 01:53:45,750
But I know he has the respect of Carlos
condit so he's got my respect and I

4160
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:47,630
enjoy talking to them and
I think he knows a lot.

4161
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:48,980
So I disagree with you on that.

4162
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:53,380
But I don't know if he can do
what that Edo Portel God can do.

4163
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,820
But we're talking about
mindset moves like,

4164
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:57,621
yeah,

4165
01:53:57,621 --> 01:53:57,921
I agree.

4166
01:53:57,921 --> 01:53:59,240
It seems like it's not real Joe.

4167
01:53:59,241 --> 01:54:02,270
All I'm saying is if you're going
to dedicate your time to something,

4168
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:04,070
I don't know if that's the way to go.

4169
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:04,880
Here's why.

4170
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:07,730
I'm not sure you're right
guys like Richard Martinez,

4171
01:54:07,731 --> 01:54:09,860
we brought this up before you.

4172
01:54:09,861 --> 01:54:14,540
He a a fantastic breakdancer and
the ability to manipulate his body,

4173
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:16,010
standing on one hand,

4174
01:54:16,011 --> 01:54:17,420
doing the fucking full lotus,

4175
01:54:17,421 --> 01:54:22,040
all the crazy shit that he could do
directly translated to him almost

4176
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:25,610
immediately being a bad mother
fucker in Jujitsu directly.

4177
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:27,170
Ridiculously.

4178
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:27,740
Um,

4179
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:28,940
and not just athletic,

4180
01:54:28,941 --> 01:54:32,690
but the dexterity of one
language informs the other

4181
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:34,521
man.

4182
01:54:34,521 --> 01:54:35,354
You're wrong.

4183
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:37,230
Jansen's movement wasn't wild,

4184
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,390
but this is movement.

4185
01:54:39,710 --> 01:54:40,940
This is why I'm saying you're wrong.

4186
01:54:41,060 --> 01:54:43,280
It's all good if it works.

4187
01:54:43,281 --> 01:54:44,780
And how sign up for salsa classes.

4188
01:54:45,890 --> 01:54:46,723
Dan,

4189
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:48,980
don't you remember what
football players were taking?

4190
01:54:48,990 --> 01:54:49,480
Balance?

4191
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:49,790
Yes,

4192
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:50,211
I did.

4193
01:54:50,211 --> 01:54:53,090
It did you sell side.

4194
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:56,030
But why did it take
ballet or something to do

4195
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:03,740
to get this ham hock and he's tied to

4196
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:06,201
check this out.

4197
01:55:06,201 --> 01:55:07,034
Ladies.

4198
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:08,750
Wear Yoga Pants.

4199
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:12,250
Shoes.

4200
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:15,590
Listen to [inaudible]
valley for two years.

4201
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:17,600
You gotta you have time
to do all these things.

4202
01:55:17,601 --> 01:55:18,311
They enter school.

4203
01:55:18,311 --> 01:55:19,970
Why are you not 90 theater schools?

4204
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:21,171
Shit,

4205
01:55:21,171 --> 01:55:22,340
you've done for five years.

4206
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:23,323
I lived in the woods.

4207
01:55:23,620 --> 01:55:24,453
Mushrooms.

4208
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:26,293
How

4209
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:29,000
big acting school.

4210
01:55:29,001 --> 01:55:31,010
You have to take ballet acting school.

4211
01:55:31,011 --> 01:55:32,970
You must take ballet
and you have to perform.

4212
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:34,311
Fuck you.

4213
01:55:34,311 --> 01:55:35,030
Okay.

4214
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:39,020
That's like going to painting school and
learning how to like play video games

4215
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:40,880
but not related and the tasting right now,

4216
01:55:40,881 --> 01:55:41,750
and I'm being dead serious.

4217
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:42,860
I was a beautiful dancer.

4218
01:55:43,190 --> 01:55:44,023
I'm barefoot

4219
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,860
ballet ballet's to do that video,

4220
01:55:46,861 --> 01:55:49,380
that video you did was
just hilarious of uh,

4221
01:55:49,890 --> 01:55:51,060
not unconventional dancer.

4222
01:55:51,061 --> 01:55:51,894
What was the name of it?

4223
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:52,590
Um,

4224
01:55:52,590 --> 01:55:55,340
what the fuck was that video that you
did that where I was at [inaudible]?

4225
01:55:55,370 --> 01:55:55,620
No,

4226
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:58,080
you had this crazy dance
video that you made.

4227
01:55:58,140 --> 01:55:58,771
I can't remember.

4228
01:55:58,771 --> 01:55:58,910
It.

4229
01:55:58,910 --> 01:55:59,410
Dammit.

4230
01:55:59,410 --> 01:56:00,061
It was hilarious.

4231
01:56:00,061 --> 01:56:00,480
She said,

4232
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:00,670
oh,

4233
01:56:00,670 --> 01:56:01,410
just did this thing.

4234
01:56:01,410 --> 01:56:02,210
Take a look at it.

4235
01:56:02,210 --> 01:56:05,430
And I remember I took it home with back
when people that actually had DVDs.

4236
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:05,870
Yes,

4237
01:56:05,870 --> 01:56:06,870
it is Brian Dancing.

4238
01:56:07,540 --> 01:56:09,180
It wasn't unconventional cancer.

4239
01:56:09,181 --> 01:56:10,980
It's not called word unconventional.

4240
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:13,830
Like in know fuck on Orthodox dancer.

4241
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:14,261
No,

4242
01:56:14,261 --> 01:56:14,431
no,

4243
01:56:14,431 --> 01:56:14,581
no,

4244
01:56:14,581 --> 01:56:14,731
no,

4245
01:56:14,731 --> 01:56:16,040
no inappropriate dances.

4246
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:18,240
I think it was great.

4247
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:19,510
It was a sketch that he,

4248
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:20,580
it was ridiculous.

4249
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:22,560
It was ridiculous as a guy just like,

4250
01:56:22,561 --> 01:56:24,150
it's okay to dance on a dance floor.

4251
01:56:24,151 --> 01:56:24,841
A great right.

4252
01:56:24,841 --> 01:56:25,340
We all agree.

4253
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:25,560
Give me,

4254
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:28,000
as long as you step into this
arena and you're on the heart,

4255
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:30,330
it's all to get ridiculous,

4256
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:32,970
but you can't do that shit when
you're waiting in line to rent a car.

4257
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:34,660
Brian said,

4258
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:35,493
sounds great.

4259
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:36,400
Thanks.

4260
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:37,060
I can't remember.

4261
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:37,500
Remember,

4262
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:41,170
I just remember there was
some inappropriate dancing
when I slapped the gambler.

4263
01:56:41,190 --> 01:56:44,550
I slap that Bob thing and I would
jump out and that sounds hilarious.

4264
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:45,810
I did all kinds of weird stuff like that.

4265
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:48,360
We were doing ballet and
then about two days into it,

4266
01:56:48,361 --> 01:56:51,690
so it was like we should
probably go catch him flip balls.

4267
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,111
Yeah,

4268
01:56:52,111 --> 01:56:52,944
no shit,

4269
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:54,413
no shit.

4270
01:56:55,130 --> 01:56:57,600
And that's where all this
movement dancing stuff.

4271
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:03,150
Why don't you think lunges are
essentially in a lot of ways,

4272
01:57:03,151 --> 01:57:06,210
especially dumbbell lunges are very
much a movement exercise cause it's all

4273
01:57:06,211 --> 01:57:08,730
about balance and rigidity and
keeping your core straight.

4274
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:09,210
They're like,

4275
01:57:09,210 --> 01:57:11,160
there's something about
like double Dumbbell lunges,

4276
01:57:11,310 --> 01:57:13,890
things along those lines
that they were you,

4277
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:17,810
they help you go balls
as it was no heavy stuff.

4278
01:57:17,811 --> 01:57:18,130
Like,

4279
01:57:18,130 --> 01:57:18,700
yeah,

4280
01:57:18,700 --> 01:57:22,320
like if you're going to apply like an
explosive movement to a martial art,

4281
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:24,000
there's no doubt about lifting weights.

4282
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:24,361
Helps.

4283
01:57:24,361 --> 01:57:24,750
Right?

4284
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:25,583
No doubt about it.

4285
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:26,371
No doubt about it.

4286
01:57:26,371 --> 01:57:27,270
Like lifting weights.

4287
01:57:27,271 --> 01:57:28,620
If there was no weight restrictions,

4288
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:31,190
you can do whatever you wanted and
lift as much weight as you want it.

4289
01:57:31,290 --> 01:57:35,340
There's a big difference from one 70 and
200 you mean there's a big difference.

4290
01:57:35,341 --> 01:57:38,400
You get like way stronger if
you get way more explosive,

4291
01:57:38,401 --> 01:57:38,940
you get,

4292
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:41,970
it's beneficial in a applied situation.

4293
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:42,580
Right?

4294
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:43,110
Agreed.

4295
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:43,943
That's movement.

4296
01:57:44,150 --> 01:57:44,740
Yeah.

4297
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:46,050
It's not much different.

4298
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:50,410
It's like you're talking about movement
with weights or movement with Moitai

4299
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:50,821
like people.

4300
01:57:50,821 --> 01:57:53,370
There's a lot of people that say
training boy ties helped a Jujitsu.

4301
01:57:53,550 --> 01:57:54,360
I believe it.

4302
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:55,290
It doesn't make sense,

4303
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:56,730
but just kind of shit.

4304
01:57:56,731 --> 01:57:59,010
You have to do all this motions
you have to do in Moy Tai.

4305
01:57:59,130 --> 01:58:00,150
That's movement too.

4306
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:02,590
I would also say timings with gymnastics.

4307
01:58:06,330 --> 01:58:06,931
What leads,

4308
01:58:06,931 --> 01:58:08,250
what leads one person,

4309
01:58:08,251 --> 01:58:12,840
like what with Hixon would lead him into
the other disciplines is that mindset

4310
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:16,200
that that comprehensive minded
mindset constantly get better.

4311
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:19,320
This foundation is so fucking good insane,

4312
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:22,740
but also he was a student of
the Great Japanese Samurai.

4313
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:23,340
Yes.

4314
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:24,270
Their philosophy.

4315
01:58:24,271 --> 01:58:27,960
So I'm sure he read the book of five
rings and one of the things about the book

4316
01:58:27,961 --> 01:58:31,500
of five rings in and emphasize was
like taking in all sorts of different,

4317
01:58:31,650 --> 01:58:32,461
be soft,

4318
01:58:32,461 --> 01:58:33,840
like taking calligraphy,

4319
01:58:33,841 --> 01:58:37,560
do painting because the flexible
and the reason for that,

4320
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:39,300
if you look at any great innovator,

4321
01:58:39,630 --> 01:58:41,160
they started with one discipline,

4322
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,760
they started with one
discipline and then they,

4323
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:44,650
when they studied other disciplines,

4324
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:48,500
they were able to appropriate those
disciplines and come up with a new style.

4325
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:51,910
They really will revolutionize a
new style by studying that style.

4326
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:54,430
You branch out a young Hixon might be,

4327
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:56,800
might be Alan Jobe in a young,

4328
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:57,390
oh yeah,

4329
01:58:57,390 --> 01:58:58,410
Hanson is shot.

4330
01:58:58,570 --> 01:58:59,403
Good shot.

4331
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:02,080
So he's from the long goal essentially.

4332
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:02,490
He's,

4333
01:59:02,490 --> 01:59:02,750
you know,

4334
01:59:02,750 --> 01:59:03,670
from South America

4335
01:59:07,250 --> 01:59:10,810
twist head plus to have a real problem.

4336
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:13,900
The real problem with that
Pussy Hickson was getting,

4337
01:59:14,290 --> 01:59:14,980
oh my God,

4338
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:15,731
please bring him up.

4339
01:59:15,731 --> 01:59:16,564
I like to look at his,

4340
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:17,970
he's getting supermodels.

4341
01:59:18,350 --> 01:59:18,820
Let's,

4342
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:19,570
let's look again.

4343
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:20,320
Let's like,

4344
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,940
let's not bring up specific instance.

4345
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:26,370
I think your a Jujitsu helps your
music and I think your music helps you

4346
01:59:26,371 --> 01:59:27,160
Jujitsu.

4347
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:28,930
And I think as your
Jujitsu has gotten better,

4348
01:59:28,931 --> 01:59:31,000
you music's gotten better and
as your music's gotten better,

4349
01:59:31,001 --> 01:59:31,540
your Jujitsu,

4350
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:31,800
Scott,

4351
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:33,380
I think it'd be a coach.

4352
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:34,460
I think they're all too,

4353
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:36,720
cause you'd be red hot too.

4354
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:41,860
When you get great at things like
especially like you specifically,

4355
01:59:41,861 --> 01:59:45,560
you're a guy who like one of the best
things about you creating 10th plaids

4356
01:59:45,570 --> 01:59:46,780
judges ever since I've known you,

4357
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:49,120
like if you have an idea in your mind,

4358
01:59:49,121 --> 01:59:52,600
like there's a point you have to get
to like okay there's a spot over there

4359
01:59:52,601 --> 01:59:53,050
you've got to get.

4360
01:59:53,050 --> 01:59:54,700
So you have this crazy tunnel vision.

4361
01:59:54,850 --> 01:59:57,760
Well you'll figure out unconventional
paths to get to a point.

4362
01:59:58,120 --> 01:59:58,611
Like you,

4363
01:59:58,611 --> 02:00:03,460
you can block out a lot of like external
shit that a lot of other people don't.

4364
02:00:03,530 --> 02:00:03,870
You know,

4365
02:00:03,870 --> 02:00:05,500
they can't block out the can't fat.

4366
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:08,470
They can't like tune in to the
finish line the way you can.

4367
02:00:08,710 --> 02:00:11,980
It's really interesting to see because
I think that applies to your music as

4368
02:00:11,981 --> 02:00:12,370
well.

4369
02:00:12,370 --> 02:00:14,290
I think it applies to everything you do.

4370
02:00:14,530 --> 02:00:16,720
And I think it comes for a lot of us.

4371
02:00:16,870 --> 02:00:19,810
I think it comes from like some fucked
up place where you didn't get enough when

4372
02:00:19,811 --> 02:00:22,320
you were a child and then
you detention or what?

4373
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:22,841
Anything.

4374
02:00:22,841 --> 02:00:23,291
Love,

4375
02:00:23,291 --> 02:00:24,124
attention,

4376
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:25,673
praise,

4377
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:26,540
[inaudible] ship,

4378
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:27,373
Camaraderie.

4379
02:00:27,730 --> 02:00:28,181
Also,

4380
02:00:28,181 --> 02:00:30,260
what's really important is like
I said this to him the other day,

4381
02:00:30,261 --> 02:00:30,640
I go,

4382
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:31,060
dude,

4383
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:31,241
you know,

4384
02:00:31,241 --> 02:00:31,511
he says,

4385
02:00:31,511 --> 02:00:32,344
don't spar.

4386
02:00:32,410 --> 02:00:35,740
You know why it's parked is it terrifies
me now I'm not good as far as you turn

4387
02:00:35,741 --> 02:00:36,860
this in to you and I was talking to,

4388
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:37,950
I'm trying to explain to him.

4389
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:38,300
No,

4390
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:38,440
no.

4391
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:39,820
What I'm saying is that you listen,

4392
02:00:39,821 --> 02:00:40,061
listen,

4393
02:00:40,061 --> 02:00:40,361
listen,

4394
02:00:40,361 --> 02:00:41,040
son of no,

4395
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:41,890
this is the point I'm making.

4396
02:00:41,891 --> 02:00:42,400
Listen,

4397
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:45,190
when you do something that you're
afraid of or that puts you on,

4398
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:46,450
makes you uncomfortable.

4399
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:48,160
I end up writing I think.

4400
02:00:48,161 --> 02:00:51,550
I think like when you do
another discipline that maybe
you're not even good at,

4401
02:00:51,551 --> 02:00:52,211
that scares you.

4402
02:00:52,211 --> 02:00:56,500
It'll open up channels in
your original discipline.

4403
02:00:56,530 --> 02:00:59,830
It will jumble your brain so you
come at things in a different way.

4404
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:02,620
If you stay comfortable in and stuff,

4405
02:01:02,950 --> 02:01:03,280
you're,

4406
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:04,111
you're most likely,

4407
02:01:04,111 --> 02:01:05,080
if you're going to create a field,

4408
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:08,350
it's harder to branch out
and become more creative.

4409
02:01:08,351 --> 02:01:11,470
If you do things you're not that
good at that maybe you're scared of.

4410
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:12,241
They churn that.

4411
02:01:12,241 --> 02:01:14,350
That caused you to stretch in other areas,

4412
02:01:14,351 --> 02:01:14,891
and this is the,

4413
02:01:14,891 --> 02:01:16,360
this is the argument for movement coaches.

4414
02:01:16,690 --> 02:01:18,100
When you do things you're not that good.

4415
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:19,510
I had to put you in an in your,

4416
02:01:19,590 --> 02:01:21,370
in your step out of your comfort zone.

4417
02:01:21,550 --> 02:01:23,290
You'll probably get
better at your original,

4418
02:01:23,291 --> 02:01:24,560
better be good at everything else.

4419
02:01:24,570 --> 02:01:25,640
We'll probably hire a movement coach.

4420
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:26,513
That's true.

4421
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:27,040
That's true.

4422
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:27,700
Being Open minded.

4423
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:32,020
I think four of us should get a timeshare
fucking gay where just four dudes.

4424
02:01:32,021 --> 02:01:32,854
I don't know.

4425
02:01:32,970 --> 02:01:33,803
Let's do it.

4426
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:36,263
Christ,

4427
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:38,980
this podcast every day.

4428
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:39,351
Listen,

4429
02:01:39,351 --> 02:01:41,390
after all of our checks
get sick about bullshit.

4430
02:01:41,391 --> 02:01:45,060
Let's just get a fat house in the
hills and the movement coach every day.

4431
02:01:45,310 --> 02:01:48,200
We have a big house with
four branches where you know,

4432
02:01:48,201 --> 02:01:49,790
we don't have to
necessarily hear each other.

4433
02:01:49,791 --> 02:01:50,930
We just meet in the kitchen.

4434
02:01:51,190 --> 02:01:52,023
You know what I'm saying?

4435
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:56,420
And just live like men don't live like
these bitches that we've become trapped

4436
02:01:56,421 --> 02:01:57,254
in this world.

4437
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:59,420
This world of this is
when we get to be free.

4438
02:01:59,570 --> 02:02:00,980
We could be free like this all the time.

4439
02:02:00,981 --> 02:02:01,814
Yeah.

4440
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:03,003
Oh,

4441
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:04,930
gives it at the end of Braveheart.

4442
02:02:05,490 --> 02:02:06,323
Oh,

4443
02:02:06,690 --> 02:02:06,810
that's

4444
02:02:06,810 --> 02:02:07,560
what I'm saying.

4445
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:07,860
Open.

4446
02:02:07,860 --> 02:02:09,440
Say Pew,

4447
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:09,440
Pew,

4448
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:10,273
Pew

4449
02:02:12,290 --> 02:02:17,240
with a broke foot whips and
the actual injury was p baby.

4450
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:18,130
I just a sprain.

4451
02:02:18,131 --> 02:02:18,890
He looks like the rocking.

4452
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:19,181
Okay.

4453
02:02:19,181 --> 02:02:19,291
Yeah,

4454
02:02:19,291 --> 02:02:19,951
it looks like he's walking.

4455
02:02:19,951 --> 02:02:20,191
Okay.

4456
02:02:20,191 --> 02:02:21,150
It's a tough line on this.

4457
02:02:21,151 --> 02:02:22,290
And Susan Silva,

4458
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:23,200
what do you think is,

4459
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:23,731
I forgot this.

4460
02:02:23,731 --> 02:02:24,550
Shaye Anderson.

4461
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:24,840
Um,

4462
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:27,840
it's a very good fight at this
time and both of their careers,

4463
02:02:27,841 --> 02:02:28,770
it becomes interesting,

4464
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:30,180
whereas like Anderson,

4465
02:02:30,181 --> 02:02:31,170
when he was dominating,

4466
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:31,861
when he was like,

4467
02:02:31,861 --> 02:02:33,380
like right after he smashed jail son in,

4468
02:02:33,390 --> 02:02:34,223
in the second fight,

4469
02:02:34,350 --> 02:02:35,080
you would think like,

4470
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:35,271
Whoa,

4471
02:02:35,271 --> 02:02:35,761
that's a,

4472
02:02:35,761 --> 02:02:37,430
that's a tough fight for Bisping.

4473
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:39,060
The Andersons just in the matrix.

4474
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:41,430
But Anderson comes off of,

4475
02:02:41,670 --> 02:02:41,941
you know,

4476
02:02:41,941 --> 02:02:46,080
like psychologically there's
two v brutal losses in a row.

4477
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:47,430
One a loss for sure.

4478
02:02:47,431 --> 02:02:48,780
What a catastrophic injury.

4479
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:50,470
Then he just fell off.

4480
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:50,881
Yeah.

4481
02:02:50,881 --> 02:02:52,110
And then he gets by Nick Diaz,

4482
02:02:52,111 --> 02:02:53,910
but he gets humiliated.

4483
02:02:54,210 --> 02:02:57,960
Like Nick Diaz lies on his back and puts
his hands on his head and mocks him.

4484
02:02:58,170 --> 02:02:59,010
He's talking to him.

4485
02:02:59,011 --> 02:03:00,090
He's calling him a bitch.

4486
02:03:00,570 --> 02:03:01,140
Dude.

4487
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:05,820
Nick Diaz was super respectful right up
until the moment they got in that cage.

4488
02:03:05,821 --> 02:03:07,530
And then he was Nick Diaz.

4489
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:07,970
Yes.

4490
02:03:07,970 --> 02:03:08,850
It was all gone.

4491
02:03:08,910 --> 02:03:09,743
He's never fucking,

4492
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:12,330
it's like that old fable about
the Scorpion and the frog.

4493
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:15,840
The frog wants to get across
the pond and the Scorpion says,

4494
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:18,060
or the Scorpion wants get across the frog,

4495
02:03:18,250 --> 02:03:19,230
the pond and the frog,

4496
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:19,540
uh,

4497
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:21,090
is in the water and his corporate says,

4498
02:03:21,091 --> 02:03:22,050
let me ride on your back.

4499
02:03:22,530 --> 02:03:22,961
And uh,

4500
02:03:22,961 --> 02:03:23,551
the frog says,

4501
02:03:23,551 --> 02:03:25,260
I won't do that if I do that,

4502
02:03:25,261 --> 02:03:26,130
you'll sting me.

4503
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:26,550
He goes,

4504
02:03:26,550 --> 02:03:26,731
well,

4505
02:03:26,731 --> 02:03:27,451
if I did that,

4506
02:03:27,451 --> 02:03:28,500
we would both die.

4507
02:03:28,530 --> 02:03:29,400
I'm not stupid.

4508
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:32,520
So the Scorpion rides on the frog's
back and halfway across the water,

4509
02:03:32,670 --> 02:03:35,400
he stings him and the
frogs like what the fuck?

4510
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:36,720
And the Scorpion is like,

4511
02:03:36,721 --> 02:03:37,201
sorry.

4512
02:03:37,201 --> 02:03:38,100
It's in my nature.

4513
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:38,610
Yeah.

4514
02:03:38,610 --> 02:03:39,031
Damn dog.

4515
02:03:39,031 --> 02:03:40,890
What kind of childhood stories
that you haven't heard?

4516
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:42,090
The famous story.

4517
02:03:42,091 --> 02:03:42,761
They also use it.

4518
02:03:42,761 --> 02:03:43,594
They'll use it.

4519
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:46,130
They'll see is in connection
with that 20 stings.

4520
02:03:46,131 --> 02:03:46,964
Him and a guy.

4521
02:03:48,220 --> 02:03:49,053
What's that?

4522
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:51,810
I don't know the score.

4523
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:52,470
That's a great,

4524
02:03:52,470 --> 02:03:53,310
that's a great allegory.

4525
02:03:53,340 --> 02:03:53,551
Well,

4526
02:03:53,551 --> 02:03:55,050
the Blue Red Riding Hood,

4527
02:03:55,460 --> 02:03:56,520
once upon a time

4528
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:01,540
that your children in the words and you
legitimately had to worry about them get

4529
02:04:01,541 --> 02:04:02,430
eaten by wolves.

4530
02:04:02,530 --> 02:04:03,310
Yeah.

4531
02:04:03,310 --> 02:04:05,570
Moral these motherfucking
and story is this.

4532
02:04:05,670 --> 02:04:06,730
It's vegans are retarded.

4533
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:07,320
That's,

4534
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:09,750
that's the story of these
motherfuckers [inaudible] everywhere

4535
02:04:11,370 --> 02:04:12,840
because stay the fuck out of the woods.

4536
02:04:12,841 --> 02:04:13,674
Stay out of the woods.

4537
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:14,310
The words,

4538
02:04:14,310 --> 02:04:15,330
there's a fucking wolf.

4539
02:04:16,390 --> 02:04:17,223
Yes.

4540
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,560
And then don't trust strangers actually.

4541
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:20,010
Yeah.

4542
02:04:20,010 --> 02:04:22,890
Well also number Numero
Uno mentally for sure,

4543
02:04:22,891 --> 02:04:25,800
because the person inside the house
and pretended to be his grandmother,

4544
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:29,850
but the reason why they were always wolves
where there's little red riding hood

4545
02:04:29,851 --> 02:04:30,601
of three little pigs.

4546
02:04:30,601 --> 02:04:31,530
It was always wolves.

4547
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:35,400
Wolves legitimately ate a lot of fucking
people and people seem to have forgot

4548
02:04:35,401 --> 02:04:35,821
about that.

4549
02:04:35,821 --> 02:04:37,080
Now we're all these assholes.

4550
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:38,640
We need to bring back the wolf.

4551
02:04:38,850 --> 02:04:42,770
We need to make sure the Walter
like wolves will kill everyone.

4552
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:43,613
You know,

4553
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:45,350
they don't eat a lot of,

4554
02:04:46,150 --> 02:04:47,660
they eat some of what they killed.

4555
02:04:48,050 --> 02:04:48,781
Oh my God,

4556
02:04:48,781 --> 02:04:53,700
wolves are so prey driven that they
will kill whole herds of elk and not eat

4557
02:04:53,701 --> 02:04:54,534
half the meat.

4558
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:58,890
I'll slap the fuck doing about German
German fairytales like Hansel and Gretel.

4559
02:04:59,070 --> 02:04:59,903
What happens?

4560
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:02,250
A lady and old lady takes
him and she's a witch.

4561
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:05,580
She puts them in a cage and
starts feeding them too.

4562
02:05:05,581 --> 02:05:06,120
What?

4563
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:10,920
Plump them up so she can eat them more
or less stories don't trust even old

4564
02:05:10,921 --> 02:05:11,580
ladies.

4565
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:12,360
Germans are like,

4566
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,193
you're a stranger.

4567
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:13,680
Sorry.

4568
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:14,130
Also,

4569
02:05:14,130 --> 02:05:17,190
let's be honest about
like a long time ago,

4570
02:05:17,310 --> 02:05:22,310
a thousand years ago in rural areas
where food was scarce and people had

4571
02:05:23,401 --> 02:05:25,410
suffered through a lifetime,

4572
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:30,500
you weren't going to survive the winter
and chaos and seeing murders and seeing

4573
02:05:30,631 --> 02:05:32,760
assault and rape and constant,

4574
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:34,530
just the programming of person.

4575
02:05:34,650 --> 02:05:36,360
How much cannibalism
was going on back then?

4576
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:38,260
A lot according to Steven Rinella,

4577
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:39,240
like in this country.

4578
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:40,103
I mean Steve,

4579
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:43,290
we were talking about the other day
with the native Americans and Nez Perce.

4580
02:05:43,390 --> 02:05:46,770
Steve or Noah has the best
native American stories.

4581
02:05:46,771 --> 02:05:47,041
He's like,

4582
02:05:47,041 --> 02:05:47,460
he does,

4583
02:05:47,460 --> 02:05:49,380
he's a legit scholar almost.

4584
02:05:49,381 --> 02:05:49,561
I mean,

4585
02:05:49,561 --> 02:05:50,790
I don't think he would call himself that,

4586
02:05:50,791 --> 02:05:55,791
but he's incredibly knowledgeable on
American history and like what the Nez

4587
02:05:55,801 --> 02:05:56,910
Perce Indians did in the,

4588
02:05:56,911 --> 02:05:57,181
in the,

4589
02:05:57,181 --> 02:05:58,014
in the,

4590
02:05:58,370 --> 02:05:59,550
like the Great Lakes area.

4591
02:05:59,580 --> 02:06:01,140
They would eat a lot of cannibalism,

4592
02:06:01,141 --> 02:06:01,310
man,

4593
02:06:01,310 --> 02:06:02,820
a lot and filed the teeth down.

4594
02:06:02,910 --> 02:06:03,780
That was a crazy guy,

4595
02:06:03,781 --> 02:06:04,620
right in the history

4596
02:06:06,270 --> 02:06:07,530
of the missionaries.

4597
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:09,960
There's a lot of documented evidence.

4598
02:06:09,961 --> 02:06:10,890
What that all was like,

4599
02:06:10,891 --> 02:06:11,011
yeah,

4600
02:06:11,011 --> 02:06:12,180
we got this from an Indian.

4601
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:13,260
They were cannibals.

4602
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:16,180
We have to kill them all because
there are cannibals won't,

4603
02:06:16,620 --> 02:06:17,860
by the way,

4604
02:06:17,950 --> 02:06:19,110
any problem might be honest.

4605
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:19,960
Sometimes stories.

4606
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:21,270
The ETJ they're going to eat.

4607
02:06:21,940 --> 02:06:22,531
We love that.

4608
02:06:22,531 --> 02:06:23,650
All the native Americans,

4609
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:24,713
the hippies,

4610
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:25,680
they were human beings.

4611
02:06:25,681 --> 02:06:26,514
Just like all of us.

4612
02:06:26,830 --> 02:06:29,340
Like all of us weren't any more noble.

4613
02:06:29,510 --> 02:06:31,350
They were no more noble than anybody else.

4614
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:33,000
They were good people and bad people.

4615
02:06:33,001 --> 02:06:34,170
They were just as violent as,

4616
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:34,591
hey,

4617
02:06:34,591 --> 02:06:36,150
the most violent people arguably could be,

4618
02:06:36,151 --> 02:06:36,990
could be white people.

4619
02:06:36,991 --> 02:06:37,920
Like what the Germans did.

4620
02:06:38,210 --> 02:06:38,491
It didn't.

4621
02:06:38,491 --> 02:06:39,031
White people,

4622
02:06:39,031 --> 02:06:39,390
man.

4623
02:06:39,390 --> 02:06:39,541
Well,

4624
02:06:39,541 --> 02:06:42,800
I think also like when you're dealing
with people in the Great Lake States,

4625
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:44,900
the lights and fucking wipe it.

4626
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:46,590
That's a horrific knockout mice,

4627
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:48,900
the Roy Nelson Minataro knockout.

4628
02:06:49,140 --> 02:06:49,800
But um,

4629
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:52,170
you know those people
were living in a horrible,

4630
02:06:52,171 --> 02:06:53,840
horrible climate like the,

4631
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:58,380
the Great Lakes before the invention
of heat and it must have been so fun.

4632
02:06:58,420 --> 02:06:59,253
Yeah.

4633
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:00,270
Yeah.

4634
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:02,190
I mean people got desperado like,

4635
02:07:02,390 --> 02:07:02,580
you know,

4636
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:04,380
we know about the Donner
Party in Colorado.

4637
02:07:04,381 --> 02:07:05,340
They get trapped in the mountains.

4638
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:06,210
They had to eat each other.

4639
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:08,520
That shit probably happened all the time.

4640
02:07:08,521 --> 02:07:09,354
And the Great Lakes,

4641
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:10,560
they just didn't talk about it.

4642
02:07:10,561 --> 02:07:13,020
You're talking about
15 below zero recently,

4643
02:07:13,230 --> 02:07:13,471
right?

4644
02:07:13,471 --> 02:07:14,880
I wonder what part you eat first.

4645
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:17,100
The legs just go right to the asshole.

4646
02:07:17,150 --> 02:07:18,810
That's the worst part first for you.

4647
02:07:18,811 --> 02:07:19,644
I take the chest,

4648
02:07:19,730 --> 02:07:20,431
I hit your chest.

4649
02:07:20,431 --> 02:07:21,210
Say Listen,

4650
02:07:21,210 --> 02:07:22,990
worst case scenario
meeting someone's asshole.

4651
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:24,900
I'm a scoop it out with a sharp,

4652
02:07:24,901 --> 02:07:25,800
that's the last thing.

4653
02:07:25,801 --> 02:07:27,330
You Ain't a file a spoon with a,

4654
02:07:27,331 --> 02:07:27,990
with a fucking,

4655
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:29,220
I'm not even going to pass on the shit.

4656
02:07:29,221 --> 02:07:31,100
You don't even want to like the
shit you have to hold on to,

4657
02:07:31,210 --> 02:07:31,550
you know,

4658
02:07:31,550 --> 02:07:32,550
I need to eat their shit.

4659
02:07:32,670 --> 02:07:33,810
I would eat their bowls in there.

4660
02:07:33,811 --> 02:07:34,200
Dick.

4661
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:34,481
You know,

4662
02:07:34,481 --> 02:07:37,480
why take first testosterone?

4663
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:40,480
Because that's what the raccoons
and the squirrels go after first.

4664
02:07:40,481 --> 02:07:41,314
There's a reason.

4665
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:42,333
Think about that.

4666
02:07:43,570 --> 02:07:44,403
Now the ball,

4667
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:47,170
that's how wolves
determine who's the alpha.

4668
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:48,520
The alpha gets to eat the liver.

4669
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:50,140
That's why there was a,

4670
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:50,501
yeah,

4671
02:07:50,501 --> 02:07:51,410
there was a guy who did a,

4672
02:07:51,411 --> 02:07:52,330
a a whole,

4673
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:53,020
um,

4674
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:53,531
this whole,

4675
02:07:53,531 --> 02:07:57,800
like he's a documentary where
he lived with wolves and he,

4676
02:07:57,801 --> 02:08:00,190
he lived amongst them
and he had to fake it.

4677
02:08:00,191 --> 02:08:00,820
Kill.

4678
02:08:00,820 --> 02:08:04,270
He would have a kill there and he would
pack a liver inside of it and he would

4679
02:08:04,271 --> 02:08:05,104
pull the liver out.

4680
02:08:05,230 --> 02:08:08,020
He didn't in front of them and he had to
eat it in front of them and then we let

4681
02:08:08,021 --> 02:08:08,430
them eat.

4682
02:08:08,430 --> 02:08:09,263
But he's like,

4683
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:09,861
no,

4684
02:08:09,861 --> 02:08:09,981
no,

4685
02:08:09,981 --> 02:08:10,131
no,

4686
02:08:10,131 --> 02:08:10,391
no.

4687
02:08:10,391 --> 02:08:11,224
This fucking van.

4688
02:08:11,860 --> 02:08:12,730
It's terrifying.

4689
02:08:12,750 --> 02:08:12,890
Yeah,

4690
02:08:12,890 --> 02:08:13,651
it's fucking terrifying.

4691
02:08:13,651 --> 02:08:14,710
Cause then here's,

4692
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:15,491
here's the thing,

4693
02:08:15,491 --> 02:08:16,120
what happened?

4694
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:19,550
He had a farm nearby that was
having problems with wolves and he,

4695
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:20,770
this guy was a wolf scientist.

4696
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:22,330
And so he would uh,

4697
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:26,320
go there with these big gigantic
speakers that play wolf sounds.

4698
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:30,610
Cause he had a scare off this one pack
of wolves with a new pack of wolves that

4699
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:32,350
invade us instead of make it,

4700
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:33,880
he had to make it scary enough.

4701
02:08:33,881 --> 02:08:34,750
So these worlds backed off.

4702
02:08:34,751 --> 02:08:35,470
It's all on video.

4703
02:08:35,470 --> 02:08:37,030
The scary thing is when the Alpha,

4704
02:08:37,031 --> 02:08:37,631
when there's a thing,

4705
02:08:37,631 --> 02:08:38,464
he came back,

4706
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:40,770
the guy came back after a month and the,

4707
02:08:40,870 --> 02:08:44,830
there was a new wolf had taken over
and so the new wolf wanted to kill him.

4708
02:08:45,070 --> 02:08:45,970
So he had a whimper.

4709
02:08:45,980 --> 02:08:47,650
She had a whimper in front of this wall.

4710
02:08:48,050 --> 02:08:50,400
So he was recognized as the,

4711
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:53,110
the old alpha and to avoid being killed,

4712
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,190
which is standard.

4713
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:55,353
It's normal.

4714
02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:58,210
Like a wolf would challenge and they
would fight to the death and the new alpha

4715
02:08:58,211 --> 02:09:00,010
would kill the or try
to kill the old alpha.

4716
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:03,360
He came back close to die
because he was in his face growl.

4717
02:09:04,090 --> 02:09:07,110
Human involved in all that fucking shit.

4718
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:08,873
The off the wall.

4719
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:11,020
Oh yeah.

4720
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:11,291
Oh yeah.

4721
02:09:11,291 --> 02:09:12,280
There's a whole documentary on it.

4722
02:09:12,430 --> 02:09:13,570
It's called living with wolves.

4723
02:09:13,571 --> 02:09:14,404
I think.

4724
02:09:14,550 --> 02:09:15,400
Here's the thing about it,

4725
02:09:15,401 --> 02:09:15,850
man,

4726
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:18,010
they don't understand
that he's an unusual,

4727
02:09:18,011 --> 02:09:19,240
because they'd been with him since he was,

4728
02:09:19,330 --> 02:09:20,163
they were a baby.

4729
02:09:20,290 --> 02:09:20,891
See the whole,

4730
02:09:20,891 --> 02:09:22,090
I go the way that works.

4731
02:09:22,091 --> 02:09:23,110
He didn't just walk in.

4732
02:09:23,140 --> 02:09:27,670
It's a gigantic wildlife preserve and
this guy lives in the wildlife preserve

4733
02:09:28,090 --> 02:09:28,923
these Wolfe's.

4734
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:29,321
Yes.

4735
02:09:29,321 --> 02:09:30,910
He knows for their whole life.

4736
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:33,100
So they've been with him since he was,

4737
02:09:33,101 --> 02:09:33,520
you know,

4738
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:34,810
like four or five years ago.

4739
02:09:34,811 --> 02:09:36,100
But they're fucking grown.

4740
02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:37,810
Dangerous has wolves now.

4741
02:09:37,950 --> 02:09:38,620
Shit.

4742
02:09:38,620 --> 02:09:40,240
It's amazing.

4743
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:42,110
You have to find it.

4744
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:43,690
Jamie isn't home living with wolves.

4745
02:09:43,870 --> 02:09:44,330
I've met.

4746
02:09:44,330 --> 02:09:45,550
It's probably on that.

4747
02:09:45,551 --> 02:09:46,990
I watched him with wolves.

4748
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:49,520
I think I rushed it.

4749
02:09:50,020 --> 02:09:51,070
Some guy came in and said,

4750
02:09:51,071 --> 02:09:51,581
check this out.

4751
02:09:51,581 --> 02:09:52,081
I'm on a fixed,

4752
02:09:52,081 --> 02:09:53,480
his wolf problem.

4753
02:09:55,890 --> 02:09:59,020
Opry mentioned to me some dude who
was living with the grizzly bears.

4754
02:09:59,290 --> 02:09:59,591
Oh yeah.

4755
02:09:59,591 --> 02:10:00,161
That's crazy,

4756
02:10:00,161 --> 02:10:00,610
man.

4757
02:10:00,610 --> 02:10:01,340
He died,

4758
02:10:01,340 --> 02:10:02,570
got fucked up by the bears.

4759
02:10:02,571 --> 02:10:03,404
So they ate them.

4760
02:10:04,150 --> 02:10:05,080
One of the best,

4761
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:06,420
uh,

4762
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:06,660
like,

4763
02:10:06,660 --> 02:10:07,450
uh,

4764
02:10:07,450 --> 02:10:08,590
what am I confusing?

4765
02:10:09,390 --> 02:10:10,220
Grizzly man.

4766
02:10:10,220 --> 02:10:11,680
Best best documentaries ever.

4767
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:13,240
It's a Werner Herzog documentary,

4768
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:14,320
unintentional.

4769
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:15,550
Coming up talking about that guy.

4770
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:17,410
Oh,

4771
02:10:17,410 --> 02:10:18,730
there's another guy that lives it bears.

4772
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:19,410
Yeah,

4773
02:10:19,410 --> 02:10:19,880
man.

4774
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:23,480
He was like the real aggressive today and
then the thing he ate his asshole that

4775
02:10:23,490 --> 02:10:24,190
like the next day.

4776
02:10:24,190 --> 02:10:26,800
Well there was one bear
that they used on a movie.

4777
02:10:26,830 --> 02:10:28,000
They used the like some football.

4778
02:10:28,001 --> 02:10:29,090
I'm talking about bark the Brit.

4779
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:29,770
Yeah,

4780
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:31,560
that guy on 12th legs.

4781
02:10:31,660 --> 02:10:31,871
Yeah.

4782
02:10:31,871 --> 02:10:32,850
No shit reason.

4783
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:33,920
No Shit.

4784
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:37,040
The guy was just standing there doing
like they were doing some sort of drill

4785
02:10:37,041 --> 02:10:39,950
together and the bear just decided
terrorists throw to pull it off.

4786
02:10:39,951 --> 02:10:41,720
Course Beers are going to bear shit.

4787
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:43,850
I of course agree with you.

4788
02:10:43,950 --> 02:10:44,870
What did you think was,

4789
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:45,980
so I talked to a trainer.

4790
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:48,200
I talked to this training with Perez.

4791
02:10:48,201 --> 02:10:48,441
He said,

4792
02:10:48,441 --> 02:10:49,060
well,

4793
02:10:49,060 --> 02:10:51,530
bears a worn yet about three
minutes before they're,

4794
02:10:51,531 --> 02:10:52,430
if they're having a bad day,

4795
02:10:52,431 --> 02:10:53,151
you got to step up and go.

4796
02:10:53,151 --> 02:10:53,560
What do they do?

4797
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:53,961
They good day.

4798
02:10:53,961 --> 02:10:54,230
He goes,

4799
02:10:54,230 --> 02:10:56,490
they start clicking their
jaw Wunderbar starts winning.

4800
02:10:56,510 --> 02:10:57,810
Grizzlies starts clicking his jaws time.

4801
02:10:57,811 --> 02:10:58,644
If you just stop training,

4802
02:10:59,460 --> 02:10:59,680
alright.

4803
02:10:59,680 --> 02:11:01,190
And he's trans big cats.

4804
02:11:01,970 --> 02:11:03,050
They will warn you.

4805
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:03,913
What is this?

4806
02:11:05,330 --> 02:11:06,350
Is this the same guy?

4807
02:11:06,380 --> 02:11:06,621
Dude?

4808
02:11:06,621 --> 02:11:07,401
Those are wild.

4809
02:11:07,401 --> 02:11:09,260
None on this isn't the same Guy Jamie.

4810
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:09,651
Now,

4811
02:11:09,651 --> 02:11:10,820
this isn't the scientists.

4812
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:12,320
The scientists was a younger guy.

4813
02:11:12,350 --> 02:11:12,441
Well,

4814
02:11:12,441 --> 02:11:13,490
this is another guy.

4815
02:11:13,491 --> 02:11:14,324
Just does the same.

4816
02:11:14,930 --> 02:11:15,261
Yeah.

4817
02:11:15,261 --> 02:11:17,630
I think that guys living with wild wolves,

4818
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:19,150
that guys,

4819
02:11:19,150 --> 02:11:19,370
yeah,

4820
02:11:19,370 --> 02:11:20,203
Werner Herzog,

4821
02:11:20,210 --> 02:11:20,920
Werner Herzog.

4822
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:22,040
It's like chills with them.

4823
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:22,611
No,

4824
02:11:22,611 --> 02:11:22,881
it's not.

4825
02:11:22,881 --> 02:11:23,361
Werner Herzog,

4826
02:11:23,361 --> 02:11:24,194
Werner Herzog's grids,

4827
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:24,741
grizzly man,

4828
02:11:24,741 --> 02:11:27,260
this guy's name is Werner
fruit or something like that.

4829
02:11:27,310 --> 02:11:27,680
Um,

4830
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:29,600
it was a different guy and uh,

4831
02:11:29,660 --> 02:11:32,750
it was a really pretty positive.

4832
02:11:32,751 --> 02:11:33,740
It was a younger guy.

4833
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:34,251
Oh Shit.

4834
02:11:34,251 --> 02:11:35,420
I'm going to get all into this now,

4835
02:11:35,421 --> 02:11:35,810
man.

4836
02:11:35,810 --> 02:11:36,620
It's amazing.

4837
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:37,453
It's amazing.

4838
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:37,821
You know what?

4839
02:11:37,821 --> 02:11:37,950
I,

4840
02:11:37,950 --> 02:11:40,370
they have a really
sophisticated social system.

4841
02:11:41,810 --> 02:11:42,440
I don't know why.

4842
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:44,110
You know what I paid her into lately?

4843
02:11:44,150 --> 02:11:44,983
Big Time.

4844
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:46,573
Like I said.

4845
02:11:46,850 --> 02:11:47,061
Yeah,

4846
02:11:47,061 --> 02:11:47,540
they do.

4847
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:47,781
Anyway,

4848
02:11:47,781 --> 02:11:49,450
keep calling quite by

4849
02:11:51,110 --> 02:11:52,220
making a murderer and all that.

4850
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:54,500
I still haven't seen it yet.

4851
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:55,573
I'm a rebel bro.

4852
02:11:57,260 --> 02:11:57,951
Shit's me.

4853
02:11:57,951 --> 02:12:00,620
I'll fucking walk wolves and bears balls.

4854
02:12:00,621 --> 02:12:02,660
Deep Harden with that man.

4855
02:12:02,661 --> 02:12:04,400
I'm obsessed with wildlife.

4856
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:06,470
Absolutely fucking obsessed.

4857
02:12:06,830 --> 02:12:07,551
I'm obsessed.

4858
02:12:07,551 --> 02:12:12,551
I'm obsessed with rolling Netflix
documentary about the India and the Ganges

4859
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:12,860
River.

4860
02:12:12,860 --> 02:12:13,130
No,

4861
02:12:13,130 --> 02:12:13,790
what's it called,

4862
02:12:13,790 --> 02:12:14,091
dude?

4863
02:12:14,091 --> 02:12:15,440
It's called like wild and India,

4864
02:12:15,441 --> 02:12:16,340
but it's on Netflix.

4865
02:12:16,341 --> 02:12:18,620
Wild Ganges River.

4866
02:12:18,670 --> 02:12:20,420
Why was insane.

4867
02:12:20,421 --> 02:12:21,140
Very dirty.

4868
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:22,190
It comes from no,

4869
02:12:22,370 --> 02:12:23,000
listen,

4870
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:23,760
it's not that they're,

4871
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:27,860
this is the crazy part about it is all
that that river comes from the Himalayas,

4872
02:12:27,861 --> 02:12:31,850
all the ice and the glaciers or something
like that on Netflix about India,

4873
02:12:31,970 --> 02:12:33,950
but the part about the Ganges River,

4874
02:12:33,951 --> 02:12:35,570
it's a magical fucking river.

4875
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:37,040
They sh they put debt,

4876
02:12:37,041 --> 02:12:38,580
they burn dead bodies in there.

4877
02:12:38,780 --> 02:12:39,920
They throw trash,

4878
02:12:40,010 --> 02:12:40,843
sewage,

4879
02:12:40,940 --> 02:12:41,600
everything.

4880
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,920
But there's something they did.

4881
02:12:43,070 --> 02:12:44,510
It's called the wildest.

4882
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:45,290
Wildest.

4883
02:12:45,290 --> 02:12:45,850
Yes.

4884
02:12:45,850 --> 02:12:46,310
Yes.

4885
02:12:46,310 --> 02:12:47,630
There's something about that.

4886
02:12:47,631 --> 02:12:49,280
Water has so much mineral,

4887
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:52,400
it's a composition that it,

4888
02:12:52,510 --> 02:12:54,690
it's like an antibacterial water.

4889
02:12:54,691 --> 02:12:57,650
It kills all the bacteria
and the pathogens.

4890
02:12:57,651 --> 02:12:58,100
They've,

4891
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:01,250
according to this documentary that
could be full of shit on Netflix.

4892
02:13:01,251 --> 02:13:01,620
It's print.

4893
02:13:01,620 --> 02:13:03,920
They're saying that it's so,

4894
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:06,140
there's so much sewage goes into there,

4895
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:08,150
but it cleanses itself.

4896
02:13:08,210 --> 02:13:09,260
You can still drink it.

4897
02:13:09,261 --> 02:13:10,071
You can be down in the river.

4898
02:13:10,071 --> 02:13:10,910
People still drink,

4899
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:13,910
cause my friend was a jumped in
and had an earache for two years.

4900
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:15,793
Okay.

4901
02:13:18,220 --> 02:13:21,770
[inaudible] white crime.

4902
02:13:21,771 --> 02:13:22,604
Right.

4903
02:13:23,250 --> 02:13:25,570
A bit about the sooner
bands going to be fast.

4904
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:26,800
It sounded bands is no joke.

4905
02:13:26,801 --> 02:13:27,460
I remember that.

4906
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:29,260
I used to have Eddie
about the guy who's the,

4907
02:13:29,270 --> 02:13:30,250
they got killed in a boat.

4908
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:31,201
There was a boat.

4909
02:13:31,201 --> 02:13:32,670
There was food diet with the Tigers.

4910
02:13:32,730 --> 02:13:32,911
Yeah.

4911
02:13:32,911 --> 02:13:36,720
They swam out to the boat and killed
these guys individually one by one and

4912
02:13:36,721 --> 02:13:37,830
dragged him back to the shore.

4913
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:39,600
The tiger swam out to the boat.

4914
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:42,720
I remember that you told me that this
documentary we talked about that they

4915
02:13:42,721 --> 02:13:43,554
couldn't.

4916
02:13:44,580 --> 02:13:48,420
That's the only spot on the world
and where tigers actively hunt human.

4917
02:13:48,450 --> 02:13:50,080
They love the taste of humans.

4918
02:13:50,090 --> 02:13:51,620
Slobber off while they say,

4919
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:52,473
is that apple?

4920
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:54,660
Had you ever go to India?

4921
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:54,961
Oh,

4922
02:13:54,961 --> 02:13:55,560
I ain't gone,

4923
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:57,630
but they got great documentaries about it.

4924
02:13:57,660 --> 02:13:57,811
Yeah,

4925
02:13:57,811 --> 02:13:58,440
I'll watch that show.

4926
02:13:58,440 --> 02:14:03,320
They've killed literally hundreds of
thousands of people over the last hundred

4927
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:04,153
years.

4928
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:05,310
Over the last hundred years.

4929
02:14:05,311 --> 02:14:05,940
Tigers.

4930
02:14:05,940 --> 02:14:06,090
Yeah.

4931
02:14:06,090 --> 02:14:06,751
They have some,

4932
02:14:06,751 --> 02:14:07,740
some nutty number.

4933
02:14:07,741 --> 02:14:10,110
Let's not the best way to
go over the last 200 years.

4934
02:14:10,111 --> 02:14:14,190
I think the number's like 300,000 I
quoted the number like honestly and

4935
02:14:14,191 --> 02:14:16,840
realistically in my comedy
special that was talking,

4936
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:18,120
talking monkey's in space.

4937
02:14:18,660 --> 02:14:23,660
They fucking killed the killed this guy
dragged him to shore and then jump back

4938
02:14:24,091 --> 02:14:25,260
in the water killed another guy,

4939
02:14:25,261 --> 02:14:25,920
dragged them in,

4940
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:26,281
short,

4941
02:14:26,281 --> 02:14:27,061
jumped back in the water,

4942
02:14:27,061 --> 02:14:28,200
killed another guy,

4943
02:14:28,340 --> 02:14:29,173
the frown.

4944
02:14:29,530 --> 02:14:30,750
They couldn't swim away.

4945
02:14:31,170 --> 02:14:32,460
These things are so fast,

4946
02:14:32,461 --> 02:14:35,810
they can swim faster than five guys
can row a boat at full speeds there

4947
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:36,120
anything.

4948
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:36,953
He's a great book.

4949
02:14:37,140 --> 02:14:38,520
Great book called the managers have,

4950
02:14:38,521 --> 02:14:39,061
come on,

4951
02:14:39,061 --> 02:14:39,894
read the medics,

4952
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:43,160
tie Jason,

4953
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:43,260
Jason,

4954
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:43,561
dude,

4955
02:14:43,561 --> 02:14:44,490
the crocodiles.

4956
02:14:44,491 --> 02:14:45,211
Don't fuck with them.

4957
02:14:45,211 --> 02:14:48,810
Crocodiles and fuck with Rochelle to run
it from Roy Nelson like he was a tiger.

4958
02:14:48,811 --> 02:14:49,020
Right?

4959
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:49,261
Well,

4960
02:14:49,261 --> 02:14:50,990
Roy Nelson is a dangerous dude.

4961
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:54,270
Nelson throws fucking hammers.

4962
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:56,610
You want to talk about a guy who
was always been known as a Jujitsu?

4963
02:14:56,640 --> 02:14:58,560
He thought it was fucking fired.

4964
02:14:58,740 --> 02:15:01,860
Eddie and I knew Roy Nelson back
when he was just big country.

4965
02:15:01,890 --> 02:15:04,200
Everybody called him big
country and he's a Jujitsu guy.

4966
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:11,020
Oh that fucking haymaker
the mark layman days.

4967
02:15:11,021 --> 02:15:11,854
Yeah.

4968
02:15:12,510 --> 02:15:15,550
Are these guys are going to
get a Versace had contract.

4969
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:17,360
He should.

4970
02:15:17,360 --> 02:15:17,750
Well,

4971
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:19,720
if Versace was fucking smart,

4972
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:22,630
I they would try to get it on
their chubby man dollars for real.

4973
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:23,473
Is that Denmark?

4974
02:15:23,630 --> 02:15:23,870
Why?

4975
02:15:23,870 --> 02:15:24,190
Why?

4976
02:15:24,190 --> 02:15:25,630
Why does everybody have to be beautiful?

4977
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:28,810
Roy Nelson in a fucking fat
suit with a cigar in his hand,

4978
02:15:28,820 --> 02:15:30,310
sick and this man haters.

4979
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:34,150
What's on my arm hanging out
this and people love that guy.

4980
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:39,180
I really believe absolutely 100% that
he's like under marketed by a lot of

4981
02:15:39,311 --> 02:15:40,030
companies.

4982
02:15:40,030 --> 02:15:41,620
Like companies should scoop that guy up.

4983
02:15:41,650 --> 02:15:42,910
Schlitz Schlitz

4984
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:45,431
malt liquor.

4985
02:15:45,431 --> 02:15:47,320
She not even as a joke like that,

4986
02:15:47,350 --> 02:15:49,210
but just like he's a man.

4987
02:15:49,270 --> 02:15:49,700
First of all,

4988
02:15:49,700 --> 02:15:50,501
fucking man.

4989
02:15:50,501 --> 02:15:54,130
He has the most knockout bonuses
in UFC history for heavyweight.

4990
02:15:54,310 --> 02:15:54,760
Yeah.

4991
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:56,350
He's a fucking man.

4992
02:15:56,650 --> 02:15:57,490
It's in the animal.

4993
02:15:57,880 --> 02:15:58,361
It's an animal.

4994
02:15:58,361 --> 02:15:58,921
We get real shot.

4995
02:15:58,921 --> 02:16:00,550
He has a grown man running from him.

4996
02:16:00,730 --> 02:16:01,450
Yeah,

4997
02:16:01,450 --> 02:16:04,450
I mean this motherfucker throws hammers.

4998
02:16:04,990 --> 02:16:08,050
Do you remember when he knocked
out Mitre on Jesus Christ?

4999
02:16:08,470 --> 02:16:09,480
Dude cameras.

5000
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:13,780
He knocked out Nogueira like
he was a fucking paper cutout.

5001
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:15,580
Is he the hardest guy that's ever hit you?

5002
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:18,093
Yes.

5003
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:20,210
Jesus Christ.

5004
02:16:20,210 --> 02:16:20,860
He was hot.

5005
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:21,350
Damn.

5006
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:23,230
Like Rochelle Rochelle,

5007
02:16:23,260 --> 02:16:24,310
Rochelle can take it.

5008
02:16:24,340 --> 02:16:24,641
He's like,

5009
02:16:24,641 --> 02:16:25,480
fuck you bitch.

5010
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:26,850
Rochelle was about to get knocked down.

5011
02:16:26,860 --> 02:16:29,050
The grow shock isn't wrestler.

5012
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:29,810
Yeah.

5013
02:16:29,810 --> 02:16:30,100
Was One

5014
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:30,620
mistake.

5015
02:16:30,620 --> 02:16:30,940
Okay.

5016
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:31,773
National Champ,

5017
02:16:32,470 --> 02:16:33,850
heavyweight heavyweight match jam.

5018
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:35,500
It's similar as sumo wrestling.

5019
02:16:37,300 --> 02:16:38,770
He can be shitty about it.

5020
02:16:39,010 --> 02:16:40,770
It really is really,

5021
02:16:40,780 --> 02:16:43,890
really until Brock Lesnar's
in your division brought,

5022
02:16:43,960 --> 02:16:46,250
that was 20 years ago now,

5023
02:16:46,300 --> 02:16:47,250
but the whites that,

5024
02:16:47,310 --> 02:16:50,470
what's the difference between now and
then like a Brock Lesnar was around today.

5025
02:16:50,530 --> 02:16:51,363
Is He rebelling?

5026
02:16:52,750 --> 02:16:56,970
There's no proxies out there and I
don't know what's the exact college

5027
02:16:56,980 --> 02:16:57,730
wrestling?

5028
02:16:57,730 --> 02:16:58,830
I watched the finals

5029
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:01,150
freak.

5030
02:17:01,150 --> 02:17:01,950
He's a silver,

5031
02:17:01,950 --> 02:17:03,100
a blonde silver back.

5032
02:17:03,890 --> 02:17:04,700
Is it evolution?

5033
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:07,000
Are we seeing the last of the Viking DNA?

5034
02:17:07,001 --> 02:17:08,650
Cause he is a regular sized wife.

5035
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:09,550
Guys are growing straight.

5036
02:17:09,551 --> 02:17:10,120
Emo Now.

5037
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:10,390
Yeah,

5038
02:17:10,390 --> 02:17:11,980
probably he has a regular size wife.

5039
02:17:11,981 --> 02:17:14,080
I'm sure his children
would be fucking gigantic.

5040
02:17:14,081 --> 02:17:15,610
But while Amy was a pro wrestler,

5041
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:15,970
right,

5042
02:17:15,970 --> 02:17:16,500
she was a,

5043
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:17,333
he's wife.

5044
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:17,881
She was a,

5045
02:17:17,881 --> 02:17:18,670
she was stable.

5046
02:17:18,670 --> 02:17:22,580
She was saying was sable
and Jude was fucking fine.

5047
02:17:23,230 --> 02:17:23,621
Beautiful.

5048
02:17:23,621 --> 02:17:24,370
He did well.

5049
02:17:24,370 --> 02:17:25,203
He did well for himself.

5050
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:27,610
[inaudible] to jack off to middle school.

5051
02:17:27,611 --> 02:17:28,740
How dare you say that?

5052
02:17:29,550 --> 02:17:29,740
No,

5053
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:30,573
it's a good thing

5054
02:17:33,150 --> 02:17:34,000
you don't do shit.

5055
02:17:34,030 --> 02:17:34,840
You fake fighting.

5056
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:35,081
Oh,

5057
02:17:35,081 --> 02:17:35,914
how dare you.

5058
02:17:36,330 --> 02:17:37,660
It's true too.

5059
02:17:37,661 --> 02:17:37,841
Boy,

5060
02:17:37,841 --> 02:17:39,040
if you met him in an alley,

5061
02:17:39,041 --> 02:17:40,910
he's like one of the worst people
you could run into it for him.

5062
02:17:40,930 --> 02:17:42,400
He would rate me a brief exchange.

5063
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:43,661
Let's be real.

5064
02:17:43,661 --> 02:17:45,400
He raped me and I have to do something.

5065
02:17:45,401 --> 02:17:46,330
I have to jump on his back.

5066
02:17:46,331 --> 02:17:47,001
Don't pry.

5067
02:17:47,001 --> 02:17:48,370
I'd have to pull them aside and say,

5068
02:17:48,371 --> 02:17:49,204
listen,

5069
02:17:52,570 --> 02:17:54,050
his kids are going to be freaks.

5070
02:17:54,150 --> 02:17:55,310
Kids will probably stole it from us.

5071
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:57,940
So when his kids grow to
be about 18 years old,

5072
02:17:57,941 --> 02:17:58,960
we'll start getting nervous again,

5073
02:17:59,350 --> 02:18:00,183
but until

5074
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:03,890
there's no price out,

5075
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:05,361
she's beautiful.

5076
02:18:05,361 --> 02:18:05,800
I'm looking at,

5077
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:05,921
well,

5078
02:18:05,921 --> 02:18:09,520
who is that dude that just
fought that kickboxer dude.

5079
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:10,430
Um,

5080
02:18:10,430 --> 02:18:10,720
uh,

5081
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:11,890
black gentlemen from an,

5082
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:12,280
from,

5083
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:14,290
was it from Africa in the UFC?

5084
02:18:14,310 --> 02:18:14,561
Yeah.

5085
02:18:14,561 --> 02:18:15,850
You're talking about the dude from France.

5086
02:18:15,851 --> 02:18:16,570
From France.

5087
02:18:16,570 --> 02:18:17,403
That's right.

5088
02:18:18,010 --> 02:18:19,780
He was like a shittier looking check.

5089
02:18:19,810 --> 02:18:21,340
Congo dreads.

5090
02:18:21,430 --> 02:18:22,420
Asti power.

5091
02:18:22,630 --> 02:18:23,021
Yes.

5092
02:18:23,021 --> 02:18:23,540
To power.

5093
02:18:23,540 --> 02:18:23,801
Sure.

5094
02:18:23,801 --> 02:18:24,634
Take him down.

5095
02:18:24,850 --> 02:18:25,061
Yeah.

5096
02:18:25,061 --> 02:18:26,620
Well he got taken down the first round.

5097
02:18:27,010 --> 02:18:27,843
Who was that?

5098
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:32,290
What was tray Bree sable
though was the hotness?

5099
02:18:32,291 --> 02:18:32,650
I haven't,

5100
02:18:32,650 --> 02:18:34,150
I haven't talked about her forever.

5101
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:35,613
Sable.

5102
02:18:36,670 --> 02:18:37,001
Okay.

5103
02:18:37,001 --> 02:18:41,950
If you can get like Gabby Garcia and
Shane car went to have a kid cause lawdy

5104
02:18:41,951 --> 02:18:42,784
Miss Kalata.

5105
02:18:43,080 --> 02:18:44,230
What would we have?

5106
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:45,093
What will we have?

5107
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:47,830
Shane Carwyn and Gabby Garcia.

5108
02:18:48,250 --> 02:18:49,000
Oh Shit.

5109
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:49,833
Oh Shit.

5110
02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:51,820
You got a woman who's six foot four.

5111
02:18:51,850 --> 02:18:53,500
You periscoping you fuck no.

5112
02:18:53,850 --> 02:18:57,680
Was he doing periscope is no idea.

5113
02:18:57,940 --> 02:19:00,070
Shane car went and Gabby
Garcia have a baby.

5114
02:19:00,071 --> 02:19:02,320
You think that's the
ultimate super athletes,

5115
02:19:02,470 --> 02:19:02,800
bro.

5116
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:03,730
Fuck that shit.

5117
02:19:03,770 --> 02:19:04,010
No,

5118
02:19:04,010 --> 02:19:04,843
no.

5119
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:06,850
Shane Carwyn and Serena Williams.

5120
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:06,971
Oh,

5121
02:19:06,971 --> 02:19:07,420
you're right.

5122
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:07,770
You're right.

5123
02:19:07,770 --> 02:19:08,860
In a racial as well.

5124
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:09,771
Yes.

5125
02:19:09,771 --> 02:19:10,450
Yeah,

5126
02:19:10,450 --> 02:19:10,631
yeah.

5127
02:19:10,631 --> 02:19:15,631
There's just a lot of emotional power
to both sides combining together in one

5128
02:19:16,781 --> 02:19:18,900
furious in that kid to the lettuces.

5129
02:19:19,390 --> 02:19:20,940
Just send it to the loan only.

5130
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,330
Don't make him rich and happy.

5131
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:23,680
You send them just,

5132
02:19:23,810 --> 02:19:25,210
they might not make it
out of there though.

5133
02:19:25,270 --> 02:19:25,541
Nah,

5134
02:19:25,541 --> 02:19:26,330
they'll figure it out.

5135
02:19:26,330 --> 02:19:27,163
I don't know.

5136
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:28,153
That's a rescue

5137
02:19:30,660 --> 02:19:31,700
you have to make more than one.

5138
02:19:33,770 --> 02:19:36,780
Do we get on this book is
your baby has this ridiculous,

5139
02:19:39,360 --> 02:19:40,200
what was that movie?

5140
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:43,660
The guy who was born with a deformity.

5141
02:19:43,700 --> 02:19:45,140
You're talking about
the launch with share.

5142
02:19:45,290 --> 02:19:45,840
We share.

5143
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:47,080
That's mask

5144
02:19:50,340 --> 02:19:51,100
fair guy.

5145
02:19:51,100 --> 02:19:53,710
The Bear Guy Meets Sulu the bear man.

5146
02:19:53,980 --> 02:19:54,281
Oh,

5147
02:19:54,281 --> 02:19:54,710
okay.

5148
02:19:54,710 --> 02:19:57,330
It's a new bear guy and his
face got ripped off too.

5149
02:19:58,300 --> 02:19:59,133
Did he get killed?

5150
02:19:59,750 --> 02:20:00,490
Oh boy.

5151
02:20:00,490 --> 02:20:01,500
Do you know Jamie are yet?

5152
02:20:01,630 --> 02:20:03,820
You guessing they kind
of deserve it though?

5153
02:20:03,821 --> 02:20:04,654
Yeah.

5154
02:20:05,020 --> 02:20:06,100
Find out if he got killed.

5155
02:20:06,101 --> 02:20:08,020
So it looks like the
bearing number B watermelon,

5156
02:20:08,021 --> 02:20:08,440
Huh?

5157
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:08,651
Well,

5158
02:20:08,651 --> 02:20:09,610
here's the thing about bears,

5159
02:20:09,611 --> 02:20:09,881
man.

5160
02:20:09,881 --> 02:20:14,290
Bears can be a lot like dogs if
they're like really taken care of.

5161
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:16,180
If you feed them and loved them,

5162
02:20:16,181 --> 02:20:18,760
like people have lived with bears
where they like swim with bears,

5163
02:20:18,970 --> 02:20:20,680
would you gotta be with them
for the time they were a baby?

5164
02:20:20,681 --> 02:20:21,250
They can never be,

5165
02:20:21,250 --> 02:20:22,270
never be feral.

5166
02:20:22,540 --> 02:20:22,891
And you,

5167
02:20:22,891 --> 02:20:25,060
you gotta be able to raise
them and give them love.

5168
02:20:25,061 --> 02:20:25,750
So they,

5169
02:20:25,750 --> 02:20:28,660
they sort of have to identify with you.

5170
02:20:28,870 --> 02:20:30,210
They have to give a precise date,

5171
02:20:30,220 --> 02:20:31,330
but the imprint on you,

5172
02:20:31,540 --> 02:20:32,440
but they're like a dog.

5173
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:33,070
And a lot of ways,

5174
02:20:33,070 --> 02:20:33,791
I agree with you,

5175
02:20:33,791 --> 02:20:37,240
it's always a risk because you're
dealing with something that like one

5176
02:20:37,241 --> 02:20:39,910
generation removed was completely wild.

5177
02:20:40,180 --> 02:20:42,760
Like you could easily have a
grizzly bear where you are.

5178
02:20:42,790 --> 02:20:43,630
You're the mother.

5179
02:20:43,631 --> 02:20:47,380
Grizzly bear had a fight for its life
against a mountain lion that was trying to

5180
02:20:47,381 --> 02:20:48,220
kill this baby.

5181
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:48,611
You know,

5182
02:20:48,611 --> 02:20:49,960
that's totally possible.

5183
02:20:49,961 --> 02:20:51,310
And then here it is,

5184
02:20:51,340 --> 02:20:54,400
like one generation later you got the
pop and it's living in your house.

5185
02:20:54,420 --> 02:20:55,420
Tell you write this cup.

5186
02:20:55,540 --> 02:20:59,290
I'd rather chill with those grizzly bears
than the sum of those chimpanzees and

5187
02:20:59,291 --> 02:21:00,124
Shit in my house.

5188
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:00,851
That's good.

5189
02:21:00,851 --> 02:21:03,700
Call chimpanzees might decide to fuck you.

5190
02:21:06,450 --> 02:21:08,270
These are beers.

5191
02:21:08,271 --> 02:21:09,500
Just gonna rip my throat out.

5192
02:21:10,070 --> 02:21:12,740
Fucking shit wants to bust that.

5193
02:21:12,741 --> 02:21:13,341
None of my ass.

5194
02:21:13,341 --> 02:21:14,091
He's going to do it.

5195
02:21:14,091 --> 02:21:14,281
You know,

5196
02:21:14,281 --> 02:21:15,830
it's on the verge of suicide.

5197
02:21:15,831 --> 02:21:17,120
If you want to commit suicide,

5198
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:19,250
then that might be a good idea.

5199
02:21:19,430 --> 02:21:19,941
You know what?

5200
02:21:19,941 --> 02:21:20,960
Since you're going to kill herself,

5201
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:23,610
why not go fucking live
with lions saying that he,

5202
02:21:23,670 --> 02:21:24,171
you know what I mean?

5203
02:21:24,171 --> 02:21:24,921
See what happens.

5204
02:21:24,921 --> 02:21:25,760
And then if they kill you,

5205
02:21:25,761 --> 02:21:27,050
whatever you were going to kill yourself.

5206
02:21:27,051 --> 02:21:27,690
Anyways.

5207
02:21:27,690 --> 02:21:31,970
Guy In South Africa lives at 21 lions
and wrestles getting of mine as well.

5208
02:21:33,610 --> 02:21:34,490
Turn out great.

5209
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:34,791
Yeah,

5210
02:21:34,791 --> 02:21:35,624
that works out.

5211
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:37,160
Are you suicidal?

5212
02:21:37,550 --> 02:21:39,550
Call this number now guys.

5213
02:21:39,650 --> 02:21:44,270
Guys to do is we'll do whatever they can
to separate themselves from the pack to

5214
02:21:44,820 --> 02:21:45,980
scientists that are like,

5215
02:21:45,981 --> 02:21:49,610
they want to gain data that like you
gotta you gotta be suicidal to go into

5216
02:21:49,611 --> 02:21:50,750
those motherfucking dens.

5217
02:21:50,751 --> 02:21:51,950
Did Rochelle Catch Roy?

5218
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:53,510
Is that what you meant
when he fell he slept.

5219
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:54,320
I slept.

5220
02:21:54,320 --> 02:21:57,320
I'm surprised and I try and do that all
the time and I get embarrassed when I

5221
02:21:57,321 --> 02:21:58,040
like I'll go,

5222
02:21:58,040 --> 02:21:58,401
oh,

5223
02:21:58,401 --> 02:22:01,460
and some won't land and
I'm my own professional.

5224
02:22:01,790 --> 02:22:04,550
Like I'm at the fights calling the fight
and someone throws a head kick and it

5225
02:22:04,551 --> 02:22:05,330
doesn't land,

5226
02:22:05,330 --> 02:22:05,751
but it like,

5227
02:22:05,751 --> 02:22:06,900
looks like it's going to land

5228
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:07,671
last minute.

5229
02:22:07,671 --> 02:22:07,960
It gets to,

5230
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:08,231
I'm like,

5231
02:22:08,231 --> 02:22:09,064
oh my God,

5232
02:22:09,390 --> 02:22:10,660
but it's genuine.

5233
02:22:10,661 --> 02:22:11,494
I swear to God

5234
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:15,210
folks got to slip when I
talking to when I yell out.

5235
02:22:15,430 --> 02:22:16,140
Like I don't,

5236
02:22:16,140 --> 02:22:17,820
I don't do that accidentally.

5237
02:22:17,930 --> 02:22:18,201
I mean,

5238
02:22:18,201 --> 02:22:18,861
I don't do that.

5239
02:22:18,861 --> 02:22:19,340
Uh,

5240
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:20,173
artificially.

5241
02:22:20,990 --> 02:22:21,823
This looks like it

5242
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:23,520
guys look like they're completely related.

5243
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:24,950
Yeah,

5244
02:22:24,950 --> 02:22:25,783
definitely.

5245
02:22:28,150 --> 02:22:28,891
Same species,

5246
02:22:28,891 --> 02:22:29,940
exact same speech.

5247
02:22:29,941 --> 02:22:31,440
This isn't confusing at all.

5248
02:22:31,470 --> 02:22:31,950
You know,

5249
02:22:31,950 --> 02:22:33,850
good thing he has a beard
because I wouldn't remember.

5250
02:22:33,870 --> 02:22:34,171
I wouldn't.

5251
02:22:34,171 --> 02:22:34,501
I'd be like,

5252
02:22:34,501 --> 02:22:35,130
Huh?

5253
02:22:35,130 --> 02:22:37,560
I remember when Keith
Hackney fought a manual.

5254
02:22:37,561 --> 02:22:38,394
Yarbrough,

5255
02:22:38,530 --> 02:22:39,930
you'll do whatever you like.

5256
02:22:39,931 --> 02:22:40,201
Okay,

5257
02:22:40,201 --> 02:22:41,130
what's going on here?

5258
02:22:41,250 --> 02:22:42,060
These things,

5259
02:22:42,060 --> 02:22:45,450
these things are so not
similar in their size.

5260
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:48,390
These two individuals that both it,

5261
02:22:48,990 --> 02:22:50,110
he's doing no show.

5262
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:52,740
We'll show it looks like a
supermodel version of the mask.

5263
02:22:52,741 --> 02:22:53,060
Right?

5264
02:22:53,060 --> 02:22:58,060
[inaudible] sacred here.

5265
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:06,570
How is that talking shit?

5266
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:08,260
I said you look like a supermom

5267
02:23:10,670 --> 02:23:12,900
from the sheer shoes is my favorite show.

5268
02:23:13,430 --> 02:23:14,040
Yes.

5269
02:23:14,040 --> 02:23:14,873
Yes.

5270
02:23:18,700 --> 02:23:19,110
Devin.

5271
02:23:19,110 --> 02:23:19,420
Eddie,

5272
02:23:19,420 --> 02:23:19,630
look,

5273
02:23:19,630 --> 02:23:20,460
look,

5274
02:23:20,460 --> 02:23:21,370
that's terrible.

5275
02:23:22,080 --> 02:23:24,990
That's probably the [inaudible] per bottle

5276
02:23:27,460 --> 02:23:28,293
is better.

5277
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:30,790
I'm going a joke and
say that I'm doing my,

5278
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:31,640
like I said,

5279
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:32,473
you better

5280
02:23:34,290 --> 02:23:34,771
say something,

5281
02:23:34,771 --> 02:23:34,981
man.

5282
02:23:34,981 --> 02:23:35,580
You're joking.

5283
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:37,110
Social Berg,

5284
02:23:37,140 --> 02:23:39,060
it's going to cost Roy Nelson this fight.

5285
02:23:39,061 --> 02:23:40,660
The Karma of your joke is so

5286
02:23:42,510 --> 02:23:43,470
it's a compliment.

5287
02:23:43,471 --> 02:23:44,920
It might've caught over Wales.

5288
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:46,740
Here's a trivia question.

5289
02:23:46,741 --> 02:23:47,574
Who is the accurate?

5290
02:23:47,950 --> 02:23:49,650
He's a real dude.

5291
02:23:49,651 --> 02:23:50,161
Come on,

5292
02:23:50,161 --> 02:23:50,580
man.

5293
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:51,420
That's not makeup.

5294
02:23:51,421 --> 02:23:52,390
That's a real dance.

5295
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:54,331
No,

5296
02:23:54,331 --> 02:23:55,670
I thought that was a no,

5297
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:56,110
no,

5298
02:23:56,110 --> 02:23:56,630
no.

5299
02:23:56,630 --> 02:23:57,390
It's Eric Stoltz.

5300
02:23:57,390 --> 02:23:57,571
No,

5301
02:23:57,571 --> 02:23:57,781
no,

5302
02:23:57,781 --> 02:23:58,614
that's Eric Stoltz.

5303
02:23:58,940 --> 02:23:59,773
Yeah,

5304
02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:00,850
sure.

5305
02:24:00,850 --> 02:24:01,770
Got Derek Brennan.

5306
02:24:02,010 --> 02:24:02,970
How bad that make you feel?

5307
02:24:03,040 --> 02:24:03,481
I was like,

5308
02:24:03,481 --> 02:24:04,314
oh no,

5309
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:04,501
no.

5310
02:24:04,501 --> 02:24:05,380
I knew it was never installed.

5311
02:24:05,430 --> 02:24:05,910
Here's a,

5312
02:24:05,910 --> 02:24:08,070
here's a little Jiu Jitsu trivia powder.

5313
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:08,821
Remember that dude,

5314
02:24:08,821 --> 02:24:09,654
Sean Patrick

5315
02:24:11,190 --> 02:24:11,671
Jujitsu.

5316
02:24:11,671 --> 02:24:13,590
Legit blackout under Shawn Williams.

5319
02:24:14,851 --> 02:24:15,990
Henzel Gracie black belt

5320
02:24:18,210 --> 02:24:19,110
after powder.

5321
02:24:19,230 --> 02:24:19,441
Well,

5322
02:24:19,441 --> 02:24:20,820
here's the deal.

5323
02:24:21,750 --> 02:24:22,620
The Guy who,

5324
02:24:22,680 --> 02:24:26,010
the guy who directed powder
was a guy who is like,

5325
02:24:26,250 --> 02:24:30,660
there was some controversy about some
alleged child molestation charges,

5326
02:24:31,110 --> 02:24:36,110
which made powder or really weird
movie was powder was kind of like,

5327
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:37,200
uh,

5328
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:40,470
like a nambla love story
to a lot of people.

5329
02:24:40,470 --> 02:24:44,910
There was a hole about like
that guy he got in trouble.

5330
02:24:45,060 --> 02:24:46,530
The guy who direct like not,

5331
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:49,980
it wasn't a little thing like he
got in like real criminal trouble.

5332
02:24:49,981 --> 02:24:51,420
I do not remember we shit.

5333
02:24:52,500 --> 02:24:54,320
I do not remember the
specifics I'm going to watch.

5334
02:24:55,320 --> 02:24:56,370
I don't think there is,

5335
02:24:56,371 --> 02:24:58,850
but there's no fight out.

5336
02:24:58,860 --> 02:25:00,600
Jamie flipping here.

5337
02:25:00,601 --> 02:25:00,991
Hold on a sec.

5338
02:25:00,991 --> 02:25:01,380
Here we go.

5339
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:03,000
Barry Crimmins was when
the talking about it,

5340
02:25:03,001 --> 02:25:04,260
I believe they're on the case of Netflix.

5341
02:25:04,261 --> 02:25:05,250
Barry Crimmins,

5342
02:25:05,310 --> 02:25:06,170
was he talking about that?

5343
02:25:06,180 --> 02:25:07,350
He was talking about AOL.

5344
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:09,090
Barry Crimmins was talking about AOL,

5345
02:25:09,091 --> 02:25:11,580
how child molesters were
selling things to AOL,

5346
02:25:11,581 --> 02:25:15,120
but Barry Crimmins did
comment about that guy on a,

5347
02:25:15,150 --> 02:25:16,180
was it on a podcast?

5348
02:25:16,220 --> 02:25:17,053
Was It on Twitter?

5349
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:18,720
I thought that's how I heard about it.

5350
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:20,190
Maybe you might be right.

5351
02:25:20,220 --> 02:25:20,761
You might be right.

5352
02:25:20,761 --> 02:25:24,340
I had known about it before that I'd
read a are there was a big article

5353
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:25,030
that was about it,

5354
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:26,800
I want to say like two years ago,

5355
02:25:27,370 --> 02:25:27,970
but uh,

5356
02:25:27,970 --> 02:25:28,181
yeah.

5357
02:25:28,181 --> 02:25:28,990
Barry,

5358
02:25:28,990 --> 02:25:29,800
of course,

5359
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:31,210
if you don't know Barry Crimmins is,

5360
02:25:31,211 --> 02:25:35,800
he's a Boston comedy legend and he had
a Bobcat Goldthwait documentary called

5361
02:25:35,801 --> 02:25:37,720
call me lucky and it's about his,

5362
02:25:37,750 --> 02:25:39,670
he'd getting molested when he was a kid.

5363
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:40,601
It's horrific,

5364
02:25:40,601 --> 02:25:41,080
man.

5365
02:25:41,080 --> 02:25:42,370
He was two years old.

5366
02:25:42,570 --> 02:25:44,470
He was four years old
and it's babysitters.

5367
02:25:44,471 --> 02:25:45,670
Boyfriend would fuck him.

5368
02:25:46,780 --> 02:25:47,980
God Damn.

5369
02:25:48,370 --> 02:25:49,510
Why didn't you bring the podcast?

5370
02:25:50,020 --> 02:25:50,381
Dude?

5371
02:25:50,381 --> 02:25:51,210
You got to see it.

5372
02:25:51,210 --> 02:25:51,770
I'm fine to me.

5373
02:25:51,770 --> 02:25:53,380
Call me Lucky's and amazing dot.

5374
02:25:54,670 --> 02:25:55,503
Here's the guy.

5375
02:25:55,560 --> 02:25:56,393
Look at this.

5376
02:25:56,560 --> 02:25:58,720
Victor Salvo loves terrorizing.

5377
02:25:58,721 --> 02:25:59,990
Semi-Naked use.

5378
02:26:00,010 --> 02:26:00,843
That's a scary,

5379
02:26:00,850 --> 02:26:01,683
no shit.

5380
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:03,480
[inaudible]

5381
02:26:03,630 --> 02:26:05,710
that's from 2012 from vice.

5382
02:26:06,850 --> 02:26:07,601
Take her shirt off.

5383
02:26:07,601 --> 02:26:08,434
Ready?

5384
02:26:09,870 --> 02:26:10,930
What do you mean terrorizing

5385
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:15,000
bottoms on tops off.

5386
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:15,873
Exactly.

5387
02:26:16,330 --> 02:26:17,320
Take a pair of pants up.

5388
02:26:17,321 --> 02:26:17,920
Move around.

5389
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:18,840
I might kick you.

5390
02:26:18,860 --> 02:26:19,693
I don't know.

5391
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:22,480
I might Damn Royce go for the shake.

5392
02:26:22,550 --> 02:26:23,383
Kill now.

5393
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:26,140
Three for three year before it was cool.

5394
02:26:27,370 --> 02:26:28,870
He's a hipster for a take down.

5395
02:26:28,871 --> 02:26:29,680
Did not get it.

5396
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:34,030
Roy Roy's wrestling's underrated Liquidia
to Barnett that he has a loss on his

5397
02:26:34,031 --> 02:26:34,391
record.

5398
02:26:34,391 --> 02:26:38,080
That I think is one of the most unfair
standups I lost against our Lawsky side

5399
02:26:38,081 --> 02:26:39,610
control working on a Kamora.

5400
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:41,830
He has a full double wrist lock.

5401
02:26:41,831 --> 02:26:42,630
He has the double Russell.

5402
02:26:42,630 --> 02:26:45,370
He doesn't have the lock right
cause he has to get it locked.

5403
02:26:45,730 --> 02:26:47,310
Turned behind the back on a song guy.

5404
02:26:47,860 --> 02:26:51,550
It's a Camorra's an interesting move
because Marcello Garcia doesn't like to do

5405
02:26:51,551 --> 02:26:53,590
it because he thinks
it's a strong man move.

5406
02:26:53,950 --> 02:26:54,490
He doesn't,

5407
02:26:54,490 --> 02:26:55,301
he doesn't incorporate it.

5408
02:26:55,301 --> 02:26:56,170
He's all about chokes.

5409
02:26:56,171 --> 02:26:58,480
He's all about whatever he
does has to work on everybody.

5410
02:26:59,340 --> 02:27:00,370
When we wrote that,

5411
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:02,020
nothing wrong with that at all.

5412
02:27:02,021 --> 02:27:02,854
Weird way to,

5413
02:27:03,240 --> 02:27:04,000
there's a he,

5414
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:04,360
he,

5415
02:27:04,360 --> 02:27:04,750
you know,

5416
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:09,750
he doesn't believe in any kind of chokes
with our men like triangles or Darcy

5417
02:27:11,540 --> 02:27:12,960
has happened is that guy,

5418
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:14,170
but I understand.

5419
02:27:14,410 --> 02:27:15,190
I understand.

5420
02:27:15,190 --> 02:27:15,611
Really,

5421
02:27:15,611 --> 02:27:18,490
totally understand that a a shit.

5422
02:27:18,820 --> 02:27:21,040
If he only focus you take that time.

5423
02:27:21,310 --> 02:27:23,170
Everybody has the same
amount of time to drill.

5424
02:27:23,171 --> 02:27:24,340
Everyone has the same time.

5425
02:27:24,341 --> 02:27:25,810
Everyone has 24 hours in a day.

5426
02:27:25,811 --> 02:27:26,680
Everyone has a life.

5427
02:27:26,681 --> 02:27:27,514
Everyone did that.

5428
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:29,230
Everyone has the same on the fucking time.

5429
02:27:29,231 --> 02:27:29,890
Generally,

5430
02:27:29,890 --> 02:27:33,580
what are you going to do with that block
every day when you break it all down,

5431
02:27:33,581 --> 02:27:34,720
what are you going to do with that block?

5432
02:27:35,080 --> 02:27:35,913
If you say,

5433
02:27:35,980 --> 02:27:40,300
why don't you save all that time
for shit that works on the big guys?

5434
02:27:40,540 --> 02:27:41,590
If it works on the big guys,

5435
02:27:41,591 --> 02:27:42,540
it's going to work on the small guys,

5436
02:27:42,660 --> 02:27:43,930
so let's just work on that.

5437
02:27:44,140 --> 02:27:46,990
There's nothing wrong with
that at motherfucking all.

5438
02:27:47,140 --> 02:27:48,160
That's really it.

5439
02:27:48,250 --> 02:27:49,240
That's genius.

5440
02:27:49,540 --> 02:27:50,530
Me Personally,

5441
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:55,740
I like working on everything that works
on guys that have like 15 pounds on you.

5442
02:27:58,180 --> 02:27:59,013
You know what I mean?

5443
02:27:59,170 --> 02:28:01,690
Because you're going to be rolling
out a lot with guys that are your uh,

5444
02:28:01,720 --> 02:28:05,230
your size and maybe as long as it works
on guys that have a little weight on

5445
02:28:05,231 --> 02:28:05,860
you,

5446
02:28:05,860 --> 02:28:06,990
I'm into those most.

5447
02:28:06,991 --> 02:28:08,410
To me that's a legit move.

5448
02:28:08,530 --> 02:28:11,530
If that works on a guy that's
around your size at a high level,

5449
02:28:11,890 --> 02:28:15,100
I want that in my character
actually just talking about that.

5450
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:16,240
He would work on chokes.

5451
02:28:16,270 --> 02:28:18,280
He said Tokes always work,

5452
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:19,720
whereas other stuff,

5453
02:28:19,750 --> 02:28:21,070
but there's a difference between,

5454
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:23,300
there's a difference
between a arm in chokes,

5455
02:28:23,301 --> 02:28:27,200
like Darcy is Japanese like tires arm
and give teens and then straight net

5456
02:28:27,201 --> 02:28:30,440
trucks like Marcella teens and all
these weird little fucking things like

5457
02:28:30,500 --> 02:28:31,221
Rothwell on,

5458
02:28:31,221 --> 02:28:32,054
on Barnett.

5459
02:28:32,420 --> 02:28:34,220
There's all these Ninja chokes and shit.

5460
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:39,400
There's about 23 motherfucking ways to
squeeze the neck to make a motherfucker

5461
02:28:40,071 --> 02:28:40,904
tat,

5462
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:41,601
you know what I mean?

5463
02:28:41,601 --> 02:28:46,130
So all those take special
time to get good at.

5464
02:28:46,190 --> 02:28:50,960
Just because you're good at one of the
23 makes it has nothing to do with are

5465
02:28:50,961 --> 02:28:52,570
you good at this one or
are you going to that one?

5466
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:55,430
You got to spend the same
amount of time on that shit.

5467
02:28:55,610 --> 02:28:56,870
It might give you a little boost.

5468
02:28:56,871 --> 02:28:58,690
If you're really good this
one then you'll really,

5469
02:28:58,730 --> 02:29:02,160
you'll get really good at this one
quicker than a guy who's not good at that

5470
02:29:02,161 --> 02:29:02,690
one.

5471
02:29:02,690 --> 02:29:07,690
But generally you've got to spend time
and all these chokes to master any,

5472
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:08,511
let me ask this for,

5473
02:29:08,511 --> 02:29:09,620
I forget who was that.

5474
02:29:09,660 --> 02:29:12,320
There was one choke that I
saw only once in the UFC.

5475
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:17,510
It was a choke like Gogo Plata by a
kid who was a tiger showmen student.

5476
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:21,320
Nick Nick something or another it the UFC.

5477
02:29:21,350 --> 02:29:21,860
Yes.

5478
02:29:21,860 --> 02:29:26,720
He had some crazy choke and he said that
he invented it while it was going on.

5479
02:29:26,930 --> 02:29:27,231
He's like,

5480
02:29:27,231 --> 02:29:28,520
I'm venting it in the fight.

5481
02:29:28,950 --> 02:29:29,783
Um,

5482
02:29:30,110 --> 02:29:31,610
I have no idea what that is.

5483
02:29:31,611 --> 02:29:32,450
Do you know what I'm talking about?

5484
02:29:32,451 --> 02:29:33,960
I know what I'm talking
about but I don't remember.

5485
02:29:33,970 --> 02:29:34,820
I couldn't show you.

5486
02:29:35,510 --> 02:29:38,230
I showed him techniques
all the Goddamn time.

5487
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:39,320
None of my shit.

5488
02:29:39,500 --> 02:29:41,660
I should have videotaped
that cause that shit gone

5489
02:29:44,350 --> 02:29:46,370
take new shit.

5490
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:47,713
Nick Pace.

5491
02:29:48,250 --> 02:29:49,083
Yes.

5492
02:29:49,230 --> 02:29:50,260
He did some crazy.

5493
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:53,200
See if you can find a submission because
there was some weird legs and Michigan

5494
02:29:53,360 --> 02:29:53,680
Trump,

5495
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:54,513
I can show you.

5496
02:29:54,650 --> 02:29:59,650
Well I remember it was something to
zoo with a Shin across the neck by the

5497
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:01,430
guests.

5498
02:30:01,430 --> 02:30:02,091
It was a joke.

5499
02:30:02,091 --> 02:30:06,120
It was some weird choke that had to do
with some weird like Alma Plata type set

5500
02:30:06,121 --> 02:30:09,650
up and he wound up in some position with
his Shin underneath this guy's choke

5501
02:30:09,880 --> 02:30:13,340
and underneath this guy's
neck in an unconventional
way that I don't necessarily

5502
02:30:13,341 --> 02:30:14,174
remember.

5503
02:30:14,510 --> 02:30:15,343
I'd have to see it again.

5504
02:30:15,350 --> 02:30:19,310
But I remember saying if you done that
before and he said that was the first

5505
02:30:19,311 --> 02:30:19,711
time he did it,

5506
02:30:19,711 --> 02:30:20,210
ever did it.

5507
02:30:20,210 --> 02:30:20,541
Is there,

5508
02:30:20,541 --> 02:30:22,340
is there a huge difference between guys?

5509
02:30:22,341 --> 02:30:23,030
Crazy.

5510
02:30:23,030 --> 02:30:23,863
Is there a huge difference?

5511
02:30:24,350 --> 02:30:26,270
Really good guys now and 10 years ago.

5512
02:30:26,780 --> 02:30:27,270
Oh,

5513
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:27,950
Jujitsu wise,

5514
02:30:27,950 --> 02:30:28,880
like all different techniques.

5515
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:34,240
That's like saying is there a difference
in standup comedy now in general as in

5516
02:30:35,061 --> 02:30:38,590
the 80s come on in the 80s of his
co there's really got them right.

5517
02:30:38,840 --> 02:30:39,673
You know what I mean?

5518
02:30:39,830 --> 02:30:41,000
Same Day,

5519
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:41,953
same

5520
02:30:43,980 --> 02:30:44,781
look up behind you.

5521
02:30:44,781 --> 02:30:47,230
That's the choke nick pace
going to show us to it.

5522
02:30:47,231 --> 02:30:48,080
Why is it looks so crappy,

5523
02:30:48,081 --> 02:30:48,914
Jamie?

5524
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:50,270
See you look at this.

5525
02:30:50,270 --> 02:30:51,320
He grabs it like this.

5526
02:30:51,321 --> 02:30:52,790
He throws the leg over the neck,

5527
02:30:53,410 --> 02:30:57,410
shoots under like this and he
grabs his ankle gun show control.

5528
02:30:57,560 --> 02:30:58,161
That's called gun,

5529
02:30:58,161 --> 02:30:59,240
but he chokes him from here.

5530
02:30:59,300 --> 02:30:59,750
Yup.

5531
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:00,470
Yup.

5532
02:31:00,470 --> 02:31:01,303
I got a guy,

5533
02:31:01,360 --> 02:31:02,860
Ben Eddy who does this ship.

5534
02:31:03,570 --> 02:31:04,403
So all the time

5535
02:31:05,970 --> 02:31:10,540
Dan came up with this on the
fly in the UFC dam and um,

5536
02:31:10,830 --> 02:31:11,140
how many,

5537
02:31:11,140 --> 02:31:11,540
you know,

5538
02:31:11,540 --> 02:31:12,640
he calls it the pace choke.

5539
02:31:12,820 --> 02:31:13,350
I don't,

5540
02:31:13,350 --> 02:31:14,690
I hair is great.

5541
02:31:14,750 --> 02:31:15,760
I do want to do that.

5542
02:31:15,770 --> 02:31:17,390
Eve Joe's cow.

5543
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:19,060
Now check out.

5544
02:31:19,070 --> 02:31:23,640
He always has really legit
whose style is based off.

5545
02:31:23,641 --> 02:31:24,720
That said it looks nice,

5546
02:31:25,150 --> 02:31:26,550
but I'm going to show control.

5547
02:31:27,510 --> 02:31:28,440
Spend a lot of times.

5548
02:31:28,700 --> 02:31:29,190
That's a,

5549
02:31:29,190 --> 02:31:30,480
that's an atomic green.

5550
02:31:30,510 --> 02:31:33,020
Those guys taught Tiger
Schulman for a lot of children.

5551
02:31:33,540 --> 02:31:34,373
Those guys were

5552
02:31:34,420 --> 02:31:37,210
giant karate chain in um,

5553
02:31:37,390 --> 02:31:39,010
the east coast in New York all the time.

5554
02:31:39,011 --> 02:31:39,980
Like you both vehicles.

5555
02:31:40,060 --> 02:31:41,710
They didn't think of him as legit,

5556
02:31:41,950 --> 02:31:43,750
like necessarily because they thought,

5557
02:31:43,751 --> 02:31:44,050
well,

5558
02:31:44,050 --> 02:31:46,060
most giant karate schools aren't legit.

5559
02:31:46,070 --> 02:31:46,420
Yeah.

5560
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:47,170
However,

5561
02:31:47,170 --> 02:31:48,010
they are legit.

5562
02:31:48,230 --> 02:31:49,450
Me Think Uriah Hall,

5563
02:31:49,540 --> 02:31:50,373
this fucking kid,

5564
02:31:50,380 --> 02:31:51,730
nick pace came from there.

5565
02:31:51,731 --> 02:31:54,880
I'm that guy who won last,

5566
02:31:54,881 --> 02:31:55,870
Frankie Rivera,

5567
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:59,530
the guy who won last week
against a Uri Alcantara.

5568
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:00,633
He's from there.

5569
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:01,473
Jimmy Rivera.

5570
02:32:01,720 --> 02:32:02,410
James Rivera.

5571
02:32:02,410 --> 02:32:05,620
There's a lot of fucking really high
level guys from Tiger Shellmans.

5572
02:32:05,950 --> 02:32:08,170
Tiger shot with Uriah Hall is look,

5573
02:32:08,200 --> 02:32:10,780
his kickboxers standup is ridiculous.

5574
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:12,040
It gets karate skills.

5575
02:32:12,070 --> 02:32:15,360
Fucking ridiculous that that spinning
back kick to the face that he called gay

5576
02:32:15,370 --> 02:32:16,180
guard with.

5577
02:32:16,180 --> 02:32:16,751
He's nasty.

5578
02:32:16,751 --> 02:32:18,100
That's all tiger showmen man.

5579
02:32:18,550 --> 02:32:19,211
It's amazing.

5580
02:32:19,211 --> 02:32:20,260
And this nick paste kid,

5581
02:32:20,680 --> 02:32:24,310
it's like they were one of
the few like big name schools.

5582
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:28,120
That was a whole chain that
became like a real legit gym.

5583
02:32:28,270 --> 02:32:29,103
That's cool.

5584
02:32:29,610 --> 02:32:33,730
Karate chain number one karate chain.

5585
02:32:33,731 --> 02:32:34,810
Maybe there's others that did it.

5586
02:32:34,811 --> 02:32:35,411
I'm sure there are.

5587
02:32:35,411 --> 02:32:40,411
But Tiger shellmans was a
straight dominant karate
chain and when they saw the

5588
02:32:42,040 --> 02:32:42,873
unfold,

5589
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:43,960
they were like,

5590
02:32:43,960 --> 02:32:44,291
okay,

5591
02:32:44,291 --> 02:32:45,124
we adopt,

5592
02:32:46,060 --> 02:32:46,900
we need some of that.

5593
02:32:46,901 --> 02:32:47,950
We need someone that's a tiger.

5594
02:32:47,951 --> 02:32:49,660
Schellman is uh,

5595
02:32:49,690 --> 02:32:51,250
openminded modern.

5596
02:32:51,540 --> 02:32:52,373
Another way to look at it.

5597
02:32:53,020 --> 02:32:55,310
Do you want me to look at as you have
it that big of school and they're always

5598
02:32:55,311 --> 02:32:57,290
going to be some superstars
who are going to come through.

5599
02:32:57,320 --> 02:32:57,471
No,

5600
02:32:57,471 --> 02:32:57,581
no,

5601
02:32:57,581 --> 02:32:57,760
no.

5602
02:32:57,760 --> 02:32:57,890
It's,

5603
02:32:57,890 --> 02:32:59,000
their training is really good.

5604
02:32:59,030 --> 02:33:03,350
It's not just that would most
other marsh martial arts,

5605
02:33:03,380 --> 02:33:06,530
most of the traditional martial
arts associations didn't evolve.

5606
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:08,480
Tiger shellmans was all about evolution.

5607
02:33:08,750 --> 02:33:09,440
Most,

5608
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:14,440
most Roy one traditional martial arts
associations are not into evolving because

5609
02:33:17,060 --> 02:33:18,050
the people at the top,

5610
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:21,830
they're fucking lazy and cause they
would have to learn all this new shit.

5611
02:33:22,300 --> 02:33:23,090
You don't want to do it.

5612
02:33:23,090 --> 02:33:23,691
Who does this?

5613
02:33:23,691 --> 02:33:25,180
Who gets on top of a top rope,

5614
02:33:25,181 --> 02:33:26,420
pulls his shirt up and rubs his,

5615
02:33:26,421 --> 02:33:27,254
the homer Simpson

5616
02:33:28,790 --> 02:33:29,960
tough after a decision.

5617
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:30,751
Steep Amy.

5618
02:33:30,751 --> 02:33:30,840
Oh,

5619
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:31,481
choose the bay.

5620
02:33:31,481 --> 02:33:32,960
Got that new girl.

5621
02:33:32,990 --> 02:33:33,231
Hey,

5622
02:33:33,231 --> 02:33:34,940
easy dude.

5623
02:33:35,270 --> 02:33:35,550
Got,

5624
02:33:35,550 --> 02:33:35,991
damn it.

5625
02:33:35,991 --> 02:33:36,860
It's the wine.

5626
02:33:39,670 --> 02:33:40,503
He's a handsome guy.

5627
02:33:40,700 --> 02:33:42,110
I got Steve Bay is a very handsome

5628
02:33:43,750 --> 02:33:44,120
man.

5629
02:33:44,120 --> 02:33:47,690
[inaudible] minutes on Allen Gabon.

5630
02:33:47,720 --> 02:33:49,400
And you're going to talk
about Steve as a handsome,

5631
02:33:49,770 --> 02:33:50,570
handsome.

5632
02:33:50,570 --> 02:33:52,130
Let's be honest.

5633
02:33:52,131 --> 02:33:52,671
And this is,

5634
02:33:52,671 --> 02:33:53,420
uh,

5635
02:33:53,420 --> 02:33:57,140
this is one of the least heavy
fight companions ever after.

5636
02:33:57,180 --> 02:34:02,180
We've barely pay attention as I tried
to play bigger than does this the gayest

5637
02:34:02,721 --> 02:34:03,554
one?

5638
02:34:04,220 --> 02:34:07,280
Never Brian's here.

5639
02:34:07,281 --> 02:34:08,550
It gets somewhat,

5640
02:34:08,890 --> 02:34:09,650
I can't help it.

5641
02:34:09,650 --> 02:34:11,840
The dream about your
boyfriend can hear that

5642
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:16,460
it was that the only job?

5643
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:18,040
He's the only one so

5644
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:18,221
far.

5645
02:34:18,221 --> 02:34:19,054
The only dream.

5646
02:34:19,660 --> 02:34:20,860
I can't wait for Connor dos.

5647
02:34:20,861 --> 02:34:22,890
Anjos what do you think
God is bigger than dos?

5648
02:34:22,891 --> 02:34:23,724
Anjos how about that?

5649
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:25,590
How about percents?

5650
02:34:27,100 --> 02:34:27,933
What's up with that?

5651
02:34:28,020 --> 02:34:28,853
They say that.

5652
02:34:29,290 --> 02:34:29,411
Oh,

5653
02:34:29,411 --> 02:34:29,830
he didn't.

5654
02:34:29,830 --> 02:34:30,680
No we didn't.

5655
02:34:30,810 --> 02:34:31,151
Okay.

5656
02:34:31,151 --> 02:34:33,330
Cause that's what it says time.

5657
02:34:33,740 --> 02:34:34,390
I have a hard time.

5658
02:34:34,390 --> 02:34:34,781
I think he,

5659
02:34:34,781 --> 02:34:35,321
what he said was,

5660
02:34:35,321 --> 02:34:37,300
I have a hard time seeing
Connor win this fight.

5661
02:34:37,330 --> 02:34:38,170
I'm paraphrasing.

5662
02:34:38,280 --> 02:34:38,950
He's like,

5663
02:34:38,950 --> 02:34:39,761
he's being honest.

5664
02:34:39,761 --> 02:34:40,594
He's being honored.

5665
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:41,970
It's called honey.

5666
02:34:41,970 --> 02:34:42,760
What did I say?

5667
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:43,593
It's called honey.

5668
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:45,460
Listen man.

5669
02:34:45,460 --> 02:34:48,040
You cannot neglect the skills of dos.

5670
02:34:48,041 --> 02:34:48,730
Anjos yeah,

5671
02:34:48,730 --> 02:34:50,140
it's a tough fight.

5672
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:50,950
I,

5673
02:34:50,950 --> 02:34:52,310
when I look at dose on Joe's,

5674
02:34:52,360 --> 02:34:54,490
I look at a fucking beast,

5675
02:34:54,491 --> 02:34:55,270
man.

5676
02:34:55,270 --> 02:34:57,250
The way he put away Benson Henderson,

5677
02:34:57,280 --> 02:35:00,970
the way he put away Donaldson Roney
the way he beat the fuck out of Sergio

5678
02:35:00,970 --> 02:35:01,661
Pettis or excuse me,

5679
02:35:01,661 --> 02:35:02,494
Anthony Pettis.

5680
02:35:02,860 --> 02:35:03,880
He's something special,

5681
02:35:03,881 --> 02:35:04,270
man.

5682
02:35:04,270 --> 02:35:04,571
Dude,

5683
02:35:04,571 --> 02:35:06,270
I can't think of a worst
matchup for comment,

5684
02:35:06,271 --> 02:35:06,970
but comments.

5685
02:35:06,970 --> 02:35:07,920
We've talked to colors.

5686
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:09,670
He thinks that it's a legit,

5687
02:35:09,700 --> 02:35:10,300
he goes,

5688
02:35:10,300 --> 02:35:10,511
ah,

5689
02:35:10,511 --> 02:35:11,510
he's just like Josie Aldo,

5690
02:35:11,511 --> 02:35:12,430
but shittier version.

5691
02:35:12,580 --> 02:35:14,860
Do you think he's really trying
to start his own promotion?

5692
02:35:14,890 --> 02:35:16,000
Do you think that's legit?

5693
02:35:16,001 --> 02:35:16,500
That's,

5694
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:17,220
that's bullshit.

5695
02:35:17,220 --> 02:35:18,053
Get

5696
02:35:20,110 --> 02:35:21,070
restless real.

5697
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:21,671
I think so.

5698
02:35:21,671 --> 02:35:22,420
Here's the power.

5699
02:35:22,420 --> 02:35:23,800
He's actually saying,

5700
02:35:24,250 --> 02:35:26,320
did he actually say he's going
to start its own promotion?

5701
02:35:26,500 --> 02:35:26,861
Listen,

5702
02:35:26,861 --> 02:35:27,690
man,

5703
02:35:27,690 --> 02:35:28,780
if I was Conor Mcgregor,

5704
02:35:28,781 --> 02:35:29,860
why would I work for the UFC?

5705
02:35:29,861 --> 02:35:31,300
After awhile I would go,

5706
02:35:31,301 --> 02:35:32,860
I'm just going to do
the Conor McGregor show.

5707
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:34,650
Take that shit in the road
with all the best comments.

5708
02:35:34,740 --> 02:35:35,573
Real,

5709
02:35:36,720 --> 02:35:37,150
real.

5710
02:35:37,150 --> 02:35:37,961
I wouldn't guys know.

5711
02:35:37,961 --> 02:35:38,530
I don't know.

5712
02:35:38,530 --> 02:35:42,280
I would imagine if Conor McGregor has
a contract that would allow him at a

5713
02:35:42,281 --> 02:35:44,320
certain time to no longer be with the UFC,

5714
02:35:44,500 --> 02:35:46,600
he could do whatever the fuck
he can take the spar with him,

5715
02:35:46,780 --> 02:35:47,950
but here's the question.

5716
02:35:48,190 --> 02:35:49,023
Why would he,

5717
02:35:49,090 --> 02:35:49,571
why would,

5718
02:35:49,571 --> 02:35:50,200
there you go.

5719
02:35:50,200 --> 02:35:51,930
It's those last two
fights on that main event.

5720
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:53,433
Ghost him.

5721
02:35:53,650 --> 02:35:57,210
What would you say that command Nunez is?

5722
02:35:57,220 --> 02:35:57,910
No girl.

5723
02:35:57,910 --> 02:35:59,110
Let's not talk about that right now.

5724
02:35:59,130 --> 02:36:00,360
Let's let's what?

5725
02:36:00,620 --> 02:36:04,360
What I'm saying about Connor is that
Connor is a fucking legit superstar,

5726
02:36:04,361 --> 02:36:06,010
but the UFC made him a superstar.

5727
02:36:06,370 --> 02:36:08,440
Like the UFC is the perfect vehicle.

5728
02:36:08,590 --> 02:36:09,610
They've got everything down.

5729
02:36:09,700 --> 02:36:10,660
The promotion,

5730
02:36:10,810 --> 02:36:11,643
the management,

5731
02:36:11,710 --> 02:36:12,910
the way it's all set up.

5732
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:14,860
The way the fuck the
marketing is on point.

5733
02:36:14,861 --> 02:36:15,970
It's on another level.

5734
02:36:15,971 --> 02:36:17,830
If you go to some other organization,

5735
02:36:18,130 --> 02:36:20,650
good luck running a smooth ship.

5736
02:36:20,890 --> 02:36:22,330
What happened to affliction?

5737
02:36:22,450 --> 02:36:23,590
What happened to elite x,

5738
02:36:23,591 --> 02:36:23,950
Z,

5739
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:26,950
what happened and strife for bottom line.

5740
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:29,260
The bottom line is Grier calm.

5741
02:36:29,290 --> 02:36:33,820
Conor McGregor would be unknown to the
world and Ireland training in a boxing

5742
02:36:33,821 --> 02:36:34,390
gym.

5743
02:36:34,390 --> 02:36:37,420
If it wasn't for the u s 100%
of remember that she ever sent,

5744
02:36:37,480 --> 02:36:39,370
he's got the UFC made him famous.

5745
02:36:39,420 --> 02:36:39,520
Oh,

5746
02:36:39,520 --> 02:36:41,470
green [inaudible] deserves the money.

5747
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:43,330
It was a cooperative venture.

5748
02:36:43,360 --> 02:36:44,800
There's no either or.

5749
02:36:44,801 --> 02:36:46,630
They're not mutually exclusive in their,

5750
02:36:46,631 --> 02:36:46,931
their,

5751
02:36:46,931 --> 02:36:48,190
their amount of success.

5752
02:36:48,460 --> 02:36:50,080
That was dependent upon their actions.

5753
02:36:50,081 --> 02:36:51,730
They both benefit from no,

5754
02:36:51,731 --> 02:36:51,881
no,

5755
02:36:51,881 --> 02:36:52,390
but no.

5756
02:36:52,390 --> 02:36:53,440
Make no mistake about it.

5757
02:36:53,470 --> 02:36:54,011
The UFC,

5758
02:36:54,011 --> 02:36:54,940
would it always be big?

5759
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:55,430
Yes,

5760
02:36:55,430 --> 02:36:56,410
but always be big.

5761
02:36:56,440 --> 02:36:57,790
If there was never a Connor,

5762
02:36:57,880 --> 02:36:59,440
the UFC would be just as been,

5763
02:36:59,500 --> 02:37:01,660
but never as big as with a guy like that.

5764
02:37:01,810 --> 02:37:03,910
If you want to be as
big as what that guy is,

5765
02:37:03,911 --> 02:37:04,920
you need econom McGregor.

5766
02:37:04,930 --> 02:37:05,920
So the only way it happened,

5767
02:37:05,921 --> 02:37:06,910
no doubt about it.

5768
02:37:06,970 --> 02:37:07,540
Or Rodney?

5769
02:37:07,540 --> 02:37:08,200
Always.

5770
02:37:08,200 --> 02:37:09,033
Always.

5771
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:10,420
Yeah.

5772
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:14,020
I've always been fascinated with Connor.

5773
02:37:14,050 --> 02:37:15,070
Maybe GSP today,

5774
02:37:15,110 --> 02:37:16,010
maybe GSP today.

5775
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:19,550
Why would he says I think the UFC
today is bigger than it's ever been.

5776
02:37:19,570 --> 02:37:22,220
I think she has a young GSP today.

5777
02:37:22,221 --> 02:37:23,120
If he was a champion,

5778
02:37:23,720 --> 02:37:24,290
goddammit,

5779
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:24,951
girls would be there.

5780
02:37:24,951 --> 02:37:29,150
They're fucking damp panties would
be filling up 100,000 seat arenas.

5781
02:37:29,180 --> 02:37:29,750
Yeah,

5782
02:37:29,750 --> 02:37:30,583
he's a stud.

5783
02:37:31,420 --> 02:37:34,820
He's CSP was in his prime,

5784
02:37:34,850 --> 02:37:39,260
like when he was like when he beat Bj
Penn for defending his title when he was

5785
02:37:39,261 --> 02:37:40,130
in his prime.

5786
02:37:40,280 --> 02:37:40,791
If Bj,

5787
02:37:40,791 --> 02:37:41,750
if the UFC was,

5788
02:37:41,810 --> 02:37:43,880
I think the UFC is probably,

5789
02:37:43,881 --> 02:37:46,820
I mean I don't know how many more
people watch it now than then,

5790
02:37:46,940 --> 02:37:48,710
but as far as like being well known,

5791
02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:49,850
it's way more well known.

5792
02:37:49,910 --> 02:37:51,140
I agree way more.

5793
02:37:51,530 --> 02:37:53,390
What about Bj Penn coming back?

5794
02:37:53,391 --> 02:37:54,260
What the fuck?

5795
02:37:54,261 --> 02:37:54,920
Amazing.

5796
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:55,641
That's crazy.

5797
02:37:55,641 --> 02:37:55,791
Right?

5798
02:37:55,791 --> 02:37:56,624
Part of me.

5799
02:37:56,900 --> 02:37:58,400
He went to fucking Greg Jackson.

5800
02:37:58,410 --> 02:37:59,243
God,

5801
02:37:59,510 --> 02:38:00,530
he thought about it.

5802
02:38:00,620 --> 02:38:05,090
He's sitting there and fucking on Hilo
chill on the volcanoes outside the

5803
02:38:05,091 --> 02:38:05,960
fucking window.

5804
02:38:06,050 --> 02:38:07,640
He thought about it and he knew it.

5805
02:38:07,670 --> 02:38:08,570
He came back.

5806
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:09,680
What did he fucking do?

5807
02:38:09,770 --> 02:38:11,300
He goes to Greg Jackson.

5808
02:38:11,660 --> 02:38:11,931
I mean,

5809
02:38:11,931 --> 02:38:13,610
he did the best fucking thing possible.

5810
02:38:13,700 --> 02:38:13,941
I mean,

5811
02:38:13,941 --> 02:38:15,010
he could have went to Aka can.

5812
02:38:15,011 --> 02:38:15,420
I went to trial.

5813
02:38:15,420 --> 02:38:16,500
Tracy has a fight attention,

5814
02:38:16,820 --> 02:38:17,653
but

5815
02:38:18,850 --> 02:38:21,860
he decided to go to the one
of the top fucking schools.

5816
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:24,230
But Jackson is not a bad goddamn choice.

5817
02:38:24,231 --> 02:38:25,064
The best choice.

5818
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:25,460
Well,

5819
02:38:25,460 --> 02:38:27,560
it's one of like five best choices.

5820
02:38:27,890 --> 02:38:28,371
Eric Holt,

5821
02:38:28,371 --> 02:38:30,110
Delfi Arrow down in the lions.

5822
02:38:30,140 --> 02:38:33,830
That's a best choice
you've got for Rasa Hobby,

5823
02:38:33,831 --> 02:38:35,480
who is probably my first choice,

5824
02:38:35,481 --> 02:38:39,200
or one of them would be my number one
him or least her bowling as a striking

5825
02:38:39,201 --> 02:38:39,471
coach.

5826
02:38:39,471 --> 02:38:44,471
You mean everything coach
or a mastermind mastermind

5827
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:47,660
though I think.

5828
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:51,200
I think that working number
one mighty mouse is coach,

5829
02:38:52,300 --> 02:38:53,133
so you're right.

5830
02:38:53,710 --> 02:38:54,560
I'm mad human.

5831
02:38:54,561 --> 02:38:54,891
For us,

5832
02:38:54,891 --> 02:38:56,330
a hobby to me are commensurate.

5833
02:38:56,660 --> 02:38:58,040
I think they're exactly the same level.

5834
02:38:58,070 --> 02:38:59,090
They're both wizards.

5835
02:38:59,350 --> 02:39:00,620
I was talking about those guys.

5836
02:39:00,650 --> 02:39:01,483
They're masters.

5837
02:39:01,610 --> 02:39:04,730
Matt Hume had more MMA
fights I think for us.

5838
02:39:04,740 --> 02:39:05,100
Had some,

5839
02:39:05,100 --> 02:39:06,260
a lot of kickboxing fights.

5840
02:39:06,500 --> 02:39:10,250
But for us it's like nasty on the ground
and he's a super genius when it comes

5841
02:39:10,251 --> 02:39:11,510
to like his analytical mind,

5842
02:39:11,511 --> 02:39:12,500
the way it breaks down fights.

5843
02:39:12,501 --> 02:39:15,470
He breaks down street fights cause
youtube videos where he breaks down.

5844
02:39:15,490 --> 02:39:15,650
Yeah,

5845
02:39:15,650 --> 02:39:18,200
it breaks down how this guy came
out of guy and he got cracked.

5846
02:39:18,201 --> 02:39:19,940
This guy with a left hook
and he explains the footwork,

5847
02:39:20,060 --> 02:39:21,140
draws it in a diagram.

5848
02:39:21,141 --> 02:39:24,140
He's also a young smart as fuck.

5849
02:39:24,650 --> 02:39:25,970
He's younger and he's been through it.

5850
02:39:25,971 --> 02:39:27,260
Like he came up with everyone.

5851
02:39:27,400 --> 02:39:29,090
It was the coolest fucking thing he did.

5852
02:39:29,210 --> 02:39:34,210
He just put out a video or he's testing
guard work and ground and pound on

5853
02:39:34,851 --> 02:39:35,150
guards.

5854
02:39:35,150 --> 02:39:37,160
What guard works best for granted.

5855
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:38,930
He did this shit.

5856
02:39:38,931 --> 02:39:40,100
He put it on Youtube,

5857
02:39:40,220 --> 02:39:41,030
he put it up.

5858
02:39:41,030 --> 02:39:42,230
So he had him,

5859
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:43,333
him,

5860
02:39:43,580 --> 02:39:46,430
Gary Tilden and I think Gordon Ryan,

5861
02:39:46,580 --> 02:39:48,860
they had like some dude jumped with,

5862
02:39:48,861 --> 02:39:49,940
with boxing gloves,

5863
02:39:49,960 --> 02:39:52,010
jump in the Gar and start pounding them.

5864
02:39:52,390 --> 02:39:52,721
And,

5865
02:39:52,721 --> 02:39:53,480
uh,

5866
02:39:53,480 --> 02:39:54,530
and in the video,

5867
02:39:54,680 --> 02:39:55,760
the guys on the bottom,

5868
02:39:55,790 --> 02:39:58,490
whether it was for Gary telling
him or I think it was Gordon,

5869
02:39:58,491 --> 02:40:00,080
I don't fucking know that third guy was,

5870
02:40:00,550 --> 02:40:01,310
uh,

5871
02:40:01,310 --> 02:40:04,000
but they were just wrecking
the guy on top of leg locks.

5872
02:40:04,430 --> 02:40:04,970
Uh,

5873
02:40:04,970 --> 02:40:05,870
a bunch of different things.

5874
02:40:06,050 --> 02:40:10,640
It was like a revolutionary
experimentation.

5875
02:40:11,030 --> 02:40:11,360
Uh,

5876
02:40:11,360 --> 02:40:13,560
one of the smartest
things you could ever do.

5877
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:16,200
The only thing I think version two,

5878
02:40:16,710 --> 02:40:17,431
he needs to,

5879
02:40:17,431 --> 02:40:19,230
I think we should add,

5880
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:19,980
uh,

5881
02:40:19,980 --> 02:40:22,450
there's different scenarios
and ground and pound,

5882
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:23,310
it's not always,

5883
02:40:23,310 --> 02:40:25,170
it's not always the same ground and pound.

5884
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:26,940
Sometimes the guys on top,

5885
02:40:27,330 --> 02:40:29,490
he doesn't want even be on the ground.

5886
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:31,440
So if you're not holding
him on the ground,

5887
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:33,120
he's going to stand up and back out.

5888
02:40:33,240 --> 02:40:34,530
You have to have that,

5889
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:36,210
that scenario to what happens.

5890
02:40:36,211 --> 02:40:38,460
And that's what God is best for.

5891
02:40:38,461 --> 02:40:40,260
A guy that's on top.

5892
02:40:40,261 --> 02:40:41,070
And your guard,

5893
02:40:41,070 --> 02:40:43,350
you must have pulled guard because
he didn't try to take you down.

5894
02:40:43,410 --> 02:40:44,520
He wants to stay on to sleep.

5895
02:40:44,550 --> 02:40:45,960
So as soon as you open your guard,

5896
02:40:45,961 --> 02:40:47,310
he's going to back out and he's gone.

5897
02:40:47,430 --> 02:40:50,370
So what guard is best for that scenario?

5898
02:40:50,490 --> 02:40:51,740
And there's another scenario also,

5899
02:40:51,741 --> 02:40:54,300
you have the scenario where
the guy is getting beat.

5900
02:40:54,301 --> 02:40:56,520
Your opponent is getting
beat up on his feet.

5901
02:40:56,670 --> 02:41:01,670
So he's taking you down at will and you
have to deal with the guy who's trying

5902
02:41:01,981 --> 02:41:03,600
not to let you stand up.

5903
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:08,750
So I think a version two of those ground
and pound experimentation to figure out

5904
02:41:10,621 --> 02:41:11,550
what's the best guard.

5905
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,340
I think that's my 2 cents.

5906
02:41:14,460 --> 02:41:15,630
But what the fuck do I know?

5907
02:41:15,631 --> 02:41:16,230
I don't know.

5908
02:41:16,230 --> 02:41:21,060
But the fact that for Ross actually did
that it he's already experimenting on

5909
02:41:21,061 --> 02:41:23,850
what is the best guard
for ground and pound.

5910
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:24,630
That's brilliant.

5911
02:41:24,630 --> 02:41:25,463
I love it

5912
02:41:25,940 --> 02:41:29,100
for m and an MMA that says Nma,

5913
02:41:29,550 --> 02:41:31,320
he makes his UFC debut,

5914
02:41:31,560 --> 02:41:34,290
but I could've sworn and he's
trying to bet on this main event.

5915
02:41:34,291 --> 02:41:35,124
Son.

5916
02:41:35,790 --> 02:41:36,330
I'm trying to,

5917
02:41:36,330 --> 02:41:36,970
I'm trying to,

5918
02:41:36,970 --> 02:41:37,440
uh,

5919
02:41:37,440 --> 02:41:38,340
you want to break down the garden?

5920
02:41:38,400 --> 02:41:39,181
You make a good point,

5921
02:41:39,181 --> 02:41:39,391
Eddie.

5922
02:41:39,391 --> 02:41:40,440
And you know one another good point.

5923
02:41:40,441 --> 02:41:44,220
Ryan Callahan talked about for Breeshia
over dooms guard and he was like none of

5924
02:41:44,221 --> 02:41:46,110
our ground and pound worked
on them with King Mo,

5925
02:41:46,140 --> 02:41:49,440
who's a nasty wrestler
king most like world class.

5926
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:54,680
We need more of those films that we
need honestly on a consistent basis.

5927
02:41:55,090 --> 02:41:55,771
Here's the thing though,

5928
02:41:55,771 --> 02:41:56,041
Eddie,

5929
02:41:56,041 --> 02:41:58,080
I think there's only like
five guys who can do that.

5930
02:41:58,110 --> 02:41:59,090
I mean that's one of,

5931
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:01,770
that's how high in regard
I hold for us to hobby

5932
02:42:03,330 --> 02:42:04,110
ridiculous.

5933
02:42:04,110 --> 02:42:06,330
He's just a real martial arts wizard.

5934
02:42:07,470 --> 02:42:08,940
Super Smart Guy.

5935
02:42:09,930 --> 02:42:11,580
You're talked to him and
have conversations with them.

5936
02:42:13,620 --> 02:42:15,000
Tell me what that slide.

5937
02:42:15,380 --> 02:42:16,340
It's a,

5938
02:42:16,420 --> 02:42:19,350
he honestly set the blueprint
for everyone in Denver.

5939
02:42:19,351 --> 02:42:20,280
Like Shane Carwyn,

5940
02:42:20,281 --> 02:42:20,821
myself,

5941
02:42:20,821 --> 02:42:23,250
Nate Marquardt in the blueprint for GSP.

5942
02:42:23,251 --> 02:42:25,080
He had them do an all
this different stuff.

5943
02:42:25,210 --> 02:42:26,060
A lot of genius.

5944
02:42:26,450 --> 02:42:27,283
Like what kind of Shit?

5945
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:28,560
Like walking on logs.

5946
02:42:29,160 --> 02:42:29,461
No.

5947
02:42:29,461 --> 02:42:31,410
Does he know that shit

5948
02:42:32,940 --> 02:42:34,500
playing when I was a kid,

5949
02:42:34,560 --> 02:42:34,891
you know,

5950
02:42:34,891 --> 02:42:35,850
aligning with rocks.

5951
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,680
A lot of the drilling a lot.

5952
02:42:37,681 --> 02:42:41,070
He would have George drill a ton more
than we would drill instead of just

5953
02:42:41,071 --> 02:42:41,904
sparring.

5954
02:42:42,030 --> 02:42:45,510
No drilling a on the pads
and shit to movement started.

5955
02:42:45,511 --> 02:42:47,220
Worst case scenario where
we weren't doing that,

5956
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:49,080
he's a legit genius.

5957
02:42:49,110 --> 02:42:51,540
I think that's one of the biggest
mistakes that people make is too much

5958
02:42:51,541 --> 02:42:52,021
sparring.

5959
02:42:52,021 --> 02:42:52,960
Even in Jujitsu,

5960
02:42:52,980 --> 02:42:56,220
I was talking to a buddy of mine who's
a purple belt about this and he's like,

5961
02:42:56,221 --> 02:42:59,970
he hurt his hip and he had to get
a hip replacement surgery and uh,

5962
02:42:59,971 --> 02:43:00,241
you know,

5963
02:43:00,241 --> 02:43:01,110
he's like rh,

5964
02:43:01,290 --> 02:43:03,510
he's like in his late forties and he,

5965
02:43:03,570 --> 02:43:07,320
and he's a very successful businessman
and he went from there to going back to

5966
02:43:07,321 --> 02:43:07,920
training again.

5967
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:09,510
But once he healed up,

5968
02:43:09,660 --> 02:43:11,470
he's doing like drills and he's like,

5969
02:43:11,471 --> 02:43:11,681
man,

5970
02:43:11,681 --> 02:43:12,141
I'm telling you,

5971
02:43:12,141 --> 02:43:13,390
you just from doing all these drills,

5972
02:43:13,420 --> 02:43:14,740
my Jujitsu has gotten much,

5973
02:43:14,741 --> 02:43:17,380
much better because now he's constantly,

5974
02:43:17,470 --> 02:43:21,170
constantly improving upon
his data patterns pattern.

5975
02:43:21,180 --> 02:43:21,530
Yes.

5976
02:43:21,530 --> 02:43:21,750
Yes.

5977
02:43:21,750 --> 02:43:25,780
Really the only pattern chunking you
were talking about Henner like a good

5978
02:43:25,781 --> 02:43:28,420
Henner Gracie is like pattern
chunking this whole life.

5979
02:43:28,421 --> 02:43:30,370
He just understands that way.

5980
02:43:30,380 --> 02:43:34,140
Pal boxing the patterns and mixing
them all up and it shows taekwondo.

5981
02:43:34,141 --> 02:43:35,950
So get John Hendricks body,

5982
02:43:36,010 --> 02:43:36,843
he looks fit

5983
02:43:38,590 --> 02:43:38,831
now.

5984
02:43:38,831 --> 02:43:40,660
Johnny Annex beat Tyron Woodley.

5985
02:43:40,730 --> 02:43:41,350
What do you say?

5986
02:43:41,350 --> 02:43:42,183
NCAA.

5987
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:43,233
How's he look?

5988
02:43:43,660 --> 02:43:44,890
Johnny Hendricks looks amazing.

5989
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:45,491
It looks slim,

5990
02:43:45,491 --> 02:43:45,730
right?

5991
02:43:45,730 --> 02:43:46,120
Yes.

5992
02:43:46,120 --> 02:43:49,120
He doesn't look a at all like he
hadn't any sort of a weight problem is

5993
02:43:49,121 --> 02:43:50,230
underweight this morning.

5994
02:43:50,260 --> 02:43:51,011
Or when they weighed in,

5995
02:43:51,011 --> 02:43:52,090
he was underweight the morning.

5996
02:43:52,091 --> 02:43:53,170
That's the French guy.

5997
02:43:53,290 --> 02:43:54,160
This motherfucker,

5998
02:43:54,161 --> 02:43:54,910
Woo.

5999
02:43:54,910 --> 02:43:55,511
What's his name?

6000
02:43:55,511 --> 02:43:58,400
Francis spins make that larger and go,

6001
02:43:58,450 --> 02:43:59,283
no,

6002
02:43:59,350 --> 02:44:00,130
no man.

6003
02:44:00,130 --> 02:44:00,963
He's a beast.

6004
02:44:00,970 --> 02:44:02,500
He's got some serious power.

6005
02:44:02,570 --> 02:44:03,220
Yeah.

6006
02:44:03,220 --> 02:44:04,750
And a good defense on the ground too.

6007
02:44:04,751 --> 02:44:05,850
When he got taken down,

6008
02:44:05,860 --> 02:44:07,030
the dude didn't do shit to them.

6009
02:44:07,050 --> 02:44:07,691
You may be friends,

6010
02:44:07,691 --> 02:44:08,890
but he's west African sir.

6011
02:44:08,950 --> 02:44:09,221
Oh,

6012
02:44:09,221 --> 02:44:10,300
for Shoah.

6013
02:44:10,660 --> 02:44:12,410
He's gigantic to stop doing that.

6014
02:44:13,050 --> 02:44:13,580
And I was,

6015
02:44:13,580 --> 02:44:14,141
I was interviewed.

6016
02:44:14,141 --> 02:44:14,441
I'm like,

6017
02:44:14,441 --> 02:44:15,274
hi,

6018
02:44:16,320 --> 02:44:17,440
can I interview over here?

6019
02:44:17,530 --> 02:44:17,981
Like he,

6020
02:44:17,981 --> 02:44:22,050
I went to interview him and he
decided he wanted to walk away and go,

6021
02:44:22,051 --> 02:44:22,320
uh,

6022
02:44:22,320 --> 02:44:25,330
see how the guys feeling after
he beat the fuck out of him.

6023
02:44:25,570 --> 02:44:26,050
Come like,

6024
02:44:26,050 --> 02:44:26,883
I'm okay.

6025
02:44:26,920 --> 02:44:27,753
I'll just be over here.

6026
02:44:28,690 --> 02:44:29,710
You do your thing buddy.

6027
02:44:30,910 --> 02:44:31,900
What a man.

6028
02:44:32,230 --> 02:44:33,310
He fucked that dude up.

6029
02:44:33,311 --> 02:44:34,090
I don't know who the fuck you.

6030
02:44:34,090 --> 02:44:34,280
Fuck.

6031
02:44:34,280 --> 02:44:35,330
I got a tiny time.

6032
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:38,510
I don't know if the guy had
fought and I felt like the

6033
02:44:40,030 --> 02:44:42,220
look at Joe Silva book where
he comes up to these guys.

6034
02:44:42,220 --> 02:44:43,090
Oh my Lord.

6035
02:44:44,050 --> 02:44:45,150
But he holds their faith.

6036
02:44:45,250 --> 02:44:46,000
Listen,

6037
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:46,690
he holds there.

6038
02:44:46,690 --> 02:44:47,500
Joe Silva,

6039
02:44:47,500 --> 02:44:48,191
he's a great guy.

6040
02:44:48,191 --> 02:44:52,630
Just needs mushrooms in a
fucking reality check by shrubs.

6041
02:44:52,650 --> 02:44:54,460
Are you reality check Brendan?

6042
02:44:55,330 --> 02:44:56,163
I think an ass whooping.

6043
02:44:56,170 --> 02:44:56,970
I'm kind of saying,

6044
02:44:56,970 --> 02:44:57,250
oh,

6045
02:44:57,250 --> 02:44:57,881
how dare you.

6046
02:44:57,881 --> 02:44:59,470
It was an I like Joe Silva.

6047
02:44:59,471 --> 02:45:02,470
I have never had any ill
dealings with Joe Sova.

6048
02:45:02,590 --> 02:45:03,550
He is my friend.

6049
02:45:03,580 --> 02:45:05,110
I enjoy him as a human being.

6050
02:45:05,290 --> 02:45:08,620
I do not know what the fuck went
down with you and Joe Silva,

6051
02:45:08,830 --> 02:45:09,663
me,

6052
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:10,600
any fighter.

6053
02:45:10,600 --> 02:45:13,280
You bitches need to work that
shit out on your own bad.

6054
02:45:13,281 --> 02:45:13,431
No,

6055
02:45:13,431 --> 02:45:13,811
I'm good.

6056
02:45:13,811 --> 02:45:14,644
Now.

6057
02:45:15,930 --> 02:45:19,240
Up In another dimension.

6058
02:45:19,390 --> 02:45:22,510
You decide to come back and get a fucking
do it and you got to come back one

6059
02:45:22,511 --> 02:45:22,841
more time.

6060
02:45:22,841 --> 02:45:23,650
You're going to make a comeback.

6061
02:45:23,650 --> 02:45:26,740
What camp do you join and
what is your strategy?

6062
02:45:27,820 --> 02:45:30,130
It's hard to turn down muscle farm
with least her bowling right now,

6063
02:45:30,131 --> 02:45:31,300
but I'd probably go tristar.

6064
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:34,600
I like muscle farm for
a couple of reasons.

6065
02:45:34,601 --> 02:45:34,961
One.

6066
02:45:34,961 --> 02:45:36,550
It's a big new facility.

6067
02:45:36,551 --> 02:45:39,610
Everything's super state of the
art and it's got some momentum.

6068
02:45:39,611 --> 02:45:43,480
A lot of dudes are gravitating
towards their leaster Elliot Marshall,

6069
02:45:43,570 --> 02:45:43,901
you know,

6070
02:45:43,901 --> 02:45:45,970
Duane Ludwig is in cahoots.

6071
02:45:46,150 --> 02:45:46,391
You know,

6072
02:45:46,391 --> 02:45:48,580
there's a lot of other
really good striking coaches.

6073
02:45:48,581 --> 02:45:50,020
You've got Brandon Thatch,

6074
02:45:50,050 --> 02:45:52,640
you've got his click way to there
now and the way it's happening,

6075
02:45:54,680 --> 02:45:56,060
it's happening right?

6076
02:45:57,130 --> 02:45:58,720
The guy who's running it now,

6077
02:45:58,930 --> 02:46:00,800
he's a student of mine and he,

6078
02:46:00,900 --> 02:46:02,710
he always wanted to,

6079
02:46:03,130 --> 02:46:04,060
uh,

6080
02:46:04,090 --> 02:46:06,520
he was very successful in
the supplement industry,

6081
02:46:06,521 --> 02:46:06,941
very,

6082
02:46:06,941 --> 02:46:10,040
very successful and his
passion was to build an

6083
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:11,670
MMA two years ago,

6084
02:46:11,720 --> 02:46:12,291
years ago.

6085
02:46:12,291 --> 02:46:12,801
Here you go.

6086
02:46:12,801 --> 02:46:13,131
Here we go.

6087
02:46:13,131 --> 02:46:13,964
We got involved.

6088
02:46:14,370 --> 02:46:18,200
We had a fight with Danny Sanchez and
quite who ate it was the craziest part of

6089
02:46:18,201 --> 02:46:18,551
her plan.

6090
02:46:18,551 --> 02:46:19,030
Drinks,

6091
02:46:19,030 --> 02:46:22,310
Hendricks and Thompson is about to start
and we got to pay attention to this

6092
02:46:22,770 --> 02:46:23,300
shit.

6093
02:46:23,300 --> 02:46:24,260
This should support first of all,

6094
02:46:24,261 --> 02:46:24,680
Hendricks.

6095
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:25,130
You're right.

6096
02:46:25,130 --> 02:46:26,090
Any predictions?

6097
02:46:26,300 --> 02:46:27,440
Hendricks was fantastic.

6098
02:46:28,790 --> 02:46:31,060
I don't know how if one of always
got to solve that wrestling,

6099
02:46:31,061 --> 02:46:32,330
but he never looked like that.

6100
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:33,260
He looks so fit.

6101
02:46:33,290 --> 02:46:34,460
He's got to solve that wrestling.

6102
02:46:34,490 --> 02:46:34,581
Well,

6103
02:46:34,581 --> 02:46:36,380
he fucked up in the Tyron Woodley fight.

6104
02:46:36,381 --> 02:46:36,981
He didn't make weight.

6105
02:46:36,981 --> 02:46:38,630
Look at this fucking side stance.

6106
02:46:39,060 --> 02:46:40,970
Stance show unusual.

6107
02:46:40,971 --> 02:46:41,804
So epic,

6108
02:46:41,930 --> 02:46:46,520
and here's the thing about Stephen
Thompson is that he's been training a lot.

6109
02:46:48,170 --> 02:46:51,750
Wrestling has gotten a lot better and
he's not worried about being taken down.

6110
02:46:52,130 --> 02:46:54,410
He'll get taken down by Johnny Brian Hall.

6111
02:46:54,440 --> 02:46:55,520
He might get taken down,

6112
02:46:55,550 --> 02:47:00,300
but they might not with the
right hand caught Ncaa Chana.

6113
02:47:00,300 --> 02:47:01,100
It's hard to deal with it.

6114
02:47:01,100 --> 02:47:01,611
You're right.

6115
02:47:01,611 --> 02:47:02,301
It is hard to deal with.

6116
02:47:02,301 --> 02:47:05,270
You know what else had to deal
with 57 and o and kickboxing.

6117
02:47:05,640 --> 02:47:06,770
It's super hard to deal with.

6118
02:47:06,771 --> 02:47:07,041
Dude,

6119
02:47:07,041 --> 02:47:07,281
see,

6120
02:47:07,281 --> 02:47:08,530
I tried to Johnny's wrestling.

6121
02:47:08,531 --> 02:47:09,670
I tried hard Johnny's wrestling.

6122
02:47:09,740 --> 02:47:10,573
So tough

6123
02:47:13,370 --> 02:47:14,203
watching it.

6124
02:47:14,210 --> 02:47:15,260
Let's just watch it.

6125
02:47:15,310 --> 02:47:15,590
We were,

6126
02:47:15,590 --> 02:47:17,030
I know what the fuck is going to happen.

6127
02:47:17,100 --> 02:47:17,933
Talk.

6128
02:47:18,170 --> 02:47:19,080
You might be right,

6129
02:47:19,370 --> 02:47:19,701
but you're,

6130
02:47:19,701 --> 02:47:19,971
you're,

6131
02:47:19,971 --> 02:47:22,460
you're saying what's definitely
going to happen while it's happening.

6132
02:47:22,490 --> 02:47:24,000
That seems really ridiculous.

6133
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:25,010
Same probability.

6134
02:47:25,011 --> 02:47:25,431
The rest.

6135
02:47:25,431 --> 02:47:26,264
That's how I sound.

6136
02:47:26,630 --> 02:47:27,650
I sound like a wizard.

6137
02:47:28,960 --> 02:47:29,870
I'm a little psychic dude.

6138
02:47:30,410 --> 02:47:31,071
I see things.

6139
02:47:31,071 --> 02:47:31,641
I see things.

6140
02:47:31,641 --> 02:47:32,061
Exactly.

6141
02:47:32,061 --> 02:47:33,020
One second before that happened.

6142
02:47:33,170 --> 02:47:35,180
This is the worst kind of
commentary everyone was saying.

6143
02:47:35,450 --> 02:47:37,390
Imagine if we did
commentary like this sale.

6144
02:47:37,430 --> 02:47:40,730
Worse going to have
different shit is happening.

6145
02:47:42,100 --> 02:47:42,430
Yeah,

6146
02:47:42,430 --> 02:47:46,640
you got no dick tell he's not even taking
them down to tempted him right now.

6147
02:47:47,740 --> 02:47:48,350
Cool.

6148
02:47:48,350 --> 02:47:51,020
Countering countering counter counter.

6149
02:47:52,340 --> 02:47:53,173
A lot like mine,

6150
02:47:53,310 --> 02:47:54,143
like mine.

6151
02:47:54,360 --> 02:47:56,610
[inaudible]

6152
02:47:56,670 --> 02:47:58,190
to the face to telling you.

6153
02:47:58,460 --> 02:48:01,430
There's very few guys that could avoid
the take down like him and have these

6154
02:48:01,431 --> 02:48:02,264
kinds of skills.

6155
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:04,270
It's a completely different
kind of leg dexterity.

6156
02:48:04,590 --> 02:48:05,690
Nasty dude.

6157
02:48:05,691 --> 02:48:07,310
He used to fight in that Chuck Norris.

6158
02:48:07,530 --> 02:48:08,363
Oh,

6159
02:48:08,690 --> 02:48:10,160
Johnny Hendricks is in a world.

6160
02:48:11,330 --> 02:48:12,470
He's getting lit up.

6161
02:48:12,620 --> 02:48:16,100
He's getting lit up like Thomas Tryna
do some shit that Hendricks has not seen

6162
02:48:16,101 --> 02:48:16,910
before.

6163
02:48:16,910 --> 02:48:17,960
It's hard to get a sprite.

6164
02:48:18,170 --> 02:48:19,230
It's hard to get a sparring partner.

6165
02:48:19,240 --> 02:48:21,990
I'm going to find a guy like him now.

6166
02:48:23,950 --> 02:48:28,040
He is one of the elites in
American kickboxing freak.

6167
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:28,671
Look at him,

6168
02:48:28,671 --> 02:48:29,240
man.

6169
02:48:29,240 --> 02:48:30,650
He fights like a snake.

6170
02:48:30,710 --> 02:48:31,461
Oh sure.

6171
02:48:31,461 --> 02:48:33,080
To deal with so much taller,

6172
02:48:33,380 --> 02:48:33,950
tall.

6173
02:48:33,950 --> 02:48:35,690
It's not looking so much taller.

6174
02:48:36,480 --> 02:48:37,880
It depends on who you're looking for.

6175
02:48:37,881 --> 02:48:38,691
If you look at for Thompson,

6176
02:48:38,691 --> 02:48:39,620
it's looking excellent.

6177
02:48:39,740 --> 02:48:39,891
Yeah.

6178
02:48:39,891 --> 02:48:40,724
It's looking great.

6179
02:48:41,700 --> 02:48:45,320
Hundreds is isn't a bad situation.

6180
02:48:46,040 --> 02:48:48,110
Just trying to throw that
kick and he's getting caught.

6181
02:48:48,110 --> 02:48:48,890
He's getting timed.

6182
02:48:48,890 --> 02:48:50,270
He's in a terrible situation.

6183
02:48:50,271 --> 02:48:50,601
He says,

6184
02:48:50,601 --> 02:48:51,860
Rhonda Rousey Hall.

6185
02:48:51,861 --> 02:48:52,671
Look at the switch,

6186
02:48:52,671 --> 02:48:53,960
kick jumping,

6187
02:48:53,961 --> 02:48:54,381
switch,

6188
02:48:54,381 --> 02:48:56,300
kick jumps with the left
and kicks with the right,

6189
02:48:56,360 --> 02:48:57,410
right hand on the chin.

6190
02:48:57,440 --> 02:49:00,870
God Dog to lighten them up and no,

6191
02:49:00,950 --> 02:49:01,783
no relented.

6192
02:49:01,790 --> 02:49:02,840
How tough is Johnny Hendricks?

6193
02:49:02,841 --> 02:49:03,950
Doesn't even look like he's getting hurt.

6194
02:49:04,010 --> 02:49:05,150
He just keeps coming forward.

6195
02:49:05,151 --> 02:49:05,361
Look,

6196
02:49:05,361 --> 02:49:09,540
one wonder boy comes out
to do this to everybody.

6197
02:49:09,541 --> 02:49:10,290
How about that?

6198
02:49:10,290 --> 02:49:11,970
I've said that for a long time.

6199
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:13,290
I think he beats Robbie Lawler.

6200
02:49:13,360 --> 02:49:14,041
I'll call it now.

6201
02:49:14,041 --> 02:49:19,041
He's learning how to fucking fight
MMA the same at the same level that he

6202
02:49:19,771 --> 02:49:21,570
learned to be this elite kickboxer.

6203
02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:23,610
Did I wash them in that
Chuck Norris thing?

6204
02:49:23,730 --> 02:49:26,490
Remember the World Combat League
with graphite and that bowl?

6205
02:49:26,520 --> 02:49:27,353
He was

6206
02:49:30,110 --> 02:49:30,943
honest,

6207
02:49:30,980 --> 02:49:31,270
tough.

6208
02:49:31,270 --> 02:49:33,240
He thought I was a fan of that.

6209
02:49:33,241 --> 02:49:34,260
Chuck Norris kickbox.

6210
02:49:34,270 --> 02:49:35,103
He was the champion

6211
02:49:37,220 --> 02:49:37,620
guys.

6212
02:49:37,620 --> 02:49:38,071
Hey.

6213
02:49:38,071 --> 02:49:38,820
Oh my God.

6214
02:49:38,820 --> 02:49:40,110
It's one of the best guys in it.

6215
02:49:40,200 --> 02:49:41,100
Johnny's covering.

6216
02:49:41,101 --> 02:49:41,430
Well,

6217
02:49:41,430 --> 02:49:41,731
damn,

6218
02:49:41,731 --> 02:49:42,564
I didn't know that.

6219
02:49:43,920 --> 02:49:46,030
Caught with two

6220
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:54,390
zero zero crushing the head.

6221
02:49:54,391 --> 02:49:55,350
He's talking to him saying,

6222
02:49:55,620 --> 02:49:57,250
Oh God,

6223
02:49:59,100 --> 02:49:59,933
God,

6224
02:50:00,210 --> 02:50:01,043
God,

6225
02:50:02,720 --> 02:50:03,180
God,

6226
02:50:03,180 --> 02:50:04,080
title shot

6227
02:50:06,300 --> 02:50:08,130
saying it.

6228
02:50:08,190 --> 02:50:08,311
Oh,

6229
02:50:08,311 --> 02:50:08,701
look at this.

6230
02:50:08,701 --> 02:50:09,660
He can't even walk.

6231
02:50:09,690 --> 02:50:10,201
Oh no,

6232
02:50:10,201 --> 02:50:11,920
he's doing the karate
kid who he's married to.

6233
02:50:11,940 --> 02:50:12,773
We try to kid.

6234
02:50:16,390 --> 02:50:17,340
Oh my God.

6235
02:50:17,370 --> 02:50:18,330
He double got me.

6236
02:50:19,170 --> 02:50:19,940
Thought it was her.

6237
02:50:19,940 --> 02:50:22,380
Oh Shit Dude.

6238
02:50:22,381 --> 02:50:23,214
He fuck.

6239
02:50:25,380 --> 02:50:26,213
Fuck it.

6240
02:50:26,460 --> 02:50:26,910
Hey,

6241
02:50:26,910 --> 02:50:27,743
condom crown.

6242
02:50:28,580 --> 02:50:30,480
Here's his movement.

6243
02:50:30,481 --> 02:50:31,314
His karate,

6244
02:50:31,380 --> 02:50:33,250
he has minimal footwork.

6245
02:50:33,270 --> 02:50:35,220
Movement is just like
doing all those movements.

6246
02:50:35,221 --> 02:50:37,420
Drills with karate and you
see the way he does hips.

6247
02:50:37,620 --> 02:50:38,600
I guarantee McGregor.

6248
02:50:38,610 --> 02:50:40,270
We'll never say the 70 pound belt.

6249
02:50:40,271 --> 02:50:40,911
This is looking good to me.

6250
02:50:40,911 --> 02:50:41,700
I'll never say that.

6251
02:50:41,700 --> 02:50:43,210
You don't want to fight this guy

6252
02:50:45,660 --> 02:50:47,070
being precision.

6253
02:50:47,340 --> 02:50:48,670
Oh Man.

6254
02:50:49,680 --> 02:50:50,640
Appreciation though.

6255
02:50:50,641 --> 02:50:52,690
The precision knew it.

6256
02:50:52,980 --> 02:50:53,813
Bam,

6257
02:50:55,140 --> 02:50:55,441
Bam,

6258
02:50:55,441 --> 02:50:56,580
Bam or Johnny Man,

6259
02:50:56,600 --> 02:50:58,340
this the difference in the giant.

6260
02:50:59,070 --> 02:51:00,090
He nodded at him,

6261
02:51:00,091 --> 02:51:00,331
look at it.

6262
02:51:00,331 --> 02:51:00,601
It's no.

6263
02:51:00,601 --> 02:51:01,291
He nods at them.

6264
02:51:01,291 --> 02:51:01,561
He's like,

6265
02:51:01,561 --> 02:51:01,830
Yup,

6266
02:51:01,830 --> 02:51:02,940
you got blue dude.

6267
02:51:02,941 --> 02:51:06,630
He got lit up or take him down.

6268
02:51:06,660 --> 02:51:07,710
He couldn't get taken.

6269
02:51:07,711 --> 02:51:11,760
This is the former champion who's gone
through the best camp of his life.

6270
02:51:11,850 --> 02:51:13,650
He's in the best shape he's ever been.

6271
02:51:13,830 --> 02:51:14,491
He comes in,

6272
02:51:14,491 --> 02:51:16,890
they're motivated and he gets torn apart.

6273
02:51:17,620 --> 02:51:21,750
Title shot apart by a gene
has to be a title shot.

6274
02:51:21,880 --> 02:51:23,260
We were witnessing this,

6275
02:51:23,310 --> 02:51:24,160
those separately.

6276
02:51:24,400 --> 02:51:25,710
Fuck of evolution.

6277
02:51:25,711 --> 02:51:26,101
First of us,

6278
02:51:26,101 --> 02:51:26,910
I'm a cheetah,

6279
02:51:26,910 --> 02:51:28,140
but we needed another one.

6280
02:51:28,320 --> 02:51:29,340
We needed another one.

6281
02:51:29,341 --> 02:51:30,061
Machida was like,

6282
02:51:30,061 --> 02:51:30,391
okay,

6283
02:51:30,391 --> 02:51:31,171
it's a special one.

6284
02:51:31,171 --> 02:51:34,980
It's still not karate
now we see it for sure.

6285
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:35,671
The way,

6286
02:51:35,671 --> 02:51:36,504
listen

6287
02:51:38,730 --> 02:51:39,031
guys,

6288
02:51:39,031 --> 02:51:39,870
this is one round.

6289
02:51:39,871 --> 02:51:42,240
You can do Woodley in him
for the fucking title.

6290
02:51:42,400 --> 02:51:43,260
Hip Robbie Lawler.

6291
02:51:43,261 --> 02:51:46,830
A little bit of a break man through
a war with Carlos candidate karate.

6292
02:51:48,090 --> 02:51:53,090
Karate is are those
toxin Tom Lawler come on.

6293
02:51:53,491 --> 02:51:53,731
So on.

6294
02:51:53,731 --> 02:51:55,200
Wouldn't you want to see him?

6295
02:51:56,820 --> 02:51:58,020
I think that's what I'm saying.

6296
02:51:58,080 --> 02:51:59,850
It's hard to take
Woodley's title shot away.

6297
02:51:59,851 --> 02:52:00,684
It's very hard.

6298
02:52:01,390 --> 02:52:02,220
Yossi roles.

6299
02:52:02,220 --> 02:52:03,053
I do,

6300
02:52:03,060 --> 02:52:06,040
but I'm saying six in a
row in a sense of fairness.

6301
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:07,270
If we want to get a sense of fairness,

6302
02:52:07,390 --> 02:52:08,320
it's a very difficult,

6303
02:52:08,650 --> 02:52:10,060
he's going to out strike everybody,

6304
02:52:10,090 --> 02:52:10,870
but how would you,

6305
02:52:10,870 --> 02:52:12,580
how much would you like
to see him versus Damien?

6306
02:52:12,600 --> 02:52:13,433
My,

6307
02:52:13,790 --> 02:52:13,860
Oh,

6308
02:52:13,860 --> 02:52:15,690
he's going to strike everybody.

6309
02:52:15,860 --> 02:52:17,510
I'd like to see him fight.

6310
02:52:17,520 --> 02:52:18,750
Can't take him down.

6311
02:52:18,780 --> 02:52:19,613
I

6312
02:52:20,990 --> 02:52:22,690
wonder if he kicks Damien.

6313
02:52:22,740 --> 02:52:23,573
My

6314
02:52:26,850 --> 02:52:28,400
conduit would be fine.

6315
02:52:28,940 --> 02:52:29,310
No,

6316
02:52:29,310 --> 02:52:30,570
I've been predicting the rise,

6317
02:52:30,571 --> 02:52:31,750
the Wonderboy for awhile.

6318
02:52:31,790 --> 02:52:33,320
Karate had won that fight.

6319
02:52:33,380 --> 02:52:34,370
That's all one bad fight.

6320
02:52:34,371 --> 02:52:34,491
We,

6321
02:52:34,491 --> 02:52:37,640
he's over two years ago he was overtrained
against Matt Brown Brown and since

6322
02:52:37,641 --> 02:52:39,770
then he's been dominant and
getting better every time.

6323
02:52:39,771 --> 02:52:40,820
And he was smart.

6324
02:52:40,970 --> 02:52:44,990
He's a one second that he goes and trains
the 185 pound champion is one of the

6325
02:52:44,991 --> 02:52:46,610
grittiest fucking wrestlers in the game.

6326
02:52:46,611 --> 02:52:47,960
He goes for Weidman's camp.

6327
02:52:48,020 --> 02:52:50,720
Weidman's a bigger guy and
he learns how to survive.

6328
02:52:50,750 --> 02:52:50,901
Well,

6329
02:52:50,901 --> 02:52:51,680
people,

6330
02:52:51,680 --> 02:52:55,460
a lot of people don't know Stephen
Wonderboy Thompson got his start from GSP.

6331
02:52:55,461 --> 02:52:57,230
GSP was fighting.

6332
02:52:57,231 --> 02:52:58,250
Carlos condit brought,

6333
02:52:58,280 --> 02:52:59,120
want to bully in,

6334
02:52:59,150 --> 02:53:00,500
I don't know how they met,

6335
02:53:00,680 --> 02:53:02,520
brought him in and then uh,

6336
02:53:02,630 --> 02:53:05,120
he sent him to Denver to train with Nate,

6337
02:53:05,360 --> 02:53:06,193
myself,

6338
02:53:06,230 --> 02:53:06,921
all the guys.

6339
02:53:06,921 --> 02:53:09,650
And he was just fucking everybody up.

6340
02:53:09,770 --> 02:53:10,341
Meanwhile,

6341
02:53:10,341 --> 02:53:11,200
how about this speed?

6342
02:53:11,201 --> 02:53:11,481
This guy,

6343
02:53:11,481 --> 02:53:14,390
one of the most marketable guys ever.

6344
02:53:14,660 --> 02:53:16,040
The nicest guy.

6345
02:53:16,070 --> 02:53:20,750
So like legitimately the nicest
friendliest guy you'd ever want to meet.

6346
02:53:20,930 --> 02:53:23,900
Clean cut doesn't look like some murder.

6347
02:53:23,930 --> 02:53:25,340
I hope you have your book shot here.

6348
02:53:25,400 --> 02:53:25,550
Like,

6349
02:53:25,550 --> 02:53:26,383
look at him.

6350
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:28,250
He's going to thank God.

6351
02:53:29,210 --> 02:53:30,043
Thank God.

6352
02:53:32,390 --> 02:53:33,223
Hmm.

6353
02:53:35,380 --> 02:53:36,250
Jesus Christ.

6354
02:53:36,251 --> 02:53:37,084
His kid's good.

6355
02:53:38,380 --> 02:53:39,430
He's religious or something.

6356
02:53:40,180 --> 02:53:41,050
This guy came up to you,

6357
02:53:41,051 --> 02:53:41,801
had a club and said,

6358
02:53:41,801 --> 02:53:43,200
I used to fucking a bad ass strike.

6359
02:53:43,300 --> 02:53:43,840
I'm going to stop.

6360
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:45,340
I'm going to go to church
and get better at fighting.

6361
02:53:46,540 --> 02:53:47,650
We're trying to get into the cage.

6362
02:53:47,651 --> 02:53:49,330
He's his hands to set
it up for the take down.

6363
02:53:50,140 --> 02:53:51,730
This guy's a fucking listen patiently.

6364
02:53:51,750 --> 02:53:52,780
That front leg side kick,

6365
02:53:52,781 --> 02:53:53,410
dude.

6366
02:53:53,410 --> 02:53:56,500
You see the extension
fuck routes like mine?

6367
02:53:56,530 --> 02:53:57,010
Yeah.

6368
02:53:57,010 --> 02:53:59,900
Well be better if it wasn't lefthand

6369
02:54:03,400 --> 02:54:05,380
Colby like yours.

6370
02:54:06,420 --> 02:54:07,480
You shut the fuck up.

6371
02:54:10,870 --> 02:54:14,110
He's a sniper or how fucking sniper.

6372
02:54:14,111 --> 02:54:14,441
Look at that.

6373
02:54:14,441 --> 02:54:15,274
Right uppercut.

6374
02:54:15,340 --> 02:54:17,320
No one's ever be Johnny
Hendricks like that too.

6375
02:54:17,321 --> 02:54:17,861
Not like that.

6376
02:54:17,861 --> 02:54:18,191
Look at that.

6377
02:54:18,191 --> 02:54:19,820
Right kick to the body on the way out,

6378
02:54:19,821 --> 02:54:20,110
Johnny.

6379
02:54:20,110 --> 02:54:21,190
So fucking tough though.

6380
02:54:21,191 --> 02:54:22,024
He's so,

6381
02:54:22,420 --> 02:54:23,380
oh Jesus

6382
02:54:24,880 --> 02:54:25,070
will.

6383
02:54:25,070 --> 02:54:25,391
Come on,

6384
02:54:25,391 --> 02:54:25,970
man.

6385
02:54:25,970 --> 02:54:26,711
You got to give it up.

6386
02:54:26,711 --> 02:54:27,431
He's a genius.

6387
02:54:27,431 --> 02:54:28,264
He's amazing.

6388
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:29,711
Amazing.

6389
02:54:29,711 --> 02:54:31,540
Hashtag Callen called it.

6390
02:54:31,950 --> 02:54:32,560
That's the course.

6391
02:54:32,560 --> 02:54:33,410
I called it too.

6392
02:54:35,080 --> 02:54:36,730
I got my fucking barbell jeans on.

6393
02:54:37,570 --> 02:54:38,410
I will fight.

6394
02:54:40,220 --> 02:54:41,420
You were a genius tonight.

6395
02:54:42,770 --> 02:54:43,603
Every climb.

6396
02:54:44,550 --> 02:54:46,180
I was tired and I woke up.

6397
02:54:46,181 --> 02:54:47,014
He was writing

6398
02:54:49,860 --> 02:54:51,180
was on fire tonight.

6399
02:54:51,190 --> 02:54:51,430
Yeah.

6400
02:54:51,430 --> 02:54:52,330
You said he's a genius.

6401
02:54:52,331 --> 02:54:52,900
He was right.

6402
02:54:52,900 --> 02:54:54,220
We only have five minutes left.

6403
02:54:54,310 --> 02:54:54,490
Oh,

6404
02:54:54,490 --> 02:54:54,711
we did.

6405
02:54:54,711 --> 02:54:59,380
We tell you why he put everybody on
notice badly or these things timed.

6406
02:54:59,620 --> 02:55:00,910
It was a first friends here that's here.

6407
02:55:00,930 --> 02:55:01,690
Johnny.

6408
02:55:01,690 --> 02:55:02,411
Johnny's a man.

6409
02:55:02,411 --> 02:55:03,244
Let me here.

6410
02:55:03,810 --> 02:55:04,090
Turn

6411
02:55:04,090 --> 02:55:04,923
this out.

6412
02:55:04,970 --> 02:55:06,620
We go over to my hair.

6413
02:55:10,140 --> 02:55:13,070
It wasn't any panelist
off of him very well,

6414
02:55:13,520 --> 02:55:14,680
so that was something he did burn.

6415
02:55:14,750 --> 02:55:15,583
Well

6416
02:55:16,870 --> 02:55:17,170
man,

6417
02:55:17,170 --> 02:55:18,003
hats off.

6418
02:55:18,110 --> 02:55:18,943
He was the better man.

6419
02:55:19,830 --> 02:55:20,910
That's a man right there.

6420
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:25,450
You didn't eat the old Morgan.

6421
02:55:25,460 --> 02:55:26,010
I was going to say,

6422
02:55:26,010 --> 02:55:26,361
besides,

6423
02:55:26,361 --> 02:55:27,194
you did an awesome job.

6424
02:55:27,480 --> 02:55:28,390
[inaudible].

6425
02:55:28,930 --> 02:55:29,411
You know what,

6426
02:55:29,411 --> 02:55:29,621
man?

6427
02:55:29,621 --> 02:55:31,630
That's fine because that
just shows his character.

6428
02:55:31,660 --> 02:55:32,350
Johnny,

6429
02:55:32,350 --> 02:55:33,183
Johnny.

6430
02:55:34,180 --> 02:55:35,530
Johnny Hendricks is a man.

6431
02:55:35,940 --> 02:55:36,440
Awesome.

6432
02:55:36,440 --> 02:55:37,273
If he's a man,

6433
02:55:37,660 --> 02:55:38,560
he's the best.

6434
02:55:38,561 --> 02:55:40,490
He's the nicest guy on Fiverr.

6435
02:55:40,510 --> 02:55:44,710
You had to find a fucking monster who
strikes has been striking since he was

6436
02:55:44,711 --> 02:55:45,550
three years old.

6437
02:55:45,590 --> 02:55:46,040
Sign up.

6438
02:55:46,040 --> 02:55:46,620
Nobody's fine.

6439
02:55:46,620 --> 02:55:47,710
What is fighting right now?

6440
02:55:47,711 --> 02:55:48,770
He's fighting a wonder.

6441
02:55:48,771 --> 02:55:50,470
Boys figured out how to stay standing.

6442
02:55:50,590 --> 02:55:50,741
Yeah.

6443
02:55:50,741 --> 02:55:53,920
He's figured out how to do it in where
he's gotten so comfortable with it.

6444
02:55:53,921 --> 02:55:54,730
They can get loose.

6445
02:55:54,730 --> 02:55:56,080
That was the total level

6446
02:55:58,570 --> 02:56:00,980
higher than everybody else's.

6447
02:56:01,030 --> 02:56:01,380
How you,

6448
02:56:01,380 --> 02:56:03,280
this is how you'd be dramatic
when you say is watch this.

6449
02:56:03,430 --> 02:56:03,760
No.

6450
02:56:03,760 --> 02:56:03,911
Hey,

6451
02:56:03,911 --> 02:56:06,490
did you know what he
was fighting the future

6452
02:56:08,270 --> 02:56:09,560
and that's all you gotta say it brother.

6453
02:56:09,590 --> 02:56:09,731
Yeah,

6454
02:56:09,731 --> 02:56:11,230
but no one's going to give
you that amount of time.

6455
02:56:11,600 --> 02:56:12,140
The format.

6456
02:56:12,140 --> 02:56:14,140
Why the pause for people.

6457
02:56:14,140 --> 02:56:15,970
Everyone dreamed of jumping back and shit.

6458
02:56:15,971 --> 02:56:16,900
You don't have that type of that.

6459
02:56:17,400 --> 02:56:18,370
I can't pause.

6460
02:56:18,371 --> 02:56:19,090
I can't pause.

6461
02:56:19,090 --> 02:56:22,000
How does a wolf den son turned out?

6462
02:56:22,390 --> 02:56:26,990
I know are talking about fucking all
these like details and these guys,

6463
02:56:26,991 --> 02:56:27,990
I've never heard of it and I was like,

6464
02:56:28,020 --> 02:56:28,201
ah,

6465
02:56:28,201 --> 02:56:28,771
I can't find it.

6466
02:56:28,771 --> 02:56:29,090
Oh,

6467
02:56:29,090 --> 02:56:30,840
I was trying to keep an opening for wine.

6468
02:56:31,200 --> 02:56:32,640
I was trying to give you
prompts of your wine,

6469
02:56:32,670 --> 02:56:33,120
but I was,

6470
02:56:33,120 --> 02:56:35,130
I was kicking when you told
me and talked about that.

6471
02:56:36,830 --> 02:56:37,120
I mean,

6472
02:56:37,120 --> 02:56:37,341
you know,

6473
02:56:37,341 --> 02:56:39,600
you're just sabotage
us are off the charts.

6474
02:56:39,630 --> 02:56:40,081
Not Bad.

6475
02:56:40,081 --> 02:56:40,380
Right?

6476
02:56:40,380 --> 02:56:41,213
You're not mad.

6477
02:56:41,250 --> 02:56:41,370
Oh,

6478
02:56:41,370 --> 02:56:42,690
your wind skills are off the charts.

6479
02:56:42,840 --> 02:56:46,920
You know as much about wine is my
business manager who's got a fucking wine

6480
02:56:46,921 --> 02:56:47,760
cellar in is high.

6481
02:56:47,761 --> 02:56:49,500
I pay attention to those dudes.

6482
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:50,240
Really?

6483
02:56:50,240 --> 02:56:54,120
I'll sit in a wine or a wine store
and talked to the guy for hours.

6484
02:56:54,120 --> 02:56:54,630
I,

6485
02:56:54,630 --> 02:56:54,930
yeah,

6486
02:56:54,930 --> 02:56:56,190
my wife has just dragged me out.

6487
02:56:56,220 --> 02:56:57,150
I'll call my friend Matt.

6488
02:56:57,180 --> 02:56:58,890
I'll call him from like anywhere.

6489
02:56:58,920 --> 02:56:59,370
I'll be like,

6490
02:56:59,370 --> 02:57:00,203
all right dude,

6491
02:57:00,240 --> 02:57:01,710
I'm in some cabernets right now.

6492
02:57:01,780 --> 02:57:02,790
I'm gonna read you some shit.

6493
02:57:02,920 --> 02:57:03,060
Yeah,

6494
02:57:03,060 --> 02:57:03,990
this is the expensive shoes.

6495
02:57:03,991 --> 02:57:04,650
This isn't any good.

6496
02:57:04,650 --> 02:57:06,000
Just just tell me which of the good one.

6497
02:57:06,001 --> 02:57:06,450
And he'll go,

6498
02:57:06,450 --> 02:57:06,560
oh,

6499
02:57:06,560 --> 02:57:07,393
that's a good one.

6500
02:57:07,420 --> 02:57:09,810
[inaudible] 97 95 is a better year,

6501
02:57:09,811 --> 02:57:12,380
but 97 is not bad to go to counseling.

6502
02:57:13,020 --> 02:57:14,820
One tool has good one.

6503
02:57:14,850 --> 02:57:15,300
Who?

6504
02:57:15,300 --> 02:57:16,140
Dude from tool.

6505
02:57:16,170 --> 02:57:17,003
Oh fuck yeah.

6506
02:57:17,210 --> 02:57:18,090
Got good one.

6507
02:57:18,120 --> 02:57:19,080
He definitely does.

6508
02:57:19,170 --> 02:57:22,260
As far as if you ever had Mainers wine,

6509
02:57:22,320 --> 02:57:23,153
it's delicious.

6510
02:57:23,400 --> 02:57:25,730
Who's Maynard Maynard Keenan
purple belt in Jujitsu,

6511
02:57:25,740 --> 02:57:25,981
by the way,

6512
02:57:25,981 --> 02:57:26,640
from tool.

6513
02:57:26,640 --> 02:57:29,460
He was the one I was talking about before
when I was talking about my friend who

6514
02:57:29,461 --> 02:57:30,294
injured his hip.

6515
02:57:30,300 --> 02:57:31,290
I just didn't want to namedrop.

6516
02:57:31,350 --> 02:57:31,631
Oh.

6517
02:57:31,631 --> 02:57:32,341
And he's a,

6518
02:57:32,341 --> 02:57:33,190
he owns could do.

6519
02:57:33,220 --> 02:57:34,350
So it's really good.

6520
02:57:34,560 --> 02:57:35,580
He does everything.

6521
02:57:35,790 --> 02:57:36,930
If he does anything,

6522
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:37,650
he does it well.

6523
02:57:37,650 --> 02:57:39,360
He does it a black belt level.

6524
02:57:39,390 --> 02:57:39,590
Yeah.

6525
02:57:39,590 --> 02:57:39,960
You know,

6526
02:57:39,960 --> 02:57:40,793
you'd sooner a tool.

6527
02:57:40,900 --> 02:57:43,740
He makes fucking
fantastic back on the mat.

6528
02:57:43,800 --> 02:57:44,070
Wow.

6529
02:57:44,070 --> 02:57:44,870
Drilling.

6530
02:57:44,870 --> 02:57:45,180
He's,

6531
02:57:45,180 --> 02:57:45,391
you know,

6532
02:57:45,391 --> 02:57:45,960
he's my age.

6533
02:57:45,960 --> 02:57:46,651
Great music.

6534
02:57:46,651 --> 02:57:47,010
Yes.

6535
02:57:47,010 --> 02:57:47,843
He's a beast.

6536
02:57:48,060 --> 02:57:49,140
Like an intellectual.

6537
02:57:49,141 --> 02:57:49,270
A,

6538
02:57:49,270 --> 02:57:49,621
he's a,

6539
02:57:49,621 --> 02:57:50,010
he's a,

6540
02:57:50,010 --> 02:57:52,650
he's a no bullshit kind of a guy.

6541
02:57:52,820 --> 02:57:57,820
And he called me up because I had that
a primal guy on Mark Sisson and uh,

6542
02:57:57,990 --> 02:57:59,640
he got a lot of things right.

6543
02:57:59,641 --> 02:58:01,740
But apparently when he was talking wine,

6544
02:58:02,070 --> 02:58:02,260
uh,

6545
02:58:02,260 --> 02:58:02,980
Maynard was like,

6546
02:58:02,980 --> 02:58:03,813
Eh,

6547
02:58:04,190 --> 02:58:05,350
stay in your lane son.

6548
02:58:05,940 --> 02:58:06,391
Yeah.

6549
02:58:06,391 --> 02:58:06,910
He's like,

6550
02:58:06,910 --> 02:58:08,700
we don't use 87 different chemicals.

6551
02:58:08,701 --> 02:58:09,120
He's like,

6552
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:09,631
you guys,

6553
02:58:09,631 --> 02:58:10,770
we need to use some natural shit.

6554
02:58:10,771 --> 02:58:11,560
Like yeast.

6555
02:58:11,560 --> 02:58:11,881
Yeah.

6556
02:58:11,881 --> 02:58:12,540
Maybe.

6557
02:58:12,540 --> 02:58:12,901
And you know,

6558
02:58:12,901 --> 02:58:13,790
maybe some tannins.

6559
02:58:15,380 --> 02:58:15,870
Fine.

6560
02:58:15,870 --> 02:58:16,540
A lot of times,

6561
02:58:16,540 --> 02:58:17,300
Remarkably Sam,

6562
02:58:17,300 --> 02:58:19,210
it was Christ Wonderboy is good.

6563
02:58:19,230 --> 02:58:19,921
Good God.

6564
02:58:19,921 --> 02:58:20,754
He's a snake.

6565
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:21,540
Madness.

6566
02:58:21,540 --> 02:58:22,351
Not to be a dick.

6567
02:58:22,351 --> 02:58:27,351
I'm just saying this from since 1986
remember back in the day way he moves

6568
02:58:31,270 --> 02:58:32,730
to welterweight in the world.

6569
02:58:33,750 --> 02:58:34,583
In the first round.

6570
02:58:36,600 --> 02:58:37,710
He crushed them in the first round.

6571
02:58:38,110 --> 02:58:40,080
Two that we might be looking
at the champion right there.

6572
02:58:40,110 --> 02:58:44,910
We really must have been saying what
Robbie Lawler's Goddamn ferocious.

6573
02:58:44,911 --> 02:58:46,050
That mother fucker knocked out

6574
02:58:47,660 --> 02:58:49,770
knocked dot Melvin malleable
matchup for Robbie.

6575
02:58:49,860 --> 02:58:51,240
You might be right,

6576
02:58:51,390 --> 02:58:54,150
but Johnny Hodges to the worst
matchup you might be right.

6577
02:58:54,180 --> 02:58:54,871
But there are,

6578
02:58:54,871 --> 02:58:58,140
I believe there's a difference in the
amount of danger that Robbie Lawler we'll

6579
02:58:58,141 --> 02:59:00,870
put himself in versus the amount
of danger that Johnny [inaudible].

6580
02:59:01,320 --> 02:59:02,153
Boy,

6581
02:59:02,260 --> 02:59:06,270
I'm just saying the amount of danger
he'll put himself in trying to hit him.

6582
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:10,710
Robbie Lawler would take some crazy ass
fucking chances and do some explosive,

6583
02:59:10,980 --> 02:59:12,980
ridiculously aggressive shit.

6584
02:59:12,981 --> 02:59:13,320
Luck.

6585
02:59:13,320 --> 02:59:14,310
Even as a champion,

6586
02:59:14,550 --> 02:59:15,780
he might not land it,

6587
02:59:15,781 --> 02:59:16,231
but dude,

6588
02:59:16,231 --> 02:59:18,630
he knocked Melvin man who have dead.

6589
02:59:18,631 --> 02:59:19,201
It's crazy.

6590
02:59:19,201 --> 02:59:22,790
He's so indestructable we're
man Hook was 10 off on you.

6591
02:59:22,830 --> 02:59:24,330
You treat them like a reaction,

6592
02:59:24,730 --> 02:59:26,910
like a geode just kicking his leg.

6593
02:59:26,920 --> 02:59:28,620
His leg looked like it
was like a like on a,

6594
02:59:28,621 --> 02:59:29,760
on a string like war.

6595
02:59:29,950 --> 02:59:31,120
And then he just talked to his head.

6596
02:59:31,450 --> 02:59:33,060
I'll give Wonderboy the title shot.

6597
02:59:33,090 --> 02:59:34,170
Well I believe so.

6598
02:59:34,200 --> 02:59:34,831
I believe so,

6599
02:59:34,831 --> 02:59:35,201
but I,

6600
02:59:35,201 --> 02:59:35,460
I,

6601
02:59:35,460 --> 02:59:38,780
I think the Tyron Woodley still has a
real good argument that he deserves the

6602
02:59:38,781 --> 02:59:42,420
title shot even though he's
not as impressive as this
guy because his last fight

6603
02:59:42,421 --> 02:59:43,470
he won by injury.

6604
02:59:43,770 --> 02:59:44,550
You know,

6605
02:59:44,550 --> 02:59:46,480
Carlos condit kicked fucked up as me.

6606
02:59:46,640 --> 02:59:47,600
He was,

6607
02:59:47,790 --> 02:59:48,930
he was winning that fight though.

6608
02:59:48,960 --> 02:59:50,160
He definitely wanted the first graph.

6609
02:59:50,310 --> 02:59:51,360
That's a tough argument,

6610
02:59:51,361 --> 02:59:54,660
especially as far as mark and bill saying
that he was supposed to be fighting

6611
02:59:54,661 --> 02:59:56,610
Johny Hendricks number one title shot.

6612
02:59:56,611 --> 02:59:59,340
Johnny Hendricks had to pull out because
he didn't make weight and essentially

6613
02:59:59,341 --> 03:00:01,140
Tyron was promised the title shot.

6614
03:00:01,640 --> 03:00:03,260
You know how the PFC rose thing?

6615
03:00:03,360 --> 03:00:07,620
I don't think it's a bad
thing if Wonderboy weights
out and knock somebody else

6616
03:00:07,621 --> 03:00:10,890
off because I'm telling you
my performance like this,

6617
03:00:10,891 --> 03:00:14,790
a performance like this is like
some superstar emerging shit.

6618
03:00:15,180 --> 03:00:15,451
Dude.

6619
03:00:15,451 --> 03:00:17,460
He looked like a genius tonight.

6620
03:00:17,490 --> 03:00:18,660
A striking genius.

6621
03:00:18,810 --> 03:00:20,820
Look at that spinning
back kick to the arm.

6622
03:00:21,060 --> 03:00:23,970
Like it's like getting hit by
a fucking bat in your arms.

6623
03:00:24,090 --> 03:00:25,320
He's kicking him in the arms.

6624
03:00:25,470 --> 03:00:26,400
Johnny Hendricks was like,

6625
03:00:26,401 --> 03:00:27,310
what the fuck?

6626
03:00:27,320 --> 03:00:28,500
Getting hit by a machine.

6627
03:00:28,580 --> 03:00:29,413
Oh my God,

6628
03:00:30,810 --> 03:00:33,960
everything he's doing is perfect example.

6629
03:00:33,980 --> 03:00:37,170
This is a direct example of what we were
talking about when we were going over

6630
03:00:37,171 --> 03:00:38,100
the technique of the kick.

6631
03:00:38,360 --> 03:00:39,091
He throws everything,

6632
03:00:39,091 --> 03:00:40,290
he slides into it,

6633
03:00:40,440 --> 03:00:41,880
he turns his hip over,

6634
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,100
he turns his hip over
and he throws punches.

6635
03:00:44,340 --> 03:00:46,650
He's laser beam accurate man,

6636
03:00:46,651 --> 03:00:50,130
like he's on a wire and sees what
you're doing before you do it right.

6637
03:00:50,370 --> 03:00:51,330
See all you're going to throw it,

6638
03:00:51,331 --> 03:00:52,110
write it,

6639
03:00:52,110 --> 03:00:52,770
and let me just,

6640
03:00:52,770 --> 03:00:53,940
let me just move a little bit back.

6641
03:00:53,941 --> 03:00:55,110
But by the way,

6642
03:00:55,111 --> 03:00:56,880
he landed that right kick to the body.

6643
03:00:56,881 --> 03:01:00,310
They're white kick to the body and that
exchange before it was extraordinary

6644
03:01:00,310 --> 03:01:01,180
because he's,

6645
03:01:01,390 --> 03:01:02,740
he knows he's on the way out,

6646
03:01:02,741 --> 03:01:06,190
but he also knows where Hendricks left
arm is and he sneaks that right kick

6647
03:01:06,191 --> 03:01:08,860
right under it as he
was sliding backwards,

6648
03:01:08,920 --> 03:01:11,020
which very few people are
going to be able to do crazy.

6649
03:01:11,021 --> 03:01:12,540
You know the crazy guy
took my fighting more.

6650
03:01:12,550 --> 03:01:14,680
So what you do in martial arts,

6651
03:01:14,860 --> 03:01:15,280
you,

6652
03:01:15,280 --> 03:01:16,091
like I said before,

6653
03:01:16,091 --> 03:01:18,370
we all have a certain
amount of time to drill,

6654
03:01:18,640 --> 03:01:19,360
so whatever.

6655
03:01:19,360 --> 03:01:21,580
What ever the cold food,

6656
03:01:21,581 --> 03:01:22,900
the karate guys,

6657
03:01:23,290 --> 03:01:26,890
whatever they were doing during the dark
ages when we thought it didn't work,

6658
03:01:27,190 --> 03:01:28,330
whatever they were doing,

6659
03:01:28,331 --> 03:01:30,100
they were getting really good at it,

6660
03:01:30,370 --> 03:01:33,430
at that range and getting
fucking the best at that range.

6661
03:01:33,610 --> 03:01:36,040
Maybe they can get taken down easily.

6662
03:01:36,220 --> 03:01:38,110
Maybe though they don't know any Jujitsu.

6663
03:01:38,380 --> 03:01:42,970
But now we gotten to the point where they
spent all that time in that range and

6664
03:01:42,971 --> 03:01:46,930
now they added in supplement a wrestling
so they can stay in that range.

6665
03:01:47,110 --> 03:01:48,640
The range that they rule,

6666
03:01:48,760 --> 03:01:52,500
the range that they spent all their time
and the range that nobody else spent

6667
03:01:52,501 --> 03:01:53,560
that much time on that ranch.

6668
03:01:53,740 --> 03:01:55,930
But they got the wrestling
and the surroundings,

6669
03:01:56,110 --> 03:02:00,250
they can stay in that range that they
rule in during the dark ages when everyone

6670
03:02:00,251 --> 03:02:01,150
thought that didn't work,

6671
03:02:01,220 --> 03:02:01,571
but hey,

6672
03:02:01,571 --> 03:02:02,320
guess what?

6673
03:02:02,320 --> 03:02:03,700
Now we're the fucking works.

6674
03:02:03,880 --> 03:02:05,080
Cause I got all that shit.

6675
03:02:05,720 --> 03:02:06,553
I love heavy.

6676
03:02:09,030 --> 03:02:11,930
We just saw karate when he talks.

6677
03:02:11,931 --> 03:02:12,764
He talks.

6678
03:02:13,290 --> 03:02:13,591
He's like,

6679
03:02:13,591 --> 03:02:13,780
dude,

6680
03:02:13,780 --> 03:02:15,420
we have to end this podcast on that.

6681
03:02:15,421 --> 03:02:16,254
Cause we have

6682
03:02:17,760 --> 03:02:18,550
mark,

6683
03:02:18,550 --> 03:02:19,500
we're at the three hour mark.

6684
03:02:19,510 --> 03:02:19,700
We,

6685
03:02:19,700 --> 03:02:20,670
we did we go over yet?

6686
03:02:20,800 --> 03:02:21,361
But yeah,

6687
03:02:21,361 --> 03:02:21,921
we have swapped,

6688
03:02:21,921 --> 03:02:23,160
slightly went over three hours.

6689
03:02:23,161 --> 03:02:24,400
So most of this has gone good.

6690
03:02:24,401 --> 03:02:25,740
I'd everybody good long,

6691
03:02:25,800 --> 03:02:26,633
big kiss.

6692
03:02:27,060 --> 03:02:27,330
Eddie,

6693
03:02:27,330 --> 03:02:28,530
you're grabbing me ramble.

6694
03:02:28,590 --> 03:02:28,801
No,

6695
03:02:28,801 --> 03:02:29,251
you're great.

6696
03:02:29,251 --> 03:02:32,040
Could you go when it gets dark.
