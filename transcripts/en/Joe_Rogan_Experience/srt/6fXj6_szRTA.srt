1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,563
Okay.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,113
Okay.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,963
Okay.

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,063
Yeah.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,860
The Joe Rogan experience

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,920
[inaudible]

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,470
brothers and sisters,

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,300
lovers in children,

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,270
Brian Red Van and Eddie
Bravo or in the building.

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,243
Hello.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,090
Much respect to the Korean Zombie.

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,490
Eddie Bravo was wearing
a Korean Zombie shirt.

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,720
And what this means for you,

14
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:45,100
non MMA people.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,110
There's a guy named Chan,

16
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:48,340
some Junge who's the,

17
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,750
they call them the Korean Zombie.

18
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:50,650
That's his nickname.

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,330
And this weekend on a Saturday night
at the UFC against Leonard Garcia,

20
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:58,810
he pulled off the first
twister ever in the UFC.

21
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,300
And the significance of
course is at Eddie Bravo.

22
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:04,600
Our guests today actually
invented the twister.

23
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,280
I didn't invent it.

24
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,460
Well,

25
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,380
you invented the rest.

26
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,620
Set up the setup.

27
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,110
The setups.

28
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,460
Yes.

29
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,211
The finishing move.

30
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:10,460
No,

31
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,580
when you called the rustling mode,

32
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,300
but people used to finish
people within wrestling.

33
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,280
You can,

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,740
but did they do it your way
with the s grip on the forehead?

35
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:19,180
I thought that was all like your,

36
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,990
your uh,

37
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,820
innovation to turn into submission.

38
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,100
Uh,

39
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,421
no,

40
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:24,661
no,

41
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:24,871
no.

42
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:25,704
People were cranky.

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,590
I don't know if they were cranking
and exactly the way I crank it,

44
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:29,880
but I'm pretty sure,

45
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,773
um,

46
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,980
you seen other people get submitted with
it before you ever started doing it?

47
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,020
We would like to,

48
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,070
in high school,

49
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,270
I wrestled a couple of years and then I
wrestled in Santa Anna High and in ninth

50
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:44,030
grade a guy named Jesse
Barrios and another guy,

51
00:01:44,031 --> 00:01:46,220
his buddy is the one who showed me,

52
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,900
I can't remember his name,

53
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:49,250
I couldn't even remember it from my book,

54
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:51,200
but Jesse Barrios is his friend,

55
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,750
Santa Ana high school in 1985.

56
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,430
If anybody out there is from that,

57
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,320
there's Jesse Barrios friend,

58
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,630
the other leg rider on
that wrestling team.

59
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,260
Fuck,

60
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,130
I don't know what his name was.

61
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:01,640
Anyways,

62
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,910
he showed it to me and both
of those and in wrestling,

63
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:06,770
leg riding is for weak people.

64
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,510
And all that means is,

65
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,700
is,

66
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:09,950
uh,

67
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,401
we need,

68
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:11,031
we're so weak,

69
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:16,031
we need to use our legs a lot more than
the big strong dudes who are wrestling

70
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:16,271
and,

71
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:16,471
and,

72
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:19,070
and hitting the weights and
had big chest and shoulders.

73
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,700
Those guys really didn't rely on their
legs as much as the weak guys like me.

74
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,640
I would skip Russ,

75
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,160
uh,

76
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,120
weightlifting practice.

77
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:27,860
I was in the back of the house hiding.

78
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,820
I was,

79
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,600
I was weak.

80
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,740
Even back then.

81
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,300
I was a terrible athlete.

82
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:33,710
I've never been a great athlete,

83
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,810
so I had to rely on using my legs.

84
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,000
And I thought,

85
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:38,211
you know,

86
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:39,044
they came to me,

87
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,340
Jesse came to me and I go,

88
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:40,611
dude,

89
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:41,690
you'll be perfect for this.

90
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,800
You know,

91
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,030
cause they knew I would just get out,

92
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,760
just get smashed if I try
to go heads up with people.

93
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,570
So it's a pending move in
that I learned in wrestling.

94
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,370
And um,

95
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,631
I got,

96
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,620
I got pretty good at it.

97
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,160
I would,

98
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,120
that was my shit.

99
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,961
Even in high school.

100
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:57,351
That was my,

101
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:58,820
that was the thing I always tried.

102
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,050
I got some cool ass stories
that maybe one day I'll,

103
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:02,320
I'll,

104
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,591
I'll,

105
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:03,400
uh,

106
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,211
I'll talk about them,

107
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,650
but I have some cool wrestling stories.

108
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,071
But anyways,

109
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,060
I sucked at wrestling.

110
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,370
I only had one take
down two fucking years.

111
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:10,204
I sucked.

112
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,760
So I just totally relied on
leg riding and and using the,

113
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,120
it's actually called the guillotine.

114
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,680
It's actually not called the twister,

115
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,970
it's called the guillotine,

116
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,920
but when I started doing it in Jujitsu,

117
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,120
Higgin Machado and John John Machado
would just call it the twister because the

118
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,470
guillotine already existed.

119
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,520
There's a lot of people out there that
that think that I'd like took this

120
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,620
wrestling move and I said,

121
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,300
I'm going to try to fool the world and
change the name and say I invented it.

122
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,900
There's thousands of people
that think that it's hilarious.

123
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,730
In my books from day one,

124
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,790
I I,

125
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,230
it was good people to hold on.

126
00:03:45,231 --> 00:03:48,530
So you're being a little bit modest
because you invented all these setups and

127
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:51,020
turned it into a very
high percentage finish.

128
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,600
Yeah.

129
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,310
You did a lot of signups from a lot
of different places where it became,

130
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:55,770
I'm doing,

131
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,900
none of that stuff existed,

132
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,700
but this is the transition.

133
00:03:58,701 --> 00:03:59,180
So

134
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,920
I ended up quitting wrestling.

135
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:01,371
The work,

136
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:02,204
the work,

137
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,380
the work will,

138
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,101
the work ethic,

139
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:07,010
you need to be a good wrestler or
something that is just not in my body.

140
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:07,844
Chemistry.

141
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,230
I was not made to work
really hard physically I,

142
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,370
I just,

143
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,500
I hated work.

144
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:13,430
Regular jobs.

145
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:16,580
I knew that's why it was
all about rock stardom or,

146
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,320
or playing football.

147
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:18,740
It was a,

148
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:23,740
I just want her to be like a famous dude
who just played for a living and got

149
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:26,270
paid and it was a fucking
adored by everybody.

150
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:27,140
That's what I wanted.

151
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,880
I didn't want to work.

152
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:29,714
I hate it.

153
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,531
Of course.

154
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:31,370
Who doesn't want,

155
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,091
Oh my God,

156
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:34,790
what worked like actually
like killed me inside.

157
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,790
So it drove my artistic side.

158
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,150
So once I realized that
Mexicans don't play football,

159
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:41,811
I'm like,

160
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:42,411
oh my God,

161
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:45,170
I was in ninth grade and I was the
slowest motherfucker out there.

162
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,030
And,

163
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,850
and the owl,

164
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,540
that was it.

165
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,373
You know,

166
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,940
I had these dreams of playing football
or make it an a music that football was

167
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:54,020
crushed in ninth grade.

168
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,920
Once everyone starts to grow,

169
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:56,721
you know what?

170
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:57,021
Junior,

171
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:58,760
all American and pee wee football,

172
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,170
that's fucked up.

173
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,440
I played defensive lineman and
middle linebacker in football.

174
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,060
I actually thought I was going to be a
defensive lineman and a middle linebacker

175
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,320
because when you're eight and year nine,

176
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,700
everyone is the same size.

177
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,990
And you know,

178
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:15,410
you did some brainwashing going on
that really thought I was going to be a

179
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:16,244
football player.

180
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,100
I really thought I was
until ninth grade shit.

181
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,761
Oh Man.

182
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:20,210
When,

183
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,440
when I was in sixth grade,

184
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:24,110
I was supposed to make the football
team because in my neighborhood,

185
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,310
in my neighborhood,

186
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,180
uh,

187
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,751
I was pretty,

188
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:29,870
I was a pretty good football player
around Mexicans from like a really poor

189
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,470
neighborhood.

190
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,610
I was pretty bad ass.

191
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,230
But when you go to school,

192
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,741
when you go,

193
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:35,270
when I went to sixth
grade and then junior,

194
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:35,811
all American,

195
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:36,730
when you know,

196
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,760
football,

197
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,960
peewee football was pretty,

198
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:39,890
I was pretty good.

199
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,260
But once people start
growing and start changing,

200
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:43,094
and sixth grade,

201
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,800
I went to sixth grade and I
didn't make the football team.

202
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:48,910
They cut me off far from the,

203
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,210
the,

204
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:49,560
the,

205
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:49,761
the,

206
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:50,630
I was so embarrassing,

207
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:52,280
but it was flag football.

208
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,520
It wasn't tackle.

209
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:54,500
So in my head I'm like,

210
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,630
wait until ninth grade
when I get the high school,

211
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,270
I'm gonna play some tap cause I'm going
to show you what the fuck's going on.

212
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,890
So that's what I was thinking that I go,

213
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:02,540
fuck this year fucks it's sixth grade.

214
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,170
So seventh grade I
transferred myself to a far,

215
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,360
uh,

216
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,450
a school far away that I only went to,

217
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,430
cause there's another story,

218
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,090
there's more stories where I was
driven away from my junior high school.

219
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:15,140
So I went to another school.

220
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,780
I tried out for the football
team in the seventh grade.

221
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,790
I got good again,

222
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,840
but it was flag football.

223
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,730
But I was so embarrassed that I told,

224
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,710
I told my friends growing up,

225
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,820
all my kids,

226
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,653
I told him that,

227
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:26,961
yeah,

228
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:29,480
I made the team second string quarterback,

229
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,231
but you know what?

230
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:31,100
I got in a fight.

231
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,390
So they had to cut me.

232
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:32,691
Man,

233
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:33,560
it sucks.

234
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,183
I don't,

235
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,460
the kids that I grew up with
thought I made the team,

236
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:43,160
but I got cut because I
got in a fight with a dude.

237
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,860
I kept that going.

238
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,440
I was so embarrassed that
I didn't make the team.

239
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,870
I was so embarrassed and
then in the eighth grade,

240
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,501
one of,

241
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:52,334
one of my,

242
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,030
the guys that I grew up with winter,

243
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,883
that school too,

244
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,940
he made the team.

245
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:56,774
He was awesome.

246
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,340
I didn't make the team again.

247
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,190
He never brought up the fact
that he never asked anybody,

248
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,660
didn't even make the team last year.

249
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,250
That never got brought up.

250
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:05,570
They never humiliated me.

251
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,690
Maybe they were talking behind
my back like like I don't know.

252
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,980
No one ever brought it up,

253
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:12,260
but I did lie about it and
I'm coming clean with it now.

254
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:13,490
I totally lied about it.

255
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,220
Don't you think for dudes
that competition like that,

256
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:17,270
any kind of competition,

257
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,400
whether it's football or
wrestling or anything,

258
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,330
is it so important for kids and they're
growing up to know how hard it is?

259
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,740
If you really want to
get good at something,

260
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,350
oh yeah.

261
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,710
You got like Mexicans.

262
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:28,041
Listen,

263
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,230
if you're Mexican and you think
you're going to be a football player,

264
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,700
look at reality.

265
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,331
Listen to me.

266
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:33,350
Liquor reality.

267
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,243
There's not that very,

268
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,290
there's one Mexican and
he plays quarterback.

269
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,250
You think you're going to be him?

270
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,450
Get Out,

271
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,290
get out of football,

272
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,150
get that shit out of your
head if you're Mexican,

273
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,370
unless you got some tall
motherfuckers and your family.

274
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,520
There's a couple of Mexicans out there
but is easily made it as a four maybe.

275
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,930
Maybe you think maybe it's do with that.

276
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,640
There's a lot more than
just being an athlete.

277
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:53,840
Everybody's an athlete and a football.

278
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,120
You've got to have some serious
skills and serious magic.

279
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,340
He could've just been a
really strong athletic guy.

280
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:02,420
Look at Matt Mitch Realm and strong and
athletic match material is a fucking

281
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,254
athlete.

282
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:03,740
You know,

283
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,490
he didn't.

284
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,430
So do you think that if those
guys came over to the UFC,

285
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,690
those super athletes,

286
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:09,710
so it's NFL dudes.

287
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,440
Do you think that like that's what we're
seeing with like John Jones because

288
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:13,520
that's the talk that,

289
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:13,731
you know,

290
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:15,380
Jon Jones has two brothers I believe,

291
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:16,640
that are playing football right now.

292
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,690
I mean we've sat,

293
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,440
it's incredible.

294
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,100
I mean he's a,

295
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,000
Jon Jones is,

296
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,860
he's a super athlete and there's,

297
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,700
there's dudes that are super athletes
that are in maybe other sports and we're

298
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:27,080
starting to see in the UFC.

299
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:28,670
That's like a big topic of discussion.

300
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,360
Like what,

301
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,960
how much of a difference does
like serious athleticism make?

302
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,160
It makes a huge,

303
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,460
Jon Jones has been a fucking doing,

304
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,370
he's been doing mixed martial
arts for only three years.

305
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,810
Before that he was a wrestler.

306
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,880
I mean that's incredible.

307
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:44,360
We're going to,

308
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,751
you know what,

309
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:46,610
it's already happened in boxing.

310
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,660
Just look at what happened with
boxing culturally look what happened.

311
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,610
It's interesting though
that football and it's,

312
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,530
I guess it's just where
the money is that the,

313
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:57,020
the high money ones like
football and basketball,

314
00:08:57,021 --> 00:08:58,110
they get the best athletes.

315
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,490
Yes.

316
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,140
I mean even though the UFC
has been around now for,

317
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:01,351
you know,

318
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:04,590
since [inaudible] 93 it's not
been like a real accepted,

319
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,140
you know,

320
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,630
a mainstream thing,

321
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,490
but for like the last five or six years,

322
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:08,820
right,

323
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,680
when you say yes,

324
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,161
yes.

325
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:11,790
You know,

326
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,790
it's the super athletes that start Jujitsu
early wrestling their whole lives and

327
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:19,021
striking early.

328
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:20,700
They put it together like
the roof old brothers.

329
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:21,210
Yes.

330
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,930
It's the best athletes that start
off like the raw Ruffo brothers,

331
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:25,980
you know?

332
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,371
I mean,

333
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:27,031
it's some,

334
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:32,031
some people can start off with Jujitsu
and wrestling and striking early and

335
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,460
achieve so much physically from it,

336
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,050
but still they weren't
born with the athleticism.

337
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,571
You know what I mean?

338
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:40,980
You've got to be a natural.

339
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,210
It's got to all come together.

340
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:46,560
You've got to have all the pieces together
to make it in the big sports that we

341
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:47,190
see today.

342
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,300
And they're like foot.

343
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,260
You can't start,

344
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:52,020
start playing football when
you're 22 and make the NFL.

345
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,370
If you do that.

346
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,140
It may have happened once or twice.

347
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:56,100
Some African Guy,

348
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,120
I don't know.

349
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,910
It may have happened.

350
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,320
Why not?

351
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,050
I mean,

352
00:09:59,050 --> 00:09:59,520
uh,

353
00:09:59,520 --> 00:09:59,821
you know,

354
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:04,200
one of them [inaudible] guys that started
playing basketball for 18 months and

355
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:05,034
he's in the NBA.

356
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,203
You know what I'm saying?

357
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,920
Every now and then you get those freaks.

358
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,860
But generally 98% of the time,

359
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,050
look at what's going
on with all the sports.

360
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,850
They just go and find that dude and say,

361
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:15,031
hey,

362
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,020
you want to play basketball?

363
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:16,651
I don't even know.

364
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:18,740
I'm just making it one of those goods.

365
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,501
What are those dudes?

366
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:22,200
I'm sure minuit bowl at a combi.

367
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:22,831
Mutombo.

368
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,000
I can't even say his name,

369
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,900
but one of those dudes I'm sure
started playing basketball late.

370
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,350
Do you imagine what it must
be like living like nuke ball?

371
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:33,390
It's like you're living in doll houses.

372
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,023
Everywhere you go.

373
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,190
They're dollhouses.

374
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,640
Everyone's building is built for a dolls.

375
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,440
You have to hunch everywhere you go.

376
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,440
Mad worked nights not naturally for girls,

377
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,280
for girls,

378
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,300
taller guys.

379
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,890
Naturally the taller you are,

380
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,960
the more attractive you on it naturally,

381
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:49,920
but what,

382
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,500
what exactly what size?

383
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:53,280
Six eight,

384
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,581
six,

385
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:54,030
seven.

386
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,650
Does it become a turnoff to girls because
there must be a turn off point or are

387
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:01,590
they turned on by guys that are
seven foot three there's a guy,

388
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,420
a girl look at a guy seven foot
three and it's totally attracted him.

389
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,780
He's seven foot three so rare.

390
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,613
I love so much.

391
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,483
Or is it like,

392
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,393
hmm,

393
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,380
that's too tall.

394
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,760
I don't like of that tos.

395
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:12,594
Ridiculous.

396
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,823
You know what I mean?

397
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,640
What is it?

398
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:14,971
Well,

399
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:15,900
they would also worry,

400
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:17,670
I think evolutionarily about that.

401
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,360
Is this real,

402
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,140
is that a real word?

403
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,973
Uh,

404
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,310
about the baby getting too big inside of
them and get stuck coming out of their

405
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:24,750
poster and just blow it all out.

406
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,990
If you've got a seven foot three dude,

407
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,920
imagine how big is fucking babies are.

408
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,240
If it's half his baby,

409
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,450
you know you got a 1520 pound
baby inside your hooker.

410
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,290
You know what?

411
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,250
I will say this though,

412
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:39,600
I'm not attracted to zoo work that I'm
not a talk track that a real tall checks,

413
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:40,434
I'm just,

414
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:40,891
you know,

415
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:43,050
and especially when they
get fucking ridiculous.

416
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:44,520
If a girl is six foot one,

417
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,650
usually they gotta be,

418
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,820
they gotta have really pretty faces and
that's usually their bodies start to get

419
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:51,450
out of whack.

420
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,051
You know what I mean?

421
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:52,870
It just like,

422
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,870
but I have looked at big tall ass
checks and when you see them in public,

423
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,580
the thoughts we'll race through my mind.

424
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:01,414
Like damn,

425
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,170
that'd be nice just to pump a load into
her and see what my baby would see,

426
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:06,430
what my boy would turn out like,

427
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:06,880
you know what I mean?

428
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,980
How proud would I be up that fucking kid?

429
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,053
You know what I mean?

430
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,160
He's six foot three and that's my son.

431
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,820
And you imagine he's six foot five and
that's my son and he's eating ass Todd

432
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,600
Duffy looking dog.

433
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,381
That's my son.

434
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:19,000
Does the Subbie cool dude.

435
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:20,320
How cool would that be?

436
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:20,861
Can you imagine?

437
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,210
That's what you look for in a girl.

438
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:22,601
That's how you,

439
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:24,640
who cares what she looks like post.

440
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,503
Give me a son.

441
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,800
Two conversation at the same,

442
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:27,311
can you imagine?

443
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:28,510
That's how you found girls.

444
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,920
That's like how you went to go date girls
just by looking at them as a mother to

445
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:33,610
a child,

446
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,530
like a super athlete like you all.

447
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,090
See that's what I'm,

448
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,300
that dude who Zulu member Zulu,

449
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,770
the guy who fought Hixon gracing,

450
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,020
he has this story about,

451
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:44,710
uh,

452
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,710
the way he described it was a large
Negro bus and that he knew that she would

453
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,140
make great babies for him.

454
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,880
So he found her and he described like,

455
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,180
look what he did,

456
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,060
like how we shot Loza tour to make,

457
00:12:58,061 --> 00:12:58,270
uh,

458
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,540
to make a boy that he knew that the way
he was doing it was definitely to make a

459
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,270
boy and he had some method
and then Zulu came out.

460
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,210
Did I would pay fit?

461
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:05,921
Great Story.

462
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:08,800
I would pay 50 bucks right
now if you said I got the DVD,

463
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:09,880
the documentary of that,

464
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,090
I'll give you 50 bucks for that.

465
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,130
I would even go 75 bucks per article.

466
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:15,810
Europe,

467
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,110
your das a lot.

468
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:17,944
But God dammit,

469
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,820
I'll still pay for it.

470
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,410
That's an awesome story.

471
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,540
You matched how much of a
pain in the ass it must be.

472
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,510
If you're a kid and your dad was some
fighter and you're supposed to be a

473
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:26,140
fighter too.

474
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,411
You're like,

475
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:27,250
God damn,

476
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:28,060
really,

477
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,290
I can't just have fun.

478
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,370
I can't just go,

479
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:30,760
hang on.

480
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:30,911
No,

481
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,050
I got to go on a fight.

482
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,220
Oh Shit.

483
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,560
Or like you need to lose his son.

484
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,780
His son didn't really seem like
you want it to be doing that.

485
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,673
Right.

486
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,280
You know,

487
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,840
I mean it's,

488
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,600
it's almost like,

489
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,140
I mean,

490
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,220
you almost have to,

491
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:42,491
if your,

492
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:43,450
your dad is Zulu,

493
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:47,230
you know your dad is famous guy who
gotten a bare knuckle cage fight with

494
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:49,240
fucking Hixon Gracie back in the game.

495
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,110
Maybe he,

496
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,360
maybe he wasn't into any
kind of got just like,

497
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:53,020
you know what,

498
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,430
I,

499
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,970
I don't want to work a regular job.

500
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,500
I got a name I can actually fight.

501
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,000
But it didn't do Jujitsu though.

502
00:13:58,001 --> 00:13:58,834
He was all right.

503
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,730
He was like a purple
belt back when he fought.

504
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:01,210
So yeah,

505
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:06,210
he was doing Jujitsu so in a weird
way Zulu like Jujitsu Beats Zulu,

506
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:09,100
but Zulu son was into Jujitsu.

507
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,391
That's pretty cool,

508
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:10,661
right?

509
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:10,780
Yeah,

510
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,051
yeah.

511
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,010
Do you remember that?

512
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:16,060
Hixon Gracie footage for those who don't
know Hixon versus Zulu is one of the

513
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:16,571
very,

514
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:18,790
very first like no rules,

515
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,420
fights,

516
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:19,631
you know,

517
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:20,231
that was like,

518
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:21,250
what are they planned it out.

519
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:25,270
They had a whole arena full of people
in Brazil checking this out and a young

520
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:26,051
Hixon Gracie,

521
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,960
he was like 18 I think he was
a representative of Jujitsu,

522
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,460
fought this shy,

523
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:31,960
it's super athlete,

524
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:33,430
black dude named Zulu.

525
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,110
And his guys just yoked.

526
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:35,501
He just,

527
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:39,040
just slamming them and Hixon eventually
gets his back and strangle them and it's

528
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:43,450
one of those all time great videos where
people watch it like Jujitsu Gardens.

529
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,500
Back in the day it was like,

530
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:45,640
this is proof man.

531
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:46,474
This is proof.

532
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:46,751
Like,

533
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:47,200
look,

534
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,550
if you get good Jujitsu,

535
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,320
you can overcome a guide like this,

536
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:50,861
like and you're,

537
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:52,040
he's 18 it was like

538
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,300
a big fucking deal and the footage
is so bad but it looks cool.

539
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,260
It's like 50th generation.

540
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,370
All that footage.

541
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,820
It's dude taping it off via jazz.

542
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:08,560
Somehow it got the DVD and then a copy
and it already started off as terrible

543
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:09,220
footage.

544
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,380
Now it's like like silhouetted kind of.

545
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:14,800
It's like a yellow and
black and orange type thing,

546
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:15,903
but it classes.

547
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,830
One of the coolest things that I ever
got at a being famous was I got to have

548
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:20,670
dinner with Hixson.

549
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:21,740
Dot.

550
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,170
Tommy may want to close things out,

551
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,490
man.

552
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,850
I had dinner with Hickson and then we
went over his house and we watched fights

553
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,550
and he broke down what
dudes were doing wrong.

554
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:34,020
He was watching Mario Sperry fight and
coliseum and he was just talking about

555
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:34,561
space.

556
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:36,690
Who's talking about I give no space,

557
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,280
I give no space.

558
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,270
He was talking about,

559
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,440
she was just so like,

560
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,940
it's such an intense dude,

561
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:42,361
you know,

562
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:43,320
like he was talking about,

563
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:43,621
you know,

564
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:46,110
like his philosophy on
Jujutsu very simple.

565
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:50,940
We started zero and from zero we're
going to one and we're not going back to

566
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:51,774
zero.

567
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:56,160
And then from one we're going to
two from two to three to checkmate,

568
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,990
that's where we're going to go.

569
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,100
And I was like,

570
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,210
God damn,

571
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,110
you get the chills talking to him.

572
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,341
You're like,

573
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:07,200
I'm sitting here talking to
Hixon motherfucking Gracie
and he's given me like

574
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,070
some intense life philosophy
on how he strangles dudes.

575
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:11,491
You know,

576
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:11,851
he's like,

577
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:12,601
he's into it.

578
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:13,160
You know,

579
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,610
when we were watching all these fights,

580
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,620
he's breaking shit down and he watched
the Funai fight with him and Kunaki does

581
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,581
Hixon fights,

582
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:21,120
man.

583
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,481
God,

584
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,440
I wish there were more of them.

585
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,950
So annoying man.

586
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,190
So annoying that you don't get to see
the best suppose had representative ever

587
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:32,430
of Jujitsu and at the
time fighting those guys.

588
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:32,791
You know,

589
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,830
finding all mark Coleman's and you know,

590
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:37,890
all the fucking guys and everyone was
scared of Mark Carr and all that shit.

591
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,540
How fascinating would that have been?

592
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:39,980
Mad.

593
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,410
Yup.

594
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:40,741
Fuck.

595
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:41,670
That would've been awesome.

596
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,533
Damn.

597
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,550
That would freak me out.

598
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,443
It really would.

599
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,483
Um,

600
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,430
it would freak me out to sit
and hang out with Hixon Gracie.

601
00:16:51,431 --> 00:16:52,264
He's cool as fuck.

602
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,290
That would freak me out.

603
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,470
He's a super nice guys.

604
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,241
His son is cool.

605
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:55,511
It's fun.

606
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:58,180
Nobody else in Jujitsu
that would freak me out,

607
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:58,850
like kicks in.

608
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,683
You know what I mean?

609
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,760
Marcella Garcia,

610
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:01,390
to me,

611
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,320
Marcella Garcia is the number one
Jujitsu guy that's ever lived.

612
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,010
I think Marcella Garcia is the
number one guy that's ever lived,

613
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,383
you know?

614
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:10,870
Uh,

615
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,720
but Hixon wood is the most,

616
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,153
uh,

617
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:15,970
uh,

618
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,840
mystical

619
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,510
and rock star ish.

620
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:18,810
Yeah.

621
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,643
You know what I mean?

622
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,410
He's like,

623
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,110
motherfucker was incredible hulk.

624
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,011
You know what I mean?

625
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:25,860
You've shown the incredible hulk with
Ed Norton when Ed Norton is learning how

626
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:27,150
to calm and control himself.

627
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,830
Hixon Gracie slapping them in the face.

628
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:29,530
That's,

629
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,240
that's the man.

630
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,600
Yeah.

631
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,440
I would freak out

632
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,220
if,

633
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,520
if,

634
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,353
uh,

635
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,150
if like me and Hickson would,

636
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:37,740
you're sitting there talking to Jujitsu.

637
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,020
I mean it's not out of the question.

638
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:42,210
That might happen in the future for sure.

639
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,781
It might.

640
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:43,530
It might not.

641
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,363
I would love it.

642
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:44,850
I would,

643
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,210
that would be a fucking dream of mine
to hang out and talk to you Jitsu and

644
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:51,450
break shit to the core of the
people who don't know the history.

645
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:56,451
Eddie Bravo tapped Hickson's
brother boiler and a Abu Dhabi 2003,

646
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,090
and there's a giant upset when Eddie was
a brown belt and he caught him with a

647
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:02,850
triangle.

648
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:03,683
So there's like,

649
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,590
is it perceived animosity
sometimes because of that,

650
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,760
but there's nothing exists.

651
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:11,430
You've never been anything but
respectful of any of those guys.

652
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:11,731
You know,

653
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:12,564
it's just,

654
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,643
there's a,

655
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,740
I know that there were trying to do some
sort of a rematch with you and Heuler,

656
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,753
but uh,

657
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,241
yeah,

658
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:23,010
I guess that was badly or going to
happen is a promoter called or emailed me

659
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,790
last October,

660
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,330
right.

661
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,740
October or November.

662
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,750
And it was a guy that
I've done privates for.

663
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:31,584
I know who is,

664
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,660
and um,

665
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,900
he's really high up in Jujitsu in
the Middle East in Abu Dhabi and um,

666
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,710
they're putting together,

667
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,910
they were putting together a Nogi
world championship in Abu Dhabi.

668
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,380
They never had a Nogi one.

669
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:48,450
They're doing geeky world
championships out there,

670
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:49,440
but the Nogi ones,

671
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,350
they wanted to have one in April.

672
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,750
And they asked me if,

673
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,810
if they wanted to have me
and Heuler as a supermatch,

674
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,070
but they never contacted him.

675
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,420
They told him,

676
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,260
this is what happened.

677
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,850
Then I emailed him back and I'm like,

678
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,111
you know me,

679
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:06,240
I'm down to rematch boiler anytime.

680
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,560
I've always been down.

681
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,570
I've never been the one denying it.

682
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,950
I want one more match.

683
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:11,490
I want to try it.
