1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,030
Do do
hello world.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,950
What's up?
What's going on?

3
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:10,410
Rather than my man back from fucking
Canada back from Canada.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,870
Awesome.
What was that experience like for you?

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,530
Well,
that experience was,

6
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:18,480
besides doing mushrooms and running
around the woods by yourself.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,680
Experienced.
Exclude that or you can exclude that

8
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:24,900
from me.
That's like taking away of fighters.

9
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:28,260
Ability to talk about fighting.
We're up in Canada,

10
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,610
bear hunting and are we decided to do
mushrooms?

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,340
Go run off into the woods.
I had to check in.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,490
Know I understand it's on the right
path.

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,361
Yeah.
Yeah.

14
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:41,040
That was fucking.
It was powerful,

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,540
man.
Super powerful because bears,

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,870
as I was telling you,
bears have come to me and my visions.

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,080
Do An eyewash Osca and everything since
the drop from the very first time I was

18
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:50,820
doing,
I was Osca bears were coming to me and

19
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,320
teaching me lessons and I was talking to
him.

20
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,190
So what kind of lessons,
man?

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,500
The first time it came was the first
time I did it and I saw this bear and it

22
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:02,370
was wrapped up in all these chains and
it was struggling against these gold

23
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:04,140
chains.
It's like a Mr. t dot bear had like

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,040
fucking crown and these heavy gold
chains and he was stuck and I couldn't

25
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:12,450
move and the bear like stopped.
She was like kind of frantic trying to

26
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:15,240
get out of these chains.
He stops and looks at me and he goes,

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,780
I remember when I was just a bear and I
didn't have to worry about all this shit

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,800
and it was less than about the wealth
that we have can become like a prison

29
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,500
that holds us back.
It prevents us from being our true

30
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,230
nature with the bears.
True natures.

31
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:29,670
You'd be in a bear chasing after shit,
eating shit,

32
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:30,504
climbing trees.

33
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,960
But the wealth that had accumulated
prevented it from doing that.

34
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,920
What a bizarre weird.
Right?

35
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,070
Is that like what?
Who's teaching you that?

36
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:39,990
Like what,
what is that your imagination?

37
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:42,090
Is that like,
what's going on with that?

38
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,790
I know I have no idea.
And,

39
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,000
and that's,
you know,

40
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,280
it just appeared to me.
That's the funny thing.

41
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,680
Like it's so strange.
It feels real.

42
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:52,230
Like this is a spirit guide teaching it,
but it very well could be your

43
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:53,490
imagination.
But man,

44
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:57,360
I'm not that creative to think about a
bear and gold chains telling me a lesson

45
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:59,320
about wealth.
I have a thought on that,

46
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,970
that we look at the imagination and we
say,

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,740
oh,
he's just imagining things.

48
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,260
But everything in the world is from the
imagination.

49
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,910
Every building,
every airplane,

50
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:10,740
every car,
every piece of clothing,

51
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:13,440
every computer,
everything came out of the imagination.

52
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,333
Everything.

53
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,910
I think the imagination is something
really fucking weird.

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,300
And it.
I think we've somehow or another,

55
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,340
we've almost like,
no,

56
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:25,830
I don't want to say underestimated,
be underrated.

57
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,870
We put it into this weird little
category.

58
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,190
Like it's a silly thing.
Oh,

59
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:34,191
you're just imagining.
And that allows it to operate and by,

60
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,620
by underrating it or by undervaluing it,
it allows it to sort of roam free and do

61
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:43,710
all of it's work.
But it's responsible for creating

62
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:46,680
everything that we see the humans have
ever done in the world.

63
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,500
Yeah.
It gets interesting for me too,

64
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:53,370
and you think about these mythical
creatures like bigfoot and dragons and

65
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:55,230
things like that.
When we create them,

66
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:58,860
we actually create the light,
the neurons in our brain that form

67
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,010
around that memory and that

68
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,780
concept.
Even if we draw a monster,

69
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,120
we've actually created that monster on
unlike a micro scale inside our brain

70
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,750
and it's just we value this macro scale
of the world where it actually breeds

71
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:13,780
and lives,
but we're actually assembling light in

72
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:16,390
our brains to create that thing that
we're imagining.

73
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,890
You know,
it's just on a very,

74
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:21,130
very small level and it doesn't have the
freedom and flexibility,

75
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:24,580
but we are really truly creating
entities all the time.

76
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,490
Brian.
Yeah.

77
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,540
I've really wondered about that with
aliens.

78
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,630
Would that archetypical alien,
the iconic gray with the large black

79
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:37,240
eyes and the like.
That thing is real now.

80
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,320
It's a real thing whether or not you
ever meet one or whether or not one

81
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,290
exists in the physical state where you
could drag it in front of the national

82
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,740
enquirer photographers and get some good
shots of it.

83
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,180
It's a real thing and what I mean by
it's a real thing is if you do

84
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:54,040
mushrooms,
you'll fucking see them.

85
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,870
You'll you will see them and do.
Are you seeing them because you did

86
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,860
mushrooms and you're hallucinating,
or are you seeing them because we've

87
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:07,861
created this archetype that plugs into
the imagination easily and connects you

88
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:10,740
to this thing,
this,

89
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,620
this imaginary world or this world that.
See,

90
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,650
I don't even like the word imaginary
because like every time I've done a

91
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:18,700
psychedelic,
I don't.

92
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,910
I don't like that word imaginary because
to me it seems like it's some sort of a

93
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:28,810
frequency that you're tuning into.
We're a real world exists that you can't

94
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:31,420
bring back anything physical from.
Yeah.

95
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,733
You know what I mean?
Yeah,

96
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,790
and I feel like it's entirely possible
that what we think of as these,

97
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,750
these like gray aliens,
they're like a,

98
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,940
almost like a frequency of the universe
that you can tune into whether you're on

99
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,540
psychedelics or whether you're dreaming,
which is of course your brain producing

100
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,860
its own psychedelics.

101
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,310
Your brain produces dimethyltryptamine
while you're sleeping.

102
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,030
So these,
these things that we think of as being

103
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:03,031
like all these imaginary things like
aliens or bears that talk to you or

104
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:05,230
Hagens.
Yeah.

105
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,840
I wonder what the fuck that really is
all about.

106
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,850
I think you're really onto something
there,

107
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,400
but it seems like there's this archetype
of frequency,

108
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,840
like a dragon is a being of unlimited
power and we've imagined what that would

109
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:19,390
look like visually if that were an
animal,

110
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:22,750
what does it look like?
And a dragon just fits that so fucking

111
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:27,751
perfect with the wings and the Scales
and smaug from token.

112
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,380
Yeah.
And you're looking at that and like,

113
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,580
Oh yeah,
that fits that thing.

114
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,680
You know,
and you think about a cold,

115
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:36,160
dispassionate,
calculating machine that is dissecting

116
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,960
you like than,
Oh yeah.

117
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:40,560
Alien with the big eyes and the no nuts
that fits that

118
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,410
so that no vagina either.

119
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,430
They don't need that shit.
They just dispatched of it so that just

120
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,220
like we,
we create this visual representation of

121
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:52,420
this,
of this archetype.

122
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,530
Even Zeus,
Zeus should look,

123
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,040
look,
look like Zeus looks like we're good at

124
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,330
like the physical look of something to
this concept that is kind of very real.

125
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,790
Yeah.
We wouldn't trust Zeus if he had like a

126
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:09,230
dark goatee.
He's got to have a fucking white beard

127
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:11,150
and white hair.
He always says white hair.

128
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:12,680
Right.
Have you ever seen Zeus without white

129
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:13,280
hair?
Well,

130
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,600
I mean,
he turned into all kinds of shit.

131
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:18,710
He would turn into like a swan and rape
somebody and like golden missed and

132
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,120
rape.
Somebody was like a mass rapist was

133
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,020
constantly right,
but everybody.

134
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,360
It was the bill cosby of,
of ancient gods go in as a goal is

135
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,200
golden rain.
He raped somebody.

136
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,150
Got Pregnant as golden ring.
Wow.

137
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,220
That's rude.
Yeah.

138
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,470
Seriously.
What's the defendant?

139
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,820
Somebody as rain,
at least give them a heads up who

140
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:40,320
expects to go outside and just get raped
by the rain.

141
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,100
Good.
No.

142
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,620
It was also a convenient excuse.
If you got pregnant.

143
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,240
There was a sprinkle.
It was golden.

144
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:54,020
I think Zeus.
He's raping a dude there.

145
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,080
What's he doing that cutting off his
dad's Dick.

146
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,880
Oh,
good lawyers was the.

147
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,730
Was the titan.
They were always cutting off each

148
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:03,250
other's Dick and then they would throw
one,

149
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,820
think he threw one into the ocean and it
created some other tighten and cut his

150
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:11,330
own dad's Dick off.
Life was hard back then,

151
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,220
man.
That was a hard world.

152
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:14,180
Those people live.
Yeah,

153
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,250
for sure.
A bunch of Dick cut and assholes.

154
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,430
No doubt.
I really do wonder like what I mean,

155
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:23,280
there's,
it's,

156
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,111
it's,
it is,

157
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,060
uh,
an ent in empty wonder.

158
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:28,880
Like there's no end to it.
There's no way you'll ever going to

159
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,280
solve like no one's going to say,
oh,

160
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,350
we figured out exactly what's happening
when you tripping on mushrooms and here

161
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:38,150
is what it is and this is why,
you know,

162
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:41,150
you see these things and this is what
those things actually are.

163
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,910
And this is the part of your brain that
creates them and they're absolutely not

164
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:46,430
real.
Oh yeah.

165
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,320
Well,
there's the materialist reductionist

166
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:50,120
point of view,
like something that Sam Harris could

167
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:51,350
explain very well.
All right.

168
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:53,960
When you take psilocybin,
the default mode network and your brain

169
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:55,970
gets starved of blood which starves at
of oxygen,

170
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:58,730
which downregulates it,
allowing the other parts of your brain

171
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,870
to come forward,
like,

172
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,510
got it,
but then take some

173
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,380
and then see how that feels,
what that,

174
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,760
what comes through.
Yeah.

175
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:09,800
Well there's a chemical process,
right?

176
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,410
But then there's the experience and the
experiencing itself.

177
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:14,510
This is if you've heard me say this
before,

178
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:18,020
but this is kind of important.
The experience is exactly the same

179
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,740
whether or not it's in a physical form
or whether or not it's something that

180
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:25,400
happens to you while you're tripping the
experiences the same like if you have a

181
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:30,401
trip and during that trip you meet a
golden serpent that explains the

182
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:31,670
universe to you and it.

183
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,670
It explains that every single person is
in fact a representation of what we

184
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:43,721
think of as love,
love or or a God or creativity or some

185
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:48,941
divine force that is pushing forward
improvement and innovation and that that

186
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:55,010
is the reason why life today is so much
different than it was 30 years ago or 30

187
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,160
before that or 300 years before that.
It will constantly keep improving and it

188
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:02,150
is the way of the universe and that if
you.

189
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:06,720
If you have that in a psychedelic trip,
it's exactly the same as if it happens

190
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:11,340
to you.
Like if you go to a field and a dragon

191
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:16,341
rises out of a marsh and confronts you
with all of the problems of your

192
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:21,270
personality and all the mysteries of the
past and gives you an understanding and

193
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:25,530
a blueprint for how to move forward with
your life and then goes back in a swamp.

194
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,330
It's exactly the same as if you're
tripping.

195
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,930
Like the experience is the same.
Like whether like,

196
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:34,530
well we found the Dragon,
we've located him on gps and I look on

197
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:36,480
Google Earth.
You can see the dragon moving through

198
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:37,860
the marsh.
It's a real dragon.

199
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,860
It doesn't matter like physically if
it's a real dragon,

200
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,900
the experience is the same and the
impact that it has and that's the thing

201
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:49,830
that we're seeing now in these
scientific inquiries is that it's not

202
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:53,190
just you have this experience like go
into a movie and you come back out and

203
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:57,120
you're relatively the same afterwards.
These are having the lasting impacts and

204
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:01,410
the significant changes throughout a
lifetime that you would expect from a

205
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:05,220
huge event like you just described
happening in the real world because it

206
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:08,400
does feel real to you and the
information you're getting and the

207
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:09,420
experiences you have.

208
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,040
It changes you.
It's not like you put it in this dream

209
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:12,631
world like,
oh,

210
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:16,100
that was weird.
I saw this person naked in my dream,

211
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:17,290
but it's different.
You know,

212
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,910
that feels like kind of like random,
like you just shaken up some dice and

213
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,340
throwing it.
This stuff comes to you in a way that

214
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,340
just leaves a significant impact.
Yeah,

215
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:30,120
and the scientific reductionist point of
view is really important because we

216
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:34,650
really do need to understand what's the
chemical process that's going on in the

217
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:37,650
brain when you consume whatever pod,
whatever it is,

218
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,940
we need to understand.
I mean it's fascinating and it's

219
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,310
important for research and it's
important that science keeps moving

220
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,170
forward.
The greater and greater understanding of

221
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:49,620
the mind,
but it can't discount what is happening

222
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:51,450
as a human,
as a person,

223
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,284
as a,
as a,

224
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,290
as a,
an entity with consciousness.

225
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,720
What's happening during that experience
like you really you can really talk to

226
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:04,920
God really can meet him for sure.
I mean you and I've met them together

227
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,520
yet or met whatever the fuck we met,
whatever that is.

228
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,030
When you're in the DMT realm,
I don't know what that is,

229
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,950
but if there's a god that's cooler than
that holy shit,

230
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,100
and that's the thing.
It comes like the stories are not.

231
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,160
They're not inconsistent.
You'll go to these IOWASCA retreats.

232
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:26,130
You have 20 people and seven of them
will talk to God.

233
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,460
That's the same dude they're describing.
It doesn't matter what religion

234
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:32,310
background they come from.
You hadn't like pre discussed what this

235
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:35,070
notion is.
It's like the wisdom that comes through

236
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:38,400
from that element source or whatever you
want to call it God.

237
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:42,150
Or have you talked to mother earth that
the wisdom is all consistent and it's

238
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:43,050
weird that way.

239
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,620
You know?
It's like you never hear something like,

240
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,200
man,
that's strange.

241
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:49,320
It's really contradictory to what I what
he told me,

242
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,760
like to see some people given dmt,
like preferably the way strassman does

243
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:59,770
it cause strassman minus the anal plug
that made them think that aliens were

244
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:01,540
sodomized him.
There was an anal plug.

245
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,760
There was like an anal thermometer.
Oh,

246
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,160
check your core temperature.
Yeah.

247
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:06,100
That's not good.
Yeah.

248
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,190
It had everybody thinking that aliens
were raping them.

249
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,210
Zeus,
Zeus stuff.

250
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,870
Not the best idea.
Yeah.

251
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:11,681
Well is he.
Well,

252
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:12,880
there you go.
Like why?

253
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,890
Why is that?
Why are we thinking that aliens are

254
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:16,420
raping us?
Because there's something in your

255
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:17,920
breath.
It's obviously thermometer.

256
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,090
You're are you given knowledge of with
the mometer in your.

257
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,160
But before you go in there,
you are right.

258
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,720
Do they whisper in your ear?
I mean,

259
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:26,554
I don't know.

260
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,820
It's it.
The world itself is so fucking slippery.

261
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,500
You know,
they're just the world itself.

262
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,740
The idea that I'm looking at you through
my eyes were making noises with our

263
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:39,490
faces and somehow or another we're
translating this back and forth to each

264
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:42,670
other through this thing,
which is a microphone which works in a

265
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:45,490
way that neither new nor I can describe
to anybody.

266
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:46,810
Jamie.
Again,

267
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,430
it goes through these wires and it's
going wirelessly out into people's

268
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:52,001
phones.
I mean,

269
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:56,440
these people that are streaming it right
now live with their phone in their car,

270
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,580
driving around four g lte.
The fucking world is slippery as shit it

271
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:01,414
is,
you know,

272
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,420
it's amazing how fast we adapt though
humans are really good at adapting to

273
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,730
this new shit that comes in.
We almost adapt so fast that we take it

274
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:11,890
for granted way earlier than we should.

275
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,791
It's like,
oh yeah,

276
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,510
that thing.
Cool.

277
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,590
Got It.
Yeah.

278
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:18,460
There was an article about that recently
about how primate brains are sort of

279
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:23,461
predisposed to being able to adapt
incredibly quickly and that sort of

280
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:26,830
makes sense.
If you look at the wide variety of

281
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:29,740
cultures throughout the world and what
they think is normal,

282
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,370
what they accept,
like um,

283
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,550
those women in Africa that have those
giant plates in their lips.

284
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,000
Like how was like,
how did that get going?

285
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,050
Well the next that they will judge that
they stretched their necks out so far

286
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:46,990
and they have those things that they
couldn't support themselves.

287
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,651
Yeah,
there it is.

288
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:51,160
The primary brain is pre adapted to face
potentially any situation.

289
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,570
It's a really interesting article and
I'm not going to do a good job of it

290
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:56,950
without someone reading it,
but that's,

291
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,940
that's the title of it.
It's unfair.

292
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:00,850
[inaudible] dot org,
a p,

293
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:04,300
h,
a y s.org and it's the prime.

294
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,780
The title is the primate brain is pre
adapted to face potentially any

295
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:12,010
situation and it just talks about how
your brain sort of calculates potential

296
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:15,220
outcomes and all these different
variables that could possibly take

297
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,460
place.
So when it moves into that direction of

298
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,790
sorts of set the landscape.
When you look at how we developed and

299
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,100
you look at something like the genetic
bottleneck theory,

300
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:26,440
where these big cataclysms would happen
dramatically,

301
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:29,830
reduce the human population,
you're dealing with these macro changes

302
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:31,240
on a global level,
well,

303
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:34,840
the most flexible and adaptive are going
to survive the stubborn acids that are

304
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:35,261
like,
nope,

305
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:37,750
I'm not leaving my forte.
My Forte is my home.

306
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,790
This is a model and land like,
fuck that forest was burning in.

307
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,290
You got to go to the ocean.
You got to figure out how to fish quick.

308
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,980
There's food in the water,
figure out how to get that food on land

309
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:49,840
into your belly or you're not going to
make it.

310
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,220
You're not going to make it.
And those are the humans that have

311
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:55,730
survived.
So that trait will continue to be one of

312
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:59,930
the most important traits and obviously
it comes to the surface in these large

313
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,280
scale events.
Yeah,

314
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:04,010
that's why I've always laughed.
Like I told you a,

315
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,530
and I know you.
You rented a place there recently too.

316
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:10,220
I've rented a place in Malibu for awhile
on the beach and I'm like,

317
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,060
what the fuck kind of place is this like
you just banking.

318
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,170
That's something that's constantly
changing and moving and growing is going

319
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:20,960
to stick around long enough for your
investment to pan out,

320
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,970
you know,
because you made an investment.

321
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:27,500
Like these houses are worth fucking
millions of dollars and there's no yard

322
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,560
in the back because it's just the ocean
and without a doubt that ocean is going

323
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,300
to keep moving forward.
It's without a doubt.

324
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,380
It's just like,
how much time do you have?

325
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:40,640
It's like a long real estate game of
musical chairs.

326
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

327
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:45,680
I mean I was at the house and the waves
would hit underneath the house so hard

328
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:50,600
that the house would shake it around,
so it was like it was like a plan for am

329
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:54,800
high tide earthquake of the waves and
just like you're counting on the fact

330
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:58,910
that there isn't that rogue 15 footer
that comes in and just wipes out your

331
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:01,550
whole window.
I fucked up because the first day,

332
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:05,600
literally the first day we stayed there,
I got barbecued,

333
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,460
like barbecued on edibles and uh,
we were downstairs.

334
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,970
There's three floors to this house we
were renting in.

335
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:16,070
The first floor was literally the water
you would,

336
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,780
you could open the window and jump into
the water and it's a four foot drop and

337
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:21,680
I'm not exaggerating.

338
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,680
It's fucking ridiculous.
And in the daytime it looks so amazing.

339
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,490
It's so beautiful and Baloo and lovely
and the sea,

340
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:35,960
the birds and the waves are so gentle
and inviting.

341
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,040
But at nighttime in the dark,
it becomes a monster,

342
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,050
like giant,
dark,

343
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,800
black,
uncaring beast that will swallow you

344
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:50,600
whole and not give a fuck.
It's absorbed a billion people before

345
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:53,600
you.
It'll absorb you just as easy and you

346
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:56,060
realize the true nature of it.
When it's dark,

347
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,320
when it's dark,
you go,

348
00:16:57,321 --> 00:17:00,030
oh,
this is like another world like you're,

349
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,490
it's like as if,
if you could get a high rise and that

350
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,030
high rise could like hit the edge of an
alternative galaxy.

351
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,030
It's like if you,
if you could like climb on top of your

352
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:15,110
roof and throw rocks into the event
horizon of a black hole and they would

353
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,010
disappear into another galaxy and that's
almost what it's like.

354
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,000
It's like it's another world.
Yeah,

355
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,090
and the farther you get out into the
deep,

356
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,680
crazier it gets,
right?

357
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:28,700
Because there's no limit on the depth.
You're going over one of those chasms

358
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:32,000
that are miles deep and had no fucking
idea what animals are in there.

359
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,630
And that's where these ideas of these
crackings,

360
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,920
these beasts,
the deep would come because he plays

361
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,320
with our subconscious.
It's outer space,

362
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:41,900
but in our planet and underneath us in
the water,

363
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,330
you know,
so you're just looking at this like,

364
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,190
man,
something could definitely come up there

365
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,030
and eat me.
Especially,

366
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,800
you know,
you don't have enough vitamin C,

367
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,120
you're getting too much sun,
you're a little delirious.

368
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,960
Then all of a sudden you'd fucking seen
mermaids and sea monsters and shit.

369
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,520
Yeah,
yeah,

370
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,630
yeah.
They,

371
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,400
they found cracking suction cups.
What do they call those things?

372
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:04,110
What do they call the suction cups?

373
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,150
Tentacles.
It's just suckers.

374
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,700
They found them in a fossilized form,
but that would indicate something that's

375
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,290
well over 100 foot octopus,
so that was a real animal at one point

376
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,560
in time.
So this idea of the crack.

377
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,940
The problem with those things is when
they die,

378
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:23,730
they just die.
Like there are soft tissue animal.

379
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,000
All they have is a beak and that gets
absorbed by the ocean too.

380
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:31,710
So there's virtually no evidence other
than these fossilized suction cups they

381
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,040
found.
But when they found him,

382
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,110
they went,
Whoa,

383
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,080
Holy Shit.
Because you're talking about,

384
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,380
you know,
like fucking garbage can lids that are

385
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:44,460
suction cups and you just think like,
well how big is the fucking technical

386
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:46,440
man?
Jesus Christ.

387
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:48,580
It's like an aggressive garbage disposal
is.

388
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,110
That is all the tentacles.
Grab everything that is soft enough to

389
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:54,180
get chomped by that beat,
grab it,

390
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,360
push it in and smart as fuck and fast.

391
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,460
Well,
there was another article recently where

392
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:03,930
the scientists were saying that
essentially octopuses are aliens.

393
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,800
There is nothing like them.
They have more chromosomes and any other

394
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,200
observed animal.
They're different than any observed

395
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:15,201
animal be besides cuddle fish.
Their ability to rapidly adapt and

396
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:19,440
camouflage themselves to their
environment is unprecedented.

397
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,590
They change their texture,
they changed what they look like.

398
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,890
I had a Ramey warrant on who's a great
guy and he has a television show called

399
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:33,300
Apex Predator and one of his,
one of his a apex Predator episodes and

400
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,840
in his show he's a hunter and he used to
be on the show called Solo hunter where

401
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:41,460
he would go by himself with like a bunch
of cameras and just go deep deep into

402
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:46,461
the woods and hunt and sort of ics and
capture this experience in this really

403
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:50,940
remote forest is in a really cool way
because it was literally just him like

404
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:54,660
survivor man style with a few cameras
setup and hunting and then cooking the

405
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:58,890
food and eating it and heading back and
running into some weird difficulties and

406
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:01,080
dangers and strange animals while he's
out there too,

407
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,920
but he did an episode on octopus and he
came in and was talking to us about it

408
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,750
and it fucking blew my mind.

409
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,840
Add no idea.
I don't mean I was 47,

410
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,180
48 years old.
I had no idea that a fucking octopus

411
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:15,840
could do that.
They can change like that instantaneous.

412
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,520
I think I've told this story on here
before,

413
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:19,470
but I got to see one in Fiji and watch
this.

414
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:24,150
Virgin man hunt it and it was one of the
craziest experiences ever.

415
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,880
They were.
It was flowing over the coral and just

416
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,310
like you said,
half of his body would be one color,

417
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,990
half the other color.
It was fast.

418
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:34,770
It wasn't like it weighted because we
have a noise and chameleons in Texas.

419
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,150
They plant somewhere and there's some
weird color that they're not supposed to

420
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:43,050
be and then eventually they turn into
Brown for tree bark or green for the

421
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:45,690
leaves or whatever they're at,
but not an octopus man.

422
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:47,800
That shit is instant,
instantaneous.

423
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,040
And when he was fighting it,
so he eventually goes down,

424
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,890
their jams,
his hand in there and the octopus bites

425
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:55,840
and there's blood in the water was this
crazy struggle.

426
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:57,880
But eventually he jams his hand back in
there,

427
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,150
pulls the octopus out,
and when he was fighting with the

428
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:05,350
octopus on the surface,
the octopus knew to go for his airway.

429
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,560
Like it was wrapping,
kept wrapping its tentacles around his

430
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:11,890
mouth and his nose as he was trying to
get this thing off his head.

431
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,180
He knew exactly what he was doing.
It was pulling off so eventually

432
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,210
wrestles is snorkel free and starts
beating it to get it to calm down.

433
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,100
And he brought it to the shore and
barbecued it.

434
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:24,070
Now everybody else was just fucking
horrified at this show because it was

435
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,820
completely savage.
I mean it was the octopus trying to

436
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:32,821
choke the airway of this primate in this
primate being stronger and more

437
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:35,650
determined and using a snorkel is a
bludgeoned to,

438
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,070
to kill it so he could eat it.
I think I want to.

439
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,630
I like octopus is delicious,
but I think on my backend off that there

440
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,830
might be a little too fucking smart for
me to be eating them.

441
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,400
Yeah.
But that's,

442
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,160
you know,
that's again that bias that have of all

443
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:51,900
of the things.
Like if people say,

444
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:53,670
oh no,
this animals too intelligent to eat,

445
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,690
but there are a pescatarian when they're
probably eating the fuck out of some

446
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,070
octopus,
which are way smarter than deer.

447
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,150
That's a good point,
you know,

448
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:02,010
like,
so it's just a weird.

449
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,340
It's a whole weird dynamic that we have
of what we decide we should or couldn't

450
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:07,710
do.
And here's a good point for people that

451
00:22:07,711 --> 00:22:10,980
are vegans.
If you are a Vegan and you think you

452
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:16,070
need some form of protein other than I'm
like a look at this thing,

453
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,030
killing a shark.
Um,

454
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:22,590
if you need some sort of protein other
than I'm a ethically raised chickens,

455
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,650
eggs,
which is harmless and doesn't hurt

456
00:22:25,651 --> 00:22:27,120
anybody,
but um,

457
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:32,150
mollusks apparently there's a real good
argument that they are incapable of

458
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:33,660
feeling any pain at all.

459
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,880
They don't have any fear.
They have zero emotions,

460
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,580
zero reaction.
They have one instinctive reaction to

461
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:40,710
close their shell.
And that's it.

462
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,820
Like they're barely an animal.
Get you some cashew milk.

463
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:48,330
Clam Chowder,
clam chowder is got milk in it.

464
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,030
That's what I said.
Oh,

465
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,920
that's right.
Okay.

466
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,580
Cashew milk.
Have you had this?

467
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,450
No,
I just made it up with somebody to do it

468
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,950
in Austin right now.
Someone's opening up cash register,

469
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,880
clam chowder,
fucking food truck.

470
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,450
But like um,
like scallops,

471
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,480
scallops are probably the most delicious
food on the planet.

472
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,200
Like pound for pound.
Yeah,

473
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,600
they're right up there.
And if they're,

474
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,610
if they don't,
if they're just like a meat thing,

475
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,700
it's like essentially what I'm saying is
there are,

476
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,250
there are like,
you know,

477
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,920
how they have the scientists that are
developing meet in laboratory and dishes

478
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,930
there that with a hard shell,
like you can eat them convenient

479
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:29,130
packaging because I know a lot of vegans
that are absolutely nutritionally

480
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,053
deficient.

481
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,870
They're not getting enough vitamin D,
they're not getting enough d three,

482
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,600
they're not getting enough [inaudible].
They're definitely not getting enough

483
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,740
essential fatty acids unless they're
scooping coconut oil and almond butter

484
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:44,610
into their mouth everyday.
Cla different things and you know,

485
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,580
they,
they're committed to the cause and so

486
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:49,790
they're just physically not doing the
best because of it.

487
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,551
Yeah,
I mean,

488
00:23:50,551 --> 00:23:51,530
do you start,
you start,

489
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,830
as you've done,
you've talked about the intelligence and

490
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:56,120
plants.
You start looking at that and then

491
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:59,630
versus a mollusk they're way smarter
than a mollusk yeah.

492
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,680
Are Mollusks and plants.
They're possibly fairly equivalent,

493
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,640
you know,
so like the whole cause of,

494
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,600
of why you're not eating them gets a
little blurry when you start reading.

495
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,750
All right,
well plants are smart as shit and

496
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,470
mollusks are mollusks and they're
probably equivalent.

497
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:19,040
Just one has the ability to move
slightly more than the other one.

498
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,440
Yeah.
The movement thing is something that we

499
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:24,050
cling to.
What we essentially cleaned too is

500
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:27,560
things that are closest to us.
Like we really don't give a fuck about

501
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,960
fish.
Like we're worried about people killing

502
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:32,660
all the fish in the ocean.
We're worried about the police in the

503
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:35,240
ocean.
But when a little kid catching the fish,

504
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,480
you go,
you go and look at the instagram page,

505
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,490
there's no hate.
You know,

506
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:43,250
a little kid shoots a bear back the fuck
up.

507
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,050
You don't even want to read those
comments.

508
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,220
You know,
if something,

509
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,390
if someone eats a bear like,
well that's too close to a dog dogs.

510
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:53,660
My friend dogs are just like people.
Sally's my baby.

511
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:55,970
She's a dog.
And the bears just like sally and I

512
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:57,020
can't eat a bear.
Yeah.

513
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:58,780
It's just anthropomorphization.
Yeah.

514
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,090
Like just putting human traits on
different animals,

515
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:03,500
which I can totally see.

516
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,870
You know,
there's some animals that seem more

517
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,450
human,
like we recognize more attributes than

518
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,480
others.
Well,

519
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,510
I have a thing with wolves.
I,

520
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,070
I absolutely have some sort of a weird
anthropomorphization thing with wolves

521
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,900
were um,
you know,

522
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:21,380
I think there were like probably my
favorite animals ever.

523
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:23,030
There's the fucking coolest things of
all time.

524
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:23,864
They,
they,

525
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,960
they have these packs.
They mate for life,

526
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,590
they get together and fucking,
they have this social group,

527
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,910
they have this really complex method of
hunting where they communicate with each

528
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:37,310
other.
They howl out to each other and they

529
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,290
have like a roll call.
I mean,

530
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:42,230
there are complex,
really intense society.

531
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,880
Yeah.
I won't hold it against him that they

532
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:46,940
mate for life.
I'll excuse them.

533
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:50,060
That was pretty amazing because their
life is hard as fuck.

534
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:52,040
And it doesn't last long because you
can't be a pimp.

535
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,260
But apparently there's a documentary
about a wolf and ironically enough to

536
00:25:57,261 --> 00:26:00,440
call it the black wolf.
And there was a black wolf that

537
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:05,470
apparently wasn't following any of the
rules and this wolf would go across the

538
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:08,810
highway,
away from the rest of the pack and lure

539
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:12,500
the women over to him.
And he was banging these women and

540
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,420
female wolves,
obviously not women,

541
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:16,880
human.
I'm really anthropomorphizing now.

542
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,730
Um,
and,

543
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,250
and then protecting actual bitches.
Yeah.

544
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,090
And wouldn't the right way of saying it
and wouldn't mate in,

545
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:29,570
wouldn't like find a mate for life until
he was old.

546
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,480
And then when he's old as are,
I'll come back and start running shit.

547
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,240
And then when he's old he came back,
got a mate,

548
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,030
started running things and just sort of
settled down.

549
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,360
But it was interesting.
It's like this wolf had chosen a

550
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:44,250
different way of life.
And it's a documentary

551
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,900
on it.
It's interesting because,

552
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,340
you know,
in,

553
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,860
in all of these Iowasca trips and all of
these things,

554
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,680
I've talked to animals of all kinds of
variety.

555
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:54,450
And again,
this could be just pure imagination,

556
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:55,820
but in that,
you know,

557
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,800
they always have lessons or things that
we discussed.

558
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:03,310
And one of the common themes is the
amount of freewill that the animal hat.

559
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:05,340
So when I talked to the insects and you
really talk,

560
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,920
you don't talk to one insect,
you talked to the insect over mine.

561
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,990
Again,
this could all just be my imagination,

562
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:13,650
but it helps me understand things a bit.
You talked to the insect over mine and

563
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:17,310
the insects say basically we are like
the trash keepers of the,

564
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:19,650
of the world.
Like we have no flexibility for

565
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:21,630
freewill.
If we all decided to go on strike,

566
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:22,740
the world's fucked,
you know,

567
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,910
nothing gets decomposed.

568
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,580
There's no spare parts.
We run out of spare parts for the world.

569
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,200
Everything.
Nothing else gets built.

570
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:30,810
The whole thing goes to shit.
The food source at the very bottom,

571
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,000
so we have no freewill,
were perfect,

572
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,500
perfect creatures acting in perfect
accordance with the laws of nature to

573
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:39,930
allow it to happen.
Where you get these things like the

574
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:41,820
atomic automatons,
like the digger wasps.

575
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:43,410
But no matter how much you fuck with
thing,

576
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,120
they'll try to do the same thing over
and over again.

577
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,820
Well really that's,
that's perfect because it's doing

578
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,750
absolutely what it must and then you go
on up the up the chain towards the

579
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:55,200
mammals and there's gets to be greater
and greater access to free will.

580
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:58,200
So you talked to like I've talked to
dolphins and dolphins.

581
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:01,410
Spirit was like super happy,
playful and they said,

582
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,131
you know,
dolphins,

583
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:06,090
one of the best existence of all because
we have greater access to free will,

584
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:08,280
we can choose to play,
we can choose the fuck,

585
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:10,440
we can choose these different elements.

586
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,140
Getting food is easy and it's also how
easy it is to get food.

587
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:15,210
Like getting food is easy for us,
you know,

588
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:18,540
there's not a lot of natural predators,
so we have kind of the ultimate

589
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,940
existence and we don't have the human
brain,

590
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:23,150
which is the ultimate Sabbath tour.
You know,

591
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,850
it's our own minds that lock us in.
These depressions and anxieties and

592
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:30,960
hell's and dolphins don't have that
level of self awareness that they've

593
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:33,330
created all the problems.
So it's almost like they're in this

594
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,590
perfect sweet spot,
which is one of the things that you feel

595
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,890
when you encounter in both in real life
and envision is that they're just happy

596
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:44,310
as fuck because they have the most
flexibility with the least amount of

597
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:45,390
troubles that come from it.

598
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,300
Yeah.
We were talking about this on the,

599
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,250
on the ride when we were in Edmonton,
Alberta Rather.

600
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:55,250
And it was really interesting because we
were talking about,

601
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:00,080
was it Ben O'brian that was telling us
about a queen that got stuck in

602
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:02,570
someone's car queen bee.
They got in a car,

603
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:07,160
a queen bee got stuck in someone's car
and the colony followed them for like 20

604
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:11,850
miles,
some insane amount of distance and you

605
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,190
know,
this guy was just getting fucking

606
00:29:13,191 --> 00:29:15,560
followed by bees and couldn't figure out
what the hell was going on.

607
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,990
Well,
they had a mandate.

608
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,600
There was,
there was no freewill.

609
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,020
There was no discussion whether or not
I'm tired of fine.

610
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,090
Like they were just going to fly to the
end and they flew and found this guy's

611
00:29:29,091 --> 00:29:33,410
car with the fucking queen in it.
And I don't know how it got resolved but

612
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,280
how they knew

613
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,180
exactly.
But yeah,

614
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,910
that's,
it follows that that would be the,

615
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,950
that would be the behavior because
these,

616
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,360
they don't have the flexibility to do
that because everything would fall

617
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:44,051
apart.
You know,

618
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:47,710
they're like the perfect robots of,
of life.

619
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,551
And I think,
you know,

620
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:52,120
you start talking about these
distinctions between life and,

621
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,130
you know,
artificial intelligence life.

622
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,640
I think really consciousness and
freewill are inexorably linked.

623
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,600
Like that is kind of the key component.
You know,

624
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,660
like yes these insects are alive,
but are they fully conscious?

625
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,300
You know,
while I think it really depends on their

626
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:09,430
access to free will,
their ability to make a choice.

627
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:12,970
I think that is the defining
characteristic of consciousness is

628
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:13,804
choice.

629
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:18,830
Well that's another weird thing about
people that are really into animals.

630
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,110
Like we'll,
we'll make a distinction between animals

631
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,630
and insects.
Like I have friends that just fucking

632
00:30:24,631 --> 00:30:27,450
love animals.
They adopt dogs and cats and.

633
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,570
But they'll fucking kill any bug.
It's on their counter.

634
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,380
Know this.
They'll see a bug or other counter.

635
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:35,370
They just,
Oh you bitch,

636
00:30:35,371 --> 00:30:36,720
you're dead.
Could be random.

637
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:40,470
Harmless beetle over,
it's like a mosquito lands on them.

638
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,020
Slap,
you know,

639
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,340
there's no negotiating with.
With insects.

640
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,970
We find an insect but they won't eat
them,

641
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,380
which is weird.
You know,

642
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,750
it's one of those weird things.
Cricket protein bars.

643
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,680
Yeah.
Well,

644
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,520
you know,
they just.

645
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,820
Vegans don't eat bugs.
They don't need animal protein.

646
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,250
They're responsible for the death.
Listen,

647
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,010
I'm not trying to put this on you guys.
If you're a Vegan,

648
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,720
you know,
if you buy grain from a store,

649
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:11,010
you are directly responsible for the
death of countless bugs.

650
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,010
Countless rodents.
Who knows how many rabbits.

651
00:31:14,011 --> 00:31:17,550
Who knows how many deer fonds.
If you buy anything that is

652
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:21,870
indiscriminately collected with a
combine and that's how they get grain.

653
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,750
They have these huge machines.
If you've never seen it before,

654
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,680
Jamie,
pull up a grain combine inaction because

655
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:29,850
it's like,
whoa.

656
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:34,680
That is some alien machine sent down to
sheer the earth.

657
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,840
This is,
it's kind of fucking.

658
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:38,240
It's a weird way we do it.
I mean,

659
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,190
we used to do it with like the grim
reaper sickle,

660
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,960
you know,
that's how they used to do at that cool

661
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:45,700
thing with the two handles on it.
Is that what it is aside?

662
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,360
What's the definition of sickle and
aside sickles?

663
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:49,320
The Russian thing,
right?

664
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,240
Yeah.
I think what does that one smaller one.

665
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:55,260
It's a handheld jammy
the.

666
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,510
When they use those things,
it's really,

667
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,250
it's that that's only one aspect of one
of the things that's problematic about

668
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:06,720
large scale collecting of food,
but look at this fucking thing.

669
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,410
This enormous machine,
and this is not even a big one.

670
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,220
That's a fairly small one.
They have ones that are like a football

671
00:32:14,221 --> 00:32:14,941
field.
Why?

672
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:15,980
At the mega farms?
Yeah.

673
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,500
This is like something like if you had a
small farm you would do,

674
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:22,710
but anything that's in there is getting
chewed up.

675
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:26,220
And one of the things about fonts,
it's really unfortunate,

676
00:32:26,221 --> 00:32:31,080
but fonds when they're young,
they will lie down in these fields and

677
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:34,470
they don't move because they can't run.
They can't run any predators.

678
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:38,100
So their strategy is to just not move
and hope something doesn't find them.

679
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,650
Yeah.
And that's why

680
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,470
they have those,
uh,

681
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,340
the coloration on their bodies very
different.

682
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:46,970
They have the white spots,
which is kind of a nature's version of

683
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:49,130
some sort of form of camouflage to blend
in.

684
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,960
But those poor fonds get chewed up in
those things all the time.

685
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:58,961
I have a friend who was a,
he is a large scale corn farm in

686
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,970
Illinois and they,
you know,

687
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,630
they make a corn for mostly for
livestock.

688
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:08,000
They grow corn for livestock and they
have those giant,

689
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:10,850
huge ones and they just chew fonds up
all the time.

690
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,470
I think the problem that a lot of people
make is they attribute morality to the

691
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:18,830
actions you're taking rather than the
intention behind it.

692
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,520
You know what I mean?
And I think people make that mistake a

693
00:33:22,521 --> 00:33:25,280
lot really.
So it's hunting good or bad.

694
00:33:25,281 --> 00:33:27,550
Well that's a,
that's a ridiculous question to ask.

695
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:31,010
It depends on the intention of the
hunter while he's doing it.

696
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,230
You know,
and I think that's why a lot of people

697
00:33:33,231 --> 00:33:37,610
reserve this kind of native American
idea because we feel and we understand

698
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:42,611
that the intentions of that person,
that hunter was in a way that was

699
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:45,420
different than the guy just looking to
put a trophy on as well,

700
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,350
right?
One of those automatic guns that are on

701
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:53,351
a camera that shooting animals that way,
it's not the act that's either good nor

702
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:56,030
bad,
nor is it Vegan good nor bad.

703
00:33:56,031 --> 00:34:00,050
It's about the intentions behind it.
And I think people tend to lose that

704
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:00,890
perspective.
You know?

705
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:02,840
So that's when,
when I was in bear camp,

706
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,680
that's what I needed to get straight is
what my intentions were.

707
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:10,940
If I was going after the hunt a bear.
So I would be cool and cam would think I

708
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:13,370
was cool and everybody in the hunting
party would be like,

709
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:15,260
yeah,
well that was the wrong intention for

710
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:15,470
me.

711
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,590
So that's what a lot of the work was.
That's what the part of what the taking

712
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:22,220
the mushrooms was for was to make sure
that my intention in doing it was the

713
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:25,310
right intention and that you know,
and what was that intention?

714
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:27,770
Well,
to me it was some part meet acquisition.

715
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:31,880
I wanted to have that experience of
taking my own meat from the field,

716
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:35,150
which was incredibly powerful for me the
first time I wanted and then I wanted to

717
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:38,060
have to be able to use the code and use
the,

718
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:41,450
the clause for jewelry and really
connect with that.

719
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:44,540
But you know,
so that if that intention was leading,

720
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,050
then it was a correct action for me.
If that intention was not leading and I

721
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:50,150
was doing it to be cool,
they're doing it because I was nervous

722
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:53,750
or any other way,
then it wasn't immoral act for me and

723
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:55,670
that's to me how I just kind of sorted
it out.

724
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:59,950
So I was able to get to that comfortable
place where I knew that I.

725
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,930
If the bear came the right,
the right bore came,

726
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,900
I was going to do it for the right
intention because I'd worked through all

727
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:09,740
of the other forces and pressures that
desire to be cool or the desire for

728
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,600
this.
There are all these other reasons that

729
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,160
would have made that act.
Not Cool.

730
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,290
You know,
I've worked through those as best I

731
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,390
could.
And so I knew if the bear came,

732
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:21,590
I was comfortable killing and I had no
idea in my head that this was the wrong

733
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:25,340
thing because my intentions were right.
Well also your intentions.

734
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,140
I mean,
you had many opportunities to kill a

735
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:32,141
bear as it I totally.
But what we go for is very big mature

736
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:35,450
bears for a couple reasons.
One,

737
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,100
because very big mature bears kill cubs.

738
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,770
Um,
it's one of the favorite things to eat

739
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,050
when they come out of hibernation,
which is really fucked up.

740
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,920
They actively hunt cubs that go for
them.

741
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,140
They even go into dance and pulled them
out of Dan's and kill them.

742
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,860
There's a lot of debate as to why they
do that.

743
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:57,060
The initial thought was that it brings
the female back into estrous and that

744
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,590
the bear can breed with the female and
that way that bears passing on his

745
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:04,520
genetics,
but there's some scientists and

746
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:09,090
biologists and wildlife biologists that
believed that just doing it for meat and

747
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:12,450
it's just there's a lot of competition
out there and it's hard to get meat and

748
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:15,360
this is meat and they've gotten
accustomed to it and whether they're

749
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:20,361
doing it because they're hungry or
whether they're doing it because they

750
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:25,110
want the female to survive a and or a
come back into heat and breed again.

751
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,650
Either way they're they're killing cubs
and they're limiting the DNA.

752
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:33,651
They're limiting the genetics and it's
not good for the overall population of

753
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:37,890
the bears.
So the idea is when you kill the large

754
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,660
male bores that what you're doing is
you're actually enhancing the genetics

755
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:45,900
of the area and you're saving the cubs.
So,

756
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,720
you know,
it seems counterintuitive.

757
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,880
When you kill bores,
you're actually increasing the

758
00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:52,410
population of bears.
Yeah.

759
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,330
It's really weird when you,
when you,

760
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,880
you know,
when you look at it outside of the world

761
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,650
of hunting,
when you don't have all the information

762
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,750
at your fingerprints,
you,

763
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,860
you have this idea that like hunters are
like those bad guys in that wolverine

764
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:07,080
movie that we're poisoning the bear.
Did you ever see that?

765
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,810
They're always in the movies.
They're always the assholes that are

766
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,000
killing bears,
you know,

767
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,140
meanwhile wolverine,
we'll sit down and eat a steak and he's

768
00:37:13,141 --> 00:37:13,974
a good guy.

769
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,620
Very were,
were so fucking torture.

770
00:37:16,621 --> 00:37:18,960
Didn't and twisted when it comes to our
morality.

771
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,650
But the,
uh,

772
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:25,170
also the big one is the population of
the traditional game.

773
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:28,020
Animals like the Moose and the deer and
the elk.

774
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,830
They get decimated by bears and it's the
Fonz.

775
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:34,980
They kill all the fonts and the,
all the calves.

776
00:37:34,981 --> 00:37:39,981
And that's a huge problem in those
regions like Alberta where we were,

777
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:42,510
which is just overrun with bears.
I mean,

778
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:46,080
have you ever imagined you're going to
see that many bears in the first night

779
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:48,030
we were out there,
there was eight,

780
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:52,590
nine different barriers just cruising
around crazy all within five to 15,

781
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:54,240
20 yards.
Crazy.

782
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,320
It was insane.
You know,

783
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:59,220
one of the stories that Cam told I think
gave me one of the biggest lessons and

784
00:37:59,221 --> 00:38:04,110
takeaways of the trip for me was the one
who told about there was a mother with

785
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:07,250
her cubs and the cubs were kind of
cruising around and then a,

786
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:12,090
a big male bear came in and then killed
one of the cubs and I think the mother

787
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:15,630
like scared her off,
scared off the bore and it was just a

788
00:38:15,631 --> 00:38:17,190
dead cub that she had there.

789
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:22,550
And so for a moment the mother kind of
wanders around and looked like she was

790
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:24,390
like,
mourning the death of this cup,

791
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:26,910
but just for a moment.
And then within minutes,

792
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,980
you know,
seconds it was eating.

793
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:32,520
The cub was eating her own cup and that
was like a really,

794
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,190
you know,
we humans have this idea of this trauma

795
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,010
we carry,
like

796
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,470
if our,
if our kid got got killed,

797
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,390
you know,
we would carry that trauma for the rest

798
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:41,500
of our life.
But for the bear,

799
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,420
yeah,
there was a moment of recognition,

800
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,030
but bears are constantly living in the
present moment.

801
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:49,480
They're like the embodiment of the
present moment and in the present moment

802
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,940
that death happened in the past,
that death was over.

803
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,060
What's there now is there's meat on the
ground that'll feed her and provide an

804
00:38:57,341 --> 00:39:00,210
opportunity for her to live longer and
provide for the rest of her cubs.

805
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:03,940
So it's a simple decision at that point,
if we don't carry the traumas of our

806
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,040
past with us,
there's meat on the ground.

807
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,050
You eat the meat,
you know that simple,

808
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,460
that simple thing.
And that's in that way it's wide.

809
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:15,250
Like nature is really perfect because
nature is always in the present moment.

810
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,620
You know,
like I was blasted on the mushrooms and

811
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:21,130
I went to that bear carcass near where a
cam and killed his bear.

812
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:23,260
They had this just decomposing bear
carcass,

813
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,150
which you know,
taking mushrooms and seeing a

814
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:26,640
decomposing bear carcass with.

815
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,520
Well,
it wasn't really that decomposing like

816
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:32,130
was it one night,
but that was one from a week before.

817
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,520
Yeah,
it was like there was another one that

818
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:37,460
they've already taken all the skin and
all the meat off of,

819
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:42,200
so it's just the bones in the organs
that were there and cam had his.

820
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,420
His bear is still nice,
wasn't even smelling or anything.

821
00:39:44,421 --> 00:39:48,080
It looked great fresh,
but this other bear which was right in

822
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:51,870
the same area.
It was really interesting because I was

823
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,020
very aware of the forest around it and I
just looked at the forest around it and

824
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,080
the forest was not mourning the death of
the bear,

825
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,030
the foresters in the present moment.
It was just going about the business of

826
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:06,590
returning that bear to spare parts.
It had no traumatic memory of that

827
00:40:06,591 --> 00:40:10,580
incident and it's really how,
how nature works perfectly because it's

828
00:40:10,581 --> 00:40:14,630
always in the present moment like this.
The body doesn't weep for the death of a

829
00:40:14,631 --> 00:40:15,464
cell.

830
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,290
Cells die all the time,
but the bodies in the presence so it

831
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,110
just carries on.
It doesn't carry that trauma with it,

832
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,450
you know,
and ultimately the forest doesn't.

833
00:40:23,451 --> 00:40:27,500
We've for the death of the bear and
ultimately the cosmos won't weep for the

834
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:29,480
death of the earth.
When the sun explodes.

835
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,350
No,
you know,

836
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:33,550
like everything will just be in the
present and that's,

837
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:37,670
that's where you know this,
the ease of all the suffering is so much

838
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:41,300
of our own suffering is we're carrying
all these dead bodies of the past with

839
00:40:41,301 --> 00:40:45,440
us all the time and these expectations
of the future and that's where we get so

840
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:47,750
fucked up,
but if we really look to nature,

841
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:52,070
nature has this allure and this beauty
because it's just constant presence and

842
00:40:52,071 --> 00:40:54,290
body.
It's just looking on the bleeding edge

843
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:58,400
of now and making decisions based upon
that rather than these mental

844
00:40:58,401 --> 00:40:59,234
constructs.

845
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,680
Yeah.
It's this beautifully intense system

846
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:05,610
that's just constantly moving.
It's just constantly moving forward.

847
00:41:05,611 --> 00:41:09,450
It's one of the things that I find so
attractive about wolves and I think many

848
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:12,380
people do this.
They're so romantic in that their,

849
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:17,160
their existence is so vibrant and
powerful and so brief.

850
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,180
You know,
if a wolf is super lucky,

851
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:21,070
they get to 10.
You know?

852
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,250
I think getting managed imagined.
I mean,

853
00:41:23,251 --> 00:41:25,890
my,
my middle daughter's eight years old,

854
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,850
like wrap your head around that.
A wolf is like almost dead.

855
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,920
Like I have a dog that's 10.
He's almost done.

856
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:32,860
You know,
he's,

857
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:37,040
he's got gray all over his face and he
limps when he walks now and he likes to

858
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:39,040
lay down mostly,
you know,

859
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,430
that's,
that's a wolf man.

860
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,230
Ten years,
that's all they get.

861
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,960
But during that 10 year,
fuck they live.

862
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,170
Yeah.
They just run in howland together and

863
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:49,130
grabbing the back.

864
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,720
I mean,
that's one of the crazy things about

865
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:55,721
wolves to that I admire in some sort of
a real fucked up way that they kill for

866
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:58,940
fun.
Like they sport kill,

867
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,480
you know it.
It's people that love animals.

868
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:04,910
When you bring that up,
they defended to the death.

869
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,930
Oh my God.
They go off about it and know whether

870
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,830
the animals were probably sick and
they're taking them off.

871
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,760
Nope.
They're having a fucking blast.

872
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,190
They're running around and tearing these
elka part.

873
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,230
Like we were talking about it a couple
of weeks ago.

874
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:22,370
They found 19 dead elk that these wolves
didn't even eat.

875
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:25,490
They call them surplus kills.
They just go on rampages,

876
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,780
you know,
I have a,

877
00:42:26,781 --> 00:42:30,260
um,
a friend of mine who lives up in BC and

878
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:34,400
he said they'll get into like sheep,
like they'll find like a pen of sheep

879
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:36,320
and they'll kill 19,
20 of them.

880
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,810
They just rip them apart.
They don't give a fuck.

881
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,910
They don't give a fuck.
They're just having fun.

882
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,770
It's part of what they are that like we
have this like intense romantic

883
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,920
connection to wolves is like they have a
little bit of us and um,

884
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,470
they have a little bit of party in them.
You know,

885
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,800
they're the towel in and shit and having
a good old time and they have battles

886
00:42:57,081 --> 00:42:59,330
with each other to see who becomes the
king,

887
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,960
you know.
So did you see that video recently of

888
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:07,790
these folks were in Canada and they were
driving down the highway and as they

889
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:12,791
were driving they saw these mountain
goats running or sheep running away from

890
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:18,590
a wolf and the wolves chasing them and
the wolf tackles the fucking sheep and

891
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:21,050
kills it instantly.
Right in front of them.

892
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,560
It's always fucking Canada.
Like that Martin that killed the bear.

893
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,770
See if you could find it though,
because it's pretty cool and it's pretty

894
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,220
cool to see wolf takes out a sheep
mountain,

895
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,620
rocky mountain sheep.
But the,

896
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:37,460
when the wolf took out the sheep,
he carries this thing up the side of the

897
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:40,520
hill like you would carry like a five
year old.

898
00:43:40,521 --> 00:43:43,130
Yeah.
And it's like things like basically his

899
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:46,250
size and he just grabs it with his face.
Here it is.

900
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,560
See these,
uh,

901
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,570
see he breaks away well back up a little
bit.

902
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:53,150
So you could see and give us some
volume.

903
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,400
Look at this.
It breaks off and watch this Bam bitch.

904
00:44:01,401 --> 00:44:03,680
That's a wrap.
Rips it apart.

905
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,870
Instantly.
Look at that instant death.

906
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:09,740
I mean,
there's no quicker kill in a wolf and a

907
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:11,280
sheep.
I mean it's,

908
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:11,990
it's,
it's,

909
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:15,170
it's still breathing,
but its neck had snapped and it's done.

910
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,820
Fucking beautiful animal.
That wolf is now watch when he grabs it,

911
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:21,260
he's like,
get over here,

912
00:44:21,261 --> 00:44:22,590
bitch.
Look at this.

913
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,250
Don't open that window too wide.
Yeah.

914
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:29,900
He might come and get you a bitch.
Boy,

915
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:31,800
he probably wouldn't know.
He's got that right there.

916
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,210
People probably tastes like shit.
Tastes like cheetos and cigarettes.

917
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,720
The fucking animals.
Just.

918
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,330
It's such a fucking majestic animal.
I think that's why we have such an

919
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,500
allure to it and people love animals so
much is because they're not carrying

920
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:53,310
around all the bullshit that we are.
They're just living full and presently,

921
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:57,000
and they're not straddled with these
concepts of morality in these

922
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:59,130
differently.
They're just living to the most of their

923
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:01,110
directive.
It's in the present.

924
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:04,170
You have the idea of eternity with you.
It's like there's.

925
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,180
You're not worried about this other
stuff,

926
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:11,181
so they you just go and you just fucking
live to the very fullest and we can

927
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:14,370
count those moments that we have is our
best moments in life,

928
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,520
you know,
and we can recall maybe dozens of times

929
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,860
if we're lucky,
they'll be hundreds of times in those,

930
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,430
in a normal person's life where they're
just totally present,

931
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,670
embodied,
free doing exactly what they fucking

932
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:27,360
want to do.

933
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,770
Yeah.
And in a lot of ways,

934
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:32,370
the world that we've constructed,
the modern world with social media and

935
00:45:32,371 --> 00:45:37,371
with constantly being inundated with new
new stories that have almost nothing to

936
00:45:38,941 --> 00:45:41,280
do with you there on the other side of
the world,

937
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:42,960
you know,
someone got shot on the other side of

938
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:45,390
the planet.
Someone fell off of a mountain.

939
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:47,340
You know,
this guy who died in a fiery car

940
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:51,420
accident a thousand miles from you.
I mean all this stuff is like constantly

941
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:54,480
going on.
It's constantly coming at you and it

942
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:57,630
makes it really difficult to focus on
the actual life that you're living.

943
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,310
I mean,
we almost get,

944
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,860
are getting too much data.
I think that's,

945
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:04,770
that's one element,
but I think the more toxic element is

946
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:06,690
the look at me element,
which is the,

947
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,920
here's what I'm doing at this time,
here's me snapchatting this because it

948
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:11,820
puts above.

949
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,600
Take a picture of you and put it on
instagram saying that it puts,

950
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:20,570
it puts the awareness of other people
watching you into the forefront of your

951
00:46:20,941 --> 00:46:21,960
mind,
you know,

952
00:46:21,961 --> 00:46:24,360
so like right now that was a fucked up
smile.

953
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:28,080
I just gave her that because I was
thinking about you taking a picture of

954
00:46:28,081 --> 00:46:29,770
me.
So I changed my behavior.

955
00:46:29,771 --> 00:46:32,070
It wasn't handed,
it wasn't normal and that's what we're

956
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:33,370
doing constantly.
We have,

957
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,850
we have this idea that everybody's
looking at us and we're,

958
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,000
we're like,
we're really are the stage actors.

959
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:42,690
And that was that famous line from
William Shakespeare.

960
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,700
We all but actors in the world is a
stage.

961
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:49,620
Well with social media it becomes that
we're always just acting and playing

962
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:52,050
this role.
That's not our authentic self.

963
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:56,070
Like bear down asked on the grass like
what the fuck is this thing?

964
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:59,480
Let me get back in touch with the monkey
and figuring out what feels good for

965
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:00,360
him,
what I want to do,

966
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,510
and it becomes your world like it might
not be your world,

967
00:47:03,511 --> 00:47:05,790
but it becomes your world when,
when you're one of those,

968
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:07,830
uh,
Yoga booty girls that just sticks her

969
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:09,870
ass up in the air for all our instagram
pictures.

970
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,520
Now God bless him.
God bless him.

971
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:13,050
Thank God.
Thank God they're out there.

972
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,340
But when,
when there's a gal like that that has 5

973
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,040
million instagram followers and her
notifications are constantly coming in

974
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:23,130
and she's checking her likes and damn
girl,

975
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,570
you hot damn girl,
you find,

976
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:25,980
oh shit,
can I get with you?

977
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:29,040
And they're looking at all their
comments and getting all that love,

978
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:33,100
all that attention.
Then that becomes them and then mean.

979
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:35,710
I mean,
I would hope that they're well rounded

980
00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:38,740
and they also read books and they also
do a lot of other things and they

981
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:40,810
meditate and take yoga and really get
it,

982
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,400
but it's highly likely they don't.
It's highly likely that they just stare

983
00:47:44,401 --> 00:47:49,180
at the pictures of their own ass and go
back to the gym for the second time in a

984
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,870
day and do dead lifts and just fucking
fat that ass up and thinking about

985
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:55,500
getting fat injected into it and like,
oh right.

986
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,690
Yeah.
What people fail to realize is that that

987
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,560
in itself is a pressure and that
pressure needs a response of equal

988
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:05,840
magnitude in order to balance here.
It's like all of these people with,

989
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:06,880
with fame,
you know,

990
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,390
especially fame that you really didn't
work that hard for,

991
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,090
you know,
and so I think where we're athletes and

992
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,980
just kinda just celebrities,
pop culture,

993
00:48:14,981 --> 00:48:18,770
celebrities are instagram celebrities
have a little bit of a different feel

994
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:22,770
because that athlete knows all the
fucking quiet moments like steph curry

995
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:26,980
knows all of those hundreds of thousands
of shots he took when nobody was

996
00:48:26,981 --> 00:48:30,610
watching and dribbling around and
practicing and practicing.

997
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:33,790
So when he gets out there,
his what he's doing and what he's known

998
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,980
for,
it makes sense and it's solid.

999
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:39,190
It's grounded in something,
but all of a sudden you have a great ass

1000
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:41,850
and the ability to take a decent photo
and you're,

1001
00:48:41,851 --> 00:48:43,870
you've got the reach of 5 million
people.

1002
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,290
I think that amount of pressure really
fucks with you and you have to take

1003
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,700
extreme measures to counteract that and
to get yourself back grounded again.

1004
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:53,710
More time in nature,
meditation,

1005
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:57,130
float tank eating,
we'd whatever you want to do,

1006
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,220
you know,
find that other thing to counteract

1007
00:49:00,221 --> 00:49:02,710
that.
Recognize it for what it is and,

1008
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,930
and don't just look at the positive
aspect of it.

1009
00:49:04,931 --> 00:49:07,870
Look at the negative that it's having
because I think if you don't,

1010
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,540
we see the effects of that all the time.
We see the Robin Williams,

1011
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:11,500
we see,
you know,

1012
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:15,070
the people who are dying of these
overdoses that ostensibly should be

1013
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:16,420
happy as fuck,
but they're not.

1014
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:21,250
They haven't dealt with the pressure of
fame in a way that's as aggressive as

1015
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:23,080
the pressure that it's caused on.
Yeah.

1016
00:49:23,081 --> 00:49:26,410
Robin Williams might not be the best
example because we had a bobcat in the

1017
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:29,440
other day and bobcat was a really good
friend of Robin's and Robin was

1018
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,480
diagnosed with several illnesses.

1019
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,580
One of them was Parkinson's,
but there was another one.

1020
00:49:33,581 --> 00:49:37,060
There was a,
a brain illness that he was diagnosed

1021
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:39,070
with.
Do you remember the name of a Jamie Lewy

1022
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,540
body disease?
I believe,

1023
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,041
but it,
it,

1024
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:45,310
um,
it directly affects the way he perceived

1025
00:49:45,311 --> 00:49:47,740
the world.
Like he had a real issue.

1026
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:54,500
Yeah.
Batman in Batman or whatever the joker

1027
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,140
was.
Heath Ledger.

1028
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:57,960
Pillow guy.
Yeah.

1029
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,980
Yeah.
So the pressure,

1030
00:49:59,981 --> 00:50:04,090
but they're responding to the pressure
in a way that's deleterious for their

1031
00:50:04,091 --> 00:50:06,280
life rather than responding to the
pressure being like,

1032
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,660
man,
this is fucked up.

1033
00:50:07,661 --> 00:50:11,800
I got all of these people looking at me.
I got to do some other work in society

1034
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,770
is not pushing them in that way either.
They're just saying more and more and

1035
00:50:14,771 --> 00:50:15,910
more,
get another roll,

1036
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:17,520
get more followers.
Right.

1037
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:17,951
Um,
you know,

1038
00:50:17,951 --> 00:50:20,700
it's like the demon voice that you have
from your act,

1039
00:50:20,701 --> 00:50:24,820
like exactly that they have that fucking
thing in their head.

1040
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,800
And the other guy like,
hey man,

1041
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,190
go fucking on a vision

1042
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,590
quest,
like find some mountains by yourself

1043
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:33,020
where nobody's watching it and you don't
have to act at all.

1044
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,340
You can just be you.
Well,

1045
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:37,070
this is what I wrote a note earlier
because we were talking about depression

1046
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:41,270
and I've always wondered if the
depression that people see in mass

1047
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,520
today,
there's so much depression that people

1048
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,580
mean there's a ca.
It's a common trait.

1049
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:50,150
Like it's a common condition.
Oh,

1050
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,520
he suffers from depression.
Oh,

1051
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,160
she suffers from depression.
Like,

1052
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:56,210
oh,
he's got herpes.

1053
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,170
You know,
you know what I mean?

1054
00:50:57,171 --> 00:50:57,701
It's like,
it's a,

1055
00:50:57,701 --> 00:51:00,980
it's a common thing.
I've always wondered or I've been

1056
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:03,400
wondering more and more recently.
Um,

1057
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:07,550
it really hit me when have you ever seen
a Heimos Arctic adventure?

1058
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:10,470
It was one of the first vice pieces that
ever.

1059
00:51:10,471 --> 00:51:12,560
So I think the first vice piece I ever
saw,

1060
00:51:12,561 --> 00:51:13,640
in fact,
no,

1061
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:18,850
the first one was David Choe looking for
a dinosaur in the Amazon or was he in

1062
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:20,240
the Congo?

1063
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,790
I think it was in the Congo.
David Choe.

1064
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:23,330
So fucking crazy.
I love that guy.

1065
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:28,900
But he went to Africa,
the guy's worth $100,000,000.

1066
00:51:29,501 --> 00:51:31,400
We went to Africa looking for a fucking
dinosaur.

1067
00:51:31,401 --> 00:51:33,330
That definitely doesn't exist.
But,

1068
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,920
but uh,
vice has done some awesome stuff.

1069
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:40,160
But one of the things they did that was
really interesting was this guy,

1070
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,850
his name is Huynh Mo.
I think that's how you say it.

1071
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,250
Age.
I am.

1072
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,060
Here it is heimos.
Hi mo.

1073
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:55,150
I had an n in there I think heimos
arctic refuge and this guy lives in this

1074
00:51:55,881 --> 00:52:00,881
incredibly remote area of the arctic
national wildlife refuge in the alaskan

1075
00:52:02,691 --> 00:52:04,850
interior.
And he,

1076
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:10,510
he lives in this really small log cabin
and he hunts and gathers and that's all

1077
00:52:12,231 --> 00:52:13,700
he does.
And he's very smart.

1078
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,160
I think he's not a dummy at all and he's
been up there.

1079
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:17,750
He lives with his wife and his.

1080
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:19,940
He raised children up there and it's
really,

1081
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:22,400
really.
There's some dark moments in there

1082
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:24,440
because they lived like this from the
time,

1083
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:29,120
like when they had children up there and
they lost their two year old baby in a

1084
00:52:29,121 --> 00:52:32,420
fucking canoe.
Like they tipped over in A,

1085
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,440
in a canoe and lost their kid.
And it's like it's a really intense when

1086
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:40,760
they revisit the site and leave flowers
and it was like 30 years ago and they

1087
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:44,090
had several children since then,
but this moment is still like this

1088
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:46,700
intense moment of loss for them where
they lost their baby,

1089
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:51,530
but this fucking guy is very happy and
very,

1090
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:56,560
very smart and very connected and very
articulate and he firmly believes that

1091
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:03,611
human beings,
when we evolved and developed and were

1092
00:53:04,491 --> 00:53:07,370
hunter gatherers,
that there's a set of rewards.

1093
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:10,400
There's reward systems that are set up
Inside the human body,

1094
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:10,930
inside the.

1095
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:14,390
The,
the very being that we embody that don't

1096
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,000
get met in today's society.
And tHat's one of the things that's

1097
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:19,640
causing depression.
One of the things that's causing this

1098
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:23,000
funk that people are in is that we're
living our lives.

1099
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:26,520
many of us,
at least in these very unfulfilling ways

1100
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,880
where you're going to this office with
artificial light and you're doing

1101
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:33,180
something you don't want to do all day
long and then you get home and you're

1102
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:35,790
tired.
And on top of tHat you're eating shit.

1103
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,630
You're eating potato chips and you're
drinking soda and your body is just

1104
00:53:39,631 --> 00:53:41,490
like,
what in the fuck is this?

1105
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:45,450
We're supposed to be out in the fields
were supposed to be walking up hills.

1106
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,470
We're supposed to be looking for aniMals
or gathering vegetables were supposed to

1107
00:53:49,471 --> 00:53:52,110
be doing all these things that our body
is designed to do.

1108
00:53:52,111 --> 00:53:56,370
We're supposed to be in nature and
nature is like a medicine.

1109
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:59,670
LIke it literally is a medicine to you.
Like people.

1110
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:02,190
People that go,
you don't have to go hunting,

1111
00:54:02,191 --> 00:54:04,650
you don't have to go fishing.
Just go fucking hike man.

1112
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,740
Just go hike up to the top of a mountain
and look out.

1113
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:13,220
You know there's a reward that you get
from that that Is intensely like soul

1114
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,510
filling.
Just like something about like wHen I

1115
00:54:15,511 --> 00:54:20,190
was in Colorado and there was this,
this area of boulder where you drive up

1116
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:23,460
one of these roads and there's this area
where you could park and it was this

1117
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:25,260
incredible view,
man.

1118
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,870
These people just pArk and just go out
there and just look,

1119
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,520
but you get there and you park and you
go,

1120
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:33,510
fuck [inaudible].
You would see you,

1121
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:37,560
you literally seeing the continental
divide and these snow capped mountains

1122
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:39,240
in july,
july.

1123
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:40,980
It's covered with snow because those
mountains,

1124
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:41,100
I don't

1125
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,890
give a perspective.
Oh,

1126
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,380
just this whole new perspective on it
and I think nature,

1127
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,600
I think the ease of suffering is always
in present in this.

1128
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,440
You know when you're in president is
truly locked in and presidents,

1129
00:54:52,441 --> 00:54:53,970
there is no suffering.
There can be pain,

1130
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:57,390
but no suffering.
Suffering is something created by our

1131
00:54:57,391 --> 00:55:00,780
own minds and I think nature is one of
the great ways to do this because

1132
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:02,970
humans,
we learn,

1133
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,340
we take cues from our environment and
nature.

1134
00:55:05,341 --> 00:55:07,590
As I was saying earlier,
is always in the present.

1135
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:10,320
You know there's this natural presidents
of all the animals,

1136
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:12,570
everything around you.
Whereas if you get around a bunch of

1137
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:15,570
people watching housewives and stressed
about this and pop them pills,

1138
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:18,960
you're going to take on that energy too
and you're gonna lose your present in

1139
00:55:18,961 --> 00:55:23,160
this because of your surrounding.
So it's like this ultimate regrounding

1140
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:26,070
tool where we get back to a present
moment.

1141
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:29,610
Again,
that's such a fucking key element to

1142
00:55:29,611 --> 00:55:33,270
human happiness and I think the other
key element is having something where

1143
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:34,830
we're fighting for,
we know,

1144
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,490
having a mission,
I think we're all forces and that forest

1145
00:55:38,491 --> 00:55:41,670
needs to have an effect,
needs to have A reason that it's moving

1146
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:45,540
in a certain directioN and I think with
all of our meats and all of our needs

1147
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:46,460
met,
you knoW,

1148
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,630
where we don't have to hunt for food,
we don't have to acquire everything.

1149
00:55:48,631 --> 00:55:51,810
Everything's relatively easy and it's
all about advancement and all this.

1150
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:55,410
We've lost a lot of the basic mission
which was the mission to suRvive and

1151
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:56,640
procreate,
you know,

1152
00:55:56,641 --> 00:55:58,410
so.
And we haven't replaced it with any

1153
00:55:58,411 --> 00:56:02,280
other universal mission,
which is I think one of the big allures

1154
00:56:02,281 --> 00:56:05,370
of these things like wars and these
things like creating an enemy.

1155
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:08,310
Well at least then you hAve a mission
and when you have a mission,

1156
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,290
human beings are happy.
You know,

1157
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:14,310
like a birch and russell talked about,
he did book conquest of happIness and he

1158
00:56:14,311 --> 00:56:16,470
had his own fucked up attributes.
Every time I bring them up,

1159
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,800
people talk about is fucked up.
And as he was into phonology and he

1160
00:56:19,801 --> 00:56:21,150
might've been racist,
whatever,

1161
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:22,710
but he was a good philosopher,
smoke.

1162
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,190
But,

1163
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,170
but Anyways,
he talked about the happiest person he

1164
00:56:26,171 --> 00:56:28,750
knew,
the happiest person he could find was a

1165
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:33,751
groundskeeper on a manner who every day
woke up and was at war with the rabbits,

1166
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:37,930
have the guy he just declared that the
rabbits were the fucking enemy.

1167
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:41,350
And he would go out with his gun and he
would hunt as many as possible and he'd

1168
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:43,150
go morning till,
till night,

1169
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:46,450
and he would kill as many rabbits as he
could because it was the rabbits were

1170
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:48,490
the ones eating the hedges and the
flowers and whatever.

1171
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:52,300
So he basically made the rabbits his
enemy and struck out every single day to

1172
00:56:52,301 --> 00:56:54,610
kill as many rabbits as possible.
And that dude,

1173
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:57,160
according to bertrand russell,
was happy as fuck.

1174
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,750
He had a task,
he had a task,

1175
00:56:58,751 --> 00:57:00,180
he had a purpose,
you know,

1176
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:03,310
he had a mission.
My mission is to destroy the rabbits.

1177
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,510
I just have a dog like that.

1178
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:06,780
Yeah.
I had the happiest dog over,

1179
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,220
his name was frank sinatra.
And uh,

1180
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:14,170
he was a pit bull that all he lived for
was killing lizards and my house,

1181
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,240
my old house,
not the house now,

1182
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:18,650
but my old house had this,
uh,

1183
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,020
one,
um,

1184
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:24,460
it's like a on a hill and there's this
one wall where these lizards would run

1185
00:57:24,461 --> 00:57:26,470
up the wall.
And so frank,

1186
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:29,620
I would literally let them out in the
morning and he fucking bolt out that

1187
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:30,820
door.
It's like time to go to war,

1188
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,850
like any would run and go look for these
lizards.

1189
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,680
And he would stand there like eddie
bravo.

1190
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:37,270
We'll just watch it.
And marvel.

1191
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:38,320
He'd be like,
fuck man,

1192
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:40,990
this dog does this every day there's,
doc does this every day I go,

1193
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:43,720
this is what he loves to do.
And he would go there and he would have

1194
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:48,721
his paws on the wall and
crazy and he would jump up and try to

1195
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:51,850
grab a lizard and occasionally he would
get one and he'd be like,

1196
00:57:51,851 --> 00:57:52,960
fuck yeah.

1197
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,870
And he would get one.
They would go looking for another one.

1198
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:56,440
He would go and he was a pretty big
yard.

1199
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,800
So he would go wandering around the yard
looking for anything else that fucked

1200
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:01,510
up.
Anything else that was slipping and it

1201
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:04,060
was constantly,
unfortunately twice.

1202
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:06,690
I had to take him to the hospital
because he got bit by rattlesnakes

1203
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,800
because rattlesnakes are slipping to.
Apparently he killed the rattlesnakes,

1204
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,230
but the rattlesnakes fucked him up here.
Like a water balloon grown out of the

1205
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,280
side of his head.
Both of my dogs.

1206
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,980
It.
By the way,

1207
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:21,700
that's a real problem.
If you don't have the money to pay for

1208
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:23,980
the serum,
it's super expensive.

1209
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:28,420
It was several thousand dollars to treat
them for this rattlesnake venom.

1210
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:29,680
Antivenom shit.
It's like.

1211
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:30,281
I was like,
man,

1212
00:58:30,281 --> 00:58:33,650
what if I was poor?
What if a whole fucked up system like

1213
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,940
you.
They inject horses with the venom and

1214
00:58:36,941 --> 00:58:40,480
they like get the antibodies from the
horses except this archaic system.

1215
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,970
I think my friend Donald Schultz is
working on.

1216
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:46,420
He's a big snake handler guy.
He's working on ways to innovate around

1217
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:49,630
that because it's kind of like a real
backwards system that they have.

1218
00:58:49,631 --> 00:58:51,040
How you get antivenom?
Well,

1219
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:54,160
a horse will survive,
so let's just fucking sorta put the

1220
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:56,860
venom in there and then we'll get the
antibodies from the horse and then,

1221
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:57,770
you know,
it's,

1222
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,530
it's a weird.
It's a weird thing how they do it.

1223
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:01,450
Yeah,
well that's a real problem with people

1224
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:03,100
that are vegans.
If you're a vegan,

1225
00:59:03,101 --> 00:59:05,620
you don't use any animal products.
You get bit by a rattlesnake,

1226
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,100
you got two choices.
Compromise your morals.

1227
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,680
Well that's a wrap.
Yeah.

1228
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,920
You know,
um,

1229
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:15,790
but this dog was so goddamn happy.
He had missions,

1230
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,950
you know,
he would go out of that yard and he

1231
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:20,410
wasn't bored.
He was really pleased to see me for a

1232
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:20,830
walk.

1233
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:22,250
Come on man.
He was like,

1234
00:59:22,251 --> 00:59:24,200
see it dude.
Don't opened that door.

1235
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:26,660
He was gone.
He just had his little mission.

1236
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:30,230
And I think you can see that in the
people who are the most unhappy.

1237
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:31,770
THey seem aimless.
Like,

1238
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:33,920
what am I here for?
Why am I doing this?

1239
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:35,600
Nothing makes sense.
You know?

1240
00:59:35,601 --> 00:59:37,670
And I've even felt it in my own life
when,

1241
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,030
you know,
I know what my mission here.

1242
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,650
My mission is to expand human
consciousness,

1243
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:46,400
to help people be happy.
Like that's really what I find my

1244
00:59:46,401 --> 00:59:48,920
greatest purpose in.
But every once in a while I'll get this

1245
00:59:48,921 --> 00:59:51,980
kind of like fuck people attitude.
Maybe someone said some fucked up shit

1246
00:59:51,981 --> 00:59:52,491
and I'm like,
man,

1247
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:55,400
people fucking suck for people.
And then at that poem,

1248
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,490
that's when I'm actually depressed,
you know,

1249
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:59,930
because I've lost my mission.
Instead of having a mission,

1250
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:00,381
like,
yes,

1251
01:00:00,381 --> 01:00:01,970
my mission is human consciousness.

1252
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,160
All of a sudden it's like fuck people,
fuck that mission.

1253
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,460
THey'll figure it out and then I'm
depressed because I've lost my purpose.

1254
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,060
It's very hard to rise above like
literally when something like that

1255
01:00:11,061 --> 01:00:12,440
happens and realize like,
oh,

1256
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:13,261
you've just,
you're,

1257
01:00:13,261 --> 01:00:15,860
you're encountering one diseased
individual.

1258
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:18,230
You've got to look at the mass of
humanity.

1259
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,620
Like when you encounter one diseased
individual,

1260
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:25,700
it's so like this guy who shot up that
nightclub in orlando,

1261
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,460
you're,
you're looking at one diseased

1262
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:29,150
individual and if you say,
man,

1263
01:00:29,151 --> 01:00:30,770
people fucking suck.
Look at what they did.

1264
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:34,700
We'll look into how many people that are
responding with rainbows on their

1265
01:00:34,701 --> 01:00:36,890
twitter pages and love and,
and,

1266
01:00:36,891 --> 01:00:39,770
and all the best wishes to those folks
that got killed that other.

1267
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:42,520
I mean I was looking at this guy's page
who's a,

1268
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:47,510
an animal lover who was organizing
people to go to the homes of the victims

1269
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:49,130
and see if they have pets that are
trapped.

1270
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,260
You know,
there's this beautiful people out there.

1271
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,610
There's a lot,
there's more beautiful pete.

1272
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,600
This is without a doubt,
not just the safest,

1273
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:59,490
the easiest.
This is the happiest time in terms of

1274
01:00:59,491 --> 01:01:02,530
like being able to like reach out and,
and,

1275
01:01:02,531 --> 01:01:06,500
and send love to people and have people
send love to you,

1276
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:08,800
but just occasionally you run into conc
yeah,

1277
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:09,570
no,
no,

1278
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:12,410
and the constant self.
BuT the beauty is out there too.

1279
01:01:12,411 --> 01:01:15,890
It's just not as dramatic and it doesn't
impose upon us as forcefully,

1280
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:17,240
but we've,
we just look.

1281
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,330
It's around all the time.
We run into good people all the time,

1282
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:24,110
but you just make eye contact with that
good person or that kid.

1283
01:01:24,111 --> 01:01:26,930
He's just looking at you and just that
little smile and you're like,

1284
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,760
oh yeah,
the good of humanity.

1285
01:01:28,761 --> 01:01:29,680
The fact that,
you know,

1286
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,370
we really are love,
you know,

1287
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:36,380
being expressed outwardly all the time
and it's just these other delusions that

1288
01:01:36,381 --> 01:01:37,214
get in the way of that.

1289
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,650
Well,
we're oddly attracted to negativity to.

1290
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,680
It's almost like we look at negativity
online or that you run into is a

1291
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:48,050
possibility of war.
Like you have to look at this fucking

1292
01:01:48,051 --> 01:01:49,700
drums beating,
goddammit.

1293
01:01:49,701 --> 01:01:51,530
There's an army on the background.
They're coming,

1294
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,550
they're coming.
You know,

1295
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:56,510
it's like there's this real impulse to
sort of batten down the hatches when

1296
01:01:56,511 --> 01:02:00,800
really it's just some fucking 36 year
old losers sit in his parents basement,

1297
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:03,110
you know,
farting and smelling his own farts and

1298
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,670
angry online.
I mean,

1299
01:02:04,671 --> 01:02:06,800
that's really what a lot of you're
dealing with.

1300
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,770
You're dealing with like really sick
people,

1301
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:12,920
like people that have just,
for whatever reason,

1302
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,070
they've not found their path.
They've not found any happiness.

1303
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:17,570
They have found any fulfillment.
They don't.

1304
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:20,520
They haven't found any growth there just
stifled

1305
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,780
or rotten and some sort of a weird way.
It just hasn't really worked for them

1306
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:27,060
and so they're,
they're lashing out,

1307
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:32,150
the lashing out at the world and you run
into one of those people suck and that's

1308
01:02:32,161 --> 01:02:36,230
the initial response and then the more
conscious response is to look at and be

1309
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:41,340
and have compassion for that person.
That is hard to do and our system isn't

1310
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:43,530
based upon that.
Even if you look at the u s penal

1311
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:45,330
system,
it's very much about punishment.

1312
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:48,360
Whereas if you watched that documentary
that Michael Moore did,

1313
01:02:48,361 --> 01:02:50,490
who to invade nest,
where they go to Norway,

1314
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,000
they have a whole different idea of what
the penal system is for.

1315
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:58,530
It's about restoring human dignity and
cultivating a change.

1316
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,380
Really making change in the person.
It's not about punishment,

1317
01:03:01,381 --> 01:03:03,570
it's about.
It's about actually changing that

1318
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:06,630
individual so he doesn't do it again,
and then you look at the recidivism

1319
01:03:06,631 --> 01:03:10,590
rates between our prisons and norway's
prisons and they're just dramatically

1320
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,160
different.

1321
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,840
That impulse to punish immediately,
you know,

1322
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:17,670
is not the healthiest impulse.
That's just gonna create more issues

1323
01:03:17,671 --> 01:03:20,220
down the road.
You're not rehabilitating anybody.

1324
01:03:20,221 --> 01:03:23,760
You're just taking even more broken
people and putting them out in the world

1325
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:25,440
and hoping they're not going to do the
broken things.

1326
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,300
Well,
it's not going to fucking work.

1327
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:29,580
You know,
the right impulse is always that

1328
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:33,060
compassion and looking to see as if that
was you,

1329
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:35,790
how all of these fucked up elements of
the world and choices.

1330
01:03:35,791 --> 01:03:38,730
I'm not overriding the fact that they
had choices and all this.

1331
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,920
They're not free of guilt,
but look at,

1332
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:43,260
look at that.
Like this is the person that just made

1333
01:03:43,261 --> 01:03:47,070
some bad choices and had some tough shit
to deal with and couldn't overcome it.

1334
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:51,540
The resistance in the video game was
higher than his skillset and he wasn't

1335
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:54,780
able to,
to choose to work and choose to the

1336
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:57,030
positive elements that would allow them
to overcome it.

1337
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,520
you know,
it's,

1338
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:01,760
it's also norway's dealing with far
fewer people,

1339
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:02,770
you know,
and that's,

1340
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:05,710
that's a good thing for them.
And it's also they,

1341
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:09,330
they don't have that conquers mentality
that we have.

1342
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:15,020
So when we were so wrapped up in success
and also in punishment,

1343
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,230
I mean that,
that is a big aspect of our culture.

1344
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:24,290
Like punishment and I mean like when
anyone does anything wrong online,

1345
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:28,020
the amount of people that feel like it's
their job to shame that person and

1346
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:30,810
embarrass that person and insult that
person,

1347
01:04:30,811 --> 01:04:33,600
it's pretty crazy to watch when
something goes down.

1348
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,900
It's also,
it's also counterproductive and I see

1349
01:04:36,901 --> 01:04:39,840
that in the people shaming people for
appropriation,

1350
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:41,760
right?
So let's say for example,

1351
01:04:41,761 --> 01:04:44,580
someone wears a head dress at a fucking
festival,

1352
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:45,990
right?
They're probably mildly.

1353
01:04:45,991 --> 01:04:47,940
They're not doing it to mock the native
americans,

1354
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:49,240
most likely,
probably like a,

1355
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,360
a mild appreciation and interest.

1356
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:54,450
I think this looks cool.
I'm in a place and you know,

1357
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:59,490
and then all of a sudden they get all
this intense hate and shame and putting

1358
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:02,340
all of this stuff,
all of these intentions on them that

1359
01:05:02,341 --> 01:05:03,270
weren't true.
Again,

1360
01:05:03,271 --> 01:05:05,640
going back to my point about morality,
it's not about the act,

1361
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:09,150
it's about the intentions of the act,
but right now we make it all about the

1362
01:05:09,151 --> 01:05:09,511
act.
Oh,

1363
01:05:09,511 --> 01:05:12,270
you wore this headdress.
That means you're insulting thousands of

1364
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:13,510
years of native americans.
You're oppressing,

1365
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,240
you're appropriating Like,
no,

1366
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:17,130
I fucking wasn't.
I was wearing a fucking harris'

1367
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,070
headdress.

1368
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,300
But then all of a sudden that imprint
will create trauma and that trauma will

1369
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:26,230
have a poisonous impact that will make
them feel weird and make them want to do

1370
01:05:26,231 --> 01:05:29,500
that to other people.
So it's like you're in injecting someone

1371
01:05:29,501 --> 01:05:31,840
with a,
like a hate virus,

1372
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,000
you know,
that they're going to then pass on to

1373
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:36,100
other people rather than doing the
opposite,

1374
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,590
you know,
spreading the love herpes where this

1375
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:42,700
contagious positivity that goes the
other way and we have those choices with

1376
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:45,070
how to deal with people,
but more often than not,

1377
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:49,090
we come with this thing to punish and
create more trauma which triggers their

1378
01:05:49,091 --> 01:05:52,570
own self judge and their own self hate,
lowers their own self love.

1379
01:05:52,571 --> 01:05:54,790
And then they're going to pass that off
to kids,

1380
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:56,200
family members,
people around them.

1381
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:58,540
You know,
there's just two sets of dominoes that

1382
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:02,760
we can choose to take to take either pat
and the concept of copd.

1383
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,910
Cultural appropriation is so stupid
because culture itself is bullshit.

1384
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:10,780
Culture itself is just a bunch of shit
that people have done over and over

1385
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:11,900
again as a habit.
Right?

1386
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,490
So your idea that no one should
appropriate someone's other bullshit

1387
01:06:15,491 --> 01:06:19,600
habits is so fucking ridiculous,
like you shouldn't wear your hair like

1388
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:22,630
that because other dummies women wearing
their hair like that for 100 years.

1389
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:27,290
Now they've decided thAt this is theirs.
They own the dreadlock yeah.

1390
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,290
You know,
or they own the braids.

1391
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:29,620
Are they?
Oh,

1392
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:32,440
it's fucking nonsense.
It's nonsense.

1393
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:36,100
And it's just one of those things that
michael shermer likes to call virtue

1394
01:06:36,101 --> 01:06:41,101
signaling where you see someone who's
doing something and in chastising them

1395
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:45,250
you're not just trying to stop them from
doing it.

1396
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:48,910
You're also letting the world know how
ethical and how moral you are.

1397
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:53,080
And so you get a lot of like really
goofy fucking white people who get mad

1398
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:56,560
at other white people for doing things
that they deem to be cultural

1399
01:06:56,561 --> 01:06:57,394
appropriation.

1400
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,850
And it's one thing if you're deeply
embedded and rooted in that culture,

1401
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:04,330
like um,
what is that thing that a hindu people

1402
01:07:04,331 --> 01:07:07,690
put on their forehead when they're in
love in love?

1403
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:09,670
They put the third eye symbol on their
head.

1404
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:11,590
I think it has something to do with
love,

1405
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,750
or is it a bindi?
Is that what it is you can be?

1406
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:15,790
Yeah.
Well,

1407
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:17,710
I've,
I've seen people get upset at people

1408
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:22,150
appropriating that and like,
but what is that?

1409
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:23,680
You get,
you get a sticker on your head,

1410
01:07:23,681 --> 01:07:24,700
man,
for real.

1411
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:25,720
Well,
what about us?

1412
01:07:25,721 --> 01:07:29,080
We're wearing tattoos clearly yet
someone's culture.

1413
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:33,400
I mean the kind that we have is fairly
american I guess,

1414
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:37,690
but my inner,
like aaron dellavedova did mine and sort

1415
01:07:37,691 --> 01:07:40,360
of a japanese style japanese tattoo on
my ribs.

1416
01:07:40,361 --> 01:07:42,820
Yeah.
It's this sort of cultural appropriate

1417
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,820
in a time where we need all the best
ideas ever.

1418
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:48,730
You know what I mean?
Like we need to bring everything that's

1419
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:52,240
good and everything that made sense and
everything that can tap people back into

1420
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:54,820
something positive.
we need all of that stuff.

1421
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,880
We don't need to.
We need,

1422
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:58,810
so we need to gather all of the best
practices of the culture.

1423
01:07:58,811 --> 01:08:00,790
That's the fucking beautiful part of the
time we're in.

1424
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,360
We can go eat moroccan food or chinese
food or japanese food.

1425
01:08:04,361 --> 01:08:08,680
We can go enjoy all of these things and
we need all of this enjoyment because

1426
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:12,670
there's all kinds of other fucked up
stuff that's going on as well that we

1427
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,590
have to deal with.
So I mean,

1428
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,550
I,
I just have such the opposite

1429
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,260
idea that,
you know,

1430
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:21,350
like tesla is doing with his patents,
this idea of protect and hold.

1431
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:23,330
This is our own shit.
Nobody else get it.

1432
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,590
That's to the detriment of the world.
Like everybody should want to share all

1433
01:08:27,591 --> 01:08:32,591
the ideas and best practices that they
have to be like me secretly doing

1434
01:08:32,781 --> 01:08:34,980
psychedelics.
Right?

1435
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:37,580
Happy or not motherfuckers fuck you.
You know,

1436
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,840
it doesn't make any sense.
like you want to talk about it and say

1437
01:08:39,841 --> 01:08:41,690
like,
this is what worked for me.

1438
01:08:41,691 --> 01:08:42,560
This is,
hey,

1439
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:45,170
how can you,
how can you improve yourself to,

1440
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:46,101
well,
ironically,

1441
01:08:46,101 --> 01:08:49,880
that's what people believe.
The biblical scholars who have studied

1442
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:53,650
the connection between psychedelics and
ancient religions that say believe where

1443
01:08:53,651 --> 01:08:58,130
it all went wrong and so they tried to
hold back the psychedelic rituals and

1444
01:08:58,131 --> 01:09:02,810
hide them from conquering armies.
And that's what john marco allegro

1445
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:05,750
believed that christianity was really
initially all about.

1446
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:09,020
It was about writing down these things
in the bible,

1447
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:13,960
in parables and hiding them in these
stories and that these stories were to

1448
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:17,480
mask it from the conquerors from being
conquered by the roman army.

1449
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,520
Yeah,
and then really the opposite is what

1450
01:09:19,521 --> 01:09:22,060
they needed.
They needed to share this open sources

1451
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:24,800
as widely as possible,
so you look at that period.

1452
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:29,030
It's riddled with war and atrocities and
all this fucked up stuff that's

1453
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:31,010
happened.
It's in the human rights record and in

1454
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:32,660
the archaeological record,
you know,

1455
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:34,000
cities built,
destroyed,

1456
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:34,940
destroyed,
barbarian,

1457
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:35,241
blah,
blah,

1458
01:09:35,241 --> 01:09:37,220
blah.
Then you go take the counterpoint of

1459
01:09:37,221 --> 01:09:39,800
that to a culture ancient shoving in
Peru,

1460
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:44,600
which archaeologically has been shown
that for 700 years there was no records

1461
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:49,601
of war in this region around shoving and
shoving where the curators of the plant

1462
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:51,290
medicine,
which enhances serotonin,

1463
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:53,960
very hard opening medicine I've talked
about here on this podcast,

1464
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:56,720
but they would give it to everybody.

1465
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:59,120
You just showed up.
Maybe you brought a seashell as a gift.

1466
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:00,680
Maybe you didn't.
Didn't matter.

1467
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:03,650
They would hold these open ceremonies
for everybody who came.

1468
01:10:03,651 --> 01:10:05,960
kings peasants doesn't.
They didn't differ,

1469
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:09,230
differentiate.
They were offering this to everybody and

1470
01:10:09,231 --> 01:10:13,860
everybody was just more open and the
records of war and the destructions

1471
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:17,600
destruction that it's just not there in
the archaeological record and it has a

1472
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:20,660
lot to do.
Obviously you can't prove causation,

1473
01:10:20,661 --> 01:10:24,410
but the correlation between them open
sourcing these psychedelic rituals to

1474
01:10:24,411 --> 01:10:28,640
everybody and they're not being war for
hundreds and hundreds of years is

1475
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:32,210
absolutely there and that's should it is
where people went wrong because they

1476
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:36,800
tried to hoard information for power
because that knowledge of course yields

1477
01:10:36,801 --> 01:10:38,870
power.
If you have the knowledge and only you

1478
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:41,270
have it,
you'll have power over people who don't.

1479
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:43,280
Whereas real,
you know,

1480
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:45,500
heart based power,
leading with your heart forward,

1481
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:47,150
just open source all that.

1482
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:49,610
Let it all sorted itself out.
Yeah,

1483
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:53,780
it only makes sense that if you want the
world that you live in,

1484
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:57,620
to be a better place.
You've got to tell the things that have

1485
01:10:57,621 --> 01:10:59,240
made.
Tell people the things that have made

1486
01:10:59,241 --> 01:11:02,960
your life better and things that made
your life fucked up.

1487
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:06,020
Don't hide that shit either.
Don't pretend like you're perfect and

1488
01:11:06,021 --> 01:11:08,090
things don't fuck you up and everything
is good.

1489
01:11:08,091 --> 01:11:10,400
Like people need to hear all of it.
Like,

1490
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:11,660
oh yeah,
I tried this thing.

1491
01:11:11,661 --> 01:11:13,890
It was fucking terrible.
I wouldn't want to do that again,

1492
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:14,040
but

1493
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,200
how could they possibly have known that
thousands of years ago?

1494
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:17,510
You know what I mean?
It's,

1495
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,990
I would love to have gone back in time.
I would love to go back in time like

1496
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:25,700
several thousand years,
just be invisible being some sort of

1497
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:30,900
invisible cone of protection and just
sit down in a village,

1498
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:32,880
you know,
in ancient days,

1499
01:11:32,881 --> 01:11:35,220
in somewhere really populated area of
the world,

1500
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:39,780
whether it's Greece or rome or wherever,
and just try to try to take in what

1501
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:43,150
these fucking people are doing,
how they were living and look at what

1502
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:47,280
they're essentially like.
They're not just our ancestors.

1503
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:50,580
There was,
I think we can look at ancient cultures

1504
01:11:50,581 --> 01:11:55,581
in ancient societies and see if we look
back and see all of their weird crazy

1505
01:11:57,721 --> 01:12:02,160
stories and traditions and the way they
sort of established the government and

1506
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:06,960
would look at what we're doing now.
And if you sort of extrapolate deep into

1507
01:12:06,961 --> 01:12:07,960
the future like where were.

1508
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:11,580
These are all the.
This is just not that long ago,

1509
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:15,420
it's a small little blip in time and
there's obviously some sort of a process

1510
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:18,420
going on,
some sort of a process of improvement

1511
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:23,070
and have a of innovation and some sort
of a weird way innovation of culture and

1512
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:26,400
society and communication and I think
that's one of the things that we're

1513
01:12:26,401 --> 01:12:30,930
dealing with now with this age of
information and all the data that we

1514
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:33,900
have to sift through and all the
communication that we have to sift

1515
01:12:33,901 --> 01:12:37,260
through.
We're becoming some new thing and it's

1516
01:12:37,261 --> 01:12:40,770
happening in our lifetime and it's
happening in a really fucking confusing

1517
01:12:40,771 --> 01:12:45,240
way and it's one of the things that make
people yearn for the past.

1518
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:47,880
It makes people yearn for the good old
days.

1519
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:50,880
You know,
it makes a slogan like donald trump's

1520
01:12:50,881 --> 01:12:53,280
keep America or make America great
again.

1521
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,400
What the fuck does that mean?
It's never been better.

1522
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:59,610
It's never been better than right now.
It would make America great again.

1523
01:12:59,611 --> 01:13:02,280
Like how could it be greater?
Like when has it ever been better than

1524
01:13:02,281 --> 01:13:04,320
right now for anybody?
This is the safest time.

1525
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,530
This is the most communication.
There's the most information available,

1526
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:12,210
there's the most medicine available.
You medical science can save people.

1527
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:15,390
you can live healthier lives.
We know more about nutrition,

1528
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,880
we understand more about the body,
like when was it better?

1529
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:20,550
Yeah,
and still we're in this weird

1530
01:13:20,551 --> 01:13:23,010
transitional period that I think we all
can,

1531
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:28,530
can notice because truth hasn't
percolated down to the rest of the rest

1532
01:13:28,531 --> 01:13:31,380
of society.
It's and it's a frustrating point.

1533
01:13:31,381 --> 01:13:34,710
Like we know that people should not be
getting thrown in jail for marijuana.

1534
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:38,430
That's not a debatable facts.
Like the act of throwing them in jail is

1535
01:13:38,431 --> 01:13:39,270
bad for the person.

1536
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,880
The act of taking the marijuana is not
bad for society.

1537
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:45,210
There's the truth is there,
but still we're in this lag.

1538
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:48,720
The lag is really frustrated people
because you know,

1539
01:13:48,721 --> 01:13:50,550
but that's just the.
That's just the nature of it.

1540
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:54,300
It's like when you go from switching
from mcdonald's to starting to eat

1541
01:13:54,301 --> 01:13:57,990
healthy and drinking kale shakes,
the body doesn't respond instantly.

1542
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,940
You know,
you have to be patient with the body

1543
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,650
like it's not just because you change
your mind.

1544
01:14:01,651 --> 01:14:04,290
The mind is instant.
you can change your mind and instantly

1545
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:06,540
it's changed,
but the body is different and so a

1546
01:14:06,541 --> 01:14:10,350
society like it's going to take awhile
for truth to percolate all the way

1547
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:12,070
through and in the process

1548
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,860
like if you switch from mcdonald's to
going on a juice fast,

1549
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:17,860
you're going to feel like shit.
You know all the toxins are going to

1550
01:14:17,861 --> 01:14:20,110
come up.
Everything is going to bubble up through

1551
01:14:20,111 --> 01:14:23,800
the body and you're going to have this
massive detoxification period where you

1552
01:14:23,801 --> 01:14:27,670
actually feel worse than if you had just
continued to eat mcdonald's all the time

1553
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:31,750
because the body's going to go through
the process of at reacclimating to a new

1554
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:35,710
way and I think we're in a little bit of
that stage now where a truth is come out

1555
01:14:35,711 --> 01:14:38,440
and a lot of different aspects of
things,

1556
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:40,450
but it hasn't percolated all the way
through.

1557
01:14:40,451 --> 01:14:44,500
So we're going through this kind of
societal detox where we have an applied

1558
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:46,930
the knowledge that is that is there
readily available.

1559
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:51,430
I have feelings on the tour.
I think that a lot of this resistance to

1560
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:53,260
new knowledge,
new information,

1561
01:14:53,261 --> 01:14:57,670
and even the resistance to freedom,
like the marijuana laws and a lot of the

1562
01:14:57,671 --> 01:14:59,620
things that we deeply deeply disagree
with,

1563
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:04,980
that this is all in some sort of a way
fueling change that the resistance

1564
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:10,210
actually fires people up and makes them
more motivated to move forward and

1565
01:15:10,211 --> 01:15:14,260
actually it actually strengthens the
resolve of the resistance.

1566
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,690
To know that there's so much ignorance
out there in the world.

1567
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:21,130
Like when some slob like chris christie
starts going on about nonsense saying

1568
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:25,450
how dangerous marijuana is,
and meanwhile he's kalille abusing the

1569
01:15:25,451 --> 01:15:28,720
fuck out of his meat vehicle.
I mean that guy.

1570
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:33,780
If anybody should not talk about health
and consequences of negative actions.

1571
01:15:34,871 --> 01:15:39,130
It's someone who's morbidly obese who's
already gone through fucking stomach

1572
01:15:39,131 --> 01:15:42,670
surgery and still morbidly obese,
but that guy,

1573
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:45,310
whether he knows it or not,
as ignorant statements,

1574
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:48,550
has fueled a massive amount of
resistance.

1575
01:15:48,551 --> 01:15:52,120
There's people that have like fucking
doubled down on their resolve because of

1576
01:15:52,121 --> 01:15:55,550
the stupid shit that he said and it
actually fuels things in a,

1577
01:15:55,750 --> 01:16:00,750
in a positive way and in a horrible way.
Even a mass killing of gay people like

1578
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:04,000
what happened to orlando,
horrible,

1579
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:07,780
terrible tragedy,
but ultimately that's not going to stop

1580
01:16:07,781 --> 01:16:09,010
people from being gay.

1581
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:13,510
What it's gonna do is it's going to fuel
all the people like you and me who have

1582
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:17,680
nothing but love and acceptance for
everybody regardless of your sexual

1583
01:16:17,681 --> 01:16:21,310
persuasion.
To double down on that and to get that

1584
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:25,630
out more and that's where all the people
on twitter and instagram and facebook

1585
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:30,340
and all the social media posts about
love and respect and and not giving a

1586
01:16:30,341 --> 01:16:31,600
fuck.
And I've seen,

1587
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:36,580
I don't know how many fucking memes from
that bit that I did about this.

1588
01:16:36,581 --> 01:16:38,860
Two reasons to hate gay marriage.
You know,

1589
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:41,410
you're.
You're either dumb or you're secretly

1590
01:16:41,411 --> 01:16:42,460
worried.
That dixit delicious.

1591
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,880
That is fucking all over the place.
After one of these things happen and

1592
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:50,590
that and then a million other ones like
it and a million other rainbows and

1593
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:55,570
hearts in the shape of a rainbow and
it's people doubled down on their

1594
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:57,150
acceptance,
double down the result.

1595
01:16:57,150 --> 01:17:00,040
And there might be some people that were
on the fence that might've had some

1596
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:02,500
negative ideas about gay people and see
all this and go,

1597
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:04,780
man,
you can't fucking kill people in a

1598
01:17:04,781 --> 01:17:06,970
nightclub just because they're gay.
That's crazy.

1599
01:17:06,971 --> 01:17:10,100
And then they might open their mind a
little bit and then they might read a

1600
01:17:10,101 --> 01:17:13,640
little bit more and then they might see
an interview with some gay people that

1601
01:17:13,641 --> 01:17:15,050
are holding hands and go,
well,

1602
01:17:15,051 --> 01:17:16,270
why do I give a fuck?
Like,

1603
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,320
what is this?
What religion?

1604
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,280
What some ancient stupid tradition.
Is it cultural appropriation?

1605
01:17:22,281 --> 01:17:23,090
Like,
what is it?

1606
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:23,480
You know,
what,

1607
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:28,480
what is it about this idea that people
should or shouldn't love people of one

1608
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:31,850
sex or another sex?
And if they do love them,

1609
01:17:31,851 --> 01:17:33,680
they definitely shouldn't fuck them.
You know,

1610
01:17:33,681 --> 01:17:34,920
I love you.
Like we're,

1611
01:17:34,921 --> 01:17:36,470
we're really good friends.
We've never fucked.

1612
01:17:36,471 --> 01:17:38,840
I hope we never do.
But you know what I'm saying?

1613
01:17:38,841 --> 01:17:41,390
Like what it.
Why would anybody care if you love

1614
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:45,410
somebody and then you wind up touching
your body with them and pleasuring each

1615
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:48,200
other.
Like to some people that becomes this

1616
01:17:48,201 --> 01:17:53,201
taboo worthy of violence.
That's a nonsense point of view that is

1617
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:57,260
highlighted by horrific acts and these
horrific acts,

1618
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:01,370
it's horrible,
despicable as they are in fact fuel

1619
01:18:01,371 --> 01:18:04,640
people to be more open and more
understanding.

1620
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:08,360
It's like the more you push back,
the more the resistance grove.

1621
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:10,580
Yeah,
and that's a point that you always fall

1622
01:18:10,581 --> 01:18:13,580
back on.
It's absolutely a hundred percent right.

1623
01:18:13,581 --> 01:18:18,230
I mean the obstacle is the way these
things that in any video game you need

1624
01:18:18,231 --> 01:18:21,080
resistance in order to test your skills
and improve,

1625
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:23,270
you know,
in a weight room you need gravity and

1626
01:18:23,271 --> 01:18:26,570
the additional weights to stress your
body so that you respond.

1627
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:29,750
And that's the same case with,
with all of these elements.

1628
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:32,540
We underestimate the value of
resistance.

1629
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,550
And that's a great constant reminder
like,

1630
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,440
yeah,
there's a lot of fucked up things that

1631
01:18:36,441 --> 01:18:39,230
happened,
but that resistance will allow us to

1632
01:18:39,231 --> 01:18:44,231
cultivate our own consciousness and our
own love and a much greater way than,

1633
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:45,860
than if it wasn't there.
You know?

1634
01:18:45,861 --> 01:18:49,520
And so in a loT of ways to really grow,
you have to seek out,

1635
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:52,510
you have to seek out resistance in your
own life and society.

1636
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,410
You know,
it'll come naturally in society,

1637
01:18:54,411 --> 01:18:58,400
but put yourself up against your own
fears to grow and put yourself up

1638
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:00,560
against it,
and when these things do happen,

1639
01:19:00,561 --> 01:19:05,330
they are a great natural things that you
can rally behind and then bring forth

1640
01:19:05,331 --> 01:19:09,350
your best asset attributes and best
aspects because that's what.

1641
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:12,080
That's what allows us to grow its
resistance.

1642
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,750
Absolutely.
I mean that's what working out is.

1643
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:15,540
Yeah,

1644
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:18,810
pretty obvious.
Like if you don't train hard,

1645
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,720
your body does not grow.
If you don't put forth effort,

1646
01:19:21,721 --> 01:19:24,690
your body does not get stronger.
You don't get more endurance unless you

1647
01:19:24,691 --> 01:19:27,870
push yourself.
There's only one way and it's you got to

1648
01:19:27,871 --> 01:19:31,440
go through something hard in order to
get something good out of it.

1649
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:35,040
There's no other way.
And that's one of the weirder things

1650
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:35,874
about being a person.

1651
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:39,630
Yeah,
and really it comes down to people also.

1652
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,140
One of the things that I've been ranting
about a lot lately is choice.

1653
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,270
You know,
and people this,

1654
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:48,150
we live in a society that loves to take
choice from us and say,

1655
01:19:48,151 --> 01:19:49,770
all right,
everything is a disease.

1656
01:19:49,771 --> 01:19:52,230
Everything is privilege.
Everything is this thing.

1657
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,810
You know,
you really didn't have a choice because

1658
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:58,050
there were these preconceived conditions
and and it really,

1659
01:19:58,051 --> 01:20:02,180
it's robbing us of choice because with,
if we accept our inherent superpower,

1660
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:04,590
which is choice,
then we have responsibility for who we

1661
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:07,110
are and if we have responsibility for
who we are,

1662
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:11,580
all of us have such a harsh self judge
that every failing we have,

1663
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:12,481
if we say,
well,

1664
01:20:12,481 --> 01:20:15,570
it was up to us,
the judge just beats us to death about

1665
01:20:15,571 --> 01:20:18,030
it.
So we'd rather shrug our responsibility

1666
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,770
and go with our hands up to the judge.

1667
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:20,760
Judge,
it wasn't my fault,

1668
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:25,790
it wasn't my fault because we have such
a harsh self judge in our own head that,

1669
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:27,690
that we intend to do that.
So we,

1670
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:31,800
we give up our inherent superpower,
which is choice because we don't want to

1671
01:20:31,801 --> 01:20:35,220
take the responsibility,
but at any point we can take that back

1672
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:38,780
and you have to deal with the judge and
you deal with the judge by making a pact

1673
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:41,760
to always forgive yourself.
Forgive yourself for any of the fucked

1674
01:20:41,761 --> 01:20:45,660
up things that have happened and just
accept that we're all imperfect.

1675
01:20:45,661 --> 01:20:49,350
This idea of perfection is nonsense.
We're all gonna fuck up.

1676
01:20:49,351 --> 01:20:52,040
We're all gonna make mistakes,
and so the judge is,

1677
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:53,720
this is nonsense.
You know,

1678
01:20:53,721 --> 01:20:56,340
it's like we're all gonna have come to
the place we are,

1679
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:58,770
you know,
through any variety of channels and

1680
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,660
where it's going to be an imperfect
path,

1681
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:01,553
no matter what.

1682
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:06,680
So continued to pound that own message
of self love and forgiveness and then re

1683
01:21:07,141 --> 01:21:11,850
harness that element of choice so that
we can then decide what we want to be,

1684
01:21:11,851 --> 01:21:14,940
who we want to be,
what we want to go and put our intent.

1685
01:21:14,941 --> 01:21:17,610
Fourth and yeah,
and maybe not everything is possible,

1686
01:21:17,611 --> 01:21:22,611
but what better thing to do then tend to
fail in the cause of your greatest wish

1687
01:21:23,221 --> 01:21:25,170
and your greatest intention in your
greatest desire.

1688
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,240
I mean,
that's the ultimate warriors death.

1689
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:31,380
That's what they would talk about with
vala to find an enemy worthy enough to

1690
01:21:31,381 --> 01:21:34,050
kill me in battle.
That was the the ultimate idea,

1691
01:21:34,051 --> 01:21:37,620
and we can all choose those battles and
choose that thing that we're fighting

1692
01:21:37,621 --> 01:21:38,970
for and fuck,
if we fail,

1693
01:21:38,971 --> 01:21:41,490
so what?
But at least if we're going out on that

1694
01:21:41,491 --> 01:21:42,300
way,
you know,

1695
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,490
we'll go out with a smile 100 percent of
the time,

1696
01:21:44,491 --> 01:21:47,160
but it starts with really harnessing
that choice

1697
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:51,710
and the worst people that you know are
the people that don't have a good self

1698
01:21:51,711 --> 01:21:54,050
judge that everything they do is
awesome.

1699
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,360
Yeah.
Those motherfuckers never grow anywhere,

1700
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:57,011
right?
I mean,

1701
01:21:57,011 --> 01:21:59,400
that's a huge issue with comedy.
Um,

1702
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:03,590
when you run into people thAt have
terrible comedy sets but think they did

1703
01:22:03,591 --> 01:22:05,330
great.
Like we would always,

1704
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:08,600
greg fitzsimmons and I would always talk
about that with like open miker.

1705
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:11,240
So there's people that hear phantom
labs,

1706
01:22:11,241 --> 01:22:15,140
like they think they're doing great and
they have this delusional self opinion

1707
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:17,990
where everything they do is awesome and
they don't know why they're not

1708
01:22:17,991 --> 01:22:20,510
successful already.
They know why they're not famous.

1709
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:24,740
And those people,
I believe in some sort of a weird

1710
01:22:24,741 --> 01:22:26,660
narcissistic way.
You could look at it this way,

1711
01:22:26,661 --> 01:22:28,610
that those people are there to teach
you.

1712
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,170
This is the consequences of not feeling
that awful feeling when you fail.

1713
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:36,050
Well,
that comes from the ego being so fragile

1714
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:41,090
that their ego is so fragile that they
can't accept the fact that they may have

1715
01:22:41,091 --> 01:22:44,720
not done a good job.
so they will manufacture ideas in their

1716
01:22:44,721 --> 01:22:47,210
heads so that they did a good job no
matter what,

1717
01:22:47,211 --> 01:22:49,730
because their ego can't take the truth
of the blow.

1718
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:50,541
Like,
man,

1719
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:51,730
you fucking bombed out

1720
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:54,820
there.
So it comes from insecurity and

1721
01:22:54,821 --> 01:22:59,380
fragility and then they create this
ridiculous story in their head about

1722
01:22:59,381 --> 01:23:03,910
what it is because they can't withstand
that truth because ultimately I think it

1723
01:23:03,911 --> 01:23:06,220
all comes from the same thing.
Lack of self love.

1724
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,350
That lack of ability to be like,
man,

1725
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:11,980
I fucking shit the bed and I'm okay.
Everything's okay.

1726
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,290
I'll be all right with,
you know,

1727
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,070
you know,
but the good ones can,

1728
01:23:15,071 --> 01:23:16,960
you know,
I was talking to bur,

1729
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:19,030
um,
couple of weeks ago he did a set at the

1730
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:21,760
comedy store and I saw part of it.
It was a,

1731
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:25,500
he was killing and then I ran into him
in the hallway and uh,

1732
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:26,381
I go,
oh man,

1733
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:27,670
main room show was great,
right?

1734
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:29,800
And he goes,
I fucked up.

1735
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:31,770
At the end thOugh,
I tried to hang in there too long.

1736
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:33,850
The last pit bomb,
like he was just,

1737
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:37,360
it was a rotten adam that the last bit
like he goes,

1738
01:23:37,361 --> 01:23:40,450
I fucking hung in there too long.
I should have got off of the bit before

1739
01:23:40,451 --> 01:23:41,770
that puck,
you know,

1740
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:42,760
like,
but you know,

1741
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:45,850
when I was in there he was fucking
killing you know.

1742
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:49,300
But that wasn't in his mind.
The success was not in his mind.

1743
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:50,800
This was like,
okay,

1744
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:53,950
whatever that happened at the end,
don't fucking do that again.

1745
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:57,250
But that's why he's bill burr.
That's why he's really good.

1746
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,353
And because he's so,
he's,

1747
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,780
he's able to take that feeling,
but at a certain point he'll be able to

1748
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,200
have a beer or drink or whatever,
you know,

1749
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:06,940
dinner and just laugh about it and he's
not going to carry that.

1750
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:09,520
Trauma exists forever.
It's just like feel it,

1751
01:24:09,521 --> 01:24:11,680
like fuck,
I could almost had it and that's

1752
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:14,140
healthy.
But then it ultimately you have to have

1753
01:24:14,141 --> 01:24:15,550
that moment of forgiveness really like,
yeah,

1754
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:16,300
fuck it.
Of course.

1755
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:19,390
Well that's the beauty of being a comic
as opposed to being a fighter.

1756
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:23,470
Because the comic can have that moment
and just the next night go on stage and

1757
01:24:23,471 --> 01:24:25,210
I'm sure he killed were my.

1758
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:28,360
He was killing like he's a super self
critical guy,

1759
01:24:28,361 --> 01:24:33,361
so whatever the bad moment at the very
end it was probably just fairly,

1760
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:39,040
you know,
like less funny than normal.

1761
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:40,330
You know what I mean?
I'm sure it was funny,

1762
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,820
but like for a fighter,
like,

1763
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:48,320
like here's a perfect example,
someone like luke rockhold who just got

1764
01:24:48,401 --> 01:24:50,170
knocked out one round by michael
bisping,

1765
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:54,460
he's got a fucking rot with that.
That's kind of chew away at him.

1766
01:24:54,461 --> 01:24:58,720
That mistake that he made for months and
months and months until he gets back in

1767
01:24:58,721 --> 01:25:01,150
there again.
And even if he wins his next fight,

1768
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:04,390
he didn't win that fight.
That fight is still there.

1769
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:08,800
The fight still gonna be chewing away at
him and if he's smart he'll keep that.

1770
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:11,950
That's a,
that's a little engine that when he's

1771
01:25:11,951 --> 01:25:14,980
thinking about like when he's at the top
of the hill and he's like,

1772
01:25:14,981 --> 01:25:16,060
has got to be the last sprint.

1773
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:19,300
That engine with like wrong bitch.
Michael bisping knocked you out and he

1774
01:25:19,301 --> 01:25:22,810
mocked you.
And it'll get right back to the bottom

1775
01:25:22,811 --> 01:25:26,890
of that hill and hopefully he won't blow
his joints out and break his body with

1776
01:25:26,891 --> 01:25:29,860
that kind of motivation because that
also can happen to people where they.

1777
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:34,960
Their Motivation sort of it out,
pushes the physical capacity of their

1778
01:25:34,961 --> 01:25:37,210
meat vehicle.
That's a possibility too.

1779
01:25:37,211 --> 01:25:38,770
You got to be real careful with that,
but.

1780
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:43,990
But that even though it seems like a
terrible thing that happened to him is

1781
01:25:43,991 --> 01:25:47,230
not just a good thing for him,
it's a good thing for all martial

1782
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:49,120
artists.
It's a good thing to understand.

1783
01:25:49,121 --> 01:25:51,850
You are a human being.
Your jaws made out of bone.

1784
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:56,560
Your skin is made out of flesh.
The nerves are just like anybody else's

1785
01:25:56,561 --> 01:25:59,140
nerves.
If you get cracked by a left hook,

1786
01:25:59,141 --> 01:26:01,210
the way michael bisping cracked,
luke rockhold,

1787
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,410
you're going night,
night,

1788
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,010
everybody goes night and unless

1789
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:06,890
your market,
and it just seems to be pretty fucking

1790
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:09,500
tremendous shots.
It just,

1791
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:13,160
it goes back to that idea that the act
is neither good nor bad.

1792
01:26:13,161 --> 01:26:16,000
It's how you respond to it.
You don't like another coop.

1793
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:18,500
Carlos castaneda,
he had a great quote that for the

1794
01:26:18,501 --> 01:26:20,960
ordinary person in everything,
his blessing or curse,

1795
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:24,440
but for the warrior,
they're only challenges and and that's

1796
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:27,080
really applies the fighting at this
point.

1797
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,560
That was neither a blessing nor curse
that he got knocked out by michael

1798
01:26:30,561 --> 01:26:34,310
bisping and his response to it.
Is he going to respond like gsp did when

1799
01:26:34,311 --> 01:26:36,590
he got knocked out by matt serra and
ringing.

1800
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,630
Oh,
revolutionized his fighting style and

1801
01:26:38,631 --> 01:26:41,060
become the legend that we know them
today.

1802
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:41,751
You know?
Yeah.

1803
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:44,720
Maybe the old gsp was more exciting,
but it carried way more risks.

1804
01:26:44,721 --> 01:26:47,140
So we adapted any became better and you
know,

1805
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:49,070
he became this indomitable force.

1806
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,810
See,
I don't even think the regular gsp was

1807
01:26:50,811 --> 01:26:52,420
more exciting that I,
I,

1808
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:54,950
you know,
exciting to me is a weird term.

1809
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:58,820
Like when I look at the gsp that
destroyed bj penn or john fitch,

1810
01:26:58,821 --> 01:27:01,710
that motherfucker was pretty god damn
exciting and that's post matt.

1811
01:27:01,970 --> 01:27:05,840
Matt serra I think,
but the matt serra a analogy is a

1812
01:27:05,841 --> 01:27:08,180
perfect one because it's the same sort
of thing.

1813
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:10,430
who's fighting a dangerous guy that he
underestimated.

1814
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,950
And by the way,
both of them won the ultimate fighter,

1815
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:15,320
so it's perfect.
Perfect analogy.

1816
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:20,830
And both of them were huge underdogs and
both of them went on to win with

1817
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:25,670
spectacular first round knockouts.
You gotta respect everybody and human

1818
01:27:25,671 --> 01:27:29,210
beings that are professional fighters.
Even if you think you're better than

1819
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:30,950
them,
they have weapons,

1820
01:27:30,951 --> 01:27:32,330
man,
they take people out,

1821
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:34,010
they all have.
And you're a person,

1822
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:37,400
but you think that because you beat
chris weidman,

1823
01:27:37,401 --> 01:27:40,130
you destroyed leo machida,
you beat the fuck out of all these

1824
01:27:40,131 --> 01:27:41,570
people and you strangled bisping.

1825
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:42,740
The first time you met him.
Me like,

1826
01:27:42,741 --> 01:27:44,150
there's no way this guy's going to beat
me.

1827
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:45,590
No way.
It's impossible.

1828
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:49,340
And so you go in there super relaxed.
And I remember when I was competing in

1829
01:27:49,341 --> 01:27:52,220
the taekwondo dates,
if I was relaxed and I didn't feel

1830
01:27:52,221 --> 01:27:53,510
nervous,
I felt like shit.

1831
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:55,440
Yeah,
it was terrible feeling like I,

1832
01:27:55,441 --> 01:27:59,000
I only fought well when I was scared.
And I think that's a,

1833
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,390
that's a really important point for
almost anybody you know,

1834
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,820
you,
you really have to have some element of

1835
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:08,000
danger involved in,
in the contest,

1836
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:10,410
if that's not there.
If you just like,

1837
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,160
you can't do shit to me,
you can't do shit to me,

1838
01:28:13,161 --> 01:28:14,210
and all of a sudden,
boom,

1839
01:28:14,211 --> 01:28:18,790
that left hook lands and your legs go
well,

1840
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,260
that's the.
That's a key characteristic of being in

1841
01:28:21,261 --> 01:28:23,310
flow state that the stakes have to be
high.

1842
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,490
Like everybody uses surfing as an
analogy.

1843
01:28:25,491 --> 01:28:29,570
Well you can serve some baby ass waves,
some two foot waves and a sand bottom

1844
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:30,980
and you're not going to get in flow
state.

1845
01:28:30,981 --> 01:28:32,900
You're just going to be kind of paddling
and cruising around,

1846
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:37,070
but you surf that gnarly fucking double
overhead on a reef,

1847
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:40,220
on a coral reef,
bottom fuck out of here and in flow

1848
01:28:40,221 --> 01:28:42,200
state,
let alone what like laird hamilton is

1849
01:28:42,201 --> 01:28:45,140
doing,
surfing those monsters when the stakes

1850
01:28:45,141 --> 01:28:48,860
are high and you're really feeling that
that's what drives you to your highest

1851
01:28:48,861 --> 01:28:51,620
performance level.
So shane dorian coming in next week,

1852
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:53,900
oh shit,
can't wait.

1853
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,390
Talk to that guy about sharks and shit.
Guys,

1854
01:28:58,410 --> 01:29:01,740
I'm an admin and he's a bow hunter to it
should be a lot of fun,

1855
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,090
but yeah,
these people that are,

1856
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:06,660
that are doing really exciting,
really dangerous things,

1857
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:10,350
they carry with them the consequences of
those really exciting,

1858
01:29:10,351 --> 01:29:13,650
really dangerous things like
occasionally you're gonna fail and when

1859
01:29:13,651 --> 01:29:16,590
you fail this,
an important to know that you can fail.

1860
01:29:16,591 --> 01:29:19,590
It's importAnt to know that no matter
how much you have mastered whatever

1861
01:29:19,591 --> 01:29:22,530
you're trying to do,
there are consequences to every zig and

1862
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:23,550
zag.
Yeah,

1863
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:26,190
you know,
it's just really about mastering the

1864
01:29:26,191 --> 01:29:29,400
ego.
The ego is the main thing that thwarts

1865
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:32,040
you on either side.
It gives you this false sense of

1866
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:35,580
confidence and importance.
I remember I was recently reading a ryan

1867
01:29:35,581 --> 01:29:38,700
holiday's new book.
Ego is the enemy and he has the story of

1868
01:29:38,701 --> 01:29:40,110
the persian king,
xerxes,

1869
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:43,650
you know,
who is a mortalized in 300 and whatnot,

1870
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:47,460
and this guy was such an egomaniac.
It makes sense that he got his ass

1871
01:29:47,461 --> 01:29:48,210
kicked,
you know,

1872
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:49,043
repeatedly.

1873
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:51,310
So they were building bridges over this
canal.

1874
01:29:51,311 --> 01:29:56,280
It's as the story that historians wrote
and the water came up there.

1875
01:29:56,281 --> 01:29:59,460
Storm came in storm surge and it wiped
out the bridges.

1876
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:04,260
Well then he ordered his men to take his
chains and lash the water 30 times as

1877
01:30:04,261 --> 01:30:05,480
punishment,
you know,

1878
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:07,260
for,
for knocking down the bridge.

1879
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,300
And he cut off the people's heads.
Who made the bridge?

1880
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:10,050
Right?
Oh,

1881
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:13,040
so this fucking ego maniac.
And then another storY where he,

1882
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:17,250
he's trying to build this tunnel under a
mountain and he sends a letter to the

1883
01:30:17,251 --> 01:30:18,960
mountain,
has his emissaries go out to announce

1884
01:30:18,961 --> 01:30:22,050
this letter to the mountain saying to
the mountain mountain,

1885
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:25,560
if you give us any trouble,
I will move you piece by piece into the

1886
01:30:25,561 --> 01:30:28,590
sea
king xerxes.

1887
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,830
What the fuck you talking about?
You know,

1888
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:33,980
so no,
just no acknowledgment.

1889
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:37,080
He's been fed his own bullshit so much
that he's just,

1890
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:41,550
he thinks he's god and he plays that
role and then he runs into 300 bad

1891
01:30:41,551 --> 01:30:45,780
motherfuckers at the hot gates that
their marbly and they just wipe out half

1892
01:30:45,781 --> 01:30:47,250
of his forces because he's just.

1893
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:51,270
He can't fucking see beyond it.
And there's so many ways that ego does

1894
01:30:51,271 --> 01:30:54,630
that either inflates you or it makes you
too fragile or you know,

1895
01:30:54,631 --> 01:30:56,760
and that's really,
if you're going to be good at anything,

1896
01:30:56,761 --> 01:30:58,500
you got to have to come and confront
that,

1897
01:30:58,530 --> 01:30:59,680
confront that beast.
Listen,

1898
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:01,500
isn't it?
The problem with royalty to is that it's

1899
01:31:01,501 --> 01:31:03,810
just sort of bestowed upon you.
It's not earned.

1900
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:07,020
And so you have this distorted
perception of your own greatness,

1901
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:08,490
right?
That's sort of,

1902
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:10,470
you could say that about a lot of hot
chicks.

1903
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:14,800
Yeah.
Royalty or like reality tv stars.

1904
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:18,000
It's the same thing.
You have all of this bestowed upon you

1905
01:31:18,001 --> 01:31:23,001
for some mysterious combination of luck
and timing and whatever.

1906
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,170
But royalties.
The weirdest example of it,

1907
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,260
you know,
I was at disneyland a few weeks back

1908
01:31:28,261 --> 01:31:31,410
with my family and uh,
I was talking to this guy that works

1909
01:31:31,411 --> 01:31:36,411
there and he was talking about this five
year old boy who was a prince from some

1910
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,760
middle eastern country.
And he came here with this huge group of

1911
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,460
guardians and watchers or whatever it
was,

1912
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:49,650
but they were all at his beck and call.
And so this five-year-old was telling

1913
01:31:49,651 --> 01:31:52,770
all these adults what he wanted,
when he wanted,

1914
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:55,770
what he wanted done,
and they all just scrambled and randall

1915
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:58,530
and he was saying like,
it was so bizarre watching all these

1916
01:31:58,531 --> 01:31:59,364
people

1917
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:05,010
at the wrath terrifying of the wrath of
a five year old boy and that this five

1918
01:32:05,111 --> 01:32:10,111
year old boy wielded just fucking like
supernatural power house.

1919
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:12,150
And he never earned any of it.
He's like,

1920
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:17,220
he was just born a five year old boy
who's born this little child and now

1921
01:32:17,411 --> 01:32:20,230
he's lived for five years.
He's just a boy.

1922
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:22,480
That's all he is.
Didn't that never done shit?

1923
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:24,040
Yeah.
But they're all like,

1924
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:26,690
you know,
I actually have a really unique

1925
01:32:26,691 --> 01:32:31,280
perspective on that because my parents
split when I was two and very quickly to

1926
01:32:31,281 --> 01:32:33,980
worlds develop.
My dad was wealthy commodities trader

1927
01:32:33,981 --> 01:32:38,981
and I was his only child on that side.
My mom remarried to a swat team,

1928
01:32:39,891 --> 01:32:42,640
squad leader who had three older boys,
you know.

1929
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:46,220
So those were my older stepbrother.
So at my dad's house I was the little

1930
01:32:46,221 --> 01:32:48,500
prince.
My dad was busy trading and doing his

1931
01:32:48,501 --> 01:32:53,501
thing and I had either body guards or
other people around and I could feel I

1932
01:32:53,961 --> 01:32:57,230
could,
would develop these punk tendencies that

1933
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:00,140
come from that,
from having basically servants taking

1934
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:03,530
care of me at the time,
and then I'd go back to my mother's

1935
01:33:03,531 --> 01:33:07,430
house and I split time half the week I
go back to my mother's house and my

1936
01:33:07,431 --> 01:33:10,640
three older stepbrothers would just beat
the punk out of me.

1937
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:13,460
Literally like,
what the fuck are you doing?

1938
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:15,680
You're like,
you're being ridiculous here.

1939
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:20,690
And so it allowed me this perspective
where I didn't get to go and follow down

1940
01:33:20,691 --> 01:33:23,540
that path too long because it's,
it's so alluring.

1941
01:33:23,541 --> 01:33:24,740
You know,
if you have power,

1942
01:33:24,741 --> 01:33:26,040
you're going to take it,
you know,

1943
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:28,010
especially if you're young,
you know,

1944
01:33:28,011 --> 01:33:29,210
I got all this power,
oh,

1945
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:31,250
I'm not going to take it.
I'm a five year old,

1946
01:33:31,251 --> 01:33:33,140
but I know what's right.
And I know,

1947
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:35,150
you know,
if you can do that and you can push

1948
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:37,430
those buttons,
you're for sure going to push those

1949
01:33:37,431 --> 01:33:39,860
buttons as a kid.
So it's important to,

1950
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:41,960
to have that balance.
Fortunately for me,

1951
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:45,410
I had the other side to keep me,
keep me in check because I serve,

1952
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:50,090
I surely would have been a fucking
menace if I had just gone down that

1953
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:54,400
perfect older stepbrothers two,
not brothers stepbrothers.

1954
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:56,570
Sure.
So they have no problem beating the shit

1955
01:33:56,571 --> 01:34:00,020
out of it.
I remember one time I came,

1956
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:03,320
they bought us all paintball guns and I
remember my,

1957
01:34:03,530 --> 01:34:08,180
one of my older stepbrothers just laid
in wait behind a wall like this.

1958
01:34:08,181 --> 01:34:12,380
We were on the property and you could
hear me coming and just shot me point

1959
01:34:12,381 --> 01:34:17,150
blank in the fucking face.
Paint ball gun just lit me up,

1960
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:18,500
you know.
And that's the thing,

1961
01:34:18,501 --> 01:34:20,510
like obviously at the time I was not
happy about it,

1962
01:34:20,511 --> 01:34:23,300
but this you learn,
you learn things about the world and you

1963
01:34:23,301 --> 01:34:27,590
get like a different toughness that
comes from that form of resistance that

1964
01:34:27,710 --> 01:34:30,770
if I didn't have that I wouldn't be
nearly the balance person.

1965
01:34:30,771 --> 01:34:31,790
I was uh,
you know,

1966
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:32,690
I am now.
I'm not fucking,

1967
01:34:32,691 --> 01:34:36,110
I'm not perfect or balanced or anything,
but that certainly helped.

1968
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:39,250
Yeah.
I think competition is good for that to

1969
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,750
failure.
Losing,

1970
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:41,823
you know.
Um,

1971
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:45,310
especially individual one on one type
competition when you realize the

1972
01:34:45,311 --> 01:34:49,120
consequences of not working hard and you
run into someone who has worked hard,

1973
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:51,820
you know,
I remember my competing days,

1974
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:54,370
I had a chance to see some,
uh,

1975
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,860
when I was 19 I went to the olympic
training center

1976
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:02,960
and there was the world cup in Colorado
springs and I got to see like the best

1977
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:07,820
of the world compete and I remember
seeing like this insanely high level and

1978
01:35:07,821 --> 01:35:11,030
it was one of the most important things
as far as like my development as a

1979
01:35:11,031 --> 01:35:13,790
competitor,
like seeing the top of the food chain,

1980
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:16,260
seeing the best guys and realizing like
fuck,

1981
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:18,380
look how hard they work.
Like jesus christ.

1982
01:35:18,381 --> 01:35:21,740
I was watching them train.
I was watching guys compete and I was

1983
01:35:21,741 --> 01:35:24,770
realizing like I'm not nearly as
dedicated as these people are.

1984
01:35:24,771 --> 01:35:28,550
I'm not nearly as.
I have to ramp it up like in a big,

1985
01:35:28,551 --> 01:35:29,780
big,
big fucking way.

1986
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:34,940
And seeing that and comparing yourself
against other people's efforts and

1987
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:38,030
realizing that your fall short so
critical for people.

1988
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:41,240
It's so critical to to realize like,
oh,

1989
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:43,280
that guy would fuck me up,
like look,

1990
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:46,070
because if you're that five-year-old
prints that five-year-old prints

1991
01:35:46,071 --> 01:35:48,110
probably has no idea that someone could
beat his ass,

1992
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,540
you know,
he probably just thinks he just gets to

1993
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:54,950
yell at you and you have to get on your
knees and start bowing and lowering your

1994
01:35:54,951 --> 01:35:59,951
head and if you,
if you don't experience other people's

1995
01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:04,040
efforts,
if you don't experience like a real

1996
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:09,020
competition where you see people pushing
themselves as far as they can to try to

1997
01:36:09,021 --> 01:36:13,730
win a race where you see the last few
meters of the race where guys,

1998
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:17,480
you could see it in their face,
the fucking struggle.

1999
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:21,230
If you never do that,
if you never do that,

2000
01:36:21,231 --> 01:36:26,231
if you never push to that very edge of
physical capacity,

2001
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:29,900
then you don't.
You don't really understand what's out

2002
01:36:29,901 --> 01:36:32,210
there.
It's like one of the reasons why people

2003
01:36:32,211 --> 01:36:35,660
who have never had a,
any martial arts experience at all or

2004
01:36:35,661 --> 01:36:39,830
don't know how to fight at all gets so
weird around confrontation with men.

2005
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,870
I mean,
how many times have you been around men

2006
01:36:42,050 --> 01:36:44,420
who don't know how to fight,
but all of a sudden they get a few

2007
01:36:44,421 --> 01:36:48,140
drinks in them and they start yelling at
people and talking crazy shit.

2008
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:50,490
It's like they don't know what to do.
It's almost,

2009
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:55,430
they're like confused and so they're.
They're almost inviting their own doom.

2010
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:59,390
They're almost like sending out a bat
signal for someone to punch them in the

2011
01:36:59,391 --> 01:37:01,430
face.
It's almost like a subconscious thing

2012
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:05,240
where they want someone to kick their
ass because they kind of know that

2013
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:07,330
they're so unbalanced in their approach.

2014
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:11,100
The fight club moment,
like they're running a light,

2015
01:37:11,101 --> 01:37:14,260
their own place on fire and beat
themselves up just to get that attribute

2016
01:37:14,261 --> 01:37:15,200
out.
But you see that.

2017
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:19,730
And the other thing is where people just
don't take the idea that there may be

2018
01:37:19,731 --> 01:37:23,180
consequences to their actions to heart.
Like I had a perfect example of this.

2019
01:37:23,181 --> 01:37:26,750
I was after partying with an ex gamer,
I won't mention anything farther than

2020
01:37:26,751 --> 01:37:28,010
that,
but an x game guy,

2021
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:33,220
super successful like 20,
like 20 year old kid and he's been so

2022
01:37:34,491 --> 01:37:37,250
successful for so long.
One of those child prodigies,

2023
01:37:37,251 --> 01:37:39,530
right?
And We go and he's,

2024
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:43,730
he's over at my apartment downtown in
austin and we were having fun and he

2025
01:37:43,731 --> 01:37:45,800
continues to.
He goes in immediately puts on his

2026
01:37:45,801 --> 01:37:47,900
music.
Then he cranks it all the way up to full

2027
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:48,411
volume.
I'm like,

2028
01:37:48,411 --> 01:37:49,970
yo man,
we got neighbors.

2029
01:37:49,971 --> 01:37:51,020
You can't do that shit.
You know,

2030
01:37:51,021 --> 01:37:52,190
you can't crank it up.
He's like,

2031
01:37:52,191 --> 01:37:54,260
okay.
And then he goes and he does it again.

2032
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:56,150
And he goes and he does it again and I
keep warning.

2033
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:56,993
I'm like,
man.

2034
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,100
So finally,
like time number five,

2035
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,330
I go up to him,
I go,

2036
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,820
you turn the fucking volume up,
shit's gonna,

2037
01:38:02,821 --> 01:38:04,890
get real.
And I looked at him with a total

2038
01:38:04,891 --> 01:38:07,440
different tone and then he looked at me
like,

2039
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:10,710
oh my god,
I didn't think that that consequences of

2040
01:38:10,711 --> 01:38:13,620
my actions was even a fucking feasible
possibility.

2041
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:15,930
Like that moment of like,
oh shit,

2042
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:19,980
this other dude may punch me if I
fucking do this again and be that

2043
01:38:19,981 --> 01:38:23,190
disrespectful.
It was like for him,

2044
01:38:23,191 --> 01:38:27,090
he had surrounded himself with other
people in this environment where just

2045
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:31,050
having respect for somebody in the
consequences for repeated disrespect

2046
01:38:31,051 --> 01:38:33,010
might actually be.
There was like a,

2047
01:38:33,011 --> 01:38:35,580
a world changing moment for him or he
looked up like,

2048
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:37,530
oh shit,
this is weird.

2049
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:39,000
Yeah,
I'm royalty.

2050
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:39,910
Yeah,
exactly.

2051
01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:41,460
You don't punch me.
Exactly.

2052
01:38:41,461 --> 01:38:44,280
And then after that he was like,
shook by it and he kept saying,

2053
01:38:44,290 --> 01:38:44,971
oh man,
you know,

2054
01:38:44,971 --> 01:38:46,260
no disrespect,
blah blah blah.

2055
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:49,380
But he needed that moment of like,
look bro,

2056
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:52,680
fucking shit Will get real.
There are consequences,

2057
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:55,080
you know,
this is not some fucking fantasy land

2058
01:38:55,081 --> 01:38:56,120
here.
You know?

2059
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:59,400
And then that moment totally changed,
totally changed things,

2060
01:38:59,401 --> 01:39:02,430
but people don't get those when they
don't have that resistance,

2061
01:39:02,431 --> 01:39:05,580
they don't have the older stepbrother,
they don't have that person that can

2062
01:39:05,581 --> 01:39:08,340
step in and be like,
yo fucking knock,

2063
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:11,460
knock that shit.
Attention to the other people to just do

2064
01:39:11,461 --> 01:39:12,660
what you want.
exactly.

2065
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:14,410
You know,
there's a thing about like,

2066
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,940
not necessarily just x gamers,
but people that do these extreme sports.

2067
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:21,580
There's a lot of these guys are like,
um,

2068
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:24,810
I don't want to say like pranksters,
but they,

2069
01:39:24,930 --> 01:39:29,920
they revel in annoying people and
pissing people off and the attention

2070
01:39:29,921 --> 01:39:33,490
that they get from it is real strange,
strange,

2071
01:39:33,491 --> 01:39:38,170
like sort of a vibe that comes with a
lot of bmx jumpers and all these crazy

2072
01:39:38,171 --> 01:39:42,040
fucks that do a lot of risky shit.
They have that sort of personality trait

2073
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:46,060
where they're constantly pushing the
envelope and some sort of a strange way.

2074
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:47,101
You know,
they,

2075
01:39:47,101 --> 01:39:50,080
they,
they like people pissed that I'm mad.

2076
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:52,020
You mad a,

2077
01:39:52,490 --> 01:39:55,440
it may come from the fact that
particularly skateboarders,

2078
01:39:55,441 --> 01:39:59,070
they're constantly getting persecuted by
lame ass authority figures telling them

2079
01:39:59,071 --> 01:40:01,010
not to skate on their fucking hand
rails.

2080
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:05,940
Some banker comes that don't scare on my
hand rails kid you fucking punk,

2081
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:07,710
you know,
instead of constantly being chased

2082
01:40:07,711 --> 01:40:11,640
around by people who are dummies and so
maybe it develops this kind of like

2083
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:13,100
counter,
you know,

2084
01:40:13,101 --> 01:40:14,130
this,
this reaction.

2085
01:40:14,131 --> 01:40:17,340
So that reaction of being persecuted for
doing what they're enjoying to do

2086
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:19,500
creates this like,
fuck the man.

2087
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:20,500
Yeah.
but maybe

2088
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:23,700
maybe they should yell at them.
Like if I was fucking walking down that

2089
01:40:23,930 --> 01:40:26,590
some dude came flying down the rail and
broke my leg.

2090
01:40:26,591 --> 01:40:28,030
I be like,
you piece of shit.

2091
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:30,610
Like a lot of those guys are fucking
nuts,

2092
01:40:30,611 --> 01:40:32,470
man.
And they'll put people in danger,

2093
01:40:32,710 --> 01:40:37,710
like I've seen some crazy stunts on
youtube where these dudes jump on top of

2094
01:40:37,811 --> 01:40:41,760
these railings and slide them to the
bottom and fuck up and plow into people.

2095
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:46,510
Like
the world is not an x game.

2096
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:49,810
Like you can't just,
you can't just do that with a bunch of

2097
01:40:49,811 --> 01:40:53,620
other people around.
But some of those folks care,

2098
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:56,680
certainly not.
And I think you,

2099
01:40:56,681 --> 01:40:59,200
we appreciate that.
Not giving a fuck like no.

2100
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:01,750
Johnny,
knoxville and steve.

2101
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:05,050
Oh steve,
he's still doing it.

2102
01:41:05,051 --> 01:41:07,060
He's,
he's like deep in his thirties.

2103
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:12,061
You still climbing up on top of gigantic
towers and cranes and shit and risking

2104
01:41:13,331 --> 01:41:14,140
his life.
Man.

2105
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:18,490
He fell off of a billboard.
He was climbing up on top of a billboard

2106
01:41:18,491 --> 01:41:21,130
to shit on seaworld to change.
uh,

2107
01:41:21,131 --> 01:41:25,530
a street sign.
What's is 42?

2108
01:41:25,531 --> 01:41:29,500
Is he jesus christ.
You can break a lot of shit falling from

2109
01:41:29,501 --> 01:41:31,150
that high.
And he fell.

2110
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:33,580
He's just so ridiculous.
He's hilarious though.

2111
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:37,660
He also did something that I was kind of
trying to tell them not to do.

2112
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:41,800
He had tim kennedy choke them out on it
is a showtime special.

2113
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:45,160
Tim kennedy choked him out.
He went completely unconscious and

2114
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:48,720
balanced his head off the ground called
blanca.

2115
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:53,260
I mean,
you mean if you ask tim kennedy to choke

2116
01:41:53,261 --> 01:41:55,150
you out,
you're going to sleepy sleep,

2117
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:55,984
sleep,
sleep.

2118
01:41:57,550 --> 01:41:59,830
That's deeper than red.
Is there a video that.

2119
01:41:59,831 --> 01:42:00,910
Oh,
jesus christ here.

2120
01:42:00,911 --> 01:42:01,870
Let's play it,
man.

2121
01:42:03,510 --> 01:42:04,343
Silica.
This.

2122
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:07,190
Oh my god.
There's no sound.

2123
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:10,370
Okay,
so he's not just choking him.

2124
01:42:10,371 --> 01:42:12,830
He's choking them for quite a feW
seconds.

2125
01:42:12,831 --> 01:42:16,130
He's already out.
Likely that that is not cool.

2126
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:18,920
Like tim shouldn't have done that.
Like right there,

2127
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:23,720
that drop.
That is a fucking huge head wound like

2128
01:42:23,721 --> 01:42:26,660
to to drop and bounce your head off the
ground like that.

2129
01:42:26,661 --> 01:42:29,500
That is really bad.
Really.

2130
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:31,310
tim should let that dude down.
A little lighter.

2131
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,930
That's probably steve o's agreements.
Diva wanted it to be fucking savage.

2132
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:42,990
Maybe you think he asked for that.
He didn't know then.

2133
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:45,000
Well,
tim should have known him.

2134
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:46,610
Doesn't give a fuck.
He's been knocked out.

2135
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,830
No,
he doesn't give a fuck if someone tells

2136
01:42:48,831 --> 01:42:49,870
them to do it.
Yeah.

2137
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:52,480
Got.
It's got a lot of that wolfington oh,

2138
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:57,230
what like 70 percent will get the joke
out and drop you for sure.

2139
01:42:57,470 --> 01:43:01,130
He has hashtag hard to kill on like half
of his fucking posts.

2140
01:43:01,370 --> 01:43:01,960
He,
he,

2141
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:06,170
he put a fucking post out with isis
giving his address.

2142
01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:06,831
I don't know,
like,

2143
01:43:06,831 --> 01:43:08,190
come get me bitch.
I don't know.

2144
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:10,340
He's a.
I mean I've gotten to know him really

2145
01:43:10,341 --> 01:43:13,430
well because he trains at on an academy
so I see them coming through there all

2146
01:43:13,431 --> 01:43:15,770
the time and just the sweetest dude too.
Great.

2147
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:19,190
And he shows up like no chip on his
shoulder.

2148
01:43:19,191 --> 01:43:21,410
No,
like you've comes in wearing silly

2149
01:43:21,411 --> 01:43:25,580
little shorts and a fanny pack and just
a big old smile on his face and a silly

2150
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:29,750
fucking mustache and he just,
he's got nothing to prove.

2151
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:31,370
But then he has that switch,
you know,

2152
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:32,240
obviousLy where

2153
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:37,780
he can do whatever access,
whatever that place is.

2154
01:43:37,781 --> 01:43:40,870
That fucking wolf heart.
is this a new post of his jamie that you

2155
01:43:40,871 --> 01:43:41,531
put up?
It says,

2156
01:43:41,531 --> 01:43:44,950
my friends and I are just kicking back
waiting for the call when we can fight

2157
01:43:44,951 --> 01:43:47,800
these bastards the way we need to and
not go to jail.

2158
01:43:48,130 --> 01:43:50,950
Hashtags still serving.
Hashtag hard to kill.

2159
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:56,500
Let us know when it's time.
He's got his shirt off with an axe with

2160
01:43:56,530 --> 01:44:00,590
one of those ridiculous.
What are those things called guy fawkes.

2161
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:02,380
Beard and mustache.
Yeah,

2162
01:44:02,410 --> 01:44:03,760
it is.
Yeah,

2163
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:05,930
like musketeers,
three musketeers style.

2164
01:44:05,931 --> 01:44:06,950
He's,
he's an animal,

2165
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:08,810
but we need people like that.
This,

2166
01:44:08,830 --> 01:44:09,730
this,
this.

2167
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,240
That's the extreme on the,
uh,

2168
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:15,470
on the warrior end of the spectrum.
That's the extreme,

2169
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:16,570
you know,
the,

2170
01:44:16,570 --> 01:44:19,090
the flamboyant warrior.
Yeah.

2171
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:23,100
The thing that you can really appreciate
is the truth of it.

2172
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:25,170
Like it cuts all the way through to the
core.

2173
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:26,490
You know,
the peopLe that are,

2174
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:30,210
that you shake them a little bit and
some other person emerges and you shake

2175
01:44:30,211 --> 01:44:31,970
them again,
like a fucking magic eight ball.

2176
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,450
That's gonna come out.
Like those are the people that are the

2177
01:44:35,451 --> 01:44:36,570
worst.
Tim,

2178
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,090
it's tim.
Tim,

2179
01:44:38,091 --> 01:44:38,930
it's tim.
You shake it again.

2180
01:44:38,931 --> 01:44:40,310
It's a little slightly angry or tim.

2181
01:44:41,110 --> 01:44:42,540
It's the same fucking guy.
And that's,

2182
01:44:42,730 --> 01:44:44,800
that's always a beautiful thing when you
see it.

2183
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:47,050
People have dealt with those deeper
things,

2184
01:44:47,051 --> 01:44:49,300
they've reconciled all these forces
that,

2185
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:51,010
you know,
you're not going to put them in a

2186
01:44:51,011 --> 01:44:53,410
situation where this other person
emerges and you're like,

2187
01:44:53,411 --> 01:44:55,570
what the fuck is this selfish piece of
shit

2188
01:44:55,610 --> 01:44:56,360
guy?
You know?

2189
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:58,430
Yeah.
And this is also something that we were

2190
01:44:58,431 --> 01:45:02,570
talking about earlier when you were
talking about people like the,

2191
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:05,630
the camaraderie and the craziness of
going to war,

2192
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:10,940
that they actually enjoy it and become
happy there and some sort of a weird way

2193
01:45:10,941 --> 01:45:15,110
because life becomes real because life
becomes real in this chaotic moment.

2194
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:18,770
There was a ta,
I think it was a ted radio hour.

2195
01:45:18,771 --> 01:45:21,860
It might have been a radiolab podcast.
I think it was a ted radio hour,

2196
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:26,420
but they were talking to someone who
there were talking to soldiers and they

2197
01:45:26,421 --> 01:45:28,940
were talking to people about happiness.
Like what makes you.

2198
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:31,280
It wasn't ted show,
it was a ted talk and it was.

2199
01:45:31,330 --> 01:45:33,440
They were talking about happiness and
I'm.

2200
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:37,790
One of the things they got into was
these people that went over to Iraq and

2201
01:45:37,791 --> 01:45:41,630
Afghanistan and served and they would
come back and talk about it and they

2202
01:45:41,631 --> 01:45:43,910
said it was horrific.
It was chaotic.

2203
01:45:43,911 --> 01:45:46,070
It was scary,
but it was the happiest days of my life

2204
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:49,190
and one of the reasons why I was the
happiest days of their life was this

2205
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:54,380
intense bond and comradery that they had
developed with these other people that

2206
01:45:54,381 --> 01:45:55,250
they were serving.
With.

2207
01:45:55,280 --> 01:46:00,280
That there was nothing like it.
There's no sort of closeness and bond of

2208
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:05,090
brotherhood that even comes close to the
bond of brotherhood when you need to

2209
01:46:05,091 --> 01:46:09,800
rely on these people and they rely on
you for your very life and you're taking

2210
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:10,820
other people's lives.

2211
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:13,550
Yeah.
I think that's a huge missing piece in

2212
01:46:13,551 --> 01:46:17,600
our society and I think a few people get
to access it on sports teams and,

2213
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:19,620
and on different,
you know,

2214
01:46:19,621 --> 01:46:23,690
and obviously in war,
but I think that tribal element of going

2215
01:46:23,691 --> 01:46:26,900
through these shared rites of passages
and going through these things that

2216
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:32,140
bonded a group together so that you
really had true altruistic love for more

2217
01:46:32,901 --> 01:46:34,790
of the more people around you.
You know,

2218
01:46:34,791 --> 01:46:37,490
I think that's a deep calling that we've
kind of ignored,

2219
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,920
you know,
like those soldiers would truly fight

2220
01:46:39,921 --> 01:46:44,210
and die for each other,
which is the epitome of altruism.

2221
01:46:44,211 --> 01:46:47,900
It's wanting the other person's good
even at the cost of your own,

2222
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:48,830
you know,
and,

2223
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:52,410
and that's a feeling that I think feels
inherently the best.

2224
01:46:52,411 --> 01:46:55,920
It's our natural state to be this like
the son of love,

2225
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:56,401
you know,
like,

2226
01:46:56,401 --> 01:46:58,770
uh,
like Just pouring it out and not

2227
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:02,580
deciding who gets a bit truly feeling
that way about a group of people.

2228
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,650
And I think there's,
you know,

2229
01:47:04,651 --> 01:47:08,100
as we develop.
I think that's one of the concepts that

2230
01:47:08,101 --> 01:47:12,630
I'm always talking about is recreating
some kind of tribal element where you do

2231
01:47:12,631 --> 01:47:15,660
go through these rites of passage and it
doesn't have to involve war,

2232
01:47:15,661 --> 01:47:19,620
which is inherently an unsustainable and
unnecessary practice,

2233
01:47:19,621 --> 01:47:21,660
but how do you create that same
closeness,

2234
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:24,210
but do it through ritual,
do it through,

2235
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,640
you know,
going and climbing this mountain and

2236
01:47:26,641 --> 01:47:30,090
taking the psychedelic,
however you want to do it in a way that

2237
01:47:30,091 --> 01:47:33,810
can bond you together with the group so
you have those feelings where there's

2238
01:47:33,811 --> 01:47:34,710
no,
there's nothing.

2239
01:47:34,711 --> 01:47:37,170
You're holding back.
Your truth is completely exposed.

2240
01:47:37,171 --> 01:47:40,720
You're naked with all your intentions
and thoughts and ideas and you just

2241
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:44,460
truly want the best for another
individual and and that tribe,

2242
01:47:44,461 --> 01:47:47,580
that feeling of tribe.
That's what tribe is and I think we're

2243
01:47:47,581 --> 01:47:49,890
missing that.
We have this ourselves in the small

2244
01:47:49,891 --> 01:47:54,750
nuclear unit and then we have this whole
wide world which is too big to really

2245
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:58,410
care to that degree about and we're
missing the intermediary,

2246
01:47:58,411 --> 01:48:00,300
which is Just this band,
this group,

2247
01:48:00,301 --> 01:48:03,030
this family that were willing to do
anything for.

2248
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:06,070
Yeah,
and then obviously expanding that even

2249
01:48:06,071 --> 01:48:08,680
further from your media group to the
rest of the human race.

2250
01:48:08,710 --> 01:48:13,710
Yeah.
So difficult to even conceptualize when

2251
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:18,210
tim kennedy fought,
there was a fight for the troops and um,

2252
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:21,910
I believe it was in Texas.
Was that where it was?

2253
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:26,950
He fought half natal and he knocked him
out and this was like,

2254
01:48:27,310 --> 01:48:29,320
I don't think they even captured this on
film.

2255
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:35,010
Tim hopped on top of the fence and he
was just calling out to all the troops.

2256
01:48:36,701 --> 01:48:37,870
I mean,
I really don't think.

2257
01:48:38,050 --> 01:48:40,690
I don't know if the camera's caught this
or not,

2258
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:44,350
but he was pointing to everybody who's
just telling them he loved them.

2259
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:46,270
He's like,
I love you guys.

2260
01:48:46,271 --> 01:48:48,460
I love all you guys.
I was pointing at people,

2261
01:48:48,461 --> 01:48:51,110
I love you guys.
And then like what,

2262
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:53,560
what he was doing,
he served.

2263
01:48:53,561 --> 01:48:54,790
He's fought.
I mean he's,

2264
01:48:54,791 --> 01:48:56,680
he served in combat many,
many times.

2265
01:48:56,681 --> 01:49:01,681
He's still serving now that the reality
of like his expression and his love for

2266
01:49:02,981 --> 01:49:04,660
those people,
it was very,

2267
01:49:04,661 --> 01:49:08,200
very intensely moving.
It was one of the most intensely moving

2268
01:49:08,230 --> 01:49:12,090
post-fight speeches or post-fight
celebrations I've ever expect.

2269
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:15,580
Not not one of the most that I've ever
experienced

2270
01:49:15,790 --> 01:49:18,610
and they,
they were pushing so much energy back

2271
01:49:18,611 --> 01:49:22,600
them chanting and it was tense.
ReallY amazing moment.

2272
01:49:22,601 --> 01:49:23,530
I mean,
you imagine those,

2273
01:49:23,740 --> 01:49:28,570
you read about those moments in history
where the great leaders come in and have

2274
01:49:28,571 --> 01:49:30,550
that moment with their,
with their troops,

2275
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:33,190
you know,
and you don't see that now in today's

2276
01:49:33,191 --> 01:49:34,001
warfare,
you know,

2277
01:49:34,001 --> 01:49:35,010
there's no,
there's no that,

2278
01:49:35,270 --> 01:49:39,370
that independence day moment right now
where they give that rousing speech and

2279
01:49:39,371 --> 01:49:42,020
everybody's just pounding their chest
and you know,

2280
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:45,070
that was.
That's something that's really deeply,

2281
01:49:45,190 --> 01:49:47,800
deeply moving and powerful and to have
that,

2282
01:49:47,801 --> 01:49:48,280
you need

2283
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:52,450
to have that force of resistance that
you're all allied against,

2284
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:56,230
your all banded together against that,
that other thing,

2285
01:49:56,530 --> 01:50:00,500
and it's just choosing a thing that is
truly worthy of,

2286
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:03,640
of your fight.
So choosing to fight against something

2287
01:50:03,641 --> 01:50:07,420
that's not just another people or
another race or all the stupid things

2288
01:50:07,421 --> 01:50:10,360
that we choose to fight against,
but choosing to fight against something

2289
01:50:10,361 --> 01:50:12,670
truly worthy of that fight.
Yeah,

2290
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:15,310
and this,
this thing to them,

2291
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:20,340
to these soldiers was this concept of
the enemy being a truly evil force,

2292
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,520
you know,
whether it's isis or whether it's

2293
01:50:24,521 --> 01:50:28,570
anything else like these guys were all
united against it and to have tim

2294
01:50:28,571 --> 01:50:33,100
kennedy as this person who's like a
figurehead representing them and win by

2295
01:50:33,101 --> 01:50:38,101
knockout in a military base in such a
spectacular fashion on television and

2296
01:50:38,201 --> 01:50:41,230
understanding all the weight behind all
that because there are cameras.

2297
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:44,080
It is being televised.
It is being broadcast all throughout the

2298
01:50:44,081 --> 01:50:48,530
world that will be available for ever on
the internet and you know,

2299
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:51,880
through the ufc fight pass archives.
You'll always be able to watch that.

2300
01:50:52,270 --> 01:50:54,220
And when he,
when he connected with that left hook

2301
01:50:54,221 --> 01:50:57,700
and the crowd fucking roared and natal
went out.

2302
01:50:57,970 --> 01:50:58,960
It was nuts,
man.

2303
01:50:58,961 --> 01:51:00,330
It was nuts.
You know,

2304
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:03,490
you like history,
especially the history of rome,

2305
01:51:03,491 --> 01:51:06,910
which I'm most familiar with.
There was always these moments in time

2306
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:11,020
where a leader would naturally emerge
like that for whatever reason,

2307
01:51:11,021 --> 01:51:14,380
and then it would always made the
emperor is really squirrely because at

2308
01:51:14,381 --> 01:51:17,050
any point in time that person could all
of a sudden be like,

2309
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:20,110
yep,
my army now bitch deal with,

2310
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:22,600
you know,
obviously that can't happen in that

2311
01:51:22,601 --> 01:51:23,770
time.
But if tim said,

2312
01:51:23,970 --> 01:51:26,080
you know,
if tim after that Jumped off the cage

2313
01:51:26,081 --> 01:51:28,210
and said,
follow me,

2314
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:29,440
like,
fucking all of them,

2315
01:51:29,441 --> 01:51:30,071
be like,
yeah,

2316
01:51:30,071 --> 01:51:30,710
fuck it.

2317
01:51:30,710 --> 01:51:33,250
I'm going to tim,
tim kennedy and brian stann run for

2318
01:51:33,251 --> 01:51:34,390
president.
I'm in.

2319
01:51:34,810 --> 01:51:36,010
Totally.
I'm in.

2320
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:38,470
I'll campaign.
I'll fucking,

2321
01:51:38,471 --> 01:51:42,100
I'll follow them around the country.
We know that's what we need.

2322
01:51:42,101 --> 01:51:46,480
We need someone who understands the
realities and the consequences of what

2323
01:51:46,481 --> 01:51:51,481
these people in these hallowed halls of
justice are trying to pull off all

2324
01:51:53,051 --> 01:51:55,800
throughout the world.
Instead of having these old chicken

2325
01:51:55,801 --> 01:51:59,770
hawks or sydney's has a hose.
Was.

2326
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:04,000
It was from.
There was one of the best quotes from

2327
01:52:04,570 --> 01:52:07,600
the documentary on hunter s thompson
where he was,

2328
01:52:07,601 --> 01:52:09,070
uh,
talking to.

2329
01:52:09,110 --> 01:52:13,930
It wasn't ed muskie.
It was a mcgovern and mcgovern was

2330
01:52:13,931 --> 01:52:18,340
saying I'm sick of old venn in air
conditioned buildings,

2331
01:52:18,370 --> 01:52:21,400
sending young men to go off and die in
war,

2332
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:26,200
and that's,
that's really one of the most despIcable

2333
01:52:26,201 --> 01:52:31,201
aspects of the decision making process
by quote unquote leaders is that there

2334
01:52:32,130 --> 01:52:33,790
their consequences are so minimal.

2335
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:37,780
I mean if,
if every single politician and leader

2336
01:52:37,781 --> 01:52:42,310
had to be at the head of the army,
had to go to the fray,

2337
01:52:42,610 --> 01:52:47,610
had to be on the front lines.
How many actual wars where we get into

2338
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:50,930
or serve,
let's say they weren't Capable of

2339
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:52,790
fighting,
but at least they'd have to serve at the

2340
01:52:52,791 --> 01:52:56,480
frontline hospital so that every person
with like for a week,

2341
01:52:56,510 --> 01:52:57,710
you know,
you're at the front lines,

2342
01:52:57,711 --> 01:52:59,830
you're just a nurse assistant,
you know,

2343
01:52:59,950 --> 01:53:03,140
so everybody coming back blown up,
shrapnel you know,

2344
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:05,420
sent.
Can you pass this message to my

2345
01:53:05,421 --> 01:53:07,310
sweetheart,
tell this to my mother.

2346
01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:10,490
Like they're receiving that.
So at least they have to get in touch

2347
01:53:10,491 --> 01:53:13,430
with it and,
and understand the consequences of what

2348
01:53:13,431 --> 01:53:16,670
they're doing.
But it's easy to get this sociopathic

2349
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:17,780
kind of mindset like,
oh,

2350
01:53:17,781 --> 01:53:19,760
these are just pieces of those,
you know,

2351
01:53:19,761 --> 01:53:23,900
those like the conquest boards,
it looked like big chess boards you see

2352
01:53:23,901 --> 01:53:26,930
in all of game of thrones or whatever
know I moved my troops here,

2353
01:53:26,931 --> 01:53:27,290
I move.

2354
01:53:27,290 --> 01:53:30,410
this becomes all strategy.
But you lose the humanity of it,

2355
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:33,710
you know,
you lose that connection with really who

2356
01:53:33,711 --> 01:53:36,440
you're dealing with.
And those moments are incredibly

2357
01:53:36,441 --> 01:53:39,920
important to,
to really keep the thing going and keep.

2358
01:53:40,010 --> 01:53:41,960
Keep you,
keep you in line.

2359
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:42,860
Yeah.
And people would say,

2360
01:53:42,861 --> 01:53:44,240
well,
if they did do that,

2361
01:53:44,241 --> 01:53:46,850
what would it be?
Impossible the way we need it and the

2362
01:53:46,851 --> 01:53:47,780
way we do it now.
Yeah,

2363
01:53:47,781 --> 01:53:48,830
exactly.
Yeah,

2364
01:53:48,831 --> 01:53:50,140
don't do it that way.
You fuck.

2365
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:53,480
I'm trying to say it's one of the main
problems with,

2366
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:58,310
with war and with leadership is that the
people that are in charge at the very

2367
01:53:58,311 --> 01:54:02,450
top and a lot of ways are behaving like
that five year old boy at disneyland is

2368
01:54:02,451 --> 01:54:05,330
a prince.
They have too much power with no

2369
01:54:05,331 --> 01:54:07,610
consequences.
They have too much power that

2370
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:10,040
essentially they haven't really earned.
You know,

2371
01:54:10,041 --> 01:54:12,590
when you've got a guy like jocko willink
who,

2372
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:17,660
uh,
was a real military hero who is over

2373
01:54:17,661 --> 01:54:22,070
there commanding when that guy talks
about the military or talks about war or

2374
01:54:22,071 --> 01:54:26,300
talks about actions,
the respect is that you don't need to

2375
01:54:26,301 --> 01:54:27,134
respect him.

2376
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:30,230
You're going to respect him.
You got to understand that this is a guy

2377
01:54:30,231 --> 01:54:32,810
who's been there and you're going to
listen because it's real.

2378
01:54:33,230 --> 01:54:38,230
When a guy like dick cheney started
talking about military actions,

2379
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:43,810
you're dealing with some fucking weird
detachment from the reality and

2380
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:49,691
consequences of war from a guy who
during the Iraq invasion a lot of the

2381
01:54:50,601 --> 01:54:53,540
times was in a bunker member,
that member,

2382
01:54:53,541 --> 01:54:57,140
they would talk about him being in some
underground bunker and I was always

2383
01:54:57,141 --> 01:54:59,000
like,
why is dick cheney in the bunker?

2384
01:54:59,001 --> 01:55:02,930
And george w dot bush is on tv.
I will fuck is running this country for

2385
01:55:02,931 --> 01:55:06,080
real.
But these guys that got multiple

2386
01:55:06,081 --> 01:55:10,370
deferments like dick cheney did to avoid
actually serving in the war.

2387
01:55:10,610 --> 01:55:13,520
I mean,
I think he got several deferments to

2388
01:55:13,521 --> 01:55:16,460
avoid having to actual see,
actually see real combat.

2389
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:20,120
Those are not the people that she'd ever
be able to make those kinds of decisions

2390
01:55:20,121 --> 01:55:21,740
to put people in harm's way.

2391
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:24,710
They just shouldn't be able to.
You need a guy like jocko.

2392
01:55:24,711 --> 01:55:28,070
You need a guy like tim kennedy.
You need someone who's actually been

2393
01:55:28,071 --> 01:55:28,940
there.
Yeah,

2394
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:29,841
yeah,
no doubt.

2395
01:55:29,841 --> 01:55:32,480
It's,
it's an interesting time and the nature

2396
01:55:32,481 --> 01:55:35,090
of war is.
I don't think we're obviously with

2397
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:38,840
posttraumatic stress being such an
epidemic that it is now.

2398
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:43,590
We're not adequately dealing with,
with that element of things.

2399
01:55:43,591 --> 01:55:46,380
I mean,
it's an incredibly traumatic aspect of

2400
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:50,580
we're not prepared for death can come at
any moment unseen,

2401
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:52,110
you know,
like our bodies.

2402
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:53,010
Yeah,
it makes sense.

2403
01:55:53,011 --> 01:55:54,600
All right.
There's the barbarian hoard.

2404
01:55:54,601 --> 01:55:58,680
They're gonna run with their pointy
thing and I'm going to have time to run

2405
01:55:58,681 --> 01:56:01,980
at them with my pointy thing and that's
when death might come,

2406
01:56:02,130 --> 01:56:04,950
you know,
but does not gonna come from this random

2407
01:56:04,951 --> 01:56:06,790
explosion that happens.
You know,

2408
01:56:06,970 --> 01:56:09,120
every car could be a bomb.
All of this.

2409
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:13,200
It's this crazy time that we're in and
we have to really pay attention to what

2410
01:56:13,201 --> 01:56:17,460
that's doing to the humans and use the
best technology available to to fix

2411
01:56:17,461 --> 01:56:19,290
that.
And I think obviously rick doblin has

2412
01:56:19,291 --> 01:56:21,420
been on here a few times,
is on the forefront of that,

2413
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:24,420
but we're just looking at the whole
thing completely wrong.

2414
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,010
You know,
we have old ideas,

2415
01:56:26,011 --> 01:56:27,540
bad ideas,
bad leaders,

2416
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:29,850
and it's again,
that thing where truth is there.

2417
01:56:30,090 --> 01:56:31,740
We undersTand that there's this
epidemic.

2418
01:56:31,741 --> 01:56:34,470
We understand,
here's some possible ways to fix it,

2419
01:56:34,471 --> 01:56:36,930
but it hasn't percolated all the way
through.

2420
01:56:36,931 --> 01:56:38,790
So we're in this transition period.
That's,

2421
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:39,581
you know,
it's,

2422
01:56:39,581 --> 01:56:42,840
it's ugly right now and a lot of ways,
but you can see the,

2423
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:45,750
you can see the horizon,
you see that sun poking through the

2424
01:56:45,751 --> 01:56:48,870
clouds and you know that truth just has
a different resonance.

2425
01:56:48,871 --> 01:56:52,020
It has a different frequency and it's
adopted eventually.

2426
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:52,490
You know,
it's,

2427
01:56:52,490 --> 01:56:53,660
it's only,
you know,

2428
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:56,700
there'll be people who still think
there's flat earth and whatever.

2429
01:56:56,850 --> 01:56:59,680
There'll be some resistance to be some
resistance.

2430
01:57:00,630 --> 01:57:03,630
But for most of us,
it has that frequency in that resonance

2431
01:57:03,631 --> 01:57:07,590
where it's going to eventually win.
And that's what gives me a lot of

2432
01:57:07,591 --> 01:57:08,520
confidence.
I'm just kidding.

2433
01:57:08,521 --> 01:57:12,050
I'm eddie said he doesn't believe he
does post a lot of pictures of the

2434
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:17,820
whole video the other day about some
dude who's arguing against the flat

2435
01:57:17,821 --> 01:57:20,040
earth and,
or for the flat earth in the weirdest

2436
01:57:20,041 --> 01:57:23,460
way possible.
But it's what I was talking about before

2437
01:57:23,461 --> 01:57:25,260
that I don't know if I articulated it so
well,

2438
01:57:25,261 --> 01:57:30,261
is that when you look at our culture and
look at society and then you think back

2439
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:35,480
to the time of xerxes and all the crazy
shit that was going on thousand years

2440
01:57:36,150 --> 01:57:37,350
ago or 2000 years ago.

2441
01:57:37,470 --> 01:57:38,760
That's not that long ago,
man.

2442
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:39,811
No,
it's not.

2443
01:57:39,811 --> 01:57:41,700
It seems like it is.
It seems like it is.

2444
01:57:41,701 --> 01:57:43,420
But like when,
uh,

2445
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:46,860
I was listening to a dan carlin's
hardcore history and he was talking

2446
01:57:46,861 --> 01:57:51,861
about world war world war one.
And he does this amazing.

2447
01:57:51,950 --> 01:57:54,060
Um,
I think it's a five part series on world

2448
01:57:54,061 --> 01:57:56,550
war one and it sinks in like jesus
christ.

2449
01:57:56,551 --> 01:57:59,730
I was 100 years ago.
like that's nothing that is fucking,

2450
01:57:59,731 --> 01:58:04,731
nothing like that is so recent and the
world is so different now than 100 years

2451
01:58:05,701 --> 01:58:07,680
ago in 100 years before that.
So different.

2452
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:08,693
And then,
you know,

2453
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:11,760
he does.
He had this piece on the mongols a

2454
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:12,301
thousand years ago.
Well,

2455
01:58:12,301 --> 01:58:13,800
not much different,
you know,

2456
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:15,990
it's like,
I mean,

2457
01:58:15,991 --> 01:58:19,170
not much different in terms of the
relationship between then and now.

2458
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:20,193
It's,
it's so,

2459
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:22,140
so recent.
So recent.

2460
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:25,200
Yeah.
A thousand years is nothing in the scope

2461
01:58:25,201 --> 01:58:26,070
of the world.

2462
01:58:26,110 --> 01:58:27,090
Right.
you know,

2463
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:30,090
and then you take it back it out to,
you know,

2464
01:58:30,091 --> 01:58:33,440
some graham hancock's theories that he
puts out magicians which are seemingly

2465
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:37,550
make a lot of sense that we'd reached
heightened states before and gotten kind

2466
01:58:37,551 --> 01:58:40,290
of wiped out and restarted.
How many times did that happen?

2467
01:58:40,550 --> 01:58:42,280
Well,
how many times did we restart?

2468
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:45,040
Hit the reset button.
One hundred percent with randall

2469
01:58:45,041 --> 01:58:47,710
carlson's evidence with the two of them
together.

2470
01:58:47,711 --> 01:58:50,890
They really sort of both provided the
missing pieces that each other need.

2471
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:54,040
And if you've never heard those
podcasts,

2472
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:56,260
there's some of my all time favorite
podcasts,

2473
01:58:56,261 --> 01:58:59,380
the randall carlson ones and the graham
hancock ones and the one time that I had

2474
01:58:59,381 --> 01:59:01,810
the two of them on together,
which is just a fucking epic meeting of

2475
01:59:01,811 --> 01:59:04,780
the minds.
The world is most likely experienced

2476
01:59:04,781 --> 01:59:08,920
some cataclysmic disasters,
most likely due to asteroidal impacts

2477
01:59:09,370 --> 01:59:13,600
and it was most likely the cause of the
end of the ice age.

2478
01:59:13,930 --> 01:59:18,930
And also the collapse of civilization
was available then and the rebirth of

2479
01:59:19,781 --> 01:59:22,510
what we're seeing now as ancient
history.

2480
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:25,510
So when we look back at things six,
7,000 years ago,

2481
01:59:25,511 --> 01:59:26,344
we think,
wow,

2482
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:29,230
this is the dawn of civilization,
not so fast.

2483
01:59:29,710 --> 01:59:34,710
This is the dawn of this current era of
civilization before we get hit again.

2484
01:59:35,530 --> 01:59:38,950
And that is entirely possible and it's
the crest of this wave.

2485
01:59:38,951 --> 01:59:42,220
Maybe they got,
maybe they got hit in the 19 twenties

2486
01:59:42,221 --> 01:59:44,260
level of technology or something like
that,

2487
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:45,150
you know,
but,

2488
01:59:45,150 --> 01:59:48,040
but.
And they didn't reach 2016 level,

2489
01:59:48,041 --> 01:59:51,370
which is probably most likely.
I think we've probably advanced the

2490
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:54,850
farthest that we've gone in the wave.
But who knows how far they got,

2491
01:59:54,851 --> 01:59:59,050
maybe it was 1850 where they're shooting
fucking revolvers and fucking whores and

2492
01:59:59,051 --> 02:00:02,500
saloons and whatever.
Or maybe it was some amalgamation,

2493
02:00:02,501 --> 02:00:04,060
surely was different.
It's going to be.

2494
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:07,240
They'd had some things that may be
better and other things that we're still

2495
02:00:07,241 --> 02:00:08,950
kind of silly and.
Yeah,

2496
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:13,510
but it's really interesting to explore
that and give yourself some perspective

2497
02:00:13,570 --> 02:00:14,490
on.
Yeah,

2498
02:00:14,491 --> 02:00:18,970
they have some sort of a parallel
development in terms of their

2499
02:00:18,971 --> 02:00:21,130
achievement,
but in a different way.

2500
02:00:21,190 --> 02:00:25,120
Like Egypt to this day we,
we can't build those fucking buildings

2501
02:00:25,121 --> 02:00:26,890
the way they did it.
And people could say,

2502
02:00:26,891 --> 02:00:29,320
oh,
we certainly could 2 million,

2503
02:00:29,321 --> 02:00:33,460
500,000 stones that way,
between two and 80 tons.

2504
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:38,760
If you put 10 of those a day in place,
it would take you 600 plus years to make

2505
02:00:39,251 --> 02:00:42,790
the great pyramid of giza.
That's how fucking crazy that building

2506
02:00:42,791 --> 02:00:43,960
is.
So if you say,

2507
02:00:43,961 --> 02:00:46,150
we could build that today,
good luck,

2508
02:00:46,151 --> 02:00:47,850
bitch.
Need more faith in the unions.

2509
02:00:47,860 --> 02:00:49,810
Yeah,
well if you get it done,

2510
02:00:49,930 --> 02:00:54,930
if you're off by literally like a
quarter of a centimeter with each block,

2511
02:00:54,941 --> 02:00:56,710
you're fucked by the time you get to the
top.

2512
02:00:56,950 --> 02:01:00,220
Yeah.
Think of that like if you're lopsided

2513
02:01:00,221 --> 02:01:02,800
one way or the other,
by the time you get to the top you're

2514
02:01:02,801 --> 02:01:05,410
fucking doomed.
This an interesting theories about how

2515
02:01:05,411 --> 02:01:09,940
they did it,
but none of them really sink in.

2516
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:15,120
All we definitely know is it took an
incredible level of sophistication and

2517
02:01:16,690 --> 02:01:20,440
it was done.
The most recent it could have happened

2518
02:01:20,441 --> 02:01:23,720
was 2,500 bc,
which is just nuts,

2519
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:27,250
nuts.
They're so smart and it's not just

2520
02:01:27,251 --> 02:01:28,600
Egypt.
You're going to go to Peru.

2521
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:32,830
I think I've shared that photo of me and
one tombow the same one that crazy

2522
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:35,860
sucralose shared as well.
You go there and you look the way the

2523
02:01:35,861 --> 02:01:39,440
stones fit together and look at how the
things are carved out and it just make

2524
02:01:39,441 --> 02:01:43,520
any sense the size of the stones,
like what did you do?

2525
02:01:43,521 --> 02:01:45,620
How'd you do this?
God,

2526
02:01:45,621 --> 02:01:48,500
I would give so much to see the
construction of the pyramids.

2527
02:01:48,770 --> 02:01:53,150
If there was like one time in history,
if you could take that sort of a time

2528
02:01:53,151 --> 02:01:55,250
capsule and go back and watch.
For me,

2529
02:01:55,251 --> 02:01:57,830
it would be ancient Egypt for me for
sure.

2530
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:01,550
I would want to see how those crazy
fuckers walking around with their wacky

2531
02:02:01,551 --> 02:02:06,551
goth makeup on and weird golden robes
and making those hieroglyphs and god

2532
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:14,350
what a fascinating,
weird blip or weird era in the.

2533
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:18,410
The development of the human mind and of
culture.

2534
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:22,670
If you think of what they were capable
of doing and what they did accomplish

2535
02:02:22,910 --> 02:02:24,170
over.
Who knows how many.

2536
02:02:24,380 --> 02:02:24,761
You know,
we're.

2537
02:02:24,761 --> 02:02:27,470
We're sort of going back trying to piece
it all together.

2538
02:02:27,471 --> 02:02:30,500
But one of the things that graham
hancock and even more importantly,

2539
02:02:30,501 --> 02:02:34,220
John Anthony West,
John Anthony West has a new series.

2540
02:02:34,221 --> 02:02:37,820
Apparently a magical Egypt too.
I haven't seen it yet,

2541
02:02:37,821 --> 02:02:42,770
but magical Egypt one is just fucking
mind blowing when he goes into great

2542
02:02:42,771 --> 02:02:47,240
detail about the different construction
methods from the old kingdom to the new

2543
02:02:47,241 --> 02:02:51,260
kingdom and that he points out that this
is most likely evidence of a different

2544
02:02:51,261 --> 02:02:53,810
era of construction and not.

2545
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:58,370
Not as not just a different era,
but different by 10,000 years maybe,

2546
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:03,700
and that the hieroglyphs on the inside
of some of the pyramids which dictate or

2547
02:03:03,981 --> 02:03:05,020
rather which,
um,

2548
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:10,130
um,
go over and depict the various pharaohs

2549
02:03:10,131 --> 02:03:12,080
throughout the different stages of
Egypt.

2550
02:03:12,310 --> 02:03:17,310
Think go back 30,000 years.
But what modern egyptologists choose to

2551
02:03:18,141 --> 02:03:19,160
do is to say,
well,

2552
02:03:19,161 --> 02:03:20,950
all those guys that was all fiction.
Yeah,

2553
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:23,810
like back when anything more than 6,000
years ago.

2554
02:03:23,811 --> 02:03:24,561
Just fiction.
Like,

2555
02:03:24,561 --> 02:03:26,390
okay,
so that's who bitch says,

2556
02:03:26,391 --> 02:03:28,040
oh,
you know,

2557
02:03:28,070 --> 02:03:32,480
how do you know like this is,
it's crazy enough that they did this

2558
02:03:32,690 --> 02:03:34,160
4,000,
500 years ago.

2559
02:03:34,250 --> 02:03:36,110
That's just crazy enough.
Okay.

2560
02:03:36,350 --> 02:03:39,920
But it's no more crazy to think that
they were doing it 30,000 years before

2561
02:03:39,921 --> 02:03:44,780
that.
Like this whole thing is this majestic

2562
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:48,990
sort of monument to human innovation in
a,

2563
02:03:48,991 --> 02:03:53,991
in a weird way that's not like what we
do now with cement and steel and glass

2564
02:03:56,421 --> 02:03:59,720
and asphalt roadways and fiber optic
cables.

2565
02:04:00,050 --> 02:04:03,350
No,
they had some other thing going on and I

2566
02:04:03,351 --> 02:04:05,480
think graham mixed up kind of a cool
point.

2567
02:04:05,481 --> 02:04:09,380
Like they were building something
specifically for permanence.

2568
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:10,520
Yeah.
Like why,

2569
02:04:10,550 --> 02:04:13,010
why did they want it to extend through
time?

2570
02:04:13,011 --> 02:04:14,480
Because all of our shit,
you know,

2571
02:04:14,481 --> 02:04:19,070
another ice age hits and you know,
that the ice moves in and starts

2572
02:04:19,071 --> 02:04:23,300
grinding everything and basically grind
most of what we have to dust anyways,

2573
02:04:23,301 --> 02:04:26,150
you know,
but they were creating these big stone

2574
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:28,820
blocks,
these things that were harder,

2575
02:04:28,821 --> 02:04:31,400
you know,
that would withstand the test of time

2576
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:32,840
and why.
And that's,

2577
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:35,840
that's kind of an interesting
speculative part of graham's theory,

2578
02:04:35,841 --> 02:04:37,680
but what seems concrete is that

2579
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:42,990
there was these cultures advanced and
decided to do it now why gets into the

2580
02:04:42,991 --> 02:04:47,991
speculation but go back tappy in gunung
padang and Indonesia and then Egypt and

2581
02:04:48,331 --> 02:04:51,690
all of these places really,
really super interesting and interesting

2582
02:04:51,691 --> 02:04:53,190
to imagine,
you know,

2583
02:04:53,191 --> 02:04:55,620
if,
if the flood did kill off most of that

2584
02:04:55,621 --> 02:04:59,670
civilization and they kinda just settled
in different places and the accounts.

2585
02:04:59,671 --> 02:05:03,690
Just one of the best books I think ever
written was that magicians and just

2586
02:05:03,691 --> 02:05:05,610
going into the mindset of,
you know,

2587
02:05:05,611 --> 02:05:09,360
he talks about they call these people
watchers and then some of the watchers

2588
02:05:09,740 --> 02:05:12,510
when I would get a bad reputation
because they like sleeping with local

2589
02:05:12,511 --> 02:05:16,030
girls and so they would be like the bad
watchers than the good watch.

2590
02:05:16,070 --> 02:05:17,820
Well maybe they were just.
The pimps have their time,

2591
02:05:17,821 --> 02:05:18,490
you know,
they,

2592
02:05:18,490 --> 02:05:20,700
they were eating more proteins that are
a little bigger,

2593
02:05:20,770 --> 02:05:23,040
you know,
they have their little smarter as of

2594
02:05:23,041 --> 02:05:24,390
course the girls liked them,
you know,

2595
02:05:24,391 --> 02:05:26,410
like why you got to hate on the watches.

2596
02:05:27,150 --> 02:05:28,740
Well,
when they burned the library of

2597
02:05:28,741 --> 02:05:29,850
alexandria,
man,

2598
02:05:29,851 --> 02:05:34,290
did they do the human race a massive
disservice we could have learned so much

2599
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:38,910
could learn so much about why the
ancient greeks would go to Egypt to

2600
02:05:38,911 --> 02:05:41,490
learn shit and to engage in psychedelic
rituals.

2601
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:46,770
It's funny that the greatest minds of
their time would go specifically to

2602
02:05:46,771 --> 02:05:50,970
Egypt to engage in these psychedelic
rituals and to learn from the egyptians.

2603
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:55,110
The greatest minds of our time today
will mock psychedelics.

2604
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:56,790
It's kinda,
it's kinda fascinating.

2605
02:05:56,840 --> 02:06:01,840
There's so few in terms of like
mainstream recognized scholars will even

2606
02:06:02,161 --> 02:06:06,720
entertain the possibility that there
could be some beneficial aspects to

2607
02:06:06,721 --> 02:06:10,230
engaging in ritualistic hallucinogenics
well,

2608
02:06:10,231 --> 02:06:13,530
all of academia is about defending to
the death,

2609
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:17,760
your own structure of information and
psychedelics are inherently disruptive

2610
02:06:17,761 --> 02:06:20,000
and I think people have that knowledge.
They know like,

2611
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,830
shit,
I may totally rethink all my whole

2612
02:06:22,831 --> 02:06:26,780
theories and you have to confront those
demons that you're hiding that that

2613
02:06:26,790 --> 02:06:30,870
which is hidden will come to the surface
and that's generally the beauty of this

2614
02:06:30,871 --> 02:06:33,480
process,
but if you're defending something,

2615
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:36,840
you know and you're attached to it and
it's part of your identity and because

2616
02:06:36,841 --> 02:06:38,790
it's part of your identity,
it feels real.

2617
02:06:38,910 --> 02:06:40,560
Like that's the trick that the ego
plays.

2618
02:06:40,590 --> 02:06:44,160
Ego says,
my identity is me and I will defend it

2619
02:06:44,161 --> 02:06:46,860
as if it was my flesh and blood.
You know,

2620
02:06:46,861 --> 02:06:48,600
like all of these things,
my theories,

2621
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:52,200
my position in academia,
it becomes real to the ego and so it

2622
02:06:52,201 --> 02:06:56,070
fights as if it's defending your own
blood and bone body,

2623
02:06:56,071 --> 02:06:57,330
but it's not.
It's just,

2624
02:06:57,570 --> 02:06:59,250
it's bullshit.
It's your identity.

2625
02:06:59,251 --> 02:07:01,290
It doesn't matter shift,
it's fluid.

2626
02:07:01,291 --> 02:07:02,110
It's,
it's,

2627
02:07:02,110 --> 02:07:04,770
it's a manufacturing of that,
of,

2628
02:07:04,830 --> 02:07:06,240
of that ego,
that attachment,

2629
02:07:06,241 --> 02:07:10,650
and so psychedelics are threat to that.
If you've been defending something that

2630
02:07:10,651 --> 02:07:14,160
you don't want to get challenged,
it could threaten your position of

2631
02:07:14,161 --> 02:07:16,900
authority and power and people are
afraid to do it.

2632
02:07:17,070 --> 02:07:21,690
There's no real other reason to have
that fear widespread.

2633
02:07:21,691 --> 02:07:23,640
Yeah.
There's a time and a place and it's not

2634
02:07:23,641 --> 02:07:26,970
for everybody,
etc. But you know really it's such a

2635
02:07:26,971 --> 02:07:31,260
powerful tool to access truth and you
can't be afraid of truth.

2636
02:07:31,261 --> 02:07:33,270
It's just a silly positioned to be.
Yeah.

2637
02:07:33,271 --> 02:07:36,020
There's a really interesting documentary
that's a

2638
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:40,450
funny enough,
a narrated by charlton heston about the

2639
02:07:40,451 --> 02:07:43,420
mystery of the sphinx.
I think it was on nbc at the time,

2640
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:48,130
but one of the weirder moments in it
where was when robert schoch,

2641
02:07:48,131 --> 02:07:52,240
the geologist from boston university and
John Anthony West presented this

2642
02:07:52,241 --> 02:07:57,241
evidence that the sphinx most likely was
far older than 2,500 bc because of the

2643
02:07:58,361 --> 02:08:02,530
erosion in the sphinx compound that
could only be attributed to water.

2644
02:08:02,770 --> 02:08:06,790
I've heard arguments against it.
I'm against it being water and it being

2645
02:08:06,791 --> 02:08:08,160
wind and sand,
but they just,

2646
02:08:08,210 --> 02:08:09,910
they don't fly.
It seems like they're.

2647
02:08:10,060 --> 02:08:14,410
They're working to try to make that a
wind and sand erosion.

2648
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:18,100
Whereas it's pretty obvious the fishers,
the way it's cut into the.

2649
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:20,770
I mean it makes total sense that it was
water,

2650
02:08:21,070 --> 02:08:25,960
but the only thing that could make it
water would be that it had to be before

2651
02:08:25,961 --> 02:08:30,961
9,000 bc because 9,000 or 7,000 bc,
9,000 years ago,

2652
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:36,440
one of those somewhere a lot longer than
2,500 bc and the argument when it was

2653
02:08:37,811 --> 02:08:40,540
presented to this archeologist,
he was laughing,

2654
02:08:40,830 --> 02:08:41,411
mom,
well,

2655
02:08:41,411 --> 02:08:44,110
what culture was around 10,000 years
ago,

2656
02:08:44,111 --> 02:08:44,890
they could have done this.

2657
02:08:44,890 --> 02:08:48,400
What culture.
Meanwhile now we have those cultures.

2658
02:08:48,401 --> 02:08:51,970
Now we have real evidence of go beckley
tappy,

2659
02:08:51,971 --> 02:08:55,810
which is 12,000 years old.
We have real evidence of all sorts of

2660
02:08:55,811 --> 02:08:59,950
weird shit that they didn't know me and
then now they're finding evidence of

2661
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:04,300
human beings in north America.
Fourteen thousand years ago,

2662
02:09:04,540 --> 02:09:09,540
they're finding a woolly mammoth bones
with a clear indications that they were

2663
02:09:09,581 --> 02:09:13,540
slaughtered by human beings like cuts on
the bones and then like,

2664
02:09:13,541 --> 02:09:16,480
oh jesus,
like people we don't know.

2665
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:20,080
We just don't know.
We don't know what the fuck happened

2666
02:09:20,081 --> 02:09:25,081
between 10,000 years ago when the ice
age ended and today there's just so much

2667
02:09:25,781 --> 02:09:29,110
weirdness and we definitely don't know
what the fuck happened before that.

2668
02:09:29,590 --> 02:09:33,160
Before that there is a lot of unfilled
pieces in that puzzle.

2669
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:35,420
Yeah.
It's,

2670
02:09:35,420 --> 02:09:38,470
it's like it's really as the greatest
mystery of all,

2671
02:09:38,530 --> 02:09:40,870
you know,
like the greatest mystery novel that

2672
02:09:40,871 --> 02:09:45,871
I've ever read was graham hancock's book
uncovering something that was real and

2673
02:09:45,910 --> 02:09:49,480
trying to piece together the puzzle and
in 20 years from fingerprints to

2674
02:09:49,481 --> 02:09:51,640
magicians,
all the new evidence that have come

2675
02:09:52,150 --> 02:09:56,050
really supported his initial evidence,
which was pretty good and fingerprints.

2676
02:09:56,050 --> 02:09:58,830
But then by magicians it's fucking
whelming.

2677
02:09:59,180 --> 02:10:01,570
You know,
he was just so openly mocked by a lot of

2678
02:10:01,571 --> 02:10:05,320
people that didn't want him to be right
or didn't want anyone to achieve any

2679
02:10:05,321 --> 02:10:09,280
sort of notoriety by having some sort of
an innovative idea.

2680
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:10,450
I mean,
they just,

2681
02:10:10,450 --> 02:10:12,400
they,
they pushed back on him so hard,

2682
02:10:12,850 --> 02:10:15,430
but the stuff that randall carlson
presents,

2683
02:10:15,820 --> 02:10:20,820
like these various cradle craters that
they've uncovered all throughout the

2684
02:10:21,761 --> 02:10:26,761
world that indicate asteroidal impacts
as recently as 5,000 years ago and deep

2685
02:10:27,071 --> 02:10:29,410
into 12,000,
10,000 the,

2686
02:10:30,430 --> 02:10:33,920
the nuclear glass they found all
throughout and europe

2687
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:38,890
that indicates massive meteor impacts
somewhere in the neighborhood of 11,

2688
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:40,340
12,000 years ago.
Yeah,

2689
02:10:40,580 --> 02:10:45,040
I mean it's all.
It all makes sense at all for files or

2690
02:10:45,050 --> 02:10:46,460
fills in like,
well,

2691
02:10:46,461 --> 02:10:47,151
what could have said,
oh,

2692
02:10:47,151 --> 02:10:48,140
well that caused it.
Oh,

2693
02:10:48,141 --> 02:10:51,440
that fucked a lot of shit up for sure.
I mean if you look at that nuclear

2694
02:10:51,441 --> 02:10:53,840
glass,
that's the same kind of shit that they

2695
02:10:53,841 --> 02:10:58,310
find when they do nuclear tests and they
find it all throughout europe,

2696
02:10:58,340 --> 02:11:01,580
all throughout asia,
which indicates that they literally got

2697
02:11:01,700 --> 02:11:02,840
bombed on by the.

2698
02:11:03,380 --> 02:11:05,160
Yeah,
the circumstantial evidence.

2699
02:11:05,161 --> 02:11:07,920
It's just mounting and mounting and it's
interesting.

2700
02:11:07,921 --> 02:11:09,720
You know,
we hear about these things that are like

2701
02:11:09,721 --> 02:11:13,890
myths and one of the ones that I saw
that I'm not sure if it's true or not,

2702
02:11:13,891 --> 02:11:17,490
but it's an interesting take on what
actually happened to the cities of sodom

2703
02:11:17,491 --> 02:11:19,310
and gomorrah because in the bible,
you know,

2704
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:21,280
god rained fire upon,
it,

2705
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:25,620
turned all these homosexuals and
sodomists and people that sounded like

2706
02:11:25,621 --> 02:11:28,000
they're having a great party and you
know,

2707
02:11:28,170 --> 02:11:32,710
what they were suggesting is that it was
a media that burned up in the,

2708
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:34,620
in the atmosphere,
and it raised,

2709
02:11:34,621 --> 02:11:37,770
it created this flashpoint effect,
which they know can happen and created

2710
02:11:37,771 --> 02:11:42,690
this flashpoint effect where instantly
the ground temperature reached several

2711
02:11:42,690 --> 02:11:45,720
hundred or thousand degrees or whatever.
So it was like this instant,

2712
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:48,510
everybody's just fucking crispy,
you know?

2713
02:11:49,050 --> 02:11:53,430
And how do you explain that other than
an angry god doesn't make sense,

2714
02:11:53,431 --> 02:11:54,390
you know,
you have no idea.

2715
02:11:54,391 --> 02:11:57,330
So these stories and myths get passed
down and they're like,

2716
02:11:57,331 --> 02:11:58,470
well,
why did that happen?

2717
02:11:58,800 --> 02:11:59,790
Well,
I don't know man.

2718
02:11:59,791 --> 02:12:01,830
I went to sodom and there's some crazy
shit going on.

2719
02:12:01,930 --> 02:12:05,910
But fucking so after the fact,
you make up these stories.

2720
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:07,290
Man,
I've of course,

2721
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:08,490
yeah,
that's why it happened.

2722
02:12:08,550 --> 02:12:10,690
It was just an unlucky party town.
What was.

2723
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:13,470
It was hard to do.
I mean that was,

2724
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:15,780
that was hard to explain.
Then.

2725
02:12:15,900 --> 02:12:18,180
So people went to that,
but today,

2726
02:12:18,330 --> 02:12:22,680
I mean this guy in orlando,
obviously he's fucking crazy,

2727
02:12:22,681 --> 02:12:25,920
right?
But he's killing gay people because he

2728
02:12:25,921 --> 02:12:29,250
thinks the gay people are doing
something against god's will.

2729
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:34,280
They're doing something bad and evil.
So like in his mind like his wrath is

2730
02:12:35,011 --> 02:12:40,011
like the wrath of god on these people
with in 2016 with the information that

2731
02:12:41,761 --> 02:12:44,160
we have with all the evidence that we
have,

2732
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:48,630
there are still people that are inclined
to go towards some sort of a,

2733
02:12:49,010 --> 02:12:53,660
of a biblical or in his case,
the koran version of,

2734
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:56,700
of the reality in which we live in like
this.

2735
02:12:57,210 --> 02:13:01,320
This is today when you're talking about
7,000,

2736
02:13:01,321 --> 02:13:04,490
8,000 years ago,
I got only knows what it would've been.

2737
02:13:04,550 --> 02:13:06,480
It was probably straight out of game of
thrones,

2738
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:09,690
like the reaction that people had to any
sort of a natural disaster.

2739
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:13,260
It had to be the will of the gods.
It had to definitely be something that

2740
02:13:13,770 --> 02:13:18,770
our own actions had caused and so when
someone would stand up,

2741
02:13:19,110 --> 02:13:23,370
like I'm the old dirty dude on game of
thrones was once everybody to repent.

2742
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:25,850
High sector high sparrow.
Yeah.

2743
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:31,250
That when that type of person would
stand up and tell the people of this is

2744
02:13:31,591 --> 02:13:32,070
because you have

2745
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:35,760
angered god and it will come again.
If you keep doing that and god forbid,

2746
02:13:36,270 --> 02:13:38,520
god forbid,
strange use of words,

2747
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:41,310
but another meteor shower.
I mean meteor showers.

2748
02:13:41,311 --> 02:13:44,970
Oftentimes they come like one after
another after another and then he says

2749
02:13:44,971 --> 02:13:46,860
this and then it happens again.
He's right.

2750
02:13:46,861 --> 02:13:49,540
I told you god is angry,
you know,

2751
02:13:49,590 --> 02:13:53,330
and then that gets passed on projections
and it is.

2752
02:13:53,380 --> 02:13:57,990
This is a really strange time and what I
found interesting is I think that

2753
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:03,080
christianity will never go away and our
cath catholicism and these major

2754
02:14:03,331 --> 02:14:05,070
religions,
but they will evolve.

2755
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:07,010
Like if you look at the trend,
you know,

2756
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:10,560
back in the middle ages,
they were doing crazy thing torturing

2757
02:14:10,561 --> 02:14:12,360
people.
I went to a dungeon in the inquisition.

2758
02:14:12,361 --> 02:14:15,920
All of this crazy shit that was in Italy
who were going,

2759
02:14:15,990 --> 02:14:18,630
I'm going to Italy this summer.
It was fucking horrifying.

2760
02:14:18,631 --> 02:14:20,280
It was in one of the mountain towns.

2761
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:24,360
I don't know exactly when,
but there's several of them there and

2762
02:14:24,361 --> 02:14:26,370
all the different torture devices that
they have.

2763
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:28,830
So many of which by the way,
involve the genitals.

2764
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:31,250
Like I would say at least 40 percent
involved,

2765
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:34,140
different things,
different ways towards falls and dick

2766
02:14:34,141 --> 02:14:37,370
and pussy and tits and all this.
I mean,

2767
02:14:37,371 --> 02:14:42,210
it's just these ways that they could
channel their own perversions into this

2768
02:14:42,390 --> 02:14:45,370
unarguable point about,
you know,

2769
02:14:45,450 --> 02:14:47,310
this is god,
this is what god wants,

2770
02:14:47,311 --> 02:14:52,311
but they're really just pure status.
Accessing that sadistic demonic energy

2771
02:14:52,650 --> 02:14:54,990
and,
and doing it under god's name.

2772
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:56,700
You know,
and that's what happens when you create

2773
02:14:56,701 --> 02:15:00,330
these systems that only a select few can
access the knowledge.

2774
02:15:00,331 --> 02:15:01,620
You know,
nobody else can talk to god,

2775
02:15:01,621 --> 02:15:04,370
these few people that did it and we're
talking and we're the descendants of

2776
02:15:04,371 --> 02:15:05,970
those people.
We guard the knowledge.

2777
02:15:05,971 --> 02:15:06,804
You can't reach it.

2778
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:09,750
So it creates,
instead of decentralizing in it and

2779
02:15:09,751 --> 02:15:12,870
opening up truth to everybody,
it's a select few that have it.

2780
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:15,750
Only a few people know god's will,
not everybody can find it.

2781
02:15:15,990 --> 02:15:18,710
And that's creates these massive power
and balances.

2782
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:22,590
Whereas any good religion is going to
completely decentralized and say,

2783
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:24,600
you know,
not listened to me.

2784
02:15:24,601 --> 02:15:27,990
I'll tell you what god says is,
here's how you go talk to god yourself.

2785
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:31,410
Here's how you reliably go find your own
deepest truth.

2786
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:34,350
You don't need me.
And it's the same with any good teacher,

2787
02:15:34,351 --> 02:15:36,060
any good healer,
you know,

2788
02:15:36,061 --> 02:15:38,340
like the very base level is,
uh,

2789
02:15:38,341 --> 02:15:40,980
is a teacher healer who,
who fixes,

2790
02:15:40,981 --> 02:15:42,810
you know,
you come to him and he fixes,

2791
02:15:42,811 --> 02:15:45,030
you know,
and then the next level is someone who

2792
02:15:45,031 --> 02:15:47,340
teaches you how to fix yourself.
Like that's the,

2793
02:15:47,490 --> 02:15:49,530
that's a master,
but give a man a fish.

2794
02:15:49,590 --> 02:15:50,251
Yeah,
exactly.

2795
02:15:50,251 --> 02:15:51,084
You can.
Yeah.

2796
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:54,870
And then the final level is just to
really the great mystics.

2797
02:15:54,900 --> 02:15:58,170
And even if you go back to jesus and you
go back to the really great mystics,

2798
02:15:58,171 --> 02:16:00,270
their message truly is that,
you know,

2799
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:03,600
you don't need us to fix it.
You're already whole like just recognize

2800
02:16:03,601 --> 02:16:05,520
that you're already whole.
You're already perfect,

2801
02:16:05,910 --> 02:16:08,370
you know you are.
You are the son of man.

2802
02:16:08,371 --> 02:16:11,040
You are god.
I mean that was really the core message

2803
02:16:11,310 --> 02:16:15,540
that's got twisted in a million
different ways and manipulated for

2804
02:16:15,541 --> 02:16:18,210
power.
Those was one of the other more

2805
02:16:18,211 --> 02:16:23,211
interesting podcasts from dan carlin was
on martin luther and lutheranism

2806
02:16:24,180 --> 02:16:25,260
lutheran,
lutheran,

2807
02:16:25,350 --> 02:16:27,990
lutheran,
this discipline and that he was the

2808
02:16:27,991 --> 02:16:30,580
first one to translate

2809
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:36,000
the bible from latin into german and
translate it in the phonetic way that

2810
02:16:36,821 --> 02:16:40,090
the people could actually understand
what the word of god was and not have to

2811
02:16:40,091 --> 02:16:44,320
be a priest because they were relying
upon these priests and not only that,

2812
02:16:44,321 --> 02:16:49,321
he was also the first one to say that
your interpretation of what god meant is

2813
02:16:50,381 --> 02:16:54,700
essentially up to you,
which was just a blast for me to these

2814
02:16:54,701 --> 02:16:57,160
people that had massive amounts of
control.

2815
02:16:57,490 --> 02:17:00,880
I think if you're looking for that one,
I think it's called the prophets of doom

2816
02:17:01,030 --> 02:17:04,610
or the prophet of doom.
I think that's the name of the podcast

2817
02:17:05,030 --> 02:17:10,030
from carlin on on that insane time,
but it's amazing.

2818
02:17:11,050 --> 02:17:12,690
Amazing to think that,
you know,

2819
02:17:12,850 --> 02:17:14,860
in that sense you're talking about like
what was it,

2820
02:17:14,861 --> 02:17:19,450
the $1,400 or something like that there.
That's not that long ago at all.

2821
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:23,050
That's nothing and people couldn't read
the bible.

2822
02:17:23,250 --> 02:17:26,170
I mean think about that.
They were relying upon these.

2823
02:17:26,510 --> 02:17:28,390
I mean they weren't even pedophiles back
then.

2824
02:17:28,391 --> 02:17:30,460
They were allowed to fuck,
which is really interesting.

2825
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,890
Like that pedophile thing.
They.

2826
02:17:33,180 --> 02:17:36,670
That only happened once.
They wouldn't let the priest fuck and

2827
02:17:36,671 --> 02:17:39,040
they wouldn't let the priest because the
priests were fucking too many people

2828
02:17:39,041 --> 02:17:42,610
because the priests were the rock stars.
The priests were the celebrities totally

2829
02:17:43,630 --> 02:17:45,210
to power.
They're terrible.

2830
02:17:45,211 --> 02:17:46,620
Always create,
get you pussy.

2831
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:49,210
They were getting mad pussy so someone
came along and said,

2832
02:17:49,211 --> 02:17:50,890
all right,
you fuckers no sex.

2833
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:54,700
They just made that up along the way.
I mean,

2834
02:17:54,730 --> 02:17:58,570
it wasn't even like it came from god and
it's like it came a lot with.

2835
02:17:58,571 --> 02:18:00,610
They had already established one way of
behavior.

2836
02:18:00,611 --> 02:18:03,130
Like even the pope pope's used to have
wives.

2837
02:18:03,310 --> 02:18:08,310
They had armies like pope's weren't like
this weird fiba old guy who sits on a

2838
02:18:08,771 --> 02:18:11,560
golden throne and it has little gay
people do.

2839
02:18:11,561 --> 02:18:14,230
Cirque du solei dances in front of him
like that last asshole,

2840
02:18:15,370 --> 02:18:20,370
but not the most recent pope is like
kind of humble pope is humble hope the

2841
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:21,700
cool pope.
Yeah,

2842
02:18:21,701 --> 02:18:22,390
but it's,
it's,

2843
02:18:22,390 --> 02:18:25,510
it's,
it's evolved and changed throughout the

2844
02:18:25,510 --> 02:18:26,343
year,
but just,

2845
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:29,530
you know,
600 years ago or whatever it was you,

2846
02:18:29,531 --> 02:18:32,410
or 500 years ago,
you couldn't even fucking read that

2847
02:18:32,411 --> 02:18:32,870
shit.

2848
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:34,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

2849
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:36,490
Again,
it's the control of power,

2850
02:18:36,560 --> 02:18:39,760
the control of information rather than a
shamonic way,

2851
02:18:39,761 --> 02:18:43,850
which is always show you not tell you.
You go to a two,

2852
02:18:43,930 --> 02:18:47,740
then that's another great way if you're
trying to find out who you should go

2853
02:18:47,741 --> 02:18:49,480
with,
like if someone's busy,

2854
02:18:49,481 --> 02:18:52,810
blabbing their mouth and trying to tell
you all of the things that you'll see

2855
02:18:52,811 --> 02:18:54,850
from an iowaska journey or something
like that,

2856
02:18:55,180 --> 02:18:57,310
tell you all the lessons and give them
to you that way.

2857
02:18:57,440 --> 02:18:59,040
If I can go the other way,
you know,

2858
02:18:59,050 --> 02:19:00,880
like the true,
the true path is,

2859
02:19:01,210 --> 02:19:02,410
you know,
here you go.

2860
02:19:02,411 --> 02:19:04,960
I'm going to create the environment and
you're going to go find truth for

2861
02:19:04,961 --> 02:19:06,910
yourself.
You're going to find whatever the truth

2862
02:19:06,911 --> 02:19:10,270
that is and they have faith that you'll
arrive at the truth that's going to be

2863
02:19:10,271 --> 02:19:12,880
most beneficial for you and most often
than not,

2864
02:19:12,881 --> 02:19:16,750
it comes back congruence with those
ideas and that's that's the true path.

2865
02:19:16,751 --> 02:19:18,520
That's the path that any religion should
take,

2866
02:19:18,521 --> 02:19:21,850
and I think one of the reasons why
buddhism is so popular because it's

2867
02:19:22,120 --> 02:19:25,920
similar in that way.
It teaches a practice or zen teaches a

2868
02:19:25,930 --> 02:19:30,260
practice that allows single person to
access that higher state of

2869
02:19:30,261 --> 02:19:32,390
consciousness.
Everybody can reach nirvana.

2870
02:19:32,391 --> 02:19:34,820
It's not just the chosen,
preselected,

2871
02:19:34,821 --> 02:19:37,670
this thing,
here's how you do it and go for it.

2872
02:19:37,671 --> 02:19:40,730
And I think any good,
any good spirituality system is going to

2873
02:19:40,731 --> 02:19:41,564
have that in common.

2874
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:45,020
Isn't it interesting though that that's
sort of the exception to the rule to

2875
02:19:45,021 --> 02:19:49,370
find a system or finding an individual
like a martin luther or like someone who

2876
02:19:49,371 --> 02:19:50,540
steps up and says,
no,

2877
02:19:50,990 --> 02:19:53,990
the whole world should benefit.
All the people should learn this.

2878
02:19:53,991 --> 02:19:56,390
Everyone should get.
It shouldn't be about centralized power,

2879
02:19:56,410 --> 02:19:57,920
shouldn't be about controlling the
people,

2880
02:19:58,160 --> 02:20:02,690
like that's a rare thing and that's
fought against like vehemently like it's

2881
02:20:02,810 --> 02:20:03,160
the,
the,

2882
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:07,520
the,
they passionately resist this and in

2883
02:20:07,521 --> 02:20:09,710
many ways it's like what we were talking
about before,

2884
02:20:09,711 --> 02:20:14,711
like it kinda takes almost negativity
and evil to bring out the best in people

2885
02:20:16,491 --> 02:20:18,530
in a response.
And it almost,

2886
02:20:18,650 --> 02:20:23,650
it sort of takes this horrible control,
this dictatorship of religion and

2887
02:20:25,551 --> 02:20:30,551
ideology to resist in such a powerful
way that you change everything around

2888
02:20:32,301 --> 02:20:34,090
you because of these people were just
sort of,

2889
02:20:34,170 --> 02:20:34,641
well,
you know,

2890
02:20:34,641 --> 02:20:35,600
this is the word of god,
you know,

2891
02:20:35,610 --> 02:20:36,230
and go with it.

2892
02:20:36,230 --> 02:20:37,430
Don't go with it.
Don't give a fuck.

2893
02:20:37,910 --> 02:20:39,170
Everything's cool.
You know,

2894
02:20:39,350 --> 02:20:40,280
oh,
you don't have to give me any of your

2895
02:20:40,281 --> 02:20:42,050
money and I'm not trying to fuck her at
anybody.

2896
02:20:42,051 --> 02:20:46,190
I'm just hanging out over here.
Would probably be no resistance to that

2897
02:20:46,191 --> 02:20:50,540
religion and there would be no sort of
rebound effect where people are trying

2898
02:20:50,541 --> 02:20:54,170
to find their own truth and
understanding that the negative

2899
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:59,920
attachments that they have to all these
religious cults or sex or whatever you

2900
02:21:01,791 --> 02:21:05,060
want to call them,
the negative attachments that we have

2901
02:21:05,061 --> 02:21:08,690
them are completely unnecessary.
Like they don't have to be there.

2902
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:12,350
That through what everyone's trying to
find through religion.

2903
02:21:12,351 --> 02:21:16,280
You're trying to find the word of god
trying to find ultimate love and wisdom

2904
02:21:16,281 --> 02:21:20,510
and power and this one individual who
has created literally the entire

2905
02:21:20,511 --> 02:21:22,940
universe or this force has created
literally.

2906
02:21:23,150 --> 02:21:26,510
So why is it this guy's trying to fuck
my wife and why is that?

2907
02:21:26,510 --> 02:21:29,600
I have to give everybody my goal that
how come I can't read the bible myself?

2908
02:21:29,601 --> 02:21:33,020
How do I have to trust this guy was
trying to fuck my wife and steal my

2909
02:21:33,021 --> 02:21:35,240
goats?
I have to trust that asshole.

2910
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:36,810
Fuck that man.
Yeah,

2911
02:21:36,980 --> 02:21:40,070
and so then as martin luther guy comes
along who actually can read it and

2912
02:21:40,071 --> 02:21:44,570
understand it and translates it and
there is a massive blow back and

2913
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:48,260
obviously just based in Thailand,
dan carlin's podcasts,

2914
02:21:48,261 --> 02:21:53,261
but apparently his influential position
in the community was the only thing that

2915
02:21:53,421 --> 02:21:57,760
kept him alive like anybody else doing
the exact same thing he was doing would

2916
02:21:57,761 --> 02:22:02,150
have been killed by the church.
The church would have killed people for

2917
02:22:02,151 --> 02:22:05,660
distributing the word of god in a way
that other people could understand and

2918
02:22:05,661 --> 02:22:08,930
it hadn't been done before.
Like people had questioned the church

2919
02:22:08,931 --> 02:22:11,360
before.
They just fucking strung them up and cut

2920
02:22:11,361 --> 02:22:14,570
the dick off and shoved it in their
mouth and lit them on fire and launched

2921
02:22:14,571 --> 02:22:17,360
them in a catapult.
They didn't give a fuck back then.

2922
02:22:17,870 --> 02:22:18,703
Barbaric.

2923
02:22:18,820 --> 02:22:19,960
Yeah.
And it's in the.

2924
02:22:19,990 --> 02:22:21,470
How does.
So how does that,

2925
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:24,560
how does,
how does a system like that take hold

2926
02:22:24,561 --> 02:22:26,900
and take fact and you know,
we,

2927
02:22:26,930 --> 02:22:30,750
you've talked about the kind of the
toxoplasma that alters behavior,

2928
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:36,140
this disease that will alter human
behavior or altered mice behavior and we

2929
02:22:36,181 --> 02:22:38,790
have that disease too and it's called
fear and it's,

2930
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:42,630
it is the primary disease that once fear
takes a hold of us,

2931
02:22:42,631 --> 02:22:45,390
once we fear that if,
if we do something wrong,

2932
02:22:45,391 --> 02:22:48,030
will be punished in the most obscene
ways,

2933
02:22:48,031 --> 02:22:49,980
you know,
look at like a bosch painting from,

2934
02:22:50,210 --> 02:22:54,000
from Italy during the time of all of
these inventions of how you were going

2935
02:22:54,001 --> 02:22:58,350
to be tortured if you went against the
will of god and you'll be punished not

2936
02:22:58,351 --> 02:23:02,370
only for a little while,
but eternally eternal torture and

2937
02:23:02,371 --> 02:23:05,040
suffering.
Like that's some kind of just punishment

2938
02:23:05,041 --> 02:23:05,874
for,
you know,

2939
02:23:05,880 --> 02:23:07,230
having lustful thoughts or whatever.

2940
02:23:07,230 --> 02:23:10,410
But that's what they believe.
So they inject people with this fear of

2941
02:23:10,411 --> 02:23:13,880
virus and then the fear virus robs them
of their own freewill,

2942
02:23:13,890 --> 02:23:18,150
robs them of their ability to think.
So it's like this form of virus that

2943
02:23:18,151 --> 02:23:20,850
takes a hold of somebody.
And then you allow these atrocities to

2944
02:23:20,851 --> 02:23:24,360
take hold because fear is within you,
and in other cases,

2945
02:23:24,361 --> 02:23:28,110
maybe it's the greed virus or some other
thing that takes hold,

2946
02:23:28,111 --> 02:23:32,070
but it's really like this thing that
really limits your ability to use

2947
02:23:32,071 --> 02:23:33,920
rational thought into,
you know,

2948
02:23:33,940 --> 02:23:37,590
to harness your own power of choice.
But fear is that original,

2949
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:40,030
original virus that the religions played
so,

2950
02:23:40,031 --> 02:23:41,240
so well,
you know,

2951
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:43,320
fear and guilt.
It's weird because it's such a

2952
02:23:43,321 --> 02:23:47,730
distortion of a really important aspect
of being alive.

2953
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:50,190
Like you have to have fear of
consequences.

2954
02:23:50,191 --> 02:23:54,000
You have to have fear of animals and you
have to fear of the ocean.

2955
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:57,330
You have to have you.
You have to have a healthy respect for

2956
02:23:57,331 --> 02:24:02,331
the consequences of stepping off of a
cliff or the consequences of walking

2957
02:24:02,371 --> 02:24:05,790
into a bear den with a mom and her cubs.
All those things are real.

2958
02:24:05,820 --> 02:24:08,370
You know?
And so you have to have fear.

2959
02:24:08,730 --> 02:24:12,210
But there's some fear that people have
that exists for no reason.

2960
02:24:12,450 --> 02:24:13,020
Well,
the,

2961
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:15,510
the idea that he's a good god fearing
man,

2962
02:24:15,540 --> 02:24:18,690
god,
god fearing god is fucking love.

2963
02:24:18,750 --> 02:24:23,220
It's like the most perfect form of love
and truth,

2964
02:24:23,320 --> 02:24:26,160
not when the skies on fire because
people are blood fucking

2965
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:29,130
right,
so yeah,

2966
02:24:29,131 --> 02:24:31,080
you see where this other perspective
comes from,

2967
02:24:31,081 --> 02:24:33,630
but you know to fear,
love.

2968
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:37,290
It's this trans.
It totally fucks the mind like it sets

2969
02:24:37,291 --> 02:24:39,810
the mind upside down.
Once the minds upside down,

2970
02:24:39,820 --> 02:24:41,490
it looks at everything all funny.
Yeah.

2971
02:24:41,550 --> 02:24:44,580
Nothing makes sense.
You've removed a cornerstone of logic.

2972
02:24:44,610 --> 02:24:47,230
Now you need to fear god.
Oh fuck,

2973
02:24:47,240 --> 02:24:49,710
fear god.
Well then everything else is just

2974
02:24:49,711 --> 02:24:53,310
twisted up and fucked up and you can't
even use your rational mind.

2975
02:24:53,311 --> 02:24:55,470
You can't find the way out because your
whole.

2976
02:24:55,770 --> 02:24:58,440
The whole paradigm has been turned on
its head and twisted.

2977
02:24:58,620 --> 02:25:00,390
Well,
isn't it an interesting in that respect

2978
02:25:00,391 --> 02:25:03,360
then that it seems that the more
knowledge we gathered,

2979
02:25:03,361 --> 02:25:08,040
more information we acquire,
the less we have to be fearful of,

2980
02:25:08,490 --> 02:25:09,990
the more we can say,
oh,

2981
02:25:09,991 --> 02:25:13,420
that's not an angry god,
that's a meteor a,

2982
02:25:13,590 --> 02:25:16,260
and then one day,
oh well we'll figure out how to deflect

2983
02:25:16,261 --> 02:25:18,720
those meteors.
We don't have to worry about the ice age

2984
02:25:18,721 --> 02:25:22,740
ending or,
or rather a dinosaur killing chunk of

2985
02:25:22,741 --> 02:25:24,130
iron and stone from

2986
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:27,850
the sky slamming into the ocean and
killing all of us because we see those

2987
02:25:27,851 --> 02:25:30,640
fuckers coming.
Now we just shoot a net at it and push

2988
02:25:30,641 --> 02:25:35,641
it off into jupiter or some shit mean.
This is all information that will slowly

2989
02:25:35,891 --> 02:25:40,891
but surely eliminate the need for fear
and I guess that's probably going to

2990
02:25:42,071 --> 02:25:47,071
extend to the consequences of injury and
death as well.

2991
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:49,580
I mean at one point in time they're
going,

2992
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:54,460
things keep going the way they're going.
I guarantee if they get to you within a

2993
02:25:54,461 --> 02:25:56,260
certain amount of time,
that probably going to be able to

2994
02:25:56,261 --> 02:25:57,130
reanimate.
Animate you.

2995
02:25:57,910 --> 02:25:59,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

2996
02:25:59,051 --> 02:26:01,900
I mean it will certainly remove
consequences eventually,

2997
02:26:01,901 --> 02:26:05,350
but there's so much we can do right now.
We surrender our power to use those

2998
02:26:05,351 --> 02:26:07,960
fears all the time.
How many times have you seen somebody

2999
02:26:07,961 --> 02:26:09,040
shriek,
you know,

3000
02:26:09,041 --> 02:26:11,380
because the fucking cockroach was around
in the room.

3001
02:26:11,650 --> 02:26:13,030
It's a cockroach.
They're clean,

3002
02:26:13,070 --> 02:26:15,850
they're cleaning up the garbage that's
on the floor.

3003
02:26:15,970 --> 02:26:20,320
They've never harmed anyone ever.
And that little thing is going to cause

3004
02:26:20,321 --> 02:26:24,280
you to scream and your heart to race and
like you can actually choose,

3005
02:26:24,281 --> 02:26:26,440
actively choose through,
you know,

3006
02:26:26,650 --> 02:26:30,580
exposure to that and working through
that to get over that fear like we have

3007
02:26:30,581 --> 02:26:35,050
these choices and I think you have to
collapse your fear into actual danger so

3008
02:26:35,051 --> 02:26:38,710
that fear and danger on the same level
and you can go too far where you can

3009
02:26:38,711 --> 02:26:41,710
remove too much fear so you're not
actually afraid of danger.

3010
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:44,500
And you know,
people do like grizzly man clearly did

3011
02:26:44,501 --> 02:26:45,310
that,
you know,

3012
02:26:45,310 --> 02:26:48,190
when he was hanging camping with the
grizzlies and should've had more fear

3013
02:26:48,191 --> 02:26:49,750
for those fuckers,
but he didn't.

3014
02:26:49,751 --> 02:26:51,190
By the way,
I'm getting werner herzog.

3015
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:52,400
Oh nice.
Yeah,

3016
02:26:52,540 --> 02:26:54,370
that's awesome.
That'd be really cool.

3017
02:26:54,480 --> 02:26:55,750
Is going to come on.
Beautiful.

3018
02:26:55,751 --> 02:26:57,940
I'm excited.
I don't give a fuck what he wants to

3019
02:26:57,941 --> 02:26:59,500
talk about.
We're talking about grizzly man

3020
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:05,180
cave of forgotten dreams.
That too.

3021
02:27:05,270 --> 02:27:07,420
I'll talk about that as well.
That was amazing.

3022
02:27:08,130 --> 02:27:10,690
I want to talk to them about that tom
cruise movie where he played a bad guy

3023
02:27:10,691 --> 02:27:13,900
as well.
Time of jack reacher,

3024
02:27:14,770 --> 02:27:17,170
but grizzly man.
I also think we're dealing with,

3025
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:19,960
if you have never seen that documentary
is one of my favorite unintentional

3026
02:27:19,961 --> 02:27:22,090
comedies,
you have to see it.

3027
02:27:22,120 --> 02:27:24,880
It's about a guy who decided he was
going to save the bears.

3028
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:28,600
The bears did not need fucking saving.
They didn't want saving.

3029
02:27:28,660 --> 02:27:31,450
They didn't need saving.
They weren't interested in his saving

3030
02:27:31,960 --> 02:27:34,600
and eventually the atum eventually they
determined he was.

3031
02:27:35,050 --> 02:27:37,570
Yeah,
they've figured out the assessment.

3032
02:27:37,630 --> 02:27:40,060
Yeah.
Harris part bears are so amazing,

3033
02:27:40,061 --> 02:27:43,990
man.
Bringing it back to our camp as we bring

3034
02:27:43,991 --> 02:27:44,824
this bitch home.

3035
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:46,690
When,
when we were up there,

3036
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:49,150
it was like,
I felt like,

3037
02:27:49,151 --> 02:27:50,500
um,
since you're,

3038
02:27:50,950 --> 02:27:54,850
since you've been practicing archery for
a couple of years now and you've been

3039
02:27:54,851 --> 02:27:57,250
really getting into it,
that would have been the perfect first

3040
02:27:57,251 --> 02:28:00,070
archery hunt because it's a controlled
environment.

3041
02:28:00,400 --> 02:28:01,233
It's,
um,

3042
02:28:01,990 --> 02:28:04,990
it's a,
a really high likelihood of success.

3043
02:28:04,991 --> 02:28:08,050
Even though we both struck out it's a
high likelihood of success.

3044
02:28:08,080 --> 02:28:09,700
And there's,
um,

3045
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:13,270
there's,
there's a crazy intimate connection that

3046
02:28:13,271 --> 02:28:18,271
you have with an animal when you're up
close with them within 20 plus yards and

3047
02:28:18,821 --> 02:28:22,580
you shoot it with a bow and arrow.
That is like some really

3048
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:26,150
old dna that you tap into that some like
there's a,

3049
02:28:26,890 --> 02:28:31,160
there's like a switch that goes off
where your tissue is like,

3050
02:28:31,220 --> 02:28:33,620
oh,
we've seen this before,

3051
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:36,770
this we did this 500 years ago.
Like there's,

3052
02:28:36,790 --> 02:28:41,790
there's genetics I think that are
attached to archery and some sort of

3053
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:43,670
strange way.
Apparently I have,

3054
02:28:43,970 --> 02:28:47,060
I'm not a traditional archer,
I haven't done that,

3055
02:28:47,300 --> 02:28:50,840
but they say it's even stronger in that
that shooting,

3056
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:55,900
even just shooting a regular bows like a
recurve bow has an even more sort of a

3057
02:28:57,411 --> 02:29:02,411
visceral connection to the human body
and the human mind and you know,

3058
02:29:04,270 --> 02:29:07,730
with ted nugent calls the spiritual
flight of the out of the mystical flight

3059
02:29:07,731 --> 02:29:12,560
of the arrow that there's some sort of a
weird ancient calling.

3060
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:14,390
And when you,
when you do that,

3061
02:29:14,391 --> 02:29:17,090
when you.
I wonder if a catapult to do that launch

3062
02:29:17,130 --> 02:29:18,770
catapult on a motherfucker like,
damn,

3063
02:29:18,771 --> 02:29:22,100
this feels good.
I think people progress that all the way

3064
02:29:22,101 --> 02:29:22,970
to the,
you know?

3065
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,650
Yeah.
But I think the catapult wasn't used for

3066
02:29:24,651 --> 02:29:25,910
hunting,
for use,

3067
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:30,860
for war cattle.
Jesus christ be a herd of elk.

3068
02:29:33,650 --> 02:29:37,190
Boom.
Then you go look for scraps.

3069
02:29:38,130 --> 02:29:40,920
Take you shoot a recurve all the time.
I shoot a recurve all the time.

3070
02:29:40,950 --> 02:29:44,190
I really enjoyed it.
Super way less accurate so I wouldn't go

3071
02:29:44,191 --> 02:29:47,490
hunting with it,
but it's really accurate with them.

3072
02:29:47,491 --> 02:29:48,241
No.
Yeah.

3073
02:29:48,241 --> 02:29:48,661
First,
yeah,

3074
02:29:48,661 --> 02:29:50,730
I guess.
I guess for me it's way less accurate.

3075
02:29:50,731 --> 02:29:53,580
I'm sure some people are really practice
and they get really good at it,

3076
02:29:53,581 --> 02:29:57,840
but there's so many weird things like
judging distance,

3077
02:29:58,200 --> 02:30:00,980
super weird site.
Well lisa,

3078
02:30:01,090 --> 02:30:02,890
yeah,
shoot instinctive so there's no site so

3079
02:30:02,910 --> 02:30:04,880
you're just feeling it.
But you read a book,

3080
02:30:05,050 --> 02:30:06,840
zen and the art of archery,
eugene arrows book,

3081
02:30:06,870 --> 02:30:11,760
great book and it.
It applies to regular compound bow,

3082
02:30:12,060 --> 02:30:14,400
but you really feel it when you have the
recurve and.

3083
02:30:14,401 --> 02:30:16,610
Yeah,
and just a piece of wood and sinewy

3084
02:30:17,150 --> 02:30:20,800
twisted and you're knocking the air and
you're just going off instinct cause

3085
02:30:20,801 --> 02:30:22,620
there's so much more variability.
It's less,

3086
02:30:22,970 --> 02:30:24,080
it's less,
you know,

3087
02:30:24,630 --> 02:30:28,080
mechanic.
It feels like you're just more of like a

3088
02:30:28,081 --> 02:30:31,160
flow type of thing and it's fun.
It's fun to fun to do that.

3089
02:30:31,290 --> 02:30:33,140
I always imagined that.
It's like,

3090
02:30:33,141 --> 02:30:33,300
yeah,
like

3091
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:38,300
a lot like playing pool in that you
develop a feel for where it's gonna go.

3092
02:30:39,850 --> 02:30:41,310
Yep,
and you have to do it.

3093
02:30:41,311 --> 02:30:45,510
So they say that it's one of the most
important things about traditional

3094
02:30:45,511 --> 02:30:47,640
archery,
instinctive shooting is that you have to

3095
02:30:47,641 --> 02:30:51,900
shoot hours every day to be really,
really accurate,

3096
02:30:52,350 --> 02:30:54,420
but like if you watch like olympic
recurve shooters,

3097
02:30:54,690 --> 02:30:56,400
they have a lot of weird shit going on,
man.

3098
02:30:56,401 --> 02:31:01,401
They have like a clicker so they'll pull
the arrow back a certain distance and it

3099
02:31:01,741 --> 02:31:06,741
click will go off because you could have
the go all the way to when I'm making a

3100
02:31:07,261 --> 02:31:11,700
motion like you could pull it back to
your chin or you could pull it past your

3101
02:31:11,701 --> 02:31:14,790
chin and it gets not like a compound bow
or it hits a wall.

3102
02:31:15,090 --> 02:31:20,010
Compound bows extremely accurate and
guys like john who was a

3103
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:25,010
guy who have set up my bow and he.
He wrote the curriculum for the world

3104
02:31:25,291 --> 02:31:27,180
archery federation,
whatever the fuck it is,

3105
02:31:27,181 --> 02:31:32,100
and travels all over the world to teach
people proper technique and teach people

3106
02:31:32,101 --> 02:31:35,100
and coach international teams and
archery.

3107
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:40,640
He was saying that if you get like a
rifle shooter and they shoot like

3108
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:44,970
freehand,
not resting in something to 100 yards,

3109
02:31:44,971 --> 02:31:49,950
that archers are actually regularly more
accurate at a hundred yards with a bow

3110
02:31:49,951 --> 02:31:53,340
and arrow than someone holding a rifle
as well.

3111
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:55,320
Yeah,
that's really wild.

3112
02:31:55,321 --> 02:31:57,770
It's crazy.
Yeah.

3113
02:31:57,771 --> 02:32:00,600
I mean with the,
with the traditional shooting though,

3114
02:32:01,080 --> 02:32:04,340
compound bow shooting your.
If you've got a 70 pound bow it's going

3115
02:32:04,341 --> 02:32:06,210
to shoot 70 always.
Yes.

3116
02:32:06,211 --> 02:32:07,410
So that's,
that's a variable.

3117
02:32:07,411 --> 02:32:11,820
You don't have to factor any kind of
recurve bow can shoot 20 pounds if you

3118
02:32:11,821 --> 02:32:14,610
just pull it back a little bit to
fucking 65,

3119
02:32:14,611 --> 02:32:15,090
whatever.

3120
02:32:15,090 --> 02:32:17,790
Depending on how much you can actually
bend the limbs of that.

3121
02:32:17,820 --> 02:32:18,930
Yeah.
And go.

3122
02:32:18,931 --> 02:32:22,020
So the up and down variability,
I mean side to side,

3123
02:32:22,021 --> 02:32:23,820
you should get pretty accurate,
you know,

3124
02:32:23,821 --> 02:32:25,770
just by anchoring and kind of lining
that up.

3125
02:32:25,771 --> 02:32:29,760
But the up and down really depends on
how far you pull and your breath and

3126
02:32:29,761 --> 02:32:32,690
your release is not all.
Your release gets super squirrely too

3127
02:32:32,700 --> 02:32:35,430
because its fingers don't have a little
release thing.

3128
02:32:35,431 --> 02:32:40,110
So you hold on a little tight or you
don't let the string flow through your

3129
02:32:40,111 --> 02:32:41,310
fingers the right way.
It's just

3130
02:32:42,830 --> 02:32:45,060
shoots off all squarely.
Yeah.

3131
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:47,460
So that's why the olympic recurve
people,

3132
02:32:47,461 --> 02:32:50,940
they have like clicker.
So they pull their arrow back and once

3133
02:32:50,941 --> 02:32:54,030
it gets to a certain length it sets off
a little click.

3134
02:32:54,480 --> 02:32:58,320
So it's like click and then they
released the arrow so they know when to

3135
02:32:58,321 --> 02:32:58,920
release it.

3136
02:32:58,920 --> 02:33:02,070
They know when they've pulled it back
far enough to get that click.

3137
02:33:02,071 --> 02:33:03,060
Yeah.
It doesn't make sense.

3138
02:33:03,061 --> 02:33:05,250
But you know,
it's uh,

3139
02:33:06,090 --> 02:33:08,610
I,
I gotta think you'll lose a little some

3140
02:33:08,611 --> 02:33:09,870
of that.
Yeah,

3141
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:12,380
magic.
You're starting to move at all,

3142
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:15,180
all the way towards the compound,
but at a certain point might as well

3143
02:33:15,181 --> 02:33:17,450
just shoot the compound if you take all
of the,

3144
02:33:17,640 --> 02:33:19,590
the feel of that thing out.
Yeah,

3145
02:33:19,591 --> 02:33:21,150
I wouldn't.
If you look at a compound bow,

3146
02:33:21,570 --> 02:33:24,630
if you look at someone who's shooting a
compound bow like people,

3147
02:33:24,631 --> 02:33:27,450
I put a picture of me up,
uh,

3148
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:30,180
from our camp that ben took when we were
there.

3149
02:33:30,390 --> 02:33:32,400
And one of the things that people have
commented on,

3150
02:33:32,401 --> 02:33:37,290
like look at that fucking weird thing,
like always pulleys and cables and all

3151
02:33:37,291 --> 02:33:40,530
these things hanging off of it and the
site and the stabilizer.

3152
02:33:40,531 --> 02:33:41,880
There's so much going on.

3153
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:45,420
In your case,
it's to the max as much shit going on on

3154
02:33:45,421 --> 02:33:47,670
any boat is ever,
ever been on a boat.

3155
02:33:47,760 --> 02:33:48,840
Yeah.
I tried everything.

3156
02:33:48,870 --> 02:33:51,750
I tried everything.
I mean I've whittled it down,

3157
02:33:51,810 --> 02:33:53,970
have added things and taking things
down.

3158
02:33:53,971 --> 02:33:54,810
But oh,
there it is.

3159
02:33:54,840 --> 02:33:55,920
There's the photo.
Yeah.

3160
02:33:55,950 --> 02:33:57,500
Yeah.
There's a lot going on and I fucking

3161
02:33:58,350 --> 02:34:02,660
that thing.
But all those cables and pulleys and you

3162
02:34:02,661 --> 02:34:06,030
know,
the stabilizer and the adjustable site

3163
02:34:06,031 --> 02:34:08,520
that goes up and down depending on
distance,

3164
02:34:08,521 --> 02:34:10,890
but it's so fucking accurate.
Yeah.

3165
02:34:11,850 --> 02:34:13,110
But so fun too,
man.

3166
02:34:13,500 --> 02:34:18,310
It's like there's very few things I
enjoy as far as clearing my mind as much

3167
02:34:18,311 --> 02:34:19,880
as just shooting at a target.
Yeah.

3168
02:34:20,770 --> 02:34:24,370
Well it demands president.
This demands that you're in the moment

3169
02:34:24,371 --> 02:34:26,690
you're thinking about other shit,
you know,

3170
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:28,960
because everything is so finite.
Same with pool.

3171
02:34:28,961 --> 02:34:33,961
I think gravitate naturally to these
activities that to be good demands full

3172
02:34:34,211 --> 02:34:36,730
attention and inattention is bliss.

3173
02:34:36,730 --> 02:34:39,130
Is happiness in intention because that's
the present moment.

3174
02:34:39,160 --> 02:34:42,850
You will.
It definitely removes all of the outside

3175
02:34:42,851 --> 02:34:46,990
distractions that really aren't.
They're not important right now.

3176
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:49,720
Like right now,
you're breathing.

3177
02:34:49,810 --> 02:34:52,420
You have food in your belly,
you're alive,

3178
02:34:52,510 --> 02:34:55,030
you're healthy.
What is important?

3179
02:34:55,150 --> 02:34:56,530
Well,
you have a bone in your hand.

3180
02:34:56,531 --> 02:34:58,750
What's important as you make that arrow
hit that x,

3181
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:02,340
so shoot it stupid.
Stop thinking about some girl you fucked

3182
02:35:02,341 --> 02:35:04,310
when you were 18,
right?

3183
02:35:05,610 --> 02:35:08,380
While you thinking about a car that you
sold when you were 22,

3184
02:35:08,381 --> 02:35:09,940
man,
if I had that car today,

3185
02:35:10,270 --> 02:35:13,330
I could fix it up and like,
what are all these extraneous silly

3186
02:35:13,331 --> 02:35:15,160
thoughts?
What are these traumas that these

3187
02:35:15,161 --> 02:35:17,440
animals don't carry?
Like you ever heard of a bear with

3188
02:35:17,441 --> 02:35:19,780
erectile dysfunction.
Maybe never.

3189
02:35:19,870 --> 02:35:23,970
Maybe maybe this gay bears maybe,
but they can still get it hard and

3190
02:35:23,980 --> 02:35:24,940
viagara I don't know.

3191
02:35:24,970 --> 02:35:28,960
All of these things that we have in our
that our monkeys are just broken because

3192
02:35:28,961 --> 02:35:31,600
we've ceased to recognize the monkey and
all of us.

3193
02:35:31,900 --> 02:35:34,390
You know,
so getting back to that and looking at

3194
02:35:34,391 --> 02:35:37,750
nature is just a great way to do it.
Whether you're hunting or camping or

3195
02:35:37,751 --> 02:35:39,430
whatever.
Just fucking soak that in.

3196
02:35:39,970 --> 02:35:42,400
You'll learn shit.
There's also a feeling that you get when

3197
02:35:42,401 --> 02:35:45,730
you're in the woods where there's.
There's no cell phone reception,

3198
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:47,740
there's no people.
You don't hear anything.

3199
02:35:47,741 --> 02:35:52,741
You're just surrounded by trees and
wildlife in some weird way.

3200
02:35:53,830 --> 02:35:56,500
It's for some people,
they find it lonely.

3201
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:58,310
They find it like,
god,

3202
02:35:58,311 --> 02:36:01,660
I hate this place.
Doesn't give a fuck about me because it

3203
02:36:01,661 --> 02:36:06,160
doesn't because you realize that you
really are a part of this enormous,

3204
02:36:06,310 --> 02:36:09,280
almost infinite system,
infinite and the terms.

3205
02:36:09,281 --> 02:36:12,580
If you go down to the macro level or the
micro level,

3206
02:36:12,581 --> 02:36:13,090
you're,
you're,

3207
02:36:13,090 --> 02:36:18,090
you're down to adams and you're down to
subatomic particles and then you expand

3208
02:36:19,331 --> 02:36:24,331
from there to cells and cell walls and
the structure of tissue in the body and

3209
02:36:24,821 --> 02:36:28,780
then the instincts that come with
keeping the body alive and then with a

3210
02:36:28,781 --> 02:36:33,781
human being language and then the
culture and media that you have absorbed

3211
02:36:35,831 --> 02:36:39,460
that has given you this distorted idea
of what life is,

3212
02:36:39,461 --> 02:36:42,910
what being a human is,
what being a man is that music should

3213
02:36:42,911 --> 02:36:43,300
play.

3214
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:45,220
When you see your girlfriend,
you know,

3215
02:36:45,221 --> 02:36:46,670
you know what I mean like this,
like they.

3216
02:36:46,671 --> 02:36:51,671
There should be a a score to your life
and that you are enormously important

3217
02:36:51,731 --> 02:36:55,150
because your ego wants you to survive
long enough to shoot your loads into

3218
02:36:55,151 --> 02:36:57,850
someone and make little baby arby's and
this.

3219
02:36:57,851 --> 02:36:59,320
All these things.
They don't.

3220
02:36:59,380 --> 02:37:01,300
They don't matter.
When you're in those woods,

3221
02:37:01,301 --> 02:37:04,930
all those things,
it's like the woods confront you with

3222
02:37:04,931 --> 02:37:09,931
this ultimate reality that you are a
part of this infinite system and this

3223
02:37:10,750 --> 02:37:14,080
infinite system.
When you really expand upon it,

3224
02:37:14,120 --> 02:37:16,040
the,
the very itself,

3225
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:18,830
the very planet,
this planet and all planets themselves

3226
02:37:19,100 --> 02:37:22,760
become tiny little subatomic particles
in the nature of the universe.

3227
02:37:23,140 --> 02:37:24,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

3228
02:37:24,441 --> 02:37:29,441
That's the perspective is so key and it
can be kind of mind boggling to think

3229
02:37:29,451 --> 02:37:30,290
about it.
I'd like to,

3230
02:37:30,580 --> 02:37:31,910
you know,
it's almost like we're,

3231
02:37:32,330 --> 02:37:34,640
we're lords of our own universe in our
universities.

3232
02:37:34,670 --> 02:37:36,860
Our body,
our thoughts can manifest different

3233
02:37:36,861 --> 02:37:39,470
things.
Our choices create the environment that

3234
02:37:39,471 --> 02:37:40,750
we live in.
So you know,

3235
02:37:40,790 --> 02:37:43,910
it's like we have our own universe and
then we're plugged into this,

3236
02:37:44,190 --> 02:37:46,220
you know,
greater universe that is,

3237
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:49,250
that we know all around us,
the planet and everything else and

3238
02:37:49,251 --> 02:37:53,630
that's plugged into the larger and you
start just expanding your perspective

3239
02:37:53,631 --> 02:37:56,840
and it just kind of really goes on
infinitely.

3240
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:59,810
You know,
like the cell is as part of an organ is

3241
02:37:59,990 --> 02:38:02,000
in there.
That's it's universal liver cell,

3242
02:38:02,001 --> 02:38:03,410
the university,
the liver cells,

3243
02:38:03,411 --> 02:38:05,570
the liver in there,
one cell in that thing.

3244
02:38:05,900 --> 02:38:08,570
It goes up and down infinitely and you
just get a,

3245
02:38:08,870 --> 02:38:10,730
get a perspective that,
you know,

3246
02:38:10,731 --> 02:38:12,560
everything's gonna be okay no matter
what.

3247
02:38:12,620 --> 02:38:15,260
Like everybody,
just fucking relax,

3248
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:17,720
enjoy yourself,
get back in touch with the monkey,

3249
02:38:17,721 --> 02:38:20,780
get back in touch with love and whatever
happens,

3250
02:38:20,781 --> 02:38:21,561
it's gonna,
be all right,

3251
02:38:21,561 --> 02:38:23,410
there'll be another earth,
there'll be another time,

3252
02:38:23,990 --> 02:38:26,330
there'll be another opportunity for this
thing to go.

3253
02:38:26,331 --> 02:38:30,740
We get so caught up in the minutia of
the details of this thing or that thing.

3254
02:38:31,070 --> 02:38:33,560
It'll be okay if the earth blinks out,
you know,

3255
02:38:33,561 --> 02:38:36,740
some other point in some other time in
the vastness of eternity,

3256
02:38:36,741 --> 02:38:39,290
another fucking awesome earth will come
with new,

3257
02:38:39,470 --> 02:38:42,710
awesome animals and it'll be okay.
Everything will be okay.

3258
02:38:43,560 --> 02:38:48,560
You heard avi gentlemen,
everything gonna be okay and with that

3259
02:38:49,830 --> 02:38:51,210
good night,
ladies and gentlemen,

3260
02:38:51,510 --> 02:38:54,120
much love buddy.
I'll remark is on social media.

3261
02:38:54,121 --> 02:38:57,060
If you want to follow me,
I love you guys on a dotcom pitches.

3262
02:38:57,390 --> 02:38:59,160
Go there and get optimized.
Holla.

3263
02:38:59,410 --> 02:39:00,080
Oh.
