1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,930
Three,
two,

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,300
one that a gun.
That's a real gun.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,650
Gentlemen.
We're live.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,440
It'll be all right.
Yeah,

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,323
thanks.
[inaudible].

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,500
How are you fuckers doing great man.
It's great to be on the show again.

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,570
Great to have you guys here.
Um,

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,310
you know,
I was watching your instagram the other

9
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,620
day and I was looking at you with fake
hips doing crazy fucking heavy dead

10
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,260
lifts.
Man,

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,800
that's amazing.
I am starting to dead lift a little bit

12
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:29,970
more because I've been doing this
carnivore diet and I feel great and

13
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:31,080
there's no reason not to,
right?

14
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:31,914
So,
um,

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,160
I just figured if I can do it and it
doesn't hurt,

16
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,270
Diana,
why not?

17
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:36,990
So,
uh,

18
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,290
I was going up until about 400 pounds,
but I think I can still,

19
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,970
I think I can even get stronger now.
So what I am so happy about is this is

20
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:46,680
something squatting and deadlifting.

21
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,080
It's something that was part of my life
all growing up.

22
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,990
I was a power lifter all growing up and
he's the one who got me into this shit

23
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,480
and it,
it got taken away from me and I was

24
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,840
really sad and disappointed.
Became a drug addict and an alcoholic

25
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,490
because of it.
And now I can lift again.

26
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:02,370
So I feel good.
Is that unusual for someone who's got

27
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:04,170
artificial hips to be able to do
something like that?

28
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,200
Um,
do you know how many people don't know

29
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,550
that I have artificial hips?
Well,

30
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:11,280
I do know that Ed Cohen,
who is the greatest power lifter of all

31
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,230
time,
he has two fake hips now,

32
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:13,561
right?
Yeah,

33
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:16,960
I think so.
I think he's still squat 600 gs

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,120
at Eddie cone.
Check him out.

35
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:24,750
He's a beast.
Fake hips squatting 600 pounds.

36
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,750
It sees that.
It's like one of the most effective

37
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:30,870
replacement surgeries that they do is
replacing.

38
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,850
Yeah,
I think it's a great and a big deal.

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,610
I think it's a great surgery.
Before I got it done,

40
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:37,230
I mean I couldn't even get up out of a
chair.

41
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,610
I was,
I'd be stuck,

42
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,070
you know,
I stick places and um,

43
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,830
before I got it done I couldn't really
move at all.

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,040
And then after I got it done,
they had botched one side.

45
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,940
So one side went perfect.
The other side for two years was all

46
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:52,890
screwed up and the doctors didn't know
it.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,550
What was screwed up about it?
Um,

48
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,220
the,
the cup,

49
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,650
there's a cup and then there's the ball
that goes into the cup.

50
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,100
The Cup came loose and it would,
it would shift around.

51
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:05,490
Now they think that the cup comes loose
because when you do both hips at the

52
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:08,700
same time,
they hammer one hip and the one side and

53
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:12,060
then you're completely like a dead body
almost and they flip you over and it's

54
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:14,010
really an island actually when they flip
you over,

55
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:17,910
they think that's when the hit might
that that socket may come out.

56
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,530
So they're starting to to question doing
them both on the same day.

57
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:23,370
Now,
yeah,

58
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:26,700
I've heard of people getting one done
and then a couple months later I would

59
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:29,520
recommend getting one done because then
when I got my other one,

60
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,670
when I got the one that was messed up
redone and I had one good leg and one,

61
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,160
you know,
one leg to recover on,

62
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,070
it was so much easier.
I didn't have to have the special toilet

63
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,170
and all the other students are going to
be on crutches instead of being in a

64
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:41,070
wheelchair.
Probably right.

65
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,830
If you only had one bathroom.
I actually wasn't even on crutches.

66
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,670
I came home from the hospital and that
day that I came home from the hospital I

67
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:48,630
was,
I was walking,

68
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:52,500
I even climbed a ladder and our mom
yelled at us and yelled at me because I

69
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,020
climbed the ladder and she's like,
what are you doing?

70
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,120
He just got a hip surgery and I'm like I
gotta change this light bulb.

71
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,280
I would think that one good benefit

72
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,720
about weightlifting with the increase in
bone density and that he would want that

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,830
if you have artificial hips especially
cause you got that bar that goes down

74
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,830
deep into the bone.
The hips got a Dexa scan done.

75
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,560
Weird shit going on.
We got really weird shit going on.

76
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:19,390
We had a Dexa scan done and Dr. Jacob
Wilson told us that our Boleyn,

77
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,210
was it bone mineral density density
density.

78
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:23,800
Yeah,
it was mine.

79
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,530
Mine was like off the charts,
but his was way off the charts.

80
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,760
And then we also got a biopsy done by a
Dr Andy Galpin and he's just like,

81
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,244
dude,
I love that guy.

82
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,990
He's like,
I don't the fuck's going on with your,

83
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,000
with my muscle and his muscle.
He's like,

84
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:39,460
but we need to talk about this morning.
So it's called steroids.

85
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,323
Yeah,
I know.

86
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,630
Yeah.
So he said he wanted to interview me

87
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:46,480
more in and talk to me more about like
what I've taken over the years ago.

88
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,020
It was different than works.
It works fantastic when people,

89
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,890
I just think I heard you talking the
other day about throwing a roundhouse

90
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,720
kick and he said it's a second nature to
you.

91
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,270
And I think for us,
we've been lifting for so long,

92
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,400
a lot of this stuff,
even when I was a drug addict and

93
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:03,280
alcoholic the entire time,
I still trained every day.

94
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,310
I wasn't doing as good of a job,
but I still would make it to the gym

95
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,660
everyday.
It's ingrained in us.

96
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,400
It's something that we've been doing
forever.

97
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:11,680
So I think the body is just designed for
it.

98
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,630
It's essentially designed for,
not design,

99
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:17,500
but you've sort of designed it and I
think it's something that found us,

100
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,220
you know,
like,

101
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,780
like we did kind of stumble upon it but
I think it's something that found us and

102
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,870
it's uh,
you know,

103
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,460
I was strong right out of the gate.

104
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,260
He was strong right out of the gate.
I mean I remember,

105
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,870
uh,
my friend's benching in the garage and

106
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:32,920
they were benching the bar,
maybe a 10 on each side and I was,

107
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:33,754
you know,
doing a plate,

108
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,070
doing one 85,
12 years old,

109
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,880
you know,
he was an animal when he was younger.

110
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:39,720
It's just something there,
there some sort of strength.

111
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:41,110
My Mom,
our mom bench,

112
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,840
what she meant to be fine.
Yeah,

113
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,730
she'd been mom can bench one 35 like
right off,

114
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,110
you know,
like without ever lifting.

115
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,020
I want to say,
I think she benched one 85 she might've

116
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,490
in the same day cause she ideas would
say immigrant mentality because your

117
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,430
mother from,
where's she from?

118
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,720
She's a Polish right?
You Go,

119
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,610
I just got some of my heart thought.
I'm just,

120
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,950
I'm just white
mix getting 23 and me done.

121
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,350
I got one of those things done and I,
yeah,

122
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:11,240
I'm like Irish and I'm like only 4% of
the,

123
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,210
and I thought we were more,
but it makes kind of sense.

124
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,610
Our grandmother was directly from
Sicily,

125
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:17,290
so I don't,
I don't understand how that happened.

126
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,340
Yeah.
We don't know what's going on.

127
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,190
Yeah.
Well even if she's from Sicily,

128
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:22,280
who knows?
Like how,

129
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,860
what happened?
She was over there.

130
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,060
She came from,
yeah.

131
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,641
Yeah.
I know.

132
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:27,910
I need to get mine done.
I've been wanting to get it done for

133
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,110
awhile.
It's pretty cool.

134
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,790
Someone a lot to tell you like
allergies,

135
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,980
they get mad.
People get mad.

136
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,660
The people will not really native
American.

137
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,830
They get rid of,
they get mad.

138
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,960
I think it was spiritual.
People were like,

139
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:40,420
I could drink so much because I'm Irish.
And then they find out they're not.

140
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,760
Yeah,
you're just a drug like that.

141
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,130
And it happens all the time.
People get really upset because they're

142
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:47,070
not what they've been rooting for.
The alliance.

143
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,590
People take great pride in that for some
reasons that you were so dumb.

144
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,473
Yeah.
Where you're from.

145
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,960
Who Cares?
I'm American control over that.

146
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:53,921
Yeah.
I,

147
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,970
I wish I was something stupid,
but there is,

148
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,300
I mean it not like one.

149
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,110
Yeah,
Polish is a silly one,

150
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,410
but in my mind they're fucking hard
people.

151
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,940
I've known a lot of Polish people and
like dare fucking tough people.

152
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,430
Like you want to Nj check.
That's a perfect example.

153
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,020
Some of the fighters Polidori Geraldine
and Kovach.

154
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,400
Kovich that's that a beast.
Nope.

155
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,620
No,
that woman I should say.

156
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,281
Yeah,
those,

157
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:23,310
those ladies are fucking tough.
Like when I was a kid watching pro

158
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:27,620
wrestling,
Ivan put ski the whole fucking Jack.

159
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,900
He was,
now he works at a Strip club in Vegas.

160
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,380
Does he still alive Polish power?
Like to go to that Strip club to shake

161
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:36,230
that guy.
But I know that um,

162
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,200
a bunch of the wrestlers worked at
Cheetahs.

163
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,030
I know the Godfather,
the wrestler,

164
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,310
the Godfather,
he still manages Cheetahs I guess.

165
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,380
And I think some of these real quick and
real life,

166
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,400
he's a real pantsuit.
I was watching some clips from last

167
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,940
night from wrestlemania and Ronda Rousey
was with Kurt Angle and I was looking at

168
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:53,890
Kurt Angle's body.

169
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,750
I was like wow,
that guy's gone through some damage

170
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,340
damage.
Lots of neck surgeries.

171
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,460
Well you could see it in his arms.
The neck surgeries you see in guy's arms

172
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:05,650
cause their arms atrophy.
Right.

173
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,270
He's at your feet a lot.
Yeah cause it's fucking neck.

174
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:09,860
Looks like a goddamn treat.
Trump,

175
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,860
he's just got this neck that starts
above his ears.

176
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,010
His arms are not nearly as to say as it
used to be.

177
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,600
I think it's nerve damage.
Right?

178
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:18,351
Exactly.
Yeah.

179
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:20,240
I had Pat Miletich in here a couple of
weeks ago,

180
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,170
you know former UFC champion pat and
he's got one arm that's smaller than the

181
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:25,880
other one boss route and to be here
tomorrow,

182
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,870
he's got the same issue.
Savage next neck issues for what you

183
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:32,390
know.
And I had a bulging disc in my neck and

184
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:36,050
I was getting weird,
a numbness in my hands and then nerve

185
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,700
pain in my elbow,
elbow,

186
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,570
the Ulnar nerve.

187
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,920
It goes on there and when you ignore
that shit and then keep training and

188
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,640
keep getting your fucking neck yanked
on,

189
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,920
then the disc starts to decay.
And then the pressing against the,

190
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,020
the the nerves and the,
um,

191
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,610
the,
the,

192
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,390
the spinal column,
it gets worse and then it starts

193
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:56,900
atrophying and cutting off the,
the nerves to your arms and you get to

194
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,180
the point where you're,
you're shit just shrinks and it doesn't

195
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:01,040
come back.
A lot of that stuff happens in your

196
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,380
sleep to like,
something gets aggravated from training,

197
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:05,060
but you sleep.
Where'd you sleep with your neck?

198
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:06,620
All twisted.
You know,

199
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:09,980
that happened to Brian Shaw,
but Brian Shaws 415 pounds.

200
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:13,790
But he said he wished he had a good
story for why his arm was atrophying,

201
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,640
but it was a,
he lost his grip strength 100%.

202
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:18,080
He's the world's strongest,
strongest man.

203
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,090
Yeah.
14 lost his grip strength and it was

204
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,370
mainly all through sleep.

205
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,360
Got To sleep apnea,
study done,

206
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,930
and then he got a see CPAP,
the c to help actually cured everything.

207
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:30,020
He tried to do any and everything.
He was doing all kinds of different

208
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:33,020
things to get his hand strength back and
it turned out his mainly asleep.

209
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,960
He's too big to sleep on his side.
Whoa,

210
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,720
that's crazy.
So how's you have to sleep face forward?

211
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,850
I think he has to sleep on his back.
I should get one of them.

212
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:42,460
Massage tables,
just sleep at his whole,

213
00:08:42,461 --> 00:08:44,390
it was facing the wall.
I want to do that.

214
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,690
You fall asleep on those things all the
time and that's the only way to keep

215
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:52,010
from snoring is the thing with me.
I have a fat tongue and if I lie down on

216
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:53,120
my back,
my tongue,

217
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,410
I have sleep apnea too,
but I wear a mouthpiece.

218
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,130
I

219
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,700
don't the of how some of these people
taping their mouth shit.

220
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,950
Yeah,
you could do that where a chin strap and

221
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,840
you can breathe through your nose.
It'll help.

222
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,100
Yeah.
Because if you breathe through your

223
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:09,480
mouth and your tongue falls back and it
came out of my mouth for improper,

224
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,850
you're not breathing properly would wake
up with headaches.

225
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,250
I would just wake up tired and with
headaches.

226
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,630
And then,
um,

227
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,450
I went to this guy,
doctor [inaudible],

228
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,310
he's in Encino and he has this
mouthpiece that is essentially,

229
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:24,510
it's a mouthpiece with like a tongue.
It presses down like a tongue depressor

230
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:27,360
presses down in your tongue and it keeps
your tongue from falling backward.

231
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,600
It was a fucking game changer for me.
Shit,

232
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,930
I tried to tap,
just changed.

233
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,880
Yeah.
I tried to see pat for one night.

234
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:36,930
I might get this fucking good robot
bullshit machine out of my face and mark

235
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:37,410
didn't like it.

236
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,340
He got scared and I,
yeah,

237
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,610
I'm claustrophobic.
So it scared the fuck out of me.

238
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,350
Really?
Yeah.

239
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,330
I hated that shit on my face and I tried
the [inaudible] the nose one.

240
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,640
I tried the mouth when I can do either
one of them mouthpiece

241
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,180
really,
really bad and um,

242
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,460
it's cleared up a lot by just losing
weight,

243
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,230
but I think and less fat.
That's a big thing.

244
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,220
Yeah,
that's a factor.

245
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,130
That's a factor for a lot of people.
The fat and their neck and everything.

246
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,560
Just sort of,
I mean I was again and got so big,

247
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:03,320
he can't actually fatter.
So I mean I,

248
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:05,720
I could see why that's a thing with
weightlifters.

249
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,750
You know,
interesting thing.

250
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:11,550
You get so big that you can't sleep.
You still some shit on your shirt.

251
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,610
You spilled some coffee there.
That's the worst.

252
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,880
Trying to wipe it up from getting a
stained.

253
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,350
So,
um,

254
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,220
tell me about this carnivore diet.
Cause I had Sean Baker in here and he

255
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:26,100
talked to me about it,
but he doesn't have any science,

256
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,850
you know,
there's no like he doesn't have any like

257
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,620
real tests or any longterm studies or
anything like that.

258
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,440
And you know,
I,

259
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,980
I'm a person who believes in balance and
I think that you need fido nutrients.

260
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:41,040
You need plant fiber.
I think there's a lot of healthy stuff

261
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,000
that you'd get from plants.
Um,

262
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,820
I'm a big believer in eating meat
though,

263
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,260
but all meet you guys doing all me.
Yeah,

264
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,200
I think there's modified it and think
there's some one at a time.

265
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,100
But yeah,
I think there's some,

266
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:54,720
I think there's some holes in every
diet.

267
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,200
I think when you go and you make the
decision to only eat meat,

268
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,710
then some rational thought should come
into your head.

269
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,130
Maybe when I switch all the way to just
meet all the time,

270
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,680
maybe there's a possibility I'm going to
eat too much meat.

271
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,730
And so maybe that would make sense to
bring in some fruit and bring in some

272
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:14,790
vegetables just so you're not eating too
much meat for the simple reason.

273
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,220
Vegetables have been shown and,
and there's,

274
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:18,660
you know,
you can get a study to show you

275
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:19,890
anything.
Uh,

276
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:23,400
but there's study a study that's been
done on 200,000 people that went on for

277
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,760
14 years and they studied,
uh,

278
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,350
vegetables.
They study every type of vegetable and

279
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:31,980
they found that they were more neutral
than they were harmful or good for you.

280
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,710
They found that fruit was a little bit
better for you.

281
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,330
And again,
you can have any studies say,

282
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,680
wait a minute,
what does this study?

283
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,810
It's called the pure study.
Wait a minute.

284
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:42,180
They said it's the vegetables or
neutral.

285
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,440
What does that mean?
They're neutral.

286
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:46,470
They're just really help you that much.
They weren't necessarily great and they

287
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:49,710
weren't necessarily bad.
I don't know what the Harrison to what

288
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:51,450
though.
I don't know what their standard was for

289
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:54,040
what they were looking for exactly.
But main thing they were looking

290
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,980
for was uh,
it being protective in terms of your

291
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:58,720
heart.
That was their main,

292
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,260
they're the main thing they were looking
at.

293
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,730
And so they found out that saturated fat
is protective of your heart.

294
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:06,190
They found out that cholesterol is
actually protective of your heart.

295
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,250
It found out that salt is pr now it's
all like,

296
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,353
you know,
without,

297
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,010
you can't take in tons and tons of salt
because then something's gonna kill you.

298
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:16,450
If you eat a pound of salt,
you're dead,

299
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,220
you know,
assaults,

300
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,700
one of those things.
It's really good for you.

301
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:21,190
It's an essential mineral to a certain
extent,

302
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,590
but have to take too much of it.
So I think any of these things can be

303
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:26,650
done too far.
I jumped on a carnivore diet just to

304
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:28,840
give it a shot and to see exactly what
it was about.

305
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,300
Because you talked to Sean,
Sean Baker.

306
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,870
Yeah,
he was.

307
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,090
He was on your podcast.
I got inspired to do it.

308
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:36,010
He was already doing it.
So I was like,

309
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:37,090
all right,
let me try it out.

310
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,700
I tried it out and got leaner.
It felt better and I was like,

311
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:41,290
this is pretty cool.
And why did you start it?

312
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,820
So I was doing a ketogenic diet for over
a year and lost a lot of weight on that

313
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,740
was doing great.
Feeling really good man.

314
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:49,740
You look very healthy.
I appreciate it.

315
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,650
I still have a long way to go.
In my opinion.

316
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,970
This is a work in progress,
but um,

317
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,470
the reason I did it was really simple.
It's a dietary intervention.

318
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,020
Um,
I went through sobriety as you know,

319
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,230
I was a drug addict and an alcoholic for
about six years and when I went through

320
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,820
sobriety,
that's a,

321
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,230
that's an intervention.
Like they,

322
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,370
there's something wrong,
there's a problem,

323
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:13,204
we need to fix it.

324
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:18,160
So my problem now was arthritis and I
needed something that was like an

325
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:21,160
intervention that would get me from,
you know,

326
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,560
uh,
being arthritic and in pain and not

327
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:26,290
being able to lift to being able to
lift.

328
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:30,100
And so there's some of this might be a
placebo effect of me going like,

329
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,780
well,
I'm on this diet and I feel great and

330
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:32,920
whatever.
And so I'm,

331
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,020
I'm now lifting more.
Um,

332
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:38,170
some of it may be a placebo effect and
that's okay with me if it is,

333
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,600
but I feel excellent on this diet and I
think the reason is,

334
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:45,610
is I'm getting a lot more protein in.
I wasn't getting enough protein on Kido

335
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,140
because I was listening to everybody
say,

336
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:49,210
well,
it will knock you out of ketosis if you

337
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,700
eat too much protein.
And that's what I constantly was being

338
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,440
told.
But I wasn't muscular.

339
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,130
I didn't have,
I wasn't being able to put on muscle.

340
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:57,751
Well,
you,

341
00:13:57,751 --> 00:14:00,880
you were constantly testing your blood
levels.

342
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,630
Were you using a meter?
Yeah,

343
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:04,360
every day.
About three or four times.

344
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:08,080
Like I'm crazy with it because ptosis,
the things that would knock me out of

345
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,390
Ketosis,
we're just like mainly anything with

346
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,780
carbohydrates.
Um,

347
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,680
I wasn't really having too much of a
problem with protein because I wasn't

348
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,960
eating a lot of protein.
But,

349
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:17,680
um,
there was,

350
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,470
there were things that if I cheated on
my diet for example,

351
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:21,730
of course that would,
you know,

352
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:25,570
he usually kicked me out of ketosis.
But then I also got to a point where you

353
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:29,380
become so fat adapted that you become
what we like to call metabolically

354
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:32,050
flexible.
Metabolic flexibility just means you can

355
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:34,220
switch from being a fat burner.
You know,

356
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:36,940
I'm mostly a fat burner for the most
part because I'm eating high fat.

357
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,430
But then if I do eat something with
sugar in it,

358
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:42,270
it doesn't really affect me that much
because I,

359
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,800
because I'm used to it 90%.
Yeah.

360
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:49,510
Going with the fat so I can kind of move
back and forth between those two things.

361
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,900
But what I realized on the Diet when I
switched over to carnivore the whole

362
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:54,591
time,
I was thinking,

363
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:56,210
man,
if I could just have an apple,

364
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,750
I would feel like I would feel so much
better cause just eating the steak,

365
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,250
it's killing me and it's driving me
crazy.

366
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:04,700
It was a killing just mentally I wasn't
ready for it.

367
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:06,980
I wasn't tough enough to just say,
okay,

368
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:11,981
I'll just have steak on a plate.
Well you automatically use intermittent

369
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:14,300
fasting almost cause you're like,
you don't always have a hamburger in

370
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:17,150
your pocket or you don't always a run
through in and out Burger,

371
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,080
whoever it might be.

372
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,870
But yeah,
you end up utilizing some intermittent

373
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:22,100
fasting and you're like,
fuck man,

374
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:25,160
the only food I have to eat as a
hamburger or a steak

375
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,160
and it was hamburger or a steak.
And I'm like,

376
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,490
well how about an apple?
So I talked to our friend Stan efforting

377
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:34,910
who's a bodybuilder and he's huge.
He jacked and he's also a power lifter

378
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,830
and soup.
The one years old,

379
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:39,470
two and fucking Jack Soup.
But one of the smartest guys I know.

380
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,240
And he sent me that study that I sent to
you with the,

381
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,240
about the fruit,
and I don't know if you watched that or

382
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:46,460
not,
but basically they did a large scale

383
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:49,400
study with fruit and they found out that
uh,

384
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,120
the fruit actually would drive blood
glucose down instead of,

385
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,180
instead of bringing it up when taken
with protein,

386
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,050
like red meat.
And so I'm like looking at this going

387
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:00,381
like,
well,

388
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:02,180
if it's not going to drive my glucose
up,

389
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:03,980
I mean that'd be the one thing I'm
concerned with.

390
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,640
Why not have some fruit?
And so that I'm in talking with Stan

391
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,910
about it,
he was saying like,

392
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,590
I think fruit is totally fine and I
think you can have as much as you want.

393
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,260
And so I sort of switched over.
And it's crazy though because that's,

394
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:16,300
that's sugar.
I mean,

395
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,110
yeah.
Your body.

396
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,110
How did you,
how was your body

397
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,000
glucose level?
They've done studies where they've,

398
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,600
where they've studied fruit toast.
So like everybody thinks fruit toast is

399
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:28,700
really bad,
but they think that because of high

400
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:33,050
fructose corn syrup and fructose is
really bad when it's outside of fruit.

401
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,660
But for some reason,
um,

402
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,090
fruit,
fruit has these phytonutrients that has

403
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:42,590
fiber in it and those things sort of
like protecting you from what's going on

404
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:43,610
in the sugar.
They actually,

405
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,880
there's Fido nutrients in fruit,
like say an apple.

406
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,870
There's certain phytonutrients in there
that won't allow your small intestine

407
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:51,920
and like absorb the fat.

408
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,110
And so it actually helps you to digest
things like red meat that have high fat.

409
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,990
There's fruit that help you digest the
sugars in them and not,

410
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,050
it's not like it share it out.
I'm not a doctor,

411
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:05,010
I'm a filmmaker.
So I started,

412
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:05,990
you know,
basically,

413
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,270
um,
ask a lot of questions that were a lot

414
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:11,660
of people and start figuring things out
and then it's trial and error.

415
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,090
Um,
right now I'm in the trial trial and

416
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:16,640
error part and it seems like it's been
working pretty good.

417
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:18,590
So No.
Are you getting your blood work done?

418
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,000
Yes.
Um,

419
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,980
just got my blood work done,
um,

420
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,220
from last month and everything improved
from Quito to carnivore.

421
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,170
I didn't really have any cholesterol
issues.

422
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,700
Um,
I didn't have any,

423
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,020
Eh,
the,

424
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,610
uh,
what was,

425
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,870
what,
what am my issues that we've had our

426
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:39,290
bloodwork done probably four or five
times in the last year or so,

427
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,070
I would say.

428
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,300
Yeah.
And uh,

429
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,770
you know,
not all the numbers are,

430
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,260
are fucking great,
but for the most part it's been pretty

431
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,760
healthy.
The cholesterol has been good to

432
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:49,130
triglycerides have been good.
Um,

433
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,180
this doesn't show up in your blood?
Uh,

434
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,650
just,
it's not in the hot,

435
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,420
not in the high range of,
you know,

436
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,610
of what,
what it shows you on the uh,

437
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,950
on the sheet.
And then we also had other people for

438
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:00,210
what?
Uh,

439
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,130
oh,
in terms of like the triglycerides and

440
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,950
the cholesterol and stuff like that.
So you're talking about,

441
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,410
well,
like what you soon,

442
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,890
what's not good?
No,

443
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,920
I'm just saying
everything's,

444
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,070
everything's been pretty good.
Like this last time I did have my,

445
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:15,450
um,
uh,

446
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,500
I had one of my markers Kinda high,
both had high c reactive protein and we

447
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:21,780
don't,
we're not sure why.

448
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,230
So that's something that we have to like
looking at what is c reactive protein?

449
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,920
It's a marker for inflammation and my
react specifically of the heart.

450
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,981
Yeah,
not good.

451
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:33,390
And I see this,
mine was really high on Kido,

452
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,610
but then after I went Keto to
carnivores,

453
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:36,840
it came way,
way down.

454
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:38,760
So I don't,
I don't know where it is right now.

455
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:42,630
And I also had a really hot mine
registered really high at a nowhere.

456
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,540
It was totally fine with all the blood
work I've had done.

457
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,090
And the last one I had done,
it skyrocketed.

458
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,291
People were saying,
well,

459
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:53,970
maybe it's because you worked out
beforehand or what you consistent in

460
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:56,340
when you ate,
when you got your tests done,

461
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,230
where are you guys on a fast train
beforehand?

462
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,360
So I might've fucked it up.
Oh,

463
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:02,080
you fucked it up for sure.
Yeah,

464
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,730
I'm saying it yourself after we,
you train,

465
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,280
you train like a fuck the blood work.
It's,

466
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,114
it's,
you know,

467
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,710
it's a snapshot in time and we hear that
a lot and I think that that's important

468
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,440
to realize and recognize that um,
it's just,

469
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,610
you know,
this one snapshot in time and we

470
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,300
constantly change all the time.

471
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,000
So particularly important with dietary
cholesterol,

472
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,580
with cholesterol in the blood,
the way it registers.

473
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,820
If you have a big fat filled meal and
then go and get a blood test versus you

474
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,760
fasting.
It's like how was your body absorbing?

475
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:39,750
This is what's really important.
How's your body absorbing these

476
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:42,110
essential new nutrients?
Not like what,

477
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:45,450
what happens right after you eat because
your body knows what to do with that

478
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,280
stuff.
My cholesterol was one 90,

479
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,840
which is good.
I mean they want it,

480
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,660
they want it to be under 200,
but I thought it was really interesting

481
00:19:51,661 --> 00:19:56,661
was my hdl went way up from a 60 points
when I'm going from Quito to carnivore.

482
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,190
Well are you eating a lot of fatty cuts?
Like rib eyes,

483
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,610
mostly rabbis.
I like a lot of dietary fat.

484
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:07,530
I like a lot of like meat fat,
you know,

485
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:09,570
I think there's a certain point right
because um,

486
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,590
I,
I don't know.

487
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,020
Before when I was doing the ketogenic
diet,

488
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,210
the fat is kind of free flowing because
a,

489
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,110
you make your bulletproof coffees and
you just dump it back and everything

490
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,790
too.
Putting butter on everything.

491
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,110
But when you have doing it,
yeah.

492
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,080
When you have a stake,
what's really nice about having a stake

493
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:29,070
is your rate about 65 to 75% fat
already?

494
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,650
Like just grinding corn after the box.
Yeah.

495
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,740
You eating corn fed beef?
Is that what you're going to be?

496
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:35,970
I eat both.
Um,

497
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,820
I think that um,
the difference between the grass fed and

498
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:39,990
the,
and the grain fred,

499
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,980
there really isn't a substantial amount
of proof of how much better that is.

500
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,650
I do know that grass fed beef has five
times the amount of Omega three.

501
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,070
So

502
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,650
you always want to pick grass fed beef
when you can,

503
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,260
but a lot of people can't afford it.
And also,

504
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,340
uh,
the bet for me,

505
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:58,390
the best meat is at Costco.
That's the best tasting meat that you're

506
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,860
going to find.
I've been everywhere.

507
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,020
It's my,
why is costco better?

508
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,050
It just tastes the best around for the
best.

509
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:09,940
They have the best meat and it's called
fuck some like expensive butcher shop.

510
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,740
It's corn fans.
Cosco standing.

511
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,850
Costco is all organic now too.
You know,

512
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,970
that's a weird word though.
That word is so loosely defined.

513
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,820
Well we didn't spray it with a fucking
dad right before we give to,

514
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,070
all right.
There is a,

515
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:26,080
um,
what is exactly organic.

516
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,450
You have to pay to get organic status
too.

517
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,840
That's a weird thing.
You know you have to pay a lot of money.

518
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:34,940
Cause I remember talking to the
bulletproof and night,

519
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,750
the guy was telling me like,
you have to uh,

520
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,610
to Dave Asprey,
he's telling me you have to pay money to

521
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:41,950
get recognized as being organic.

522
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,810
So I have some sort of,
that guy says,

523
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:44,940
well,
the fat.

524
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,930
Sure.
I know what I'm saying.

525
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,290
You have to pay to get it to be a,
I wonder if that's true.

526
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,580
Yeah.
I don't know if that's true.

527
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,740
It is true.
It doesn't mean I'm sure it costs money

528
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:59,140
to get tested and to make sure that
you're certified.

529
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,670
Yeah.
Inside,

530
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,210
something like that.
You had to pay money for it.

531
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,020
I mean,
there,

532
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,200
there has to be some sort of regular,
I mean,

533
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:07,780
but when you're looking at the standards
like that,

534
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:09,820
what does that mean?
It means no antibiotics,

535
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:10,870
no added hormones,
right?

536
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,260
Is that what it means?
I believe so.

537
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:12,881
Yeah.
Marines,

538
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:14,020
no pesticides.
Right?

539
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,003
Yeah.
I mean,

540
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,800
excuse me for plants and vegetables or
fruits and plants.

541
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,950
Um,
w the one thing that concerns me a with

542
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:25,240
grass fed meat is that you're eating
what you do.

543
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,930
You definitely get a more expensive cut,
but you're eating an animal that is

544
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,220
eating what it's supposed to eat.
Yeah.

545
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,600
When you're eating,
like I've had weigel beef and colby

546
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:35,620
beef,
it's delicious.

547
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,390
It's awesome man.
That's thing's dead.

548
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,510
That's a dying animal.
That's like eating a giant fat guy about

549
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:43,840
to have a heart attack.
I mean all that marbling that's not

550
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:47,560
supposed to happen.
Like you shoot a bison like a free range

551
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:51,130
bison,
you get a dark Ruby Red Hong Kong meat.

552
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,140
I mean,
and that's all I have to say.

553
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,800
I completely agree with you.
Um,

554
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,570
but there,
there isn't science to really support

555
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,700
that eating a cow that was fed with soy
or corn is necessarily way worse.

556
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,780
And so,
um,

557
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,540
I might just be stupid for waiting for
that to come out.

558
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,140
It could be worse on a second.
You just said that there's way more

559
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:16,060
omega fatty acids and grass fed beef,
that's omega fatty acids are essential

560
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,190
for brain development,
muscle development.

561
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:20,410
There's,
so there's so many benefits to a sense,

562
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,520
those essential fatty acids and if those
are more present in grass fed meat,

563
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:27,490
when you just assume that grass fed meat
is more nutritious.

564
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,450
Yeah,
I would,

565
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,670
I would say that it has more,
it has moral,

566
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:34,540
meg has more Omega three,
it might be more nutritious than in that

567
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,110
that particular a way that I say like,
you know,

568
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:40,960
is the cost benefit.
The other day I went and bought,

569
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,470
um,
grass fed meat from wholefoods 33 99 a

570
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:45,980
pound

571
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,610
for a filet,
1999 a pound at Costco for a flay.

572
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,500
The Costco one is so much better.
The one from whole food was almost not

573
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:55,370
edible.
Like it did,

574
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,780
didn't,
it didn't taste good.

575
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,340
It's real tough.
Tough fillet a at whole foods.

576
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:03,620
I don't know why they'd have crappy meat
for some reason.

577
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:05,700
Grass fed stuff.
Sometimes a little text message.

578
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,800
You get a sponsorship for Costco right
before you go?

579
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,661
No,
no,

580
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:10,940
no,
no nails for suspicion.

581
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,220
The ships.
But what I'm saying is that,

582
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,120
um,
I've,

583
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:19,210
I've gone to a lot of places is try to
find what me I thought tastes the best.

584
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:20,770
And um,
you know,

585
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,520
so for me,
sometimes I have to like,

586
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,590
you have to eat a lot of meat and if it
doesn't taste that good,

587
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,290
you're not going to get through it.
So I prefer to have meat that tastes

588
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:30,950
better.

589
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,950
I like 'em for grass fed me,
I like to use grass fed beef patties

590
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,420
cause they're a little fattier and they,
this tastes really,

591
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,920
those tastes fine to me.
Yeah.

592
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,980
But the grass fed steaks just,
they don't really taste as good.

593
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,870
So I just kind of switched back and
forth.

594
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,520
I think these are some of the smaller
issues.

595
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:48,710
These aren't the main things that we're
really trying to fight.

596
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,821
You know,
my brother and I,

597
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,654
we just,
uh,

598
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,710
took on to do another film and he,
you know,

599
00:24:53,711 --> 00:24:57,080
he and I are doing this one together on
nutrition and we're just,

600
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,050
we're trying to find out some truths.
I mean we're trying to find out about

601
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:02,180
grass fed and organic and all of these
different things.

602
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,810
But mainly we're just trying to figure
out how the fuck do we help fight

603
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:08,090
obesity?
How do we help fight diabetes?

604
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,510
How do we help people gain control of
their diet?

605
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:15,290
And I think that's really truly we're
talking about is control and you look at

606
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,870
it something like a ketogenetic diet,
in my opinion,

607
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,380
it's one of the few diets that can
really help people with control of their

608
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:24,440
diet because it can help break up the
cravings.

609
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,200
And that's really ultimately I think
where our fight is against.

610
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,620
It's against cravings while these
convenient foods that tastes so fucking

611
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:32,570
good,
while the credit thing space all the

612
00:25:32,571 --> 00:25:34,820
time,
fine carbohydrates and sugars a little,

613
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:36,320
those are giant.
And when,

614
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,860
excuse me,
when you hear about saturated fat being

615
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:42,560
dangerous,
it is dangerous if you take saturated

616
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:45,860
fat with high levels of carbohydrates
and high levels of refined sugars,

617
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,110
right?
Doctor Rhonda Patrick went over that in

618
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:51,980
depth and it's really fascinating the
reaction that your body has to the high

619
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:53,840
levels of carbohydrates in the high
levels of fat.

620
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,410
So your body is either fat burning or
carbohydrate burning.

621
00:25:57,411 --> 00:25:59,630
So when you combine the two of them
together,

622
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,780
you have a nightmare disaster,
but it's not the saturated fat that's

623
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:07,730
the problem.
It's a saturated fat in conjunction with

624
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:10,190
the refined carbohydrates and sugars.
And one of the things that they're

625
00:26:10,191 --> 00:26:15,191
finding too is one of the big arguments
that vegans in particular have used for

626
00:26:15,261 --> 00:26:17,720
high carbohydrate diets in,
in,

627
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,650
in relation to obesity,
is look at Asian cultures and Asian

628
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:23,930
cultures.
You have low levels of obesity,

629
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:26,750
but high levels of high carbohydrates.
But you know what else?

630
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:31,751
You have high levels of diabetes.
You don't have to fat to be diabetic.

631
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:37,090
How many people in China?
400 million people with diabetes there

632
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,760
break a record.
Their level slightly lower than ours.

633
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,830
Um,
in terms of diabetes,

634
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:44,010
but level

635
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,270
is higher than,
it's pretty high,

636
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:45,721
right?
Yeah.

637
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:48,570
Japan's level of diabetes per capita is
higher than ours.

638
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,970
Their body crazy levels are probably
pretty high too.

639
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,631
No,
no.

640
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:53,130
Their body fat levels are lower than
ours.

641
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,001
We're gross.
Oh,

642
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:55,320
of course.
They're looking at you and I,

643
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:58,590
and not the three of us were not gross,
but Americans were fucking gross.

644
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,030
Yeah.
You know,

645
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:04,030
we fucking dog shit and we eat and look
and speaking of dogs,

646
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:09,531
so we feed our dogs only to like species
on the planet that get fat are human

647
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:15,600
beings and the things that we feed,
oh my friend's cat is a cat.

648
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,920
It could be a dog but it's our pets and
people get fat ice cream.

649
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,760
You know we grew up like that.
We grew up eating oreo cookies,

650
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:26,580
having you know,
a plethora of ice creams and different

651
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:29,490
things and the inner cabinets or the gym
and do you know,

652
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,500
full on squat workout,
you know,

653
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:34,370
work up to 500 pounds and go home and
eat like you know,

654
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,400
half a gallon ice cream.

655
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,350
Just cause we didn't know any better.
It's not even true.

656
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:40,020
It wasn't a full workout.
It was just a squat as heavy as we

657
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:41,150
could.
Then we went home and you know,

658
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,920
but there's some benefit for eating some
sugar post workout.

659
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,783
Right?
Yeah.

660
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,910
I know Jim still penny he believes in
that.

661
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,650
Like he's into like gummy bears and
shit.

662
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:54,450
Like that is a big shift though in
what's going on in nutrition and what

663
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:58,410
people think about that co that
postworkout carb window and all that

664
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:00,390
kind of thing.
I think a lot of people have been

665
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:03,210
shifting away from that kind of stuff.
A lot of people have been shifting away

666
00:28:03,211 --> 00:28:06,330
from six meals a day.
A lot of them people been shifting away

667
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:10,710
from fasted cardio and a lot of these
dietary like sort of myths that we

668
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,560
thought that we needed to do.
We're looking into it and going like,

669
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:15,360
wait,
if you don't eat after you work out,

670
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,820
you don't lose muscle,
you don't do that.

671
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,270
You know,
these things don't happen.

672
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,240
So do you need to do that?
Like it could be beneficial or it could

673
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,370
not be,
but we're starting to realize that,

674
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,290
you know,
maybe some of these things that we were

675
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:28,170
doing aren't necessary.
I think there's science behind it too

676
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:30,720
because there's money to be made,
so I don't think it really matters

677
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:33,690
exactly when you take in your carbs.
I think if you were just to have carbs

678
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:35,970
throughout the day,
I think you would end up with a similar

679
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:38,160
pump and you'd end up with similar
recovery levels.

680
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:40,410
I know there's a lot of studies showing
that,

681
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:42,670
but there's probably not a study showing
a,

682
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,470
if you took in 300 grams of carbs just
normally versus dumping some more in

683
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:48,420
after workout.
Well you guys know Rob Wolf,

684
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:49,110
right?
Absolutely.

685
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,100
He's awesome.
He's great.

686
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,770
But one of the things that Rob Wolf has
done is pretty interesting as he and his

687
00:28:52,771 --> 00:28:56,090
wife will eat the exact same thing and
then an hour later they tend to the

688
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,320
coast and they have very different
results.

689
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,900
And this is something that's really
important to emphasize.

690
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:04,920
Everybody's body is different.
And some people just like,

691
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,430
I have one daughter that can't,
she's lactose intolerant.

692
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:09,300
She,
she drinks milk,

693
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:11,100
she starts farting,
which is seven years old.

694
00:29:11,101 --> 00:29:13,290
She thinks it's hilarious.
She thinks it's Hilarious,

695
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,850
but it does hurt her stomach a little
bit and you know,

696
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,100
but she'll have like a little ice cream
and it's just start farden and she does

697
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:21,000
it on q two.
She goes,

698
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,150
there's something really important to
tell you how she nails you.

699
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,830
She knows like she'd been hanging out
with you guys to hanging out with Quinn.

700
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,620
That's his jokes.
But my other daughter and my nine year

701
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:32,610
old,
a zero problem with,

702
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,690
so it's,
um,

703
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,330
it is,
it's just a physiological thing and it's

704
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:37,230
a weird roll.
The dice.

705
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:38,070
I mean,
human beings,

706
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,350
we've very an color.
We vary in height,

707
00:29:40,351 --> 00:29:41,480
we very,
in everything we've,

708
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:41,980
we definitely

709
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,320
very in our dietary needs.
And that's what makes,

710
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:48,760
it's so crazy to try to give people a,
any sort of nutritional advice because,

711
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,250
you know,
you can't talk in generalizations.

712
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:52,750
He can't say this will work for
everybody.

713
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,790
I can't get on here and say an all meat
diet.

714
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,830
I think you can,
we'll work for everybody.

715
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:58,690
And in some way,
I think most people are eating too much

716
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:02,890
sugar.
People that are fat and a carb period.

717
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:03,670
Well,
that's,

718
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,370
that's what we're trying to define by
doing a documentary.

719
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,370
What are the couple things that we can
point to and say,

720
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,070
everybody needs to do this,
this and this.

721
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:15,340
And then these other things are like,
I just wonder if the average American

722
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:18,420
only 800 carbs every day,
if people wouldn't be fat,

723
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,100
you know,
it makes me scratch my hydrate

724
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,150
requirements for athletes though.
Oh,

725
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,670
like,
yeah,

726
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:25,990
like my friend Cam Haynes who runs like
when he's training for these ultra

727
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,330
marathons,
he runs a fucking marathon a day.

728
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,620
That guy needs more carbs than the
average guy who sits in front of his

729
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:33,970
desk in his,
on a can.

730
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:35,950
Here's where carbon,
I may be really more fat.

731
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,570
You know,
like they may be you only,

732
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:39,330
you can only store,
um,

733
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,840
2000 calories of carbohydrate in your
body at one time.

734
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:47,680
But the normal average person has about
40,000 calories of fat just hanging out

735
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,090
on their body and they don't even know
it,

736
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,250
right?
So we have a lot more energy available

737
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:53,410
to us as,
as fat.

738
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:57,520
If we learn how to utilize carbs are
also crucial from one workout to the

739
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:59,080
next.
So if you're anybody that ever does

740
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:01,720
multiple workouts in a day of any of
these MMA fighters,

741
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,550
crossfitters,
they're doing multiple,

742
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,400
they absolutely need carbs and it's a
good opportunity like forget the car

743
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:11,440
window necessarily.
It's just another opportunity to eat and

744
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:12,430
to get in some calories.

745
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,430
And so I think for them,
post workout shakes and those carb

746
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:18,580
shakes could be really beneficial.
It's a problem with athletes too because

747
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,360
they're always trying to find the
optimum performance and you're

748
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:25,900
experimenting and you're wondering how
much of your mind fucking yourself,

749
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:28,120
how much of it is just because you
worked out too hard?

750
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,120
Like where's your energy level at?
It's that you didn't sleep good.

751
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,830
Is that your diet?
Like what is it?

752
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:34,870
You know,
and they're always trying to figure it

753
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:36,730
out.
It's a big commitment and a big deal to

754
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:40,540
actually stop what you're doing and,
and to eat because it takes you like

755
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:44,440
2030 minutes to actually eat.
Might take a 10 20 minutes to cook the

756
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:47,890
meal and then you have 2030 minutes to
try to digest it.

757
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:51,880
And you're not sure if you're doing mma,
you have intense workouts or if you're

758
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:54,400
doing crossfit or some of these workouts
can be really intense.

759
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,160
You're not sure how that's going to sit.
So sometimes for me,

760
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,301
I'm just like,
fuck it,

761
00:31:58,301 --> 00:31:59,740
I'm just going to use intermittent
fasting,

762
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:03,520
but I don't compete anymore.
So for me it doesn't matter as much.

763
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,690
Well,
intermittent fasting,

764
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:06,720
it's absolutely beneficial.
And I think one of the things that we've

765
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,950
talking about,
one of the benefits of the Keto Diet

766
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,580
that you also get from intermittent
fasting is when your body goes into fat

767
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:13,750
burning mode,
you're,

768
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,970
your hunger goes away.
It's the weirdest thing.

769
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,160
That's an important thing to kill.
I had a really poor relationship with

770
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:24,550
food before I even started the Ketogenic
Diet.

771
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,300
And by,
by doing women too,

772
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,810
let's not talk over each other.
I know it's hard and we're all doing it,

773
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:30,460
but let's try.
Gotcha.

774
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,320
And so,
but yeah,

775
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,480
not being hungry has allowed me to have
a little bit,

776
00:32:35,481 --> 00:32:35,830
uh,
you know,

777
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,660
I feel free now.
I feel like I'm not,

778
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,560
you know,
attached food.

779
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:40,040
I don't need

780
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,770
food all the time.
I used to think about food all the time

781
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:44,240
because I was constantly,
you know,

782
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,090
eating things with sugar in it.
I used to go to the movies and cause I'm

783
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,100
a filmmaker,
I love to go to the movies and I used to

784
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:53,420
go all the time and I had this rule
where during the movie was my only time

785
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:57,080
I could cheat on my diet and I could eat
whatever I wanted and it turned into a

786
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:58,640
cluster fuck because I,
I'd have,

787
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,560
you know,
I'd have like the little pretzel bites

788
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:04,470
with the cheese that you'd did ben have
sour patch kids and twizzlers and I'd

789
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,110
buy three bags of candy and pretzels and
I'd eat the whole thing during the movie

790
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,380
because the movie's usually suck.
And I need something to do to keep my

791
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:15,440
mind off of the shitty movie.
So I would eat the whole time,

792
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:15,650
you know?

793
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,870
And obviously that didn't work,
you know,

794
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,090
and I was doing,
I was dieting besides that,

795
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,200
but you know,
it wasn't doing anything because I was

796
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,640
killing all the,
you know,

797
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,640
all the progress I was making.
But by doing this Keto genic diet and

798
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:32,660
not being hungry,
it's allowed me to just sit back and

799
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:34,430
look at food and go,
I want that.

800
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,750
And I want that because it's good for me
rather than say I need this now because

801
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,580
I'm hungry.
Do you still do cheat meals?

802
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,840
No.
Well,

803
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,080
once in awhile I shouldn't say no
because then somebody will catch me on

804
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:46,670
instagram with a piece of cake and be
like,

805
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:50,480
that guy's a liar.
But the thing is I don't,

806
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:54,560
I try not to,
but there's things that that are

807
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,580
cheating for the carnivore diet that
sometimes like come into my life.

808
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:01,220
Like somebody makes a new bar and they
give it to me and they're like,

809
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:01,551
oh,
here,

810
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:02,390
try this bar.

811
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,100
And I want to just try it to see if it's
good.

812
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:05,870
So yeah,
it's off my diet and I'll eat it.

813
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,080
But my cheats are much less damaging
than they used to be.

814
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:12,350
My cheats now are what some people call
health foods now.

815
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:15,050
When you say carnivores,
you t you saying that all of your meals

816
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,400
or just meat?
Yeah,

817
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,410
they're just,
yeah,

818
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:23,411
just meet just a steak usually or um,
grass fed beef salads,

819
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,890
no salads for the most part.
Uh,

820
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,270
every once in a while,
like if I'm at a restaurant or something

821
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:31,940
and a salad creeps in,
I'll have a couple bites of it.

822
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,810
But,
um,

823
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:36,170
I'm not a vegetable kind of guy.
I've never really liked them.

824
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,390
But I do love fruit.
I like the sweet stuff,

825
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:39,980
but I don't like the vegetables that
much.

826
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:41,420
So how much fruit to you to do now?

827
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,600
About two to three pieces of fruit a
day.

828
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,280
Um,
like an apple,

829
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,650
like maybe two apples a day,
probably something like that.

830
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:50,150
And then how many meals and maybe be
one.

831
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,250
And then about two meals a day.
Like two,

832
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,820
maybe like two stakes or you know,
maybe for Burger patties or something

833
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:58,010
like that.
So it's not a whole lot of food that I'm

834
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:00,530
talking about.
I can't eat like Dr. Sean Baker.

835
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,290
He's an animal.
Eats about four pounds of meat a day.

836
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,570
He's a big giant dude.
But yeah,

837
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,391
he's six,
five.

838
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:08,300
He's a foot taller than I am,
so that's pretty crazy right there.

839
00:35:08,301 --> 00:35:11,270
So yeah,
there's not a whole lot of food.

840
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,420
I think a lot of people want to hear all
meet.

841
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,810
They're just thinking,
um,

842
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,930
downing these giant plates of food.
But I'm not that hungry.

843
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,190
So I try,
I do have to try to hit my protein goal

844
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,960
each day though,
which is about,

845
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,000
you know,
I need a certain amount of protein,

846
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:30,020
so I need like 168 grams of protein or
something like that.

847
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,450
I went off the rails the other night at
a Peter Luger's in Brooklyn.

848
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,700
I saw that and we were,
we were so excited.

849
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,630
Ooh.
So good.

850
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,010
But we were eating steak and then I was
stuffed from the

851
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,510
steak,
but French fries were there.

852
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,830
And it's a weird thing,
man.

853
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,030
When you eat steak and there's fries,
you could be stuffed from the steak,

854
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:47,010
but you fucking keep pounding those
fries.

855
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,230
Those salty fries are still God damn
good.

856
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,250
Palate fatigue is a big thing.
And that's what a professional eaters

857
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,840
do.
They go from like,

858
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,850
they'll be eating ice cream and I can't
eat anymore.

859
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,600
So they eat some French fries because
it's a different taste salt.

860
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,660
There's something about the side food
with salt.

861
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,570
You could just stuff more in there.
If you look at like Brian Shaw,

862
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:08,700
the world's strongest man that we were
talking about before,

863
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,020
he uses a dextrose.
He takes like puts it on rice,

864
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:16,620
which is just sugar and he puts it on
rice so that you can eat more rice.

865
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,150
Jesus.
Yeah.

866
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:19,740
Just so he'd get bigger so you can get
bigger.

867
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,940
Yeah.
So you can maintain it,

868
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,320
maintain his,
uh,

869
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,630
his felt 440 pound body.
That's fucking,

870
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,870
well,
that's a totally different thing.

871
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,270
One thing that we,
one thing that we've tried to do is

872
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,180
we've tried to not celebrate,
you know,

873
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:36,180
I think that can be an issue.
It's like you do want to celebrate here

874
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:37,560
and there.
You want to have some fun here and

875
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:40,200
there,
but have control over that celebration.

876
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:42,330
Like you're celebrating,
you know,

877
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:45,300
you're,
you're a buddy's birthday party that you

878
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:48,810
never even talked to and you're getting
drunk and eating fucking cheesecake and

879
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:51,570
stuff.
Celebrate when you really want to

880
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:53,400
celebrate,
when you really kind of quote unquote

881
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:54,740
need to,
uh,

882
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,300
maybe you celebrate after you lost 20
pounds.

883
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:59,470
But if you celebrate,
uh,

884
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,920
by cheating on your diet,
uh,

885
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:04,950
it's actually like more harmful to you
than it is a real celebration.

886
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:07,860
You're hurting yourself rather than
helping improve yourself.

887
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,660
Now we do need to be,
uh,

888
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,770
we do need times where we do have fun
and we kick back and have a couple of

889
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:15,360
drinks,
but drinking or overeating,

890
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,210
a lot of those things,
even when you're trying to stay on your

891
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:20,310
diet,
they will almost always lead to

892
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:21,900
cheating.
I noticed that when,

893
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:23,180
if I overeat,
that's,

894
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:23,850
that's,
uh,

895
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,970
when I get hit with a craving sometimes,
so somebody might think,

896
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:28,260
oh,
I'm just going to stuff myself with a

897
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:30,090
bunch of burgers.
I'm gonna stuff myself with a bunch of

898
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:31,230
meat.
Um,

899
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:31,921
it,
for me,

900
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:34,680
it hasn't worked that way.
It kind of makes those cravings creep

901
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:36,120
back in.
Yeah,

902
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:37,110
for sure.
I mean,

903
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,800
but it's also psychologically it's fun.
Cheat.

904
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,080
Absolutely.
Give yourself a little bit of a break at

905
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:45,480
some linguine with clams.
I'd say even like on a,

906
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,040
on a,
on a carnivore diet,

907
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,000
there's some things that I eat.

908
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,290
I consider them like slight cheats,
like going to in and out burger,

909
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,210
you know,
getting like a flying Dutchman,

910
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,640
you know,
that is no flying Dutchman is uh,

911
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,800
uh,
patty and then two pieces of cheese and

912
00:37:58,801 --> 00:38:02,190
on a patty that's cheating.
Well it's the cheese because of the

913
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:03,050
cheese.
Yeah.

914
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,040
And,
and it's,

915
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,910
it's not grass fed or anything like
that.

916
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:06,480
So you're like,
no.

917
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,291
So they have,
who knows?

918
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,510
Well what I'm eating,
but at least it sort of fits on my,

919
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,180
my plan.
But those are so good that every once in

920
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:12,721
a while,
you know,

921
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:14,520
he stopped it in and out and get a
couple,

922
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,570
I'd get it with the lettuce on.
Um,

923
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,290
they give you way too much lettuce.
I think that they can be like an entire

924
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:20,520
head of lettuce.
And I'm like,

925
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:22,530
how do I get through this?
You don't like let us,

926
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,513
no,
not really.

927
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,490
Not a big fan.
And neither one of us love salad.

928
00:38:26,491 --> 00:38:30,570
I S I said on instagram the other day
that a salad is fake news and people got

929
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:33,060
really pissed.
But what I meant by that was just that

930
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,010
people are dumping tons of dressing on
it.

931
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,270
Oh yeah.
And they're not getting in and getting

932
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:39,940
what they think they're getting.
And especially like a lot of salads that

933
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:43,900
you get at like a restaurant or just a,
they're not even very green or anything

934
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,100
that just got full of very teachers.
A couple dressings like mark sisson

935
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:49,920
makes a dressing that's,
that's pretty good.

936
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,700
Made with avocado oil,
I think.

937
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:52,780
Things like that.
And He,

938
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:55,300
and he says,
I made this dressing because I wanted to

939
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:57,250
be able to dump as much as I want on the
here.

940
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,080
And the more I'd dump on the healthier
it gets.

941
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:03,250
And I liked that idea because I eat a
lot of wild game.

942
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,810
Wild game doesn't have much fat at all.
Like if I talked about that chipolte lay

943
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:11,080
mayonnaise and I started eating like
crazy after you said it,

944
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,220
I had a ton of it this morning with a
steak.

945
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,600
That's really good.
I'll slice of pizza,

946
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:19,150
steak,
Dunkin and put a fucking Glob of

947
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,940
mayonnaise on my plate.
I'll dunk the stake in the mail,

948
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,630
but it's a chipolte lay lime mayo and
it's made with avocado oil,

949
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:27,130
so you're getting all these healthy
fats.

950
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,110
It gives you some nice taste,
and again,

951
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,720
because I'm eating moose and elk and
deer,

952
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,370
it was a very,
very lean meats.

953
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,360
If I'm not eating like a cow,
if not even eating beef,

954
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:42,390
my meat is mostly really wouldn't be
able to do a carnivore diet on those

955
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:43,451
kinds of meats.
Right.

956
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:44,800
I mean it's too,
it's too lean,

957
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:45,251
right?
Yeah,

958
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:47,140
I would think so.
You'd have to add fat,

959
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,880
other rabbit starvation.

960
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:52,900
Yeah.
Rabbits are extremely lean and you can

961
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,180
eat only rabbit and literally starve to
death.

962
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,051
Wow.
Yeah.

963
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:58,360
People have experienced rabbit
starvation.

964
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,510
She sounds crazy.
It is crazy because it's so lean.

965
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,620
Google that Google rabbit starvation,
what that means,

966
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,590
because someone told me about that and I
literally never looked into it other

967
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:11,450
than what they said,
but it's so lean that yeah,

968
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,480
your body just doesn't get enough fat
to,

969
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:17,020
butchers typically add fat to a wild
game,

970
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:19,390
like when they chop it up and stuff.
Not Protein poisoning.

971
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,940
Protein poisoning.
Also reserve for it as a rabbit

972
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:25,060
starvation,
a rare form of acute malnutrition

973
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,610
thought to be caused by a complete
absence of fat,

974
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,510
the Diet.
Oh,

975
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:30,370
that's interesting.
They call it protein poisoning and

976
00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:31,204
rolling.
Yeah,

977
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,380
so because if you just eat rabbits,
like if you just have like a fucking

978
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:36,670
room full rabbit,
rabbit,

979
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,600
rabbit me.

980
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,190
But most people would eat rabbits,
eat my rabbits with potatoes and you

981
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,090
look at that rabbit starvation man
cannot live by rabbits alone.

982
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:49,210
The meat is too lean.
Add fats in a few carbs or protein to

983
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:51,040
the lap end.
I guess that's what a rabbit is.

984
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:54,550
And you can easily survive rabbit meat.
Lapin is typically to lean.

985
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,440
Yeah.
It's interesting.

986
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,720
Leaner than chicken,
I guess.

987
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,860
Yes.
Yeah.

988
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:01,780
Well those little fuckers are just
running all the time.

989
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,061
Wow.
Interesting.

990
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,570
How to,
on a ketogenic diet,

991
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,530
I was up around 200 grams of protein
when I first started it.

992
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,330
That was just dropping fat like crazy.
Just drop me.

993
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,220
That's not a ketogenic diet.
200 grams of protein fat.

994
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,370
Oh fat is 20 grams of fat and I was
dropping,

995
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,750
I said protein,
200 grams of fat and I was just dropping

996
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:23,620
fat.
Like you know,

997
00:41:23,621 --> 00:41:24,580
like crazy.
Oh yeah.

998
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,380
But then,
then it came to a point where it

999
00:41:26,381 --> 00:41:28,870
stopped.
I think that's what everybody needs to

1000
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:33,350
know is a and I on any of these diets,
they eventually plateau or stop and then

1001
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,010
you have to sort of

1002
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,190
figure out how to get around that
roadblock and continue to like lose more

1003
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:38,510
weight or do whatever you're trying to
do.

1004
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,670
Well,
some people just too much protein knocks

1005
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:43,850
you out of ketosis because your body
takes too much protein in reverts it to

1006
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:44,684
glucose.
Right.

1007
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,440
I think that's a lot.
I think it's overstated a lot though.

1008
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,810
I mean,
I think like if you have a couple of

1009
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,610
grams over,
you're not going to be in trouble.

1010
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,970
But if you're getting 500 grams of
protein or something crazy or even like

1011
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,300
300 grams of protein,
I,

1012
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,540
you know,
after a while you're going to get to too

1013
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:03,020
much and you're gonna have that problem.
But I feel like for most people,

1014
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,770
that's not going to be the main issue.
You know?

1015
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,020
For me it's inflammation.
Inflammation is,

1016
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,540
the big difference is when I eat a lot
of carbs,

1017
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:14,800
if I go off the rails and I'll cheat and
have pasta or bread or something like

1018
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,810
that,
I experienced more inflammation.

1019
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,030
It's appearance,
more soreness in my joints.

1020
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:19,810
I've,
I'm,

1021
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,580
I'm,
you get more fatigued.

1022
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,350
You get,
you know,

1023
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,970
like tired,
you get that insulin crash,

1024
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,030
you get all those big factors that I
don't,

1025
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:33,090
I just don't get when I eat clean,
when I eat just meat and salad and

1026
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:36,400
vegetables and high fat diet and low
carb,

1027
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,640
my body is just way more efficient and
just,

1028
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,770
it feels better.
And the big thing that I keep trying to

1029
00:42:41,771 --> 00:42:44,170
stress to people is you don't need a
nap.

1030
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:47,470
That fucking afternoon nap,
which I just thought it's something you

1031
00:42:47,471 --> 00:42:50,770
need.
All that is is just your body recovering

1032
00:42:50,771 --> 00:42:52,150
from lunch.
FM carbs.

1033
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,980
Yeah.
You're fucking carbs at lunch if you

1034
00:42:53,981 --> 00:42:57,010
don't have that,
the day is much more efficient.

1035
00:42:57,011 --> 00:42:59,650
I get more done,
I have more energy and I was like,

1036
00:42:59,651 --> 00:43:01,570
when people say how do you do like all
these podcasts,

1037
00:43:01,571 --> 00:43:03,370
two podcasts a day,
like no,

1038
00:43:03,371 --> 00:43:04,870
I eat good,
eat good.

1039
00:43:04,871 --> 00:43:06,400
And it's not hard.
It's not hard.

1040
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:09,160
Your brain is functioning all day long,
but man,

1041
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:14,161
if I stopped at noon and had a fucking
pizza and then try to do a podcast,

1042
00:43:14,381 --> 00:43:15,430
I'd be here like going,
oh,

1043
00:43:15,431 --> 00:43:17,050
is this done yet?
I need to sleep.

1044
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,340
They just get tired.
Yeah,

1045
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,220
you get exhausted.
We've been doing this diet since the mid

1046
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:25,030
ninety's since like 1993 I think it was
around the time we kind of started.

1047
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,600
We've been doing them on and off for a
long time and more recently I used it to

1048
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:32,020
drop 70 pounds.
But I think one of the,

1049
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,920
one of the things with Kido that I
noticed was it almost doesn't really

1050
00:43:35,921 --> 00:43:38,140
matter that,
I mean ketosis all the time.

1051
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,110
I think the effort to be in Ketosis I
think is important,

1052
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,790
uh,
by getting rid of a lot of the

1053
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:46,630
carbohydrates that you have the effort
to kind of eat a little bit more fat.

1054
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:51,160
But what I've noticed is I don't think I
need to really go out of my way to eat

1055
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,320
tons and tons of fat.
I don't need to be dumping tons of MCT

1056
00:43:53,321 --> 00:43:54,790
oil and stuff.
I don't need to,

1057
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:55,740
uh,
I,

1058
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,030
there's enough fat usually in the stakes
that I'm eating.

1059
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,310
A lot of times I get ribeye.
Um,

1060
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,290
sometimes I eat bacon,
a eggs,

1061
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:04,960
things like that.
I put up on my instagram the other day

1062
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,470
about seven or eight foods that I
thought if you just stuck to these seven

1063
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:11,590
or eight foods for a handful of days,
you would lose a lot of weight.

1064
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:15,270
And the response was amazing.
People were writing back and you're

1065
00:44:15,271 --> 00:44:15,881
like,
Holy Shit,

1066
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:17,290
man,
I had lost 10 pounds and well,

1067
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:18,970
a lot of people do lose weight off
Quito.

1068
00:44:18,971 --> 00:44:21,520
There's no doubt about that.
But even mark Sisson,

1069
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:26,400
who was one that got me into it,
mark goes on and off and he thinks that

1070
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,210
there's some benefit to going on and
off.

1071
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,860
Yeah.
I don't think he has to be in Ketosis.

1072
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,450
Ketogenetic Diet.
Yeah.

1073
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,070
But even when

1074
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,130
you go off,
you're not switching your diet to

1075
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,330
spaghetti.
You know,

1076
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:37,470
you're not eating,
you know,

1077
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,280
fucking wonder bread or shit like that.
That's love it.

1078
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,550
If you switched up spaghetti,
right.

1079
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:42,690
That's your thing.
Pasta.

1080
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:43,620
Well,
I like it.

1081
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,530
I like it when I cheat,
but I don't like the effect on my body

1082
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:48,060
for sure.
I just liked the taste of it.

1083
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,760
Like linguine with clams is one of my
favorite things to eat,

1084
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:54,870
but the way I feel afterwards,
it's not my favorite bread and butter.

1085
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:55,763
Why is that?
So?

1086
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,320
Why is that so?
It's amazing.

1087
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:57,991
So good.
Well,

1088
00:44:57,991 --> 00:44:59,490
you know,
people are out in county.

1089
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,080
They don't even know.
We always talk about this.

1090
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:02,310
Hard roles used to go.
Yeah,

1091
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,330
like a buttered roll in the morning and
we grew up in New York,

1092
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,940
buttered roll with butter.
It was the best thing ever.

1093
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,500
And out here they don't have him.

1094
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,300
Thank God.
I'm actually glad they don't have now

1095
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,290
you know and I've had that I fucking
love sour dough bread with grass fed

1096
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:18,830
butter and honey.
Oh my God,

1097
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:21,150
they had sourdough salad is really good.
What honey?

1098
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,420
On top of the butter.
Oh,

1099
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:28,740
oh all this keto genic sounds amazing.
When all this stuff going on.

1100
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:30,750
I had been wondering when somebody is
going to make some bread,

1101
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,350
like figuring out a terrible though it's
not that bad.

1102
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:36,120
No foods is good.
I like their bread.

1103
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,620
I make egg sandwiches,
no fruits.

1104
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:41,190
I haven't tried out w I haven't tried to
make a lot of good stuff.

1105
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,610
I know they just came out the waffles
that good,

1106
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:47,400
that donuts and stuff like that,
but I think a lot of those things for

1107
00:45:47,401 --> 00:45:49,740
me,
they have way too many carbohydrates for

1108
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:50,940
me.
Way Too many.

1109
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:55,380
But I think isn't there something about
the type of carbs they have fibers in

1110
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:55,500
them?

1111
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,900
Usually they don't raise your blood
level bludge something like that.

1112
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,990
Yeah.
Well I,

1113
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,330
you know,
I don't want to eat regular waffles on a

1114
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:06,420
regular basis,
but if I'm going to cheat and I eat what

1115
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:07,450
they have,
you know,

1116
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:12,490
and they also have a very low sugar
syrup to it tastes very good with some

1117
00:46:13,231 --> 00:46:14,490
butter.
It's just,

1118
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,270
it's the best option if you're going to
do something like that.

1119
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,700
Exactly.
You should mostly eat real foods.

1120
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:24,600
Like I feel better when I eat meat and
vegetables.

1121
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:25,590
That's when I've,
when I'm,

1122
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,720
you know,
I had Jordan Peterson on and he had some

1123
00:46:27,721 --> 00:46:32,340
pretty serious autoimmune disorders and
his body was really in trouble and his

1124
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:36,960
daughter had similar problems and his
daughter went to essentially a diet of

1125
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:41,790
just meat and Greens and now I think
she's not a carnivore diet and she's got

1126
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:43,560
a instagram page to documenting it.

1127
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:47,910
But he went to meet and Greens lost a
shit ton of weight.

1128
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,760
Let was losing,
I think he said he's losing,

1129
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:52,200
what did he say?
Like seven pounds a month for something

1130
00:46:52,201 --> 00:46:56,790
like something along those lines.
Lots of ton of weight and looks great.

1131
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:59,040
He said he's thinner than he's been at
25 years.

1132
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,260
It feels great.
All is autoimmune issues.

1133
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:03,840
We're done.
I think a lot of what people are dealing

1134
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:08,130
with is inflammation that's caused by
too much processed carbohydrates,

1135
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:12,540
too much simple refined carbohydrates
and sugars and the inflammation leads to

1136
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:15,210
disease.
So if you look at what they call the

1137
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:18,990
five scourges of health,
they are a obesity,

1138
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,090
cancer,
cognitive decline,

1139
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,850
heart disease and diabetes.
Those are all metabolic.

1140
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:27,960
Those are all things that we get through
food and over half the people that are

1141
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:30,010
in the hospital today,
right now

1142
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,010
in the United States are in there for
metabolic issues.

1143
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,900
So that's crazy.
It's crazy.

1144
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,420
Most of the,
so more than half of the people that are

1145
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,310
in the hospital are there because of
what they ate.

1146
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,040
It is crazy.
And then you see a direct correlation

1147
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:44,830
between the amount of refined sugars and
carbohydrates.

1148
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:49,510
Human beings have adjusted and started
eating to the rise in diabetes and heart

1149
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:52,210
disease and all these other issues.
And you know the,

1150
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:54,340
one of the things we were talking about
before the podcast is,

1151
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,470
sorry,
I went running today.

1152
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:57,850
If for some reason I can't stop
coughing,

1153
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:03,570
people are dealing with a lot of various
health issues and they're always trying

1154
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:10,390
to pin like one cause of these health
issues.

1155
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:14,920
And one of the real problems is when
people develop these ideological

1156
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:17,080
answers,
like veganism is one of them.

1157
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:21,520
They do not want to thank that there's
anything healthy about meat and that

1158
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,570
what they do is the only way,
and this is the way,

1159
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,980
and like I'm watching this,
there's a thread right now going on on

1160
00:48:26,981 --> 00:48:29,350
twitter between some cockamamie Vegan
doctor.

1161
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:33,700
He's full of Shit and all these people
that are s citing science and and he is

1162
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:36,850
getting pissed off and he's showing his
degree and photos of his degree.

1163
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,930
They're like,
look motherfucker,

1164
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:42,160
this is real science to the fact that
dietary cholesterol is necessary.

1165
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,880
It's the building blocks for cells.
I mean it literally is.

1166
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:46,870
It's the,
the,

1167
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,730
it's the reason why your body is
converting it to,

1168
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,910
to all the sex hormones,
cholesterol,

1169
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,210
saturated fat,
your body processes that it's healthy

1170
00:48:58,211 --> 00:48:59,980
for your brain.
It's healthy for your heart.

1171
00:48:59,981 --> 00:49:03,820
All these things are a fact.
He's not recognizing the fact that their

1172
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:08,560
issue is not saturated fat.
It's saturated fat in conjunction with

1173
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:10,810
all these other things.
And that's a problem with these studies.

1174
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:15,070
Like one of the studies they did
recently where they showed that people

1175
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:17,080
who ate meat more than five times a
week,

1176
00:49:17,081 --> 00:49:18,670
we're much more likely to have heart
disease.

1177
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:21,250
But that's not a good study because they
didn't say,

1178
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:23,800
what are they eating the meat with?
What are you eating?

1179
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,630
Are you eating it with Brett?
Are you eating it in a,

1180
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,770
in a,
in the same as a burger?

1181
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,360
Are you drinking a soda with it?
Right?

1182
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:35,740
Like this is not a good study.
A good study would be have someone you

1183
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:37,360
know,
get a large group of people,

1184
00:49:37,361 --> 00:49:39,700
put them on a carnivore diet,
have a large group of people put 'em on

1185
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:41,380
a Keto Diet,
have a large group of people,

1186
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:45,820
put it on a standard American diet.
Let 'em eat burgers and fries and

1187
00:49:45,821 --> 00:49:47,470
chocolate shakes and sodas and let's,
let's,

1188
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,170
let's find out what the fuck it is.
Put people on a Vegan Diet.

1189
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,070
I have had tons of friends,
including Sam Harris who was on a Vegan

1190
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:56,560
diet and his fucking blood sugar was off
the charts.

1191
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:57,040
He had to try.

1192
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,960
It was trying to figure out how to stay
healthy.

1193
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,690
Like he tried,
he tried it for a long time,

1194
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:04,750
but he felt like shit.
And then he went and switched to fish

1195
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,090
and he felt like shit just doing that
too.

1196
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:10,210
And then he went back to me.
Now he's helping to answer the answer

1197
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:13,090
always seems to come back to being in
the middle somewhere,

1198
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:15,910
right?
Like somewhere we veer off so far and

1199
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:16,571
we're like,
oh man,

1200
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:21,040
we got to retos and we got cookies and
we got all this stuff being thrown at us

1201
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:24,310
every single day and it's convenient.
And then someone will say,

1202
00:50:24,311 --> 00:50:26,500
okay,
you don't know more carbs and you just

1203
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:27,860
go the complete route

1204
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,380
and you end up with something like a
carnivore diet.

1205
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:33,860
But I think just if you're just sit
there and think about stuff logically,

1206
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,530
it would make sense to me that you can
overdo it on me.

1207
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,450
Like I think you can overdo it on just
about anything.

1208
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,050
Yeah.
I,

1209
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:42,920
that's why I lean towards balance and
that's why I like vegetables,

1210
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,380
but I can't talk you guys into that.
Yeah,

1211
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:47,150
I think your balance is probably a,
it's probably ideal,

1212
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:48,140
but uh,
you know,

1213
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:51,440
the balance of the average American's
not great because I think they think

1214
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:53,540
they can just grab and reach for
anything.

1215
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:55,090
That's their level of balance.
Well,

1216
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,650
I think the average American is just
trying to feed themselves.

1217
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,550
You know what,
I'm just trying to,

1218
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,220
they're hungry and they're tired.
And look,

1219
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,470
there's a great top,
uh,

1220
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,820
Henry thoreau quote that most men live
lives of quiet desperation.

1221
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:10,400
And I think that applies to so many
different things.

1222
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,970
And one of them is work.
Most people are fucking working all day

1223
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:16,910
and they're sad and they feel like shit.
And when you get out of there,

1224
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:18,710
you're like,
fucking Wendy's drive through.

1225
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,890
Come on baby.
Hit me up with one of them fucking

1226
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:23,810
double cheeseburgers.
Chocolate shake,

1227
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:24,790
please.
Woo.

1228
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,880
They get a little reward and you know,
and then they feel even more shitty and

1229
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:31,430
then they crash and they get up and they
do it all over again with a fucking egg

1230
00:51:31,431 --> 00:51:34,550
mcmuffin and a cup of coffee with three
scoops of sugar in it.

1231
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:37,010
And this is the,
this is the rollercoaster that most

1232
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,320
people are on.
And it all started with them going to

1233
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:43,160
bed too late because they stayed around
and fuck around on their phone or watch

1234
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:45,230
TV.
I went to bed too late.

1235
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:48,260
They woke up later than they wanted.
They're tired because they didn't get to

1236
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:50,270
sleep.
They were supposed to get drank the

1237
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:51,081
coffee.
Right.

1238
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:54,470
And it's just,
it's this one thing snowballing after

1239
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:55,700
another.
Now what are you guys doing in this

1240
00:51:55,701 --> 00:51:57,440
documentary?
Like what are you trying to document?

1241
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:02,300
We're basically just going around
interviewing people that are sort of in

1242
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:03,020
the know,
you know,

1243
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,070
that are writing these books like Mark
Sisson,

1244
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:06,890
Robb Wolf,
those are some of the people that we

1245
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,080
interviewed.
And just asking them,

1246
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,930
you know,
basic questions about diet and nutrition

1247
00:52:11,931 --> 00:52:13,800
and sort of seeing what,
uh,

1248
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,890
where they stand.
And then,

1249
00:52:15,891 --> 00:52:16,581
um,
we're,

1250
00:52:16,581 --> 00:52:19,520
we SORTA,
we shot about 15 interviews right now

1251
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:22,040
and then it's my job to sort of figure
out like,

1252
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,080
well how does this all correlate
together?

1253
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,260
You know,
so we,

1254
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:28,760
we don't really have,
I'd say it'd be disingenuous for me to

1255
00:52:28,761 --> 00:52:31,220
come on and say,
this is exactly what we're going to do

1256
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,690
because I have no idea what it's going
to be.

1257
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:34,970
And I think that's the beauty of it.
When we shot bigger,

1258
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:35,840
stronger,
faster,

1259
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,300
I had no clue how that was going to turn
out.

1260
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:40,370
And I think a lot of documentary
filmmakers,

1261
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:42,980
they'd go in with like,
here's the point I'm going to prove,

1262
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,720
right,
let me find all the people and string

1263
00:52:44,721 --> 00:52:47,420
them along and then figuring out how
they fit into the puzzle.

1264
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,430
And if they don't conveniently fit in on
my puzzle,

1265
00:52:49,431 --> 00:52:51,710
they're out.
And I just,

1266
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:52,760
I don't know,
I,

1267
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,660
I developed a different way of doing it.
I just like to try to get as much

1268
00:52:56,661 --> 00:53:00,020
information as I can and then think
about it a lot and then put it in a way

1269
00:53:00,021 --> 00:53:03,590
that makes sense to me.
So you're basically doing the opposite

1270
00:53:03,591 --> 00:53:06,490
of a lot of these propaganda films.
Like this is one of the problems that,

1271
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,950
and a lot of people that have had heart
disease or all these various issues,

1272
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:13,490
they paid attention to some of these
propaganda films.

1273
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:16,370
So there's a couple of Vegan ones that
are out there right now.

1274
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:21,371
What the health that's been widely
dismissed by scientists and the

1275
00:53:22,471 --> 00:53:25,680
integration experts.
And I would love to interview him or any

1276
00:53:25,681 --> 00:53:26,250
of the doctors

1277
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,410
that are involved in that because you
know,

1278
00:53:28,411 --> 00:53:30,180
why not let them see it,
let them,

1279
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:35,040
let them speak their mind and let's hear
what they have to say and then let's

1280
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,630
talk about it.
You know?

1281
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:39,060
And I think that's,
that's another interesting thing because

1282
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:42,210
the other thing I also feel is like the
guy that made what?

1283
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:45,540
The health,
I just feel like he has good intentions

1284
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:46,400
also.
Yes.

1285
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,850
Right.
I mean he's not trying to like kill

1286
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:49,860
people,
kill people.

1287
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:53,010
He's trying to help people just like,
I'm trying to help people.

1288
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:57,510
So he's over here going like this guy is
trying to help people eat and meet.

1289
00:53:57,511 --> 00:54:00,030
He's crazy.
The problem is I'm not doing that to

1290
00:54:00,031 --> 00:54:02,250
him.
I think like there is a lot of benefits

1291
00:54:02,251 --> 00:54:04,290
to a Vegan Diet.
There are a lot of people that could

1292
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,630
benefit from it.
Can everybody benefit from it?

1293
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,120
I don't know.
There's a lot of things missing also.

1294
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,160
So I,
I definitely questioned it,

1295
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:14,550
but I don't shit all over it.
I don't think that's the way to help

1296
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:17,820
people that way to help people as a sort
of bring them together and figure out

1297
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:18,530
what

1298
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:19,730
rare that people do it.
Right.

1299
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:21,860
And I think if you do it right and you
have,

1300
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:22,790
uh,
you know,

1301
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,060
some sort of b12 12 supplements,
whether it is a,

1302
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:26,811
you know,
from,

1303
00:54:26,811 --> 00:54:27,800
um,
like,

1304
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,060
uh,
Greens,

1305
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:29,894
like,
um,

1306
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:31,340
what do they use a,
the,

1307
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,920
what's that
algae,

1308
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,060
Maria?
The algae stuff.

1309
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,150
There's dominic d'agostino uses right
now.

1310
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,540
There's a lot of that stuff that you
can,

1311
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:42,110
you can get your b vitamins from and,
and if they're not opposed,

1312
00:54:42,111 --> 00:54:43,090
I mean the,
well,

1313
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,800
some of the simplest organisms on the
planet are mollusks,

1314
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:48,410
you know,
and I know that people think of them as

1315
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:51,050
animal life,
but they're more primitive than plants.

1316
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:54,050
I mean there's,
there's certain clams and Molec seen

1317
00:54:54,051 --> 00:54:56,720
things like they don't,
they don't feel fucking shit.

1318
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,110
They're not suffering.
They literally don't have the capacity

1319
00:55:00,111 --> 00:55:02,270
for pain.
And they're one of the more primitive

1320
00:55:02,271 --> 00:55:03,170
life forms on earth.

1321
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,450
I mean,
we deviated from them 600 million years

1322
00:55:05,451 --> 00:55:08,150
ago or something like that,
but they're barely an animal.

1323
00:55:08,151 --> 00:55:10,070
We can call them an animal.
There are some.

1324
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:13,190
But see what we say is because they
move,

1325
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:15,860
you know,
because the clam closes its mouth.

1326
00:55:15,861 --> 00:55:17,570
We've decided that that's a living
thing.

1327
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:18,770
It's move to,
I mean,

1328
00:55:18,771 --> 00:55:21,310
do you have to plant that aids the rats?
Yeah.

1329
00:55:21,311 --> 00:55:22,340
That,
that thing's awesome.

1330
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,090
Or Venus fly traps.
Yes.

1331
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,020
And the thing is,
plants are far more complex and their

1332
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:30,290
ability to communicate and their ability
to even express predation,

1333
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,310
pain and protect themselves through
various chemical,

1334
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,320
uh,
means to protect themselves from

1335
00:55:36,321 --> 00:55:39,080
predation.
They changed the way they taste to keep

1336
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:42,110
from getting eaten.
And there's been studies also that you

1337
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:46,190
just play the sound of a caterpillar
eating leaves next to plants.

1338
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:49,850
They recognize that sound and they
changed their taste profile,

1339
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:50,970
which is just fucked.

1340
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:52,000
Great.
And those are,

1341
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:55,540
those are chemicals like Lectins,
things like lectins and stuff that,

1342
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:57,490
um,
it can be very damaging to people.

1343
00:55:57,491 --> 00:55:58,690
A lot of people don't know,
but if he,

1344
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,700
you know,
cucumbers and tomatoes and stuff like

1345
00:56:00,701 --> 00:56:02,230
that,
you're getting a lot of these lectins

1346
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:06,190
that a lot of people are,
they have adverse reactions to.

1347
00:56:06,191 --> 00:56:08,950
So a lot of people be eating,
you know,

1348
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,400
a variety of vegetables in our diet and
not understand why they still don't feel

1349
00:56:12,401 --> 00:56:13,240
good.
Uh,

1350
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,430
they need to look into that.
They might have a lectin issue,

1351
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:15,730
you know?

1352
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:16,191
Yeah.
It's,

1353
00:56:16,191 --> 00:56:18,920
it's entirely possible.
So a lot of people,

1354
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:20,410
let me start it.
This film,

1355
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,060
you know,
we were going to call it the war on

1356
00:56:22,061 --> 00:56:23,260
carbs.
That's what were,

1357
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,070
that's what we were talking

1358
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:24,903
about.
And that's,

1359
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,970
that's what we've been talking about for
quite a long time.

1360
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:29,950
But as we started to go through the
movie,

1361
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,521
we were like,
Oh,

1362
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:31,750
I dunno,
war on carbs.

1363
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:35,560
Like maybe that's going to isolate.
And that's gonna a pigeon holed a movie

1364
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:38,590
into one style.
But as we started interviewing more and

1365
00:56:38,591 --> 00:56:41,350
more people,
we realized that the problem is carbs.

1366
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:46,030
It's a problem,
a war on refined carbs and vegetables,

1367
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:47,350
oils and sugars,
you know,

1368
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,360
sugar,
which is a refined,

1369
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:49,840
you say cars.
We're talking about pizza,

1370
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:53,250
basically an ice cream and all the,
all the excess things that people are

1371
00:56:53,251 --> 00:56:55,090
using.
We're not really tough oils,

1372
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:57,100
refined carbohydrates,
refined sugars,

1373
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,080
and these are all product to the modern
world,

1374
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:03,460
modern industrialized world.
And they call it production western.

1375
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:04,690
They call the uh,
diseases,

1376
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:09,691
western diseases because they didn't
used to have these diseases on that

1377
00:57:10,151 --> 00:57:11,320
level in other countries.

1378
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,820
And then when we started exporting
molasses and we started exporting rice

1379
00:57:15,821 --> 00:57:18,370
and everything else,
we were exporting to these other

1380
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:20,650
countries that didn't have it.
They all got sick,

1381
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,030
they all started getting sick.
You know,

1382
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:24,160
they all started,
their obesity rates went up,

1383
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:26,370
their diabetes rates went up.
And that's,

1384
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,140
that's just proof right there that if
you eat that stuff,

1385
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:30,940
you know,
it will have those consequences.

1386
00:57:30,941 --> 00:57:31,570
Well,
one of the,

1387
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:33,900
one of the great ways,
um,

1388
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,980
I've seen someone talk about,
I forget who it was,

1389
00:57:35,981 --> 00:57:37,090
it was discussing this.
There were saying,

1390
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:40,120
look at humans teeth.
People did not suffer from the type of

1391
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:43,050
tooth decay they suffered from.
Now what does that from what's from

1392
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:45,670
refined carbohydrates and sugar?
That's what it is.

1393
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:49,150
And especially sugary drinks,
like people were constantly drinking

1394
00:57:49,151 --> 00:57:50,140
soda.
I mean,

1395
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:52,090
you are just fucking torturing your
teeth.

1396
00:57:52,091 --> 00:57:54,150
You're just throwing acid on your teeth
all day.

1397
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,710
I can't believe I used to eat all that
stuff.

1398
00:57:56,711 --> 00:57:58,240
When I look back,
know man,

1399
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,280
I used to eat all that and look forward
to it too.

1400
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:01,114
Right.
And I,

1401
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:04,240
I guess I thought I felt okay,
but I really didn't.

1402
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:05,171
You know,
I,

1403
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:06,700
but I like thinking back on it,
I'm like,

1404
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:09,820
I feel way better now.
But back then I thought I was okay.

1405
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:12,100
I thought I was doing a good job.
You didn't know any better.

1406
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,160
I mean,
even doing a low carb ketogenic diet,

1407
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:16,810
I was still eating a ton of vegetable
oil,

1408
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,711
you know,
and stuff like that.

1409
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:18,730
And that's just,
it was

1410
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,790
just like I,
okay.

1411
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,380
Chicken wings,
they don't have carbs in them,

1412
00:58:23,381 --> 00:58:24,540
but they're deep fried.
Right.

1413
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,390
It's terrible.
So reading that.

1414
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:26,790
Yeah,
it's,

1415
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:27,910
I mean,
just stuff like that.

1416
00:58:27,911 --> 00:58:30,960
I'd say you still have in your diet and
not know about.

1417
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,330
I used to have,
um,

1418
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,540
I was doing a low carb diet,
so I figured,

1419
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:37,330
okay,
I'll make a big salad and I'll dump this

1420
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:40,300
dressing all over it and addressing full
soybean oil,

1421
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:41,850
stuff like that.
You know,

1422
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,020
I'm thinking about it.
Yeah.

1423
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:46,420
Yeah.
So when you set out to do this,

1424
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:49,730
what was the motivation just because
you're on the health benefits that you

1425
00:58:49,731 --> 00:58:52,480
found from adjusting your own diet?
I think just,

1426
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:54,340
yeah,
I mean I just like to help people,

1427
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,110
you know,
I like to make films that can help

1428
00:58:56,111 --> 00:58:59,440
people find their way,
find what's good for them or what works

1429
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:01,810
for them and um,
you know,

1430
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:04,600
they can take it or leave it.
I think this falls in the category of

1431
00:59:04,601 --> 00:59:09,220
addiction too because the place that he
came from where he was addicted to drugs

1432
00:59:09,221 --> 00:59:10,760
and alcohol,
um,

1433
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:12,760
and he was able to overcome a lot of
that.

1434
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:15,220
I think the Ketogenic Diet,
I think without it,

1435
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:17,060
I think it would have been a lot harder
now.

1436
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:17,970
I mean,
I think,

1437
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:20,610
yeah,
I think the ketogenic diet played into

1438
00:59:20,611 --> 00:59:21,740
it.
And I think the reason

1439
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:22,880
why,
why did it,

1440
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,210
I did a ketogenic diet in Rehab.
So when I got to Rehab,

1441
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:27,530
I was like,
I'm not eating carbs.

1442
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,520
Like that's it.
So why,

1443
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:29,910
why did that help you?
Um,

1444
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,600
it helps with your cognitive function.
It helps you to,

1445
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:33,850
um,
it does,

1446
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,060
it helps your brain,
you know,

1447
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:37,430
helps your brain work better habits.
And so,

1448
00:59:37,431 --> 00:59:38,420
um,
when I,

1449
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,070
when I went to Rehab,
you know,

1450
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:43,250
it was about 245 pounds and I came out
at like two 15,

1451
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:45,290
uh,
from doing a kito diet and I started

1452
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:48,380
training again a little bit,
but I was still very sick and I was

1453
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:49,101
very,
like,

1454
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:50,780
I was,
I was messed up at that time.

1455
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,870
Like I wasn't right mentally or
physically,

1456
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:55,010
I was just broken,
you know,

1457
00:59:55,011 --> 00:59:57,170
and I was ready for a change.
And so,

1458
00:59:57,171 --> 00:59:58,370
um,
you know,

1459
00:59:58,371 --> 00:59:59,480
it was,
it was very humbling,

1460
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,190
you know,
it's still is actually to even talk

1461
01:00:01,191 --> 01:00:01,520
about it.

1462
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,660
So,
um,

1463
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,330
getting knocked down a little bit helped
me.

1464
01:00:05,331 --> 01:00:08,180
Um,
it also helped me to start back over and

1465
01:00:08,181 --> 01:00:09,440
start back over with,
uh,

1466
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:11,420
with a better head on my shoulders.
You know,

1467
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:13,250
cause I used to think I knew everything
right.

1468
01:00:13,251 --> 01:00:15,920
And now I think I know nothing.
And I think that that's important

1469
01:00:15,921 --> 01:00:19,280
because I have this white belt mentality
now that I use on everything and

1470
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:23,300
actually got that from talking to from
Fabrizio verdon cause like he was always

1471
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:24,890
learning,
always thinking I'm always learning.

1472
01:00:24,891 --> 01:00:26,600
Right.
And so I asked him one time,

1473
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,010
I was talking about Simon,
he said,

1474
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:28,551
he said,
yeah,

1475
01:00:28,551 --> 01:00:30,710
I'm a white belt mentality towards
everything.

1476
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,330
And I think I've heard you talk about
that as well.

1477
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,690
And um,
I think that's important though because

1478
01:00:35,691 --> 01:00:38,600
we think we know everything.
We start preaching all this stuff and

1479
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,430
then I turned around and go,
wow,

1480
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:41,900
I really don't know what I'm talking
about.

1481
01:00:41,901 --> 01:00:44,360
A lot of times I really better think
about what I say more.

1482
01:00:44,361 --> 01:00:47,840
And even now I'm just a lot more careful
about making absolute statements.

1483
01:00:47,841 --> 01:00:50,450
I don't make any more absolute
statements or things like that because

1484
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,860
you want to be sure that you're
conveying the right information to

1485
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:53,490
people.

1486
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:55,320
What were you saying before the podcast
started?

1487
01:00:55,321 --> 01:00:57,180
You were,
we're going to bring it up again about

1488
01:00:57,181 --> 01:00:58,760
veganism coming from a religion.
Yeah.

1489
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:00,360
Yeah.
Veganism started,

1490
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,870
um,
with the seventh adventist church I

1491
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,980
believe.
So there was,

1492
01:01:04,981 --> 01:01:05,630
um,
uh,

1493
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:08,910
you know,
a group of people that had a church and

1494
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,720
the guy that led the church as part of
the church was like,

1495
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,300
you know,
they were following the Jewish kosher

1496
01:01:15,301 --> 01:01:19,170
laws or whatever at first and it was
like no pigs or whatever else.

1497
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:20,280
Shellfish,
I think.

1498
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,630
Yeah,
no pigs or shellfish.

1499
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:25,350
And then the guy just said and like it
just sort of took it to a next level and

1500
01:01:25,351 --> 01:01:25,710
said,
and like,

1501
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:26,550
no,
no meat,

1502
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:29,430
no animal products at all.
And so these people that were in this

1503
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:32,700
church where like the first real group
of Vegans,

1504
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,460
a church,
I've seventh adventist I think is what

1505
01:01:35,461 --> 01:01:36,750
it's called,
is where it came from.

1506
01:01:36,751 --> 01:01:40,260
Like 1863 is when that like movement,
I guess started it.

1507
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:41,040
But like,
sure,

1508
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:41,820
I'd started early.

1509
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,130
I'm sure people were doing it earlier
than that obviously.

1510
01:01:44,131 --> 01:01:46,350
But I think that that's where the,
the roots came in.

1511
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,410
And I just find that really interesting
because it does,

1512
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:50,790
you know,
it does seem like a religion.

1513
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:51,800
It seems like,
um,

1514
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,570
today it seems like a lot of times you
get,

1515
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,220
um,
I get called out a lot on,

1516
01:01:57,221 --> 01:02:00,270
on instagram and stuff like that from
people that are Vegan saying like,

1517
01:02:00,271 --> 01:02:01,770
I can't believe you'd do this and Bob
by,

1518
01:02:01,771 --> 01:02:04,200
but I would never go on their page and
say anything to them at all.

1519
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,630
Well,
so proselytizing,

1520
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,500
that's a big part of this whole
community is it's,

1521
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:11,630
there's the moral high ground they stand
on it.

1522
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,510
And then a lot of these people,
especially people with Vegan in their

1523
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:18,030
name and their screen name,
they always go after people and they,

1524
01:02:18,031 --> 01:02:20,910
you know,
they try to shame people and what

1525
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:23,220
they're doing is in,
uh,

1526
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,520
in many ways is a very good thing.
They're not participating in factory

1527
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:27,420
farming.
Right.

1528
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:30,870
They're not participating in the Harz
that we see in these fucking peta videos

1529
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:35,310
where you see cows and pigs and chickens
are just being tortured.

1530
01:02:35,311 --> 01:02:37,770
All that fuck,
that is disgusting and that should be

1531
01:02:37,771 --> 01:02:40,020
eliminated and shouldn't be a part of
modern culture.

1532
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:44,880
But in terms of like the humane raising
and killing of animals,

1533
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:47,520
look,
they're not going to live forever and I

1534
01:02:47,521 --> 01:02:50,220
don't care what you say.
I'm not into animal suffering.

1535
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,800
I don't think they should suffer,
but if you try to say the people are not

1536
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:55,440
herbivores or that people are herbivores
rather,

1537
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,300
and then we're not omnivores,
you're crazy.

1538
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,830
It's just not true.
It's not fact,

1539
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:02,160
and they show picture.
These are not the teeth of a carnivore.

1540
01:03:02,161 --> 01:03:04,290
These are the two that were,
we're not carnivores stupid.

1541
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,690
We're omnivores.
A chimpanzee.

1542
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:07,640
Yeah,
we,

1543
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,860
we look real similar and our teeth to
fucking chimps.

1544
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:15,870
Chimps are omnivores and the human diet
is a very complex thing.

1545
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:18,510
When you attach that human diet to
ideology,

1546
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:21,060
then it gets really screwy because
you're not dealing,

1547
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:25,470
you're not dealing with people that are
being honest about dietary,

1548
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:29,520
like what is really important and as far
as dietary requirements,

1549
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,310
how your body functions,
what the studies show,

1550
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,010
if you look at it objectively,
the objective,

1551
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,310
the first thing anybody should say first
thing across the board,

1552
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:39,660
Garrett,
all the fucking sugar.

1553
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:41,760
That's number one.
Get rid of all the refined

1554
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:44,250
carbohydrates.
Eat more vegetables.

1555
01:03:44,251 --> 01:03:46,860
I think you guys don't eat more
vegetables.

1556
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:48,120
Eat healthy fats.

1557
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:53,100
Get some formal omega fatty acids.
Recognize that the omega fatty fatty

1558
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:58,101
acids that you get from flax seed oil or
not as bioavailable is fact from studies

1559
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:02,010
not as bioavailable.
Is it mega fatty acids you get from fish

1560
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:04,200
and meat,
they're just not the meat.

1561
01:04:04,201 --> 01:04:05,160
The protein.
Well,

1562
01:04:05,161 --> 01:04:08,880
Broccoli has 15 groups.
It's not as bioavailable.

1563
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:10,980
You fucks and you know it's not.
It's just not.

1564
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:15,720
So you can get bioavailable protein from
plants.

1565
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,880
You get it from hemp,
you get it from [inaudible],

1566
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:20,310
you get it from peas.
Pea protein is very good,

1567
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:24,570
but it's not as good as the,
the protein that you get from meat.

1568
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,430
It's just not,
can it sustain you?

1569
01:04:26,431 --> 01:04:29,050
Yes it can.
Can you be a healthy person and live a

1570
01:04:29,051 --> 01:04:31,980
fucking balanced life on a completely
vegetarian diet?

1571
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:36,450
100% but I would always recommend eat
free range eggs.

1572
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:37,740
You're not hurting a chicken.

1573
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,810
Nothing gets hurt.
It is free food.

1574
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,070
We have,
I have chickens.

1575
01:04:41,071 --> 01:04:42,720
They roam around,
they eat vegetables,

1576
01:04:42,721 --> 01:04:45,270
nobody eats them.
The chickens live a fucking healthy

1577
01:04:45,271 --> 01:04:46,170
life.
They lay eggs,

1578
01:04:46,171 --> 01:04:49,350
we eat the eggs,
the eggs are healthy as fuck ethos.

1579
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:53,280
Find a place that has free range.
Chickens eat the eggs.

1580
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,720
It's,
I mean it's not Vegan,

1581
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:57,240
but it is vegetarian.
If you want to get rid of dairy and you

1582
01:04:57,241 --> 01:04:58,650
don't want,
I get it man.

1583
01:04:58,651 --> 01:05:01,080
I've seen gary dairy farms.
It's fucked up.

1584
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,700
You see what they're doing at cows and
they,

1585
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:06,540
you know what the way they treat them
and the way they're raised them and just

1586
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:09,720
the whole idea behind it.
Like making them lactate.

1587
01:05:09,721 --> 01:05:10,590
The only time,
but cows.

1588
01:05:10,591 --> 01:05:12,330
Lactate is when they have a baby,
right?

1589
01:05:12,331 --> 01:05:14,280
So they keep them in this state and it's
just,

1590
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:18,940
it's unnatural.
And that is a reality of dairy

1591
01:05:18,941 --> 01:05:19,600
production.

1592
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,010
And if you don't want to be a part of
that,

1593
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:25,420
that's a hundred percent noble.
But we have to be honest about nutrition

1594
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,930
requirements,
not about the ideology of veganism.

1595
01:05:28,931 --> 01:05:30,370
And this is the problem with these
people.

1596
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,670
And so many of them,
especially the ones with Vegan attached

1597
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:36,300
to their identity,
because they use the name like v I'm,

1598
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:39,460
I'm Vegan warrior,
this is Vegan prints and the Vegan

1599
01:05:39,461 --> 01:05:42,070
defender,
they're fucking morons who joined a

1600
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:44,170
gang.
And what they do is they start eating

1601
01:05:44,171 --> 01:05:45,640
plants,
they start talking shit,

1602
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:49,600
and they go looking to just go after
anybody who's not on the same page as

1603
01:05:49,601 --> 01:05:51,820
them.
And the real problem is people that

1604
01:05:51,821 --> 01:05:54,110
watch a movie,
like what the health or something,

1605
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:56,080
and then think,
well that this is,

1606
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,200
oh my God,
I'm killing myself by not being a Vegan.

1607
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,840
Nope,
you need to google what the health

1608
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:05,650
debunked and find out the actual science
because what they're talking about is

1609
01:06:05,651 --> 01:06:06,460
bullshit.

1610
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,820
They're not being honest.
What they've done is make a Vegan

1611
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:12,850
proselytizing movie.
They're trying to get people to join in

1612
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:15,850
because that's what they do and a lot of
these people,

1613
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,820
but they give up a lot of these people
to get to a point where their health

1614
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:20,680
can't take it anymore and you fucking
give up.

1615
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,840
Chris Kresser is a perfect example.
I don't know,

1616
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,970
have you interviewed him for a film?
Not yet,

1617
01:06:24,971 --> 01:06:26,350
but we will.
He's fucking brilliant.

1618
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,170
And he was a macro,
but he was a macrobiotic Vegan.

1619
01:06:29,171 --> 01:06:32,980
I mean this guy was all off the charts
with veganism and eventually realize his

1620
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:34,600
body was falling apart and gave up on
it.

1621
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:39,100
There's some people that owned that
restaurant in California and Hollywood.

1622
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:42,070
What is it called?
The something cafe.

1623
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,120
Gratitude.
Thank you,

1624
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,140
Kathy.
Gratitude.

1625
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,401
Yeah.
Yeah.

1626
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:46,630
These people were,
I mean,

1627
01:06:46,631 --> 01:06:47,920
they're fucking health was falling
apart,

1628
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:51,670
so they decided to raise their own
cattle and ether on meat and vegans

1629
01:06:51,671 --> 01:06:55,360
found out they got death threats and
people were fucking going after them.

1630
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,193
Yes,
ma'am.

1631
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:57,910
It was a terrifying thing for these
people.

1632
01:06:57,911 --> 01:06:59,710
They're all our folks and they,
they,

1633
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,160
they have their own farm and they were
raising their own farm animals and they

1634
01:07:03,161 --> 01:07:05,710
decided to start eating them.
And when they made these posts about

1635
01:07:05,711 --> 01:07:07,720
starting these people went after them.
Man.

1636
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:08,853
You know,
it's not,

1637
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:11,350
this is not kindness.
And you know,

1638
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:15,310
this is not someone who's compassionate.
He's a fucking cunt,

1639
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:18,100
better in a gang and that they're in the
plant gang.

1640
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,390
You know,
and if you talk,

1641
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:22,450
and I'm sure you've seen it by doing
this carnivore diet thing,

1642
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:25,390
if you do anything that's outside of
that,

1643
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:26,380
they go after you.

1644
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:28,320
Yeah.
Start jumping down throat just so

1645
01:07:28,321 --> 01:07:30,630
everybody knows you.
You keep mentioning,

1646
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:31,590
ah,
you're not going to talk.

1647
01:07:31,591 --> 01:07:33,120
I sit in a like in vegetables or
whatever.

1648
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,530
Uh,
I,

1649
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:37,350
I do eat vegetables.
I casually,

1650
01:07:37,351 --> 01:07:41,730
if you have to find the way,
Mike Kenogenic diet before I went on the

1651
01:07:41,731 --> 01:07:44,980
carnivore diet was mainly a vegetarian
diet.

1652
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:47,130
Like mostly vegetables.
I would eat a lot of vegetables,

1653
01:07:47,131 --> 01:07:50,070
big salads and all this stuff.
And I throw a little bit of meat in

1654
01:07:50,071 --> 01:07:52,590
because I was very concerned about
eating too much protein.

1655
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:55,560
So I'd only eat 80 to 100 grams of
protein a day.

1656
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:59,670
Now I eat double that.
And so that's sort of what the switch

1657
01:07:59,671 --> 01:08:01,800
was and it's just an intervention for
now.

1658
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:03,120
Um,
I feel it.

1659
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,360
I feel that,
I used to think that the best healthiest

1660
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:10,680
diet for a human being would be a Vegan
diet with like three or four ounces of

1661
01:08:10,681 --> 01:08:12,630
meat thrown in it at every meal.

1662
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:14,310
You know,
just to have the animal fat and animal

1663
01:08:14,311 --> 01:08:16,430
protein.
I like that would be really smart.

1664
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:20,300
Now I'm starting to think the opposite.
I think front loading your body with the

1665
01:08:20,301 --> 01:08:23,810
nutrients that it needs because our
body's always in search for nutrients.

1666
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,480
That's why we're hungry.
We're always searching for the nutrients

1667
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:28,820
that we need,
the vitamins and minerals that we need

1668
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:32,600
and all the macro nutrients we need.
If we front load at first and give us a,

1669
01:08:32,601 --> 01:08:33,201
you know,
a chunk,

1670
01:08:33,201 --> 01:08:36,680
a nice steak,
you're body's not hungry afterwards.

1671
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:38,120
And I think that's what's happened to
me,

1672
01:08:38,121 --> 01:08:42,320
where now I'm sort of giving my body
what it needs and it never,

1673
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:44,420
it's never asking for what it doesn't
need.

1674
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:48,610
I saw a comment the other day and one of
those animal videos when those horrible

1675
01:08:48,611 --> 01:08:51,310
factory farming videos said,
because of this video,

1676
01:08:51,311 --> 01:08:56,311
I'm 60% vegan now with my diet.
What exactly,

1677
01:08:56,710 --> 01:08:59,980
what the fuck does that mean?
But that's the type of morons we're

1678
01:08:59,981 --> 01:09:02,140
dealing with here.
People that are not looking at

1679
01:09:02,141 --> 01:09:04,180
themselves or anything,
honestly,

1680
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:04,730
they,
they're,

1681
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:07,320
they're trying to stand on the moral
high ground and they've,

1682
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:09,220
if they know the meat,
they can't.

1683
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:10,480
So they say,
well baby,

1684
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,280
I'm almost all Vegan.
Well,

1685
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:14,570
okay,
well those poor little fucking cows in

1686
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:18,460
murder.
The 40% almost everybody who eats a

1687
01:09:18,461 --> 01:09:21,070
balanced diet,
60% vegan.

1688
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,420
That's riddick.
Exactly.

1689
01:09:22,421 --> 01:09:24,340
I mean that's,
it's a ridiculous thing to say,

1690
01:09:24,341 --> 01:09:28,570
but this is the problem is people,
they're not just eating things,

1691
01:09:28,571 --> 01:09:33,190
they're posturing like outs there.
They're publicly posturing on their

1692
01:09:33,191 --> 01:09:36,010
position on,
on morals and ethics.

1693
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,300
You know,
you see it all the time.

1694
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,550
Yeah.
We see it in every aspect of fitness.

1695
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:40,384
We see it.
Oh yeah.

1696
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,210
You see in all areas.
But I think there's also a difference

1697
01:09:43,211 --> 01:09:44,080
between,
um,

1698
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,450
you know,
survival and there's a difference

1699
01:09:46,451 --> 01:09:47,890
between performance.
And I think,

1700
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,390
you know,
we're asking our bodies,

1701
01:09:49,391 --> 01:09:51,580
all three of us at the table,
we're asking our bodies to do some

1702
01:09:51,581 --> 01:09:54,880
demanding thing.
So I think in that case like maybe we do

1703
01:09:54,881 --> 01:09:57,490
need a little bit more meat,
especially if meat is going to be kind

1704
01:09:57,491 --> 01:10:01,450
of our main driver of our calories.
And it kind of makes sense that we would

1705
01:10:01,451 --> 01:10:04,930
need a little bit more of that than
maybe your average person.

1706
01:10:04,931 --> 01:10:06,670
So what you said about the three ounces
of meat,

1707
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:10,240
every couple meals probably makes sense
and probably be great for survival.

1708
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:13,780
The other thing that's really
interesting though is that even for

1709
01:10:13,781 --> 01:10:16,930
those of us had been trying to seek the
truth and for those of us have been

1710
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:21,040
trying to eat good and trying to train
and it's not like you're like,

1711
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:23,410
oh,
there's Joe Rogan hundred 50 years old.

1712
01:10:23,411 --> 01:10:24,660
Look at that fucking guy.
Yeah.

1713
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:26,620
You know,
we still don't really,

1714
01:10:26,621 --> 01:10:27,550
uh,
you know,

1715
01:10:27,551 --> 01:10:29,320
you're not insuring anything,
right.

1716
01:10:29,321 --> 01:10:30,430
But,
uh,

1717
01:10:30,431 --> 01:10:33,970
you're trying to just live the life that
you want to live the best way possible

1718
01:10:33,971 --> 01:10:35,320
that you can live at.
Yeah.

1719
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,750
If I lived to be 150 those last couple
of years are going to suck effect.

1720
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,170
I last couple.
Well,

1721
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:43,660
I'm mean,
I'm not convinced that people won't in

1722
01:10:43,661 --> 01:10:45,020
our lifetime.
I mean with,

1723
01:10:45,021 --> 01:10:47,410
with science and fucking stem cells,

1724
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,730
they said right now,
if you're born today,

1725
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,220
you have a chance of living to be one oh
four is like that

1726
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,980
one oh four,
I'm going to live to be one of four

1727
01:10:53,981 --> 01:10:56,030
bitch hit by a car.
Yeah.

1728
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:56,700
Asteroids.

1729
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,790
The thing is,
you and I and a lot of their people

1730
01:10:59,791 --> 01:11:01,350
listening,
we started 30,

1731
01:11:01,351 --> 01:11:02,940
40 years in.
You know what I mean?

1732
01:11:02,941 --> 01:11:05,460
We started too late.
I don't know when you started eating

1733
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,080
better,
but I know that it wasn't your whole

1734
01:11:07,081 --> 01:11:07,570
life.

1735
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:08,341
No,
no,

1736
01:11:08,341 --> 01:11:09,550
it wasn't my whole life.
Um,

1737
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:14,190
I was certainly no high refined
carbohydrate up until 10

1738
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,030
years ago.
Yeah.

1739
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,480
I mean I've really got into,
I mean,

1740
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:22,470
I've always been supplementing with
vitamins and I've been getting my blood

1741
01:11:22,471 --> 01:11:27,471
work done for a couple of decades now,
but the real shift was switching to

1742
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:29,700
Quito.
Genic do you know where the shift came

1743
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:30,001
from?
Me?

1744
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:31,290
And you're probably not going to believe
this.

1745
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,370
The shift came from me after going to a
show where I first met you,

1746
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,100
very time we first met.
I don't even know if you remember it.

1747
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:40,080
Uh,
it was outside the Ice House in

1748
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:42,480
Pasadena.
And I came up to you and talk to you

1749
01:11:42,481 --> 01:11:45,840
with Brian Callen and you were talking
about diet and you were saying,

1750
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:48,180
man,
I can't believe that people eat all this

1751
01:11:48,181 --> 01:11:48,781
shit.
And like,

1752
01:11:48,781 --> 01:11:50,680
you know,
you say every town I go to,

1753
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,200
I like,
the first thing I do is look for the

1754
01:11:52,201 --> 01:11:55,320
whole foods and I find the whole foods
and I go get my food.

1755
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:56,790
And I'm thinking like,
man,

1756
01:11:56,791 --> 01:11:59,100
I travel all the time.
If Joe Rogan can do this,

1757
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,570
like,
why am I not doing it?

1758
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,640
You know,
why am I being so lazy with my Diet?

1759
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:04,080
I'm so fat,
like what's going on?

1760
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:07,550
And I that day actually really made me
think about a lot and I,

1761
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:11,400
I saw you as an inspiration after that
day.

1762
01:12:11,401 --> 01:12:13,560
I started really digging into it a lot
more so.

1763
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,510
Well,
I spend a lot of time in hotel.

1764
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:18,420
So what I would do is I would show up at
a place on Thursday and I'd be there til

1765
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:19,171
Sunday,
you know,

1766
01:12:19,171 --> 01:12:20,910
especially when I was doing comedy clubs
on the road.

1767
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,450
So I go to whole foods.
I'd stock up on Kombucha,

1768
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,970
I would get a,
a bunch of healthy snacks,

1769
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,100
a bunch of raw almonds and things along
those lines.

1770
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:31,890
So that way I had something in my hotel
room all the time.

1771
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:34,890
So if I'm writing or you know,
getting done working out or something

1772
01:12:34,891 --> 01:12:36,540
like that,
I'm not eating candy bars.

1773
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:39,510
I'm done rating the hotel minibar and
eat bullshit.

1774
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,400
That makes all the difference in the
world doc.

1775
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:44,250
And that's how I travel now too.
I just have everything ready to go.

1776
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,241
Yeah.
Get a breath.

1777
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:47,280
Bring yourself a big case of bottled
water,

1778
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:48,090
you know,
make,

1779
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:51,210
make sure you got stuff in your room
that can sustain you.

1780
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:52,840
And if it carnivores,
does it bring some,

1781
01:12:52,841 --> 01:12:54,060
uh,
sardines in a can?

1782
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:55,260
Yes,
I do a lot of that.

1783
01:12:55,261 --> 01:12:58,320
I bring sardines.
I bring a oysters,

1784
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:00,440
I bring oysters with me.
You're not going to believe this.

1785
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,870
My first sardine I've ever eaten was
like two days ago.

1786
01:13:03,871 --> 01:13:05,490
Actually.
I just so,

1787
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,750
because you guys talk about it so much
d'agostino we went and visited Dom

1788
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,730
D'agostino and interviewed him.
He just kept talking about these

1789
01:13:11,731 --> 01:13:12,690
sardines,
so I'm like,

1790
01:13:12,691 --> 01:13:13,980
finally I got to try it.

1791
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,670
They taste just like tuna fish.
The great southern.

1792
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,210
Great.
I can't believe you'd never had

1793
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:19,320
sardines.
Awesome.

1794
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,700
They're great.
It sounds gross.

1795
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,010
It they sound gross,
but I had him like about two weeks ago

1796
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:24,410
as well,
maybe maybe a month or two.

1797
01:13:24,411 --> 01:13:25,650
Wild.
The Wild Planet.

1798
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:27,990
Wild Planet.
Olive oil.

1799
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:30,170
Yeah.
They also have macro and a bunch of

1800
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:32,400
other different things that I was used
to.

1801
01:13:32,401 --> 01:13:36,210
The ones that my grandfather get,
we like peel the can down and then it

1802
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:38,280
was like these little little fish in
there.

1803
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,260
Those I love those look too gross to me,
so that's what I remember seeing as

1804
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:44,550
Sardi man,
they're good.

1805
01:13:44,551 --> 01:13:46,530
I like sardines are very healthy for you
as long as,

1806
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,790
well,
one thing though,

1807
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:52,680
I do have to say I was eating a can or
two a day and then I found arsenic in my

1808
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:53,550
blood.
That's right.

1809
01:13:53,551 --> 01:13:54,384
I heard that.
Yeah.

1810
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,750
And then the doctor's like,
just lay off that,

1811
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,010
let's do another test in a month.
And then it was gone.

1812
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:02,010
And so it's just the,
there's a lot of heavy metals in the

1813
01:14:02,011 --> 01:14:04,230
water and they're,
they're low on the,

1814
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,420
uh,
in the,

1815
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:06,660
in the ocean floor.
I mean,

1816
01:14:06,661 --> 01:14:09,390
they're down there with all that shit.
Yeah.

1817
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:10,980
Speaking of fish and stuff like that,
I do,

1818
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:12,100
it's important for people

1819
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,700
to get some Omega threes and if they are
going to try a carnivore diet and a way

1820
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:19,630
to do that as either eat the grass fed
beef or to add in some a salmon.

1821
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,900
So I add in salmon twice a week,
usually just pokey or something like

1822
01:14:22,901 --> 01:14:24,190
that.
Just eat it,

1823
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:25,263
eat it by itself.

1824
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:26,533
Oils.
Uh,

1825
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:28,780
what about just getting some fish oil
and,

1826
01:14:28,781 --> 01:14:29,660
and taking that in.

1827
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,970
Ah,
so I like,

1828
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,300
I like whole foods and I like things in
the whole food environment.

1829
01:14:35,301 --> 01:14:37,550
And the more I do research on things and
look into it,

1830
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,490
the more I realize like the whole foods
are really where it's at.

1831
01:14:40,491 --> 01:14:42,470
So I don't know.
I mean I'm,

1832
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:44,750
I'm,
I'm sure there's a lot of studies on it

1833
01:14:44,751 --> 01:14:46,580
and things like that,
but I just feel like,

1834
01:14:46,581 --> 01:14:49,070
um,
the way that the way that they make fish

1835
01:14:49,071 --> 01:14:51,740
oil and the way that it sits around
forever and stuff like that,

1836
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,140
I don't know.
So I don't use it,

1837
01:14:54,141 --> 01:14:55,050
you know.
Um,

1838
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,050
one of the things I do use because I
can't,

1839
01:14:57,170 --> 01:14:59,210
I can't stand eating it.
Second,

1840
01:14:59,211 --> 01:15:00,710
stand to eat the fish.
I like the fish.

1841
01:15:00,711 --> 01:15:01,970
I like the salmon.
Um,

1842
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:05,330
I do not like liver,
but beef liver is the highest and

1843
01:15:05,331 --> 01:15:08,870
nutrients you want to talk about a
superfood is like these true superfood.

1844
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,160
Yeah.
Way More than keen water.

1845
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:13,550
And there's so many nutrients in beef
liver,

1846
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:17,150
but I don't like it.
So I take beef liver tablets or capsules

1847
01:15:17,151 --> 01:15:17,931
or whatever.
Oh,

1848
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:19,700
I love liver and those tastes,
yeah.

1849
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,310
I don't know that I don't like it.
I don't know how to cook it,

1850
01:15:22,311 --> 01:15:23,420
so I've never actually made it.
Yeah.

1851
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:28,270
All you do is take a dusting of like
ketogenetic flower,

1852
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:30,430
like almond flour or something like
that.

1853
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:33,190
Put It on there and fried in butter.
Just fry it,

1854
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:35,980
slice that baby up.
Then fry with onions.

1855
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,840
You like onions,
you're going to see a youtube video

1856
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:38,674
then.
Huh Dude,

1857
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,930
I got some elk liver.
If you want to try that,

1858
01:15:40,931 --> 01:15:41,980
that'll,
that'll fuck off.

1859
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:44,650
You think beef liver strong.
He'd take out elk lever.

1860
01:15:44,651 --> 01:15:45,290
You're like,
Yo,

1861
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:48,220
whoa.
You can deadlift liverwurst and I

1862
01:15:48,221 --> 01:15:49,180
thought it was pretty good.
Well,

1863
01:15:49,181 --> 01:15:50,530
yeah,
that's a different thing kyle.

1864
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:52,480
It was pretty good too though.

1865
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,320
Your Buddy Kyle Kingsbury,
he recommended the liverwurst and I was,

1866
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:57,850
yeah,
then I didn't want to do it.

1867
01:15:58,330 --> 01:15:59,470
And um,
it's good.

1868
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:02,120
It's just like mixed in with other stuff
or something really good.

1869
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:04,940
I don't know what's in livermore,
so that's a good question.

1870
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,570
It's liver and kidneys and hearts and
let's find out.

1871
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,860
Well,
all those things are great.

1872
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:12,740
Organ meat is the best meat for you.
And liver in particular.

1873
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,620
That's why wolves,
when the Alpha is established in the

1874
01:16:15,621 --> 01:16:18,140
pack,
the Alpha will always eat the wolf or

1875
01:16:18,141 --> 01:16:20,470
eat the liver first.
I can one,

1876
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:22,010
there was a,
there was this crazy,

1877
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:23,810
uh,
thing that this guy was doing where he

1878
01:16:23,811 --> 01:16:27,590
was living with wolves and a,
he had established himself as the Alpha

1879
01:16:27,591 --> 01:16:29,840
in the pack.
And one of the ways he would do that,

1880
01:16:29,841 --> 01:16:33,980
they would have a kill and he would
plant a liver inside the kill and then

1881
01:16:33,981 --> 01:16:36,410
he would eat the liver and grout,
all the other worlds.

1882
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:39,200
We would let him go because he's got the
liver because once the,

1883
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:43,970
but then he had to leave in order to
help someone else.

1884
01:16:43,971 --> 01:16:48,290
This guy had a farm that was being
attacked by wolves and so he set up some

1885
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:53,291
speakers and had some other wolves howl
and essentially try to convince these

1886
01:16:53,331 --> 01:16:55,490
wolves that were killing these guys.
Uh,

1887
01:16:55,491 --> 01:16:58,070
animals that a new pack had been in
town.

1888
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,200
And with these big speakers,
these other wolves were like,

1889
01:17:00,201 --> 01:17:01,850
Holy Shit,
there's a lot of fucking wolves here.

1890
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:04,250
Let's get outta here.
And he is literally worth,

1891
01:17:04,251 --> 01:17:07,370
but he was gone for a while,
I think for a couple months and when he

1892
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:08,840
came back,
the other walls were like,

1893
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:10,070
fuck you motherfucker.
Where

1894
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,710
the Alpha now and he almost got killed
by these walls.

1895
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:16,760
It's terrifying to watch him whimpering
in front of these walls while these

1896
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:19,190
wolves are like inches away from him
with their teeth,

1897
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,260
like big fucking wolves.
Matt,

1898
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:24,470
why is the idea that while he was doing
studies on walls and they were all

1899
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,560
contained in this large fenced in area,
which is also highly criticized because

1900
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:31,820
there's some videos on,
on uh,

1901
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:36,470
youtube that you could see of these
wolves attacking this one Beta wolf.

1902
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:38,150
And one of the reasons why that
behavior,

1903
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:41,120
so essentially it is the fact that they
are contained in a very small area.

1904
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:43,250
I mean it's big in that it's a few
acres,

1905
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:47,750
but it's small in terms of law,
what a wolf's natural roaming would be.

1906
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:50,930
They do say that animals tend to go for
the liver,

1907
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,310
like they know about it so long.

1908
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:54,230
If you look at salmon,
there's a,

1909
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:58,190
there'd be a bunch of salmon in a river
and like there'd be a big chunk taken

1910
01:17:58,191 --> 01:17:59,930
out of them,
but the rest of the body would be there.

1911
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:03,560
And the reason it was a bear would
basically rip out its liver.

1912
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:04,180
And that's what,
uh,

1913
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:07,130
that's what it was after.
That's when the sector and full surplus

1914
01:18:07,131 --> 01:18:10,130
or Sam and everyone go get four or five
livers,

1915
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:11,810
you know,
because it wanted to eat that.

1916
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:15,800
So it's like looking at the salmon,
almost like an egg and that's the egg

1917
01:18:15,801 --> 01:18:16,251
yolk,
you know,

1918
01:18:16,251 --> 01:18:17,630
that's,
that's an important part.

1919
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:18,830
Yeah.
Most animals,

1920
01:18:18,831 --> 01:18:21,650
like most predatory animals,
they go for the guts first.

1921
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:24,050
It's really weird.
And back in the day,

1922
01:18:24,051 --> 01:18:27,170
I think when they used to kill things,
they would say that even human beings

1923
01:18:27,171 --> 01:18:29,690
where you all the organs first.
Oh yeah.

1924
01:18:29,691 --> 01:18:31,890
I mean Origami Kidney Pie and she didn't
like them.

1925
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:33,920
I mean there was,
but they didn't know they were doing it

1926
01:18:33,921 --> 01:18:36,080
for nutrition.
They just didn't want to waste anything.

1927
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:37,010
No,
I think the party,

1928
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:40,940
I think you're right is great too.
I've got some elkhart and then probably

1929
01:18:40,941 --> 01:18:42,560
went with what tasted better.
Right?

1930
01:18:42,561 --> 01:18:43,610
Like you know,
eventually,

1931
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,290
you know,
if the heart tasted great,

1932
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:46,173
yeah,
let's,

1933
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,181
yeah,
the heart doesn't,

1934
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:51,170
it doesn't taste the best.
The best is like backstrap and which is

1935
01:18:51,171 --> 01:18:53,220
the loins are the tenderloins,
you know,

1936
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,240
which is the inside.
That stuff is the most tender.

1937
01:18:56,241 --> 01:18:57,830
And a lot of people feel like it's the
best.

1938
01:18:58,070 --> 01:19:00,740
Some people like in a cow,
they like in New York's trip it's like a

1939
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:01,370
more,
uh,

1940
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:05,930
it's got a more richer taste.
But most people don't find the liver to

1941
01:19:05,931 --> 01:19:08,330
taste the best,
but it's just cause it's a strong

1942
01:19:08,331 --> 01:19:09,710
flavor.
I don't know.

1943
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:10,490
I've always liked it.

1944
01:19:10,490 --> 01:19:13,640
I've always liked liver beef,
liver desiccated beef.

1945
01:19:13,641 --> 01:19:16,450
Liver capsules actually tastes like a
fart.

1946
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:19,250
I mean when you,
when you burp.

1947
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:20,110
Ah,
no.

1948
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:21,620
Just when,
when when you take them,

1949
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:24,440
you can drink as much water as you want.
You're always going to get that little

1950
01:19:24,441 --> 01:19:25,680
like,
oh well he's like,

1951
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:27,200
he's like a fart.
Wow.

1952
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:29,690
You know,
it's like when you eat the meat,

1953
01:19:29,691 --> 01:19:31,880
it doesn't taste like that.
We eat the meat of the liver.

1954
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,290
It doesn't,
it doesn't taste that.

1955
01:19:33,291 --> 01:19:35,120
I don't think you guys should be high
end farts.

1956
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,870
Now,
Chris Kresser is a big proponent of

1957
01:19:38,871 --> 01:19:40,880
Oregon.
Me and he said when he had a bunch of

1958
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:43,480
autoimmune issues as well,
and he said that auto,

1959
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,910
that eating liver and heart and kidneys
and stuff like that,

1960
01:19:46,911 --> 01:19:48,860
all that stuff really helped him
tremendously.

1961
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:53,400
I wish I like liverwurst more.
It's not that I don't like it that much.

1962
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:54,640
Force yourself to eat it,
man,

1963
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:57,380
and force yourself to eat cow's liver
when you don't really have problems.

1964
01:19:57,381 --> 01:19:59,020
You're getting calves liver most of the
time,

1965
01:19:59,021 --> 01:19:59,990
which is kind of fucked up.
You're,

1966
01:19:59,991 --> 01:20:02,540
even though you're right,
if you do for chuffed to edit,

1967
01:20:02,541 --> 01:20:04,010
your ended up actually liking and I was
like,

1968
01:20:04,011 --> 01:20:05,990
Huh.
You know sometimes you can eat it in a

1969
01:20:05,991 --> 01:20:08,040
place that cooks it.
If you go to a

1970
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,140
really good restaurant that serves liver
and onions,

1971
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:12,570
a good restaurant that serves it,
it's delicious.

1972
01:20:12,571 --> 01:20:15,270
It's just you've got to find someone who
knows how to prepare it properly.

1973
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:17,460
Yeah.
You teach your kids eat healthy or is it

1974
01:20:17,461 --> 01:20:21,210
just kind of like they just watch a
night kind of like off of everything.

1975
01:20:21,211 --> 01:20:24,150
It's really unusual.
They've been eating from the time they

1976
01:20:24,151 --> 01:20:28,950
were really little.
I started hunting in 2012 so for the

1977
01:20:28,951 --> 01:20:31,560
last six years they've been eating wild
game.

1978
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:34,230
So from the time they were little,
like my seven year old,

1979
01:20:34,231 --> 01:20:37,620
she doesn't know anything different.
She's eaten beef for sure.

1980
01:20:37,621 --> 01:20:39,600
She eats hot dogs and normal stuff that
kids eat,

1981
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:44,030
but she's been eating elk and bear and
deer and you know,

1982
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:47,520
Moose her whole life.
She's the wild Turkey.

1983
01:20:47,521 --> 01:20:51,210
She's eaten like basically all the
different things that people hunt for.

1984
01:20:51,211 --> 01:20:52,740
She's eaten since she was a little kid.

1985
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,050
You guys talk about nutrition at all?
Yes.

1986
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,960
Yes.
Well the other thing that my kids eat

1987
01:20:57,961 --> 01:21:01,200
that's really spectacular to watch as
they love Kimchi,

1988
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:03,690
especially my youngest,
she loves probiotics,

1989
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:05,000
which is crazy.
Yeah.

1990
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:09,120
We give them probiotics in supplements.
We give them probiotics and in terms of

1991
01:21:09,121 --> 01:21:12,360
yogurt and acidophilus and,
and these little uh,

1992
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:16,320
Bio k formulas that are pretty rich and
they taste pretty good too.

1993
01:21:16,321 --> 01:21:17,670
There's some sugar in there,
unfortunately,

1994
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:21,090
but,
but getting your kids into really

1995
01:21:21,091 --> 01:21:24,120
healthy probiotic foods,
it's interesting.

1996
01:21:24,121 --> 01:21:27,090
What's interesting is how quickly they
snap back from colds,

1997
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,730
how,
how resistant they are to them and how

1998
01:21:29,731 --> 01:21:33,180
quickly they snap back for them because
they have this healthy biome,

1999
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:35,490
this healthy immune system.
Kimchi is one of my,

2000
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:38,160
I had some Kimchi today.
I eat it almost every day.

2001
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,970
I get this a,
there's a company called mother-in-laws

2002
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:44,100
Kimchi.
It's my favorite and I'll buy like five

2003
01:21:44,101 --> 01:21:47,130
jars at a time and I go through those
fuckers in like two weeks.

2004
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:50,310
You don't see it by itself.
I came to you with meat most of the time

2005
01:21:50,311 --> 01:21:53,520
I'll slice meat and put Kimchi on it.
And if the two of them together don't,

2006
01:21:53,521 --> 01:21:55,340
people bury that shit like in their
backyard.

2007
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:56,940
Koreans do.
Yeah.

2008
01:21:56,941 --> 01:21:59,420
They make a pot and it ferments and the
bird in their bag,

2009
01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:01,690
it's really good for your gut
microbiome.

2010
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:05,050
And the more we find out about that,
that's why I was saying like what I'm

2011
01:22:05,051 --> 01:22:07,750
doing is an intervention.
I'm not going to just eat meat forever.

2012
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:08,663
Right.
Um,

2013
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:09,880
because I,
the next,

2014
01:22:09,910 --> 01:22:13,750
the next step for me is once I get to
the point where I feel like I'm lean

2015
01:22:13,751 --> 01:22:17,200
enough to where I want to be,
I still want to lose about 10 pounds.

2016
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:18,260
And you really,
yeah,

2017
01:22:18,261 --> 01:22:20,980
I get leaner.
You lean still have a lot of belly fat

2018
01:22:20,981 --> 01:22:25,780
that's been around from my drinking
everyday for so the upper abs come in,

2019
01:22:25,781 --> 01:22:27,220
but then the lower abs is still,
uh,

2020
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,710
you know,
so we got out,

2021
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:29,740
we had tightened.
I shut up.

2022
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:31,640
Other than Peter Luger going off the
rails,

2023
01:22:31,641 --> 01:22:34,580
I've been on a strict diet for two weeks
and I've lost five pounds.

2024
01:22:34,610 --> 01:22:38,360
What's your diet?
Which you just meat and vegetables.

2025
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:39,290
That's mostly it.

2026
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:42,720
And any sort of a rhyme or reason or you
just eat as much as you want when you

2027
01:22:42,721 --> 01:22:43,554
want or,

2028
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:47,200
I got a little fat.
I got up to about 200 and that's what

2029
01:22:47,201 --> 01:22:51,100
I'm fat and I,
I like to be like right now I was one 94

2030
01:22:51,101 --> 01:22:53,920
after my run.
Some probably like one 96.

2031
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:56,130
It's amazing.
We weighed the same exact weight one 94

2032
01:22:56,131 --> 01:22:56,700
this morning.

2033
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,240
Yeah.
Just became best friends.

2034
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,860
Ah,
did we just become,

2035
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,570
yeah,
I like to be,

2036
01:23:01,571 --> 01:23:03,820
I think if I'm really,
if I'm shredded,

2037
01:23:03,821 --> 01:23:05,780
I'm down at about one 90.
Yeah.

2038
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:06,970
That's what I think.
I'm really,

2039
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:09,160
so I think I need,
I could lose another four pounds.

2040
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:12,640
I think being mindful as a key factor,
you know that you're like I'm getting

2041
01:23:12,641 --> 01:23:14,800
fat.
Hold yourself to a standard.

2042
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:17,740
I tell people all the time try to be
made as something different.

2043
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:19,600
Yeah.
The only way I know how to like build

2044
01:23:19,601 --> 01:23:20,320
up,
uh,

2045
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,830
any self esteem or you know,
build up self respect or any of these

2046
01:23:23,831 --> 01:23:25,900
things is through training or through
diet.

2047
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:28,510
I can't really do it through a business
meeting.

2048
01:23:28,511 --> 01:23:30,490
I can't do it just through like reading
a book.

2049
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:33,280
You can get motivated by watching a
youtube video or something,

2050
01:23:33,281 --> 01:23:36,160
but that lasts you a couple hours.
Maybe it lasts you for the week.

2051
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:38,260
Maybe it helps point in the right
direction,

2052
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:40,390
which is cool.
Well the thing about it for martial

2053
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:42,640
arts,
especially for striking is when you lose

2054
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:44,140
weight,
you move faster.

2055
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:47,440
It's like if I,
if I went out there and hit the bag and

2056
01:23:47,441 --> 01:23:51,040
I put a 40 pound weight vest on,
strap that fucker and I would feel

2057
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:52,780
slower.
I mean I just would,

2058
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:54,070
I just,
there's no way around it.

2059
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:56,470
Well,
even 10 pounds makes a difference.

2060
01:23:56,471 --> 01:23:58,270
When I used to fight,
one of the things that I noticed when I

2061
01:23:58,271 --> 01:24:01,450
would get down close to my weight class
is I just move quicker because I was

2062
01:24:01,451 --> 01:24:03,370
carrying around less weight.
I felt,

2063
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,270
I felt like I was less to move around.
Like my muscles are essentially as

2064
01:24:07,271 --> 01:24:09,940
strong and probably lost a little bit of
muscle when you lose weight,

2065
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:14,830
but most of it was there,
but my body fat on my body weight was

2066
01:24:14,831 --> 01:24:17,710
down several pounds and I would just
move quicker.

2067
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,260
You used to be tough as a fighter to
gauge that too though.

2068
01:24:20,261 --> 01:24:23,020
Like when you lose too much,
like maybe like one almost wanting to

2069
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:25,230
avoid food to feel faster.
You.

2070
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:29,620
You see that with a lot of UFC fighters
when they get down too low in weight,

2071
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:31,270
they just can't perform properly and
this,

2072
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:32,890
that,
and I think there's a real issue with

2073
01:24:32,891 --> 01:24:35,980
MMA and that issue is there's not enough
weight classes.

2074
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:38,650
I,
they're very,

2075
01:24:38,651 --> 01:24:42,610
very strongly about this.
I think there's giant gaps like one 85

2076
01:24:42,611 --> 01:24:46,180
to two oh five drives me fucking crazy.
It's a 20 that's a gap.

2077
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:50,230
That's a tough area to,
because guys can be so muscular that

2078
01:24:50,231 --> 01:24:52,040
way,
or skinny I it does it.

2079
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:53,950
Well,
it's really how tall they are,

2080
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,050
whatever.
But it's really like what is your

2081
01:24:56,051 --> 01:25:00,190
optimal and the idea that people would
fit in between that 20 pounds optimal

2082
01:25:00,191 --> 01:25:01,480
either this way or that way.

2083
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,550
It's crazy because those two oh five
guys,

2084
01:25:03,551 --> 01:25:05,590
a lot of them could be heavyweights like
Jon Jones.

2085
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:07,840
Jon Jones could be the heavyweight
champion of the world.

2086
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,470
100% no doubt about it,
no fucking doubt about it.

2087
01:25:11,471 --> 01:25:13,480
Yet.
He's still in ways two oh five when he

2088
01:25:13,481 --> 01:25:15,310
fights and he doesn't have a hard time
making that weight.

2089
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:19,240
Now if you're a guy like say Hector
Lombard,

2090
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:22,660
who's fought at one 70 and just really
packs a lot of meat on,

2091
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:27,130
and he fights it one 85 you know it,
when he fights at one 85 he could,

2092
01:25:27,131 --> 01:25:31,270
he's also fought at two oh five before I
believe if he decided to fight it one at

2093
01:25:31,271 --> 01:25:35,890
two Oh five and John Jones decides to
fight it to a five I mean hector's my

2094
01:25:35,891 --> 01:25:39,790
height and Jon Jones towers over me.
So you're looking at just a totally

2095
01:25:39,791 --> 01:25:43,420
different body size and totally
different frame that 20 pounds is too

2096
01:25:43,421 --> 01:25:44,254
much man.

2097
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:46,450
And then from two oh five to
heavyweight,

2098
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,090
you could get some brock Lesnar
motherfucker that or Francis and Ghana

2099
01:25:50,091 --> 01:25:53,890
who has to cut weight to make two 65
frances even more impressive.

2100
01:25:53,891 --> 01:25:55,540
Right,
because he's natural.

2101
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:58,090
I mean,
he's not even barely lifting weights.

2102
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,710
I mean that guy is just a fucking
gigantic super athlete.

2103
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:04,010
So that guy doesn't really lift.
No,

2104
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:04,911
it's huge.
Huge.

2105
01:26:04,911 --> 01:26:08,420
He got that big from working in a
fucking sand mine.

2106
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:09,530
Oh my God,
this is,

2107
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:12,230
I mean,
he literally is like Conan the barbarian

2108
01:26:12,231 --> 01:26:14,210
from the Robert E.
Howard Nigerian.

2109
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:17,270
He is from Cameroon I believe.
Right?

2110
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:20,180
I think that's where he's from.
He,

2111
01:26:20,181 --> 01:26:25,181
there's videos of him on his instagram
from yesterday of him back in the same

2112
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:30,500
sand mine and he's wearing his fucking
Reebok Jersey with his name on the back

2113
01:26:30,501 --> 01:26:32,780
of it,
digging sand with all the guys who used

2114
01:26:32,781 --> 01:26:33,614
to work with.

2115
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:38,720
It's fucking crazy.
But that is hard labor and it's,

2116
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:40,820
there it is.
Do that all day.

2117
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:44,960
Dig fucking stand all day.
You know how fucking strong you had been

2118
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:50,290
just carrying 20 pound hunks of sand and
shoving them into the top of that truck

2119
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,790
all day long.
He's a beast.

2120
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,790
Well he's uh,
he's got tremendous genetics.

2121
01:26:55,791 --> 01:26:58,610
His father has built a chem two.
There's a picture of him on his

2122
01:26:58,611 --> 01:27:02,180
instagram when he was three years old
standing next to his father and you look

2123
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:03,770
at his daddy like,
oh Jesus,

2124
01:27:03,771 --> 01:27:06,230
like the apple on the tree.
They are baby.

2125
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,480
You think he's going to be pretty
dangerous coming up?

2126
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:11,630
Like the only issue with Francis,
his wrestling and his uh,

2127
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,030
in his endurance,
and this is just based on his fight with

2128
01:27:14,031 --> 01:27:17,150
steep emile chick who in my opinion is
the best heavy weight ever.

2129
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:20,540
I think if you look at what Steve Pays
managed to do in his career,

2130
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:22,280
uh,
he's defended the title more than

2131
01:27:22,281 --> 01:27:22,940
anybody.

2132
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:25,370
He knocked out for breezy over Dune was
one of the best ever.

2133
01:27:25,371 --> 01:27:28,770
He knocked out Alistair Overeem,
he beat Francis and Ghana who everybody

2134
01:27:28,771 --> 01:27:32,060
was fucking terrified of and Francis
been blowing everybody out of the water,

2135
01:27:32,061 --> 01:27:36,110
including Alistair overeem.
I just think and knocked out junior dos

2136
01:27:36,111 --> 01:27:37,700
Santos,
also former heavyweight champion.

2137
01:27:37,701 --> 01:27:41,630
I think Steve pays the best of all time.
So when you know,

2138
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:45,590
Steve [inaudible] is able to beat you
and beat you by using his wrestling and

2139
01:27:45,591 --> 01:27:49,490
using his smarts and using his,
his octagon intelligence and just his

2140
01:27:49,491 --> 01:27:51,800
overall fight Iq,
he just knows how to fight better.

2141
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:57,100
He's just got more tools in the toolbox.
Frances can learn and he's an incredible

2142
01:27:57,261 --> 01:28:01,040
athlete and what he has over everybody,
his power,

2143
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:04,610
he has more power in his punch.
We have a machine out there called the

2144
01:28:04,611 --> 01:28:09,320
power cube and that machine Francis
registered the highest ever power punch

2145
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,960
by like 10,000 units,
whatever the fuck that means.

2146
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,810
So tyrone spong,
who's a super powerful heavyweight

2147
01:28:14,811 --> 01:28:17,980
boxer,
he scored like one 19 I think it was an

2148
01:28:17,981 --> 01:28:22,981
f or one 14 and then Francis scored
1209209000 and you see it when he hits

2149
01:28:25,701 --> 01:28:27,260
people.
And that's about what you kick,

2150
01:28:27,261 --> 01:28:28,820
right?
You get your check a little bit more

2151
01:28:28,821 --> 01:28:29,630
than that.
So that's,

2152
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:33,860
I kicked in the face.
I hold the record right now until

2153
01:28:33,861 --> 01:28:37,340
somebody beats ago.
We'll hold the red one 5,252 from a

2154
01:28:37,341 --> 01:28:37,820
kick.
That's,

2155
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:40,250
but again,
look at the size of my leg,

2156
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:44,570
like carrying around 196 pounds all day,
running hills with 196 pounds.

2157
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:47,930
Try,
try doing fucking handstands and running

2158
01:28:47,931 --> 01:28:49,730
up a hill with handstands.
You just can't,

2159
01:28:49,731 --> 01:28:52,280
you're arms are not that strong.
And also,

2160
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:54,080
you know,
I've been kicking my whole life,

2161
01:28:54,081 --> 01:28:56,300
he's really only been training him in
Maine for five years.

2162
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,560
Yeah.
So he's just,

2163
01:28:57,561 --> 01:28:58,490
he's fun to watch.

2164
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:01,100
He's amazing to watch.
It's like a old Tyson fight.

2165
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,190
Yeah.
Even the match,

2166
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:04,770
even a fight with us.
Steve Bay was kind of scary cause he

2167
01:29:04,771 --> 01:29:06,090
just kept getting back up and it was
like,

2168
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:08,970
it was like watching now Mike Myers like
a horror movie or something.

2169
01:29:08,971 --> 01:29:11,610
Michael Myers and,
or Freddy Kruger or something just kept

2170
01:29:11,611 --> 01:29:13,210
coming back.
It doesn't have the wrestling

2171
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,270
experience.
It doesn't have the wrestling technique.

2172
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:20,330
But what he has is a incredible heart
and desire and he's very hungry to

2173
01:29:20,371 --> 01:29:21,550
learn.
And I'm,

2174
01:29:21,551 --> 01:29:24,000
I'm very hopeful that he's going to
learn and you know,

2175
01:29:24,001 --> 01:29:26,610
and I really,
really hope that he incorporates,

2176
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,030
um,
of real rigorous wrestling program

2177
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:32,160
because that was one thing that was
lacking from his last,

2178
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,900
uh,
it was the last training camp when he

2179
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:37,080
fought for steep pen.
I think you have seen needs a 300 and up

2180
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:37,771
club,
I think.

2181
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:38,221
So,
you know,

2182
01:29:38,221 --> 01:29:40,370
to have that,
have that weight class and then have him

2183
01:29:40,371 --> 01:29:42,690
only fight for a minute and rest for
like five minutes.

2184
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:45,240
Well there's nothing I issue is there's
not enough fighters.

2185
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:46,980
There's not enough guys,
you know,

2186
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:49,470
but not enough big boys.
Yeah.

2187
01:29:49,471 --> 01:29:54,130
Maybe you just like put,
you saw it on the back burner for up to

2188
01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:56,520
65 and I'm going to do whatever you
want.

2189
01:29:56,630 --> 01:29:58,140
Um,
you know,

2190
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,370
uh,
you know,

2191
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:02,310
I'm,
I'm hopeful that Francis still,

2192
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:06,030
I mean,
he's a little older in terms of like

2193
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:09,050
being this new to the sport at 33,
you know,

2194
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:11,040
I mean,
it really didn't even start training

2195
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:12,220
until he was 28.
I mean,

2196
01:30:12,221 --> 01:30:13,710
he's kind of crazy.
He was homeless.

2197
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:14,490
Yeah.
I mean,

2198
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:18,300
you want to talk about our amazing story
that's like right out of a movie.

2199
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,410
The guy was homeless,
came from Africa where he worked in a

2200
01:30:22,411 --> 01:30:27,411
fucking sand mine and then gets to the
number one contender spot in the UFC.

2201
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,420
But there's guys now,
uh,

2202
01:30:30,421 --> 01:30:31,254
like,
uh,

2203
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:35,430
um,
Alexander Volkov is that Volcom Volkov

2204
01:30:35,810 --> 01:30:36,643
cough.

2205
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:39,120
Um,
the guy who just knocked out,

2206
01:30:39,121 --> 01:30:40,650
um,
February over doom.

2207
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:44,100
He's this,
this is a giant guy.

2208
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:46,710
Like he's a huge,
I think he's six,

2209
01:30:46,711 --> 01:30:48,630
seven cheese.
Yeah.

2210
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:51,420
And incredibly skillful.
So there's,

2211
01:30:51,421 --> 01:30:55,200
there's these guys that are coming up
that are like at the higher end of the

2212
01:30:55,201 --> 01:30:56,670
way class.
How do you say his last name?

2213
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:00,300
Volkov right.
I W I always get confused because

2214
01:31:00,301 --> 01:31:05,301
Russians say things with Russian accent.
I was under the vocal vocal Volkov is

2215
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:10,380
find out if that's the case,
if he that tall.

2216
01:31:10,890 --> 01:31:11,790
He is,
he's six,

2217
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:12,570
seven,
yeah.

2218
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:17,370
He's a incredibly long and efficient and
he has real power.

2219
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:19,320
He,
and he's hard to hit man,

2220
01:31:19,321 --> 01:31:24,321
but his game is so well rounded.
The difference between him and a guy

2221
01:31:25,261 --> 01:31:26,640
likes,
you know,

2222
01:31:26,641 --> 01:31:27,480
um,
uh,

2223
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,670
Francis is,
he's not new to the game.

2224
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:33,420
I mean he's a giant guy who's been
fighting for a long fucking time,

2225
01:31:33,421 --> 01:31:36,240
so he is a real efficient martial
artists.

2226
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:41,020
When he fought Fabrizio Verdon I could
tell early on the striking exchanges

2227
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:41,903
like,
wow,

2228
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:44,210
fabrizio might be in trouble.
Like this guy is,

2229
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,470
he's long,
he knows that the stay on the outside

2230
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,520
and he knows he's got an excellent sense
of distance and he's got legit knockout

2231
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:52,650
power and he fucked fabrizio up,
man.

2232
01:31:52,651 --> 01:31:54,360
That was,
that was hard to watch.

2233
01:31:54,361 --> 01:31:55,350
I was like,
wow,

2234
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:56,820
this guy's,
he's legit.

2235
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,470
It's amazing.
These longer body types have been so

2236
01:31:59,471 --> 01:32:01,720
good.
Anderson Silva Bounce Jones.

2237
01:32:01,721 --> 01:32:03,310
Yeah.
A lot of these guys have,

2238
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,650
you know,
you wouldn't think that,

2239
01:32:05,651 --> 01:32:07,090
you know,
you'd think someone may be shorter

2240
01:32:07,091 --> 01:32:10,240
stockier and getting the inside.
But did he seize up long?

2241
01:32:10,241 --> 01:32:15,241
Seems like a huge beat Saturday night.
Sharapov say that five times fast.

2242
01:32:16,361 --> 01:32:18,340
Like I said,
well before we came on the podcast,

2243
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:22,630
as soon as he came on,
I'm going six to one 45 you can find a

2244
01:32:22,631 --> 01:32:23,680
skinnier guy I thought.

2245
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,770
And then I saw him fight and man,
he was just so impressive.

2246
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:31,720
But fast and strong live at one 45 and
six two I guess voice was,

2247
01:32:31,721 --> 01:32:33,490
you know,
he wasn't real tall but he was like six

2248
01:32:33,491 --> 01:32:35,840
one right.
But he was one 75 mm.

2249
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:37,810
And you know,
he was obviously fighting in the

2250
01:32:37,811 --> 01:32:40,750
unlimited class and he was fighting guys
like Dan Severn at the time.

2251
01:32:40,751 --> 01:32:44,930
It was two 65 feet is thin,
but he's got muscle on him if he's kind

2252
01:32:44,931 --> 01:32:46,810
of jacked.
Like when you looked at it like a

2253
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:48,500
perfect frame.
He's all almost awesome,

2254
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:50,920
a little tiny luke rockhold and a lot of
ways,

2255
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:54,610
but with a way more dynamic game.
He could do everything.

2256
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:56,290
That guy,
he was really interesting to watch this

2257
01:32:56,291 --> 01:32:59,830
first time I ever saw him.
Fight Dot guy is fucking phenomenal.

2258
01:32:59,831 --> 01:33:02,230
He's so talented.
That was the first time I saw him fight

2259
01:33:02,231 --> 01:33:05,290
live and it's a different thing when you
see someone live.

2260
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:06,760
Like if you see someone in a video and
you go,

2261
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:07,720
wow,
that guy's good.

2262
01:33:07,870 --> 01:33:10,360
But they,
you see him live and you know your brain

2263
01:33:10,361 --> 01:33:13,920
has like a little computer where it's
seen or you know you've got,

2264
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:15,820
they've got a database,
especially me,

2265
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:19,720
I've seen so many fights,
have a database of how people move and

2266
01:33:19,721 --> 01:33:21,010
then you see that guy moving.
You're like,

2267
01:33:21,011 --> 01:33:23,470
Whoa,
what are we looking at here?

2268
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:26,710
Because I love seeing that.
I love seeing this next level shit,

2269
01:33:26,711 --> 01:33:29,500
that next level thing.
Like whether it's you know,

2270
01:33:29,501 --> 01:33:32,620
connor or whether it's a tyron woodley
or these,

2271
01:33:32,621 --> 01:33:34,540
every now and then you see next level
and you go,

2272
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:36,880
oh,
like tyron woodley to me.

2273
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:41,500
He fought Carlos condit and there was a
moment in the condit fight where he

2274
01:33:41,501 --> 01:33:44,590
stepped forward and snap Carlos with a a
straight right hand.

2275
01:33:44,591 --> 01:33:45,580
I was like,
Whoa,

2276
01:33:45,581 --> 01:33:47,830
that's like 10% faster than it should
be.

2277
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:48,741
You know what I mean?
Like you,

2278
01:33:48,741 --> 01:33:53,650
you get used to world class athletes
moving and then you see someone like

2279
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:56,230
Edson Barboza switch kick.
That's another one.

2280
01:33:56,231 --> 01:33:57,370
You're like,
Whoa,

2281
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,930
whoa baby.
You know.

2282
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:04,050
But to me the biggest example that is
Nurburg of madoff's wrestling Khabib

2283
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,380
takes how,
my God,

2284
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:07,720
everybody,
everybody who's good,

2285
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:09,490
how failed though?
Just Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,

2286
01:34:09,491 --> 01:34:10,630
black belt,
world champion,

2287
01:34:10,930 --> 01:34:13,660
rag dolls,
rag dolls,

2288
01:34:13,661 --> 01:34:15,220
everybody,
Michael Johnson.

2289
01:34:15,221 --> 01:34:17,200
I mean,
no matter who he fights,

2290
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:20,710
he ragdolled this guy in the beginning
and I thought it was over right away.

2291
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:21,101
I was like,
oh,

2292
01:34:21,101 --> 01:34:23,710
this is over and that.
But I can't say did,

2293
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:25,900
did really well,
did very well.

2294
01:34:25,901 --> 01:34:28,240
Very well.
The thing about higher quinta is he's a

2295
01:34:28,241 --> 01:34:31,210
legit crazy person.
Like that guy's crazy.

2296
01:34:31,211 --> 01:34:33,040
He trashes hotel rooms.
He's like,

2297
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,780
you look at his eyes like,
oh,

2298
01:34:34,781 --> 01:34:36,130
there's only like a's,
the guy,

2299
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:37,690
a couple of people home.

2300
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:41,830
It's not a full village in that head.
That's not a good example.

2301
01:34:41,831 --> 01:34:45,580
But what I'm saying like he's a legit
maniac and he's not scared.

2302
01:34:45,610 --> 01:34:48,070
Like he'll fight anybody.
Like you could wake him up at three

2303
01:34:48,071 --> 01:34:51,250
o'clock in the morning and he'll fight.
Anybody made crazy thing.

2304
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:54,970
He was screaming.
He was running around the hotel lobby

2305
01:34:54,971 --> 01:34:58,340
the day when,
when we found out Max Holloway could not

2306
01:34:58,341 --> 01:34:59,770
make weight.
And the new,

2307
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,820
by the way,
I shouldn't say could not make weight.

2308
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:04,760
I believe Max would have made the way
they did in New York State Athletic

2309
01:35:04,761 --> 01:35:06,950
Commission,
which they made some,

2310
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:11,450
they made some big errors and I can go
into detail with a couple of them.

2311
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:13,520
One of them is they wouldn't let Paul
felder fight.

2312
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:15,440
Um,
Paul felder wanted to fight.

2313
01:35:15,441 --> 01:35:19,640
They said he's not ranked.
Paul felder is a fucking killer.

2314
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:21,410
He is a straight up killer.

2315
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:25,820
And him versus Khabib would have been a
very interesting fight because Paul is a

2316
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:30,170
big one 55.
He's very big and very strong and he is

2317
01:35:30,171 --> 01:35:34,640
an expert world class striker.
I mean Paul felder is a dangerous,

2318
01:35:34,641 --> 01:35:38,570
dangerous man for anybody.
In 155 pounds and he's a grounded pound

2319
01:35:38,571 --> 01:35:41,570
expert.
He's also get very good defense in,

2320
01:35:41,571 --> 01:35:42,890
in everything.
Very good defense,

2321
01:35:42,891 --> 01:35:44,750
standing up.
Very good defense on the ground.

2322
01:35:44,751 --> 01:35:47,990
He felt his fucking well rounded.
I would have been very intrigued in that

2323
01:35:47,991 --> 01:35:51,020
fight and they offered it to felder fell
this had fuck.

2324
01:35:51,021 --> 01:35:52,410
Yeah.
And then in Nevada state or the,

2325
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:54,170
excuse me,
New York State Athletic Commission said,

2326
01:35:55,070 --> 01:35:56,780
I was like,
you guys are out of your fucking minds.

2327
01:35:56,781 --> 01:35:59,210
You don't know shit about fighting if
you don't think that guy could fight for

2328
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:02,090
the title because Paul might be fighting
for the title in a year from now or

2329
01:36:02,091 --> 01:36:02,690
whenever.

2330
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:05,600
I mean he's fucking world class.
So the fact that they don't know that

2331
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:06,321
and they're saying,
well,

2332
01:36:06,321 --> 01:36:08,570
based on the rankings,
the rankings are horse shit.

2333
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,420
They're arbitrary.
They're made by a bunch of people that I

2334
01:36:11,421 --> 01:36:14,030
think a lot of times they're biased.
They have terrible judgment.

2335
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:18,050
Sometimes the guy will fuck a guy up and
then you look at the rankings and he's

2336
01:36:18,051 --> 01:36:20,240
below that guy.
He just fucked up in the rankings.

2337
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:24,020
Explain that there was no other way to
tell if a guy's better than who we

2338
01:36:24,021 --> 01:36:25,190
fucked up.
And they say,

2339
01:36:25,191 --> 01:36:28,130
wow,
it was past experience suck fat dicks.

2340
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:30,710
That past experience doesn't mean
anything.

2341
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:33,770
This guy just date,
this guy beat the guy who beat the guy.

2342
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,810
That guy beat him.
Well if he was number one,

2343
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:37,820
now he's number one.
That's how it goes.

2344
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:39,860
You can't get knocked out and still be
number one.

2345
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:42,680
That's fucking bananas.
And this is often the case when you see

2346
01:36:42,681 --> 01:36:45,680
a guy beat a guy and he's still below
the guy in the rank.

2347
01:36:45,681 --> 01:36:47,930
He's like,
what the fuck else can he do?

2348
01:36:48,030 --> 01:36:51,140
How did you end up with the guy?
How did they end up getting I

2349
01:36:51,141 --> 01:36:52,550
acquainted?
Then they just asked him.

2350
01:36:52,551 --> 01:36:53,990
He was in,
he was the next guy in line.

2351
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:58,190
He's on a four or five fight win streak.
Um,

2352
01:36:58,330 --> 01:37:01,010
and he's beaten some very good guys like
Jorge Mosfet doll,

2353
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:02,270
uh,
Ross Pearson.

2354
01:37:02,271 --> 01:37:03,920
He's beaten some legit guys.
I mean,

2355
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:06,590
look,
I Quinta can bang and he's tough as shit

2356
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:09,440
and he's got a wrestling background,
which I think played a big factor in

2357
01:37:09,441 --> 01:37:13,190
that fight.
Obviously he was greatly outclass by a

2358
01:37:13,191 --> 01:37:15,890
guy who I think is one of the greatest
lightweight of all time.

2359
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:19,010
And now that he's the champion,
I'm very interested in seeing.

2360
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:23,060
But I think what,
what we saw in that fight that was very

2361
01:37:23,061 --> 01:37:27,160
intriguing was the fact that I acquaint
it was able to get back up and that I

2362
01:37:27,161 --> 01:37:30,230
quit was one of the few guys that number
go madoff has ever fought,

2363
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:34,040
that has stuffed a bunch of take downs
and then into the late rounds.

2364
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:37,760
And this is a guy in owl that didn't
even prepare for a five round fight.

2365
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:40,190
He was getting ready for a three round
fight with Paul felder.

2366
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:43,040
So I mean fucking props to ally La
Quinta.

2367
01:37:43,041 --> 01:37:44,900
I mean fucking animal.
Great job.

2368
01:37:45,230 --> 01:37:50,230
I was off animal and major props to the
could that Kyle Bochniac kit that

2369
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:55,331
[inaudible] beat that kid and savage
cause he ate everything.

2370
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:57,330
He was smiling,
punched in the face,

2371
01:37:57,331 --> 01:38:02,130
smiling and coming off the end of the
fight and the three rounds of a clinic,

2372
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:03,570
I mean he's a beat put on a clinic.

2373
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:04,560
He did everything,
jumped,

2374
01:38:04,561 --> 01:38:06,650
spinning back kicks,
roundhouse tricks,

2375
01:38:06,651 --> 01:38:08,850
switch kicks.
He hit him with a switch kick.

2376
01:38:08,851 --> 01:38:13,380
There was like Jesus Bochniac took a
couple to the neck rack and still kept

2377
01:38:13,381 --> 01:38:16,050
calm and still kept common blood coming
out of his nose,

2378
01:38:16,051 --> 01:38:18,870
his mouth stickin Freemason,
sticking his tongue out on him.

2379
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:20,250
And then as a beat,
it's like,

2380
01:38:20,251 --> 01:38:22,230
what the fuck do I got to do to this
guy?

2381
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:23,610
At the end of it blocked me,
acts,

2382
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:26,970
got him pinned up against the cage and
he's throwing bombs and was crazy.

2383
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:30,330
The whole place.
The entire Barclay Center on their feet.

2384
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:31,883
Fuck.
I stood up,

2385
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,950
I was screaming and cop and it was
phenomenal.

2386
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:37,110
Phenomenal.
That's what I love,

2387
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,850
you know.
And that was in my mind,

2388
01:38:38,851 --> 01:38:41,520
that was worth the price of admission
for the whole paper with your car,

2389
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,380
just to see who's the best fight for
sure.

2390
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,280
Yeah,
for sure.

2391
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:48,450
But to see our do that just shows you
that,

2392
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:52,020
you know,
Al is a legit worldclass fighter.

2393
01:38:52,021 --> 01:38:53,730
You mean?
Definitely is not on the level of could

2394
01:38:53,731 --> 01:38:55,170
be,
but nobody thought he was coming in.

2395
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:56,243
I think it was,
uh,

2396
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:58,680
in a lot of ways an upset,
just the fact that he was able to go to

2397
01:38:58,681 --> 01:39:02,640
the distance and you see what could be
did to so many other fighters mean he

2398
01:39:02,641 --> 01:39:06,540
mall different else and he mauled out
for a lot of the fight.

2399
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:07,561
I mean,
look,

2400
01:39:07,561 --> 01:39:10,830
the guy's the best wrestler at one 55
ever.

2401
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:11,903
I mean,
ever.

2402
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:16,740
He does things to worldclass guys that
makes you just confused because he's

2403
01:39:16,741 --> 01:39:18,930
not,
it's like there's certain guys that are

2404
01:39:18,931 --> 01:39:22,380
doing things like ya year Rodriguez is a
perfect example.

2405
01:39:22,381 --> 01:39:26,040
He does wild shit.
He does like jump three 60 roundhouse

2406
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:28,650
kicks.
He threesixty roundhouse kicks Bj Penn

2407
01:39:28,651 --> 01:39:31,020
and the fate and you're like,
what the fuck?

2408
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:34,420
So this is like a guy doing something to
the other guy with the other guy.

2409
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:36,600
Just can't do that.
He can't move that way.

2410
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,690
Number of Madoff is doing standard
stuff,

2411
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:44,490
but he's doing it at such a high level
that he'd makes world class fighters,

2412
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:47,430
questioned their career.
He takes them in malls,

2413
01:39:47,431 --> 01:39:50,190
them and they have a different sense of
where they fit in the universe.

2414
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:53,310
It's crazy to see somebody come back
from that when they're getting the shit

2415
01:39:53,311 --> 01:39:55,020
beat out of them.
They're getting hit so hard.

2416
01:39:55,021 --> 01:39:56,250
You're like,
what makes you,

2417
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,730
and I've had,
I've had some fighters and stuff that,

2418
01:39:58,731 --> 01:40:03,510
that I've talked to you in the past and
a lot of times they don't even know that

2419
01:40:03,511 --> 01:40:07,620
how fucking bat shit crazy they are.
I did pro wrestling for for a handful of

2420
01:40:07,621 --> 01:40:10,920
years and when I was wrestling,
a lot of times we'd share the ring and

2421
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:15,090
so on and a lot of times like the UFC
fighters,

2422
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,520
they would say,
you guys are fucking crazy.

2423
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,680
What are you guys doing in there?
Fucking jumping off the top rope.

2424
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:21,040
I'm like,
we're crazy with the fit.

2425
01:40:21,041 --> 01:40:22,800
You're doing fucking out of this world.
Well,

2426
01:40:22,801 --> 01:40:24,990
I've goofed around about pro wrestling
before,

2427
01:40:24,991 --> 01:40:26,540
but my honest feelings,
all,

2428
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:29,400
all bullshit aside.
This is one of the toughest professions

2429
01:40:29,401 --> 01:40:30,530
in all of entertainer.
Udl.

2430
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:32,670
It is unbelievably.
It is gay though.

2431
01:40:32,671 --> 01:40:35,350
That's why I was in it just for the gay
style.

2432
01:40:35,730 --> 01:40:36,870
Exactly.
It's not,

2433
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,070
you know,
it's,

2434
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:40,320
it's not a sport,
it's entertainment,

2435
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:44,010
but you have to be incredibly athletic
to do some shit they do.

2436
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:47,100
And the beating those guys take this in
terms of their body,

2437
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:49,350
it's,
it's very underappreciated cause you

2438
01:40:49,351 --> 01:40:50,550
just watch it and you go,
oh,

2439
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:53,160
it's not real.
They're not really fighting.

2440
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:55,030
But no,
they're really hitting each other with

2441
01:40:55,031 --> 01:40:57,340
chairs.
They're really jumping off the top rope.

2442
01:40:57,341 --> 01:40:58,480
It's slamming each other.

2443
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:00,280
I mean all the crazy shit that they do,
the,

2444
01:41:00,390 --> 01:41:03,910
the toll those guys take on their body
is an unbearable,

2445
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:07,720
like what we're saying about Kurt Angle,
like that guy has gone through a fuck

2446
01:41:07,721 --> 01:41:08,740
load.
I mean,

2447
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:12,640
see if you can find that picture.
I think it's on Ronda Rousey's instagram

2448
01:41:12,641 --> 01:41:15,910
page.
Ronda Rousey with Kurt Angle at the end

2449
01:41:15,911 --> 01:41:20,140
of their match and you're looking at it
50 he won Olympic gold medal with a

2450
01:41:20,141 --> 01:41:24,640
broken neck and he's still going to be a
gold medal with his neck was broken.

2451
01:41:24,641 --> 01:41:26,640
Then he won the Olympics.
Brogan freaking night,

2452
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:28,540
not like broken in half.
It was fractured.

2453
01:41:28,570 --> 01:41:30,250
He had a fracture in his neck and he's
still one.

2454
01:41:30,370 --> 01:41:33,460
What the fuck down.
It wasn't supposed to restaurant.

2455
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:34,100
No,
no,

2456
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:34,990
no,
no.

2457
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:36,160
Not that.
That was a good one.

2458
01:41:36,161 --> 01:41:40,840
But the one with the arms raised,
is it on hers?

2459
01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:42,220
Maybe it's not.

2460
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,810
There it is right there.
Look at that.

2461
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:44,610
Look at his arms,
man.

2462
01:41:44,610 --> 01:41:45,480
Yeah,
that's your feed.

2463
01:41:45,490 --> 01:41:46,690
Yeah.
Look at that left arm.

2464
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:47,770
I mean that's crazy.
It looks like,

2465
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,030
no,
no offense Jamie.

2466
01:41:49,170 --> 01:41:51,070
It looks like Jamie's arm.
Jim,

2467
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:53,470
you've got big arms.
You do have big arms.

2468
01:41:53,471 --> 01:41:55,900
I mean you do,
but you have big arms for a normal guy.

2469
01:41:55,990 --> 01:41:57,190
He's a god.
Go Gorilla.

2470
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:58,300
Normal.
Yeah,

2471
01:41:58,330 --> 01:41:59,890
for normal.
Well your your athletic,

2472
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:02,860
but your guy.
I'm not saying anything bad,

2473
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,800
but I'm saying that for the size of what
he used to look like.

2474
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:08,020
Go back.
Look at the size of his fucking neck,

2475
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:10,840
dude.
What is that thing right below his ear?

2476
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:12,730
What is that?
That's his neck.

2477
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:13,940
What is that?
That's your fucking,

2478
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:16,240
that's like,
I just gotta go for living in his neck.

2479
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:18,970
You know the way those guys train their
neck is crazy.

2480
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,880
The way that dude's with bridges and
shit and then that's just not good for

2481
01:42:21,881 --> 01:42:23,230
you man.
I don't think so.

2482
01:42:23,231 --> 01:42:26,530
But there's an article about that
recently where they were describing like

2483
01:42:26,531 --> 01:42:28,900
the dangers of neck bridging.
You know,

2484
01:42:28,901 --> 01:42:30,890
he does strengthen your neck.
Well wrestling,

2485
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:33,160
they do a lot of shit that's not great
for you.

2486
01:42:33,161 --> 01:42:35,380
I don't think rightly,
it's kind of part of the par for the

2487
01:42:35,381 --> 01:42:35,921
course.
Right.

2488
01:42:35,921 --> 01:42:39,040
With collegiate style wrestling.
Do you ever fuck with that iron neck?

2489
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:39,940
I like it.
Yeah.

2490
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:41,060
I love that.
I like it.

2491
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:46,060
I love that they use it for some dead
lifts the other day and I felt I felt

2492
01:42:46,061 --> 01:42:47,440
stronger,
legitimately felt stronger.

2493
01:42:47,470 --> 01:42:48,460
Oh,
it's phenomenal.

2494
01:42:48,461 --> 01:42:52,000
I actually used it and didn't know that
I had an issue with my neck until I used

2495
01:42:52,001 --> 01:42:53,360
it and then after I used it,
um,

2496
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:56,200
wait a second,
I can turn my head all the way now.

2497
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,750
So I think it's great.
One of the things about it is the range

2498
01:42:58,751 --> 01:43:03,280
of motion that it gives you and for
grapplers I think it is mandatory.

2499
01:43:03,281 --> 01:43:05,140
I think it would,
it's a mandatory thing for,

2500
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,330
I fucked my neck up for a bunch of
reasons.

2501
01:43:07,331 --> 01:43:10,210
One,
from being an idiot and not tapping to

2502
01:43:10,211 --> 01:43:12,460
from getting injured and still training,
but three,

2503
01:43:12,461 --> 01:43:15,040
because one of my biggest moves is the
arm triangle.

2504
01:43:15,190 --> 01:43:18,400
So in the arm triangle when you grow,
get a head and arm choke.

2505
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:20,260
When I got the art guys arm trapped
here,

2506
01:43:20,261 --> 01:43:24,160
I'm using my neck,
so I'm constantly like pinning things

2507
01:43:24,161 --> 01:43:28,420
down with my neck and you know,
you're rolling for a fucking hour a

2508
01:43:28,421 --> 01:43:30,880
night or whatever it is.
It's a lot of pressure you're putting on

2509
01:43:30,881 --> 01:43:35,020
your neck and then defending things with
your neck and everything gets inflamed

2510
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:37,930
and everything's injured and you get
these little micro injuries that never

2511
01:43:37,931 --> 01:43:40,000
really heal because you're back training
again.

2512
01:43:40,001 --> 01:43:42,240
Yeah,
the iron neck thing works great to,

2513
01:43:42,241 --> 01:43:45,700
I think we both looked at it kind of
skeptical when we first saw it and then

2514
01:43:45,701 --> 01:43:48,940
the guy did a demo for us and we both
used it and thought it was really cool.

2515
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:52,030
And you put on this from your helmet.
It looks weird and I ended up beginning,

2516
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:52,321
you're,
you're like,

2517
01:43:52,321 --> 01:43:53,330
what is this thing?
You know?

2518
01:43:53,331 --> 01:43:54,164
And then it works great.

2519
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:56,130
But I mean,
even one of those harnesses with a

2520
01:43:56,131 --> 01:43:58,250
weight,
just anything where you're,

2521
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:00,850
you know,
just constantly conditioning your neck

2522
01:44:00,851 --> 01:44:03,800
and your neck needs workout.
It really does.

2523
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:06,710
It's when you know you're serious about
trainings when you have a fucking neck

2524
01:44:06,711 --> 01:44:07,810
harness.
Yeah man.

2525
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:10,430
Yeah.
I've always had that one back in the

2526
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:12,170
day.
I'm a big believer in working out your

2527
01:44:12,171 --> 01:44:12,921
neck,
you know,

2528
01:44:12,921 --> 01:44:16,310
and John Jacques Machado,
my Jujitsu instructor is a very famous

2529
01:44:16,311 --> 01:44:17,570
quote.
He says,

2530
01:44:17,571 --> 01:44:20,150
never trust your neck.
Hmm.

2531
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:21,920
Yeah.
Never Trust your neck.

2532
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:23,390
You know,
like if you think that you'll see,

2533
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,530
you know,
if someone's choking you,

2534
01:44:24,531 --> 01:44:26,210
it's like,
don't just think that your neck is

2535
01:44:26,211 --> 01:44:27,920
strong enough to handle it.
Fuck that.

2536
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:29,780
Protect your neck.
Yeah.

2537
01:44:29,781 --> 01:44:32,120
Kurt Angle looks like he's got over 20
inch neck or something.

2538
01:44:32,121 --> 01:44:32,661
I mean,
it's cute.

2539
01:44:32,661 --> 01:44:34,880
It looks like he's pushing his head off
his fucking shoulders.

2540
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:35,481
It's,
yeah,

2541
01:44:35,481 --> 01:44:38,000
it's like two of my thighs holding his
fucking head up.

2542
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:40,640
But I mean,
it's probably just to support his neck

2543
01:44:40,641 --> 01:44:42,380
with all the injuries of the guys had.
Yeah.

2544
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:44,480
I mean,
I'm sure he's got fused disks or

2545
01:44:44,481 --> 01:44:45,720
something going on up there,
right?

2546
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:47,200
Yeah.
He got,

2547
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:48,790
he had surgery a couple of times.
He said,

2548
01:44:48,791 --> 01:44:49,311
yeah,
actually,

2549
01:44:49,311 --> 01:44:49,871
um,
you know,

2550
01:44:49,871 --> 01:44:52,270
he was addicted to drugs.
Now he's doing a big thing,

2551
01:44:52,271 --> 01:44:53,950
um,
on sobriety.

2552
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:54,531
And,
uh,

2553
01:44:54,531 --> 01:44:55,361
he was,
he was,

2554
01:44:55,361 --> 01:44:57,670
um,
heavily addicted to like opioids for a

2555
01:44:57,671 --> 01:45:01,300
long time and he actually got us our,
he actually went to the point where,

2556
01:45:01,301 --> 01:45:04,270
um,
I believe it was a situation where it

2557
01:45:04,271 --> 01:45:09,271
was either the drugs or he gets fired
and he basically got fired from ww or

2558
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:10,600
released or is con,
you know,

2559
01:45:10,601 --> 01:45:11,980
whatever,
whatever happened.

2560
01:45:11,981 --> 01:45:16,690
But I'm sort of went down a really bad
road and it's as good to see him back

2561
01:45:16,691 --> 01:45:19,150
and be held back being like,
as you know,

2562
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:21,040
as healthy as he can be at this point
because,

2563
01:45:21,041 --> 01:45:22,720
uh,
he went through a really rough time.

2564
01:45:22,721 --> 01:45:23,120
You know,

2565
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:25,070
I loved your documentary prescription
thugs,

2566
01:45:25,090 --> 01:45:28,820
and I've shown it and recommended it to
so many people.

2567
01:45:28,821 --> 01:45:32,390
I just think we live in a crazy time.
You're,

2568
01:45:32,391 --> 01:45:36,440
you're hearing all the time someone's
cousin and my brother or this guy,

2569
01:45:36,441 --> 01:45:38,480
my mom,
people get injured,

2570
01:45:38,481 --> 01:45:42,290
they get on pills and then they wind up
dying or they go down that road and they

2571
01:45:42,291 --> 01:45:43,700
become addicts.
Yeah.

2572
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:45,620
It's,
it is a fucking,

2573
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:49,040
not so silent but epidemic in this
country.

2574
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:51,980
And a lot of people feel completely
helpless because they're getting

2575
01:45:51,981 --> 01:45:55,490
prescribed these things by their doctor,
so they think they should take them.

2576
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:56,480
And then,
you know,

2577
01:45:56,481 --> 01:45:58,670
you watch your friend drift away.
I mean,

2578
01:45:58,671 --> 01:46:02,270
it happened to one of my family members.
I watched my family member go from being

2579
01:46:02,271 --> 01:46:04,370
an,
a normal guy to being a total fucking

2580
01:46:04,371 --> 01:46:06,470
loser.
And it's just because he hurt his back

2581
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:09,470
and he got hooked on pills and the next
thing you can't keep a job.

2582
01:46:09,471 --> 01:46:12,470
And he's always on the pills.
And he never did shit when I knew him,

2583
01:46:12,471 --> 01:46:15,920
I grew up with this kid.
He was totally normal and now he's all

2584
01:46:15,921 --> 01:46:16,970
fucked up and it's just,

2585
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:18,280
is he still messed up?
Yeah,

2586
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:20,550
I still fucked up.
He doesn't want to get sober.

2587
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:22,530
I can't,
I can't,

2588
01:46:22,531 --> 01:46:22,960
I don't know.

2589
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:25,240
Do you know when you're a kid,
you can't hold someone's hand?

2590
01:46:25,241 --> 01:46:26,074
You can't.
You can't.

2591
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,250
I mean,
he lives in Boston.

2592
01:46:27,251 --> 01:46:29,290
I can't fly to Boston and fucking holds
his hand

2593
01:46:29,530 --> 01:46:30,290
sharing that.
We have,

2594
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:32,660
we have a cousin who's an alcoholic and,
um,

2595
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:34,700
and he's in his thirties,
you know,

2596
01:46:34,701 --> 01:46:36,290
he needs a liver transplant and,
oh,

2597
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,530
and you still goes and drinks in this
fucking thirties.

2598
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:40,550
Yeah.
And,

2599
01:46:40,551 --> 01:46:41,510
um,
damn,

2600
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:44,000
you know,
and it's just a shame because we love

2601
01:46:44,001 --> 01:46:46,130
him and he's our cousin,
but there's nothing that we can do to

2602
01:46:46,131 --> 01:46:48,350
help him.
I've tried to help him so many times,

2603
01:46:48,351 --> 01:46:50,100
even oftener offering to

2604
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:52,650
bring them out here to go to Rehab for
free,

2605
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:54,720
um,
because of the people I know.

2606
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:56,820
And um,
he didn't take me up on it and I,

2607
01:46:56,821 --> 01:46:58,950
that kind of thing is crazy and we lost
our uncle,

2608
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:01,260
we lost her brother to from this kind of
thing.

2609
01:47:01,261 --> 01:47:02,980
And it's brutal.
Brutal.

2610
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:05,370
It runs rampant.
It does.

2611
01:47:05,371 --> 01:47:07,680
And it's so easy for people to get lost.
I mean,

2612
01:47:07,681 --> 01:47:10,260
Shab Shab broke his nose and the cro,
cop,

2613
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:12,630
cro,
cop smashed his nose with an elbow and

2614
01:47:12,631 --> 01:47:15,700
he had to get his nose reconstructed.
And when he got his nose reconstruct

2615
01:47:15,701 --> 01:47:18,360
that they put him on pills and next
thing you know he's taking those pills

2616
01:47:18,361 --> 01:47:22,050
all day long and it's four months later.
And his buddies grabbed him and they

2617
01:47:22,051 --> 01:47:23,390
went to his house and they,
they,

2618
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:26,370
they opened up as medicine cabinet,
they threw everything away and they go,

2619
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,150
this is it.

2620
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:28,890
It's over.
You're not doing this anymore,

2621
01:47:28,891 --> 01:47:29,520
man.
Fuck.

2622
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:30,271
And he's like,
you're right,

2623
01:47:30,271 --> 01:47:31,860
you're right.
And you went cold Turkey.

2624
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,370
Yeah.
And Luckily Brendan is a strong guy

2625
01:47:35,371 --> 01:47:37,740
mentally.
And he got off of it and that was it.

2626
01:47:37,741 --> 01:47:39,360
And he likes to talk about it cause
it's,

2627
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:42,060
it's an important thing because he goes,
I would have never thought that I would

2628
01:47:42,061 --> 01:47:43,890
get addicted to drugs.
It's such a sickness.

2629
01:47:43,891 --> 01:47:46,560
I remember the last,
the last time I did Percocet,

2630
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:50,250
uh,
was at a UCLA USC game and I took a

2631
01:47:50,251 --> 01:47:50,851
bunch of cars.
I was like,

2632
01:47:50,851 --> 01:47:52,590
I'm going to be sitting through this
game the whole time.

2633
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:55,530
I'll take the whole bottle.
I took 30 of them with me to this game.

2634
01:47:55,531 --> 01:47:58,830
30 30 pills.
What do you mean with me to this game?

2635
01:47:58,831 --> 01:48:02,340
This is even gets even better.
I sit down in my seat and right behind

2636
01:48:02,341 --> 01:48:07,341
me is the doctor who runs the,
who owns the clinic where I got my

2637
01:48:07,351 --> 01:48:11,490
surgery done and meanwhile I'm high like
super high talking to this doctor the

2638
01:48:11,491 --> 01:48:13,770
whole time on the pills that he
prescribed it to me.

2639
01:48:14,290 --> 01:48:16,620
You know,
I did 30 pills during that game,

2640
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:17,131
you know,
I,

2641
01:48:17,131 --> 01:48:19,560
that's crazy.
Did the doctor know that you're pilled

2642
01:48:19,561 --> 01:48:22,350
up?
I mean he would had to know.

2643
01:48:22,351 --> 01:48:23,011
I mean,
I don't know,

2644
01:48:23,011 --> 01:48:25,710
but it's kind of like it was,
we,

2645
01:48:25,711 --> 01:48:27,510
it was a weird situation,
but um,

2646
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:28,980
you know,
getting,

2647
01:48:29,010 --> 01:48:32,550
getting off those pills was,
was necessary.

2648
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:34,470
It would have ended my life for sure.
Now,

2649
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:36,660
if you had gotten a surgery tomorrow,
let's say,

2650
01:48:36,661 --> 01:48:38,760
what if your,
your hip fucked up and they had to go

2651
01:48:38,761 --> 01:48:40,980
back and Redo it?
Would you take the pain pills?

2652
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:44,130
I would do,
I would take the painkillers that as

2653
01:48:44,131 --> 01:48:46,590
long as I was in the hospital,
like whatever,

2654
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:48,720
whatever I'm supervised.
Would you be scared though,

2655
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:52,890
that you would now jump right back in?
I don't think it works that way.

2656
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:53,541
You know,
like I,

2657
01:48:53,541 --> 01:48:54,870
I don't,
I don't think it'd be,

2658
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:55,733
you know,
a trigger.

2659
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,810
Um,
but I wouldn't take them at home.

2660
01:48:57,811 --> 01:49:01,260
I'd use Kratom or something else.
And who knows?

2661
01:49:01,261 --> 01:49:04,170
I don't know how good kratom would work
after a surgery.

2662
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:05,230
Right,
right,

2663
01:49:05,230 --> 01:49:06,960
right.
We don't know how it works at them.

2664
01:49:06,961 --> 01:49:09,570
Did help you write,
helps me phenomenally.

2665
01:49:09,571 --> 01:49:10,500
Every single day.
Yeah.

2666
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:12,720
My friend cams on that stuff too.
He was a,

2667
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:15,450
he had a real problem with Ibuprofen for
awhile.

2668
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:19,140
And then Doctor Rhonda Patrick did a
podcast with me where she was talking

2669
01:49:19,141 --> 01:49:23,490
about the dangers of Ibuprofen and all
the different real severe side effects

2670
01:49:23,491 --> 01:49:25,830
that people have from real injury.
Your Gut microbiome,

2671
01:49:25,860 --> 01:49:28,500
it ruins your libido and your,
um,

2672
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,990
your sperm count too.
Well,

2673
01:49:30,991 --> 01:49:32,910
this is the,
the gut microbiome was really

2674
01:49:32,911 --> 01:49:35,820
fascinating because it causes
inflammation and he was dealing with

2675
01:49:35,821 --> 01:49:37,260
inflammation issues.
So He'd wake up,

2676
01:49:37,261 --> 01:49:38,610
his hips would hurt,
his feet would hurt,

2677
01:49:38,611 --> 01:49:40,920
his knees would hurt.
So He'd take 800 milligrams of

2678
01:49:40,921 --> 01:49:43,140
Ibuprofen.
He would do it several times a day.

2679
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,970
That's what I was doing.
But it was a cycle.

2680
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,730
So that was what was causing the
inflammation because it was fucked up as

2681
01:49:47,731 --> 01:49:48,610
gut microbiome.

2682
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:51,940
So he gets off of it and then in,
then he calls me and he's like,

2683
01:49:51,941 --> 01:49:53,230
you can't fucking believe this man.
He goes,

2684
01:49:53,231 --> 01:49:54,640
I'm off in all,
my pain's gone.

2685
01:49:55,450 --> 01:49:58,350
He kept running because he's an animal.
So he,

2686
01:49:58,390 --> 01:50:00,160
he said it's,
the pain's gone.

2687
01:50:00,161 --> 01:50:02,170
He's like,
the pain was being caused by the

2688
01:50:02,171 --> 01:50:04,420
inflammation that was caused by
Ibuprofen,

2689
01:50:04,421 --> 01:50:06,940
like holy fucking shit.
And he just thanked me.

2690
01:50:06,941 --> 01:50:08,020
He's like,
if it wasn't for Rhonda,

2691
01:50:08,021 --> 01:50:08,920
Patrick,
I,

2692
01:50:08,921 --> 01:50:10,930
you know who not mean people get
strokes.

2693
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,030
They have all sorts of funny,
right?

2694
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:13,690
You're not supposed to take that.
I mean,

2695
01:50:13,691 --> 01:50:14,970
it's fine if you take it.
I go,

2696
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:16,390
I have a headache.
Take a little Ibuprofen.

2697
01:50:16,391 --> 01:50:17,740
You'll be fine.
It's not going to kill you.

2698
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:20,980
But if you take that shit,
800 milligrams a day for a couple of

2699
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:22,510
years,
who the fuck knows what's going to do to

2700
01:50:22,511 --> 01:50:24,010
you?
Your body is not designed for

2701
01:50:24,011 --> 01:50:26,410
nonsteroidal antiinflammatories on a
daily basis,

2702
01:50:26,411 --> 01:50:29,730
on very high doses over and over and
over combined,

2703
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:31,030
you know,
the advil,

2704
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:34,150
Ibuprofen and the Acetaminophen that it
works even better.

2705
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:37,540
So that's what I was doing.
I would take about eight advil a day and

2706
01:50:37,541 --> 01:50:40,780
eight tylenol a day.
So I'm killing not only my liver,

2707
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:42,820
but my kidneys also.
And you know,

2708
01:50:42,821 --> 01:50:46,120
I've known a lot of people that have had
transplants because of that.

2709
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:49,360
Um,
have a kidney transplant because they're

2710
01:50:49,361 --> 01:50:52,000
taking too much ibuprofen now.
Um,

2711
01:50:52,090 --> 01:50:53,890
your documentary,
a leaf of faith,

2712
01:50:53,891 --> 01:50:55,780
you still doing that?
We finished it.

2713
01:50:55,781 --> 01:50:57,020
Yeah.
It comes out on,

2714
01:50:57,021 --> 01:50:59,520
on May 29th and that's all about Kratom.
Yeah,

2715
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:01,270
it's all about Kratom.
It's sort of a,

2716
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:03,550
it's really about my experience with
Kratom.

2717
01:51:03,551 --> 01:51:05,350
It's about my journey,
you know,

2718
01:51:05,351 --> 01:51:05,681
like,
Hey,

2719
01:51:05,681 --> 01:51:10,300
I was this guy who lifted weights and
did all these things and got hurt and

2720
01:51:10,301 --> 01:51:12,040
this is what happened to me.
And I just,

2721
01:51:12,041 --> 01:51:14,800
I sort of tell the story and then as I
tell the story,

2722
01:51:14,801 --> 01:51:16,150
I go out and discover,
you know,

2723
01:51:16,151 --> 01:51:17,590
is Kratom good or bad for you?

2724
01:51:17,590 --> 01:51:19,870
And we talked to,
we talked to both sides of the issue.

2725
01:51:19,871 --> 01:51:22,390
We talked to the Congress people that
are trying to ban it.

2726
01:51:22,391 --> 01:51:24,250
We talked to the ones that are trying to
save it and well,

2727
01:51:24,251 --> 01:51:25,960
they're calling it an opiate now.
Yeah.

2728
01:51:25,990 --> 01:51:27,030
They call it,
they definitely call it.

2729
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:30,380
It was a real recent,
those are recent redefinition of the

2730
01:51:30,381 --> 01:51:31,910
show that you and I did.
Um,

2731
01:51:32,170 --> 01:51:34,330
and in the movie you'll see it.
It's very pivotal.

2732
01:51:34,570 --> 01:51:37,960
Like what you do is awesome with this
podcast,

2733
01:51:37,961 --> 01:51:39,460
by the way.
But what we,

2734
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:43,960
what we were able to do from that show
is like basically you kept Kratom legal,

2735
01:51:44,190 --> 01:51:45,340
uh,
without even knowing it.

2736
01:51:45,341 --> 01:51:47,950
So we did the podcast and then after the
podcast,

2737
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:49,150
at the end of the podcast,
he said,

2738
01:51:49,151 --> 01:51:50,710
hey,
if anybody wants to help,

2739
01:51:50,711 --> 01:51:51,680
where can they go?
And I said,

2740
01:51:51,681 --> 01:51:56,590
they'd go on this website and they leave
comments for the Dea will 23,000 people

2741
01:51:56,591 --> 01:51:57,850
or maybe 24,000 people.

2742
01:51:57,850 --> 01:52:00,580
I can't remember left comments after
your podcast.

2743
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:02,530
That's amazing.
The Dea said,

2744
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:03,440
Whoa,
Whoa,

2745
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:04,720
Whoa,
wait a second.

2746
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:07,360
We can't make this illegal.
There's people go crazy.

2747
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:10,200
But what did they do recently?
They definitely classified,

2748
01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:12,640
it's totally illegal.
That was the FDA,

2749
01:52:12,641 --> 01:52:15,040
not the dea.
The FDA came out.

2750
01:52:15,041 --> 01:52:16,470
And,
um,

2751
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:17,231
because,
okay,

2752
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:22,231
so here's why really this why calls
creative and opioid and warrants against

2753
01:52:22,271 --> 01:52:23,650
using this up.
And I'll tell you why.

2754
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:25,590
It's because hunts,
uh,

2755
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:27,200
no,
no,

2756
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:30,340
not at all.
I like that the FDA is doing the right

2757
01:52:30,341 --> 01:52:31,420
thing here.
What?

2758
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:32,343
Yup.
Dare you.

2759
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:34,060
Uh,
I'll tell you what have you done with

2760
01:52:34,061 --> 01:52:35,560
Chris?
I'll tell you why.

2761
01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:39,130
A lot of people are marketing Kratom the
wrong way.

2762
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:42,520
They're packaging it the wrong way and
they are not testing it.

2763
01:52:42,521 --> 01:52:45,470
And when they're not testing it,
you have things like a salmonella

2764
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:46,670
outbreak.
I heard about that.

2765
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:47,900
That hurt,
you know,

2766
01:52:47,901 --> 01:52:50,000
put 28 people or something in the
hospital.

2767
01:52:50,001 --> 01:52:53,180
So I forget how many people,
but there was a salmonella outbreak and

2768
01:52:53,181 --> 01:52:57,620
that's because a company buys Kratom
from overseas,

2769
01:52:57,621 --> 01:53:00,350
from like Indonesia.
They get it shipped here and they don't

2770
01:53:00,351 --> 01:53:02,690
test it for contaminants,
you know.

2771
01:53:02,691 --> 01:53:06,830
So the company that I did the film with
a company called urban ice,

2772
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:10,280
they test all the products for
contaminants three times during the

2773
01:53:10,281 --> 01:53:10,911
process.
You know,

2774
01:53:10,911 --> 01:53:13,100
you own a supplement company,
you know how it works.

2775
01:53:13,101 --> 01:53:14,780
You have to test your shit
independently.

2776
01:53:14,781 --> 01:53:16,940
It's very important day party,
independent testing.

2777
01:53:16,970 --> 01:53:19,880
And that's what people aren't doing.
And so they're trying to make,

2778
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:21,650
so they make it cheaper,
you know,

2779
01:53:21,651 --> 01:53:23,420
and then the companies that are doing
it,

2780
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:27,350
that screws them because now they got to
try to make their product cheaper to

2781
01:53:27,351 --> 01:53:30,260
keep up with other people.
But they're paying for the testing each

2782
01:53:30,261 --> 01:53:30,630
time.

2783
01:53:30,630 --> 01:53:33,210
Well,
the supplement business is almost on the

2784
01:53:33,211 --> 01:53:34,580
honor system.
You know,

2785
01:53:34,581 --> 01:53:35,460
it's,
it's really,

2786
01:53:35,490 --> 01:53:38,070
it's really crazy.
My friend Aubrey,

2787
01:53:38,071 --> 01:53:42,750
whom I'm partners with an on it and uh,
he was explaining to me how those big

2788
01:53:42,751 --> 01:53:43,980
Dick pills work.
Yeah.

2789
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:44,851
Uh,
you know,

2790
01:53:44,851 --> 01:53:46,770
when you buy them at the gas station and
the hard on pills,

2791
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:51,150
he's like those pills,
most of them have cialis or Viagra and

2792
01:53:51,151 --> 01:53:51,600
I'm,
yeah.

2793
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:55,470
And so they get busted.
Somebody bust some and then once they

2794
01:53:55,471 --> 01:53:56,131
bust them,
they go,

2795
01:53:56,131 --> 01:53:56,581
oh,
sorry.

2796
01:53:56,581 --> 01:53:59,070
They changed the name of the company,
they sell it again and then they get

2797
01:53:59,071 --> 01:54:00,680
busted again.
And they just keep doing this because

2798
01:54:00,681 --> 01:54:01,514
there's a little shuffle.

2799
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:03,880
We're in the same thing with the Kratom
industry based on,

2800
01:54:03,881 --> 01:54:04,340
so what else

2801
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:06,860
Susan Kratom like if you buy Kratom
somewhere,

2802
01:54:06,861 --> 01:54:08,840
what could it possibly be other than,

2803
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:10,293
uh,
well,

2804
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:12,330
so there's this,
that happens sometimes.

2805
01:54:12,331 --> 01:54:14,460
Yeah.
And there's different acts actually

2806
01:54:14,461 --> 01:54:16,530
happened in Sweden to the point where
people died.

2807
01:54:16,531 --> 01:54:18,100
So in Sweden,
uh,

2808
01:54:18,101 --> 01:54:22,440
they put fentanyl in with Kratom's
Christ and nine nine people died.

2809
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:25,770
And I don't want to scare people off of
a have taken it because I use it every

2810
01:54:25,771 --> 01:54:26,130
day.
Well,

2811
01:54:26,130 --> 01:54:29,540
the spray company that you use,
because that was the guy that's brought

2812
01:54:29,550 --> 01:54:31,260
on the podcast,
but Nice organics,

2813
01:54:31,261 --> 01:54:33,410
that company have an ice organics.
Yeah.

2814
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:35,550
And that stuff I've used and it's great.
Yeah.

2815
01:54:35,551 --> 01:54:38,760
That their website's natural organics
with an x on the end.com.

2816
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:41,270
What's interesting to me too is that in
low doses,

2817
01:54:41,271 --> 01:54:43,700
it's actually kind of a stimulant.
Almost like a cup of coffee.

2818
01:54:43,701 --> 01:54:44,480
Yeah.
Burden,

2819
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,520
high doses.
It's more relaxing.

2820
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:47,463
Yeah.
Yeah.

2821
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,490
Do you take it?
I take it occasionally.

2822
01:54:49,550 --> 01:54:50,680
Yeah.
We have some in the back.

2823
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,140
Yeah.
Yeah,

2824
01:54:52,350 --> 01:54:53,020
yeah.
You did.

2825
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:53,950
Yeah.
And I thought,

2826
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:54,940
ah,
because you know,

2827
01:54:54,941 --> 01:54:56,110
the thing is that,
um,

2828
01:54:56,380 --> 01:54:59,980
not everybody is in pain,
but a lot of people feel stress.

2829
01:55:00,010 --> 01:55:01,360
Stress is a big deal,
you know,

2830
01:55:01,361 --> 01:55:03,430
and um,
Kratom really helps people with anxiety,

2831
01:55:03,431 --> 01:55:05,890
ptsd.
If someone has anxiety,

2832
01:55:05,891 --> 01:55:07,510
like how many pills did they take for
anxiety?

2833
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:10,510
But see I take two at a time.
I think that's the problem we're getting

2834
01:55:10,511 --> 01:55:12,760
into.
I can't really tell people that stuff

2835
01:55:12,761 --> 01:55:16,180
cause that's like illegal according to
the FDA now I can because I'm a film

2836
01:55:16,181 --> 01:55:16,841
maker.
Right,

2837
01:55:16,841 --> 01:55:17,710
right.
Um,

2838
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:20,230
so I would say take two.
But um,

2839
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:22,530
for the most part,
like a company can't tell you that like

2840
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:23,201
a,
you know,

2841
01:55:23,201 --> 01:55:26,950
you as the owner of onnit can't say take
this many pills and this whole like take

2842
01:55:26,951 --> 01:55:28,900
this much alpha brain and it'll do this
for your brain.

2843
01:55:29,030 --> 01:55:31,300
Cause you,
you say the wrong thing and the FDA's

2844
01:55:31,301 --> 01:55:32,260
all over your ass.
Right.

2845
01:55:32,270 --> 01:55:34,060
So that's,
that's an issue.

2846
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:37,270
Um,
like the way that the way that Kratom

2847
01:55:37,271 --> 01:55:40,630
needs to be marketed is like basically
the way that supplements are supposed to

2848
01:55:40,631 --> 01:55:42,400
be marketed is,
you know,

2849
01:55:42,401 --> 01:55:44,610
that you're taking it for a specific
response

2850
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:46,800
and the FDA doesn't let you tell people
that,

2851
01:55:46,801 --> 01:55:50,640
which is just really screwed up too.
Because I think that that's a problem.

2852
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:51,510
It's like an issue.
You know,

2853
01:55:51,511 --> 01:55:53,700
like you should be able to say what it
does.

2854
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:56,280
The problem is people make way too many
health claims.

2855
01:55:56,281 --> 01:56:01,020
So with Kratom they make the health
claim that it will cure opioid addiction

2856
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:04,260
and that's a huge claim to make.
And um,

2857
01:56:04,280 --> 01:56:07,830
it's a ridiculous claim to make.
It can help somebody get over an opioid

2858
01:56:07,831 --> 01:56:10,500
addiction,
but to say it cures and opioid addiction

2859
01:56:10,501 --> 01:56:11,610
or to say that it,
uh,

2860
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:14,910
even even will cure your pain or help
your pain.

2861
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:18,570
Those are bigger claims then supplements
are allowed to make.

2862
01:56:18,571 --> 01:56:21,030
And that's the issue with people coming
down on it.

2863
01:56:21,090 --> 01:56:24,660
But is the thing like what helps you
over an addiction?

2864
01:56:24,661 --> 01:56:26,460
There's so many factors.
First of all,

2865
01:56:26,461 --> 01:56:27,290
there's genetics.

2866
01:56:27,290 --> 01:56:29,610
Some people have a genetic propensity
for addiction.

2867
01:56:29,670 --> 01:56:31,350
It's just the fact that runs in their
family.

2868
01:56:31,650 --> 01:56:33,450
And I don't know if that's nature and
nurture,

2869
01:56:33,451 --> 01:56:36,600
but cause I don't have it in my family,
but some people do.

2870
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:40,650
I know people that they drink one drink
and they get fucking job and they're off

2871
01:56:40,651 --> 01:56:42,040
to the races.
There was gone,

2872
01:56:42,090 --> 01:56:43,170
they disappear.
You know,

2873
01:56:43,171 --> 01:56:44,040
people like that.
Right.

2874
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:45,570
Yeah.
And there was a big difference.

2875
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:50,340
My Dad says there was a big difference
between our brother Mike and and me and

2876
01:56:50,341 --> 01:56:53,760
the way that we did it.
So I sort of fell into it.

2877
01:56:53,790 --> 01:56:57,030
But Mike was kind of always that way.
You fell into it because of surgery

2878
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:59,950
because surgery and constant pain
because if you have,

2879
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,910
Mike fell into it cause he was a
osteoarthritis arthritis,

2880
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:07,050
our brother mad dog,
he fell into it because he was animal.

2881
01:57:07,470 --> 01:57:08,860
He just,
he was always that guy.

2882
01:57:09,110 --> 01:57:10,110
Yeah,
he was,

2883
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:13,530
you know,
the guy who's like the king of the

2884
01:57:13,531 --> 01:57:15,420
school ahead of everything.
That was mad dog.

2885
01:57:15,421 --> 01:57:16,440
He was always,
you know,

2886
01:57:16,441 --> 01:57:19,050
always in charge.
Always had the most friends,

2887
01:57:19,051 --> 01:57:20,400
was super popular,
you know.

2888
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:22,530
But there was something,
some void inside,

2889
01:57:22,531 --> 01:57:25,590
something missing that would turn them
to drugs and alcohol.

2890
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:29,340
Man.
It's like when you know someone that has

2891
01:57:29,341 --> 01:57:31,980
that,
it is such a helpless feeling because

2892
01:57:31,981 --> 01:57:33,390
there's not a goddamn thing you can do
about it.

2893
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:35,460
I first experienced it when I was in
high school.

2894
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:38,640
Um,
my dad was an architect and a,

2895
01:57:38,641 --> 01:57:43,641
I got a lot of gigs over the summer
working on construction sites and so I

2896
01:57:43,771 --> 01:57:47,010
would hang out with a lot of these guys
that were carpenters and laborers and

2897
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,350
this one guy that I've worked with is a
great guy,

2898
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:51,600
but he couldn't fucking lay off the
coke.

2899
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:52,380
Yeah,
couldn't,

2900
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:53,520
he would get clean.
He was like,

2901
01:57:53,521 --> 01:57:55,080
this is it.
I'm getting my band together.

2902
01:57:55,081 --> 01:57:56,190
I'd be like,
that's awesome man.

2903
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:58,650
Good for you.
And then he would come in,

2904
01:57:58,651 --> 01:58:01,290
hung over,
fucked up like it just looks like he had

2905
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:05,210
the flu and it's dark.
It's dark and it's dark and stop.

2906
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:08,010
You keep going back to it.
I used to go in my bathroom in the

2907
01:58:08,011 --> 01:58:10,860
morning hungover every day,
look in the mirror and go,

2908
01:58:10,861 --> 01:58:15,861
who the fuck are you?
Like what is that fat gross wrinkly old

2909
01:58:16,651 --> 01:58:19,110
dude doing in the mirror?
Like what happened to you?

2910
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:21,930
You're,
you're a movie was 96% on rotten

2911
01:58:21,931 --> 01:58:24,480
tomatoes about,
about steroids and,

2912
01:58:24,481 --> 01:58:27,420
and health and,
and trying to figure out if this is good

2913
01:58:27,421 --> 01:58:30,690
or bad for you and now you're just a
fucked up drug addict.

2914
01:58:30,810 --> 01:58:34,440
And I would just cry.
And I had nothing like nowhere to turn.

2915
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:37,980
I felt like I couldn't tell my parents
because they just experienced it.

2916
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:41,410
I felt like I couldn't tell my brother
cause he's in the fitness and training

2917
01:58:41,411 --> 01:58:42,040
and he's going to be like,

2918
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,270
come on dude,
snap out of it.

2919
01:58:43,271 --> 01:58:44,630
You know how that's possible.
It's what I,

2920
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:47,800
it's what I thought.
But what I thought didn't happen as soon

2921
01:58:47,801 --> 01:58:49,120
as mark found out about it,
he said,

2922
01:58:49,121 --> 01:58:50,860
come here,
give me a big hug and say,

2923
01:58:50,861 --> 01:58:51,694
well,
we're going to help you.

2924
01:58:51,820 --> 01:58:52,210
You know?
And,

2925
01:58:52,210 --> 01:58:55,660
and I think that's most people's fear is
that it's going to be really bad.

2926
01:58:56,050 --> 01:58:57,760
But I should tell everybody it's going
to be really,

2927
01:58:57,761 --> 01:59:00,670
really good when you come out.
That other side of wife was a big part

2928
01:59:00,671 --> 01:59:03,940
of it and the advice I always give and
we try to always give is just don't give

2929
01:59:03,941 --> 01:59:05,290
up on people.
You can't,

2930
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:08,050
you,
you don't want to overextend yourself

2931
01:59:08,051 --> 01:59:10,720
because you are going to get fucked over
by people that are addicts.

2932
01:59:10,721 --> 01:59:12,350
You will get screwed over.
Um,

2933
01:59:12,490 --> 01:59:13,810
but you just tell him,
hey,

2934
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:15,280
whenever you're ready,
I'm here to help.

2935
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:17,290
Whatever way I can help.
If I can help financially,

2936
01:59:17,291 --> 01:59:18,610
if I can help,
uh,

2937
01:59:18,910 --> 01:59:20,260
you know,
whatever way I can help,

2938
01:59:20,290 --> 01:59:21,880
I'm here to help.
Just let them know.

2939
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,720
And then that way you can always at
least feel good that you,

2940
01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:27,520
you at least did some of your part there
in with him,

2941
01:59:27,850 --> 01:59:31,150
my wife was like,
we got to get him the hell out of Los

2942
01:59:31,150 --> 01:59:32,140
Angeles.
We live in Sacramento.

2943
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:33,370
She's like,
we got to get them up here.

2944
01:59:33,371 --> 01:59:35,740
So we flew him up just so you can keep
an eye on them.

2945
01:59:35,770 --> 01:59:37,840
Not that Sacramento is not without its
temptation.

2946
01:59:37,841 --> 01:59:38,890
That's a hundred,
a hundred percent.

2947
01:59:39,150 --> 01:59:42,790
Just a not be on his own was the main
thing is he doesn't have any family down

2948
01:59:42,791 --> 01:59:45,420
here and stuff.
And so we did that and took him under is

2949
01:59:45,790 --> 01:59:47,680
under our wing and um,
you know,

2950
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:48,970
got him lifting and the Diet.

2951
01:59:48,970 --> 01:59:53,110
I think everything,
I think everything helped get them to

2952
01:59:53,111 --> 01:59:55,030
where he is now.
I'm so proud of him.

2953
01:59:55,390 --> 01:59:57,250
It's unbelievable.
The sounds kind of Dorky,

2954
01:59:57,251 --> 01:59:57,851
you know,
in some way.

2955
01:59:57,851 --> 02:00:00,640
Cause he's my bro folks.
We're supposed to talk shit about each

2956
02:00:00,641 --> 02:00:01,570
other all the time,
you know,

2957
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:04,790
but I am really proud of him and he's
been an idol of mine sent,

2958
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,040
you know,
since I was a little kid.

2959
02:00:06,041 --> 02:00:09,370
He's the reason why I lift.
He's in reason why I laughed so hard and

2960
02:00:09,371 --> 02:00:11,620
he'll get motivated by me and he'll say,
dude,

2961
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:13,150
I saw you doing that crazy shit.
He's like,

2962
02:00:13,151 --> 02:00:16,250
I'm going to go in and dead lift.
But it's really him that's motivating

2963
02:00:16,251 --> 02:00:17,890
me.
He's the driver of a lot of this.

2964
02:00:18,190 --> 02:00:18,950
Well,
um,

2965
02:00:18,950 --> 02:00:21,760
you've,
you really do look a lot healthier than

2966
02:00:21,761 --> 02:00:22,790
when I first,
I think it looks,

2967
02:00:22,791 --> 02:00:24,390
it's fucking awesome.
Thanks for both.

2968
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:27,390
I'm getting showered and prays over
while I was like,

2969
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:28,840
you look good man.
Thank you man.

2970
02:00:28,841 --> 02:00:30,890
I really appreciate it.
Someone you see them,

2971
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:33,060
they just look vibrant.
You know,

2972
02:00:33,130 --> 02:00:34,530
you can tell when someone's healthy.
That's all.

2973
02:00:34,531 --> 02:00:36,190
I first started getting sober.
It was hard,

2974
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:37,001
you know,
he,

2975
02:00:37,001 --> 02:00:38,710
he was losing weight,
he was doing everything,

2976
02:00:38,770 --> 02:00:39,790
you know,
he's doing everything good,

2977
02:00:39,791 --> 02:00:43,210
but he still was getting sick all the
time and he looked sickly,

2978
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:43,931
you know,
and I was like,

2979
02:00:43,931 --> 02:00:44,764
man,
is he,

2980
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:47,110
is he telling me the truth?
Is He really doing okay?

2981
02:00:47,111 --> 02:00:48,880
And it took time.
It took a long time.

2982
02:00:48,881 --> 02:00:52,770
The best thing for me is being able to
give back and um,

2983
02:00:52,930 --> 02:00:56,350
being able to come on this podcast and I
know after this podcast I'm going to

2984
02:00:56,351 --> 02:00:58,720
hit,
get hit up on social media a million

2985
02:00:58,721 --> 02:01:00,010
times and it'd be like,
Bro,

2986
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:01,090
I'm dying.

2987
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:04,210
I'm sick.
I'm drunk right now.

2988
02:01:04,450 --> 02:01:07,810
I'm crying and I'll,
and be like,

2989
02:01:07,811 --> 02:01:08,850
call me.
You know what I mean?

2990
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:10,570
I'll call these people.
That's awesome.

2991
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:13,360
I literally called them and they say,
I can't even believe I'm talking to you.

2992
02:01:13,361 --> 02:01:14,950
And I'm like,
I'm just a normal dude,

2993
02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:17,200
you know,
trick of the microphone.

2994
02:01:17,201 --> 02:01:17,861
Right?
Yeah.

2995
02:01:17,861 --> 02:01:20,770
And,
and so what's really beautiful is being

2996
02:01:20,771 --> 02:01:22,900
able to help these people.
And then,

2997
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:25,360
you know,
forgetting about these people because

2998
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:28,600
there's so many of them.
There's hundreds of emails and texts and

2999
02:01:28,601 --> 02:01:29,740
things at porn.
So you,

3000
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:30,450
you,
uh,

3001
02:01:30,450 --> 02:01:32,680
you help them and then you move on to
the next guy.

3002
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:35,140
But then three or four months later you
get this,

3003
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:36,880
you know,
thank you letter.

3004
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:38,380
You know that that says like,
Hey,

3005
02:01:38,381 --> 02:01:39,980
I completely turned my life around.
I'm

3006
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,750
completely fine now.
You know what?

3007
02:01:41,751 --> 02:01:45,530
I'm sure some of them still go the other
way and you can't save everybody and

3008
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:46,970
yeah,
you can't help everybody,

3009
02:01:46,971 --> 02:01:48,140
but you sure can try,
you know,

3010
02:01:48,220 --> 02:01:49,870
well,
you definitely make an impact and

3011
02:01:49,871 --> 02:01:51,880
podcasts like this always make an
impact.

3012
02:01:51,881 --> 02:01:53,920
There's people out there that are
listening right now and they might be in

3013
02:01:53,921 --> 02:01:55,750
their car,
they might be sitting at home just

3014
02:01:55,751 --> 02:01:57,340
trying to figure out what the fuck to do
with their life.

3015
02:01:57,610 --> 02:02:00,250
Sometimes all people need is that little
extra juice,

3016
02:02:00,490 --> 02:02:02,680
that little extra motivation that they
get from here.

3017
02:02:02,730 --> 02:02:06,250
Somebody like yourself that's gone
through it and came out on the other

3018
02:02:06,251 --> 02:02:07,510
side healthy and you're like,
fuck.

3019
02:02:07,511 --> 02:02:09,730
If he was crying,
looking in the mirror and feeling like

3020
02:02:09,731 --> 02:02:11,780
shit,
and he was addicted to drugs and,

3021
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:12,560
and,
and,

3022
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:15,810
and he came from a healthy background
and he came from a background where he's

3023
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:17,350
making a documentary about health.

3024
02:02:17,610 --> 02:02:19,470
When it got really bad,
um,

3025
02:02:19,770 --> 02:02:20,603
you know,
when,

3026
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:22,950
when you start drinking in the morning,
it's really bad.

3027
02:02:23,370 --> 02:02:23,870
And,
uh,

3028
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:27,930
alcohol became the worst part of it.
Worse than worse than even the pills.

3029
02:02:27,931 --> 02:02:31,680
And I just remember,
and they start selling alcohol in La at

3030
02:02:31,681 --> 02:02:34,230
6:00 AM.
And I remember I used to live right

3031
02:02:34,231 --> 02:02:37,740
across from Gold's gym in Venice.
And I get up and I walk across the

3032
02:02:37,741 --> 02:02:42,450
street at like five 45 because my car
was parked.

3033
02:02:42,570 --> 02:02:44,370
I had to park across the street right by
the gym.

3034
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:47,940
I walk across the street over by the gym
and I'd see my friends going into the

3035
02:02:47,941 --> 02:02:49,800
gym for a workout and they'd be like,
Hey Chris,

3036
02:02:49,801 --> 02:02:50,591
what's going on?
You know,

3037
02:02:50,591 --> 02:02:51,241
I,
but be waving them.

3038
02:02:51,241 --> 02:02:54,530
I'd be going to the liquor store.
And that's when I knew it was like

3039
02:02:54,540 --> 02:02:56,490
really bad things needed to change.
So,

3040
02:02:56,910 --> 02:02:57,743
you know,
I,

3041
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:59,940
I really do think that,
like you said,

3042
02:02:59,970 --> 02:03:02,610
um,
it takes somebody just like that little

3043
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:04,530
thing.
So if there's people out there that are

3044
02:03:04,531 --> 02:03:07,860
listening to this,
just hit me up or hit up somebody and

3045
02:03:07,861 --> 02:03:09,870
tell them that you're hurting because
people will help you.

3046
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:10,830
You need other people.

3047
02:03:10,830 --> 02:03:11,880
Well,
you're not going to do it on your own.

3048
02:03:12,090 --> 02:03:13,560
Everybody needs other people,
period.

3049
02:03:13,850 --> 02:03:15,930
That's this idea of the lone wolf is
total here.

3050
02:03:16,230 --> 02:03:19,410
I need the help other people in order
for me to be fulfilled for sure.

3051
02:03:19,411 --> 02:03:20,100
You know,
so,

3052
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:21,240
yeah.
Yeah.

3053
02:03:21,241 --> 02:03:22,350
I mean,
we're all,

3054
02:03:22,351 --> 02:03:24,660
we're all together in this thing.
Yeah.

3055
02:03:24,661 --> 02:03:26,610
When having him at,
at my house,

3056
02:03:26,611 --> 02:03:27,930
you know,
really helped me a lot too.

3057
02:03:27,931 --> 02:03:31,080
Just just knowing that he was safe and
knowing he was doing the right thing.

3058
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:32,580
I'm married,
I've got two kids.

3059
02:03:32,581 --> 02:03:33,870
I don't fuck around.
I train,

3060
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:36,060
I fucking eat,
try to eat healthy.

3061
02:03:36,061 --> 02:03:38,130
I try to do the best I can each and
every day.

3062
02:03:38,131 --> 02:03:40,860
And having him with me made me more
accountable.

3063
02:03:40,861 --> 02:03:42,380
It made me more,
you know,

3064
02:03:42,390 --> 02:03:45,840
more full bore about everything.
So it worked out good for both of us.

3065
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:49,110
Did you ever investigate Ibogaine?
Yeah,

3066
02:03:49,230 --> 02:03:50,820
I looked into it.
I talked to the top.

3067
02:03:50,850 --> 02:03:53,160
I knew,
I do know the top a researcher on

3068
02:03:53,161 --> 02:03:54,690
Ibogaine,
a doctor,

3069
02:03:54,691 --> 02:03:55,524
Deborah Mash.

3070
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:57,420
Explain what that stuff is and what it
can do.

3071
02:03:57,450 --> 02:04:00,360
Ibogaine is a substance that you get it
from Africa,

3072
02:04:00,750 --> 02:04:03,870
found an Africa and basically you can
you drink it.

3073
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:06,900
I think they make up some sort of potion
or whatever and you drink it.

3074
02:04:06,901 --> 02:04:11,901
And then literally what to turn a 20
year heroin addict around in about a

3075
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:15,900
day,
about 36 hours they say.

3076
02:04:16,140 --> 02:04:17,700
And they,
they go through some ritual.

3077
02:04:17,701 --> 02:04:19,350
I'm not sure if the ritual does
anything.

3078
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:21,570
Uh,
the doctor didn't even really know if

3079
02:04:21,571 --> 02:04:23,400
the ritual does data anything,
but it's part of the,

3080
02:04:23,401 --> 02:04:27,030
a placebo I guess.
But it seems to really work.

3081
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:29,400
It's a schedule one drug here in
America.

3082
02:04:29,401 --> 02:04:31,200
You can't get it here.
Uh,

3083
02:04:31,201 --> 02:04:34,710
it's,
it's actually fairly safe compared to a

3084
02:04:34,711 --> 02:04:37,380
lot of other things.
So there's been some deaths it,

3085
02:04:37,381 --> 02:04:38,100
but it like maybe

3086
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:43,100
15 all time or something like not,
not super high and it definitely needs

3087
02:04:43,141 --> 02:04:45,870
to be medically supervised,
but I don't think it should be illegal

3088
02:04:45,871 --> 02:04:46,830
in all.
I think it should be.

3089
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:50,190
I think Ibogaine and Kratom or the
answers to the opioid epidemic,

3090
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:51,190
well,
I began,

3091
02:04:51,190 --> 02:04:56,190
has an incredibly high rate of success
in terms of like people taking nine

3092
02:04:57,791 --> 02:05:00,000
began getting off pills.
I think Ibogaine is incredible.

3093
02:05:00,001 --> 02:05:01,430
I think Ed Clay,
uh,

3094
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:03,330
opened up a clinic.
He went down,

3095
02:05:03,331 --> 02:05:06,510
he had a issue with pills as well and
I'm pretty sure,

3096
02:05:06,511 --> 02:05:09,150
I don't want to speak out of school,
but I'm pretty sure his came also from

3097
02:05:09,151 --> 02:05:12,600
an injury and then he got a,
had a pill problem and then was trying

3098
02:05:12,601 --> 02:05:16,860
to figure out what the fuck to do with
it and went down to Mexico,

3099
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:19,530
went to an Ibogaine clinic and then
said,

3100
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:21,900
wow,
this is fixed him up.

3101
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:23,280
Totally.
And then,

3102
02:05:23,310 --> 02:05:24,570
uh,
opened up his own clinic.

3103
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:26,730
That's awesome.
One thing I didn't understand is I

3104
02:05:26,731 --> 02:05:30,570
interviewed this doctor Deborah Mash,
and it's probably because she's in

3105
02:05:30,571 --> 02:05:33,120
Florida,
she's tied in with politicians,

3106
02:05:33,210 --> 02:05:37,260
which is always a problem.
And so she's 100% for Ibogaine,

3107
02:05:37,261 --> 02:05:41,610
but she's also against Kratom,
which makes no sense because she thinks

3108
02:05:41,611 --> 02:05:42,390
that,
uh,

3109
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:43,970
you know,
Kratom is a,

3110
02:05:44,230 --> 02:05:46,080
you know,
because I will gain,

3111
02:05:46,081 --> 02:05:48,000
you have to go get it medically
supervising,

3112
02:05:48,001 --> 02:05:50,520
medically done.
And She just thinks like giving people

3113
02:05:50,521 --> 02:05:53,700
Kratom is a loosey Goosey kind of stuff,
man.

3114
02:05:53,701 --> 02:05:57,930
I'm 100% for clinics opening up and then
giving them under the doctors and give

3115
02:05:57,931 --> 02:06:01,050
the money to the state.
If you can get Ibogaine to the hands of

3116
02:06:01,051 --> 02:06:03,930
a lot of these people,
it's so ruthlessly introspective.

3117
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:06,690
Not from my personal experience,
but arbors taken it.

3118
02:06:06,930 --> 02:06:09,000
I know several people who had taken it.

3119
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,850
I know several people that have taken it
and it's completely turned their life

3120
02:06:11,851 --> 02:06:16,851
around where they had this intense 24
hour experience where you just examine

3121
02:06:18,061 --> 02:06:21,090
every single aspect of your life and
this really alien way.

3122
02:06:21,091 --> 02:06:22,410
And then after it's over,
you're like,

3123
02:06:22,411 --> 02:06:25,440
I am never fucking drinking again.
Or I'm never taken dance again.

3124
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:30,420
And they really do change their life.
And it's also not just an introspective

3125
02:06:30,421 --> 02:06:33,450
experience,
but it also rewires the way your brain

3126
02:06:33,451 --> 02:06:37,350
handles the addiction.
I'm not qualified to speak how,

3127
02:06:37,351 --> 02:06:39,020
cause I don't really understand it.
I don't,

3128
02:06:39,070 --> 02:06:43,050
I don't know if anybody understands it.
Actually we could explain it.

3129
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:47,430
Aubrey can explain the mechanism.
There's of some sort of a shift.

3130
02:06:47,730 --> 02:06:50,520
See if we could find that.
How does Ibogaine cure addiction?

3131
02:06:50,630 --> 02:06:53,940
So if you could find that,
but it's incredibly effective.

3132
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:55,860
I mean,
I wash it highest rates of,

3133
02:06:56,060 --> 02:06:57,210
of a success.

3134
02:06:57,600 --> 02:07:00,990
Another super high rate of success that
we might be getting in California.

3135
02:07:01,630 --> 02:07:05,150
It's on the ballot in 2018 is legalizing
psilocybin.

3136
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:09,570
If they gonna legalize silicide been,
that can fix a lot of fucking people

3137
02:07:09,571 --> 02:07:11,160
too.
And that's also something that you don't

3138
02:07:11,161 --> 02:07:12,230
die from.
Nobody.

3139
02:07:12,270 --> 02:07:16,350
Nobody's overdosing on psilocybin.
The ld 50 rate is something like 1500.

3140
02:07:16,351 --> 02:07:17,640
What does that,
what does that do?

3141
02:07:17,970 --> 02:07:19,890
What does it,
what does the magic mushrooms,

3142
02:07:20,030 --> 02:07:20,420
yeah.
And,

3143
02:07:20,420 --> 02:07:21,380
and that's for,
um,

3144
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:22,470
mental health,
right?

3145
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:26,820
Fermentable Johns Hopkins University did
some studies on it and one of the things

3146
02:07:26,821 --> 02:07:30,930
they found his soldiers with ptsd.
This is one thing that maps is

3147
02:07:30,931 --> 02:07:34,470
concentrating on now,
especially soldiers with ptsd and

3148
02:07:34,471 --> 02:07:37,660
anybody with Ptsd,
rape victims of a violent assault

3149
02:07:37,661 --> 02:07:38,360
victims.
You know,

3150
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:42,760
some people have some real hard time
getting past past events and um,

3151
02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:45,790
psilocybin has incredible effects on
that,

3152
02:07:45,910 --> 02:07:50,260
but Mtma also does and right now maps is
involved in some pretty heavy clinical

3153
02:07:50,261 --> 02:07:51,790
trials with Mtma.

3154
02:07:52,030 --> 02:07:53,140
And um,
they're,

3155
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:58,170
they think 2021 is around the time where
they're going to have mtma clinics and

3156
02:07:58,631 --> 02:08:01,750
then it'll be legal because we have so
many soldiers that are coming back from

3157
02:08:01,751 --> 02:08:05,200
war and they're all fucked up and they
have no solutions and put these people

3158
02:08:05,201 --> 02:08:07,450
on pills and antidepressants and all
these different things,

3159
02:08:07,670 --> 02:08:11,770
anti anxiety medication,
psilocybin and MDM may have shown to

3160
02:08:11,771 --> 02:08:13,720
have massive,
powerful,

3161
02:08:13,810 --> 02:08:16,150
beneficial effects.
That's something that I really want to

3162
02:08:16,151 --> 02:08:18,370
do.
I want to do the MDM a treatment I think

3163
02:08:18,371 --> 02:08:18,880
that,
um,

3164
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:21,190
would a lot of people don't understand
is when you have an addiction,

3165
02:08:21,370 --> 02:08:24,100
there's like these,
there's deep seated things in your,

3166
02:08:24,101 --> 02:08:28,570
in your mind and your subconscious that
drive you to go to the pills or go to

3167
02:08:28,571 --> 02:08:31,420
the drinks or whatever.
And it doesn't just go away when you get

3168
02:08:31,421 --> 02:08:33,760
sober.
You sort of work a lot of it out.

3169
02:08:34,630 --> 02:08:36,820
But some of the subconscious stuff you
can't work out.

3170
02:08:36,821 --> 02:08:37,631
So I'm like,
man,

3171
02:08:37,631 --> 02:08:38,710
there's,
there's still things,

3172
02:08:38,711 --> 02:08:41,480
habits I don't like about myself.
There's still things I want to fix.

3173
02:08:41,481 --> 02:08:43,460
And I let me connect you to Aubrey
because he loves it.

3174
02:08:43,461 --> 02:08:45,550
Yeah.
He's really tight with those guys that

3175
02:08:45,551 --> 02:08:47,020
are in the middle of those studies right
now.

3176
02:08:47,021 --> 02:08:51,010
And he's actually gone through that
protocol and then operate a little bit.

3177
02:08:51,011 --> 02:08:52,550
Yeah.
Do you have his number?

3178
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:55,780
Let me contact him and talk to him about
it because he's,

3179
02:08:55,781 --> 02:08:57,160
he's deep in this stuff.
You know,

3180
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:00,800
Ombre who's introduced me to him when I
went down to your gym on a gym?

3181
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:02,170
Yeah.
He's a,

3182
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:04,240
what I would call real psychedelic
warrior.

3183
02:09:04,370 --> 02:09:07,390
And he's in there,
he's in there all the time and with some

3184
02:09:07,391 --> 02:09:09,160
crazy shit,
you know,

3185
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:11,470
but there's the real benefits from it.
I mean,

3186
02:09:11,471 --> 02:09:13,000
real legit benefits.

3187
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,510
And we've been,
we've been really robbed and it's,

3188
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:17,770
it's terrible.
I mean,

3189
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:20,920
we've been lied to.
We've been robbed and there's a lot of

3190
02:09:20,921 --> 02:09:24,040
people that use them recreationally.
And I'm not against that,

3191
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:24,911
you know?
I mean,

3192
02:09:24,911 --> 02:09:26,470
I think you should be able do whatever
the fuck you want.

3193
02:09:26,471 --> 02:09:28,840
If you can drink whiskey recreationally,
which I do,

3194
02:09:29,170 --> 02:09:31,580
I don't think there's anything wrong
with doing mushrooms recreationally.

3195
02:09:31,581 --> 02:09:33,400
And there's some people that think it's
terrible and you should,

3196
02:09:33,630 --> 02:09:36,550
there are a sacrament.
We still use them in a ritual and a

3197
02:09:36,551 --> 02:09:38,110
shamonic setting.
I say,

3198
02:09:38,111 --> 02:09:41,050
you should do that too if you want.
But I've used it recreationally.

3199
02:09:41,051 --> 02:09:45,160
I've had a great old fucking time and
also came out of it with some insight

3200
02:09:45,161 --> 02:09:47,830
and some,
a different way of looking at myself and

3201
02:09:47,831 --> 02:09:49,330
looking at my life.
Do you know that,

3202
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:52,000
um,
in this country you have to list

3203
02:09:52,001 --> 02:09:56,020
euphoria as a side effect to a
supplement or a drug wrestle area.

3204
02:09:56,020 --> 02:09:59,020
So euphoria is something that we all
should have.

3205
02:09:59,050 --> 02:10:00,400
Like we should all be happy,
right?

3206
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:03,870
So they're listed as a side effect as if
it's a bad thing they experienced you

3207
02:10:03,871 --> 02:10:04,870
for ya.
Oh Shit,

3208
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:07,300
I better not take that right.
Super fucking habit.

3209
02:10:07,301 --> 02:10:10,540
And don't you think the things that
induce euphoria we should be,

3210
02:10:10,630 --> 02:10:12,040
we should be handing those out like
crazy.

3211
02:10:12,490 --> 02:10:15,250
People are too angry.
He thinks these pills or maybe like

3212
02:10:15,251 --> 02:10:18,670
rehab pills kind of in a way like almost
like treatment pills because they help

3213
02:10:18,671 --> 02:10:19,720
you,
you know,

3214
02:10:19,721 --> 02:10:23,210
look from the inside out almost.
Well for sure with MDA,

3215
02:10:23,230 --> 02:10:26,200
which you get in pill form,
it's actually made from the bark of a

3216
02:10:26,201 --> 02:10:28,300
tree from,
didn't we go over this the other day

3217
02:10:28,450 --> 02:10:30,340
where the fucks are from Malaysia or
some shit,

3218
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:33,470
something like that.
There's a tree and that there's a real

3219
02:10:33,471 --> 02:10:34,100
issue

3220
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:34,740
now,
uh,

3221
02:10:34,740 --> 02:10:38,480
in this country where this bark is,
because you know,

3222
02:10:38,481 --> 02:10:42,440
this fucking wars going on to try to get
this tree and it's not a very common

3223
02:10:42,441 --> 02:10:43,400
tree either.
It's like,

3224
02:10:43,730 --> 02:10:44,541
I mean,
it's rare.

3225
02:10:44,541 --> 02:10:46,910
And we were,
we could be in a situation where they

3226
02:10:46,911 --> 02:10:50,180
chopped down all the fucking trees that
make ecstasy before we make it legal.

3227
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:53,660
They did it with Kratom in Thailand.
So Thailand made kratom illegal because

3228
02:10:53,661 --> 02:10:56,570
it was cutting into the heroin,
the heroin trade,

3229
02:10:57,290 --> 02:11:00,950
this is back in 1947.
They made it illegal and cut down almost

3230
02:11:00,951 --> 02:11:04,250
all the Kratom trees.
And if you see the documentary that um,

3231
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:07,520
uh,
the guy did on Vice Morris Hamilton

3232
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:08,151
Morrison was,
yeah,

3233
02:11:08,151 --> 02:11:10,140
he did the Pharmacopoeia.
Yeah.

3234
02:11:10,370 --> 02:11:14,600
Shell on Kratom and he goes to Thailand
to find like the only remaining Kratom

3235
02:11:14,601 --> 02:11:15,620
tree.
And he like,

3236
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:19,420
he finds it and wow drinks the real
kratom and all stuff like that.

3237
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:21,710
It was really kind of fascinating that
they,

3238
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:23,510
that they did that.
So now it all comes from like,

3239
02:11:23,560 --> 02:11:24,321
you know,
Malaysia,

3240
02:11:24,321 --> 02:11:26,930
Indonesia,
whenever it is crazy that they tried to

3241
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:30,740
stop the one thing that's safe because
it was cutting into the fucking opium

3242
02:11:30,741 --> 02:11:31,574
market.
Yeah,

3243
02:11:31,610 --> 02:11:33,530
of course.
I like crate them too.

3244
02:11:33,531 --> 02:11:35,110
I use it before I work out a lot of
times.

3245
02:11:35,170 --> 02:11:35,871
You really?
Yeah.

3246
02:11:35,871 --> 02:11:39,500
And even just for creativity,
just like if I want to just sit down and

3247
02:11:39,501 --> 02:11:41,750
write or think of new products or
whatever,

3248
02:11:41,751 --> 02:11:44,000
it might be one,
two in that way.

3249
02:11:44,020 --> 02:11:45,770
How so?
I like it a lot.

3250
02:11:45,970 --> 02:11:47,750
Um,
I don't know exactly what it does.

3251
02:11:47,751 --> 02:11:49,280
I don't know what the mechanism is
behind it,

3252
02:11:49,281 --> 02:11:52,790
but it does give me a sense of euphoria.
It does make me happier.

3253
02:11:53,060 --> 02:11:56,630
One thing I've always noticed about
training is that when you feel good,

3254
02:11:57,030 --> 02:12:00,560
um,
you can lift so much better and it just

3255
02:12:00,561 --> 02:12:03,050
makes you,
makes you feel really great because you

3256
02:12:03,051 --> 02:12:05,210
know you're trying,
you're trying to lift with some force,

3257
02:12:05,211 --> 02:12:06,740
just like you hitting these bags and
stuff,

3258
02:12:06,741 --> 02:12:08,090
you're trying to put something into it.

3259
02:12:08,540 --> 02:12:11,420
And if you can't put the mustard on it
that you want to cause your shoulder

3260
02:12:11,421 --> 02:12:13,310
hurts,
I can make you grumpy.

3261
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:15,320
But this stuff really matters to us.
So for me,

3262
02:12:15,321 --> 02:12:18,770
for for lifting wise,
it's like I feel like I can go all in.

3263
02:12:18,771 --> 02:12:22,220
I was actually just saying the other day
when I'm sitting down and I go to get

3264
02:12:22,221 --> 02:12:23,360
up,
especially after some of these like

3265
02:12:23,361 --> 02:12:25,760
squat workouts and stuff,
it's kind of slow.

3266
02:12:25,970 --> 02:12:27,380
He takes me,
takes me a minute,

3267
02:12:27,650 --> 02:12:30,380
but on Kratom boom,
I feel like I can get up and run out the

3268
02:12:30,381 --> 02:12:32,480
door.
It feels like almost,

3269
02:12:32,481 --> 02:12:34,220
I would see,
I would consider it similar to the

3270
02:12:34,221 --> 02:12:37,400
getting out of a hot tub with you feel
going into the hot tub.

3271
02:12:37,401 --> 02:12:37,791
You're like,
man,

3272
02:12:37,791 --> 02:12:39,230
my shit is just kind of,
I don't even know.

3273
02:12:39,231 --> 02:12:40,430
Everything's just stiff.
Right.

3274
02:12:40,610 --> 02:12:42,080
Can't get up and down the stairs so
good.

3275
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:46,730
I got to do the sideways a trot down the
stairs every morning and I get in the

3276
02:12:46,731 --> 02:12:51,260
hot tub and I can zing up the stairs
naked picture that sometimes I have pain

3277
02:12:51,261 --> 02:12:56,261
in my hip when I don't run hills,
they don't sense men and I've talked to

3278
02:12:56,901 --> 02:12:58,550
doctors and they don't understand it.
I say,

3279
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:01,980
look,
when I run hills every day or not every

3280
02:13:01,981 --> 02:13:03,800
day,
every week I run like two,

3281
02:13:03,801 --> 02:13:06,410
three times a week.
I got zero pain in that hip.

3282
02:13:06,980 --> 02:13:09,110
Could just be getting a lot of blood,
not in the hip flexor.

3283
02:13:09,111 --> 02:13:10,580
I think running hills and running,
uh,

3284
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:13,220
running in sand I think is really,
really valuable.

3285
02:13:13,221 --> 02:13:16,340
Even pushing sleds and stuff because it
slows us down,

3286
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:19,700
not that running is running can be great
sprints can be great,

3287
02:13:19,701 --> 02:13:22,760
but regular sprints for some of us who
are over 40

3288
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:28,010
and you haven't sprinted in a long time,
probably not a great idea but to run up

3289
02:13:28,011 --> 02:13:31,200
a hill or to sprint up a hill,
it makes you go slower because the

3290
02:13:31,201 --> 02:13:32,040
intensity is higher

3291
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:35,490
and it doesn't seem it's,
well I think that's it but it's also,

3292
02:13:35,491 --> 02:13:40,110
I'm putting all this extra muscle around
my hip and my ass like there's something

3293
02:13:40,111 --> 02:13:42,130
about that's great,
thank you very much.

3294
02:13:44,430 --> 02:13:46,920
But it's something about running up
hills that like,

3295
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:48,990
dude,
I take a couple of weeks off,

3296
02:13:48,991 --> 02:13:52,590
like I was sick for a week and then the
week before that I was doing a lot of

3297
02:13:52,591 --> 02:13:56,600
other different shit and I didn't and it
starts to like get at me reverse hyper

3298
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:59,970
doesn't help with that.
Would that would make him a hip.

3299
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:04,770
It's going to front of the hip side to
side on that is you've got to get in on

3300
02:14:04,771 --> 02:14:06,390
that hip circle.
Hip Circle.

3301
02:14:06,510 --> 02:14:07,350
What's a show yet?
Oh,

3302
02:14:07,351 --> 02:14:08,160
band.
Yeah,

3303
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:09,100
the hip Ben.
Yeah.

3304
02:14:09,110 --> 02:14:09,960
Yeah.
Those are great.

3305
02:14:09,990 --> 02:14:12,240
It'll help you that help build up that
side ass.

3306
02:14:12,241 --> 02:14:13,470
I like to call.
Is that what it is?

3307
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:16,620
I'm telling you man,
there's nothing like running up hills

3308
02:14:16,621 --> 02:14:18,960
and the hills that I run,
it's all rocky terrain.

3309
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:22,260
Some jumping from one rock to the next
and it's steep like that.

3310
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:24,480
So I'm running up and um,
you know,

3311
02:14:24,481 --> 02:14:26,460
I have to take a couple of breaks to get
to the top.

3312
02:14:26,461 --> 02:14:28,860
It's a half a mile up,
a half a mile in.

3313
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:31,180
I have two different courses that I run.
Um,

3314
02:14:31,370 --> 02:14:34,470
well they have several,
but the ones that I run the most,

3315
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:36,690
the full length of it,
I could,

3316
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:39,450
I could run as long as four miles or I
could do,

3317
02:14:39,451 --> 02:14:42,030
I could break it up into one or two.
Most of the time I do too.

3318
02:14:42,090 --> 02:14:44,070
How long are you runs?
Two hours,

3319
02:14:44,100 --> 02:14:46,800
uh,
to a miles takes me about 40 minutes

3320
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:50,820
because the hills,
it's not two hours.

3321
02:14:50,821 --> 02:14:51,960
I mean,
it's not 40 minutes.

3322
02:14:52,110 --> 02:14:55,080
I could run it,
probably do it.

3323
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:57,990
It's 15,
16.

3324
02:14:57,991 --> 02:14:59,520
If I was running flat,
you know,

3325
02:14:59,550 --> 02:15:01,980
I wouldn't be that hard.
But it's hills.

3326
02:15:02,370 --> 02:15:03,300
Um,
it's not really,

3327
02:15:03,301 --> 02:15:06,180
I mean I would call it running,
but it's more like hill sprints.

3328
02:15:06,210 --> 02:15:09,210
I'm just doing these roots was hill
sprints and I've read that a long time

3329
02:15:09,211 --> 02:15:12,090
ago that a lot of football players
prefer a hill sprints.

3330
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:13,680
And then I saw that,
um,

3331
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:16,890
um,
Greg Jackson and Mike Winkeljohn when

3332
02:15:16,891 --> 02:15:19,530
they train their fighters now,
but Kirky they have them run this crazy

3333
02:15:19,531 --> 02:15:21,930
mountain and they run it and run
straight up the hill.

3334
02:15:22,170 --> 02:15:24,840
And that this was like a pig thing that
they did to,

3335
02:15:24,850 --> 02:15:27,120
to really build up.
And Darren and Walter Payton,

3336
02:15:28,050 --> 02:15:30,930
Roger Craig,
this goes on and on with Damian

3337
02:15:30,930 --> 02:15:31,560
Thompson.
Uh,

3338
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:33,360
Walter Peyton used to run hills till he
throw up.

3339
02:15:33,870 --> 02:15:35,820
Yeah,
he threw up.

3340
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:38,640
I think I'm running hills is great,
especially for bigger guys.

3341
02:15:39,090 --> 02:15:42,360
Guys that are two 50 to 60 to 70 have
joint problems.

3342
02:15:42,700 --> 02:15:44,460
It's going to be really hard to get out
there and run.

3343
02:15:44,700 --> 02:15:45,420
Yeah.
Cause you're not,

3344
02:15:45,420 --> 02:15:48,330
it's not a pounding,
you're not dropping the weight down.

3345
02:15:48,330 --> 02:15:51,210
Instead you're like,
you're almost doing like lunges like

3346
02:15:51,211 --> 02:15:52,440
over and over and over again.
Right.

3347
02:15:52,441 --> 02:15:54,250
And you could walk back down the hill,
you know,

3348
02:15:54,251 --> 02:15:56,010
take your time.
You can walk back down the hill.

3349
02:15:56,011 --> 02:16:00,390
There's evidence that shows if you do
five to eight sprints and you have long

3350
02:16:00,391 --> 02:16:02,340
periods,
you can have as much rest as you want

3351
02:16:02,341 --> 02:16:04,710
between,
you'll still get great results for fat

3352
02:16:04,711 --> 02:16:05,950
burning.
So yeah,

3353
02:16:05,951 --> 02:16:08,610
he doesn't take very long to do a
workout like that.

3354
02:16:08,700 --> 02:16:10,770
It changes your cardio too.
I mean,

3355
02:16:10,771 --> 02:16:13,710
it really does force him to do shit like
that with me sometimes.

3356
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:15,930
But can you,
you can't run though,

3357
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:16,970
right?
With your bad hand.

3358
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:20,230
Not really run by pushing,
pushing a sled is really hard.

3359
02:16:21,150 --> 02:16:23,700
He has a thing called the tank,
which is a kind of an amazing,

3360
02:16:23,701 --> 02:16:25,480
a sled with wheels.
Oh,

3361
02:16:25,490 --> 02:16:26,940
you're pushing,
you put weights on it.

3362
02:16:27,210 --> 02:16:30,130
So we pushed the tank.
We do all sorts of stuff like that that,

3363
02:16:30,150 --> 02:16:31,870
um,
are different.

3364
02:16:31,871 --> 02:16:33,940
Like,
I can go on a rowing machine as fast as

3365
02:16:33,941 --> 02:16:34,830
possible.
I can go on a,

3366
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:36,040
um,
the,

3367
02:16:36,041 --> 02:16:37,090
uh,
what do you call it?

3368
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:42,500
The aerodyne bike as fast as possible.
The echo bike rogue.

3369
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:47,920
It's a fucking tank.
It's like an Airdyne on steroids.

3370
02:16:48,130 --> 02:16:51,700
It's got these big ass fucking handles
and that it looks nice.

3371
02:16:51,701 --> 02:16:53,410
It's so good.
It's so good.

3372
02:16:54,010 --> 02:16:57,730
Plus to something as simple as that and,
and those bikes that you can get them as

3373
02:16:57,731 --> 02:16:59,250
cheap as like 500 bucks.
Yeah.

3374
02:16:59,340 --> 02:17:01,540
I think it'll change your life.
Just like mark said,

3375
02:17:01,541 --> 02:17:03,690
five to eight sprints on it a day.
Yeah.

3376
02:17:03,790 --> 02:17:06,220
It's completely,
when he comes up and trained with me,

3377
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:09,220
when he comes up and trains with me,
a lot of times he'll say,

3378
02:17:09,221 --> 02:17:10,570
I can't do that.
I try to,

3379
02:17:10,660 --> 02:17:13,330
you know how everybody in these kind of
big circuits that we do and we,

3380
02:17:13,780 --> 02:17:16,210
we train our asses off and probably
sometimes overdo it,

3381
02:17:16,510 --> 02:17:18,340
but when he joins us,
a lot of times they'll say,

3382
02:17:18,341 --> 02:17:19,810
I can't do this or I can't do that.

3383
02:17:19,810 --> 02:17:20,531
I'm like,
well,

3384
02:17:20,531 --> 02:17:22,300
you don't really know unless you try it.
And I,

3385
02:17:22,540 --> 02:17:24,790
I'm sympathetic towards fake hips.
I don't have them,

3386
02:17:24,791 --> 02:17:27,130
so I don't know exactly what it's like,
but I'm like,

3387
02:17:27,131 --> 02:17:29,380
just try it or try a different variation
of it.

3388
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:31,660
And He,
he kind of won't.

3389
02:17:31,661 --> 02:17:34,420
And then he'll kind of drift off and the
next minute I'll see him,

3390
02:17:34,450 --> 02:17:37,600
I'll see him either trying it or trying
or doing some other version of it.

3391
02:17:38,140 --> 02:17:38,831
And I'm like,
all right,

3392
02:17:38,831 --> 02:17:40,300
good.
It's working cause he's at least doing

3393
02:17:40,301 --> 02:17:41,134
something.
Right.

3394
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:42,910
Do you fuck with the versaclimber?
Yeah,

3395
02:17:42,911 --> 02:17:45,050
we do that a little bit sometimes.
Stoughton's

3396
02:17:46,660 --> 02:17:48,700
hate your life.
We do a circuit with that.

3397
02:17:48,701 --> 02:17:53,230
And I have a bike that's on steroids to,
oh sh so from Australia,

3398
02:17:53,231 --> 02:17:54,590
I forget what the theme at the end
please.

3399
02:17:54,650 --> 02:17:55,810
Our two.
Oh yeah.

3400
02:17:55,811 --> 02:17:57,370
We have the uh,
uh,

3401
02:17:57,400 --> 02:17:58,240
ski Erg thing.

3402
02:17:58,260 --> 02:18:01,600
Oh those things are ruthless.
We use that and the rower and we do a

3403
02:18:01,601 --> 02:18:03,460
circuit of all,
like all three or four of those

3404
02:18:03,461 --> 02:18:04,360
exercises.
Yeah.

3405
02:18:04,480 --> 02:18:05,670
That's fucking awesome.
I got,

3406
02:18:05,671 --> 02:18:09,010
when I started editing it,
adding in a lot more things like that

3407
02:18:09,011 --> 02:18:11,050
and cardio and stuff like that because,
uh,

3408
02:18:11,190 --> 02:18:12,700
I'm 45.
He's,

3409
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:14,310
how old are you?
41 40.

3410
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:17,590
[inaudible] so as we get older,
you start looking into things where,

3411
02:18:17,591 --> 02:18:19,060
uh,
you want to be healthy,

3412
02:18:19,090 --> 02:18:20,290
you know,
I want to do it for your health.

3413
02:18:20,291 --> 02:18:22,900
So I'm thinking about those things.
A,

3414
02:18:22,930 --> 02:18:25,480
we definitely,
I don't care about power lifting

3415
02:18:25,481 --> 02:18:26,860
anymore.
I don't care about my numbers.

3416
02:18:26,861 --> 02:18:29,140
I want to lift heavy weights
consistently,

3417
02:18:29,470 --> 02:18:32,080
but I don't care what the single rep
maxes anymore.

3418
02:18:32,081 --> 02:18:32,914
It doesn't matter.
You know?

3419
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:36,880
Um,
when you talk about your diet and its

3420
02:18:36,881 --> 02:18:40,090
impact on inflammation,
do you ever think that if you got on

3421
02:18:40,091 --> 02:18:42,130
this diet when you were younger,
you wouldn't have had to get hip

3422
02:18:42,131 --> 02:18:42,750
replacements?

3423
02:18:42,750 --> 02:18:43,900
Yeah,
I do.

3424
02:18:44,140 --> 02:18:46,630
I really do.
I think if I did when I was younger,

3425
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:47,920
um,
well,

3426
02:18:48,310 --> 02:18:48,971
I don't know.
You know,

3427
02:18:48,971 --> 02:18:53,971
it's about a,
it really is about a decline and I'm in

3428
02:18:54,071 --> 02:18:54,811
tissue,
you know,

3429
02:18:54,811 --> 02:18:58,720
he'd decline in cartilage tissue,
like where it was there when I was young

3430
02:18:59,050 --> 02:19:02,920
and then it started disappearing.
And then by the time I was 28 years old,

3431
02:19:02,921 --> 02:19:05,590
it was completely gone.
And this is because of inflammation and

3432
02:19:05,591 --> 02:19:08,560
because of arthritis,
there's really no reason for it.

3433
02:19:08,561 --> 02:19:11,050
You know,
my doctor said that lifting didn't cause

3434
02:19:11,051 --> 02:19:12,640
it.
It might have sped it up.

3435
02:19:12,850 --> 02:19:16,210
The fact that I needed to get the double
hip replacement surgery,

3436
02:19:16,211 --> 02:19:17,560
but he said like this isn't something
that,

3437
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:20,860
you know,
lifting a weight causes like a natural

3438
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:23,590
process in your body where you're,
your body's breaking down,

3439
02:19:23,591 --> 02:19:24,424
you know,
whatever.

3440
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:28,490
So I don't,
I don't know a good test will five years

3441
02:19:28,491 --> 02:19:30,230
from now how I feel,
you know,

3442
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:32,570
because I have other joints in my body,
a lot of them.

3443
02:19:32,910 --> 02:19:34,700
I was just going to ask you like,
how are your shoulders?

3444
02:19:34,701 --> 02:19:35,560
How are your,
well,

3445
02:19:35,950 --> 02:19:40,890
I screwed up my shoulder and I tore my
rotator cuff and I tore my tricep a

3446
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:44,180
while back and they never really heal,
healed properly,

3447
02:19:44,181 --> 02:19:45,500
so that,
that's an issue.

3448
02:19:45,970 --> 02:19:48,110
Um,
but the rest of my other joints that

3449
02:19:48,111 --> 02:19:51,290
aren't,
are injured are all fine and feel good

3450
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:51,880
now.
You know?

3451
02:19:51,880 --> 02:19:53,030
So what about your needs?
Well,

3452
02:19:53,031 --> 02:19:56,150
my knees were when I had got my hip
surgery 10 years ago.

3453
02:19:56,470 --> 02:19:58,040
Uh,
the doctor said to me,

3454
02:19:58,041 --> 02:20:01,010
your knees are next and they need to be
done probably like in a year.

3455
02:20:01,440 --> 02:20:04,700
God,
so he told me that when 10 years ago

3456
02:20:04,900 --> 02:20:09,900
he's got a Ferrari and I'm making
payments on that Condo in the Alps and

3457
02:20:10,191 --> 02:20:11,300
uh,
I don't know.

3458
02:20:11,301 --> 02:20:12,380
I haven't had,
and then,

3459
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:14,270
um,
let's see,

3460
02:20:14,271 --> 02:20:15,830
I'm trying to think of when this was.

3461
02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:18,170
I think like around when I finished
prescription thugs,

3462
02:20:18,171 --> 02:20:20,690
so maybe like two years ago,
uh,

3463
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:23,690
I was,
I went to a doctor and I was just in so

3464
02:20:23,691 --> 02:20:25,010
much pain and I said,
look,

3465
02:20:25,011 --> 02:20:26,660
I can't get back on opioids.
That was,

3466
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:29,030
that was my problem,
but I need something.

3467
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:33,440
What was the pain in everywhere.
Every joint in my lower body from my,

3468
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:35,060
like my ankles,
my knees,

3469
02:20:35,061 --> 02:20:37,250
my hips,
and the guy basically just said,

3470
02:20:37,251 --> 02:20:40,760
you need to go get a full body MRI.
So I get a full body Mri and he tells me

3471
02:20:40,761 --> 02:20:42,260
that there's really nothing wrong with
me.

3472
02:20:42,530 --> 02:20:44,240
And I'm like,
I don't know what you're looking at,

3473
02:20:44,241 --> 02:20:46,790
but I can't walk in the morning.
And he's like,

3474
02:20:46,820 --> 02:20:47,450
ah,
well you don't,

3475
02:20:47,450 --> 02:20:48,490
you don't really have,
you know,

3476
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:50,360
like you're,
you don't really have cartilage in your

3477
02:20:50,361 --> 02:20:52,040
knees that's going away,
but like,

3478
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:54,370
you know,
you do have it in your ankles and you do

3479
02:20:54,371 --> 02:20:56,750
have,
and didn't really offer me any

3480
02:20:56,751 --> 02:20:57,290
solutions.

3481
02:20:57,290 --> 02:20:59,510
And then that was,
it was at that point where I realized

3482
02:20:59,511 --> 02:21:01,460
like,
if I'm going to do anything,

3483
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:03,260
a doctor's not going to be the one to
help me,

3484
02:21:03,560 --> 02:21:05,270
you know?
So I think a lot of times people are

3485
02:21:05,271 --> 02:21:06,350
always so concerned,
like,

3486
02:21:06,740 --> 02:21:08,310
did you ask a doctor?
And I'm always like,

3487
02:21:08,311 --> 02:21:10,210
with doctors never really helped me.
You know,

3488
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:11,980
it's my cell phone.
He's helping me.

3489
02:21:11,981 --> 02:21:14,690
It's me researching things that caused
me pain,

3490
02:21:14,691 --> 02:21:15,920
that,
that really helped me,

3491
02:21:15,921 --> 02:21:16,754
you know?
So,

3492
02:21:16,790 --> 02:21:18,050
um,
that's,

3493
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:20,330
that's what I had to do was go out and
look for it myself.

3494
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:23,370
Wow.
So when you,

3495
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:25,520
do you ever go back to that doctor and
go,

3496
02:21:25,521 --> 02:21:27,200
hey motherfucker,
it's 10 years later,

3497
02:21:27,201 --> 02:21:28,970
I'm still walking and now I don't have
any pain.

3498
02:21:29,060 --> 02:21:31,220
I should go back to him and say,
hey,

3499
02:21:31,221 --> 02:21:32,270
you know,
like they,

3500
02:21:32,271 --> 02:21:34,350
you know,
they screwed up my hip and they left.

3501
02:21:34,780 --> 02:21:37,250
They left a bad hip and me for two
years.

3502
02:21:37,251 --> 02:21:40,100
And then I went to the doctor and I went
to my doctor and I said,

3503
02:21:40,101 --> 02:21:42,140
doc,
this is debilitating.

3504
02:21:42,890 --> 02:21:45,410
And so he takes a,
a tissue box and he throws it on the

3505
02:21:45,411 --> 02:21:47,180
ground and he says,
pick that up.

3506
02:21:47,690 --> 02:21:49,100
And I pick it up.
And he said,

3507
02:21:49,130 --> 02:21:51,740
you're using the wrong terminology.
It's not debilitating.

3508
02:21:51,741 --> 02:21:53,030
I'll see.
You wouldn't be able to pick that up.

3509
02:21:53,510 --> 02:21:57,110
And I thought it was the rudest thing
I've ever heard a doctor do or say like

3510
02:21:57,111 --> 02:21:58,730
ruthless,
like really?

3511
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:00,130
So I'm using the wrong word,
but big.

3512
02:22:00,250 --> 02:22:02,780
I can't,
I can't pick something up off the floor.

3513
02:22:02,810 --> 02:22:05,210
It hurts.
And I was trying to tell him like,

3514
02:22:05,211 --> 02:22:06,410
you don't understand this hurts.
And he's like,

3515
02:22:06,411 --> 02:22:07,221
Nah,
you're not hurt,

3516
02:22:07,221 --> 02:22:09,110
you're fine.
He actually told me to go back to the

3517
02:22:09,111 --> 02:22:11,140
gym and start lifting.
Oh my God.

3518
02:22:11,180 --> 02:22:13,310
And then two years later he calls me
back and he says,

3519
02:22:13,311 --> 02:22:14,960
I know what's wrong with your hip.
We screwed it up.

3520
02:22:15,410 --> 02:22:16,580
Oh Jesus.
Yeah.

3521
02:22:16,581 --> 02:22:20,060
So it's everything about column on that
doctors on late night TV.

3522
02:22:20,170 --> 02:22:21,120
Yeah.
You know,

3523
02:22:21,320 --> 02:22:23,250
think,
I don't think that's the,

3524
02:22:23,310 --> 02:22:25,560
you know,
you don't get as a way to get paid,

3525
02:22:25,720 --> 02:22:26,010
I'm

3526
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:26,843
sure.
Yeah.

3527
02:22:27,440 --> 02:22:29,620
But they fucked you up man.
Yeah.

3528
02:22:29,730 --> 02:22:32,370
Just sue the shit out of that asshole
tissue box.

3529
02:22:32,371 --> 02:22:34,530
Throwing douchebag.
Fuck them.

3530
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:37,800
Part of what happened to you too was
like you had pain,

3531
02:22:37,801 --> 02:22:38,720
right?
That was a,

3532
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:41,250
that was preventing you from moving
more,

3533
02:22:41,251 --> 02:22:41,670
right?
Like,

3534
02:22:41,670 --> 02:22:44,550
and then you just kind of stopped.
Like you did some cardio stuff for

3535
02:22:44,551 --> 02:22:46,950
exercise,
but you weren't able to squat,

3536
02:22:46,951 --> 02:22:48,900
bench deadlift.
You weren't able to get some full range

3537
02:22:48,901 --> 02:22:50,880
of motion and therefore,
you know,

3538
02:22:50,881 --> 02:22:51,780
use it or lose it.
Right.

3539
02:22:51,781 --> 02:22:53,820
You lost range of motion.
When did the pain go away?

3540
02:22:54,500 --> 02:22:55,320
Uh,
well,

3541
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:57,480
I'm still on a lot of pain when I wake
up every morning.

3542
02:22:57,510 --> 02:22:59,240
So yeah,
it goes away when I,

3543
02:22:59,490 --> 02:23:03,920
the thing is that the diet has helped
clear up like a lot of inflammation.

3544
02:23:03,930 --> 02:23:06,090
It's also helped clear up a lot of body
fat,

3545
02:23:06,300 --> 02:23:09,090
which helps you get in a better and more
advantageous positions when you're

3546
02:23:09,091 --> 02:23:09,840
lifting.

3547
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:12,810
You know that you can't,
I couldn't even bend down to dead lift

3548
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:14,820
properly.
Egg got would get in a way and all that

3549
02:23:14,821 --> 02:23:16,140
stuff like that.
So,

3550
02:23:16,141 --> 02:23:18,480
um,
get rid of those things and that helps a

3551
02:23:18,481 --> 02:23:20,540
lot.
Losing weight in general always is going

3552
02:23:20,541 --> 02:23:23,490
to improve health markers and you're
always going to feel lighter and better,

3553
02:23:23,491 --> 02:23:24,720
you know,
for the most part.

3554
02:23:25,020 --> 02:23:25,950
And then,
um,

3555
02:23:26,670 --> 02:23:29,160
it was that this like losing weight.
And then when I,

3556
02:23:29,161 --> 02:23:33,090
um,
started taking Kratom with a ketogenetic

3557
02:23:33,091 --> 02:23:37,050
diet and really reduce my inflammation
is when I started feeling better.

3558
02:23:37,051 --> 02:23:39,810
So was sort of a combination of those
two things.

3559
02:23:40,170 --> 02:23:44,130
And I'm continuing to move.
It's a daily struggle.

3560
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:45,210
It doesn't go away.
You know,

3561
02:23:45,220 --> 02:23:46,490
this,
this is because your osteoporosis

3562
02:23:46,590 --> 02:23:49,110
osteoarthritis.
So when you woke up this morning,

3563
02:23:49,220 --> 02:23:51,270
what hard to get out of bed?
Yeah.

3564
02:23:51,271 --> 02:23:52,230
You know what?
Actually,

3565
02:23:52,231 --> 02:23:54,000
um,
this morning I felt good.

3566
02:23:54,030 --> 02:23:56,220
So you have good days and bad days,
you know?

3567
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:58,910
Did you ever fuck with hot yoga?
I haven't,

3568
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:01,800
but I keep hearing you talk about it and
I keep thinking like,

3569
02:24:01,801 --> 02:24:03,180
man,
that's just something I have to go do.

3570
02:24:03,310 --> 02:24:05,820
I was wondering like how that would
affect your hips.

3571
02:24:05,821 --> 02:24:08,500
Like how you're like,
do you have full range of motion?

3572
02:24:08,501 --> 02:24:12,330
I think I would probably feel great but
right now I can't move enough to get in

3573
02:24:12,331 --> 02:24:16,180
those positions so I have to take like a
pre yoga class to get into,

3574
02:24:16,210 --> 02:24:18,120
you know,
you just take a yoga class and you do

3575
02:24:18,121 --> 02:24:19,680
your best.
Like they always say that because

3576
02:24:19,681 --> 02:24:23,310
there's a lot of people in my class that
have some serious issues that can't move

3577
02:24:23,311 --> 02:24:26,910
well or there's this one lady who goes
and she's fucking courageous man cause

3578
02:24:26,911 --> 02:24:31,230
this lady's so overweight and she goes
this yoga class and she does her best

3579
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:33,330
and you know,
I see her and I,

3580
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:36,300
I want to say something to her but I
don't want to say something to her.

3581
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:40,520
Like I don't want to be the guy and go,
hey you know for a giant lady you're

3582
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:42,930
fucking putting it up there.
Like I don't want to like,

3583
02:24:43,110 --> 02:24:43,943
you know,
you're right.

3584
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:46,860
I say hi and I smile at her,
but she's courageous.

3585
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:51,330
She's every bit of 400 5,500 pounds.
Wow.

3586
02:24:51,331 --> 02:24:52,860
Just guessing.
She is enormous,

3587
02:24:53,070 --> 02:24:54,990
but she does it.
She tries,

3588
02:24:54,991 --> 02:24:55,621
she's,
she's,

3589
02:24:55,621 --> 02:24:56,940
you know,
she's got her arms up.

3590
02:24:56,941 --> 02:24:58,740
She's been in for it.
She's doing her best.

3591
02:24:59,370 --> 02:25:02,910
And if you just keep showing up,
it'll get better.

3592
02:25:02,940 --> 02:25:05,370
Like you're not going to be able to get
into those positions initially,

3593
02:25:05,371 --> 02:25:08,280
but if you keep showing up,
I think the hot yoga might help him

3594
02:25:08,281 --> 02:25:09,180
because,
uh,

3595
02:25:09,570 --> 02:25:11,700
when he's warmed up,
you move around really well.

3596
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:13,260
That's what I'm sending work workout.
You're like,

3597
02:25:13,261 --> 02:25:14,880
oh fuck it.
Now I'm going to dead lift once he's

3598
02:25:14,881 --> 02:25:15,630
warmed up.

3599
02:25:15,630 --> 02:25:17,610
Yeah.
A lot of people don't warm up enough.

3600
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:18,533
Right.
I agree,

3601
02:25:18,580 --> 02:25:21,030
man.
You're 100% in a yoga class where it's

3602
02:25:21,031 --> 02:25:22,410
already warm.
That helps a lot.

3603
02:25:22,411 --> 02:25:25,000
But you know,
people need to understand that the more

3604
02:25:25,001 --> 02:25:27,310
intense the exercise is that you're
going to do,

3605
02:25:27,460 --> 02:25:29,560
the longer your warm up needs to be.
Yeah.

3606
02:25:29,590 --> 02:25:32,800
So if you're going for a two hour walk,
how much warm up do you need?

3607
02:25:32,801 --> 02:25:33,830
Probably none.
There's no one,

3608
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:35,500
there's not a lot of intensity behind
that.

3609
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:38,560
But if you're trying to run a 40 meter
sprints,

3610
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:41,440
then you better warm up for a half an
hour and probably minimum.

3611
02:25:41,441 --> 02:25:43,810
So you don't tear a hamstring.
Same thing with trying to bench heavy or

3612
02:25:43,811 --> 02:25:46,810
squat heavy,
not just the exercise itself either.

3613
02:25:46,811 --> 02:25:50,170
That's a mistake I think.
I think you have to warm up on with

3614
02:25:50,171 --> 02:25:51,340
other,
with other means.

3615
02:25:51,341 --> 02:25:54,190
And the easiest way to warm up is
through your upper body.

3616
02:25:54,190 --> 02:25:57,610
So you go in the gym and you can do
curls and shoulder stuff if your

3617
02:25:57,611 --> 02:25:59,010
shoulders healthy.
Uh,

3618
02:25:59,020 --> 02:26:01,240
that's the fastest way.
Skier is a great way.

3619
02:26:01,241 --> 02:26:03,130
That's fastest,
easiest way to warm up your body is

3620
02:26:03,131 --> 02:26:05,820
through the upper body a lot of times
are our needs.

3621
02:26:06,130 --> 02:26:07,720
What do you mean?
Well cause like your knees and your

3622
02:26:07,721 --> 02:26:09,610
lower back.
I mean just in general,

3623
02:26:09,880 --> 02:26:12,340
this is an everybody but in general a
lot of people,

3624
02:26:12,610 --> 02:26:14,680
the knees,
the lower back and some of those things

3625
02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:19,000
are going to take time to warm up and
you can warm up faster just by,

3626
02:26:19,090 --> 02:26:21,760
just by getting the upper body to move.
Uh,

3627
02:26:21,761 --> 02:26:24,490
when you utilize your upper body,
you get your heart rate up a little bit

3628
02:26:24,491 --> 02:26:27,460
faster and it's just,
it's more comfortable.

3629
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:29,170
It's just easier.
It's easier for me to say,

3630
02:26:29,171 --> 02:26:29,921
Hey,
you know,

3631
02:26:29,921 --> 02:26:31,570
hold this band,
pull it apart,

3632
02:26:31,900 --> 02:26:33,010
do these curls.

3633
02:26:34,300 --> 02:26:36,550
He just move your arms,
throw some punches,

3634
02:26:36,551 --> 02:26:38,230
like who can't throw punches.
Right.

3635
02:26:38,380 --> 02:26:41,710
Anyone can throw some punches.
I know you guys can throw any good ones.

3636
02:26:41,890 --> 02:26:42,430
Yeah,
no,

3637
02:26:42,430 --> 02:26:43,600
you can't do any good ones.
Yeah,

3638
02:26:43,660 --> 02:26:45,350
but you just,
you move around.

3639
02:26:45,380 --> 02:26:47,200
That's how you warm yourself up.
You've got to make sure you warm

3640
02:26:47,201 --> 02:26:49,240
yourself up.
I get to use the elliptical machine.

3641
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:50,730
I do 10 minutes on an elliptical
machine.

3642
02:26:50,780 --> 02:26:53,680
Absolutely nothing going on as the
intensity,

3643
02:26:53,681 --> 02:26:57,360
so low and there's no impact,
no nothing.

3644
02:26:57,361 --> 02:27:00,590
You can do it at your own pace and not
really caring.

3645
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:04,990
And mark and I do all the time is walk.
We walk every single day.

3646
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:07,060
And um,
we started a thing like a 10 minute,

3647
02:27:07,180 --> 02:27:10,180
he does has a Hashtag 10 minute walk and
uh,

3648
02:27:10,181 --> 02:27:11,860
after,
after you eat every time,

3649
02:27:11,861 --> 02:27:12,480
right?
Yeah.

3650
02:27:12,480 --> 02:27:14,610
Yeah.
You try to do as many 10 minute walks in

3651
02:27:14,611 --> 02:27:15,060
the days it can.

3652
02:27:15,060 --> 02:27:17,200
Anybody about that Hashtag because now
they're going to put a picture of a

3653
02:27:17,201 --> 02:27:21,520
bunch of pictures of Dicks Hashtag
[inaudible] hey,

3654
02:27:21,880 --> 02:27:23,490
that's okay.
Yeah,

3655
02:27:23,530 --> 02:27:26,050
I get it.
I get a lot of good balance plants.

3656
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:29,410
I don't know.
Now it's even worse cause I said it here

3657
02:27:30,470 --> 02:27:33,210
like some inside joke about eggplants,
tons of eggplants,

3658
02:27:33,220 --> 02:27:34,360
eggplants a Dick,
right?

3659
02:27:35,110 --> 02:27:36,650
What kinds of things,
right?

3660
02:27:37,190 --> 02:27:38,140
Yeah,
for sure.

3661
02:27:38,141 --> 02:27:39,640
100% yeah.
Oh I didn't know.

3662
02:27:39,710 --> 02:27:42,940
Yeah.
Oh now you're getting lockers.

3663
02:27:43,900 --> 02:27:45,910
That's,
it's so funny.

3664
02:27:45,911 --> 02:27:47,020
I'm so,
I'm so old.

3665
02:27:47,590 --> 02:27:49,330
I don't know anything the kids are doing
these days.

3666
02:27:49,540 --> 02:27:51,820
I just found out about a little bee.
I don't know shit.

3667
02:27:52,790 --> 02:27:54,700
Anyway,
people should be going on a 10 minute

3668
02:27:54,701 --> 02:27:55,900
walk.
It's low hanging fruit.

3669
02:27:55,901 --> 02:27:58,750
It's easy to do.
Just try one a day.

3670
02:27:59,080 --> 02:28:01,180
It's not hard.
One thing I like to do is body weight

3671
02:28:01,181 --> 02:28:02,860
squats.
To do those Hindu squats,

3672
02:28:02,870 --> 02:28:05,260
I'll do a set of a hundred and it just
gets everything warmed up.

3673
02:28:05,490 --> 02:28:08,020
Everything League,
get your legs burning pretty bad in a

3674
02:28:08,021 --> 02:28:08,950
weird spot,
right?

3675
02:28:08,951 --> 02:28:11,320
Like your quads near your knee.
Upper knee?

3676
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:12,760
Yeah.
Like right here.

3677
02:28:12,790 --> 02:28:13,511
Yeah.
This,

3678
02:28:13,511 --> 02:28:15,550
this part like right where your need
connects.

3679
02:28:15,551 --> 02:28:16,970
Where your quad,
that handy spot.

3680
02:28:17,110 --> 02:28:18,760
What about,
what about a wall?

3681
02:28:18,761 --> 02:28:20,470
Sit.
How come a wall sit so hard?

3682
02:28:20,590 --> 02:28:21,560
It's fucking hard.

3683
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:23,810
I did that the other day.
It was brutal.

3684
02:28:23,811 --> 02:28:25,570
It was the hardest fucking exercise.
There isn't,

3685
02:28:26,260 --> 02:28:28,730
well,
in karate they would have you stand at a

3686
02:28:28,731 --> 02:28:31,820
horse stance for long periods of time.
Just like this.

3687
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,190
Just standing at horse dance like how
hard could this be?

3688
02:28:34,390 --> 02:28:36,530
A minute and you're like,
oh shit.

3689
02:28:36,531 --> 02:28:39,260
How am I supposed to do this?
You're not even leaning up against the

3690
02:28:39,261 --> 02:28:39,921
wall.
Yeah.

3691
02:28:39,921 --> 02:28:40,910
No.
Lean up against the wall.

3692
02:28:40,911 --> 02:28:45,911
Just a deep squat
to stand and how long we you standing

3693
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:47,840
for it?
I never did it.

3694
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:50,460
It was not,
my instructor was never ended up.

3695
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:53,090
Well I didn't.
I took karate for a very short period of

3696
02:28:53,091 --> 02:28:54,140
time.
That's a karate thing.

3697
02:28:54,141 --> 02:28:55,700
That was in taekwondo.
He never did that.

3698
02:28:55,790 --> 02:28:57,980
Karate kids coming back.
Oh my God.

3699
02:28:58,050 --> 02:29:00,740
You know about Ai.
Is it a will smith junior again?

3700
02:29:00,770 --> 02:29:01,221
No,
no,

3701
02:29:01,221 --> 02:29:01,970
it's Cobra Kai.

3702
02:29:01,970 --> 02:29:05,680
It's a show about the Cobra Kai.
It's like Netflix that's about the bags

3703
02:29:05,690 --> 02:29:09,290
and Netflix on youtube,
but Ralph Machos in it and he comes in

3704
02:29:09,291 --> 02:29:13,190
and he has a competing Dojo I believe.
How old is Ralph Macho now?

3705
02:29:13,220 --> 02:29:18,220
50 30 to least he looks great.
Like what does that guy on the trade

3706
02:29:20,480 --> 02:29:22,700
show is on some youth shit.
Oh,

3707
02:29:22,701 --> 02:29:25,460
you just go look at Cobra Kai.
Let me see the strike hard.

3708
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:26,390
Oh,
pushups.

3709
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:27,980
Oh,
terrible punches.

3710
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:30,710
It was teaching these people.
No mercy.

3711
02:29:32,210 --> 02:29:33,400
Is there any particular way you want me
to

3712
02:29:37,450 --> 02:29:39,800
shut them out with that?
Shut that off right now.

3713
02:29:39,830 --> 02:29:41,430
That was great.
There you go.

3714
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:45,560
That is the fucking trailer we need an
MMA movie.

3715
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:47,680
Get to,
there was one warrior,

3716
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:51,050
Brian town was in that.
The only problem with that movie is they

3717
02:29:51,051 --> 02:29:54,500
had people fight over a couple of days,
which is just like shut the fuck up.

3718
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:57,140
They did a bunch of stupid shit.
They didn't have to do in that movie.

3719
02:29:57,410 --> 02:30:00,020
They just,
you don't have people.

3720
02:30:00,340 --> 02:30:03,080
You can have people fight more than a
one time and the night.

3721
02:30:03,370 --> 02:30:06,320
But if you really think someone can get
in a bra and then you've never seen

3722
02:30:06,321 --> 02:30:08,870
anybody fight and then see what they
look like the next day.

3723
02:30:09,170 --> 02:30:12,440
Cause I remember when Ken shamrock
fought Tito Ortiz and then I ran into

3724
02:30:12,441 --> 02:30:13,310
him the next day.
I was like,

3725
02:30:13,330 --> 02:30:16,910
Holy Shit can,
his whole face was swollen up.

3726
02:30:16,940 --> 02:30:20,090
He had sunglasses on it.
If that guy is not fighting any today,

3727
02:30:20,250 --> 02:30:21,170
you know,
I mean he would,

3728
02:30:21,171 --> 02:30:23,540
he's a fucking animal but that's not
healthy.

3729
02:30:23,810 --> 02:30:26,540
Like your body's dealing with all that.
I don't even like when they fight more

3730
02:30:26,541 --> 02:30:29,630
than one time in the night and they got
away with that back in the day.

3731
02:30:29,631 --> 02:30:32,980
And I know glory still does that for
some of the kickboxing tournaments,

3732
02:30:32,990 --> 02:30:34,310
but it's his fucking dangerous.

3733
02:30:34,570 --> 02:30:37,190
It's just not smart.
Guys get concussed and then they fight

3734
02:30:37,191 --> 02:30:39,140
again an hour later,
two hours later.

3735
02:30:39,141 --> 02:30:41,660
That's crazy.
Smashing machine was a fucking awesome

3736
02:30:41,661 --> 02:30:43,520
movie.
That's my favorite documentary ever.

3737
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:46,940
That is my top and that's an accidental
fine.

3738
02:30:46,970 --> 02:30:49,010
That's when I was documentaries.
Amazing Doc.

3739
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:54,120
That is a lot like that movie icarus
where they started to do one thing and

3740
02:30:54,261 --> 02:30:57,710
then a long yeah,
they found something way fucking crazy.

3741
02:30:57,711 --> 02:30:59,190
Yeah.
And that's uh,

3742
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:02,990
a documentary around Mark Kerr who was
one of the scariest mma fighters of all

3743
02:31:02,991 --> 02:31:07,991
time and he was Jews to the,
but there was such an ironic thing with

3744
02:31:10,341 --> 02:31:14,210
him where he was an animal,
but he was so afraid to actually fight,

3745
02:31:14,420 --> 02:31:15,910
which was really cool.
Where that,

3746
02:31:15,911 --> 02:31:20,580
that was such an interesting angle you'd
say before he goes out to the cage every

3747
02:31:20,581 --> 02:31:23,300
time he's like,
I can barely take a sip of water because

3748
02:31:23,310 --> 02:31:26,100
I'm so nervous because that kills
people.

3749
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:29,400
I was around when Mark Kerr first
started competing.

3750
02:31:29,610 --> 02:31:31,230
He's one of the first guys that ever
saw,

3751
02:31:31,231 --> 02:31:34,650
first of all,
he was a gi and they used to call him

3752
02:31:34,651 --> 02:31:37,590
the specimen for a while.
Then they called them the smashing

3753
02:31:37,591 --> 02:31:38,760
machine.
But uh,

3754
02:31:38,790 --> 02:31:41,940
he's the first guy that ever saw that
submitted someone with a look of that

3755
02:31:42,090 --> 02:31:45,600
shit the fuck out of here.
That's crazy.

3756
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:46,750
It's like,
I can improve that.

3757
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:49,740
Um,
but look at that.

3758
02:31:49,741 --> 02:31:52,920
Just keep that up there for a second.
And those traps when he was a,

3759
02:31:52,940 --> 02:31:55,830
that's pretty at the UFC,
he submitted someone with a chin to the

3760
02:31:55,831 --> 02:31:58,680
eye socket.
He held the back of the dude's head and

3761
02:31:58,681 --> 02:32:02,300
got his chin and the guy's eye socket
and you're fucking drove his chin into

3762
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:05,010
his eye socket Dan [inaudible].
Yeah,

3763
02:32:05,011 --> 02:32:07,110
first time I ever saw somebody submit
someone that way.

3764
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:10,200
But seriously everybody asks me what my
favorite documentary is cause that's

3765
02:32:10,201 --> 02:32:10,770
what I do.

3766
02:32:10,770 --> 02:32:13,590
And without even hesitation,
I always say smashing machine.

3767
02:32:13,650 --> 02:32:15,870
It's a great documentary on so many
levels.

3768
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:18,660
It really reminded me of our older
brother.

3769
02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:21,480
He reminded me a lot of mad dog.
Wow.

3770
02:32:21,510 --> 02:32:24,000
Mark her.
Well you know he had a substance abuse

3771
02:32:24,001 --> 02:32:27,600
problem and he was also like a guy at
the time.

3772
02:32:27,601 --> 02:32:31,740
It was the early days of MMA.
I mean he was fighting back when it was

3773
02:32:31,800 --> 02:32:34,950
just crazy raw bare knuckles and you
know,

3774
02:32:34,951 --> 02:32:39,540
fighting in these weird rings and Shammy
and he was the early,

3775
02:32:39,540 --> 02:32:41,610
early days of MMA.
You ever read the book blood in the

3776
02:32:41,611 --> 02:32:44,190
cage?
I read some of it's really good.

3777
02:32:44,280 --> 02:32:47,910
I never feel like you had pat on a last
week and actually wanted to do,

3778
02:32:47,940 --> 02:32:51,060
I still want to do a film with Pat,
a scripted film.

3779
02:32:51,061 --> 02:32:53,580
We had been talking about it,
we talked about it a long time ago and

3780
02:32:53,581 --> 02:32:55,710
now I'm starting started,
started adding a little bit of clout.

3781
02:32:55,710 --> 02:32:59,190
Now I'm starting to talk about it again,
but his life was insane.

3782
02:32:59,220 --> 02:33:03,750
He had two brothers that died and one
brother that ended up going to jail for

3783
02:33:03,751 --> 02:33:07,440
like 15 years and he was the runt of the
family and he ended up becoming the

3784
02:33:07,441 --> 02:33:11,790
first ever UFC lightweight champion,
which is just overcoming adversity like

3785
02:33:11,791 --> 02:33:13,260
crazy.
It's an amazing story.

3786
02:33:13,290 --> 02:33:15,900
You know,
pats neck was so fucked up that his

3787
02:33:15,901 --> 02:33:18,630
discs fuse together on their own.
Wow.

3788
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:21,990
That's incredible.
It's so much degeneration of his disks

3789
02:33:22,170 --> 02:33:25,770
that the two bones,
they sat on top of each other for so

3790
02:33:25,771 --> 02:33:28,920
long that they fused the port where
people accused him of having an

3791
02:33:28,921 --> 02:33:32,130
operation.
Like he had an issue where a doctor said

3792
02:33:32,131 --> 02:33:34,380
that he had an operations.
I never had a fucking operation like

3793
02:33:34,381 --> 02:33:38,400
your neck,
your fucking boone's the two bones.

3794
02:33:38,580 --> 02:33:41,040
They have no disc in the middle,
another fuse together.

3795
02:33:41,100 --> 02:33:43,170
I've never even heard of that before.
You ever heard of that before?

3796
02:33:43,320 --> 02:33:44,760
No.
Fucking tough.

3797
02:33:44,761 --> 02:33:48,300
You have to be to deal with kind of pain
where your neck is fusing itself.

3798
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:51,270
Your neck is like,
this asshole is not going to go to a

3799
02:33:51,271 --> 02:33:52,950
doctor,
so we're going to be the doctor.

3800
02:33:53,310 --> 02:33:56,010
When you see what he went through a,
he's probably one of the toughest people

3801
02:33:56,011 --> 02:33:56,740
and the world,
you know,

3802
02:33:56,740 --> 02:33:59,070
just that.
She's been through a lot of very smart

3803
02:33:59,071 --> 02:34:00,600
dude too.
He's talked to him.

3804
02:34:00,601 --> 02:34:01,770
He's there,
he's all there.

3805
02:34:01,771 --> 02:34:04,110
I mean long career in mma,
you know,

3806
02:34:04,111 --> 02:34:06,690
he fought Dan Severn finished a book.
If you get a chance,

3807
02:34:06,691 --> 02:34:07,650
it's amazing.
Okay.

3808
02:34:07,710 --> 02:34:09,630
Listen to the audio book when you run or
something.

3809
02:34:09,631 --> 02:34:11,010
That's great.
Really good book.

3810
02:34:11,490 --> 02:34:12,480
Um,
yeah,

3811
02:34:12,530 --> 02:34:14,160
he's,
it's those old days.

3812
02:34:14,161 --> 02:34:16,800
There's nothing like them.
Never happened again.

3813
02:34:16,801 --> 02:34:18,130
What's great about that book.
Also,

3814
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:21,610
it tells the whole story of the,
how the UFC started,

3815
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:24,010
how it got us started and all the
players involved.

3816
02:34:24,011 --> 02:34:27,520
And it tells that whole story,
which is really putting a Jon Wertheim

3817
02:34:27,550 --> 02:34:28,990
sports illustrated,
really,

3818
02:34:28,991 --> 02:34:31,360
really good writer.
That guy has written a lot of good

3819
02:34:31,361 --> 02:34:33,460
stuff.
He wrote a great book on pool too.

3820
02:34:33,580 --> 02:34:35,380
Yeah,
he wrote a book on delicious.

3821
02:34:36,310 --> 02:34:39,310
He brought the pool book.
He wrote a book on statistics and how

3822
02:34:39,311 --> 02:34:42,460
they sort of a point shave and all that
stuff on that in basketball.

3823
02:34:42,830 --> 02:34:43,471
No,
he's a,

3824
02:34:43,471 --> 02:34:45,430
he's a very good writer.
Okay,

3825
02:34:45,850 --> 02:34:47,400
cool.
Uh,

3826
02:34:47,500 --> 02:34:48,250
when is,
uh,

3827
02:34:48,250 --> 02:34:51,810
do you think this documentary is gonna
come out the new [inaudible]?

3828
02:34:52,270 --> 02:34:53,420
Well,
the creative ones gonna come out soon,

3829
02:34:53,421 --> 02:34:55,210
right?
Eight 29 and then what's it going to be

3830
02:34:55,211 --> 02:34:56,044
on?
How's it,

3831
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:57,400
where can people get it?
Well,

3832
02:34:57,401 --> 02:34:59,350
hopefully it will be on like Netflix,
Amazon,

3833
02:34:59,351 --> 02:34:59,740
whatever.

3834
02:34:59,740 --> 02:35:01,570
I'm not sure exactly where it will be
yet.

3835
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:05,580
We've partnered with the orchard and
there's the distribution companies.

3836
02:35:05,581 --> 02:35:07,900
So right now they're in the process of
figuring out where it will be.

3837
02:35:08,330 --> 02:35:09,520
Um,
but I'll let everybody know.

3838
02:35:09,580 --> 02:35:12,100
It'll be on it.
Probably start out to tell you the truth

3839
02:35:12,101 --> 02:35:14,590
on itunes,
the normal route.

3840
02:35:14,770 --> 02:35:15,610
And then,
um,

3841
02:35:15,670 --> 02:35:17,590
you know,
you let it play on itunes for a while

3842
02:35:17,591 --> 02:35:18,790
and hey,
there's a,

3843
02:35:18,791 --> 02:35:21,940
there's a whole system to it because it
makes money in different ways,

3844
02:35:21,941 --> 02:35:22,980
different places.
Right.

3845
02:35:23,440 --> 02:35:25,630
Unfortunately for documentary film
makers,

3846
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:29,200
Netflix is sort of your,
that's your graveyard at the end because

3847
02:35:29,440 --> 02:35:31,390
you know,
like you want it to be on Netflix

3848
02:35:31,391 --> 02:35:33,970
because everybody has access to it.
And as a film maker,

3849
02:35:33,971 --> 02:35:38,230
they really shaft you can because
they'll buy the like,

3850
02:35:38,590 --> 02:35:43,030
so they buy the film from the
distribution company and then like all

3851
02:35:43,031 --> 02:35:45,400
that money just goes back to the
investor and then,

3852
02:35:45,460 --> 02:35:46,330
and it's like,
I don't get,

3853
02:35:46,331 --> 02:35:47,350
I don't see any money out of it.

3854
02:35:47,350 --> 02:35:50,680
So the only way to make documentaries
and make them profitable and make them

3855
02:35:50,681 --> 02:35:51,820
really,
really cheap.

3856
02:35:51,910 --> 02:35:53,770
And a lot of times we don't do that,
so we ended up,

3857
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:55,960
you end up losing some money on it a lot
of times,

3858
02:35:55,961 --> 02:35:58,000
you know,
the way it's just the way it works.

3859
02:35:59,260 --> 02:36:00,490
This nutrition movie.
Yeah.

3860
02:36:00,570 --> 02:36:03,760
Find that millionaire money.
That's 100%.

3861
02:36:03,790 --> 02:36:05,110
Yeah.
But you know,

3862
02:36:05,710 --> 02:36:07,900
the advantage of doing a food
documentaries,

3863
02:36:07,901 --> 02:36:10,210
they do really well.
So it would a food documentary,

3864
02:36:10,211 --> 02:36:12,040
you have a chance to really make a
profit.

3865
02:36:12,041 --> 02:36:14,620
Where as the other stuff it's,
it's really difficult.

3866
02:36:14,650 --> 02:36:16,570
Did you gotten the term meathead
billionaire yet?

3867
02:36:16,820 --> 02:36:17,740
A trademark.
Yeah.

3868
02:36:17,770 --> 02:36:20,160
Did you I got all kinds of stupid shit.
Trademarks.

3869
02:36:20,200 --> 02:36:21,580
That's a good thing.
That's a good thing.

3870
02:36:21,581 --> 02:36:25,420
That was my nickname for him
had millionaire.

3871
02:36:25,720 --> 02:36:26,790
Well I know that,
uh,

3872
02:36:26,820 --> 02:36:28,780
it grows,
did really well and it did really well.

3873
02:36:28,930 --> 02:36:30,190
Bryan Fogel,
you know,

3874
02:36:30,191 --> 02:36:34,060
but that is a groundbreaking boss life
changing documentary.

3875
02:36:34,061 --> 02:36:36,390
Also things break out like that.
Like that might be,

3876
02:36:36,700 --> 02:36:38,680
first of all,
it was involved,

3877
02:36:38,810 --> 02:36:39,670
you know,
when we did bigger,

3878
02:36:39,671 --> 02:36:40,481
stronger,
faster,

3879
02:36:40,481 --> 02:36:43,070
there wasn't an international scandal
going on right.

3880
02:36:43,210 --> 02:36:45,250
That we were sorta happened to be
following.

3881
02:36:45,251 --> 02:36:46,420
And so,
yeah.

3882
02:36:46,421 --> 02:36:47,171
So,
so,

3883
02:36:47,171 --> 02:36:48,070
um,
in a way,

3884
02:36:48,071 --> 02:36:48,820
you know,
he got,

3885
02:36:48,820 --> 02:36:50,950
he got lucky with that,
but he also made a great film.

3886
02:36:50,980 --> 02:36:52,690
He took it and made it into something
really good.

3887
02:36:52,990 --> 02:36:54,340
So I think that was cool.
But,

3888
02:36:54,341 --> 02:36:55,240
uh,
you know,

3889
02:36:55,730 --> 02:36:58,270
it,
it was what a crazy movie that was.

3890
02:36:58,271 --> 02:36:58,691
You know,
we didn't,

3891
02:36:58,691 --> 02:37:00,550
we didn't have something like that in
the movie.

3892
02:37:00,670 --> 02:37:03,520
We didn't have somebody like admitting
to steroids that was like huge.

3893
02:37:03,521 --> 02:37:04,311
So,
uh,

3894
02:37:04,311 --> 02:37:07,600
when it came out at Sundance,
it was sort of a shocker to a lot of

3895
02:37:07,601 --> 02:37:08,860
people like,
this is at Sundance.

3896
02:37:08,861 --> 02:37:10,520
This is crazy.
I can't believe this,

3897
02:37:10,860 --> 02:37:11,740
you know,
at Sundance.

3898
02:37:12,040 --> 02:37:13,690
And um,
and it did really well.

3899
02:37:13,691 --> 02:37:16,010
It got really good reviews.
It did really well,

3900
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:19,490
but it didn't have that like one thing
that broke it out and made it super size

3901
02:37:19,491 --> 02:37:19,941
me,
you know,

3902
02:37:19,941 --> 02:37:21,530
there was,
there was something missing,

3903
02:37:21,650 --> 02:37:23,630
some element where every,
you know,

3904
02:37:23,631 --> 02:37:25,460
it wasn't a thing that everybody had to
see.

3905
02:37:25,700 --> 02:37:27,830
Although it was a really great film,
I think,

3906
02:37:27,831 --> 02:37:30,060
you know,
it just didn't have that one thing that

3907
02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:31,250
was really great as well.
But yeah,

3908
02:37:31,251 --> 02:37:34,480
you didn't,
he got super lucky while he was doing,

3909
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:35,700
you know,
you could see what I'm saying now.

3910
02:37:35,790 --> 02:37:38,420
It wasn't that one thing.
We had to see it because of this thing,

3911
02:37:38,421 --> 02:37:38,841
you know?
It's like,

3912
02:37:38,841 --> 02:37:40,850
yeah,
because there's always the thing about

3913
02:37:40,851 --> 02:37:43,430
cheating in the Olympic Games,
it's always been suspected,

3914
02:37:43,431 --> 02:37:48,170
but to get it so confirmed where you
have the guy that did it and he's

3915
02:37:48,171 --> 02:37:51,410
running from the Russian mob or the
whatever you want to call them,

3916
02:37:51,620 --> 02:37:52,910
and they're trying to fucking kill him.

3917
02:37:52,910 --> 02:37:53,230
It was,
no,

3918
02:37:53,230 --> 02:37:55,970
he's in hiding.
He's still in hiding to this day in

3919
02:37:55,971 --> 02:37:58,250
America in protective custody.
And they're looking for him.

3920
02:37:58,430 --> 02:37:59,630
Yeah,
they're looking for him.

3921
02:38:00,050 --> 02:38:01,700
I think it's crazy.
I think it's crazy.

3922
02:38:01,701 --> 02:38:04,490
First of all that he did,
did the film and I think secondly,

3923
02:38:04,491 --> 02:38:06,390
it's crazy that,
um,

3924
02:38:07,220 --> 02:38:11,130
he wasn't even a little bit more
protected in the least by the film

3925
02:38:11,131 --> 02:38:12,670
maker.
I thought the film maker kind of throw

3926
02:38:12,680 --> 02:38:16,550
him under the bus a little bit,
but that's just how so are you wanted to

3927
02:38:16,551 --> 02:38:17,384
be in the film?
Yeah,

3928
02:38:17,460 --> 02:38:17,941
I know.
It was,

3929
02:38:17,941 --> 02:38:19,700
it was weird though.
It started to feel weird.

3930
02:38:20,630 --> 02:38:22,030
I felt like,
um,

3931
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:25,350
I dunno.
I mean like the daddy of protected by

3932
02:38:25,351 --> 02:38:27,950
changing is named that the Russians knew
who he was.

3933
02:38:27,980 --> 02:38:28,480
Yeah.
I,

3934
02:38:28,480 --> 02:38:29,360
I don't know.
I just,

3935
02:38:29,361 --> 02:38:30,830
I just felt like it was,
um,

3936
02:38:31,940 --> 02:38:32,410
I dunno.

3937
02:38:32,410 --> 02:38:34,400
I felt like it was a little reckless as
a filmmaker,

3938
02:38:34,460 --> 02:38:35,930
you know,
I just felt like it was a,

3939
02:38:35,960 --> 02:38:39,080
what would you do differently?
It's tell you the truth.

3940
02:38:39,081 --> 02:38:41,150
I really,
I really don't know what I would do

3941
02:38:41,151 --> 02:38:42,350
differently.
I just felt like,

3942
02:38:42,351 --> 02:38:45,080
man,
this like as I'm watching it going like,

3943
02:38:45,081 --> 02:38:46,400
man,
this guy's going to get in a lot of

3944
02:38:46,401 --> 02:38:48,050
trouble.
He's going to get killed because of

3945
02:38:48,051 --> 02:38:49,590
this.
He threw me in so I don't,

3946
02:38:49,640 --> 02:38:51,170
I don't know.
Maybe I did.

3947
02:38:51,230 --> 02:38:52,011
I don't know.
Maybe I do.

3948
02:38:52,011 --> 02:38:55,610
Maybe I'm just talking out my ass.
But you weren't like rigging the

3949
02:38:55,611 --> 02:38:59,330
Olympics.
But what changed after that was that the

3950
02:38:59,331 --> 02:39:02,630
Russians essentially are barred from the
Olympics and now they compete in the

3951
02:39:02,631 --> 02:39:04,250
Olympic final.
What's interesting is we,

3952
02:39:04,251 --> 02:39:08,330
they had don Catlin in there and Don
Catlin guy for America that does the

3953
02:39:08,331 --> 02:39:09,380
same thing.
Does he?

3954
02:39:09,410 --> 02:39:11,420
And he was gonna,
he was gonna be the first guy I

3955
02:39:11,421 --> 02:39:13,070
remember.
Then he backed out and he said,

3956
02:39:13,071 --> 02:39:15,320
I'll give you the Russian guy.
Cause he knew the Russian guy,

3957
02:39:15,321 --> 02:39:17,060
he taught does it for America.
He,

3958
02:39:17,061 --> 02:39:21,410
he's the guy that's our doping control.
Like he are doping control guy.

3959
02:39:21,440 --> 02:39:22,970
He's our,
our um,

3960
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:24,730
what,
you saw a guy or he,

3961
02:39:24,731 --> 02:39:28,790
he's a guy that did all the drug test
for the Olympics from like the eighties

3962
02:39:28,791 --> 02:39:32,180
on.
But he's not the guy that dopes up the

3963
02:39:32,181 --> 02:39:35,150
American Nazi doesn't really clearly he
doesn't dope them up.

3964
02:39:35,151 --> 02:39:38,450
He's the guy that tests them.
We should tell people what ecourses too

3965
02:39:38,480 --> 02:39:39,440
if they don't know what we're talking
about.

3966
02:39:39,441 --> 02:39:43,010
So this would be a standalone podcast.
It's documentary that Bryan Fogel made

3967
02:39:43,011 --> 02:39:48,011
where he decided to rice rice a ride his
bike in a race.

3968
02:39:48,950 --> 02:39:50,540
So clean,
completely clean,

3969
02:39:50,541 --> 02:39:54,080
and then do it on steroids to see what
his times would be,

3970
02:39:54,110 --> 02:39:55,580
how much,
how much benefit it would have.

3971
02:39:55,880 --> 02:39:58,250
And in the process of him filming this
documentary,

3972
02:39:58,251 --> 02:39:59,690
the guy who hooked him up,
this guy,

3973
02:39:59,691 --> 02:40:03,800
gregory from Russia,
who was the head unbeknownst to him of

3974
02:40:03,801 --> 02:40:06,890
the Russian state sponsored doping
program,

3975
02:40:07,190 --> 02:40:11,060
he was like,
he thought he was getting a guy who was

3976
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:13,980
like the rush and you saw that,
that it was going to tell him what

3977
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:17,160
the cheaters use.
But it turned out along the way,

3978
02:40:17,161 --> 02:40:19,620
everything got exposed and he was like,
look,

3979
02:40:19,621 --> 02:40:21,870
I did this for 40 years.
I dope everybody,

3980
02:40:21,871 --> 02:40:23,910
everybody on drugs.
And like he said,

3981
02:40:23,940 --> 02:40:27,960
every fucking single athlete that was in
the Olympics was on some shit.

3982
02:40:28,230 --> 02:40:30,000
And then he explained how they did it
and everybody's like,

3983
02:40:30,001 --> 02:40:33,030
what the fuck?
And then they were going to pull the

3984
02:40:33,031 --> 02:40:34,650
Russians.
And then the other thing that he exposed

3985
02:40:34,651 --> 02:40:39,330
is the,
the collusion between water and the IOC

3986
02:40:39,420 --> 02:40:42,460
and that they all work for each other
and they switched fucking rolls and they

3987
02:40:42,461 --> 02:40:45,720
go back and forth to each other and that
they're not going to punish the Russians

3988
02:40:45,750 --> 02:40:48,770
and that.
But what they're doing now is they kind

3989
02:40:48,780 --> 02:40:50,850
of have to,
because all of that movie,

3990
02:40:50,910 --> 02:40:53,340
I mean that movie literally changed the
Olympics.

3991
02:40:53,400 --> 02:40:54,750
I guess what I'm saying is when I did
bigger,

3992
02:40:54,751 --> 02:40:55,501
stronger,
faster,

3993
02:40:55,501 --> 02:40:57,660
and we're going around and talking to
the experts,

3994
02:40:57,720 --> 02:40:59,130
you know,
a lot of the experts,

3995
02:40:59,790 --> 02:41:01,170
they would mention gone catlin.

3996
02:41:01,170 --> 02:41:02,520
I'd be like,
what's up with Don Catlin?

3997
02:41:02,521 --> 02:41:03,810
And they'd say,
Oh man,

3998
02:41:03,811 --> 02:41:06,390
if you get him to talk,
I mean the sports world will just

3999
02:41:06,391 --> 02:41:08,540
crumble.
And everybody kept saying it like,

4000
02:41:08,541 --> 02:41:10,240
I heard it from like four to people.
How,

4001
02:41:10,260 --> 02:41:11,093
sorry,
experts.

4002
02:41:11,310 --> 02:41:15,630
They just said like nobody would believe
in sports if that guy expose what he

4003
02:41:15,631 --> 02:41:17,790
knew.
And so then I interviewed Don Catlin,

4004
02:41:17,791 --> 02:41:19,390
but he just laughed when I asked him.
And he's like,

4005
02:41:19,391 --> 02:41:20,610
God,
they don't know what they're talking

4006
02:41:20,611 --> 02:41:21,031
about,
you know,

4007
02:41:21,031 --> 02:41:22,590
kind of thing.
And you're to know,

4008
02:41:23,930 --> 02:41:25,560
I'll see you guys later.
And I said,

4009
02:41:25,561 --> 02:41:25,921
well,
look,

4010
02:41:25,921 --> 02:41:27,990
Charles East St Louis is an expert.
He said,

4011
02:41:27,991 --> 02:41:30,870
the whole sports will crumble if they,
if they knew what you knew,

4012
02:41:30,900 --> 02:41:32,100
what do you know?
And he said,

4013
02:41:32,101 --> 02:41:34,890
I don't know anything.
And so you're not,

4014
02:41:35,560 --> 02:41:36,900
you're never going to get an answer like
that.

4015
02:41:36,901 --> 02:41:38,880
Something has to get exposed through a
different way.

4016
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:43,080
So I shouldn't,
I can't say without a ship,

4017
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:45,420
without a shadow,
beyond a shadow of a doubt that that's

4018
02:41:45,421 --> 02:41:48,030
the truth.
But I suspicious of that guy,

4019
02:41:48,150 --> 02:41:50,460
I should say,
and suspicious of our system.

4020
02:41:50,700 --> 02:41:52,140
I don't think they're the only ones
doing it.

4021
02:41:52,380 --> 02:41:56,790
There's no way that the only ones doing
that China had a record number of gold

4022
02:41:56,791 --> 02:42:00,150
medals when they hosted it.
We're doing it just as bad as they are.

4023
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:01,940
I wonder,
I mean,

4024
02:42:01,950 --> 02:42:03,450
we're doing it better.
Obviously we're not,

4025
02:42:03,451 --> 02:42:04,500
we're not getting caught.
But I mean,

4026
02:42:04,990 --> 02:42:08,530
so when you say we as a country state
sponsored a marrow,

4027
02:42:08,540 --> 02:42:08,831
no,
no,

4028
02:42:08,831 --> 02:42:09,664
no,
no program.

4029
02:42:10,460 --> 02:42:13,530
I don't think state sponsored.
But I'd think like maybe some people

4030
02:42:13,531 --> 02:42:16,380
doing something somewhere.
There's some sort of network,

4031
02:42:16,381 --> 02:42:19,350
some shenanigans.
There's one balco there's 10.

4032
02:42:20,430 --> 02:42:21,990
There's gotta be more than one bowel.
Yeah,

4033
02:42:22,110 --> 02:42:24,030
I think so.
There's gotta be more than one guy

4034
02:42:24,031 --> 02:42:26,280
that's like telling people what to take.

4035
02:42:27,960 --> 02:42:29,850
A lot of that shit out there.
But listen,

4036
02:42:29,851 --> 02:42:31,710
man,
keep me posted on your movie.

4037
02:42:31,770 --> 02:42:34,050
Let us know when,
when this nutrition,

4038
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:35,440
do you have a name for it yet?
Uh,

4039
02:42:35,640 --> 02:42:37,290
we've been,
we've been talking about on carbs.

4040
02:42:37,300 --> 02:42:38,630
So you're talking about the war cars
with,

4041
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:40,680
we've been debating whether or not
that's the right,

4042
02:42:40,830 --> 02:42:44,190
it's a very catchy things,
especially now because people are so

4043
02:42:44,191 --> 02:42:45,600
aware.
There's so many people that are

4044
02:42:45,601 --> 02:42:48,210
switching to low carb,
high fat diets and having some pretty

4045
02:42:48,211 --> 02:42:50,280
spectacular results.
Yeah.

4046
02:42:50,340 --> 02:42:52,590
I mean there's a lot of,
there's a lot of evidence behind it.

4047
02:42:52,620 --> 02:42:53,730
You know,
and if you,

4048
02:42:53,780 --> 02:42:56,970
you were saying before,
I'd like to see somebody take all these

4049
02:42:56,971 --> 02:43:01,200
diets and compare them.
And they did that in the 70s or the 80s,

4050
02:43:01,201 --> 02:43:05,460
I forget when it was.
It was Dr. Gardner from Stanford and he

4051
02:43:05,461 --> 02:43:07,500
was a vegetarian,
so he took a Vegan diet,

4052
02:43:07,501 --> 02:43:08,460
vegetarian diet.

4053
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:10,680
The Atkins Diet was the Diet at the
time.

4054
02:43:10,681 --> 02:43:12,610
It wasn't like a Keto Diet,
um,

4055
02:43:12,640 --> 02:43:16,540
the dash diet and the ornish diet.
And He'd put them all together and they

4056
02:43:16,541 --> 02:43:18,430
did a lot,
like a pretty big elaborate,

4057
02:43:18,431 --> 02:43:19,390
I don't know how big it was.
So,

4058
02:43:19,400 --> 02:43:21,370
I don't want to say,
but they're pretty elaborate study.

4059
02:43:21,790 --> 02:43:24,040
And at the end of the day,
the Atkins Diet,

4060
02:43:24,220 --> 02:43:27,370
basically one most weight loss,
best health marker improvement,

4061
02:43:27,730 --> 02:43:29,920
Atkins Diet,
and the guy who was a vegetarian and he

4062
02:43:29,921 --> 02:43:33,010
said at the end of the study,
this was a really tough pill to swallow.

4063
02:43:33,730 --> 02:43:35,260
You know,
and I think that's a really interesting

4064
02:43:35,261 --> 02:43:36,460
thing.
They did this study.

4065
02:43:36,530 --> 02:43:38,930
Did you know that Atkins had a bunch of
heart attacks?

4066
02:43:39,800 --> 02:43:43,610
Coronary heart disease is 258 pounds
when he died.

4067
02:43:43,640 --> 02:43:45,140
Yeah.
And um,

4068
02:43:45,210 --> 02:43:48,020
someone was saying,
well heard that stuff wasn't true

4069
02:43:48,021 --> 02:43:48,831
though.
No,

4070
02:43:48,831 --> 02:43:49,221
no,
no,

4071
02:43:49,221 --> 02:43:50,060
no.
He was,

4072
02:43:50,270 --> 02:43:50,700
no,
he,

4073
02:43:50,700 --> 02:43:53,660
that's how big he was when he died.
And it definitely had heart disease.

4074
02:43:53,780 --> 02:43:55,790
So it definitely did.
But the question is,

4075
02:43:56,360 --> 02:43:59,990
did he have heart disease before he did
this diet was even on his own diet.

4076
02:44:00,320 --> 02:44:02,870
I mean,
was his diet based on science and fact

4077
02:44:02,871 --> 02:44:03,351
and,
and,

4078
02:44:03,351 --> 02:44:07,250
and efficacy.
But did he follow it or did he just eat

4079
02:44:07,251 --> 02:44:07,830
ice cream?

4080
02:44:07,830 --> 02:44:09,360
Fuck off all day?
We don't know.

4081
02:44:09,390 --> 02:44:10,670
But he died by hitting his head.
Right.

4082
02:44:10,671 --> 02:44:11,400
It fell on his head.

4083
02:44:11,400 --> 02:44:14,610
Fell and hit his head.
But see,

4084
02:44:14,970 --> 02:44:18,630
this all came from a tweak that I read
from John Joseph from the Cro mags,

4085
02:44:18,631 --> 02:44:23,631
who's a pretty rampant,
a rabid vegan and a bad ass,

4086
02:44:23,900 --> 02:44:26,190
you know,
triathlete and very,

4087
02:44:26,191 --> 02:44:27,720
very athletic guy.
Right.

4088
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:29,230
Um,
he's,

4089
02:44:29,350 --> 02:44:31,080
he is the one that said that and I was,
oh wow.

4090
02:44:31,081 --> 02:44:33,330
Is that true?
And he said that the guy died of a heart

4091
02:44:33,331 --> 02:44:35,580
attack and that his wife was covering it
up.

4092
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:40,050
So I went to look into it and it's very
difficult to say because,

4093
02:44:40,080 --> 02:44:43,330
um,
even snopes had as inconclusive.

4094
02:44:43,480 --> 02:44:44,031
Yeah.
Yeah.

4095
02:44:44,031 --> 02:44:45,180
It's like,
Ooh.

4096
02:44:45,330 --> 02:44:48,030
Like he might have had a heart attack
and fell and hit his head.

4097
02:44:48,260 --> 02:44:49,920
It's,
I mean the guy had heart disease,

4098
02:44:50,070 --> 02:44:51,250
but the question is,
look,

4099
02:44:51,450 --> 02:44:53,700
some people have heart disease and it's
congenital.

4100
02:44:53,701 --> 02:44:55,920
They're born with issues and there is,
there,

4101
02:44:55,921 --> 02:44:58,350
there are people that are more,
I mean,

4102
02:44:58,380 --> 02:45:00,120
they're just more likely to have heart
attacks,

4103
02:45:00,300 --> 02:45:03,330
just like to some people that are more
likely to have strokes and more likely

4104
02:45:03,331 --> 02:45:05,820
to have arthritis.
There's just issues that people have.

4105
02:45:06,090 --> 02:45:08,520
So we don't know whether or not he was
born with that.

4106
02:45:08,521 --> 02:45:11,610
If he had that,
but also if he's at 258 pounds,

4107
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:15,690
he clearly isn't following it's fucking
diet unless he's a giant.

4108
02:45:15,970 --> 02:45:17,010
Yeah.
How old was he?

4109
02:45:17,490 --> 02:45:19,320
He was an old guy and he's in his
seventies,

4110
02:45:19,321 --> 02:45:20,640
I believe.
Maybe late sixties.

4111
02:45:20,820 --> 02:45:21,810
Find it.
Pull,

4112
02:45:21,811 --> 02:45:22,860
pull,
pull up the,

4113
02:45:22,861 --> 02:45:25,980
um,
the Wiki on him on,

4114
02:45:25,981 --> 02:45:27,000
um,
uh,

4115
02:45:27,450 --> 02:45:29,130
Dr. Atkins.
What was his name

4116
02:45:29,400 --> 02:45:30,900
from Robert?
Robert Atkins.

4117
02:45:30,901 --> 02:45:32,550
Robert Atkins.
But you know how he died?

4118
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:33,211
Yeah,
that's the thing.

4119
02:45:33,211 --> 02:45:34,044
It was like,
um,

4120
02:45:34,960 --> 02:45:37,110
you were talking about him,
the guy.

4121
02:45:37,140 --> 02:45:38,880
Yeah.
But the Diet that he created is

4122
02:45:38,881 --> 02:45:40,320
different than the actual guy.
Right.

4123
02:45:40,321 --> 02:45:41,790
And we don't know if he was doing his
diet.

4124
02:45:41,791 --> 02:45:45,240
So we call that the people who were
doing this diet that were in the study.

4125
02:45:45,390 --> 02:45:47,010
Right.
They ended up coming out on top as well.

4126
02:45:47,011 --> 02:45:50,610
I'm saying the guy who created crossfit,
he's not in shape.

4127
02:45:50,820 --> 02:45:51,653
Right?
I mean,

4128
02:45:52,560 --> 02:45:54,010
you ever see him?
Yeah.

4129
02:45:54,011 --> 02:45:55,260
He,
he's got some issues,

4130
02:45:55,261 --> 02:45:58,740
I believe some injuries and stuff that
don't allow him to do all this stuff to

4131
02:45:58,741 --> 02:46:00,180
crossfit does.
Right.

4132
02:46:00,270 --> 02:46:01,103
But yeah,
he's

4133
02:46:01,230 --> 02:46:04,380
[inaudible] 72 when he died,
days prior to his death,

4134
02:46:04,470 --> 02:46:07,260
he fell and hit his head and see New
York pavement,

4135
02:46:07,800 --> 02:46:09,020
a New York's blah,
blah,

4136
02:46:09,050 --> 02:46:09,411
blah,
blah,

4137
02:46:09,411 --> 02:46:11,840
blah.
Admitted April 8th he underwent surgery

4138
02:46:11,841 --> 02:46:14,210
to remove a blood clot in his brain but
went into a coma.

4139
02:46:14,480 --> 02:46:17,780
So we don't know.
I mean it says that's how he fell and he

4140
02:46:17,781 --> 02:46:20,150
hit his head.
We don't know why he fell and it may

4141
02:46:20,151 --> 02:46:23,180
very well have been that,
but here it says metal exam has offered

4142
02:46:23,200 --> 02:46:27,140
her office a year after his death showed
that Atkins had a history of heart

4143
02:46:27,141 --> 02:46:30,650
attack.
Can jet congestive heart failure?

4144
02:46:30,651 --> 02:46:34,380
What does congestive heart failure and
hypertension ingestive means.

4145
02:46:34,460 --> 02:46:35,390
Okay,
that's not good.

4146
02:46:35,870 --> 02:46:39,110
His widow refuse to allow an autopsy.
Oh that's interesting.

4147
02:46:39,140 --> 02:46:42,770
That is interesting because does Wa
widow refuse to allow an autopsy because

4148
02:46:42,771 --> 02:46:47,450
this guy wasn't healthy and maybe wasn't
even following his own advice,

4149
02:46:47,451 --> 02:46:49,700
but he was,
what was his weight when he died?

4150
02:46:49,730 --> 02:46:51,410
Maybe cause it's going to say that
Jamie,

4151
02:46:51,680 --> 02:46:56,210
his wife might've felt that he's going
to get ripped apart in his death and she

4152
02:46:56,211 --> 02:46:57,870
didn't want that.
Maybe 72 years old.

4153
02:46:58,040 --> 02:47:00,520
You can find out what his weight was
when he died.

4154
02:47:00,530 --> 02:47:05,060
Cause I'm pretty sure he was 258 pounds
and you're 258 pounds.

4155
02:47:05,061 --> 02:47:07,910
It's 72 years old.
That shit ain't good.

4156
02:47:09,170 --> 02:47:10,370
You know,
does it say is,

4157
02:47:10,500 --> 02:47:14,780
wait,
I'm very,

4158
02:47:14,810 --> 02:47:16,730
very sure that he was very heavy.

4159
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:21,290
Robert Atkins,
258 pounds when he died.

4160
02:47:21,410 --> 02:47:24,020
I'm pretty sure that's how.
So here's the thing,

4161
02:47:24,500 --> 02:47:26,510
was that from the Diet,
I mean it does.

4162
02:47:26,930 --> 02:47:29,600
How's that possible?
I mean if the guy's making people lose

4163
02:47:29,601 --> 02:47:34,100
weight on this diet and he himself is
fat and he himself has serious heart

4164
02:47:34,101 --> 02:47:36,530
failure,
258 pounds,

4165
02:47:36,531 --> 02:47:40,610
that is dell release report by New York
City officials outrage the act and

4166
02:47:40,670 --> 02:47:44,600
Atkins people.
So he had a history of heart attacks and

4167
02:47:44,601 --> 02:47:48,710
congestive heart failure and 258 pounds.
Well I don't think he exercised.

4168
02:47:48,711 --> 02:47:51,050
I think he probably didn't,
but that doesn't mean anything.

4169
02:47:51,080 --> 02:47:53,570
I mean the over eight obviously too,
but it's like,

4170
02:47:53,690 --> 02:47:56,480
was the guy following his own advice?
We don't know.

4171
02:47:56,680 --> 02:47:59,960
There's a lot of people that look,
I think at this cream is tempting per

4172
02:47:59,970 --> 02:48:02,180
spaghetti's tempting,
you know,

4173
02:48:02,181 --> 02:48:04,280
who doesn't like a good meatball sub
every now and again?

4174
02:48:04,310 --> 02:48:04,850
Who knows?

4175
02:48:04,850 --> 02:48:07,820
At the end of the day,
we're all on this a race who can see

4176
02:48:08,070 --> 02:48:09,620
who's going to live the longest.
Right.

4177
02:48:09,621 --> 02:48:11,060
And I there,
I think that's,

4178
02:48:11,450 --> 02:48:15,620
there's still no like real conclusive
proof is there that one diet people can

4179
02:48:15,650 --> 02:48:17,990
live longer,
but forget about the other longest

4180
02:48:17,991 --> 02:48:19,160
because that's really out of your
control.

4181
02:48:19,161 --> 02:48:20,840
What about the quality of life while
you're alive?

4182
02:48:20,870 --> 02:48:23,120
That's what I think of.
If you're 258 lbs,

4183
02:48:23,121 --> 02:48:25,220
your quality of life sucks unless you're
a giant.

4184
02:48:25,730 --> 02:48:28,220
Unless he's as big as Frances and Ghana,
you know?

4185
02:48:28,250 --> 02:48:30,130
I mean really literally.
That's like in Ghana,

4186
02:48:30,140 --> 02:48:31,910
his weight class.
How the fuck?

4187
02:48:32,430 --> 02:48:33,000
Yeah,
that was,

4188
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:37,070
is that how that big,
let's Atkins is fucking giant gorilla.

4189
02:48:37,280 --> 02:48:38,113
I mean,
how was he?

4190
02:48:38,360 --> 02:48:41,420
How was he have 258 pounds?
That's not good.

4191
02:48:41,440 --> 02:48:43,070
I agree with you.
Quality of life.

4192
02:48:43,071 --> 02:48:44,480
Like,
if I'm here,

4193
02:48:44,870 --> 02:48:47,210
you know,
if I'm going to get an extra two years,

4194
02:48:47,211 --> 02:48:51,140
but I'm going to be like weak and feeble
and not able to do anything,

4195
02:48:51,141 --> 02:48:54,740
like what are those two years' worth?
It I feel that the best diet is the one

4196
02:48:54,741 --> 02:48:57,890
you can follow.
And utilizing a ketogenic style diet and

4197
02:48:57,891 --> 02:49:00,950
utilizing intermittent fasting,
I think it helps kill hunger.

4198
02:49:01,440 --> 02:49:05,330
I think it helps kill cravings.
And so I think it's a diet that in my

4199
02:49:05,331 --> 02:49:07,980
opinion one of the easier diets to to it
might be hard

4200
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:10,440
for some people that really like carbs
and they might have to find something

4201
02:49:10,441 --> 02:49:11,620
different.
Uh,

4202
02:49:11,670 --> 02:49:14,070
but for me it's always worked for him
it's always worked well.

4203
02:49:14,071 --> 02:49:17,550
He is essential.
Atkins Diet did put people into ketosis.

4204
02:49:17,900 --> 02:49:19,120
Yeah.
Fed.

4205
02:49:19,180 --> 02:49:21,960
It wasn't really the um,
the goal of it.

4206
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:26,130
It wasn't a goal to get weird shit to
eat a lot of like bars and things like

4207
02:49:26,131 --> 02:49:28,200
that.
You intake sugar,

4208
02:49:28,201 --> 02:49:31,490
alcohol and a lot of things in there
that probably are just not great for you

4209
02:49:31,491 --> 02:49:33,430
to imagine.
Those atkins bars are really good if you

4210
02:49:33,431 --> 02:49:34,590
like to Fart.
Yeah.

4211
02:49:34,620 --> 02:49:36,990
I mean that stuff is fun.
Clear a room.

4212
02:49:37,800 --> 02:49:40,440
They make some crazy stuff and like,
like chocolate,

4213
02:49:40,450 --> 02:49:43,860
caramel,
anything that's going to be like that

4214
02:49:43,861 --> 02:49:46,000
can't be good for you in any way really.
You know,

4215
02:49:46,400 --> 02:49:47,233
flavors.
Yeah.

4216
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:49,140
It's all fake.
And that's hot farts.

4217
02:49:49,490 --> 02:49:51,600
Yeah.
Whether you're doing a ketogenic diet,

4218
02:49:51,630 --> 02:49:54,820
a Vegan diet or any diet,
you should stick to real whole foods.

4219
02:49:55,410 --> 02:49:58,140
And one of the things Rob Wolf taught me
was,

4220
02:49:58,200 --> 02:49:59,940
you know,
by things that don't have nutrition

4221
02:49:59,941 --> 02:50:01,890
labels on them.
And just that simple thing.

4222
02:50:01,891 --> 02:50:02,820
When you think about it,
you're like,

4223
02:50:02,910 --> 02:50:06,180
yeah,
if I buy vegetables all neat and it

4224
02:50:06,181 --> 02:50:07,790
doesn't have that.
Okay.

4225
02:50:08,250 --> 02:50:09,990
Gotcha.
Let's wrap this up.

4226
02:50:10,050 --> 02:50:11,130
Uh,
big,

4227
02:50:11,131 --> 02:50:14,190
strong fast on twitter.
Mark Smelly Bell on twitter.

4228
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:15,720
Uh,
tell people about your gym.

4229
02:50:16,470 --> 02:50:18,360
I got super training gym in West
Sacramento.

4230
02:50:18,361 --> 02:50:21,150
The gym is free.
We're having a seminar April 22nd.

4231
02:50:21,151 --> 02:50:24,180
If you want to come out the gym,
how the fuck do you survive with the

4232
02:50:24,181 --> 02:50:25,014
gym?
That's free.

4233
02:50:25,070 --> 02:50:27,150
And he had millionaire,
cause I got a lot of products.

4234
02:50:27,151 --> 02:50:29,120
I invented a product called the
slingshot.

4235
02:50:29,130 --> 02:50:31,980
People just work out at your gym.
I let people just work out at my gym.

4236
02:50:32,760 --> 02:50:35,340
Good luck.
It's going to be a fucking cavalcade.
