00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,863
Hello

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:02,963
Bitches,
I want to talk for a little bit about 

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,173
the cryotherapy because this is 
something that I emailed you when there 

4
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:08,934
was a disturbing article that was sorta 
poopooing the benefits cryotherapy in 

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,710
the article was I thought it was really 
poorly.

6
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:14,820
Well,
poorly done,

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,953
poorly researched and it was also,
it was studied really subjective things 

8
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:26,211
like how sore you felt after exercise 
and whether or not benefited from that,

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,563
but yeah,
but there are real positive benefits of 

10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,060
Cryo therapy that are measurable.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,290
Yes.
And that happened as well.

12
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,230
First of all that article that you're 
referring to from that,

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,200
um,
whatever website it was,

14
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:44,700
but the article was Steve Novella is a 
guy and I think what he did is he rushed

15
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:45,534
to put this article out because that 
woman died in Las Vegas from Cryo 

16
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:51,270
therapy and it was a really tragic 
incident.

17
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:52,104
She was by herself.
There's two different types of cryo 

18
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:55,500
therapy.
One of the things we should point out,

19
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,483
first of all,
I don't have any guys I've been accused 

20
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,100
of this.
I should just say right now,

21
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,200
I don't have any vested interest in 
cryotherapy.

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,060
I don't own any of it.
I don't.

23
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,130
I don't make any money from it.
Nothing.

24
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:09,630
I enjoy the benefits of it and I use it,
but this woman who did it,

25
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,670
she did the type.
There's two kinds.

26
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,880
One of them goes from the neck down,
so you stand in this booth.

27
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,190
Your head is above breathing and normal 
oxygen,

28
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:19,320
but below you is liquid nitrogen.

29
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,260
You can't read that stuff in.
That's why your head is not under.

30
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,650
If you do breathe that stuff in,
you don't have any oxygen.

31
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:27,600
You'll black out and that's what 
happened to her.

32
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,493
She did it by herself.
It was poorly set up and apparently she 

33
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,524
was quite short so her head was kind of 
below the the the limit where you're 

34
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:37,974
supposed to be.
So she was breathing in the liquid 

35
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,790
nitrogen and she fell asleep and blacked
out.

36
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,710
So you get one of those times I thought 
she was in like,

37
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,030
no,
no,

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,530
no,
no.

39
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,363
The full on ones are much rarer and what
the full on ones do is they super cool 

40
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:53,184
the air with the nitrogen.
So the air itself is pumped in really 

41
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:58,104
cool.
What I did,

42
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,180
that's what you did and that's what 
we're gonna do today too,

43
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:01,014
if you have the time.

44
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,071
I love that.
Okay,

45
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,550
let's do that one.
You can breathe in.

46
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,860
It's just fucking unbelievably cold.
Okay.

47
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,920
So the one that she did was she set up 
by herself,

48
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:11,754
which you're never supposed to do.
You're always supposed to have 

49
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,120
supervision.
So it wasn't whether or not.

50
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,790
I mean she's the only person I've ever 
heard of this died from this.

51
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,130
And it's a horrible trash committing 
suicide.

52
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,880
No,
no.

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,850
She was just worried there.
And sometimes women will,

54
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,693
um,
they'll put their face under it because 

55
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:30,010
they want the effects of a cryo facial 
[inaudible].

56
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,480
Cryo facial has been shown to improve 
Collagen and

57
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,350
flattens your therapy actually prevents 
it.

58
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:37,184
Stopped.
It inhibits enzymes that break down 

59
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:39,104
collagen called college and is.
And that's actually part of the reason 

60
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:41,834
it helps with arthritis.
Arthro College Nase is break down 

61
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,150
Collagen and they break down like,
you know,

62
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,360
the tendons college and around the 
tendons and seven,

63
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,210
it can cause arthritis,
arthritic pain.

64
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,960
So doing it would make sense why you'd 
want to do something cryo because it.

65
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,550
It would have an effect.
Right?

66
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,060
I understand.

67
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,893
Yeah.
Women love it when they get their face 

68
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:00,070
done.
Apparently get or

69
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,930
vein men to or any man.
Hello,

70
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,823
you don't have to be vain to college.
But the point being that article came 

71
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,790
out and all these people were saying,
oh see,

72
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,890
I told you cryotherapy was bullshit.
I'm like,

73
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,080
oh my God,
what a Piss poor article.

74
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,153
And it was all talking about soreness 
and one of the things that he said that 

75
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,094
really drove me crazy was you.
You'd get just as much benefit from a 

76
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:22,030
cool down and stretch after a workout.
I'm like,

77
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,750
tell that to these fucking people that I
see that go there all the time,

78
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,040
that do it twice a day because they have
severe arthritis and it's the only thing

79
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,020
that's given them any form of,
of,

80
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:35,260
of freedom,
of movement of their hands.

81
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,483
I know a bunch of people that go there 
that have had some really debilitating 

82
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:39,934
arthritis and this has given them relief
where nothing else was given it to them 

83
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,233
other than like pretty severe 
pharmaceutical drugs or Ibuprofen at 

84
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:47,860
high levels or what you were talking 
about,

85
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,570
like there's a lady that goes to my 
thing,

86
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:52,930
but she was raving about how she can 
finally stretch your hands out.

87
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,170
Like her hands had been locked in this 
position for years.

88
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,400
Yeah,
it has.

89
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,233
I mean the,
the cold itself is a hormetic stressor 

90
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,960
that is activating a variety of 
antiinflammatory pathways,

91
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,120
antioxidant pathways.
You know,

92
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,610
and it's also last time I think on the 
podcast we talked about,

93
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:13,540
it increases norepinephrine,
norepinephrine itself.

94
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,374
It can.
So cryotherapy and cold water immersion 

95
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:17,644
are two forms of cold exposure.
Cryotherapy just two minutes at like a 

96
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,720
minus 180 Fahrenheit can increase 
norepinephrine.

97
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:28,660
Twofold.
That's twofold over what you were before

98
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:29,494
you went in and nor epinephrin.
In addition to the brain benefits we 

99
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:33,640
were talking about how it makes you feel
good,

100
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,474
how it helps with learning.
It also is a very potent anti 

101
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,163
inflammatory,
so it inhibits the production of TNF 

102
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,310
Alpha,
which is very.

103
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,410
It's kind of like in arthritis,
tnf Alpha is kind of like going haywire.

104
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,253
You're making too much tnf Alpha,
and what happens is tnf alpha is a 

105
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,590
signaling molecule to or your immune 
cells that says,

106
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:55,750
hey,
there's an infection here because that's

107
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:56,584
normally what happens when you release 
Tnf Alpha is because there's some 

108
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:01,960
bacteria or some something that you need
to kill.

109
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,420
And so your immune cells,
all they see is the signal.

110
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:05,254
They don't know what's causing it.
They don't know that it's because your 

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,833
gut cells and your immune cells in your 
gut are seeing bacteria because of your 

112
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,374
poor diet or whatever.
And so that's getting into the 

113
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:15,070
bloodstream and causing chronic 
inflammation.

114
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,263
It doesn't know that it.
All it knows is that this means there's 

115
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:18,844
a threat.
And so they start to increase the 

116
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:24,520
production of your immune cells make 
hypochlorite,

117
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,473
which is like bleach.
So you're making bleach in your body to 

118
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:29,860
kill things.
And that's happening chronically.

119
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,860
That's gonna cause some tissue damage.
It's going to cause pain.

120
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,091
Um,
it also,

121
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:34,924
they also make hydrogen peroxide.
You make that your immune cells will 

122
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:38,174
make that so cryotherapy inhibits the 
signaling molecule so that your immune 

123
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:45,280
cells quiet down because now they're not
seeing that signal that says,

124
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,271
come on,
hey,

125
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:47,290
fire up,
fire up.

126
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,123
It's not there.
So that's a good thing to inhibit tnf 

127
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:51,670
alpha.
And like I said,

128
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:53,610
with the college and a's as well.
Um,

129
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,290
but there are so many.
I did,

130
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,143
you know,
I just spent two weeks just researching 

131
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:01,020
and reading.
I've been doing some cold exposure,

132
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,050
you know,
like cold shower and also jumping in the

133
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:06,740
ocean ice bath.
And I really liked the cryotherapy,

134
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,693
um,
that I did last time we were here and 

135
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:11,330
uh,
you know,

136
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,980
so I've,
I've been very interested in it,

137
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,873
like understanding why you feel so good.
And so I did some reading on it and 

138
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:18,584
there's so many different positive 
hormetic benefits from doing 

139
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:22,790
cryotherapy.
So you have,

140
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,721
you know,
the,

141
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:27,230
the,
the anti-inflammatory part and this,

142
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,273
and this also,
it's been shown that doing like 10 

143
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:30,434
sessions of cryotherapy in a row,
it increases the expression of 

144
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,340
glutathione reductase by twofold.

145
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,330
And another glue of that fly on related 
enzyme glutathione peroxidase by like 68

146
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:42,164
percent.
And these are these enzymes like you 

147
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:46,820
could be taking all the liposomal 
glutathione you want,

148
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,683
like it's not going to matter if you 
don't have the enzyme's active to use 

149
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:51,224
it.
So you can take lyposomal glutathione 

150
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,900
and that's great.
You're increasing your,

151
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,770
you make glutathione inside of 
yourselves.

152
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:58,740
But,
um,

153
00:06:59,050 --> 00:06:59,883
we,
we can't make as much of it as we get 

154
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:01,664
older,
but if you take it and you don't have 

155
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:04,724
the enzymes that use it to actually do 
the good stuff active that it doesn't 

156
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:08,444
matter.
So cryotherapy was shown to activate to 

157
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,760
different glutathione related enzymes,
which is pretty awesome.

158
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,150
So it would enhance your body's ability 
to absorb glutosiome no,

159
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:19,520
it doesn't enhance your body's ability 
to absorb it.

160
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:20,354
It enhances your body's ability to use 
it right off the bat and then you're 

161
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,570
using cryotherapy.

162
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,250
It would enhance it.
Um,

163
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,460
so what I'm saying is that the lyposomal
glutathione that you take,

164
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,850
all that does is increase glutathione 
inside of yourselves.

165
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,480
Gludethyon inside of your cells does 
nothing without enzymes that use it to,

166
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,053
uh,
to basically sequester damaging 

167
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,070
inflammatory things.
And the cryo therapy increased,

168
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,410
activates the enzymes that use it.
So it's like,

169
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,333
great,
I have all this food with Iowa and 

170
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:53,984
sitting around on myself that I've been 
taking and I also now have the enzymes 

171
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,730
that use it to do good stuff now are 
being turned on that.

172
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,400
What was very interesting is that it 
took like multiple sessions before,

173
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,080
before those got like 10 to 2010 and one
at least 10 and yeah.

174
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,140
And then the other study was 20.
So it was it consecutively at 10 days in

175
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:15,230
a row.
Yeah,

176
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,620
10 days in a row.
But the first day I didn't do it.

177
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,570
So that,
that was also very interesting.

178
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,700
So it's almost like your body is saying,
okay,

179
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:25,250
this crazy fuck of them.
And do data response.

180
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:25,911
Yep.
Yeah.

181
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:27,800
Your body's preparing for war.
It's like a,

182
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,990
it's stressful.
It's a stressful response.

183
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,800
The other thing that's really cool that 
we didn't talk about last minute podcast

184
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,400
is the thermogenic effect when you,
when you release Nora norepinephrine.

185
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,603
So that's,
I keep going back to that because it's 

186
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:43,820
like you can't refute that.
Steven Novella,

187
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,610
no one know debunker,
no skeptic,

188
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:47,930
no,
I don't care who you are.

189
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,070
You can't.
It's just,

190
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,910
it's consistent in every type of cold 
exposure period.

191
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,933
It's,
it's,

192
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,430
it's consensus.
You release norepinephrine will.

193
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:57,264
There always seems to be some sort of a 
rationalization with a lot of the 

194
00:08:59,161 --> 00:08:59,994
debunking.
Like whether it's the benefits of 

195
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,274
exercise,
whether it's the benefits of 

196
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,330
cryotherapy.
That's almost like a rationalization for

197
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:07,140
not doing it.

198
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,973
It's like you're looking for an excuse 
to not do it and not really very 

199
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:14,270
objective that was,
which was disturbing about it.

200
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:17,780
It's like this is like you're poopooing 
something that's often people grape.

201
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,100
Yeah,
I,

202
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,700
it was clear.
I mean after I especially,

203
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:22,770
especially after I did the two weeks of 
research.

204
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,110
I mean I think there's a kind of 
mentality when you're.

205
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,770
Sometimes people like to think I'm a 
deep thinker and I'm not,

206
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,690
I am.
I am intentionally.

207
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:31,524
Like.
Because if you get in this mentality of 

208
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,650
always debunking something,
you're,

209
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,270
it's like the spiral and you can't see 
the good.

210
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:42,210
Like you can't keep an open mind to like
get past.

211
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:44,550
You're like,
what's in your box that you know?

212
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:48,570
And that's very dangerous.
I think that blind spot it is.

213
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:51,600
And there are a lot of scientists that I
know they're very smart,

214
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,463
extremely smart,
but they are in that loop where it's 

215
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,350
like just they have to debunk and 
criticized and it's like,

216
00:09:58,351 --> 00:09:59,184
you know,
at some point huge discoveries are made 

217
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:04,630
by like connecting the dots and like 
getting past that like,

218
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,510
I mean you have to be critical.

219
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,120
Being critical is very important,
but you also like,

220
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,490
I think there's a certain threshold 
where you just start to like,

221
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,860
you know,
you get to this like spiral,

222
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,400
but well it was also was infuriating 
about this as the data's out there.

223
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,500
This is not like,
it's not like there's no data.

224
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:20,334
It's like he made a cursory examination 
of the evidence and what he chose to 

225
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,973
focus on was it was so subjective.
It was focused on a study that tested 

226
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,200
muscle soreness,
posts,

227
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:33,660
exercise with cryotherapy.
Well,

228
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:36,930
actually the study that he referred to 
as a Meta analysis,

229
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:37,764
and it was subjective,
but it actually came to the conclusion 

230
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:44,280
that there were benefits,
however it said more studies that needed

231
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:45,114
to be done because there wasn't large 
enough sample sizes and the quality of 

232
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,074
data was poor because there were not 
double blinded placebo controlled 

233
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:54,180
clinical trials and I have to say to you
so that,

234
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,970
so they're actually what he resided in 
that article.

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,833
There was a positive effect of the cow,
but the problem is is that because they 

236
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,040
followed it up with,
oh well it's poor quality,

237
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,083
basically poor science.
The reality is is that you can't do a 

238
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:12,420
double blinded placebo controlled,
controlled trial with cryotherapy.

239
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,523
Like you're going to be cold and they're
gonna be putting this chamber where 

240
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:18,110
there's like cold or you're not and 
you're gonna know,

241
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,550
you know.
So anyways,

242
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,320
I thought that was ridiculous.
I just like whatever.

243
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:23,010
I'm in Oregon,
I'm gonna.

244
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,450
I'm going to read about this stuff 
because I know I've experienced it.

245
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:28,284
There's definitely something going on 
and one of the things that happens is 

246
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:34,440
the norepinephrine and when you 
released,

247
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,690
when you released that norepinephrine,
it activates a pathway in,

248
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:40,860
inside of your cells,
um,

249
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,250
that basically our causes,
your energy metabolism,

250
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,550
metabolism to ramp up because you're 
trying to generate heat,

251
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,490
you want basically your body wants to 
heal.

252
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,360
Your body is saying,
I don't want to die,

253
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,490
I need to make heat.
And so a couple of ways it can do that.

254
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:57,460
One,
it can shiver and shivering is when your

255
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:01,880
muscles start to contract and that it 
requires energy for your muscles to like

256
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,220
twitch.
It's very,

257
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,340
it's not very thermodynamically 
favorable.

258
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:08,650
So you,
it's not a good way to generate heat but

259
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:11,800
you generate heat because you have to 
like ramp up to twitch.

260
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,050
But then what happens after you've been 
exposed?

261
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:16,210
And actually this happens to me because 
we did the crowd twice.

262
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:18,460
The first time I did it,
I was shivering.

263
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,593
The entire time I was shivering.
It was really crazy because I've never 

264
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,993
shivered like that in my life.
But the second time I went in I did not 

265
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:27,610
shiver.
And after reading about it,

266
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,100
what happens is your body quickly adapt 
so you adapt.

267
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,680
And what happens is non shivering 
thermogenesis,

268
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,580
so the nor epinephrin causes your 
Mitochondria,

269
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:39,730
which are the energy producing little 
organelles inside of yourselves,

270
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,703
what causes them in your,
in your adipose tissue to like get 

271
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:44,494
activated.
And it does this by increasing the 

272
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:46,954
expression of a gene called UCP,
one which basically freaks your 

273
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,440
mitochondria out because your 
mitochondria are kind of like batteries,

274
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,423
they're charged,
they have a negative charge on the 

275
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,370
inside and a positive charge on the 
outside.

276
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,960
Will you see p one totally uncouples 
that so that there's no more charge.

277
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,200
And that charge is very important 
because when that charge is there,

278
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,640
your body knows,
okay,

279
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:10,150
I've been making energy because the way 
you make the charge is by making energy.

280
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,980
So when the charge goes away,
your body's like,

281
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,750
oh my God,
I know energy.

282
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,270
So it just starts to ramp up fat 
metabolism.

283
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,270
So it does that and you start to make 
more mitochondria.

284
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:20,104
So you're,
you're making more mitochondria in your 

285
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:23,350
fat cells.
And this is often called Brown fat.

286
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,150
Um,
so you can actually,

287
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,093
the reason it's called Brown fat is 
because when you look at a fat cell 

288
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:29,920
under the microscope,
if it has more Mitochondria,

289
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,113
then it looks Brown,
so you actually start to burn fat and 

290
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,550
you have this thermogenic because you're
burning fat.

291
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:39,040
It's creating heat as a byproduct so 
you're warming your body,

292
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,040
but it has this nice side effect of 
burning fat,

293
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,903
which people like.
And the more you expose yourself to the 

294
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,840
cold,
the more you're browning your fat,

295
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,430
the more you're increasing those 
mitochondria,

296
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:49,264
your fats,
which means the next time you're in the 

297
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,850
cold,
you can tolerate it longer.

298
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,340
So people that have been exposing 
themselves to cold,

299
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,320
like yourself,
when you're doing the Cryo,

300
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,243
you know,
often you actually can tolerate the 

301
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,103
colder for longer periods of time 
because you have more mitochondria in 

302
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:04,660
your fat cells.

303
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,270
And this allows you to then generate 
more heat.

304
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,430
So,
and this has been shown in people,

305
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,833
people that have been exposed to a cold,
that they have been shown to increase 

306
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:14,590
their,
their,

307
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,850
um,
Brown adipose tissue.

308
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:16,684
But like 38 percent,
if they're exposed to 10 days of 50 

309
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:20,860
degree air,
like outside air,

310
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,410
just regular air,
50 degrees all day,

311
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,410
10 days.
So like six hours a day out and like,

312
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,580
you know,
New York in the winter or fall,

313
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:31,414
I don't know,
something like that being out there for 

314
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:33,214
six hours for 10 days in a row.
Men were able to increase their brown 

315
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:37,690
adipose tissue by like 38 percent or 
something like that.

316
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,360
Why people from the east coast or from 
the northeast?

317
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:43,120
The move to California and then they go 
back during the winter,

318
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:43,954
they go home.
My blood gut too thin was really is 

319
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,683
there really is like a physical factor 
of your body not being accustomed to 

320
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,220
dealing with Colebra.

321
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,230
You adapt,
you adapt.

322
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:53,820
And that's what Brown adipose tissue.
And that's really one cold.

323
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,230
How cold got really popular.
Popularized because people wanted to use

324
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,150
it as a hack to lose weight,
you know?

325
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:00,020
So they were like,
Oh,

326
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:00,854
if I do these cold showers,
I use it for the brain benefits because 

327
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:08,000
I noticed I feel really good and also 
more focused.

328
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,953
So I like that.
And a lot of people I've talked to have 

329
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,910
felt the same way.
Um,

330
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,030
but then I think the other part of this 
article was the,

331
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,690
the effects of it blunting some of the 
strength training and you know,

332
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,573
I talked about this in this report that 
I wrote or the in the podcasts that I 

333
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:26,304
released and it's so complicated I had 
to like sit there and literally just 

334
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:32,480
read for like two weeks to try to figure
it out because you know,

335
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:35,360
the problem is that exercise is a 
hormetic stress.

336
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,420
Cold is a hormetic stress.
So exercise itself,

337
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,343
you need some of the inflammation,
you need the bad stuff to get the good 

338
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,580
stuff.
That's how it works.

339
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,893
But you know,
the inflammation that's happening 

340
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,670
happens while you're exercising and up 
to one hour after,

341
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,833
one hour after.
That's when the whole hormetic response 

342
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,044
kicks in.
And this has been shown in multiple 

343
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:55,514
studies.
One hour seems to be when the anti 

344
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:58,824
inflammatory response kicks in.
So you've generated the implementation 

345
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:03,320
and then now you've got the 
antiinflammatory effects.

346
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,600
If you do a cold exposure within that 
hour after exercising,

347
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,093
it's possible.
You may blunt some of the inflammatory 

348
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:13,154
effects that the exercise is inducing 
because the cold is activating anti 

349
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:19,970
inflammatory genes too early.
Now I don't know that for certain,

350
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:20,804
but I do know that this study that 
showed there was one study that showed 

351
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:25,370
strength training.
If you did it,

352
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:27,380
there were,
if you did see cryotherapy immediately,

353
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:31,040
like immediately after a Cold War,
it was actually cold water immersion,

354
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:31,874
which is not the same as the Cryo cryo 
chamber that it blended some of the 

355
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:37,400
anabolic I'm signaling.

356
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,800
And so there was like some of the muscle
mass was,

357
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,290
was not gained,
but you know,

358
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,800
there's other studies that have been 
done that have shown for some reason.

359
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:47,840
All the insurance guys,
they always wait an hour.

360
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,253
It's kind of weird.
So what I'm wondering is if people that 

361
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:55,730
are doing this research like sit down,
take a step back,

362
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,470
you know,
people are always in this.

363
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:59,000
I got to publisher to publish,
you know,

364
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,073
was a real big publisher parish 
mentality in science where it's like 

365
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,050
your bread and butter depends on your 
publishing and so you're just constantly

366
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,230
trying to get that data out there.
But you really,

367
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,093
I think things are so complicated just 
to sit down and take a look at 

368
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,870
everything that's out there and start to
go wait a minute,

369
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:15,704
there's lots of little details that need
to be considered to design this trial 

370
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:19,814
correctly.

371
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,820
So I'm hoping that at least for those 
people doing strength training,

372
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:23,654
that they'll do one where they actually 
wait until an hour because there's been 

373
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:27,344
other studies where there that um,
strength to strength training in 

374
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:33,560
combination with cryotherapy done much 
later.

375
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,900
Even the next day.
There are actually benefits,

376
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,793
performance benefits.
Like they were able to do more of those 

377
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,013
leg curl things.
I don't know what they called leg 

378
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:42,074
extensions.
Those,

379
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,303
you know.
So,

380
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,270
you know,
I,

381
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,103
I,
I don't really know what's going on but 

382
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:46,804
at what I do know is that it seems as 
though it's very likely that doing the 

383
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:52,410
cryotherapy like immediately after and 
now.

384
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,370
Then again,
if you're,

385
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,020
if you're talking about someone that's 
doing,

386
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,303
like there's been studies that have been
published showing that people that are 

387
00:17:58,711 --> 00:17:59,544
doing two bouts of exercise.
So they're like riding a bike and then 

388
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,840
they,
they're waiting,

389
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,973
whatever.
Our 30 minutes and then they go and run 

390
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,004
or something.

391
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,410
If they do cold water immersion in 
between those,

392
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,540
they actually have performance 
enhancements,

393
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,230
but you know,
if they,

394
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,050
if they wait,
I'm sorry,

395
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,880
I have to do it between two bouts of 
exercise.

396
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,740
Some of that's due to the fact that 
cold,

397
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,873
the cold water,
it seems to improve heart rate 

398
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:23,514
variability.
It's actually been shown to improve it 

399
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:25,764
by like two to three fold.
So heart rate variability is the change 

400
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,640
in oscillation between heartbeats and 
it's also,

401
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:33,780
um,
people,

402
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,810
people judge a,
the heart recovery from a workout.

403
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:38,850
So as soon as you're done with an 
intense workout,

404
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,760
the ability of your heart rate to lower 
immediately within minutes,

405
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:43,710
that's like a marker of heart rate 
variability.

406
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:47,100
And it's supposed to be good because 
you're able to deal with these stressful

407
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:47,963
changes,
you know,

408
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,460
because when you're making cortisol or 
something,

409
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:54,240
your heart starts racing more or some of
these other stress hormones.

410
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,950
Uh,
so it's been shown to improve that.

411
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:56,880
And,
and having,

412
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,043
being able to have your heart rates 
slower right after a workout and then 

413
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,573
immediately going into a workout again,
you can imagine there would be a 

414
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,890
performance enhancement with,
with that.

415
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,280
So there's also,
there's a difference in the,

416
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,480
the physiological response between cold 
water immersion and Cryo therapy,

417
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:13,261
right?
Well,

418
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,210
it depends,
you know,

419
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:18,360
if you're there,
there are differences in the ability for

420
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:21,480
those two different modalities to 
extract heat from the body,

421
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,773
know if we're talking about submerging 
ourselves and cold water up to our 

422
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,540
shoulders.
Um,

423
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:33,290
water or ice is a much better.
It's much better at extracting heat from

424
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:36,420
the body than error.
Um,

425
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,870
but surface area also plays a role and 
the end,

426
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,713
the temperature change.
So if you're sitting in cold water 

427
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:43,840
that's 57 degrees,
um,

428
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,180
that's not as cold as going into a minus
180 or whatever crowd chamber.

429
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,480
But you can also sit in the cold water 
for a lot longer.

430
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,280
So I to do it for 15 minutes.
I think that there has been a study that

431
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,114
compared the norepinephrine release,
20 seconds at 40 degree water up to the 

432
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:06,081
shoulders is comparable to two minutes 
at a minus standard,

433
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:10,410
something one 80 minus one 84,
no epinephrin,

434
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:13,460
but a lot of these effects are mediated 
from Nora Norepinephrine,

435
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,080
but listened for 20 seconds at 40 to 
reverse those two minutes.

436
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:16,914
So imagine,
imagine staying in the water for five 

437
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:19,434
minutes in that and this has been shown,
so if you have someone that stays in 

438
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:23,544
water 57 degree water for an hour,
they increased their norepinephrine by 

439
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,990
fivefold instead of twofold.
So you have a more robust response so it

440
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:31,824
could be good,
but it could be bad if you're talking 

441
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:34,884
about doing it right after a strength 
training session and jumping into cold 

442
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:38,730
water for five minutes.

443
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,863
That could.
That could have some very potent anti 

444
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,080
inflammatory effects.
So the best way to handle it would be to

445
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:48,310
wait at least an hour,
I think.

446
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,200
Yeah,
that makes sense.

447
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,140
What about anti inflammatory markers in 
the blood?

448
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,263
So there happened studies that have 
shown that cryotherapy lower c reactive 

449
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,730
protein,
which would be an inflammatory marker,

450
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:04,900
and then the glutathione related enzymes
going up and also superoxide dismutase,

451
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:05,734
that would be a marker for inflammation 
because there's also a decrease 

452
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:11,650
inflammation when you have more of 
those.

453
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,870
So,
so cryotherapy does.

454
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:14,980
And then also,
um,

455
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,040
there's been mark measurements of TNF 
Alpha going down.

456
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:22,090
Like I said,
I'm also another marker that macrophages

457
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,820
release macrophage inhibitory protein or
something,

458
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,860
some inflammatory molecule that's made.
There's less of it when you,

459
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,813
when Cold War,
I can't remember if it was cold water 

460
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:34,120
immersion or cryotherapy,
but it's cold exposure.

461
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,433
So.
And that was mediated through north and 

462
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:38,770
ignore epinephrin mediates a lot of 
stuff.

463
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,480
It's,
it's mediating the brain effects.

464
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:42,880
It's meeting in thermogenesis,
it's antiinflammatory,

465
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:43,714
it's anti-pain.
People get injected with norepinephrine 

466
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:48,610
and their spine to alleviate a pain.
Yes,

467
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:50,590
because it's anti-inflammatory.
Wow.

468
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,753
Jesus.
There's probably other things going on 

469
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:56,200
as well.
So science just science,

470
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,043
just the hard science.
There's plenty of evidence that there's 

471
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:00,640
benefits to crow therapy.
Oh yeah.

472
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,830
So why would need write an article like 
that?

473
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,930
I'm,
like,

474
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:06,040
I said,
there's the,

475
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:10,690
there's the bad article that was the 
anabolic blunting effects which was done

476
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,033
immediately after exercise,
which made a huge splash because it's 

477
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:14,801
like,
Whoa,

478
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,900
you're right,
your gains.

479
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,980
And then you have the,
the,

480
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,630
the hardcore,
very skeptical people that are like,

481
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:24,460
well,
the quality of data,

482
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:25,600
you know.
Well the thing is,

483
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:26,434
is that there's a large body of data and
sometimes if you can't have a double 

484
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:33,310
blinded placebo controlled trial,
then you have to look at mechanism.

485
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,950
You have to look at animal studies 
combined with human studies.

486
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,010
You have to understand what's going on.
You can't refute the norepinephrine.

487
00:22:40,011 --> 00:22:41,950
And we know that in orbit difference 
doing all these things,

488
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,023
you know.
So I think you just have to be very 

489
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:47,800
comprehensive,
especially when the,

490
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,230
when you know,
there's the argument that the,

491
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:54,310
there's no placebo controlled trials are
too subjective,

492
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:56,530
but there's lots of ways that it's not 
subjective.

493
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:59,530
And this has been measured in people.
People have measured c reactive protein,

494
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:01,090
they've measured these enzyme 
activities,

495
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,510
they've measured these inflammatory 
molecules and people also when animals,

496
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,310
you know.
So I,

497
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,273
I'm confident when I say that there are 
absolutely health benefits from doing 

498
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:13,810
cold exposure for your brain,
anti-inflammatory,

499
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,920
for,
um,

500
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,450
for thermogenesis.
