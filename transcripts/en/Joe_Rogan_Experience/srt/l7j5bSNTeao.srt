1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,930
Someone said this,

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,070
I think it was Terence Mckenna,

3
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,760
that people have a problem with something
that's real that you can't hit with a

4
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:06,420
hammer.

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:06,780
Right.

6
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,610
And I think that's a
real way of putting it.

7
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:10,790
It's a real interesting because
farts are real as fuck dude,

8
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,240
and you can't wrap your hands around them,

9
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,710
but you know they're real.

10
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,880
Sound is real.

11
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,950
But we accept it because
we're so used to it.

12
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,110
The idea of this invisible thing can,

13
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:23,580
can transmit music and harmony and
beautiful feelings and make you fucking

14
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:25,660
pumped up and you hear it
in your car singing it.

15
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:25,920
What?

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,120
What the what the fuck is that?

17
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,970
It's invisible shit and invisible.

18
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,251
Shitty,

19
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:31,110
but it's coming for
fucking satellites down.

20
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,520
We want to think that we've got the
whole world figured out who want to think

21
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:40,050
that we know what's real and what's here
and that all the weakened sense is all

22
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:40,830
it is there.

23
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,431
And I say,

24
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,151
fuck that.

25
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:42,421
I said,

26
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:42,790
that's sure

27
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,160
did us,

28
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,640
dude,

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,940
we are weird.

30
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,611
We're weird.

31
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:58,050
And we don't realize how weird we are.

32
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,640
Like while we're being weird,

33
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,490
we don't realize it.

34
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,300
[inaudible] you got to work
on this life to make money,

35
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,410
but the fuck is money.

36
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,041
Who are you?

37
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:05,910
What is this?

38
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,230
What are we doing here?

39
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,920
And if you look at the resources that
you have available to you being 24 hours

40
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:12,570
in a day and a certain
amount of your health,

41
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,480
I think about what you dedicate
most of that resources too.

42
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,950
And what's your reward on that?

43
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,101
Well,

44
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:17,934
you got a house,

45
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,880
you got a box where you can fucking
pass out every night in front of the

46
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:21,714
television.

47
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,793
Is that what you're doing?

48
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,100
The idea that you need to do anything
stupid and people just always telling me

49
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:26,521
that you're like,

50
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:26,671
oh,

51
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:27,361
you need to grow up.

52
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:28,194
You need to grow up.

53
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,370
What do you what to do?

54
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:30,300
What to die,

55
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:30,900
Dwight,

56
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,070
to fall into line,

57
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,480
to fucking follow a pattern.

58
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,530
You don't need to do anything.

59
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:35,341
Nobody was doing anything.

60
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:36,330
You need to breathe,

61
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,470
you need to eat food.

62
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,440
The rest of his is the structure that
we've sort of invented to sort of give

63
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:41,340
ourselves something to do.

64
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:42,360
When we wake up in the morning,

65
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:42,680
well,

66
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,061
it's nine.

67
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,160
I am trying to go to work.

68
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,120
Work's not real.

69
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,540
The car's not real life,

70
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:46,950
not real.

71
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,330
This is what's real heartbeats.

72
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,470
And when those bitches stop,

73
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:54,471
all that shit that you
created and stockpiled and
worked for means not nothing.

74
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,290
These objects that didn't
even exist when you're dead,

75
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:58,741
when you're dead,

76
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:01,380
you're going to go to another dimension
where you can't take this shit with you,

77
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:01,921
you know,

78
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:02,430
or not,

79
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,151
or delights you.

80
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:03,950
Shut off.

81
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,790
Life is about us interacting with each
other and if you can contribute in any

82
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:09,330
way,

83
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,780
there's a lot of people that are great
parents that contribute to this world by

84
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:13,860
being a great parent,

85
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,140
by raising someone who's going
to influence other people,

86
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,570
and a lot of them don't necessarily
get too much credit for that.

87
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,100
That's an incredible resource.

88
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,580
And the idea that every one of
them is just fucking up the world.

89
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,340
Whatever the world's fucked period.

90
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:26,751
It's we're,

91
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:26,991
we're,

92
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:29,210
we're 2014 all right.

93
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,010
The direction that we're
going in is fucked.

94
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,470
It's all fucked was too many of us.

95
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,790
There's too much pollution.

96
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,020
It's not changing.

97
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,560
There's no,

98
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,050
there's the,

99
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,230
the global warming is happening
whether you like it or not,

100
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:42,020
whether you blame it
on democratic Vaginas,

101
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:42,840
sponsors,

102
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,161
whatever,

103
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:43,290
the,

104
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,940
whatever you do doesn't matter.

105
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,500
Yeah.

106
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,320
Blue Live,

107
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,010
just live,

108
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,843
be alive.

109
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,020
I could just see that and being cut
into one of those youtube videos.

110
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:53,460
That's somebody who
isn't in the background.

111
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:56,940
There's like people walking fast
than the sun rising really slow.
