1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,270
Shazamm pitches. Yes. We're
back four days a row this week.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,860
That's how crazy. That's a crazy, we live
in out here on the west coast. Holla.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,990
Let me see. I just made it an
east coast west coast thing.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,470
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,670
There's no different way to do this.
I've done it every possible way. Um,

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,510
I'm just gonna say it. Uh, what is
the flashlight Joe? No, I have not.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,010
I actually reused it.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,230
Yesterday I was watching my girlfriend
on camera was another girl and I used my

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,820
flashlight. Wow, buddy.

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,160
He had a little personal what the
whole rest of the world right there.

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,710
There's a lot of people that they're
not comfortable with someone that they

12
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:39,750
think is their friend,
like little Brian red band,

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,460
telling them about fucking
and watching things.

14
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:45,780
Have you ever done when there's that moral
degenerate, like you bad for society,

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,290
have you ever seen one of those webcams
house? Yes, I have. It's pretty cool.

16
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,840
When he sent me to a link the other day
that was a he, he goes, what the fuck?

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,070
The mother load. And, uh,

18
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:57,420
I go to the link and it's this some crazy
cam site where it's all girls that are

19
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:01,050
topless. They like playing with themselves
and it's all free. Yeah, it's weird.

20
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:01,920
It's like,
like you can,

21
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,160
there's the one I used as stream mate
and you can go to and just have a

22
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:07,960
conversation for the girl while
she's like sitting there topless.

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:08,791
And then she's like,

24
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:12,060
you want to go in a private room for $10
and then you do whatever you want to in

25
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:15,010
the private room. And, but
this was all virtual. Yeah.

26
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,160
Like this is like webcams and stuff.
And so,

27
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,060
but there were so many old ladies and
fetishes that that was just creepy to look

28
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,130
at. Like at an old lady. Like
there was like an old lady.

29
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:24,610
I was like maybe 75 years old.

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,110
Let's get through these commercials so
we could talk about this flashlight.

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,160
I want to hear about this,
I want to hear about this,

32
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:31,800
but let's get through these stupid
commercials cause that sounds too good to

33
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,390
just be delegate adult.

34
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:36,570
The adult industry has always
been pioneers of new technology.

35
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:40,110
Whether it was like home, video, you know,
and then like on the Internet, I mean,

36
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:42,630
they've always been the first.
And when we have virtual reality,

37
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,120
I bet virtual sex will be pioneering.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right, let's go.

38
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,630
We're gonna get to that.
We're going to get to that,

39
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,070
but let's get this out of the way.

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,710
Flashlights sponsored Joe rogan.net
entering code name. Rogan get 15% off.

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,150
It's a,
it's a solid product.

42
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,000
The best fake vagina out there really
is way better than mass period.

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,810
There were also brought to you by
[inaudible] Dot Com oh andN I t makers of

44
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:06,600
Alpha brain, the cognitive
enhancing supplement that I use.

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,910
I didn't take one this morning,
so let's see if I stumble,

46
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,150
if I stumbled over my words today. I
don't have any more. You took all my dude,

47
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,340
I gave you something. Did I give
you some of the new stuff? No, no.

48
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,030
I got some new stuff for
you. Need to get on it. Oh,

49
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,990
and what is this shit? What is
it? What are you talking about?

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,240
We're talking about nootropics
and when nootropics are there,

51
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,260
vitamins that are designed to
enhance the function of your mind,

52
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,240
the way you're thinking works,
and they work,

53
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,050
they work if they're only going to
get better. Yeah. Do you try stuff?

54
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:36,650
What do you do? I have
not, but I'm a, you know,

55
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,480
David Pearce who wrote the hedonistic
imperative talks about, you know,

56
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:43,320
how nano technology eventually it's going
to be used to like design vaster and

57
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:45,510
more broader versions
of human intelligence.

58
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:50,511
And I'm sort of all about tinkering with
ourselves in order to sort of improve

59
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:55,050
ourselves. We're the ultimate art project
is us, right? So it's kind of like, yeah,

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,710
why not? I got to get you some of
this just to see if you like it. Um,

61
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,100
I have some people have gotten it,
are completely

62
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,310
addicted to it. It's, it's fascinating
stuff. I like it. Some people,

63
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,890
they're the most, the most important
thing about this product I should say,

64
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:08,470
is that we have for the first order,
for your first 30 pills,

65
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:11,380
there's a money back guarantee. 100%
you don't have to send the product back.

66
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,880
All you have to do. Say, you know what,

67
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:15,160
the stuff didn't work for me and
you get 100% of the money back.

68
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,900
We are way more concerned with having
people feel like they're not ripped off.

69
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:23,830
Then with making money, so a check
out the stuff. It's all on a.com.

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,400
We have a sports related supplements,

We have a new mood, which is a five HTP
supplement, which boosts your Serotonin,

72
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,650
actually makes you feel happier. It's
great stuff. It's all healthy for you.

73
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:38,710
It's all, it's all explained online
is a frequently asked questions.

74
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:43,150
You can go into it in depth and and
Google nootropics and try out all the

75
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:45,160
different stuff that's out
there and just check it out.

76
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,740
But go to [inaudible] dot com

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,890
Jason Silvas back.
He's slinging experience.

80
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,180
Try by day Joe Rogan podcast all day.

81
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,500
Jason Silva come back to
sling more cosmic Dick.

82
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,960
You said we are cosmic revolutionaries.
I say, you're a cosmic Dickson.

83
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,323
I love that.

84
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,560
Wow. Well, thank you for having me
back, dude. Last time. It was so fun.

85
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,310
Thanks man. So funny, a great time.

86
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,460
I just a shout out to all these amazingly
engaged listeners and followers,

87
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:30,710
dude, that the response was so positive
and so yeah, we have a really light,

88
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,560
totally positive

89
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,080
propositive group of people that follow
the show and it sounds ridiculous. Um,

90
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,270
how do you do that? I mean, how
does that ever happen? I don't know.

91
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:41,740
But if your authenticity, man,
well, if I'm, I'm honored.

92
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:45,020
If that's what it is, what it, whatever
it is. I'm honored. Comes across, man.

93
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,180
When we go to clubs,

94
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:49,240
that's the thing that the waitresses
are always saying that our crowds are so

95
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:52,480
nice and that they tip really well
and it just makes you feel so good.

96
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:53,350
It's like the most,

97
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,440
the biggest feeling of accomplishment
that I've ever had is someone who listened

98
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,610
to the show once and said, your show
makes me want to try to be a better way.

99
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,610
This is the kind of feedback that we've
been getting about our MindMeld. Dude.

100
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:06,510
It's been insane.

101
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:10,350
Like some people have created these remix
videos where they've taken highlights

102
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:14,610
and sound samples from all we've talked
about to imagery and set them to music.

103
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:17,550
And that's kind of like
what the creativity and the
whole remix culture is all

104
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:18,990
about.
It's not about where you take things from,

105
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:22,410
it's where you take them to see
that. It's just like, oh my God,

106
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,700
there's a bunch of those out there now.

107
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,980
There's so many guys that
are really good at that too.

108
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:30,850
There's so much creativity and most
of them have like regular jobs.

109
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,420
They're just like regular
dudes. So they're doing it
out of pure passion. Yeah.

110
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,530
Like says there's a kid,

111
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:39,250
he calls himself the paradigm shift
on Youtube and I met him and you know,

112
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:43,480
he's a man, he's just really fucking
talented. 90 he made this thing for me,

113
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:47,170
the American war machine. And uh, I
mean it's like, it's, it's humbling.

114
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,650
It's humbling because you, you, you
hear the words that you say and they,

115
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,830
the kind of the words seemed just kind
of obvious things that you've thought of

116
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,660
and set up a hundred times.
Right. But then when you,

117
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,030
this kid puts it to
images or video and music

118
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,180
and you see the power of an idea of the
power of an idea to live on beyond its

119
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:05,750
inception, beyond the moment that it came
out of your mouth. There was this guy,

120
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,810
the thinking primate is
the youtube name and bay.

121
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,600
They did a remix of us and I
thought it was glorious. Honestly.

122
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:14,680
I thought it was glorious. Yeah, there's
a lot of those guys out there and yeah,

123
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,380
we're, we're super honored
that they do that. It's a,

124
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,880
one of the coolest things of all time.
It's so weird.

125
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,410
It's a weird thing going on right now,
man.

126
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:24,200
I think the Internet is kind of
ushered in a whole new culture.

127
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,850
I really do believe that.
It's, uh, it's, well, you can't
get by on bullshit anymore.

128
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,270
It seems like a culture of massive
collaboration and cooperation.

129
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,220
And even that recent example of that,

130
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:39,221
a viral video that they made about
Joseph Kony in Africa and it reached 100

131
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,240
million views in a week,
you know, and like,

132
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,080
and I think that just what
it shows between that and
also the Anti Sopa movement

133
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:46,790
online. I think that what
it's really demonstrating,

134
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:51,791
it's just the ability to create viral
swells that have massive impact without

135
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:56,810
having used like mainstream media
for example, let's just make a video,

136
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:00,500
put it on Youtube for free and have
a voice in the national conversation.

137
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,960
Like everybody can do that.

138
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:07,280
And the price points keep going down and
down and down exponentially. And it's,

139
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:11,960
there's no reason not to think
like, God, what comes next?
Well, yeah, well this guy,

140
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:14,990
I don't know the whole store and the
guy who orchestrated the whole Kony

141
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:17,920
campaign, and I've seen some
criticisms about him, but it did,

142
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,820
didn't really make much sense to me.
I mean,

143
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:23,180
it seems like this guy really is a war
criminal and what this guy's doing by

144
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:26,300
exposing that. And it was like, yeah,
we're exposing a really, a guy has tons,

145
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,550
some terrible, horrible
things. Oh, no, absolutely.

146
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,580
I just think the success of the campaign,
it's amazing.

147
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,980
Game Changing, game
changing, viral success, uh,

148
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,040
also is going to invite a
scrutiny that comes with that.

149
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,330
But whatever the controversy is,
that's a whole separate conversation.

150
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,160
I think the real conversation is, you
know, people, democracy, social movements,

151
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,720
revolutions, take note. This is
how you join the conversation.

152
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:56,420
This is how you get your voice heard.
No need to like take up arms,

153
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:59,840
no need to be violent. Like you want
to get something heard, you know,

154
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,260
have a good video editor and a good
sense of aesthetic presentation. Yeah,

155
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:06,620
no shit. That's kind of amazing, isn't
nothing. You know, I saw that the tweets,

156
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:08,960
they started coming in,
you know, this Kony Kony,

157
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:13,960
Kony and I knew who the guys want. The guy
was, I, I'd, I'd read about his, uh, his,

158
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,880
his move with Africa
and you saw Peter Pan.

159
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,230
It's all exactly the same
as Kone. Really? Yeah.

160
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,550
Then the Peter Pan is still the kids that
go to an army and isn't that horrible

161
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:27,590
though, that that actually
is happening at someone.

162
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,530
They're stealing children and forcing
them to become soldiers. I mean,

163
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:34,760
it's just terrifying stuff. It's really,
really horrifying. Horrifying stuff. Yeah,

164
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:37,910
no, it's terrible. But I
do think that, you know,

165
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:41,110
we're seeing violence is going down
across the world. I mean this guest,

166
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,310
Steve Pinker, and he has a Ted
Talk, the myth of violence,

167
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:44,480
we might have mentioned it last time.

168
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:48,230
We'll say that if violence is down
across the world and the chances of a man

169
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:50,180
dying at the hands of another man or
the lowest than they've ever been,

170
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,880
now granted there's more people in
the world and there were in the past.

171
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:56,220
But proportionally the violence is a
lot less. And I think as these people,

172
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:58,760
you know, the rising billion in certain
parts of the world coming online,

173
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,840
getting smartphones,
joining the global conversation,

174
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,970
all of a sudden can
have their voices heard.

175
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,340
And the first step to addressing
the problem is, you know,

176
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,760
making an awareness that
the problem is there.

177
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,200
So the importance of it
can resonate with people.

178
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:15,060
And so I think there's reason
to be optimistic about even
the worst of the worst.

179
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,020
I agree.
Getting,

180
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,650
I think less worse automatically go
pessimistic because things aren't perfect.

181
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,090
You know, we look at it and we go, God,

182
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,280
well why is there so much
fucked up shit in this world?

183
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,610
Why is there so much crime? Why is it so
much violence? Why is it so much death?

184
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:31,080
Why is war still here? Why is corruption
still here? But what you don't realize,

185
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:32,670
if you really stop and think,

186
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:37,500
it's like this is the best it's ever
been ever by a Goddamn long shot.

187
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,191
Absolutely.

188
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:42,630
Who's driving on the way over here today
on the highway and it was a nice day

189
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:46,200
here in Pasadena. There was nobody on
the highway. It was like easy traveling.

190
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,830
So nice and beautiful. It's sunny
out and I was thinking how fucking,

191
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,420
how much it would have sucked to Jill
live just 500 years ago to totally just

192
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:57,030
500 a blip in time.
Like nothing.

193
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,800
No cars to fucking horses. There's
no, not even trails out here.

194
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,630
You know you,
you need to see there's a,

195
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:08,250
there's a presentation by this guy called
Hans robling, his website gapminder.

196
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:11,490
He does this thing where he shows all
the nations across the world over time,

197
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:15,090
and how the indicators of quality of
life and infant mortality rate and income

198
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:16,050
and all these,
all these different things,

199
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,630
he shows that all the countries of the
world, even in the worst of the worst,

200
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:22,500
are rising. So the rising tide does lift
everybody else. And it's unbelievable.

201
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,230
And I think the reason that most people
don't realize that things are always are

202
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:27,390
getting better is because of the Amygdala.

203
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,680
Peter Diamandis did a presentation about
this at the Ted conference just a week

204
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:34,500
and a half ago, and he has this book
called abundance. And he explained that,

205
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:34,621
you know,

206
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:37,450
because our brains evolved in a time
where we had to have fight or flight mode,

207
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,290
the Amygdala is always looking for
danger and it supersedes everything else.

208
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,310
And so the media gives us danger because
that's what we're drawn to. You know,

209
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,091
if it bleeds,

210
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:47,610
it leads and we're always going to
be paying attention to what's wrong,

211
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,430
even when there's infinitely
more things that are going right.

212
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,130
And because the media wants to
just get viewership, you know,

213
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:54,840
the mainstream media will
feed us what we want,

214
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:57,540
which is to see all the horrible things
that are happening across the world.

215
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:57,810
Right.

216
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,900
Although eventually that's actually going
to be a good thing because if we can

217
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:03,210
see what's wrong,
we'll try to address it and try to fix it.

218
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,780
But even when we remedied 99% of
the problems that exist today,

219
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,480
our brains are still going to be seeing
the new problems because that's what the

220
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:10,314
brain does.

221
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,920
The amount of time from us running from
Jaguars to to to being a guy steps into

222
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:20,460
a Jaguar and turns the key that
the amount of time is so small.

223
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,370
The biology has never had a
chance to catch. It does not.

224
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,310
We have pretty much the same brains as
we did a hundred thousand years ago and

225
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,800
that's,
I mean a hundred thousand years ago,

226
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:33,801
kind of everyone is agreeing unless
you really go extreme that there was no

227
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:37,350
sophisticated culture which has nothing.
A hundred thousand years is nothing.

228
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:41,850
It's a blame. What the fuck happened
man? Language language guy into it.

229
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,540
Last year we did get
into [inaudible] playing.

230
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,290
You really believe that that just made
everything changed because we could

231
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:50,880
exchange information. Yes. Well, because,
because the moment that we invented,

232
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:52,740
and this is where Terence
Mckenna gets into, you know,

233
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,920
kits Kurzweilian and Kevin Kelly ish and
his comments is that he said that when

234
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:58,960
we invented language,
uh,

235
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,610
biological evolution stopped playing
the key role because it was replaced by

236
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:06,550
this, you know, a cultural
epigenetic type of evolution,

237
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,690
which goes faster and faster and faster
because it accrues knowledge and it

238
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:14,680
builds on itself. And it's not
limited by the hardware of the brain,

239
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:17,260
which would take billions and
billions of years to change, you know?

240
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,240
And so this cultural thing,
you know,

241
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,270
all of a sudden each brain became a
neuron in a vaster global brain of a crude

242
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:28,840
knowledge and intelligence that was
bootstrapping on its own complexity,

243
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:32,810
which is why over the last hundred
thousand years it has been ex the,

244
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,140
the cultural evolution has been
accelerating exponentially.

245
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:37,690
It manifested as technology,
technological evolution.

246
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,230
But what's most interesting is that this
telescoping nature of it gets faster

247
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:44,470
and faster and faster. So over the last
hundred thousand years. Yeah. Crazy.

248
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:48,340
But over the last hundred years even,
it's gotten crazier than the last

249
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,500
billion. No, they say that a thousand
years ago. No one could read silently.

250
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,560
Right. There you go. They
had to read by talking.

251
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,140
They had to say the words
no one could read silently.

252
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,880
And it was actually one of the ways
that some, some guy, I don't remember,

253
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:06,190
some religious figure,
Hamas Aquinas,

254
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,220
maybe it's him not sure proved that
he was a saint because he can resolve

255
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,430
because he could read silently and
then he would recite it. Amazing.

256
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,160
He would look at it and not say anything.
Look at the scripture,

257
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:20,560
not obviously not reading,
cause he wasn't speaking aloud.

258
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,410
And then he would recite it.
Wow.

259
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,170
And that was his master of the
scripture was unparalleled.

260
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,260
It's cause he could read silently.
He was like the only guy. Yeah.

261
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,320
I don't think it's that guy though.

262
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:32,260
It's like it's one of those
other religious people that
may or may not have ever

263
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:35,500
really existed or might not
have been Thomas Aquinas.

264
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,340
I didn't want to ask Sam Harris if he
believed that Jesus was a real human.

265
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,530
That was the end design guys documentary.
I remember as it,

266
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:44,860
he said that he probably
never even existed.

267
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,600
Well cause he shares all the same
attributes as all these other gods and all

268
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,670
these other cultures,
they all die in the same age.

269
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:52,200
They're all born at the same like,
but isn't it also

270
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,370
possible that it could have
been just a real person,

271
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:58,180
but they attached all these
other attributes to him
because of ancient mythology

272
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,560
I suppose. And it just says if you look
at it open, just completely open. Right.

273
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,140
But I don't know if it was a real dude,
but man,

274
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,670
you want to talk about one guy just
kind of dominating religion for like

275
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,970
thousands of years, you
know? Yeah. It's like know,

276
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,910
well he became a meme. If he was at
wasn't, it was no longer a person man.

277
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,410
He became a meat, which, you know, and
Richard Dawkins' book the selfish gene,

278
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:24,170
he says that there was this
new replicator, you know,

279
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:27,590
just like jeans where the replicators
they could multiply and they could evolve

280
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:32,270
over time. That there was a new replicator
that was born above the biosphere,

281
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,840
new kingdom, above the biosphere
and the Denisons of this kingdom,

282
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:40,130
more ideas.
And so he said ideas in the form of memes.

283
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,340
They're like organisms. They've
retained the properties of organisms.

284
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:46,340
Even though they rise above the biosphere,
they replicate,

285
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:51,010
they complete each other, they mutate,
they leap from brain to brain. They come,

286
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,330
they compete for attention, you know,
and he goes crazy. And you know,

287
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:59,390
James Gleek wrote the book,
the information says that the most,

288
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,620
the primary building block of
reality might be information before,

289
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,500
before you know,
it before matter itself.

290
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,200
So he actually says it
comes from bit matter,

291
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:12,920
comes from information and
that information is really
what's at the core of

292
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:17,810
reality. And uh, it's just an
insane idea and endless cause.

293
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:20,750
That goes back to the whole thing about
the power to change the world. People,

294
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,820
ideas,
passions can change.

295
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:26,860
The world because ideas have done
more than jeans over the last hundred.

296
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,530
Well, Mckenna would always go on about
the world being made of language. Yes.

297
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,920
Which is really hard to wrap your
head around, man. That was a,

298
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:39,870
that was a real mind fuck because sort
of, not really, but wait a minute,

299
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:42,500
because two people have to communicate
in order to create something new.

300
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,970
And then you know, you thinking
about infrastructure and cities,

301
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:49,860
that is all a factor of language. Without
language, none of this would be there.

302
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:54,380
It's just, it's so hard to wrap your head
around that. And I think that the, that

303
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,940
he was spot on and I think that the reason
that he was spot on is because when I

304
00:15:57,941 --> 00:16:00,110
think when he says, okay, the
world is made of language,

305
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,470
what he's saying is we create a mental
model of the world in order to understand

306
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,570
the world. In order to speak about
the world and react to the world.

307
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:12,380
We create a mental model in our head
and then we label those pictures in our

308
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:14,520
heads, you know,
symbolically. So we abstract,

309
00:16:14,521 --> 00:16:18,530
defy reality and therefore the way that
we interface reality through the prism

310
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:22,130
of our language, our thinking,
our preconceptions are
stereotypes. Our culture,

311
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,930
which is what they say.
We don't see the world as it is.

312
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,550
We see the world as we are, which
speaks to exactly and directly to it.

313
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,710
I think Mckenna was saying
reality is made of language.

314
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,760
It's almost like it's why like they say
that like even like thinking a happy

315
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,970
thought, we'll start to
make you happier. You know,

316
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:38,630
like essentially the world changes,

317
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,450
you become happier about the
world simply by thinking. It's so,

318
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,940
and it sounds kind of
like new agey and stuff,

319
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:48,941
but like not really because even the
object of description I think does

320
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:51,560
something to influence
one's perception of reality,

321
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:54,530
which is just how you interpret electrical
signals going through your brain

322
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,643
anyway.

323
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,270
And so if you're aware that reality is
made of language and that we're like

324
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:03,050
cocreating it with our intention,
um, and something of course,

325
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:04,580
which is magnified with psychedelics.

326
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:07,640
That's why I've talked about set and
setting being so integral to the trip

327
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,370
because your thoughts about the
trip effect the trip itself.

328
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,020
So thoughts become reality,

329
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,080
but we should think of our
lives as one big fucking trip.

330
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,990
Our normal baseline waking sober lives
is one big heroes journey and, and it's,

331
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,130
and it should be up to us
to think of it so and so.

332
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,450
If we're all on a hero's journey,

333
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:26,780
if we're all on an extended
lifelong mine manifesting,

334
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:28,610
which means a psychedelic trip,

335
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,820
then we have a responsibility to sort
of use words to map our reality the way

336
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:39,800
that we want to be authors of our reality,
of our existence,

337
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:41,360
to make a masterpiece out of life.

338
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,830
One that we would willingly live again
and again for all of eternity. So it like,

339
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,710
like what we're doing now,
our conversation,

340
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,860
it's changing the reality
inside the synapses of those
that are engaging with us.

341
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,550
Just the same way we're changing each
other's reality right now. You know,

342
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:59,280
this is a different reality
than where we were an hour ago.

343
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,620
We're literally interfacing in a
different, yeah, it's university.

344
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:05,370
You don't think about it that
way though. You think, well,

345
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:10,350
we're just doing a podcast,
a podcast in here talking shit.

346
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,700
Yes,
but your portions of your mind,

347
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,470
the output of your mind,
whether it's immaterial or not,

348
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:24,330
I'm still creates tangible impact in
the world. Because think of light,

349
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:29,160
especially like the one or five or 10
people that you might inspire to create

350
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:33,420
some work of art that came out of
what they heard in this conversation.

351
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:38,370
And that worked of art gets licensed
by a brand to create a campaign for

352
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:41,910
creativity that then the government
of Finland adopts in their,

353
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,660
in their policy for education
for the following year.

354
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,050
And it should transforms the lives
of the next generation of students.

355
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,380
The Butterfly effect and transformation
triggered by ideas is more powerful

356
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:58,700
than, you know, I think, you know, uh, uh,

357
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,640
then then that then of the physical world,
I think you're absolutely right,

358
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,590
especially in the age of the Internet.
This is,

359
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:09,090
this is the time where the ideas really
can go viral almost instantaneously.

360
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,630
Like this Kony video and there's,
I mean we do,

361
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,650
I don't even think we've really fully
examine the impact possible through,

362
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,920
you know, through, through
information, especially with with the,

363
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:22,560
what are kids going to be
like, man, what are you know,

364
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,260
20 year old kids going to be
like 20 years from now. All Dude,

365
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,760
just growing up in more
advanced and empowered. Yeah.

366
00:19:29,761 --> 00:19:34,270
Way more aware. Way, way harder
to bullshit. Yeah. Enabled kids.

367
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,520
There's no crazy,

368
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,390
they're going to look back on the
nonsense that we believe today and they're

369
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,190
going to be laughing at us. Ma'Am. Yeah.

370
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,870
I think even the way that you know
how things are voted in, you know,

371
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:50,560
how people resolve issues. I think the
idea of having representatives, you know,

372
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,450
over there to,

373
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,510
to carry our voice to Washington is
obsolete because we are post geographicals

374
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,470
beings at this point.

375
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,570
We don't need somebody else to represent
us necessarily because we can all

376
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,650
represent ourselves and have
a voice online. In fact,

377
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:06,110
there's people that are talking about how,
you know,

378
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,140
we could reform or upgrade or reexamined
like how government is run and how

379
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:12,660
people are represented. I mean I'm
talking like a little farther out,

380
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:15,030
but there's this guy who's starting
this thing as a friend of mine.

381
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,120
His name's Micah and uh,

382
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,410
he used to actually be with students for
sensible drug policy and now he's doing

383
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:21,000
this thing called dynamic democracy,

384
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,690
which is about starting a conversation
and exploring new ways of how the

385
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:28,080
Internet, the human extended nervous
system that's connecting us. All right.

386
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:30,900
Cause we love saying that we are
all connected, we are all empowered.

387
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,040
Well how about we upgrade the
way the world is run, you know,

388
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,870
like on a mega scale. Well we
talk about it, you know? Yeah.

389
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,060
Yeah. I mean that that essentially is
what the Internet is doing, right? Yeah.

390
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:43,771
The Internet.

391
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:47,830
I mean I've heard people be down on the
Internet and I guess you could see some

392
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:48,220
negative

393
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,050
points to anonymity and there's a few
aspects of pornography that are a little

394
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,540
unseemly.
It's definitely accelerated pornography.

395
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,120
I'll tell you that things
have gotten really weird man.

396
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,870
If you want to look at like what happens
to human beings when left alone to

397
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:05,550
their own devices and when,
when allowed to expand in a,

398
00:21:05,551 --> 00:21:07,600
in a contained market like pornography,

399
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,110
there's only so many different things they
can do. So they, they, they, you know,

400
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:15,160
you know what the big thing is lately
that I keep seeing man is girls getting

401
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:19,670
guys to come in them and then they squirt
it into a champagne glass and drink it

402
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,980
and you're like really? Or a Martini
glass really will look, just always ask.

403
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:28,981
Just because these digital tools
extended the range of our creativity,

404
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,870
it doesn't mean that people can't use
that creativity in ways we don't agree

405
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:39,580
with or perhaps in bad ways because just
like we use the power of fire to cook

406
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:43,120
our food, we use the power
of fire to burn other people,

407
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:48,040
which is always a double edged sword
of any expansion and extension of human

408
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:48,960
reach.
But that's,

409
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,110
that's still what evolution is probing
for because we're all seeking out

410
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,960
complexity. It's just going
from single celled organisms,

411
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,620
multicellular organism to beings to
thinking beings to beings who create

412
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:02,290
technology. And so on and so forth.
So it's all happening anyway.

413
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,960
So people say it's not going to stop.
It's part of evolution. But yes,

414
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:08,080
we have to acknowledge that these tools
are double edged sword and that's fine.

415
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:13,090
That's part of it. What makes
people really like doing
that? That's possible too.

416
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:14,310
Right?
I like Billy,

417
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,500
a woman out there that actually likes
to get dudes to shoot loads and,

418
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:20,500
and then she squirts them out
into a glass. It is very possible.

419
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:24,010
And who am I to judge right now?
Shit. Shit that you like. Hey,

420
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,440
people can do whatever they want as long
as they're not hurting anybody else.

421
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,390
It's, you know, it's just weird
that porn is accelerated to this,

422
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,313
to what it is today.

423
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:36,790
A porn was not just porn for a longest
time and know you'd heard rumors of like

424
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,400
snuff films or something crazy,
but no one ever saw one.

425
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,700
Did you ever see a snowfall, Brian
and uh, yeah, it seems snuff films.

426
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,140
We've seen people die on the inner war
now. Real life. Yeah. It's disturbing.

427
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:49,480
But I don't even know if those
are real half the time now.

428
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,190
I remember when nine inch nails had a
snuff film out called broken. It was like,

429
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:58,360
they advertise it like as this bootleg
video and you'd rent it and it looked

430
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:01,810
like somebody murdering somebody else. It
was kind of like faces of death. Oh Wow.

431
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,840
And that's terrible man.
And everyone thought it was a snuff film.

432
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,630
There have been real films, man, for real.

433
00:23:07,631 --> 00:23:12,090
There was a documentary on it a while
back. Um, and that's terrible. Yeah.

434
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,740
And the guy who was the, uh, one of the,

435
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:17,020
one of the people that were interviewing
was talking about watching this film.

436
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:20,200
And as he's talking about watching
the film, he starts crying. Wow.

437
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:23,920
That's pretty intense. Yeah. He's, he's
obviously a pretty fucked up by it,

438
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,610
you know, I remember maybe he didn't cry.
Definitely got choked up. He was like,

439
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,860
just thinking about watching this.

440
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,300
He just a broad spectrum of
human behavior, man. It's got a,

441
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:37,230
we've got a five piece stata.

442
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,950
Is there a way or is it necessary to
have negative in order to influence

443
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:44,410
positive? I mean, is that
a know if that's necessary?

444
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:46,130
I think that was know that the there that

445
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,550
has been something that perhaps has
worked for some people you know to to you,

446
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,690
you got to know what bad is in order to
know what good is. You know, the contrast.

447
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:55,130
But it doesn't mean that we come up,
come up,

448
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:58,540
come up with some more novel solution
that allows us to live, you know,

449
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,360
cause if according to that idea that we
need the bad in order to know the good,

450
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:03,890
it means that it implies
that we're always,

451
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,280
we need to have suffering to appreciate,
you know, when we're not suffering.

452
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:08,114
I don't think that's the case

453
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,740
too. But if you look at
things as being natural,

454
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:13,380
you look at everything as being natural,
like wolf behavior,

455
00:24:13,381 --> 00:24:16,740
be behavior or look at all this
stuff as being natural and, and in,

456
00:24:16,741 --> 00:24:19,560
in and positive towards
whatever their goal is.

457
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,470
Whether their goal is to create
this beehive that they create,

458
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,450
whether their goal is
to create an ant hill.

459
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,480
When you look at human society may be
what we're doing as natural as well.

460
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:34,910
And maybe we're so fucking chaotic and
so crazy because you sorta have to be to

461
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:39,900
be working with technology that's so far
and ahead what your biology is capable

462
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:40,920
of processing.

463
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,220
So we have this fucking wacky tribal
monkey shit going on while we have nuclear

464
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:50,300
power,
while we have Adam,

465
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,510
there's there, there's a
lot going on. And you know,

466
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:57,410
increasingly people are moving into their
own personal universes and soundscapes

467
00:24:57,411 --> 00:24:58,850
and when we have virtual reality,

468
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:03,590
then we each become the God in our
own universe at that point. You know,

469
00:25:03,591 --> 00:25:07,730
an infinity of combinations
and permutations of
lifestyles will be explored by

470
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:12,320
individual individuated nervous systems
living out in the atmosphere of the

471
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:15,560
inner web. You know, um, so
who the fuck knows? But uh,

472
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,700
but at that point we won't care what
that person does in their own virtual

473
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:22,130
universe.
Like the porn is going to be awesome.

474
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,980
It's going to be gross gross ever properly
grocer balut ponds where it's like

475
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,880
it's shoved in the vagina for a week and
then pull it out and somebody eats it

476
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:34,070
or something. Why? I
hope not. I hope, I hope.

477
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:39,071
I hope it actually becomes about like
composing and creating the greatest dream

478
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:43,490
we have ever dreamed to make greater
art than we've ever experienced.

479
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,580
To create better designer,
designer drugs,

480
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,300
engaged with our senses and make us
appreciate art and ways that we couldn't

481
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:53,630
have before to merge with our lovers
to become one with them. I mean,

482
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,540
we use language to connect and
say how we feel to one another.

483
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,010
That's one emerge all the time. What
do they want to, you want to do, man?

484
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:03,250
What he like? You want to go hang
out with your boy? It's gonna.

485
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,770
You can't want to go play pool,
but what if your boys want to merge?

486
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,810
The boys want to merge
with you and your wife.

487
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,730
You won't be playing pool though you
and wants to merge with your lunch.

488
00:26:12,731 --> 00:26:16,340
It's like, hey man, can I merge
with your wife? That's weird.

489
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,740
So I see what it's like to be heard.
They want to merge with your kids,

490
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,100
whatever they can copy and sexual
life. It's not sexual. No, no, no.

491
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:23,360
What do they want to merge with a dolphin?

492
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:25,430
Because they want to know what
it's like to be a Dyson. Timothy

493
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:30,050
leary settle the fuck down. Merging
with dolphins and people. Yeah.

494
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:31,350
What if right.
That's this guy.

495
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:36,230
We have to define like once
if we do create something
that allows like the human

496
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,750
consciousness to merge,
to interface with something,

497
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,810
we're going to have to like really define
what's happening there so people don't,

498
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:44,310
whether it's going to be Hershel interest,

499
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,430
I just don't see.
You can see like Nancy Grace on TV.

500
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:52,670
Who is this man that he's merging
with a 14 year old girl in Florida.

501
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,190
Three tickets.

502
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:01,190
You tell me that's appropriate
that this man is merged.

503
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,650
What does a grown man haven't calm and
with the thinking of a 14 year old girl,

504
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:13,730
she gets a little wetter every time
there's a dead baby in Florida.

505
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,690
Every time something happens
in Florida, she's like, Oh yes.

506
00:27:17,691 --> 00:27:22,430
More programming,
more material.

507
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,570
You know? I have to say the
fact that we see so much,

508
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,390
can't she find nice things?
Can Nancy grace please?

509
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,360
I'm not picking on you because
I have to them a comedian.

510
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:36,530
K You just find one nice story. Yeah.
Need, we need, we need more programming.

511
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:37,700
That's uplifting.
Yeah.

512
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,790
Isn't it nice to see stuff that
makes you feel good about humanity?

513
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,490
Good to have people go after bad people.
Don't get me wrong,

514
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,900
they're stopping the crime and
preventing getting along. But absolutely.

515
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:51,770
As far as like what we project our issue
is that there's 7 billion people on

516
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:54,590
this planet and if you only want
to pay attention to negative shit,

517
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,440
you can find enough to fill
every second of every day,

518
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,160
every second of every day of every
moment that you are on this planet.

519
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,610
It's someone's getting Jack.
Yes.

520
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,200
But I'm saying I think people are
reacting to that by creating more and more

521
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:09,450
really inspiring content.
And I think corporations now all,

522
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,480
I want it to align themselves with
having a sort of a positive impact on the

523
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:15,141
world.
You know,

524
00:28:15,141 --> 00:28:18,110
they're saying there's more to to a
corporation than just making money.

525
00:28:18,111 --> 00:28:21,770
How about wanting to make a social life,
but I think it is becoming part of it,

526
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,310
part of our consciousness.
Our increasingly like this
is what you're hearing.

527
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:28,760
I mean, you had Pepsi do that campaign
last year and they, they're, they're all,

528
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,570
they're realized. I, my
point was that, hold on,

529
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,720
but my point was that you have to manage
your own interaction with this kind of

530
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:40,490
information. My point was that if you
so choose, you can be around it all day,

531
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:43,520
every day or you can just not,

532
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,350
and you can force yourself into more
positive places and the options available

533
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,010
that both options are
available. Absolutely. You,

534
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:54,280
you have to be kind of careful and how
you manage your consciousness because you,

535
00:28:54,281 --> 00:28:58,190
you really can freak yourself the fuck
out if you only chose to concentrate on

536
00:28:58,191 --> 00:29:01,460
all the negative things in this world is
too much information. Totally. You know,

537
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:04,040
and, and you, you could
drown and information,

538
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:06,710
especially because the new
limited resources our attention.

539
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,750
But I think it's interesting.
There's a book about this,

540
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:13,220
it's called the information diet and it
says that it's really up to us to take

541
00:29:13,221 --> 00:29:17,690
responsibility over our information diet,
to set up curators,

542
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:20,930
to set up certain filters
to, to sort of, you know,

543
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:25,040
to have a significant say in
how we interface with media.

544
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,640
And we have that opportunity now that we
didn't have before when it was just two

545
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:33,560
channels, it was on or off. Now there's
a billion options. Curate author,

546
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,950
create an experience and information
diet that will keep you mentally

547
00:29:36,951 --> 00:29:37,850
invigorated.

548
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,980
Just like there's also food diet will keep
you a lot of experimenting on too. You

549
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,880
know, there's also a lot of people trying
different things out and focusing on

550
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:49,090
different things and there's a lot of
misses that seemed like they were hits.

551
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:51,570
Like you remember when everybody
was into the secret? Yeah.

552
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,120
You remember that and everybody was
convinced that all you have to do is think

553
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:57,730
positive and just draw a picture
of the house you want on your wall.

554
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,870
And one day it'll sort of manifest
itself in yes. Secret fans. Yes.

555
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,670
I'm just paraphrasing. Yeah. But
don't you think that an example,

556
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,730
like the way you said it is probably a
lot of people literalized the message

557
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:17,320
without really thinking about it a
little deeper and understanding how,

558
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:21,370
it might not sound like just bull here's,

559
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:25,660
but here's the problem with the
secret. Some of it's real. Okay.

560
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,860
There is a certain amount.

561
00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:29,360
It's one of the ingredients
and making something happen.

562
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,950
And one of the ingredients is vision.
It's 100% there's one of the ingredients,

563
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:36,280
and you talked to anybody that has
some sort of a great success and a good

564
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:37,270
percentage of them,

565
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:39,370
at least some of them are sorta
gotten their vision along the way,

566
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:42,320
but a good percentage of them had a
vision and followed it. Right. Push.

567
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:47,140
That is true. But there's so much
other shit involved. Education,

568
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:50,400
hard work, discipline.
It's not a set thing.

569
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,230
Cuing because it's like everything.
Everything out in the world. Everybody's,

570
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:54,521
you know,

571
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:58,690
the most magnificent artifact from the
iPhone to the jet engine is actualized

572
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,420
from a thought, from a dream, from
a design, which means to say, we,

573
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:05,460
we constructed the virtual version
before we constructed the actual virgin,

574
00:31:05,461 --> 00:31:09,370
right? That's the same thing as
visualizing something into being. But the,

575
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:13,000
into being part is when you say,
okay, I'm going to go execute on this.

576
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,360
I'm going to go like, you know, I'm
going to move through space and time,

577
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:20,050
move my atoms through space and time and
go construct the thing and go lobby to

578
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:23,350
build the thing, to build the
dream, to actualize the goal.

579
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,370
And I think maybe people who read the
read the book without reading as deeply

580
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:28,780
enough into it what they
thought it was like, okay,

581
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:31,060
I'm just going to sit on a couch and
dream something that's going to come

582
00:31:31,061 --> 00:31:31,930
knocking on my door.

583
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:35,080
So the problem is that they're dealing
with a bunch of people who have had

584
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:38,530
success and when people have
had success and you know,

585
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:41,260
they all tell you the same story,
Oh, I knew it was going to happen.

586
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:44,610
And I dreamed it. Well, but that's
because it happened. You know? I,

587
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,110
you know what I'm saying? There's a
lot of shit that comes along the way.

588
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,740
You could've gotten so
random car accident.

589
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,950
It could have got hit by a fucking media.
Absolutely.

590
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:55,100
I'm not exactly sure if 100% of your
success is based on the fact that you

591
00:31:55,101 --> 00:31:58,780
focused on your dream. Right. I think
it's a percentage of the sec success,

592
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,320
but there's a lot of luck involved
there too. Oh yeah, 100% Oh yeah.

593
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,400
There's a lot of,
there's a lot of luck involved in every,

594
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,610
I mean like the fact that each of us
is here, we beat out billions of sperm.

595
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,700
We've already are.
All of us are living against the odds.

596
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:17,310
Every respect for luck I think is one
of the reasons why people get lucky or

597
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,430
respect for luck. You know, you
gotta respect. Luck is, you know,

598
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,930
fortune good fortune is
unquestionably an ingredient.

599
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:30,990
There's an ingredient in there and I
feel like if Karma is real in any form,

600
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,890
I believe that's where the most evidence
of it being real is. That to me.

601
00:32:35,891 --> 00:32:38,920
Then the people that I know that are the
most fortunate or also the kindness are

602
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,033
the most generous.

603
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,850
Those are the people that are the most
fortunate because if one's a win for

604
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,450
themselves as well, which is
a very critical point with
a lot of people mess up.

605
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,800
They're super nice to other people,

606
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:52,250
but they treat themselves like shit
that to their body, like shared no good.

607
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:55,070
They don't go after their own goals.
They don't trace their own dreams.

608
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:57,740
They'll let people abuse them
because they're too nice. I mean,

609
00:32:57,741 --> 00:33:00,950
there's a lot of people that
are not nice to themselves.

610
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:03,880
You've got to be as nice to yourself
as you are to other people. I totally,

611
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:07,760
that is a huge part of the equation
that a lot of people miss out on.

612
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,940
They're like, I'm a good person. I'm nice
to people. Yeah, but you hate yourself.

613
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,710
You know, you hate your body. You
hate your mind, and you can do,

614
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:20,570
not everybody can do you. You can do
more for her, for the world, I think.

615
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:25,130
Um, by treating yourself with the same
kindness that you treat other people and,

616
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:28,490
uh,
once a sickness not to absolutely.

617
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,380
Food is fucking delicious, but you
shouldn't eat yourself to death, you know,

618
00:33:33,381 --> 00:33:35,630
I'm not saying you have to look
like Kate Moss in her prime.

619
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,900
Where'd I put out that reference from?
Where was that? But you know, you know,

620
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,840
you don't have to,
you know,

621
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,670
you don't have to fucking eat yourself
to death either. Right. You know, that's,

622
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,670
there's a lot of people that
eat themselves to death.

623
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,430
Like the human mind can go terribly wrong.

624
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,410
It can go on a horrible path and just
get stuck there. Just get stuck. Yeah.

625
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,770
Yeah. But the thing is, when we have
that problem with software, you know,

626
00:33:57,771 --> 00:34:00,890
software gets corrupted or if it gets
a bad virus in it, you know, we can,

627
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,810
we can upgrade and reboot the system
and we're not so lucky. Biology.

628
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,240
What if someone did something horrible
like a, there was a, you know,

629
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,150
a mall shooting or something
and some guy goes to the mall,

630
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:14,720
just shoots random people. Okay. Then you
reboot them. Would you allow that guy?

631
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,860
Do you think that's okay in a civilized
society? Do you think we have to reboot,

632
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,510
reboot him and that's a
great philosophical question
to ask. I mean that's,

633
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,040
that's a different case study.

634
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:29,030
I was doing blame society and allowing
him to get to a point where his software

635
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:32,630
failed him and how do we approach that
if we, if it's effective, if it's real,

636
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:36,350
do we blame the tissue that's left
after we remove his consciousness?

637
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,540
Do we blame that tissue and say,
I'm sorry,

638
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:43,340
this tissue has to die to make up for
the 16 people who knows? Maybe, maybe,

639
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:45,320
maybe there will be some form of light.

640
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:50,300
There will be an ethical dilemmas like
a virtual reality psychedelic experience

641
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:54,050
where you take him down the rabbit hole
and he has a Joseph Campbell's hero's

642
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:58,820
journey and he collides with his own
cosmic nakedness and then emerge is

643
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:02,570
rehabilitated. Maybe we'll have like,
sounds like it'll download rehabilitation.

644
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:06,050
Yeah. Electronic Iowasca use
that Ag. You tweet across that.

645
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:06,980
That would be a way to,

646
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,550
you should grab a criminal and he should
put him in an Iowasca session with a

647
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:14,540
shaman to stare into the nakedness
of his own soul. This is my new show.

648
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:17,990
My next show that I'm working on, nobody's
bought it yet, but I've got some hopes.

649
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,600
It's called Douche bags on
mushrooms and that's the show.

650
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:23,990
We chose the lunch bags throughout the
world and we just bring him somewhere and

651
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:27,050
dose up with like five grams a mushroom.
It was to let them see themselves.

652
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,250
I mean,
nobody's going to die.

653
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,810
I think psychedelic therapy is so spot on,

654
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:33,740
like in terms of the,

655
00:35:33,741 --> 00:35:37,890
the psychic read justments that can
happen in one session could take years

656
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,500
and given it to people. Yeah, giving it
to criminals as part of a rehabilitation,

657
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:46,340
if that would be very interesting to
explore. It just sounds very fast.

658
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:49,420
Not even just criminals, but people
that have issues like alcoholism.

659
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,191
That's obvious.

660
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,830
I mean they just came out with a study
just now that said that LSD could help

661
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:54,730
people get over Alco as in one session.
Yeah.

662
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,040
It doesn't have to say about the
Russian doing tests on this. In the 60s,

663
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:04,100
in the 1960s for they had determined that
500 micrograms was enough to cure like

664
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:08,430
more than 70% of chronic alcohol,
uh,

665
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,630
patients that came in and tried acid
just from like looking at the situation

666
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:16,560
just completely differently being
separated from the nonsense of what you're

667
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:20,970
engaged in. Yeah. We get stuck in these
weird patterns. It's very strange.

668
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,510
It's almost like a byproduct of our
ability to focus on things, right?

669
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,750
We have this ability to become intense
and obsessed and focused on things in a

670
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:28,584
positive sense.

671
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,380
But there's a byproduct of that
and that by side effects obsession,

672
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,040
it's a glitch. Yeah, it's a,
it's a possible, you know, it's,

673
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,220
it's like if somebody gives you a
fucking Ferrari but you don't know how to

674
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:40,800
drive a stick shift and you sort of
figure it out along the way and you're

675
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,380
jamming gears and fucking things up.

676
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,870
Sometimes it's working well and some
things you don't understand how to use the

677
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,000
system and they could be just that.

678
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,820
You know when you see a kid that becomes
obsessed with jerking off, you know,

679
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,350
get them into a sport, maybe become
a fucking world champion. You know,

680
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,300
maybe he's just one of those kids
that just whatever he focuses on,

681
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,220
he focuses on insanely,

682
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,920
it does a lot of kids out there and
I'm not saying you're wasting your life

683
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:04,170
playing video games because
video games are awesome. They've,

684
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,590
they didn't improve one's brain but
a bunch of studies about how gaming,

685
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,740
like coordination and cooperation.
But what I'm saying is that these kids,

686
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:12,990
any kid that gets really
good at a video game,

687
00:37:12,991 --> 00:37:15,960
you can get really good at anything.
You can get really good at it. If you,

688
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:19,470
if you put that kind of focus that you
put to get fucking awesome at call of

689
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,740
duty, you could really, you know, you
could have, you could have a better life.

690
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:26,580
You could imagine you getting tricky
unification on nurses where you can play

691
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:30,660
these games to address real
social challenges in these
gamers will probably find

692
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:35,040
solutions to problems that engineers
couldn't in the real world that this is

693
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:40,041
happening more and more now to use the
resources of gamers to gamify a real

694
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:44,100
world problem. How does that
work? Well, because the reality,

695
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,390
they'll create like some some interface
and some some problem and they're just

696
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:52,260
like a game and you get points for
solving issues related to the gamers

697
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:55,080
discovered like some antibody
for some crazy virus.

698
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,760
People can Google this for gamers.

699
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,900
Gamers solve some illness like crazy
stuff and you're going to be seeing that

700
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:01,950
more and more. In fact, they,

701
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,360
they did this crowd sourcing
crowd sourcing experiment
about a protein folding

702
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,170
and you know the world's best protein
folder is who can fold in design proteins

703
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:14,580
in the virtual space is like a woman who
does it in her free time in the UK and

704
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:17,670
during the day she was like a receptionist
or something and she is the world's

705
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:21,590
best protein folder. She used to do it
on her computer at night. Yeah, yeah,

706
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:25,290
cause you crowdsource that what clay
Shirky calls the cognitive surplus.

707
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:29,490
It's all this extra brain activity,
protein folding. What is she doing?

708
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,890
It's some kind of craft
source softwares thing.

709
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:33,990
They less people like fold
proteins and you know,

710
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:36,280
and you can figure out how
to do it in the virtual

711
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,780
space and then it can
be applied in real life.

712
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:41,280
And it turns out that the best one in the
world was this woman in the UK and all

713
00:38:41,281 --> 00:38:43,930
the scientists in the world. Yeah, yeah.
She's just a lady with a regular yeah,

714
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,490
yeah, yeah. And you're going
to find that more and more.

715
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:47,070
There's going to be some Gamer,

716
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,740
you know in Budapest who was going to
fix world hunger. You know like wow,

717
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,290
look at, look, look, look at like,
like hackers hacking community.

718
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:58,840
Like these little 13 year olds are
hacking fucking Microsoft. Yeah, exactly.

719
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,300
13 year old heck the UFC. Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're bad asses.

720
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,910
Did you hear about Lola Sec guy?

721
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,920
Is that how you call Lowe's turn?

722
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,850
He ratted out like all
these anonymous guys,

723
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:17,230
like 26 anonymous cause he just
grabbed it out everybody to the FBI.

724
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,280
Just just because like I guess the FBI
was playing dirty and it was like saying,

725
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:23,650
hey, we're going to arrest you for ever.
You never got to see your kids ever.

726
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,710
You know, and they, the FBI actually
admitted to it and I interviewed at that.

727
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,930
That's what they used their kids again.
So what are the, what were they guilty of?

728
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,260
Hacking, you know, digital terrorism
May, you know, and they were like,

729
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,530
they broke it into some serious websites.
Right.

730
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:42,880
That's like somebody said recently it was,
it's a higher form than terrorism.

731
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,320
Oh, that does cyber terrorism second
to higher than somebody's like, well,

732
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:49,540
I have a good friend,
this guy, Mark Goodman,

733
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:53,140
he's at singularity university over in
Silicon Valley where they look at how

734
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,680
these emerging technologies are, well
this, there's a singularity university.

735
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,910
Hell yeah, dude, you need
to go, man. I just did their
executive program here in La.

736
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:04,890
It was at Fox studios and it was hosted
by the head of Fox, the chairman James,

737
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,500
Jim Giannopoulos. And it was the
founder, Peter Diamandis and Kurzweil.

738
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,500
They have people from all over the world,
like the most interesting, smart people,

739
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:13,600
diplomats, actors, technologists,

740
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,960
business people to learn
about exponentially emerging
technologies and how they

741
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:19,420
can be addressed to solve humanity's
grand challenges. And you know,

742
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:20,231
like the homework there,

743
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:22,960
everybody that comes out has to come
up with an idea that can help a billion

744
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:23,830
people.
Cause the,

745
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,900
the notion is that technology and our
tools now allow individuals to knew what,

746
00:40:27,901 --> 00:40:30,610
what to do, what at one time
could only be done by governments,

747
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:33,730
you know what I'm saying? Or, or, or
people with extreme resources. But yeah,

748
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,100
singularity university had
an executive program and,

749
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,230
and they had talks about all
the amazing stuff going on,

750
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,710
but also this Guy Mark Goodman talked
about like cyber terrorism and new forms

751
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:44,810
of obviously synthetic biology
used in bad ways. And the,

752
00:40:44,811 --> 00:40:47,740
that it's a conversation that needs
to be had because human nature,

753
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,990
human beings have a good
ability to foresee problems.

754
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,510
And so we should start addressing those
problems before they become a serious

755
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:55,330
issue so that we can enjoy all the
fruits and benefits that are coming from

756
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:56,350
these emerging technologies.

757
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,940
But at the same time take responsibility
for obviously what is a double edged

758
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:00,880
sword as always,

759
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:05,620
or the aliens land first before
we'd get our shit together. Right.

760
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:08,710
Well and then we've got a problem.
Actually we should talk about aliens.

761
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:12,160
I have a fucking crazy idea to tell
you. Okay, Tom, ready for this?

762
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:16,300
You guys heard of the trends sension
hypothesis? No, I have not. Okay,

763
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,230
so I just found out about
this last night I knew was,

764
00:41:19,231 --> 00:41:22,240
it's a hypothesis by this
guy called John Smart.

765
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:27,170
He's an accelerating specialist futurist
over in Silicon Valley that tries

766
00:41:27,171 --> 00:41:31,120
sension hypothesis hypothesis
is an answer to Fermi's paradox,

767
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:34,910
which is if the universe is so vast and
there's all these other plan is to have

768
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:37,070
added so much more time to
develop intelligent life,

769
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,180
how can we don't see it everywhere, right?
Like that's Fermi's paradox I'm told.

770
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:45,770
And the trend hypothesis says that
if you look at what's happening with

771
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:48,980
technological progress as we head
towards the singularity is the

772
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:51,270
dematerialization and miniaturization of,

773
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:55,400
of complexity so that there's more energy
per second per gram going through a

774
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:57,350
microchip than there is
in the surface of the sun.

775
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,560
The most complex thing in the universe
that we know of right now is the human

776
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:03,950
being. So complexity gets more
complex but also gets denser.

777
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,450
So what they call stem, right?
And so what does stem again,

778
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,070
tell me what it stands for. Uh,
anyway, I'll remember. But anyway,

779
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,700
his brother. Yeah, no, no, no.

780
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,860
But what happens is he says that
eventually this exponentially growing

781
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:21,500
technology and when we start talking
about nanotechnology and putting

782
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:23,030
intelligence into the nanoscale,

783
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,820
that we're going to eventually create
an artificial black hole and disappear

784
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:28,670
into it and slingshot into the future
because there's going to be so much

785
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,060
density and so much complexity is so
much information that eventually is going

786
00:42:31,061 --> 00:42:33,920
to create a rupture through space time
and we're going to disappear into it.

787
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,100
So we're just going to do that
just by density of information.

788
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,950
Too many hard drives in
one spot at one time, yo,

789
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:44,360
because he says that the computation
event works by shrinking things and

790
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,990
complexity gets smaller and smaller and
smaller as the computer chips get faster

791
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:50,210
and faster and faster and more powerful.
And we look at the complexity that's an,

792
00:42:50,211 --> 00:42:53,060
an iPhone today is a million times
cheaper, a million times smaller,

793
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:56,030
thousand nine more powerful than half
a building in size was 40 years ago.

794
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,380
So in a hundred years,

795
00:42:57,381 --> 00:43:00,350
imagine the complexity that is going to
be in something smaller than an atom or

796
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:02,390
even scales beyond that.
So when our minds,

797
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:04,760
when intelligence is
residing on those scales,

798
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,360
basically they're saying that eventually
we're not going to colonize outer space.

799
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,800
We're going to go into the interspace,

800
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,340
we're going to go smaller and smaller
and smaller in density until we literally

801
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,310
create the ultimate universal computer,
which is a black hole.

802
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,660
Does everybody have to do this or can
we, can we opt out, compete people off?

803
00:43:20,661 --> 00:43:23,570
Raise the idea. I don't know if I
explained it very well. Sidelines.

804
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,170
I've been saying for years that I think
the people responsible for the big bang.

805
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,460
There you go. There you go. Well,

806
00:43:28,461 --> 00:43:31,310
the big bank could have been birthed
from a previous universe that eventually

807
00:43:31,311 --> 00:43:33,960
achieved the transection and disappeared
into a black hole. So recess.

808
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,290
I think that's why we're so
fascinated with technology.

809
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:39,590
We eventually hit a point where we figure
something out and we press a button

810
00:43:39,591 --> 00:43:41,180
and we disappear into a black hole,

811
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:43,550
which is worth as a big
bang in a new universe.

812
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,840
The whole idea of the big bang is really
fucking amazing because it's amazing

813
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:50,990
that science ever would come up
with a theory like the big bang.

814
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:54,800
It's almost like they had to have
a theory. So this was the best one.

815
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:57,050
The universe is constantly expanding.
There's um,

816
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,860
there's some radio waves from 14
billion years ago. We're detecting,

817
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:03,330
we believe that it was a big explosion.
Let's just run with this. Yeah.

818
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,820
And the idea that at one point in time,
14 whatever billion years ago,

819
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:11,900
the universe was so small, it was more
than the head of a pin. Everything.

820
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:15,530
Higher universe. That is
that is that, well that,

821
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:18,200
but that was going the other direction
and I just remembered what the stem

822
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:21,680
acronym stands for. It's space,
time, matter and energy. Space, time,

823
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:26,570
matter and energy. Shrink, stem.
Then space, time, energy and matter.

824
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:31,380
Oh, okay. My bad. Yeah. Spacetime energy
matter, man. Compressor compresses.

825
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:32,210
As technology

826
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,043
progresses,

827
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:37,320
so there's less space and less time and
the things are smaller and a and less

828
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:40,080
energy going through that
matter and also less matter.

829
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,740
So that's the move towards density.
It's like a reverse big bag.

830
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:46,650
Giving me a fucking headache. Yeah,
it's, it's, it's really ridiculous.

831
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:48,140
If I was correct,
I have,

832
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:50,100
I'm sure I'm not the only one who's
ever thought this up by the way.

833
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,960
I think when you look at,
you know,

834
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:54,830
look at nuclear bombs and need just
nuclear power in general, the fact that,

835
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,260
you know,

836
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:00,260
where we control most of our power and
major cities is controlled by these nutty

837
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:05,680
fucking nuclear explosions that they've
contained of exposures with it. Yeah.

838
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,850
Could reaction that they've contained
in the area. And if the power goes out,

839
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:11,160
like if it goes to Japan, everyone's
fucked. Do you have to run?

840
00:45:11,161 --> 00:45:14,100
Everybody said get away from that and
it's doom for a hundred thousand years.

841
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,480
This, that alone, just that
alone makes me think like, wow,

842
00:45:18,481 --> 00:45:23,070
like I know I don't have any
better options. No I don't,
but this is all you guys.

843
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,910
Got You guys. I mean in the 1960s and
seventies this is what you figured out.

844
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,690
You figured out how to make nuclear
power that if the power goes off it just

845
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:34,610
eats right through the earth and then
everyone's fucked anywhere near it. No,

846
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:38,370
but isn't it mind blowing?
What a mind,

847
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,590
what minds can do?
Like that's incredible.

848
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:45,120
I think of the scale that we are like
how small and dense a mind is a thinking

849
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:45,541
being.

850
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:49,440
The amount of synaptic connections inside
of something as small as the brain is

851
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:52,110
as many galaxies as there
are in the universe,

852
00:45:52,111 --> 00:45:55,710
like that amount of complexity in
something so small is what we are.

853
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,140
So it's like people say,
Oh, we're so insignificant.

854
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,230
I think we're like really significant.
You know what I mean?

855
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,210
Like we're the cutting edge of design.

856
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,790
We'll get to that has emerged from
the university. I agree and I don't.

857
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:07,450
At the same time I
said, yes, we were very,

858
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,980
we're very significant if it
comes to change on this earth,

859
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:15,150
but the earth is just so God
damn small and the big picture,

860
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,420
it's ridiculous to say that were
significant, were so fucking timing,

861
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:23,370
but just talk about the whole universe
and literally play back the evolution of

862
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:25,410
the universe in our heads.
A capacity,

863
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:29,370
a capacity to understand events
that have occurred over deep time,

864
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,340
not just plain it, right?
So we're creating internet,

865
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,820
we're creating models on
the scale of that universe.

866
00:46:35,821 --> 00:46:37,440
The universe that you're saying
is so much bigger than we are.

867
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,620
We're creating internal models
of it inside of our heads. True.

868
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,520
We're fitting the universe in our head
as far as brought virtual conversations

869
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:47,640
about it, or that's what's fucking
crazy, which means it fits in our heads.

870
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,700
That design fits in our heads.
If we understand it correctly,

871
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:52,770
the smartest people in the world,
Einstein among them,

872
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,540
could probably contemplate it in his head.
And you know,

873
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,300
people who take psychedelics say that
they experience the entire universe at

874
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:04,200
once. Maybe they do. Yeah. Maybe they
do. Maybe it's all inside a mushroom.

875
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,530
You could see the whole thing. You
just got to take enough home. Yeah.

876
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,860
Well cause the universe expands outwards.
But it goes inwards to you. This, this,

877
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:14,430
this scales get smaller. There's an
entire universe inside of us. 10 trillion,

878
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,740
trillion, trillion atoms.
And apparently the scales,

879
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,420
the scales go smaller in the most
Adams. It's just space. Like give her,

880
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,320
you know, when you look, you've already
told me about that the other night.

881
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,970
Most of,
most of everything is mostly empty space.

882
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,820
Most of us parents mostly up mostly empty
space, which is patterned integrity,

883
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,740
man pattern integrity's.

884
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:37,120
It's so insane to just even try to wrap
your head around how complex the whole

885
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:38,560
thing really, truly is. Right?

886
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:42,040
Which is why people like sticking to
neighborhoods and watching the same shows

887
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:42,581
they want.

888
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:47,581
Anything that calms down this bizarre
feeling of never ending complexity,

889
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:53,130
you know, that it's impossible
to understand or be in
control of your universe.

890
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,020
Well,
it's frightening to live in the mystery,

891
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:59,950
to live on the edge of knowledge,
to live on the edge of thought.

892
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,530
Well there's a reason we call it the
edge cause there it looks like there's a

893
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:06,820
ravine on the other end. But I still
think even though as individuals,

894
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,380
some of us find that frightening
and to each his own as a collective,

895
00:48:11,381 --> 00:48:15,220
I think mankind is always restless
and never afraid of the edge.

896
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,720
I think mankind always pushes at the edge
and that's what makes me ultimately so

897
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:20,950
optimistic about humanity.

898
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:24,910
We're still here and it's getting crazy
and look at the stuff that humanity is

899
00:48:24,911 --> 00:48:28,210
talking to itself about.
Yeah, about bombing Iran

900
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,940
to man. There's, it's going both ways.
I hit correcting global organisms,

901
00:48:35,941 --> 00:48:38,950
so maybe we're just self, we're
self correcting. I agree with you.

902
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:42,910
I don't grow share and your optimism
because I'm continually fascinated by the

903
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:45,880
stupidity of the human race as
well as the intelligence of it.

904
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,820
I think you can't ignore it.
I mean you cannot ignore that.

905
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,940
There's a lot of dummies out there,
unfortunately.

906
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:54,190
Totally a big percentage of the
world's a fucking mess right now.

907
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,350
And a lot of those people,
a big percentage,

908
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:59,530
but I just think that what is a mess gets
magnified and brought to our attention.

909
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:03,520
Well, it's more than 1%, right? More than
1% of the world's in mass, I would say.

910
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:07,180
When you say, when you think
about Iraq, Afghanistan,

911
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,890
what's going on in Syria,
which has happened in Libya,
what's going on in Egypt?

912
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,760
There's a lot of things about this
that are very exciting, right?

913
00:49:15,761 --> 00:49:18,580
I mean what happened in Libya and
Indonesia, no, don't get me wrong,

914
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:22,210
but I'm saying you're saying it's a mess.
There's a at one commission, right? Yeah.

915
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:22,410
We're,

916
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:25,690
we looked at more than 1% and you've got
a hundred people in a room and one of

917
00:49:25,691 --> 00:49:29,860
them is fucking crazy. I think
we live in disruptive times. Yes.

918
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,150
Fueled by these accelerating technologies.
But I think disruption,

919
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:38,120
it's like going through the birth
canal. It's like, it's like, you know,

920
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,590
when Timothy Leary, it says that we're
about to like, you know, shed our skin.

921
00:49:41,591 --> 00:49:45,790
You know, we're in the larval stage.
We were pre larval of men were larval,

922
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:50,200
and then we're just, we're about to
spread our wings potentially. Potentially.

923
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,870
That's where this conversation comes in.
If some new age,

924
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:56,520
Hitler doesn't step into the
equation. Fair enough. But damn it.

925
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,560
But a good conversation to
have. Yes. Oh yeah, of course.

926
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,260
It's amazing when you really
look back at World War II,

927
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:04,490
that it was such a short amount
of time ago. It's terrifying.

928
00:50:04,491 --> 00:50:06,670
It's hard to wrap your head
around that. I'm Jewish. I know.

929
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:11,710
It's w did you have family? That was
my family fled from Europe. Yeah,

930
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:15,640
my mother's side Polish and Russian.
Yeah. Um, there was a Venezuela,

931
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:20,060
Ari interviewed a bunch of, wasn't as dad
and, well, I don't want to say, let's see.

932
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:23,470
But yeah, it's, it's incredible
that that's inside. That could,

933
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,230
that could be your grandparents. That
could be our lifetime. That's within our,

934
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,510
within our grasp

935
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:31,490
right now. While you know this
chain of life is going on,

936
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,790
the Holocaust was happening,
World War II was happening.

937
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:36,830
I mean the storming the
beaches of Normandy,

938
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:39,770
that's like the most savage
shit in human history. You know,

939
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:43,190
cutting people down with machine guns
as they run through the sand. I mean,

940
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:48,050
that is, that's our lifetime man. It's
amazing. Some really truly amazing.

941
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:50,450
When you stop and think about
how crazy that seems. Yeah,

942
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:50,981
yeah.

943
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:55,150
There was a really interesting article
that I read because obviously everything

944
00:50:55,151 --> 00:50:58,960
you're saying is very upsetting. It was
informed policy, man. Just stop talking,

945
00:50:58,961 --> 00:51:03,010
dude. It's cool. No, I'm
saying no, no, no, no, no, no.

946
00:51:03,011 --> 00:51:06,520
But there was an article in foreign policy
magazine, it was called V end of war,

947
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,300
and it was one of those counterintuitive
articles that you read it and you're

948
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:13,420
like, okay, there's these interesting
academics that are saying, yes,

949
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,480
this was tragedy. Yes, there've been
horrible things. Yes, these numbers,

950
00:51:16,481 --> 00:51:20,980
these scales are horrific,
but put it in context over deeper,

951
00:51:20,981 --> 00:51:25,210
longer time, and what you see is
that things are getting better,

952
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,290
less wars happening. Just before
we couldn't cover every war on TV.

953
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:31,150
There were too many
conflicts zones in the world,

954
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,980
but he talks about how
there's less and less.

955
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,420
It's just it's important to get the
other side that we don't forget that

956
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:41,090
I'm sure that it's better now
than it has been ever, but as a,

957
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:44,440
I think human beings as just naturally,

958
00:51:44,441 --> 00:51:48,400
we look at the errors and the issues that
we have and we see a lot of them that

959
00:51:48,401 --> 00:51:51,820
are sort of legacy that aren't there or
aren't corrected and they'd been going

960
00:51:51,821 --> 00:51:55,120
on for so long. Like war. Yeah. I
remember when I was a kid I was,

961
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,600
I dunno maybe like I think it was
like eight or something like that.

962
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,110
When the government pulled out of Vietnam
and the Vietnam War was over and I

963
00:52:02,111 --> 00:52:05,220
remember thinking like,
it's good. It's done.

964
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:09,280
We're done having wars because now
people realize that we don't like war.

965
00:52:09,281 --> 00:52:10,450
No one's going to go to war anymore.

966
00:52:10,451 --> 00:52:14,770
Look what I remember as even as a child
with the idea in my head that I was

967
00:52:14,771 --> 00:52:18,190
watching the culture evolved past war.
I had like a real sense,

968
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,280
especially I think when you're a child
because as you're growing and you're kind

969
00:52:21,281 --> 00:52:24,880
of experiencing life and it's being
sort of explained to you along the way

970
00:52:24,881 --> 00:52:26,690
through experiences that you,

971
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:29,680
you start getting an idea that
that's how the whole world works.

972
00:52:29,681 --> 00:52:33,400
That things just get better over time.
Things get smarter, they improve.

973
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:35,110
Cause that's what you're doing.
You're eight years old,

974
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:37,420
you're smarter than you were when you were
five. Right. You know what I'm saying?

975
00:52:37,421 --> 00:52:39,910
I may not have a significant leap over,
you know who you are when you're,

976
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,140
so I think that's how I viewed the world
and our member in whatever year it was,

977
00:52:44,141 --> 00:52:48,910
91 or 92 when we, uh, when we went
to Desert Storm, what year was that?

978
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:53,770
91, right? Ma, maybe whatever.
Remember might even been 89,
but whatever year it was.

979
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:56,700
I remember watching that happen.
I remember me and my,

980
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,380
my buddy Jimmy that I used
to live with my roommate Jim,

981
00:52:59,381 --> 00:53:00,830
to tell yo what's up to him.
Uh,

982
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:06,060
we were sitting in front of the TV and
they were showing missiles like firing

983
00:53:06,371 --> 00:53:10,720
over into Baghdad. And I remember
watching that call, what the fuck?

984
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,500
And he looks at me and he goes, we're
a war buddy. We're at war. Like, well,

985
00:53:14,501 --> 00:53:16,120
that didn't even make sense.

986
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:16,361
Well,

987
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:19,780
because it seems obsolete compared to all
the great things that are happening in

988
00:53:19,781 --> 00:53:23,080
the world. Right. The massive
collaboration, the massive
cooperation, you know,

989
00:53:23,081 --> 00:53:25,980
people doing things increasingly
for free for one another. Online

990
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,530
people coming together,
people protesting against dictatorships,

991
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,920
Twitter being used as fueled for
dissent and discontent. I mean,

992
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,940
there's so many encouraging trends.
Yeah.

993
00:53:33,941 --> 00:53:36,870
Whenever use kind of contemplate the
fact that there's still bad things out

994
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:38,130
there.
You really well you want,

995
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,100
the contrast also makes you realize
why there's aspects of us that are so

996
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:45,540
obsolete. We need a firmware
upgrade, but we're fucking,

997
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,540
we're getting there. You're there to
universities. What you need to go, man,

998
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:51,480
I'm sure they loved that. You need to
go. Yeah, we had, we actually will. I am.

999
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:54,180
Was there really? Yeah. And Him
and he did a talk in a panel.

1000
00:53:54,181 --> 00:53:56,790
We had this company that does a, wait
a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1001
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,730
We'll I am, gets to talk at the
singular singularity university.

1002
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:02,190
Haman the head of Fox. What does
he's talking about the head. Well,

1003
00:54:02,191 --> 00:54:05,520
because he was talking about using these
technologies and her bitches on the

1004
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,610
creative and good uses of
these technologies and how
we need to spread these

1005
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:12,420
technologies to those that are less,
uh, less lucky than we are and whatnot.

1006
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,010
I'm sure he was talking about nice things.
So I just,

1007
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:15,750
I was at your jokes and we saw it too.

1008
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:20,420
Paralyzed people walk this bionics
company who makes these like exoskeleton

1009
00:54:20,421 --> 00:54:24,570
scene though demonstrated to paralyzed
people standing up and walking. I mean,

1010
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:28,020
it was, it was really intense. I've
seen that very much. So skeleton,

1011
00:54:28,021 --> 00:54:31,230
it's fucking nuts. Again,
it's like something right
out of a marvel comics man.

1012
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:31,711
Hopefully.
Right?

1013
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:34,020
It looks like a trailer for a movie
that takes place in the future.

1014
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:37,650
That's showing you how we got there.
Archival footage from the future.

1015
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,290
It just totally makes sense, right?
I mean it's, it's the future.

1016
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,840
They're going to figure out, well, they're
going to figure out artificial bodies.

1017
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:44,400
Absolute for sure.

1018
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:47,280
They're going to be able to put your
head on someone else's body. Dude,

1019
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,020
on an artificial avatars,
what?

1020
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:52,020
Isn't there a wired magazine story about
the man who wants to build the real

1021
00:54:52,021 --> 00:54:52,530
avatar?

1022
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,830
Could you imagine if they get so good
at surgery that they build an artificial

1023
00:54:55,831 --> 00:54:59,730
you and the the head is open and they
just have to sew it up and stuff.

1024
00:54:59,731 --> 00:55:00,291
Your brain in there,

1025
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:02,460
but they only have like a certain amount
of time where they could take your

1026
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:07,160
brain then reattach it. They open your the
good eye. Good Eye, Mr. Jones. Boom. Oh,

1027
00:55:07,161 --> 00:55:10,080
cut up. Next thing I see you're going
to be 20 years old and invincible.

1028
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,910
They cut open your fucking brain,

1029
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:14,850
suck it out real quick and they only
have a couple minutes and then they screw

1030
00:55:14,851 --> 00:55:18,210
it into this new brain. What it
turn it on? Fire Up is to Jones.

1031
00:55:18,211 --> 00:55:22,740
You hear as Mr. Jones 37 seconds. We're
good. We're good. You got a new life.

1032
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:28,420
Mr. Jones made the trip into a synthetic
body with his biological brain? Well,

1033
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,600
I think by the time that we can do that,

1034
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,800
we will be non biological in the sense
that we'll have far greater than human

1035
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:39,801
intelligence and sentients residing in
decentralized non biological substrates.

1036
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,480
Do you feel like that about the
Nano scale? Do you feel like that?

1037
00:55:42,481 --> 00:55:44,340
I've never felt like we're
going to go to other planets.

1038
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:46,560
I feel we definitely are.
We're definitely are.

1039
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:49,050
We're going to go to Mars and less
than 10 years. And what did he like?

1040
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:54,120
Elon Musk and his one which was saying,
let me in office. You hear that?

1041
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:56,460
Yes. New Greenridge said
if you let me an office,

1042
00:55:56,461 --> 00:55:58,290
but a second term we'll have
a base on the moon. Well,

1043
00:55:58,291 --> 00:55:59,670
we don't need governments for that.
See,

1044
00:55:59,671 --> 00:56:01,530
that's the difference of where we are now.

1045
00:56:01,531 --> 00:56:03,450
It's going to happen by
private space flight.

1046
00:56:03,451 --> 00:56:07,080
It's going to be the techno
philanthropists like Elon
Musk who have the vision

1047
00:56:07,081 --> 00:56:10,500
and the resources to make it happen
and they benefit from the emerging

1048
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:14,550
technologies because something that was
that the cost was impossible 20 years

1049
00:56:14,551 --> 00:56:17,860
ago. All of a sudden he
gives me to miniaturize is
infinitely more affordable. Uh,

1050
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,101
we're,

1051
00:56:18,101 --> 00:56:21,990
we're going to space and then we're
going to send artists into space and that

1052
00:56:21,991 --> 00:56:24,130
will transform the human.
Can we have to decide like

1053
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,980
who the artists are cause last thing you
want is shitty poetry from outer space.

1054
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,080
Well imagine you. It's got to be like
really analyzing it philosophically.

1055
00:56:31,081 --> 00:56:34,710
A podcast from space. How that would
influence your thoughts, your ideas.

1056
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,360
How about we just get a green screen,

1057
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:39,620
it puts some space behind me and maybe
that will work and we'll pretend to be

1058
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:44,350
the same NASA suits. Do you have any NASA
soup, Brian? Yep. Minds in the trunk.

1059
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:47,720
Yeah, I know. I don't know man.

1060
00:56:47,721 --> 00:56:51,080
I don't know what the future holds but
I think the big bang machine may come

1061
00:56:51,081 --> 00:56:54,050
before space travel. I mean I'm
just guessing the big bang machine,

1062
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,340
they might press the big bank button
before we figure out how to get to other

1063
00:56:58,341 --> 00:56:59,174
planets.
And I hope

1064
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,790
all man, we have to at least
figure out how to back ourselves.

1065
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,100
What if you fucking fly out to bars?

1066
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:07,330
But if you fly out tomorrow's and it's
just like the shittiest parts of Arizona,

1067
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,030
it's just like the shittiest parts of
the Arizona desert and you're like,

1068
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:12,220
you know what?
The spots like this that suck on America,

1069
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,840
I could have just driven there.

1070
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:18,970
I didn't have to fucking fly in a rocket
ship to some place with no air to see a

1071
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:20,470
shitty part of the,

1072
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:25,240
of the universe that I could've seen an
Arizona rock desert areas where there's

1073
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:30,640
no one
for 100,000 fucking square miles.

1074
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,440
Yeah, Dude, fair enough.

1075
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:38,470
And I think that those that go are not
going to swim on Mars has beautiful

1076
00:57:38,601 --> 00:57:39,260
beaches.

1077
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:43,910
I think they're going for the feeling
that they will have when they look out

1078
00:57:43,911 --> 00:57:47,300
that window and see
another celestial body.

1079
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:50,060
They're going there for the wanderlust,
the awe.

1080
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,790
They're going there for the all that.

1081
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:56,200
That's their religious feeling
getting off on God. Anybody that does

1082
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:57,520
that who really,

1083
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:02,440
if they'd really do choose to give up
essentially years and years of their lives

1084
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:05,350
to for the scientific adventure,
I mean that's what they're doing.

1085
00:58:05,351 --> 00:58:08,440
What's going to take like six months to
just to get to Mars. That's a real hero.

1086
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:10,640
And there's going to be a lot of
one way tickets, like you're saying,

1087
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,150
that's a real hero. And
who knows, by the way,

1088
00:58:13,151 --> 00:58:17,020
what the fuck happens to your body out
there and radiation and deep space,

1089
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:20,440
how unhealthy it is to be in the
atmosphere and, and you know,

1090
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:22,780
and then what are they going
to do? They're going to
have to do some sort of, uh,

1091
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,310
what, what is it called when you change
the atmosphere of a new planet, uh,

1092
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,680
with terraform? Terraform. Oh
yeah. They'd have to tear a form.

1093
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:33,700
So they would have to build machines
that actually create oxygen and yeah.

1094
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:35,130
And then hope it stays stable,

1095
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:35,951
although,

1096
00:58:35,951 --> 00:58:38,770
but you want to go a little crazier
man a little farther into the future.

1097
00:58:38,771 --> 00:58:42,760
That will all be done with nanotechnology.
The physicist Freeman Dyson says,

1098
00:58:42,761 --> 00:58:46,000
we'll be able to have the entire biosphere
of the world decoded the genome of

1099
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:47,080
the entire biosphere,

1100
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:50,680
of everything that's living on planet
earth and something that's a few micro

1101
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:52,660
grams in weight and at the Nano scale.

1102
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:56,830
And we'll be able to
send those nanotechnology
instructions to self replicate

1103
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,400
and seed the universe and a whole rant
about it because she's a physicist

1104
00:59:00,401 --> 00:59:03,320
talking about this. Like this is a
thing. It's not like some like, you know,

1105
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,430
hippie tripping. This is a
physicist who's, you know,

1106
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:07,990
at one time was probably
a hippie tripping.

1107
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:13,320
It makes sense when you think about
how small data holding, you know,

1108
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:16,550
little little, little hard drives now
and what they're going to be liked.

1109
00:59:16,551 --> 00:59:20,060
I mean they've, they've got computers
that are as small as a grain of sand now.

1110
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,040
Oh Dude.
Quantum is going to be

1111
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,630
doing super position, which means like
being one in zero at the same time. Yeah.

1112
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:30,890
What does that, what is that exactly?
Does anybody, do you understand it? Uh,

1113
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:35,300
I'm no expert but super position means
that can be in motion and still at the

1114
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:38,720
same time it's just a novice. Yes.
Yeah. Two different places at once.

1115
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:43,580
Something could be a particle and a
wave at the same time. And so it can,

1116
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:48,581
something can be at the same time in
two different points in the universe and

1117
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:52,220
simultaneously and communicate,
and this is not horse shit, right?

1118
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,230
This is all of this stuff.

1119
00:59:53,231 --> 00:59:57,900
This is all proven stuff at least accepted
in the quantum physics communities.

1120
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:03,110
Doesn't that make you want to toss all
previous notions about reality aside?

1121
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,480
When you look at something like that and
you go, wait a minute, wait a minute,

1122
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:10,040
wait a minute. The very foundation of
everything that we see, touch, feel,

1123
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:12,920
observe,
no exists is illusory.

1124
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:18,770
It's a goddamn program. Yeah
Dude. It's the fucking matrix.
Yeah. There's my friend.

1125
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:21,470
Rarely. Rarely is real.
Matrix didn't go far enough.

1126
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,640
The Matrix didn't go far enough.

1127
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,390
It was so brilliant and that's why
inception was similarly on those same,

1128
01:00:26,391 --> 01:00:28,130
the same.
There's a make a friend has a shirt,

1129
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,620
it has these two guys sitting
in a chair and one of them says,

1130
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:34,580
are we just graphics on an imaginary
tee shirt? And the other guy says,

1131
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:38,870
that's ludicrous. But you could extend
that and extrapolate that to us.

1132
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,160
Or we just like two dudes and some
virtual simulation that somebody else is

1133
01:00:43,161 --> 01:00:45,830
playing with and then you're like,
Nah,

1134
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:49,220
and then it zooms out and it shows like
that were playing on some screen for

1135
01:00:49,221 --> 01:00:51,800
someone else's energy.
The game was really good,

1136
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:53,960
which is what's happening right now.
When you,

1137
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,490
when you're playing like a really
good game of quake, you know?

1138
01:00:56,490 --> 01:01:00,200
You know when you're in the zone you're
not thinking, Hey, I'm playing quake.

1139
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:04,220
Oh no, he's real. You're locked.
Hopping and moving. You're a part of it.

1140
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:06,560
We can be in multiple realities,
dude. There's no doubt.

1141
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:10,040
We're already doing it with flat screens
that are not even that immersive and we

1142
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:14,930
can lose ourselves in. It is artificial.
It could be just so good it feels.

1143
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,970
Yeah,
which makes sense for a lot of shit.

1144
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:21,800
I said so many times that the world feels
like a piece of fiction that the word

1145
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:25,430
they, the reality when a guy like,
you know what? When I yelled,

1146
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:30,220
shut the fuck up at the TV when that
Anthony Wiener guy got caught taking

1147
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:34,370
pictures of his deck, I'm like, come on
man. This is shitty writings. Shitty,

1148
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:37,730
right Sitcom. I'd get mad. Well,
you know that's a movie. Yeah.

1149
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:42,350
Movie about a guy that's criticizing the
screenplay of life starring you would

1150
01:01:42,351 --> 01:01:43,870
be really fun. It was. It wasn't,

1151
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:49,000
it wasn't that I was criticizing it was
that it was like Coen brothers ass. Yeah.

1152
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,820
It was so preposterous that it seemed
like all of a sudden we're in a movie.

1153
01:01:52,821 --> 01:01:55,850
Come on, dude. But the six
pictures of his cock to,

1154
01:01:55,851 --> 01:02:00,080
they're just lose the money and clues are
everywhere, man. Row, row, row your boat.

1155
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,470
What does that mean? Well, the last
line of row, row, row your boat,

1156
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,840
it says life is but a
dream, but a dream. Yeah.

1157
01:02:05,841 --> 01:02:09,380
But they're early in their life is but
a dream. They'd probably had a write,

1158
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:12,320
make something wrong.
Not The pursuit of a dream.

1159
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:16,400
Life is not the pursuit of a dream. And
there there's clues everywhere, man. Yeah.

1160
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:19,030
Or someone could have been really
high when they wrote that. Yeah. It,

1161
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,040
Jesus wrote that

1162
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,460
song. Yeah. I've written a lot of shit
high that I embarrassed about. Yeah.

1163
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:28,860
Like your one joke. Yeah, it's true. I
really did write that. That's funny. Um,

1164
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:33,330
so what, what do we do
to, to sort of, I mean,

1165
01:02:33,331 --> 01:02:36,240
I guess what we're doing is what you're
doing right now, what we're doing,

1166
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:39,790
what we can do as in worked
creating memes. Yeah. And we,

1167
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,510
what we can do is retweet things
that resonate with, absolutely.

1168
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:44,600
Talk about things that you,

1169
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:49,470
every time you retweet something
600,000 mines are potentially, yeah,

1170
01:02:49,471 --> 01:02:52,830
potentially potentially. Fair enough.
But 600,000 is a very big number. She,

1171
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:57,870
so even if only 10 if the tweet that you
sent out triggers a butterfly effect in

1172
01:02:58,711 --> 01:02:59,341
his thought,

1173
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:04,200
that opens up a whole new stream of
possibilities for that person that will,

1174
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:05,700
that's real transformation.

1175
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:10,380
So it's natural selection playing out at
a faster and faster rate because things

1176
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:10,770
are happening.

1177
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:14,160
So you're creating artful change in
the world using the power of your mind.

1178
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,290
Somebody listening to this might
invent, might invent, you know,

1179
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:21,060
some new poem that becomes the
campaign for some brand that, you know,

1180
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:24,960
transforming the world. Like I said, the
butterfly effect, but we're talking to,

1181
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:26,940
it's on scales and numbers
where that's possible.

1182
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:31,080
I've seen the engaged inspired
audience, you know, interface with you.

1183
01:03:31,081 --> 01:03:31,741
Like I've seen it.

1184
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:34,530
So it's like it's kind of what
they're responding to you too man.

1185
01:03:34,531 --> 01:03:37,340
They're responded to your ideas and you're
passionate about it. And W you know,

1186
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:41,310
one of the cool things about having a
podcast is someone right now could be

1187
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:44,670
anywhere, you know, doing some, some
tedious work around the house or whatever.

1188
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:45,090
Right?

1189
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:50,090
And they were in a certain state of mind
and the conversation that you brought

1190
01:03:50,131 --> 01:03:52,890
up and the way we've
explored these topics,

1191
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:56,490
all of a sudden their mind is fucking
racing, you know? And that is,

1192
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,220
that is a real cool thing.

1193
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,130
That is a really cool thing that
we can do something like that.

1194
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,340
That that to me is one of the
most satisfying aspects of this.

1195
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:09,330
That you can entertain someone and
engage them and literally put them on a

1196
01:04:09,331 --> 01:04:12,090
little bit of a mental journey where
they start to hold Hodor looking about

1197
01:04:12,091 --> 01:04:13,620
these different subjects.
Yeah, absolutely.

1198
01:04:13,621 --> 01:04:16,920
Nano technology and you start exploring
it and seeing how bizarre it is.

1199
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:20,050
Some of the references that you use,
you go and look them up and holy fuck.

1200
01:04:20,051 --> 01:04:24,680
So many people ask for book
recommendations after our
session. So many, yeah,

1201
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:28,830
I've got to eventually like make like a
thing on my website to my favorite books.

1202
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:32,640
Favorite documentary. So there's, there's
documentary thread on the message board,

1203
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:33,923
but you know,

1204
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:38,380
I'm such a big fan of Joseph Campbell
and the sort of mine as well,

1205
01:04:38,381 --> 01:04:42,810
the hero's journey. See, think of the
hero's journey. We think so literally.

1206
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:44,940
So we're like obviously
a geographical journey.

1207
01:04:44,941 --> 01:04:47,640
Like if you go on a safari and
then you climb Kilimanjaro,

1208
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:50,460
you will go through all the steps,
a departure from the ordinary,

1209
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:53,910
overcoming obstacles, having a catharsis
and realization and making the return.

1210
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:57,210
But we need to apply
that metaphor internally.

1211
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:02,480
This podcast session is a Joseph Campbell
Hero's journey person puts on the

1212
01:05:02,761 --> 01:05:06,250
headphones and it's dosed the prints
and who's the princess? No, no.

1213
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:09,810
We don't mean on a hero's journey. No,
but think this is the hero's journey.

1214
01:05:09,811 --> 01:05:12,120
It follows the steps.
It's a departure from the ordinary.

1215
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:15,720
We're partaking in conversations that
are maybe not your everyday conversations

1216
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,130
work,
overcoming obstacles,

1217
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,680
the sense that we're
challenging preconceived truths
and questioning ourselves

1218
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:23,410
and asking difficult questions
and thinking new thoughts.

1219
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:26,770
So that's what the obstacles and then
we're transcending and overcoming the

1220
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:29,590
resistance that we have to change
and to new ways of thinking.

1221
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,300
And then we're having
hopefully the catharsis,

1222
01:05:31,301 --> 01:05:32,770
hopefully sometime during this journey,

1223
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:35,890
we have a moment of profound realization
that changes us both and somebody

1224
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:39,550
listening to forever. And then we make
the return, which is to say, I love that.

1225
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:41,560
I want to share that with my community.
I'm going to tweet it,

1226
01:05:41,561 --> 01:05:44,350
I'm going to Facebook it. So if you apply
that metaphor of the hero's journey,

1227
01:05:44,351 --> 01:05:47,220
you try to make parts of your
life significant hero's journey.

1228
01:05:47,221 --> 01:05:48,190
I'll wake up in the
morning and we'd be like,

1229
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:49,900
today I'm going to
depart from the ordinary.

1230
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:51,580
I'm gonna put myself in
uncomfortable situations.

1231
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:54,350
I'm going to transcend those boundaries.
I'm going to have a new realization.

1232
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:56,310
I want this day to mean something
and then make the return.

1233
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:57,160
Right?
Come on.

1234
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,990
What if that day you got to like a
bunch of shit you need to get done.

1235
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,070
You listen to this podcast.

1236
01:06:01,071 --> 01:06:03,550
I don't want it to happen because it
didn't happen in your brain to write.

1237
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,370
I'm going to read this book
tonight, I'm going to, you know,

1238
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:08,360
check out this interesting documentary.
It is definitely an hour a day.

1239
01:06:08,361 --> 01:06:10,100
Is it expose yourself to different things.

1240
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:12,740
That's why I really get
into finding big foot.

1241
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,340
I've been watching that a lot lately.
Brian,

1242
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:19,870
probably it's one of the things I have
and why it's just a waste of time for me.

1243
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,490
Fuck yeah, that's wasted time. But
I'm trying to write to new material.

1244
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:24,950
My doing my special, by
the way, it's confirmed,

1245
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:29,030
it's going to be happening Atlanta on
April 20th at the Tabernacle Theater and

1246
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,580
um, most of the tickets are
sold out for the first show,

1247
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,240
but we're going to do a second show. So
we're, we'll have the, the first year,

1248
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:36,200
I think it's an eight,
the second show be 10 30.

1249
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:40,310
And the second show tickets will
go on sale sometime this week.

1250
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:45,050
Probably today's Monday sometime. Probably
Wednesday I would guess. And, uh, uh,

1251
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:49,190

really good to call it.

1254
01:06:56,270 --> 01:06:58,070
So you got to call it
looky [inaudible] style.

1255
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:03,320
And you're going to be in New York

1259
01:07:17,551 --> 01:07:19,470
man, I'm heading up to, or this
week at the end of this week,

1260
01:07:19,471 --> 01:07:22,380
I'm heading up to the bay
area because on the 20th,

1261
01:07:22,381 --> 01:07:26,510
I'm speaking at Stanford Design School
and showing some of my crazy ecstatic

1262
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:31,320
videos. Oh Wow. And then
on the 27th of March, 27th,

1263
01:07:31,321 --> 01:07:32,340
I'm speaking at Google,

1264
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:34,240
I was invited.
Oh yeah.

1265
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:35,410
Show us some of the videos.

1266
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:39,820
And then on March 28th I'm going to be
speaking at the economist Ideas Festival

1267
01:07:39,821 --> 01:07:43,780
on innovation at Berkeley is going to be
sick all, all about showing the videos.

1268
01:07:43,781 --> 01:07:45,520
It's about talking about inspiration,
creativity,

1269
01:07:45,521 --> 01:07:47,140
new ways of packaging
and disseminating ideas.

1270
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:51,550
Then I go to New York and on March 30th
I'm speaking at the PSFK conference in

1271
01:07:51,551 --> 01:07:52,840
Battery Park and then

1272
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:55,730
said, I'm making people memorize
this stuff cause most of them won't.

1273
01:07:55,731 --> 01:07:58,640
What does your website, where's
there? This all uh, oh yeah.

1274
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:03,200
Well in some of a.com if you go to this
as Jason silva.com this is Jason Silva

1275
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:05,330
Daca. Yes. But the best
thing honestly is Twitter,

1276
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:09,860
Twitter at Jason Underscore Silva,
s Lva. And if you can't find it,

1277
01:08:09,861 --> 01:08:11,130
it's on mine.
Uh,

1278
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:14,750
talking about this podcast and that way
I keep people updated in all the talks

1279
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:15,980
and April 20th,

1280
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:18,890
the National Arts Club in New York
City and he's speaking as well.

1281
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:21,980
This is amazing when this was all because
of your videos and you punished for

1282
01:08:21,981 --> 01:08:25,880
the Internet, which are really amazing.
And if you Google Jason Silva, Vimeo,

1283
01:08:25,881 --> 01:08:30,350
there's a whole page with a gang of
amount of Vimeo is a nice high quality

1284
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:34,010
visual too. I love Vimeo, man. They're
amazing. It's very high quality.

1285
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:36,560
Like when you can go full screen with
it on a large screen, which is great.

1286
01:08:36,561 --> 01:08:36,991
They get it.

1287
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:40,220
And the design it's made for like artists
and this beautiful Vimeo is awesome.

1288
01:08:40,221 --> 01:08:43,500
We put all of our podcasts up
on Vimeo and we also put a, a,

1289
01:08:43,501 --> 01:08:47,780
a video blog up and put that on video
Vimeo as well. Um, but yeah, um,

1290
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:50,630
I think, uh, that's incredible
man that you've given all this.

1291
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,030
It's worked just from those
videos popping up on the Internet.

1292
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,800
How did you get started in this man?
What'd you,

1293
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:57,730
what is your background as far as
like education and Shit, man? Well,

1294
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:59,930
I grew up in Venezuela and I went to,

1295
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:02,510
we talked to him about international
school and of course factor of it as well.

1296
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:04,370
I was in film school and I did current TV,

1297
01:09:04,371 --> 01:09:07,070
which was Al Gore's TV channel
like the last five years.

1298
01:09:07,071 --> 01:09:10,140
But it was really when I left last year
that I wanted to do my own content.

1299
01:09:10,141 --> 01:09:13,220
Do you ever get massages with al?
No. We did go to a hotel. No, no.

1300
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:17,710
Really banking did now get some
massage problems. I don't know. But um,

1301
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,670
yeah,
the short videos were just,

1302
01:09:19,671 --> 01:09:24,110
I wanted to like apply in principle
what I was believing in intellectually,

1303
01:09:24,111 --> 01:09:24,620
like I want it to,

1304
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:28,280
to make content that was mimetic because
I believe we live in a world where a

1305
01:09:28,281 --> 01:09:31,250
short form content disseminated through
the Internet can effect, people,

1306
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:36,200
can transform minds. We don't need the
sort of the old gatekeepers, so to speak.

1307
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:36,981
Everybody's empowered.

1308
01:09:36,981 --> 01:09:40,130
And so the reason short videos are easier
to consume through small devices and

1309
01:09:40,131 --> 01:09:43,280
this and that. And you don't ask people
for too much of their time, you know,

1310
01:09:43,281 --> 01:09:47,690
a c that's a big thing. Well, until you've
won them over, like you and then people,

1311
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:49,870
I know that people love to
listen to you for a long time,

1312
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:53,510
love the podcast because most people do
is they listen to it while they're doing

1313
01:09:53,511 --> 01:09:56,420
other stuff. So that's the best way to do
it. That's brilliant. That's brilliant.

1314
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:01,290
It's a real genre. You know that it hasn't
really been addressed before. You know,

1315
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:04,010
I love coming here with you because it
gives me a chance to talk about these

1316
01:10:04,011 --> 01:10:07,760
ideas in a space in which is it just
bigger and people are listening to it,

1317
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:08,960
but you know from,

1318
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,900
for my situation to initially get to
avoid the word out about the videos,

1319
01:10:11,901 --> 01:10:14,060
it just worked to do with really short,

1320
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,970
but what I think people respond to them
is whether or not they're into the ideas

1321
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:19,760
of exponential growth and technology
and transforming the human condition.

1322
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:21,770
People are into the idea that inspiration,

1323
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:26,720
it needs to be reinvented how we package
and disseminate big ideas and needs to

1324
01:10:26,721 --> 01:10:31,460
be reexamined because we
have a new substrate. The
Internet is a new substrate.

1325
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,690
When we invented the printing press,

1326
01:10:32,691 --> 01:10:35,420
we came up with the format of the book
and there was like rules and parameters

1327
01:10:35,421 --> 01:10:38,750
and this is how it works. Best Television,
we came up with the Sitcom film.

1328
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:41,450
We came up with the length of time
that a film should be before people get

1329
01:10:41,451 --> 01:10:42,950
restless into theater
and so on and so forth.

1330
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:44,780
And I think on the Internet
we're still figuring it out.

1331
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:46,430
What are the parameters of work,

1332
01:10:46,431 --> 01:10:49,460
what are the lengths of videos that we're
literally look at the statistics and

1333
01:10:49,461 --> 01:10:52,040
get the information and find out how long
people pay attention to stuff and this

1334
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:53,420
and that.
And um,

1335
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,710
and so I'm just starting to raise ciders
when I find long form documentaries

1336
01:10:57,711 --> 01:11:00,140
available on like Google
video and youtube.

1337
01:11:00,141 --> 01:11:03,530
Sometimes we go to each of the people
pay people don't do it yet on their

1338
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:04,190
screens.

1339
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:08,500
We're going to have that more and we have
the merger of TV and with Web TV cause

1340
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,880
then you're on the TV,
you're on the couch watching TV,

1341
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,220
watching web content and it's different
experience. It's not just a small

1342
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,160
screen right. When the screen's
merge I think we'll have that.

1343
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,420
That's entirely going to happen.

1344
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:22,710
You don't think that it will be still
have the separation of computer and

1345
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:25,770
television? I think software
software's going to eat the world.

1346
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,100
That was a great article.
So do you think that networks like NBC ab,

1347
01:11:30,101 --> 01:11:30,901
that's like legacy,

1348
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:35,190
it's all gonna like be like VHS tapes
someday I think we'll be going to be

1349
01:11:35,191 --> 01:11:36,150
interfacing.

1350
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:40,050
I think the apple TV thing is coming
is my feeling and that is going to make

1351
01:11:40,051 --> 01:11:43,910
everything intuitive. And I read
an article yesterday, uh, from um,

1352
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:46,170
Nick Bilton from the Times
where he was saying that uh,

1353
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:50,670
he gets anxious when he looks at his
cable and TV box because there's so many

1354
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:53,490
buttons that it's so complicated and he
doesn't know what input is connected to

1355
01:11:53,491 --> 01:11:55,470
what the best and most of the stuff,
he doesn't want to watch it.

1356
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:58,790
There's so many over and he says that he
looks at it as like iPad and everything

1357
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:01,580
is so neat. Then he can press what he
wants and get what he wants in real time.

1358
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,680
Moving in that direction. I mean,
have you guys checked out Hbo go?

1359
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:07,320
It's really cool. Awesome.
Yeah, I mean on your computer,

1360
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:11,520
watch anything anytime on demand.
All eight years. Hbo Subscribers,

1361
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:15,130
premium. Beautiful. You know,
I experienced that shit.

1362
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:19,860
That's another thing that's a future
which is it's still clunky today and I

1363
01:12:19,861 --> 01:12:20,940
can't believe it's so clunky.

1364
01:12:20,941 --> 01:12:25,200
Like the other day I wanted it to
find a show on a channel and I'm like,

1365
01:12:25,201 --> 01:12:27,960
I don't know what the channel is.
I have a thousand numbers.

1366
01:12:27,961 --> 01:12:31,410
I'm like going through each channel,
like where the fuck is this channel?

1367
01:12:31,411 --> 01:12:34,650
You know? It should be a search. No, it's
just going to be Siri. It's going to be,

1368
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:37,690
it's going to be turned to the
cartoon network. You know? It's,

1369
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:41,910
and that's all it's going to be. The
remote control alone. It's just such,

1370
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:45,870
it's like looking at an old payphone.
Yeah. When the UFC moved to a fuel TV,

1371
01:12:45,871 --> 01:12:49,440
when they having some fights on fuel TV,
how to find fuel TV forever.

1372
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:52,630
Fucking luck. Good luck. It's sucks. Yeah.

1373
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:57,030
It's like six 18 on direct TV. Especially
when you have like HD channels now too.

1374
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,480
Half the time you're watching,

1375
01:12:59,481 --> 01:13:01,680
you're not even watching the HD
channel and you're like, oh shit,

1376
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:05,460
how long I've been watching this. There's
so many channels now, man. It's amazing.

1377
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:08,310
It's really, that's why I think the
apple TV, when it does get released,

1378
01:13:08,311 --> 01:13:09,750
I think that's just going
to change everything.

1379
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:12,150
I think everything's gonna be on
the cart. I think, you know, yeah,

1380
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:15,300
NBC was going to be around, but they're
going to be like any other channel.

1381
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:20,100
It's gonna be like, you know your channel,
you strike people like shows though.

1382
01:13:20,101 --> 01:13:20,521
They're like,

1383
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,510
like lost the like things that are going
to be produced by a production company

1384
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:29,130
that you might not be able to
replicate. You know, the, the home user,

1385
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:31,340
you know,
even with incredible software,

1386
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,070
people will always want the premium
experience and they're willing to pay for

1387
01:13:35,071 --> 01:13:36,150
the premium experience.
I mean,

1388
01:13:36,151 --> 01:13:40,470
I don't care to pay $20 to see an
imax three d film in a theater and be

1389
01:13:40,471 --> 01:13:43,530
completely immersive experience like that.
So did you like Avatar?

1390
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:47,010
I thought it was beautiful. Did you feel
any avatar depression when she left?

1391
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:51,630
You know, I think that's fascinating.
Don't you think? Love it. That idea.

1392
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:56,190
Like there's a great book called
the art of immersion by Frank Rose.

1393
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:58,830
It used to be at wired,
who says that?

1394
01:13:58,831 --> 01:14:02,850
The future of immersive storytelling
in an example is Avatar is such an

1395
01:14:02,851 --> 01:14:04,290
immersive three d experience and he says,

1396
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,640
we all long to go back to Pandora even
though we've never really been there.

1397
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:12,160
We miss something that wasn't really
real. But then again, everything

1398
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,250
is not really real because it's all
an illusion, but more and more dude,

1399
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:17,560
immersive experiences like
that. Yes, we're going to,

1400
01:14:17,561 --> 01:14:21,550
we're going to get sad when we fall out
of the game or out of the movie or out

1401
01:14:21,551 --> 01:14:25,360
of the virtual space cause
it's increasingly becoming
more interesting than

1402
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:26,194
reality.

1403
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,960
Well, Gut Avatar, depression, really,

1404
01:14:27,961 --> 01:14:31,800
they got depression that they weren't
one of those blue things because you

1405
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:32,634
wouldn't want to have,

1406
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,040
you don't wouldn't want to be
living in Avatar if you are a human,

1407
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:38,130
you just a little fucking bitch.
I think it was so pretty.

1408
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:39,540
I got jacked left and right.
Yeah,

1409
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:42,240
but humans like didn't even have
a chance in the avatar world,

1410
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,160
but you can't have habit.
Our depression,

1411
01:14:44,161 --> 01:14:47,190
you essentially have depression about
your species. You don't want to,

1412
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,630
you want to be one of the Navi.

1413
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:52,400
Well, if you want to be larger than
life, that can be what you want to live.

1414
01:14:52,401 --> 01:14:55,010
That lifestyle that they're living in
the love and honor. And I was little,

1415
01:14:55,011 --> 01:14:58,350
I used to carry him fly Indiana Jones
depression when Indiana Jones ended.

1416
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,300
I used to get sad.

1417
01:14:59,301 --> 01:15:02,540
I want to dig for treasure in my backyard
and I want it to have my life to be as

1418
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:05,720
fun as Indiana Jones. So I remember
that feeling as a kid, you know,

1419
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,780
I really remember leaving films and,
and wanting the,

1420
01:15:09,781 --> 01:15:13,730
the luster in the law to
sort of come home with me.

1421
01:15:13,731 --> 01:15:17,660
But usually we, you know, you buy
the [inaudible] Max and you watch it

1422
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:21,900
Avatar though,
that the culture of Avatar was missing.

1423
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:26,130
Everything that we're missing or
rather than the culture of Avatar,

1424
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:31,080
the culture of the Navi had everything
that we're missing that are lost society

1425
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:34,790
that are materialistic,
ridiculous to, you know,

1426
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,710
society where we're not taking
responsibility for our own actions.

1427
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:42,450
We all act collectively as a gigantic
group or corporation that this tribal

1428
01:15:42,451 --> 01:15:44,910
life, this tribal life
that were all these people,

1429
01:15:44,911 --> 01:15:48,570
like they're forced to told
her own weight. And celebrated
and loved each other.

1430
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,970
But that trial that,
that

1431
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:52,460
tribal life that
supposedly was so advanced,

1432
01:15:52,461 --> 01:15:54,800
I mean they still had
hierarchical systems.

1433
01:15:54,801 --> 01:15:58,730
There was still an angry boss that told
everybody else would do still warriors.

1434
01:15:58,731 --> 01:16:02,390
Like they hadn't really transcend
our store, our savage in fact,

1435
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,960
but they're happier than secretaries.
There's an interesting, uh,

1436
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:09,380
thing that Kurzweil had mentioned that
he thought it was really interesting that

1437
01:16:09,381 --> 01:16:14,381
you use the world's greatest technology
to bring our imaginings into being,

1438
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:19,400
to make that movie, to then
criticized technology in the movie.

1439
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:24,710
So you use the most powerful computers
and digital tools to realize that dream

1440
01:16:24,711 --> 01:16:25,544
into screen.

1441
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,990
And then you tell a story inside of
that technologically mediated reality.

1442
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,180
You tell a story about how bad technology
is and how we should all go live in a

1443
01:16:33,181 --> 01:16:33,830
forest.
Again,

1444
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:37,760
not really what they told the story
about was about greed and about the

1445
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:42,761
willingness to fuck over cultures and
kill a entities that also get lot of inner

1446
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,950
came out of that and said it
was an indictment of technology.

1447
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,930
What was the mineral impossible
Bahrainian or something like that.

1448
01:16:48,931 --> 01:16:52,700
It was some stupid fucking name. I
was like, what was it called Brian?

1449
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:57,830
And they saw the movie once obtained IOM
in obtaining them like and hip possible

1450
01:16:57,831 --> 01:17:00,710
to obtain something along those
lines. Like, oh, you silly goose.

1451
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:04,820
There's a great term called comp with
Terrainian that I recently learned.

1452
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:06,580
And I think it's when we've,
uh,

1453
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,130
leverage all the matter in universe

1454
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:13,700
or in the galaxy into computation.
So all the atoms,

1455
01:17:13,701 --> 01:17:18,210
we put computation into
everything and then becomes a
computronium. Well, I'm not,

1456
01:17:18,211 --> 01:17:19,820
I'm not sure if I'm explaining
it correctly, but yeah.

1457
01:17:19,821 --> 01:17:22,910
This idea that a civilization
will eventually get advanced,

1458
01:17:22,911 --> 01:17:25,970
that it can leverage all the matter in
the universe and put computation into it,

1459
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:29,930
harness all that matter and energy in
the universe. What does that even mean?

1460
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:34,490
Could you use that word computation?
Well, you know how there's, you know,

1461
01:17:34,491 --> 01:17:37,850
our computers are bunch of materials
and we put computation into those

1462
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,740
computation, into the
stars. Yeah, that's, yeah.

1463
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:45,350
How the fuck would you do that?
I'm not a physicist,

1464
01:17:45,351 --> 01:17:48,160
but this is stuff that you can find
physical articles that you know,

1465
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:51,380
speculate about the future and how society
will cross a scale and then it will

1466
01:17:51,381 --> 01:17:55,750
harness the energy of its star and put
computation into matter and terraform

1467
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,990
other worlds. And yeah, I mean it's,
it's, I mean we're over. I mean,

1468
01:17:59,991 --> 01:18:01,700
we already do it inside of computers.

1469
01:18:01,701 --> 01:18:04,910
I mean computation and
complexity inside of a microchip.

1470
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:07,430
The only other thing is
complex is the brain. You know,

1471
01:18:07,431 --> 01:18:10,610
what have nothing else in the universe
has that complexity I find fascinating.

1472
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:15,050
When I go back to like some 1980s
in 1990 science fiction movies,

1473
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:17,820
I like watching like what they thought
a computer was going to be like,

1474
01:18:17,821 --> 01:18:20,570
like the movie alien.
I watched that again the other day,

1475
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:24,170
one of my all time favorite movies and
amazing movie and still holds up as far

1476
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:27,560
as like, let's be excited about
prometheus's. Oh fuck it. Oh Man.

1477
01:18:27,561 --> 01:18:31,310
It's on the three d trailer and a theater.
Anything Ridley Scott comes up with,

1478
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:36,260
I'm down for the first alien movies. One
of my all time favorite movies. But God,

1479
01:18:36,261 --> 01:18:41,261
the computer looks so fucking wanky and
shit and it was fascinating that like,

1480
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:44,330
you know, when you look at like some of
these uh, older movies, they'll be like,

1481
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:49,480
they'll take place in 2017 and it's
like nothing looks anything like today.

1482
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,710
Everything super futuristic,
flying cars and shit.

1483
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:57,230
Like when was blade runner is
supposed to be taking place in?

1484
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:59,990
How far in the future was it?
That's a good question.

1485
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:02,510
I don't think it was that far.
I don't do it to you.

1486
01:19:02,511 --> 01:19:04,700
She anything close to what you would see.

1487
01:19:04,701 --> 01:19:08,480
Some of the little flying robots
that they showed at Ted this year,

1488
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:11,100
I saw some of the choreograph,

1489
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:15,200
choreograph flying little helicopters
that could do a dance and go around

1490
01:19:15,201 --> 01:19:16,920
obstacles and objects
and there's going to be,

1491
01:19:16,921 --> 01:19:20,960
have HD cameras and they can map rooms.
The Google self driving cars,

1492
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:24,530
200,000 miles.
They've driven with zero accidents.

1493
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,460
1 million people a year die in road
accidents. Okay. 1 million people a year.

1494
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,290
When we switch over to
those self driving cars,

1495
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:33,110
which we already know after 200,000 miles,
no accidents,

1496
01:19:33,111 --> 01:19:36,710
they're only going to get better. That's,
I mean that's what cars are going to be.

1497
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:40,390
Of course self driving cars, airplanes,
man. But then you went there too.

1498
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,830
Unreliable. He never be able
to go sideways or on a corner.

1499
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:46,090
You can do it in a sport track.
You'd have to go to the track. Yeah,

1500
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,121
it'll be a sport,

1501
01:19:47,121 --> 01:19:49,730
but not in a place where you can hit
a pedestrian or hurt somebody else.

1502
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:54,240
You know? Of course that will
be, but that's, yeah, that's
coming man. It's amazing.

1503
01:19:54,241 --> 01:19:57,560
It goes Google guys. God their
genius. Yeah, there there are.

1504
01:19:57,561 --> 01:19:59,210
So no one saw them coming.

1505
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:03,860
I mean if there was a sky net and skynet
wanting to sneak up on society and just

1506
01:20:03,861 --> 01:20:05,420
sort of integrated self completely.

1507
01:20:05,421 --> 01:20:09,060
I mean it is Google is there
like a website is skynet.com
or something like that.

1508
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:09,451
Yeah,

1509
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:14,340
but I think at this point their
ambition of don't be evil is so true.

1510
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:16,440
I mean, I think that, I love
Google, don't get me wrong,

1511
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,540
but I'm saying it's
amazing what Google maps.

1512
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:23,570
Google fucking voicemail and Google
g-mail all freeze this Christ all free.

1513
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:25,380
Yeah,
it's credible to crap.

1514
01:20:25,381 --> 01:20:28,800
There's a whole book about how everything
is d materializing and it's becoming

1515
01:20:28,801 --> 01:20:29,634
for free.

1516
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:32,310
We used to have a camera but now camera
doesn't exist because it's inside your

1517
01:20:32,311 --> 01:20:33,070
phone.

1518
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:36,210
You used to have like a notebook to
write things down that that disappeared

1519
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:37,290
cause now it's all on your phone,

1520
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,410
which by the way is dematerializing
and going into your device.

1521
01:20:40,411 --> 01:20:44,310
Have you seen this new device that's just
come on as a new droid that came out?

1522
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:47,850
This the Samsung Journal.
Oh,

1523
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:51,960
have you seen this thing Penn one to
know dude, it's fucking five inches.

1524
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,790
It's huge.
It's the biggest one ever.

1525
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:58,650
It's like a cross between a tablet and
an iPhone. It's amazing. Beautiful.

1526
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:03,600
But the battery lasts about 35 seconds.
Totally not full brightness.

1527
01:21:03,601 --> 01:21:06,540
You've got about a half a half a minute.
That's pretty crazy.

1528
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:11,340
It's pretty crazy that that new iPad
three a has the same battery life,

1529
01:21:11,341 --> 01:21:15,930
but yet the screens HD and that's
exponential growth right there.

1530
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:18,720
Those battery life, the battery
life on those iPads was amazing.

1531
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:23,670
Their first batch already. Dude, is
it, the demand is unprecedented, dude.

1532
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:26,220
It's pretty shocking how long you
can watch a movie on those things.

1533
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:27,990
Watch a three,
four movies and you look at it.

1534
01:21:27,991 --> 01:21:31,320
It's not even like halfway choose to with
a battery and I can't wait for the eye

1535
01:21:31,321 --> 01:21:33,750
mind. You think they're already
working on the I mine does that.

1536
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:37,280
It'll be like a synthetic mind,
you know directly I can trust.

1537
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:41,060
I can't wait for the high car. They
need to make cars. I need to make a car.

1538
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:44,130
They'll do their counterparts of Google's
self driving android cars and then

1539
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:46,800
apple needs. It's aicar
cheeses. How long before?

1540
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:49,890
We see self driving cars on the
street very soon. Very soon.

1541
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:53,280
Because Google already has them driving
in California and there's been over

1542
01:21:53,281 --> 01:21:56,810
200,000 miles. Yeah. The
driving in California right
now, like, oh yeah, you can,

1543
01:21:56,811 --> 01:22:01,080
you could be rear ended by a fucking
zero accidents and 200,000 miles on it.

1544
01:22:01,081 --> 01:22:03,120
I'll be the first one. The Sun, they map,

1545
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:06,840
they map three dimensional maps of what's
in front of them. Dude, it's insane.

1546
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:10,140
They can see like they can see and
they can notice people walking.

1547
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:14,350
They'll adjust accordingly. It's in, you
know, it freaks me out. Meet the scene.

1548
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:18,270
We got onto this through the
idea of robotics and flying
drones freaks me out as

1549
01:22:18,271 --> 01:22:22,110
those, uh, those things that
walk, that have like 10,

1550
01:22:22,111 --> 01:22:25,020
15 legs and you kick
kick 'em and they adjust.

1551
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:29,820
It looks like a dog with that thing.
Man,

1552
01:22:29,821 --> 01:22:31,950
that's incredible.
You should have seen the Ted talk,

1553
01:22:31,951 --> 01:22:35,310
the head of Darpa gave a Ted talk to
and she was the most poised, elegant,

1554
01:22:35,311 --> 01:22:36,091
articulate,

1555
01:22:36,091 --> 01:22:39,540
attractive woman dues and that the
people from last Darpa is the defense.

1556
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:43,050
Advanced Research Dharma. I
know. Dark. She was amazing.

1557
01:22:43,051 --> 01:22:44,430
She was talking about
dreaming the impossible.

1558
01:22:44,431 --> 01:22:47,340
She actually reminded me of Jodie
Foster's character in contact.

1559
01:22:47,341 --> 01:22:49,770
Is this really elegant,
poised our ticket?

1560
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:51,690
You actually felt comforted
to know that somebody,

1561
01:22:51,691 --> 01:22:55,360
that intelligence seeming is like
running Darpa and her ted talk was Ugh,

1562
01:22:55,361 --> 01:22:56,520
belligerent talking about,

1563
01:22:56,990 --> 01:23:00,380
she was talking about
dreaming the impossible and
we have to challenge what we,

1564
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:02,790
what is in order to dream about
what could be and you know,

1565
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:06,250
and she's speaking on behalf of
the agency who has a lot of stuff.

1566
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:08,710
So it's kind of a main thing.
I don't know.

1567
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:11,740
But a lot of stuff that we take
these short today cutting edge stuff.

1568
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:14,530
Are you sure? I'm pretty sure if you
don't know, how can you be sure? Well,

1569
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:17,170
cause if you read about dark all the
time and they do the advanced secret

1570
01:23:17,171 --> 01:23:19,400
research project, wow. I
wonder what they're working on.

1571
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:23,690
She showed a hypersonic planes. We
still haven't got to aliens. Uh,

1572
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:26,200
we didn't get to alien. No, we went
to you went out and took me out.

1573
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:29,500
I told you about trends. Sension why
we don't buy, we could never see them.

1574
01:23:29,501 --> 01:23:31,510
FERMI's paradox.
So you don't think we'll ever see him?

1575
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:34,870
Only when we build our own
black hole and go into it,

1576
01:23:34,871 --> 01:23:38,230
then we'll meet them at the end of time.
Whoa. Cause it's sling shots you at.

1577
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:42,430
So it's not terrible that they could just
be like roaming through this universe

1578
01:23:42,431 --> 01:23:46,180
in galactic that if they did that,
that would influence our evolution.

1579
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:49,270
US discovering them and being
influenced by their technology would be

1580
01:23:49,271 --> 01:23:52,720
influencing our ultimate
evolution [inaudible] battery.

1581
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,610
It will get a butterfly effect.
And the,

1582
01:23:54,611 --> 01:23:56,920
the thing that John's smart says is they
wouldn't want to do that because that

1583
01:23:56,921 --> 01:24:01,690
would be akin to incest to influencing
us in some way. And then changing the,

1584
01:24:01,691 --> 01:24:05,800
how we unfold devil's advocate, this is
through our understanding of genetics,

1585
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:06,850
right?
It's not through theirs.

1586
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,700
And if there are a thousand or a
million years more advanced than us,

1587
01:24:09,701 --> 01:24:12,420
maybe they know a lot more about
how to work that shit. Right.

1588
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:13,540
And maybe that's why he says it's a,

1589
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:16,600
maybe it's not that they would
think of it as incest at all,

1590
01:24:16,601 --> 01:24:21,070
but they've completely gone past the idea
of gender and replication by means of

1591
01:24:21,071 --> 01:24:25,000
sexuality is just what we had
replication from the primate form.

1592
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,580
But they wouldn't want it to
replicate their technology. Alien,

1593
01:24:27,581 --> 01:24:30,910
large almond shaped I form.
Right.

1594
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:33,760
They wouldn't want us to replicate their
technology says who I mean. Well maybe,

1595
01:24:33,761 --> 01:24:36,950
maybe there's a some sort of thing
that will lead to the most amount of

1596
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,420
diversity and if we're not influenced by
them they'll be more diversity because

1597
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:43,350
we'll get there ourselves.
It's just beginning to get
the end of the day. Anyway,

1598
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:43,811
that's what he says.

1599
01:24:43,811 --> 01:24:47,230
I got a deal that people really love
to share when it comes to a wacky alien

1600
01:24:47,231 --> 01:24:50,290
theories is that aliens have genetically
engineered human beings in the first

1601
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:53,110
place of that. I mean, I
mean you can't unproved that.

1602
01:24:53,111 --> 01:24:55,270
So the next five years that's a problem,
right?

1603
01:24:55,480 --> 01:25:00,250
You can't improve leprechaun throw.
You know why that's,

1604
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:04,300
that's the thing. That's the dog
thing. We're watching those, the, the,

1605
01:25:04,301 --> 01:25:07,750
the nuttiest thing about this, this
weird looking robot things and it moves.

1606
01:25:07,751 --> 01:25:12,550
It has like sort of like, oh,
like an insect like leg set up,

1607
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,700
kick it, it adjusts and it
doesn't fall down. Yeah.

1608
01:25:15,701 --> 01:25:19,090
Look at adjusting to the sand and
the toad and walking on a beach.

1609
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:23,170
And if that thing starts saying hi to
you and smiling and drooling and it was

1610
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:26,260
totally fall in love, know what I'm seeing
to put that thing on one more second.

1611
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,213
You know what I'm saying?

1612
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,600
I'm seeing that thing storm out of the
back of a giant battleship and missiles

1613
01:25:31,601 --> 01:25:33,520
flying off of it.
That's what I think.

1614
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:35,290
I think if they make one
of those fucking things,

1615
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:37,150
they make it to send over to countries.

1616
01:25:37,151 --> 01:25:40,930
Could you imagine a whole army of these
motherfuckers heading into your town

1617
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:43,100
shooting missiles? I, you tell me.

1618
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:47,560
I'm imagining them as pets for
rocket launchers on that bitch.

1619
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:49,630
It's always a double edged sword.
I have to admit,

1620
01:25:49,631 --> 01:25:51,020
it's always a double edged sword.
But look,

1621
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:55,320
what do people start riding
and they become the, they
will become the new horses.

1622
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:58,570
There'll be our little pets. Look, it's
wagging its tail. It's wagon to say,

1623
01:25:58,571 --> 01:26:02,430
oh gosh, you feel bad for it when he
kicks it. You feel bad. So humans, yeah,

1624
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,130
but think of how quickly you feel bad

1625
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:04,911
for it.
I do.

1626
01:26:04,911 --> 01:26:09,330
But what's amazing is this thing adjusted
and it seems to be adjusting the, the,

1627
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:13,040
the movements seem organic.
Yeah, totally. Totally.

1628
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:16,140
Biomimic we're going to have one of
those and we're going to ride them like,

1629
01:26:16,141 --> 01:26:18,890
yeah, like a, like a goat
down the side of a mountain.

1630
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,640
That's what he's going to be like.
You know those,

1631
01:26:20,641 --> 01:26:22,580
those crazy goats that can they,
they're,

1632
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:26,330
they're incredibly strong and they climb
up the side of mountains. They never,

1633
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:30,700
she never, she plane. Yeah. They
never get tired. They don't have ache.

1634
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:32,030
Yeah.

1635
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:35,220
But then they would probably run on solar
power to eventually it's solar power

1636
01:26:35,221 --> 01:26:38,060
is going to get to a point where it
can power everything. Right. Of course.

1637
01:26:38,061 --> 01:26:42,230
Then when we get 10,000 times more energy
from the sun than we need this fucking

1638
01:26:42,231 --> 01:26:45,500
thing. Slow Shit doing a better way,
better ways of capturing that energy.

1639
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,870
I'd be pissed if I was writing this
stupid thing right now. I'd be like,

1640
01:26:47,871 --> 01:26:52,250
come on bitch. Free Energy. That gives
us free energy to heavy Brian for that,

1641
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,820
for that. You know how it's going and
say, oh wow. It's making it through.

1642
01:26:55,821 --> 01:26:57,860
So fascinating.
That's incredible.

1643
01:26:57,890 --> 01:27:01,370
It's walking down to the snow and there's
a bunch of different designs of them

1644
01:27:01,371 --> 01:27:05,180
too. I've seen other ones that have
like many more legs. Wow, that's crazy.

1645
01:27:05,181 --> 01:27:09,860
Look at this things. Dancing, robotics,
robotics is going to be such a huge, well,

1646
01:27:09,861 --> 01:27:14,600
robotics and AI, artificial
intelligence, robot rice. Look at that.

1647
01:27:14,601 --> 01:27:18,380
That down to the bare skeleton of a thing.
This is incredible stuff folks.

1648
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,880
I know we're just talking right now.

1649
01:27:19,881 --> 01:27:22,760
Unfortunately for a lot of you folks
that are listening to this on Itunes,

1650
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:25,400
just go, which should they Google
Brian so they could watch this.

1651
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:30,410
This is Boston dynamics,
but just say new big dog robot,

1652
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:34,820
new big dog robot video, and it looks
like a spider when you're looking. Really,

1653
01:27:34,821 --> 01:27:38,120
it's a must and it's the one that has
700 plus thousand hits on it. It's,

1654
01:27:38,121 --> 01:27:42,400
it's a must. See you. You need to know.
Amazing. Yeah, it's, I mean, what,

1655
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:46,400
what does the future hold that we're
not prepared for? What is the next step?

1656
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:50,290
You know, I mean, the Internet I think
caught most people by surprise. Well,

1657
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:54,650
there were in her a robot dog.
Oh my God,

1658
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:58,760
Brian just put on a robot dog and this
thing is moving around like an animated

1659
01:27:58,761 --> 01:28:02,150
dog. This is insane.
The thing is, there was,

1660
01:28:02,151 --> 01:28:05,640
there was a guy at Ted that showed
his, uh, oh my God, that's the same.

1661
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:09,020
That dog's insane now where there's
been this guy ted, no, no, no.

1662
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:09,651
There's going to be,

1663
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:12,640
there's going to be more of those kinds
of robots and the more that they, uh,

1664
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:15,680
interface with us and they look
cute, we'll be, we'll start.

1665
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:19,400
It doesn't matter if they're conscious
or not as once they cross a certain kind

1666
01:28:19,401 --> 01:28:22,970
of perceptual barrier that we have
and they're like, they seem real.

1667
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:25,270
We'll start to interface with
them as they're going to be hard.

1668
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,590
Just like your dog, you know,
when you come home and have a car,

1669
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,280
I come home and have a
conversation with your dog.

1670
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:31,790
It doesn't matter if you
understand the way the feedback,

1671
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:35,150
and we'll have the same thing with robots
do it as long as we can get past the

1672
01:28:35,151 --> 01:28:40,151
idea that something that's a metal and
wires and you know that that thing can't

1673
01:28:41,001 --> 01:28:43,580
have some sort of a soul because
you're interacting with it.

1674
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:46,430
You know if you're interacting with
it as long as plenty soul in it,

1675
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:49,020
what is your fucking
computer gets needy like,

1676
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:52,400
well maybe you might want it to get
needy because it'll make you feel like

1677
01:28:52,401 --> 01:28:54,340
you're,
you're important to site.

1678
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:57,730
Maybe that's a part of like what
it's like to have vagal butt fucked.

1679
01:28:57,731 --> 01:29:00,350
All that erode fucked all the
really good ones. So like the look,

1680
01:29:00,351 --> 01:29:02,640
they're really dangerous. Like this
pitch might burn your house down.

1681
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:07,140
Like you can't fuck other girls. Like
she's really, she's going to be the best,

1682
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:08,730
hottest robot fucked off ever.

1683
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,450
The robots will whatever you want and
that's the only way to make it hot.

1684
01:29:12,451 --> 01:29:14,190
The only way that they get hot,
she has to be super jealous.

1685
01:29:14,191 --> 01:29:17,580
She can't just let you just
treat her like shit. I mean,

1686
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:23,220
why aren't you sharing
your location services? She
becomes, she becomes a robot,

1687
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:27,120
an angry psycho jealous robot,
and that's the hottest sex you can get.

1688
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,040
And so that's why
everybody just accepts it.

1689
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:33,510
You'll be able to do whatever you want
the robots, robots are going to be,

1690
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,910
there'll be Asian Robo fucker.
I was telling us no questions,

1691
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:41,130
just take care of business son. Right?
They'll always be the exotic Asian robot.

1692
01:29:41,131 --> 01:29:45,090
Fucked dolls. Yeah. W you
know there's interesting,

1693
01:29:45,091 --> 01:29:46,530
we talking about all these exotic,

1694
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:49,620
all these exotic technology and it's
sounding like we're talking about Asians

1695
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:52,710
were not.
So it sounds a hallucinatory,

1696
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:57,920
even though it's very quickly emerge
and it just takes you back to that whole

1697
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:02,270
thing about computers as the
modern version of the psychedelic.

1698
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:04,530
Just want to say if you're an Asian girl,
I'm just joking around.

1699
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:07,020
These are just jokes or
just throw things out there.

1700
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:11,250
I don't mean anything by him. Okay.
But what do you think of that?

1701
01:30:11,251 --> 01:30:12,690
Like to told Timothy Leary,

1702
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:16,200
computers are the LSD of the nineties
and people took drugs and they're like,

1703
01:30:16,201 --> 01:30:20,220
we can expand our minds and
now computers expand our minds.

1704
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:23,510
Well relationship is very fascinating
to me. It's absolutely fascinating.

1705
01:30:23,530 --> 01:30:26,760
Well right now, just think this, what's
this interface it's happening right now.

1706
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,890
This is all live, right. You
know, and right now there's,

1707
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:32,520
there's only 2000 people
aren't sinked up live with us.

1708
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:36,900
But eventually this, this feeling
of this conversation and these,

1709
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:40,540
these ideas explored. I'm going to branch
out to about a half a million Pete,

1710
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:45,130
but right. Throw half a million
in mind. Our thoughts. Yeah.

1711
01:30:45,131 --> 01:30:49,050
And out of that half a million,
who knows how many people are gonna just,

1712
01:30:49,051 --> 01:30:49,380
you know,

1713
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:53,310
I read this Tony Robbins thing once where
he talked about Tony Robbins actually

1714
01:30:53,311 --> 01:30:54,450
very positive.
You know,

1715
01:30:54,451 --> 01:30:56,880
a lot of people think that Tony Robbins
is full of shit cause he's kind of like

1716
01:30:56,881 --> 01:31:00,480
made a loud noise. I think he's brilliant.
He's, he's up. We've got a lot of very,

1717
01:31:00,481 --> 01:31:04,650
very good points. And one of them was to
change your life to make huge changes.

1718
01:31:04,651 --> 01:31:09,651
All you need is a small change in the
direction and over time that small change

1719
01:31:09,751 --> 01:31:13,670
will lead you so far apart of where your
initial direction was. Absolutely true.

1720
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:17,910
The idea is that if you have two cars in
two parallel lines and one of them just

1721
01:31:17,911 --> 01:31:20,490
takes a slight turn to the right
and they keep driving straight,

1722
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:22,940
the one who slight turned the
right, it's going to be, you know,

1723
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:24,000
a hundred miles from now,

1724
01:31:24,001 --> 01:31:27,060
it's going to be way the fuck
away from that other one total.

1725
01:31:27,061 --> 01:31:30,480
And that's sometimes really how you
have to look at it. We especially,

1726
01:31:30,481 --> 01:31:33,670
I mean I'm a super impatient person.
I want things now too.

1727
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:35,340
Even when I go to the supermarket,
I'm like,

1728
01:31:35,341 --> 01:31:37,680
you bitches don't have any
grass fed beef seriously. Right.

1729
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:42,740
But I mean like what I proposed to his
headset that I think that I can just go

1730
01:31:42,811 --> 01:31:46,920
to a place and they've killed an
animal for me, raised it on grass,

1731
01:31:46,921 --> 01:31:49,920
only killed animals and there's
plenty of meat. I can feed my family.

1732
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,990
I can stay alive from this dog,
this food here.

1733
01:31:51,991 --> 01:31:55,500
And this is what I'm planning because
they didn't get the shipment of organic

1734
01:31:55,501 --> 01:31:58,470
meat that day. Well, think about it.
I have no grass fed beef to fuck.

1735
01:31:58,530 --> 01:32:00,010
But what about when you're having a Skype

1736
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,310
conversation with somebody on the other
side of the planet and you're just like

1737
01:32:03,311 --> 01:32:07,060
taken for granted that you can see their
face and they could see yours. You know,

1738
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:11,290
you're talking in real time for free
and then like all of a sudden it might

1739
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:13,540
freeze. You're like, Oh God
damn man, it's freezing.

1740
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:15,430
Why is this freaking computer freezing?

1741
01:32:15,431 --> 01:32:20,431
Why is but like think about what you
were just enjoying two seconds before you

1742
01:32:20,621 --> 01:32:25,150
totally take it for granted.
Now we assimilate man. He
dynamic adaptation. Yeah.

1743
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:28,310
That is what it is. It is an
adaptation. You know, it's, it's uh,

1744
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:31,840
it's amazing though that we have this
urge in this push to make things bigger,

1745
01:32:31,841 --> 01:32:32,674
faster,
quicker,

1746
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:36,250
and that that urgent push
is also responsible for one
of the reasons why people

1747
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:39,310
get accustomed to things and want more.

1748
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:41,500
And you used a quote you quoted Mckenna,

1749
01:32:41,501 --> 01:32:45,160
and you talked about how something about
the astonishment and not give it to the

1750
01:32:45,161 --> 01:32:47,230
astonishment,
astonished that give into it,

1751
01:32:47,231 --> 01:32:49,990
but definitely seek it out
because I think most people, well,

1752
01:32:49,991 --> 01:32:54,370
he's talking about DMT though.
Yeah. Dm The beat the truth and DMT.

1753
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:58,780
DMT have not, but don't you
think that, for example,

1754
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:03,820
it's astonishing that you can do this
podcast and reach half a million minds and

1755
01:33:03,821 --> 01:33:08,170
very rarely does one marvel
at the astonishment of the
things that are every day

1756
01:33:08,171 --> 01:33:08,680
that are Morag,

1757
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:11,680
how many hundreds of thousands
of Aircrafts are flying
through the air right now

1758
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:14,050
communicating with one another,
flying safely,

1759
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:16,390
individuals in other to
other parts of the world.

1760
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:20,860
We don't experience that astonishment. I
don't wake up in astonishment. We should.

1761
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:22,180
Yeah, you're absolutely right. I mean,

1762
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:25,690
if you had pulled someone out of the
cave man error and put him in modern

1763
01:33:25,691 --> 01:33:30,390
society, it would be just a psychedelic
as a lot of pot trips. Yes. Yeah, yeah,

1764
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:33,890
exactly. It'd be so
bizarre. And outside of the,

1765
01:33:33,891 --> 01:33:38,410
the wha what you conceived of just seconds
ago as being possible. Right. You know,

1766
01:33:38,411 --> 01:33:41,120
you take someone from, you know, a
thousand years ago, 500 years ago,

1767
01:33:41,121 --> 01:33:44,680
a blip in time means nothing to the
universe and then put them in today or put

1768
01:33:44,681 --> 01:33:46,990
them in a garden movie theater
making watch Harry Potter and Shit.

1769
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:48,140
His pants shit is bad.

1770
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:52,600
You imagine what a garden out of a fucking
dragon when I was Harry Potter Dragon

1771
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,090
will own fire out flying to the fight.

1772
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:58,700
He would just dive on the ground
screaming in the car. Right?

1773
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:03,700
That is so amazing. The fact that that it,
that is that we wake up in the morning,

1774
01:34:03,701 --> 01:34:05,620
we don't think about that
because that just is,

1775
01:34:05,621 --> 01:34:10,621
we're onto the next thing and onto the
next thing to be looking forward to or to

1776
01:34:11,051 --> 01:34:12,250
be complaining about.

1777
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,830
And maybe that's the part
of our evolutionary makeup
that makes us always probe

1778
01:34:17,831 --> 01:34:20,860
the boundaries of the adjacent possible
and always want to keep pushing because

1779
01:34:20,861 --> 01:34:23,920
maybe if we were in astonishment of all
we've done, we wouldn't keep progressing.

1780
01:34:23,921 --> 01:34:27,460
We're obsessed with innovation.
Human beings are obsessed with innovation.

1781
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,060
You mean, you know, every
year sports cars get faster.

1782
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:36,640
We're getting to a point right now where
like regular cars are doing like race

1783
01:34:36,641 --> 01:34:40,870
track numbers. Even though we have
speed limits, even though we have that,

1784
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:43,240
like we still push the performance limits.

1785
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:45,670
I'm fascinated by by sports
cars cause just cause I'm,

1786
01:34:45,671 --> 01:34:47,420
I'm fascinated by extreme engineering.
Yeah.

1787
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:50,110
It's fascinating by the idea that there's
a bunch of people out there that are

1788
01:34:50,111 --> 01:34:51,610
trying to get something
to the handles faster.

1789
01:34:51,611 --> 01:34:53,800
I was better geometry moves better sticks.

1790
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:58,100
And the newest nine
Porsche nine 11 goes around

1791
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:02,840
the track as fast as the nine
nine six cup car. So the,

1792
01:35:02,841 --> 01:35:07,220
the Newburg ring, which is like this
really twisty turny track in Germany,

1793
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:12,790
a really high end sports car can go
around it today at about seven minutes,

1794
01:35:13,671 --> 01:35:18,550
30 seconds, seven minutes, 40 seconds.
That's like a nine 11 a real high end car.

1795
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:22,940
That's with race cars would
do just a decade earlier.

1796
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:28,250
So it's getting to this crazy point
where regular modern street cars aren't

1797
01:35:28,251 --> 01:35:29,960
like,
like fucking cup cars.

1798
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:34,480
So how much faster do you need these
fucking things? Like you know Dubai,

1799
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:37,280
but you got Ebay, Ron,
they have a Bugatti Veyron.

1800
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:41,240
It's like a thousand fucking
horsepower. We do it just to do it, man.

1801
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:45,590
Just that's crazy is to see how
much complexity we can pack into it.

1802
01:35:45,591 --> 01:35:47,480
How much performance
you can get out of it.

1803
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:52,040
It's like modern jet engines do operate
at half the temperature of the surface

1804
01:35:52,041 --> 01:35:56,100
of the sun because he's more of a modern
jet engine. Just if you, I mean it's,

1805
01:35:56,110 --> 01:35:59,360
it's insane. Okayed spins
at 500 miles. But I mean,

1806
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:03,560
I don't remember the speed but a jet
engines or if really feats of engineering.

1807
01:36:03,561 --> 01:36:06,350
I mean it's, I mean, you know,
we, everyone's scared of flying.

1808
01:36:06,351 --> 01:36:09,800
Jesus Christ is 30,000 flights a day
and nothing happens. It's incredible.

1809
01:36:09,801 --> 01:36:12,230
So safe. It's amazing. Yeah.

1810
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:14,810
But the way you'd go is so terrifying.

1811
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:17,330
Just slamming into the
fucking rain forest.

1812
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:22,880
That's why I love Virgin America so much,
dude. Cause they got brand new planes.

1813
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:26,930
They really rock,
brand new state of the art fleet.

1814
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:30,260
Well because most other airlines in
this country, countries have fleets.

1815
01:36:30,261 --> 01:36:33,710
They're 20 to 25 to 30 years old.
Scared the fuck out of me right now.

1816
01:36:33,711 --> 01:36:37,490
I need to go. No, no, no. Listen,
that doesn't make them any less safe.

1817
01:36:37,491 --> 01:36:41,570
These planes are still certified and well
maintained. Nonetheless. Nonetheless,

1818
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:42,710
on Virgin America,

1819
01:36:42,711 --> 01:36:47,711
you're getting a brand new fleet of
shiny gated yard with the best of

1820
01:36:48,111 --> 01:36:51,560
everything. With Internet.
No, you're not getting a brand
new pilot, let's say, dude,

1821
01:36:51,561 --> 01:36:52,790
we're ready. You know, it's just,

1822
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:55,820
but it's nice [inaudible] it's the years
2012 you want to fly on an airplane

1823
01:36:55,821 --> 01:36:58,340
that was manufactured, you know,
in the last year or two or three.

1824
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:00,890
It's just makes you feel
better when they're shiny.

1825
01:37:00,891 --> 01:37:02,390
There's less stress fractures. It's, yeah,

1826
01:37:02,391 --> 01:37:05,600
it is kind of an interesting thing about
air technology is that we essentially

1827
01:37:05,601 --> 01:37:06,171
have the same tech.

1828
01:37:06,171 --> 01:37:09,310
It's really one of the only industries
that has the same technology, you know,

1829
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:10,550
general principles.

1830
01:37:10,551 --> 01:37:13,910
But the engines are far more reliable
and far more advanced than they were

1831
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:17,360
before. What, what? When did they start
getting much better? Oh, well, yeah.

1832
01:37:17,380 --> 01:37:19,190
At the same Moore's law
that applies in computers.

1833
01:37:19,191 --> 01:37:22,640
I mean the engineering of a modern jet
engine and the computers are jets from

1834
01:37:22,641 --> 01:37:25,670
like the 1970s and 1980s.
Well, no, they make,

1835
01:37:25,671 --> 01:37:28,100
they make revisions that are pretty
much like an entire new model.

1836
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:31,670
I find wine still worry engines. They
change everything. Yeah. I phoned one.

1837
01:37:31,671 --> 01:37:35,180
It'll work as long as you don't have to
take the software. Right, right. But, uh,

1838
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:39,460
it's kind of fun to go on the new ones.
They have far more technology.

1839
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:42,590
That robot dog, you know what
that's going to be in the future.

1840
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:44,780
Check the screen out right here.
How crazy is this?

1841
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:49,520
Somebody posted this on your message
board, but uh, hold on. Episode two,

1842
01:37:49,521 --> 01:37:52,880
attack of the clones. Uh, here
we go. [inaudible] my God,

1843
01:37:52,881 --> 01:37:57,120
that's the robot augmented placed
in there or well, yeah, yeah.

1844
01:37:57,180 --> 01:37:59,610
But imagine there at ads,
you know, from Star Wars,

1845
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:03,930
those robot dogs are the exact same thing
as an ad. Oh Dude, you're totally right.

1846
01:38:03,931 --> 01:38:08,130
I mean, it looks exactly the same. Oh, so
what is that? That's just the added that,

1847
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:12,990
yeah. Somebody just put a funny video
together. Well that's, that's amazing.

1848
01:38:12,991 --> 01:38:17,470
You're totally right. Yeah. That's exactly
what it is. Yeah. It's fast. Brian.

1849
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:22,470
Stupid fucking cat clock. How dare
you. Oh, is that the cat clock? Yeah,

1850
01:38:22,471 --> 01:38:25,310
that's the, uh, the famous
cat clock. He likes,

1851
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:30,040
he likes things to meow. Um, you know,

1852
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:33,990
future of medicine, man. Are you
excited about that? Yeah. Well,

1853
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:37,890
I'm excited about the idea of keeping
people alive long enough to figure out

1854
01:38:37,891 --> 01:38:39,420
some really crazy shit.
Oh yeah.

1855
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:43,890
The idea of people staying long enough
to overpopulate the planet kind of freaks

1856
01:38:43,891 --> 01:38:44,724
me out though.

1857
01:38:45,230 --> 01:38:49,200
It was the most people cluster around
only like 3% of the surface of the world,

1858
01:38:49,201 --> 01:38:52,920
which is the city states. Cities.
Yeah. Know the world is still mostly,

1859
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:57,720
and it's mostly water and technology
is more like a resource liberating

1860
01:38:57,721 --> 01:39:00,270
mechanism because scarcity
is just contextual.

1861
01:39:00,271 --> 01:39:03,570
Things are only scarce until you create
technology that makes them into things

1862
01:39:03,571 --> 01:39:05,820
that are abundant.
People talk about water wars,

1863
01:39:05,821 --> 01:39:09,150
but the mini not worried at all about
overpopulation. Oh Man, no, not at all.

1864
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:09,511
In fact,

1865
01:39:09,511 --> 01:39:13,200
the more developed and educated people
become and in developed nations that the

1866
01:39:13,201 --> 01:39:15,510
rate of having children
goes down significantly.

1867
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:19,680
Mckenna has the best cure
against overpopulation is
to educate our people and

1868
01:39:19,681 --> 01:39:23,070
put more in technology into
their hands, but also, um,

1869
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:26,580
also like desalinization for example, you
know, once we perfect that technology,

1870
01:39:26,581 --> 01:39:30,210
this, this is called a blue planet.
It's a water planet. It's mostly water.

1871
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:31,650
It just needs to be converted.

1872
01:39:31,651 --> 01:39:34,310
But they have anything right
now that can their deals.

1873
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:37,680
Israel has a lot of these ellipses
desalinization plants. Oh yeah.

1874
01:39:37,681 --> 01:39:39,540
Just got to get more advanced.
Just like solar panels.

1875
01:39:39,541 --> 01:39:40,680
It's just exponential growth.

1876
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:43,410
Once they hit the tipping point where
it's actually cheaper to use those

1877
01:39:43,411 --> 01:39:45,930
technologies and to do it the other way,
then it becomes,

1878
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:50,810
it'll become the main thing. Wow. Great.

1879
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:51,943
You need to create,

1880
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:55,980
incentivize to incentivize people to
innovate and we're such constant will

1881
01:39:55,981 --> 01:39:57,390
probably dry out the fucking ocean.

1882
01:39:57,391 --> 01:39:59,640
We'll probably pull all the
water out of the ocean. No,

1883
01:39:59,641 --> 01:40:03,810
I don't think we were plenty of water.
Imagine though, if we're so greedy,

1884
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:05,730
we use up all the water and the ocean.
I mean,

1885
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:09,330
nobody predicted that we
would have polluted the ocean
the way we have and just

1886
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:09,450
a hundred years.

1887
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:13,110
I mean we've done an incredible job with
fucking old nano technology will create

1888
01:40:13,111 --> 01:40:16,710
synthetic biology that eats
the plastic and we'll, yes.

1889
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:19,380
Where's the evidence of that ever
having taken place in the past?

1890
01:40:19,381 --> 01:40:20,860
When have we ever fixed anything?
There is a,

1891
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:24,930
there's an x prize contest that the x
prize is doing to come up to something

1892
01:40:24,931 --> 01:40:25,741
with plastics.

1893
01:40:25,741 --> 01:40:28,800
The technology there to clean up oil
spills or something like that. Yeah,

1894
01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:32,670
like you criteria that eats plastic
like that you want it is you create

1895
01:40:32,671 --> 01:40:34,950
incentive by offering these prizes,

1896
01:40:34,951 --> 01:40:37,110
like $10 million prizes
and teams around the world.

1897
01:40:37,110 --> 01:40:40,900
We'll spend $100 million to win a $10
million prize because of the prestige and

1898
01:40:40,901 --> 01:40:44,550
because the legacy or swamp thing
came from for what swamp thing?

1899
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:49,440
Remember the marvel comics swamp thing
from a contest? No, no. From some porn,

1900
01:40:49,441 --> 01:40:53,100
some biological shit to eat up some.
Maybe I'm in fact, I don't know,

1901
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:56,740
maybe it's another example
of that and the x prize.

1902
01:40:56,741 --> 01:40:59,850
They were the ones that did the
$10 million enterprise for space,

1903
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:03,130
which became virgin galactic. Well,
they have one now to create a device.

1904
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:06,100
That's the size of like an
iPhone called the tri quarter.

1905
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:09,940
$10 million to do can make a device
that you can spit on or you can put your

1906
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:14,140
blood on and that will diagnose you
with the equivalent of a 10 certified

1907
01:41:14,141 --> 01:41:17,500
doctors with greater accuracy than
10 certified doctors. I swear to God,

1908
01:41:17,501 --> 01:41:18,940
this is their new condos.
This is her net,

1909
01:41:18,941 --> 01:41:21,250
$2 million per $10 million
prize that they just put out.

1910
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:25,150
It's right tricorder x prize. Is it
possible divorce is going to be possible?

1911
01:41:25,151 --> 01:41:27,670
I mean they're already have things that
you can put on your iPhone that you can

1912
01:41:27,671 --> 01:41:32,110
spit on that we'll like Beshar
your measure and analyze
your watts fluid. Yeah,

1913
01:41:32,230 --> 01:41:36,600
really? Yeah. They already have this
bid on your iPhone shots to it yet.

1914
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,260
What's it called?
I have no idea,

1915
01:41:38,261 --> 01:41:41,620
but people can Google spitting on
your iPhone medical device. Wow.

1916
01:41:41,621 --> 01:41:42,880
I'd never heard of that.
That's amazing.

1917
01:41:42,881 --> 01:41:46,060
That stuff is going to get a lot
faster because now that that biology is

1918
01:41:46,061 --> 01:41:48,970
becoming information technologies
and information technology,

1919
01:41:48,971 --> 01:41:50,180
we're going to see the same progress.
Well,

1920
01:41:50,181 --> 01:41:54,340
it's so cool when you have contests
for good along those lines,

1921
01:41:54,341 --> 01:41:57,250
like with x prize and the fact that they
would come up with something along that.

1922
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,130
Yeah, they're brilliant. Yeah. And
I mean, I would love to believe you,

1923
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:02,590
I believe to believe that someone is going
to eventually figure out a way to get

1924
01:42:02,591 --> 01:42:06,490
rid of that giant patch of garbage
that's in the Pacific Ocean. We shall,

1925
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:10,330
we shall. That's a big issue, huh?
Yeah. Well people talk about that a lot.

1926
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,920
They're very concerned.
Although it's nice.

1927
01:42:11,921 --> 01:42:14,770
It's not actually like the size
of a country as people had.

1928
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:17,110
I think it's the size of
Texas. I don't, I'm not,

1929
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:20,230
I don't think it actually is
physical size of Texas. Well,

1930
01:42:20,231 --> 01:42:24,310
I think that they're so small. No,
I think the, you know how it is,

1931
01:42:24,311 --> 01:42:27,750
it's all caught in the current, there's
like a vortex, a vortex. Really.

1932
01:42:27,770 --> 01:42:30,400
That's where all the garbage piles
up and then all the garbage. Let's,

1933
01:42:30,450 --> 01:42:35,170
I'll look at it right now. Okay. Let me
Google this real quick. Powerful Google,

1934
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:39,820
uh, Pacific Ocean garbage
patch. Pacific Ocean.

1935
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:45,193
Okay.

1936
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:50,940
Oh, it's fucking huge. Holy Shit.

1937
01:42:56,590 --> 01:42:57,423
Wow.

1938
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:02,820
Although many immediate and advocate
advocacy reports have suggested that the

1939
01:43:02,821 --> 01:43:06,690
patch extends over an area
larger than the continental us.

1940
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:10,290
Recent research sponsored by the National
Science Foundation suggest that the

1941
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:14,400
affected area may be twice
the size of Hawaii. Wow.

1942
01:43:15,150 --> 01:43:18,270
Wow. That's fucking big.
But that's a lot of tracks.

1943
01:43:19,470 --> 01:43:20,303
I,

1944
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:25,310
I'm pretty confident that we will create
nano technology that will literally eat

1945
01:43:25,621 --> 01:43:28,850
up the garbage. That's how we'll, that's
how we'll fix it. But then when the,

1946
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:31,830
when it runs out of garbage, 10 it'd be
hungry and then it becomes swamp thing.

1947
01:43:32,510 --> 01:43:34,980
Maybe you don't, it doesn't want to
die, man. It doesn't want to die.

1948
01:43:34,981 --> 01:43:38,550
And that's how you know, like the
premise to a lot of comic book monsters,

1949
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:42,600
it's a double edge sword fight get is we
better come up with a way to kill those

1950
01:43:42,601 --> 01:43:46,320
things before we feed them
plastic. Well, yes. Look,

1951
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:50,880
it's important to look at all the possible
uses of technology for good and for

1952
01:43:50,881 --> 01:43:52,770
bad. Why the conversation
needs to be had though,

1953
01:43:52,771 --> 01:43:55,130
because the progress is not stopping.

1954
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:58,040
When I think if we paint beautiful
pictures of how things could be,

1955
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:01,490
we inspire the people to make sure that
that's what we actually, absolutely.

1956
01:44:01,491 --> 01:44:04,120
I completely agree with you and I think
you know the way you're doing it in

1957
01:44:04,121 --> 01:44:07,070
videos and online, it was really
cool and it's very close buddy. Well,

1958
01:44:07,071 --> 01:44:10,040
the way you're doing it, it is
amazing. But my question to you is,

1959
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:13,460
what if we saw kangaroos evolving?
What if we saw Kangaroos?

1960
01:44:13,490 --> 01:44:16,130
They had found some flour.
There was a psychedelic flower.

1961
01:44:16,131 --> 01:44:18,620
They started eating it and
Kangaroos started building houses,

1962
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:23,330
willing weapons and shit like that.
And some we saw some kangaroos welding,

1963
01:44:23,570 --> 01:44:25,940
we saw some welding. We
would. We allow that shit.

1964
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:29,050
I think we go in and kick the Kangaroos
assets and you'll get the fuck outta

1965
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:33,920
here. Wear your armor. We might, we might
make other animals smarter. Who knows?

1966
01:44:33,921 --> 01:44:37,340
Do you think so we might give them stem.
We'd be battling for resources.

1967
01:44:37,550 --> 01:44:41,630
I think we would just check on.
No, cause I ran out nuclear power.

1968
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:43,850
What if Kangaroos came up
with a new x before I ran?

1969
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:48,860
Would have kangaroos just started fucking
being really super smart man. Yeah.

1970
01:44:48,861 --> 01:44:52,520
Well, but I don't think that the resources
will be an issue because we'll be

1971
01:44:52,521 --> 01:44:55,070
harnessing energy from the whole galaxy.

1972
01:44:55,071 --> 01:44:57,110
There is an infinity of
reasons you say that,

1973
01:44:57,111 --> 01:45:01,490
but what if an asteroid lands in Australia
right near where the Kangaroos are

1974
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:06,520
and some spores from this asteroid contain
a never before seen mushroom rapidly

1975
01:45:06,921 --> 01:45:11,921
accelerates evolution and within like a
hundred years they surpass us and then

1976
01:45:12,081 --> 01:45:15,940
what? Kangaroos are smart enough. What
do you do then Brian? What if, what if?

1977
01:45:15,941 --> 01:45:17,990
What are you going to do? You
Go, you're fucking cat clock.

1978
01:45:18,030 --> 01:45:22,130
I'll create a time machine and take the
words. What if out of the dictionary?

1979
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:25,310
Well then I'm going to take a time when
she didn't take the word like out and

1980
01:45:25,311 --> 01:45:29,420
you won't ever be able to say anything.
What have I have a bitch?

1981
01:45:30,230 --> 01:45:30,650
Listen,

1982
01:45:30,650 --> 01:45:34,000
I believe that you are absolutely
convinced that someone's going to come out

1983
01:45:34,001 --> 01:45:38,750
with us. I just don't know. I see it. I
see it happening, man, and I know this.

1984
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:41,930
Our brains.
What is the current plans to fix this now?

1985
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,880
To fix with garbage patch. So
we were talking about, yeah,

1986
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:48,500
well they're talking about creating
some kind of like algae or bacteria that

1987
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:49,610
eats the plastic.

1988
01:45:49,611 --> 01:45:54,611
I think one of the big guys have a
synthetic biology is Craig venter who also

1989
01:45:54,711 --> 01:45:58,100
spoke at the singularity university
thing and he was seeing in terms of the

1990
01:45:58,101 --> 01:46:03,101
future fuels and the future of like
cleaning up like chemicals and absolutely

1991
01:46:03,531 --> 01:46:06,480
going to be using synthetic
biology. Wow. Yeah.

1992
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:11,270
Cause we can program life to do
whatever we want. You know, so we can,

1993
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:14,360
it's just like we can use
language to describe anything.

1994
01:46:14,361 --> 01:46:16,490
We can just author instructions,
you know?

1995
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:18,770
And here you have software
that writes its own hardware.

1996
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:21,470
See that's the thing about
programmable life. Unlike computers,

1997
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:26,690
you write the code, the code
manufacturer's its own like phenotype,

1998
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:30,800
right? Cause life, the genes
determine its physical attributes.

1999
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:33,860
So the software writes its
own hardware into existence.

2000
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:36,980
That's what's really exciting about like
synthetic biology and programmable life.

2001
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:38,360
Especially if he gives synthetic.

2002
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:42,260
Like if you give some
artificial intelligence access
to three d computers and

2003
01:46:42,261 --> 01:46:44,590
three d printers, dude, absolutely God,

2004
01:46:44,591 --> 01:46:48,530
you're going to imagine Raisie unlimited
intelligence and eliminate intelligence.

2005
01:46:48,531 --> 01:46:51,030
It replicates itself and three d printers,

2006
01:46:51,450 --> 01:46:55,080
but just the concept of three d
printers, having it aware of, oh,

2007
01:46:55,081 --> 01:46:59,670
now I can improve upon this design of
three d printers with trillions of time,

2008
01:46:59,671 --> 01:47:02,850
more ram than our brains, and
instantaneously, well, you know what,

2009
01:47:02,851 --> 01:47:06,390
Henry Miller's like 10,000 years of
progress and we need to believe that it's

2010
01:47:06,391 --> 01:47:07,980
coming.
Then Henry Miller said,

2011
01:47:07,981 --> 01:47:11,760
the day that men ceased to believe
that they will one day become gods,

2012
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:15,990
then they will surely become worms.
Wow.

2013
01:47:16,410 --> 01:47:20,220
That was Henry Miller. So he
says, believe mankind, you know,

2014
01:47:20,221 --> 01:47:22,620
for going from ape to superman,
you know,

2015
01:47:22,621 --> 01:47:26,270
smack in the middle in a trajectory
between the born and the made. Right.

2016
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:29,790
That's where we are, man. Yeah, we were,
yeah. We're in this word is in the middle.

2017
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:33,600
Yeah. When there's this weird stage
where we're sort of conscious and we're,

2018
01:47:33,601 --> 01:47:38,070
we're aware, animalistic and
cellist, weird and savage,

2019
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:38,790
Horny,

2020
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:42,150
we're going to turn ourselves into the
most beautiful artwork we've ever made.

2021
01:47:42,151 --> 01:47:43,320
Men,
you really think so?

2022
01:47:43,321 --> 01:47:47,130
I definitely the aliens land
first or the aliens I had first.

2023
01:47:47,150 --> 01:47:50,070
So you don't believe that society's
ever gets to the point where they travel

2024
01:47:50,071 --> 01:47:53,400
from one place to another land and
affect things that doesn't? No,

2025
01:47:53,401 --> 01:47:54,420
I think that they do.

2026
01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:58,080
But the transection hypothesis says that
by the time maybe they reached the edge

2027
01:47:58,081 --> 01:48:00,120
of the solar system where the
edge of the galaxy at that point,

2028
01:48:00,270 --> 01:48:03,790
all the density goes back and it
goes into words, into the Nano scale.

2029
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:04,890
So it's Kinda like we,

2030
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:09,150
the complexity goes into itself and
goes and makes it a black hole and

2031
01:48:09,151 --> 01:48:10,620
disappears from the visible universe.

2032
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:13,480
Is it possible that we should look at
the trend section hypothesis because,

2033
01:48:13,481 --> 01:48:15,210
cause it'll probably explain
much better than I can,

2034
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:18,240
but isn't it possible that what you're
dealing with is something that's here all

2035
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:19,770
the time,
but it's in another dimension?

2036
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:22,470
Is it possible for dimension
string theory? Yeah.

2037
01:48:22,471 --> 01:48:25,220
I mean that is addressed in
that article. Yeah. Yeah.

2038
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:27,360
So you could even go back
to Mckenna and say, oh,

2039
01:48:27,361 --> 01:48:30,060
so when Mckenna talks about hyper
dimensional beings and then uh,

2040
01:48:30,330 --> 01:48:33,570
well the transection hypothesis
says essentially our minds, yes.

2041
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:36,750
Will break through the visible
universe into other dimensions.

2042
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:41,190
It's like crazy stuff except it's
like written by an academic scholar.

2043
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:47,040
Wow. Yeah. So no aliens and flying
saucers. Just landing. Yeah, that's,

2044
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:49,560
that's what he says. He says, well
yeah, we'll go to other planets.

2045
01:48:49,561 --> 01:48:52,890
But that's like early stage stuff like
going to other planets over the next like

2046
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:57,750
50 years earlier to get invaded were
essentially invaded by young punks that

2047
01:48:57,950 --> 01:49:02,190
the, the really high level aliens
wouldn't bother. It fails. Right. Totally.

2048
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:06,210
You know, every time we do
that, the microphone picks
it up. Sorry man. It's fine.

2049
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:09,300
It's good. But you know, someone's
going to be upset. I just,

2050
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:11,490
I'm sensitive because people always
complain. I used to chew gum.

2051
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:15,180
You can't shoot Mike Anymore. People
are like, dude, you're fucking sipping.

2052
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:18,810
Can't sip drinks.
If you get up here and people get mad.

2053
01:49:19,530 --> 01:49:22,530
I guess if you got to think of as
somebody that's the reason why we put

2054
01:49:22,531 --> 01:49:24,750
headphones on and liquid
easily to his conversation.

2055
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:28,560
But if you were in the gym right now,
you would hear that. I'm sorry Jim,

2056
01:49:28,561 --> 01:49:32,560
go please. Sorry. Sorry everybody. Just
wanting to keep everybody happy. Um,

2057
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:34,820
I mean this is all incredible stuff and I,

2058
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:37,800
I guess it all could come true and,

2059
01:49:37,801 --> 01:49:42,090
and come to fruition as long as we don't
fuck it up or as long as some gigantic

2060
01:49:42,091 --> 01:49:45,750
natural disaster doesn't happen
as well. Right? Yes. You take any,

2061
01:49:46,650 --> 01:49:48,190
do you ever take any care

2062
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:51,760
and consideration? Well, yeah, I mean
that's super volcanoes, shit like that.

2063
01:49:51,790 --> 01:49:52,511
I think,
look,

2064
01:49:52,511 --> 01:49:56,260
we have to be paying attention and we
have to be cautious and we have to be

2065
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:01,240
vigilant as we transitioned towards what
promises to be the most exciting time

2066
01:50:01,241 --> 01:50:02,500
in human history.
I mean,

2067
01:50:02,501 --> 01:50:04,690
we're already living in the most
exciting time in human history,

2068
01:50:04,691 --> 01:50:06,550
but let's not lose focus,
you know,

2069
01:50:06,551 --> 01:50:09,640
like let's address the grand
challenges of humanity.

2070
01:50:09,641 --> 01:50:12,940
We've never had such
tools with which to do so.

2071
01:50:13,270 --> 01:50:17,380
And I think it's like an opportunity
for us to pull our mental cognitive

2072
01:50:17,381 --> 01:50:21,130
surpluses together and fix
shit. Yeah, absolutely.

2073
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:25,450
Do you think we'll ever get to the point
where we can avoid asteroids? Sure.

2074
01:50:25,630 --> 01:50:29,340
You think so? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
We'll get shoot them down.

2075
01:50:29,341 --> 01:50:32,890
You think shinning down with
lasers, single laser will
blow it up. It's going to,

2076
01:50:32,891 --> 01:50:34,600
everything is turning into star wars.
Yeah.

2077
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:36,000
You really think the animal will do that.

2078
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:38,100
Don't mean some asteroids are miles wide.
We get,

2079
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:40,120
we already have lasers
that are pretty powerful.

2080
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:43,770
I mean send nuclear weapons to them
like in the movie sunshine. Well,

2081
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:47,380
the issue with that is actually that that
makes it worse because what happens is

2082
01:50:47,381 --> 01:50:51,070
instead of one big impact who have
hundreds of thousands of a little ones,

2083
01:50:51,370 --> 01:50:52,720
well they're not even little.
You know,

2084
01:50:52,721 --> 01:50:56,500
you don't need anything that big tech
giant crater in Nevada. You know,

2085
01:50:56,501 --> 01:50:58,420
it's one of the weird things
about all planets. Me,

2086
01:50:58,421 --> 01:51:01,920
every plan will be find is littered
with impacts. You know, we're,

2087
01:51:01,930 --> 01:51:05,360
we live in a very volatile source
system where we've been inhabiting a

2088
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:08,710
goldilocks space for the Goldie locks.
At a time and we've just been very,

2089
01:51:08,711 --> 01:51:10,960
very lucky. Like I said, all
we were talking about this,

2090
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:13,630
all of our progress man is a
blink of a blink of a blink,

2091
01:51:13,631 --> 01:51:17,440
of a blink of a blink in terms of cosmic
time. So it's like, it's not that we,

2092
01:51:17,441 --> 01:51:20,910
I mean we're lucky. Yeah. But it hasn't
been that much time that has passed,

2093
01:51:20,911 --> 01:51:23,850
you know, give it a couple
of million years and the
inevitability of getting hit,

2094
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:27,070
it's coming. But that's why we got to
progress so that we can thwart that. Well,

2095
01:51:27,071 --> 01:51:29,980
they just found a very
recent evidence of an impact,

2096
01:51:29,981 --> 01:51:31,750
a big one about 13,000 years ago.

2097
01:51:32,290 --> 01:51:35,490
And what's really fascinating
about that is all the, uh,

2098
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:39,790
ancient history theorists all point to
that point in time is one being the end

2099
01:51:39,791 --> 01:51:42,580
of the ice age, like around that
time, the end of the pleistocene.

2100
01:51:42,581 --> 01:51:47,581
And also also that's when a lot of people
point to the possibility of like an

2101
01:51:48,371 --> 01:51:51,880
ancient civilization like Egypt falling
apart and then rebuilding in the same

2102
01:51:51,881 --> 01:51:53,320
area. Sure, sure, sure,
sure. Yeah. When they,

2103
01:51:53,321 --> 01:51:56,830
when they hypothesize that something
went wrong, it's always around 10,000,

2104
01:51:56,831 --> 01:52:00,270
12,000, 13,000, somewhere around there.
I like, you know, the cycles. Yeah.

2105
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:03,700
Well the idea is that, you
know, human life on this planet,

2106
01:52:03,701 --> 01:52:07,840
like the reason why there's
the myth of Atlantis and the
myth of, uh, you know, uh,

2107
01:52:07,870 --> 01:52:12,310
Noah in the Ark and the epic of
Gilgamesh is that there's all these giant

2108
01:52:12,311 --> 01:52:16,540
disasters just that frequently
hit, you know, and you know,

2109
01:52:16,570 --> 01:52:21,310
if something hit us today and wiped out,
we're wired to look for danger, man.

2110
01:52:21,311 --> 01:52:22,700
Sure.
The only way we survive.

2111
01:52:22,701 --> 01:52:27,130
So cautionary tales embedded in our
culture are just alarm system. Sure.

2112
01:52:27,330 --> 01:52:29,170
And it's kind of in a race.
I mean,

2113
01:52:29,171 --> 01:52:32,080
it's kind of a race between
technology awareness,

2114
01:52:32,081 --> 01:52:37,081
progress and the ability to at least
predict and prepare a slightly for natural

2115
01:52:38,441 --> 01:52:42,520
disasters. But some of them like Caldera,
volcanoes and things along those lines,

2116
01:52:42,521 --> 01:52:45,860
this is not need to do, man. It was just
nothing you could do. When goes it goes.

2117
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:48,560
Unless you can figure out a way
to throw some ice cubes on the,

2118
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:53,670
on the lava and maybe keep it from
fucking blowing sky high, no technologies.

2119
01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:57,890
The only way I think that
could be addressed, you
know, that's, that's, that's,

2120
01:52:57,891 --> 01:52:59,690
that really is the craziest technology.

2121
01:52:59,691 --> 01:53:02,060
I mean self replicating
things in an ANA scale.

2122
01:53:02,061 --> 01:53:05,060
It's like be mad that you'd be able to
throw those into the lava and they would

2123
01:53:05,061 --> 01:53:07,380
somehow or another crowd bill
everybody the fuck out. Yeah.

2124
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:10,930
Change the structure of the
molecular structure of the lava.

2125
01:53:10,931 --> 01:53:14,180
I don't know if that fuck it freezes up
the planet and turns us into another ice

2126
01:53:14,181 --> 01:53:16,760
age. Jesus Christ. Jason, Jason
Silva. What are you doing?

2127
01:53:16,761 --> 01:53:21,580
The Butterfly effect issue is always,
yeah, it is. We don't care. Well,

2128
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:25,730
no, it will have super computers that
can map out every possible possibility.

2129
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:29,180
Trillions of times more than we can map
out different scenarios in our heads so

2130
01:53:29,181 --> 01:53:31,490
those ais will be able to
pick the best scenario.

2131
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:33,740
They'll make mathematical
projection. There'll be like, okay,

2132
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:37,100
there's a billion in one probabilities
of, and Annette, this is the best one.

2133
01:53:37,101 --> 01:53:37,670
Let's do it.

2134
01:53:37,670 --> 01:53:41,570
You spend so much time thinking about
the future and thinking about all these

2135
01:53:41,571 --> 01:53:45,830
possibilities. Is it, is it possible that
when you do this, or is it a difficult,

2136
01:53:45,831 --> 01:53:50,810
when you do this not to, not to ignore
the present? Is it hard to, you know,

2137
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:51,291
is it like,

2138
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:54,200
is it like a sort of a normal thing to
sort of ignore the present while you're

2139
01:53:54,201 --> 01:53:58,300
concentrating it entirely
on what the human race is
going to accomplish it? Well,

2140
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:01,010
well I think that, you know how they
say that was phrase that very well,

2141
01:54:01,011 --> 01:54:03,200
but you know, no, no, I
think you know how they did,

2142
01:54:03,201 --> 01:54:05,510
we always talk about how
human beings need a purpose.

2143
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:10,160
Purpose by its very nature implies
a reason to look forward, right?

2144
01:54:10,190 --> 01:54:13,190
So we can't help but look to the future.
It's what we do.

2145
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:15,610
So your purpose is to create a purpose in,

2146
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:17,930
to put the idea of purpose into people's,

2147
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:22,280
gives me a sense of purpose is a
collective feeling that like, wow,

2148
01:54:22,281 --> 01:54:27,281
humanity has this unique opportunity
to sort of map it's road beautifully.

2149
01:54:28,461 --> 01:54:31,070
And we all have a way of
participating in that.

2150
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:33,890
And what a wonderful sense of
collective purpose. It's just,

2151
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:37,700
it's more interesting to me than like, oh,
well my purpose is to become, you know,

2152
01:54:37,701 --> 01:54:39,980
or get this job or do this
thing. It's like, yeah,

2153
01:54:39,981 --> 01:54:42,350
I want to get this job into this things
just like everybody else because I want

2154
01:54:42,351 --> 01:54:46,080
to survive, but I'm in the mood for
cosmic purpose. Cosmic significance.

2155
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:47,870
Your cosmic dig slinger,

2156
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:52,520
did I say they say it's the same reason
that religion always appealed to people

2157
01:54:52,521 --> 01:54:56,180
for the same reason that man can live for
a few, you know, few weeks without food,

2158
01:54:56,181 --> 01:54:58,940
a few days without water,
but not for a second without hope.

2159
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:02,150
It's just the human condition.
You know, the minute we lose hope,

2160
01:55:02,151 --> 01:55:04,400
we commit suicide.
Not The minute.

2161
01:55:04,550 --> 01:55:07,940
Sometimes you can really suffer
for years before you pull the plug,

2162
01:55:07,941 --> 01:55:09,620
but when you lose complete hope,

2163
01:55:09,621 --> 01:55:12,530
you won't even wait around
if you're waiting around it
because you have a little

2164
01:55:12,531 --> 01:55:15,440
bit of thing of thinking that it
thinks might turn around. Yeah,

2165
01:55:15,441 --> 01:55:18,990
I think it's important. I
think it's important to to
look forward. I think it's,

2166
01:55:18,991 --> 01:55:19,791
it's huge.

2167
01:55:19,791 --> 01:55:23,600
I think it's the only thing that propels
our progress anyway because if we were

2168
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:27,950
in a stupefied Lowell staying in the
present, we wouldn't do anything.

2169
01:55:30,050 --> 01:55:34,130
Yeah, of course. Um, what do you
see happening in your lifetime?

2170
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:37,280
I mean we are right now in
2012 this was supposed to be,

2171
01:55:37,281 --> 01:55:40,820
if you're paying attention to time wave
zero novelty theory to supposed to be

2172
01:55:40,821 --> 01:55:43,590
wearing when the shit hits the fan.
When you on have found recently,

2173
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,440
I've talked about this recently,
but I wanted to bring it up with you,

2174
01:55:46,441 --> 01:55:47,850
cause I know you're a mckenna fan as well.

2175
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:52,980
He altered the end date to coincide
with the end date of the Mayan calendar.

2176
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:53,731
Yeah.

2177
01:55:53,731 --> 01:55:58,731
Maybe he was a of the people that believe
that by creating a social movement

2178
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:02,350
around these ideas, you more quickly
actualize those ideas. People were,

2179
01:56:02,351 --> 01:56:03,780
so you cited me for bringing this up,

2180
01:56:03,781 --> 01:56:06,350
but somebody had posted it on my message
board and then I went and read and he

2181
01:56:06,370 --> 01:56:09,810
apparently his initial
calculations was November,

2182
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:14,460
November of 2012 to December, moved to
December 21st which is the, you know,

2183
01:56:14,461 --> 01:56:16,950
the end date of long count. But then
somebody brought up the other day,

2184
01:56:16,951 --> 01:56:20,040
there was like a Internet
meme going around where, you
know, calculate leap years,

2185
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,450
did the Mayans calculate leap peers?
Cause if they didn't,

2186
01:56:22,451 --> 01:56:26,620
we know that all this shit all happened
700 years ago. Oh yeah. I mean I,

2187
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:30,300
the specifics,
I have no idea what the sciences,

2188
01:56:30,301 --> 01:56:35,160
but I think what's interesting is that
if you create a viral swell 10 times the

2189
01:56:35,161 --> 01:56:40,161
scale of the Joseph Kony video with some
beautifully produced message about how

2190
01:56:40,231 --> 01:56:44,760
mankind is using technology to create
a global brain and it addressed the

2191
01:56:44,761 --> 01:56:49,761
problems of humanity and it's seen by a
billion people by December on Youtube,

2192
01:56:50,010 --> 01:56:54,300
then the idea becomes reality. Because
this is what we've been talking about.

2193
01:56:54,301 --> 01:56:57,270
You know, ideas are just as real
as the neurons that they inhabit.

2194
01:56:57,271 --> 01:56:58,890
So that's what's crazy.

2195
01:56:58,891 --> 01:57:03,180
It's a self fulfilling
propers Joseph Kony video.

2196
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:06,900
We talked about this, but I remember
when it hit Twitter, when I saw it,

2197
01:57:07,110 --> 01:57:10,410
when I saw it starting to appear in
my timeline, I started thinking, wow,

2198
01:57:10,411 --> 01:57:12,120
what's going to happen here?
Like this is,

2199
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:17,250
this seems like a very orchestrated
campaign and the idea to make a a terrible

2200
01:57:17,251 --> 01:57:21,750
person, very famous so that he's,
he's a target of five more. Yeah.

2201
01:57:21,950 --> 01:57:24,350
What a genius idea. Geez. And you know,

2202
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:28,170
that really is just sort of tapping
into potential tapping into which no one

2203
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:32,700
else has done before. No one else has ever
done that about a terrible person. No,

2204
01:57:32,701 --> 01:57:37,480
no. It's very, yeah, it's interesting.
So interesting. It's brilliant. Yeah.

2205
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:37,891
And it just,

2206
01:57:37,891 --> 01:57:42,891
the use of media and understanding its
power and applying it for savvy social

2207
01:57:43,351 --> 01:57:45,300
impact. What are the
criticisms of this Kony video?

2208
01:57:45,301 --> 01:57:48,170
Cause I know there's a few
of the criticism I think
has to do specifically with,

2209
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:52,920
with with the nonprofit operations
tales. But look again, that's something,

2210
01:57:52,921 --> 01:57:54,500
that's a whole other
conversation and we're in it.

2211
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:55,800
We're not experts and
we don't know the facts.

2212
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:57,860
But I think what's interesting is
what they've made with the video,

2213
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:01,860
what that video means about the future
of how messages get spread that we were

2214
01:58:01,861 --> 01:58:05,490
seeing. We all realized, we all know
where we were when the Kony video hit.

2215
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:08,370
It's one of those things where it's like
something has changed here and we're

2216
01:58:08,371 --> 01:58:12,830
all aware that, okay this is, this is
a new paradigm. It's a paradigm shift,

2217
01:58:13,170 --> 01:58:15,720
not even a paradigm shift. You know
what's really fascinating is Obama,

2218
01:58:15,721 --> 01:58:19,590
the Obama campaign is releasing. There's,
this is where they're so social media,

2219
01:58:19,591 --> 01:58:22,110
brilliant savvy. They understand
aesthetics in their campaign.

2220
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:27,390
They had the director of an inconvenient
truth is about to release a documentary.

2221
01:58:27,450 --> 01:58:32,450
So like a well made film about Obama
and that's going to be part of their

2222
01:58:33,091 --> 01:58:35,820
campaign media materials.
So instead of like an ad,

2223
01:58:35,821 --> 01:58:38,310
like a normal attack ad like
the other guys are doing,

2224
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:42,010
and these guys are releasing a film
made by a talented film maker. I mean

2225
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:46,540
the brilliance of that, that's probably
going to go ridiculously viral.

2226
01:58:46,541 --> 01:58:48,280
That's the best campaign video
you could have ever done.

2227
01:58:48,281 --> 01:58:50,080
What is that going to come out?
I don't know the dates,

2228
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:52,930
but people should Google the WHO knew
about whenever it's just a trailer.

2229
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:54,910
I wonder if it's gonna
be free or like Louis Ck.

2230
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:58,240
I wonder if it's going to be like a Kim
Kardashian reality TV show where you

2231
01:58:58,241 --> 01:59:01,370
know that they've created artificial
scenarios to move the plot along. Yeah.

2232
01:59:01,390 --> 01:59:06,190
Like Obama is Obama. We got
you at a carwash now. What?
It was like Mexican food.

2233
01:59:06,191 --> 01:59:10,120
I don't want Mexican food.
Now you're going to be washing the car.

2234
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:13,500
Imagine if they actually did it. They
produce it like a reality show. Yeah.

2235
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:16,270
What's happened is the most ridiculous
shit ever. I haven't seen it.

2236
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:17,440
I wonder what it's going to be.

2237
01:59:17,470 --> 01:59:20,410
Something tells me it's going to be a
well made film with beautiful music and

2238
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:24,340
well, it'd be nice to see him
talk outside of that fake sort of,

2239
01:59:24,630 --> 01:59:26,640
I'm giving a speech voice.
Yeah, exactly. You know,

2240
01:59:26,710 --> 01:59:29,280
she'd be like a documentary that followed
him and you get behind the scenes.

2241
01:59:29,310 --> 01:59:30,010
All the fake,

2242
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:33,940
I'm giving a speech voice is very
disturbing because it's too smooth.

2243
01:59:33,941 --> 01:59:37,400
It's not real. It's too polished.
It's not. It's not. You know,

2244
01:59:37,450 --> 01:59:42,160
I know it's prepared and beaten down to,
I don't want that out of a leader.

2245
01:59:42,390 --> 01:59:44,440
You know what I want out
of a leader is I want,

2246
01:59:44,470 --> 01:59:48,090
I want to know that this is who
this is you. This isn't, um,

2247
01:59:48,130 --> 01:59:49,540
being a strip club Dj.

2248
01:59:49,690 --> 01:59:53,500
This isn't on the am morning
Chi on the zoo coming up next.

2249
01:59:53,501 --> 01:59:54,880
The same fucking voice.

2250
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:58,810
When you hear a man give
a speech and you know the,

2251
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:03,130
there's that way of talking. That is
so God damn fake. It should be illegal.

2252
02:00:03,490 --> 02:00:07,930
They shouldn't be able to stop you from
making campaigns in speeches and stop

2253
02:00:07,931 --> 02:00:10,600
you and go. You can't talk like
that. It'll be interesting to see,

2254
02:00:10,601 --> 02:00:13,540
to see how it comes across. And
speaking of, of politicians,

2255
02:00:13,541 --> 02:00:17,710
they just see the HBO movie
about a Game Change. What is it?

2256
02:00:17,770 --> 02:00:21,100
What's game chats about the Mccain?
Oh,

2257
02:00:21,101 --> 02:00:24,090
about Sarah Palin when he picked his
writing man watching the more Sarah Palin.

2258
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:27,230
Well it's Julianne Moore was so
good in it. Dude. It's pretty hot.

2259
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:28,970
She looks just like her.
Yeah.

2260
02:00:29,110 --> 02:00:34,110
But like the film is so upsetting and
really well cause it shows you the theater

2261
02:00:35,201 --> 02:00:39,010
of what a lot of politics
has become obsolete. It is.

2262
02:00:39,011 --> 02:00:42,180
And how accurate is it accurate?
The conversations,

2263
02:00:42,190 --> 02:00:44,970
I mean it's all been doctored up for
fucking dramatic effect. You know,

2264
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:49,180
you need to see a man, I think
you still get the message,

2265
02:00:49,181 --> 02:00:54,181
you still get the idea of the reasons
that she was put there and her lack of

2266
02:00:54,191 --> 02:00:57,370
experience and well that became
painfully obvious. Right.

2267
02:00:57,400 --> 02:01:01,300
But here it's presented in a, the way it
would be like a film scholar, you know,

2268
02:01:01,301 --> 02:01:06,300
explaining something to you guys. It
just illustrates how wonky the system is.

2269
02:01:06,301 --> 02:01:09,730
And that could even be an option or
how could that be an option? Exactly.

2270
02:01:10,190 --> 02:01:14,050
[inaudible] would allow
that. Well, you know,

2271
02:01:14,051 --> 02:01:17,770
it's what I've always said is the real
problem is that there's really fucking

2272
02:01:17,771 --> 02:01:21,190
dumb people out there, a lot of
them. And they get to vote too.

2273
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:24,370
And the problem with dumb people
as they don't know, they're dumb.

2274
02:01:24,850 --> 02:01:28,570
So when they see someone like Sarah Pailin
who may not be the smartest person in

2275
02:01:28,571 --> 02:01:31,060
the world,
but she's way smarter than them,

2276
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:35,710
they can't distinguish between her and
Stephen Hawking's. When Neil Tyson speaks,

2277
02:01:35,740 --> 02:01:39,710
he sounds just as brilliant as Sarah
Pailin because they're both way out of

2278
02:01:39,711 --> 02:01:42,770
their fucking league. Most people can
barely string together a sentence.

2279
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:47,120
And so these are the people that came
to her cause she represents simplicity.

2280
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:51,650
She represents, I think today with
old fashion things and hunting,

2281
02:01:51,651 --> 02:01:56,210
well she's family cause safe danger
with her. She's dangerous. But because,

2282
02:01:56,211 --> 02:02:00,350
but she's also familiar. So
maybe that's why, but like fuck,

2283
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:02,660
I feel like today man,
if you have access to the internet,

2284
02:02:02,661 --> 02:02:04,790
you have no excuse not
to be on Khan Academy.

2285
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:06,770
You have no excuse not
to be watching Ted talks.

2286
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:09,440
You have no excuse not to saturate
your brain with knowledge.

2287
02:02:09,441 --> 02:02:12,770
Like it's not like there's no books around
like the every book that's ever been

2288
02:02:12,771 --> 02:02:15,170
written is an internet click way.

2289
02:02:15,171 --> 02:02:19,040
And I feel like ignorance
is inexcusable these days.

2290
02:02:19,041 --> 02:02:23,090
If you have an internet connection.
So it's kind of like a, I don't know,

2291
02:02:23,091 --> 02:02:25,610
like it feels like the, you
know, the tools are there,

2292
02:02:25,611 --> 02:02:26,780
but it's up to us how we use them.

2293
02:02:26,781 --> 02:02:28,880
It's going back to the same
message and I think people really,

2294
02:02:28,881 --> 02:02:31,880
they need to need to get on this,
right? They need to get on this.

2295
02:02:31,970 --> 02:02:34,520
The representative government
ideas gotta go, that's,

2296
02:02:34,530 --> 02:02:38,390
that's not necessary anymore. We can all
instantly communicate with the, you know,

2297
02:02:38,391 --> 02:02:42,890
the government. We can instantly decide
what, what we agree with. We can,

2298
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:43,940
we can have our voices heard.

2299
02:02:43,950 --> 02:02:46,650
The idea that we have senators
and congressmen or the other,

2300
02:02:46,651 --> 02:02:49,370
and they're in this position where they
get to vote for their district shop.

2301
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:52,920
A fascinating idea. Yeah, that's a
ridiculous idea. That's not even that,

2302
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:57,080
that's not, see everybody looks at it
at democracy as if like you get a say,

2303
02:02:57,081 --> 02:03:01,760
you get to vote, but you don't get to
say shit. You get a say in who you pick,

2304
02:03:01,761 --> 02:03:05,180
who gets you in a position. But
democracy needs to come online, man.

2305
02:03:05,181 --> 02:03:07,580
Like the whole hundred
percent needs to be revamped.

2306
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:10,430
They need to throw out all
representations, sores.

2307
02:03:10,431 --> 02:03:14,660
The Internet needs to be voted on new
constitutional amendment and they should

2308
02:03:14,661 --> 02:03:18,630
people who have jobs, but those jobs
are to carry out the will of the people,

2309
02:03:18,860 --> 02:03:21,860
not to represent the totem pole.
The people can represent themselves.

2310
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:25,610
When is somebody going to make a Joseph
Kony style video about legalizing

2311
02:03:25,611 --> 02:03:27,080
marijuana?
And if people say,

2312
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:31,130
click here and play this to say
yes and if it gets a billion views,

2313
02:03:31,131 --> 02:03:34,340
they'll have to legalize. It could
already see just Google the union man.

2314
02:03:34,341 --> 02:03:37,280
Go Watch the movie of the Union,
the business behind getting high.

2315
02:03:37,281 --> 02:03:41,840
It's a documentary that I was involved in,
the my friend Adam score you produced.

2316
02:03:41,841 --> 02:03:43,040
It was like,
I don't know,

2317
02:03:43,041 --> 02:03:45,580
it was like four or five years
ago at least that we did this.

2318
02:03:45,581 --> 02:03:47,710
So one of the best documentaries on the,

2319
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:51,410
the reality behind the illegalization
of marijuana and the reality behind how

2320
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:54,530
how big of a businesses and how
many fucking people use it. Dude,

2321
02:03:54,531 --> 02:03:59,531
I have done my family that benefit from
its medicinal medicinal use and they've

2322
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:02,660
benefited immensely.
It's been like a miracle for my aunt.

2323
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:05,840
It's one of those plants,
one of those substances,

2324
02:04:05,841 --> 02:04:10,430
one of those elements of our culture
and society that if you were,

2325
02:04:10,431 --> 02:04:13,160
again, if you were looking
at life as a work of fiction,

2326
02:04:13,310 --> 02:04:17,480
if life was a movie and there was a some
plant in the movie that was incredibly

2327
02:04:17,481 --> 02:04:19,750
beneficial,
not just to the culture,

2328
02:04:19,780 --> 02:04:24,780
not just to instilling a
sense of camaraderie and
people not just to fort making

2329
02:04:25,011 --> 02:04:28,640
you inquisitive, main, uh, a turbo
charger for your imagination,

2330
02:04:28,641 --> 02:04:31,130
making sex feel better,
not just all of these things,

2331
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:34,760
but then it creates a superior fiber
that you can make clothes out of.

2332
02:04:34,761 --> 02:04:36,290
It's way more horrible than cotton.

2333
02:04:36,430 --> 02:04:40,310
It makes a much more superior paper and
you could put it in an area, in a can,

2334
02:04:40,450 --> 02:04:42,840
in four months.
It can be ready to process.

2335
02:04:42,841 --> 02:04:45,540
Whereas it takes fucking years
to grow trees in the same area.

2336
02:04:45,690 --> 02:04:50,580
Plus it outproduces the trees in the same
acreage by something like four to one.

2337
02:04:50,730 --> 02:04:54,870
I mean, it's amazing. It has the
amino acids that you can live off of.

2338
02:04:54,871 --> 02:04:57,480
You can use it to make
fuel. You can make him, boy,

2339
02:04:57,960 --> 02:04:59,780
it becomes preposterous busters.

2340
02:04:59,781 --> 02:05:04,230
But imagine a video that's slickly
produced that the Kony video that gets a

2341
02:05:04,231 --> 02:05:08,610
billion views. Let's do it. Let's do
it. You and me do those 10 minutes.

2342
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:13,710
Did you get your specialty? We'll
pump it up on new bill in California,

2343
02:05:13,730 --> 02:05:18,270
a Dui bill that they're going
to make it a zero tolerance Dui.

2344
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:21,730
If you have any weed in your system
or in a marijuana and marijuana, he's,

2345
02:05:21,731 --> 02:05:24,220
he stays in your system does six weeks.
How could they do it?

2346
02:05:24,250 --> 02:05:27,030
That's like saying punishing you for
being drunk two days ago and it would

2347
02:05:27,031 --> 02:05:30,140
pretty much make anyone that smokes weed.
Well that's silly. They don't have to,

2348
02:05:30,150 --> 02:05:32,760
they're not going to pick it up to get
a urine test from you and they wouldn't

2349
02:05:32,761 --> 02:05:36,540
know what they would be allowed
to do if they pull you over. Oh,

2350
02:05:36,541 --> 02:05:38,730
that's so ridiculous. That's,
you know, the, the real,

2351
02:05:38,731 --> 02:05:42,030
the real problem with that as a
science is not the same. It doesn't,

2352
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:45,480
the marijuana does not treat people or
it doesn't affect people the same way

2353
02:05:45,481 --> 02:05:46,530
that alcohol does,
period.

2354
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:48,810
I'm not saying you should go out
and get high and drive around,

2355
02:05:48,930 --> 02:05:51,930
but I'm saying some people can drive
high and they're fine and that is a fact,

2356
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:52,501
you know,

2357
02:05:52,501 --> 02:05:56,220
and you might not want to address it
because it seems like it's a taboo subject

2358
02:05:56,221 --> 02:05:59,310
and you know when people want to dance
around it, it is not getting drunk.

2359
02:05:59,311 --> 02:06:03,390
Getting drunk is something that really
severely impairs your ability to operate

2360
02:06:03,391 --> 02:06:07,140
machines that your ability to walk your
niche and are very different things.

2361
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:09,090
Very, very, very different.

2362
02:06:09,490 --> 02:06:12,200
It's not a good idea to be in any altered
state of consciousness while you're

2363
02:06:12,210 --> 02:06:14,520
responsible for others. That's
all we get. The self driving cars.

2364
02:06:14,521 --> 02:06:18,150
That's why the Google self driving cars
are so perfectly baked as fucking a

2365
02:06:18,151 --> 02:06:21,720
Google car. Google car could be
Cheech and Chong to the Max. Yes.

2366
02:06:21,750 --> 02:06:26,100
Completely filled with smoke. So they
open up those side going door. Shoot,

2367
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:29,550
everybody gets driving time. Yes,
and it'll be the self driving car.

2368
02:06:29,551 --> 02:06:33,360
It's perfectly safe. The computer
does, it doesn't get high, dude.

2369
02:06:33,361 --> 02:06:34,860
You're a Google fanboy a little bit,
right.

2370
02:06:35,730 --> 02:06:38,850
I'm kind of a fan of anybody who's pushing
the boundaries of the possible does.

2371
02:06:38,851 --> 02:06:43,560
Of course I'm a Google fanboy.
Yes, I'm lycos all the way. Whoa,

2372
02:06:43,561 --> 02:06:46,620
Bro. I'm Netflix. Netflix or no, no, no.

2373
02:06:48,230 --> 02:06:53,070
What was the other one? Net. No, Netscape.
That's it. Number. Netscape. Netscape.

2374
02:06:53,070 --> 02:06:57,660
Search. Search. Yeah. There was
like a search part of it, I think.

2375
02:06:57,810 --> 02:06:59,870
Does that make sense? I thought
it was always a browser. I didn't,

2376
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:03,520
well there was the blue of the earliest
search engines before Google. There was,

2377
02:07:03,610 --> 02:07:06,480
that wasn't the first search engines.

2378
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:11,750
I remember Alta Vista Vista hype.
I don't remember.

2379
02:07:11,930 --> 02:07:14,140
Light goes,
I remember liking this then.

2380
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:17,220
So how did those go away and how
did Google just stormed the beach?

2381
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:21,240
How invaded man innovative?
It is like natural selection.

2382
02:07:21,241 --> 02:07:23,700
It's like winning
because winning the game,

2383
02:07:23,730 --> 02:07:27,800
Microsoft is trying so hard with this
whole big thing. First of all, why being,

2384
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:31,020
what does that mean? What do
you say? It's Google, bing.

2385
02:07:33,460 --> 02:07:36,130
It's probably the second best
one. It's pretty good. But

2386
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:39,310
why being, why call it being,
why is it Google? Why is Google?

2387
02:07:39,311 --> 02:07:42,370
Because Google is a number, dude.
It's a very cool number. Actually.

2388
02:07:42,371 --> 02:07:43,690
I already know about it until recently.

2389
02:07:43,691 --> 02:07:46,110
That's like a term for like
a gigantic like twill. Yeah.

2390
02:07:46,111 --> 02:07:49,690
There's like a million zeros or some shit.
Well, let's, let's find out what it is.

2391
02:07:49,691 --> 02:07:52,570
What is it? Google here because
we'll, we should, uh, foreign people.

2392
02:07:53,950 --> 02:07:57,400
It comes from another term. It doesn't,
I don't believe that the word is Google.

2393
02:07:57,401 --> 02:08:00,880
It's a, it's a preview
of a term. Yeah. Google.

2394
02:08:00,881 --> 02:08:04,210
It's G. O. G. O. L. Yeah.

2395
02:08:05,170 --> 02:08:09,580
And it is. Holy Shit. How
many, oh my God. 100 zeroes.

2396
02:08:09,730 --> 02:08:14,230
It is the, wow. Uh, Google is the
large number. 10 to a hundred.

2397
02:08:14,350 --> 02:08:17,890
That is the digit one
followed by 100 zero.

2398
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:22,090
What a great way to make a statement
about the depth and breadth of your

2399
02:08:22,091 --> 02:08:26,380
capabilities by using a number like that.
It's kind of beautiful. And how perfect.

2400
02:08:26,530 --> 02:08:29,770
What a perfect description. It's
perfect for Google. That is Google.

2401
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:34,510
Then Google voicemail. Google
fucking maps. Google cheeses.

2402
02:08:34,530 --> 02:08:37,270
So I am so excited to speak there.
Yeah. What are you gonna talk about?

2403
02:08:37,450 --> 02:08:40,690
I want to talk about creativity.
I'm going to talk about innovation.

2404
02:08:40,691 --> 02:08:42,700
I'm talking about inspiration in awe.

2405
02:08:42,710 --> 02:08:47,200
I'm going to talk about using technology
to render the impossible into existence.

2406
02:08:47,201 --> 02:08:48,550
And I'm going to show some of the videos.

2407
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:53,850
Actually my friend Josh Kaplan actually
who set this up is a huge fan of your

2408
02:08:54,431 --> 02:08:58,480
show. Oh that's awesome. He
loves your podcasts and so Josh

2409
02:09:00,190 --> 02:09:04,090
and he set up the invite to
Google. So that's amazing
that man, that's incredible.

2410
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:04,421
You know,

2411
02:09:04,421 --> 02:09:07,090
Google is known as being one of those
companies that really treats their

2412
02:09:07,091 --> 02:09:09,090
employees well. You know, that's like a,

2413
02:09:09,730 --> 02:09:12,220
we got an invite a couple of years
ago when we were in San Francisco,

2414
02:09:12,221 --> 02:09:14,320
maybe a year ago.
So I'm someone from Google emailed me,

2415
02:09:14,321 --> 02:09:17,840
but I lost it in the shuffle. My,
my email gets clogged sometimes.

2416
02:09:17,841 --> 02:09:20,330
Like I just can't find anyone
because you get a lot of crazy,

2417
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:22,970
you must get a lot of emails
in general, Huh? Yeah. But,

2418
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:25,480
but the one thing that I was
fascinated by, what I wanted to see,

2419
02:09:25,481 --> 02:09:27,280
what it was like in there, cause
I've always thought like, man,

2420
02:09:27,490 --> 02:09:31,120
why can't someone make a company where
they treat their employees well? Like,

2421
02:09:31,121 --> 02:09:34,870
how much more does it cost to give them
really good food, take care of them.

2422
02:09:35,050 --> 02:09:36,430
It might cost like a little more,

2423
02:09:36,431 --> 02:09:41,010
but wouldn't make the atmosphere way
better and make connections. So yeah,

2424
02:09:41,020 --> 02:09:44,050
I mean that's like one of
the most important things
is that the environment be

2425
02:09:44,051 --> 02:09:45,010
positive.
Totally.

2426
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:49,300
Nobody wants to work around someone who
doesn't want to work their creativity.

2427
02:09:49,301 --> 02:09:52,990
And productivity comes from allowing
people to have distractions.

2428
02:09:53,070 --> 02:09:55,060
So it's like they have ping pong tables,

2429
02:09:55,150 --> 02:09:58,540
bean bags and all these things because
you know, and some people might criticize,

2430
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:00,130
oh, it's just a playground. Actually. No,

2431
02:10:00,131 --> 02:10:01,990
it probably makes the
employees much more creative.

2432
02:10:01,991 --> 02:10:05,950
You're creating spaces in which the free
association and their services can fire

2433
02:10:05,951 --> 02:10:08,560
and yes, that's, creativity
is about that. It's been,

2434
02:10:08,561 --> 02:10:13,561
I'm sure there are judged or at least
evaluated based on the productivity.

2435
02:10:13,631 --> 02:10:16,840
It's not like they're not going to
be in the law of God this job, Tom,

2436
02:10:16,841 --> 02:10:18,370
just play ping pong. Right, right.

2437
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:20,170
And not the type of people that
will do that in the first place.

2438
02:10:20,590 --> 02:10:23,050
So it becomes a resource
rather than a distraction.

2439
02:10:23,070 --> 02:10:24,610
And it distraction as a resource.

2440
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:27,430
And these are the postindustrial
revolution companies.

2441
02:10:27,710 --> 02:10:30,730
These are the most admired companies
in the world. You have apple,

2442
02:10:30,731 --> 02:10:31,331
you have Google,

2443
02:10:31,331 --> 02:10:34,220
and people are looking to these companies
as examples of how to run businesses,

2444
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:37,850
how to have social impact, how to
make legacies, how to not be evil.

2445
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:40,840
And they still don't like this is
new model against the core of, of,

2446
02:10:40,841 --> 02:10:42,620
of corporations are
going to be judged upon.

2447
02:10:42,621 --> 02:10:45,110
So all the new entrepreneurs
now coming online,

2448
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:47,010
they're getting inspired
from these companies, right?

2449
02:10:47,050 --> 02:10:49,730
I want it may be the next Google
and change the world. It's not,

2450
02:10:49,731 --> 02:10:52,680
I want to make the next Google and
be rich. I want to change the world.

2451
02:10:52,681 --> 02:10:54,500
And what happens with like
Google video and stuff?

2452
02:10:54,501 --> 02:10:56,240
Cause I know they came
out against Sopa and the,

2453
02:10:56,241 --> 02:10:58,940
the Stop online piracy act and they kinda,

2454
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:02,060
that all fell apart and they're trying
to rig come up with a new strategy,

2455
02:11:02,061 --> 02:11:04,760
a new new, uh, a new act.
Well, I think we need to,

2456
02:11:04,761 --> 02:11:09,020
we need to all have a new conversation
about content ownership in a world in

2457
02:11:09,021 --> 02:11:11,540
which everybody has the tools
to make mixed tapes. So, yeah,

2458
02:11:11,570 --> 02:11:13,580
but like what about Google
videos and stuff like that?

2459
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:16,130
What if someone has a documentary
and the documentary is for sale,

2460
02:11:16,131 --> 02:11:20,180
but you go to Google video and there it
is and you can just watch it for free.

2461
02:11:20,510 --> 02:11:23,870
What is a no, no, you,
you do what Radiohead did,

2462
02:11:23,871 --> 02:11:27,200
which is where they put their album online
for free and they said donate money,

2463
02:11:27,230 --> 02:11:29,480
donate money if you would
like to pay for this music.

2464
02:11:29,930 --> 02:11:33,650
But if you think that that's how people
who want to sell DVDs should deal with

2465
02:11:33,651 --> 02:11:35,060
the fact that people
are stealing their shit,

2466
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:39,830
they're going to have to
ask for donations. Well, no,
but I think that we're just,

2467
02:11:39,831 --> 02:11:42,950
it's an invited a lot of which
more because what happens
is everybody's going to

2468
02:11:42,951 --> 02:11:45,920
be making content for free and way and
the content for free is going to be just

2469
02:11:45,921 --> 02:11:47,480
as good as the content you charge for.

2470
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:50,450
And I think people will pay because
they appreciate your content,

2471
02:11:50,780 --> 02:11:54,770
but I think it's going to be harder and
harder to like impose payment. Well,

2472
02:11:54,771 --> 02:11:57,080
how would someone,
like let's say for an example,

2473
02:11:57,081 --> 02:12:00,440
say if there's a documentary
on crocodiles. Okay, I told
you about it. Oh my God,

2474
02:12:00,441 --> 02:12:01,520
it's crazy.
You got to watch this.

2475
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:05,060
Now you go to Google video and you
find this documentary or crocodiles,

2476
02:12:05,270 --> 02:12:07,630
how the fuck are you going to find
the production company? The website?

2477
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:08,570
You got to search it out.

2478
02:12:08,571 --> 02:12:11,480
Are you going to go Google the name
of it and you're saying you were just

2479
02:12:11,481 --> 02:12:14,840
watching the website, watch it on youtube.
I mean if you really wanted to set up,

2480
02:12:14,841 --> 02:12:16,280
they had it set up where you could,

2481
02:12:16,310 --> 02:12:19,220
you know where you could donate if you
would like on their website. I mean,

2482
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:19,971
well no,
they can.

2483
02:12:19,971 --> 02:12:24,971
So they can do a youtube channel that
supported by ads and if lots of people

2484
02:12:25,161 --> 02:12:25,851
watch the movie,

2485
02:12:25,851 --> 02:12:29,030
they'll get money from the ads that
they have on their page and then they,

2486
02:12:29,031 --> 02:12:30,290
in the description,
they can say,

2487
02:12:30,291 --> 02:12:32,990
we're putting this movie online for
free because we want to share the ideas,

2488
02:12:33,170 --> 02:12:35,810
but we're asking for
donations of $5 a view.

2489
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:39,490
And I'm sure that a lot of people
would give it. A lot of people would.

2490
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:42,380
A lot of people wouldn't as well though.
Do you? So do you feel like that is,

2491
02:12:42,381 --> 02:12:43,340
and then there's the audit.

2492
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:45,920
The other argument is the
people that wouldn't as well.

2493
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:48,380
I kind of see their point of view because
they would, they would say, listen,

2494
02:12:48,590 --> 02:12:51,290
I would've never bought this in the first
place so I'm not taking anything away

2495
02:12:51,291 --> 02:12:51,940
from them.

2496
02:12:51,940 --> 02:12:55,370
I downloaded it because it
was free because I knew I
could watch it and I didn't

2497
02:12:55,371 --> 02:12:58,420
like it. So I'm glad that it would get my
map. When you see a bad name, you don't,

2498
02:12:58,430 --> 02:13:00,080
you want to get your money
back. Yes. I mean there's,

2499
02:13:00,260 --> 02:13:03,710
I can see that argument as
well. You know, it is a weird,

2500
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:08,470
it's one of the Zeros and it's just being
distributed through the Internet. It's,

2501
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:12,420
it's a weird, because conversations only
have a price because of scarcity. Right.

2502
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:14,740
Charged for something because
it's a rare commodity. No,

2503
02:13:14,750 --> 02:13:17,150
that also people things
have a price because you,

2504
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:20,230
I mean there's no scarcity in
artwork. I mean you're not, you know,

2505
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:22,610
when your work is yours unique,

2506
02:13:22,611 --> 02:13:26,150
so people pay for it because it's only
you did something that's unique to you

2507
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:28,490
and if you have an audience, because
I say it for, that's what I'm saying,

2508
02:13:28,670 --> 02:13:32,100
but I think that uh, increasingly
scarcity stayed stating them for their

2509
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:35,040
efforts. I mean it's not necessarily
just paying for scarcity,

2510
02:13:35,041 --> 02:13:37,830
it's you're compensating someone
honestly because you were efforts,

2511
02:13:37,831 --> 02:13:39,120
you appreciate the efforts.

2512
02:13:39,121 --> 02:13:41,250
But I think that it's just
the genie's out of the bottle.

2513
02:13:41,251 --> 02:13:44,190
It's just too difficult for
immaterial things to be contained.

2514
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:47,100
Do you think that ultimately that's going
to lead to sort of a decay in the idea

2515
02:13:47,101 --> 02:13:50,570
of capitalism and the, you know, the
thing is going to be doing exams.

2516
02:13:50,610 --> 02:13:51,960
Everything is going to be reexamined,

2517
02:13:51,980 --> 02:13:54,990
but when they start getting into like
real high end three d printers and that's

2518
02:13:54,991 --> 02:13:55,771
how you order things,

2519
02:13:55,771 --> 02:13:58,910
you just ordered the formula transform
manufacturing as well, man. Yeah.

2520
02:13:58,920 --> 02:13:59,753
And then the,

2521
02:14:00,020 --> 02:14:03,750
then those people will get scared and
lose their jobs and we'll have moments of

2522
02:14:03,751 --> 02:14:07,770
panic and all of that transition
will change everything.

2523
02:14:07,771 --> 02:14:12,150
But you know that like 80% of the jobs
that people do today didn't exist a

2524
02:14:12,150 --> 02:14:14,010
hundred years ago.
There were jobs that didn't exist.

2525
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:15,990
So there will be new things for us to do.

2526
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:20,910
It becomes a real problem when people
hold on to the idea that they need to keep

2527
02:14:20,911 --> 02:14:23,370
a job and because the job
is a part of the old way.

2528
02:14:23,371 --> 02:14:26,640
And that is also one of the reasons
why marijuana is still illegal.

2529
02:14:26,790 --> 02:14:28,860
And there was a recent
article that I tweeted,

2530
02:14:28,861 --> 02:14:31,170
if you find it just a couple of
days ago or just Google the, uh,

2531
02:14:31,171 --> 02:14:35,160
the statement lobbyists are getting rich
off keeping marijuana illegal because

2532
02:14:35,161 --> 02:14:36,390
that's what's going on, man. Right?

2533
02:14:36,450 --> 02:14:41,370
There's lobbyists that are doing this
through a police unions. You know,

2534
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:44,640
there's lobbyists that are doing
this and they're there. You know,

2535
02:14:44,730 --> 02:14:47,400
these guys are making a lot of
money off keeping marijuana illegal.

2536
02:14:47,401 --> 02:14:50,010
There's a lot of people
that their bishops, yeah,

2537
02:14:50,011 --> 02:14:53,050
well their business is
to arrest people for pod.

2538
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:56,640
Cause I mean that's part of the job.
It's part of what keeps people paid.

2539
02:14:56,930 --> 02:14:59,700
It's part of what keeps us
strong. Police Force. But even,

2540
02:14:59,790 --> 02:15:03,200
but I think that in a country where most
of the population at this point wants

2541
02:15:03,201 --> 02:15:04,140
it to be legalized,

2542
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:08,520
there should be no red tape or bureaucracy
between the peoples oil and it being

2543
02:15:08,521 --> 02:15:10,980
changed. I think it's also, most
people want it to be legalized.

2544
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:14,670
They should be like a like
button on Facebook and if
100 million people click it,

2545
02:15:14,690 --> 02:15:17,930
it should be legalized tomorrow. And I
think she will eventually. Yeah, that's,

2546
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:22,350
that's dynamic democracies. Things that
we'll need to get, one of the issues is,

2547
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:22,680
um,

2548
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:26,610
and I think this has to be stopped is
we have to stop treating police officers

2549
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:29,640
as glorified revenue collectors.
Cause that's what they are.

2550
02:15:29,641 --> 02:15:32,550
And I think that's a really
disgusting thing because guess what,

2551
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:35,670
firefighters and place, and I hope
we never have to fucking use them.

2552
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:39,300
I hope those guys get to hang out at the
firehouse all day and cook and work out

2553
02:15:39,301 --> 02:15:42,090
and do fucking Chin ups and shit.
And I hope no one ever has to work.

2554
02:15:42,270 --> 02:15:43,830
I hope no one ever has
to deal with the faculty.

2555
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:45,560
I would like the same thing
with police officers. Right.

2556
02:15:45,570 --> 02:15:47,810
It would be great if they
never had to take the guns out.

2557
02:15:47,850 --> 02:15:50,850
There was never anything for them.
The issue is they have quotas.

2558
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:53,610
They have quotas they have to
reach. I had no idea. Oh fuck. Yeah.

2559
02:15:53,700 --> 02:15:57,260
Especially with speeding. You know, I've
talked to friends. They have quotas. Yes,

2560
02:15:57,270 --> 02:15:59,890
absolutely. Yeah, they have. They have to
make quotas as far as giving out tickets,

2561
02:16:00,020 --> 02:16:01,470
so that really raises a red flag,

2562
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:06,120
like telling a firefighter that you're
only going to get paid if you put out a

2563
02:16:06,121 --> 02:16:08,040
fire or something.
I'm going to be looking to build fires.

2564
02:16:08,041 --> 02:16:13,041
Imagine what would happen if the entire
country decided that for one month,

2565
02:16:13,290 --> 02:16:15,930
which would fuck up the entire system.
That's all we need is 30 days.

2566
02:16:15,931 --> 02:16:19,650
Everybody in agreement where nobody
ever violates a single law as far as

2567
02:16:19,651 --> 02:16:22,890
speeding or driving traffic or stoplights.
We made a viral video for it.

2568
02:16:22,930 --> 02:16:26,610
Recruiting campaign. Don't break a law
for a month. Every cop and get fired.

2569
02:16:26,611 --> 02:16:29,980
It would be cas. Wow. Yeah. It'd be
crazy. They would lose all that revenue

2570
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,650
that they count on. They
count on us. Never evolving.

2571
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:34,780
I mean it's really
factored into the budget.

2572
02:16:34,790 --> 02:16:38,100
So we need massive system upgrades here.
Massive systemic system.

2573
02:16:38,101 --> 02:16:42,340
It's the idea that you have engineered
a system where we can never be good,

2574
02:16:42,550 --> 02:16:44,170
we can never get through because you,
you,

2575
02:16:44,171 --> 02:16:47,830
you're cops need to arrest
a certain amount of people
need to pull over rather a

2576
02:16:47,831 --> 02:16:49,710
certain amount of people and put out
a certain amount of tickets. The,

2577
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:51,610
the state relies on that for revenue.

2578
02:16:52,090 --> 02:16:56,120
We're going to have to radically change
everything. Will radically change. No,

2579
02:16:56,140 --> 02:16:57,280
but there was a time when,
you know,

2580
02:16:57,281 --> 02:16:59,950
somebody's life was about making
saddles for horses, you know,

2581
02:16:59,951 --> 02:17:02,830
cause everybody had horses and that person
was probably really nervous when the

2582
02:17:02,831 --> 02:17:05,280
car started to become popular because
it couldn't make his horse carriages

2583
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:09,980
anyone. Lucky for him. Lesbians are
still around and it's still like horses.

2584
02:17:10,630 --> 02:17:13,450
I wouldn't say lesbians, I'd say women
who used to like men but gave up.

2585
02:17:13,780 --> 02:17:14,980
Now they like horses.
I don't know man.

2586
02:17:14,981 --> 02:17:18,250
I live right in the question district
and I see him every day and some of them

2587
02:17:18,251 --> 02:17:19,120
are fucking high.

2588
02:17:19,140 --> 02:17:23,200
These are like spoiled little girls that
date like rich guys that by the models

2589
02:17:23,201 --> 02:17:26,170
and shit, you gotta fuck those girls
hard man. They ride horses all day.

2590
02:17:26,180 --> 02:17:26,591
They're used to,

2591
02:17:26,591 --> 02:17:30,870
they're not impressed by just like
regular sex riding a giant animal,

2592
02:17:31,050 --> 02:17:34,570
you must feel so feeble, you
know? You know what I'm saying?

2593
02:17:34,930 --> 02:17:37,030
They get on top of you. They're
like, really? This is it.

2594
02:17:37,031 --> 02:17:38,930
This is all you got to
their next level of Madison.

2595
02:17:38,990 --> 02:17:42,850
I always feel bad for the horses, man.
It's chains around their mouths. I'm like,

2596
02:17:42,851 --> 02:17:46,240
no man. Yeah, I don't like
it. It's gross. It's gross.

2597
02:17:46,300 --> 02:17:49,840
There's a lot of people in my neighborhood
and they're like super self righteous,

2598
02:17:50,140 --> 02:17:54,670
like you know, slow down. You can be like,
it's 28 miles, you know the speed limits.

2599
02:17:54,671 --> 02:17:59,050
25 you're going 28 slow
down, slow down. Just big,

2600
02:17:59,051 --> 02:18:02,850
big bull dyke on her fucking crazy animal.
It's a weird thing.

2601
02:18:02,890 --> 02:18:06,970
You're allowed to just ride around animals
in 2012 someone should come along and

2602
02:18:06,971 --> 02:18:10,260
you know, really just go to a farm
somewhere. You can't be just, you know,

2603
02:18:10,270 --> 02:18:12,370
I don't care if this is a question
you district. That's ridiculous.

2604
02:18:12,371 --> 02:18:17,260
It still Berbick you crazy. Fuck. We do
doing riding a horse my neighborhood soon.

2605
02:18:17,261 --> 02:18:21,880
We won't. We won't eat animals either.
I'm really convinced about in vitro meat,

2606
02:18:21,881 --> 02:18:24,670
man. No one's going to have
to eat those fucking animals.

2607
02:18:24,700 --> 02:18:28,090
That's a problem because what happens
then? What do we do? Eat, sterilize them.

2608
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:31,820
What do we do to keep them from just being
everywhere? Like in India? What's it?

2609
02:18:31,860 --> 02:18:32,170
You know,

2610
02:18:32,170 --> 02:18:35,560
what does it like if you drive everywhere
in his fucking cows are like rats in

2611
02:18:35,561 --> 02:18:38,800
New York City. Just infesting the
landscape and we can't eat them.

2612
02:18:39,430 --> 02:18:40,510
Some of them have to kill him,
Bro.

2613
02:18:40,511 --> 02:18:42,470
And we're going to have to
deal introduced triceratops.

2614
02:18:42,730 --> 02:18:46,570
Maybe we want to get some dinosaurs
breed as many. I mean, that's an option.

2615
02:18:46,630 --> 02:18:49,600
What if we just let them go? Right? If we
let them go without eating them anymore,

2616
02:18:49,601 --> 02:18:51,140
we let them go. They're going
to fuck. They're going, fuck,

2617
02:18:51,141 --> 02:18:52,900
am I going to be like Buffalo,
Buffalo Plains?

2618
02:18:52,910 --> 02:18:56,130
Just grow the tissue where they're going
to be everywhere. System. Oh Man, I dunno.

2619
02:18:56,170 --> 02:19:01,000
I think, uh, if we want to stay human,
I think they're going to keep up.

2620
02:19:01,020 --> 02:19:03,100
They're going to keep breeding.
I think we're going to have to get,

2621
02:19:03,101 --> 02:19:06,970
predators are going to have to make some
robot predators like those dog robot

2622
02:19:06,971 --> 02:19:10,150
things that only just go out
and jack cows. Interesting.

2623
02:19:10,210 --> 02:19:13,360
They just do it to keep the population
down. Who knows, man. And we to be,

2624
02:19:13,361 --> 02:19:17,100
it's going to be dry. Just shook his head.

2625
02:19:17,180 --> 02:19:21,470
I'll have to add a new scenario now.
The new scenarios, we'll come in,

2626
02:19:21,471 --> 02:19:25,240
we'll find new novel solutions to
do, eat meal with them. Do eat meat.

2627
02:19:25,870 --> 02:19:28,670
I eat meat. Not every day,
but I'm a flexitarian.

2628
02:19:28,820 --> 02:19:32,330
Flexitarian. You're flexible.
I know I eat meat but I just,

2629
02:19:32,390 --> 02:19:33,360
I try not to eat it every day.

2630
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:37,220
Did you ever consider the idea that what
you're doing is harmful to the energy

2631
02:19:37,221 --> 02:19:40,750
of the university or you know,
eating tortured animals? Uh,

2632
02:19:40,810 --> 02:19:45,290
never fuck with you ever watch like
food inc or I try to have organic food,

2633
02:19:45,800 --> 02:19:47,150
but I still,
you know,

2634
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:49,820
that's like a cow that grows up in the
hippie community and they get shot in the

2635
02:19:49,821 --> 02:19:53,450
head. I don't know. It still gets jacked.
I would like to become vegetarian.

2636
02:19:53,451 --> 02:19:56,720
It's just, it's not the easiest
thing to do logistically. You know?

2637
02:19:57,240 --> 02:19:58,760
Now you can't always find it right now.

2638
02:19:58,761 --> 02:20:01,850
You're going to get a swarm of hate
mail from right now from sweaty little

2639
02:20:01,851 --> 02:20:04,790
vegans, vegetarians, they're warming up
their little fingers right now. Well,

2640
02:20:04,791 --> 02:20:09,170
I'm a flexitarian. I mean not,
not you. An open minded person.

2641
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:12,910
Food twice a week is already
really good at you're making it.

2642
02:20:12,940 --> 02:20:17,220
That's the beginning. That's
decent. That's the beginning.
No, no, eight, no. Yeah,

2643
02:20:17,570 --> 02:20:21,500
I think animals are dumb and I think uh,
if they were smart, they'd be killing us.

2644
02:20:22,220 --> 02:20:25,020
I think we'd have issues.
I think every animal is playfully.

2645
02:20:25,060 --> 02:20:28,310
We get to where our empathy is
big enough to alleviate suffering.

2646
02:20:28,311 --> 02:20:30,660
Even co even suffering
if it's not compliantly.

2647
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:35,800
I agree as a cycle of life
requires predators and we
have sort of can completely

2648
02:20:36,141 --> 02:20:39,890
hijack that cycle of life with the idea
of cities and civilization and a big

2649
02:20:39,891 --> 02:20:44,060
metal boxes were contrived through
fucking safari and be 10 feet away from a

2650
02:20:44,061 --> 02:20:47,690
lion killing a gazelle.
I mean we've got a crazy game changers.

2651
02:20:47,691 --> 02:20:51,290
Men were complete game changing
species for good or for bad.

2652
02:20:51,291 --> 02:20:52,550
I think more for good.

2653
02:20:52,550 --> 02:20:56,120
I think I'm more impressed with with
us than I am that I am disturbed by us.

2654
02:20:56,180 --> 02:20:58,670
I long shot much more
impressed with us though,

2655
02:20:59,180 --> 02:21:02,540
but it's nice to just kind of to marvel,
let ourselves a little bit.

2656
02:21:02,541 --> 02:21:04,250
I think we have kind of a,
what's it called,

2657
02:21:04,251 --> 02:21:08,690
a guilty cosmic complex where we feel
like we're small and insignificant and I

2658
02:21:08,691 --> 02:21:13,490
think we have a big role to play and can
play an even bigger role if we pool our

2659
02:21:13,491 --> 02:21:15,470
cognitive resources together.
I agree,

2660
02:21:15,471 --> 02:21:20,471
but I also agree the big is delicious and
so steak and a that you can grow bacon

2661
02:21:20,931 --> 02:21:23,930
out of like stem cells,
like a print ad to kill another animal,

2662
02:21:23,931 --> 02:21:27,530
print das to Bacon. You're never
going to be able to recreate venison.

2663
02:21:27,860 --> 02:21:31,790
You never going to be able to retain a
special no. Venison is dear me. Oh, okay.

2664
02:21:32,030 --> 02:21:36,830
Totally recreate. There's a
delicious Gamey, wild flavor.

2665
02:21:37,390 --> 02:21:41,570
Tell how much shit ones and Zeros you
think they'll be able to figure that out.

2666
02:21:41,660 --> 02:21:42,291
Yeah,
man.

2667
02:21:42,291 --> 02:21:44,840
He'll be like in the matrix when a
guy's eating the steak and he's like,

2668
02:21:44,841 --> 02:21:49,610
I know this is not real. I know it's made
of like code. He's like, I don't care.

2669
02:21:49,670 --> 02:21:51,860
It tastes delicious and
it puts it in his mouth.

2670
02:21:51,861 --> 02:21:55,250
So you gotta be satisfied with that. I
think we all say it's inevitable, right?

2671
02:21:55,310 --> 02:21:57,960
It's inevitable. We'll do it. I
mean, what are we tasting anyway?

2672
02:21:58,040 --> 02:22:01,490
Except our brain's interpretation
of something going in
through sensors that are

2673
02:22:01,491 --> 02:22:04,700
like creating a software that goes
in real time and tells us, Oh,

2674
02:22:04,701 --> 02:22:05,600
this is what this feels like.

2675
02:22:05,630 --> 02:22:08,450
I'm glad I got to experience
life with no answering machines.

2676
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:11,470
I'm glad I got to experience no
cell phones when I was growing up.

2677
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:14,390
So you could see the contrast.
Absolutely. Absolutely.

2678
02:22:14,391 --> 02:22:16,220
Does it make you appreciate
how much higher do you are now?

2679
02:22:16,610 --> 02:22:20,120
I appreciate how wired we are now,
but I also appreciate old school stuff.

2680
02:22:20,150 --> 02:22:24,890
I appreciate, I appreciate a good steak.
You know, I like a good steak. Hardwood.

2681
02:22:25,210 --> 02:22:28,650
Coles grilled is
amen.

2682
02:22:29,030 --> 02:22:33,660
Cooking with cooking with fire was
a technology to yeah, it is. Yeah.

2683
02:22:33,750 --> 02:22:37,170
So yeah, absolutely. I mean,
look what the appendix exists to.

2684
02:22:37,171 --> 02:22:40,890
It was an Oregon to break down fibers
we eat and all kinds of crazy shit back

2685
02:22:40,891 --> 02:22:42,790
then, wasn't it? I mean it
wasn't there. What it was,

2686
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:45,080
we lost its use and that's
why a lot of people have to,

2687
02:22:45,260 --> 02:22:49,320
have you ever gotten your, uh, your genome
tested to see what percentage? 20 tall.

2688
02:22:49,321 --> 02:22:52,170
You are 23 and me,
the Google thing,

2689
02:22:52,660 --> 02:22:56,850
you were talking about it and it's
not completely, I mean it's not,

2690
02:22:56,851 --> 02:22:58,380
it's not like they can
understand everything.

2691
02:22:58,410 --> 02:23:02,350
Someone's a monkey and it's trying
to dump it on technology. Yeah.

2692
02:23:03,150 --> 02:23:05,070
It's one of those exponential
things where eventually they'll,

2693
02:23:05,100 --> 02:23:07,890
it'll be 100% tell you everything
about everything. Do you have to,

2694
02:23:07,891 --> 02:23:10,530
right now at least it tells you, did you
spit in a cup or something like that?

2695
02:23:10,531 --> 02:23:11,520
You said,
how do you do it?

2696
02:23:11,521 --> 02:23:16,020
What do you do is send you this little
tube twenty3@aol.com yeah, 23 minutes.

2697
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:18,850
Amazing.
I'll tell you if you have like a precut,

2698
02:23:19,420 --> 02:23:21,690
a precondition of some sorts,

2699
02:23:21,691 --> 02:23:24,820
or if you have a likelihood of developing
something like high blood pressure,

2700
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:27,600
if your genetic profile says
you're going to get Parkinson's,

2701
02:23:27,601 --> 02:23:29,430
are the percentages of a
chance of developing something.

2702
02:23:29,640 --> 02:23:33,480
So for people who get stuff
that's preventable, you
know, if they're like, oh,

2703
02:23:33,481 --> 02:23:36,960
I have a 70% chance of high blood
pressure, I can start addressing that now.

2704
02:23:37,230 --> 02:23:40,560
I've been told that I'm more likely to
get it in another person so I can change

2705
02:23:40,561 --> 02:23:44,250
my diet now because some people are just
genetically so lucky that they can eat

2706
02:23:44,251 --> 02:23:47,300
shit. Nothing will ever
happen to them. Fuckers. Yeah,

2707
02:23:47,310 --> 02:23:50,760
that's always the case until we all
upgrade our genes, but for everybody else,

2708
02:23:50,761 --> 02:23:53,880
this is a chance to see what some of their
vulnerabilities might be and how they

2709
02:23:53,881 --> 02:23:56,490
might address them.
So we start to hack our biology.

2710
02:23:56,491 --> 02:23:59,550
How cool is this idea that we
all start hacking our biology.

2711
02:23:59,700 --> 02:24:03,210
We're upgrading ourselves by hacking in
and getting back door and are we short

2712
02:24:03,270 --> 02:24:04,051
cuts and forcing?

2713
02:24:04,051 --> 02:24:09,051
Are we delaying the inevitable
brilliant next stage of existence?

2714
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:10,540
Are we in this light?

2715
02:24:10,550 --> 02:24:15,550
You mean that may be will be something
after this stage is way better and that's

2716
02:24:16,111 --> 02:24:19,910
the natural progress. The natural
progress is to move from this to the next.

2717
02:24:19,950 --> 02:24:21,660
That could only be the case.

2718
02:24:23,130 --> 02:24:26,520
If this is a simulation and we are went
to the waking up from the simulation.

2719
02:24:26,521 --> 02:24:29,460
If this is a lucid dream,
if this is limbo from inception,

2720
02:24:29,490 --> 02:24:32,820
you know that you spend 80 years in limbo
and you get old before you wake up and

2721
02:24:32,821 --> 02:24:36,360
become a young man again. But if
that's the case, great look, awesome.

2722
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:38,040
I fucking hope so man.

2723
02:24:38,250 --> 02:24:41,940
I'm just not fully convinced so I'm
going to fight for my survival as

2724
02:24:42,270 --> 02:24:45,420
passionately as I can now because I have
the evidence that there's anything else.

2725
02:24:45,810 --> 02:24:48,750
No evidence. It's pretty
hopeless. Fair is pretty vivid.

2726
02:24:48,810 --> 02:24:52,230
It might be the big sleep
it turned any on both ends.

2727
02:24:52,231 --> 02:24:55,280
Why can't any of the universe is
eternal? Why can't we be? That's my,

2728
02:24:55,490 --> 02:24:57,720
I think consciousness probably
goes to sleep forever,

2729
02:24:57,750 --> 02:24:59,220
but I think you should come a part of,

2730
02:24:59,250 --> 02:25:02,730
is it maybe consciousness is
really a tool to create action.

2731
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,150
Maybe it's a tool to move things forward.
There's no doubt that it is,

2732
02:25:06,151 --> 02:25:08,960
but it's a tool that found out that
it enjoys it so it wants to proceed.

2733
02:25:08,970 --> 02:25:13,170
It likes blowjob. Joy's itself
drunk. We're self referential.

2734
02:25:13,171 --> 02:25:15,390
It's that recursive feedback loop.
We know that.

2735
02:25:15,391 --> 02:25:17,670
We know that we know and
therefore consciousness.

2736
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:20,730
If it was a fluke or if it
was by like emergent design,

2737
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:23,950
it has decided that it likes itself.
Sure.

2738
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:28,390
It likes like, you know, it likes free
time. It likes to make art and sing songs.

2739
02:25:28,391 --> 02:25:32,200
Not everything that it does is to
build things and to be utilitarian and

2740
02:25:32,201 --> 02:25:35,320
functional thumbs things are pure
pleasure. The robots in blade runner,

2741
02:25:35,321 --> 02:25:40,000
pleasure of being alive as well. There
you go. So that could be what it is,

2742
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:43,570
right? Yeah. Rutger Hauer. Remember? He
really liked it. Yeah. Who's bummed down?

2743
02:25:44,890 --> 02:25:49,720
Yeah. Crazy kangaroos.
Kangaroos. Kangaroos.

2744
02:25:49,721 --> 02:25:53,560
Who eat a flower. That came from
another planet. I'm telling you, man,

2745
02:25:53,561 --> 02:25:58,480
it's super intelligent kangaroos.
Would that be the shit of Kangaroos?

2746
02:25:58,481 --> 02:26:01,320
Started yelling at you for
fucking polluting Kangaroos?

2747
02:26:01,321 --> 02:26:04,240
Started talking to English like really
quick a couple of years and they were

2748
02:26:04,241 --> 02:26:07,840
Catholic school growing and amazing
about Kangaroos is that they continue to

2749
02:26:07,841 --> 02:26:12,700
raise, they have that thing, you know
the pouch, the pouch, little babies,

2750
02:26:12,940 --> 02:26:15,860
but it's almost like when the baby's born,
it's almost like not ready to be born.

2751
02:26:15,860 --> 02:26:18,190
And so they kept him in there
and that's kind of like, well,

2752
02:26:18,191 --> 02:26:19,950
they live in a terrible environment.
Yeah.

2753
02:26:20,230 --> 02:26:22,390
I mean they have to protect that
fucking thing. It's kind of amazing.

2754
02:26:22,430 --> 02:26:24,370
They live in where there's
crocodiles everywhere, right?

2755
02:26:24,430 --> 02:26:29,050
Kangaroos or that's a bad spot. Yeah.
Australia's those shady fucking spot.

2756
02:26:29,051 --> 02:26:32,020
The most venomous snakes. Oh, they
got all this shit that can kill you.

2757
02:26:32,140 --> 02:26:35,120
And most of the country, you can't live
in most of the country. Nobody lives in.

2758
02:26:35,121 --> 02:26:38,990
Well, they live or on the coast for that.
It's happening more and more, more, more,

2759
02:26:38,991 --> 02:26:40,270
more people moving to cities.
Man,

2760
02:26:40,271 --> 02:26:42,700
most of the population lives in cities
and will continue to live in and they

2761
02:26:42,701 --> 02:26:46,300
found a reef of ancient bile.

2762
02:26:46,301 --> 02:26:50,950
Ancient like a simple organism.
Shit that is like some,

2763
02:26:50,951 --> 02:26:54,460
it's the 650 fucking million years old.
Some insane.

2764
02:26:54,570 --> 02:26:56,310
So it predated the,

2765
02:26:56,311 --> 02:27:01,050
the idea of life on this planet and they
founded in Australia. Yeah. Australia is,

2766
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:05,170
it's a crazy spot. It would be fun
to go. Yeah, I've been a few times.

2767
02:27:05,171 --> 02:27:09,640
I've been to Sydney, Sydney twice.
Great people. Really Nice people man.

2768
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:11,770
I said I hear and they have
no ozone over there man.

2769
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:16,000
They got real cancer problems like all
over their billboards are these pictures,

2770
02:27:16,001 --> 02:27:18,220
they have like these uh,
skin cancer campaigns.

2771
02:27:18,221 --> 02:27:22,410
So there's photos of people with big giant
stitched up scars talk about getting,

2772
02:27:22,430 --> 02:27:26,140
cause everyone's getting chunks taken out
of them. But you go out there and the,

2773
02:27:26,141 --> 02:27:31,100
you know, in the, in the sun
with no sunscreen on, you
get fucked up man. Sunscreen.

2774
02:27:31,150 --> 02:27:33,910
Yeah. It's another level
son with the ozone layer.

2775
02:27:34,090 --> 02:27:36,550
This giant hole in the ozone
over that long to get there.

2776
02:27:36,551 --> 02:27:40,780
I like 17 hours or something. Not
Quite. I think 15 something like that.

2777
02:27:40,950 --> 02:27:44,530
I want to go, it's a lot want to
go. But you know what, if you,

2778
02:27:44,531 --> 02:27:48,460
if you can deal with that just one day.
I mean, you know what you do is man,

2779
02:27:48,670 --> 02:27:50,680
get a bunch of podcast,
get a bunch of podcasts,

2780
02:27:50,681 --> 02:27:55,030
get a few movies on your iPad and just
zone out and just goes in and say,

2781
02:27:55,031 --> 02:27:57,820
this is what I'm doing. And don't
freak out and don't feel like, fuck,

2782
02:27:57,821 --> 02:28:00,940
I got to get up, move around. Just,
just deal with it. Ain't no big a deal.

2783
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:04,780
And then once you get there, Holy Shit.
It's a beautiful, beautiful country.

2784
02:28:05,140 --> 02:28:06,550
It's so gorgeous.

2785
02:28:06,670 --> 02:28:11,170
It's so amazing when you think that
the people from England cause that as a

2786
02:28:11,171 --> 02:28:14,500
prison colony at one point in time, you
know, like what a, what a silly idea.

2787
02:28:14,501 --> 02:28:17,510
Fascinating. Now all their
actors win all the awards. Yeah.

2788
02:28:17,511 --> 02:28:20,830
I wonder why they're so good. Yeah.
Australian and British actors, man,

2789
02:28:20,831 --> 02:28:25,050
they bring it end ups to Jim Jefferies.
Really funny. Standup from uh,

2790
02:28:25,490 --> 02:28:28,220
Australia. Yeah. And there's a couple of
Americans that do really well with their,

2791
02:28:28,221 --> 02:28:29,900
like Eddie aft and Arch Barker.

2792
02:28:29,901 --> 02:28:33,190
They go over there and they're the arch
Barker's fucking enormous over there

2793
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:37,250
apparently. Yeah. Yeah. And they just
really, like when I was in Australia,

2794
02:28:37,251 --> 02:28:39,680
I was talking to people like, what do you
do? I'm like, Oh, I'm a comedian. Like,

2795
02:28:39,681 --> 02:28:44,150
you know, ODG Parka immediately.
Wow. Yeah. Yeah. It's uh,

2796
02:28:44,360 --> 02:28:48,380
it's so close to like,
it's nothing like America,

2797
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:51,200
but you could totally hang out there.
Like you could live there.

2798
02:28:51,380 --> 02:28:54,080
Like you wouldn't have to learn a
language. People are very friendly.

2799
02:28:54,081 --> 02:28:57,190
You'd have no problems. It feels
slightly alternate universe. Yes,

2800
02:28:57,760 --> 02:29:00,980
they speak English, but it's
just another, another reality.

2801
02:29:01,130 --> 02:29:04,440
It's so far away that they drive on
the other side of the road. Right.

2802
02:29:04,610 --> 02:29:07,640
That freaks you out. Right? Totally.
That whole England thing is a trip,

2803
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:12,110
Alison Wonderland. It's like, why are you
on this site traveling so cool though,

2804
02:29:12,111 --> 02:29:14,690
for shifting people's sense
of like reality. Oh yeah.

2805
02:29:14,750 --> 02:29:18,860
Expanding your consciousness because
you're immersed in a sort of mirror world

2806
02:29:19,130 --> 02:29:22,640
where it's like, well, most
things are kind of the same,
but they're a little off.

2807
02:29:22,670 --> 02:29:25,880
Yeah. So it's like reality has shifted
a little bit. I think it's a traveling,

2808
02:29:25,930 --> 02:29:30,620
so it's cool to see like culture like
Australia where w you know, socially,

2809
02:29:30,770 --> 02:29:33,800
you know, it was really kind of like
parallel to America, like really similar.

2810
02:29:33,801 --> 02:29:35,780
I mean not exact but,
but really similar.

2811
02:29:35,781 --> 02:29:38,780
Like if you go over there and you
meet an Australian guy who your age,

2812
02:29:38,900 --> 02:29:41,480
chances are you've got to have a lot of
things to talk about in common and it

2813
02:29:41,481 --> 02:29:43,700
won't be very,
it'd be different but not alien at all.

2814
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:46,490
So it's kind of interesting that that
is happening on the other side of the

2815
02:29:46,491 --> 02:29:49,400
planet, right? There's like some
sort of, uh, you know, you're there,

2816
02:29:49,401 --> 02:29:51,680
you're modern civilization
and they're like,

2817
02:29:51,710 --> 02:29:54,770
these people live here and the dream
here and the wake up and they go to work.

2818
02:29:54,771 --> 02:29:55,840
I scrape living.

2819
02:29:55,841 --> 02:29:58,970
There are higher lines with a whole
different set of priorities that have no

2820
02:29:58,971 --> 02:30:02,210
bearing on my existence and that I didn't
know about it until they came here.

2821
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:05,090
And what really makes you trip out is
when you watch their TV shows and they

2822
02:30:05,091 --> 02:30:08,330
have like really popular TV shows,
you fucking never heard about her though.

2823
02:30:08,340 --> 02:30:10,130
When a guy comes out
and the girl comes out,

2824
02:30:10,131 --> 02:30:12,320
you know who the fuck are these people?
And everybody goes crazy.

2825
02:30:12,321 --> 02:30:14,850
Everybody goes crazy. Number
one show in Australia, my,

2826
02:30:15,020 --> 02:30:18,500
I can't believe they're really on right
now and everybody will sit down and get

2827
02:30:18,501 --> 02:30:19,460
drunk.
It's amazing.

2828
02:30:19,461 --> 02:30:23,780
It gives you perspective also just you
from your reality on hinges you a little

2829
02:30:23,781 --> 02:30:23,990
bit.

2830
02:30:23,990 --> 02:30:27,980
The one thing that I consistently get
when I go to these places is how uptight

2831
02:30:27,981 --> 02:30:31,520
America is. You know when you go
and you, especially for Australia,

2832
02:30:31,640 --> 02:30:36,110
they're so fun and they're so easy to
hang out with and so generally friendly.

2833
02:30:36,350 --> 02:30:37,980
It makes you feel like why?
What does this law,

2834
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:41,660
what's responsible for this
level of tension in America?
Well, he's responsible.

2835
02:30:41,950 --> 02:30:43,010
It's not everywhere by the way.

2836
02:30:43,011 --> 02:30:45,110
Of course there's a lot of cool
people in America. Don't get me wrong,

2837
02:30:45,290 --> 02:30:48,590
I get a lot of Douche bag
dummy tweets like whoo, whoo,

2838
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:52,080
move to have grooves doing viewed
America that I hate America.

2839
02:30:52,081 --> 02:30:56,030
Stupid is what I love American.
I think America should be awesome.

2840
02:30:56,240 --> 02:30:58,790
I mean it is awesome,
but it should be better than what it is.

2841
02:30:58,791 --> 02:31:02,900
It's possible for us to improve and what
holds us back? It's fuck heads like you.

2842
02:31:03,110 --> 02:31:05,400
That's what holds us back.
Tweet Twitter. We need this guy.

2843
02:31:05,410 --> 02:31:09,200
There should be no reason why the
cutting edge to be uptight about things

2844
02:31:09,201 --> 02:31:12,920
particularly like social issues that we
need to like completely legalized gay

2845
02:31:12,921 --> 02:31:16,730
marriage everywhere we need to
legalize marijuana. Rick Santorum.

2846
02:31:16,820 --> 02:31:20,250
Cause he disagrees. Rick Santorum had
have a really interesting point though.

2847
02:31:20,251 --> 02:31:25,110
I've got to admit, I mean I am a always
a 100% in support of gay marriage. I'm,

2848
02:31:25,170 --> 02:31:27,000
you know, I think she'd be able to
do whatever the fuck you want to do.

2849
02:31:27,001 --> 02:31:30,300
It's not as, it's not hurting me.
It's not a scam. It's not hurting me.

2850
02:31:30,301 --> 02:31:32,760
It's not like you're trying to steal
money means it's not her. Right.

2851
02:31:33,060 --> 02:31:34,860
So I'm completely in support of that.

2852
02:31:34,861 --> 02:31:36,920
But he had a really interesting
point that Rick Santorum,

2853
02:31:37,310 --> 02:31:41,680
cause he was talking about marriage,
has always been for over a thousand years,

2854
02:31:41,681 --> 02:31:43,260
has been defined as a man and a woman.

2855
02:31:43,710 --> 02:31:46,470
Now all of a sudden you're calling it
marriage, but it's a man and a man.

2856
02:31:46,620 --> 02:31:50,910
Can it be a man and two men?
And I was like, Oh shit.

2857
02:31:50,940 --> 02:31:52,870
Like he just flipped it on
its head like he really did.

2858
02:31:52,871 --> 02:31:55,380
It was a really good point because
a, and I was like, well yeah,

2859
02:31:55,381 --> 02:31:57,880
well why can't it be two men?
Why can't, why can't two,

2860
02:31:57,910 --> 02:32:02,190
two men get married to a guy? Why can't
everybody just bang each other? Why not?

2861
02:32:02,191 --> 02:32:06,510
Why not? Why not? Yeah, but, but he was,
the women in the audience were saying, no,

2862
02:32:06,511 --> 02:32:09,930
that's a different scenario. You're
talking about a couple that's in love.

2863
02:32:09,931 --> 02:32:12,090
And she's like, well no. What
if these people are all in love?

2864
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:15,690
There's three of them would have, you
know, can it be two women and a man?

2865
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:19,260
Can it be two men and women and then,
you know, he just fucked him up, man.

2866
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:21,660
He just fucked them up. There's nothing
they can say then cause you know,

2867
02:32:21,690 --> 02:32:25,440
he's really right. Like first of all,
as a personal freedom, uh, issue,

2868
02:32:25,441 --> 02:32:27,030
I'd feel like you should be
able to whenever you want.

2869
02:32:27,031 --> 02:32:30,390
If it's not hurting me clearly,
clearly gay marriage is not hurting me.

2870
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:33,090
So do whatever the fuck you want.
But if you want to call it marriage,

2871
02:32:33,240 --> 02:32:36,390
like maybe they should call it,
maybe it should be something different.

2872
02:32:36,660 --> 02:32:39,630
Maybe it's marriage, but it's gay
marriage. Oh, we're gay. Married. No,

2873
02:32:40,410 --> 02:32:41,880
like me and my partner,
a gay married.

2874
02:32:41,881 --> 02:32:44,970
You wouldn't be able to say regular
married while we're triple married.

2875
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:47,220
Oh there's three of you.
Yeah, we'll get to it.

2876
02:32:47,290 --> 02:32:49,950
What would you call that if you made
that legal, what would you call that?

2877
02:32:50,490 --> 02:32:53,700
Domestic partnership.
Domestic domestic partners.

2878
02:32:53,830 --> 02:32:57,570
If they want to call them married.
This is my one to where they want to know,

2879
02:32:57,571 --> 02:32:58,021
but you know,

2880
02:32:58,021 --> 02:33:02,160
and then they get all the benefits of
society and they wanted like do tax stuff

2881
02:33:02,161 --> 02:33:04,530
together and all those things
that people want. Why not?

2882
02:33:05,100 --> 02:33:08,040
Corporations can have like a hundreds
of employees or thousands of employees.

2883
02:33:08,041 --> 02:33:09,570
Maybe marriages should be able to as well.

2884
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:13,800
So 100,000 people in a marriage you're
down with like they can be many nation

2885
02:33:13,801 --> 02:33:17,610
states, married style polygamy.
I got a Time magazine. No,

2886
02:33:17,670 --> 02:33:20,520
that's different because those are
getting minors involved. Right.

2887
02:33:20,530 --> 02:33:24,210
And coercing people and imposing reality
tunnels and you'd have a tying access

2888
02:33:24,211 --> 02:33:25,980
to other media.
Like it's different.

2889
02:33:26,130 --> 02:33:28,320
I've got a Time magazine home
and there's a guy on the cover,

2890
02:33:28,860 --> 02:33:32,380
one of those last holdout old man,
Mormon dude who has a,

2891
02:33:32,381 --> 02:33:34,200
a gang of wives and uh,

2892
02:33:35,080 --> 02:33:39,810
still still rocking it is one dude,
nine wives and he's got 46 children.

2893
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:45,540
What the fuck? What it would be
thrown in jail? What the fuck man?

2894
02:33:47,130 --> 02:33:49,620
Yeah, that's crazy. Do you know
that a lot of those guys, uh,

2895
02:33:49,740 --> 02:33:52,400
we talked about this before. Who Was
it? What did we brought up this, uh,

2896
02:33:52,450 --> 02:33:53,640
that they went to Mexico,

2897
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:57,210
that a lot of Mormons were traveling
to Mexico and they were having problems

2898
02:33:57,211 --> 02:34:00,390
with the cartels. They established these
polygamous communities down in Mexico.

2899
02:34:00,420 --> 02:34:00,900
Oh Wow.

2900
02:34:00,900 --> 02:34:04,410
And I was having problems with the drug
cartels and someone was assassinated

2901
02:34:04,470 --> 02:34:07,050
lane. Remember that? I
remember who brought it up.

2902
02:34:07,230 --> 02:34:09,270
One of our guests brought
it up and I'm like, wow.

2903
02:34:09,271 --> 02:34:11,610
I had no idea that that
was even going down. Right.

2904
02:34:11,670 --> 02:34:14,610
They've set up these alternative
communities down in Mexico.

2905
02:34:16,140 --> 02:34:17,140
Do you ever think about that?

2906
02:34:17,141 --> 02:34:20,680
Like what if somebody just decided to
like turn Costa Rica and the Goddamn

2907
02:34:20,680 --> 02:34:22,290
Paradise? Everybody said
they're just trying to do it.

2908
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:25,420
The world's all fucked up everywhere else.
But here's the deal.

2909
02:34:25,421 --> 02:34:26,870
We have a limited government.

2910
02:34:26,890 --> 02:34:31,240
We were going to establish the best
schools possible libertarian. Yes, yes.

2911
02:34:31,330 --> 02:34:34,540
Social, you know, a care
possible. The best healthcare,

2912
02:34:34,541 --> 02:34:38,950
the best community centers
where we, you know, we, we
have people who are, you know,

2913
02:34:39,250 --> 02:34:44,220
set up to take care of stray children
and really create a society where

2914
02:34:44,480 --> 02:34:48,320
there's a guy called Patri Friedman who
had this thing called the seasteading

2915
02:34:48,321 --> 02:34:50,780
institute,
which is a organization that,

2916
02:34:50,781 --> 02:34:53,870
and they're backed by like Peter Teal
and everything and giant island. Yeah.

2917
02:34:53,871 --> 02:34:58,040
To make these artificial manmade
islands where we can do practice runs a

2918
02:34:58,041 --> 02:35:01,310
futuristic versions of governance and
they can be an international waters,

2919
02:35:01,490 --> 02:35:05,330
but now they're doing something with a
Central American nation where the nation

2920
02:35:05,331 --> 02:35:09,080
has given them a chunk of land to let
them set up their own autonomous zone.

2921
02:35:09,110 --> 02:35:10,670
Where was his wares in Central America?

2922
02:35:10,780 --> 02:35:14,240
It was Nicaragua or Guatemala or
one of those, but they're going to,

2923
02:35:14,241 --> 02:35:14,891
they're going to try.

2924
02:35:14,891 --> 02:35:18,380
It has been all these articles about it
and they're going to test out futuristic

2925
02:35:18,381 --> 02:35:19,580
cutting edge forms of government.

2926
02:35:19,670 --> 02:35:20,030
See,
I'm,

2927
02:35:20,030 --> 02:35:23,570
the only thing I worry about is one of
the beautiful things about doing things

2928
02:35:23,571 --> 02:35:24,111
in America,

2929
02:35:24,111 --> 02:35:26,660
even though you're under the shadow
of the military industrial complex,

2930
02:35:26,661 --> 02:35:30,050
is that it's fairly safe. You
know it's fairly safe. Yes, yes.

2931
02:35:30,110 --> 02:35:33,980
And every month you can't, you, you,
you know, unless you're, I mean,

2932
02:35:35,060 --> 02:35:37,220
where are you going to recreate that?
We're going to recreate that.

2933
02:35:37,221 --> 02:35:39,710
You're not going to go to an open waters
cause if you do it in international

2934
02:35:39,711 --> 02:35:41,230
waters,
what are these Somali pirate dudes?

2935
02:35:41,250 --> 02:35:43,790
You hear about that shit every day and
what do you, what are you going to do it?

2936
02:35:43,791 --> 02:35:46,640
You've got a bunch of peace
fucking floating spot out there.

2937
02:35:46,910 --> 02:35:49,310
The big concrete floating
Django with what? Paul?

2938
02:35:49,311 --> 02:35:52,340
The security guard who patrols the
perimeter. They shoot Paul on the head.

2939
02:35:52,370 --> 02:35:56,490
Fucking tig over. God dammit. Jason
Silva got to be ready for war. Yeah,

2940
02:35:56,491 --> 02:35:57,324
I know it looks,

2941
02:35:57,750 --> 02:36:00,860
I mean I think that is
obviously logistical things
that have to be addressed,

2942
02:36:00,861 --> 02:36:03,200
but it's a very ambitious idea to begin.
It's very ambitious.

2943
02:36:03,560 --> 02:36:08,000
You would have to have guns, a emote.
We have to have laser beams, right?

2944
02:36:08,230 --> 02:36:12,150
You get that trash pile it and live in
the middle of it. That's not a bad deal.

2945
02:36:12,220 --> 02:36:14,650
One wants to get near that thing here.
Hear people come in to,

2946
02:36:14,810 --> 02:36:18,230
but then we're going to get
your water from your water,

2947
02:36:18,650 --> 02:36:21,590
from the ocean desalinization course.
It's going to be a,

2948
02:36:21,890 --> 02:36:26,890
they're trying to do dean Kamen who
invented a lot of these water purification

2949
02:36:27,071 --> 02:36:27,641
systems,

2950
02:36:27,641 --> 02:36:32,641
man that you can put in like hearing
bacteria infection like poison almost into

2951
02:36:33,881 --> 02:36:36,190
the water and it comes
out like ready to drink.

2952
02:36:36,340 --> 02:36:40,060
Why we have this new unit that they're
going to be taken to like rural parts

2953
02:36:40,061 --> 02:36:41,950
around the world,
um,

2954
02:36:42,010 --> 02:36:45,370
to these little villages and that's
like the number one cause of disease and

2955
02:36:45,371 --> 02:36:47,260
illness and dirty water.
Right.

2956
02:36:47,420 --> 02:36:51,430
And these things that get these small
little self power devices and they last

2957
02:36:51,431 --> 02:36:55,090
forever and it's like Dean
came in and his water products,

2958
02:36:55,180 --> 02:36:58,560
water filtration stuff. People should
Google. He's a genius. No, no hit to,

2959
02:36:58,570 --> 02:36:59,980
he already has an like this new design.

2960
02:37:00,370 --> 02:37:01,181
I wasn't going to say that.

2961
02:37:01,181 --> 02:37:04,330
I was going to say how far are they on
the island thing? That artificial island,

2962
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:06,610
I don't know.
I think funding,

2963
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:09,880
they need funding to build a car so that
I going to pay for that. Like pitch.

2964
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:14,770
Well, philanthropists, Internet age,
billionaires, they'd be resources.

2965
02:37:14,780 --> 02:37:16,040
It would have to be a lot of money.

2966
02:37:16,041 --> 02:37:18,680
How much would it cost to build
a fake islands? I have no idea.

2967
02:37:18,830 --> 02:37:21,110
Probably a lot of fucking money, man.
Probably a lot of about a lot of money.

2968
02:37:21,260 --> 02:37:25,420
I was watching a documentary
on the uh, Japanese, um, uh,

2969
02:37:25,460 --> 02:37:28,010
airport that they had
created and that is a,

2970
02:37:28,011 --> 02:37:31,640
it's an artificial island and an
artificial island they've created,

2971
02:37:31,641 --> 02:37:33,360
but there is slowly sinking into the sea.

2972
02:37:33,361 --> 02:37:36,560
So they have this elaborate
system of lifts that as it sinks,

2973
02:37:36,561 --> 02:37:40,070
they raise it up to keep it level.
It's fucking nuts to me.

2974
02:37:40,071 --> 02:37:44,540
What a marvel of engineering, you know,
what engineering is this a magnificent,

2975
02:37:44,541 --> 02:37:46,850
when you think about it,
it's, it's, it's incredible.

2976
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:50,030
I love looking at engineering in nature
and comparing it to engineering made by

2977
02:37:50,031 --> 02:37:54,200
man and you see how they certain patterns
that that aligned and we, here we are,

2978
02:37:54,201 --> 02:37:56,630
we're like, oh, you know, we thought
of this. But then it's like, oh,

2979
02:37:56,631 --> 02:38:00,950
but matches this pattern that nature came
up with to realize is that a good idea

2980
02:38:00,951 --> 02:38:01,521
is a good idea.

2981
02:38:01,521 --> 02:38:04,940
Whether you came up with it blindly like
nature or whether you came up with it

2982
02:38:04,941 --> 02:38:09,610
consciously like, man, good idea's a
good idea. If it works, it works. That's,

2983
02:38:09,690 --> 02:38:12,110
that's what's amazing.
Have you ever seen when they take a,

2984
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:17,060
a colony of leaf cutter ants and they
expose their entire underground structure

2985
02:38:17,330 --> 02:38:19,300
by filling it with cement technology,

2986
02:38:19,790 --> 02:38:22,790
they have their own technologies
yet that's their extended phenotype.

2987
02:38:22,850 --> 02:38:25,730
It's really kind of a fucking disturbing
thing to watch though because it's kind

2988
02:38:25,731 --> 02:38:29,620
of ant genocide. You're like looking at
me and eventually cemented everybody in.

2989
02:38:29,621 --> 02:38:33,830
It is very sad. I mean it's, uh, I
don't really give a fuck about ants,

2990
02:38:34,070 --> 02:38:36,830
but it's kind of crazy that
they're willing to just
cement the shit out of their

2991
02:38:36,831 --> 02:38:40,760
houses just to find out how
big the houses. Yeah. If
you haven't seen it folks,

2992
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,270
you could just Google it. Uh, well what
does it Brian Leaf cutter ants. Just pull,

2993
02:38:44,271 --> 02:38:46,460
pull that video up because
it's astounding to look at.

2994
02:38:46,580 --> 02:38:51,260
Just pull up a leaf cutter,
ant colony exposed.

2995
02:38:51,820 --> 02:38:52,810
Um, and these, uh,

2996
02:38:52,820 --> 02:38:57,320
these scientists say they found out that
not only do they have these intricate

2997
02:38:57,321 --> 02:39:00,080
structures,
but they have events set up.

2998
02:39:00,081 --> 02:39:04,820
So where they bring in like a funguses and
things that are, that are, um, that are,

2999
02:39:04,821 --> 02:39:07,960
that are rotting. Yeah, there's
an ability for the, the, the,

3000
02:39:07,970 --> 02:39:12,970
the fucking gases to rise out through
the air pollute their little tunnels.

3001
02:39:13,431 --> 02:39:16,310
There's so much emergent
intelligence in the design,

3002
02:39:16,311 --> 02:39:19,280
but you know what the most amazing
part is? There's no one in control.

3003
02:39:19,730 --> 02:39:21,080
It's all decentralized.

3004
02:39:21,081 --> 02:39:24,920
It's all a bunch of individual local
interactions happening simultaneously that

3005
02:39:24,921 --> 02:39:28,190
together exhibit emergent
phenomenon and emergent complexity.

3006
02:39:28,220 --> 02:39:31,700
It's like bi Pi walls, tree
beehives, exhibit self,

3007
02:39:31,701 --> 02:39:35,270
organization that emerges when all these
billions of bees are working together

3008
02:39:35,271 --> 02:39:39,020
to create an intelligent behavior. But
no individual bee itself is intelligent.

3009
02:39:39,290 --> 02:39:41,990
That's amazing. Now they're saying
that our neurons are the same,

3010
02:39:42,140 --> 02:39:44,150
that we're not like a
singular consciousness,

3011
02:39:44,151 --> 02:39:48,170
but billions of non-intelligent neurons
that together create synchronous like

3012
02:39:48,171 --> 02:39:49,130
transcendent effects.

3013
02:39:49,400 --> 02:39:53,090
That a consciousness emerges from the
interactions of trillions of neurons,

3014
02:39:53,360 --> 02:39:54,021
individual,

3015
02:39:54,021 --> 02:39:56,870
local relationships happening in different
parts of the brain and then together

3016
02:39:56,871 --> 02:40:00,440
make sense. Our brains aren't
like the vigilante. Our brains,

3017
02:40:00,441 --> 02:40:04,160
our neurons are like the ant in the
ant colony and then us is the emergent

3018
02:40:04,161 --> 02:40:05,720
behavior. It's what comes out. Yeah.

3019
02:40:05,750 --> 02:40:09,860
I've always said that it's ridiculous
to think that human beings can ever be

3020
02:40:09,890 --> 02:40:12,730
separate because that's the worst thing
they could do to you in prison. Yeah.

3021
02:40:12,830 --> 02:40:15,360
The worst thing they could do to you in
prison as separate you from the general

3022
02:40:15,361 --> 02:40:18,420
population and put you in solitary.
Yeah. Nobody can talk to you.

3023
02:40:18,450 --> 02:40:20,820
You're just by yourself.
That's crazy for people. Yeah.

3024
02:40:20,940 --> 02:40:24,070
Well that is cutting your arm
off. Yes. It's, it's alien to our,

3025
02:40:24,071 --> 02:40:28,140
our goal and purpose and on our
desires on earth. 100% yeah.

3026
02:40:28,141 --> 02:40:32,730
So it's obvious that we are engineered
for a reason or at least for feedback.

3027
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:37,170
Yeah. For Interaction, interaction
and feedback. Everything
is feedback loops, dude.

3028
02:40:37,230 --> 02:40:40,470
Everything. Well that's why these kind
of conversations, it's so exciting. Yes,

3029
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:42,210
exactly. Cause you, you know, you, you,

3030
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:45,440
you turned my brain into an area that
you know, might not have gone into. Like,

3031
02:40:45,620 --> 02:40:48,270
then we start expanding in that area.

3032
02:40:48,510 --> 02:40:51,480
There's a book by Matt Ridley called
the rational optimist and he coined the

3033
02:40:51,481 --> 02:40:55,730
word idea sex. And he says that ideas
coming together and open liquid networks,

3034
02:40:55,740 --> 02:40:59,100
open channels of communications are
akin to genetic recombination in nature.

3035
02:40:59,430 --> 02:41:02,640
It's genes being in the primordial soup,
mixing and completing each other,

3036
02:41:02,641 --> 02:41:05,700
interacting and good. It's all a
giant Al's happening with ideas. Yeah.

3037
02:41:05,710 --> 02:41:08,370
Ideas are intermingling and
having sex with one another,

3038
02:41:08,490 --> 02:41:12,030
but they're creating more change in at
a rate that is unheard of by the gene

3039
02:41:12,031 --> 02:41:14,390
pool. If we could look at
the interactions of, of,

3040
02:41:14,391 --> 02:41:17,130
of human behavior and
thought and language,

3041
02:41:17,131 --> 02:41:19,440
if we could look at all that
stuff as like numbers and,

3042
02:41:19,630 --> 02:41:21,760
and look at it as like energy and,
and,

3043
02:41:21,761 --> 02:41:25,170
and something that can be
quantified instead of looking
at it as our own product.

3044
02:41:25,190 --> 02:41:28,210
Yeah. And instead of looking at it
as something that we have done right,

3045
02:41:28,260 --> 02:41:31,260
if we could just look at it entirely
of its own and we will see a completely

3046
02:41:31,261 --> 02:41:35,400
different picture away. Well if you
take the long view and Caterpillar, man,

3047
02:41:35,590 --> 02:41:37,440
we're a caterpillar about
to become a butterfly.

3048
02:41:38,440 --> 02:41:40,680
We're making some crazy
fucking cocoon right now.

3049
02:41:40,681 --> 02:41:41,610
We don't even know what we're doing,

3050
02:41:41,611 --> 02:41:44,990
which just transform everything and
we just bought, we know it's possible.

3051
02:41:45,530 --> 02:41:49,170
Caterpillar's did it. Caterpillar's
do it. So you know it exists. It does.

3052
02:41:49,171 --> 02:41:52,050
It's not beyond the laws of physics
for completely have radical self

3053
02:41:52,051 --> 02:41:53,120
transformation.
You've

3054
02:41:53,300 --> 02:41:55,290
couldn't blow my mind again man.

3055
02:41:56,890 --> 02:41:59,860
You blew everybody's mind again.
This podcast, I essentially,

3056
02:41:59,861 --> 02:42:02,710
I got to think we should stop right
there cause that's about three hours.

3057
02:42:02,770 --> 02:42:06,240
Oh well that was crazy. Wasn't it? About
three hours. Somewhere in there. Yeah.

3058
02:42:06,370 --> 02:42:10,000
Two hours, 40 minutes or something like
that. Thanks again brother. Thank you man.

3059
02:42:10,001 --> 02:42:13,870
You're very, very stimulated. Soc Two
thanks. So it's one of those are you?

3060
02:42:13,871 --> 02:42:16,520
So are you guys these conversations
and it just, you know,

3061
02:42:16,590 --> 02:42:19,990
you walk out to drive home. Just going,
what the fuck man, thanks for having me,

3062
02:42:19,991 --> 02:42:23,280
man.
You're so awesome at uh,

3063
02:42:23,440 --> 02:42:26,770
like passionately and fusing these
ideas and other people's heads.

3064
02:42:26,800 --> 02:42:29,800
Thanks brother. You know, you, you
have like a, a way of uh, you know,

3065
02:42:29,801 --> 02:42:33,650
like when you get fired up
about shit, like everybody
around you is like, oh yeah,

3066
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:36,980
yeah, yeah. Thanks man. It's infectious.
Very effective. Thanks brother.

3067
02:42:36,990 --> 02:42:37,970
And if people want to find you on Twitter,

3068
02:42:37,971 --> 02:42:41,800
it's Jason Underscore Silva if they
want to find you online. It is.

3069
02:42:41,830 --> 02:42:44,850
This is Jason silva.com and uh,

3070
02:42:44,900 --> 02:42:48,580
all of his upcoming lectures and all.
Is there anything that people can see,

3071
02:42:48,581 --> 02:42:51,820
like there are any places where are the
average person go and buy a ticket and

3072
02:42:51,821 --> 02:42:52,900
watch you perform live.

3073
02:42:53,050 --> 02:42:57,190
If the economist ideas festival happening
in Berkeley and March 28th is on

3074
02:42:57,191 --> 02:43:00,370
innovation and people can Google
economist ideas, anyone can go to that.

3075
02:43:00,371 --> 02:43:03,640
You can buy tickets for that and you
don't have to work at Google. Yes.

3076
02:43:03,641 --> 02:43:07,690
And a on April 20th, when I speak at the
national arts club, they have a website.

3077
02:43:07,691 --> 02:43:08,770
You should be able to look it up.

3078
02:43:08,771 --> 02:43:11,470
But I think it's about like dreaming
unlimited or something like that and then

3079
02:43:11,471 --> 02:43:12,070
all the New York

3080

3094
02:43:54,050 --> 02:43:58,120
a lot of other shit going on in the future
to Louisville, Kentucky. That's soon.

3095

3100
02:44:16,721 --> 02:44:18,880
is what I'm going to do.
My special, it's so cliche.

3101
02:44:19,270 --> 02:44:21,750
It's so cliche as a corny pothead,
I couldn't,

3102
02:44:21,820 --> 02:44:26,800
couldn't resist a thank you
to the fleshlight for tuning
in and saving our souls

3103
02:44:27,130 --> 02:44:29,380
with their plastic vagina.
Does that work? No.

3104
02:44:29,700 --> 02:44:30,850
I need to come up with a new commercial.

3105
02:44:31,180 --> 02:44:34,930
Thank you to the fleshlight for being
there for lonely boys being easy.

3106
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:38,980
Thank you for being, yeah, but not that
easy to clean it. A little complicated.

3107
02:44:40,060 --> 02:44:41,320
It's,
yeah,

3108
02:44:41,321 --> 02:44:44,110
you gotta you should at the end of
it should be like a garbage disposal.

3109
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:47,980
It just eats loads and then turns it into
love and sends it out to the universe.

3110
02:44:47,981 --> 02:44:52,390
It's really easy. If you'd like to
sucker. I'm come out of it. So, oh Brian.

3111
02:44:53,260 --> 02:44:57,220
So not necessary. Jason Silvas
here. He's a serious man.

3112
02:44:57,250 --> 02:45:00,250
You don't need to do that in front of him.
And you fucking freak.

3113
02:45:00,430 --> 02:45:04,830
Thank you to [inaudible] Dot Com oh
and oh yeah. Oh, uh, what did I say?

3114
02:45:04,831 --> 02:45:07,420
A fleshlight entering the
code rogue and 15% off.

3115
02:45:07,450 --> 02:45:10,000
You already know that you heard the
first half of this fucking podcast.

3116
02:45:10,150 --> 02:45:13,180
Go to [inaudible] dot com enter into
Qa rogue and save 10% there. It's over.

3117
02:45:13,181 --> 02:45:18,010
It's done. Tomorrow we have Aubrey, Mike,
Marcus, uh, formerly known as the artist,

3118
02:45:18,011 --> 02:45:21,310
formerly known as Chris, who's our
friend who changed his fucking name.

3119
02:45:21,311 --> 02:45:22,210
That's how hard he tripped.

3120
02:45:22,600 --> 02:45:27,280
He went to a Peru Dude Iowasca and changed
his fucking name. You know, I have,

3121
02:45:27,281 --> 02:45:30,330
I have a friend who did that
to my friend the line. Yeah,

3122
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:32,590
that Iowasca Oka fuck you up son.

3123
02:45:32,740 --> 02:45:36,580
And Aubrey just got back from Costa
Rica where he went through a series of

3124
02:45:36,581 --> 02:45:39,630
Ibogaine experience and now his
name is optimus prime. Yeah.

3125
02:45:39,650 --> 02:45:42,150
Now he's Mr Manhattan. And uh, we'll,

3126
02:45:42,151 --> 02:45:45,730
we'll get to meet him tomorrow and he's
going to explain to us what the fuck is

3127
02:45:45,731 --> 02:45:47,950
really going on with this
crazy universe we're living.

3128
02:45:48,100 --> 02:45:50,440
Everything that has not been covered
today will be covered tomorrow.

3129
02:45:50,441 --> 02:45:53,370
And then on Wednesday, we get
Matt from a hoarder's, uh,

3130
02:45:53,480 --> 02:45:55,660
is clutter cleaner on Twitter,

3131
02:45:55,661 --> 02:45:58,120
and he's the guy who cleans
up the crazy people's houses.

3132
02:45:58,390 --> 02:46:01,090
And I'm really fascinated by that because
I've got a bit of a hoarder in me.

3133
02:46:01,310 --> 02:46:03,460
Just a pinch. You do as well? Yeah. Yeah.

3134
02:46:03,550 --> 02:46:06,100
So we'll find out what that fucking
psychosis all about. Jason Silva,

3135
02:46:06,270 --> 02:46:10,850
you are the man, sir. You
are the man. Thank you guys.
You, everybody. We love you.

3136
02:46:10,851 --> 02:46:11,511
Dirty bitches.

So if you want to get on this shit, a
