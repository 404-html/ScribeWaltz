1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,030
Yeah.
Ah,

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,060
what does that, it's breathing. It's
power breeding folks into the nose,

3
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:13,950
out through the mouth. I thought
you were about to finish. No,

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,630
that's not how I roll. I'm more
grunt. Like it's more primal and sad.

5
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:22,500
Ultimately the Joe Rogan experience on
a quest for enlightenment is just trying

6
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:23,334
to get rid of loads.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,780
The Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by
speaking to getting rid of

8
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:28,440
loads.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,440
The fleshlight fleshlight is
the number one sex toy for men.

10
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:38,631
It has a very unique blend of shit
that was pulled out of the earth and

11
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:42,660
converted firms and spicy oil and,

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,680
and petrol chemicals into
some crazy fake pussy tissue.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,450
That is outstanding.
It really does work.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,520
And we have to be honest here.

15
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:58,080
And the honesty is you've got an a fucking
masturbator right? And if you're not,

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,210
if you're not only not
being honest with yourself,

17
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,400
you're not being kind to yourself.
What do you want to do?

18
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:04,830
You want to walk around confused all day?

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,290
Do you walk around tortured
by the thoughts of sex?

20
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,490
Just some physical act that you need
to accomplish and why? So sir, why?

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,690
I'll tell you why,

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,670
because you got this crazy body that
used to be a monkey body 10,000 years ago

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,180
were essentially the same except we
were running from saber tooth tigers.

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,220
I'll get where that same body and that
same body didn't have vaccines and they

25
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:29,400
didn't have doctors. It
didn't have anything, so he'd
fucking died off like crazy.

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,770
So in order to keep the population live,

27
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,080
it's engineered inside of us
that we have to fuck a lot.

28
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,560
And you can do that and you can choose
to do that and you can be that guy.

29
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,620
Primates did it with frogs. Yeah,
you can do with polyurethane. Yep,

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,720
exactly. What I'm, when I'm
advising is just body maintenance,

31
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:45,790
ladies and gentlemen,
and,

32
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:50,791
and get away from this crazy puritanical
idea that we're not supposed to discuss

33
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:55,580
masturbation and that men aren't supposed
to have awesome sex toys like the

34
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:57,770
fleshlight.
All right ladies,

35
00:01:57,771 --> 00:02:02,771
you're vibrators in your dildos have
been a source of humor for years.

36
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,400
He, he ha ha, I'll just use my vibrator.
And that seems to be okay with you.

37
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,350
That's like some sort of an empowerment,

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,430
but yet a man buying a flashlight is
to be ridiculous. Ridiculed. Okay.

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,880
We need the fan belt car battery driven.

40
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:20,380
Fleshlight cause they have
fucking machines but guys
don't necessarily have it.

41
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,470
Man. You don't want to get addicted. If
you ever met a girl to addicted to her,

42
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,330
I was trying to help you sell
a flashlight. That's all I
hear you. Thank you. Yeah.

43
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:29,150
And it kills it because they get
addicted to that more than sex.

44
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:33,270
Like that sensation is, it's better
than a dick just slowly sliding in you.

45
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:36,920
You're like, it's, it sucks. You can
fuck your pussy up forever. It is true.

46
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,000
It is real. I, I have met girls who are
very honest about it. He said, you know,

47
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:43,970
their husband can't get them off anymore.
They have to use a vibrator.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,370
And you're like, wow,
what happened? I've never,

49
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,960
never actually been with a girl like
that, but I was scared of him. Man. If I,

50
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,710
if I talk to some girl and you know,
we're,

51
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:54,290
we're getting to know each other
and she was like, you know, hey,

52
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,160
I'm just really into vibrators and
she'll let you know like right up front I

53
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:57,600
collect,

54
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,520
have you seen my double tapered
vibrating colossal Qing Dong?

55
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,030
It's like, you know that scares me.
She's used to flying at high g's.

56
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,640
You know the thing that a
vibrator can do to you, it's just,

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,760
it's just a totally different thing.

58
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,820
Like that's an artificial thing that
you've become addicted to honey.

59
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,930
So I don't want that.

60
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,290
So I don't think that I need anything
other than what the f I think the

61
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,140
flashlight is perfect. I don't even think
they need to innovate. How about that?

62
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,690
Go to Joe rogan.net.
Click on the link for the flashlight.

63
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,950
Use the code name Rogan and save yourself
15% off the number one sex toy format.

64
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:30,970
So they,

65
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,580
and they did, they do have sex toys for
women now they actually have, Lilo is air,

66
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:38,300
which is like some of the, the high end
Porsche versions of vibrators for women.

67
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,140
So wow. Fuck your pussy up of those. So
there you go. You can get that too. Yeah.

68
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,240
If you're really into that, we really
want to break that day, you know.

69
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,560
Do you know Sam triple? He's actually
doing something with flashlight, isn't it?

70
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,370
Yeah,
he's tall.

71
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,550
He's doing like a man on the street
thing at comic con with reflecting is

72
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:55,520
perfect for that Sam
Tripoli's and as an animal,

73
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,880
he's doing men on the street
with flashlights. Yeah. I
don't know what that means,

74
00:03:58,881 --> 00:03:59,220
but

75
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,360
Oh gee, Microsoft, uh, really a
runtime error. You got it too. Yes.

76
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,770
I got one today. Abnormal program
termination halfway. You go fuck yourself.

77
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,360
Listen, we love these alien alien
where computers are bad ass.

78
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:14,850
And I like them because the
Alienware sponsors MMA fighters.

79
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:18,570
And if you're really into games,
and I must admit I'm not anymore,

80
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,960
but fucking God damn. If I was,
this thing would be amazing.

81
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:25,500
You play anything on this and high
resolution, high screen, high frame rates.

82
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,650
I'm playing portal two in three
D, right? That's fucking bad ass.

83
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:33,330
But everything around it drives me crazy.
Microsoft could suck a dick man.

84
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,200
To be fair.
She never alien.

85
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,490
Where'd it was not responsible for that
runtime error in any way, shape or form.

86
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,540
Some way it's,

87
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,820
it's hard to believe how many
viruses there are for Microsoft,

88
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:45,780
for windows.

89
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,800
When you look at it online and like the
actual numbers of viruses that exist,

90
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,000
you go, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait
a minute. It's like the blood is this,

91
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,280
this is,
this is craziness.

92
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,330
There are hundreds of
thousands of viruses,

93
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,940
hundreds of thousands of
things that you can get.

94
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:05,550
Many of them html based viruses.
Sure.

95
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:08,640
We just have to click on a link and boom,
you're fucking cool.

96
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,540
In fact, you just want to chat
with a hot single in your area.

97
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,930
Suddenly your entire email address is
owned by somebody in Czechoslovakia,

98
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,830
so I did something pretty
cool to recently to my Mac.

99
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,980
There's a program that Norton gives
out in the APP store that's free in it

100
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,950
detects for malware and viruses
and everything like that.

101
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,910
Now I have malware,
malware and it's, well,

102
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:36,380
it's like a bunch of shipping
bills. Ed's coming to me.

103
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,140
I'm not used to saying it because
I'd never have to deal with that. No,

104
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:40,880
it's not a word you say. No, you're right.

105
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,610
I don't think I've ever said it
before either. Honestly. I have about,

106
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,380
I don't know,
five computers,

107
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:49,370
MACs and most of them are
just the dirtiest Max ever.

108
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:54,230
Like downloading the grossest worst
torrents and crap and nasty shit I had

109
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:58,130
downloaded on all of my
computers and I ran and now

110
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,050
not even one little baby thing.

111
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,730
No virus, nothing. I don't know.

112
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,110
People will talk a lot of shit
like people that are in windows,

113
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,740
Mac and cheese get viruses too and
you're like, just name one name one.

114
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,970
Did they ever really come up with

115
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,000
Kevin would know all about this?
They certainly, we should hold this.

116
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,473
That's,
I was being quick.

117
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,240
That's the problem with doing these
commercials like this and he said they

118
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:23,990
become sometimes a podcast in
the middle of a commercial.

119
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,310
That's what they're kind of good
though. Awesome. Yeah, that's true.

120
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:31,070
Alienware invest. Well alienware's
isn't even our sponsor. They just said

121
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,560
a company called Sucker
Punch entertainment and it's
got a sweet deal on these

122
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,191
laptops.

123
00:06:35,191 --> 00:06:40,140
I did it specifically to try to support
a company that supports MMA because

124
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:43,050
these guys sponsor a lot of up
and coming fighters and it's cool.

125
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,100
I think that's huge. So, uh, you
know, but Microsoft can suck a dick.

126
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,710
Yeah,
I said it.

127
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,460
I might turn this to tap in a tablet
and that tablet can suck my dick,

128
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,380
whatever that tablet,
Microsoft, but the new surface.

129
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,360
Why are you mad at the surface? And
we need to start. I was like, come on.

130
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,780
We need to, we need to get the
music going. We also sponsor,

131
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,950
we're also sponsored by [inaudible]
dot com on nootropics. I love them.

132
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,870
You can try this stuff and make him
your cell phone lines. You can do that

133
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,350
kettle bells now and battle ropes. I
just got my battle ropes in the male son.

134
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,360
I should make a video showing a video
of me hulking out with the battle ropes.

135
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,513
I've got do that.

136
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,340
It's an APP that's malware bitch
malware, detect malware. And it's um,

137
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,240
if you've, if you've never
done kettlebells before,
it's, you should really,

138
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,230
if you can, you should get personal
instruction. That's what I believe.

139
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,430
If there's a gym near you or a crossfit
gym where they could show you the right

140
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:42,971
way to do it.

141
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:47,971
I've had the very good fortune to have
had a few different instructors and have

142
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:50,950
someone physically there.
It makes a big difference.

143
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
There's plenty of videos though online.

144
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:56,470
As long as you start out with very
manageable weights and believe it or not,

145
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,280
you can get a great workout.
I can still to this day,

146
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:02,170
even though I've been lifting kettle
bells for years with one 35 pound

147
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:02,670
Kettlebell,

148
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,590
I mean there's this crazy workout that
this guy has that I have no affiliation

149
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:05,741
with.

150
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:09,460
It's called the extreme kettlebell cardio
workout and I've said this and now his

151
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:14,040
DVD is totally sold out everywhere. It's
really hard to find now. And, and I,

152
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,050
I it's that good though. It's
not good. This guy should,

153
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,160
he should get all that money in more for
free. For me, it's, it's, it's amazing.

154
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:26,020
I recommend it to everybody all the time
because it is one of the most brutal 40

155
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:29,800
minute workout ever and it's one 30
pound Kettlebell, 35 pound countable

156
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,710
seems like nothing. The first
couple times you do it, it's like,

157
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,490
well you're activating every muscle
in secondary movers for balance.

158
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:39,370
You're constantly engaged head to toe,
you're using your hold,

159
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,580
but the concept behind kettle bells is
that you're using your whole body as one

160
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:46,880
unit as opposed to things like a lot
of people like they think of lifting

161
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:50,750
weights is like bicep
curls or tricep extensions.

162
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:55,751
That's actually kind of an unnatural
way to exercise and it actually usually

163
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:59,650
creates imbalances because if
you're not, you know, real careful,

164
00:08:59,651 --> 00:09:01,680
like if you do a lot of quad exercises,

165
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:05,720
you got to do hamstring exercises to fuel
on a biceps. You have to do trust them.

166
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,610
So I get, and then you also probably
have to balance your backout as well.

167
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,211
Like your,

168
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:14,211
your whole body as a whole is a much
better option using your body as a whole.

169
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:17,400
And you can do it with less weight, which
it's a really amazing thing. It does.

170
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:19,280
You're conditioning your,

171
00:09:19,281 --> 00:09:24,030
your weightlifting and your conditioning
all in one big group instead of a,

172
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,230
the way most people do it,

173
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,130
like by breaking things up and sets
it's way more fun and it translates to

174
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:30,780
anything you were trying to do,
like physical,

175
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:34,830
if you have a sport that you're trying
to do that involves strength and a and

176
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:38,640
speed endurance, kettlebells will
help you fucking tremendously.

177
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,490
So we just started carrying them. There's
a bunch of great deals on them. Um,

178
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,470
we're, we're selling them literally
as cheap as we can sell them there.

179
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,770
It's really the like, oh
dude, it's ridiculous.

180
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,330
The logistics of a small
company like on it, you know,

181
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,020
I mean basically we've only been
around for like a year. You know,

182
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:56,070
a company like this,

183
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,880
it was mostly selling nutrients to all
of a sudden goes to selling these fucking

184
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:02,250
cannon balls.
These things are huge,

185
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,730
but they're the best quality you can buy.

186
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,780
Are you guys drop shipping them or you
have like storage space now and you're

187
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:09,614
buying

188
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,690
storage space? The whole
thing. It's crazy. Yeah. It's,
um, you know, it's, it's,

189
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,610
there's a lot involved in it,

190
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,840
but what we're concerned with is that
we're selling you the best shit available.

191
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,230
And these kettlebells or York kettle
bells or the best kettle bells you can buy

192
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:26,240
their fucking perfect. I have
him in my house. They're,

193
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:30,730
they're absolutely perfect and
they'll last for a million years.

194
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,010
They're cast iron.
You don't need a gym.

195
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,580
You need a couple of these kettle bells
and some youtube videos and you will

196
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:39,460
have workouts for the rest
of your fucking life. I mean,

197
00:10:39,461 --> 00:10:43,900
there's a million free videos out
there showing all sorts of different

198
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,040
exercises. People, you know,
put themselves to these
crazy crossfit routines.

199
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,020
And there's,
there's high weight,

200
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:53,680
low rep routines and there's
every kind of exercise.

201
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:57,730
All you need to do is look online
anyway on a.com is where it's at.

202
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,670
Get the kettle bells.
We have the battle ropes and,

203
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,150
and when it comes to nootropics,
any of the things that,

204
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,810
whether it's Alpha brain or a shroom
tech sport, which is an awesome uh,

205
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,340
endurance supplement
or shroom tech immune,

206
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:12,520
which is a supplement that actually
contains a mushroom that tricks your body

207
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:14,410
into thinking that it's got a cold.

208
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,800
So your body fires up its immune system
thinking that the mushroom is like a,

209
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,210
like a cold, but it's not, you're
just over clock and your body. Yeah.

210
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:25,600
You just giving your body something
leaves your body like gets pumped up for a

211
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,950
fight. That never happens. And so you
know, if you come into a common cold,

212
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,430
you when to find a better chance.

213
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,520
Don't, don't keep your on, don't
keep your on it products in your car.

214
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,990
If it's hot outside by the way,

215
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:42,010
because it melts into like an on
it ball and I knew she'd just take,

216
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:46,780
just take the whole fall, stuff it up
your ass. Take it anal like an apple.

217
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,880
That's how you eat your apples
up your ass. No, no, no.

218
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,040
Eat it takes her as asshole like a
horses mouth. He's got a feed bag

219
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,520
hanging over it right now.
It's got a tongue. Whoa,
settle the fuck down kid. Uh,

220
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,433
anyway,
uh,

221
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,130
use the code Dean Brogan and you will
save yourself 10% off any and all

222
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:06,220
supplements. Uh, there's
100% money back guarantee.

223
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:09,280
If you order a shroom tech,
have you ordered Alpha brain,

224
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:11,230
whatever you ordered the first 30 pills,

225
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,350
if you decide that it doesn't do as
advertised or do a enough to satisfy you,

226
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,030
you just say the stuff socks and
you get 100% of your money back.

227
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,260
You don't have to return the product.

228
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,670
We're way more concerned with making
sure that nobody feels ripped off and way

229
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:29,671
more concerned that everything that we
sell has to be something that I 100%

230
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:34,300
totally believe in. And so that's
why we have this set in place.

231
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:38,430
So let's say it's as easy as possible to
get your money back, right? That's it.

232
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:39,760
Pitches.
Do you have the music?

233
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Kevin Pereira is here a free man
out in the sphere of the world.

234
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,660
No longer under any type of contracts

235
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,213
all day.

236
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,970
Dj Brian does it. Yen in the MIB. Amen.

237
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,800
He's silly bitch.
How dare you.

238
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:11,230
I dare you come up with new ways
to be silly ladies. Gentleman,

239
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,930
Kevin prayers here. Brian. We for
sure on the right channel. Yeah,

240
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,550
I ladies and gentlemen,
we know for sure we're on the right show.

241
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,980
That same shit scares the fuck out
of me. What just happened? Right?

242
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:24,440
Time error like jasmine pop up,

243
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,780
new stuff that we got ahold of
this new uh, new God powder. Yeah.

244
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,400
This new mothers creation. There's a,
it's a, it's a type of pod called Sativa.

245
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,270
You know what that is, right? I've
heard of it a little bit about that.

246
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,250
I read a Wiki or to have
it on the interwebs. This,
it's called sage. Yes. The,

247
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,370
the name of this one particular strain.
It's,

248
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:48,800
it doesn't seem like
Potts should be different.

249
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,430
That one should really have that
much of a different impact on you.

250
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,750
But some of 'em, some of 'em man, you get
ahold of me and go, okay, what's this?

251
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,130
Yeah,
what the Hell is this?

252
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,750
It's like, it's like when
you, when you, you know,

253
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:04,190
you get Tequila blackout a few times
and someone introduces you to whiskey.

254
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,870
Now this is, this is supposed
to be the same exact thing.

255
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,780
Yeah. But it's completely
different. How is that, man,

256
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:13,700
why is Tequila different than
whiskey? Is it because, uh,

257
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,620
most people want to say that alcohol is
just alcohol and if you're drunk on wine,

258
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:22,330
you're drunk and beer. It's
all the same. Yeah. I don't,

259
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,030
but it doesn't seem to be that.
What does that, it doesn't at all.

260
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,690
I mean, it's gotta be because of the,
I'm trying to think of the environment.

261
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,990
Like let's say normally when you have
Tequila, I would say you're probably, um,

262
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,930
you're probably gonna have a shitty
Mexican restaurant somewhere, right?

263
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,020
There's a Mariachi music in
the background and you're,

264
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:43,770
you're all those senses combined give
you a very different drunk feel. Right?

265
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,380
Not True at all. I've had Tequila in
multiple settings. It's the same filthy,

266
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,020
vomiting, blackout high.
For me, it's a dangerous is

267
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,930
due. Like I can't drink it. It's, there's
something about decision making. This is,

268
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,040
I like looking at it and I go like,
this is going to be four days of hell.

269
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,580
Yeah. Being drunk, man.

270
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,670
What a fucking weird idea to take humans
and they voluntarily inject something

271
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:11,120
into their system,

272
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:16,121
swallow something that tastes awful and
all just to be free of themselves for a

273
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:17,224
little bit.
Yup.

274
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,720
In the fact that that is the one that
you and I can go easily and quickly and

275
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:27,220
legally consume and then get behind
the wheel of a car and do all sorts of

276
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,730
tragic stuff that is just
murderous and torturous to society.

277
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,760
And yet that is the one
that is completely legal.

278
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,810
It's so hilarious that our system is set
up this way in this day and age and the

279
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,430
base of the past when they
could lie and what we,

280
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,600
but now that we have on the information,
the fact that it's set up like this,

281
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:46,540
like you mother.

282
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,160
Well, and the fact that,
look, I don't give, I hate
political polls. I hate polling.

283
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:53,440
I don't trust any of that shit.
I never get called for him.

284
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:55,720
I don't know anybody else that does not.
Apparently they're pulling the nation,

285
00:15:55,721 --> 00:16:00,160
but the majority of this country actually
wants it to be decriminalized and

286
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:03,730
legalize. And even with all the Info
and the political weight behind it,

287
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,500
not going to happen anytime.

288
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,690
Yeah.
And,

289
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,150
and what you were saying about Paul's like
who the fuck is answering those poles?

290
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,350
Who's the people who still answer their
phones when they get a call on their

291
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,323
landline?

292
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,850
Maybe youth there QBC and take another
Werther's original and take a poll.

293
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,650
What the fuck is taking polls really
pulls him was one of the most ridiculous

294
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:25,530
things ever. Because all you're
going to get is people that are busy

295
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,280
and it's just people that have
nothing to do. You're on TMZ.

296
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:34,930
Do you ever do the polls? What
are the polls like? Is She hot?

297
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:39,460
Is she not well, those poles
matter in this world. I can.

298
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:40,660
Those kinds of posts are
the ones that matter.

299
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,340
No Man, I don't, I don't go on
any poles. I'm not, I don't,

300
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,220
I'm not fucking filling anything out.
I know I'm not no interest,

301
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,310
no interest to ask.
Yes. Consumer questions.

302
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,740
When I, when I'm on like the, when I'm
on the telephone and it pops up with the,

303
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,830
hey, if we press one, if you're okay
with a three to five minute survey,

304
00:16:57,831 --> 00:17:01,790
at the end of this call, I go, yeah, I'll
press one. Because in my head somewhere,

305
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,450
a flag pops up on a computer
and tell somebody that my call,

306
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,480
he's going to lead to feedback.
I don't actually take the survey,

307
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,100
but I go out of my way
to say it. Yeah, yeah.

308
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll take the survey after the call and
you just become a random in the system.

309
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,480
Probably. I'm a, I'm a ghost in the
machine somewhere, number generator,

310
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:22,100
and you just fucking with their
numbers pretty much for no reason.

311
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:26,090
You hacked her numbers. You know when
those cars are in the, in the malls w uh,

312
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,140
that,
uh,

313
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,850
like it says like sign up to win this
car that's signing up to become on the

314
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,070
worst spam mailing list ever.

315
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:37,850
You'll start getting phone calls and spam
your business card in the fishbowl at

316
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:39,410
a restaurant or is there like,
you're just,

317
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:41,060
you're just giving away
your info at that point.

318
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,010
You're saying please mark the tiny,
somebody did that,

319
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:45,350
did that for a living and he says,
dude,

320
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:50,040
they just make so much money cause
collecting like hundreds and of people's

321
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,680
complete like information addresses.

322
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:55,260
Everything they do is they,

323
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:59,100
you have to fill this shit out and then
you put it in and it's worth it for them

324
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:01,320
to give away a car to get
all that information yet.

325
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,660
But by the time they get enough,

326
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:08,130
they're selling your information and
getting a lot of money in that car.

327
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:10,170
Is it nothing to the amount of money?

328
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:12,570
It's worth thousands and
thousands of people's information.

329
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,280
How do you think they'd do it?

330
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:17,280
Do you think they'd go to have like
Volvo and make a deal and they say,

331
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:20,400
hey listen, we're going to give your car
away. I think they go and they say, Ah,

332
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,930
this $20,000 car or the $70,000
cars going to be an investment of x,

333
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:28,020
we're going to get y for their
data that that's a done deal.

334
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:29,880
They'll just buy the car and
set up something like that.

335
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,010
So you don't even think they
do it through the car company?

336
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,580
I think they just buy it. They'd probably
go to some sweet promotional discount.

337
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:39,480
They'd probably get refurbished cars
somehow. Cardone's he's themselves.

338
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:40,500
We'll do that just to get,

339
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:43,380
collect data on people who are interested
in that vehicle and willing to go out

340
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:45,750
of their way to look at it.
So they're doing it themselves.

341
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,930
There's independent companies that are
doing it, selling it to them. Right.

342
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:53,340
But when you have like a Cadillac CTSV
showcased in a mall and then you can win

343
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:57,090
that. I think I've got to think
Cadillac is paying for that. No, no,

344
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:59,980
but in some cases, yeah, I
bet some pilot times. Yeah.

345
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,970
Like if there's a new car that just
came out and they're trying to draw

346
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:04,980
attention to it, then they might
work something about the mall.

347
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:06,210
But if you go to most malls,

348
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,070
it's just some random cars sitting there
and it's like win a trip to Hawaii or

349
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:11,640
something like that.
Does.

350
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,430
The pro tip is when you meet
somebody you don't like in this life,

351
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:18,510
when you're networking or whatever,
the pro tip and real life in life, man,

352
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:21,270
it's a real life pro tip, right?
As a wall hacking and battlefield,

353
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:22,760
this shit's gonna help you
out in real life. Okay.

354
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,010
What does it take the business card to
someone you absolutely hate when you're

355
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:28,970
networking and just make sure you toss
it and all of those balls at the malls do

356
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,180
make copies of it. Yes, absolutely. Spread
there. Cause this quarter and everyone,

357
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,060
why do you have a stack
of my business cards?

358
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,890
Just want to let people know
you're awesome. Yeah. I'm
your number one fan bro.

359
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,110
Jesus Christ. Yeah. It's a
weird thing that people want
to collect that much data,

360
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:48,300
isn't it?
That's that's what's important.

361
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:51,960
You're reaching the most amount of people.
We ain't able to sell them things.

362
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,160
Being able to convince them
to sell you a sell you things.

363
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,370
What the fuck do you think is going on
in Nigeria that makes them so good at

364
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:00,204
scamming?

365
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,190
I mean there's one place in Africa that's
like really known for crashing dudes

366
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,110
thinking that it's like a girl and
it's just a Nigerian man behind it.

367
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,400
It's like tricking or my, the, the, the,

368
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:15,930
the high priest of the land or whatever
has millions of dollars tied up in a

369
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:19,470
bank account. We just need $10,000 and
a little info from you to get it out.

370
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,640
Those kinds of scams as well.

371
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,850
I bet they have just like
endless pictures of a woman.

372
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,740
I would say that's what they started so
they can, here's me here, here's me there.

373
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,740
You know, you could just, I love the
people that fuck with the scammers back.

374
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:34,220
Have you seen those sites? Yes. Look,

375
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,650
we would really love to
give you $1 million and we
haven't, we're ready to do it.

376
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:41,820
We just need you to get completely
replace your mouth with stalag tights.

377
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,330
If you could just get that operation
done or put diamonds in all of your teeth

378
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:47,010
and then record yourself
singing the, uh, the, the,

379
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,530
the theme tobacco back to
life for facts of life. They,

380
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,530
they're like make them go out of their
way to do crazy shit to release the money.

381
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,720
Oh yeah. Really? Yeah. And
I sent an email, they'll
sing songs and record video.

382
00:20:57,721 --> 00:21:01,180
Someone had them shoot like promos
wearing specific like tee shirts and stuff

383
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:02,860
for his company. It was great.
He scanned the scammers.

384
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,500
How many times have the
scammers one though?

385
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:09,310
I mean they must enough to make it worth
doing time and time again and still do

386
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,320
it from this day and age.
How many things are doing it?

387
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,520
Do you think it's like a real business
in Nigeria? I would assume so.

388
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:18,940
I mean if gold farming and Diablo
can be an industry in China,

389
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,810
you know like that was the game
came out on the day it was released.

390
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:26,260
There were bots and they were communities
and there were sites to all the non

391
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:28,510
dorks. Exactly what you
mean. So, uh, all right.

392
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:33,430
So when see us folks,
when we were busy not having sex,

393
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,210
we figured out games to play and
Diablo is one of them. And you can buy,

394
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:40,810
there's a real money and
a virtual currency auction
house in the game so you can

395
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:45,260
use that currency to buy new stabs and
swords and pieces of armor and flair and

396
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,890
it'll give you a poison resistances.
It's really intricate shit,

397
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,860
very important stuff.
So you can use that goal to get it,

398
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:54,160
but some gamers don't want to spend the
time or they just want to buy a brand

399
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:56,140
new character so they can
go kill the whatever boss.

400
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,870
So they're willing to pent
spend $10 of real world money.

401
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:02,770
So someone needs to create a bank
for that and they create these,

402
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:05,750
these systems where they farm for gold
and they do it in a bunch of games to do

403
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:05,930
well.

404
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,490
The Warcraft they do in Diablo pretty
much any game that has a currency online.

405
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,850
There's a secondary marketplace where
people are grinding through the game,

406
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:16,630
doing repetitive things that are known
to give you a lot of that currency so

407
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:20,800
they can sell it back on the market
low and there's entire warehouses,

408
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:24,550
cyber cafes, you name it. Full operations
where people are employed to just click,

409
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:24,761
click,

410
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:28,810
click through any given game
to get virtual currency so
they can sell it back to

411
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,170
people that are and inflate it slightly
and played it for our way to show where

412
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:36,550
there was a couple that had a child and
they were both addicted to some game.

413
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,900
Oh and remember what the game was.

414
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,730
But it was one of the saddest things
in the world to watch this couple like

415
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:47,410
argue over who has to watch the kid
while they're playing their fucking game.

416
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,700
Their debt. Sheldon had died. Yeah.

417
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,330
Cause parents neglected down
playing starcraft or world
of Warcraft. Yeah, it's,

418
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,670
it's so frightening.
Yeah.

419
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,340
Well what they need to do is give the
kid an iPad so they can farm along with

420
00:22:57,341 --> 00:23:01,510
Mommy and daddy's wasted process.
Like get that kid working.

421
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,270
It's so bizarre though. The pull is
so strong that it's really like it.

422
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:08,530
It's just like a drug. You could
call it a drug. Absolutely.

423
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,000
The addictions to video games are very
drug like any addiction to anything.

424
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,990
I mean you can,

425
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,780
people will find it in a way to be
addicted to whatever it is they want to be

426
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:19,330
addicted to and it's just as bad,
just as deadly,

427
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:23,320
just as caustic as anything else.
Funny what a weird animal we are,

428
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,540
where we can get addicted to doing things,

429
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,170
not just like not just sensations
that are caused by drugs,

430
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,890
but we can get addicted to doing thing.
Creatures of habit like I,

431
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,690
how much of your life is on autopilot?

432
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,840
I mean you lead a pretty diverse life
where you're doing different things at

433
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:40,900
different times, but the essential
is of your life. Like some,

434
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:44,410
some people will tell you that 80% of
like a relationship in life is autopilot.

435
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,220
That you're really only living 20% of
any given like longterm relationship

436
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:52,640
because you established such patterns
with yourself and with your job and with

437
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,800
your loved ones that
that Shit's on autopilot.

438
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,670
You're really only commanding 20% at
any given time when you decide to do

439
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:02,150
something out of the norm. That was,
that was a stat that was told to me,

440
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,730
and I kind of believe it.
I don't know if 80 is right,

441
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,210
but how much of your life is actually kind
of on autopilot if you think about it?

442
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,330
Yeah.
Well,

443
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:13,080
I think for a lot of folks it's the
easiest way to get through the day too.

444
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:18,000
If you're doing the commute every day,
hour and a half to the office,

445
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,880
you know some people,
it's really an hour in the morning.

446
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,660
Every morning just stuck,
stuck every day for an hour.

447
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,000
Some people commute four to six
hours to come in from long island.

448
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:30,990
Do you ever see that that hall coming
in from Long Island to Manhattan?

449
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:34,200
Holy Shit, I did that once at nine
o'clock in the morning and I was like,

450
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:38,640
this can't be real. This is no way.
This is real. You make everybody stop.

451
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,690
No wonder why this sucks and the
whole thing of tolls. By the way,

452
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:47,160
what a fuck?
What a fuck tolls are

453
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,710
paid to have this bridge installed and
now we're going to charge you every time

454
00:24:50,711 --> 00:24:51,544
you drive on it

455
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,840
off the bridge.

456
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:57,290
But we kind of like you paying us every
week and we're pretty sure you're just

457
00:24:57,291 --> 00:25:00,350
going to keep doing it.
So toll,

458
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,840
and that's one of the reasons
why Manhattan's traffic,

459
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:07,130
it's so fucking brutal as you're paying
tolls all over the place tolls to get in

460
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,860
from long island,
it's toll from Jersey.

461
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:12,740
There's this fucking totals
all over to me and it's just,

462
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,160
and they're like 10 bucks, right? Some
of them. Yeah. So we had like 10 bucks,

463
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:19,970
nine bucks, 10 bucks to do,
go over on my country bridge.

464
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,930
That is corruption of bridge that fuse
paid for it already paid. That's the,

465
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,380
you paid for it as well. Like
yes, it's already paid for.

466
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,770
You paid for it half the time.
As a tax payer,

467
00:25:29,771 --> 00:25:32,660
it's a great way to generate revenue.
Right?

468
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,050
Isn't that a funny way of saying
it should be okay to rip you off,

469
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,250
rip you off and fuck up
traffic for everybody because
we will have more cutting

470
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:41,520
money and it's,
I like it.

471
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,380
The Tsa,
like we paid,

472
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,260
we've paid billions if not trillions of
dollars for this institution to erode

473
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,540
our own freedoms to grope us.

474
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:52,320
We paid for the privilege of longer
lines and radiation. That's insane.

475
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:56,100
And now I'm, well they did a
couple of pilot programs to like,

476
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,320
it was basically like a fast
lane through the Tsa Shit,

477
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,180
but she had to sign up and
some of them you had to pay.

478
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,530
So we had to pay for the institution
which degrades us and slows us down and we

479
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:07,350
can pay extra to bypass
it in a quicker way.

480
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,880
Well they need need to find out that
you're not a creep that's there.

481
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:14,250
Their re justification.
That's the justification.

482
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:16,240
Do a background check
on you and go well Kev,

483
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,740
a prayer or you've been in a federal
penitentiary seven times for selling

484
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:20,574
crystal meth.

485
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,240
We want to make sure you can still fly
southwest crystal meth in your underwear

486
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,200
though.

487
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,430
You've got weird baggies that show up
on our scans taped to your ball sack.

488
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,050
You want to explain,
sir?

489
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,350
First of all, those are feed. I eat
through my asshole. It's like a horse.

490
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,830
I feed it apples before every flight.
I learned about it from Brian

491
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,960
having a hand, having black math
taped to your balls. There's no,

492
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,100
you could say,
wait

493
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,990
a minute, we're the fuck.
How'd that get there?

494
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,910
This is someone else had to this bag, sir.
There's no fucking way that was there,

495
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:54,090
man. I can't even believe this
is real. What's going on, man?

496
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,540
Do you guys do something to me? I always
love that unconscious when it's like, oh,

497
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:59,100
we found this crack
pipe in your glove box.

498
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,740
Although I don't even know what that is.
It's got your initials on it.

499
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,180
Well that's, that's a coincidence.
That's not even, yeah man. It's Jr.

500
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:09,360
There's a lot of jail,
a whole lot of them Jr Roblin.

501
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,260
How would it you say your name? That's
the meth addict cousin of JK Rowling.

502
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,720
That one? Yeah. Harry Potter
didn't have any magic.

503
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,070
She was just tripping on trucker math

504
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,660
truck or there's a big sign in Santa
Monica Boulevard in Hollywood. I was, um,

505
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,690
I was driving down Santa Monica and
there's a huge billboard that says,

506
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:34,620
do you have a problem with meth?
And it just shows a guy,

507
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:39,210
like a regular guy, just his
face, like, Oh shit, I'm on math.

508
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,030
And I'm looking at, I'm like, wow,
how many people are on method?

509
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,600
They need to have a bill burri and
there's that billboard going to help you.

510
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,870
If you're on math, you're not
going to look up and go, oh my God,

511
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:53,700
I'm the billboard guy. I
should really stop this here.

512
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:56,120
Call this number, call this is my
room. And then when I got to do it,

513
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,730
I'll give you money.
No watching it.

514
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,010
You get me off math watching pieces of
your own face fall off at like a public

515
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:03,630
restroom mirror that's cracked.

516
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,600
It smells like urine when you look at
that and go, this met things. All right,

517
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,390
but oh my God, I'm on a billboard
now. I need to stop this.

518
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,260
Does anybody do research before
they do, man and go, wow.

519
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,031
Okay.

520
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:20,031
It looks like this is super addictive
and completely fucks your life up,

521
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:25,170
but I do want to get high.
Is there an Erowid for math?

522
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:28,010
Is there like a first time, some
difficult experience? Center is,

523
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,590
Arrowhead is awesome.
erowid.org is awesome for any,

524
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,680
any experiences you've had
that uh, even that, what,

525
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,770
whatever the fuck the actual
chemical is for bath salts. You know,

526
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,340
what is it an MDM? A UCB?
I think as well there's,

527
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,400
there's so many of them that had been
classified as bath salts or plant food

528
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:46,130
that it's hard to narrow it
down. It's, is that what it is?

529
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,000
I was saying that the other day,
but I wasn't sure.

530
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,680
There's a bunch of different
chemicals and they can eat.

531
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,920
It's not like it's one unit. Not at
all. All this pass. All right. Yeah.

532
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,770
Anything that will cause somebody to
eat somebody else's face is now a bath.

533
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,520
So even though it really was said that
it was pot, pot, he was high on pot.

534
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,350
You just had mad munchies. Man, that
guy was fucking unstable. That's it.

535
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:10,030
And that doesn't make for a
flashy news report, but well,

536
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:14,090
imagine if Paul really did do that to him.
That pop would be worth millions.

537
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:20,010
Like, listen, I know that dude eight,
that dude's face, but I wouldn't do that.

538
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:25,011
I want to know what that fucking wolverine
pies like you imagine a pop mean,

539
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:31,050
maybe, maybe make a fucking idiot,
eat a guy's face, but I'm, I'm,

540
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,280
I'm 100% fucking sure that there's not
a drug in the world that you could give

541
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:38,470
me that would change my mind about
eating the dude's face. You know,

542
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,280
there's only so high that you can get
and still be conscious like Jesus Christ,

543
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,240
you're weak, bitch. You didn't fight
off the urge at all. But just society,

544
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,500
that guy's face,
if they've,

545
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,360
I mean there's drugs that could turn
that guy's face into a candy bar or

546
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:51,880
something that's equally as delicious.
Sure.

547
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:55,240
I think when candy bars started screaming,
don't eat my face, it's me. Mark.

548
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:55,841
They're not saying that.

549
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:58,150
They're saying it feels like
you're hugging me with your tongue.

550
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,410
That's what they say when you're tripping.

551
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:04,000
All the guys screaming to his
eyeballs out. I think you're silly.

552
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,940
It's a Unicorn giggling like no way could
be so high that you would attribute it

553
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,710
so high that I thought it was a molecule
and in the cushion of my own couch and

554
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:14,550
I was swimming through my couch cushions.
Yeah. I thought my hands were dying.

555
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:17,070
We're just closing your
eyes and fantasizing.

556
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,200
You weren't involved in a life or death
struggle with a guy's face in your team.

557
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:25,330
But I also wasn't snorting bath salts
or taking this crazy sativa spot.

558
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,750
Yeah. I don't know about
that. Maybe just got stable.

559
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,140
Well Bitch of pot was legal.
You wouldn't have that kind of pot.

560
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,650
Nobody would want it to do you.

561
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,090
Did you have you used arrowhead to
figure out something like you're going to

562
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:39,160
take and how it's gonna Affect you
or to do research on chemicals?

563
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:42,430
Cause it's the only reason I've ever
tried anything in my life. Yeah.

564
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:44,740
It's very well documented. Yeah. It's,

565
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:48,160
I mean there's so many different
substances you could research there too.

566
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:52,490
It Shit. You would never even think
of morning glory seeds and you know,

567
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:57,570
San Pedro Cactus and you know how people
have prep prepared it and I don't know

568
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,880
how the fuck they get away with
it, but it's amazing. It's amazing.

569
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:05,440
A website and even for documenting things
that are, that are still legal. Yeah.

570
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,910
I wonder if the owner of that website,

571
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,310
just shitting bricks every
day just lives in Harlem,

572
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,910
then maybe they live somewhere
liberal or you can get away with more.

573
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,740
It's just so we're so, so gross. How
fucking stomped down we are here,

574
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,110
especially in the idea of drugs.
You know,

575
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:25,111
the idea of you volunteering to do
something to your body and that being a

576
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:28,030
possibility. Just that thought
of you making that decision.

577
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,420
It's a possibility of you getting caught
in the process of it and locked in a

578
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:34,240
cage for a long fucking time,

579
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,430
depending on what different thing you
decided that you're going to ingest and

580
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,630
what color you are as well.
What's your economic status?

581
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,250
So really it's disgusting. It's
so systematic. Fucking disgusting.

582
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,340
Embarrassing,
stupid.

583
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,970
In a world where you can go to cvs,
do you have it's slave labor.

584
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:54,550
It's legalized slave labor and especially
because the institutions are now

585
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:59,020
privatized and it's such a big industry
that lobbies like it's, it's privatized,

586
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:02,040
it's slavery, it's all go down
that cvs or any drugstore,

587
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,390
and I shouldn't say that,
uh,

588
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,220
any drug drugstore aisle that has one of
those little mini supermarket type drug

589
00:32:07,221 --> 00:32:09,610
stores, you know what I
mean? Will they have like a,

590
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,210
like a little freezer section where they
sell ice cream and things and then they

591
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:18,211
have an alcohol lane and it's
a lie dude of hard core shit.

592
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,560
And any one of those bottles, you drank
the whole thing. You're dead, you're dead,

593
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:26,500
you're dead, you're dead, you're dead,
you're dead. People have done it.

594
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,540
We've done it all the time.
People would die.

595
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,330
People die of alcohol
poisoning all the time.

596
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,780
It's not as many as people
die from probably drunk
driving accidents. I mean, I,

597
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,510
that's probably,
but it's still alcohol related.

598
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,070
Alcohol related did death of just drinking

599
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,540
yourself to death. That's super possible.
You know, people do that all the time.

600
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,790
It's ridiculously easy to do.

601
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:52,090
So you just go to a store and it's
right there and pod is illegal.

602
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,610
But people are having these conversations
and maybe it's only because I'm

603
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:59,240
choosing to dial into the kind of
people that have these conversations,

604
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:01,220
but like how long is it going to take?

605
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:05,120
How many people have to have conversations
like this before there's actual

606
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:08,070
change.
I people are crazy people with money.

607
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:12,280
There's a lot of people that don't
believe in drugs take like Xanax. No.

608
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,540
Things like that. Yeah.
They'll take Sativex.

609
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:17,450
They'll take the the chemical
version of a sativa drug,

610
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,280
but they will not take the, the one that
the government has told them is illegal.

611
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,280
Yeah. I know a lady who takes Xanax and
she won't let her husband smoked pot.

612
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,070
She doesn't want her husband doing drugs.

613
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,670
The houses pitches on Salix every night.
It's Hilarious, man. It's hilarious.

614
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,420
They just puppet so maybe so
do we need to lobby them to,

615
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:39,350
to have that become illegal
as well because deaths
happened on that and who will

616
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,890
abuse it? Nope. I think you should be
able to take Xanax all day. Exactly.

617
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:44,060
You enjoy it. Dot. Marrero,

618
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:48,500
joy, Xanax. He takes Xanax every
day and he loves it. And I love dom.

619
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,640
And if that's what makes him happy,

620
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,150
better living through chemicals, go
40 men, he'd given him Xanax. Yeah.

621
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,360
Never say that someone should
not be able to do something.

622
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,550
It's just the things that
become obvious like math.

623
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,960
Does anybody have a good math
story? I mean, does anybody,

624
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,790
it's not a great one to
have my shit together,

625
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:07,340
but fucking I got on math and
let me tell you something, dude.

626
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,380
I really looked at my whole world with
clarity and purpose and I threw out all

627
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:14,630
the negative people in my
life and I started running.

628
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,860
Good morning.
No,

629
00:34:17,861 --> 00:34:22,861
it leads to you in your basement with
chemicals like bins of chemicals and

630
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,790
fucking break fluid in a friend's bathtub.
You're running outside,

631
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:28,990
coughing up blood.

632
00:34:28,991 --> 00:34:31,590
You've got bloodshot eyes and
you know you're out of your mind.

633
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:34,710
But if you happen to cross one of them
billboards, you will turn your life around

634
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:38,550
by 1500 boxes of cold serum.

635
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,310
Listen, I get really bad
allergies. Uh, listen,

636
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:45,980
I'm going to need 400 boxes
of sudafed if that's cool. No,

637
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:47,360
you don't look sketchy dude.

638
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,920
You bring your own brown box
to cvs. Excuse me, sir. You're,

639
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:54,200
you're scratching your own neck off.
Could you just be careful,

640
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:55,660
there's a lot of neck
under your fingernails,

641
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:00,840
bullying, like rural Texas where
they're just making crazy meth labs.

642
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,020
How many people have in the past like
walked into a drugstore and just Poland

643
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,240
enough to where I have to show my id if
I want some Claritin because I'm feeling

644
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:13,010
a little stuffy enough
people have done that.

645
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,300
I have to prove that I'm not going to
make a meth with an over the counter

646
00:35:17,301 --> 00:35:18,134
product.
You,

647
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:23,220
your id not amazing. And
there's an amazing that that's
the drug you hear about.

648
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:27,510
Like one of my wife's friends just talking
about the small town where she lives

649
00:35:27,511 --> 00:35:29,600
in Seattle.
And uh,

650
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,810
you go to this website where they
like talk about the town, you know,

651
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,250
like there's websites for every town,
like message boards. What do you,

652
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:38,910
what do you think about this area?
All anyone says,

653
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:40,980
and any of these rural places is math.

654
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,040
It'd be great if we didn't have
so much fucking meth. I mean,

655
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,950
there's meth all over the place
and keep away from the math people.

656
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,820
Like if you go into
small areas like small,

657
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:56,390
shitty, you know, low income
communities, boom, you got meth. Yeah,

658
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:01,500
it's cheapest, easiest. There you go.
But it's amazing how bad it sucks.

659
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,720
It's an epidemic.
It's amazing how bad it's up.

660
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,840
You mentioned that they focused all their
time on just math because there's no

661
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:10,620
positive math reasons and
stiff like fucking with all
these marijuana and people

662
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,190
just spin those that resource
to go just after math.

663
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:18,100
Yeah. Here's the difference. You ever
watch a Cheech and Chong movie? Yeah,

664
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,190
of course you did. Right? Right. Now,

665
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:22,330
have you ever watched an episode of
breaking bad? Yeah. Now we're in,

666
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,630
which show is someone more likely to
get fucking shot in the face, right?

667
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,750
The breaking bad that you
deal with meth people,

668
00:36:29,751 --> 00:36:33,900
you deal with violence and craziness.
If you show up at some, you know,

669
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:39,020
pot place that's a dispensary it cannabis
care dispensary and you come on real

670
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,980
guns blazing with bulletproof vests on,
you know you're not going to get fragged.

671
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,103
You know you're,
you're right.

672
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:47,410
You're going to trip over someone doing
yoga and eating Keenwa did you see that

673
00:36:47,411 --> 00:36:50,220
shit in Long Beach where the cops are
stepping on the dude when he was stepping,

674
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,220
stepping on his neck when he was down
and then busting the security camera

675
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,570
really like there's like you could make,
I hate there's, it's totally illegal.

676
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,680
I'd like to believe we live
in a society where, Oh,

677
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,790
you know like video was supposed to
release everything and end every ounce of

678
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,080
controversy and look there's proof,

679
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:08,860
here's the videotape and all it has done
is lead to arguments over context and

680
00:37:08,861 --> 00:37:12,220
how interpretation of
those videos I disagreed.

681
00:37:12,221 --> 00:37:14,990
There has definitely been a lot of
arguments but God damn is it fixed a lot.

682
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,190
It's brought a lot to light and you
know, just like this, I totally get that,

683
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:19,020
but it's,

684
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,690
I'm just shocked at the amount of that
analyst analyzing that can go on when it

685
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:24,640
gets in the way. Like some
people were saying, well look,

686
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,310
the guy was probably trying
to resist and pull back,

687
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,470
which is why it looks like he is.
That's why he stepped on his neck.

688
00:37:29,471 --> 00:37:33,970
He was just in the thing. How do you
justify breaking the security camera?

689
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,610
There's no justification
for that whatsoever.

690
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,990
That young man wasn't resisting at all
and he didn't do anything and it was kind

691
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:43,850
of creepy and I don't want to
bring race into it, but I have to,

692
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:46,970
when a white guy steps on
the neck of a down black man,

693
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:51,110
you know though that that's like what,
first of all, he did it to my son.

694
00:37:51,111 --> 00:37:53,690
I'd beat your ass. Right,
right. You Fat. Fuck,

695
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,990
you're just stepping on some
kid's neck for what? Because,

696
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,570
because that's your job today.
That's not,

697
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:02,090
that's nothing in your job
description is John. This is shit.

698
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,350
You're not in threatened by this
person any way, shape or form. You,

699
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:08,030
you might as well be walking into
a fucking cigarette store. It's no,

700
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,200
it's no different. You know, and
that jackbooted thug behavior.

701
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:16,790
There's no way that should
ever be tolerated by any
person who's a member of the

702
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,580
police force because the
police is supposed to be us.

703
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:23,210
It shouldn't be US versus them.
It shouldn't be. It should be.

704
00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:26,660
The cops should be thinking about their
job is to protect their community.

705
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,670
That's what it really
should be to observe.

706
00:38:28,671 --> 00:38:31,550
The law is to protect their community.
When they start doing shit like that,

707
00:38:31,551 --> 00:38:34,880
you're not protected enough and you
fake piece of shit. You're just being a,

708
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,220
you're not

709
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:40,480
in danger. You know that side of criminal,
that's some kid who's a volunteer.

710
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,210
He wasn't even getting paid.
He was trying to figure out how to,

711
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:44,650
how the business worked and you know,

712
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,280
he's getting out of college
fucking Douche bags,

713
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:53,380
food to his neck. Stepdaughter man,
he stepped on him when he was down,

714
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,340
stepped on his back and then his neck
just decided to step on him like he could

715
00:38:57,341 --> 00:39:01,600
do whatever the fuck you want it to
him. He was his, there will be an hour,

716
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,100
there will be an equally as loud chorus
saying that man was a working in a drug

717
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,290
operation and he was clearly in a,

718
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:12,070
in a criminal and it's their
job to squash down those types.

719
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,770
I bet that fact I didn't train.
I bet that guy that walked in,

720
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,750
that guy's neck and back
never trained in his life.

721
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:20,920
I bet he's never been humbled in a gym,
but he's never had a tap out.

722
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,690
I bet he's never done rounds.
You fat fuck dummy.

723
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:26,530
Yeah.

724
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,740
Or maybe he was picked on all his life
and that's why he decided to grab a badge

725
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:31,810
and a belt. I mean, it
could be probably not.

726
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,290
Probably just didn't have a lot
of options. So fucking stupid.

727
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,010
It's so stupid. It's such a
gross thing. That guy should,

728
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,460
he should either look sincerely apologize
and do something about it or he should

729
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:46,000
be fired. There's no way you shouldn't
be a cop. But that kind of attitude.

730
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:47,860
And it's crazy.
My brother's a cop,

731
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:52,030
so I get a crazy amount of perspective
from him on it. And, and, uh, you know,

732
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:54,660
and I'd like to believe he's one of
the great ones. Not a good one like,

733
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,420
but there's no,
there's no justifying that there's no,

734
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:01,410
there's no making that situation in
that video. Right. There's just none.

735
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,130
I support cops 100% of them.

736
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,040
I always do.

737
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,060
I think it's a really fucking hard job
and I think they're under pressure all

738
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:12,380
the time and they're asked to perform in
these crazy situations and abide by the

739
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:15,830
law when their own life is in
danger because of their job,

740
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:20,600
their own life is in danger. I'm a big
supporter cops, but I think two things.

741
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:22,370
First of all,
I think they don't get paid enough.

742
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,890
I think it should be a much
more difficult job to get.

743
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,340
It should be a prestigious job.
We should respect them.

744
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:31,160
They should be an honored part
of our community. We should,

745
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:33,530
we should look at them like what
they are though. They're heroes.

746
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,930
That's what they should be.
But instead they're not paid enough.

747
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,910
They're treated like shit.
They're,

748
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:41,210
they're treated like shit in the media
that treated like shit by people.

749
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,980
And so they develop an attitude and
US versus them attitude. And you know,

750
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,470
it's just an unfortunate
part of psychology.

751
00:40:48,471 --> 00:40:50,150
Teachers develop that attitude as well.

752
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:53,630
There's a lot of teachers out there that
started with no noble aspirations until

753
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:56,300
they realize what $35,000
a year actually pays for.

754
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,540
And after awhile they get angry.
They get bummed out about it.

755
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:04,100
I think there should be positions in
our society that are revered and being a

756
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:08,000
police officers, one of them, and being
a teacher is also one of them. You know,

757
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,000
you can be hippy all you want
man, but guess what? Every people,

758
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,820
everybody doesn't play by the
fucking rules and you need cops,

759
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,310
you need cops and you need
guns, period. These, you know,

760
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:19,550
there's no way you're going to keep
bad people out of the, you know,

761
00:41:19,551 --> 00:41:23,060
out of the system unless you have cops.
They should be an honored,

762
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:26,420
respected part of our society.
So when they see something like this,

763
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:27,590
they should fucking do something

764
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,200
clearly. It shouldn't be that
thin blue line cover up here,

765
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,040
suspended with pay and we're
going to review and it's bullshit.

766
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,200
They should be out. Right? They should
be more outraged about it than we say.

767
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,290
It's a current mood.
Maybe you had a shit day.

768
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:42,680
Maybe the kid said something to them
stupid, but you shouldn't do that, man.

769
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,080
You shouldn't do that. They should
because you shouldn't be there.

770
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,630
Anybody who's going to write a dispensary
should be forced to smoke a joint

771
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:50,680
first just because we tell
you if you're nice and stone,

772
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,120
we're not going to step on a dude's neck.
You're going to be like,

773
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:57,320
that's a great line here.
It's so true, right?

774
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,840
It's so wrong.
It's such an easy color too.

775
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:03,400
It's really embarrassing and most of
the cops, Garrett guarantee you they're,

776
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,440
they're not wanting to do this.
No, this is upper management.

777
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,470
Whoever the fuck is in charge of
making these decisions, a numbers, man,

778
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:12,320
it's all numbers, numbers,
numbers, numbers. Get your rest up,

779
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,780
get your quota and make sure people
are going to jail because we built more

780
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:17,360
jails and we need to fill the jails.
It's all numbers

781
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,390
incredible that we try to call
ourselves a free country. How dare we.

782
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:22,920
Yeah.

783
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,700
I mean look fucking subject to this free
enough to be able to say this in a room

784
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:29,010
at this time on the Internet,
like we got that amount of freedom.

785
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,180
That's really it.

786
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,040
Thank [inaudible] we can't do,

787
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:35,710
you can't have a free country
that makes as much money as we do.

788
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:40,330
You really can't because the only way
you can make as much money as we do as a

789
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,830
team, as a whole, as a country.

790
00:42:41,831 --> 00:42:45,070
It's like you kind of fucking dominate
all the parts of the world that have all

791
00:42:45,071 --> 00:42:49,140
the good shit. And if you don't get the
good shit from them, you know, like what?

792
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,610
How, how are you gonna how
are you going to run things?

793
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,330
You gotta you gotta you
gotta run things span.

794
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,310
We've got to have a lot of fucking
fossil fuels. We've got to have law.

795
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:01,350
It's almost like you can't be like really
cool and run a country like America.

796
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,040
It's like it would never
happen if everybody wants to
hang out with the cool guy.

797
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,020
They went home with a guy who
has to lithium if we want them,

798
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:11,180
they want to make some bad rejected
to anybody, to any, any, you know,

799
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,330
any negativity at all.
There was none of the,

800
00:43:13,331 --> 00:43:15,940
none of the negativity associated
with our law enforcement.

801
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,430
None of the negativity
that you saw in that video.

802
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:22,720
None of the negativity when it comes
to siding with alcohol over, you know,

803
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:26,650
natural drugs, none of that.
If you took away all of that,

804
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,030
then you know,

805
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,030
I gotta be honest. I, my,

806
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,550
my asshole post puckered so tight as
those police sirens behind me lie,

807
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,370
they started crying. I was like, fuck,

808
00:43:35,371 --> 00:43:39,030
they zeroed in on our Ip address and I'm
gonna have to stand up and ask if I'm

809
00:43:39,031 --> 00:43:41,070
being detained and then
going to get maced and fuck.

810
00:43:41,071 --> 00:43:44,310
I feel like getting a speed ticket is
going to turn into an occupy protest for

811
00:43:44,311 --> 00:43:46,560
me. Every time I hear a
siren, it's like tragic.

812
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,880
It gets worse and it should
have gotten better. Yes,

813
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:51,720
we should have figured out
a way to make it better,

814
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,140
but instead with the age of information,
it seems like the tightening down,

815
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:57,240
it's like being coming
more and more absurd.

816
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,950
Just wait till there's a UAV is flying
into this room information with a camera

817
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:01,371
in your face.

818
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:04,070
Just letting them know that
they're listening cause
you've triggered the keyword

819
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,270
sativa. Hello. That's all
weird. It's going to happen.

820
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,390
Lord has already made commitments
to putting drones everywhere.

821
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,760
I think there there's,
and I'm blanking on the gentlemen,

822
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,180
there was a senator who's trying to get
legislation passed to make it illegal

823
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:20,150
for drones to be used to surveil
citizens without a warrant.

824
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,720
And that is exactly the kind of
protections we need to go for. Yeah,

825
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:26,570
but you really, you're going to have
stealth drones. Is it going to bugs?

826
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:29,510
They're going to have fake bugs the ball,
if they certainly got them now,

827
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,410
like if you believe in smart dust,

828
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:34,020
you could have stepped in something
that relayed your location in certain

829
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:34,863
keywords

830
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,320
possible to run an empire
and do it while being nice.

831
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:44,120
You're doing it is if you're doing it,
you don't want to screw the well On.

832
00:44:44,121 --> 00:44:46,520
It is a supplement company.
It's very, it's a simple,

833
00:44:46,521 --> 00:44:50,540
it's way more now and in five years
it's the empire. It's the cult.

834
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,120
I'm signing up and call Devonna.
I'm on it. Get on it. Yeah.

835
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,910
Is it possible to run America and be like,

836
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:04,140
and not have jackbooted
thugs raid dispensary's and
not have privatized prisons

837
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:08,480
and not have ridiculous
checkpoints and you know,

838
00:45:08,481 --> 00:45:10,430
and is it possible to do that?

839
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,800
I don't. I think it is. I mean, I think,

840
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:15,890
I think you can still manipulate markets
the way that they do and I think it

841
00:45:15,891 --> 00:45:18,810
could still still allow
them that can do that,

842
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,520
but give us enough freedom to where I
don't have to have my balls, you know,

843
00:45:22,521 --> 00:45:25,120
fond or the fly to Vegas or not
go through a police check minor,

844
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,870
let me smoke my pot like you can,

845
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:30,650
you can manipulate the whole Libor
scandal that is beyond me right now.

846
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,780
The London interbank offering rate.
It's like it,

847
00:45:33,781 --> 00:45:36,550
it dwarfs our little scandal
that we had here in what,

848
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:39,980
2008 2006 what is their scandal?
So their scandal is,

849
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,460
it's a little tangential to the
notion of running the country,

850
00:45:42,461 --> 00:45:46,410
but so they're scandal
essentially boils down to a,

851
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,300
Barclays was the biggest, they have all
these emails and stuff. They, the, the,

852
00:45:50,301 --> 00:45:53,900
the interbank offering rate is the
percentage at which banks will lend each

853
00:45:53,901 --> 00:45:56,000
other money, lend each other
money. Right. And it's,

854
00:45:56,001 --> 00:45:59,630
there's trillions of dollars in the
market that is indexed against that rate.

855
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,600
Your home loan is probably indexed
against it at some point. Right.

856
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:05,660
But tons of markets trade on it.
And to get that number,

857
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:08,290
the banks call two guys and
they report, yeah, we're,

858
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:10,790
we're lending money at the 4.3 today.
Great.

859
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,240
All the banks call in and there's like
an index of 20 of those numbers that are

860
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:18,110
averaged out from all the banks. And what
they did is they manipulated that rate.

861
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,420
They colluded. They called each other.
They would email each other and say,

862
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:24,470
we need the Libor index number to go up
by like a quarter of a percentage point.

863
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:28,250
So they would all report numbers that
were lower or higher than what they were

864
00:46:28,251 --> 00:46:30,470
lending money to each other
on. It's convoluted. I know,

865
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:34,630
but what it would do is it in a day they
could bet against the rate, uh, the, the,

866
00:46:34,631 --> 00:46:37,430
the Libor number going up or going
down so they can place bets on that,

867
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:41,480
manipulate it themselves and in a day
make millions upon millions of dollars

868
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,380
just by manipulating this and with every
manipulation your mortgage might go up,

869
00:46:45,381 --> 00:46:46,520
your credit score could go down.

870
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,140
Like it can affect so many things
internationally. It's been for years.

871
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,310
How long did they do this?
It's been a,

872
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:56,120
there's emails that show there's been
going on for like 12 to 15 years,

873
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,450
but there's some people that are saying
it might have been going on in the early

874
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:02,150
nineties and it was a total honor
system reporting this number.

875
00:47:02,151 --> 00:47:04,970
There's no transparency.
So all these banks got together and said,

876
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,980
it'd be like they just decided
we're all going to stay rich. Yeah,

877
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:10,581
yeah.

878
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:13,460
We're going to artificially inflate and
deflate this number to manipulate the

879
00:47:13,461 --> 00:47:14,300
market to fuck with you,

880
00:47:14,301 --> 00:47:17,300
but it's going to give us millions and
millions and millions of dollars and

881
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,640
that's what they've been doing for years.
That's when it's out in the open.

882
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:22,130
And yet, I mean, Barclays
got a slap on the wrist.

883
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,290
They're like a hundred million dollar
fine or three in a million dollar fine.

884
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,200
That's nothing in comparison
to what they made.

885
00:47:26,201 --> 00:47:28,100
That's the problem with
punishments of these crimes.

886
00:47:28,101 --> 00:47:30,040
You talk about that guy
in that dispensary is

887
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,650
probably going to go to jail
for six months. Right. And
get his next stepped on.

888
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,270
These guys pay $300 million for making
potentially trillions of dollars over the

889
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,130
course of 15 years and no one does.

890
00:47:39,131 --> 00:47:43,870
Does any jail time or anything when,
whenever there's big money, man,

891
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:48,830
there's, there's big craziness now you
know about this money mo problems or drew

892
00:47:48,831 --> 00:47:53,070
situation or doctor drew,
uh, became a part of, uh,

893
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:56,380
an investigation because
they, who was it that, uh,

894
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:58,720
doctor [inaudible] doctor
drew [inaudible] settlement.

895
00:47:58,721 --> 00:48:02,500
What was the giant pharmaceutical
settlement that just happened was several

896
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,230
billion dollars. Was it Yasmin?
Whatever, whatever it was.

897
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,150
Doctor drew apparently was involved.

898
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:12,190
Dr Drew was recommending certain drugs
that they were asking him to recommend

899
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:16,420
and they give him, they gave
him $200,000, a $279,000,

900
00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:21,370
allegedly some, some somewhere in that
range. Crazy to most doctors anyways.

901
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:24,760
People, doctors are incentivized to
sell certain drugs over other drugs.

902
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,940
Pharmaceutical companies do that all
the time or send them on retreats. Yeah.

903
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:29,620
But when you're a guy who's on TV,

904
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:34,090
like recommend treatments and stuff and
you're getting paid to recommend those

905
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:37,990
treatments. Alley. Wow.
That's a crazy blurry area.

906
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:41,890
Cause it seems to me like they paid you
to say some things you might not have

907
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:43,510
said he's going to say.

908
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:46,190
I wouldn't have said it if I didn't
believe in the product and I, you know,

909
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:49,960
I didn't believe in any of that. Money
did not affect my opinion whatsoever.

910
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,430
It didn't sway me one way,

911
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,150
but that's tragic because I want to
believe like Dr drew was one of those guys

912
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,490
that he's not supposed
to have any scandal.

913
00:48:57,491 --> 00:49:00,310
He was supposed to be the one good guy.
Right. He was supposed to be the good guy.

914
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,060
As long as his penis works well, it's
very unlikely that he keeps it together.

915
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:10,330
He's a good guy, man. He really is. I've
loved him. Every time I met him I be like,

916
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:12,610
I want to believe you're real.
I want to believe in your magic.

917
00:49:12,611 --> 00:49:14,260
Don't be a David Blaine on me.
Well,

918
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:17,560
his stance on marijuana is always were
pretty silly. Yeah, we are. We are.

919
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,780
We talked about it so much yesterday
that we can't really go on.

920
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,290
We had Tommy Chong on the podcast
yesterday. Oh yeah, of course.

921
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:26,440
Was massive amounts of weed talk shit.
The question Joe,

922
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:31,150
when he was talking about a heroin,
did you think in your head, wow,

923
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:35,230
that's really good. T tail and you know
like it's like we said he didn't do it.

924
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:39,060
It was really odd. Yeah. Chung or
doctor drew, Tommy, Tommy Chong.

925
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,780
I saw doctor drew tying off in a bathroom
and you read it. If doctor drew said,

926
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:46,630
listen, I shouldn't be talking shit about
these drugs and until I do the mall,

927
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:50,170
so it just goes on a show and that's his.
No doctor Juke gets high.

928
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:55,890
See if doctor drew is the same guy after
a month of Iowasca Ibogaine eating pot

929
00:49:56,711 --> 00:50:01,270
brownies and mushroom Dr Dress
third eye every five days.

930
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,860
Dr Drew would go on a cleansing ritual
and eat nothing so much better than like

931
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:09,700
supersize me 30 days. DMT
and Kale. Good luck Dr drew.

932
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:11,380
We'll see you on the
outside every five days.

933
00:50:11,381 --> 00:50:14,810
He does a new trip and we do
a whole season of this and in,

934
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:19,780
in between he's doing yoga, he's eating
really healthy. It's a $2 CPM right there.

935
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,000
Definitely good show.
It'd be awesome.

936
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,440
Could you imagine if you
could get a doctor drew to
do all nonlethal psychedelic

937
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:30,350
drugs if he agreed to it and he
has to do with the octomom. Oh,

938
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:35,050
now you fucked up to show that sweet,
sweet, sweet, sweet. You can do that.

939
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:39,200
Can you imagine the octomom
like examining, did you guys,

940
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:42,650
did you guys watch your porn? I did.
She had some nice and tight pussy.

941
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:46,250
It was really, I didn't watch it. She
couldn't, I didn't had no desire to.

942
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:49,210
She either guide it really fixed,
you know,

943
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:52,280
or the babies came out that
well but didn't she have
like a ton about other kids

944
00:50:52,281 --> 00:50:53,480
are ready so none of her kids,

945
00:50:53,481 --> 00:50:56,000
I guess that's the whole thing
just makes me incredibly sad.

946
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:59,960
Tentacle train rape from Japan.
No problem.

947
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:04,190
But I don't want to see the Octomom
Vagina tag Taggle train ray ban and the

948
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:06,500
archive. That's like telling
me Santa is not real. Fuck you.

949
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:09,650
How dare you do this to me. I
mean it is real. That's real.

950
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:12,800
And that background casting couch is
real as well. All that Shit's real.

951
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:17,750
When I say it's real, it's not real.
Rather. I mean it's magic. It's real.

952
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:22,420
It exists. It's fucking,
thank you for your imagined.

953
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:24,340
If that really became something you,

954
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:29,490
you really wanted to actually be next to
like if there was a real giant octopus

955
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:32,840
thing that could fuck women and
you would watch the whole thing,

956
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:36,200
I would purposely go to Shibuya and
take the yama know Tay Line in the hopes

957
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:37,910
that I would see that tentacled monster.
Yup.

958
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,320
While it was just school girls line up
on a bridge hoping the octopus chooses

959
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:44,630
them weeping softly
with pixelated genitals.

960
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,220
There was a spot in the world where there
was an octopus and it had like a hand

961
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:54,250
of Dolos and it would just pick people
up and fuck them in front of everybody.

962
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,220
It turns out that's what the law, that's
what the lochness monster really is.

963
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:01,280
Just a bunch of Dick arms under the
sea and anybody that happens to be

964
00:52:01,281 --> 00:52:04,480
snorkeling on by picks up
Chapman and finger bags.

965
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:10,340
I mean that's,
it sounds like a Japanese amusement park.

966
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,720
It's no stranger than like lampreys that
cling to the bottom of sharks and you

967
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:17,510
know, eat the particles of
food that they leave behind.

968
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:21,230
You see the video of the clam today that
was surrounded by salt and was using

969
00:52:21,231 --> 00:52:23,690
its clammy innards to move around
a table and it looks like a,

970
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,320
like a human tongue coming out of the, in
between. Have you, can you pull that up?

971
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:28,154
Do you have that?

972
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,100
It's so bizarre looking and that's
apparently how they navigate.

973
00:52:31,101 --> 00:52:32,540
They don't have eyes or nose or anything,

974
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:36,560
so they use their tongue to sort of
navigate around and then we boil them or

975
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,970
steam those bitches, garlic on
them. The delicious, so good.

976
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:44,390
Gleaning clams. How great is it to
be on the top of the food chain?

977
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:47,360
It's pretty God damn good. That's
why I liked that show. Mountain men,

978
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:50,930
it reminds me that we're on the top
just waiting for this commercials.

979
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,630
You were sort of show true channel.
It's mount show mountain men.

980
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,750
That's my new favorite show and like
bearded prospect or types or three

981
00:52:56,751 --> 00:52:59,900
different dudes living in the mountains.
One Dude lives in Alaska,

982
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,340
leaves his family, goes on a Bush
plane, flies three hours to his traps,

983
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,590
and he runs his traps for three months.

984
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,170
Just kills the kills little
animals and comes back.

985
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,450
I want to see the mountain
man wrestle. This guy. Oh,

986
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:14,690
this is the clam YTC this
madness that they put the,

987
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:19,340
they put the salt out so that it
would move along the salt. Some,

988
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,730
some people that said, yeah, that's
what it's doing. Uh, this ain't real.

989
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,480
You don't need this Israel? No,
I don't. Oh, I want to in this.

990
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,660
This is as real to me as those 10 o'clock.

991
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:31,470
I liking the way it's moving
around around the, uh,

992
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,680
if you're fleshlight did this, you'd
be all about it. I'm not buying this.

993
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:35,523
Look at that.

994
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:36,560
Yeah,

995
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,530
I dunno why, but what do you think
it's a viral for Internet explorer 10.

996
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,860
Like who's doing it? Has It?
Is it a who would do a viral,

997
00:53:42,861 --> 00:53:47,700
like this is the optimum video.
There it is.

998
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,400
Clamps. So clams. They don't have to be
in the water. They don't have to like, no,

999
00:53:52,401 --> 00:53:55,100
they do. They have to be in salt water.
But you have to breathe yet. I mean this,

1000
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:57,890
this claim is dying. A slow death.
You're watching, you're watching.

1001
00:53:57,891 --> 00:54:00,280
It's last minutes.
How long do you think it takes?

1002
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:04,620
This is by the way slash a clam snuff
porn is a viable internet fetish. Yeah,

1003
00:54:04,621 --> 00:54:08,270
it's pretty hot. Maybe it's real.
Maybe it's real. I it seems fake to me.

1004
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:14,170
Does anybody on snuffy clients?
I don't. Maybe maybe it is real.

1005
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,950
The salt on the table. It's
pretty real. Like, like,

1006
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,450
like where that's the way it
looked it up and then it was good.

1007
00:54:19,451 --> 00:54:22,240
There wasn't a lot of pixelation
around like the opening of the clam,

1008
00:54:22,241 --> 00:54:24,880
which is a tell tale. Yeah.
This just seemed fake.

1009
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,780
But what if that is true?

1010
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,660
Bravo. Yeah. Love. Oh yeah,
absolutely. Isn't that crazy?

1011
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:34,530
Now you can look at on video has gotten
so good and so easily edited that you

1012
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:36,090
can look at anything you
go that's probably fake.

1013
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,000
They're getting really close with
game of Thrones with the animals.

1014
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:42,420
That's the first time like wolves looked
like real walls cause they usually look

1015
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:46,020
so fake. It like blows the whole the
whole thing. You know, if the fake animal,

1016
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,990
I can only dream wolves if I'm watching
game of Thrones because I fall asleep.

1017
00:54:48,991 --> 00:54:52,320
The moment that show comes on really
cannot do it for me. I don't know.

1018
00:54:52,321 --> 00:54:55,830
I just try, try. I was no snow. I got
all excited and I put it on. I was like,

1019
00:54:55,831 --> 00:54:57,720
here we go and I've heard of a doctor.

1020
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,630
I've heard that from many people that I
heard is you just have to get through it.

1021
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:04,110
Oh, you guys are crazy. But check this
out and hook the first episode show.

1022
00:55:04,111 --> 00:55:06,360
Look at this suck.
This is going to freak you out.

1023
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,940
But if you guys haven't seen Black Mirror,
that's what you guys need to watch.

1024
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:14,460
Look at this. It's going to freak
out. This is a clam. Okay. Oh Wow.

1025
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,790
Oh that's real. Yeah, that's clammy
park cooler right there. That's a clam.

1026
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:21,840
Moving around using this tongue to
push around. What a shit. Life Clams,

1027
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,190
clams must've been really conti
in the last life, but who knows?

1028
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:29,280
Maybe that clam is fucking loving life
right now. That's what we used to call,

1029
00:55:29,281 --> 00:55:31,620
like really country girls in Boston.
It was tough,

1030
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:35,220
tough to call chicks cons back then.
Kinda had a lot more power back then.

1031
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:38,310
If you call it the chicken cut back
in 1980 you were ready to fight.

1032
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,970
You got to go to war. So they weren't
cones, they were clams. You know,

1033
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:44,310
it's like whenever a girl was really,
because I grew up in New England,

1034
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:47,160
so whenever a girl was really shitty
like Ah, she's a fucking clam.

1035
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:52,280
It was always a clam and it just like
if you are claiming this life and came

1036
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:56,400
back as a clam and need just some
shithead because you guys decided to start

1037
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:59,040
calling him that too, which
is great because you have
no, I mean like the Hitler,

1038
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:02,910
Hitler came back as a clam, you know, like
you don't even deserve to be a person.

1039
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,550
But we also say happy as a clam. So
maybe they're really loving them. No,

1040
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:08,460
they're just have a big watch,
stupid face.

1041
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,890
So it looks like they're
smiling when they open up.

1042
00:56:10,891 --> 00:56:12,960
It looks like they're smiling.
Yeah, that's what it is.

1043
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:13,980
It's not nearly as exciting.

1044
00:56:13,981 --> 00:56:16,350
I like to believe that that claim
is on a permanent trip right now.

1045
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,710
Maybe they are.
Maybe they don't come until you eat them.

1046
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,980
Let's let's go crazy.
That's the only

1047
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,500
way to get us a clam off is to kill it.
It's the best

1048
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,660
thing for them is to be eating.
That's when they're truly happy.

1049
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,080
Until that happens, they
just, they try to find you.

1050
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:35,060
The only way they can give
their love as if you eat them,

1051
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:38,560
so you're a clam bake. Your clambake
is one wild orgy and you have no idea.

1052
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,430
It's a mad,
mad come session.

1053
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:46,420
Especially especially oysters.
They don't come until you eat them.

1054
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:50,170
You've got to chew them and
eat them. That's what they
live and oysters, oysters.

1055
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:52,890
What? I don't like the taste. The ocean.

1056
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,800
We'll see things in a row real his last
time you'd done squads last time guys,

1057
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:58,660
guys and arguments in a bar of Bro,

1058
00:56:58,661 --> 00:57:02,110
you don't like oysters range your face.

1059
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:04,690
You laid off the power exercises.
Since I've seen you.

1060
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:08,560
Have you backed off your clean completely
out of the completely out of the gym

1061
00:57:08,561 --> 00:57:12,700
rehabbing with Neon pink weights that
are like three pound nylon weights at the

1062
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,550
gym. That sex just fucked my
shoulder up hardcore. Yeah.

1063
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:21,210
Kevin a apparently got some dude to go a
little bit. You go too crazy. And I went,

1064
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:25,540
I went in, so I got you. It was crazy.
I put on 12 pounds in three and a half,

1065
00:57:25,541 --> 00:57:28,720
four and a half weeks of like really
like really dedicated supplements in

1066
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:32,140
everything, but just destroyed my
entire body over the course of that.

1067
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:35,270
Well you have to take it slow. If you
haven't been lifting your whole life,

1068
00:57:35,271 --> 00:57:36,630
then all sudden you're,
you know,

1069
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,580
you're doing fucking dead lifts and squats
and everything that he had a build up

1070
00:57:40,581 --> 00:57:44,090
to stuff like that. And you were you
doing? I'm always with a trainer,

1071
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,460
like with somebody always showing you
how to do it right and make sure your

1072
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:47,443
posture is

1073
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:51,540
the majority of the time. Yes. But my
problem was that I would convince myself,

1074
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:55,180
even if I was collapsing and passing out,
clearly I wasn't trying hard enough.

1075
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:58,690
Like I could, I could squat more or do
more. So I got in my own head about it and

1076
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:02,740
all that effort would have been so better
spent like in Jujitsu or something.

1077
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:06,240
Now realize that now I am just trying
to get better so I can actually get into

1078
00:58:06,241 --> 00:58:08,340
something that's more of a martial art.
What is wrong with you?

1079
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:12,510
This is just hurt my shoulder.
Like completely fucked
it up and you get an MRI.

1080
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,141
They didn't do the MRI.

1081
00:58:13,141 --> 00:58:15,420
They did the x ray and said that was
good enough and I tried to explain,

1082
00:58:15,421 --> 00:58:19,190
I don't think you can see what you need
to see on it, but doing the Rehab I've,

1083
00:58:19,191 --> 00:58:19,831
I've gotten better.

1084
00:58:19,831 --> 00:58:22,800
Like I was just cleared to go back to
the gym but it's been a long fucking

1085
00:58:22,801 --> 00:58:23,200
process.

1086
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,960
So you would just clear to be able to
work out again. Do you have no more pain?

1087
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:29,470
Yeah, no. I mean I have well it at that
low weight high rep I'm, I'm pretty,

1088
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,280
I'm pretty okay now

1089
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,140
there's an awesome shoulder exercise.

1090
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,100
Call the club bell and it's
not a heavyweight exercise.

1091
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:37,860
I use 15 pound club
bells. I use them. Yeah.

1092
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,190
And you know I've been doing it for a
while and there's a lot of great exercises

1093
00:58:41,191 --> 00:58:44,670
you can do with a 15 pack cause
it's a really weird offset thing.

1094
00:58:44,671 --> 00:58:49,080
Like there's dudes that use like 45
pounders. They're fucking savages.

1095
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:52,890
These like giant wrestler do to
can do them with these huge ones.

1096
00:58:52,891 --> 00:58:55,980
I can't fuck with those but 15 pounds,
believe it or not.

1097
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,420
It seems like a lot a tiny metal.

1098
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:01,740
But is it explosive over the head
kind of or is it still on the plane

1099
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:06,180
doing like these things called shield
casting and all it is is like controlled

1100
00:59:06,181 --> 00:59:09,790
movements of the shoulder and strengthens
your joints. It's very good for sure.

1101
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:13,400
Like if I did that with a fishing weight
right now, I'd be okay. But anything,

1102
00:59:13,401 --> 00:59:15,050
anything above like a watch battery,

1103
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,780
I'm going to destroy my shoulder just
cause it's that it's still that sensitive

1104
00:59:17,781 --> 00:59:22,130
to overhead movements. It sucks.
Sucks of it. Did you, you need

1105
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,880
to get an Mri man. You might have had,
what is that guy doing? Is that some,

1106
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,250
is that what you're talking about?
So something along those lines.

1107
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:30,080
But there's something about the background

1108
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:36,120
guy is that guy has a warming up before
he holds a woman against her will. Yeah.

1109
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,950
That's all that is. It looks like a
worker at lax when he goes home at night.

1110
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:44,270
You know like when the guys at flags
and playing times. This is one that I,

1111
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:47,860
dude, that's one of the club bell
exercises that I do. He bells behind them.

1112
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:52,960
The club's behind him. Yeah.
Those big ones are, that's
like strong man type shit.

1113
00:59:52,961 --> 00:59:57,480
That's like stuff that like,
you know, like uh, you know
like one of those Indian,

1114
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:59,800
if you ever seen like
famous Indian wrestling,

1115
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:03,250
like India is known like for uh,

1116
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,530
developing like really powerful
men and wrestlers really back.

1117
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,930
I've only seen like the lady boys that
do the pole dancing that run up the large

1118
01:00:09,931 --> 01:00:13,840
wooden huts. Lady Boys. Man, I
think that's pretty cool. And Rip.

1119
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:19,410
I wouldn't say that to their face to
Joe, but to you, I just like lady boys.

1120
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:20,800
I remember I went to Cirque du Soleil,
right?

1121
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:23,840
Never felt more like a bitch,
man. I worked for the UFC,

1122
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,750
but no one in the UFC has a
build like these fucking guys.

1123
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:31,250
When you see dudes doing like a handstand
holding another dude up in the air

1124
01:00:31,251 --> 01:00:34,070
with one hand, you're like, wait a
minute, get the fuck outta here. Yeah,

1125
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:37,390
well 500,000 gallons of water poured on
them from the ceiling and there's lights

1126
01:00:37,391 --> 01:00:40,240
in their eyes and they're just holding
it still costs and it's their third show

1127
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:44,590
that night. Like insane. I
mean, they must be on roids.

1128
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,513
There's no way.

1129
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,450
There's no way he could do that and not
all be just like Cirque de Solei Jewson

1130
01:00:49,451 --> 01:00:53,350
pretty hardcore. You imagine
you're like, you know what,

1131
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:56,530
I need drug testing in Cirque du Solei.

1132
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:59,800
I don't want to watch some juice
heads holding each other up.

1133
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:04,080
I want to know it's disingenuine to
the sport of acrobatic dancing. It's,

1134
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:06,670
it's the whole thing.
It's wrong.

1135
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:09,130
It's not supposed to be about
steroid and it's not fair.

1136
01:01:09,131 --> 01:01:10,870
You and I want to compete
on that level with them.

1137
01:01:10,871 --> 01:01:13,480
We want to be served to answers but
we don't want to have to juice. Yeah,

1138
01:01:13,481 --> 01:01:14,290
that's not fair.

1139
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:16,930
I mean you have to hold a lot of
dudes over your head to get built.

1140
01:01:16,931 --> 01:01:17,770
Like those guys.

1141
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,000
I'm not saying they juice cause you
can't get that big without choosing.

1142
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:25,690
I had a friend who was a
total that natural bodybuilder
and he was fucking huge

1143
01:01:25,691 --> 01:01:29,140
and you would swear that this guy
did steroids. He never did anything.

1144
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:30,940
It's not 100% natural,

1145
01:01:30,941 --> 01:01:34,990
just obsessed and worked out
like a maniac and was enormous.

1146
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:40,060
But it is possible. Sure. It's just
really hard to do. It's super hard to do.

1147
01:01:40,061 --> 01:01:43,690
So most people assume, especially for
certain body types, certain body tops,

1148
01:01:43,691 --> 01:01:44,460
it's impossible.

1149
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:48,370
You know like extreme ectomorphs he
ever met like really thin people with

1150
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,040
incredibly thin faith,
thin hands.

1151
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:55,390
Those folks have a really hard time
putting on weight and most of us are

1152
01:01:55,391 --> 01:01:59,240
combinations of an ectomorph and
endomorph you know, is a little bit of an,

1153
01:01:59,290 --> 01:01:59,561
you know,

1154
01:01:59,561 --> 01:02:03,130
a little bit of Meza more for sure were
slight combination of people who are

1155
01:02:03,131 --> 01:02:06,100
extreme ectomorphs like, man,
those people were, that's a tough,

1156
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,740
it's tough to try to get strong.
Yeah,

1157
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:08,931
yeah. I don't know. I've,

1158
01:02:08,931 --> 01:02:13,931
I feel like I wonder how much genetics
plays into my own ability to to go down

1159
01:02:15,761 --> 01:02:19,800
that path. You know, like, well for sure
you went too hard to quote clearly. Yeah,

1160
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:20,100
clearly.

1161
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,350
I mean I realize that this
was completely my error,

1162
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:26,250
but I wonder dedicated doing it properly,
how much change you can actually,

1163
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:27,303
you can actually,

1164
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:30,180
you got to just cut to be healthy.
You got to make sure that a lot of sleep,

1165
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:32,670
you've got to make sure
you do the power exercises,

1166
01:02:32,671 --> 01:02:36,450
but you've got to make sure before you
do any of that. Then you build a base.

1167
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,880
Right now,
if people that have

1168
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:41,750
10 years of playing quake world
competitively, it capture the flag.

1169
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,840
I thought that was enough of a base to
get into the gym and going to beast mode,

1170
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:47,900
but it wasn't quake one capture
the flight. I used to set up,

1171
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:50,540
I used to set up a tub.
I don't know if I told you this before.

1172
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:53,390
I used to set up a tub of
margarine next to my keyboard.

1173
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:56,960
I would get a loaf of fresh French bread
on the way home and then it would get

1174
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:00,440
instant mashed potatoes with gravy and
put that bowl next to it and so I would

1175
01:03:00,441 --> 01:03:03,710
be playing team fortress or you know,
wolf and Stein or doing whatever.

1176
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:07,830
I would sit down, play, click,
click, click, break off bread,
dip it in the margarine.

1177
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,490
Then dip that in the mashed
potatoes and gravy and eat that.

1178
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,610
That was my dinner for weeks on end.
Every day. God, you ruined your body.

1179
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,440
Oh Man. Bpay years, years,

1180
01:03:18,441 --> 01:03:19,274
years and years.

1181
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,040
Did you notice a difference in your
body from that, from eating that?

1182
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:24,140
Well,
I mean there was no different,

1183
01:03:24,141 --> 01:03:26,900
there was no nothing to compare it
to because I was always a chubby kid.

1184
01:03:26,901 --> 01:03:30,590
You know, like I was constantly eating
and internetting that was my life.

1185
01:03:30,591 --> 01:03:34,240
So now I have something to compare it to.
Now it's,

1186
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:36,230
so now I want to swing it in
that other direction, which is,

1187
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:40,910
so when you started to work out, did you
just immediately dive into it? Fuck yeah,

1188
01:03:40,911 --> 01:03:44,120
I got, it was, I was probably about
20, 21 years old when I was like,

1189
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:46,180
I need to change this. I lost a
little bit of weight, but I was like,

1190
01:03:46,181 --> 01:03:49,370
I need to change this.
And so off of like three Google searches,

1191
01:03:49,371 --> 01:03:52,820
I created the ultimate uh,
ultimate workout regimen,

1192
01:03:52,821 --> 01:03:56,360
which was nothing but a small piece of
chicken and white rice for, you know,

1193
01:03:56,361 --> 01:03:58,740
three times a day and running a,
you know,

1194
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,190
two to three miles in the morning and
two to three miles at night every single

1195
01:04:01,191 --> 01:04:04,950
day for about six weeks and
lost a shit ton of weight. Uh,

1196
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:08,840
got dangerously thin, developed
a body image disorder, killed,

1197
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,540
killed my knees from
running, running, running.

1198
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,120
Did you have, did you kept saying the
girls, you think I'm fat, don't you?

1199
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:19,540
What? No, I would say that to like
guys and chat rooms mostly. I'm like,

1200
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:23,730
what you would you fuck me IRL?
Really Lol.

1201
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:28,470
By the way, cut the show with the
lol is we need not really lol.

1202
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,020
Oh No. Yeah, yeah. That's a movie. No
parking. Lol. But it's become a throwaway.

1203
01:04:33,021 --> 01:04:35,970
It's becoming a, okay. That was amusing.
Lol. But I'll go with her. Yeah,

1204
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:38,090
like a hand needs to be the lol.

1205
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:42,380
Like if you're really laughing out
loud fucking mean it. Yes. This is my,

1206
01:04:42,381 --> 01:04:45,020
this is my podium. I'm sorry. I don't
know. He didn't make the show a platform.

1207
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:48,440
So you put together this,
this godawful routine.

1208
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:52,040
So you just from youtube clips and from,
it was just like googling,

1209
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:56,040
like literally like the how to get in
shape. How to lose weight. Thing is folks,

1210
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:59,040
if you really want to join,
don't even join a gym. Okay.

1211
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:02,730
You really want to work out, make
yourself work out at home, make yourself,

1212
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:05,280
cause if you really want to work out,
you will fucking work out at home.

1213
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,080
Make yourself work out
at home for one month.

1214
01:05:07,081 --> 01:05:10,110
And if after one month you're still doing
it, then waste your money on the gym.

1215
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:12,890
Yup. Because how many people join
a fucking gym and then just never

1216
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:18,190
and and if you join and try to quit,
they make it the most impossible process.

1217
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:22,440
It's like trying to quit the army. Go,
fuck, you are locked for life a month.

1218
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:23,740
A month.
Well you got to talk to Pat,

1219
01:05:23,741 --> 01:05:27,340
the supervisor who gives you a form to
fill out to mail to some place to get a

1220
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:28,130
confirmation.

1221
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:32,020
How about the creepiness
where they actually like the
take the money out of your,

1222
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:35,120
your account every month we had a debit.
Yeah.

1223
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:39,940
I usually can't easily canceled my gym
membership when my credit card expires.

1224
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:41,870
That's what just happened to be
at la fitness. I was like, ah,

1225
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:45,430
it's got like six months left. I'll
let it run out. It's going to be,

1226
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:48,670
it's going to be quite a week's worth of
work to cancel it. I'll just let it go.

1227
01:05:48,671 --> 01:05:52,470
If you have a wall in your house, you
can get a workout. We've got the door.

1228
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,930
You've got a gym. Well for, for
real if you, if you have a wall,

1229
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,620
because I would say if it's the only
thing you need is you need to be able to

1230
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:01,960
prop your feet up on something
so you can do handstand pushups.

1231
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:04,870
Everything else you can do on the ground.
You can do pushups in the ground.

1232
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:09,370
You can do tricep extensions. You could
do like a form of dips with a chair.

1233
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:11,890
You know if you don't have a chair,
go fuck yourself.

1234
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:15,940
Do there's chairs in the world.
You can find a bench.

1235
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,510
If you can hear this podcast you can
find a wall and a bench out in the world.

1236
01:06:19,511 --> 01:06:22,420
Just be body weight squats. One of
them, one of the biggest exercise I do,

1237
01:06:22,421 --> 01:06:26,200
we've talked about it a bunch of times.
It's Hindu squats. I do 200 of them.

1238
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:29,770
When I do my strength and conditioning
workout, it's fucking brutal man.

1239
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,720
It's like I'm in pretty good shape.

1240
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:35,590
I do Jujitsu on a regular basis
like kickbox on a regular basis.

1241
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:36,910
I stay in shape.

1242
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:41,860
I keep working out these 200 fucking
body weight squats kicked my ass like

1243
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:45,820
almost nothing. It's like,
cause the first one is easy.

1244
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:50,770
The second one is easy. You hit 10 no
problem. 20 I'm feeling it a little,

1245
01:06:50,771 --> 01:06:51,430
but I,

1246
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:55,240
I can see the the finishing line and
then once you get around a hundred you're

1247
01:06:55,241 --> 01:07:00,040
like holy fuck where your knees are
buckling and shaking like a seismic

1248
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:02,860
earthquake on the way down
because their muscles can't do it.

1249
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:07,490
You've got a hundred ago,
hundred ago. Oh. But it's a,

1250
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:10,810
it's an incredible workout for your legs.
My legs have never been stronger.

1251
01:07:10,811 --> 01:07:13,990
I feel like I'm on springs all the time.
Like when I do my kickboxing workouts,

1252
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:17,410
I have much more power in my legs.
My ability to move. It seems like,

1253
01:07:17,411 --> 01:07:19,390
like a movies you're like,
I can get away from things.

1254
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:22,770
It's like it's the real way to
strengthen your legs the real ways.

1255
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:25,840
Not really like lifting giant
shit over and over again.

1256
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,650
That's puts so much pressure on your bag.
Back joints,

1257
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:31,660
the real way to strengthen your legs,
his body weight squats.

1258
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:35,530
It's crazy how good that shit works. We
still like if you really want to get big,

1259
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:38,230
but squats really do work. You know, any,

1260
01:07:38,231 --> 01:07:41,800
anything where you really load up on
heavyweights and the dead lifts and stuff

1261
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:45,310
because even though body weight squats
will strengthen your legs and make your

1262
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,020
legs a little bit bigger,
they're never going to get,

1263
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,380
you're never going to get those
ridiculous powerlifter thought.

1264
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,850
There was a moment where I thought, oh,
that's what I want to go for, or that's,

1265
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:53,290
you know, that's, that's how lifter, yeah,

1266
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:56,080
like I like the power lifting physique
and regimen because training in short

1267
01:07:56,081 --> 01:07:57,910
bursts like that was really easy for me.

1268
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:01,210
Like I liked that notion of just give it
all for five reps and you're done kind

1269
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:02,044
of thing.

1270
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:05,590
But now I realize I just need to be
confident enough to leap over a puddle on

1271
01:08:05,591 --> 01:08:08,980
the way out of my car. Like I don't have
enough command of my body that I like.

1272
01:08:08,981 --> 01:08:11,260
I play Frisbee and I'm like,
I'm probably gonna Roll my ankle.

1273
01:08:11,261 --> 01:08:13,630
I got to be careful now guys.
Like it's that bad.

1274
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,950
I went golfing and my
elbow hurt. Like, oh no.

1275
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,900
Yeah. It's just the, you
know, you don't need to

1276
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,010
maintenance alone.
I think it's,

1277
01:08:20,011 --> 01:08:25,011
it's so important to work out just to
keep everything moving and not atrophying.

1278
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:29,930
Cause you see certain people get to a
certain age and like you look at them and

1279
01:08:29,931 --> 01:08:33,290
then you look at some Jack Lane type
character that just kept working out when

1280
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:36,090
he was at same age. Look how
much more mobility. Yeah.

1281
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:39,830
It's almost like you're investing in
making sure your car works cause they'll

1282
01:08:39,831 --> 01:08:41,420
give your card doesn't
work you fucking stranded.

1283
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:45,490
Well if your body starts to shut out
when you're 40 or 50 or whatever that,

1284
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,090
that a lot of that can be avoided.

1285
01:08:47,091 --> 01:08:49,730
And the way it could be avoid
is to make sure you keep it up,

1286
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:54,230
keep it work and keep lifting weights.
Keep going to the gym, keep eating right,

1287
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:57,260
keep working on your cardio. Just
that's the have to do it. It's not,

1288
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:58,490
it's not an option.

1289
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,750
Like for too many people it's like
I'd like to give the gym but gosh,

1290
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:04,040
so the time it shit,

1291
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:07,880
you shouldn't even be living your
life with that in consideration.

1292
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,510
It should be a staple.
It should be a staple along with it.

1293
01:09:11,511 --> 01:09:12,990
I mean you want to be healthy.
I mean,

1294
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,930
you should be able to do
whatever the fuck you want to do,

1295
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:17,120
but if you want to be healthy,
you got to have your body healthy.

1296
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:18,013
I really believe that.

1297
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,640
I don't see how you can have like real
happiness with an imbalance body about

1298
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:24,710
it's fucking up on.
Yeah,

1299
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:25,780
wholeheartedly agree.
I mean,

1300
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,010
I think the key in life for everything
is just balance, right? That's all it is.

1301
01:09:30,011 --> 01:09:33,340
So your, your physical, your
physical being and you're, you're,

1302
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:35,860
it's with you every day. It's
your vehicle. It's your vessel.

1303
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:38,500
So how can you be balanced
work and home life or whatever.

1304
01:09:38,501 --> 01:09:42,900
If you're not balancing the physical
portion of your bs going on hikes, smash,

1305
01:09:42,901 --> 01:09:45,040
you're just going on a hike.
You don't have to go to a gym.

1306
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:47,410
I used to go hiking when
I lived in Colorado. Man,

1307
01:09:47,411 --> 01:09:51,250
fucking hikes will kick your ass,
man. Especially at altitude, you know,

1308
01:09:51,251 --> 01:09:54,700
you're walking up the side of a hill.
That's a, that's a real workout.

1309
01:09:54,701 --> 01:09:57,970
It's a nice cardiovascular workout.
You feel good when it's over.

1310
01:09:57,971 --> 01:10:01,660
Your body's designed to do it.
Years and years and years of programming,

1311
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,730
you're hungry or some dudes love cutting

1312
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:04,760
Woodman.
You know,

1313
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:09,420
I remember George Foreman was the first
fighter that I ever saw that we would

1314
01:10:09,421 --> 01:10:12,840
cut wood as a part of his workouts
because back then when people were lifting

1315
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:16,830
weights, it's like a lot of fighters
didn't lift weights back then. And like,

1316
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:21,240
especially like in the 1980s like
nobody ever really lifted weights.

1317
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:24,420
When Mike Tyson came along,
Mike Tyson had a crazy physique,

1318
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:28,480
but when most people don't know it
was all chin ups and push ups and he,

1319
01:10:28,481 --> 01:10:30,360
he was just a thick dude,

1320
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:35,660
a thick dude who was in impeccable
condition and he really wasn't like a big

1321
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:36,510
weightlifter.

1322
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:39,870
But then Evander Holyfield came along
and Evander Holyfield was the first guy

1323
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:42,990
that show that there's benefits to
lifting weights because all those guys,

1324
01:10:42,991 --> 01:10:45,000
before then, they were
all trained in, you know,

1325
01:10:45,001 --> 01:10:47,280
they would do like a bodybuilding workout
and then they go to the gym and they

1326
01:10:47,281 --> 01:10:50,100
couldn't move their arms because they
were sore and they'd get beat up.

1327
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:53,880
So the trainer would tell them, oh hey, I
had fucking away left and shut you down.

1328
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:57,750
She go to your dad's rap and it's,
that's not what it is. Is the Guy Sore?

1329
01:10:57,751 --> 01:11:01,350
You know it's going to make you
faster for sure. We know that now

1330
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:04,310
if you're used to throwing an
extra hundred pounds without arm,

1331
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,230
when you're not throwing it
to get to go a little faster,

1332
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:09,500
it's going to hit a little harder. But
the olden days, man, but splitting wood,

1333
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:10,760
that's a brilliant,
I like,

1334
01:11:10,761 --> 01:11:14,450
I see the crossfit stuff where
they're pushing tut tires, uphills,

1335
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:18,570
forming these higher workout pulled
trucks. He would pull a rather a jeep.

1336
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:20,610
He would our jeep behind him.
He would push it and pull it.

1337
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,100
It's strapped himself to thing
and nobody else was doing that.

1338
01:11:23,101 --> 01:11:26,130
Back then when George Foreman was
doing that, he was doing crazy shit.

1339
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:29,040
I remember a braiding the fat
from the meat when you grill it.

1340
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:32,400
That's the kind of crazy shit for him was
up to do that. I don't even know grill.

1341
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,250
Well, I know his grill. Yeah. What I'm
saying. I don't think you use that,

1342
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:39,090
but I'm saying that's how ingenious he is.
Man.

1343
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,720
That dude made a ton of money off way
more than getting punched in the face.

1344
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:45,750
Man made a lot more money off
of a plastic dorm, you know,

1345
01:11:45,751 --> 01:11:49,470
like chicken and steak cooker.
He was punched in the face.

1346
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:50,820
Amazing human being.

1347
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:56,130
Would he accomplish was very rare when
he was 36 years old after like he got

1348
01:11:56,131 --> 01:12:00,120
beat up by Muhammad Ali in Africa and
it was the most humiliating defeat.

1349
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:04,080
It just, he wasn't the same after that
and he fought. He fought Ron Lyle is,

1350
01:12:04,081 --> 01:12:07,680
that would be fine if I can take a step
back. Was he expected to win at all? Oh,

1351
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:09,990
he was. They thought
it was, this is fight.

1352
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:13,440
The fight was such a one sided mismatch
and most people's eyes that hunter s

1353
01:12:13,441 --> 01:12:16,410
Thompson flew to Africa
and didn't go to the fight.

1354
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,960
Instead he took acid
and war and Nixon mask.

1355
01:12:18,961 --> 01:12:22,800
It's swimming around in the pool and it
was a huge disaster for hunters career

1356
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:25,110
because he was supposed to turn
this story into rolling stone.

1357
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:29,070
Muhammad Ali winds up beating George
Foreman and he wasn't even there.

1358
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:31,770
He started in the shallow,
he missed the entire fight.

1359
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:34,260
So Ali just ran a class on it.
Like you could say, hey man,

1360
01:12:34,261 --> 01:12:37,530
can you guys give me a USB drive so I
could actually watch the fight and my job

1361
01:12:37,531 --> 01:12:40,830
and tell the story. He couldn't even
do that because there was nothing.

1362
01:12:40,831 --> 01:12:41,700
So hunter had,

1363
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:45,810
there was a huge failure because he was
in Muhammad Ali fan and he didn't want

1364
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:47,280
to watch Muhammad Ali get destroyed.

1365
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:51,660
Even Muhammad Ali fans didn't want to
watch that fight because Ali was in the

1366
01:12:51,661 --> 01:12:52,920
twilight of his career.

1367
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:56,100
He had taken those three years off and
really was never the same guy again.

1368
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:59,460
He was never the same as when he was
before they took the title away from him.

1369
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,340
When he came back,
he,

1370
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:05,220
he became more of a guy would stand in
front of you and take punches until you

1371
01:13:05,221 --> 01:13:08,120
got tired, then be, you know, rope, a
dope strategy, which news on format.

1372
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:13,250
And after foreman, after Frazier had
dropped him and Frazier beat him. And, uh,

1373
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:17,370
the, uh, the first fight to sort
of unify the title after that,

1374
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,620
most people thought that
Muhammad Ali was just,

1375
01:13:19,621 --> 01:13:23,790
he was just not quite as good as it used
to be and sort of a step down and he

1376
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:25,350
was slowly starting to fade away.

1377
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:29,970
So George Foreman beat the fucking
shit out of Joe Frazier. I mean,

1378
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:34,971
it was a brutal Kao and was one of those
brutal chaos where he hit foreman or

1379
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:39,990
foreman rather hit Frazier and picked
him up in the air with his punch.

1380
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:43,830
She did like a little skip the superman
punch out star appears above his head.

1381
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:47,930
Cool. Brian pulled it up because it's so
weird. But pull up form versus Frazier.

1382
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:51,570
Kao It's, Oh, another run time ever.

1383
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:54,990
No problem. Hey, don't worry about it.

1384
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:59,400
This is a says the power's off.
Brian's this power thing.

1385
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:06,490
This podcast is brought to you
by technology. There it goes.

1386
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,890
Alright, it's charging
now. Anyway, he hit Frazier

1387
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,310
and he hit him so fucking hard.
Is this the whole fight or just the chaos

1388
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:17,163
dilemma?

1389
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:22,230
Oh, the wolves are beating the
Pistons. That sucks. This was 1960 on.

1390
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,560
I'd be surprised if we wanted to.

1391
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:27,080
Now you got to watch how
hard for him and Pitsa.

1392
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:29,723
Okay.

1393
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:34,450
And Joe Frazier,
by the way,

1394
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,810
tagged for him and a bunch of times
Joe Frazier is a bad motherfucker.

1395
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:39,103
Yeah,

1396
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:45,900
it's weird watching these guys as, yeah.
He needs to take him to the ground.

1397
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,350
He's losing,
he's losing the standup game.

1398
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,760
Right. You're right. But that gap

1399
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:56,210
to Frazier is such a crazy style is
bobbing and weaving winging punches.

1400
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:57,583
You know,

1401
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:01,970
all I can think of is the damage that's
done with each little tap to the brain.

1402
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:05,510
Oh yeah.
Here's one foreman starts landing on him.

1403
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:10,460
Look at Harvey is, he
hits so hard, he hits you,

1404
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,680
just changes everything.

1405
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:15,740
He would wait to throw
his whole body into it.

1406
01:15:15,741 --> 01:15:17,660
There's so much power in his punches

1407
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,700
and he was a good boxer to
a surprisingly good boxer.

1408
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:25,790
Like the reason why like he
was able to land those punches.

1409
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:28,100
He was very unorthodox
in the way he would box.

1410
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:32,660
He was like push guys off a lot. See
how he's doing that? Just pawn and Matt,

1411
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,300
he's pushing them away from me.
Don't get it inside and then he would,

1412
01:15:35,301 --> 01:15:36,710
he would plot at you with a jab,

1413
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,630
but then when he knew that
you were going to be there,

1414
01:15:38,631 --> 01:15:40,580
that's when he would win the
big ones like right there.

1415
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:44,240
See most of them were short punches.
Like his jab is a nice door, Jeff.

1416
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:47,090
There's the uppercut. Oof.
But watch when he gets up,

1417
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:53,300
foreman had ridiculous power, man.
Watch how hard he hit when he gets up.

1418
01:15:56,010 --> 01:16:00,990
He's literally going to go in the air.
Watch this shit. Ooh, look at this.

1419
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,270
I saw him. I saw him go
for it right there. God,

1420
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:10,850
he's winging punches
at him. Oh Nice. Jack.

1421
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:15,150
Set up the whole body behind it.
Yeah. That jab is a fucking fence.

1422
01:16:15,151 --> 01:16:16,680
Posts they rented,
rented the body,

1423
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:21,030
getting telephone pulled in the face and
that was his big weapon as he got older

1424
01:16:21,031 --> 01:16:24,480
to just slowly but surely just
chipping away at Joe Frazier.

1425
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:27,990
It's like car accident gooeys
and the speed. So smart,

1426
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:32,010
but the way he's boxing is so smart.
Just keeping them off of the jam.

1427
01:16:32,011 --> 01:16:35,400
I just see more than the hooks and
look at there's the shot. Oh my God,

1428
01:16:35,401 --> 01:16:39,420
that upper cut was bad and there's
boom, look at that one. Oh Jesus.

1429
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:43,560
There went his first bike ride.
Oh, there. When his first date,

1430
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:47,190
oh my God, there went his
ability to control his bowels.

1431
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:50,520
That upper cut was incredible.
They're going to keep this fight going.

1432
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,240
They didn't give a fuck in the
70s did you want to get up son?

1433
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:58,560
Put up your dukes. That's
amazing. The watch this.

1434
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,300
Oh, oh, that's it. Here we go.

1435
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:08,850
Now to continues, dude,
are you kidding me? I mean,

1436
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:10,040
how hard

1437
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,873
is that guy hit

1438
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:18,800
sweet prints. So coming out of this
fight, everybody thought, you know what?

1439
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:21,380
This guy's going to kill him.
He's going to kill Ali.

1440
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:24,080
Like what did he do to Frazier?
He did that to Joe Frazier.

1441
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:27,470
That's what does that one round
or two rounds the first round,

1442
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,630
I think as a first round.
So if he did that to Frazier,

1443
01:17:29,631 --> 01:17:32,690
what the fuck is he going to
do? He's going to steamroll
stands in front of guys.

1444
01:17:32,691 --> 01:17:36,650
He takes shots. He's got this rope, a dope
style, and he's three years coming back.

1445
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:39,250
Okay. He wrote it up the fuck
out of George Foreman stopped.

1446
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:40,280
Did you ever see the stoppage?

1447
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,690
I'll pull that up to pull up an Aldi
chaos foreman cause it was beautiful.

1448
01:17:44,691 --> 01:17:47,030
It's one of the greatest moments
in the history of sports.

1449
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:49,270
Nobody thought it was going to win.
Nobody thought I was getting.

1450
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:53,240
When he goes to Africa, he's dancing and
yell and he's got the whole crowd going.

1451
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:56,540
[inaudible] boom. By yet
telling him like Ali, kill him.

1452
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:59,240
The whole crowd is saying Ali kill him.
Jesus,

1453
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:02,840
he's got everybody convinced that George
Foreman is a fake and he's with the

1454
01:18:02,841 --> 01:18:06,620
white man. She's fucking,
he just, he tortured him,

1455
01:18:06,621 --> 01:18:08,900
he tortured them and then
when he got into the ring man,

1456
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:13,090
he just fucking boxed him up, boxed
him up, moved around tired amount.

1457
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:13,940
Then when he finally got,

1458
01:18:13,941 --> 01:18:18,170
I'm tired and he connected top dome and
another right hand and put form in a way,

1459
01:18:18,171 --> 01:18:21,830
and it was crazy. Nobody believed it.
Nobody believed people were going nuts.

1460
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:25,910
People in America were fucking screaming
and jumping in the streets because he

1461
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:30,590
foreman represented something really
scary, this big crazy black dude.

1462
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:32,240
Or walked around with German shepherds.

1463
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:35,460
This is the chaos. Was that
it right there? Yeah. Pull it,

1464
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:38,040
pull it back so you can see it.
So for eight rounds,

1465
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:41,030
he beat the shit out of Muhammad Ali.
Dude for eight rounds.

1466
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,180
This is the end of the fight.
It looks like he's just

1467
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:47,730
and arms out there that has done
the clean and then look at this.

1468
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:48,820
There's the distance.

1469
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:56,480
I love that music too. That's
fantastic. Where is blitz?

1470
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:02,110
Is that from a Ali's documentary?
No, when we were kings.

1471
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:05,290
This is a Bruce splits creation according
to the watermark on the youtube video.

1472
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,470
Yeah. Oh, Bruce splits
creation. Thanks Bruce Bloods.

1473
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:13,450
Bruce credits you fucking savage.
So that's why everybody was going crazy.

1474
01:19:13,451 --> 01:19:14,840
They didn't Tim.

1475
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:17,850
Yeah, it was, uh, it was the
beginning of the end of Huna.

1476
01:19:17,851 --> 01:19:19,290
Rez Thompson's literary career.

1477
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:22,800
He started kind of falling apart after
that and became crazier and crazier,

1478
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:24,570
unfortunately. And you
said it, that was the,

1479
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,120
that was sort of the beginning of the
end for four minutes. Well, yeah, yeah.

1480
01:19:27,121 --> 01:19:29,220
That was when foreman had
one more fight after that.

1481
01:19:29,221 --> 01:19:31,860
And I think he fought Ron Lyle.
I think that's what we fought.

1482
01:19:31,861 --> 01:19:36,030
But they had this crazy back and forth,
fucking crazy war and uh,

1483
01:19:36,031 --> 01:19:39,570
he got knocked down a couple of times
and just wasn't the same. George Foreman,

1484
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:41,040
like I'll lead,
took it from him.

1485
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:45,810
So then he retired and then he became
this priest and he became a preacher and

1486
01:19:45,811 --> 01:19:50,640
found God's word and got fat as fuck.
And then at 36 years of age,

1487
01:19:50,641 --> 01:19:53,070
I think you'd be not a
fighting for 10 years.

1488
01:19:53,071 --> 01:19:54,330
I think that's how long you've been out.

1489
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:59,430
He just decides 300 plus pounds fat as
fuck decides is going to make a comeback.

1490
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:03,360
And I remember reading about it and
being in a boxing fan going, oh wow,

1491
01:20:03,361 --> 01:20:06,990
he's going to make it come back. That's
crazy. Yeah. Good luck. That's all. I was,

1492
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:10,050
come on George Foreman in the modern era.

1493
01:20:10,051 --> 01:20:13,110
He's a giant fat guy and then all of a
sudden he just like kept losing weight

1494
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:17,690
and he kept beating people.
And then he got to Jerry coat,
uh, not cherry coat. Sia,

1495
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:18,533
Gerry Cooney,

1496
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:22,200
he got to Gerry Cooney and beat the
fucking shit out of Gerry Cooney.

1497
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:26,400
Pull that up. Ryan pull Blah
George Foreman. Kaos Gerry Cooney.

1498
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:29,550
I love Youtube. It's
amazing. It's so credible.

1499
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:33,560
All on demand. Yeah. Edited and you can
get the dubstep remix of that fight.

1500
01:20:33,561 --> 01:20:34,680
Actually pulled that one up with

1501
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:39,880
when George Foreman Kao Gerry Cooney,
I think he was in his forties.

1502
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:42,330
I'm pretty sure he was in
his forties. And uh, he,

1503
01:20:42,331 --> 01:20:44,320
he was the oldest man to
win the heavyweight title.

1504
01:20:44,321 --> 01:20:49,240
He was 46 when he knocked
out Michael Moore and Michael
Moore was a fucking stud.

1505
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:53,230
He was a really good boxer form and
hit him with one of those canned hams,

1506
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:58,000
those giant fucking fists
of his, it's just a hard for
me to watch. Like I respect

1507
01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:02,720
boxing highlights when they're from the
time where MMA didn't exist because,

1508
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,910
because now you know, you look
at it and go, okay, well that's,

1509
01:21:04,911 --> 01:21:06,900
that's impressive again,
because that was the sport and that was,

1510
01:21:06,901 --> 01:21:08,900
they were the best at it.
But nowadays,

1511
01:21:08,901 --> 01:21:12,920
like the boxing has completely lost
any ounce of appeal for me. Just has,

1512
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:13,930
I prefer,

1513
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:17,110
um,
quite honestly I prefer MMA to everything,

1514
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:22,030
but I do like stand up fighting only.
I do still like that.

1515
01:21:22,031 --> 01:21:26,770
I prefer kickboxing. I like, I'm
sure you know what it's showtime.

1516
01:21:26,771 --> 01:21:29,650
Has He ever watch it? Showtime. They
just sold themselves to golden glory.

1517
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:33,120
So now it's just called glory.
That's the, the, the new, uh, they,

1518
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:35,140
they combined forces,
they bought them out.

1519
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,480
Is it all like a k one or it's
just like be better than cable.

1520
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:39,810
It's going to be the best
fighters. It's all the, cause.

1521
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:43,740
Th Th the k one organization after a
while, stop paying people and they would,

1522
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:43,980
they,

1523
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:47,530
they had money problems for a while and
then a new company bought them out and

1524
01:21:47,531 --> 01:21:48,550
then they did a may show.

1525
01:21:48,551 --> 01:21:51,070
They did a show in May and people
didn't get paid from that either.

1526
01:21:51,071 --> 01:21:53,110
Not Everybody got paid
like the big guys got paid,

1527
01:21:53,111 --> 01:21:56,230
so it showtime and glory
decided to get together,

1528
01:21:56,260 --> 01:22:01,210
but most people in America don't even
know how fucking bad ass kickboxing is.

1529
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:02,980
Like real boxing.
I mean,

1530
01:22:02,981 --> 01:22:07,210
we got used to that PKA karate shit
in the 80s which was quite honestly,

1531
01:22:07,211 --> 01:22:10,360
I mean it was a lot of fun. I enjoyed
it. There's a lot of very good fighters,

1532
01:22:10,361 --> 01:22:13,090
you know, that that came out of that,
you know, that actually, you know,

1533
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,190
tennis Alexio and the guys
who are really good fighters.

1534
01:22:15,191 --> 01:22:19,090
But the style wasn't that exciting.
I mean, you'd make people,

1535
01:22:19,091 --> 01:22:21,820
they had to like kick like eight
times and around. Otherwise, you know,

1536
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:24,700
they'd get penalized because most people,
it's just like sloppy box.

1537
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:29,110
This is nothing like that. This is
incredibly technical point in time.

1538
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:32,690
Yeah. Look at this. Gerry
Cooney and George Foreman,

1539
01:22:32,691 --> 01:22:35,750
I believe he's in his forties here.
Look at this.

1540
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:39,710
Gerry Cooney had challenged for
the title at one point in time.

1541
01:22:39,711 --> 01:22:42,410
He fought Larry Holmes.
He was a murderous puncher,

1542
01:22:42,411 --> 01:22:45,290
knocked out Ken Norton and one of
the most vicious knockouts ever.

1543
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,980
A ruthless Naca. He Could Bang
Matt's big fucking White Guy.

1544
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:55,190
But George woman also open,
he opened a lot of people's eyes with,

1545
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:58,970
oh well he could take Cooney's punches
to look at. Oh, look at that one too.

1546
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:03,710
Boodle brewed. Oh God. Damn.

1547
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:08,160
George Foreman was a bad motherfucker.
What a combination, man. Get up.

1548
01:23:08,161 --> 01:23:11,780
Go in Benjamin. He's getting
up. How tough is Gerry Cooney?

1549
01:23:11,781 --> 01:23:16,560
He's getting up after that. He's going to
keep going. Did she know you ain't okay?

1550
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,620
Never been clocked like that. Look
at this. Look at this. Oh one side.

1551
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:25,390
Just step in uppercut.
Brian, please rewind that.

1552
01:23:25,391 --> 01:23:28,780
Just rewind a second one. We won
the second part again. Oh, that was,

1553
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:33,700
this is Gloria. So look at this upper cut.
Boom. He, he didn't need to follow up.

1554
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:38,230
Even need the follow up. We just wanted
him to hit him. George Foreman, stepson,

1555
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,060
left upper cuts him steps to it.
Right,

1556
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:44,260
right and right. Handsome. He was a,
he was a really underrated boxer, man.

1557
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:48,240
He said he, that guy was a, you know,
a really, really interesting fighter.

1558
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:52,410
But Muhammad Ali, he took his
soul in Zaire. But how was
his ground game? Um, yeah,

1559
01:23:52,411 --> 01:23:54,930
his ground game was probably
about like James, Tony's.

1560
01:23:56,970 --> 01:24:01,200
That's so good. That's so good. You know,
they all could develop a ground game.

1561
01:24:01,201 --> 01:24:04,140
Anybody can develop this round game.
All you have to do is put it in the time.

1562
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:07,340
It's a problem is when you
go there, you're going to
feel like a bitch. You know,

1563
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:11,220
you just gotta be able to do that
because a lot of people have a distorted

1564
01:24:11,221 --> 01:24:14,670
perception of how well they could
defend themselves. And you know,

1565
01:24:14,671 --> 01:24:16,050
you get in there your role,
like I,

1566
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:19,500
my friend Cade weighs 140
pounds and I'm not bullshitting.

1567
01:24:19,501 --> 01:24:22,770
He might wait one 45 he's very slight.
It's very thin,

1568
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,580
but he's a black belt in
Jujitsu, you know, and I am,

1569
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:29,880
I'm 50 pounds fucking heavier than him.
But if I roll with him,

1570
01:24:29,881 --> 01:24:33,170
I got to watch what I'm doing cause
he'll fucking slap a triangle. I mean,

1571
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:38,070
I'll go unconscious. I mean that's just,
that's the reality of MMA as opposed to,

1572
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,840
you know, to boxing is that, you
know, in, in, in a, in a boxing match,

1573
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:46,500
the fact that you're not going to ever
see that he never going to see a guy slap

1574
01:24:46,501 --> 01:24:50,100
a triangle and a guy in the
middle of a fight, right?
And Oh shit, he locked it in.

1575
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,890
You're missing half the
fun. You're, you're, you're,

1576
01:24:52,891 --> 01:24:55,980
you're only going to be able to hit guys.
It's great to hit guys.

1577
01:24:55,981 --> 01:24:59,120
I love watching a fight. We're two
dudes throw blows and there were,

1578
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:02,160
right. But I just think it's, it's chess
versus checkers. Like, and I'm not,

1579
01:25:02,161 --> 01:25:04,780
I'm not downplaying the
nuance of the boxing game,

1580
01:25:04,781 --> 01:25:06,490
but there are so many more outcomes.

1581
01:25:06,491 --> 01:25:08,680
You have to factor in
every single millisecond.

1582
01:25:08,681 --> 01:25:12,070
You're in an Nma match with someone
versus a boxing. That is true.

1583
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:13,430
Your button has to keep that in.

1584
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,760
You never see the high level striking
in MMA that you see in like glory and k

1585
01:25:20,051 --> 01:25:22,630
one you don't see it.
You don't see it at that level.

1586
01:25:22,631 --> 01:25:24,250
They're just not as though
they're not as good.

1587
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,850
And one of the reasons why they're not
as good is because they also have to

1588
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:29,400
factor in take down attempts.
Right?

1589
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:32,910
So they have to change their stance a
little bit and they have to there they

1590
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,650
have to constantly be thinking
about like if they throw a kick,

1591
01:25:35,651 --> 01:25:37,600
they're going to get taken down
and they might lose the round.

1592
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:41,080
The guy gets on top of 'em there might
not be able to submit them. There's some,

1593
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:44,360
when you don't have to think
about any take downs, then do.

1594
01:25:44,361 --> 01:25:45,200
It can really shoot you.

1595
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:50,200
Really the punchline and some of the
punching and kicking is so exciting and

1596
01:25:50,201 --> 01:25:51,790
kickboxing, man. See I,

1597
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:56,260
that's my favorite shit to watch when
I watched dude's leg kicking dudes and

1598
01:25:56,261 --> 01:25:59,980
fucking flying knee and each other in the
face and dropping elbows on each other.

1599
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:03,530
I mean it's so wild.
Like how good some of the best guys are.

1600
01:26:03,531 --> 01:26:05,990
It's just pure stand up and an MMA.

1601
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:10,991
It's real hard to get to dudes that good
at standup who also have good ground

1602
01:26:11,321 --> 01:26:12,154
game. Right. You know,

1603
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:15,300
it's cause usually when you get to a guy
like at Giorgio Petrosyan who's like a

1604
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:17,750
multiple time world champion,
one of the best fighters in the world,

1605
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,210
Georgia Petrosian is
a straight kick boxer.

1606
01:26:20,211 --> 01:26:25,211
That's all that guy does and he's the
fucking best and he fucks guys up that are

1607
01:26:25,281 --> 01:26:27,080
like really high level world champions,

1608
01:26:27,170 --> 01:26:31,160
figures out their game and you can't do
that if you're also taking Jujitsu class.

1609
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,750
You can't do that if
you're also, you know, uh,

1610
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,280
trying to put on weight because
there's a, you know, 175,

1611
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:40,450
170 pound division and the next
way class has one 85 right?

1612
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:44,250
So you got to figure out what the fuck
to do either dehydrate yourself or puts a

1613
01:26:44,251 --> 01:26:46,700
mass on. You don't have to do that.
And we kickboxing you just fight it,

1614
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:47,870
whatever the fuck away class you are.

1615
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:52,400
There's a lot of weight classes and
glory is that, that's a new organization.

1616
01:26:52,401 --> 01:26:56,900
It's both golden glory formed glory
and glory is a kickbox and organization

1617
01:26:56,901 --> 01:26:59,300
they've already had. I know they've
already had at least one show,

1618
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:03,710
but fucking high level kickboxing to me
is like one of the most fun things to

1619
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:04,530
watch.
Yeah.

1620
01:27:04,530 --> 01:27:06,790
Well I got to recommend something to
you. Actually. It's, it's Tangental,

1621
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,610
but I just don't want to forget too.
I love it.

1622
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:12,420
You've used the term
tangental twice as podcast,

1623
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:16,390
which is more than I've ever used it
in life suite. It's a great words.

1624
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:20,580
I love that word. It's
fantastic. I wouldn't mind,
I might use it in a, um, uh,

1625
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:21,901
something I wrote,

1626
01:27:21,901 --> 01:27:25,150
but I would have to look it up to
make sure he's using it right. No,

1627
01:27:25,151 --> 01:27:26,720
I don't want to fuck it up.
No, you'll be all right.

1628
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:31,510
Anytime, anytime you want to go off
on a tangent. I apologize and gentle.

1629
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,310
What is the chant? Tangental points?
It's was just recommended to me recently.

1630
01:27:35,311 --> 01:27:37,200
It's a BBC,
like a mini series,

1631
01:27:37,201 --> 01:27:42,201
three 40 minute episodes called a black
mirror and it deals with the sort of

1632
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:47,640
near futuristic societal issues that
will come about because of the ever

1633
01:27:47,641 --> 01:27:50,670
evolving pace of technology and how
it gets intrusive into our lives.

1634
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,490
It's brilliantly shot, directed, edited.

1635
01:27:53,491 --> 01:27:57,180
It's one of the best things I've
seen in a long fucking time.

1636
01:27:57,210 --> 01:28:01,410
A black man called black mirror.
It's, there's three episodes and I,

1637
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:05,490
I'm hesitant and reluctant to speak about
it any further because I don't want to

1638
01:28:05,491 --> 01:28:10,420
spoil anything like each. It's a BBC.
I think it was done for the BBC. No,

1639
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:13,700
it was a,
it was like a three re tweeting it.

1640
01:28:13,701 --> 01:28:17,280
That's why I'm going to let to get three
up, three mini series or three episodes,

1641
01:28:17,281 --> 01:28:21,450
three mini series. I guess they're like
40 minute episodes. They're phenomenal.

1642
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,650
I cannot recommend them enough.

1643
01:28:22,651 --> 01:28:25,540
I've been showing them to everybody
that it's beautiful. I haven't been,

1644
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,090
I can't believe they
haven't aired over here yet.

1645
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,400
I think they aired in India and the
UK and that was just stupid. It's,

1646
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:33,900
it's beautiful. Um, I, that
is a gorgeous mirror as well.

1647
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:37,560
That sat in mirror is phenomenal.
Look at the depth of that.

1648
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:40,230
Why are you looking at a
mirror? I, it's what came up.

1649
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:46,620
He was looking up, sat in black
cock. The moment I tight black,

1650
01:28:46,621 --> 01:28:51,270
the suggestions are cock mouth, glory
hole. It's weird. Brian's computer.

1651
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:55,050
This suggests all these weird things I
was searching for Benihanas and it popped

1652
01:28:55,051 --> 01:28:56,190
up,
boot cocky right away.

1653
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:02,580
BBC miniseries on future
technology recommended

1654
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:03,413
by Kevin.

1655
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:08,090
It's amazing. Well, I guess we can
kind of dip into one which was,

1656
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:12,080
you know, the, the, the Google
glasses you've seen as likable glass.

1657
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:15,950
So the notion of having every moment
recorded of all the time, all the time,

1658
01:29:15,951 --> 01:29:17,400
what that's going to lead to,
people have been like, oh,

1659
01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:20,030
it's going to lead to freedom
and democracy and whatever.

1660
01:29:20,510 --> 01:29:24,500
I never really gave much thought of it
in a, like the context of a relationship.

1661
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:27,260
And a couple of gets in an
argument where someone says, well,

1662
01:29:27,261 --> 01:29:29,510
you said something a certain
way a little while ago.

1663
01:29:29,511 --> 01:29:33,020
I'm trying not to spoil things.
And the guy goes, oh, did
I, let's look at the tape.

1664
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:36,110
And then they're both going
back and analyzing the argument,

1665
01:29:36,111 --> 01:29:39,620
which causes them to analyze other things
and it causes them to go, you know,

1666
01:29:39,621 --> 01:29:40,850
there's,
there's even the notion of,

1667
01:29:40,851 --> 01:29:44,380
of of children suing their
parents over decreased, uh,

1668
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:47,660
like wages in the future because they
didn't show enough support during a tee

1669
01:29:47,661 --> 01:29:49,100
ball game or whatever
when they were younger.

1670
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,010
Like the notion that that could resist,

1671
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:55,850
it could exist in a near future because
of the pace of technology is mindblowing.

1672
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:56,571
Yeah.

1673
01:29:56,571 --> 01:30:00,110
You imagine if you could sue your parents
cause they did a shit job of raising

1674
01:30:00,111 --> 01:30:00,590
you.

1675
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:05,590
Like go back and show the evidence and
your father was millionaire bank dude and

1676
01:30:06,351 --> 01:30:09,830
just didn't spend any time you
exhibit 47 where you didn't love me.

1677
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:11,330
Let's go through and here it is.

1678
01:30:11,331 --> 01:30:13,700
Let's show this is the first
time that I missed the party.

1679
01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:17,160
This is how he treated me. I was
too. Right. You can relate to that.

1680
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:20,670
That's coming right. Has it has
absolutely happened. Yeah. This,

1681
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:23,660
this whole thing is not going to,
it's not like it's going to stop this,

1682
01:30:23,661 --> 01:30:26,030
this intrusion,
this integration,

1683
01:30:26,031 --> 01:30:29,510
this symbiotic relationship
that we have with the machine.

1684
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:31,150
Yeah, that's, that's fair. Like the,

1685
01:30:31,151 --> 01:30:34,030
the intrusion part is where like now most
people don't see it as an intrusion at

1686
01:30:34,031 --> 01:30:35,170
all.
They're happily adopting.

1687
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:39,280
It seems like it. I think it's going
to be, the situation's going to be,

1688
01:30:39,281 --> 01:30:42,250
that's just what life is and it's
not going to be an intrusion.

1689
01:30:42,251 --> 01:30:44,320
It's just there's not going to be
privacy anymore. It's going to,

1690
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:45,460
it's going to come to that.

1691
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,910
Well, I think there'll be privacy for
those who can afford it. You know,

1692
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:50,700
there's going to be a percentage of the,

1693
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:54,780
of society that has enough money to hide
what they're doing or make what they're

1694
01:30:54,781 --> 01:30:58,500
doing legal and oppress others. I want to
be friends with them. Yeah. By the way,

1695
01:30:58,501 --> 01:31:01,830
that we're all good. We're rapidly
climbing that mountain man. Your clothes

1696
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:04,650
need to get join a country club or
something and they start a super pac.

1697
01:31:04,651 --> 01:31:07,710
So they like me and they'll tell me when
they were about to make shit go down.

1698
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:11,960
Don't go to the twin towers
were playing golf. By the way,

1699
01:31:11,961 --> 01:31:16,850
that black mirror is a channel for not
BBC. My apologies. It's still brilliant.

1700
01:31:17,570 --> 01:31:20,660
Oh, it's channel four. Yeah.
Oh, you son of a bitch.

1701
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:23,930
Where you that specific with
it? Oh, I just, you know,

1702
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:26,660
just tell people to being black mirror
and then they'll laugh at you for using

1703
01:31:26,661 --> 01:31:31,420
bang. That's true. Fucking
spider man or man or man,

1704
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:35,340
did you like that movie? I had
to tweet it. I was like that.

1705
01:31:35,341 --> 01:31:37,640
That really ruined my suspension
of disbelief. Like here,

1706
01:31:37,641 --> 01:31:41,390
I'm supposed to believe this kid is like
crazy inventor and he lives in a world

1707
01:31:41,391 --> 01:31:45,770
where people can hand 3d vector models
to each other and there's crazy high end

1708
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:47,750
technology everywhere
and yet he's using bing.

1709
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:50,930
I don't think sending that don't even
get me started. And then that tablet,

1710
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,230
what do you think about that tablet,
that new surface? Well, I actually,

1711
01:31:54,231 --> 01:31:56,570
I don't know. I don't know. I'm
not, I'm not too mad at the surface.

1712
01:31:56,571 --> 01:31:59,560
I got to use it before I really
see how it goes. You know,

1713
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:01,960
at the tech specs look good. I mean
they're, they're trying something.

1714
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:05,350
It was funny to watch them try to
present a product like apple though and I

1715
01:32:05,351 --> 01:32:07,470
don't think they have their
presentation shops down.

1716
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:11,470
It froze up and froze up and
then the guy's like, yeah,

1717
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,850
and then like twice,

1718
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:17,560
like twice you can pull it up and this
guy that was selling a case for it is

1719
01:32:17,561 --> 01:32:20,050
like this case is the finest leather,

1720
01:32:20,051 --> 01:32:25,051
like a luxury costs steering wheel like
you would find on a luxury automobile.

1721
01:32:25,301 --> 01:32:26,820
That's the leather Alcon.

1722
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:30,310
You would a sign on my
cock strap right now.

1723
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:32,110
It's my Louis d string.

1724
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:38,670
I cinch my balls with Butan fineness,
murdered beasts.

1725
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:41,140
We cut the throat when they were young.

1726
01:32:41,141 --> 01:32:45,130
We personally personally clubbed
each of these baby minks is here.

1727
01:32:45,131 --> 01:32:49,870
That's what they're saying. If
you are soft balls of a child,

1728
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:53,680
eight,
to be fair,

1729
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:57,820
this software is in Beta and so
that's probably why he froze up.

1730
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:01,600
But you don't want it. Don't
do a presentation unless
it's going to be solid.

1731
01:33:01,601 --> 01:33:04,510
Apple's really great at that.
Not that they haven't fucked up too,

1732
01:33:04,511 --> 01:33:06,850
but have a great experience
just with all the,

1733
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:10,620
with browsing and just
10.6 this guy is just,

1734
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,640
he's hearing the email,

1735
01:33:12,641 --> 01:33:15,070
it's going to be sent to him about his
job termination as he's definitely,

1736
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:17,470
and of course people play games.

1737
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:21,700
I can go and play any of the interesting
games that were on in the windows store

1738
01:33:21,701 --> 01:33:25,540
right now. It's like freezing. I can
play the game. Hide the surface. Yeah.

1739
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:29,500
So no one can see it froze for all of
those and then the camera zooms in like

1740
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:31,600
right, right. It. That's
the worst part of it,

1741
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:37,460
you know? It looks great. My child's
college fund now as a combat.

1742
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,970
I won't see it again. Yeah. Now why
is the camera, would you switch?

1743
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:42,400
Don't excuse me just a second.
Hold on one second.

1744
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,820
We're going to talk about this or
a company retreats. Wait a minute.

1745
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:51,280
When did they just put it back and get
another one? Which Kudos on that producer.

1746
01:33:51,281 --> 01:33:52,390
We're having another one ready to run.

1747
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:57,600
They must have had 40 back there just
in case this buggy piece of shits about

1748
01:33:57,610 --> 01:34:00,250
fuck up in the middle of my
presentation. Man, poor guy,

1749
01:34:00,251 --> 01:34:02,830
he must was sweating and he
tried to like play it off to,

1750
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:04,780
you got to talk about it.
You've got to go listen,

1751
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:06,730
we're going to stop that from happening.
Yeah.

1752
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:11,010
Pay No attention to the
crashing on the surfaces. Silly.

1753
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:16,360
So silly like crashed. Yeah.
So it's that, but I don't,

1754
01:34:16,361 --> 01:34:18,730
I'm not mad at the product. I
just, they got to try something.

1755
01:34:18,731 --> 01:34:22,720
I think it is Amazon making a smart
phones. Interesting. I think design wise,

1756
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:25,690
it's just, you know like
when you sit first of all the
iPad and you're just like,

1757
01:34:25,691 --> 01:34:29,600
wow, that thing's sexy as fuck. You
know? And this kind of just seems to us,

1758
01:34:29,601 --> 01:34:34,120
I don't know it Matt. It just looked
boring. It looked kind of like, yeah,

1759
01:34:34,121 --> 01:34:35,920
this would have been an
awesome three years ago.

1760
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:39,380
Do you know that they're coming out with
a small iPad that's the next move. Yeah.

1761
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:39,860
Yeah.

1762
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:43,000
They're making a note and they're making
the note bigger is what is the latest

1763
01:34:43,001 --> 01:34:43,580
I've Sam.

1764
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:46,390
So the next model of notes actually going
to be a little bit bigger to kind of

1765
01:34:46,391 --> 01:34:51,160
compete with the next iPad. IPAD. Supposed
to have a phone attached to it. No,

1766
01:34:51,161 --> 01:34:54,800
but you either should the note, I mean
you can use it as a phone, I guess. Uh,

1767
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:58,000
probably they're really trying to
bill it but wouldn't you want it

1768
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:01,310
to be able to do everything if the note
could do everything but the, I kept my,

1769
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,940
I couldn't make calls that would annoy me.
Well,

1770
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:06,680
I mean your iPad now can make
calls if you Skype, Skype or voip.

1771
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:11,510
It skyping people like some fucking
hack or savage who is an APP?

1772
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:15,290
I think it's pretty, I didn't grandparents
are skyping at this point, I think.

1773
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:18,290
I don't think that any of the elite hacks
or is out there are booting up Skype.

1774
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,810
Do you have to afford Geeta
Skype or King's Canyon and
so you could come up with

1775
01:35:20,811 --> 01:35:24,590
three g? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.
How weird is that? It's great.

1776
01:35:24,730 --> 01:35:26,450
When you actually going to
be what phone calls are.

1777
01:35:26,451 --> 01:35:28,790
It's like you just need an internet
connection mean. That's to an extent.

1778
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:30,830
That's what they are now. It's
just, you know, instead of Skype,

1779
01:35:30,831 --> 01:35:32,570
you're using their cellular tower.

1780
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:35,090
It's just converting your voice to
packets and beaming it around the planet.

1781
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:37,900
Again, why I like mountain men, right?

1782
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:41,960
Marty gets in his plane and he flies three
hours up in for the Alaska wilderness.

1783
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:43,580
There's nobody up there that poor fuck.

1784
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:48,230
He has to take a bath in a a a look
like it has to heat up water and like a

1785
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:51,620
garbage can. Does he have a tumbler?
Does he have a tumbler? Yeah. What's it?

1786
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:53,990
Am I supposed to care if he doesn't
have a tumbler? I'm not interested.

1787
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:55,060
I don't know what a tumbler is.

1788
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:58,250
What's his Twitter does they have a
Twitter flicker and bill or one of those

1789
01:35:58,251 --> 01:36:00,620
things? Yeah, those plugs, those tumblers.

1790
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:03,290
It's like where people went
when they got off of my space.

1791
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:06,740
It's like I need somewhere to go and
express myself and it really annoying way.

1792
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:10,490
It's actually where I think where people
are getting off to go from Facebook now

1793
01:36:10,491 --> 01:36:13,910
and need to park. Yeah. A lot of
people. That's humbling. Really. Yeah.

1794
01:36:13,911 --> 01:36:17,060
I mean it gives you that sort of
personalization and all that madness.

1795
01:36:17,061 --> 01:36:18,080
The Facebook thing is crazy.

1796
01:36:18,081 --> 01:36:20,960
I think the less indulgent people
are allowed to be the better.

1797
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:24,950
So when you're allowed animated
Gif files and all that,

1798
01:36:24,951 --> 01:36:28,550
she don't like my glitter graphics say,
define me as a human being.

1799
01:36:28,551 --> 01:36:31,700
I want to embed 40 songs on a page
with some glitter and that defines me.

1800
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:36,760
People for years wanted a way to define
the type of person that's instantly

1801
01:36:37,251 --> 01:36:41,360
defined when they have a glitter tag on
their myspace page for years. It's like,

1802
01:36:41,361 --> 01:36:43,790
you know,
they're not retarded,

1803
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:46,910
but like did dare fucking weird.

1804
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:49,730
Like it's like they tell you that like
something and you're like, come on,

1805
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:53,630
read the guys who have that jam.
Stir frog is the ring tone. I'm like,

1806
01:36:53,631 --> 01:36:56,500
I see those commercials. And I'm like, so
what is selling that ringtone to people?

1807
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:59,570
Before the ringtones, man, you couldn't
describe a guy like that before.

1808
01:36:59,571 --> 01:37:02,540
They were gluing tags. You would,
you would go, well she's just weird.

1809
01:37:02,541 --> 01:37:05,090
And then log it sounds like you're an
asshole with axe body spray though.

1810
01:37:05,091 --> 01:37:07,210
I mean it's the same with
your card in the war.

1811
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:12,290
That whole Bot might father wears a whole
bottle of that and to this like he has

1812
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:15,440
no scent glands. So when he comes to
my house, like I've had people come up,

1813
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:18,020
I've had people come over to my house,
no shit.

1814
01:37:18,021 --> 01:37:20,570
And three days after my dad has visited,

1815
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:24,640
they say your house reeks of
knock off Portuguese TrueCar.

1816
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:28,870
And that's my old man. Which he
spray. No, no. It's like it's,

1817
01:37:28,871 --> 01:37:32,600
it's like the chill water.
He uses the knock off cool water.

1818
01:37:32,601 --> 01:37:36,020
Like literally I got some of that when I
was a kid. I remember putting it on him.

1819
01:37:36,021 --> 01:37:38,060
I love him. This is really
what I have to do to get laid.

1820
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:40,400
I don't know if I'm kind
of all through with this.

1821
01:37:41,070 --> 01:37:45,800
Can I get you get them out and
doing their ditto if I, if I may,

1822
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:47,270
that'd be great.
Thank you sir.

1823
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:51,440
You have such congrats and a half on every
time I visit you. There's a new setup.

1824
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:52,221
Wait till you soon.

1825
01:37:52,221 --> 01:37:56,010
We're going to be in low
earth orbit recording the
podcasts like this is so good.

1826
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:59,340
We're branching out. So happy for
both of you. Congrats. Thank you.

1827
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,660
We're having a good time,
man. We've been, uh,

1828
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:04,900
doing a lot of comedy shows here at
the icehouse too. We're doing one, uh,

1829
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:08,160
saw that Wednesday night for
folks who are interested.

1830
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,510
It's picking up pace as we speak
right now. Committed to the show.

1831
01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:15,790
This is what we're going to be one of
our Wednesday night super shows don.

1832
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:20,810
My errors in Greg Fitzsimmons is in an
Ari Shaffir is so just write their son.

1833
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:23,490
Get the fuck out of it.

1834
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:24,231
Greg was,

1835
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:28,310
so I asked him to be a part of the first
lead up that we threw at at club Nokia.

1836
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:30,710
Got an email. So Fis, what?

1837
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:34,090
Explain to the ladies and gentlemen
again to don't know what a lead up

1838
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:37,590
a lead up. Yeah. Well, I mean we
created it on a whim this year. It's a,

1839
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:42,490
it's supposed to be and sort of is
a nerd carnival. So the idea is, Eh,

1840
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:45,910
there's experiential zones that you
can have like an old school arcade or

1841
01:38:45,911 --> 01:38:50,911
cosplay or modeling with
with earth magnets and Bucky
balls and just random shit

1842
01:38:51,131 --> 01:38:54,880
going on on the show floor. And then
on stage we do a sort of variety show.

1843
01:38:54,881 --> 01:38:57,730
So there's a podcast taping,
there's VJ, Mike relm.

1844
01:38:57,731 --> 01:38:59,260
I'm going to come out and
jam with them on this tour.

1845
01:38:59,261 --> 01:39:03,460
We're taking it to 10 cities at the
end of this year, taking it around. Uh,

1846
01:39:03,490 --> 01:39:06,550
we're announcing the dates
next Tuesday and the location

1847
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:10,350
around California. Uh, yeah, I think,
well we don't have to fly anywhere.

1848
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:14,160
Not For this one. I Portland's
the closest, but we'll fly out.

1849
01:39:14,161 --> 01:39:18,460
We'll happily fly out and put you up and
you can do a show or take your podcasts

1850
01:39:18,461 --> 01:39:19,700
during it if you want.
You know,

1851
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:22,740
if I could figure out a way
to book a show that night,

1852
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,930
absolutely worth my while to go.
Absolutely.

1853
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,840
I think a fun thing would be to do,

1854
01:39:27,841 --> 01:39:31,380
we've thought about doing live
podcasts before and we might do that,

1855
01:39:31,381 --> 01:39:35,580
but I think one thing that would be really
fun to do is do half alive podcasts,

1856
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:37,980
half alive Q and a session.

1857
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:41,160
So we could fuck around
and podcasts if we'd like.

1858
01:39:41,161 --> 01:39:44,280
But I would like it if people could
just line up and ask his question.

1859
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:46,200
Right. We built that into, to lead up.

1860
01:39:46,201 --> 01:39:49,530
Like the idea is that so many people do
live podcasts on stage and you show up

1861
01:39:49,531 --> 01:39:52,980
and you just watch somebody talk and
that's it. And I'm like, but you're there,

1862
01:39:52,981 --> 01:39:56,100
you're physically there. There needs
to be interaction with the audience.

1863
01:39:56,101 --> 01:39:59,400
So we play games with them, we give out
prizes, we do Q and A's and I used to do,

1864
01:39:59,440 --> 01:39:59,760
Qa

1865
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,670
is the end of all my comedy shows.
That's awesome. But it became too much.

1866
01:40:02,690 --> 01:40:04,660
The same questions.
Really too much.

1867
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:11,620
Please,
if you go to Joe's live podcast taping,

1868
01:40:11,621 --> 01:40:13,550
make sure those are the only
questions you shout out.

1869
01:40:13,610 --> 01:40:17,990
That's all it is. Too late. They got
me. Um, which, you know, it's not bad,

1870
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:20,660
but I would say like, yeah, you should
probably youtube it. You get it,

1871
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:23,660
you'll get a better, you know, there's
plenty of descriptions of it on Youtube,

1872
01:40:23,690 --> 01:40:27,170
listening to them talk about it.
Sure. Especially, you know the,

1873
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:31,600
there's great videos of you talking about
it, you know, you can, you can see that.

1874
01:40:31,670 --> 01:40:34,400
But it was sometimes it's fun though.
I still do it sometimes,

1875
01:40:34,401 --> 01:40:35,540
but I used to do it after every show.

1876
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:38,490
But it's hard to close strong when
you do that. Especially cause I would,

1877
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:40,580
I wouldn't want to say
no to no more questions.

1878
01:40:40,581 --> 01:40:44,930
So the questions would go on
for sometimes hours. I've done,

1879
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:48,800
I've done like an hour of comedy than
an hour and a half more of Q and. A.

1880
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:51,920
I've done that more than once. And after
awhile I was like, people like, let me go,

1881
01:40:51,921 --> 01:40:54,350
dude, I want to get out of
here. I'm tired of you talking,

1882
01:40:54,870 --> 01:40:58,330
you know. So I, I cut
it way back to I want,

1883
01:40:58,370 --> 01:41:02,980
I like to do like between an hour and 10
and no more than an hour and a half and

1884
01:41:02,981 --> 01:41:07,420
just go fucking balls out, you
know? And then as for Q and a,

1885
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:12,250
I just talked to people, that's my new
thing is go outside and meet everybody.

1886
01:41:12,251 --> 01:41:13,570
If you've got a question I'll answer it.

1887
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:16,630
But the yelling out like on
stage like that, it's like it's,

1888
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:19,070
I think it would be cool if
it was a show of only Qa.

1889
01:41:19,090 --> 01:41:20,620
Like that's what was expected.
You know,

1890
01:41:20,621 --> 01:41:23,170
like people would be able to and they
would be able to get up to a microphone

1891
01:41:23,171 --> 01:41:26,680
and ask like when we did it at the
end with my special, yeah, there was,

1892
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:29,510
there was a bunch of really funny
ones that we did from the end of a,

1893
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:32,740
not my special from
Atlanta that we just did,

1894
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:35,140
but my one from before from Columbus,
Ohio,

1895
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:38,770
w one of the funniest parts of special
was talking to people afterwards.

1896
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:42,730
Like ask the step up to the microphones
to have ridiculous questions, you know,

1897
01:41:42,731 --> 01:41:44,800
but it's hard to close on those.

1898
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:49,920
It's hard to count that one of these is
going to be good enough to cause if he

1899
01:41:50,651 --> 01:41:53,530
could have an awesome show,
but if like the end of its sucks,

1900
01:41:53,531 --> 01:41:55,410
people remember the end of it.
Oh sure.

1901
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:57,820
You got to book end it start
off big and big. That's it.

1902
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:03,060
Killing for an hour and a half and have
the last five minutes eat a dick and the

1903
01:42:03,341 --> 01:42:06,430
show sucked. Well if you did
that, if you ate a dick on stage,

1904
01:42:06,431 --> 01:42:10,570
I think that's quite a closer. It depends
on whose Dick, right? Sure. Yeah. Sure.

1905
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:13,840
Did you hear about the Japanese kind
of that he served his own penis.

1906
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:17,370
He decided that he was asexual.
So we had this,

1907
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:22,270
what am I going to do with this thing?
It's $250 a plate. Wow. And the uh,

1908
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,250
had all these people come
over and he cooked his dick.

1909
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:27,370
He cooked his dick with
mushrooms and yeah,

1910
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:31,950
I would love to see the Yelp reviews
for that. He showed his dick in the bag.

1911
01:42:31,951 --> 01:42:35,020
He had his dick surgically
removed. Wow. First of all,

1912
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:39,040
the fact that he found a doctor that's
willing to cut his fucking junk off and

1913
01:42:39,041 --> 01:42:42,850
then give it to him so he
could cook it like, Holy Shit,

1914
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:45,520
and I don't know who the
fuck you think you are,

1915
01:42:45,521 --> 01:42:48,610
but the fact that you think you could
just cut your Dick and balls off and not

1916
01:42:48,611 --> 01:42:52,150
miss them.
I think that's silly beyond belief.

1917
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:53,201
That's why when I like,

1918
01:42:53,201 --> 01:42:55,420
have you seen that you've seen the
BME paint Olympics video, right?

1919
01:42:55,421 --> 01:42:58,660
Where the guy's got his balls in a mason
jar filled with angry hornets and he's

1920
01:42:58,661 --> 01:43:01,600
just shaking it around.
Come on boys, get at me.

1921
01:43:02,350 --> 01:43:05,950
Get the Stinger in me like that
is insane to me. People are,

1922
01:43:05,951 --> 01:43:07,150
God damn crazy insane to me.

1923
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:10,800
So glad they fixed the AC.
Does it work?

1924
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,000
Do you think it works?
It doesn't seem like it works.

1925
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:16,800
This is right here.
It feels cool.

1926
01:43:16,801 --> 01:43:20,480
And we're going into some of the
beak from Yoga. Yeah, we need to,

1927
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:21,650
we have to think about that.

1928
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:24,110
We found a doctor when we first
launched attack of the show.

1929
01:43:24,111 --> 01:43:27,260
It's one of my favorite segments that
only six people saw cause nobody watched

1930
01:43:27,261 --> 01:43:28,370
our show when we first launched it.

1931
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:31,400
But that launch week we did some crazy
shit and one of them was someone yelled

1932
01:43:31,401 --> 01:43:34,910
across the office, they're like, your ass
got served. Like oh okay. And we went,

1933
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,980
wait, could you serve a webpage
out of someone's ass hole?

1934
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:40,970
And we did the research
and sure enough you can,

1935
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:44,270
we've got a little USB web server
thumb drive. We registered your ass,

1936
01:43:44,271 --> 01:43:48,470
got served.com slipped it into a condom
and on live television put it in a

1937
01:43:48,471 --> 01:43:52,010
coworker's asshole and
fired up web server in

1938
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:56,330
his colon and you could go live to his
asshole and leave a message on his wall,

1939
01:43:56,331 --> 01:43:59,430
which was like, you know, scrolling
on his colon and he existed. I was,

1940
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:04,280
it was crazy. It was amazing. We got
away with that on live TV. Did you show?

1941
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:08,390
We had him behind a screen silhouetted
like ace Ventura Style and the doctor

1942
01:44:08,391 --> 01:44:09,830
went back there and be
modulated his voice.

1943
01:44:09,831 --> 01:44:14,700
But I was standing right next to it
with me. The little microphone. Oh,

1944
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:19,010
it was brilliant. Your ascots or that's
hilarious. Yeah, it was awesome. Too Bad.

1945
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:22,940
Six people saw it. Oh, I saw
it. Well thank you. Yeah,
because I can find five more.

1946
01:44:22,941 --> 01:44:25,200
We can have a reunion special.
That was the beauty of wheat.

1947
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:28,370
That was the beauty of DVR because
that was one of the few shows,

1948
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:31,070
a tackle the show that I enjoyed.

1949
01:44:31,071 --> 01:44:33,560
Kind of like watching the
news almost every day.

1950
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:36,640
I know it was kept up the day
and then stuff like that. So I,

1951
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:40,820
I mean I might've had like 20 episodes
at a time and only watch like seven or

1952
01:44:40,821 --> 01:44:44,180
eight of them. I'll take
that. But I always, you know,

1953
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:46,190
it was a fun show man,

1954
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:49,520
and I really liked how it progressed and
I was actually really sad to hear that

1955
01:44:49,521 --> 01:44:54,020
you left. But I understand how, what
do you, what are you up to now? Uh,

1956
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:57,630
lots, lots. Um, you know, doing
a lot of podcasts, you know,

1957
01:44:57,631 --> 01:44:59,390
when the air conditioning.
Yeah.

1958
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:02,690
I mean that's what I'm getting
into mostly is HPAC stuff. No,

1959
01:45:02,691 --> 01:45:06,620
I can fix your air conditioning for you.
I've been reading up a lot now. I, uh,

1960
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:10,250
I left in a, I started a company called
super creative. Super Creative. Dot.

1961
01:45:10,251 --> 01:45:15,250
TV is our site. Thank you. Thank you. It
was originally a, uh, literally was like,

1962
01:45:15,251 --> 01:45:16,850
what's the least creative
name I could come up with?

1963
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:18,590
It explains what we do cause I'm like,

1964
01:45:18,591 --> 01:45:22,790
I'm not spending weeks coming up with a
name for double Helix Infusion Studios

1965
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:27,300
Llc. Fuck that. We're super
creative. That's what we'll
do. You know. So, uh, uh,

1966
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:31,160
so created it and we uh, we sold a
show to Scifi, which we're doing now.

1967
01:45:31,190 --> 01:45:34,130
I think I, you know what,
it's far enough along.

1968
01:45:34,131 --> 01:45:35,450
We haven't actually put pen to paper,

1969
01:45:35,451 --> 01:45:37,840
but I'm doing a new mission and my
series that will probably announce it.

1970
01:45:37,841 --> 01:45:41,210
Comicon, we're doing lead up. Um, we're
doing a whole bunch of randomness.

1971
01:45:41,211 --> 01:45:43,590
That's a pretty flashy intro.
That's what the winning,

1972
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:47,210
the most amazing intro is ever.
Oh, thank you. Oh, oh shit.

1973
01:45:47,870 --> 01:45:51,780
So what we do, what we do really well is
hype up websites so we can crash them.

1974
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:55,820
Is that server still in his ass? That's
where it's being served from right now.

1975
01:45:56,510 --> 01:46:00,830
That's hilarious. Yeah. Someone
I hired Microsoft to do my uh,

1976
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:04,010
my demo site. There's a runtime
error and tried to do that today.

1977
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:07,160
I tried to do what today,
tried to do that same stuff today.

1978
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:10,850
Probably never be able to put them.
It was really, it was kind of, it was,

1979
01:46:10,851 --> 01:46:13,550
it was censorship wasn't a huge
issue with the tag of the show.

1980
01:46:13,551 --> 01:46:15,290
We were really able to
get away with a lot,

1981
01:46:15,470 --> 01:46:18,200
but they're definitely
came to a point where we,

1982
01:46:18,201 --> 01:46:23,201
there's no way those ideas could even
be the thing that you tried to do them,

1983
01:46:24,370 --> 01:46:25,820
you know, they get shot
down, you know, it was weird.

1984
01:46:25,821 --> 01:46:29,180
There was a lot that I tried to do, which
be surprised me that it got shot down.

1985
01:46:29,181 --> 01:46:30,740
Like chase a greased pig in the studio.

1986
01:46:30,741 --> 01:46:33,110
It took me like four years to
be able to do that. I wanted to,

1987
01:46:33,111 --> 01:46:33,891
in the middle of an interview,

1988
01:46:33,891 --> 01:46:36,430
have a guy come out and ringing
a cow bell and yell like sweet.

1989
01:46:36,910 --> 01:46:39,440
And then the graphics role and in a
fucking greased pig is released in the

1990
01:46:39,441 --> 01:46:42,830
studio and we all try to grab it because
dumbest fucking thing in the world.

1991
01:46:42,831 --> 01:46:45,890
And yeah, this, well, I had my moment
on our thousandth episode show.

1992
01:46:45,891 --> 01:46:48,560
I got to catch a grease pig and studio.
It was fucking brilliant television.

1993
01:46:48,770 --> 01:46:50,010
Except the moment when I leap

1994
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:53,720
in front of the pig and the pig pork pig
looks scared. It was a small little pig.

1995
01:46:53,721 --> 01:46:56,430
I'm like, oh, now I just feel
bad. This pig is in studio lights.

1996
01:46:56,550 --> 01:47:00,780
There's people cheering. We
got hay everywhere. So it
was, we made the best of it,

1997
01:47:00,781 --> 01:47:04,650
but it was, uh, it was doing shit like
that was fun. I'm gonna miss that.

1998
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:07,280
I stopped eating pigs for
awhile. Really? I eat them now,

1999
01:47:07,281 --> 01:47:12,281
but for a long time I stopped eating them
because I watched a documentary called

2000
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:16,310
something. My brother's
keeper, I think it was,

2001
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:19,100
it was about these two guys
that were accused of a crime.

2002
01:47:19,101 --> 01:47:20,390
I forget what the crime is,
but they were,

2003
01:47:20,391 --> 01:47:25,391
they were a bit slow and they were living
in a rural area and they ran a farm

2004
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:29,360
and they,
when they went to a kill a pig,

2005
01:47:29,570 --> 01:47:31,910
you could tell the pig
knew what the fuck was up.

2006
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:33,860
You could tell the pig was running away.

2007
01:47:33,861 --> 01:47:37,460
Pig was terrified and he put that
gun up and pig's head and boom,

2008
01:47:37,461 --> 01:47:40,010
and he did it in front of the other pigs.
Pigs remember that shit.

2009
01:47:40,011 --> 01:47:42,500
They know what the fuck is going on
when you come up to him with that gun.

2010
01:47:42,770 --> 01:47:46,760
And when I saw that and I saw them like,
wow, that thinks smart. I think smart.

2011
01:47:46,761 --> 01:47:48,320
And it knows all,
they're incredibly sooner.

2012
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:50,810
People know other dirty,
filthy, disgusting animals.

2013
01:47:50,811 --> 01:47:52,280
Actually incredibly intelligent.

2014
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:55,980
That's kind of fucked
I,

2015
01:47:55,990 --> 01:48:00,990
that's the only thing that I think of
when I think of as us being like related

2016
01:48:01,421 --> 01:48:05,440
to animals. We love animals. It's only
to me it's only intelligent animals.

2017
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:09,340
But when I find out in the pig as
smart as a dog or smarter, I go, Ooh,

2018
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:13,030
that's a smart thing. And that some
people kill pigs as pets or keep picks,

2019
01:48:13,150 --> 01:48:17,440
keeps pigs rather as pets. I'm like,
Ooh, they're probably smart. Right.

2020
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:21,100
But something stupid like a fish
can suck my dick. I don't know.

2021
01:48:21,101 --> 01:48:22,350
I've never really,
you know what I mean?

2022
01:48:22,390 --> 01:48:24,620
It's like I don't keep around.
Actually, I don't feel,

2023
01:48:24,621 --> 01:48:27,040
I don't feel connected to
that fish at all. Right.

2024
01:48:27,190 --> 01:48:28,730
And I only feel connected to things.

2025
01:48:28,731 --> 01:48:32,600
I can think if I can win it in a midway
game and flush it down three weeks later

2026
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:36,470
how and shoot it in the head and the
other cows just go, what happened?

2027
01:48:37,450 --> 01:48:40,940
Well that was loud. Fucking loud as shit.
I'm going to walk you over here now.

2028
01:48:41,030 --> 01:48:43,760
Can you believe that they,
that they got flogged raw,

2029
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:47,900
like the most insane thing
helps me shots some stupid.

2030
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:53,110
Meanwhile you can eat goose so dumb.
I'm just can't eat delivery. I mean,

2031
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:56,000
how about like, look, I understand
the argument of there were certainly,

2032
01:48:56,150 --> 01:49:00,560
there was a percentage of farms that were
torturing animals essentially to make

2033
01:49:00,561 --> 01:49:03,290
it much like the way they torture
veal to make it. But yeah,

2034
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:06,590
it wasn't even that man. Have you ever
seen it? The way they, first of all,

2035
01:49:06,591 --> 01:49:11,390
the way most of them do it, the the,
the fucking ducks actually hover around

2036
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:13,550
feeding tube because they want it.
Right.

2037
01:49:13,790 --> 01:49:16,380
And people talk about being shackled
in and their heads are thrilled,

2038
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:19,220
wouldn't holding, they're using plunger
sticks to jam it down their throat.

2039
01:49:19,370 --> 01:49:21,020
That's the propaganda.
And Look,

2040
01:49:21,021 --> 01:49:24,080
I'm sure that a percentage
of farms we're doing that,

2041
01:49:24,230 --> 01:49:26,810
I'm sure people treat him like shit,
you make that illegal.

2042
01:49:26,811 --> 01:49:28,700
You don't make the
fucking biproduct illegal.

2043
01:49:28,701 --> 01:49:31,490
Why is it not okay to take that one piece,
but it's okay to take the whole,

2044
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:32,170
well it's

2045
01:49:32,170 --> 01:49:33,750
no, no, it's not legal to,

2046
01:49:33,950 --> 01:49:37,310
there's organic Fagua to where
they don't force feed them.

2047
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,160
They just use the liver.
Sure. Illegal to now.

2048
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:45,190
So let me just, all those stupid fucking
duck. It's still, you can still eat duck.

2049
01:49:45,191 --> 01:49:48,010
He could still lead goose. You can
glaze them and them from a window. They

2050
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,370
essentially made an Oregon the
preparation of an Oregon illegal.

2051
01:49:51,371 --> 01:49:53,050
It's so stupid because first of all,

2052
01:49:53,051 --> 01:49:55,680
organs are some of the most nutritious
things you can eat. You know,

2053
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,190
liver is really good for you.

2054
01:49:57,191 --> 01:50:00,970
It's like that's the reason why wolves
go for the liver as the reason why cats

2055
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,820
eat your organs. They were like
super healthy for your heart.

2056
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,410
Hearts are so healthy.

2057
01:50:05,650 --> 01:50:10,120
It's really like really like maximum
proteins just like that guy serving up his

2058
01:50:10,121 --> 01:50:12,630
dick in Japan. Do you think
in the near future, so health,

2059
01:50:13,230 --> 01:50:15,190
I'm not talking about the
nutritional aspects of it,

2060
01:50:15,191 --> 01:50:16,850
I'm telling you about the concept of eat.

2061
01:50:16,851 --> 01:50:19,780
Like there being a restaurant near future
where human organs are served because

2062
01:50:19,781 --> 01:50:22,090
they're grown in a fridge somewhere
out of petri dishes or whatever.

2063
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:25,360
Like we're going to slice into year off
the back of this mouse and you're gonna

2064
01:50:25,361 --> 01:50:28,740
eat it, but a liver or something else.
Well, you know, eating parts of human can.

2065
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:32,950
Jacob Crutchfield disease.
He can cause I'm a mad cow disease.

2066
01:50:32,951 --> 01:50:37,600
The same essential disease at
mad when mad cow is somehow you,

2067
01:50:37,601 --> 01:50:42,070
when you feed cows, brain matter of
other cows and that's what they do.

2068
01:50:42,071 --> 01:50:45,880
They grind up every fucking part of
the cow and then feed it to other cows.

2069
01:50:45,881 --> 01:50:50,140
It's really insane. Disgusting. It's not
just disgusting. It's like psychopathic.

2070
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:54,790
It's like they've done something beyond
horrendous that not only do they eat

2071
01:50:54,791 --> 01:50:57,010
these animals and murder these
animals on a regular basis,

2072
01:50:57,011 --> 01:51:00,460
but then they feed them to each
other and they feed them protein.

2073
01:51:00,670 --> 01:51:04,420
Which by the way is not what they
eat. Man. That's not their food.

2074
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:08,500
Their food is grass. Okay. And they're
not even supposed to be eating corn.

2075
01:51:08,501 --> 01:51:11,620
And the reason why they get so fucking
fat is because we feed them corn.

2076
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:14,290
Cows eat grass. That's what
they eat. That's it, period.

2077
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:17,710
So we're feeding him other cows.
Well they get this crazy mad cow disease,

2078
01:51:17,711 --> 01:51:20,620
which is essentially nature's way of
keeping you for being a fucking Cannibal,

2079
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:24,430
was the same disease that cannibals in
New Guinea, get cannibals in New Guinea,

2080
01:51:24,431 --> 01:51:27,920
get these fucking horrible neurological
disorder where they have the shakes and

2081
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:31,240
it's full fucking people, man. So I think,

2082
01:51:31,450 --> 01:51:36,450
I don't think we'll ever see a human organ
restaurant because I think if you eat

2083
01:51:36,761 --> 01:51:40,300
them, you'll probably get sick. I mean it
only makes sense. I know the prions are,

2084
01:51:40,301 --> 01:51:42,400
I believe it's brain matter
that that holds them.

2085
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:44,440
That's where they get it from initially.

2086
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:47,470
This talk is exactly what I needed because
I needed somebody to tell me that I

2087
01:51:47,471 --> 01:51:51,880
couldn't do it. That will be the
catalyst. This is my motivator to make,

2088
01:51:51,881 --> 01:51:54,160
it's a pretty incredible things
in petri dishes. Right? I mean,

2089
01:51:54,370 --> 01:51:57,130
aren't they recreating bladders now?
They done that with,

2090
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:58,880
I think they've done that with um,

2091
01:51:59,050 --> 01:52:03,310
they've created a bladder and a
and installed it into a person.

2092
01:52:03,770 --> 01:52:07,180
Yeah. There's no runtime errors.
I think a bladder, you know,

2093
01:52:07,181 --> 01:52:08,380
it's like sort of a bag,

2094
01:52:08,381 --> 01:52:11,680
so it's probably like a good safe thing
to start out with before something that

2095
01:52:11,681 --> 01:52:16,030
pumps things, you know, before they
actually make a heart right now.

2096
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:17,463
I'm sure they've done it.

2097
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:19,810
I'm sure they've done it and put
it in a chimp somewhere and popped.

2098
01:52:19,811 --> 01:52:21,610
Open the chest and let's
see if this powers it.

2099
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:25,720
Let's see what happens when we do this.
Sure. They have. Yeah, man. Chimps,

2100
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:29,050
chimps that gets tested on,
I bet they were really angry.

2101
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:34,270
Can you imagine what a fucking shit
life it is to be as smart as a champ,

2102
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:37,930
which is probably like what smarter a
chimp or a person with down syndrome.

2103
01:52:39,070 --> 01:52:41,470
Is it clothes?
I would have no idea.

2104
01:52:41,471 --> 01:52:45,650
I think down syndrome is such a wide
spectrum. Right? Like Syndrome Lord knows.

2105
01:52:45,651 --> 01:52:46,010
Yeah,
right.

2106
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,460
Because corky had a very mild
version ever from the facts of life.

2107
01:52:49,790 --> 01:52:53,220
Remember Axa was it fax facts
now that was a wonder years or

2108
01:52:57,610 --> 01:52:59,420
what was that show?
The only corky,

2109
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:02,930
no growing pains is the one
with Kirk Cameron wasn't it?

2110
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:06,080
I'm still upset that I asked that
question because I know that's,

2111
01:53:06,081 --> 01:53:08,690
that's all I'm going to get in all caps
in my Twitter feed for the next three

2112
01:53:08,691 --> 01:53:11,900
weeks. And then was life goes
on Bro. You to know Corky,

2113
01:53:13,070 --> 01:53:16,910
you remember growing pains in my arm
before Kirk Cameron became one of the most

2114
01:53:16,911 --> 01:53:18,010
awesome.
He's brilliant.

2115
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:22,450
Why is it banana shaped the way it is? I
never told you to explain that shit. Joe.

2116
01:53:22,451 --> 01:53:27,451
I actually was on a plane with Kirk
Cameron recently and he was just sitting

2117
01:53:27,671 --> 01:53:31,840
there looking so sad and depressed and I,

2118
01:53:31,870 --> 01:53:33,390
cause it was one of those things where uh,

2119
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:36,460
I was waiting for somebody else to put
like their luggage up so I was just

2120
01:53:36,461 --> 01:53:39,910
standing right next to him and he's just
sitting there like looking at his phone,

2121
01:53:39,911 --> 01:53:43,330
like looking past this phone,
not even looking what's on the screen.

2122
01:53:43,540 --> 01:53:46,540
And he just sat there and then like some
woman came up to him and he just looked

2123
01:53:46,541 --> 01:53:49,690
up and went like did those are like
little smile but it was so weird

2124
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:54,720
being too wouldn't you can imagine every
day the guy is fighting off the gay

2125
01:53:55,290 --> 01:53:57,090
with every fiber of his being.

2126
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:02,520
He is just clenching his teeth and finding
out if you really want to save Kirk

2127
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:03,211
Cameron,
this is what you do.

2128
01:54:03,211 --> 01:54:08,100
If you're a big gay guy sitting on his
lap and pull your cock out and it'll suck

2129
01:54:08,110 --> 01:54:11,730
along it like a baby to its
mother's breasts, banana peel on it.

2130
01:54:11,731 --> 01:54:16,020
First security.
That's what he's doing.

2131
01:54:16,021 --> 01:54:20,310
He's just fighting off the gay
tooth and nail and claw. And Fang.

2132
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:24,840
So funny to me how other people who are
most outspoken against homosexuality are

2133
01:54:24,841 --> 01:54:28,670
just look at him.
He's so obviously gang.

2134
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:31,200
You can't get any obviously
gayer than Kirk Cameron.

2135
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:33,450
Not there's anything wrong with
being obviously die either.

2136
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:36,420
I mean for the guy to be happy,
she'd just come out of the closet.

2137
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:38,050
All of them just come out.

2138
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:42,870
What do you think about the Tom Cruise,
Scientology, Surrey or whatever.

2139
01:54:42,871 --> 01:54:43,440
You know,

2140
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:44,191
it's amazing.

2141
01:54:44,191 --> 01:54:49,191
The Tom Cruise already has a new Ukrainian
beauty picture of him and her holding

2142
01:54:50,401 --> 01:54:54,840
hands are ready in a magazine like
a such an obviously stage picture.

2143
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:58,800
You're like, Scientology
are bad motherfuckers cause
they're still rocking it.

2144
01:54:58,801 --> 01:55:03,720
Old School in 2012 all right.
They're putting together storylines.

2145
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:07,590
They're creating like narratives.
They have like a whole fucking publicity.

2146
01:55:07,591 --> 01:55:10,290
So like,
like whole area,

2147
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:14,190
a department that like figures out how
to handle that when you Tama girlfriend

2148
01:55:14,191 --> 01:55:15,440
and we need Tahmo girlfriend.
No.

2149
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:17,740
Right. It's like a newsroom.
Like that's it. They're,

2150
01:55:17,741 --> 01:55:19,680
they're the the like the News Corp

2151
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:23,580
in New York step pitches
in New York. Shit. Okay.

2152
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:28,180
We need Tom with a hot Russian
right now and Tom. Okay,

2153
01:55:28,181 --> 01:55:30,880
you're going to go on Ellen this time
and jump on the couch and you're going to

2154
01:55:30,881 --> 01:55:31,910
say you're in love and you're,

2155
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:35,980
I don't care if you're 50 and
you want to fix your career,

2156
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:41,740
jump on that woman's couch. All
things Seaton the, the videos of them,

2157
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:44,010
like people trying to go
into their welcome to the

2158
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:47,340
public kind of festivals and them coming
out and aggressively swarming around

2159
01:55:47,341 --> 01:55:50,310
people and screaming, what's your issue?
What's your problem? What are you hiding?

2160
01:55:50,311 --> 01:55:52,650
What are you afraid of? It's
that's, that's scary shit.

2161
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:56,220
They love the cornea bigot too.
That's a big one called people bigots.

2162
01:55:58,790 --> 01:56:03,570
Scientology's fascinating organization
to me and just like the cops help people

2163
01:56:03,571 --> 01:56:05,030
though, man. No doubt about it.

2164
01:56:05,031 --> 01:56:08,370
I have a neighbor who was a scientologist
who's on Nice fucking guy, man.

2165
01:56:08,371 --> 01:56:11,040
He's a great guy and he had helped him.
Man,

2166
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:14,280
he tells you all the great things that
he did for him and how he helped his

2167
01:56:14,281 --> 01:56:14,671
business,

2168
01:56:14,671 --> 01:56:18,780
helped his life and helped us focus and
this and that and vogue and believes in

2169
01:56:18,781 --> 01:56:23,310
it. Who are you to tell them differently?
Kevin Pereira. I'm nobody. I'm nobody.

2170
01:56:23,311 --> 01:56:25,630
Joe Rogan. Do you think, um,

2171
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:30,630
how much of a Tom Cruise's life is
surrounded by Scientologists cause he just

2172
01:56:30,631 --> 01:56:33,070
like, you know, Scientology Bible got it.

2173
01:56:33,470 --> 01:56:38,180
The leaders I think is he the head guy?
He wears the pig helmet at the meeting.

2174
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:41,390
You know, like he's the one that's
like the deepest in and I think,

2175
01:56:41,391 --> 01:56:45,110
I think there's like a group of like
probably like six main players and he's

2176
01:56:45,111 --> 01:56:47,000
like the one of the head guys,
you know,

2177
01:56:48,930 --> 01:56:52,070
you've just created your own fucking
council of it. Right? Seriously.

2178
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:54,700
When they meet in their hollowed
out volcano, ever seen the video?

2179
01:56:54,730 --> 01:56:57,500
The staff were full. He's like one
of the most powerful guys ever.

2180
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:00,780
Can you pull up the video of him in the,

2181
01:57:00,781 --> 01:57:03,990
do you know the Scientology
video where he is a,

2182
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:05,360
it's a video that wasn't supposed to,

2183
01:57:05,490 --> 01:57:07,560
it was like supposed to play it like
a conference or something. Right.

2184
01:57:07,561 --> 01:57:08,860
And he was supposed to be in the,
yeah,

2185
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,630
I dunno what you had said. Tom
Cruise, creepy speech, Scientology.

2186
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:15,900
But whatever it is, they, they
had it set up and say, excuse me.

2187
01:57:15,901 --> 01:57:18,980
They had it set up in
this, um, like a hole.

2188
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:22,020
It was like a whole auditorium of people
that were like watching this tape.

2189
01:57:22,021 --> 01:57:24,660
Right. Wasn't that like cheering
along with it and shed him?

2190
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:25,503
Am I remembering that right?

2191
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:28,230
No, I think it was. And he was like
an annual meeting, like a seminar.

2192
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:30,750
Like you sit through that and then they
offer you a timeshare and then you get

2193
01:57:30,751 --> 01:57:31,584
to go skiing.

2194
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:33,360
Poor Katie Holmes,

2195
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:36,870
poor Jason. But didn't she sign out? Like
I've always heard, I've always heard, hey,

2196
01:57:36,871 --> 01:57:39,630
sign up. They sign up for it.
Yeah. And it's like, sure, but,

2197
01:57:39,631 --> 01:57:40,640
and you get this much money

2198
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:45,510
monitor career to come back. I just
wanted to be relevant, you know,

2199
01:57:45,890 --> 01:57:49,050
and guess what man, that's the only
way to do it for a lot of these girls,

2200
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:53,820
you know, these middling girls, you know,
they're doing pretty good there. Okay.

2201
01:57:53,821 --> 01:57:54,271
And you know,

2202
01:57:54,271 --> 01:57:59,271
five years goes by and she's
39 ou pass and that's it.

2203
01:57:59,851 --> 01:58:01,800
It's over.
So you've got to make a,

2204
01:58:01,801 --> 01:58:06,801
you got to bust a move before your fucking
rice runs out of the fuck it sand out

2205
01:58:07,081 --> 01:58:07,914
of the thing.
What it was

2206
01:58:08,220 --> 01:58:12,730
sand out of the hourglass or the that
thing. The old rice rice do that. Why

2207
01:58:12,730 --> 01:58:15,880
did I feel like there's a similar
measuring devices, rice and some cultures.

2208
01:58:16,150 --> 01:58:19,090
I'm sure there are. Yeah. Maybe it
was gotta be someone figured that out.

2209
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:22,210
I spend way too much time thinking
about ancient civilizations of ancient

2210
01:58:22,211 --> 01:58:24,820
cultures. Got gotta be honest with
you. Yeah, it's a real problem.

2211
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,430
It's a distraction.
From thinking about current events,

2212
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:30,190
when do you think we're going to wipe
ourselves out or upload ourselves into the

2213
01:58:30,191 --> 01:58:31,090
machines so it doesn't matter.

2214
01:58:31,091 --> 01:58:34,600
Like how soon it seems again like
it's going to happen in our lifetime.

2215
01:58:34,630 --> 01:58:37,540
It seems like the leaps
are coming so fast.

2216
01:58:37,630 --> 01:58:40,840
Did you see the new TSA screening devices?
Whitten for which?

2217
01:58:44,270 --> 01:58:49,140
Look at them all. Slapping.
He's got a metal. He did it.
It's got a metal to metal.

2218
01:58:49,530 --> 01:58:50,960
The religion,
I have never met

2219
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:55,120
a more competent the world
or background agent Cody.

2220
01:58:55,130 --> 01:59:00,130
I'm hollering and more compassionate being
outside of what I've experienced from

2221
01:59:02,970 --> 01:59:07,130
LRH and I've met the leaders of leaders.

2222
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:10,880
Okay. I've met them all.
So I say to you, sir, cob,

2223
01:59:10,881 --> 01:59:12,260
we are lucky to have you and thank you.

2224
01:59:17,370 --> 01:59:20,550
Beautiful. We will have,
it wasn't, he's beautiful.

2225
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:24,450
What's an l Ron busted on like a boat
in international waters having sex with

2226
01:59:24,451 --> 01:59:27,940
underage people. Yup. Okay. Something,
well maybe not, but I said Yup.

2227
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:32,640
What made it so there we go. Update
the Wiki. Can we just get that?

2228
01:59:32,641 --> 01:59:36,570
And that's not even the one man. There's
one where he was appearing by tape,

2229
01:59:36,571 --> 01:59:38,520
right? Yeah. Yeah. That's
the one I originally found.

2230
01:59:38,521 --> 01:59:41,100
But I thought you were talking about
that one. That was beautiful too though.

2231
01:59:41,101 --> 01:59:44,950
He's beautiful. He's just so charismatic.
Would sign up for five years with that.

2232
01:59:44,951 --> 01:59:48,570
So that should, that helped my
career. If I just had an inkling of,

2233
01:59:48,571 --> 01:59:51,030
of the possibility that maybe
he would hang out with me,

2234
01:59:52,570 --> 01:59:56,530
I could just write cultures. That's
it. I think at the music, like

2235
01:59:59,550 --> 02:00:03,960
once you know these tools and you know
that they work, it's just not good enough.

2236
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:05,700
And I'm just doing okay.

2237
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:09,960
Traveling the world and meeting
the people that I've met, you know,

2238
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:13,290
talking with these leaders,
get various fields

2239
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:23,900
they want help and they're depending on
people who know and who can be effective

2240
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:31,920
in doing
that is our responsibility to do that.

2241
02:00:32,330 --> 02:00:36,540
It is the time. Now is
the time. Stop it. Stop.

2242
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:40,950
This is beautiful. How he shot
me. Fucking beautiful. You better.

2243
02:00:42,370 --> 02:00:46,870
You better know it. And
if you don't, you know,

2244
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:49,370
go and learn it.
What?

2245
02:00:49,590 --> 02:00:53,930
Oh, that's the option. If I don't know
what I need to learn it, she's, it's not

2246
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:56,280
the end of it.
The end of it is what I wanted to hear.

2247
02:00:56,281 --> 02:00:59,010
What he says that if
you stop by an accident,

2248
02:00:59,011 --> 02:01:01,230
you know you have to do something
cause you're a scientist.

2249
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:04,250
It's an eight minute video of Sec.
Oh here I'll try to skip. Don't,

2250
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:05,740
don't make me get my dick hard.
Yeah,

2251
02:01:07,590 --> 02:01:11,530
yeah, yeah. That's too intense for me. I
just loved the music and possible music.

2252
02:01:11,531 --> 02:01:14,590
I love the, you know, I love all
of them are religious mission.

2253
02:01:14,591 --> 02:01:17,420
Should you choose to accept
it and an Iq distresses. Yeah.

2254
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:20,480
The conviction.
I love the,

2255
02:01:20,481 --> 02:01:24,940
the fake act or intensity involved in it
and I know that he's just thinking of,

2256
02:01:24,941 --> 02:01:28,570
I have one more hour this and I'm
going to fuck everyone who's got this.

2257
02:01:28,571 --> 02:01:31,070
Like 10 dudes just waiting for him,

2258
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:33,520
prepping them right now.

2259
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:35,980
Like a horse that knows he's on the end
of the trail and he's getting back to

2260
02:01:35,981 --> 02:01:38,820
the feedback there. She knows there's
12 dudes in the back of warming up.

2261
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:39,793
It might be ready

2262
02:01:41,370 --> 02:01:43,860
that I've done everything
I could every day.

2263
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:50,650
Think about those people out
there who are depending on us.

2264
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:58,410
I think it does make me, she'll

2265
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:05,470
have more work. I need more help
and I'll get those spectators.

2266
02:02:06,130 --> 02:02:08,350
You're into playing field
or out of the arena,

2267
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:14,630
the playing field or out of the
arena. That has great, yeah.

2268
02:02:14,631 --> 02:02:17,000
You're there with us who
have the answers and we have,

2269
02:02:17,001 --> 02:02:20,270
we can provide all the help
or ladies and gentlemen,

2270
02:02:20,330 --> 02:02:23,270
please watch the whole thing
because there's so much glory in it.

2271
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:28,580
There's so much awesome that's in it.
It's so ridiculous, but you know what man?

2272
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:29,960
It's like we,

2273
02:02:30,650 --> 02:02:35,650
we value charisma like that so much
that a guy like that who can step up and

2274
02:02:36,891 --> 02:02:41,891
tell you what Scientology can do to
maximize you and that you will be a better

2275
02:02:43,281 --> 02:02:48,180
person. It's not. If you don't become
a but you will be a better person.

2276
02:02:48,181 --> 02:02:48,860
Thank you very much.

2277
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:52,550
The reason you're not right now is
because you haven't joined. Come on dude.

2278
02:02:52,551 --> 02:02:57,551
How crazy do you have to be to be wearing
a metal to wear a fucking Olympic gold

2279
02:02:58,581 --> 02:03:02,510
medal bigger than the Olympic medal? The
date they said, what's the Olympic medal?

2280
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:05,210
Mega 10% bigger because this is important.

2281
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:10,240
Melt those Olympic rings into one
giant metal and make it match his eyes.

2282
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:14,780
We make it out of the gold we took from
the fillings at Auschwitz and yeah,

2283
02:03:14,830 --> 02:03:19,830
that's special evil goal that we have
saved up that we'd been a radiating and

2284
02:03:20,031 --> 02:03:22,180
saying mean things to her years.

2285
02:03:22,190 --> 02:03:27,190
One fucking pile of all the gold that
they know was made in and gotten through

2286
02:03:27,621 --> 02:03:32,120
the worst circumstances like black
beards, fucking pirate treasure. I mean,

2287
02:03:32,230 --> 02:03:34,910
we know he murdered babies for
this goal or this is the goal.

2288
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:37,730
I want mold into that. What do you think?
What do you, what are you watching?

2289
02:03:37,890 --> 02:03:41,090
The flights.
You're Tom Cruise screensaver cut.

2290
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:44,750
Then all your photos of that half naked.
Okay, stop right there. Back up a second.

2291
02:03:44,870 --> 02:03:48,140
Think about this real quick.
Look at him with Val Kilmer.

2292
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:51,320
Now think about what he looks like,
which is the fucking same.

2293
02:03:51,350 --> 02:03:55,670
He's showing him the house, but inside I'm
in this photo. What Val Kilmer? Look it.

2294
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:57,830
He's saying,
I'm getting you to the elbow.

2295
02:03:57,890 --> 02:04:02,890
I snack Kilmer Val Kilmer has continued
to age whereas Tom Cruise had,

2296
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:09,410
he got to a certain point and then just
stopped dying because he's been eating

2297
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:13,640
from a human liver restaurant and you
don't know about it yet. The Petri dish,

2298
02:04:13,641 --> 02:04:16,340
human liver restaurant,
he goes into the cryo freezer,

2299
02:04:16,341 --> 02:04:20,000
especially pigs is Oregon's as in love
with Katie's back in the day. Meanwhile,

2300
02:04:20,001 --> 02:04:23,000
what is he thinking about their cock?
That's what he's thinking about cock.

2301
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:27,210
He's thinking about cost there. He's
thinking of a cocky. He's, he's,

2302
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:29,210
he's ready for an actual yelling for cock.

2303
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:32,390
I actually want to say on the record that
I don't think he's gay and he doesn't

2304
02:04:32,391 --> 02:04:35,030
want like that because at
my name is Brian Ryko in my,

2305
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:38,160
usually my stage name is Red
Van and I disagree with everyone

2306
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:42,960
here. Mr. Cruz and I'm sorry. Oh,
what'd you do it if he doesn't,

2307
02:04:42,961 --> 02:04:45,550
even if he doesn't want cock, I
think you should try it. Yeah,

2308
02:04:45,690 --> 02:04:47,400
because it might be his thing.
Brian,

2309
02:04:47,401 --> 02:04:49,740
would you do a five year
stint with Tom Cruise?

2310
02:04:49,741 --> 02:04:53,340
If it meant unlimited wealth
and career success? Five months.

2311
02:04:53,370 --> 02:04:56,520
Let's just say five months in my compound
I have to have sex or just hang out

2312
02:04:56,521 --> 02:04:59,630
with him for Frankie have to, you have to
either fuck or be fucked by Tom Cruise.

2313
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:03,150
One of the two has to happen for sure.
Unlimited wealth. Unlimited wealth. Sure.

2314
02:05:03,210 --> 02:05:07,230
And success. Would you do now
career success five months
at Tom Cruise sex slave?

2315
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:11,940
Absolutely not. You wouldn't
for unlimited? Well No.
What does unlimited wealth?

2316
02:05:12,190 --> 02:05:14,250
I don't know. It just never
having to worry about it. Yeah,

2317
02:05:14,251 --> 02:05:18,970
but could you buy like jets
and shit? Certainly. You can
imagine if your butthole,

2318
02:05:19,150 --> 02:05:22,200
you're letting the guy fuck your
butthole was worth that much.

2319
02:05:22,550 --> 02:05:24,760
It was like there was a way you
can negotiate it. I'm sure it is.

2320
02:05:24,761 --> 02:05:26,700
This subtle salt out there somewhere now.

2321
02:05:26,701 --> 02:05:29,130
People think of it that they're like
sucked your Dick just for dinner and like,

2322
02:05:29,131 --> 02:05:32,820
really? I could've gotten unlimited
wealth if I just got a better agent.

2323
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:35,620
If we were talking about Zac Efron,
they maybe a man.

2324
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:38,740
Don't let me get lunch with those eyes.
Don't look at those. Don't, don't. Um,

2325
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:42,600
how many guys do you think are in
Hollywood that are in the closet that are

2326
02:05:42,601 --> 02:05:46,020
forced to be in the closet because
they play action star, I think.

2327
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:46,681
I think there's a,

2328
02:05:46,681 --> 02:05:49,950
I think there's a shit ton of m and I
also think there's a lot of guys who who,

2329
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:53,340
well, I mean it's like the guys who go
gay for pay, like who aren't gay guys,

2330
02:05:53,341 --> 02:05:55,680
but they're like, fuck, if I got to
take a dick to make fucking ends meet,

2331
02:05:55,681 --> 02:05:59,430
let's go crazy. Some dude's just
have lower standards. They'll,

2332
02:05:59,431 --> 02:06:02,590
they'll let things happen. Looks
maybe, maybe I call it adventurous Joe.

2333
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:05,850
Fuck you for putting a label on
anybody who might do that out there.

2334
02:06:05,851 --> 02:06:07,890
Anybody at all.
If you want to do it though.

2335
02:06:07,891 --> 02:06:11,610
It seems like a company like Scientology
is fucking awesome to have in your

2336
02:06:11,611 --> 02:06:15,010
corner. It seems like they,
I mean, I don't know. We're
just totally speculating.

2337
02:06:15,011 --> 02:06:18,750
You sure. What role, if any of
that and speculating by the way,

2338
02:06:18,751 --> 02:06:21,640
whether or not he's actually get
much surgery. Certainly. No, no.

2339
02:06:21,641 --> 02:06:22,880
It starts to be crazy.
I just,

2340
02:06:23,010 --> 02:06:27,210
the notion of a Scientology to like if
I were to join it as a, as a d list,

2341
02:06:27,211 --> 02:06:29,880
struggling actors,
web celebrity type,

2342
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:33,480
if I would have joined Scientology and
kick in a hundred grand the first year,

2343
02:06:33,690 --> 02:06:34,530
maybe 200 grand,

2344
02:06:34,531 --> 02:06:37,980
that's going to buy me to a certain level
where I'm in meetings with people who

2345
02:06:37,981 --> 02:06:41,130
are heads of movie studios and
making decisions and they go,

2346
02:06:41,131 --> 02:06:44,220
look at this young gentleman
here who's paying in and he's,

2347
02:06:44,221 --> 02:06:46,080
he's playing the game.
Let's put him in that movie,

2348
02:06:46,081 --> 02:06:48,870
getting a little bit more because we know
he's going to contribute to the church.

2349
02:06:48,871 --> 02:06:51,710
You know what, he's going to be
an ambassador. But how much that,

2350
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:53,040
how much did they actually control?

2351
02:06:53,070 --> 02:06:56,550
That's the big question is like they
obviously control Tom Cruise because he's

2352
02:06:56,551 --> 02:06:59,070
really successful. I mean,
you look at Tom Cruise,

2353
02:06:59,850 --> 02:07:02,880
Tom Cruise has been in a
bunch of really big hit movie.

2354
02:07:02,881 --> 02:07:04,230
So that's why they control him.

2355
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:07,440
That's why they handle his business
because he's a massive investment.

2356
02:07:07,441 --> 02:07:12,300
Sure he's worth a ton of money.
But how, you know he's that guy,

2357
02:07:12,450 --> 02:07:14,370
but for they're already there.
You know what I'm saying? Well,

2358
02:07:14,371 --> 02:07:17,010
how much can they do for you?
How much can they get?

2359
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:20,610
How much could they get Kevin Pereira
help? How much could they weasel you in?

2360
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:22,870
How much should it have a good
pitch? Which is, you know,

2361
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,600
maybe they'd get me a Hulu web series.

2362
02:07:24,630 --> 02:07:28,060
I know in mission impossible five
just so you know, I'll take, you know,

2363
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:30,570
that's what I mean. Like they could help
me out on a certain level. And then as,

2364
02:07:30,690 --> 02:07:32,580
as you grow with them and they help you,

2365
02:07:32,581 --> 02:07:36,190
then you contribute more and they help
groom you for that. They are essentially

2366
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:38,620
like a form of a talent agency for some,

2367
02:07:38,621 --> 02:07:41,260
I'm sure for some they're probably
a beard agency for others.

2368
02:07:41,261 --> 02:07:43,060
There are talent agency.
Do you know what I mean?

2369
02:07:43,061 --> 02:07:45,760
Like they just offer all different
servers. What do you need?

2370
02:07:45,761 --> 02:07:48,100
You're in the church now and they
have your secrets. They audit you,

2371
02:07:48,101 --> 02:07:50,500
they know all about your past and your
history and that's part of the initiation

2372
02:07:50,501 --> 02:07:54,110
process is that you divulge everything
to them. So then you hear the whole wheat

2373
02:07:54,570 --> 02:07:58,290
good. They are Cuban secrets. Amazing.
It's pretty fucking sweet. Yeah. I mean,

2374
02:07:58,291 --> 02:08:03,120
think about how many dudes that must
have the fucking inside scoop on John

2375
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:06,480
Travolta and the like, we ain't hear it.

2376
02:08:06,481 --> 02:08:08,610
Scientology or coming to do a mission.

2377
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:11,260
Wow. That was amazing.
Like was there a group on,

2378
02:08:11,261 --> 02:08:15,340
on just gay Mizuho's disorders like,
and it just came out of the woodwork.

2379
02:08:15,380 --> 02:08:18,470
Yeah. Once one guy came out
it, the guys were like, oh no,

2380
02:08:18,471 --> 02:08:20,030
he did and I'm going to get mine too.

2381
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:23,150
Yeah, absolutely. If you're stepping
forward, I am. I wonder if they got paid.

2382
02:08:23,710 --> 02:08:26,050
They got paid. My money must
have been exchanged. Well,

2383
02:08:26,060 --> 02:08:29,630
they suddenly started withdrawing
all their lawsuits and you know that,

2384
02:08:29,631 --> 02:08:33,350
I don't know if that's, maybe they
were frivolous. I don't know. But uh,

2385
02:08:33,690 --> 02:08:37,880
he's just come out. Just come
on now, dude. No one cares.
Yeah. Well look it, I mean,

2386
02:08:37,910 --> 02:08:41,900
I'm sure like Anderson Cooper recently
came out and I did that matter. I mean,

2387
02:08:41,901 --> 02:08:42,690
did that,
no,

2388
02:08:42,690 --> 02:08:46,720
the people that care suck, you know,
it's not funny that people are gay.

2389
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:49,600
What's funny is that people are
straight pretending they're gay. Right?

2390
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:52,810
Or rather gay bars. Pretentious.
Straight. That's what's funny. Right?

2391
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:55,690
It's not the actual being gay.
I know a lot of gay people,

2392
02:08:55,840 --> 02:09:00,260
but it's hilarious when there's fucking
obviously gay people like the Kirk

2393
02:09:00,260 --> 02:09:01,093
Cameron.

2394
02:09:01,340 --> 02:09:04,610
I'm just shocked whenever there's a
legislative setback and like, you know,

2395
02:09:04,670 --> 02:09:05,990
being gay in the gay rights movement,

2396
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:10,400
like you can still easily draw a line
that's parallel to any other time there's

2397
02:09:10,401 --> 02:09:15,230
been a debate involving marriage or any
other discrimination suit and you go, Yo,

2398
02:09:15,231 --> 02:09:17,900
that was wrong. We were
wrong about discriminating.
That's right. We were wrong.

2399
02:09:17,901 --> 02:09:21,860
We figured that out and yet here we
are discriminating and mass and volume

2400
02:09:21,861 --> 02:09:24,320
loudly and openly and it's,
you know,

2401
02:09:24,321 --> 02:09:28,460
it's a platform for some people
politically and that's, that's okay.

2402
02:09:28,461 --> 02:09:29,600
Right now we're okay with that.

2403
02:09:29,601 --> 02:09:32,480
Even with all the knowledge and
access to history that we have,

2404
02:09:32,750 --> 02:09:33,530
we're okay with that.

2405
02:09:33,530 --> 02:09:36,440
Well, religion is always
been the big, I mean,

2406
02:09:36,441 --> 02:09:38,750
if you want to look at one thing
that's oppresses gay people,

2407
02:09:38,780 --> 02:09:39,770
nothing has suppressed,

2408
02:09:39,771 --> 02:09:44,390
gave you more than religion and almost
every person who is against people who

2409
02:09:44,391 --> 02:09:47,210
are gay being married is
religious. I mean, that is just a,

2410
02:09:47,211 --> 02:09:51,490
it's not an ideological viewpoint. It's,
it's, it's a religious viewpoint. Sure.

2411
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:54,590
It's where it comes from there. The
ideology that, that really, that,

2412
02:09:54,591 --> 02:09:55,730
that action is,

2413
02:09:55,740 --> 02:10:00,680
is negative in any way is connected direct
directly to religion and for no one,

2414
02:10:00,681 --> 02:10:01,490
I know that's an eighth

2415
02:10:01,490 --> 02:10:05,540
for a myriad of societal issues though,
from religion to abortion to whatever.

2416
02:10:05,541 --> 02:10:07,820
I mean, the main thing people say,
well, it's a political issue now.

2417
02:10:07,821 --> 02:10:11,750
It's actually a religious issue
and one political side. At times.

2418
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:14,510
It ebbs and flows. We'll side
more with religions. Well,

2419
02:10:14,511 --> 02:10:16,040
it's traditionally Republican,
but

2420
02:10:16,570 --> 02:10:18,970
Ronald Reagan,
Ronald Reagan started all that shit off.

2421
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,820
That's where the big slide in
this country came before then,

2422
02:10:21,821 --> 02:10:25,450
religion really was separated from
politics. It wasn't a big thing,

2423
02:10:25,451 --> 02:10:29,860
but the Ronald Reagan, they went
after the fucking religious right.

2424
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:31,780
They knew they were a powerful force.

2425
02:10:31,781 --> 02:10:35,650
They knew they could rally up and they
could protest and they could, you know,

2426
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:36,950
they could,
they could do

2427
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:38,710
payment,
hand out the pamphlets,

2428
02:10:38,711 --> 02:10:41,820
tell every Sunday beam the message into
people's heads if that's the whales,

2429
02:10:42,310 --> 02:10:45,730
fucking mindless drones that need a,
a purpose to live,

2430
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:49,990
are happy to be a part of
that organization and they
were in locked in those

2431
02:10:49,991 --> 02:10:51,010
sons of bitches.

2432
02:10:51,660 --> 02:10:56,250
I always think though, I got to figure
out, for me what my spiritual parallel is,

2433
02:10:56,251 --> 02:10:58,320
because every story that I read about,
you know,

2434
02:10:58,321 --> 02:11:02,190
everything from placebo effect to
spiritual people heal quicker because they

2435
02:11:02,191 --> 02:11:03,540
believe that they will heal quicker.

2436
02:11:03,541 --> 02:11:07,110
I've got to figure out the proper way and
the healthy way to unlock that with me

2437
02:11:07,111 --> 02:11:10,530
because I'm such a skeptic
about everything and that
help you that with any pill,

2438
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:13,020
with any drug, with any, anything,
even just positive thought,

2439
02:11:13,170 --> 02:11:16,830
I'll eventually convinced myself that it
will not work. I can help you. Oh please,

2440
02:11:16,860 --> 02:11:17,640
sure

2441
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:20,160
I've already conquered this.
Didn't help you tremendously.

2442
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:24,000
He life is a simulation and it's
a simulation for your own benefit.

2443
02:11:24,001 --> 02:11:24,781
You live in a future,

2444
02:11:24,781 --> 02:11:28,710
a sexless future where people take
orgasm pills and most breeding is done

2445
02:11:28,711 --> 02:11:33,150
through some sort of a
genetic manipulation where
he just fucking recreate

2446
02:11:33,151 --> 02:11:36,930
people in laboratories and there's no sex,
there's no meat.

2447
02:11:37,170 --> 02:11:41,880
You don't eat steak, you don't talk,
you use your brain and it's beautiful.

2448
02:11:41,881 --> 02:11:44,250
And we've organized and you know,

2449
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:48,960
basically evolved past the
point of physical violence
and pleasure and all sorts

2450
02:11:48,961 --> 02:11:51,270
of different things that are
essentially just tricks of genetics.

2451
02:11:51,630 --> 02:11:55,440
But it's boring. No one's getting their
dick sucked the music fucking terrible.

2452
02:11:55,590 --> 02:12:00,480
You can't go out and get a good steak.
So we have decided to,

2453
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:05,720
in case our consciousness in a simulation
and the simulation is we are in the

2454
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:07,740
roaring twenties of the technology age.

2455
02:12:07,741 --> 02:12:10,080
We live back in a time
where things were crazy.

2456
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:14,550
We could go to a store and buy a fucking
600 horsepower car and just drive.

2457
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:18,690
The speed limit is 55 miles
an hour rank rank. Meanwhile,

2458
02:12:18,691 --> 02:12:22,230
you can go buy a Shelby Mustang,
600 fucking horse.

2459
02:12:22,260 --> 02:12:24,240
So were the matrix,
but we got to pay for patches,

2460
02:12:25,070 --> 02:12:25,940
Peng,
and it's,

2461
02:12:26,020 --> 02:12:30,700
that's part of the fun of it all is that
everything is corrupt and ridiculous.

2462
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:34,300
Part of the fun of a Batman movies
effect. There's bad guys. Okay.

2463
02:12:34,510 --> 02:12:38,230
Part of the fun of a of our
life is the fact that yeah,

2464
02:12:38,231 --> 02:12:41,650
we do live in this ridiculously
corrupt society. Yeah. When you,

2465
02:12:41,651 --> 02:12:45,220
when you raise your voice and you,
you stand up and you tell people,

2466
02:12:45,221 --> 02:12:48,520
this is fucking bullshit. That does
feel good. It's part of the game.

2467
02:12:48,730 --> 02:12:52,610
It's all part of the fun and reality. It
doesn't, it doesn't matter at all. You're,

2468
02:12:52,611 --> 02:12:55,630
you're a simulation and you
probably will never die. You will,

2469
02:12:55,631 --> 02:13:00,190
you will live in this simulation and it
will fucking blackout one day and you'll

2470
02:13:00,191 --> 02:13:03,100
wake up in the middle
of a fucking, uh, uh,

2471
02:13:03,250 --> 02:13:06,760
some sort of a forest fire with your
friends and your, you're working in the,

2472
02:13:06,930 --> 02:13:10,390
in the, in the blazing heat trying to put
out this fire and that's your real life

2473
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:11,500
because you,
you know,

2474
02:13:11,930 --> 02:13:16,150
you woke up in some new reality and then
it's going to keep going on, on a table,

2475
02:13:16,151 --> 02:13:20,950
licking salt. It'll go on forever.
There's no ending. You don't get a break.

2476
02:13:20,951 --> 02:13:21,280
You know,

2477
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:25,870
you don't get to sit behind the pearly
gates someday and reminisce and try to

2478
02:13:25,871 --> 02:13:28,090
figure out if it all went
the way you wanted it to.

2479
02:13:28,091 --> 02:13:30,180
And well next time I'm going
to come back as a baby. No,

2480
02:13:30,190 --> 02:13:32,960
it's just one thing that never ends.
The leaving.

2481
02:13:32,980 --> 02:13:36,150
That doesn't make me feel like my plantar
fasciitis is going to heal quicker.

2482
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:38,340
Well you got to put yourself
in a different state of mind.

2483
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:42,210
You got to decide with your mind cause
that's how you control this video game.

2484
02:13:42,420 --> 02:13:46,980
You got to decide with your mind to be
the hero in your own story and that if

2485
02:13:46,981 --> 02:13:49,650
you were going to be the hero in your
own story and the story was going to be

2486
02:13:49,651 --> 02:13:52,200
fucking bad ass,
what were the hero do right now?

2487
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:54,860
How would the hero get his shit
together? It's a long, I need to do it.

2488
02:13:54,861 --> 02:13:58,860
I need to invent dragons and dragons and
hover boards set. Maybe you could do it.

2489
02:13:58,861 --> 02:14:02,130
That's the calling. If that's your
calling, that's everybody has one,

2490
02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:03,600
but whatever your calling is,

2491
02:14:03,630 --> 02:14:06,660
you just got to decide you're the hero
in the story. What would the hero do?

2492
02:14:07,290 --> 02:14:10,580
It's really not that hard.
This fucking air conditioning sucks.

2493
02:14:10,650 --> 02:14:12,660
Yeah, it's pretty broad. You don't mind

2494
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:17,610
if I could let him in here just so he
can look at it and check things. Oh,

2495
02:14:17,611 --> 02:14:20,460
we're doing podcasts.
Jesus Christ right now. No,

2496
02:14:20,461 --> 02:14:22,920
I mean like if you can just walk in
the background, you know this is,

2497
02:14:22,921 --> 02:14:24,770
we want to come back
right now. Yeah, yeah,

2498
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:28,350
yeah, sure. Okay, cool. Got It. I think
we're going to just wrap this up anyway.

2499
02:14:28,351 --> 02:14:32,070
Right? Are we done? What
time is it? Two hours.

2500
02:14:32,071 --> 02:14:35,070
15 do you wanna keep talking?
Happy to if you'd like.

2501
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:36,210
Let's let that dude come in here and

2502
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:39,360
all right. It's pretty, it's
really hot. It's swampy.

2503
02:14:39,361 --> 02:14:43,290
I hear tropical birds crying and
my taint right now, it is rough.

2504
02:14:43,291 --> 02:14:44,300
You could rent a boat through it.

2505
02:14:44,350 --> 02:14:47,860
The poor air conditioning is
trying to do something ridiculous.

2506
02:14:47,861 --> 02:14:51,040
This place is filled with holes.
If you look at all these doors right here,

2507
02:14:51,041 --> 02:14:53,990
you could see straight through. There's
no insulation in this place. Sure.

2508
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:55,630
There's a fucking windows right there.

2509
02:14:55,631 --> 02:15:00,631
The Sun comes blazing down those
windows and it's 106 degrees outside and

2510
02:15:01,031 --> 02:15:05,320
there's rabid bats in Pasadena. Have
you heard about that shit, dude?

2511
02:15:05,380 --> 02:15:07,360
They found a rabid bat in Pasadena.

2512
02:15:07,390 --> 02:15:10,420
Now they're warning the residents in
this particular area where we're at,

2513
02:15:10,420 --> 02:15:14,170
they says viral marketing, Vat about
marketing for a new Batman movie.

2514
02:15:14,470 --> 02:15:16,060
It's all it is.
This is leading up to comicon.

2515
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:17,570
Could you imagine those sons of bitches?

2516
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:19,340
Can you imagine if they
started manipulating the news?

2517
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:22,950
They said, I mean, look, shitty movies.
Certainly. If you think so. Yeah. Well,

2518
02:15:22,951 --> 02:15:24,930
I mean maybe not releasing a rabid bat,

2519
02:15:24,931 --> 02:15:28,260
but I mean releasing the news report
about it. It would certainly do that.

2520
02:15:28,340 --> 02:15:30,750
We're going to bioengineer some,

2521
02:15:30,890 --> 02:15:35,090
some rats and give them a a poison and
then send them out for the new movie.

2522
02:15:35,091 --> 02:15:39,630
Willard, we're pretty sure we know
how to stop him. We're going to just,

2523
02:15:39,820 --> 02:15:40,260
they did that.

2524
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:43,190
They would really attracted to blood with
the blood in the streets all come out.

2525
02:15:43,191 --> 02:15:44,024
We'll kill them all.
Don't worry.

2526
02:15:44,030 --> 02:15:45,230
That would do that at comicon.

2527
02:15:45,231 --> 02:15:48,920
They need to just release a patient zero
at comicon to promote the new resident

2528
02:15:48,921 --> 02:15:51,470
evil and just let them walk around
and know that one guy at comicon,

2529
02:15:51,471 --> 02:15:55,100
if you meet them, you get
a free tee shirt, but I'll
also give you a Zombie aids.

2530
02:15:55,290 --> 02:15:57,960
Have you seen the giant rats
they found in New York City?

2531
02:15:58,210 --> 02:16:00,210
Some of them they found in the Bronx.
Well,

2532
02:16:00,211 --> 02:16:03,570
apparently it's a type of rat that's like,
uh,

2533
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:07,770
let me, let me Google this. It's,
Brian isn't here, but it's a,

2534
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:11,970
it's a huge fucking rat.
Like so big. Like you,

2535
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:17,020
you look at it and you'll wait
Iranian size or like clydesdale size.

2536
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:20,860
I'm talking like, like, like
a Johnson. Really? Yeah.

2537
02:16:20,910 --> 02:16:25,440
Like one of those dots in New York.
Yeah.

2538
02:16:25,441 --> 02:16:28,440
There it is. It's on a
fucking, it's crazy, man.

2539
02:16:28,620 --> 02:16:32,500
It's on a spear and there,
there's more than one of them.

2540
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:34,360
One of them they killed.

2541
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:38,530
They're sending exterminators into the
sewers with spheres to kill these rats.

2542
02:16:39,390 --> 02:16:44,250
The size of that got killed it
with a pitchfork. Oh Shit. Yeah.

2543
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:48,920
Yeah. They're, they're, they're
not a rabbit or ferret or songs.

2544
02:16:49,810 --> 02:16:51,580
It's apparently a type of rat.

2545
02:16:51,640 --> 02:16:56,640
It's not like a regular street rat that
people have had as pets and released and

2546
02:16:57,491 --> 02:16:59,830
apparently they get fucking big man.

2547
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:04,300
And that's right to see where
people have always, you know,

2548
02:17:04,301 --> 02:17:06,610
heard about rats in New York
City. Like, yeah. It's rats.

2549
02:17:06,611 --> 02:17:10,180
The size of catch in New York
City. Well, there really are. Yeah.

2550
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:12,250
Those are cruising around surface streets.

2551
02:17:12,251 --> 02:17:15,130
That's not like miles under the ground
and a sewage tunnel or something.

2552
02:17:15,131 --> 02:17:18,100
Those guys are running around. Oh yeah,
they were there in houses and Shit.

2553
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:21,670
You know, they're digging their way
into people's houses. Jesus. Yeah.

2554
02:17:21,700 --> 02:17:22,690
There's other,

2555
02:17:22,691 --> 02:17:27,691
there's another rat that they've found
a in a shoe shop and it was insanely big

2556
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:31,960
here. It's going to get to the point
where cockroaches are this one right here,

2557
02:17:31,970 --> 02:17:35,730
the size, like the size of this
rap, they found this rat in a, um,

2558
02:17:36,190 --> 02:17:40,340
in a shoe shop in New York City.
Uh,

2559
02:17:41,170 --> 02:17:45,250
it looks like a shovel. The size
of that fucking thing. Yeah,

2560
02:17:46,030 --> 02:17:50,590
it's a cat. Insane. And meanwhile there's
this many of them as there are people

2561
02:17:53,290 --> 02:17:56,440
in New York City's as many, I hope they
don't ever figure out how to organize

2562
02:17:57,940 --> 02:18:01,820
God. Why if one rat was coming out,
you'd shit your pants. You know,

2563
02:18:02,150 --> 02:18:04,840
I just freak out when I see
a spider the size of a dime.

2564
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:07,870
But the coming down from the reality
is they're eating something, right?

2565
02:18:07,871 --> 02:18:10,420
So there's gotta be, it's
like set up, it's set up.

2566
02:18:10,421 --> 02:18:11,770
This is their part of the ecosystem.

2567
02:18:11,771 --> 02:18:16,771
It's just a part that nobody in those
fancy towers once ever think about who,

2568
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:19,480
what, what is, what is
pray for that route?

2569
02:18:19,481 --> 02:18:22,600
Are they eating other giant rats
that side's dumpster diving,

2570
02:18:22,601 --> 02:18:26,260
like certainly eat each other. I've, I've
had rats in my garage, in each other.

2571
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:27,670
I killed a big rat,

2572
02:18:27,671 --> 02:18:31,270
wants left the body out in the
garage that got killed in a trap.

2573
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:33,250
It was like midnight.
I didn't feel like I was lazy.

2574
02:18:33,251 --> 02:18:35,530
I didn't feel like cleaning the travel.
So I'll fucking clean it tomorrow.

2575
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:38,530
I went out there tomorrow and the rat
was gone. Everything but the tail,

2576
02:18:38,531 --> 02:18:42,670
they had eaten them. Jesus had his
bones, dude, they had everything. I mean,

2577
02:18:42,671 --> 02:18:46,120
it was crazy. There's, it
just left a little bit of
skin and some like, you know,

2578
02:18:46,121 --> 02:18:49,750
parts of their feet. I mean, it was
insane. Just enough to identify the body.

2579
02:18:49,990 --> 02:18:53,200
And these were big fucking
rats to the rats in the,

2580
02:18:53,201 --> 02:18:56,470
I was in Encino and the time and
the hills, you know, above, um,

2581
02:18:57,190 --> 02:18:59,650
above the valley who's
a lot of rats up there.

2582
02:18:59,710 --> 02:19:04,270
God damn was a lot of rats and coyotes
everywhere. I mean you want to,

2583
02:19:04,420 --> 02:19:06,040
they're just those ones,
the fuckers,

2584
02:19:06,070 --> 02:19:09,130
they just keep checking in with mother
nature to see if we wiped ourselves out

2585
02:19:09,131 --> 02:19:13,300
yet. They're like looking around.
Nope. Nope. Lights are still on. Yeah,

2586
02:19:13,301 --> 02:19:16,030
there's still people here. Yeah,
we're waiting. We're waiting.

2587
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:18,690
We're waiting till we take it over again.
And it's not daisy yet.

2588
02:19:18,700 --> 02:19:20,320
You guys have a nuke each
other. Okay. All right.

2589
02:19:20,321 --> 02:19:23,650
Well we'll cruise back and then come
back out. We'll run towards the blast.

2590
02:19:23,860 --> 02:19:25,810
When there's a nuclear blast,
they're going to run towards it.

2591
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:28,220
Just start fucking just eating

2592
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:31,880
the first thing they find first, the
first dead person they find. Have you, uh,

2593
02:19:31,881 --> 02:19:34,340
have you heard about this? Uh,
it's the, the game called daisy.

2594
02:19:34,341 --> 02:19:38,420
It's an add on to this. This is very
realistic. Military Simulator Arma two.

2595
02:19:38,421 --> 02:19:39,081
But they,
they,

2596
02:19:39,081 --> 02:19:43,370
this guy made like one guy is making a
little indie game called daisy and you

2597
02:19:43,371 --> 02:19:44,061
start off on it.

2598
02:19:44,061 --> 02:19:47,060
It's online and you're completely
defenseless and helpless and on your own.

2599
02:19:47,240 --> 02:19:50,300
And there's a small Zombie outbreak and
there's a lot of human beings running

2600
02:19:50,301 --> 02:19:53,930
around and you very quickly have to figure
out what is more threatening to you.

2601
02:19:53,931 --> 02:19:57,300
You have to get your gun, get your food,
get your ammo, like try to meet up.

2602
02:19:57,350 --> 02:19:59,120
You can meet up with random
people and talk to them,

2603
02:19:59,121 --> 02:20:02,060
but nine times out of 10 that random
person's going to shoot you in the face.

2604
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:05,450
And that's what's so insane is that like
they built the simulator where it's a

2605
02:20:05,451 --> 02:20:08,210
Zombie outbreak, but just like
the real Zombie outbreak would be,

2606
02:20:08,360 --> 02:20:10,250
the real threat are your
fellow human beings.

2607
02:20:10,250 --> 02:20:13,820
It has nothing to do with the
zombies, you know? Yeah. In fact,

2608
02:20:13,821 --> 02:20:15,310
one guy a blogged,

2609
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:18,200
he was in a town like clearing it and
these dudes came out of the bush with

2610
02:20:18,201 --> 02:20:21,980
automatic rifles and like camouflage in
the average lifespan for this game is

2611
02:20:21,981 --> 02:20:24,200
only like a handful of hours.
Most people get in,

2612
02:20:24,201 --> 02:20:27,290
they scrounge around people kill people
kill you. Cause they can. Yeah, exactly.

2613
02:20:27,291 --> 02:20:28,880
They'll take your supplies.
Once you see that you're good enough.

2614
02:20:28,881 --> 02:20:32,120
So you have to really take care of your
character and be stealthy and then try

2615
02:20:32,121 --> 02:20:32,780
to build it up.

2616
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:35,870
So this guy is in the middle of the
city and like six dudes pop out,

2617
02:20:35,871 --> 02:20:37,010
put them at gunpoint and they said,

2618
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:40,610
we're going to kill you unless you become
our slave. And the guy was like, fuck,

2619
02:20:40,611 --> 02:20:42,320
I don't want to lose my
character. And they said, listen,

2620
02:20:42,321 --> 02:20:45,170
you just follow us around for a few hours
to send you into cities to scout for

2621
02:20:45,171 --> 02:20:47,540
us.
We'll defend you if you get attacked,

2622
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:49,880
but you have to be our slave and do what
we say or else we're going to kill you

2623
02:20:49,881 --> 02:20:51,620
right now. And the guy was
like, all right, let's do this.

2624
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:53,510
They made them kneel and pose for photos.

2625
02:20:53,690 --> 02:20:55,430
He was like a catch like people do this.

2626
02:20:55,670 --> 02:20:58,850
And he said that at the end of it like
that he went into cities and scouted for

2627
02:20:58,851 --> 02:21:02,450
him and he really felt like he was one
with the group after a few hours and then

2628
02:21:02,451 --> 02:21:05,780
like he went and they went to like clear
a bus and they got ambushed and slowly

2629
02:21:05,781 --> 02:21:09,020
one by one they were all getting killed
and he felt so bad. He was like, Oh man,

2630
02:21:09,021 --> 02:21:14,021
my group got killed and he quickly
identified with a group of online captors

2631
02:21:14,390 --> 02:21:16,060
were Stockholm Syndrome.
Yeah.

2632
02:21:16,070 --> 02:21:18,760
But in the matter of minutes in
the virtual world of like, well uh,

2633
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,870
all right I guess I'll go along with you.
Here we go.

2634
02:21:20,900 --> 02:21:24,110
Well you could say that that guy's
an idiot. Well I mean what else,

2635
02:21:24,111 --> 02:21:27,410
what were his choices?
Play another game sucks so much

2636
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:33,920
Twitter form just allowed
someone to be a cunt anonymously.

2637
02:21:34,190 --> 02:21:38,210
You can't have that, you
know that's that's that's
those are work. Does it work?

2638
02:21:39,140 --> 02:21:41,870
Can you came?
That's how all online games are.

2639
02:21:41,871 --> 02:21:44,810
That's why 12 year olds call you with
current and you know tea bag you every

2640
02:21:44,811 --> 02:21:47,660
five seconds every on ongoing
that just veneer of anonymity.

2641
02:21:47,810 --> 02:21:52,160
Lets people eviscerate each other. It
brings out the worst Torsten human beings.

2642
02:21:52,310 --> 02:21:54,890
Well, when ever you have no
consequences for your actions.

2643
02:21:55,720 --> 02:21:59,450
It's a weird thing that we figured out
how to do is that everyone's getting

2644
02:21:59,451 --> 02:22:01,130
connected.
But in doing so,

2645
02:22:01,131 --> 02:22:05,300
there's going to be some sort of a weird
period where it's still sort of working

2646
02:22:05,301 --> 02:22:09,680
itself out where there's anonymity
and interaction at the same time.

2647
02:22:09,710 --> 02:22:11,450
And that's sort of where
we're at right now. Yeah.

2648
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:14,690
We have both anonymity and interact.
Hyper interaction.

2649
02:22:14,691 --> 02:22:17,810
Hyperconnectivity really can't even
take place anywhere else. I mean,

2650
02:22:17,811 --> 02:22:21,650
how else could that even take place
except the Internet in the nature and the

2651
02:22:21,651 --> 02:22:25,980
natural world that devry no fail
safes. Well, I got a hole in an adult

2652
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:26,550
theater.

2653
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:29,340
Even then you can fuck somebody else and
not know who was on the other side of

2654
02:22:29,341 --> 02:22:30,174
the divide.
You could

2655
02:22:30,260 --> 02:22:34,610
good. Then I feel your teeth stop, stop,
stop. And even then there's consequences.

2656
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:36,520
Sure. How you feel bad
about your Dick Sucking job?

2657
02:22:36,760 --> 02:22:38,670
Well, you know what's funny
is I fork a Dick and a glory.

2658
02:22:39,130 --> 02:22:42,790
What's this world coming
to? Fucking Twitter. You are
useless. Your Dad was right,

2659
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:44,340
but I have found that like when,
uh,

2660
02:22:44,530 --> 02:22:49,240
when people will tweet something negative
to me, which is constantly, if I reply,

2661
02:22:49,241 --> 02:22:52,240
if I spent half a second to reply and
let them know that I actually listened to

2662
02:22:52,241 --> 02:22:56,440
their criticism or, you know, I'm sorry
you thought that what I said was terrible,

2663
02:22:56,441 --> 02:23:00,490
but here's why I believe it was just
that ounce of attention actually makes

2664
02:23:00,491 --> 02:23:03,280
people Apollo. I mean certainly there
are trolls. Certainly there are trolls,

2665
02:23:03,460 --> 02:23:03,880
but I've been,

2666
02:23:03,880 --> 02:23:07,180
I've been pleasantly surprised at how
open people are once you kind of call them

2667
02:23:07,181 --> 02:23:10,840
out on, you're kinda being a Dick Right
now, but I do respect your opinion.

2668
02:23:10,870 --> 02:23:12,940
It's really funny. Yes. I'm that equalizer

2669
02:23:13,430 --> 02:23:14,263
possible.
Yeah.

2670
02:23:14,270 --> 02:23:17,790
A lot of times we're just trying to get
a reaction and certainly there is just,

2671
02:23:17,810 --> 02:23:20,750
there's a lot of cons out there that are
just jealous to the jealous of the fact

2672
02:23:20,751 --> 02:23:23,300
that they know who you are and
you don't know who they are,

2673
02:23:23,301 --> 02:23:26,840
so they lash out at you just because of
that. They see you on the show is like,

2674
02:23:26,841 --> 02:23:30,000
he's not even really a geek.
I'm a real deep,

2675
02:23:31,140 --> 02:23:35,150
I love the Geek test. I love
that. They're so silly. Yeah.

2676
02:23:35,260 --> 02:23:37,150
People love just like things going in.

2677
02:23:37,270 --> 02:23:42,270
Like if you ever gone on a fucking website
that reviews cars and dudes will go

2678
02:23:42,401 --> 02:23:45,040
on about how automatic
transmissions are for fags.

2679
02:23:46,390 --> 02:23:50,890
Dude's we'll have like like,
oh wow, automatics are gay.

2680
02:23:50,891 --> 02:23:51,950
They'll like get angry.

2681
02:23:52,050 --> 02:23:55,590
You don't shift. You don't even get to
put your hand on a knob. How gay is that?

2682
02:23:56,040 --> 02:24:00,600
Think really. You get so connected to
the road. It's like almost the vibration.

2683
02:24:00,690 --> 02:24:05,130
Anything to be angry about it, they'll
find anything to relate to anything.

2684
02:24:05,250 --> 02:24:08,010
You know what I mean? Many people are
mad at us for shitting on windows today.

2685
02:24:08,210 --> 02:24:11,650
I bet a hundred tweets.
Oh you mad facts.

2686
02:24:11,670 --> 02:24:13,830
Just don't understand
what a run time error.

2687
02:24:14,910 --> 02:24:15,360
I love it.

2688
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:17,760
I recently bought a gaming laptop and
was like tweeting out about it and I'm

2689
02:24:17,761 --> 02:24:21,990
like, this is great. And you know, not
only did I get from the Mac fans, I got,

2690
02:24:22,020 --> 02:24:24,900
oh you went back to windows,
you're running a windows
machine. That's a mistake.

2691
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:26,760
Then from gamers who should be,

2692
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:30,630
who should be supporting anybody
who's playing PC games or laptop.

2693
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,550
Oh that must be cause you
love Dick in your eye. Right.

2694
02:24:32,610 --> 02:24:36,920
That's why you went for a laptop because
you didn't get a tower and you didn't,

2695
02:24:36,930 --> 02:24:38,860
oh you didn't water
cooler, whatever. Yeah,

2696
02:24:38,910 --> 02:24:40,920
you don't even overclock
and at some guy got,

2697
02:24:40,980 --> 02:24:45,000
I yelled at the Nvidia Graphics Card
Company. I was having a problem.

2698
02:24:45,001 --> 02:24:46,860
They weren't supporting
the hardware that I bought.

2699
02:24:46,861 --> 02:24:49,920
He spent thousands of dollars on a machine
and they don't officially support the

2700
02:24:49,921 --> 02:24:52,740
hardware that's in it yet. Like you
couldn't download a driver for it.

2701
02:24:52,830 --> 02:24:54,900
First World fucking problem.
I'm well aware of that,

2702
02:24:55,080 --> 02:24:57,810
but I was against it and I tweeted it
out and I got so many people that were

2703
02:24:57,811 --> 02:25:02,610
like, dude, download the Linux
distro driver. Happy the inf file.

2704
02:25:02,611 --> 02:25:06,840
Fucking right. Here's a five page tutorial
and how to do it. Fucking get it going.

2705
02:25:06,841 --> 02:25:10,740
And I'm like, really? That's not,
that's not worth my time or money.

2706
02:25:10,741 --> 02:25:13,020
And that's how you're
choosing to chastise me.

2707
02:25:13,110 --> 02:25:15,330
I appreciate that people are into
that. I appreciate it. Totally.

2708
02:25:15,331 --> 02:25:18,240
I used to be one of those guys,
but Linux computer and I used to,

2709
02:25:18,250 --> 02:25:20,430
I was a Unix guy.
I was a coder like for sure.

2710
02:25:20,431 --> 02:25:23,200
But did you do like what is the most
impressive piece of code? You have a road?

2711
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:24,100
Um,

2712
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:25,300
well I shouldn't say that.
I,

2713
02:25:25,301 --> 02:25:28,000
I guess that was more load balancer
and stuff for like, uh, for,

2714
02:25:28,070 --> 02:25:29,080
for routers and stuff.

2715
02:25:29,081 --> 02:25:31,960
So I would balance the way packets
were distributed and the uh,

2716
02:25:31,961 --> 02:25:33,790
the boxes at an ISP.
Oh really?

2717
02:25:33,791 --> 02:25:38,430
So you worked at an ISP balancing pack
and that was one of many yeah, jobs ever.

2718
02:25:38,480 --> 02:25:42,520
You do that, what do you do? I
was at work go into, go into inf,

2719
02:25:42,550 --> 02:25:43,241
well not nine to five,

2720
02:25:43,241 --> 02:25:46,360
but you go into files and basically
look at the way packets are routed by IP

2721
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:50,170
address and packet type and you assign
priorities to them and you make sure that

2722
02:25:50,171 --> 02:25:53,500
the servers can talk to each other.
So one servers and taking on everything.

2723
02:25:53,501 --> 02:25:56,770
It's distributing this sort of
network load against everything else.

2724
02:25:56,771 --> 02:25:59,830
But I mean that was, there was
that there'd be phone tech support.

2725
02:25:59,831 --> 02:26:04,270
They would be writing visual
basic installers for windows
three one and dealing

2726
02:26:04,271 --> 02:26:07,690
with wind sock errors and all sorts of
crazy shit when the barrier to entry to

2727
02:26:07,691 --> 02:26:09,470
get online was actually pretty fun.

2728
02:26:09,570 --> 02:26:14,140
Difficult. What year were you online?
Was the first year what? AOL Was it? No,

2729
02:26:14,520 --> 02:26:17,460
it wasn't an [inaudible]. That's,
I'm so beautiful. Have male.

2730
02:26:17,461 --> 02:26:20,640
I feel so privileged to have
not experienced the internet
through prodigy or AOL.

2731
02:26:20,641 --> 02:26:22,980
At first I used something called the
knowledge network routers you is for

2732
02:26:22,981 --> 02:26:26,860
serious people. Prodigy was for low.
Remember project did you really?

2733
02:26:26,910 --> 02:26:30,120
Customer service.
Okay.

2734
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:32,730
We're going to pretend that
we're calling you and Kevin,

2735
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:36,060
you're the color and you've got
an issue and you call him Brian.

2736
02:26:36,061 --> 02:26:38,130
You're the customer service
guy is actually called tech,

2737
02:26:38,131 --> 02:26:42,570
which was a company that routed prodigy
because through them and they I did

2738
02:26:42,571 --> 02:26:46,470
prodigy and like this is back when call
centers were handled in the u s still,

2739
02:26:46,471 --> 02:26:49,970
right? Yeah, so you call ready go Brian.

2740
02:26:50,010 --> 02:26:51,390
I want to know how you're
going to fucking greet me.

2741
02:26:51,391 --> 02:26:54,570
I'm not going to be greeted on the
customer needs to be a spiel. Hello,

2742
02:26:54,571 --> 02:26:59,010
my name is Brian and my ticket
master one thing's gone.

2743
02:26:59,140 --> 02:27:01,620

is the preferred method of payment.

2744
02:27:01,621 --> 02:27:04,800
This call may be monitored for quality
assurance purposes by a supervisor.

2745
02:27:04,801 --> 02:27:06,370
This is Brian speaking.
How can I help you?

2746
02:27:06,790 --> 02:27:09,810
You can American Express

2747
02:27:11,260 --> 02:27:13,680
the preferred preferred sponsor,
what's that all about?

2748
02:27:13,740 --> 02:27:15,870
And they would probably paid for
that little shit. There's a kickback,

2749
02:27:15,871 --> 02:27:16,740
well amax does

2750
02:27:16,820 --> 02:27:18,940
early like if,
if you'd let you,

2751
02:27:18,941 --> 02:27:22,280
I'm certain Amex cards get you early
access to certain ticket master events.

2752
02:27:22,281 --> 02:27:27,170
It's all one big promotional
kickback madness sons.

2753
02:27:27,350 --> 02:27:29,860
It was crazy throwing a live
event and seeing just how that,

2754
02:27:29,870 --> 02:27:31,460
that industry needs to be disrupted.

2755
02:27:31,470 --> 02:27:36,020
So bad for live events like ticket
sales, like we want it. We, we were,

2756
02:27:36,050 --> 02:27:38,990
we were charged charging
essentially a $7 ticket for lead up.

2757
02:27:39,020 --> 02:27:40,280
That's what we were asking,

2758
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:44,450
which turned into a $25
ticket after convenience fees,

2759
02:27:44,451 --> 02:27:48,500
processing charges, the house gets
their cut like everything on our ticket,

2760
02:27:48,950 --> 02:27:51,260
$7 and it ended up costing 25.

2761
02:27:51,261 --> 02:27:54,500
And that's what it has to do that
when I do concerts and, uh, in,

2762
02:27:54,501 --> 02:27:57,920
in certain venues, but after to
feel like they have to get paid to,

2763
02:27:57,950 --> 02:28:00,700
why else would they have a theater if
they're not getting money? Well, the, the,

2764
02:28:00,701 --> 02:28:03,710
the theater, the theater is getting a very
small fee on that, on that ticket fee.

2765
02:28:03,710 --> 02:28:03,921
Right?

2766
02:28:03,921 --> 02:28:06,020
They're getting a very small amount that
he was gonna make their money off of

2767
02:28:06,021 --> 02:28:08,990
the door and are off of, off of
parking and off of food and beverage.

2768
02:28:09,020 --> 02:28:11,720
Mosley who's fucking
you then? Um, you know,

2769
02:28:12,020 --> 02:28:14,480
I think they're still partners on some
of our leadup tours that we haven't

2770
02:28:14,481 --> 02:28:17,490
completely divorced ourselves.
But I love what Louis C K is doing,

2771
02:28:17,870 --> 02:28:21,620
going completely independent and saying
there's certain companies that venues,

2772
02:28:21,621 --> 02:28:25,010
and in some areas they own every
fucking venue that's worth a damn.

2773
02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:28,670
And there's some bands that
have exclusivity with those
venues. So if they tour,

2774
02:28:28,671 --> 02:28:32,150
they have to play in one of those
venues and use their ticketing systems.

2775
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:36,770
It's all designed to maximize their
profit and make it fucking impossible for

2776
02:28:36,771 --> 02:28:40,970
you to make one as a small event in a big
venue. Um, and it needs to be disrupted.

2777
02:28:40,971 --> 02:28:44,300
And the notion of, I guess you could
kind of kickstart or something,

2778
02:28:44,301 --> 02:28:47,900
but there should be a site or service
where people can demand an event in their

2779
02:28:47,901 --> 02:28:50,510
area. And if enough people
demand that, then you can,

2780
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:53,690
you can take bids from local venues, you
know what I mean? To disrupt that model.

2781
02:28:53,691 --> 02:28:55,430
So you're not picking a venue first,

2782
02:28:55,431 --> 02:28:59,090
trying to guarantee a certain number of
ticket sales and then going on sale and

2783
02:28:59,091 --> 02:29:00,260
trying to drum up publicity.

2784
02:29:01,050 --> 02:29:03,220
Hmm. Um, I,

2785
02:29:03,390 --> 02:29:07,680
I could see your point in
that if you are doing this,

2786
02:29:07,681 --> 02:29:10,980
you can force bands to
pay to charge much more.

2787
02:29:11,430 --> 02:29:13,890
But is it because the people,

2788
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:17,940
they have contracts to keep steady work
coming in because otherwise, I mean,

2789
02:29:17,941 --> 02:29:20,670
how much steady work is going
to come into these theaters?

2790
02:29:20,671 --> 02:29:22,440
I don't know how that
business really works.

2791
02:29:22,890 --> 02:29:25,680
I think it's, I think it's, I think they
have, I shouldn't say half the time.

2792
02:29:25,681 --> 02:29:28,500
I really don't know that the numbers
there, but how those metrics shake out.

2793
02:29:28,501 --> 02:29:33,330
But I believe they are purchasing venues,
ticket agents, they own the venue.

2794
02:29:33,331 --> 02:29:33,710
It's there.

2795
02:29:33,710 --> 02:29:35,750
Don't they have agreements with like,

2796
02:29:35,810 --> 02:29:38,600
like talent agencies and
how do they work all that

2797
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:43,010
sometimes. Um, yeah. I don't
know what specifics I could
get into like, yeah, yeah.

2798
02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:43,853
It's,

2799
02:29:43,870 --> 02:29:46,270
what do you think specifically
should be disrupted?

2800
02:29:46,271 --> 02:29:49,720
You think that it's too difficult?
It's too easy to control the market.

2801
02:29:49,721 --> 02:29:50,300
Is that what it is?

2802
02:29:50,300 --> 02:29:52,990
Yeah. Well, I mean it's, you're, you're
locked out. If you want to play a,

2803
02:29:53,070 --> 02:29:55,370
if you want to play a certain
type of venue in certain cities,

2804
02:29:55,371 --> 02:29:59,060
you have no choice but to
go with a certain ticketing
agency that has their own

2805
02:29:59,061 --> 02:30:02,660
built in fees and system. And at one
ticket age he has a deal with the vent.

2806
02:30:02,661 --> 02:30:04,970
They have an agreement with the venues
or sometimes they own the venue.

2807
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:05,800
But don't you think

2808
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:09,930
because they can provide the ax to the
venue, isn't it the idea behind it? Um,

2809
02:30:10,030 --> 02:30:13,550
sometimes, but you know, as an
independent who isn't signed on with that,

2810
02:30:13,551 --> 02:30:16,880
you still have to play that game. You
know what I mean? You don't have a choice.

2811
02:30:16,881 --> 02:30:19,400
You literally don't have a choice in
certain areas with certain venues.

2812
02:30:19,580 --> 02:30:22,410
But what I think needs to be disrupted
is the notion of we're going,

2813
02:30:22,460 --> 02:30:23,600
like if you're going to go tour,

2814
02:30:23,601 --> 02:30:26,210
you pick your dates and your clubs
probably based off of metric,

2815
02:30:26,211 --> 02:30:29,510
ton of data or off of Twitter.
And then you say,

2816
02:30:29,511 --> 02:30:31,940
we're going to go to these things and you
go on sale and you have to promote and

2817
02:30:31,941 --> 02:30:33,800
hope you sell those tickets
and hope that goes through.

2818
02:30:34,130 --> 02:30:36,740
I think there needs to be a Kickstarter
style model where people can,

2819
02:30:36,890 --> 02:30:40,730
within like you can pick an area and so
within, you set a radius a hundred miles,

2820
02:30:40,731 --> 02:30:43,640
200 miles. I want to throw an
event here, describe your event.

2821
02:30:43,790 --> 02:30:46,430
And then as people like on Facebook
or whatever, or they donate,

2822
02:30:46,431 --> 02:30:51,080
I'm going to spend $20 on that event for
a little extra bonus and become an, uh,

2823
02:30:51,550 --> 02:30:53,510
an evangelist of your
brand or of your tour.

2824
02:30:53,570 --> 02:30:56,660
So I'm going to sign up more people and I,
I'm incentivized to sign up people.

2825
02:30:56,780 --> 02:30:57,613
I think you can,

2826
02:30:57,710 --> 02:31:01,580
you can see what the demand is in an
area first and incentivize early adopters

2827
02:31:01,581 --> 02:31:05,510
to raise publicity about your event by
giving them kickbacks or stickers or

2828
02:31:05,511 --> 02:31:07,790
extra merged or whatever
for being an evangelist.

2829
02:31:07,850 --> 02:31:09,320
And that way when you launched the tour,

2830
02:31:09,380 --> 02:31:12,560
you already know you've presold x amount
in those areas because people have

2831
02:31:12,561 --> 02:31:15,830
committed. So it's not like Kickstarter
for touring. That's an interesting idea.

2832
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:19,010
Yeah, that's a great idea. I'm just
what I want to do. That's what you want.

2833
02:31:19,050 --> 02:31:23,730
Do sure. I want to do again and again
and again and again. You said it live,

2834
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:28,000
that's doing it. I started
to do it actually like, uh,

2835
02:31:28,050 --> 02:31:29,340
I started to do it and,

2836
02:31:29,370 --> 02:31:31,560
and just realized I have too
many plates spinning right now,

2837
02:31:31,561 --> 02:31:34,560
so someone wants to do that. Awesome. I
hope you do. I'd love to use that service.

2838
02:31:34,561 --> 02:31:38,310
And if you want me on the advisory board,
fuck yeah. But I just don't have the,

2839
02:31:38,311 --> 02:31:40,210
you know, I'm, I've got
a lot of plates spinning.

2840
02:31:40,250 --> 02:31:45,250
So the way it is is the big venues
and nice places are all locked up.

2841
02:31:45,690 --> 02:31:50,520
Pretty much. Yeah. Pretty much.
Hmm. And uh, yeah, I mean,

2842
02:31:50,521 --> 02:31:52,650
you have to go with the, there's,
there's Ticketmaster venues,

2843
02:31:52,651 --> 02:31:53,850
so if you want to play a certain venue,

2844
02:31:53,910 --> 02:31:56,990
you're paying ticket master
that's happening. Didn't, oh,

2845
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:00,440
who's the band that tried to Seattle?
What? The Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam.

2846
02:32:01,630 --> 02:32:04,590
And they, I mean, they did
for their fans, but you know,

2847
02:32:04,950 --> 02:32:08,550
that's like Radiohead saying anybody
can release an album for free online.

2848
02:32:08,550 --> 02:32:11,690
It's like, well, you can, if
you've reached a certain size
right. You know, if your,

2849
02:32:11,691 --> 02:32:14,010
if your Pearl Jam,
you can fight back against Ticketmaster.

2850
02:32:14,100 --> 02:32:17,010
If you're trying to throw a night of
comedy together or throw together a nerd

2851
02:32:17,011 --> 02:32:21,330
carnival and you, you know,
you, you have to play by their
rules. Right, right, right.

2852
02:32:21,480 --> 02:32:25,350
Yeah, it's wild. That's
interesting. And it's, well,

2853
02:32:25,351 --> 02:32:29,670
it's hard to run a fucking venue out.
Imagine man, let a thankless Gig.

2854
02:32:30,170 --> 02:32:34,020
I have a bunch of assholes come and put
on fucking shows at your place. Really?

2855
02:32:34,021 --> 02:32:36,930
Cops behind. Well, I mean, that's
part of you. I mean that's, you're,

2856
02:32:36,931 --> 02:32:39,660
you're paying for someone to
clean up their venue. You're
always paying for that.

2857
02:32:39,661 --> 02:32:40,950
It's not like, you know, that's,

2858
02:32:40,951 --> 02:32:43,110
that's built in and that's why
the venue should get their charge.

2859
02:32:43,111 --> 02:32:44,070
If they're throwing the event there,

2860
02:32:44,071 --> 02:32:47,430
then sure you're paying for them to
staff people to clean it up and make sure

2861
02:32:47,431 --> 02:32:50,880
microphones work and lights work. I
mean, that's what you're paying for, but,

2862
02:32:50,910 --> 02:32:53,410
but $17 for a convenience fee.
What?

2863
02:32:53,590 --> 02:32:56,610
There's nothing convenience convenient
about that. What is the convenience for,

2864
02:32:56,611 --> 02:32:59,820
you know, it all depends. It's a sliding
scale on a certain price ticket. It's a,

2865
02:32:59,821 --> 02:33:01,950
there's a builtin fee plus a percentage.

2866
02:33:02,070 --> 02:33:04,980
So you have to price your tickets at
a certain way so that you don't end up

2867
02:33:04,981 --> 02:33:07,590
fucking everybody else over and you
end up losing money on that front.

2868
02:33:08,970 --> 02:33:11,730
That sounds like a viewer more successful
though. And you sold more tickets,

2869
02:33:11,731 --> 02:33:15,000
you wouldn't have that problem. Yeah. Make
money. Yeah. You, you can't, you look,

2870
02:33:15,001 --> 02:33:17,260
you can certainly make money off
ticket sales. That's absolutely sure.

2871
02:33:17,261 --> 02:33:19,920
Even how to even handle our ambassador
and how all these companies like lock

2872
02:33:19,921 --> 02:33:22,620
everything down like this.
Uh, well at one point in time,

2873
02:33:22,621 --> 02:33:25,860
I think they were a very convenient and
they were sort of the only game and then

2874
02:33:25,861 --> 02:33:28,980
they, then they started going to events
and doing, you know, deals with them.

2875
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:31,230
You're going to sell your tickets
through ticket master and nobody else.

2876
02:33:31,231 --> 02:33:33,870
And look, we're online and breezy and
we're great and customers love it.

2877
02:33:33,871 --> 02:33:36,960
And then once that wasn't trenched and
they bought their deals and do deals with

2878
02:33:36,961 --> 02:33:41,850
people who own the venues, then they
lock you out and keep power. I mean it's,

2879
02:33:41,851 --> 02:33:44,220
I think it's a snobby, there's certainly
companies that are trying to disrupt it,

2880
02:33:44,221 --> 02:33:45,210
like Brown paper tickets.

2881
02:33:45,211 --> 02:33:49,140
They're trying to do independent ticketing
for events I used for the last one.

2882
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:51,810
Yeah, there's, there's,

2883
02:33:51,811 --> 02:33:54,360
there's a lot of companies that are
trying to disrupt that space but to throw

2884
02:33:54,361 --> 02:33:57,300
events at certain venues, the granted
they're nice venues, the great venues.

2885
02:33:57,440 --> 02:33:59,760
That's why we chose club Nokia.
I mean it was phenomenal.

2886
02:33:59,761 --> 02:34:02,610
Great venue and I loved everybody that
worked there. It was a great experience,

2887
02:34:02,611 --> 02:34:06,480
but it's just unfortunate that you'd want
to charge $7 for something and because

2888
02:34:06,481 --> 02:34:10,680
of the system that's entrenched around it,
you end up charging 25 that's sad.

2889
02:34:10,830 --> 02:34:14,790
That hurts, you know? That's,
that's triple what we want
to charge, you know? Right.

2890
02:34:15,180 --> 02:34:17,010
It's still only 25 bucks.
You stop complaining,

2891
02:34:21,820 --> 02:34:26,560
so lead up is going to be like people are
going to perform. You're going to have,

2892
02:34:26,590 --> 02:34:29,740
I want it to be, I want it to be in a
carnival, a true carnival atmosphere.

2893
02:34:29,741 --> 02:34:32,410
I want you to be able to play
skeeball wear of bow tie. When weird.

2894
02:34:32,411 --> 02:34:33,700
Are you going to let be a weird host?

2895
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:34,480
I'm going to put on that thing,

2896
02:34:34,480 --> 02:34:38,610
that green suit with the question marks
on it like either like the government or

2897
02:34:38,611 --> 02:34:42,660
the guy that's selling your
things on this. That's the
question mark to face guy.

2898
02:34:42,661 --> 02:34:45,300
Well, hello nerds. Let me pander to you

2899
02:34:45,340 --> 02:34:46,240
for an hour.
Yeah,

2900
02:34:46,241 --> 02:34:48,460
you're going to have to do something
to stand out as the promoter,

2901
02:34:48,550 --> 02:34:49,900
perhaps something with feathers.

2902
02:34:50,200 --> 02:34:54,520
Would you be willing or interested in
wearing a boa? Absolutely. I would.

2903
02:34:54,610 --> 02:34:56,570
I would rock a,
I would rock a bow on stage.

2904
02:34:56,670 --> 02:35:00,160
Like how many guys who are the host have
to like where do something flamboyant,

2905
02:35:00,161 --> 02:35:03,490
like have a cigarette in a cigarette
holder or that Sam, he's the host,

2906
02:35:03,810 --> 02:35:07,390
see him with a cigarette and the
cigarette holder, he's our host.

2907
02:35:07,450 --> 02:35:10,990
I love how we're opening this year's tour.
I'm Mike rounds coming along,

2908
02:35:10,991 --> 02:35:13,510
so I'm gonna play drums with them
for a little bit of it's set in. Oh,

2909
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:16,000
he's an Mac.
Mike Brown is a phenomenal VJ.

2910
02:35:16,001 --> 02:35:19,090
He's one of the guys that spend those
visuals. He's close to the Olympics.

2911
02:35:19,091 --> 02:35:22,480
He's toured it, the blue man
group. Like, oh, he's pro VJ.

2912
02:35:22,481 --> 02:35:26,900
Like he's the Tso objs. Is that what I
think? So I put them on that on that part.

2913
02:35:26,901 --> 02:35:29,140
Yeah, absolutely. He does remixes for, Oh,

2914
02:35:29,141 --> 02:35:34,000
you're getting hypnotized by
our first lead up promo. Um, he,

2915
02:35:34,001 --> 02:35:37,750
uh, he's one of those guys that will cut
all the trailers for official movies and

2916
02:35:37,751 --> 02:35:39,220
films and stuff like that.
All the remix trailers.

2917
02:35:39,221 --> 02:35:43,300
But we're opening it up at that old,
uh, Hbo, eighties thing. You know,

2918
02:35:43,301 --> 02:35:45,630
like Hbo would play before every
movie where you fly over the city

2919
02:35:45,910 --> 02:35:46,850
flying to the letters.

2920
02:35:47,050 --> 02:35:49,840
Diana,

2921
02:35:50,130 --> 02:35:54,470
we're doing that and remember that.
It's one of my favorite.

2922
02:35:54,620 --> 02:35:58,560
Oh good. And, and the documentary on them
making that is brilliant. They were like,

2923
02:35:58,561 --> 02:36:02,220
they invested so much money and building
a little stop motion animated town that

2924
02:36:02,221 --> 02:36:06,120
the camera could fly over and they
comped in the average family watching TV.

2925
02:36:06,121 --> 02:36:06,841
Like what?
Gathering around,

2926
02:36:06,841 --> 02:36:09,930
watch HBO and the camera flies over
the city and goes into the stars.

2927
02:36:10,050 --> 02:36:11,910
It was a beautiful piece of advertising.

2928
02:36:11,911 --> 02:36:14,700
You need to explain to me how you don't
like game of Thrones because I just

2929
02:36:14,701 --> 02:36:16,010
don't understand you.
Well that's,

2930
02:36:16,060 --> 02:36:18,630
I got to give it three episodes
because I've watched the first one.

2931
02:36:18,631 --> 02:36:21,560
It was a lot of talking and you know,
a lot of people said the same thing.

2932
02:36:21,580 --> 02:36:24,480
I did took like five episodes
for some people. I know, I know.

2933
02:36:24,481 --> 02:36:26,550
I was in the minority of people.
Lot of people got upset about that.

2934
02:36:26,551 --> 02:36:29,340
But those people get upset
about windows users tears

2935
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:34,370
this to, this defines,
yeah, this is my charter

2936
02:36:39,900 --> 02:36:41,150
HBO time.

2937
02:36:45,560 --> 02:36:46,670
It sound design in the cars

2938
02:36:52,700 --> 02:36:56,570
fake. Hell yeah, they did.

2939
02:36:57,830 --> 02:37:01,970
Beetlejuice is going to pop out of one
of those buildings. Any seconds build up.

2940
02:37:01,971 --> 02:37:02,804
Here we go.

2941
02:37:10,940 --> 02:37:13,100
Some dude at synth in
the studio is rocking.

2942
02:37:17,320 --> 02:37:18,153
Whoa.

2943
02:37:28,710 --> 02:37:32,740
Feel spacious.
But Center at board it.

2944
02:37:32,741 --> 02:37:34,720
And let's go into this hero. Yes. Oh

2945
02:37:38,090 --> 02:37:38,923
Wow.

2946
02:37:47,100 --> 02:37:48,600
Factory period.
Right there.

2947
02:37:48,601 --> 02:37:52,560
I got to tell you that I have forgotten
about that on 100% completely.

2948
02:37:52,561 --> 02:37:54,510
That was what you were bringing it back.

2949
02:37:54,511 --> 02:37:56,280
Sort of barely remembered and that great.

2950
02:37:56,310 --> 02:37:59,310
But that was something that had been
a wreath from my mind. Fuck yeah,

2951
02:37:59,311 --> 02:38:02,330
we're bringing that bag. If we're doing
a, we're doing a hardcore electronic,

2952
02:38:02,331 --> 02:38:06,960
a double bass, just oh man. Yeah. That's
all we're going to open this remix.

2953
02:38:07,170 --> 02:38:09,990
Yeah. Wow. So you're going
to, you're going to have this,

2954
02:38:09,991 --> 02:38:11,190
you're going to have the VJ,

2955
02:38:11,220 --> 02:38:14,820
you're going to have a what podcasts
are going to perform. Uh, well,

2956
02:38:14,830 --> 02:38:16,260
right now I'm just sort
of leading the night,

2957
02:38:16,261 --> 02:38:18,690
like a epic mealtime's coming
with us for most of the tour.

2958
02:38:18,691 --> 02:38:20,430
Hardly in the guys at mealtime.

2959
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:25,530
Brilliant Youtube series where guys like
make like 900,000 Calorie burgers and

2960
02:38:25,531 --> 02:38:25,861
pizza.

2961
02:38:25,861 --> 02:38:28,890
So they'll go to every fast
food restaurant and get
one of everything on the

2962
02:38:28,891 --> 02:38:29,221
menu,

2963
02:38:29,221 --> 02:38:32,670
roll it up into a deep fried dough thing
and then eat it and put Jack Daniels

2964
02:38:32,671 --> 02:38:36,660
all over it. Oh my. It's brilliant. It's a
great, it's, there's epic music behind it.

2965
02:38:36,661 --> 02:38:39,900
The cuts are great. They're buying 40
pounds of Bacon at the supermarket,

2966
02:38:39,901 --> 02:38:43,530
filling up the shopping cart and just
make these high caloric things and just

2967
02:38:43,531 --> 02:38:45,750
eat them.
So hardly came out at the first one.

2968
02:38:45,751 --> 02:38:49,130
And we interviewed him and then we
brought, we built like a youtube. Yeah,

2969
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:52,380
it's a great series on youtube.
Better that or man versus food.

2970
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:57,330
I don't do man versus food. I
do a, I do help to the kitchen
for you. No, no, no, no.

2971
02:38:57,331 --> 02:38:58,740
I do hell's kitchen.
Hell's kitchen.

2972
02:38:58,741 --> 02:39:01,470
Hell's kitchen is about as mainstream as
it gets and it's fucking love that show.

2973
02:39:01,471 --> 02:39:04,440
It's one of my favorites. I Love Gordon
Ramsey getting pissed off about somebody.

2974
02:39:04,441 --> 02:39:07,140
Risotto is the greatest moment in my life.

2975
02:39:07,170 --> 02:39:09,900
I look forward to them
making fucking horrible.

2976
02:39:09,901 --> 02:39:12,680
Must it be for those dudes to go to
or you're working at a restaurants?

2977
02:39:12,690 --> 02:39:15,690
I'm shit restaurant. He'd been working
at the same shit restaurant forever.

2978
02:39:15,691 --> 02:39:18,850
It's always been shit. He just fucking
put out your Shitty Meatloaf, you know?

2979
02:39:18,851 --> 02:39:21,940
Let me think about it. And also
gorgeous kitchen. Nice. Right? Yeah.

2980
02:39:22,110 --> 02:39:24,510
That's kitchen neck.
God love that.

2981
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:28,410
I love how every single restaurant owner
on kitchen nightmares truly believes

2982
02:39:28,411 --> 02:39:30,360
they're not going to get
raped by Gordon Ramsey. Yeah.

2983
02:39:30,510 --> 02:39:31,980
And then they're just
crying in the kitchen.

2984
02:39:31,981 --> 02:39:34,710
Got It's powering into them over the oven.
We've got a good salad.

2985
02:39:34,830 --> 02:39:37,630
We've got a good dressing on a salad.
These are good crew times. Yeah.

2986
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:40,290
Where do you store the salad
or the trunk of my car.

2987
02:39:40,330 --> 02:39:43,320
We thought we put ice in there once a
week when we get new lettuce and they pull

2988
02:39:43,321 --> 02:39:46,900
up like it's fine. Moldy things out
of the frigerator. It's just for,

2989
02:39:46,901 --> 02:39:51,870
it looks like cat mixed with how much
of the staged it, none of it stage. No,

2990
02:39:51,871 --> 02:39:54,360
no kitchen nightmares.
Definitely not staged.

2991
02:39:54,390 --> 02:39:57,030
I actually pawn stars and stuff his stage,
but I mean,

2992
02:39:57,031 --> 02:40:00,060
how many shitty disgusting restaurants
are there in La alone that have C's in

2993
02:40:00,061 --> 02:40:03,480
the window where you know there's just
sour cream under a pile of dead cats in

2994
02:40:03,481 --> 02:40:07,240
the kitchen. Like that shit exists
right now. That's where we stored.

2995
02:40:07,250 --> 02:40:09,990
That's where grandpa used to. Yeah.
What do you have to do to get a d?

2996
02:40:09,991 --> 02:40:14,190
Have you ever seen a dean at a dairy
queen with a c ones? It was my first

2997
02:40:14,190 --> 02:40:16,260
week ever smoking pot and I,

2998
02:40:16,320 --> 02:40:20,220
we made a trip five mile walk to a dairy
queen with a c because I decided in an

2999
02:40:20,221 --> 02:40:24,060
Oreo blizzard was our fucking holy
grail and I shat myself senseless.

3000
02:40:24,090 --> 02:40:25,850
Did you literally?
Oh yeah.

3001
02:40:25,960 --> 02:40:29,930
Immediately when we walked back and we
were sober and I was like, that was a,

3002
02:40:30,020 --> 02:40:32,430
well that was a trek and then
immediately everybody who wait,

3003
02:40:32,431 --> 02:40:35,710
they're like three other guys were
like, ah, later bro. Everyone got sick.

3004
02:40:36,030 --> 02:40:39,670
Everybody just, just
screaming assholes. Wow. US.

3005
02:40:39,740 --> 02:40:41,580
You have to really go out
of your way to get a c.

3006
02:40:41,610 --> 02:40:45,000
It's usually really in restaurants I've
noticed and that's not to be racist or

3007
02:40:45,001 --> 02:40:45,361
anything,

3008
02:40:45,361 --> 02:40:49,140
it's just that that's what
I've been because I'm like
addicted to looking at the

3009
02:40:49,141 --> 02:40:51,930
letters and every,
almost every time I look it's always,

3010
02:40:51,950 --> 02:40:53,790
and in restaurant that's like a B or a c.

3011
02:40:53,820 --> 02:40:57,840
People beat the drum for deregulation on
everything and yet I wouldn't eat at a

3012
02:40:57,841 --> 02:40:59,280
restaurant if half the restaurants,

3013
02:40:59,281 --> 02:41:02,010
if I didn't believe that there was a
solid blue letter in the window that was

3014
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:04,620
somehow certified and then
someone was looking out for that.

3015
02:41:04,621 --> 02:41:05,454
The fact that we don't want to,

3016
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:09,090
we don't want to monitor what goes into
our food and how it's made and why it's

3017
02:41:09,091 --> 02:41:12,480
made like people that are against
labeling foods, those are assholes.

3018
02:41:12,481 --> 02:41:15,270
Genetically Modified foods like they're
like, you can't put that on the list.

3019
02:41:15,390 --> 02:41:17,340
What the fuck?
Can't you put it on the label?

3020
02:41:17,341 --> 02:41:21,330
They're fighting it now they're
finding it tooth and nail GMO foods,

3021
02:41:21,530 --> 02:41:23,160
you GMO.
Scary stuff,

3022
02:41:23,230 --> 02:41:26,850
man. This is all, I mean some of
it can certainly help people. Sure,

3023
02:41:27,220 --> 02:41:29,170
but some of it is real experimental.

3024
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:31,020
They don't know what the fuck's
going to happen. 50 years.

3025
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:34,860
The Shit. They're like, look, we tried
it on a couple rats. Rats did. All right,

3026
02:41:34,970 --> 02:41:36,000
how would we think it's safe now?

3027
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:38,660
Crosspollination of other people's
plants, you know, they're,

3028
02:41:38,661 --> 02:41:42,200
they're genetically modified plants are
getting into other people's crops and

3029
02:41:42,201 --> 02:41:43,660
some that means people
are getting sued for,

3030
02:41:43,790 --> 02:41:45,660
Oh yeah,
you're Monsanto corn or yours.

3031
02:41:45,661 --> 02:41:50,190
Your seed flew across the other highway
and now I have your trademark corn

3032
02:41:50,191 --> 02:41:51,660
growing in my field.
It's what

3033
02:41:51,830 --> 02:41:52,870
Monsanto created,

3034
02:41:52,871 --> 02:41:57,871
Agent Orange create a DDT like they
created some seriously scary shit before

3035
02:41:58,631 --> 02:42:00,850
they started fucking around
with genetically modified.

3036
02:42:01,050 --> 02:42:04,080
Well, that's the really skin.
That's the really scary shit. Yeah.

3037
02:42:04,360 --> 02:42:05,250
That's what's crazy.

3038
02:42:05,710 --> 02:42:06,590
Well,
not only that,

3039
02:42:06,591 --> 02:42:09,260
there was speculation for a long time
that they bought blackwater. You know,

3040
02:42:09,261 --> 02:42:09,950
blackwater,

3041
02:42:09,950 --> 02:42:14,330
you mean XII? Yeah. Xxi I love how
quick she to change to change it again.

3042
02:42:14,490 --> 02:42:17,520
Yeah. Agency or something like
that. Something along those lines.

3043
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:20,070
But they were sold by someone in,

3044
02:42:20,071 --> 02:42:22,230
the speculation was that they
were sold by black water.

3045
02:42:22,231 --> 02:42:25,440
They're sold through some private
corporation and that was the,

3046
02:42:25,441 --> 02:42:29,640
could you imagine if
Monsanto bought black water?

3047
02:42:29,670 --> 02:42:32,790
Like what if they bought their own
mercenary group because you know they're,

3048
02:42:32,791 --> 02:42:35,970
they have, they face like some serious
resistance and other countries,

3049
02:42:36,210 --> 02:42:37,290
especially in India,

3050
02:42:37,291 --> 02:42:41,730
where in India that something like every
30 seconds a farmer commit suicide in

3051
02:42:41,731 --> 02:42:43,470
India because he owes money to Monsanto,

3052
02:42:44,040 --> 02:42:47,340
hundreds of thousands of farmers have
committed suicide because they are

3053
02:42:47,341 --> 02:42:50,670
involved in depth. They can't
pay off and they just get fucked.

3054
02:42:50,910 --> 02:42:53,160
I don't know why they have to
make these deals with Monsanto.

3055
02:42:53,161 --> 02:42:56,040
I don't know the intricacies of the
corruption and how it's pulled off,

3056
02:42:56,400 --> 02:43:00,060
but they developed this relationship or
these people that that's where they're

3057
02:43:00,061 --> 02:43:03,000
getting their seats from and they have to
get their seeds from every year. Right?

3058
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:06,630
Well isn't it that they sell
them like a bacteria resistance,

3059
02:43:06,680 --> 02:43:09,870
a strain or a roundup ready styles
strain and they put that in,

3060
02:43:09,871 --> 02:43:12,010
but it ends up killing other
things or ends up generating its

3061
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:15,130
own problems and how they got to buy
the solution from Monsato as well.

3062
02:43:15,131 --> 02:43:17,980
Like isn't that how that process works?
At, they bury themselves in debt.

3063
02:43:18,040 --> 02:43:21,650
I don't know. Think it is. I don't know,
but there's a lot of issues to it. I mean,

3064
02:43:21,651 --> 02:43:22,690
if he can go and read it,

3065
02:43:22,691 --> 02:43:25,510
I get sad and I just stopped
printing it and go to other things.

3066
02:43:25,750 --> 02:43:29,260
When you hear that every 30 seconds of
farmers committing suicide because of it

3067
02:43:29,460 --> 02:43:33,220
in, well in Brazil, Brazil just
sued Monsanto and farmers won.

3068
02:43:33,221 --> 02:43:36,670
They won billions of dollars. Billions.
I mean, what does that mean? I mean,

3069
02:43:37,090 --> 02:43:40,440
does it mean that we have to go to
fucking Brazil to get good food? Right.

3070
02:43:41,450 --> 02:43:45,400
It means one less caviar ski do for
somebody at Monsato who was already got

3071
02:43:45,401 --> 02:43:47,770
billions of dollars. [inaudible]
might not be a bad place to live.

3072
02:43:47,771 --> 02:43:51,030
When the shit hits the fan, I
would be down. I love Brazil. Yeah.

3073
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:55,090
I'll just go get a fucking book
on Portuguese. Do you speak,

3074
02:43:55,180 --> 02:43:57,600
I don't use your dad's
Portuguese. He is. Yeah.

3075
02:43:57,670 --> 02:44:00,040
I told you he wears the bottle of your
car. He's definitely a Portuguese.

3076
02:44:00,340 --> 02:44:04,000
He's got thick black chest hair with
like giant Golden Eagles and crosses

3077
02:44:04,001 --> 02:44:07,030
dangling and do it. Really? Oh
yeah. And a great pedo stash.

3078
02:44:07,090 --> 02:44:10,270
The amber alert is strong with
him. Really love him. Yeah. He's,

3079
02:44:10,271 --> 02:44:13,510
he's full on Portuguese and shout
it with bread rolls at his mouth.

3080
02:44:13,540 --> 02:44:17,230
Does he know at family dinners? Has he
been to Brazil? Um, and he's from the uh,

3081
02:44:17,260 --> 02:44:19,690
A's or islands. Oh,
that's the worst. Yeah.

3082
02:44:19,691 --> 02:44:23,890
I saw a whole special Anthony Bourdain
went there. Great cuisine there. Yeah.

3083
02:44:24,060 --> 02:44:26,800
It's supposed to be amazing.
Yeah. Amazing. It's a,

3084
02:44:26,810 --> 02:44:29,950
it's a track that I need to take,
but I want to take a road trip to Brazil.

3085
02:44:29,980 --> 02:44:32,830
So many Portuguese moved to
Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

3086
02:44:32,890 --> 02:44:33,820
What the hell is that about?

3087
02:44:33,850 --> 02:44:37,900
And I was it proximity and just getting
his in the first place you fly into

3088
02:44:38,020 --> 02:44:42,850
massive amount live in fall
river, Massachusetts. Fall
River, Massachusetts is,

3089
02:44:42,851 --> 02:44:43,570
do they have like,

3090
02:44:43,570 --> 02:44:47,480
they have a lot of showing a lot of he
beaded sweaters because that's why they

3091
02:44:47,481 --> 02:44:51,160
would go down a bunch of different
spots in Rhode Island. Um, there's like,

3092
02:44:51,161 --> 02:44:55,270
there was like a whole towns where
people talk Portuguese in Rhode Island,

3093
02:44:55,300 --> 02:44:58,230
like a wound socket. I
think that was it. Well,

3094
02:44:58,250 --> 02:45:01,160
the socket was a part of Rhode
Island where you would go and uh,

3095
02:45:01,270 --> 02:45:05,320
it was like a portal, like a Portuguese
fishing village. Crazy. Yeah.

3096
02:45:05,620 --> 02:45:08,680
And I never got a,
are you like in touch with your heritage?

3097
02:45:08,681 --> 02:45:11,840
Are you really in touch with your heritage
and your roots and your ethnicities

3098
02:45:11,860 --> 02:45:15,040
and all that jazz? It's where we have
to wrap this one. Oh Shit. Three hours.

3099
02:45:15,041 --> 02:45:19,450
Somehow or another, it gets too
much time on the, the, the uh,

3100
02:45:19,480 --> 02:45:22,900
audio and Fox on the other can say on the
audience. I'm like, I can see that. Well,

3101
02:45:22,901 --> 02:45:26,470
that to Jesus Christ, we can rambled
forever. I would love, by the way,

3102
02:45:26,471 --> 02:45:30,040
it was sincerely, if you
will, let's figure it out. If
you want to come on and do,

3103
02:45:30,041 --> 02:45:31,810
if you want to try it on your,
uh,

3104
02:45:31,870 --> 02:45:34,270
your idea of doing like a Q and a
kind of thing. If you want to do that.

3105
02:45:34,271 --> 02:45:37,030
One of our shows or something like that
out. But it would, it would have to be,

3106
02:45:37,031 --> 02:45:38,720
you know, in a weekend
I have off. Certainly,

3107
02:45:39,020 --> 02:45:41,850
if that's the problem is most
weekends I'm doing something. Gotcha.

3108
02:45:42,130 --> 02:45:45,770
But I'm trying to do less this year. I've
done less this year. I stopped doing, um,

3109
02:45:45,850 --> 02:45:49,330
I don't do all the shows with the UFC
anymore. I used to do all the paper views.

3110
02:45:49,331 --> 02:45:54,331
Then I would do the spike shows and then
they sold to FX and Fox and then they

3111
02:45:55,481 --> 02:45:57,610
have these fuel shows.
And so I don't do any of those.

3112
02:45:57,611 --> 02:46:00,490
I want to do Fox and paper view.
So I miss all,

3113
02:46:00,491 --> 02:46:01,900
like there's a show tomorrow night.
There's a,

3114
02:46:01,980 --> 02:46:05,010
there's one that's going on tonight
in San Jose. Uh, so the, the,

3115
02:46:05,011 --> 02:46:08,020
the way in rather was today the fights
or tomorrow night. So I'm missing that.

3116
02:46:08,021 --> 02:46:10,070
Wanting to go to it or no,
you're just, no, no, no, no.

3117
02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:14,290
I'm trying to travel less.
Yeah. I'm trying to do,

3118
02:46:14,440 --> 02:46:17,230
are you doing that so you can, what are
you focusing that time on? Are you okay?

3119
02:46:17,310 --> 02:46:21,660
Cause somebody on his podcast and comedy,
it's more fun to me. It's like the,

3120
02:46:21,700 --> 02:46:22,740
the podcast,

3121
02:46:23,850 --> 02:46:26,370
one of the things that's happened from
the podcast is somehow or another,

3122
02:46:26,371 --> 02:46:30,330
we've developed this gigantic group of
people that are really into the podcast.

3123
02:46:30,600 --> 02:46:33,930
And the rabbit. I'm one of them. And
they, oh, thanks man. Absolutely.

3124
02:46:33,931 --> 02:46:37,680
I listened to it every, all the fucking
time. Oh, thanks. Yeah. So we owe them,

3125
02:46:37,830 --> 02:46:39,240
you know, were, were linked. We,

3126
02:46:39,270 --> 02:46:42,330
you mean they've been nice to us and
we're the only ones who can make this

3127
02:46:42,331 --> 02:46:42,871
podcast,

3128
02:46:42,871 --> 02:46:47,871
so we owe them to keep doing this
and it doesn't even feel like,

3129
02:46:48,160 --> 02:46:51,180
like an obligation to me. It
feels like a, like an obsession.

3130
02:46:51,181 --> 02:46:52,590
Like I fucking love it. You know, like,

3131
02:46:52,591 --> 02:46:55,740
it's like yesterday we had
Tommy Chong today we got you.

3132
02:46:55,741 --> 02:46:58,860
Tomorrow we've got this Adam called
cash guy from Adam versus the man.

3133
02:46:58,861 --> 02:47:03,600
I hope I'm saying his last name.
Right. Um, but it's um, it's fun. It's,

3134
02:47:03,601 --> 02:47:06,090
it's interesting.
I'm learning a lot about,

3135
02:47:06,320 --> 02:47:09,570
I'm not even a lot about fucking
human beings. I'm learning a lot,

3136
02:47:09,810 --> 02:47:11,940
listening to different people.
So stories and yeah.

3137
02:47:11,940 --> 02:47:13,590
Experiences if I may.

3138
02:47:13,591 --> 02:47:16,140
Like what are you think the overall
takeaway has been because you've chatted

3139
02:47:16,141 --> 02:47:19,020
with some diverse groups of
people and had, you know,

3140
02:47:19,530 --> 02:47:21,590
had some interesting like
topics of conversation that,

3141
02:47:21,591 --> 02:47:23,790
that repeat themselves from
person to person. Is it,

3142
02:47:23,970 --> 02:47:27,000
is there a common thread
that has surprised you at
all or is it pretty much what

3143
02:47:27,001 --> 02:47:29,790
you figured when you were getting into
it in terms of the way humans think,

3144
02:47:29,820 --> 02:47:30,900
operate,
communicate.

3145
02:47:31,240 --> 02:47:31,671
It's,

3146
02:47:31,671 --> 02:47:36,640
it surprised me how much positivity
can be generated inside of one group.

3147
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:39,010
That's what surprised me because
that wasn't an intention.

3148
02:47:39,250 --> 02:47:42,000
It wasn't intention to
start this thing and uh,

3149
02:47:42,100 --> 02:47:45,700
have all these people telling me that
it changes our life and they become this

3150
02:47:45,701 --> 02:47:49,150
really positive person and they're just
started to cut out all the negative

3151
02:47:49,151 --> 02:47:52,360
bullshit and their life and try to get
a job they really want and try to be

3152
02:47:52,361 --> 02:47:55,000
healthy. I never expected
any of that. Awesome.

3153
02:47:55,001 --> 02:47:59,080
That has been the most shocking
storyline through the whole thing.

3154
02:47:59,250 --> 02:48:03,100
This is just how I live my life and I've
lived my life that way to try to manage

3155
02:48:03,101 --> 02:48:07,000
my own reality and to try to,
to try to live a happy existence.

3156
02:48:07,001 --> 02:48:10,540
And what I've learned over the years is
that the, um, the nicer you are to people,

3157
02:48:10,541 --> 02:48:13,000
the happier you are,
the more nice people you're around,

3158
02:48:13,001 --> 02:48:15,880
the happier your life would be.
And if you all just come in,

3159
02:48:15,881 --> 02:48:16,990
I've been a content my life.

3160
02:48:16,991 --> 02:48:20,620
I think we all have had shitty moments
where we just didn't have good control

3161
02:48:20,621 --> 02:48:25,240
over our emotions or our state of mind
or our tension level or whatever the fuck

3162
02:48:25,241 --> 02:48:28,720
it was. It made you lash out
when you shouldn't have or
insulted someone when you

3163
02:48:28,721 --> 02:48:31,720
could've avoided it or whatever the fuck
it is that made you a contact person at

3164
02:48:31,721 --> 02:48:32,770
the moment.
We've what?

3165
02:48:32,771 --> 02:48:37,771
We've all done that so we can all know
that it's possible to aspire to a higher

3166
02:48:38,591 --> 02:48:40,810
state of consciousness to
a higher state of behavior,

3167
02:48:40,820 --> 02:48:45,760
a higher level of behavior and that it
makes you a better person and it enriches

3168
02:48:45,761 --> 02:48:48,040
your environment.
Like we all know the one person,

3169
02:48:48,240 --> 02:48:51,920
like everybody has a friend that's like
a joy to be around and he's like, look,

3170
02:48:51,940 --> 02:48:53,950
Joey d is like a life
of a party type dude.

3171
02:48:54,100 --> 02:48:57,310
Like you want to be around him because
he makes you feel good because it's good

3172
02:48:57,311 --> 02:49:01,540
feelings and you know,
we all should have something like that.

3173
02:49:01,541 --> 02:49:03,430
We all should have,
you know,

3174
02:49:03,431 --> 02:49:08,430
aspects of ourselves that we put out there
that people like and they do the same

3175
02:49:08,431 --> 02:49:09,930
and then we all benefit from each other.

3176
02:49:09,931 --> 02:49:14,931
We all get inspired by each other and we
all grow together and I think too many

3177
02:49:15,241 --> 02:49:18,440
people are out there in this world
thinking, you know, I'm going to pull,

3178
02:49:18,450 --> 02:49:21,570
could be the bird is more the full girl
and I'm going to fall. Could be the man.

3179
02:49:21,930 --> 02:49:24,090
No one's over solds me took a does me.

3180
02:49:24,091 --> 02:49:27,990
No one's ever sold as many records as me
and no one's ever had as many downloads

3181
02:49:27,991 --> 02:49:28,824
as me.

3182
02:49:29,230 --> 02:49:32,500
Your shit sucks because Ai,
they can't make it myself or be,

3183
02:49:32,501 --> 02:49:35,800
I'm trying to make it an insecure that
it's better than my shit. Your Shit,

3184
02:49:36,180 --> 02:49:37,160
your tastes

3185
02:49:37,810 --> 02:49:42,580
music. That is amazing. I don't like, you
know, I know classical music is amazing,

3186
02:49:42,581 --> 02:49:45,090
but I don't listen to
it. You know, it's very,

3187
02:49:45,140 --> 02:49:46,630
the only time I ever listened
to classical music is,

3188
02:49:46,631 --> 02:49:48,400
I'll put it in the background.
Occasionally when I write,

3189
02:49:48,640 --> 02:49:51,100
I'll have like a little classical music
in the background if I feel like I'm

3190
02:49:51,101 --> 02:49:55,210
into it. But for the most part I like,
I like rock. I like old school rock.

3191
02:49:55,211 --> 02:50:00,010
I like like Zeplin, like the door
about dubstep. I'm not really into it.

3192
02:50:00,100 --> 02:50:00,730
Oh Man.

3193
02:50:00,730 --> 02:50:04,520
Have you heard square Lexis doors
song? Sounds cool. Sounds cool to me.

3194
02:50:04,550 --> 02:50:05,650
It's like it's new metal to me.

3195
02:50:05,651 --> 02:50:08,970
It has the aggression feeling that old
metal used to give me. To me it's newer.

3196
02:50:09,100 --> 02:50:12,670
I give it sounds like 40 Roombas
raping robocop on in. Yeah,

3197
02:50:12,910 --> 02:50:15,970
that I don't like it. It's
just that I prefer song. Sure.

3198
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:20,110
I prefer like the battle of Curtis
Lowe to that. You know what I mean?

3199
02:50:20,111 --> 02:50:23,200
And if I have to listen, I got to
listen to something. Sure. You know,

3200
02:50:23,270 --> 02:50:27,130
I can't listen to everything. I don't
have the time. You know what I'm saying?

3201
02:50:27,160 --> 02:50:28,090
I feel Kevin prayer.

3202
02:50:28,330 --> 02:50:30,960
I love the fact that you have the balls
to fucking jump off that show. Dude.

3203
02:50:30,961 --> 02:50:34,080
It's a very successful show.
You the starter of it, the
creator of it. Thank you.

3204
02:50:34,090 --> 02:50:36,850
You had the balls just bail right in
the middle of it was a tough decision.

3205
02:50:36,940 --> 02:50:39,730
I'm sure it was, but it's the right
one. You're a bad mother fucker dude.

3206
02:50:39,731 --> 02:50:42,640
You can do anything you want now. Thanks
man. You're going to wind up probably,

3207
02:50:42,641 --> 02:50:44,590
you're probably better off on
the Internet anyway. You know.

3208
02:50:44,620 --> 02:50:49,510
If you ever need any help ever
promoting anything at the drop of a hat,

3209
02:50:49,511 --> 02:50:51,670
you just let us know. We'll come
here in the middle of the night, man.

3210
02:50:51,671 --> 02:50:54,160
We'll do whatever the fuck we need to
appreciate it. Anytime. Thank you man.

3211
02:50:54,161 --> 02:50:56,530
Always a pleasure. We'll figure out a
lead up thing. We'll figure something out.

3212
02:50:56,790 --> 02:50:57,700

American American comedy company.

So if you want to get tickets, go to

Shaffir, Brian Red Band.

3237
02:52:18,010 --> 02:52:20,610
I go to Naca,
Ryan Mervis,

3238
02:52:20,980 --> 02:52:25,360
Ryan Mervis and Meech and a,
yeah, and it's only 15 bucks.

3239
02:52:25,390 --> 02:52:26,350
And we,
uh,

3240
02:52:26,351 --> 02:52:29,560
we hang around afterwards and we'd take
pictures and we do a podcast that goes

3241
02:52:29,561 --> 02:52:32,020
on while the show was going on.

3242
02:52:32,021 --> 02:52:36,250
We will be in the green room preparing
and fucking around and we have a podcast

3243
02:52:36,251 --> 02:52:37,840
with all the comics together.
And in my opinion,

3244
02:52:37,841 --> 02:52:41,650
it's one of the best podcasts we do.
It's called the ice house chronicles,

3245
02:52:41,830 --> 02:52:45,110
and it's only available on death squad.
A test squad is a,

3246
02:52:45,240 --> 02:52:50,230
our label on iTunes for all
of Brian's podcast. Brian has,

3247
02:52:50,320 --> 02:52:52,150
what are the, how many different
podcasts you have there now?

3248
02:52:52,370 --> 02:52:57,220
I'm doing about nine right now.
She's not son locked up. Fuck.

3249
02:52:57,221 --> 02:53:00,520
Are you trying to do,
take all these people's time,

3250
02:53:00,610 --> 02:53:04,150
kill myself anyway,
a lot of them are very funny,

3251
02:53:04,151 --> 02:53:07,750
but the icehouse chronicles is my
favorite. It's just a great hang.

3252
02:53:07,751 --> 02:53:09,940
It's a real green room
experience is what it is.

3253
02:53:09,941 --> 02:53:13,990
It's us and all of our favorite friends
who are fucking hilariously funny.

3254
02:53:13,991 --> 02:53:15,010
And every time people in town,

3255
02:53:15,160 --> 02:53:17,830
like I just got a request for Tom
Rhodes who wanted to come to this one.

3256
02:53:17,980 --> 02:53:21,040
He was hoping we had one on Friday. He
didn't know. But he's, cause he's in La,

3257
02:53:21,210 --> 02:53:23,280
like people are hearing about it and
they want to be a part of it and they're,

3258
02:53:23,281 --> 02:53:27,430
they're really fun and they're only
available on iTunes under the desk quad

3259
02:53:27,431 --> 02:53:30,580
label. So go there, go
to death squad T. Dot.

3260
02:53:30,581 --> 02:53:35,581
TV Buy herself a Hitler cat or
Charlie Chaplin Trick trademarked.

3261
02:53:37,090 --> 02:53:39,520
Oh, this is the higher presence is
one of my higher prime made shirts.

3262
02:53:39,550 --> 02:53:40,780
This is one of my sillier ones,

3263
02:53:40,781 --> 02:53:44,350
but I have a tee shirt company that I
never talk about it. It's higher primate.

3264
02:53:44,351 --> 02:53:49,351
If you go to higher-primate.com it's all
like monkeys and psychedelic drugs and

3265
02:53:49,370 --> 02:53:49,930
uh,

3266
02:53:49,930 --> 02:53:52,750
got some new designs coming in and I've
got a bunch of new things happening and

3267
02:53:52,751 --> 02:53:55,120
uh, all that will be done
when my new website is done,

3268
02:53:55,121 --> 02:53:58,090
which is also the answer to when my
new comedy special will be released.

3269
02:53:58,360 --> 02:54:02,170
I'm doing it Louis C K Style and I'll
be done through my website and it'll all

3270
02:54:02,171 --> 02:54:04,560
be done. Uh, when my website is released,

3271
02:54:04,600 --> 02:54:07,450
it would soon be within the next
couple months. All right. That's it.

3272
02:54:07,451 --> 02:54:10,090

I take the shit before anything I do.

3277
02:54:21,161 --> 02:54:25,270
That's important because I'm
not that smart on my own. I
need help. I need coffee.

3278
02:54:25,271 --> 02:54:30,250
