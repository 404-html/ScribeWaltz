1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,231
Bump,
bump,

2
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:01,651
bump,
bump,

3
00:00:01,651 --> 00:00:02,101
bump,
bump,

4
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:02,370
bump.

5
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,310
Uh,

6
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,000
uh,
he's double shooting me.

7
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,710
That means we're alive with the Kido
kid.

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,680
Kido.
I've been for data.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,110
That's your new nickname,
the Kiddo kid.

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,230
That's hilarious.
The kido kid.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,120
I'm just happy you're doing it man.
You know,

12
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:33,210
before we get into the UFC stuff,
Brendan and I were talking before this

13
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:33,920
about,
uh,

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,480
he,
he started the no sugar diet.

15
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,680
He,
he went,

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,080
he went straight Kido,
which is crazy for me.

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,320
There's no way he's ever going to do
this.

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,540
You're so addicted to candy.
He's the straight candy man.

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,480
Like you and my car.
Everything.

20
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,460
Ari Shaffir is probably the worst I've
ever seen.

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,451
Really?
Yeah.

22
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:55,740
He'll take a day off candy and he'll
just eat like pasta and bread all day,

23
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:58,120
like Kit giving us body candy and some
other floor.

24
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,610
Damn.
For me,

25
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:03,450
I think it was just like,
I've tried all these diets and I've,

26
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,730
and I've never got the results I wanted
to and going,

27
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,070
as soon as I started doing this,
everyone's like,

28
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:08,904
be careful man.

29
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,970
The cravings were gonna have headaches.
I'm going to have shit.

30
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,021
Um,
matter of fact,

31
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,870
I worked out more.
Was it hard at all over the first couple

32
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:17,520
of days?
Oh that's interesting.

33
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:19,140
Not at all.
Not at all.

34
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,810
Well you know,
if you talked to that Mark Sisson Guy,

35
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:24,960
he would probably say that your body
just adapts really well to it.

36
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,490
That's what I would probably imagine.
But I think like two to be sure you're

37
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:32,820
even in a state of Ketosis,
you got to measure your blood but it's

38
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:34,850
going to be annoying for you.
Just like it was annoying from,

39
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:39,140
I kind of have to find out where's the
right place to stab yourself because of

40
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:42,900
the fingertips weren't working for me.
It's like those little little insulin

41
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,840
when you checking your blood sugar.
Yeah,

42
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,440
they weren't getting through my
fingertips.

43
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,880
I guess I'm thinking of his fingers like
gas.

44
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,810
I saw all those ketalysis this is all,
I've got some serious councils up in

45
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,644
here.
I hear Ya.

46
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,920
Over the last shoot,
I think most guys doing their pinky.

47
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,260
My Dad's diabetic,
so I see him doing the pink yellow time.

48
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,230
He some days a little banana thing.
Somebody sent me one though and they

49
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:05,480
said there's a legit one now for your
breath at the ones for the breath used

50
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:08,190
to suck,
but now they have one that's legit and

51
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:12,180
it shows what Ha,
what level of it shows Jenica ketosis.

52
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:13,890
Really.
I have to look into that.

53
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,740
I don't even remember who sends.
I don't give a fuck.

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,080
I just feel good.
Well,

55
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,170
you know what I'm saying?
I just feel good.

56
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,570
I'm just gonna keep doing it,
dude.

57
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:22,050
You,
you're going to feel this is the crazy

58
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:24,600
thing.
You're going to feel this way and this

59
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,590
is how you feel now.

60
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,920
Like you know this thing in the middle
of the day where you get tired,

61
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,610
that's going to go away and I got that
when I went to,

62
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,960
I went to Mexico when on vacation,
had a great,

63
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,760
great old time,
but I said,

64
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:37,200
fuck it man.
I'm in Mexico.

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
I'm on vacation.
I'm going to go off my diet.

66
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:40,740
I'm going to have some fucking
Burrito's.

67
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:43,560
You know,
tea is getting in there.

68
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,090
I had Tacos,
I had it and then I said,

69
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:46,200
fuck it.
While I'm doing that,

70
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,420
I might as well get dessert.
Dude.

71
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:53,421
I felt like diggity dog shit when you
haven't done that and to know then right

72
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,400
away crash.
Yeah,

73
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:59,830
right away I felt terrible after eating
the cake and then in the day,

74
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,430
I mean I was just,
I could barely stay conscious.

75
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,660
I can't,
you can't do that anymore.

76
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,390
Yeah.
I think my thing was is I've always

77
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:11,470
wanted to do it but I never really had a
like a strict reason to do it.

78
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,130
Like something that just put it,
put me over to finally make the decision

79
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,800
to do it and I was thinking about how
much you do because I have a lot of

80
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,000
stuff going on.
I'm like dude,

81
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:20,140
I'm getting tired man.
I'm not,

82
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,710
I'm not doing that well like I could be
doing better just mentally more clear

83
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:27,490
and I'm working out doing all this stuff
and you and I have been talking about

84
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,750
for a while and I was like,
fuck,

85
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,300
I might as well try it man.
Cause coffee really does nothing to me

86
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:32,920
anymore.
I could drink six gap.

87
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,200
Tina's before I go to bed and sleep just
fine,

88
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,800
just fine.
Probably just get into rem sleep at all.

89
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,190
So I'm like,
I gotta do something and do it.

90
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,930
It's been great.
Wow.

91
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,880
That's amazing.
Good for you.

92
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,460
When it gets these 12 step programs,
then it gets easy because after awhile

93
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,190
you just look at food is like,
oh,

94
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,470
well this is what I'm supposed to be
eating.

95
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,330
That other stuff isn't food.
You know,

96
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:57,220
like you don't look at a candy bar like,
oh,

97
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:59,620
that would be good right now.
That's what's crazy to me.

98
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,990
I'm not like,
like you were talking about how you have

99
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,390
those Keto genic like greasy pcs or
whatever.

100
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,980
I don't even want to try that bullshit.
I should give him a shout out.

101
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:13,450
Quest labs sent us a bunch of stuff when
they found out that we were,

102
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:14,290
uh,
in quest.

103
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,700
Quest are great.
I know those guys,

104
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:17,740
they're great,
but like even like sweets or something

105
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,660
that simulates sweets,
I don't want that.

106
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,440
It's,
that's,

107
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,090
this stuff's good.
Like they have crackers.

108
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,880
You can eat these crackers.
These are like Kido crackers.

109
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,100
They're saltings.
I fucking hate crackers.

110
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,730
No,
I'm against carves in any form.

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,700
Those aren't really carbs.
I know.

112
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,780
Fuck.
They are the way they look anymore,

113
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,280
Joe.

114
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,040
Yes.
Okay.

115
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,873
You,
you're a new man.

116
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,391
I know,
man.

117
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:42,391
I feel good pain a week later.
I'm just 300 pounds I've been taken to,

118
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,570
it's called a key genics and it's
exogenous ketones.

119
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,890
These are,
um,

120
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,890
I don't know if that guy,
dom d'agostino had something to do with

121
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,390
this.
So many told me I need to research it

122
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:54,580
further,
but these are exogenous ketones.

123
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:58,270
You take this and you mix that with
water and it puts you in a state of

124
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:01,330
ketosis really rapidly.
Like within an hour.

125
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,670
12 carbs though.
Yeah,

126
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:06,900
but it's okay for the whole day.
I mean,

127
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:08,350
how much can,
I don't need anything.

128
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,570
All,
I have some nuts in my car covered in

129
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:12,490
cinnamon.
I'll snack on those all day.

130
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:14,260
Be just fine.
Never hungry.

131
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,760
You're very dead.
It's something's going on.

132
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:18,490
And I got knocked to my colleagues.
I have nuts.

133
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,820
Like Macadamia Homans Ooh,
I'm going to family.

134
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,970
Just good cinnamon on top.
You know what I do?

135
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:28,630
I eat those pistachios that are already
shelled also.

136
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,070
You got crack the shell open?
No,

137
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:32,740
they're already shelled.
All you're saying they're not shell?

138
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,851
No,
the bull.

139
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:37,240
The shell shelled meaning the shells
removed.

140
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,110
Oh,
word.

141
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,700
Yeah.
That's not the correct term.

142
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:42,310
Shelled shell will shit wouldn't,
okay.

143
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,740
Yeah.
Like um,

144
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,300
I mean what would be,
it's not come on your show.

145
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,561
No,
I don't.

146
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:49,840
I don't believe so.
I think they say shelled,

147
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,750
meaning that they have been removed as
long goes,

148
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,650
hey,
you want some shell?

149
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,580
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe it isn't.

150
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,740
Some shelled nuts.
I'd say,

151
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:58,250
well,
is there any we can on Sheldon?

152
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,080
Where you saying makes total sense I
now,

153
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,741
well,
whatever it is,

154
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:03,440
I buy them in the bag with no shells.
Let me just put it that way.

155
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,280
I don't like that.

156
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,740
A big giant ass bag and I just put it
out.

157
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,720
Just force feed.
I like the work.

158
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,880
It's like,
it's like with sunflower seeds.

159
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,560
I don't like just regular sunflower
seeds.

160
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:15,890
I get to have the shell like the word.
A lot of people do that man.

161
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:17,480
Like if you just got a plate of crab
meat,

162
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,640
fuck that noise.
I want the legs a crack open.

163
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,040
I see that weird.
No,

164
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,450
no,
there's merit to that.

165
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,290
Yeah,
no,

166
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,510
I get it.
I had some regular pistachios the other

167
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,650
day and I had to work for them and the
morning and they were kind of like a

168
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:32,630
flavor fall on the outside.
I enjoyed it.

169
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,100
Yeah,
like sucking on the ship times.

170
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:39,101
I just like to pour a coffee cup full of
pistachios and just eat that shit while

171
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:40,820
I'll watch TV.
I'll do a mix.

172
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,930
A little macadamia nuts.

173
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,970
Cashews,
all on salted.

174
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
I hate salt.
You're so healthy now.

175
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:47,020
What's going on?
I don't know what the

176
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,390
new fucking cheetos.
It's weird man.

177
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:55,510
Like Keto kid.
That made me like,

178
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,840
are you getting a lot of uh,
vegetables into tons of veggies?

179
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,920
You know what my big thing is,
I probably,

180
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,740
I made it every night for dinner since
I've been on the diet is I do like a a

181
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:14,600
shredded lettuce cabbage mix that I
saute and I put buffalo meat in it and

182
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,420
then I'll put like hot sauce on top of
that every night.

183
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,690
I know.
I look forward to it too.

184
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,270
Wow.
It's so weird.

185
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,460
Yeah.
Weight is going to melt off your body to

186
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,920
the first,
the first few pounds that you lose.

187
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,970
Obviously I'm not a doctor or supposed
to be just your body adjusting to this

188
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:38,110
new lower inflammation diet.
You don't have as much inflammation as

189
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,970
much water storage and your body and
your,

190
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,120
you just get rid of some of that and
then your body as it starts burning off

191
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:46,610
fat.

192
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,360
One of the coolest things is you don't
get those crazy hunger cravings either.

193
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,340
It's a completely different kind of
hunger.

194
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,110
Well plus it last longer.
Right,

195
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,780
because you're,
you're eating these fats so you're not,

196
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,310
your body is not spiking insulin.
Right.

197
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,960
It's like more of a steady.
Exactly.

198
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:03,980
Yes.
And the spike in insulin is fucking real

199
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:05,150
man.
Because like I told you,

200
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,730
I cheated in Mexico and then I cheated
one other time.

201
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:08,540
I just said,
fuck it.

202
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,680
I want a cheese burger and a milkshake
from this like old time sewing Eric and

203
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,470
Oh,
oh,

204
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,050
I was so dead afterwards.
It was like somebody poisoned to me.

205
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,900
I mean,
it was really,

206
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,390
I mean,
she's so dramatic,

207
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:21,320
man.
Naw,

208
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,011
bitch.
No.

209
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:26,120
I really feel like I was having the
hardest time getting up off the couch.

210
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:27,200
I was like,
God,

211
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,790
I can't.
I just couldn't breathe.

212
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:33,770
It was like my body had just shut down
to process that garbage little shit.

213
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,090
It's like,
what the fuck is this?

214
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:36,980
I think the,
the only thing that took me a while to

215
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,320
get used to it was so much mct oil.
Yeah.

216
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:42,240
You gotta be careful with that though.
I text you yesterday I was running,

217
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,110
I took this a bunch of snow,
mct oil.

218
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,250
I swear to God.
I was like,

219
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,350
it's Venice.
I might as well just shit my pants,

220
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:50,420
right?
Like no one's gonna give a fuck.

221
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,800
I will just shit everywhere.
Yeah.

222
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:55,430
There's a tipping point with mct oil
where it just opens a flow.

223
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,380
There's no
fucking,

224
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,220
there's no like there's no like third
gear first or fucking six game man.

225
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,560
Where is it?
Is it like two tablespoons,

226
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,100
three tablespoons?
You're gone.

227
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,780
That should is the perfect storm for
explosive diarrhea.

228
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,070
If you want it,
clean out the pipes,

229
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:16,770
you don't need a Kalanick but it's not
like,

230
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,700
God,
I gotta take a shit.

231
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,280
It's like it's coming.
You better fucking figure it out.

232
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,630
Squeezing your butt up and you're
tensing up your innards.

233
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,120
You're trying to like clamp it down.
I have to stop running.

234
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,280
I was like,
I better think I pick him up game plan

235
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:32,070
and my mouth started watering like,
oh shit.

236
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,230
There's that battle that you play.
It's very similar.

237
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:35,970
The battle when you're trying not to
come,

238
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,550
you know the battle when you try not to
come loose,

239
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,710
just squeezing it dickish pledge.
It is.

240
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,890
It's very similar to that.
I don't want to shit my pants.

241
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,380
Pow.
You have willpower cause there's some

242
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,930
weak people in the world that just shit
their pants more than they shut.

243
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,410
You can't be my friend if you have,
you just give up and shit your pants

244
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,740
blue spot
to keep my butt tight.

245
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,440
You just got no willpower,
man.

246
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,020
Yeah,
but then I've Shit my pants before too.

247
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,390
It's like,
here's the deal.

248
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,120
It's okay to tap out.
Just don't tap out like a bitch.

249
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:20,850
Not at least put up a fight.
If you're gonna lose the fight,

250
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,610
be actually in a position where you have
to tap.

251
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,070
You just tap cause you,
you're sweating and it's just,

252
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:27,630
you have no other options.
Yeah.

253
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,400
Hey Calvin lighty one time,
said he shit his pants and then showed

254
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:34,710
up with regular beds.
Well,

255
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,810
that's one I just can't do.
He said that he couldn't make it to the

256
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:41,690
show at the ice house.
I looked at the,

257
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,960
because he shit his pants and I said,
what are you talking about?

258
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,160
He goes,
I shit my pants.

259
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:48,480
I can't come.
I said,

260
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,000
Brian,
these people came to see you.

261
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,440
They're here to see you.
And he goes,

262
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:56,010
what should I do?

263
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,700
I go,
go to a fucking bathroom at a gas

264
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,010
station,
take your fucking pants off,

265
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,980
throw them in the sink,
cleaned the shit out of your pants,

266
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,560
wring them out.
And they get over here with wet pants on

267
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:09,810
and a story.
How old is he at this time?

268
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,950
Oh,
like a year ago.

269
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,100
This is the go.
What should I do?

270
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,990
You got to show up,
man.

271
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,480
You've got to show up.
Like people don't want to smell shit on

272
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:21,210
you.
So if you could just get to the bathroom

273
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:22,800
for five minutes,
you can fix all that.

274
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:25,170
It's going to take a little work and you
going to wear wet pants.

275
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,250
But that's what you have to do.
Beauty,

276
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,080
painful paid the there.
Brian Cowen fans will fuck you up dude.

277
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,810
Who hanging out your pants.
Tell some jokes.

278
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:35,610
So he shows up.
10 minutes later it's pants or dry.

279
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,000
And I go,
what happened?

280
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,750
And he said,
oh,

281
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,550
I had a pair of pants in my trunk.
The worst liar pair of pants or your

282
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,870
trunk.
I don't know what.

283
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,100
I didn't even want to ask what was
really going on?

284
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,250
Get into it.
You Shit your pants as a grown man.

285
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,230
I mean,
it ain't a simple procedure.

286
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,720
There's some steps you got to me.
That's the next next shirt is I had

287
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:59,470
another pair of pants.
These pants in the trunk.

288
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,910
Have you ever had a pair of pants in
your trunk and you didn't know about now

289
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,310
versus shit,
your pants and go?

290
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,990
What is the odds that the pants are my
trunk?

291
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,090
Never.
I guess when I'm older I might,

292
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:15,091
I might have a baseball hat and there
I can cover my balls.

293
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,920
I love that story.
Kind of all the lies.

294
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,120
Shitting your pants.

295
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,830
I don't know.
I'm going to need some shits though.

296
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,890
I'm gonna need to see some stuff.
I do not know if it was a lie,

297
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:25,900
but Goddamn,
he smelled so normal.

298
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,040
I mean,
I would have just only calendar.

299
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,540
It's the best is the only he could do
that.

300
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,060
Like you shit all over your pants and
just find your pants.

301
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,770
I mean,
I guess it was like your pants away.

302
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,170
If it was like a clean log though,
you could figure it out.

303
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,221
Yeah,
yeah,

304
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:39,551
yeah,
yeah.

305
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,440
If you look co felted coming out,
you're like,

306
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:41,921
oh,
okay,

307
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:45,040
we see what we got.
This is a blockbuster.

308
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,910
This is a fucking Mumbo roll of
submarines.

309
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,440
I figured out this is one of them lumbar
roads.

310
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,050
They either of those trucks that go down
on

311
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,410
gigantic star log shit like,
oh boy.

312
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,590
But then there's ones you're like,
oh my God,

313
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,120
this is 100% diarrhea.

314
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,370
Oh that mct oil.
There's no,

315
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,580
there's no guessing.
That short is no spray.

316
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,100
Paint your pants.
Now there's a feeling,

317
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:15,070
it's like your butt has different levels
of sensitivity,

318
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,940
but knows when you're going to blow out
a hard,

319
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,920
like a beefy pot roasts shit.
You know one of them thick,

320
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:28,570
dried out shits that's very dense.
Your but knows if I,

321
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,171
it's like,
look,

322
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:31,930
we're eventually going to have to sit
down here and there's going to be a big

323
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:33,450
one.
So I want you to get a magazine,

324
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,030
get your mind right,
so make sure you're fucking,

325
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:37,690
I pose to her.
But then there's the fire drill.

326
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,410
So fucking fire too.
And that's what I had in Venice

327
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,780
yesterday.
And she know he,

328
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,240
before you see,
you don't even look,

329
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,570
you can't see your asshole.
Even if you had to,

330
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,860
unless you're an acrobat,
use no way to even see your ass hole

331
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:50,950
with a high mct oil.

332
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,530
There's like,
it's like a ten second warning rick.

333
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,860
Oh Shit.
I'm saying like there's a certain level

334
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:59,380
of sensitivity for sure.
If you had explained that,

335
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,410
if he had explained the feeling of,
what is it like when you have to take a

336
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:03,760
shit,
you'd be like,

337
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:06,070
well,
there's different kinds of feelings when

338
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:07,540
you have to take a shit.
There's like,

339
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,880
eventually I'm gonna have to take a
shit.

340
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,380
There's a,
Oh God,

341
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,320
oh boy,
it's going to be a whopper.

342
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,610
But,
but it's a shit.

343
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,730
And then there's,
ah,

344
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,080
that terrace level five shit.
Yeah.

345
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,060
I arenia feeling like it's their signals
in your body that we always think of.

346
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,650
We put him in like one classification,
but they're radically different.

347
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,990
It's complicated.
It's fucking,

348
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,640
it is.
We break it down.

349
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:36,460
It's complicated.
The diary of feeling is super

350
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:37,750
complicated.
It's like,

351
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,440
hello.
Oh,

352
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,250
how do I know?

353
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,040
How do I know that this is about to come
flying?

354
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,700
My body starts sweating to brace
yourself,

355
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:49,210
son.
We were about to get active in some

356
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:52,610
foods to some foods are just like
sometimes spicy food for whatever

357
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:56,300
reason,
just break stuff loose off the walls and

358
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:59,430
there's the gods at math,
the latch fucking much.

359
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,550
It's,
it's fucking broken.

360
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:04,220
Fire hydrant come out of your ass.
It's complicated.

361
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,700
We can do a podcast for three hours
straight and shit.

362
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,530
Yeah.
Yeah man.

363
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,420
It's,
it's very important.

364
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,310
It's very important.
So really it's so easy on the MCT oil

365
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:19,050
kids oral to our story.
Yeah.

366
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,510
You're supposed to have like at the
most,

367
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,360
a couple of tablespoons.
Yeah.

368
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,400
Don't squirt that shit drinking.
It's not going to kill you,

369
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:26,760
but you'll,
you know,

370
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,150
you will shit your pants.
Yeah.

371
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,910
You'll piss out of your ass
straight up.

372
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,620
The big combination if you really want
to clean the pipes is those hoke load

373
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:39,170
shakes,
Kale shakes that I make with mct oil in

374
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:39,290
it.

375
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,880
Preach.
Whoa.

376
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,730
I started out in coconut oil.
Coconut oil was nice,

377
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,100
like scoop it out.
A couple of 'em,

378
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
you know,
extra virgin or whatever the fuck it is.

379
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,330
Get a nice couple of tablespoons,
throw it in there.

380
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,630
But then I decided to go hard and go
down to the paint called mct oil and uh,

381
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:02,350
I forget the number that I use.
Four or five tablespoons if fucked up.

382
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,240
I use four or five tablespoons for one.
I'm one of those blenders

383
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,150
does bro.
How many,

384
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,510
what do you,
what did he say that is about 16 hour,

385
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:18,550
not 20 ounces maybe.
So five scoops of MCT oil?

386
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,580
Or were you thinking though?
I don't want to see what happens

387
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,250
usually.
Usually I'm always down for more means

388
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,610
better.
And I didn't know back then when I was,

389
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:30,840
when I first started shitting myself.
See,

390
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:33,140
I knew come closest shitting myself.

391
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,800
I knew I still fucking do it.
I didn't know mct oil that was doing it.

392
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,220
I thought it was the,
just the intense amount of fiber from

393
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:43,030
the handshakes or from the um,
uh,

394
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
yeah,
all the,

395
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,300
you know,
I mean there's cucumber in there and

396
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:51,301
carrots and there are a salary rather
and ginger and garlic and usually like a

397
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:53,510
piece of fruit,
like an app or something like that.

398
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:56,510
Like there's so much fiber.
I thought it was just blowing everything

399
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:59,710
out.
But there's a big difference between now

400
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,700
when I had the extra mct oil,
it's like it's,

401
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,890
it's like a turbo turbo engine.
Is it lubing the everything up.

402
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,140
Why is that?
Just gets in there and wreaks havoc.

403
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,670
It just gets in there and fucking why
does it make it all come out as liquid?

404
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:17,150
Like what is happening?
It's complicated.

405
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,180
So complicated.
How the fuck does that work?

406
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,610
But it seems like it would be a good
thing.

407
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,570
Like it would be uncomfortable but like
something like that would clean you out.

408
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,450
I think it's a good thing probably.
I feel like it.

409
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,720
I hope so.
Yeah.

410
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,260
I hope so too.
Anyway,

411
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,350
good source of healthy fats.
He just take it easy fucks.

412
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,610
Yeah.
He's the man.

413
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,840
More is not better.
Yeah.

414
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,090
So a big UFC this weekend.
That's one of the reasons why we've had

415
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,070
down here and just start talking about
shitting their pants and even 25

416
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:47,130
minutes,
man,

417
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,130
talking about whatever though.
No,

418
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,010
a big UFC

419
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,550
this weekend,
but I was talking to you through tax.

420
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:57,170
I feel like no one's really talking
about [inaudible] 97 because the connor

421
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,090
that straight up [inaudible],
that's all I referred them now,

422
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,630
the two best pound for pound fighters in
the world.

423
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:07,920
Universally heralded,
two best pound for pound Christ John

424
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,550
Jones and Demetrius mighty mouse Johnson
fighting on a car this weekend and no

425
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:15,150
one's talking about I ain't Anthony
Pettis is on that bitch versus Barboza.

426
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,520
Yeah,
but Jon Jones,

427
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,830
uh,
in my opinion he's number two.

428
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,800
Not that he's not that he's not awesome.
I just,

429
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,340
I just go off technique.
I think that Demetrius Johnson is on

430
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:29,070
another level.
I think he had my eye on another level

431
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:32,070
because it's so small.
But I think what Jon Jones does and his

432
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,920
risk of losing is so much higher than
mighty mouse is,

433
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,400
and he's destroying dudes.
Yup.

434
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,840
And not training and high as,
fuck,

435
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,400
you're,
let's toss that on top of it.

436
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,910
You got good points there,
but just because you didn't train,

437
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,810
it doesn't make your performances more
valid.

438
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,740
Like because you beat Daniel cormier and
you did coke three weeks before,

439
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,620
you still have the same fight with
Daniel cormier.

440
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:59,190
It just because you went five rounds
with Alexander Gustafson and struggled

441
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:01,620
because you didn't train,
you still struggled.

442
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,760
So although I agree that Jon Jones at
his best is the Motherfucker,

443
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,070
I mean Jon Jones at his best when he
choked out,

444
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:10,820
Leo Machida when he just dropped him and
walked away.

445
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,750
I don't think,
yeah,

446
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,030
I don't think get the contest because I
think John,

447
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:17,430
the way he's being guys,
he's facing tougher competition.

448
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:20,070
You could argue that and his level,
his level,

449
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:24,900
his margin of error is so much smaller.
Like let's say Dj has one off night and

450
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,020
someone lands,
lands a big like right hand on him,

451
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:28,980
he'll figure it out.

452
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,300
And that right hand is like Atlanta
again.

453
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,760
If Jon Jones has an off night,
again,

454
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,840
even Osp and Osp lands a huge left hook.
It's over.

455
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:39,150
So it's true.
You've very good points.

456
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,090
These are very good points.
And thinking about the legends,

457
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:44,090
he's beat mighty mouse,
mighty mouse.

458
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,390
Next fight.
If he gets passed,

459
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:47,910
so Hutto he's fighting a winner of the
ultimate fighter.

460
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,910
That's what the fuck we a result too.
There's just no one for him to fight.

461
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,430
Whitney five Benevidez no,
no.

462
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:55,560
His next fight.
They said if he wins this fight,

463
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,570
he's going to fight the winner of the
ultimate fighter.

464
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,820
That sounds crazy,
but that's,

465
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,860
that's where that's,
that's who says people,

466
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,320
tiny people.
People don't look at those little tiny

467
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:06,480
guys.
It sucks cause he's so talented.

468
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,820
He's so good.
I actually think it's better for the

469
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:10,710
sport.
I love Demetrius Johnson.

470
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:11,370
I love Dj.

471
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,720
I absolutely love him.
Think he's great.

472
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,300
I think it's better for the sport of
pseudo wins.

473
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,650
What?
Yeah.

474
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,820
Why do you say that?
Because of his,

475
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:20,180
his upbringing,
his background,

476
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,080
Olympic gold medalists didn't go to
college,

477
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:25,710
just pursued the Olympic straight out of
high school and one gold.

478
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,170
The youngest ever doing gold.
You know,

479
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:30,960
his Mexican roots.
I think UFC could use more of that.

480
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,220
Dj needs a nemesis.
He the old like although had mcgregor,

481
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,430
right?
All those never been bigger.

482
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:38,010
Now we're,
I think DJ needs a nemesis and if he

483
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:39,150
beats them,
we don't have one.

484
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:40,890
He fights the fucking ultimate fighter
winner.

485
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,320
It's true.
Or unless he beats him barely,

486
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,400
you know,
who knows.

487
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:45,530
But even then,
look,

488
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,180
so who knows not to joke.
The best wrestler in mma today,

489
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,780
I mean arguably that's competing in 125
pound division.

490
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,080
Who the F who's ever had more wrestling
accomplishments?

491
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,850
He's an Olympic gold medalist.
Malice mean that's the,

492
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,020
the beast of the beasts.
So you know,

493
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:03,700
he's a winner.
He's just a straight winner.

494
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,730
The real question is,
is that cut to one 25 too brutal cause

495
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,590
he's look good in his fights.
The scary thing to me though that he

496
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,940
looked better if he didn't cut.
I always think guys would,

497
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,980
I always think they would.
A guy like him,

498
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:19,780
I wonder,
I'm like a wonder if he's got that

499
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:21,970
restless mentality to always be the
biggest guy.

500
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,470
Look what he did.
Cutting that weight though.

501
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,430
Like he has it down to a science.
So usually wrestlers are a beast at it.

502
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,870
Like DC.
Amazing.

503
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,980
Pendo.
Amazing.

504
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:31,360
You're talking about guys who never
really missed,

505
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:32,380
wait,
why am I rumbled?

506
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:34,870
Back when he used to go down from like
200 plus,

507
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,580
it was just unhealthy.
One 70.

508
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:38,230
It wasn't saying that just unhealthy.

509
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,250
I can't believe no one was like,
God,

510
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:41,080
I feel like it's a bad idea.
You might die.

511
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,360
Um,
and then data was like,

512
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:44,920
Nah,
I got this dead.

513
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,240
Dot.
A.

514
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,080
Dot.
That's,

515
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,320
I can't have that shit.
But they said dot.

516
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,480
Only had to lose three pounds a week of
the fight.

517
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:53,930
Still hold all.
I'll just say it.

518
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,640
You better know your weight cuts.
Yeah.

519
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,610
I think there was a lot of other issues
going on there.

520
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,650
Physically it was just wasn't prepared
for that.

521
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,630
But there's a big difference between him
and a guy.

522
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:03,430
Like just being silly.
I know.

523
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:05,440
So who does the fucking best in the
business?

524
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:07,450
He's a master at weight cutting.
You just look at his,

525
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,790
you know,
his wins all submission.

526
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,451
I mean,
all,

527
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:11,530
uh,
decisions.

528
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,110
His level of competition.
Dj,

529
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,850
I think he's number two,
pound for pound.

530
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,110
Best.
Good luck,

531
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:17,670
man.

532
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,210
Yeah,
is a motherfucker.

533
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,320
He's an artist,
man.

534
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:24,370
He's my favorite guy to watch because
you just don't get to hit him.

535
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:25,700
You don't get to.
So I,

536
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,210
it works well.
How it works is he's going to be moving.

537
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:30,820
You're going to be reacting,
you're gonna think he's gonna go left.

538
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:32,500
He's going to go right.
He's going to punch you in the face

539
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:35,260
while he's doing it.
He's going to circle out leg kick you on

540
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:37,990
the way out and then enter when you
think he's going to exit.

541
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,600
Go to the right when you think he's
going to go to the left and constantly

542
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,710
switch between takedowns and punches and
he gets you up against the cage and he

543
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:48,280
drops down for doubles and comes up with
an elbow and it's all creative.

544
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,200
This is all flowing together and there's
no one with better skills than him now,

545
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,860
but I don't think that makes him the
best fighter.

546
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,220
It's a good if that makes sense.
But some still think if I'm Dj,

547
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,900
I'm gonna sit there and God,
how,

548
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,300
how the fuck can I become a draw?
I'm tiny.

549
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:02,890
People don't give a fuck about tiny
people.

550
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,050
Let's see,
the one guy who's beat me,

551
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,680
dominick Cruz is a massive star.
I need to go up in weight and fight

552
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:10,300
Dominic Cruz.
That's the fight.

553
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:14,530
Well grab the mic after beat so Hutto
and go dominic,

554
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,660
you though.
You're the last guy to beat me.

555
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,330
Especially in the UFC.
Before that it was a homeboy,

556
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,210
the fricking Irish cat.
I forget his name.

557
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,910
Anyways,
he just needs to get on the Mike and go

558
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,740
yo the last guy to beat me.
Prick.

559
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,271
Picket.
Yeah,

560
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:29,050
exactly.
Pick it.

561
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,610
Beat him and decision English guy.
Yeah,

562
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,730
my bad.
My bad.

563
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,950
Loved that guy might happen.
But he just needs to get on the mic and

564
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:40,330
create some sort of hype like you're in
a pseudo thing till the common fan.

565
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,910
These are two tiny dudes.
It's hard,

566
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:46,850
but to stay at one 25 it ain't man.
You're not going to become mainstream.

567
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:49,100
Knocked can become,
you're not going to make a lot of money.

568
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,710
Mm.
Well I wonder though.

569
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,350
Well maybe you're right,
cause if so who don't beat him then

570
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,420
maybe don't.
We got a little bit of drama.

571
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,790
Yeah,
well we'll see.

572
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,980
Looks it's not outside the realm of
possibility.

573
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:05,120
So he knows this thing for him.
So hutto beats them and talk some shit.

574
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:06,860
It's kind of back and forth fight and
then they fight again.

575
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:10,100
We'll watch that three match or let's
say just destroy.

576
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:12,530
So Huda,
so Hutto don't wait for the ultimate

577
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:14,340
fighter winner.
We don't give a fuck about those small

578
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:16,130
getting loans with fighter.
Get on the mic.

579
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:18,200
Call out dominick Cruz on.
I'm wanting to see.

580
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:20,780
So who don't you versus someone like
Benevidez.

581
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,010
Me Too.
I wanted to see,

582
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:25,880
so who'd o versus like a real veteran,
but then if let's say fights Benevidez

583
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,260
in Brendan's visas beats him.
He went Benevidez mighty mouse to bet

584
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,870
three three.
You do?

585
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,100
I do.
Yeah.

586
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,890
Again,
I get it.

587
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,080
You do.
Everyone else does not.

588
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:38,240
And I Benevidez is,
I love that dude.

589
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,950
Well,
there's two ways of looking at it as

590
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,930
excitement junkie and as a fan of the
art form.

591
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,820
For me as a fan of the art form,
I want to see dj with as many different

592
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:54,821
tests as possible because I'm a big fan
of technique and movement and I think

593
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:59,180
he's the highest expression of technique
and movement today cause this is

594
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:01,350
combinations.
The way he went away,

595
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,250
he stifled Dodson.
You don't stifle Dodson.

596
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,790
Dotson's a hurricane.
You got cows flying around your yard.

597
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,370
You know the fucking satellite dish.

598
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,240
We'll take your head off as it comes off
the roof.

599
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,130
Yeah,
he's so fast.

600
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:16,170
How about with the bag of teen off?
When he fought off,

601
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,080
he out cardio at him.
He was on a pos on epo on the owl

602
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,310
carney,
five pounds and he out cardio to him.

603
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,320
What the fuck teen offs got that style.
That's that Russian style that sometimes

604
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:28,700
works,
but sometimes it doesn't fucking,

605
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,220
it's really those guys.
They can see the shots.

606
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,690
Tents,
every punches.

607
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,880
It works at heavier.
It works at heavier weight.

608
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,083
He buckets,
you know,

609
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,580
fucked a lot of people up.
[inaudible] five you got a mother

610
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,090
fucker.
But I just think,

611
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,300
like you said,
there's from a purist point it's like

612
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,111
yeah,
mighty mouse.

613
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:53,010
Keep doing your thing as a guy looking
at what's best for him cause he's gonna

614
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,320
fight right.
He's just keep fine.

615
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,280
How can we make the most money and get
you the most fame and the best

616
00:25:58,281 --> 00:25:59,114
competition.

617
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,250
Dominick Cruz,
I agree with you.

618
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,460
It's the best,
best matchup in that they're virtually

619
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,700
identical sidewalk in size wise,
only 10 pounds off.

620
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,950
Yeah man.
And they're both talking about world

621
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:11,750
champions,
the highest level and what type of a

622
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:14,240
super fight.
We're not that far off 10 pounds at one

623
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:17,390
25 though it was actually quite a lot of
weight because it was a hundred pounds.

624
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:20,330
It'd be 10% there's a lot of weight,
but they could figure it out.

625
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:22,340
You know what I'm saying?
Like you could risk that for that big of

626
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:25,190
a payday.
Well or if Mickey Mouse has fought at

627
00:26:25,191 --> 00:26:27,000
that weight before and if he just did
it,

628
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,500
if they gave him like six months,
you give them six months,

629
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,020
we can do some squats or dead lifts or
whatever.

630
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:35,240
And the issue,
the issue is,

631
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,080
is cruise,
right,

632
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:39,020
so it's cruise has uriah,
let's say he beats you or I,

633
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:41,990
if we go with the vegas odds he beat
Uriah but then he has tj.

634
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:47,530
Well I think is going to go with Dodson.
If I had a gas like what the big fight

635
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:51,720
is at one 35 rematching Tj and Dotson
cause that was the finals of the

636
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:54,270
ultimate fighter.
Hundred a percent and both guys are

637
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,980
light years past where they were them.
I would like to see how dots and deals

638
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:03,981
with the champion Tj because Tj lost a
razor close decision to dominic.

639
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:04,854
Right?
Agreed.

640
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,560
Very critical.
I actually had tj winning very fucking

641
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:10,560
close fight and you know dominick Cruz
is a master.

642
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,150
I mean he is just a mass straight master
watching him move and it's footwork

643
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,350
inside the octagon and the way he mixes
things up.

644
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:20,100
You're like this fucking kid has been
out essentially for four years except

645
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:22,410
for one fight nuts.
Crazy.

646
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,440
Not One fight was like a minute
something and just stuffed stormed

647
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:28,560
Mitsui Guy.
So you're watching this guy move around.

648
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,440
I mean this is a guy who hasn't
performed under the pressure of the

649
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,530
cameras for all this time.
He still puts on this mass to pull

650
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:36,960
performance,
the best brain in MMA that I've ever

651
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:40,590
been as a wizard as far as him talking.
But I think you so,

652
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,440
but you have to,
so you got to keep tj active yet keep

653
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:47,150
dominic af active but dodson and and Tj
is um,

654
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,890
months.
A motherfucker for sure.

655
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,200
Monster fight,
but for,

656
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:54,270
for the the guy who's going to be left
out and fighting a no name or ultimate

657
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:55,560
fighter winners.
Dj.

658
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,660
Yeah,
that's weird that we're definitely,

659
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,970
what's going to happen.
Almost positive.

660
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:04,530
We should,
we should,

661
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,510
we are arguing this fake point.
Let's find out if it mighty mouse

662
00:28:09,511 --> 00:28:11,260
Johnson will one day fight the winner of
the ultra.

663
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:13,470
Maybe I'm just full of MCT oil.
I'm making shit up.

664
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,530
That'd be a weird thing to make up.
Usually I'm right on this stuff.

665
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,400
I feel like he does fight the next.
It was very challenging.

666
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,760
Vaguely familiar when you said it like a
vaguely,

667
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:25,560
it was like [inaudible].
Is that right?

668
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,390
I'm almost positive.
I believe you.

669
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,760
I believe you will find out.
Yeah,

670
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,950
you got it.
Is it Jim?

671
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,030
Demetrius Johnson isn't scared of tough
24 winters title shot.

672
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,130
I just don't care.
Wow.

673
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,560
So yeah.
So the winner gets that title shot.

674
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,060
Yeah,
that seems crazy.

675
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,910
Like I get it when you do that with
girls cause there's seven of them.

676
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,210
But with these guys,
is there any way we can help dj out

677
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:50,940
anymore?
You already fucked him on the xbox deal.

678
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,650
Is there any way we can do something
with them,

679
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,720
man?
Yeah.

680
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,210
Oh,
I think he's making money off of twitch.

681
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,520
Is he making money?
Does play video games on there?

682
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,290
Oh,
he's a legit Gamer.

683
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,150
He's addicted to gaming.
I just don't think it gets the credit he

684
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:08,190
deserves.
I tell every young fighter you want to,

685
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:09,960
you want to emulate someone.
Emulate this guy.

686
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,820
He's better be tiny though.
Yeah,

687
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,610
you gotta be tiny,
but you can emulate a version of it.

688
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:17,770
At one 70 you could emulate a version of
what he's doing at one spot.

689
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:21,480
If fricking the Kido kid here,
17 at six four,

690
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,700
210 pounds,
can't be like watch mighty mouse.

691
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,360
Like no fuck you can't.
But you can emulate a version of it.

692
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:31,260
Like Rico Verhoeven,
Rico Verhoeven is very technical,

693
00:29:31,261 --> 00:29:35,370
has incredible cardio and he's a,
he's a fantastic kickboxer and he's a

694
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,740
big motherfucker,
right?

695
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,650
MMA now.
Yes,

696
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,484
he has.
Good luck.

697
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,320
Good luck finding him.
Jesus Christ.

698
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,120
And he's trained at Aka.
Oh fuck.

699
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:44,650
Who the fuck's to?
Well,

700
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:46,840
the only,
the only problem mobilizes in the

701
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:48,220
beginning of their career.

702
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,790
They're susceptible to punches during
like takedown exchanges.

703
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,950
Like remember when random and knocked
out cro cop.

704
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:54,860
Dude,
I ever,

705
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,870
Woo.
She's Cro.

706
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:59,560
Cop was looking for the shot,
true and random and came at him with a

707
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:02,650
punch and just leapt at it.
When they can't ground lease their hands

708
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:03,820
in.
The gloves are so small.

709
00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:04,990
Like,
you know,

710
00:30:04,991 --> 00:30:07,430
in kickbox he can get away with a little
more or even in glory,

711
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,910
whatever.
But like your boy Pat Schilling,

712
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,070
right?
Like he should be merck in some of these

713
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:12,700
dudes.
But Oh,

714
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,900
showing you jo Shawn.
Sorry.

715
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,760
Shy.
Yeah,

716
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,880
Palestinians.
I was like,

717
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,440
who's this pat fellow with Joe Shoen?
Like he his standup,

718
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:21,800
some of the best in the world.
Yeah,

719
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:23,290
you seem fight mma.
It's not this.

720
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,400
He can't fight the same.
He's worried about the takedown and so

721
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,840
he's opened a knockout.
So you'll see me get knocked out by a

722
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:28,990
guy.

723
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,890
We were like,
dude,

724
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,430
if there was no takedowns he would fuck
you up.

725
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,040
Yeah,
100% feel like yelling at another crowd.

726
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,170
Yeah.
Well he's only doing that now.

727
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:40,150
I think he's going straight kickboxing
now.

728
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,580
It's smart man.
Quit messing with M and ms in his

729
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,050
thirties to you in your thirties the
game and it's full of grapplers known

730
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,770
standing with your crazy.
Not only that,

731
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:52,771
you might find yourself across the cage
from some Ncaa Division One national

732
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:56,840
champion and you are not stopping the
down.

733
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,430
You're not only your time,
but he doesn't give a fuck about

734
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,610
exciting fights.
He will ride you for 15 minutes and

735
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,530
loved every minute of it and say,
don't care.

736
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,960
Face was elbows and the only problem to
be able to get up.

737
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,610
I agree.
It was a big difference.

738
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:13,090
She's standing up with someone or guys
are used to slipping and moving and

739
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:17,620
anticipating angles and someone
literally holding your fucking face down

740
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,880
and force feeding you elbows.

741
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,650
Head has nowhere to go.
But also with,

742
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,030
with uh,
Joe Schilling,

743
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:29,160
it's more of like,
I just don't see the payoff for it boss.

744
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,150
So there's not a lot of money in kickbox
and what he's doing.

745
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:36,040
I'm hoping Bela Tarr brings it up cause
they got Bella kickboxing now and a UFC

746
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:38,380
now has glory so that UFC has glide
paths,

747
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:38,830
right?
Yeah.

748
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,040
Fight Pass is they're carrying glory.
Espn is also carrying glory.

749
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,170
I saw that.
They're smart man.

750
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,980
It's all fucking awesome product.
It's just right now people don't know

751
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:49,960
about it.
You have to tell the guy's story.

752
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,840
That's the problem.
We need to be invested in these guys

753
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,440
that would fucking Joe Schilling
stories.

754
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:57,100
It's great man.
But we have to be invested in care about

755
00:31:57,101 --> 00:31:59,590
the guy fighting.
Otherwise it's just two guys kickboxing.

756
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,110
I think if someone like Hbo got Ahold of
it,

757
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,210
if they did it the way they do hbo
boxing,

758
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:09,270
if they had like a Simon Marcus versus
Joe Schilling title fight like two guys

759
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:13,570
who have gone to war and have this crazy
history behind them where marcus stopped

760
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:16,270
him in one fine.
And then Joe Schilling Stop Marcus in

761
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:19,540
the fourth round of this insane fucking
war.

762
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,490
Did you,
were you there in La for that fight?

763
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,140
I watched it.
I was not there in person.

764
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,950
You I supposed to go with you actually
fucking Mooglie when he uncorked that

765
00:32:26,951 --> 00:32:30,370
right hand and you see Simon Marcus go
out,

766
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:33,460
you're like holy shit.
And it was in the fourth round.

767
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:38,250
When there's that moment when these guys
have to fight three rounds and if the

768
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,040
fight is draw at the

769
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,520
end of the third round,
they go to a final final debt.

770
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,510
What do they call it?
What are they going nation don't call it

771
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:48,410
sudden death.
No,

772
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,253
he can't.
That's tough.

773
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,640
That's rough.
Especially with the current debt.

774
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,060
So they go to this one more round and
uh,

775
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,470
when the one more round he'd see polls.
Guys are exhausted,

776
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:02,440
tired and sign and Marcus had spit his
mouthpiece out a couple times.

777
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,870
He got a point taken away from him for
it and uh,

778
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,840
it was looking like Joe Schilling was
going to probably win.

779
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:13,640
So Simon Marcus is going after him and
Joe Shelley just uncorked beautiful

780
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:18,641
right hook that just completely shuts
the light out on shot outside.

781
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,350
I think if Hbo got Ahold of that and did
a 24,

782
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:24,490
seven day honey Dick,
me more than amy,

783
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,363
I will.
If they do,

784
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,720
if they do a 24,
seven,

785
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:27,500
I will buy anything.

786
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,530
I don't even know the two Mexican boxers
and I'm so invested.

787
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:31,580
I'm like,
I can't wait.

788
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,020
I cannot wait.
They,

789
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,260
they do a better job than anyone.
You could smell the tacos and hear the

790
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:40,430
music and you feel whole family.
I know he going to warm to when they get

791
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:41,390
good,
but those things,

792
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,280
they do it the best.
No one does it better than him.

793
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,480
You know what else they do?
That's good.

794
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,370
That I like when they do that thing
where,

795
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,850
um,
um,

796
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,070
the face offs with less Kellerman yeah.
With Max will they sit across the table

797
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,980
and they both talk about like,
it's tough if they don't speak English

798
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:58,070
though cause a delay.
There's a little bit like with Canelo

799
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,040
with Canelo and Amir Khan.
I was watching like,

800
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:01,790
well,
okay.

801
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,710
You can see his air piece.
It's a little tough.

802
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,050
How much English is can no,
no,

803
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:06,470
he doesn't know.

804
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,430
I'm very good.
Yeah.

805
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,470
Very good.
Yeah.

806
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,360
The money's over here,
right?

807
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:12,920
They all want to come over here for the
money.

808
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:14,810
I would think you would just learn a
little bit of English.

809
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,120
Nothing makes sense.
Especially if you want,

810
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,190
you know,
if you want to get big brands over here.

811
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,400
Those shows though,
like a showtime has those ones they did

812
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:23,990
for mayweather's fights.
What do they call them?

813
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:25,560
All access.
Yeah.

814
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,360
Yeah.
Those,

815
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,740
those are big men.
They're good,

816
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:31,280
but they're just not the same as it as
as the original 24 sevens.

817
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,910
Nothing can fuck with a 20 verse seven
Ufc has done some pretty God damn good

818
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:36,470
ones embedded.
They're good.

819
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,200
They're good.
The one on when cowboy fought,

820
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,690
I'm Rafael dos Anjos.
Yeah,

821
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:42,920
they're great.
Or like,

822
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:43,790
yeah,
the run went there.

823
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,020
Good.
I'm with you man.

824
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,020
You're bat shit crazy.
He's been an entry on 20.7 what do you

825
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:51,160
think they got the idea and that guy's
voice and leaf is elite.

826
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,820
Shriver's
let's steal that guy and bring him the

827
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:56,840
UFC.
Yeah.

828
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:59,150
Who Do they use for the EOC voice?
I don't know.

829
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,920
Yeah,
that Liev Schreiber guys.

830
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:04,790
Weird because you don't recognize that
it's his voice because his voice is

831
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:07,610
somewhat in distinctive in some weird
way.

832
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,710
You know?
Like just like Liam Neeson.

833
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:12,470
If Liam Neeson was doing a voiceover for
something,

834
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:15,710
you would know it's Liam Neeson and that
would kind of be distracting.

835
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,960
I agree.
But with Liev Schreiber,

836
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:18,531
he's like,
Oh,

837
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:22,070
this guy is smooth.
It's fuck like God damn it's it.

838
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,750
It's how you get out of it.
For that guy,

839
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,430
I would literally,
I don't even know him.

840
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:26,860
I do anything for him.
Yeah.

841
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:29,180
That's all he'd get out of it.
He smooth.

842
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,670
Yeah.
I mean UFC could get someone else.

843
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,680
Well if you like a Morgan Freeman would
be,

844
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,380
well,
that brings up the thing that's going on

845
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:37,560
this week with Mcgregor.

846
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,110
Um,
we got caught off guard last episode.

847
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:43,170
Jamie and I were talking and just out of
nowhere,

848
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:45,660
it's just breaking news.
And Jamie brought it up to conor,

849
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:48,330
announced his retirement and I said,
I thought it was trawling and I had the

850
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:49,950
exact same reaction.
I was like,

851
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,060
he's trolling,
he's fucking around.

852
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,820
It's all weird.
He wouldn't,

853
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,850
he'd be more eloquent than that.
He'd be,

854
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,790
he,
he blew it up,

855
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,240
put it out better than that.
But yeah.

856
00:35:58,241 --> 00:36:00,840
And then the news started coming out and
I also started thinking,

857
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,010
well,
maybe,

858
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,540
maybe something happened in training or
maybe it was because of that guy that

859
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:10,170
died recently and people were saying,
you know,

860
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,380
they were shocked that I didn't know the
full details and the guy's dad,

861
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,200
honestly,
with things like this,

862
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:16,741
like,
you know,

863
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:20,010
it's going to happen and um,
it's unavoidable.

864
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,890
It's,
there's a certain amount of risk

865
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,650
involved in any extreme sport.

866
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,260
Plus that's the exception.
Yeah.

867
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,590
Yeah.
It's going to happen.

868
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,500
That's the exception.
It is like seeing mad at peanut butter

869
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:32,430
when someone dies.
It's like,

870
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:33,630
I'm still gonna need peanut,
you know,

871
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,700
it is exception,
but I was waiting for all the details

872
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:37,290
come out.
I don't think they've done an autopsy

873
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,610
yet.
They don't think they know.

874
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,260
I don't either.
I and I,

875
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,270
I didn't think that with connor,
and I don't know if this is,

876
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,950
I don't think it's sharing too much
information.

877
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,270
When Khan and I had lunch together,
I just talked to and he kept bringing up

878
00:36:50,271 --> 00:36:52,050
as a reoccurring theme when we were
talking.

879
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:53,520
He goes,
the media man,

880
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:55,320
like for this,
it's such a beast.

881
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,030
He's like,
like I've done interviews before,

882
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:58,350
but you know,
it's different.

883
00:36:58,351 --> 00:37:02,490
Like he's not a guy where when any other
fighters sit down and do an interview,

884
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,930
they're really not selling the fight.

885
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,180
They're talking about th their camp and
they're doing the same thing over and

886
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:08,370
over.
Connor's up fucking master that we've

887
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:11,670
never seen do it before.
So he's coming up with original content

888
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,930
nonstop.
He's on,

889
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,140
you know,
like when,

890
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,200
when he came on our podcasts,
he,

891
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,070
you could,
he was done.

892
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,640
He did the whole car wash.
He was exhausted and we came down.

893
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:23,820
You could tell him he was thinking and
just start spitting out gold.

894
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,960
He's just a beast,
man.

895
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,010
So to have that guy fly around the world
and do all this shit,

896
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,720
I mean,
at the end of the day,

897
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:33,810
we got to remember this is a sport.
This is not the wwe.

898
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:38,430
So to keep putting on the spectacle,
like it's similar to wwe at some point

899
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:39,264
yesterday,
man,

900
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:42,030
what these guys do is it's a real,
real,

901
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,610
we're in the HERP business.
He has to focus man.

902
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,030
And I just feel like,
I think connor's to blame too,

903
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,050
Dana,
is to blame.

904
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,920
I think both of them just need to talk
because if connor before it's bad

905
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:54,330
planning on him,
bad planning on Dana,

906
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,660
if he just went to listen,
I've sold this flight more than anyone.

907
00:37:57,661 --> 00:37:58,860
Man,
this is nuts.

908
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,750
I have to,
if I lose this next fight,

909
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:03,210
I'm screwed though.
A problem is it sets a precedent.

910
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:04,980
Now,
if I'm looking at it from a,

911
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:06,990
as a businessman,
if I was,

912
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,550
if I was a businessman,
let's pretend,

913
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,360
okay.
Uh,

914
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,840
I would say this sets a precedent.
You can't let someone decide what press

915
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:15,150
they do and press.
They don't do like you have an

916
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:20,070
obligation to fulfill certain
responsibilities like with the media for

917
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:20,760
sure.
Like,

918
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,710
like create hype.
But the question is,

919
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:27,770
but the question is like when do those
responsibilities move into like a purely

920
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:33,120
digital realm and when do those
responsibilities only in showing up

921
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:36,280
places,
physically old school going places.

922
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:40,180
Because like there's nothing wrong with
the occasional press conference,

923
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,100
right?
No,

924
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,690
but,
but also you can accomplish way more

925
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:46,120
with a few fucking viral videos than you
ever could.

926
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:50,710
Going to some weird interview with two
people that aren't mma fans.

927
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:53,800
And I think he made a really good point
about that doing this fucking these

928
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:56,830
morning shows,
they make them go do where you know,

929
00:38:56,831 --> 00:39:00,040
nobody knows who the guy is or the girl,
they don't give a shit about MNA.

930
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:00,940
Yeah,
they don't,

931
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,070
they don't want to talk to them the way
you want to talk to him or I want to

932
00:39:03,071 --> 00:39:05,530
talk to him.
You know when I'm talking to connor like

933
00:39:05,531 --> 00:39:08,920
before a fight,
I'm trying to find out what's going on

934
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,890
in the head of a guy who's going to
engage.

935
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,260
One of the most exciting things that I'm
going to see all year.

936
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,490
No,
you're not going on a morning show

937
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:15,650
going.

938
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,020
How about that cauliflower?
Huh?

939
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,640
How'd you get that?
Shut the fuck up.

940
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:23,170
But also I know,
but congress is a guy where he's crossed

941
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:25,300
over into pop culture.
He's such a big star now.

942
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,780
A tweet from him.
We'll hype the fight if I guarantee if

943
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:31,090
connor and Dana had conversation and Dan
was like,

944
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:32,710
all right man,
I understand it's a big fight cause you

945
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:34,450
gotta remember if you were to lose this
one,

946
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,990
now you're losing your golden boy.
The biggest star by far by far.

947
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,600
I also,
if he could just focus,

948
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:45,220
let's just let him focus a little bit.
Why I also feel like the magnitude of

949
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,800
this,
the dilemma that's in front of him and

950
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:51,310
Nate Diaz is also very apparent.
This is not a guy you can have ass.

951
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:56,670
And even if you are 100% ready,
you've never even fought him at 100% Oh,

952
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,450
you fought him when he had 11 days.

953
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,190
Notice what he'd been drinking in
Mexico.

954
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:04,480
I mean he poses typical matchup man.
And then you want to fly him on a plane.

955
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,700
Did anyone think,
man,

956
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,880
if you're looking at them with three
months away though,

957
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,120
okay,
but still connor's exhausted man from

958
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:14,470
doing all this stuff.
And also,

959
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,540
you know,
I see some fighters go,

960
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,290
it's our obligation to do these press
conscious slowly roll homie.

961
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,450
You're not conor Mcgregor press
conference.

962
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,190
That's,
it's a big difference.

963
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,180
And,
and,

964
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,650
and uh,
lost to him.

965
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,350
You're talking millions and,
and the UFC,

966
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,060
if I'm looking at as a businessman,
I go,

967
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,200
all right.
All right man.

968
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,790
He'll,
he's gonna do a press conference,

969
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:36,340
but we're going to come to him.
Did anyone think to do that?

970
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,900
Well,
first of all,

971
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:40,750
connor is one of the most charismatic
guys,

972
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,900
seriously of all time in all sports.
No doubt about it.

973
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,450
I mean,
he is a fucking marketing machine.

974
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,300
Like they're just the quotes and his
style.

975
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:51,730
His tweet player interrupt you,
but his tweet,

976
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,460
yeah.
Is the biggest tweet by an athlete this

977
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,890
year.
Beat Kobie Bryant's retirement tweet and

978
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:59,200
you want me to go do a fucking interview
for espn?

979
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,310
Well,
they don't know the sport.

980
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,380
Oh as well.
I watch ESPN every morning.

981
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,840
They were talking about Lebron James The
playoff game tonight.

982
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,480
They interrupted this shit with breaking
news cub out.

983
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:10,150
Connor's not retiring.
That's how big he is now.

984
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,770
The PR team at UFC could not get this.
They could not get this sort of

985
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,000
attention.
Even if they want to.

986
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:17,880
Connor can.
It's a different age,

987
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:19,340
man.
Those old interviews,

988
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,140
that old press conference,
you have a legit fucking superstar man

989
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,080
who makes more money than anyone dies.
Gates totally forgot what I was gonna

990
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,620
say.
Series points.

991
00:41:28,621 --> 00:41:29,160
Sorry brother.

992
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,780
It's okay.
Sometimes I just go now what you need

993
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,381
you,
you have a,

994
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:35,960
you have all good points are all valid
points and I get this contracts,

995
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:38,600
I get stuff like that,
but there has to be where you can't have

996
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:40,040
a pissing contest.
You can't say,

997
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:41,240
well,
we're going to run it like a business

998
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:42,320
this time.
And then not this time.

999
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:46,280
Cause it's good for the company with
conor Mcgregor and this big of a fight.

1000
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,040
If he wins this dude,
you know how much more money you're

1001
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:51,260
gonna make,
not the fucking press conference.

1002
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,490
He,
you're absolutely right that he's won

1003
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:58,510
the most charismatic guys of all time.
But Nate Diaz right now is God damn

1004
00:41:58,971 --> 00:42:00,640
gigantic and I think we're going to
reel.

1005
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,030
It was not as big.
It's kind of close,

1006
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,700
but he's God damn gigantic.
He's huge.

1007
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,390
And see what happens.
That's part of that fight.

1008
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:13,130
Part of that fight is that connor is
also fighting another mercurial

1009
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,170
superstar character.
I agree.

1010
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:17,750
Especially now after the first fight.
I agree Joe,

1011
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:20,840
but let's say connor doesn't fight at
UFC 200 and uh,

1012
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,720
let's say nate fights woodley or Robbie
lawler.

1013
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,120
Let me know how this rating scale fight
at one seven animals.

1014
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,780
Let's say at one 55,
let's say fights.

1015
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:33,050
Dos Anjos let me know how those ratings,
because here's where it won't be as

1016
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,030
close.
We might even be a quarter of it.

1017
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,580
I wonder,
it'd be close.

1018
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,260
Maybe half.
Well that's the power sense though.

1019
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,950
Maybe half half makes sense,
but half would still be pretty

1020
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:44,020
spectacular,
you know,

1021
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:46,810
at not even half.
I'm being generous when he left.

1022
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,650
Now he's the biggest,
there's no doubt about it.

1023
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:51,020
He's the Vegas.
Yeah.

1024
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:52,700
Well who knows?
It's all speculation.

1025
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:55,340
But here's what's interesting.
They offered the fight apparently to

1026
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:57,680
normal go madoff,
but he can't take it because it's only

1027
00:42:57,681 --> 00:43:00,630
four days after Ramadan.
Fuck.

1028
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,340
So he's very religious,
so he does that whole fascinating.

1029
00:43:04,341 --> 00:43:07,280
I had a buddy of mine,
my friend Concow alelee from back in

1030
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:08,960
Boston.
He used to do that shit.

1031
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,880
He would do that.
Um,

1032
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,680
he would fast when he was training.
It was crazy.

1033
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:16,720
You just,
you,

1034
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:20,100
you have certain rules where you're not
allowed to eat any what?

1035
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,740
How's it go?
You're not allowed to eat anything or

1036
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:23,360
drink any sun up sun down,
right?

1037
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,960
Yeah.
Do it.

1038
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:25,610
Yeah.
And you can't,

1039
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,640
there's no food or water.
Something Sunday,

1040
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,900
crazy at like 6:00 PM.
They have this feast,

1041
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,020
but it,
it can weaken you and so he'd be upset.

1042
00:43:33,021 --> 00:43:34,670
It would have a real,
it'd be a real problem if you had a

1043
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:36,050
fight.
Four or five rounds.

1044
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,940
I get it and I would love to see that
fight.

1045
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:42,650
Habibi Nigga Murdoch verse Nate Diaz.
He's such a beast,

1046
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:43,760
right?
He's phenomenal.

1047
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,090
Yeah.
To us who are balls deep in the UFC

1048
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:47,900
world.
Yes.

1049
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,561
No,
you're right.

1050
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:50,300
ESPN covering that fight.
Dude,

1051
00:43:50,301 --> 00:43:51,800
you should start a promotion.
Look at you.

1052
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:52,790
You're a goddamn promoter.

1053
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,200
You know how to do this.
I'm not.

1054
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:57,170
I've been through it and when I see a
guy like conor comes in once in a

1055
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:58,840
lifetime,
if you think there'd be another conor

1056
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:00,290
Mcgregor,
you're bat shit crazy.

1057
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,540
I think when we invest in arts,
the UFC,

1058
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:03,830
the keep going.
I think you're crazy.

1059
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,220
I think conor is a special dude and I
think there's a few other,

1060
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:09,230
I think Brock Lesnar was,
I think Rhonda has theirs.

1061
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:13,520
There's very few players.
Is it possible that this is a calculated

1062
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:18,350
gamble based on not thinking he has
enough time to prepare for nate?

1063
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,900
No,
I don't think some possible impulses is

1064
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:23,900
just,
this is just a matter of digging your

1065
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:27,290
heels into the ground and saying,
there's no,

1066
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,200
there's no way I can do this much proud
of percent.

1067
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,170
I think he's just like,
dude,

1068
00:44:30,171 --> 00:44:31,770
I'm exhausted.
You want on this world tour?

1069
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,240
Is it?
Can I please get ready for this?

1070
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,570
It's not the wwe man.
Go,

1071
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:36,721
go,
ask,

1072
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:40,500
go ask a major superstar Lebron and I
know you see you.

1073
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,270
It's not the same,
but Lebron,

1074
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:45,750
any of these guys,
these superstars in Sports Rinaldo gone.

1075
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:48,530
These world tours not get paid.
Sell the fight when like,

1076
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,240
and put my social media will cover way
more than this.

1077
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:53,940
Go Fuck Yourself.
But we have no one fighting like he,

1078
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,860
he can't say anything.
You say anything.

1079
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,000
Look,
you got pulled from the car.

1080
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:01,350
So more is not better is a certain
amount,

1081
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,930
a certain amount.
You do well at a certain amount.

1082
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:05,880
You're doing it for the UFC.
You're not doing it for the conor

1083
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:08,030
mcgregor brand.
You're not doing for the fighters brand.

1084
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:11,130
You think by him going to espn,
he's gonna get more followers.

1085
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:14,700
Would you think that there's like
there's certain consideration that

1086
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:18,840
looked like it looks good to have file a
fighters show up on espn.

1087
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,050
He's been there,
he's on,

1088
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,480
he's on breaking news.
He's,

1089
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:21,980
he's,
he's,

1090
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,970
he's been doing it maybe the week
before,

1091
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,220
do it.
But when he wants to prepare for a camp

1092
00:45:26,221 --> 00:45:29,670
and you have a guy of his magnitude
coming off a loss and he's like,

1093
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:32,280
man,
I really think doing all this press and

1094
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:34,560
all this stuff has fucked with my
capabilities to be a fight.

1095
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,960
I need to get back to that.
Will you please let me focus?

1096
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,280
It makes it very hype.
The fight.

1097
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,830
It totally makes sense.
Well you can't have exceptions.

1098
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,311
No,
no.

1099
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:43,650
Motherfucker,
you can cause you do make exceptions

1100
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,980
because you have certain people in the
UFC roster where they can't,

1101
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:48,540
you know what I'm saying?
Where they pick and choose when they

1102
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:50,340
fight or who they fight.
There are exceptions.

1103
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,130
Right.
And here's another thing to take into

1104
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,360
consideration.
One of the most important things that

1105
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:56,610
anybody,
any athlete does while they're in

1106
00:45:56,611 --> 00:45:58,080
training is get proper rest.

1107
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,310
It's one of the most important things.
And what fucks up when you go traveling

1108
00:46:02,311 --> 00:46:03,600
all the time.
Your rest.

1109
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,790
So number one thing that wrecks you,
you know,

1110
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,400
let me think how much you travel too.
I just,

1111
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,240
I just flew in from Seattle this
morning.

1112
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,970
I got up at five this morning,
flew here,

1113
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,220
got right off the plane and drove right
in here.

1114
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,210
Yeah,
that's,

1115
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,110
that's what happens,
man.

1116
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:17,400
You're,
your body gets a,

1117
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:19,650
your immune system gets jack from that.
So I'm good.

1118
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:22,220
I just think of the,
I think this is great for the sports,

1119
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:24,720
a good discussion to have because now
future superstars will say,

1120
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:25,531
all right,
I'm only doing this,

1121
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:27,540
may interviews this,
this much before the fight.

1122
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,910
Well maybe when all this and to happen,
maybe there's a debate.

1123
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,490
Maybe the debate could be held as to
like,

1124
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:35,010
what is the,
what's the amount that you need to do

1125
00:46:35,011 --> 00:46:37,860
once the amount that you should do,
you know,

1126
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,050
like what,
how do you have it set up and what would

1127
00:46:40,051 --> 00:46:42,120
be the,
what would be the best way for the

1128
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:43,500
performance of the athlete?

1129
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,510
The,
the consideration of their,

1130
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,720
their,
their time and focus to put 100% effort

1131
00:46:48,721 --> 00:46:52,410
into something and not leave anything on
the table because they really weren't

1132
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:55,170
rested enough cause we were or
distracted too much.

1133
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:56,880
Cause they're doing too much press.
But who's it,

1134
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,660
who's it helping the end?
The UFC and Dana white paper view.

1135
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:03,450
If they have pay per view buys and they
get a percentage of the buys and it

1136
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,010
helps,
it helps everyone.

1137
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,440
But if the fighter,
I mean it should be a direct,

1138
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,840
there's a direct,
if a fighter as a percentage of pay per

1139
00:47:09,841 --> 00:47:11,340
view,
which guy like conor does.

1140
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,190
Yes.
The more pay paper view deals or maybe

1141
00:47:14,191 --> 00:47:17,880
he does it a title fight.
We don't know what his deal is.

1142
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,770
So I'm talking about the for you buys
for sure.

1143
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:20,760
I would have smacked her.
Why?

1144
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,300
I would shown yes.
Um,

1145
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,700
but so the more press he does,
the more things get sold,

1146
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,350
the more money he makes.

1147
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:32,980
But in his point of view,
like tweets and things that he's doing

1148
00:47:32,981 --> 00:47:36,880
right now are getting more attention to
it than any of these stupid interview

1149
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,910
going to pay for this kind of publicity.
And you can't argue with that.

1150
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,270
That's absolutely true.
But the question is like where?

1151
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:44,730
Where,
you know,

1152
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:49,740
there should be like a contract and the
contract should state from x to y,

1153
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,580
you know,
pick a date and time.

1154
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,950
I would be left alone if you sought or
wants to get me.

1155
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:57,430
I'll be up in Iceland,
freezing my dick off thrown sidekicks,

1156
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,020
come get me.
I see.

1157
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:02,170
I think this whole thing is a misspeak
miscommunication.

1158
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,990
I see Dana side and I see connor side
right as a fight.

1159
00:48:04,991 --> 00:48:07,330
I definitely see connor side.
I think it's just a miscommunication.

1160
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:09,550
I think if before all this came out,
if conner was like,

1161
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:10,920
listen man,
I can't be doing all this fucking,

1162
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,370
I guarantee you have Dana was sitting
right.

1163
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:15,040
There would be no miscommunication.
I don't think.

1164
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,620
I don't think he would agree that it was
a miscue communication.

1165
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:20,140
I think he would say the connor just
doesn't want to do the press.

1166
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,230
And I just want to say what you gotta do
the press.

1167
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,470
And to me that's a miscommunication.
But can I get some miscommunications,

1168
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:27,640
a disagreement?
No,

1169
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:31,000
I disagree because I disagree.
And this is why Joe,

1170
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,100
because I think after,
after,

1171
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,470
even though we fought Aldo,
he expressed,

1172
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:35,931
dude,
I need,

1173
00:48:35,931 --> 00:48:37,840
she'll on these interviews,
he,

1174
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,740
he beats a nate diaz or he loses,
nate does again.

1175
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:42,161
He's like,
dude,

1176
00:48:42,161 --> 00:48:44,890
this fucking press is killing me.
So He's been voice in it.

1177
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:48,370
And I don't know if his camp has had the
discussion with Dana,

1178
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,230
but at some point maybe they haven't.
We don't know.

1179
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:54,640
Maybe this is totally speculation.
We would say this communication down and

1180
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:55,490
come up with a schedule.

1181
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:57,940
Like you've got to leave me alone for
eight weeks,

1182
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,110
but eat.
But what if,

1183
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,140
what if Dana and connor had a
conversation right now,

1184
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,960
man to man and Congos listen,
what I'll do,

1185
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,540
I'll film videos every day.
I'll do this,

1186
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:09,100
uh,
after my practices.

1187
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,230
I'll put all this social media out for
you guys.

1188
00:49:11,231 --> 00:49:14,440
Craig this fight,
no one has the pull that I do and I can

1189
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:16,930
create this many views for millions and
millions.

1190
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,120
No other fighter can,
don't pay me for it.

1191
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,940
Just don't make me travel.
You don't think Dana and the USC would

1192
00:49:21,941 --> 00:49:23,280
agree to any of this?
I bet.

1193
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,210
I bet they'd be open to it.
You know,

1194
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:26,800
it's interesting.
A Kevin Hart,

1195
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,660
he was like one of the biggest stars in
the world,

1196
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,920
one of the biggest,
uh,

1197
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,910
comedians ever as far as like sales and
volume,

1198
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,320
like not eight.
No one even close.

1199
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:36,520
I mean,
he crushes it.

1200
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,080
He sells out like,
what'd he say?

1201
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:41,560
Like 50,000 dateless soldier field.
It's nuts.

1202
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,960
Anyway,
that's not important.

1203
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:46,690
What's important is he's,
he,

1204
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,560
he's like gigantic on social media,
super active,

1205
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,680
and he does it all himself.
So if he does a movie,

1206
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,380
like he'll do a movie and they'll say,
oh great,

1207
00:49:56,381 --> 00:49:57,910
and you can use your,
you know,

1208
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:02,460
5.8 million social media followers and
a,

1209
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,940
it'll boost up the movie.
And it was like,

1210
00:50:03,941 --> 00:50:04,271
Whoa,
Whoa,

1211
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:04,631
whoa,
Whoa,

1212
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:06,070
whoa.
That's mine.

1213
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,270
That's mine.
No,

1214
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,390
if you want that.
Yup.

1215
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,060
And we've got to talk about that first
guy,

1216
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,430
dude.
They like that.

1217
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,460
All the people that were in those movie
meetings must be like,

1218
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,680
oh shit.
Because then the rock goes,

1219
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,880
Huh?
Yeah,

1220
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:23,881
because there's a giant difference
between a guy like the rock,

1221
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:29,030
like what he can do to sell a movie with
media and the average person,

1222
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,310
the average actor,
I mean he's,

1223
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,690
he's constantly on it.

1224
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:36,290
He has a dedicated loyal fan base
because he's really funny and self

1225
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:38,390
deprecating follows us,
works hard.

1226
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,130
So he's showing pictures of it.
Alarm clock,

1227
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:43,550
it says like four 15 in the morning and
he's up there fucking doing dead lifts.

1228
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,960
He's an animal,
right?

1229
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,470
So a guy like that,
that's a business on the side,

1230
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,820
that's his,
that's his,

1231
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:54,821
like he's got a hype business as well as
a business to promote himself,

1232
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:58,040
but he can also hype things,
you know,

1233
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:01,200
he's not a promotion once he gets some
money can be hard.

1234
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,380
When he does that,
I'm sure he's got it worked.

1235
00:51:03,381 --> 00:51:05,870
It was talking about it and it's got to
work to the movies now.

1236
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,651
So it's like,
Oh,

1237
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:10,220
if you want a part of the Kevin Hart
money machine that I put together,

1238
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:13,550
well you gotta give me something bitch.
Like she can't be any different.

1239
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,240
You're right,
you're right in that respect as as,

1240
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:19,190
as a superstar now not by fiber can pull
that card.

1241
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:24,230
You legitimately have to be able to sell
out giant stadiums and be a superstar.

1242
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,850
Yeah.
And he certainly can,

1243
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,890
especially if you give them the right
match ups,

1244
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,050
you know,
if you give connor the right match up at

1245
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:35,051
one 45 like I think honestly,
I mean I'm excited about this nate diaz

1246
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:38,450
fight cause I like watching them fight.
I like watching Nate Diaz fight.

1247
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,100
I like,
and I love the attention he's getting.

1248
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:42,470
But if I was,
if I was in connor's camp,

1249
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:45,650
I mean I understand that he's obsessed
and he wants to get right back at it.

1250
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:51,010
I would say go fight Frankie Edgar,
go fight Max Holloway.

1251
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,290
Have a rematch of Max Holloway.
That shit would be epic.

1252
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:57,280
I if all doe,
whoever Aldo does,

1253
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,280
you know,
they mix it all up.

1254
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:01,460
Fight a rematch with all dumb.
All those been talking mad shit about

1255
00:52:01,461 --> 00:52:02,450
him,
you know,

1256
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:06,830
I think although genuine and genuinely
believes that he fucked up and if he

1257
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:08,810
gets a hold of this dude this time he
get punished them,

1258
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:09,500
which is awesome.

1259
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,850
Fight and awesome stories.
I want to see it.

1260
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,600
I want to see homeowners can't think.
So sites are still gonna be there if he

1261
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:16,700
loses nate Diaz.
I think it takes some of the,

1262
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:19,880
it takes a lot of the star power already
got taken away.

1263
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,820
Too much of a risk.
It's just way too much power got taken

1264
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:23,870
away.
And that second fight,

1265
00:52:23,871 --> 00:52:25,550
not 100%,
not 100%,

1266
00:52:25,551 --> 00:52:27,810
he's still the biggest draw,
but he was uh,

1267
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:30,720
an assassin before that fight on two
span.

1268
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,440
There was many,
whether s there was something going on,

1269
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:36,560
like when he flatlined,
although with one punch and then did it,

1270
00:52:36,561 --> 00:52:39,350
like it was nothing and smiled and,
and I was talking to him in the

1271
00:52:39,351 --> 00:52:40,650
interview and he's just saying,
you know,

1272
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:42,680
no power,
just,

1273
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:44,350
just put it,
put it right where it's the nurse,

1274
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,320
anything like it.
Yeah,

1275
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:49,010
I mean the way he gobbled up the
pressure and the way he controlled the

1276
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:49,844
shit talking.

1277
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:50,780
This is the thing,
Joe,

1278
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:52,700
we've,
we've never had a guy of his

1279
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:55,970
capabilities and his mass appeal goat
man,

1280
00:52:55,971 --> 00:52:58,970
I don't want to do this like everyone
else has jumped through these hoops.

1281
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:00,380
I don't.
I want to fucking train,

1282
00:53:00,381 --> 00:53:01,370
man.
This is ridiculous.

1283
00:53:01,371 --> 00:53:03,950
I'm already big enough.
We've never had a guy really do this.

1284
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:07,310
He's also a guy where I think if he
wanted to,

1285
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,980
if he was involved with the UFC,
let's say Dana,

1286
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:11,390
which would never happen.
Cut Goes,

1287
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,560
go do what the fuck you.
I'm sick.

1288
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:15,650
You go do what you want.
He could sell out a giant arena in

1289
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:19,110
Dublin against dot 5,000 every Saturday.
That's how powerful he is.

1290
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,560
That's what I think literally making
just make more and more money.

1291
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,660
Well,
I don't know about that because I think

1292
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:26,850
part of the excitement about was
building up to that Aldo fight.

1293
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:30,930
That was part of the man who would be
king story was that he was going to

1294
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:34,170
fight the longtime king and when he flat
lined the longtime king,

1295
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,890
he reached this level of legendary
popularity.

1296
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,970
There does that.
It happens once in a hundred generations

1297
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:43,700
when it comes with fighters.
There's this,

1298
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,840
there's this moment,
this boom,

1299
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,040
how many guys reached that moment?
Like when he flatlined Alto with one

1300
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:53,280
punch and then it was in 13 seconds of
the whole world was like,

1301
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,190
he fucking did it.
The answer is none did it?

1302
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,700
Yes.
It's fucking crazy.

1303
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:58,290
Yeah,
that was epic.

1304
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:03,390
But the lustre gets taken off by the
Nate Diaz fight and if he loses to nate

1305
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:05,730
Diaz,
he's got a very good point that,

1306
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,970
you know,
he can't lose because he wasn't given

1307
00:54:08,971 --> 00:54:11,940
the right amount of opportunity to,
to present or to,

1308
00:54:11,941 --> 00:54:13,860
um,
to prepare himself because he had to do

1309
00:54:13,861 --> 00:54:14,970
all this prep.
Like right now,

1310
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:18,270
the economy,
Greg Fan base and guys hugging his nuts,

1311
00:54:18,271 --> 00:54:20,520
which I might be one of them,
but he,

1312
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,860
you know,
they're going well you know nate Diaz,

1313
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:25,350
it's way bigger and he kind of caught
him off guard.

1314
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:26,520
Well,
all that good and there's a little

1315
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:28,440
asterisk I guess if you're this conor
guy,

1316
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:33,000
well now if he loses again,
there's no more excuses because the fuck

1317
00:54:33,001 --> 00:54:35,220
there's no asterik.
Nate had 11 nights.

1318
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:36,780
I'm saying it.
You could,

1319
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,610
you know what I'm saying?
I'm not saying there isn't h straight up

1320
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:41,730
beat him with 11 days preparing,
sipping corona's on a boat and came and

1321
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:43,590
whooped his ass.
I thought [inaudible] was going to beat

1322
00:54:43,591 --> 00:54:48,591
him just by first of all the size and
length and deceptive boxing skills.

1323
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,460
That's what I thought.
I was like,

1324
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:55,350
this is going to be the first guy that
connor's ever fought that's been in wars

1325
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,490
with like a legends.
I mean he's been in there with a lot of

1326
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:04,470
fucking super high level dudes.
He's a monster and like this is a big,

1327
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:06,510
big fight and this is not a fight you
want to take.

1328
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:09,840
Even if he's not ready on 11 days notice
you've got to get ready for this dude.

1329
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,330
And his Jiu Jitsu is off the chain.
Man,

1330
00:55:12,331 --> 00:55:16,300
his Jujitsu is at a super high level.
He's in x bigger than comment.

1331
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:19,590
There couldn't be a worse match up right
bars with Andre Ward,

1332
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,390
world champion and Joe showing on a
regular basis.

1333
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:25,440
And his brother Nick.
I know Gilbert Melendez,

1334
00:55:25,441 --> 00:55:27,180
Jace Shield,
no joke,

1335
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,400
no joke.
Dangerous fucking fight,

1336
00:55:29,401 --> 00:55:29,911
man.
Whore.

1337
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:32,110
What's stressing me out?
I was fucking with Adrian,

1338
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:35,370
the guy who we're not talking about and
all this is nate Diaz.

1339
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:38,480
Cause even though if Nate Diaz and you
guys can say whatever you want,

1340
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,800
you'll see 200 still going to be dope.
I get that.

1341
00:55:40,801 --> 00:55:43,260
That's all fun and Dandy for the f the
absolute fans.

1342
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,720
If there's no connor,
nate doesn't make the same pay day.

1343
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,430
So he gets fucked man.
You're right.

1344
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:50,190
And I want to see a guy like the dues
that nate has paid.

1345
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:53,160
And remember the Diaz brothers were the
first guys to go.

1346
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,930
Not Fuck that man.
I don't think it should be done that

1347
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:56,910
way.
And you've got appreciate that man in a,

1348
00:55:56,911 --> 00:56:00,080
in a land full of fucking sheep.
They were the first kind of wolves go,

1349
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:00,990
no,
fuck that man.

1350
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:03,810
This ain't right.
Well they're also the first guys to put

1351
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,470
a ridiculous emphasis on extreme cardio.
Yes.

1352
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,130
And it shows in their style.
Yeah.

1353
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:14,070
I mean like nick doing marathons and
triathlons and a,

1354
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:15,210
I was,
it's funny,

1355
00:56:15,211 --> 00:56:17,340
I,
I keep quoting this and nick corrected

1356
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:20,280
me the other day.
I said that he swam back from Alcatraz

1357
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:22,440
twice.
He just corrected me the other day.

1358
00:56:22,441 --> 00:56:24,100
It was five.
Now it's fucking

1359
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,240
nuts.
Times he swam from Alcatraz to the

1360
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:30,730
fucking mainland.
They didn't think you could do that.

1361
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,610
They didn't think it was possible.
That's why they put a prison there.

1362
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,470
Cause they didn't think people could
swim.

1363
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:39,420
This motherfucker is a stoner and an
athlete.

1364
00:56:39,421 --> 00:56:41,140
He's not even a prisoner.
Oh fucking let,

1365
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,540
don't lock that dude.
I'm going to swim right the fuck out.

1366
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:46,000
He Oh,
creepy on a bunch of guys like him in

1367
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:49,070
prison.
But how crazy are people these days do

1368
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:52,540
be doing things for recreation gun.
The only,

1369
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:57,320
the only guy who could bring nate Diaz
money is George Saint Pierre Grc pr.

1370
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:00,970
I think we might begin honey Dick,
if George Saint Pierre does happen just

1371
00:57:00,971 --> 00:57:03,370
shell up at UFC 200 it's like,
wait a sec.

1372
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,490
Well,
George has openly said that he wants to

1373
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:08,740
go through a camp and decide whether or
not he could do it.

1374
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:10,090
At the end of it,
he's done it.

1375
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,340
Did he go through the,
the prep camp?

1376
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,930
That's what I heard.
When did you hear this?

1377
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:15,850
You got the inside scoop.
Dot.

1378
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,220
I mean,
I know he's been training a shit load

1379
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,210
and I know he doesn't care about belts
or anything.

1380
00:57:20,211 --> 00:57:22,240
He just wants to take the fight.
You know what the holdup is?

1381
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,260
Why Reebok?

1382
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,600
That's awful.

1383
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:27,660
Okay.

1384
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,210
Oh well you're George Saint Pierre
sponsored by under armour.

1385
00:57:30,211 --> 00:57:32,550
And then how many fights do you have?
And Reebok's and were like,

1386
00:57:32,551 --> 00:57:33,900
yeah,
here's whatever,

1387
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:36,150
50 grand where these reebok pumps.
He's like,

1388
00:57:36,151 --> 00:57:37,450
what the fuck?
No Man,

1389
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:40,500
I'm George Saint Pierre.
So he's saying either the USC has to

1390
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:43,620
make up for it in his purse or reebok
has make up for it.

1391
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,660
So I think it's a money thing right now.
Really?

1392
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,480
That's what you hear.
Is this the inside scoop?

1393
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,850
I don't know.
I think we just scooped a shit out of

1394
00:57:50,851 --> 00:57:52,470
this hell.
That's what I hear.

1395
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,930
Well,
I've been hearing rumblings of

1396
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:57,180
negotiations,
but uh,

1397
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:59,160
you know,
it's one of those things you don't want

1398
00:57:59,161 --> 00:58:00,600
to hope.
You want to just wait.

1399
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:03,030
But also I was the only guy you can save
the card.

1400
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,300
Well he would,
he would most certainly save the card.

1401
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,080
Oh my God.
You know,

1402
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:12,480
it would be crazy.
Would be him and connor.

1403
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:18,170
I mean that's fucking that Tammy Connor
Madison Square Garden to what you would,

1404
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,690
it was not enough seats there.
No,

1405
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:24,830
there'd be full of just fucking GSP
versus it looked like the Oscars is just

1406
00:58:24,831 --> 00:58:27,750
be as crowded full of celebrities.
Regular folk can afford the tickets,

1407
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:32,750
especially if you get angry GSP GSP that
wanted to punish Bj Penn GSP.

1408
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,630
I think it's really tough to bring him
out.

1409
00:58:35,631 --> 00:58:38,760
But you didn't like about rush.
Yeah.

1410
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:39,613
Yeah man.
Yeah.

1411
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,910
He was a motherfucker.
Oh,

1412
00:58:40,911 --> 00:58:45,140
GSP was one of the weirder guys because
he was such a nice guy.

1413
00:58:45,141 --> 00:58:47,930
At all times,
but when guys fucked with him,

1414
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,380
there was this,
this switch that would go off in that

1415
00:58:51,381 --> 00:58:55,280
head and he would go on seek and destroy
mode and he was so good at it.

1416
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,180
Man,
when he fucked up,

1417
00:58:56,181 --> 00:58:58,910
Bj fucked up Fitch,
you,

1418
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,140
you wash those fights and you just go,
that is arguably the greatest

1419
00:59:03,141 --> 00:59:04,190
welterweight of all time.

1420
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,730
I agree.
That mean his ability to mix up the

1421
00:59:07,731 --> 00:59:10,250
strikes and the takedowns.
We never knew what the fuck was going

1422
00:59:10,251 --> 00:59:11,030
on.
His,

1423
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:14,540
his constant victories in a scrambles,
you know,

1424
00:59:14,541 --> 00:59:17,360
and the Bj fight to where he was
punishing Bj,

1425
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,280
he wanted to punish him.
And when he,

1426
00:59:19,281 --> 00:59:21,860
when he beat him down,
it didn't stop them and then walked over

1427
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:24,290
to the wall and fucking punched it
afterwards.

1428
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,630
That's the mother like,
whoa.

1429
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:31,090
Now does he come back or do we get that
that safe GSP cause a safe GSP verse

1430
00:59:31,191 --> 00:59:31,810
condom?
We're not,

1431
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,320
I'm not trying to see that.
There's a lot,

1432
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,870
there's a long time gone.
Who knows?

1433
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,750
Who knows where G we're talking about
GSP and Bj.

1434
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,790
Bj Penn's coming back to,
yeah.

1435
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:43,940
Well I'm a,
I'm excited to see what that looks like.

1436
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:48,110
BJ's fight and Dennis seaver and he's
been at Jackson Winkeljohn his camp for

1437
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:49,010
quite a while now.

1438
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:52,430
And so I'm assuming they're not letting
him cut any corners.

1439
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,260
Uh,
not really running them through the real

1440
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:56,170
paces.
If you're at Jackson's,

1441
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,950
there's no cutting corners.
If you do your skin,

1442
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,290
you're asked molly walked in and you
wouldn't be there that long.

1443
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,420
Right.
And get back on a plane,

1444
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,420
go home.
And why would he,

1445
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,330
I mean he's been living out there for
quite a while now.

1446
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,940
Hawaii down mccurdy Gee,
that'd be pretty legit.

1447
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:10,160
GSP Negotiating Uba,
UFC return.

1448
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:12,170
But Reebok deal consider considers road
blocker.

1449
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,960
There's a story.
Mm hmm.

1450
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,370
Yeah man.
I Dunno.

1451
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:20,990
Just this whole thing bums me out.
It's complicated.

1452
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:21,950
Yeah,
we'll see.

1453
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,300
We'll see what happens.
But man,

1454
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:26,570
hope becomes,
it would be the 200 to end it if you

1455
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:28,560
think you saved for from asking square
guy and fucked too.

1456
01:00:28,561 --> 01:00:31,730
Do you think that would be nate versus
GSP of Connor doesn't do the car,

1457
01:00:31,731 --> 01:00:33,290
so connor's not on the card anymore.

1458
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,670
He's off today.
He said,

1459
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:36,440
I'm down to fight.
He even goes,

1460
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,600
I will fly to New York and do a press
conference,

1461
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:41,210
but then I got to go back.
So he's given a little wiggle room.

1462
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:46,190
I think it's time to drop the egos.
Come to agreement and save 200 let conor

1463
01:00:46,191 --> 01:00:46,641
fight.
Nate.

1464
01:00:46,641 --> 01:00:48,950
We've is Brennan shop the reasonable
one.

1465
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:53,660
How is this possible to the houses
fossil Kenogenic Diet?

1466
01:00:53,661 --> 01:00:56,030
Kido kid?
I was super positive.

1467
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,990
Super clear mind.
I like everyone.

1468
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,290
All right.
Set Dana Tax.

1469
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:04,440
Yeah man,
it's,

1470
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,440
it'd be interesting.
It'd be interesting.

1471
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:08,450
We'll see if he could work it out.
I hope so.

1472
01:01:08,451 --> 01:01:11,210
Man will say it's fun guy,
man.

1473
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:12,770
It's,
it's made it fun though.

1474
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,750
Stylists,
tapings,

1475
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:18,080
publicity holistically that slap on her
wrist form so I could fight for him.

1476
01:01:18,081 --> 01:01:19,100
I'm happy for nate.
Like,

1477
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:20,630
I like both guys.
I'm happy for nate.

1478
01:01:20,631 --> 01:01:21,950
He gets,
he's finally getting the credit he

1479
01:01:21,951 --> 01:01:23,600
deserves coming out of his brother's
shadow.

1480
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,170
Like we want this man to be announced to
be determined.

1481
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,180
That is the,
the big fight.

1482
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,240
See that?
Rest of the car.

1483
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,660
Don't get me wrong.
There's some phenomenal,

1484
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,950
are you kidding me?
Phenomenal fight.

1485
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,480
It's an amazing car.
Look at this.

1486
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:37,550
Look what's on the card here.
First of all,

1487
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:41,660
although versus Edgar,
I can't wait for that.

1488
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,600
I can't wait for that.
I want to see what frankie can do now.

1489
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:48,080
The new and improved frank and me too
and then although I feel like it's

1490
01:01:48,081 --> 01:01:50,600
declined a little bit.
I think the Chad Mendez fight,

1491
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:53,660
the second fight,
he didn't look as good as he had looked

1492
01:01:53,661 --> 01:01:56,440
in the past and then obviously he's
coming off of a big loss.

1493
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,520
My favorite fighter of all time.
It's a great fight.

1494
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:01,670
And Tate versus Nunez.
Come on son.

1495
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:02,930
She's needle mover,
right?

1496
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:05,210
Yeah.
It's a fun one needle mover in my mind.

1497
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:10,630
My needle's moving right now.
Might need aligns Moose for tate in my

1498
01:02:10,731 --> 01:02:11,590
mind and my,
yeah,

1499
01:02:11,591 --> 01:02:12,260
no,
that's what I'm saying.

1500
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,480
That's more time.
Okay,

1501
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,280
so that's a good fight.
That's a very good fight.

1502
01:02:16,281 --> 01:02:19,040
Nunez is super dangerous,
especially in the early rounds.

1503
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:20,940
Yeah.
She tends to tire a little bit.

1504
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:22,890
She tends to tire Lou.
She blows it out,

1505
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,170
but God damn,
she's got some pop.

1506
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:28,350
You've got a serious right hand,
real dangerous Moy Tai.

1507
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,630
Then you got travis versus cats,
a motherfucker,

1508
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,530
the heavyweight.
And that's a motherfucker.

1509
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,150
Damn.
That's interesting.

1510
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:39,420
The thing to me with cane,
it's like at what point all these

1511
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:42,180
injuries and him come back.
At what point do we see him age?

1512
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,100
Like we've seen Rashad,
right.

1513
01:02:45,101 --> 01:02:47,070
Come after amenities.
Rashad doesn't look the same.

1514
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,630
There's sometimes when guys come back
you're like,

1515
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,400
oh fuck,
that's not the same guy anymore.

1516
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,580
At what point do we see k not come back?
It's true,

1517
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,990
but keynes,
a mother fucker,

1518
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:56,430
if he does come back,
good luck.

1519
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,500
But again,
stylistic wise,

1520
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:01,080
Travis Brown's up,
motherfucker form great takedown

1521
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:03,480
defense,
obviously great at striking and he's

1522
01:03:03,481 --> 01:03:06,350
huge.
He's a big boy too.

1523
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:10,560
Very fast.
Very good striking long wide base.

1524
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:13,200
Good footwork and movement.
It's hard.

1525
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,530
That's a good fight to really didn't
think he looked great in the material

1526
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:18,750
and fight.
No,

1527
01:03:18,751 --> 01:03:20,880
that wasn't the best fight for him.
Uh,

1528
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:22,400
but neither was the,
um,

1529
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:25,710
they're all osteophyte.
That was a more disappointing fight I

1530
01:03:25,711 --> 01:03:27,100
think when he got knocked out.
Yeah.

1531
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,250
But it was also even the trash brown
one,

1532
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,950
it went down.
But even in the mitre owned one,

1533
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:33,720
cause we saw them for longer rounds.
I was like,

1534
01:03:33,721 --> 01:03:35,490
Nah,
like crazy.

1535
01:03:35,491 --> 01:03:37,170
And then you get a guy like Cain,
man,

1536
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:39,840
you're talking about a different
motherfucker to Travis Browne mature on

1537
01:03:39,841 --> 01:03:41,430
fire,
which is so unfortunate because the AI

1538
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,273
pokes.

1539
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:43,560
I agree.
So fucking,

1540
01:03:43,561 --> 01:03:44,970
and that was doing well in the first
round.

1541
01:03:44,971 --> 01:03:46,380
Then we got poked in the eye.
It was a little tough.

1542
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:49,380
It was bad man.
Ms. I was horrible the way they handled

1543
01:03:49,381 --> 01:03:50,730
that whole thing.
Fucked Matt.

1544
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,290
Yeah,
well he's got a lawsuit,

1545
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:54,570
doesn't he?
Fire suit and you should.

1546
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,030
But again,
that's just kind of let you know how

1547
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,240
fight even goes down if they go three
rounds that,

1548
01:03:58,241 --> 01:04:00,870
I'm not saying Matt with a one that
travis definitely won the fight.

1549
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,030
That was a great fight up until that
moment.

1550
01:04:03,031 --> 01:04:04,980
But whenever a guy gets poked in the
eye,

1551
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,830
like the outcome is marred and when
you're fighting a monster with one eye,

1552
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,780
it's going to be a tough fucking night.
Yeah.

1553
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,030
But I tell you why I,
I don't mind.

1554
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,910
Traps is shot here against cane.
I don't think he's that big of an

1555
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:17,490
underdog and if he is,
I don't know what the odds are but I

1556
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:19,740
mean travis has that one punch knockout
power knees.

1557
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,693
Yeah,
it's,

1558
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,700
we really don't know how much,
like you said,

1559
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:26,100
of a toll.
All these injuries have taken on cane

1560
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:29,570
and the time off me,
we only saw him that one fight with vre

1561
01:04:29,571 --> 01:04:34,530
doom where we blamed it and he did as
well on the lack of training at

1562
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:36,480
altitude,
which makes side of my face right now.

1563
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:37,650
You don't,
you don't buy it.

1564
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,580
Fuck no,
that's we in it.

1565
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:40,260
It's fine.
It's,

1566
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,840
you don't get to his level and be like,
oh altitude.

1567
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,960
I got tired cause out dude bitch you
knew for four months when we find out

1568
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:48,450
that altitude,
but he's here for his cardio.

1569
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:51,190
Maybe just overestimated his own cardio.
Is that Paul?

1570
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,560
I don't think anyone in his camp was
like,

1571
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:53,670
yeah,
that's pretty high up there.

1572
01:04:53,671 --> 01:04:56,010
We should probably go where Javier said
that it was his fault.

1573
01:04:56,011 --> 01:04:57,570
He said,
I should have forced him to go early.

1574
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:00,110
You know,
sometimes guys just don't want to leave.

1575
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:01,710
He just got beat by the other guy,
man.

1576
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,780
It could be that don't buy that shit.
Could be that too.

1577
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,810
He definitely looked tired,
but he the greatest of all time,

1578
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:09,090
100% just had an off night.
Well,

1579
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:13,170
verdomme is a big dude.
He's tall and long and he's striking has

1580
01:05:13,171 --> 01:05:16,530
come a long way in his Jujitsu is the
best in the business.

1581
01:05:16,531 --> 01:05:19,570
He's also browsers up for Cain.
I used to tell his teacher wise,

1582
01:05:19,571 --> 01:05:21,190
he's a bad match.
You take them,

1583
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:22,121
hey,
take them down.

1584
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:23,890
You got to get strangled.
Good luck with that.

1585
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:25,390
And he's also not going to knock him
out.

1586
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:28,120
So he gets [inaudible] and virgin can
jump to guard,

1587
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:29,460
jump half guard.
It's a fuck it.

1588
01:05:29,461 --> 01:05:31,600
It's a horrible matchup for him.
So yeah,

1589
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:32,820
he lost two gears.
Yeah,

1590
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:35,500
I'm really bummed out that we didn't get
a chance to see the rematch.

1591
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:38,230
I really wanted to see that rematch.
We're going to see it after this.

1592
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:39,001
Maybe.
Yeah,

1593
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,940
maybe it's a bit funny nose.
I agree.

1594
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,940
Maybe it's a huge,
this is a huge,

1595
01:05:42,941 --> 01:05:45,170
maybe huge maybe.
And you know what man,

1596
01:05:45,171 --> 01:05:48,010
when I saw that fight,
tough fight for Kane and Steve Bay's a

1597
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:49,570
tough fight for anybody.
Man.

1598
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:54,280
Steve Bay is gonna fight for doom.
That's a tough fight for [inaudible].

1599
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:58,380
Steve Bay's No fucking joke man.
He's no joke him and yeah,

1600
01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:59,283
no joke.
They,

1601
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,570
that the odds are stacked against them
flying down to Brazil and fighting Berdo

1602
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,860
yeah,
the odds are stats,

1603
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:06,820
a tough place to fight.
But he's a geared up dude.

1604
01:06:06,821 --> 01:06:09,490
He's ready to rock and you know,
coming off of that big one,

1605
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:12,130
punch knockout of overeem or of um,
uh,

1606
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:14,650
Orlowski he looked good in that fight
and you look great,

1607
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:15,940
you look good.
And he looked angry.

1608
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,140
He's got momentum behind him.
I'm looking forward to seeing and he

1609
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:22,960
will go to war.
We saw that in that five round fight

1610
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:25,630
with Dosantos jds.
I mean he,

1611
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:29,200
he took junior dos Santos to the edge.
That was a fun fight.

1612
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:31,720
That was a wild ass fight.
Fight could've went either way.

1613
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,600
It could have went either way.
So I think that he's right up there and

1614
01:06:34,601 --> 01:06:36,040
I think that's a really interesting
fight.

1615
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:39,510
I'm looking forward to see you in that,
but put up that Cardigan because a,

1616
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,110
there was some other shit we weren't to
talk about.

1617
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:45,510
Look at this one.
We're saucy and Brunson people didn't

1618
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,710
bring that up.
Your boy hendricks and need to win so

1619
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:49,180
bad.
God does.

1620
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,760
He does.
And that's a tough fight to men.

1621
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:56,770
Kelvin is a good are becoming out.
I'm guns blazing cause he lost a magnate

1622
01:06:56,771 --> 01:07:01,771
last time and then also hendrix getting
stopped by wonderboy is going to charge

1623
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:03,543
Kelvin up.

1624
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,370
True
too man.

1625
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:10,090
He's very fleet of foot.
You know,

1626
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,900
he's got excellent footwork and tough
matchup.

1627
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:16,330
Real light on his feet.
Fucking johnny comes with his aide game.

1628
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,000
It's a rough night for Kelvin,
I think yacht.

1629
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:20,980
Well it could be or who knows,
man.

1630
01:07:20,981 --> 01:07:25,930
Calvin could realize that he's got to
bring it up to 10 constantly in camp and

1631
01:07:25,931 --> 01:07:29,170
reach his full potential and that this
is an opportunity to really erase the

1632
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:32,740
magnet fight and to get a victory over a
former world champion.

1633
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:35,230
I mean that's gigantic.
Look at this.

1634
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:38,440
You got Diego Sanchez and Joe lows at
that throwback son.

1635
01:07:38,441 --> 01:07:40,280
We call that throwback Thursday match
up.

1636
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:44,620
This is the better fucking clean the
canvas special.

1637
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:47,450
I agree to be some blood in this fight.
Okay.

1638
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,910
Early,
early too.

1639
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:51,550
So all those other guys are gonna have
to walk around that glut.

1640
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,280
I used to hate that when there's a
bloody fight before and there'd be blood

1641
01:07:54,281 --> 01:07:57,820
on the mat and you know when you're,
when you first get any take that flap

1642
01:07:57,821 --> 01:07:59,530
around the outcome.
God Damn it.

1643
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:01,420
We know what they do during the Fox
fights.

1644
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,830
They spray paint over the blood type
move like Grace Gross.

1645
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:09,700
We're sitting there doing the commentary
and talking about some stuff and they're

1646
01:08:09,701 --> 01:08:14,701
spraying like full bore paint booth,
like doing a Chevelle 10 feet

1647
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,090
from us.
I'm not,

1648
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,490
I'm not exaggerating,
that's like that bloodsport when there's

1649
01:08:19,491 --> 01:08:22,520
blood he's like scraping the mat and
then the next day comes out,

1650
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:23,900
dude,
they spray painted,

1651
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:26,940
they walk around and spray paint over
the blood and you're like,

1652
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,200
are you fucking shitting me?
And everybody like the,

1653
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:32,150
the,
the camera guys are covering their faces

1654
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:34,550
with shirts and feel like in a way
better solution.

1655
01:08:34,551 --> 01:08:39,440
It's probably illegal masks on and stuff
for that shit.

1656
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:43,400
You can't just blow it and can hound
fucking is 15,000 people sit in the

1657
01:08:43,401 --> 01:08:43,911
audience.
They're like,

1658
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,040
well,
what's really important is we deny what

1659
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:49,160
we're involved with.
That is a little spray paint on this

1660
01:08:49,161 --> 01:08:50,630
blood.
We don't want to assume your blood

1661
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:53,630
blood's inside of everybody.
We need blood to stay alive.

1662
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:56,330
Sometimes he's a bloody business,
but we don't want to look at it.

1663
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:57,500
That is weird.
Yeah.

1664
01:08:57,501 --> 01:08:59,090
They're like airbrushing nipples over
there.

1665
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,340
Stop it.
Stop it.

1666
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:04,900
Did you say that's only on Fox or on
paper view or it happens all the toe.

1667
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:07,410
It's only on Fox.
They would never do it on paper.

1668
01:09:07,411 --> 01:09:10,250
You the UFC knows exactly what it's
selling for sure.

1669
01:09:10,251 --> 01:09:12,020
Yeah.
They're not scared of blood.

1670
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:14,270
Matter of fact,
some people like it shouldn't be scared

1671
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:15,104
of it either.
Man.

1672
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:19,550
What's going to happen?
You got in bed with the most exciting

1673
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:21,190
sport in the fucking world.
It's happened,

1674
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,880
so give it a blood.
Don't worry about it.

1675
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,670
And during Fox fights,
I'm not supposed to talk about blood.

1676
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:27,350
His mom's supposed to take it down a
notch.

1677
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:29,940
I was supposed to non-manager.
I feel like they fucked up town.

1678
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:34,580
You
see there's a little thing you mean?

1679
01:09:34,581 --> 01:09:35,414
He goes,
yeah,

1680
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:38,540
I fucking go.
Well I shouldn't.

1681
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:41,600
I mean there's no need to exaggerate it
and there's no need to dwell on it.

1682
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,410
But if it's overwhelming,
what if it's over one guys like that

1683
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,660
blood's fucking crazy.
Also,

1684
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:51,440
the descriptives that I,
this is what I believe to descriptives

1685
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:56,420
that I use during a fight half to match
how I feel about the moment that gives

1686
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:59,120
me,
I'm giving a bear better narrative of

1687
01:09:59,121 --> 01:10:02,570
what I think is going on in a fight.
When I see Diego Sanchez face hanging

1688
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:05,810
off of his head as he's chasing after
Martin Kampmann.

1689
01:10:05,811 --> 01:10:07,610
And I say,
this looks like a scene from a horror

1690
01:10:07,611 --> 01:10:09,710
movie.
That's cause that's what it really feels

1691
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:11,210
like to me.
And if I don't say that,

1692
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,120
it's probably not,
I'm not doing my job as what you're

1693
01:10:14,121 --> 01:10:15,470
doing.
The fans at this service.

1694
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,480
You'd also not,
I mean,

1695
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,110
that's why we love listening to Joe
Rogan.

1696
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:22,110
If you start [inaudible] boxes and want
to know you're going to do it because

1697
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,920
that's how you get to do it.
Going to wear a condom.

1698
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,200
Everybody said,
Joe,

1699
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:34,550
we need you to Tuxedo in a condo.
We have,

1700
01:10:34,551 --> 01:10:38,010
we bought our Fox condom.
They,

1701
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:40,190
he's looking at in,
this is not on but not anti Fox.

1702
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:42,650
I'd love that day of the UFC on,
I think it's amazing.

1703
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,180
It's great for this.
I just think you've gotta stop.

1704
01:10:44,181 --> 01:10:45,140
Spray Peyton.
Me,

1705
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:47,920
stop making me read that Shit.
Come on.

1706
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:49,640
The poor camera guys.
Camera guys.

1707
01:10:49,641 --> 01:10:51,080
Five feet in front of me.
He's taking,

1708
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:53,410
he's taking it right in the face.
Yeah,

1709
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,220
man.
Uh,

1710
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,120
he's coming.
No.

1711
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,000
Why would the lawsuits come?
Nobody.

1712
01:10:59,001 --> 01:11:00,890
10 years.
If someone's fucking prove it,

1713
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:03,980
just don't do it anymore.
Just don't do it anymore.

1714
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,530
You can't do it like that in elementary.
I remember when the kid threw up and

1715
01:11:06,531 --> 01:11:09,240
then that weird janitor came with that
orange substance.

1716
01:11:09,241 --> 01:11:10,160
It was like,
whatever.

1717
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,040
It's really shit the rest of the day.
I guarantee you there's health codes.

1718
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:18,360
I guarantee you,
you can't just spray paint in a room

1719
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:22,140
filled with people with no ventilation.
No one seemed bloodsport die or some

1720
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:25,830
fucking dude just goes out there between
the rounds and scrubs the mat out it.

1721
01:11:25,831 --> 01:11:28,050
That's not good for the crowd.
The crowd is want to see that?

1722
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,390
Fuck the crowd right now,
dude.

1723
01:11:30,391 --> 01:11:33,030
In that they're frauds though.
And you start spray paint and the matte

1724
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,133
watching it.
They did.

1725
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,140
They didn't put up a curtain.
What's going on behind the curtain?

1726
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:39,450
I no one knows.
What's that smell?

1727
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,470
We have no idea.
Fucking gray smoke is in the air of

1728
01:11:43,471 --> 01:11:46,130
what's coffin fighters like we were
calling.

1729
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:50,340
I actually got away from the desk.
I put my headphones down and I backed

1730
01:11:50,341 --> 01:11:51,270
away from the desk.
I'm like,

1731
01:11:51,271 --> 01:11:53,550
what the fuck man,
I'm healthy bitch.

1732
01:11:53,551 --> 01:11:58,551
I'm the Kido kid out of a bitch.
Fuck you dude.

1733
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,930
You don't think they'd get higher like
some,

1734
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:03,680
I don't know,
former flight or with fucking cte?

1735
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:06,180
Just a scrub the man.
And when he comes out everyone goes,

1736
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:08,640
yeah,
he's a celebrity.

1737
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:12,240
Plenty of sponsors on a shirt and shit.
And he's scrubbing the mat.

1738
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:15,210
This is like a Ben Stiller's character
in that movie.

1739
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,610
Tropic Thunder.
Like,

1740
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,920
like you could see you having played a
guy like this.

1741
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:22,800
Sure man.
Shit has gone bad.

1742
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:28,830
That's awful cute magic had former
fighters cleaning the octagon and waving

1743
01:12:28,831 --> 01:12:30,270
to the crowd.
Broken hands.

1744
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,940
Oh my God.
Holy.

1745
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:34,980
Is that Juni Browning scrubbing the mat?
It sure is.

1746
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:36,550
It sure is.
Yeah.

1747
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:41,340
There's certain things that we will,
we have to maintain a certain level of

1748
01:12:41,341 --> 01:12:42,630
empathy.
Oh,

1749
01:12:42,631 --> 01:12:43,750
for sure.
I'm hair.

1750
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:46,320
Just like certain people can't have that
job.

1751
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:47,131
No,
no.

1752
01:12:47,131 --> 01:12:48,630
Once you're an all time great,
you cannot,

1753
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,280
oh no,
he can't do that.

1754
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:53,700
He came in to interview for the job.
I can't have you be could do it if you

1755
01:12:53,701 --> 01:12:55,680
want it to though.
Like if everybody knew,

1756
01:12:55,681 --> 01:12:56,514
he wrote,
okay,

1757
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:01,540
what if you're like a super fan?
Like if Randy coture decided in between

1758
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:04,020
fights,
he was going to help squat,

1759
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,160
you know,
scrub the mats on.

1760
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,240
He looked up at everybody and he waved
and Randy's and great health.

1761
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:10,300
You know,
I looked at everybody,

1762
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:12,990
wave to everybody and then got down and
showed everybody,

1763
01:13:12,991 --> 01:13:15,240
hey,
he's not too big to cleaning the blood.

1764
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:18,720
He could do it if he wanted to do,
people would start crying in the stance.

1765
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:19,690
I no,
no,

1766
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:25,440
no.
His overalls on knee pads start

1767
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,540
scrubbing the mat.
Shit.

1768
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,090
But what I'm saying is he's still
successful right now.

1769
01:13:30,091 --> 01:13:32,970
It's not like he's down in the dumps and
everybody knows he's doing movies.

1770
01:13:32,971 --> 01:13:36,400
He's always doing the dependables big
expendables.

1771
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:38,220
Better name,
expendable.

1772
01:13:38,221 --> 01:13:39,930
The pinnacle.
I mean everybody's nose.

1773
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:42,440
He's doing well.
So wouldn't be you wouldn't want,

1774
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:45,390
you would say he's just doing it to show
he's not above cleaning the blood off

1775
01:13:45,391 --> 01:13:49,590
the mat.
He said national treasury son of a bitch

1776
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:54,290
can have ready to get door.
You need your Miata like data 5,000 and

1777
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:58,680
this is racist.
I'm not sure.

1778
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:02,280
Just cause he's scrubbing the mat.
Can't have randy do it.

1779
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,180
I'll do it.
If,

1780
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,830
if randy does that job,
I will fuck that.

1781
01:14:04,831 --> 01:14:05,880
Give me that brush.
Do it too.

1782
01:14:05,881 --> 01:14:07,980
I will rush and then I would do it as
well.

1783
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:09,900
I feel like it's randy couture.
Man,

1784
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:12,100
how did you take take it to randy to
door?

1785
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:14,620
I was just saying randy could do it
cause he's that humble,

1786
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:19,000
his stature because he's of his stature
because he's still,

1787
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:19,990
he,
well first of all,

1788
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:22,960
if you hear him talk you would never
think of other than looking at is

1789
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:24,130
cauliflower ear.
You know,

1790
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:27,340
you would never think that randy couture
had a lifetime of fighting.

1791
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,270
No.
He beat the game.

1792
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:32,230
He's killing it crazy.
And it joined some devil and is all you

1793
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:35,890
didn't lose by knock out a few times.
And me heavyweight,

1794
01:14:35,891 --> 01:14:39,390
I mean he got killed by brock prize.
Oh well Liotta machida knocked out with

1795
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:43,080
a flying time kick in his last fight.
Remember jumping front kick in the face.

1796
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,220
So that was the Odo um,
I mean he had been knocked out by Chuck

1797
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,900
Lesnar.
Bad lesnar.

1798
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:53,110
Lesbian was a Tko but chuck was bad man.
Charlie,

1799
01:14:53,111 --> 01:14:54,760
Ben,
chuck torqued his head.

1800
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:55,613
Yeah.

1801
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:59,020
So you know,
there was two chuck fights were lost by

1802
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:00,640
knockout,
right?

1803
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,870
Yeah.
Either way.

1804
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:02,704
Right.
Chuck,

1805
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:06,490
he beat Chuck once and they chunk feed
him twice.

1806
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,260
Correct.
I mean,

1807
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:10,120
so anyway,
my point is,

1808
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,510
randy talks perfect when you hear him
talk,

1809
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:18,610
he's smiling and he seems happy as a
couple of guys I get so does Tito Ortiz,

1810
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:24,070
he speaks pretty well to see Tito always
had like a little bit of anxiety on

1811
01:15:24,071 --> 01:15:28,450
camera that like would fuck them up.
Like there's those classic videos of

1812
01:15:28,451 --> 01:15:30,610
Tito when he was doing the affliction
stuff.

1813
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:35,560
I'm not saying he's fucking bob costs,
that's just anxiety and he speaks well.

1814
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:38,290
If you have a conversation with you,
there's no prison wrong with them.

1815
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:38,701
No,
no,

1816
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:38,951
no,
no,

1817
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:39,371
no,
no.

1818
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:40,930
Good point.
And um,

1819
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:42,370
you know,
there's a lot of other guys that have

1820
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,770
been around for a long time.
They don't have anything wrong with

1821
01:15:44,771 --> 01:15:45,550
them.
You know,

1822
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:48,910
there's a lot of guys that made it
through and you talk to them and they

1823
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:51,010
seem absolutely fine.
Have you seen that,

1824
01:15:51,011 --> 01:15:51,100
that

1825
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,780
movie concussion?
No.

1826
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:56,650
That shit will make you question what
you're doing with your life.

1827
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:59,080
Really.
I watched it on a plane before Brian.

1828
01:15:59,081 --> 01:16:02,050
I had one of our live fire the kids and
it fucked me up man.

1829
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:03,400
Wow.
That really,

1830
01:16:03,401 --> 01:16:06,910
really crazy.
How much of is based on reality and how

1831
01:16:06,911 --> 01:16:08,370
much of it is a dramatic,
I looked,

1832
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:10,120
I looked into it afterwards.
I mean,

1833
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:10,961
you know,
I'll see.

1834
01:16:10,961 --> 01:16:13,150
For the movies,
they exaggerate stuff as far as the guys

1835
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:14,650
dying in the head trauma and stuff like
that.

1836
01:16:14,651 --> 01:16:17,260
That's all real band and the NFL hiding
stuff.

1837
01:16:17,261 --> 01:16:19,750
That's all real.
That's why the lawsuit,

1838
01:16:19,751 --> 01:16:22,060
that's why all the NFL guys or the
lawsuit because they went,

1839
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:23,890
oh no,
that's all fake.

1840
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,260
It's not true.
There's no brain trauma caused by

1841
01:16:26,261 --> 01:16:30,640
football and they hit all of this thing
and by this doctor finding this stuff

1842
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:32,530
and trying to rebuild it,
reveal it.

1843
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,820
They were trying to fuck him over,
man.

1844
01:16:33,821 --> 01:16:36,670
It's nuts and that's all real.
All real.

1845
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:40,300
See that's where it's crazy because the
NFL still in business.

1846
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:42,070
Oh,
this guy's still around.

1847
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,240
They can't get any bigger.
Yeah.

1848
01:16:43,241 --> 01:16:44,290
The doctor,
he's still around.

1849
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,220
He's still around.
Yeah,

1850
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,660
he,
but he didn't want to be involved in the

1851
01:16:46,661 --> 01:16:49,120
NFL.
They offered him a full time Gig to help

1852
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:50,230
him out and he's like,
Nah man.

1853
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:54,010
Wow.
I need to watch it so I know exactly you

1854
01:16:54,011 --> 01:16:55,600
need to watch.
It's fucking intense,

1855
01:16:55,601 --> 01:16:56,410
man.
I watched him.

1856
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:57,370
I was like,
fuck,

1857
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:59,710
look,
football's dangerous.

1858
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:01,720
I got done and I just looked at Brian.
Brian goes,

1859
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:03,630
what's wrong?
And I went fucked.

1860
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:05,240
Brian started laughing.
He like,

1861
01:17:05,241 --> 01:17:06,220
what are you talking about?
I'm like,

1862
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:07,660
watch concussion,
man.

1863
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:08,793
He goes,
no,

1864
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,940
you done that much like,
well,

1865
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:13,370
20 years old.
Don't ever listen to Brian.

1866
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,050
Oh No.
Have you ever think that something might

1867
01:17:15,051 --> 01:17:16,130
be wrong?
Go.

1868
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,660
Never go to Brian because Brian,
I'll tell you,

1869
01:17:17,661 --> 01:17:19,580
you're fine.
The house burned down,

1870
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:22,810
but it's because you know it's still the
place on it.

1871
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:24,950
You can't.
You're going to camper for a few years.

1872
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:27,350
That's Brian.
Tell her you love her man.

1873
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:29,750
But Yeah,
man did that movie up.

1874
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:32,750
Fucking some guys have made it through
even a superbowl careers,

1875
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:35,150
but it's not a lot.
The problem is when they,

1876
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:40,210
when they test former football players
for cte and alarming number show signs,

1877
01:17:41,331 --> 01:17:43,370
a ct,
an alarming number.

1878
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,100
My only question is what you think was
going to happen.

1879
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:47,631
You know what I'm saying?
Like,

1880
01:17:47,631 --> 01:17:50,330
I don't think we knew it to this degree,
but the same time,

1881
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:53,750
like when I would run faith verse in
another giant man,

1882
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:54,160
I'm like,
God,

1883
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,610
it can't be healthy for my brain.

1884
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:56,653
No,
you know,

1885
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,630
but like the way they talked about a
concussion is if you put like a,

1886
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:03,710
uh,
like an apple and a water bottle and you

1887
01:18:03,711 --> 01:18:07,940
shake it like there's water in there
that's like your brain where most like

1888
01:18:07,941 --> 01:18:08,301
a,
you know,

1889
01:18:08,301 --> 01:18:10,250
those rams,
that head butt each other like a

1890
01:18:10,251 --> 01:18:13,010
woodpecker.
They have mechanisms in their head that

1891
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:15,290
absorb that shock,
but humans don't.

1892
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:16,820
Right.
So when we run into each other,

1893
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:19,670
your brain is smacking against this wall
cause we're not meant to do that.

1894
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:22,550
We're not meant to punch each other in
the face and run into each other with

1895
01:18:22,551 --> 01:18:24,080
helmets on.
We're just not built for that.

1896
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:25,250
No,
we haven't.

1897
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:29,360
We haven't really developed the ability
to absorb punishment or if we had that

1898
01:18:29,361 --> 01:18:30,440
ability,
we lost it.

1899
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:33,680
That's possible too.
Like if you look at neanderthals,

1900
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,810
they were built very different than us.

1901
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:39,110
You know,
they were very short and thick.

1902
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:42,260
I think the only word like a little bit
over five feet tall and they weighed

1903
01:18:42,261 --> 01:18:45,440
one,
200 pounds and he's this big ass bones,

1904
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:48,320
big thick bones.
They had bigger brains in ours too.

1905
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:51,050
So they were built different,
you know,

1906
01:18:51,051 --> 01:18:53,450
and they,
and they were just dealing with shit all

1907
01:18:53,451 --> 01:18:54,440
the time.
When they find them,

1908
01:18:54,441 --> 01:18:58,820
they're always finding ones with broken
bones and fucking spearpoints lodge and

1909
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:00,290
their spine.
Oh yeah.

1910
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:02,450
That's a day in the life of a caveman.
It's not,

1911
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:04,790
not a good time,
but our brains today,

1912
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:07,940
like this body today,
like floating also you see like people

1913
01:19:07,941 --> 01:19:09,590
are becoming,
they seem like,

1914
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:12,320
like if you,
if you look at people's like bone

1915
01:19:12,321 --> 01:19:16,520
structure in comparison to obviously
neanderthal,

1916
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:19,920
which is a different species,
but some people retain some percentage

1917
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:24,410
and the inner tall DNA.
But you would assume that as people go

1918
01:19:24,411 --> 01:19:27,680
further and further away from the
ancient hominins,

1919
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:30,560
the ancient monkeys and stuff,
we're getting softer and weaker,

1920
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:32,630
you know,
becoming more and more,

1921
01:19:32,631 --> 01:19:33,740
more softer for sure.

1922
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:36,620
But yeah,
we're involved in like football's the

1923
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:38,900
biggest sport in the,
well definitely the biggest sport in the

1924
01:19:38,901 --> 01:19:40,400
country.
Not The big sport in the world,

1925
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,830
obviously that's our biggest in the
country.

1926
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,150
If I fought a o two days,
Monday and Sunday,

1927
01:19:44,151 --> 01:19:45,170
which is not,
not only that,

1928
01:19:45,171 --> 01:19:46,460
and when we,
when there's a super bowl,

1929
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:48,800
it's a fucking,
almost a national holiday.

1930
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:51,920
Super Bowl Sunday is like,
everybody knows it.

1931
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:54,050
Everybody knows superbowl Sunday,
everyone,

1932
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,240
it's that big.
Like the world series can come and go

1933
01:19:56,241 --> 01:19:58,820
and people might miss it,
but they don't miss superbowl son.

1934
01:19:58,821 --> 01:19:59,520
Never.
But you know,

1935
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,210
it's weird talking about,
you know those nuts.

1936
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:03,820
The androgel w the caveman.
Yeah.

1937
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:06,530
So nfl players actually getting bigger
though.

1938
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:09,210
The athletes getting bigger and faster
and stronger.

1939
01:20:09,211 --> 01:20:10,550
Like they're getting way bigger.
Yeah.

1940
01:20:10,551 --> 01:20:13,410
The a 300 pound linemen in 1988 it was
like,

1941
01:20:13,411 --> 01:20:14,430
damn,
that's a big boy.

1942
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:15,660
Now it's like,
do you know her bitch?

1943
01:20:15,661 --> 01:20:17,070
Get outta here we go.
Step your game up.

1944
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:20,100
Yeah.
I wonder what that is still wrong.

1945
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:22,500
Yeah.
What did they test in four?

1946
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:24,990
Did they test for a shit in the NFL?
Yeah,

1947
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:27,090
but you know you shits,
it's once a year.

1948
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:28,680
Once a year.
Depends.

1949
01:20:28,681 --> 01:20:29,790
Unless you're,
unless you,

1950
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,280
unless you've been caught before,
then you're in a program where you

1951
01:20:32,281 --> 01:20:34,230
getting tested all the time.
Well why would they catch them?

1952
01:20:34,231 --> 01:20:37,970
Why would they try to catch him?
Like what did I agree to approve?

1953
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,200
Same thing.
Got Sports.

1954
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,410
The,
this sport is safe.

1955
01:20:40,411 --> 01:20:41,520
Look,
we're testing everyone.

1956
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:42,750
Shit.
But that doesn't,

1957
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:45,510
that just makes you recover slower.
You know,

1958
01:20:45,511 --> 01:20:47,520
it's,
it's a weird dynamic.

1959
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:51,100
It is a weird dynamic because you want
people to be gigantic and no one for

1960
01:20:51,101 --> 01:20:52,200
being,
no one talks about this.

1961
01:20:52,201 --> 01:20:52,890
And I,
I know it,

1962
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,500
you know the WB fans are fucking
ruthless.

1963
01:20:55,500 --> 01:21:00,330
But how many wwe athletes die?
Like China just died.

1964
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,190
But last night,
two nights ago we had the big girl,

1965
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:05,210
China,
she just died like it kind of alarm

1966
01:21:05,211 --> 01:21:06,540
cause they're not a ton of them.
Right.

1967
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,310
But when they get older,
they die.

1968
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:10,560
What did China die from?
I don't know.

1969
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:15,450
I think she was,
how old was she died in her house.

1970
01:21:15,451 --> 01:21:20,130
She 45 and 45 not that old.
She was on a fear factor.

1971
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:21,600
Really?
Yeah.

1972
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,310
Before she was bigger.
Like as a,

1973
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,140
as big man.
She was a celebrity.

1974
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,720
Yeah.
What's she doing on there?

1975
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:30,360
She did some gross shit eating like
snails and,

1976
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:33,030
but she did one thing and after she got
out of this thing,

1977
01:21:33,031 --> 01:21:35,490
she goes,
who's the man?

1978
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:39,810
Oh fuck that flax.
She made the most muscular thing I've

1979
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:40,471
ever heard.
My Laos.

1980
01:21:40,471 --> 01:21:44,570
She wasn't trying to be sexy.
I'm just saying as victorious.

1981
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:47,160
Who's the man went into porn?
You remember that?

1982
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:50,310
I do remember that as she hawked triple
x.

1983
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:50,911
Yeah,
that was,

1984
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:51,721
whoa.
Why no,

1985
01:21:51,721 --> 01:21:53,280
the typical one idea.
Don't ask.

1986
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:55,200
Well,
I think when people don't have a whole

1987
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:57,740
lot of options,
they start getting real desperado and

1988
01:21:57,741 --> 01:22:01,950
they don't know what to do.
That would be l Desperado doing she

1989
01:22:01,951 --> 01:22:02,790
hawk,
Aaa,

1990
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:04,983
others,
her.

1991
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:05,461
Oh,
that's you.

1992
01:22:05,461 --> 01:22:07,740
And that's you and her son.
Look at her muscles.

1993
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:10,560
Look how skinny I am.
Feel like she would have fucked you up

1994
01:22:10,561 --> 01:22:13,980
back then.
I'll fuck her up too quick.

1995
01:22:13,981 --> 01:22:14,814
And my piece.

1996
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,430
That's sad though.
So let's find out what happened.

1997
01:22:20,431 --> 01:22:21,650
Was it pills?
They don't know.

1998
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:24,180
They don't.
They don't know man.

1999
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:26,340
Super Nice man.
Real friendly.

2000
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:29,220
She's real nice person.
She followed me on twitter.

2001
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:31,680
Nice to everybody,
like on the set and everything like

2002
01:22:31,681 --> 01:22:32,880
that,
like a bomber man.

2003
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,240
But I think it's conversation to have
like the substance they put in their

2004
01:22:36,241 --> 01:22:39,210
bodies and you look at their schedule
being on the road 300 days a year,

2005
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,220
constantly falling uppers,
downers.

2006
01:22:41,221 --> 01:22:45,240
Like I know it's not legit.
I know it's not a legit sport compared

2007
01:22:45,241 --> 01:22:48,000
to the NFL UFC stuff and nbl or all that
stuff,

2008
01:22:48,001 --> 01:22:51,150
but it's,
you gotta talk about it because these

2009
01:22:51,151 --> 01:22:52,890
guys are passing away,
but there's no,

2010
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:56,490
there's no regulatory,
like no one's making sure there's no

2011
01:22:56,491 --> 01:22:57,330
commission.
Well,

2012
01:22:57,331 --> 01:22:59,730
there's certainly athletes,
but I think a lot of people think of

2013
01:22:59,731 --> 01:23:02,450
them as athletes,
more of like a Cirque du Soleil type

2014
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:02,670
thing.

2015
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:06,460
Like they're doing a performance.
Then they think of them as in a sport so

2016
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:08,800
they don't look to try to regulate it or
change it.

2017
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,960
They look at it as sort of like an
entertainment thing.

2018
01:23:10,961 --> 01:23:12,820
These people were doing night,
you know what I'm saying?

2019
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:13,570
I'm with you,
man,

2020
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:16,240
I'm with you.
But they're taking some performance

2021
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:19,480
enhancing supplements that a lot of the
pro athletes are taking even more cell,

2022
01:23:19,481 --> 01:23:21,460
I think,
because their schedules are way crazy.

2023
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:22,450
Yeah,
no doubt.

2024
01:23:22,451 --> 01:23:24,670
So when they pass away,
I think there has to be some sort of

2025
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,250
plan in place.
I think,

2026
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,313
well,
the problem,

2027
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:31,960
the problem is she hasn't worked for
them in a long time.

2028
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,900
That's one.
And then second thing is if she was

2029
01:23:34,901 --> 01:23:37,720
doing pills or she was abusing other
substances,

2030
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,550
they're not really responsible for that.
Like we don't,

2031
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,090
we don't know how much of what she was
doing she was doing just because she was

2032
01:23:43,091 --> 01:23:46,090
in a recreational drugs.
There was obviously some steroids.

2033
01:23:46,091 --> 01:23:48,490
And I'm referring to the steroid show.
Oh,

2034
01:23:48,491 --> 01:23:50,350
you think that did it to her?
I think it was a pill.

2035
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,311
I don't know.
Pill.

2036
01:23:51,311 --> 01:23:52,570
I don't know.
I don't know.

2037
01:23:52,571 --> 01:23:54,340
I think I'm pretty sure she overdosed,
dude.

2038
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:55,240
Oh really?
Yeah.

2039
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,410
Well,
I'm not saying she overdosed on

2040
01:23:56,411 --> 01:23:57,430
testosterone some.
No,

2041
01:23:57,431 --> 01:23:58,330
and I'm just saying,
oh no,

2042
01:23:58,331 --> 01:23:58,921
no,
she was,

2043
01:23:58,921 --> 01:24:00,830
she was still on pain pills.
Oh yeah,

2044
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:02,170
I'm sure.
Pretty positive.

2045
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:03,130
That's what they're saying,
right?

2046
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:04,203
A lot of people were saying,

2047
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:07,050
right.
She was on the open gym not too long

2048
01:24:07,051 --> 01:24:08,790
ago.
She had just came back from Japan where

2049
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:10,290
I think she had been living for the last
couple of years.

2050
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,570
Teaching English.
Yeah,

2051
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:14,070
doing,
getting away from the craziness of

2052
01:24:14,071 --> 01:24:15,990
American.
She was just coming back to get back

2053
01:24:15,991 --> 01:24:20,220
into life and entertainment and she was
found dead after not talking to anybody

2054
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,630
for six days or something like that.

2055
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:24,570
She went dark.
That sucks man.

2056
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:27,240
Fucking,
I just think it's something to look into

2057
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:28,800
with the Dojo.
You guys,

2058
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:31,440
it's a discussion to fucking have at
least,

2059
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:33,150
well,
I'm sure they must be having it.

2060
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:36,020
It's a giant organization.
Chris,

2061
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:41,040
ben Wa again,
there's one of those guys who goes off

2062
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:44,070
the rails like that and does something
horrific and you gotta wonder like,

2063
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:47,250
was that in that Guy Anyway?
Did he have issues already?

2064
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:48,930
Did it have something to do with
wrestling?

2065
01:24:48,931 --> 01:24:51,780
Did it have something to do with
substance abuse and Kushans they get

2066
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:54,360
shemozzle concussions.
It could be a lot of different factors.

2067
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:56,370
It's definitely something to look into,
but it's,

2068
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:59,790
it's so rare that someone goes that far
off the rails like he did.

2069
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:00,480
Oh,
I agree.

2070
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,820
I'm just saying,
let's look at what they're doing to

2071
01:25:02,821 --> 01:25:05,850
their bodies and have a discussion about
it to maybe to make it safer.

2072
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:07,470
So to prevent it from happening.
That's it.

2073
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:08,850
I'm not saying I'll tell you,
but dammit.

2074
01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:10,270
I'm just saying,
I don't know.

2075
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:12,500
Captain,
save a hoe over here.

2076
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:13,470
Trying to save everybody.

2077
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:18,390
Keep the want to do flips off the top
row.

2078
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:24,640
What new possible overdose or natural
death where that natural at 46 no one

2079
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,990
finds that fishy.
That doesn't seem to make a lot of

2080
01:25:27,991 --> 01:25:30,240
sense.
Dead on her bed after receiving a call

2081
01:25:30,241 --> 01:25:31,074
for,
okay,

2082
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:32,810
let's just,
we don't need to read all the rest on

2083
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,410
though.
She's a very nice person.

2084
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,390
So rest in peace buns.
Hi know.

2085
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,670
Nice Lady.
At least get it on a good note.

2086
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:45,200
How about your boy,
Ben Henderson going for the triple Crown

2087
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,490
Bella tour?
WC UFC belt.

2088
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:50,020
No one's talking about it.
Not Nothing.

2089
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,560
Who was he fighting?
He's fighting this rushing cat and I

2090
01:25:52,561 --> 01:25:55,080
wish I could remember his name.
I've even trained with them some even

2091
01:25:55,081 --> 01:25:56,700
bigger prick for that.
But uh,

2092
01:25:56,701 --> 01:25:59,170
it's a tough fight for Ben.
He's beat better guys with the top.

2093
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,400
It's not a walk in the park.
I said it's weird that no one's bringing

2094
01:26:02,401 --> 01:26:04,430
it up at all.
See that's the disadvantage

2095
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:05,980
of signing with Bella tour.
Yeah.

2096
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:09,130
Because imagine,
imagine if he was doing this in the UFC.

2097
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:12,140
It'd be fucking everywhere,
but it's all of course golf.

2098
01:26:12,430 --> 01:26:13,970
Uh,
we know what's interesting is,

2099
01:26:13,971 --> 01:26:15,410
um,
I don't even,

2100
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:18,380
I mean I don't,
I don't watch half of the Bela Tarr

2101
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:19,700
ones.
I don't even watch half of them.

2102
01:26:19,701 --> 01:26:20,481
I know,
I know.

2103
01:26:20,481 --> 01:26:22,700
They're probably pretty good fights.
I watch them if them,

2104
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,000
if they're the major ones,
like obviously I'll watch bands,

2105
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,090
Phil King,
Mo,

2106
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:28,310
a lot of these guys that I like,
but I'm like,

2107
01:26:28,311 --> 01:26:31,190
what is missing?
What is missing from even drawing me in?

2108
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:33,380
I mean,
almost feel like detached from it

2109
01:26:33,381 --> 01:26:36,050
because I feel insulted by the freak
show element.

2110
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,270
Me Too.
I feel like it was a slap in my face.

2111
01:26:38,271 --> 01:26:38,811
Like,
I like,

2112
01:26:38,811 --> 01:26:39,890
dude,
you set us back,

2113
01:26:39,891 --> 01:26:42,050
man.
I feel like a dummy for watching to

2114
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:43,220
really,
right,

2115
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:43,550
I agree.

2116
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:45,410
Yeah.
Whereas like I don't feel like that if I

2117
01:26:45,411 --> 01:26:49,030
watched glory or if I watch anything
yellow or if I watch one FC,

2118
01:26:49,031 --> 01:26:51,980
I don't feel like that.
I feel like I'm getting,

2119
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:54,920
I'm getting shit on.
Like you're putting the other nonsense

2120
01:26:54,921 --> 01:26:57,320
might sound weird to say.
I almost feel like I'm cheating on the

2121
01:26:57,321 --> 01:26:58,850
UFC.
When I watched and I talked about,

2122
01:26:58,851 --> 01:27:00,050
I'm like,
Oh really?

2123
01:27:00,051 --> 01:27:00,920
Is that weird?
Yeah.

2124
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:03,740
I think it's good to have competition.
I think it's important.

2125
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:06,350
I agree with they have a ways to go.
They do,

2126
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:08,810
but they,
they ended up good stuff too though.

2127
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,400
They didn't have to,
if they,

2128
01:27:10,401 --> 01:27:12,740
if they did the right thing and promoted
the right way,

2129
01:27:12,741 --> 01:27:17,060
they went for like big ratings on a
couple of these weird fights which the

2130
01:27:17,061 --> 01:27:22,061
UFC did to sort of in the early 2000
[inaudible] tank habit came back.

2131
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,330
Yeah.

2132
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:25,390
I mean there was a few of those times,
you know,

2133
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,420
you had to do that back.
I mean started,

2134
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:31,610
they did some fights back then that were
in comparison,

2135
01:27:31,611 --> 01:27:33,620
silly,
but people didn't consider a sport

2136
01:27:33,621 --> 01:27:35,210
really,
but it was coming along.

2137
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:39,230
But the sports already established now
and so they're taking advantage of these

2138
01:27:39,231 --> 01:27:44,090
old veterans like hoists and Ken
shamrock and having that fight and it's

2139
01:27:44,091 --> 01:27:48,380
going to draw in the casual nostalgic
viewer that remembers UFC one and

2140
01:27:48,381 --> 01:27:49,760
they're going to go and they're going to
watch it.

2141
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:52,310
Snow s sustainability with that.
It's just not,

2142
01:27:52,311 --> 01:27:55,070
there is no sustainability.
And the other problem is that for

2143
01:27:55,071 --> 01:27:56,750
whatever reason,
I don't know what the reason is.

2144
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:59,690
You're not hearing a lot of noise about
their champs,

2145
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:01,910
you know and you kind of should.
It's weird.

2146
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,910
We'll brooks is a bad motherfucker.
Michael Chandler is a bad mother fucker

2147
01:28:05,911 --> 01:28:06,240
fucker.

2148
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,510
They got some great fighters over that
patriarchy pit bulls.

2149
01:28:08,511 --> 01:28:11,000
A bad mother fosters man,
very good fighters.

2150
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,880
So it just seems like whatever they've
done wrong,

2151
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:15,650
Ben,
Ben was on espn.

2152
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:18,620
That's good.
He was on espn talking.

2153
01:28:18,621 --> 01:28:20,320
I'm glad they're given it.
Some press look,

2154
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:25,360
they definitely need like the UFC could
use competition and I think it would

2155
01:28:25,761 --> 01:28:28,490
boost the sport whereas make the sport
bigger.

2156
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:32,660
I just don't think that bell toward its
current state is competition.

2157
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:37,520
They're taking a lot of fighters that
are past their prime except for Benson

2158
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,810
Benson going over there as the biggest
coup.

2159
01:28:38,811 --> 01:28:40,340
I fail.
Phil's big.

2160
01:28:40,341 --> 01:28:41,570
It's not past his prime.
No,

2161
01:28:41,571 --> 01:28:43,850
but phil had been beaten soundly by
rumble.

2162
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:45,710
He did have that really good fight
against glover.

2163
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:47,850
Clover.
He beat Machida as true.

2164
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:51,200
If I was super,
super close still though,

2165
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:53,660
it's still a can speak Gustafson.
That's true.

2166
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:55,460
But he strangled them.
Yeah.

2167
01:28:55,650 --> 01:29:00,110
So I mean,
but the thing about Phil as Phil Phil is

2168
01:29:00,111 --> 01:29:01,280
in a guy

2169
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,560
fills fighting styles and the guy,
we were like,

2170
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:08,550
I have to fucking see that you say that,
but in Beltour he looked fucking

2171
01:29:08,551 --> 01:29:10,050
sensational,
was like a destroyer.

2172
01:29:10,051 --> 01:29:12,570
Amazing.
He won by stoppage maize and maybe he's

2173
01:29:12,571 --> 01:29:15,960
off to a d in New star,
maybe recognizes the urgency of being in

2174
01:29:15,961 --> 01:29:17,790
a new organization.
She's one of the best fighters in the

2175
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:19,200
world.
And going over there.

2176
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:19,891
I think,
you know,

2177
01:29:19,891 --> 01:29:22,080
he was the first guy to do it and I
remember tax,

2178
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:24,390
I'm going,
you got some motherfucking balls.

2179
01:29:24,391 --> 01:29:25,530
Good luck man.
You know?

2180
01:29:25,531 --> 01:29:26,040
And he's like,
yeah,

2181
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,330
he texted me.
I'm so scared.

2182
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:29,250
Hell yeah man.
It's scary.

2183
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,360
It's paying off.
Right?

2184
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:31,700
Because it was fat now.
Yeah.

2185
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,280
And Now ben Henderson and they got mitre
owned.

2186
01:29:34,281 --> 01:29:36,480
Mitchell is a little older,
but at least a heavyweight Smith's young

2187
01:29:36,481 --> 01:29:40,680
can be champions.
So those are three completely legit guys

2188
01:29:40,681 --> 01:29:41,630
that they've acquired.

2189
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:42,850
A stable.
Yeah.

2190
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:46,140
Well he would have been interesting if
they got fade or it would have been

2191
01:29:46,141 --> 01:29:48,540
interesting.
Won't fingers playing grab ass and he's

2192
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:50,990
fighting a on dot.
Yeah.

2193
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:52,600
Yeah.
I don't know what type.

2194
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:55,380
I might be wrong on this.
You might have to look at Jamie.

2195
01:29:55,381 --> 01:29:59,130
I think it's on fight pass.
What his fate or might be on fight pass.

2196
01:29:59,131 --> 01:30:03,450
I thought that fight really versus all
Denato rise in risen is on fight pass.

2197
01:30:03,451 --> 01:30:04,800
Come on.
Am I crazy here?

2198
01:30:04,801 --> 01:30:06,810
I'm making shit up.
Really?

2199
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:11,220
I don't know this Keto genic died.
That's just my brain on another level.

2200
01:30:12,350 --> 01:30:14,040
It would be funny if you really nailed
it.

2201
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:16,470
Um,
but the,

2202
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:20,820
he's been saying lately that he's been
in talks to the UFC at it and I think

2203
01:30:20,821 --> 01:30:22,920
you'd give it a good go.
Cause you look at the state of the

2204
01:30:22,921 --> 01:30:24,570
heavyweight division,
everyone's old as fuck.

2205
01:30:24,570 --> 01:30:26,460
Don't you get your fossils?
But don't you think they put them

2206
01:30:26,461 --> 01:30:29,160
immediately with vre doom.
I like that matchup.

2207
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:31,770
I liked her match of too,
but I think you have to do it that way,

2208
01:30:31,771 --> 01:30:32,700
right?
Fuck yeah.

2209
01:30:32,701 --> 01:30:37,670
He can't toss them like some young dude.
But what young dude do we even have?

2210
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:38,910
We don't have one.
I don't know.

2211
01:30:38,911 --> 01:30:40,710
We don't really have a lot of,
uh,

2212
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:43,470
I couldn't name one third,
but I'm saying for him,

2213
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:46,020
like there's a resurgence of all these
older fighters.

2214
01:30:46,021 --> 01:30:50,970
We get Rothwell or Lawsky fucking hunt,
Frank Mir candy just lost with all these

2215
01:30:50,971 --> 01:30:54,150
guys are hold his fuck dude.
Fate or there's hope.

2216
01:30:54,151 --> 01:30:55,800
My man,
he'd still do it.

2217
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:58,830
He never know man,
that skinny fat bill just fucking dudes

2218
01:30:58,831 --> 01:31:01,890
up.
If he still has that motivation and

2219
01:31:01,891 --> 01:31:04,550
there's drug testing.
I'm not saying he did something to say

2220
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:04,860
bright.

2221
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:08,460
I hate to Piss on the pride days but I'm
just saying it ain't the wild wild west.

2222
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:11,490
We have to see your Dick this time.
Yeah we don't know.

2223
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:14,920
We're just speculating.
I'm just saying it is.

2224
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:19,410
Total fights are different as he looked
different but he doesn't weight train

2225
01:31:19,411 --> 01:31:20,910
anymore.
But I'll let me know what steroids do

2226
01:31:20,911 --> 01:31:22,500
you are taking cause I would never touch
them

2227
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:27,900
because physically I'm going for look.
But he got,

2228
01:31:27,930 --> 01:31:31,530
he got thicker again before his most
recent comeback.

2229
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,360
Like there was all sorts of posts about
it.

2230
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:34,381
Ah,
online.

2231
01:31:34,381 --> 01:31:38,550
I saw some photos of him training and he
looked thicker back to the old days like

2232
01:31:38,551 --> 01:31:41,050
throwing around logs and shit look
better than their kettlebells.

2233
01:31:41,051 --> 01:31:43,050
We Shit,
it definitely looked like he had been

2234
01:31:43,051 --> 01:31:46,290
doing some weightlifting cause there
would come a time in his career where it

2235
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:48,210
looked like the weightlifting days
rolling agree.

2236
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:51,150
Like the early days he was way thicker
and bigger.

2237
01:31:51,151 --> 01:31:54,810
And then as he got older,
he concentrated more on skills and less

2238
01:31:54,811 --> 01:31:57,030
on strength and conditioning.
And that's not him.

2239
01:31:57,230 --> 01:32:00,520
And I think what I think you need both.
I think especially this day and age,

2240
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:03,460
but when he was fighting,
fuck man,

2241
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:07,240
I think he just put a lot of emphasis on
it striking in particular and his

2242
01:32:07,241 --> 01:32:10,870
ability to explode with combinations.
If you go like to the Tim Silvia fight,

2243
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:15,820
the speed of combinations and he was
hitting guys with and his hips powerness

2244
01:32:15,821 --> 01:32:16,990
hip.
It's insane.

2245
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:20,230
I do.
I think he has a legit shot shot to do

2246
01:32:20,231 --> 01:32:23,440
some work in the heavyweight division.
Now if you're his age and come back to

2247
01:32:23,441 --> 01:32:26,590
55 70 you're fucked.
But here's agent heavyweight.

2248
01:32:26,591 --> 01:32:28,900
Hell son.
What age is he?

2249
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:33,040
36 now he has to be at least 38 39
right?

2250
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,790
Or we'll find out if he him verse
Barnett something.

2251
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:39,090
So back son,
don't think he's that.

2252
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:41,050
Oh No,
I don't think he's that old.

2253
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:43,780
39 wow.
Interesting.

2254
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:46,390
I'm telling this kid or died.
That's my brain firing.

2255
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,860
It's like shit out.
UFC offered feed or a million Eiko more

2256
01:32:50,861 --> 01:32:54,670
money than rising probability to fight
inside the octagon.

2257
01:32:54,671 --> 01:32:56,290
Very high.
Whoa.

2258
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:59,560
Holy Shit.
That'd be intense.

2259
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:02,500
Why is your boxing gloves on there?
Cause he's fucking,

2260
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:04,470
but those boxing gloves,
those are those big assets.

2261
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:06,400
Those are affliction where they're all
big.

2262
01:33:06,401 --> 01:33:07,001
Yeah.
Oh Wow.

2263
01:33:07,001 --> 01:33:09,080
They're huge.
I thought my close eviction.

2264
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:10,030
Yeah,
those are flection.

2265
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:11,890
Ansys they look,
they look a lot bigger than it.

2266
01:33:11,891 --> 01:33:13,150
Yeah,
they do actually the raps,

2267
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:15,670
dude.
Can you imagine,

2268
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:19,090
this is almost hard to say.
Can you imagine fader and a reebok kit

2269
01:33:19,190 --> 01:33:20,260
locked in the octagon?

2270
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:27,300
I might buy that reebok kit if it was
white and red shade on the back.

2271
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:32,030
Be the first kid I buy Sun.
Be Fun.

2272
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:33,550
All right.
Just make my own.

2273
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:36,070
I'd wear a fade or shirt for sure.
Fuck yeah.

2274
01:33:36,071 --> 01:33:39,670
I used to wear a cro cop security shirt.
Did you really fought them?

2275
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:44,590
I bought it online for my Croatia and
came like nine weeks later and it was

2276
01:33:44,591 --> 01:33:47,440
too small,
but I still rocked it like my belly hung

2277
01:33:47,441 --> 01:33:48,490
out underneath it.
I was like,

2278
01:33:48,491 --> 01:33:51,070
fuck it.
No one really knew who he was.

2279
01:33:51,071 --> 01:33:54,910
I used to train that thing all the time.
How weird was it getting a call to fight

2280
01:33:54,911 --> 01:33:56,920
that guy after that?
So weird.

2281
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,840
It might be the best collaborator in my
life.

2282
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,070
Well,
it was the best.

2283
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:02,830
One of the best results.
If you ever had any occupation might be

2284
01:34:02,831 --> 01:34:04,630
the better,
best joe after that,

2285
01:34:04,631 --> 01:34:05,351
if someone said,
hey man,

2286
01:34:05,351 --> 01:34:06,790
let's just kind of move on from here.

2287
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:07,623
I'm like,
all right.

2288
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:11,650
If he was showing me a crystal ball,
it's all right from here,

2289
01:34:11,651 --> 01:34:15,190
but I'll just move on.
What do you think of Osp and Jon Jones?

2290
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:20,730
Um,
I think o s p he's an explosive guy,

2291
01:34:22,481 --> 01:34:23,380
but man,
John,

2292
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:25,780
just too smart.
Too long to get caught.

2293
01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:26,650
I think.
Uh,

2294
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:30,580
it's a good,
I hate saying this because Ospi such

2295
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:32,200
good athlete and he's ranked in the top
10 or whatever,

2296
01:34:32,201 --> 01:34:35,080
but it's a good tuneup fight for John.
Wow.

2297
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:36,100
I know.
It's fucked up.

2298
01:34:36,110 --> 01:34:39,640
My number's six light heavyweight is a
good tuneup fight for you.

2299
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:41,260
Light heavyweight is struggling,
son.

2300
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:42,910
Well,
sort of,

2301
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:45,820
but not really.
It's like there's so much possibility

2302
01:34:45,821 --> 01:34:47,240
there in the top five.
Yeah.

2303
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:50,620
What glow over just did to Rashad.
Holy Shit Man.

2304
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:54,250
That was hard to watch.
It was hard to watch because you know

2305
01:34:54,251 --> 01:34:56,950
Rashad was super tentative and it was on
the outside.

2306
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:59,080
It was moving away from glover and
clover.

2307
01:34:59,090 --> 01:35:01,570
Just close the distance and close the
lights.

2308
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:05,230
The terminator,
there couldn't be a worse match up for

2309
01:35:05,231 --> 01:35:08,060
Rashad.
Like I just wish and I get it,

2310
01:35:08,061 --> 01:35:08,690
man.
People get well,

2311
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:10,120
fighters fight.
I get that man,

2312
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:14,330
but it was Rashad's stage in his career.
Sometimes you got to have a man to go,

2313
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:15,181
dude.
Clovers,

2314
01:35:15,181 --> 01:35:16,760
a foe.
He does everything better than you right

2315
01:35:16,761 --> 01:35:18,200
now.
Let's figure something else out,

2316
01:35:18,201 --> 01:35:20,030
Bro.
What w I mean you win this one.

2317
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:21,710
Are you going to fight for the title?
Probably not.

2318
01:35:21,711 --> 01:35:23,660
I think you've got to take whoever he
can.

2319
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:25,220
You know it looks so,
look what we got here.

2320
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:27,140
This is what I want to see.
Please.

2321
01:35:27,170 --> 01:35:32,170
Stephanie Johnson and glover Hamas,
especially at clover called for it.

2322
01:35:33,711 --> 01:35:36,950
That's the best fighter in the UFC right
now.

2323
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:40,340
Please make that happen.
If there's one fight that could give me

2324
01:35:40,341 --> 01:35:41,840
go to UFC fight,
you'd be that.

2325
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:44,300
And by the way,
I dunno who the fuck to bed on me.

2326
01:35:44,301 --> 01:35:45,720
Neither about that.
Me Need,

2327
01:35:45,721 --> 01:35:48,230
you should give be chaos in both
directions.

2328
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:51,050
I think if it goes past first round,
glover takes over maybe.

2329
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:54,680
But that first rounds can be a
motherfucka first round is like one of

2330
01:35:54,681 --> 01:35:58,580
those scenes in a movie where we're like
a building explodes and you have to run

2331
01:35:58,581 --> 01:36:00,850
through the rubble without hitting you
in the head on a,

2332
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:05,880
you got a a minefield to navigate when
you're fighting rumble because one

2333
01:36:06,081 --> 01:36:08,750
mistake,
if that doesn't get you crunk,

2334
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:13,220
you're an idiot and it's Gustafson
retiring.

2335
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:15,220
I come in here and that Gustafson
doesn't want to find it.

2336
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,650
I like he,
I saw an interview you did where he's

2337
01:36:17,670 --> 01:36:19,460
saying he's like lost the passion for
it.

2338
01:36:19,461 --> 01:36:22,280
So he came to San Diego hoping he could
find it and I'm not sure if he did,

2339
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:26,270
but when you start talking like that,
I want you to look at the top three

2340
01:36:26,271 --> 01:36:29,990
because Glover Anthony and John Jones
will rip your Dick off and they want

2341
01:36:29,991 --> 01:36:30,980
this more than anything.

2342
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:33,080
So it's probably time to maybe give it
up.

2343
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:38,000
It's interesting that bater well I guess
Bader beat over and St Pru so he should

2344
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:39,890
be ranked above them.
True.

2345
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:44,000
And then Rashad shoguns still in the
mix,

2346
01:36:44,001 --> 01:36:44,631
Huh?
Dude.

2347
01:36:44,631 --> 01:36:45,560
Eight.
You're crazy.

2348
01:36:45,561 --> 01:36:47,090
If you think light heavyweights.
Good.

2349
01:36:47,690 --> 01:36:52,690
Well Shit
that kio gets me on another love on him.

2350
01:36:52,821 --> 01:36:57,821
He didn't say shit.
It is look past six.

2351
01:36:58,370 --> 01:37:00,240
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

2352
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,090
Well Vince,
um,

2353
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:04,340
Rashad Shogun,
Jimmy Manoa,

2354
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:08,960
Jimmy man guy.
Jimmy Mattawa is a guy that just was not

2355
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:13,430
in martial arts that long before.
He's fighting top level guys to mma who

2356
01:37:13,431 --> 01:37:16,790
utilize a sick athlete with ridiculous
power.

2357
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:20,780
And I just for games changed.
No one gives a fuck cause now you have

2358
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:21,920
real fighters.
Go what?

2359
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:24,620
You're fast getting and punch out power.
That's cool.

2360
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:27,560
I'm just going to take you down.
He fought rumble humble man when he

2361
01:37:27,561 --> 01:37:28,394
fought rumble.

2362
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:31,370
Well,
Gustafson stopped him before the rumble

2363
01:37:31,371 --> 01:37:33,910
fight in a very important fight.
Why they do them like that?

2364
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,330
Here's rumble.
Who's guts the same?

2365
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:38,960
Damn it.
Damn.

2366
01:37:38,961 --> 01:37:43,820
Double whammy of death.
You're fighting a guy that's boxing you

2367
01:37:43,821 --> 01:37:47,240
up for another zip code and you're just
like fuck.

2368
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:48,470
And then you get a break.
Well,

2369
01:37:48,471 --> 01:37:52,670
in the UFC you bitch and then you fight.
Rumble Dude's got literal nuclear

2370
01:37:52,671 --> 01:37:54,390
weapons.
Pride at the end of his hand,

2371
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:59,410
they got shogun and little Nog in the
top 10 that's a hard sell.

2372
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:04,530
Especially especially in little little
Nog is a hard sells a top 10 guy.

2373
01:38:04,531 --> 01:38:07,110
And that's a good argument that,
that no one,

2374
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:07,681
yeah,
there's no,

2375
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:10,930
like you look at the,
you look at the heavier divisions and

2376
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:13,170
like at heavyweight,
I mean there's fun.

2377
01:38:13,171 --> 01:38:15,420
Matchups everyone's old as fuck though.
Really man.

2378
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:16,590
And they look at light heavyweight.

2379
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:18,210
There's not a lot going on out to the
side,

2380
01:38:18,211 --> 01:38:21,480
the top five and in the top five.
Alexander does he know if he wants to do

2381
01:38:21,481 --> 01:38:24,000
it anymore,
it's very important.

2382
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:24,721
Yeah.
Very,

2383
01:38:24,721 --> 01:38:26,490
very good point.
But why do you think that,

2384
01:38:26,491 --> 01:38:28,650
Joe,
why do you think these bigger athletes

2385
01:38:28,651 --> 01:38:31,800
aren't gravitating towards mixed martial
arts?

2386
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:33,960
Well,
I don't know if it's that or if it just

2387
01:38:33,961 --> 01:38:35,430
comes in waves.
You know,

2388
01:38:35,431 --> 01:38:38,820
I think sometimes you have a guy like
Jon Jones and they create a bit of a

2389
01:38:38,821 --> 01:38:42,240
bottleneck because they're so good and
we can't forget about cornea of course.

2390
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:45,180
So just in that alone,
you've got John Jones and Cormier

2391
01:38:45,181 --> 01:38:46,980
cormier.
He's as good as anybody in the world.

2392
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:49,560
He got Anthony Johnson who can knock out
a tree.

2393
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,690
You got Glover,
you got Gustafson,

2394
01:38:51,870 --> 01:38:55,680
and who knows what could or couldn't
happen this weekend with ovince Saint

2395
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,980
Pru.
You know the guys on that list,

2396
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:00,330
when I'm looking at him,
I'm like,

2397
01:39:00,331 --> 01:39:00,980
well,
these are,

2398
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:02,610
there's,
you've got at least one,

2399
01:39:02,611 --> 01:39:03,540
two,
three,

2400
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:04,830
four,
five,

2401
01:39:04,831 --> 01:39:08,790
six,
[inaudible] six legit world beaters six

2402
01:39:08,791 --> 01:39:09,240
legit.

2403
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,520
But you're talking about the biggest
organization in the world.

2404
01:39:11,521 --> 01:39:12,301
After that,
it's like,

2405
01:39:12,301 --> 01:39:13,190
yeah,
not much going on.

2406
01:39:13,191 --> 01:39:14,580
There's no young talent.
We were like,

2407
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:15,420
dude,
he's the,

2408
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:19,220
there's no sage.
Northcutts happened in cycles and weight

2409
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:22,190
classes because there was no one at one
85 for awhile.

2410
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:24,330
One 85 was struggling for a while.
Let me see,

2411
01:39:24,331 --> 01:39:27,330
one 95 one 85 now you've got it.
Well,

2412
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:29,730
you know,
once Anderson loss and Weidman came in,

2413
01:39:29,731 --> 01:39:32,910
now you've got look at this crazy mix
and I don't know what they're going to

2414
01:39:32,911 --> 01:39:36,000
do with Yoel Romero,
but what I understand is that he has a

2415
01:39:36,001 --> 01:39:37,990
very small window,
uh,

2416
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:40,740
where they're going to ban him for like
only like five months.

2417
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:41,583
Yeah,
yeah,

2418
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,430
he did.
What he did was totally,

2419
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:47,160
he was actually honest.
They got the stuff independently off the

2420
01:39:47,161 --> 01:39:51,870
shelf that he said that he took.
They took that stuff and they tested it

2421
01:39:51,871 --> 01:39:54,810
and it had low levels of whatever this
peptide is.

2422
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:58,380
It's supposed to grow testosterone in
your body or something like that.

2423
01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:02,160
So he really didn't take anything that
he wasn't supposed to take.

2424
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:05,460
He took something that had something in
it that wasn't supposed to be in it,

2425
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:07,440
and he proved it.
But Joel,

2426
01:40:07,441 --> 01:40:09,480
even if you,
if you go through middleweight look,

2427
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:11,910
okay.
Vietor a he ain't that young.

2428
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:13,980
Bisbing I mean,
yeah,

2429
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:15,030
not young.
Has One eye.

2430
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:16,950
Anderson Silva.
Okay.

2431
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:19,020
Like fell off Leo Machida,
well,

2432
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,730
older,
uh,

2433
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,360
Musashi.
Tim Kennedy lead.

2434
01:40:23,361 --> 01:40:25,260
He's like,
there's not Dan Henderson's in there.

2435
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:28,590
How has Musashi ranked above Uriah Hall
when you're riding hauled jumps,

2436
01:40:28,591 --> 01:40:30,840
spitting back,
kicked him in the face and stopped him?

2437
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:32,810
Whoever votes on this thinks it's the
flu.

2438
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:36,840
Those are ridiculous people.
That is a ridiculous ranking.

2439
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:41,280
They're the ones writing articles that
can not be two steps above a guy.

2440
01:40:41,281 --> 01:40:43,440
When the guy stopped you in your last
fight.

2441
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,970
That is weird.
You cannot,

2442
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,310
I wish our boy Tim Kenny,
that's just an,

2443
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:51,330
that's an arrogant assessment of
someone's ability in comparison to

2444
01:40:51,331 --> 01:40:53,770
someone else's ability.
That's not based on facts.

2445
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:57,280
You have to base individual interactions
between two fighters.

2446
01:40:57,281 --> 01:40:59,710
You have to base them on facts.
It's very black and white.

2447
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:01,570
It's very black and white.
There's no doubt about it.

2448
01:41:01,571 --> 01:41:04,450
The uriah hall proved himself to be the
better fighter.

2449
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:06,730
Gay Garden was saucy.
Took him down and control them in the

2450
01:41:06,731 --> 01:41:09,420
first round and the second round,
Uriah Hall Jumps,

2451
01:41:09,421 --> 01:41:12,100
Spinning back,
kicked him in the face and knocked him

2452
01:41:12,101 --> 01:41:13,390
ass.
All that that is,

2453
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:16,960
there's no more definitive ending.
This is an insult to him to have him at

2454
01:41:16,961 --> 01:41:18,730
number 10 and half gay guard at number
eight.

2455
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:21,250
The only thing you can do with these
riders,

2456
01:41:21,251 --> 01:41:23,200
so cause it's basically a popularity
contest,

2457
01:41:23,201 --> 01:41:24,610
right?
If guy keeps winning a popularity

2458
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:26,620
contest,
but the chance he can't deny it right

2459
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:28,600
though the champion one and two,
it's kind of,

2460
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:29,680
there's no honey dick.

2461
01:41:29,730 --> 01:41:34,120
You see one Brazilian writer put fucking
notorious mma.

2462
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:38,800
He put him four notches lower after he
knocked out Aldo.

2463
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:39,653
Yeah,
Connor.

2464
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:40,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

2465
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:43,300
How crazy is that?
How the fuck could you do that?

2466
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:44,710
Well,
I don't know how,

2467
01:41:44,710 --> 01:41:47,080
but why does anyone take these series?
But that's why.

2468
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:50,140
How could you do that?
I mean you might not like connor,

2469
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:53,650
you might think the connor's a brash guy
and he insulted your champion and he

2470
01:41:53,651 --> 01:41:55,960
insulted your country and Blah Blah
Blah.

2471
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:58,990
And then he smashes him with one punch
in 13 seconds.

2472
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:01,170
It's just not professional and I'll
can't,

2473
01:42:01,210 --> 01:42:03,640
you're fucked.
Like no one can take your word for

2474
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:04,301
anything.
I mean,

2475
01:42:04,301 --> 01:42:09,040
how the fuck do you drop that guy down
four points with a perfect performance?

2476
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:10,720
Well,
I think for the fans it's like go check

2477
01:42:10,721 --> 01:42:13,150
it out.
Six verse 10 like it makes the more

2478
01:42:13,151 --> 01:42:14,640
mainstream like go look at six
[inaudible].

2479
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:17,560
That's the number six and the word verse
number 10 but he can't remember when

2480
01:42:17,561 --> 01:42:21,850
they didn't do reebok based off rankings
and even the fighters like what the fuck

2481
01:42:21,851 --> 01:42:24,340
are you talking about?
Those rankings and then even Dana was

2482
01:42:24,341 --> 01:42:24,581
like,
yeah,

2483
01:42:24,581 --> 01:42:25,960
that's some bullshit.
Yeah,

2484
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:29,530
Anderson versus your eye at hall is
going to be very interesting.

2485
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:32,230
That's in Brazil brother.
That's in May.

2486
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,200
That Brazil cards a motherfucker's
stats.

2487
01:42:36,010 --> 01:42:37,510
I heard the promo on.
It's sick too.

2488
01:42:37,511 --> 01:42:39,440
It's just a bunch of Brazilians
antelope.

2489
01:42:40,110 --> 01:42:41,770
That's an intense card,
man.

2490
01:42:41,830 --> 01:42:43,990
That's a very intense card.
Look at this.

2491
01:42:44,350 --> 01:42:48,700
I forgot about [inaudible].
Oh good Lord.

2492
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,410
Yeah,
look at that Brazil card.

2493
01:42:50,590 --> 01:42:52,900
Oh Shit.
Cyborg Leslie Smith.

2494
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:54,700
She deserves some sort of award.
Right?

2495
01:42:54,701 --> 01:42:58,180
Fucking now know she's fighting Cyborg.
He's going to rip your face off.

2496
01:42:58,181 --> 01:42:59,260
What?
Courage.

2497
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,540
Why they have Cyborg?
No picture on the left,

2498
01:43:01,541 --> 01:43:02,740
but a patient ready for it.

2499
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:05,380
They're not ready for it than not even
ready.

2500
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:09,040
Go back to the other card are the
Arlovski fight.

2501
01:43:09,041 --> 01:43:13,000
What was hard was outed as a motherfuck.
What card was the Arlovski fight on?

2502
01:43:13,700 --> 01:43:15,370
One fs.
One card.

2503
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:17,950
Ooh,
that's an interesting fight,

2504
01:43:17,951 --> 01:43:20,170
man.
And whenever I count or Lawsky out,

2505
01:43:20,171 --> 01:43:22,690
he comes back wins again like the
terminator.

2506
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:27,720
How many times has he been stopped since
sane number now it's like very high

2507
01:43:28,481 --> 01:43:30,430
number.
He's been stopped at gang at.

2508
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:33,160
Don't fight as long as he does and not,
especially at heavyweight.

2509
01:43:33,161 --> 01:43:35,520
And I get stopped.
Look at how many times it's overwritten.

2510
01:43:35,530 --> 01:43:38,110
Been stopped to look at that.
I've seen over him get with flat.

2511
01:43:38,111 --> 01:43:41,110
Look at Albert to Manav versus Gunnar
Nelson.

2512
01:43:41,170 --> 01:43:42,190
That's a great fun.
Ooh,

2513
01:43:42,191 --> 01:43:45,850
that's a good fight to went off as a
motherfucker.

2514
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:47,860
Damn.
Struve back.

2515
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:50,800
Big Foot.
Silva bigfoot and he's a figure it out.

2516
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,580
Now they have this drug test and it's
tough,

2517
01:43:52,581 --> 01:43:54,140
man.
Yeah.

2518
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:57,260
Yeah.
It's hard out there for a pimp is a

2519
01:43:57,261 --> 01:43:59,150
heavyweight.
See a lot of guys get stopped as part of

2520
01:43:59,151 --> 01:44:01,700
the game.
Who else is on this weekend?

2521
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:06,020
Go back to this weekend's card
that that Brazil cars.

2522
01:44:06,021 --> 01:44:07,990
Ridiculous.
Leslie Smith,

2523
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:10,760
that salty record,
eight and six sign up to fight Cyborg.

2524
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:15,300
I wonder how Cyborg is going to deal
with the one 40 cut her first time I

2525
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:20,340
dropped on onto one 40 inches faces off.
I think everyone should fucking run

2526
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:24,500
every girl in the divisions like fuck.
Well I hope they give her a one 45 pound

2527
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:26,000
division.
I think she deserves it.

2528
01:44:26,001 --> 01:44:28,790
They've had that division to Invicta.
It's an established division.

2529
01:44:28,791 --> 01:44:30,290
There's plenty of girls out there that
it will,

2530
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:34,520
that'll fight at one 45 and that way
she's not dying trying to make the

2531
01:44:34,521 --> 01:44:34,850
weight.

2532
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:38,300
She's a big girl man.
The thing is how many big girls are

2533
01:44:38,301 --> 01:44:39,860
there that they like?
Is it sustainable,

2534
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:42,170
sustainable?
Let's find out.

2535
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,990
Can you do that though?
Or Gina Carano did it and strike force.

2536
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:46,580
I mean that was the whole thing or a
lead Xc,

2537
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,680
right?
Was it strikeforce a leader because he

2538
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:51,260
is the leading city lead ECC.
That was her whole thing.

2539
01:44:51,261 --> 01:44:53,510
She was fighting one 45 Joe,
look at my face.

2540
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:55,310
I'm looking at your face.
You can build,

2541
01:44:55,670 --> 01:44:59,150
you can build a division around Gina
Carano and she looks like you can build

2542
01:44:59,151 --> 01:45:01,820
a division around Cyborg when she
smashing checks.

2543
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,160
You can.
I firmly believe you can build a

2544
01:45:04,161 --> 01:45:05,420
division around,
sign up for it.

2545
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:06,410
No,
you catch it.

2546
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:07,760
If she watched Tyson,
every,

2547
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:09,980
every little girl she runs into,
you can't do it.

2548
01:45:09,981 --> 01:45:11,390
You can do it.
I can do it.

2549
01:45:11,391 --> 01:45:15,590
And you and you have her keep talking
shit to everybody at one 35 it'll come

2550
01:45:15,591 --> 01:45:16,870
up to me if,
I mean,

2551
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,410
come on box tattoo.

2552
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:24,020
Come on dude.
She's a monster.

2553
01:45:24,021 --> 01:45:24,701
I like it.
Yes.

2554
01:45:24,701 --> 01:45:27,980
She's a mine.
Like I like getting me giving her a shot

2555
01:45:27,981 --> 01:45:31,520
at the 145 pound title maker.
She wanna have her fight this fight.

2556
01:45:31,521 --> 01:45:34,400
You gotta Fight Leslie Smith and
normally fights at one 35 you may get a

2557
01:45:34,401 --> 01:45:37,940
catch weight fight because leslie is
brave enough to take that challenge.

2558
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:40,930
But then we create a one 45 take some of
them in.

2559
01:45:40,931 --> 01:45:42,290
Victor Girls Agree.
Jo,

2560
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:43,330
I think,
I think you,

2561
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:46,880
what do you do with her then you make
you make her fight at one 40 we don't

2562
01:45:46,881 --> 01:45:49,010
even know how well her body is going to
handle that,

2563
01:45:49,230 --> 01:45:50,930
right?
Let's say she does decent though,

2564
01:45:50,931 --> 01:45:54,290
but all your superstars at one 35 so let
me just do these super fight.

2565
01:45:54,291 --> 01:45:58,250
The one 40 where Misha could be champ at
one 35 or one 40 right?

2566
01:45:58,251 --> 01:46:01,550
And you have this monster at one 40 but
at least she's fighting Misha tate and

2567
01:46:01,551 --> 01:46:03,860
getting that coverage of Ronda Rousey
and Holly Holm,

2568
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:04,160
right?

2569
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:08,870
If you do one 45 okay,
now we've got to find a 145 bad ass is

2570
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:10,370
at one 45 girls.
Well,

2571
01:46:10,371 --> 01:46:15,371
the real fight at one 40 is holly,
who's fought as high as I want to say.

2572
01:46:16,341 --> 01:46:19,420
She fought it like one 50 before inbox,
right?

2573
01:46:19,430 --> 01:46:24,430
At 1:50 AM one 52 so that would be the
fight because first of all,

2574
01:46:25,881 --> 01:46:30,200
she was without a doubt the most
experienced striker in all of the UFC.

2575
01:46:30,201 --> 01:46:34,910
It's women's divisions as far as boxing
competition and in a competition and

2576
01:46:34,911 --> 01:46:36,200
kickboxing.
I mean,

2577
01:46:36,201 --> 01:46:38,960
she's,
she's a 19 time boxing champion.

2578
01:46:38,961 --> 01:46:41,540
She's won kickboxing titles and she
wanted the UFC crown.

2579
01:46:41,550 --> 01:46:44,960
I think she's the only female in the UFC
who can beat Cyborg.

2580
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:47,870
See,
that would be a fance fascinating fight

2581
01:46:47,871 --> 01:46:50,010
because she's got that style of

2582
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:54,480
like counter striking and moving away
and almost a karate base with a lot of

2583
01:46:54,481 --> 01:46:57,930
athleticism and footwork.
And cyborg is just a destroyer.

2584
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:00,030
But what happens when you go forward on
Holly?

2585
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:04,290
You get fucking murderer.
So the girl like Cyborg coming forward

2586
01:47:04,291 --> 01:47:07,440
is tailor made for Holly.
All these other girls enjoy that.

2587
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:10,320
Maybe enjoy frank the tank Brazilian.
I just don't know.

2588
01:47:10,321 --> 01:47:12,300
Um,
I mean she's bigger and stronger.

2589
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:14,940
It's going to be an,
and she can take a punishment.

2590
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:18,330
She did a lot of punishment.
Do you see the [inaudible] barge fight

2591
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:19,710
in lion fight?
I did not.

2592
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:22,010
She fought Sharina.
Yeah,

2593
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:26,070
it was a fucking months.
She lost Cyborg gas boss' decision.

2594
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:27,480
Well she,
it Tko no,

2595
01:47:27,481 --> 01:47:30,600
she lost by decision,
but she got punted in the face.

2596
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:32,610
She got teeth,
face face.

2597
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:34,260
Barsh is no joke,
man.

2598
01:47:34,261 --> 01:47:36,810
She's one of the best Muay Thai fighters
on the planet world champ.

2599
01:47:36,810 --> 01:47:40,620
She's so slick.
Her style is so good and you know she

2600
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:43,170
has none of the physical attributes at
Cyborg has cyborgs,

2601
01:47:43,171 --> 01:47:45,660
just so strong and so powerful.
Again,

2602
01:47:45,661 --> 01:47:47,390
I think it's tailor made for Holly.
Every,

2603
01:47:47,391 --> 01:47:49,560
any other girl is fuck.
Interesting.

2604
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:51,480
I would like to see it.
I'll tell you that any other girls get

2605
01:47:51,481 --> 01:47:52,650
her titties ripped up.
I just,

2606
01:47:52,730 --> 01:47:55,290
I don't want to see,
this is what I don't want to see.

2607
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:59,910
I don't want to see cyborg fight
diminished so much from the weight cut

2608
01:47:59,911 --> 01:48:01,260
that we don't get to see the real
cyborg.

2609
01:48:01,290 --> 01:48:04,500
I don't these you've been bending enough
draw to create an entire division four

2610
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:08,980
and breathe out and try cause we're
trying to build up one 15 one 25 right?

2611
01:48:08,981 --> 01:48:11,790
I think there are 35 see I think if
anybody's going to do it,

2612
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:13,500
it's going to be a woman who knocks
women out.

2613
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:15,810
I think anybody's going to bring light
to the division.

2614
01:48:15,811 --> 01:48:17,310
It's going to be someone that just not
working.

2615
01:48:17,311 --> 01:48:17,761
She,
man,

2616
01:48:17,761 --> 01:48:19,470
if she was like,
how young prospect,

2617
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:23,040
I think you invest doesn't have to be
the level that she's adding comparison

2618
01:48:23,041 --> 01:48:24,990
to the level the other girls are at.
It's very,

2619
01:48:25,010 --> 01:48:27,990
it's very high.
The only thing that would change is if

2620
01:48:27,991 --> 01:48:31,200
one of those Moitai checks started
looking at Cyborg and went,

2621
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:32,520
Oh really?
Oh,

2622
01:48:32,521 --> 01:48:34,020
okay.
That'd be so okay.

2623
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:35,250
Okay,
well this is,

2624
01:48:35,251 --> 01:48:36,960
you know,
she's not going to take you down.

2625
01:48:36,961 --> 01:48:38,520
Most likely she's going to try to stand
with you.

2626
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:42,150
If these girls like really concentrate
on the grappling and they really

2627
01:48:42,151 --> 01:48:42,960
constant,
you know,

2628
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,880
six months sprawl training,
man,

2629
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:47,910
now we're years out from that.
Well maybe you got to invest.

2630
01:48:47,911 --> 01:48:49,950
If you're going to do it,
you got to invest in that whole trend.

2631
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:52,130
But look at a girl like tiff time bomb,
right?

2632
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:53,580
She's,
she's starting MMA now.

2633
01:48:53,581 --> 01:48:55,260
You know that strength.
Yeah.

2634
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:59,160
Well if you know,
during a prime like Miriam Knock Bodo

2635
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:04,200
like someone somewhat along those lines
when the really high level female Moy

2636
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,650
Thai champions,
they would be Merkin checks and mm sure.

2637
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:08,400
If they could just keep the fight
standing.

2638
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:12,090
Did there's levels out there and there's
levels of striking that we just really

2639
01:49:12,091 --> 01:49:14,840
haven't seen in the UFC.
And that's one of with a,

2640
01:49:14,841 --> 01:49:16,490
with some of the women fighters.
Um,

2641
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:19,620
but I think that's what we saw in the
bars fight with Cyborg.

2642
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:22,950
We saw that super,
super high level Moy Tai against the

2643
01:49:22,951 --> 01:49:26,700
marauding style of Cyborg.
And so I watched that fight and I said

2644
01:49:26,701 --> 01:49:27,391
two things.
I said,

2645
01:49:27,391 --> 01:49:31,350
one amazed at Cyborg has the guts to
take that fight because it's a dangerous

2646
01:49:31,351 --> 01:49:33,120
fight.
Nobody wanted to fight bars for like

2647
01:49:33,121 --> 01:49:34,800
three fucking years.
Couldn't get a fight.

2648
01:49:35,310 --> 01:49:39,510
And then how off the fact that signboard
takes tremendous punishment and keeps

2649
01:49:39,511 --> 01:49:43,080
going after I was thinking how many
other people in this division would

2650
01:49:43,081 --> 01:49:43,940
fight this girl?
I just,

2651
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:46,470
holly and,
and keep getting knocked down and keep

2652
01:49:46,471 --> 01:49:48,070
jumping back up and attacking.

2653
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:50,730
I agree.
Not a lot of female MMA fighters would

2654
01:49:50,731 --> 01:49:55,731
have been able to even stand in there.
[inaudible] only her striking kid bill.

2655
01:49:56,150 --> 01:49:58,700
She's literally the only one.
Every other girl with her head would

2656
01:49:58,701 --> 01:50:00,520
have been kicked into the,
and of course John Jay check.

2657
01:50:00,521 --> 01:50:02,450
But she's a smaller,
which is too small.

2658
01:50:02,451 --> 01:50:03,640
Yeah.
Yeah man.

2659
01:50:03,670 --> 01:50:06,270
I'd think a,
I think the 45 pound division man,

2660
01:50:06,271 --> 01:50:08,740
it could open it up.
Women Only having two division I think

2661
01:50:08,741 --> 01:50:10,360
is weak.
Right,

2662
01:50:10,830 --> 01:50:13,180
right.
But this is the time start to 45.

2663
01:50:13,210 --> 01:50:13,840
This is the,
oh,

2664
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:14,950
the inaugural fight.
Right.

2665
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:18,220
I'm not sidebar goes out puts on a show
against Leslie Smith,

2666
01:50:18,221 --> 01:50:20,340
knocks her face off or doesn't,
who knows?

2667
01:50:20,350 --> 01:50:23,200
She loses you don't have a decision,
but if she does,

2668
01:50:23,230 --> 01:50:24,340
if she wins,
right.

2669
01:50:24,670 --> 01:50:25,840
Boom.
You got to,

2670
01:50:25,841 --> 01:50:29,200
you got a cyborg fighting.
Someone legit for the championship.

2671
01:50:29,201 --> 01:50:31,420
Marla's Kuhn come,
comes over from INVICTA,

2672
01:50:31,421 --> 01:50:31,630
right?

2673
01:50:31,630 --> 01:50:32,441
She's in Victor,
right?

2674
01:50:32,441 --> 01:50:35,680
Yeah.
One 45 or is she bella tor now?

2675
01:50:36,910 --> 01:50:37,743
Oh,
she's to,

2676
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:39,380
that's right.
She has booked or her last fight.

2677
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:41,320
Isabelle scooped her up.
But uh,

2678
01:50:41,590 --> 01:50:42,423
I,
I,

2679
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:44,650
I don't think you can do that.
I think you have to,

2680
01:50:44,651 --> 01:50:46,300
uh,
you have to do a super fight with

2681
01:50:46,301 --> 01:50:49,600
Michelle or holly and keep that on.
You have to do a super fight with me.

2682
01:50:49,601 --> 01:50:50,140
Sure.
Holly,

2683
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:53,950
to create the buzz around cyborg cause
the average friends like who the fuck is

2684
01:50:53,951 --> 01:50:56,800
this girl ripping girls' faces?
There's another fight this weekend that

2685
01:50:56,801 --> 01:51:00,610
nobody is talking about.
Whitaker and the tall at your fight of

2686
01:51:00,611 --> 01:51:01,010
the night.

2687
01:51:01,010 --> 01:51:03,010
Ooh.
Robert Whitaker

2688
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:06,760
man looks sensational.
And his last fight against Uriah Hall,

2689
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:08,410
I was like,
Holy Shit.

2690
01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:10,750
This kid is throwing at your fight of
the night.

2691
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:12,460
He's a dangerous guy.
Interesting.

2692
01:51:12,461 --> 01:51:14,890
How,
what a change it's been for him going up

2693
01:51:14,891 --> 01:51:17,590
to one 85 he just looks so much
healthier.

2694
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:19,630
Way more powerful.
Way more powerful.

2695
01:51:19,631 --> 01:51:21,370
Way more confident.
Way more aggressive.

2696
01:51:21,371 --> 01:51:25,300
Just doesn't feel as diminished.
I think it was just too big for one 70

2697
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:28,120
and the towels a beast.
The talls fun to watch,

2698
01:51:28,121 --> 01:51:29,740
man.
Very dangerous man.

2699
01:51:29,741 --> 01:51:31,120
Real good.
You'd have to till the wind.

2700
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:32,920
Yeah.
And so gracie guy,

2701
01:51:33,370 --> 01:51:35,560
Dude Rodriguez though.
That's your young buck.

2702
01:51:35,561 --> 01:51:36,640
You're up and comer.
Young Bucks.

2703
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:39,100
Yeah.
Rodriguez and Andrew feely.

2704
01:51:39,101 --> 01:51:40,840
That's another fucking Badass fight.

2705
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:42,510
Ooh Wait,

2706
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:43,990
that's a very good fight,
man.

2707
01:51:43,991 --> 01:51:45,550
I love watching Rodriguez fight,
man.

2708
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,331
Yeah,
he's fun.

2709
01:51:46,331 --> 01:51:48,550
He's wild dude.
He's wild.

2710
01:51:48,610 --> 01:51:50,290
That guy throws,
why you ever seen him train?

2711
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:51,910
So Larry?
Yes.

2712
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:53,980
Uh,
well he was at Jackson's for a little

2713
01:51:53,981 --> 01:51:54,814
bit,
right?

2714
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:57,520
There's videos of him hitting pads,
dude.

2715
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:01,060
He does like three 60 roundhouse kicked
three 60.

2716
01:52:01,061 --> 01:52:03,940
We'll kick jumping front kick round,
kick side kick.

2717
01:52:03,941 --> 01:52:08,350
I mean the way he mixed his shit up.
It's like who does that in pad work?

2718
01:52:08,530 --> 01:52:11,110
But he does it like he fights.
Have you seen it yet?

2719
01:52:11,111 --> 01:52:14,650
Have you seen him go for like knee bars
and like let's fucking like flips to

2720
01:52:14,651 --> 01:52:15,680
tone dude,
it's fucked.

2721
01:52:15,681 --> 01:52:17,890
The future man.
His ground game is no joke cause

2722
01:52:17,900 --> 01:52:20,590
grabbing on the very good,
he's got everything going for him.

2723
01:52:20,591 --> 01:52:22,450
He's wild.
He's unpredictable.

2724
01:52:22,451 --> 01:52:23,710
He's young,
he's brash.

2725
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:26,080
Damn Andre threw up when I was
interviewing him.

2726
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:28,150
He threw up.
He's the only guy I've ever talked to.

2727
01:52:28,151 --> 01:52:30,880
Like in the middle of talking to him,
he threw up in his shirt a little bit

2728
01:52:30,881 --> 01:52:32,320
and then he threw up on the ground.
Damn.

2729
01:52:32,321 --> 01:52:34,540
It's that cardio son.
We had a crazy fight.

2730
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:37,180
It was a wild ass fight.
So that's a good fight.

2731
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:39,130
Then.
It'll be a fun card.

2732
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:42,160
They get the top bar is taking it to the
spotlight a little bit.

2733
01:52:42,370 --> 01:52:44,440
Yeah.
Well he definitely is and that's just to

2734
01:52:44,441 --> 01:52:46,060
be expected.
He's,

2735
01:52:46,061 --> 01:52:50,510
I mean he's the biggest star in the game
right now and I hope they work that out

2736
01:52:50,511 --> 01:52:52,980
for UFC 200 would be even better story
if it worked out.

2737
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:57,080
They do guarantee they do.
I would almost guarantee they do or they

2738
01:52:57,081 --> 01:53:00,200
do a GSP nate diaz fight.
Then we got honey dick and then some

2739
01:53:00,201 --> 01:53:02,330
smells fishy.
Something smells fishy for sure.

2740
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:04,190
If gsps like what the,
Hey,

2741
01:53:04,191 --> 01:53:07,490
I've been training or if they come with
the cash that come with that fucking

2742
01:53:07,491 --> 01:53:11,770
reebok makeup money.
I bet you I bet you a reebok that was a

2743
01:53:11,771 --> 01:53:16,771
set of reebok pumps and 6 million shit.
You go push it in for this shit in.

2744
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:20,000
We're all in for GSP.
I think a,

2745
01:53:20,001 --> 01:53:21,590
I bet they figured it out.
Yeah,

2746
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:23,660
I bet.
I Bet Yukon or ends up fighting in UFC

2747
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:24,523
200

2748
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,910
that's why.
That's what I believe in and that's,

2749
01:53:27,911 --> 01:53:30,790
I think Dana and the UFC brass is going
to figure it out.

2750
01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:33,910
I think GSP,
Nate Diaz takes its place and they use

2751
01:53:33,911 --> 01:53:37,090
it as a negotiating tool because the pay
per view numbers are bigger than any of

2752
01:53:37,091 --> 01:53:40,780
the connor fights because the UFC has in
fact grown through their strategy.

2753
01:53:41,650 --> 01:53:43,330
See,
I don't think the numbers beat Connors.

2754
01:53:43,390 --> 01:53:45,400
What if they do?
Well then you get then,

2755
01:53:45,430 --> 01:53:48,130
hey,
then connor's GSP and nate Diaz that

2756
01:53:48,131 --> 01:53:48,820
you're like,
Ooh,

2757
01:53:48,820 --> 01:53:49,950
connor fucked up.
Yeah,

2758
01:53:49,951 --> 01:53:53,320
I kind of fucked up.
I don't think you'd beat those numbers

2759
01:53:53,321 --> 01:53:56,200
though.
So osps best chance for this weekend.

2760
01:53:56,201 --> 01:53:59,080
He's got to win by knockout first round.
You think so?

2761
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:00,040
Yeah.
That first round,

2762
01:54:00,041 --> 01:54:02,080
he's going to have to fucking caution in
the wind.

2763
01:54:02,230 --> 01:54:06,070
If he tried to sit there and fight,
you know,

2764
01:54:06,071 --> 01:54:09,280
like on the outside and out technique,
John Jones,

2765
01:54:09,310 --> 01:54:11,770
you're going to get fucked up.
That's going to be interesting to see

2766
01:54:11,771 --> 01:54:14,410
John with such a long layoff too,
with a lot of pressure on them.

2767
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:16,540
But I mean you,
this is what I think's going to happen.

2768
01:54:16,541 --> 01:54:18,310
It's just me speculating,
I think,

2769
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:22,330
and I've trained with both of them.
I think John Will.

2770
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:25,690
They'll feel each other out early on.
John's going to get ahold of them,

2771
01:54:25,691 --> 01:54:28,540
trip them down the ground,
crucify him and tk on with elbows.

2772
01:54:28,830 --> 01:54:31,490
Wow.
Wow.

2773
01:54:31,590 --> 01:54:33,760
I had to bet on,
I bet John Finch to them on the ground.

2774
01:54:34,090 --> 01:54:36,280
Really?
All right.

2775
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:37,510
You heard it here,
folks,

2776
01:54:37,810 --> 01:54:41,860
this weekend.
UFC One 97 brandon schaub fighter and

2777
01:54:41,861 --> 01:54:46,861
the kid.com f fat t k three d.com t fat
k three d.

2778
01:54:47,711 --> 01:54:49,850
That's the new one yet.
The final a kid three.

2779
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:51,650
Your your videos that you guys are

2780
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:52,900
Yeah.
How was that?

2781
01:54:52,901 --> 01:54:53,734
It's a fun.
Oh,

2782
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:54,700
the best.
Go Watch it.

2783
01:54:54,701 --> 01:54:55,750
You fucks.
Yeah.

2784
01:54:55,780 --> 01:54:56,411
All right.
Uh,

2785
01:54:56,411 --> 01:55:00,400
I'll be back in a little bit with
another one.

2786
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:02,040
That's right.
You're a beast,

2787
01:55:02,050 --> 01:55:03,250
not in podcast.
Love you,

2788
01:55:03,251 --> 01:55:04,084
brother.
Dan Auerbach.

2789
01:55:04,650 --> 01:55:05,020
Excuse me.
