00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,540
Hello Ladies and gentlemen and,
and people that prefer to be genderless.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,090
If you one of those,
this is a new era,

3
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:12,300
we have to be super sensitive to
everybody. That's what queer is, right?

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,110
You're like, I'm this,
I'm that. Um, it um,

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,670
this episode is brought
to you by Ting Tang is a,

6
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,070
I have a new tank phone by the way.
I just got it.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,100
This is the official cell phone of this
podcast and I got the Samsung Galaxy s

8
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:33,870
five, which has a heart rate monitor
built in young Jamie right there.

9
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:36,240
You put your finger,
it tells you shit about yourself,

10
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:40,170
like you're fat or you're not fat or
you're fucking awesome or you're going to

11
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:42,890
die. And uh, tracks
all sorts. It's like a,

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,210
there's a fit program that comes with it.
It's dope.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,860
I am officially a phone whore though.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,140
My third phone this year that makes
me a phone horse and you know, how's,

15
00:00:50,141 --> 00:00:54,930
it's only only August, but I
love technology. I love it.

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,270
Um,
what Ting is,

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,720
is a mobile service that
uses the sprint backbone.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,560
And what they do is they use
sprint but you don't go by sprints.

19
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:09,360
Rules go by tings, rules and tings.
Rules are incredibly beneficial to you.

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,040
A 98% of people would save money
with tank and they have no contracts,

21
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:18,330
no early termination fees,
no nothing,

22
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:22,050
no bullshit. And you also don't
pay a flat rate per month,

23
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,180
which I like because most of the time
you don't use all your minutes and it's

24
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:29,580
kind of ridiculous. You know,
you pay for 120 minutes,

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,650
use 90 what happens is other 30 minutes,

26
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,850
nothing that they're gone there in the
ether next month, new cycle, 120 minutes.

27
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:38,220
Again,
Tim doesn't do it that way with Tang,

28
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:41,970
you pay for what you use and I think
it's the smartest way to do it.

29
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:46,860
They have incredibly high rates ratings
rather if you look online as far as like

30
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,200
people that use ting, how much they
loved them, they're like they're,

31
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,710
they're applauded left and right and
it's because the ethics of the company to

32
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:59,130
extremely intelligent group of people
that put together this plan. They said,

33
00:01:59,131 --> 00:01:59,821
you know what?
We can,

34
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:02,040
you could still make a lot of
money without fucking people over.

35
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,570
And that's what they decided to do.

36
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,770
A $21 is the average monthly
bill per device for 10 customers.

37
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,750
It's pretty sweet.
Um,

38
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,360
and they have all of the latest
and greatest android phones.

39
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:16,410
Like this one that I have right here,
which is the Samsung Galaxy s five,

40
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:20,140
which is, it's pretty dope. It's
beautiful big five inch screen.

41
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:22,410
It's awesome for going online and shit,

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,520
but they have all the android phones and
when you buy them from Tang, you own it.

43
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,900
It's yours.
That's it.

44
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,930
If you're a cheapskate and you
don't like spend a lot of money,

45
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:34,270
you can get an iPhone four
for just 95 bucks. Um,

46
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,030
if you want to get the top of the line,

47
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,840
you can get an iPhone five for only 250
bucks. And when you pay that 250 bucks,

48
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:40,710
you actually own it.

49
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,250
When you buy a phone from most companies
and say if you buy a phone and the

50
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:48,900
phone says to 99, it's not really two 99
what it is, it's probably like 600 bucks,

51
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:52,710
but you pay off the other 300 bucks
over time. So if you try to cancel,

52
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,880
they hit you with this fee.

53
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:58,830
So what the fee is is every month they
just tack on a little of the price of the

54
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:03,070
phone to your bill. That's kind
of stupid in my id, in my eyes.

55
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:05,410
It's kind of ridiculous.
You don't need to do it that way.

56
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,840
And if you do it through Tang, you
just buy the phone, you own it,

57
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,880
cancel when you want and
then be done with it. Uh,

58
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,480
and if you go to rogan.ting.com you
can save 25 bucks off of any of these

59
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,710
beautiful devices. Uh, it's an
ethical company in awesome company.

60
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,830
They have a great service.

61
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,860
The sprint backbone is a
fantastic network and you know,

62
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,020
it's not like you're using a
mom and pop cell phone company.

63
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:27,580
You're using one of the major providers,

64
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,480
you're using the same service that you
get with sprint, but with tings, rules.

65
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,250
I love it.
And again,

66
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:37,990
it is the official cell phone of this
podcast and got one right in front of me,

67
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,800
rogan.ting.com and that is
the only commercial today.

68
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,810
How about them apples, bitches,
Abby Martins here. Why fuck around.

69
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,760
Cue The music.
Young Jamie,

70
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,220
the Joe Rogan experience by day
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

71
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,083
So

72
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,720
Mrs Rogan sends me this video,
she goes, uh, have you seen this?

73
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:10,520
Like what do you think about Gaza?
What's going on with Gaza? What did,

74
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,770
what do you,
what is your take on this?

75
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:14,500
And she sends me a
video of you and I said,

76
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:19,501
that's my friend Abby Martin who
took this very controversial stance.

77
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,790
And um, it's, it's a tricky
situation, isn't it? Like Gaza is,

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,060
first of all,
it's sad and depressing and disgusting,

79
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,400
but it's also very tricky because
there's all this weird biases that,

80
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,440
that are going on left and right.
You know,

81
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,300
there's the United States has this weird
bias where they're criticizing Israel

82
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:41,830
and Israel is like, Hey, fuck heads,

83
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,090
didn't you guys bomb the shit out
of Iraq and you bomb the shit out of

84
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:49,600
Afghanistan. You guys are talking
about innocent civilians being killed.

85
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:50,620
Like what about you?

86
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,970
And then there's also people on the
Palestinian side that think it's just

87
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:57,130
fucking horrendous what Israel is doing.

88
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,370
And then there's people on the
Israeli side that thank Hamas,

89
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:05,170
just signed the peace treaty and stop
training suicide bombers. You know,

90
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,850
there's an,
in my opinion,

91
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:10,960
when I look at it and I am obviously
not qualified to be some sort of a

92
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:15,370
political analysts, but when I look at
it, I try to look at it objectively.

93
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:17,560
The whole thing looks
like a just a disaster,

94
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,920
like a huge humanitarian disaster.

95
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,360
I think it's one of the largest
humanitarian issues in the world today.

96
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,000
And I think that we're going to
look back in 50 years and um,

97
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,520
really just criticize how abominable the
entire situation is and the fact that

98
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:36,690
the world, the world isn't turning a
blind eye, the US is turning a blind eye.

99
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,620
Um, you know, you say that the,
I took a controversial position,

100
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:44,280
but really it isn't controversial in
my mind because I'm looking at this

101
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:48,090
oppressed population that's in
prisoned. When I grew up, Joe,

102
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,190
I didn't even know first
of all what Palestine was.

103
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:53,010
And then when finally when I learned
about the Israeli Palestinian conflict,

104
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:54,510
even though it's really one sided,
um,

105
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:57,620
I started to learn about
what Gaza actually is.

106
00:05:57,621 --> 00:06:01,310
And I think a lot of people don't even
understand when they hear the word Gaza

107
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:02,360
what they're talking about,

108
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,550
it's really what we're talking
about is an open air prison.

109
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,830
45 mile strip of land completely closed
off. Egypt's close their borders,

110
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:14,570
cc's just fucking sucking the Dick of
Netanyahu totally working together.

111
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,190
Netanyahu's shut off. The IDF is
closed off all the other boarders.

112
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,810
It's totally under siege.

113
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,260
There's 1.8 million people
living in that close quarters.

114
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,870
It's one of those densely
populated places on earth.

115
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:31,640
So whenever you have this
bombing campaign, people
are going to die and mass,

116
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,680
and when they say that
they're using human shields,

117
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,450
that's complete fucking bullshit.

118
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:38,840
I haven't seen one shred of evidence to
prove that they're using human shields

119
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:39,411
and fact,

120
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:44,411
if you look back at the last 60
years of US military conflicts,

121
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:47,900
they've used that term to demonize
populations whenever they want to make it

122
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:50,120
seem like this population
doesn't value human life.

123
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:52,940
You're telling me Palestinians
don't value their child's life,

124
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,310
that they're going to throw
their kids out in guard missiles.

125
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,580
All I've seen is cartoons from,
from Netanyahu,

126
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:02,330
these infographics that show
people standing on a house
with missiles underneath

127
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,680
total fucking bullshit. This place
has been under siege for years. Yes.

128
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:10,520
They may have said that they pulled their
troops out in 2007 it's under siege.

129
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:13,430
They, the Israeli health
official said that there,

130
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,620
they've tried to put them on a diet so
they only allow basic staples in they

131
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:22,070
claim because they didn't want the
Palestinians to be making weapons. Pasta,

132
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:25,700
paper, chocolate,
anesthetics, wheelchairs.

133
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,370
This is the shit that people
can't get inside Gaza.

134
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,200
They're keeping them gluten free.

135
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,180
It's been shown to reduce hostility.
The,

136
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,980
there was a documentary once
on suicide bombings and uh,

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,090
they had this Palestinian school and they
had the sign over the school that said

138
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:45,460
today's children are
tomorrow's holy martyrs.

139
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,900
And they had this child that was strapped
up with a c four and they had this

140
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:54,490
picture of this kid that had died in a
suicide bombing and they were praising

141
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:58,840
him like he was some sort of
a, you know, a saint, you know,

142
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,630
cause he died executing this.

143
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,390
So we'll just take,

144
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,670
we praise soldiers who go and drop white
phosphorous from plane. You know what,

145
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:10,510
what's more manly? Like when
you're, when you're driven to zero,

146
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:13,750
when you have nothing left,
that's when people blow themselves up.

147
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:15,370
It's not because it's
a culture of martyrdom,

148
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:19,120
it's because they have fucking nothing
and they don't have the industrial

149
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:21,460
warfare capabilities to
drop depleted uranium.

150
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,330
Right. Yeah. I'm certainly
not taking a side. Right.

151
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,740
But what I'm saying is that it's a,
it's an incredibly complicated situation.

152
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,790
Like A, I don't know
what, what Israel do to,

153
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,120
to like alleviate tension
to this point once,

154
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:42,100
like how many thousands of people have
died so far over 1500 at this 1500.

155
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,940
She's just Christ. 30%
children. I've seen photos.

156
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:50,710
Anthony Bordain tweeted some awful photo
of these children on the beach that had

157
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:54,970
been bombed and one kid was dad and
the other kid was being carried away,

158
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,740
most likely dead. It looked like by all
the blood and everything. It was just,

159
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,420
it's, it's so depressing.
It's so awful. And if you,

160
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:08,010
if you could objectively
stop the whole scene and say,

161
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,960
what is a way to fix this?
What is a way to alleviate this,

162
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:16,110
this horrible conflict?
What is it? Is there a way?

163
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,380
Well, I think up until now people have
been saying that two state solutions a

164
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:22,280
possibility or you had the Palestinian
Authority working with the Israeli

165
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:23,930
government.
Hamas has negotiated before.

166
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:26,990
It's not that they're
like ignoring Israel. Um,

167
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,990
and of course there's a lot of problems
with the moss and I'm not gonna sit here

168
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:32,240
and apologize for them.
They're really, I don't,

169
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:34,940
I don't agree with anything
that they want to see happen,

170
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:40,040
but I understand why Palestinians have
aligned themselves with this group

171
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,310
because the Palestinian Authority failed
so much and they could pitch related so

172
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:43,971
much to Israel.

173
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:47,090
So they basically turned to the more
militant faction of the leadership saying,

174
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,330
fucking do something.
At least you guys are resisting.

175
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,780
Because to them it's an occupation and
under the UN charter it's an occupation

176
00:09:53,781 --> 00:09:54,614
as well.

177
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,180
A lot of people say the one state solution
is the only possibility which is end

178
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,720
the apartheid state give Palestinians
equal rights because right now there's

179
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:05,690
different laws if you're Arab,
that's what Israel is.

180
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,380
It's a Jewish state and they've driven
out people who are not Jewish and they're

181
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:13,580
ethnically cleansing them. It's a
fucking disaster, man. It's really scary.

182
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:16,820
And I don't actually blame Israelis
because you're growing up in Israel,

183
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,021
first of all,

184
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:21,110
they think that they're the chosen
people because the Bible says so,

185
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,780
which is disturbing in itself.
But second of all,

186
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:27,290
if you're growing up in Israel and you
do hear the sirens all the time and you

187
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:30,170
fucking think you're being told that
these people are terrorists and they want

188
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:34,430
to kill you. Right? Um, so I mean,
I don't blame it and, and, but,

189
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,730
but honestly Israel has much more
fair media coverage. They have hearts.

190
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:39,620
They have nine seven
two mag here in America.

191
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:41,330
We're treated like fucking children.

192
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,330
We aren't told the context
of the situation whatsoever.

193
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:47,600
All we're told is Hamas
terrorists keep firing it.

194
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:50,210
Israel and Israel has the
right to self defense.

195
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,210
Well,
in all fairness,

196
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:55,140
this is a topic that's really too
complicated for the news in quotes.

197
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,440
You're not going to get in a fox seven
minute sound bite in between commercials.

198
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:01,920
This is something that's
incredibly complex and really
should be like a three or

199
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:04,680
four hour documentary just
to scratch the surface.

200
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,890
And I don't know if,
I mean,

201
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,490
I guess if you call yourself the news,

202
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,710
there's a responsibility,

203
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,790
at least an implied responsibility to
educate when it comes to a situation like

204
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,624
this.

205
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,690
But to try to cover it on Fox News
or on CNN and to try to like give an

206
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:28,620
understanding to the people
viewing it seems almost impossible,

207
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,840
but they also just only do pro Israel
minus like that's why I did that video.

208
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:34,550
Why doesn't the media care
about dead Palestinians?

209
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:37,520
Because up until there was like hundreds
of Palestinians that had died already

210
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:39,590
and the news was still
making it seem like,

211
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,750
like literally every single headline was
just like three Israeli soldiers died,

212
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,570
400 others and you're like,
who are others?

213
00:11:47,571 --> 00:11:49,760
Palestinians like human beings like fuck.

214
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:51,500
Are these people or would
just be like Israel's,

215
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,230
you know Hamas rockets have Israel
on edge. It's like, yeah, they had,

216
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,200
they might have Israel on edge,

217
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:59,860
but people are fucking like dying and
getting dismembered and getting blown up

218
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,050
like from bombs and all this
cease fire Shit, man. Look,

219
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,500
Aye, you're invading a country.
They are invading Gaza.

220
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:11,560
Netanyahu also said it doesn't matter,
ceasefire fire or not,

221
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,380
they're going to go through with the
invasion and destroyed the tunnels.

222
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,920
The tunnels are not just
used to store rockets.

223
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:19,240
The tunnels are used to
smuggle food into Gaza.

224
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:22,570
The tunnels are used to smuggle people
out to try to get them into Egypt because

225
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,500
they're wounded and injured on the news.
It is disgusting.

226
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:30,880
I've never seen anything so discussing
in my life than the bias toward Israel on

227
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:34,930
the media. And I know I'm called so many
names because I'm pointing this out,

228
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:39,010
but to me it's very obvious. My friend
right here, she's from South Africa.

229
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,210
She fucking, you know, she grew
up in a culture of post apartheid.

230
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,440
And we're living in a world where
an apartheid state exists right now.

231
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,760
And because of this tight allegiance
with the u s the u s supplies over $3

232
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,990
billion a year,
and just weaponry,

233
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,670
we're continuing to give more weapons
to Israel unless the US says something,

234
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,930
nothing's going to change.
And because it's this Jewish state,

235
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:04,300
if you criticize it,
then you must hate Jewish people.

236
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,760
And that's the problem is this rhetoric.

237
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,270
And it's so hard to break through
and to explain to people, look,

238
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,150
because I'm criticizing the government
doesn't mean that I hate the population.

239
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:16,360
I love all human beings.
I just want them to have sovereignty,

240
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:17,740
independence and equal rights.

241
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:18,481
Well,

242
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:23,481
there's also this undeniable problem
with having an area like that in what the

243
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:28,800
problem is, is that they're going to
be children that are born in that area,

244
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,000
that have no history of conflict
whatsoever, and they're fucked.

245
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,050
They're fucked.

246
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,050
This is where they live now and they're
treated as the enemy and they're born

247
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:43,380
into that and there's no chance to break
that cycle. And that sort of a scenario.

248
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,210
If you have a closed border,

249
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:49,380
you have a closed in population and
you have this demonized population,

250
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,870
there's no chance to break that struggle.
I mean,

251
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:55,590
if you're a child and you're born in
Palestine, what the fuck are the options?

252
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,590
Where are you going?
What's going on your,

253
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,290
and what are the ideologies that you're
confronted with constantly left and

254
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,700
right when you've got Hammas,

255
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,770
you've got all these Palestinian
organizations that want
to fight against Israel

256
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:09,540
and,
and you know you're growing.

257
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,590
You're growing up in this state
of perpetual conflict with it.

258
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,670
It doesn't seem like there's any
resolution that's conceivable. It's,

259
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,650
it's a terrible,
terrible tragedy.

260
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:24,060
It as far as like the wasted human
potential of the children that are born.

261
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:27,990
They're the people that are forced to
grow up in that environment as opposed to

262
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:31,680
Israel where they could just fucking
fly out and leave and live there.

263
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:34,920
And you know, I mean,
I, I'm not, you know,

264
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,070
I'm 100% against war. 100%.
Um, I don't think that wars,

265
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,480
the option here. I don't think
it's correct. I don't think,

266
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,770
I never think it's correct.
The only time it's ever,

267
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,620
I think the only time the military
should ever be used is when there's an

268
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,400
obvious threat.

269
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,040
You got some isis crazy
fucks are something that are
invading in a country and

270
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,090
having mass executions like what we're,
we're dealing with right now in Iraq.

271
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,360
That to me is a way clear example of
something that probably needs some fucking

272
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:08,900
military tension than anything that they
use to justify going to war with Iraq

273
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:13,340
in the first place. Like what they've
created in this vacuum is way scarier.

274
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,270
We're pulling out now while it's not
our problem. No, that's a real problem.

275
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,290
This is a real problem with you.
Fuckers. Did as you created a problem,

276
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,010
you created a power vacuum and now there's
a real problem because now you've got

277
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,230
militants who are so militant that
regular Islam is not militant enough for

278
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:33,170
them. They're blown up mosques.
These fuckers are blowing up.

279
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,870
Like these got training from the Syrian

280
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,180
holes that we gave them.

281
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,690
So it's like we embolden the Syrian
rebels that were aligned with this really

282
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:44,050
radical faction of Islam and then they
join up with Isis and now they're going

283
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:46,060
back to fucking Iraq. And
you're like, what in the hell?

284
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,910
This is why we shouldn't get involved.

285
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,190
This is why we shouldn't go
inject democracy in places
that are completely on a

286
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:53,860
different evolutionary
path of, you know, culture.

287
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,840
Duncan and I had dinner last night after
the show and we were talking about this

288
00:15:56,841 --> 00:15:58,160
and we're both like shaking her head.

289
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:02,600
And one of the things that we kept coming
to is like when ever you have military

290
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:05,000
action,
whenever you kill a thousand people,

291
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,630
you don't just kill a thousand people.
You also make widows,

292
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,580
you make loved ones who hate the
lost their friends and family.

293
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:17,830
And there's just this, this culture of
hate that just never goes away. It's,

294
00:16:17,831 --> 00:16:20,630
it's as long as the, yeah, as
long as those people are alive,

295
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,250
this cycle is just ingrained in them
on both sides, on the Israeli side,

296
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,400
on the Palestinian side, it's just
horrific. And it's almost like this,

297
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:32,030
this process that's
impossible to completely stop.

298
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,070
Like once the blood is shed, like,
fuck man. It's like, you know,

299
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:38,770
it just, it creates, this is

300
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,540
unfixable problem. I see it and it, okay.

301
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,320
So we created this Jewish state, the US
help create this Jewish state Israel. Um,

302
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,920
then there was, you know, the anti
photos and then they had their borders.

303
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:56,921
And basically what's happened is that
Israel has continued to encroach and if

304
00:16:57,261 --> 00:16:58,780
you look at the math,
there's like this map.

305
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,750
This is very famous picture of these four
factions of how Israel has encroached

306
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:06,200
more and more in Palestine. And now
it just closed off. More and more.

307
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:08,660
Gaza's just shrunk to about this big.

308
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:13,100
The westbank has shrunk to about this big
and they continue to build settlements

309
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,840
against international law.

310
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:20,210
They've violated all of these
like international treaties
to continue doing this

311
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:24,170
because more and more settlers are going
over there and, and making a home base,

312
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,240
demolishing homes left and right.
Um, so if you look at the conflict,

313
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,610
it depends on when you
want to start the clock.

314
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,790
You can start it with the kidnappings,
which Hamas actually didn't do in Israel,

315
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,570
had to admit to that.

316
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,400
Or you can start with the two kids that
were executed on camera by IDF soldiers

317
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,420
weeks prior to that.

318
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,660
Or You could start with fucking 50 years
ago or you could start with fucking

319
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,950
3000 years ago. I mean, when, when you
want to start the conflict or the clock,

320
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,840
the conflict and not really all depends
on the context of the situation,

321
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:54,660
but when people say like, well,
you're fucking shooting rockets at us,

322
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,250
what do you think we're going to do?

323
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,910
The problem is you have to understand
why they're shooting rockets and no one

324
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:00,960
wants to talk about that.

325
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:04,110
And no one wants to talk about how if
you have a helpless population under

326
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,230
section 51 under the UN Charter,

327
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,640
that if you're getting fucking peddled
with industrial warfare and you don't

328
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:14,130
have an army and your help
us population being occupied,

329
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:18,540
you do have the right to defend
yourself. That's the UN. Um, I'm not,

330
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,570
I abhor violence on either side and I
completely condemn shooting rockets into

331
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:26,100
civilian populations and uh,
trying to kill people.

332
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,520
But I do understand the
resistance movement.

333
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:32,730
I do understand people aligning
with Hamas because look,

334
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:33,810
they're under fucking siege.

335
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,070
And if I didn't have basic
amenities and if I saw my home,

336
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,430
like my neighbor's homes
getting demolished all my
life and I five fucking saw

337
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:45,570
people getting shot and beat the shit
out of all my Palestinian friends friends

338
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:49,650
here who have left Palestine
over the years, their stories
are just unbelievable.

339
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:53,880
One of them's brother was beaten to death
by the IDF when he was 16 because he

340
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:57,660
threw a stone. The other one lost
six family members and one bombing.

341
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:01,650
And I'm just like, how the fuck do
you guys go on? And they're like,

342
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,630
just surviving. Is our resistance
just living as our resistance? I mean,

343
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,020
I,
and everyone has a story like that.

344
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,900
The end, there's incredible
biases. Um, on the side of the,

345
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:15,780
the pro Israel side. Like, I've,

346
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:20,781
I've seen some videos that make you just
go w w w what the Dennis Prager one is

347
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:24,480
the most egregious if you ever seen
them. Now what is it? We'll play.

348
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:27,000
It will play it because
it's quite fascinating.

349
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,190
I'm Dennis Prager on
the Palestine, um, uh,

350
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:34,380
Israeli conflict.
It's like he,

351
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,880
he breaks it down in this way
that like, uh, it's, it's very,

352
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:43,830
it's a highly criticized video.
Um, in a nutshell. Yes. Yes.

353
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,010
Let's play it.
Let's do it because it's a,

354
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,400
it's one of those ones where
you're like, okay, come on man. Uh,

355
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,850
well I'll, I'll, we'll
play it here. You got it.

356
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,990
Because it's something that you can't
really describe without actually,

357
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,570
cause Dennis Prager is this like serious,
conservative Jewish Fella, right?

358
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,500
Prager university. By the way, you can't
have Prager university. You're fuck,

359
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,670
you know, you're not a God damn
professor of a university that you,

360
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:11,650
Oh,

361
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,600
a Prager university is you give us five
minutes and we'll give you a semester.

362
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,070
Well, I took many more stories on the
question of the Middle East conflict.

363
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:23,340
I was at the Middle East Institute.
In fact, that Columbia University,

364
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:27,930
that's where I did my graduate work
semester after semester discussing the

365
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:31,770
Middle East conflict as if it were the
most complex conflict in the world,

366
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,840
when in fact it's probably the easiest
conflict in the world to describe.

367
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,300
It may be the hardest to solve,

368
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,770
but it really is the easiest
to describe kill all Muslims.

369
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:45,210
And really in a nutshell,
this is what it is.

370
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,280
Israel would like to and recognizes
the right of the Palestinians to have a

371
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:52,390
state. The Palestinians, however,

372
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:56,890
and many other Muslims and Arabs do not
recognize the right of a Jewish state of

373
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:57,970
Israel to exist.

374
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:03,330
Every poll among Palestinians shows that
the majority of Palestinians want there

375
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:08,491
to be no Jewish state of Israel doesn't
believe that it should exist or had any

376
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:10,360
basis for being.

377
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,750
And this has been true since 1948 when
the British left and the UN established

378
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,500
eight division Palestine will be
cut in half Jewish half and an Arab.

379
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:23,470
Half the Jews accepted it.
The Arabs didn't accept it.

380
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,690
And what happened the
moment it was announced,

381
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,340
Arab armies about seven Arab armies
attacked the Jewish state in order to

382
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:34,150
destroy it. To everybody's surprise,
the little Jewish state survive.

383
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,920
And that was pretty much it.

384
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:41,310
And then it happened again in 1967 when
the dictator of Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser

385
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,280
said, we are now going to extinguish
the Jewish state of Israel.

386
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,350
And Jordan joined him and Syria
joined him, but Israel attack first.

387
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,630
And so Israel survive.

388
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,450
And that is how Israel and only that way
came to occupy what was called the West

389
00:21:58,841 --> 00:21:59,830
Bank of Jordan,

390
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,630
where many Palestinians live because
many Palestinians lived in that part of

391
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:08,890
Jordan. So the war was over in
67 and a lot of the Arabs do.

392
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,420
The Arab states all went to Khartoum
Sudan and announced no recognition,

393
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,360
no peace and no negotiations.

394
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:19,510
The three famous knows what
was Israel supposed to do.

395
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,070
Then Israel made an agreement to give
the entire Sinai peninsula and area of

396
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:29,071
land bigger than Israel with oil back to
Egypt because they said they would make

397
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:31,300
peace with Israel.

398
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,560
Israel gives territory back for
peace and it will always do that,

399
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:40,480
but is there really a desire for
peace on the part of Israel's enemies,

400
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:45,630
which broadcast after broadcast on TV
and radio and the Palestinian areas is

401
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:51,211
about how Jews should be killed and
how a law once a Jews to be killed.

402
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,810
That's the typical broadcast
on Palestinian television,

403
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,860
so it's not hard to explain
the Middle East dispute.

404
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,580
One side wants the other debt.
You know what the motto of Hamas is?

405
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,860
The motto of Hamas is we love death
as much as the Jews love life.

406
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,460
Now you tell me how was this real
supposed to make peace when people believe

407
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,500
what? Hamas beliefs. Oh
God, where do I start now?

408
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:20,620
Here is one of the most important
thing nobody talks about.

409
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,170
Everybody talks about a Palestinian state.

410
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,260
Why didn't anybody talk
about a Palestinian state
while the Palestinians lived

411
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:28,390
on the Jordanian rule?

412
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,340
Because the truth is people started
talking about a Palestinian state once the

413
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:38,341
Palestinians were under Israeli rule
because it was always a way to destroy the

414
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:42,910
Jewish state of Israel and I saved you
were state because that's what it is.

415
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,750
There are many, many Arab states,
but there was only one Jewish state.

416
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:50,210
It is about the size of New Jersey.
In fact,

417
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,170
Israel is the size of El Salvador,
El Salvador,

418
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,840
and yet if a Martian came to the earth
and they visited the United Nations

419
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,720
newspapers or watched
the world television,

420
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:07,910
they would believe that the
biggest problem on earth
is a state the size of New

421
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,820
Jersey and El Salvador.
This state of Israel,

422
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:16,270
this preoccupation with a little
democratic humane state is absolutely

423
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:19,910
irrational.
And here's another question to be asking.

424
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,320
If Israel tomorrow put down its arms
and said, we will fight no more,

425
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,310
what would happen if the Arab
countries around Israel said,

426
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:33,260
we will fight no more. We put down our
arms. What would happen in the first case?

427
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,730
There would be an immediate destruction
of the state of Israel with mass murder

428
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:38,780
of the Jews of Israel.

429
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:43,730
In the second scenario I presented where
the Arabs put down their arms and said,

430
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:48,800
we just want peace. They would be
the next Wednesday. The fact is,

431
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:53,690
as I said at the outset,
it is a very simple problem to describe.

432
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:58,100
One side wants the other
debt and if they didn't,

433
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,880
there would be peace and
yet please remember this.

434
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:07,570
There has never been never in the history
of the world a state in that area,

435
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,890
in what is called geographically
Palestine that was not Jewish.

436
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:18,430
Israel is the third autonomous
Jewish state to exist in that area.

437
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,440
There was never on autonomous Arab state.

438
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,150
There was never an autonomous Muslim
state. There was never an autonomous,

439
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,390
any other state.
That's the issue.

440
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,900
Why can't a little state the size of
El Salvador that calls itself Israel be

441
00:25:35,811 --> 00:25:40,250
allowed to exist? That in a
nutshell is the Middle East problem.

442
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,450
I'm Dennis Prager.

443
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,430
Dennis Prager is a Douche bag.

444
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,220
I love how he's like, um, okay,

445
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:51,310
so you have all these Arab states
and this is the only Jewish state.

446
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,840
Arab isn't a fucking religion
idiot Jewish state. Yeah,

447
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:57,250
you have an Islamic state of Iran,

448
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:59,200
but are you going to really
compare the fucking too,

449
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:01,360
if you're claiming that Israel is the
only democracy in the Middle East,

450
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:04,270
are you really comparing yourself
to Iran and all these other like,

451
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:09,070
I mean it's just amazing that he just
said that. That's insane also. Sure.

452
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,920
There's absolutely people
who hate Jewish people.

453
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:14,110
There's calls for genocide on that side,

454
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,990
but there's also calls for genocide
and the Israeli cabinet as well.

455
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:19,990
Some woman just said that
all Palestinians should die.

456
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,190
Times of Israel just published
a piece justifying genocide.

457
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:27,040
They actually said when justify
when genocide is permissible.

458
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,790
This was just published
yesterday, taken down, um,

459
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,200
in a couple of hours because of
the backlash. But you have this,

460
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,760
this rhetoric coming from both sides,

461
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:38,761
but I only see one side actually doing
the genocide carrying out genocide.

462
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:43,120
Um, one side is doing the
killing the other side. Yes.

463
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,590
Hamas charter may say that
Israel should seize to exist.

464
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:49,440
I don't know if that's like
a mistranslation in Arabic
of just saying the state

465
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,860
should be dissolved, but I know that
they missed translated document.

466
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:57,240
Dennis shod saying wipe Israel off the
map. He never actually said that. Um,

467
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:57,781
he just,

468
00:26:57,781 --> 00:27:01,530
he said like the borders should like
Israel as a state shouldn't be there as a

469
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:05,100
Jewish state. He didn't say fucking
wipe them off the map, killed them all.

470
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,170
That was a mistranslation.

471
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,390
And of course you just hear that
repeated ad nauseum no matter what. Um,

472
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,890
one other thing that's just really
ridiculous is this other Israeli cabinet

473
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:16,860
official just said that Palestinians
are committing self genocide.

474
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,030
That every time the Palestinian child
dies it's because they're killing

475
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:21,720
themselves.

476
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,470
I guess there must be rockets inside of
these children because I haven't seen

477
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:28,050
any evidence whatsoever.
All the homes of they're blowing up.

478
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:31,100
Where are these rocket command centers?
I just want to see fucking evidence.

479
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:31,950
It's not a cartoon.

480
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,610
Well, Prager's uh, his point
of views, very simplified,

481
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,060
very simplistic and biased.
Obviously, you know, his, the,

482
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:45,230
the whole take like it's very simple.
The Jewish state.

483
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:49,070
It's very simple. It's not very
simple. It's not simple at all, man.

484
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:54,250
And he didn't mention what you mentioned
at all is that these people are kind of

485
00:27:54,321 --> 00:27:59,240
closed in there and there's no
hope for them. This idea that,

486
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,220
you know,
first of all,

487
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,880
the idea that a Jewish state
has always gives a fuck.

488
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:08,060
It's religions retarded. All
right, if you're an old man,

489
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,910
you think religions are good idea,
good on you buddy.

490
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:15,230
Keep that rock that shit until you
fucking body stops working. But for us,

491
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,290
for the young folks that are out here
that had sort of paying attention to the

492
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:23,270
way things have run on this planet
in this idiotic cyclical manner,

493
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:26,150
from the beginning of time,
from the beginning,

494
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:30,110
the first fucking dude wrote shit down
and decided to tell the other guys that

495
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,280
God wrote it or God told him to
write it or what. I mean, that's it.

496
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,780
This idea that it's the religious
state should be allowed to exist.

497
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,310
The idea of a religious state
is ridiculous. It's ridiculous.

498
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:46,010
Whether it's a state of Scientology,

499
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,620
whether it's the moonies have
their own fucking country.

500
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:53,660
Like any country that is based
on religion. It's ridiculous.

501
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,710
It's ridiculous.

502
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,310
And I know we're supposed to have
religious freedom and I agree with that.

503
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,440
I agree that you should fucking,

504
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,840
you should be able to worship
the spaghetti monster.

505
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,550
You should be able to
do whatever you want.

506
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,800
But when you have an entire state that
bling believes it's the chosen people and

507
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:14,801
they're connected to this other state
that they have sort of boxed into this 45

508
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:16,334
mile strip,

509
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,230
I mean objectively stand
outside of the situation.

510
00:29:21,231 --> 00:29:25,080
What are those poor people you're
supposed to do? You know, and look, I'm,

511
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:30,130
I am not discounting this idea that Hamas
is a terrorist organization cause they

512
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:35,630
obviously are, but how, how does a
terrorist organizations start out?

513
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,900
It's like one of the things that happened
during September 11th it drove me

514
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:43,240
fucking bananas when George Bush was like,
they hate us for our freedom, you know?

515
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,343
Okay.

516
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,760
W W w they hate us so much for our
freedom that they're willing to fly planes

517
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:51,200
into buildings.
What did we do right?

518
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,660
What the fuck are we doing
that gets people angry?
Nobody ever thinks about that.

519
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,820
All they ever think about
is the action themselves.

520
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,980
Not like what's causing this action?

521
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,540
What is it that's making people come
from another planet and blow up buildings

522
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:08,530
in New York City? Well, it's not New
York City. It's not those people.

523
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:12,010
It's not the people in those busy
not freedom. It's not freedom.

524
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,120
It has nothing to do with it.

525
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,360
It's this discounting of the chain
of events that cause this cataclysmic

526
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:23,790
disaster. It's discounting
the, the, the pressures, the,

527
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,640
the inequities, the, the, all
the problems, the inequality,

528
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:32,641
tha tha tha tha the despair of being
born into that situation and this is the

529
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:37,540
idea that what the thing that drives me
the most crazy about war is that people

530
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:41,080
will agree that those people are the
enemy. People that they don't even know,

531
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:43,270
right? They're just people. This, this,

532
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:48,190
this concept of tribalism is so
archaic and so fucking stupid that it,

533
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:52,690
it drives me crazy that it still exists.
That in this day and age,

534
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,190
people who have never met,

535
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,790
we'll see someone who's on the
other side of the fence and say,

536
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:02,260
that is my enemy and I have to go
kill them. People who have never met,

537
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,970
they don't know each other at all.

538
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,020
And this idea that these people are
Arab and these people are Jewish,

539
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:09,730
so they could never possibly get a wrong.

540
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,900
It's preposterous saying it exists
all throughout this country.

541
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,140
We w people, I mean, yeah,
there's racism and there's there,

542
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:21,430
there's biases against religions
and religious beliefs for sure.

543
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:22,570
But there's also,

544
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,620
there's always going to be that there's
bias against Republicans hate fucking

545
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:30,640
Democrats. Democrats hate Republicans,
but a lot of people hate libertarians.

546
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:33,280
People love to hate
people for all regardless.

547
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,270
And when the media is amplifying that
hate and telling you more reasons why you

548
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:40,000
should hate the, it's
the same logic. Okay,

549
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:43,270
so Hamas is the democratically
elected leadership of the Gaza Strip.

550
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,700
And the reason is because
of what I said before,

551
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:49,060
is that they're aligning more with this
militant faction because they are trying

552
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:51,700
to resist this occupation
and ongoing seizure. Right.

553
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,880
I disagree with Hamas is
all of what they stand for.

554
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:57,430
But I understand the evolution
of how this happened,

555
00:31:57,431 --> 00:32:00,850
but it's the same logic as saying all
Palestinians deserve to die because they

556
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:03,580
liked it. Hamas. They all
must be terrorist. They
almost believe in that shit.

557
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:08,040
It's the same logic bin Ladin had that
Americans deserve to die because you know

558
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,550
of what we did,
right?

559
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,480
Because we elected these leaders
who you could say are terrorists.

560
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:15,100
I'm just a larger scale.
What makes someone a terrorist?

561
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,240
Killing a million Iraqis with all this
fucking high grade weaponry or blowing

562
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:22,510
yourself up on an airplane. I mean
it's comparable. If you're looking at,

563
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,830
I would say that the a million
daddy Rockies would say
that Bush was a terrorist.

564
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,830
You know, one man's terrorist is
another man's freedom fighter.

565
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,650
Yeah.
It's easy to point.

566
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,070
It's easy to decide that someone's a
terrorist and that will label terrorist is

567
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:39,890
such a right. It's so vague
and it's so easy. Move around.

568
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,020
You know, he could, he could
apply it to either side,

569
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:46,790
but the dehumanization of populations.
My brother Robbie Martin, he's yelled,

570
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,790
he does journalism for media roots.org,

571
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,890
which is my other citizen
journalism website.

572
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:54,430
But we just published this article about
the history of the term human shield

573
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:58,060
and it just, it is really
incredible because you look
back at even World War II,

574
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,430
Japan,
the Vietcong,

575
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:04,720
we all use this terminology and there's
really little evidence to ever back it

576
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:08,230
up. And it always is when
the establishment wants to
paint a population as like

577
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,300
having little value to human life,

578
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,150
even bin Ladin using as
wives as human shields.

579
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:17,110
When we raided the compound that turned
out to be an ally, um, the Taliban,

580
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:21,070
they said that they use people as human
shields shooting from civilian areas.

581
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,860
All of this like never
really has been proven,

582
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,700
but when you repeat it more and more and
more and more, people just say like, oh,

583
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,230
well they're using their
kids as human shields.

584
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,570
What are we supposed to do when we
go in there and bomb them? Like,

585
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:33,070
it's not our fault that
the kids are dying.

586
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,950
Here's isn't even fucking crazier part.
As you remember this,

587
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,040
when we invaded Iraq Bush,
actually,

588
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:42,400
so the CIO has this giant document on
human shields and Saddam is use of human

589
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:46,060
shields. And Bush actually fucking had
the audacity to go out on TV and say,

590
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,570
just to warn you, there's going to be
mass casualties when we invaded Iraq.

591
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:49,991
And he was like,

592
00:33:49,991 --> 00:33:53,770
but it's going to be because he Rockies
are going to be used as human shields.

593
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,520
He was like, the people who die, Saddam,
we'll be using them as human shields.

594
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,600
Like how the fucking insane is that the,

595
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:03,790
you're preemptively justifying slaughter
by blaming the population that you're

596
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:07,070
going to be bombing. I sorry, I
just get really upset. Well, you

597
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:10,730
shouldn't be. You should be, because
these tactics are ridiculous. You know,

598
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,520
and this, these, these tactics,

599
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,470
they're a part of an ancient system,
right?

600
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:20,990
This ancient system of justification
of warfare and this ancient system,

601
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,850
it really,
you know,

602
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,390
for the longest time it was
incredibly difficult to decipher.

603
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,760
Incredibly difficult. I mean,
go back to the Roman days,

604
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:31,340
try to figure out who's right
and who's wrong. Good luck.

605
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,500
What are you going to find
the right animal skin to read?

606
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,880
You know where it has the fucking
truth written down on it? No, you,

607
00:34:36,881 --> 00:34:41,450
you couldn't possibly be there when the
events transpired that caused the war

608
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:45,020
itself. You couldn't possibly
be in the tent where the, the,

609
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,190
the war chiefs decided to fucking,
you know me.

610
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,840
This is the attack we're going to do and
this is the reason why we're going to

611
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:51,601
do it. No, you,

612
00:34:51,601 --> 00:34:56,060
you just were a part of the army or you
are part of the civilian population that

613
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:59,060
had to endure whatever was going on.
You felt powerless.

614
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:03,800
You felt you had no information other
than what was being spread through the

615
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,120
state and you were fucked.

616
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,890
But now we live in this different time
and in this different time you can watch

617
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:14,570
a Dennis Prager video and go Dennis
Prager as a Douche bag. You can debate it.

618
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:15,080
You can,

619
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,550
you can look at the actual facts of the
situation and people can be informed in

620
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,820
a way that's really never
been available before. The,

621
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:26,320
the Vietnam war protests
were largely based on the,

622
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,850
there were largely based on
educational institutions.

623
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:32,900
It was largely largely based
out of universities where
these liberal professors

624
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:36,230
were trying to explain to people what
the reality of the situation was.

625
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,410
And then parents are like, these fucking
liberals are teaching my kids bullshit.

626
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:43,770
And then you had Kent state
where the fucking the military,

627
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:48,000
the national guard came in
and shot student protestors
and scare the fuck out of

628
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:48,720
everybody.

629
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,590
I mean there was so much chaos going
on to try to suppress the spread of

630
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:55,860
information.
Just tried to suppress dissent.

631
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,660
But today the wells broken.
I mean it's just,

632
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:02,700
there's no suppressing it any more.

633
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,710
And we have these organizations that are
scrambling to try to make sense of it

634
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:13,350
all that trying to
justify their actions in,

635
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:17,940
in light of this overwhelming amount of
information that didn't exist before.

636
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:21,140
Exactly. Social media, the wouldn't
during operation cast lead,

637
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:26,000
which was I think I want to say 2009 but
that was the last really brutal siege

638
00:36:26,001 --> 00:36:29,810
on Gaza and we didn't have
social media like we did. I'm in,

639
00:36:29,811 --> 00:36:31,700
they didn't have it back
then like we do now.

640
00:36:31,701 --> 00:36:33,770
So I think they're able to control
the narrative a little bit more.

641
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:36,290
But now it's like the fucking
floodgates are opened. Dude.

642
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,790
You can't deny seeing children's brains
being blown out. I mean it's just,

643
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,600
there's so much death and destruction
on social media that you're just seeing

644
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:46,220
the truth right in your fucking face.

645
00:36:46,221 --> 00:36:50,960
It doesn't matter how many
cartoon infographics you
make up on the IDF sided and

646
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,710
going back to propaganda,
I mean Israel is just working 24,

647
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:56,720
seven to try to spin this thing.
Um,

648
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:01,520
not only as our media an abysmal failure
and relaying what is actually happening,

649
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,400
but they actually have,
um, you know, first of all,

650
00:37:04,401 --> 00:37:08,930
there's the birthright trip where actually
I think like 2000 soldiers right now

651
00:37:08,931 --> 00:37:10,220
and the idea for American,

652
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,280
because they go on these birthright
trips and then they're told at the end of

653
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:13,701
the trip,
like,

654
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:18,230
come fight for us like you need this is
like everyone wants to kill us still.

655
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:22,490
You know, Jews need protection and come
join the IDF. And it's just bizarre.

656
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:25,250
I can't imagine another army,
well actually I can,

657
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:27,950
and they were called terrorists when
people wanted to join like the Iraqi

658
00:37:27,951 --> 00:37:30,980
resistance and the Syrian resistance,
we call them terrorists.

659
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:34,550
But if you're an American, you go fucking
join the IDF, which is a colonial army.

660
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:39,410
Somehow you're a fucking hero.
The propaganda machines working 24 seven,

661
00:37:39,411 --> 00:37:40,400
they offer grants,

662
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:44,540
scholarships for people who can do the
most pro Zionist editing on Wikipedia and

663
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:50,030
edit the most Facebook posts and post
the most pro tweets, pro Israel treats.

664
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,360
They offer free hotter balloon
rides around Israel. Tel Aviv.

665
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:57,620
If you post the most pro Israeli
shit on like Facebook and Twitter.

666
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,450
Dude, it's pretty sweet though. Hot Air
balloon who we didn't want to do that.

667
00:38:02,451 --> 00:38:05,570
Right. I'm thinking about it and
I mean I doubt Hamas is offering,

668
00:38:05,571 --> 00:38:07,900
like I've dropped him off with
the capability to offer that to,

669
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,160
to the all the fucking
human shields in Gaza,

670
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:11,980
but I don't even have pasta or chocolate.
Yeah,

671
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,580
they're going to have hot air balloons.

672
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,330
They can't even make terrorist
paper airplanes point to paper. Uh,

673
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:23,330
but it just shows you how much is going
into the spin machine on one side.

674
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:27,740
And I was invited on CNN last night
and I was like shocked. I was like,

675
00:38:27,741 --> 00:38:31,040
holy fuck, they're gonna let me go
on CNN and drop this truth on there.

676
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,850
And then they cancelled. I think
they got some pressure, um,

677
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,160
because it was too good to be, yeah. Oh,

678
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,390
good googly Mowgli. Of course they
did. Yeah. Someone was probably like,

679
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:45,550
no, no, no, no, no. Watch her videos,

680
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,570
bitch crazy.
Got a nose ring.

681
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:54,300
Yeah. Um, it's, this is a strange
time when it comes to this,

682
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:55,440
uh,
these,

683
00:38:55,441 --> 00:39:00,150
these sort of events because they don't
play out the way the military leaders

684
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:04,470
sort of expect them to play out in the
media anymore because the media that's

685
00:39:04,471 --> 00:39:08,550
online is as big,
if not bigger in total.

686
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:13,110
Then the mainstream in quotes media,
there's no mainstream media anymore.

687
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:17,760
There's CNN, there's Fox, there's
these traditional media outlets,

688
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:19,950
which is the way to describe them.
Traditional media.

689
00:39:19,951 --> 00:39:23,880
It's almost like they're their legacy.
It's like legacy media.

690
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,920
But then there's online media,

691
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,840
which if you totaled up the amount
of blogs, the amount of videos,

692
00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:35,841
the amount of online websites that have
streaming video and podcasts and the

693
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:42,030
different forms of media that
exists that cover these same issues.

694
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,430
It's overwhelmingly bigger.

695
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,880
Overwhelmingly like the numbers are
much larger for the cumulative total of

696
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:52,870
websites that cover these stories.
It's,

697
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:57,480
it's much more people are downloading
like clicking on those links,

698
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:59,670
reading those stories,
watching those videos.

699
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,730
Then you're getting
ever on a CNN broadcast.

700
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,430
So that's why I didn't even care when
they canceled it. I was like, fuck it,

701
00:40:05,431 --> 00:40:09,210
I'm going on Joe Rogan's show tomorrow.
And that has a million times more.

702
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:11,910
Just like people who I would even
want to be reaching out to you.

703
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:14,490
Like what do I want to reach out to
like old ladies in their home watching

704
00:40:14,491 --> 00:40:18,100
fucking Fox or do I want to reach
out to people who actually, you know,

705
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,360
have that are on the ball or like invested
in the culture and what the fuck's

706
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:24,840
happening in this country. And that's
your audience. And it's just really cool.

707
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:27,540
I mean being at your show last
night and seeing and seeing,

708
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:32,010
just like how many people give a shit
and are paying attention to you and the

709
00:40:32,011 --> 00:40:35,730
podcast and fuck CNN it,
we're driving them into a relevancy man.

710
00:40:35,731 --> 00:40:40,680
I mean your show and all the social media
stuff, these people, it's dinosaurs.

711
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:45,710
There's not dying. The silent movies,
what it is, the format is archaic,

712
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,300
you know, we'll be right back. You know,

713
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:51,920
and like these fucking things drive me
crazy when they have a legitimate issue

714
00:40:51,921 --> 00:40:54,170
to debate and they have four squares.

715
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:57,740
Like it's the fucking Hollywood squares
and rip is up in the corner and he's

716
00:40:57,741 --> 00:41:01,610
like this. That's correct. Right.
Chase is nuts. And then you know,

717
00:41:01,611 --> 00:41:03,980
you have all these other people and
they're yelling over each other and like

718
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:07,220
we'll be right back. Thank you for,
yeah, we have to cut to Justin Bieber.

719
00:41:07,221 --> 00:41:08,054
He just got it

720
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,040
court and that's what they actually did.
They like cut from a congress.

721
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:13,710
I mean I think CNN or
something was cutting and he
was talking to a congressman

722
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:17,340
about the NSA and then they're like,
hold on, breaking news, Justin Bieber.

723
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:21,480
Just like pled something.
I was like, what? Yeah. Um,

724
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,700
yeah,
I mean if I could just say one thing,

725
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:26,550
so people don't call me a
Nazi and shit is that I,

726
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,000
I love all people.
I think all human beings,

727
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:35,001
I just want to see humanity have equality
and I just think that the Palestinians

728
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,840
are being royally fucked over and I'm
just totally disgusted with the way that

729
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:41,840
it's being portrayed and that they're
being vilified and demonized with zero

730
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:44,360
context and zero historical
context of how this happened.

731
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,440
And that's why I'm just like trying
to just say as much as I can,

732
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,990
even though I'm very
biased and openly biased.

733
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:55,760
I'm an advocacy journalist and I just
think that it needs to be done because I

734
00:41:55,761 --> 00:42:00,560
see just a giant void in the main stream
and I just got to fucking do it. I mean,

735
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:03,290
I interviewed some woman in
Gaza who she was just like,

736
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,020
I could be called the human shield
because I'm refusing to leave my house.

737
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:08,770
And she's like, and the truth is
there's nowhere for us to go. Yeah,

738
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:10,180
we can't leave.
Right.

739
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:13,860
45 miles and that many people
stuffed in together. It's the,

740
00:42:13,861 --> 00:42:17,040
the options are incredibly limited.
And if you really want to do,

741
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,490
if anybody in that area
really wants to have peace,

742
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,070
this idea that you contain these people,
it was almost like insuring, yeah,

743
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,080
you're ensuring that you're going
to have some sort of conflict,

744
00:42:28,081 --> 00:42:31,380
constant conflict. I don't know
what to do though, but I mean,

745
00:42:31,381 --> 00:42:33,000
what are you gonna do?
You're gonna let those people,

746
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,440
if you let those people out of Gaza,
okay. Like say if the, the, the, the,

747
00:42:37,441 --> 00:42:40,830
the Jews and the Palestinians come to
an agreement and then they open the

748
00:42:40,831 --> 00:42:45,180
borders and then the Palestinians come
over to Israel and they seek revenge for

749
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:48,630
their family members that have died.
And then it all starts all over again.

750
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,050
I mean,

751
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:53,640
once thousands of people have been killed
and it sends in their eyes murdered,

752
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,680
you know, you can say military
action. It's call, you know,

753
00:42:56,681 --> 00:43:01,110
use whatever noises with your face to
describe a missile hitting a fucking baby.

754
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,900
But it is what it is.
And if that's my baby,

755
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:07,650
I'm strapping some c four to my chest
and I'm going to find out who did it and

756
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:08,970
I'm going to take out the whole group.

757
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,980
I mean that's probably
what they're thinking.

758
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,690
And there's going to be
a lot of those people.

759
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:14,850
There's a lot of those people
that are filled with despair.

760
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,610
And what other options? I
don't know. I don't know.

761
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:18,371
Good point.

762
00:43:18,371 --> 00:43:22,120
And I think that's the reason why
these 120 people are still languishing,

763
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:24,160
innocent and getting though,
because at this point they're like,

764
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:25,810
what the fuck are we going
to do release these people?

765
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,700
We just tortured them for 12 years.

766
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:31,420
Well, we tortured some folks. We tortured
to boat. Did you see that fucking thing?

767
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,320
Oh my God. Folks, if you haven't
seen it folks, ladies and gentlemen,

768
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:40,560
there is a recent thing where
Barack Obama is talking.

769
00:43:41,221 --> 00:43:41,370
Okay

770
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:46,370
bout people being tortured
and he uses the term.

771
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,390
Well, we tortured some folks
after the September 11 attacks.

772
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,360
Tortured some folks. No, you
can't say that. You can say,

773
00:43:55,361 --> 00:43:58,690
we met some folks, you
know, ah, we went to,

774
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,580
we went to Atlanta. We met
some Nice folks. You don't
say we tortured some folks.

775
00:44:03,581 --> 00:44:08,581
Like what kind of fucking weird euphemism
speak is that we tortured some folks.

776
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,960
So that's become a Hashtag on Twitter now.

777
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,860
A Hashtag we tortured some
folks Hashtag drone king. Yeah,

778
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,410
that is what's going on that
I'm not kidding. That is uh,

779
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:21,190
that's trending Hashtag we tortured
some folks. I'm not kidding.

780
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,530
And that's exactly, yeah,
that's exactly what,

781
00:44:23,531 --> 00:44:27,330
what's happening with the
drone wars that look, these,

782
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,750
these fucking Taliban militants just took
over this airport and Karachi killed a

783
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,340
shitload people.
And why?

784
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,600
Because they said that a drone fucking
killed one of their leaders in fucking

785
00:44:36,601 --> 00:44:40,530
the rural area of Pakistan because
Obama launched a drone attack.

786
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:41,221
Killed this guy.

787
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:45,540
It's like this is going
to be going on forever.

788
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,020
When you kill people with drones,
when you fucking in prison,

789
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:51,060
people a in a little area.
I mean,

790
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:54,500
it just going to be a cycle of
violence and revenge and a hate. Um,

791
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:57,360
and that's why I just completely
disagree with, with, you know,

792
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:01,300
of course the drone war. I disagree with
all that Shit, man. Oh, bonds are there.

793
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:06,090
It's a spooky idea that you're nowhere
near there and you have a remote control

794
00:45:06,091 --> 00:45:10,020
and you press a button and missiles
that are called a hell fire.

795
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:15,021
Missiles come flying out of the sky and
slamming a targets often the wrong ones.

796
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,560
And if you look at the amount of people
that are innocent that had been killed

797
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:23,070
by drones versus the amount of actual
terrorists that have been killed by drunk,

798
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,710
what a fucking mess that up.

799
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,740
And they also just call a militants.

800
00:45:27,741 --> 00:45:31,070
Anyone who's just aged like
literally military age.

801
00:45:31,071 --> 00:45:35,090
So it could be 15 to fucking a
hundred if you're a military age male,

802
00:45:35,091 --> 00:45:38,380
you're considered a militant.
So who are, I mean, yeah,

803
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:42,170
I don't know who's even like, I'm sure the
majority of them are civilians. If you,

804
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:44,420
if you have enough dirt on
someone where you actually,

805
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,410
they're worthy of being executed,
put them on fucking trial. I'm sorry.

806
00:45:48,411 --> 00:45:50,690
But I believe in the
rule of law and justice.

807
00:45:50,691 --> 00:45:54,620
I don't believe in just assassinating
motherfuckers across the globe with zero

808
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:57,020
accountability,
zero context of who these people are.

809
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:01,160
And we know that they've executed
fucking like that. 16 year old boy,

810
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:05,870
the son of Anwar, all all Locky. Yeah.
16 year old kid blew him up in a drone.

811
00:46:05,871 --> 00:46:08,660
Him and his whole family just dead.
No accountability,

812
00:46:08,661 --> 00:46:11,270
no rationale and you know
there are just all terrorists.

813
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:13,700
I guess that's just makes us feel better.

814
00:46:13,701 --> 00:46:16,310
I guess to think that in Pakistan alone

815
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:21,350
between 416 and 951 civilians including
hundred and 68 to 200 children have been

816
00:46:25,351 --> 00:46:29,730
killed depending upon reports and
you know, who knows what the numbers,

817
00:46:29,731 --> 00:46:30,810
the correct numbers are.

818
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,980
I mean first of all you got a real problem
with incredibly poor people where you

819
00:46:34,981 --> 00:46:38,730
hit a fucking house where they live in
and there's no paperwork and there are

820
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:41,430
blown to smithereens.
Like how many people were there.

821
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,790
You were going to have to find the family
members are going to report and tell

822
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:48,630
you how many, and it's, you know, that's
why you're getting these weird numbers,

823
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:52,680
but the bottom line is hundreds of
people have been murdered that did.

824
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,090
And also more disturbing linked
to disturbing things. One of them,

825
00:46:56,091 --> 00:46:57,080
the intercept release,

826
00:46:57,081 --> 00:47:00,380
which is Glenn Greenwald's publication
with the NSA leaks that they actually are

827
00:47:00,381 --> 00:47:02,210
killing people based on metadata.

828
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:06,620
So they track someone's metadata through
their cell phone and then they track

829
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:09,830
all these patterns. So it's not even
like real human beings with an, you know,

830
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,870
conducting intelligence on the ground,

831
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,640
figuring out what people
deserve to die or not.

832
00:47:13,641 --> 00:47:18,470
It's actually fucking tracking metadata
on a fucking like computer screen.

833
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,590
That is insane to me because what if you
give your cell phone or your grandma,

834
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:24,230
right, the cell phones in your
grandma's house or a church,

835
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,840
they're going to fucking blow the
shit out of that church. Exactly.

836
00:47:26,841 --> 00:47:29,880
Blow your grandma targeting
wherever that phone, you know,

837
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,780
if you really hated somebody, you just
leave your phone over their house. Hell,

838
00:47:33,781 --> 00:47:35,750
fire is a comment.
Yeah,

839
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,210
that's specific.
And so the idea of the,

840
00:47:38,211 --> 00:47:41,780
this is the word that gets thrown
around a lot, surgical strikes.

841
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,380
I mean you want to talk
about surgical precision.

842
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:49,280
You don't usually talk about
missiles that hit metadata

843
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,180
that where a phone is and it's a
hit in a fucking apartment building.

844
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:57,680
You're just going to blow
up. Whoever happens to random
Billy be near this phone,

845
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:02,660
collateral damage man. And
going back to what do we do?
I mean, I think that we, um,

846
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,630
we end the apartheid state.
We start giving Arabs equal rights,

847
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,240
but I think that the u s
cutting off funding militarily,

848
00:48:08,241 --> 00:48:10,430
I think is the number one
thing. I mean, for God's sake,

849
00:48:10,431 --> 00:48:14,120
there's been blatant war crimes that have
happened hitting the UN refugee school,

850
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:18,320
killing 17 human beings that we're trying
to get refuge during a humanitarian

851
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:20,840
sees far, they bombed a crowded
market, killing another 17.

852
00:48:20,841 --> 00:48:24,610
They've killed like six journalists,
target all these media centers at,

853
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,100
and then there was a UN Security Council
where every single country either

854
00:48:28,101 --> 00:48:33,101
abstained or voted to investigate war
crimes in Gaza except the u s except the u

855
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:36,800
s that's how blind,
that's how blind this allegiances.

856
00:48:36,801 --> 00:48:38,630
And if we could just end
this military funding,

857
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:43,100
I think then Israel would be forced
to kind of analyze their, their role.

858
00:48:43,101 --> 00:48:46,370
And we can really talk seriously about
solutions here because it's not going to

859
00:48:46,371 --> 00:48:47,204
work.

860
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,560
Yeah. You're not anti Israel,
you're anti war right. You know,

861
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,470
and I have a lot of friends
that are Jewish and you know,

862
00:48:54,471 --> 00:48:58,580
on a lot of them have very strong opinions
about this whole thing. And you know,

863
00:48:58,581 --> 00:49:00,230
I see it from their point of view.

864
00:49:00,231 --> 00:49:03,880
They grew up with this idea that the
Palestinians are terrorists or the

865
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,570
Palestinians kidnap,
choose.

866
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:09,410
And you remember the Olympic Games
and all this craziness. And you know,

867
00:49:09,411 --> 00:49:14,000
I see their point of view.
But as an objective human observer,

868
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:17,750
when you watch us, you go, there has
gotta be a way to break this cycle.

869
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,530
And the way is not missiles and
it's not blowing up tunnels.

870
00:49:21,531 --> 00:49:24,260
And it's not keeping these
people on a strip of land.

871
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,260
I don't know what the way is.
You know, that's the problem.

872
00:49:27,261 --> 00:49:31,520
I'm talking a lot of shit here. I don't
have any solutions, but uh, it's scary.

873
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:32,510
It's scary as fuck.

874
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:37,280
And then you've got Russia that
may be invading Ukraine right now.

875
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:40,550
I mean, as we speak this weekend,
that might be going down. You know,

876
00:49:40,551 --> 00:49:44,330
there's a bunch of points all over the
earth where there's some scary shit

877
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:47,150
that's happening. You know,
it's, this is scary time.

878
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:52,390
It's a very scary time because human
beings have so much more capacity for

879
00:49:55,101 --> 00:49:59,120
violence. We, we the, our ability,
when you have things like drones,

880
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:03,500
when you have things like long range
missiles and nuclear weapons and all these

881
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,960
different things that just
didn't exist a hundred years ago,

882
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,200
but you still have the same mentality
that existed a hundred years ago.

883
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:13,760
That's the real issue, right? I
mean, a hundred years ago, you know,

884
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:17,210
you had a fucking get in a boat and you
had to get over there in a plane with a

885
00:50:17,211 --> 00:50:21,620
propeller and it was, it was hard to
fuck shit up. Now you can be in Nevada,

886
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:26,270
you know, with a fucking x box controller
and you're launching missiles, you know,

887
00:50:26,271 --> 00:50:28,160
from the other side of the world

888
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:32,180
is it gets real weird when
it becomes easy to kill.

889
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:35,780
And when you're so delusional that you
think that you are literally chosen by

890
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:38,120
God to live more than another human being,

891
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:41,270
and then you have these weapons in your
arsenal. That's what's scary to me.

892
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,350
That's goofy as fuck. That is unbelievably
goofy. And that's the thing that,

893
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,990
you know, when you, when you talk
to Jewish people, that's, you know,

894
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,650
that's my faith and my undeniable
right to have this faith.

895
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:55,460
And that's why Dennis Prager, boy,
my face, like undeniable, right?

896
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,310
For a Jewish state, look, undeniably,

897
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,360
there's so much fucking antisemitism
online. It's disgusting. It's vile.

898
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:06,770
And there's obviously Jews had been
persecuted horribly in the past and um,

899
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:08,930
you know,
it's awful,

900
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:13,480
but it's not a reason or justification
to do this to another population. No,

901
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:17,030
no, it's not. And it's only
gonna make more antisemitism.

902
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:22,420
So unfortunate attacking Palestinians and
seen and having the outside world look

903
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:27,950
at this happen and you know, and also
look, when Palestinians attack Israelis,

904
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,270
that shit ain't helping
either, man. Right? But it's,

905
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:37,280
it's a terribly imbalanced situation, a
terribly, terribly imbalanced situation.

906
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:41,660
It's imbalanced that Israel feels like
it's completely surrounded by these Arab

907
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:44,300
states, these Muslim states
that hate it and want it gone.

908
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:48,980
That's incredibly imbalanced as well.
And that's also a religious issue.

909
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,840
It's like that they're just as goofy,
the whole, I mean, it's all goofy.

910
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:56,420
This idea that your ideology,

911
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:01,570
your religious ideology based on some
ancient shit that nobody knows the real

912
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:06,140
source of is more important or
more valid than someone else's.

913
00:52:06,141 --> 00:52:10,280
It's all fucking madness. And look
at us, look at the Christian College.

914
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,030
Here are the evangelicals did,
I just saw,

915
00:52:13,031 --> 00:52:15,390
I don't know if you've been watching
John Oliver, I really liked his show,

916
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:18,810
but he had on this stuff about the
Uganda gay La and you're like, oh wow,

917
00:52:18,811 --> 00:52:21,000
that's so fucked up.
Uganda has such horrible galas.

918
00:52:21,001 --> 00:52:24,360
And then you realize that it's because
of the evangelicals here in this country

919
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:28,100
that they basically been in bolden because
the political establishment for some

920
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:32,340
reason it takes them seriously enough
to like let them and have such a say and

921
00:52:32,341 --> 00:52:35,250
it's driven all of our politics
of the fucking right so much.

922
00:52:35,251 --> 00:52:39,330
And so then these evangelicals have
so much money and backing that they go

923
00:52:39,331 --> 00:52:43,860
across the world and start like making
these laws get pushed through to fucking

924
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:46,740
kill gay people. And you're like,
what in the hell is going on?

925
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,850
It's this crazy shit. Like
sure. Uganda's uh, you know,

926
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:51,870
might be backwards in a lot of ways,

927
00:52:51,871 --> 00:52:56,190
but without these American Christian
evangelicals going over there and actually

928
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,980
helping get this done,
it wouldn't have happened.

929
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,550
And that's really scary because for
some reason they're relevant here.

930
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:05,190
And I'm not saying of course, if you're
Christian, I'm not talking about that.

931
00:53:05,191 --> 00:53:10,010
I'm talking about the very, very,
very right wing, very like money,

932
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,790
like very small minority that have
extremely powerful political voice because

933
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:18,250
they have so much money and
it gets people like, you know,

934
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:22,180
Mitt Romney and fucking
Rick Santorum. Yeah, I mean,

935
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,570
I mean the fact that those
people are even relevant.

936
00:53:24,571 --> 00:53:27,270
The fact that we had that as
our president, like, look,

937
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:30,570
I think Obama is a war criminal,
but Mitt Romney's, I mean, damn,

938
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:34,710
I mean these people are just nuts.
Sarah Pailin, these people should not

939
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:39,250
anywhere near politics when fucking crazy.
Mitt Romney,

940
00:53:39,251 --> 00:53:42,910
for folks who don't know is a part of one
of the most extreme Mormon sex effort.

941
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:46,210
They left the country to go to Mexico
because he couldn't have a hundred wives

942
00:53:46,211 --> 00:53:47,044
here in America.

943
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,250
That's mean this literally why Mitt
Romney's family couldn't know his dad

944
00:53:51,251 --> 00:53:54,070
couldn't be president because his
dad was born in fucking Mexico.

945
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:56,320
His family is from Mexico.

946
00:53:56,321 --> 00:54:01,321
They have a giant compound in Mexico
where they are engaged in like these wars

947
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:04,060
with the drug cartels.
They get kidnapped and Shit.

948
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,040
Vice did this whole piece on it. It's
incredibly fucked up and Mitt Romney's is.

949
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:12,760
They just did. No one talked about
it. My Mormonism is off the table.

950
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:17,260
You're like, actually that's
pretty fucking important. No it's,

951
00:54:17,261 --> 00:54:18,790
it's on the table as fuck dude.

952
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,890
You know you might keep it off
the table and you're goofy.

953
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:25,240
Legacy television shows and all these
ridiculous things that you, you,

954
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,390
you do these ridiculous debates
where everything's controlled.

955
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,260
If I was ever in a debate with that guide,

956
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:33,550
the first thing I would say is
you really believe Joseph Smith,

957
00:54:33,551 --> 00:54:37,900
a 14 year old boy found golden tablets
that contain the loss work of Jesus,

958
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:42,040
but only he could read them cause he had
a magic barium and then no one else can

959
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:44,560
see the fuck outta here.
Dude. I would literally say,

960
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:47,690
get the fuck out of here on TV.
You're in a cult, right? Yeah.

961
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:52,120
You called Sir big sometimes,
sometimes culturally of 30 people.

962
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:56,320
And you live in the fucking San Fernando
Valley in a weird shelter and sometimes

963
00:54:56,321 --> 00:54:59,290
called have a billion people.
And you know,

964
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:02,380
you've got a guy called the pope and
he sits on a fucking golden throne.

965
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:05,590
Guess what? That guy's a
fucking cult leader. Right?
You know, maybe the new ones,

966
00:55:05,591 --> 00:55:07,480
the best one ever because
he's, you know, he's,

967
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:11,020
he's sweet and he's a man of the people
and he's so proletariat. Look at him.

968
00:55:11,021 --> 00:55:14,320
He's an awesome pope. He's
a regular guy. No he's not.

969
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:20,110
He's just a better cult leader then that
creepy fuck that came before him that

970
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:22,900
sat on a golden throne,
you know,

971
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:26,920
and had a gay bath house in
the same property as exactly.

972
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:30,310
Thank you for bringing that up. Well, I'd,
I know l Ron Hubbard, his great grandson,

973
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,090
he lives in Oakland and he
was telling me that his,

974
00:55:32,091 --> 00:55:36,410
it's very openly admitted and his great
grandfather wrote it in fucking books

975
00:55:36,411 --> 00:55:38,210
and shit,
that he was in tax trouble.

976
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:40,990
And he needed to start a religion to
like get out of this fucking tax trouble.

977
00:55:40,991 --> 00:55:43,940
He was gonna go to jail, he owed
tons of money, the government.

978
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:44,900
And he even said like,

979
00:55:44,901 --> 00:55:48,590
I'm going to start a fucking religion
and get myself out of these like tax

980
00:55:48,591 --> 00:55:50,180
problems and wow,
here you go.

981
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,380
Yeah,
he did it.

982
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:56,410
And to take that Scientology is
any less valid than Mormonism,

983
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:56,960
right?

984
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,850
Or that Mormonism is any less valid than
a religion that is based on a Jewish

985
00:56:01,851 --> 00:56:05,240
Zombie thought. All of it's silly, man.

986
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,640
And it's not saying that there's no god,

987
00:56:07,641 --> 00:56:12,470
it's not saying that spirituality doesn't
have some sort of a benefit to our

988
00:56:12,471 --> 00:56:16,310
society and our culture and this idea
of a greater thing other than people.

989
00:56:16,311 --> 00:56:17,680
This greater power,

990
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:21,620
whatever it may be that created the
universe because there is something that

991
00:56:21,621 --> 00:56:24,100
runs this world,
something that runs

992
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,190
this universe.
You want to give it scientific terms,

993
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:29,920
you want to give it philosophical term,
whatever it is.

994
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:34,630
There's obviously a giant energy that is
created this massive fucking universe,

995
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,500
whether it has a consciousness or not
is d you could debate it all day long,

996
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:43,600
but I'm guessing that a dude didn't die
and then three days later come out and

997
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:46,630
push a rock aside and you know,
come on.

998
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,440
It's the myths that
holds society together.

999
00:56:49,441 --> 00:56:53,670
It's all these fables and myths that are
the glue and you're talking about how

1000
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:55,830
we haven't really changed.
We fucking haven't dude.

1001
00:56:56,070 --> 00:57:00,540
I just saw a poll that basically if a
president was atheist that would be like

1002
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:04,530
the least favorable factor of like any
candidate running for president is if

1003
00:57:04,531 --> 00:57:08,370
they didn't believe in God. That's how
important religion still is to society.

1004
00:57:08,371 --> 00:57:11,510
And I think that even it's like we were
saying last night at the comedy show

1005
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:15,570
that you can show someone proof that
big foot that this video is fucking fake

1006
00:57:15,571 --> 00:57:17,220
and if,
and they still want to believe it,

1007
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:19,830
they believe it doesn't matter
if you just say like, look,

1008
00:57:19,831 --> 00:57:21,940
Jonah couldn't have survived
inside of a whale for three days.

1009
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:23,460
It's just not scientifically possible

1010
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:27,960
like
condos in the whales.

1011
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,313
Yeah.
People are,

1012
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,800
people are weird man there where would
their beliefs and what's weird is as long

1013
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:34,540
as something's old will accept it.

1014
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:38,410
But if you tried to come out today with
some Jewish Zombie story and people will

1015
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:41,560
be like, what is this asshole
doing it? They put you on pills.

1016
00:57:41,561 --> 00:57:44,350
They'd be like good on psychoactive
medicine. You were sucking. Yeah.

1017
00:57:44,351 --> 00:57:48,490
If you were standing like in the middle
of all the people in Occupy Wall Street

1018
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:52,810
and you, you had a a chart and you
were holding up this, this chart,

1019
00:57:52,811 --> 00:57:57,430
this is how the earth was
formed 6,000 years ago.

1020
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:03,400
In six days He created this. He'd be like,
bitch, are you out of your fucking mind?

1021
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,920
If everybody just believe
wholeheartedly in science,

1022
00:58:05,921 --> 00:58:09,430
if we had completely abandoned all
religion and then you came along with

1023
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,580
aversion and nobody would take it.
It has to be old to be old,

1024
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:17,550
but when it's old we'll accept goofy shit.
Ooh.

1025
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:21,070
Though it's so much fucking
shit has come out since then.

1026
00:58:21,071 --> 00:58:23,650
Even though were the internet, we have
the world's knowledge at our fingertips.

1027
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:28,510
We still believe in these
archaic philosophies that
do not apply anymore. Dude,

1028
00:58:28,511 --> 00:58:31,780
did you hear about the Blackwater
Shit that came out? How you know,

1029
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:34,900
you know blackwater and the like the
most criminal mafia organization and

1030
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:39,850
somehow the mercenaries. Yeah, they're
fucking mercenaries. Really. Holy Shit.

1031
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:43,290
And did a couple tours. Yeah,
he was a marine sniper and then

1032
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:46,240
want to make some more money after the
war. We want to make a lot of money.

1033
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,930
I made a lot more money than he did
for the army. They did a couple tours,

1034
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:52,440
opened up an MMA gym with it.
That's cool.

1035
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,960
Kill some people.

1036
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:59,510
Okay. No, that's good. I mean, I'm
just trying to be nice. I think,

1037
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,690
I think anyone can go backwaters
a criminal but, but Erik Prince,

1038
00:59:02,691 --> 00:59:06,470
the guy who founded it actually did
think that he was ordained by God to like

1039
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:10,490
fucking like kill Muslims. Like he thought
that he was carrying out a holy war.

1040
00:59:10,491 --> 00:59:14,150
So what did we do? We hired this
company, sent him over to fucking Iraq.

1041
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:19,190
They massacre, God knows how many
people, but that's not the crazy part.

1042
00:59:19,191 --> 00:59:22,010
The crazy part that just came
out. Abby, the crazy word that

1043
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:27,010
just came out is that basically we
went over to investigate them and um,

1044
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:31,130
the State Department official went over
to Iraq right before the Nusser square

1045
00:59:31,131 --> 00:59:31,551
massacre,

1046
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:34,070
which is when they just went out with
fucking machine guns and just like

1047
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,920
slaughtered to 17, like fucking
women and children on the street.

1048
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:38,450
Before that even happened,

1049
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:41,030
the state of artificial went over to
Iraq and they're like, Yo, Yo, Yo,

1050
00:59:41,031 --> 00:59:43,910
this companies like out of fucking
control. You guys are just like,

1051
00:59:43,911 --> 00:59:45,620
sh like crashing into cars,

1052
00:59:45,621 --> 00:59:49,010
like running over people shooting
fucking birds in the sky and shit.

1053
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:53,630
So they meet with the embassy
and they were like, what?
Like we need to, you know,

1054
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,870
this contractor that we hired is
basically running our operation.

1055
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,750
What did they do? The blackwater
guide. They're just said, we're,

1056
00:59:59,751 --> 01:00:03,020
I'm gonna fucking kill you. We're
going to kill you if you do anything.

1057
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:06,860
And He fucking left terrified.
He told the embassy, he was like,

1058
01:00:06,861 --> 01:00:08,870
they're threatening to kill me.
And they're like, get out there.

1059
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:11,270
Like you're threatening our
relationship now with blackwater.

1060
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,530
Yeah.
And you fucking came back

1061
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:18,810
beyond the law.
That's what's really crazy.

1062
01:00:18,811 --> 01:00:22,880
A lot of the things that were done
by blackwater, these war crimes,

1063
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:26,460
they changed their name a couple of times
since then and now I believe they're

1064
01:00:26,461 --> 01:00:28,320
owned by the United Arab Emirates.

1065
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:32,250
I think they hired prints to start
another organization because they were

1066
01:00:32,251 --> 01:00:35,010
worried about an Arab spring
event happening over there.

1067
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:35,730
He's hot,

1068
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:40,730
he's provided safe harbor and Abu Dhabi
and they something like Abu Dhabi in Abu

1069
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,670
Dhabi and he did start, he did triple
canopy. That's what they just merged with.

1070
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:47,970
So before it was blackwater,
then academy and then Z,

1071
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:50,520
and then after the story came out,

1072
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:54,210
all these other people
came out anonymously inside
blackwater x officials and

1073
01:00:54,211 --> 01:00:57,330
they're like, no, we like Erik.
Prince is like killing people.

1074
01:00:57,331 --> 01:01:00,030
Like Erik Prince has put out
hits on motherfuckers like,

1075
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:03,540
we know this for sure and we're fucking
terrified to come out and actually put

1076
01:01:03,541 --> 01:01:06,810
our identities because we might die to
like that's how insane this student.

1077
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:07,950
And he's just living

1078
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:09,860
still making contracts
with the government.

1079
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:12,350
The CIA just gave Blackwater
whatever the fuck they're called Dao.

1080
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:16,910
Another contract earlier this year. Very
effective. Really good at their job.

1081
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,780
I mean this day, people to shut
the fuck up about things. But boy,

1082
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:22,700
those guys know how to shut people up.

1083
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:28,250
Especially when you can do things
that are completely outside of the

1084
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:33,020
jurisdiction. Right. Any laws?
Ours. Theirs, I mean that
word contractor. So cute.

1085
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:36,830
Cause I was thinking of a polymer or a
guy was going to fucking get your roof.

1086
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:40,130
That's a contractor. Like wait, will the,

1087
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:44,240
those are contractors also have a
fucking sniper rifles. And like what?

1088
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:47,210
That's a contractor. Oh,
okay. Like the, you know,

1089
01:01:47,211 --> 01:01:49,990
like when you heard that was one
of the things that kept like, um,

1090
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:53,720
when that Fallujah thing happened
and they hung those contractors,

1091
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,510
the United States contractors,
like I was like,

1092
01:01:56,511 --> 01:01:57,960
why are they killing construction worker?

1093
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:03,740
They're killing contractors.
And then you realize, oh no, no,

1094
01:02:03,741 --> 01:02:08,741
they're killing Merce and Mary
were killing hired assassins.

1095
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:11,470
Oh that's great.
That's,

1096
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,690
that's like insurgent killed some
insurgents. What does that, oh,

1097
01:02:14,691 --> 01:02:16,130
people that are resisting,
that are in the,

1098
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:20,190
they were born in this
place that we showed up with
tanks and they're resisting.

1099
01:02:20,191 --> 01:02:22,110
So they're insurgents, you know, oh,

1100
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:24,610
they're not just people
that live there right now.

1101
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:28,530
And then the other militants we
can, you know, throughout history,

1102
01:02:28,531 --> 01:02:33,030
people have had this incredible
ability to dehumanize with, with, uh,

1103
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:34,410
terms.
You know,

1104
01:02:34,411 --> 01:02:38,700
you can just call them something and
then they become the enemy or categorize

1105
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:41,430
them.
You know what Genghis Khan used to do?

1106
01:02:41,431 --> 01:02:46,170
Like anybody who didn't live in a tent
was, wasn't a bitch. You know, Tommy's,

1107
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:49,660
that lived in these cities. Like they,
they just treated them like cattle. Right?

1108
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:52,560
And that was why they were able to
justify killing millions and millions of

1109
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:53,340
people.

1110
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,340
And that's just one of the things that
people have figured out a way to do.

1111
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:01,740
US versus them. We love it. We
love, I fucking hate windows users.

1112
01:03:01,741 --> 01:03:06,060
You know, I'm well Mac till I
die. I mean, it gets that dumb.

1113
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,850
We literally Ford versus Chevy.

1114
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:13,230
I saw a fucking Calvin and Hobbes thing.
Yeah.

1115
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,910
Pissing on a Chevy logo.

1116
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:18,330
Like he's standing on a Ford logo
and he's pissing on a Chevy logo.

1117
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,050
If I had a fucking drone
with Hellfire missiles,

1118
01:03:22,051 --> 01:03:24,180
I might launch it at that fucking guy.

1119
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:26,500
Did anyone who was the
fake balls on there? Yeah.

1120
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:32,070
Well those could just be misguided.
No Shit.

1121
01:03:32,071 --> 01:03:34,890
If you gave me some of those fake balls
when I was 18 I might've put them on my

1122
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:37,130
car. I was retarded, you know,

1123
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:42,960
but the Calvin and Hobbes pissing on
a Ford logo, Jesus fucking Christ.

1124
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:46,470
But there's people that like this
Chevy country, if you listen quiet,

1125
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:51,471
you could hear a Ford rust like
fucking bumper stickers like that.

1126
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,550
People love to be on God damn

1127
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:57,420
teams your night blue or red.
We're,

1128
01:03:57,421 --> 01:04:00,130
we're really weird like that. And
what better way to do, you know,

1129
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:04,040
to control the population to have these
like fake teams of political parties

1130
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:08,000
that essentially there's total uniformity
when it comes to foreign policy and

1131
01:04:08,001 --> 01:04:08,860
the,
you know,

1132
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:12,770
the militarization of like this country
and surveillance and all that shit.

1133
01:04:12,771 --> 01:04:15,950
But then you just have like these
minute differences in terms of like

1134
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:19,490
integration or this and that.
Not saying that they're like known void.

1135
01:04:19,491 --> 01:04:24,230
Obviously there's like things that
are very good about the differences,

1136
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:28,370
but on a big scale it's essentially you're
driving the fucking country in at the

1137
01:04:28,371 --> 01:04:29,090
ground.

1138
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:34,050
Yeah. I think it's like what they're doing
is taking advantage of these ingrained

1139
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:39,080
tribal sensibilities that have been with
us since we were in the small groups of

1140
01:04:39,391 --> 01:04:42,180
people that had worry about
other small groups of people.

1141
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:45,270
Like we were just talking about this the
other day that this is like one of the

1142
01:04:45,271 --> 01:04:50,271
first times in human history where
if a boat load of people show up,

1143
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:54,930
it's a good thing. You know? It
used to be when a boat showed up,

1144
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,300
you're fucked.
Men are going to get off that boat.

1145
01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:01,290
They haven't seen pussy in a hundred
years. They have guns, they have no food,

1146
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:02,280
they are rickets,

1147
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:07,230
scurvy and shit and they're just going
to fucking shoot arrows at everybody and

1148
01:05:07,231 --> 01:05:10,710
rape everybody and take all your
food and light everything on fire.

1149
01:05:10,711 --> 01:05:14,520
I mean that's what people did and now
they're tourists like the, it's a,

1150
01:05:14,521 --> 01:05:18,100
it's a very weird time that we live in.
It's very in that sense

1151
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,110
like that that's never happened before.

1152
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:25,350
So I think there's a slight erosion
of this tribal attitude that you know,

1153
01:05:26,351 --> 01:05:30,160
people used to have and
it's because of access,

1154
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:32,890
because we can go to places that
we couldn't go before much easier.

1155
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:36,970
And it's also because of information
information and so it's when you have

1156
01:05:36,971 --> 01:05:39,670
enough of these kinds of conversations
and there's enough articles that are

1157
01:05:39,671 --> 01:05:40,421
written on the web,

1158
01:05:40,421 --> 01:05:45,421
there's enough conversations like real
legitimate objective conversation as

1159
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:48,490
June. People that actually know what's
going on, where they go over the,

1160
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:52,810
the facts on both sides and try to
come to some sort of a rational can QCC

1161
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,020
unbiased conclusion.
It changes the culture.

1162
01:05:56,050 --> 01:06:00,700
I mean it's slowly but surely access
changes, the culture, access to areas,

1163
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,360
changes and access to information
changes, right? We're a part of that.

1164
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:08,620
It's all going on right now.
And that's why this younger generation,

1165
01:06:08,621 --> 01:06:13,621
these people that are growing up with
no idea of life without the Internet are

1166
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,200
there, were completely repulsed by
these things that are happening.

1167
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:25,500
But I think the people that if you
polled young people today in America and

1168
01:06:25,621 --> 01:06:27,760
Canada and places where
there's no conflict,

1169
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:32,020
they don't have this ingrained sensibility
that's due to having family members

1170
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:35,980
being murdered, you know, in front of
them and you ask them about nationalism.

1171
01:06:35,981 --> 01:06:37,270
I think their attitudes had been,

1172
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:40,420
will be radically different than people
that live to a hundred years ago.

1173
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:43,790
Totally. Yeah. I think
it's the modularization of
culture and it's a lot of,

1174
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:44,691
it's the Internet.
I mean,

1175
01:06:44,691 --> 01:06:47,930
where else can you just see a guy getting
raped by a horse and Diana other than

1176
01:06:47,931 --> 01:06:50,300
the Internet? I mean, a hundred years
ago, he had never been able to see that.

1177
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,880
But I think it's true.
I think nationalism,

1178
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:55,570
I think people are realizing
how toxic it is. Um,

1179
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,230
and the more that they travel on,

1180
01:06:57,231 --> 01:07:00,410
the more that they reach out online to
people across the world and they see that

1181
01:07:00,411 --> 01:07:05,150
we're all fucking human. We all bleed the
same, we all suffer loss the same way.

1182
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:08,780
And there's only so much you can do
to indoctrinate someone to think that

1183
01:07:08,781 --> 01:07:10,580
someone else has a lesser
human being than you.

1184
01:07:10,581 --> 01:07:15,320
And I think that the more we learn about
what's going on and the more access we

1185
01:07:15,321 --> 01:07:18,830
have, that's going to really,
really a road. But fuck,

1186
01:07:18,831 --> 01:07:21,590
I mean the old guard is holding on,
they're clinging onto that man.

1187
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:23,120
They're trying,
they're clinging on.

1188
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:26,660
Well, ideology is the only thing that
glues everything in place to when you have

1189
01:07:26,661 --> 01:07:31,010
something like isis or you have like
this Palestinian versus Israel conflict.

1190
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:36,320
The ideology of religion is one of the
few things that unites people in this

1191
01:07:36,321 --> 01:07:37,430
sort of very,

1192
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:41,330
very rock solid position that just,

1193
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:45,080
it's very hard to do with when you have,
uh,

1194
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:49,070
an agnostic population,
it's very difficult to get them to just,

1195
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:53,720
except that these people in Canada are
Douche bags and we'd go over there and

1196
01:07:53,721 --> 01:07:57,110
fucking take that pine trees. It just
doesn't make any sense. You know,

1197
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,140
people would be like, what? We're
going to go to war with Canada. Right?

1198
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,730
Can you imagine if for some
reason we found, you know,

1199
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:06,620
this supply of diamonds or whatever the
fuck it is in Canada and all of a sudden,

1200
01:08:06,621 --> 01:08:09,920
you know, we started talking about
Canadian terrorism and like what?

1201
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,340
Like we're going to go over to Canada.
Like, you know, people be like,

1202
01:08:13,341 --> 01:08:16,130
get the fuck out of here.
Look like, how could they be?

1203
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,440
Well,
this is the first time

1204
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,990
ever in my life I can recall,
um,

1205
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:24,350
the public's opposition
to military action,

1206
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,430
stopping military action like Syria.
Like when was the last time,

1207
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:31,340
listen, put your hand
cup, your hand, your ear,

1208
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:34,790
and listen to the news for anything
about fucking invading Syria. It,

1209
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:37,790
it doesn't exist anymore.
That the, the, the conflict,

1210
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:42,890
the idea of the dialogue of, of going
over there and military action. It's gone.

1211
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:43,730
It's gone.

1212
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:48,230
Because the overwhelming reaction to
that goofy fucking President Obama speech

1213
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:51,480
left and right. People
are like, what? Yeah,

1214
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:53,210
you're going to put our children at risk.

1215
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:57,170
You're going to send children over
to fucking Syria for what? For?

1216
01:08:57,171 --> 01:09:00,380
What's going on over there?
Oh, someone use gas. Okay.

1217
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:01,720
Why is that the red line?
Yeah.

1218
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:05,170
What about the hundred and 50,000 people
who died at the hands of Assad and all

1219
01:09:05,171 --> 01:09:07,030
these rebels and all this
shit before that. It's like,

1220
01:09:07,031 --> 01:09:10,990
why do we have these arbitrary quote red
lines where that's when we need to go

1221
01:09:10,991 --> 01:09:13,390
and post military action? Like
what the fuck is that about? What?

1222
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:16,030
I would love to have been in the room
when they talked to Obama and then making

1223
01:09:16,031 --> 01:09:18,420
that speech, right. And
that's when, you know, and,

1224
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,410
and that's why I'm terrified
of Hillary Clinton, man.

1225
01:09:20,411 --> 01:09:25,300
Because if you read some articles about
who's really like, I mean, I think Obama,

1226
01:09:25,301 --> 01:09:28,850
once again, he's working and he's a
horrible precedent. And, um, but it,

1227
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:32,410
Hillary's fucking crazy dude.
She's like as crazy as John Mccain,

1228
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:37,510
they were like pushing him to get
into serious so hard. Any Ron. Yeah.

1229
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:41,590
Hillary was like almost the one of the
most militant military hawks in his whole

1230
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:44,260
national security team.
And Man,

1231
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:47,470
it's going to be bad news if she gets in.
I blame bill.

1232
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:53,530
She's probably a patient of when she
was younger, probably God damn hippie.

1233
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:55,510
She looked like she was,

1234
01:09:55,511 --> 01:10:00,511
she got the big eyebrows fucking glasses
dealing with bill and it's fun and it

1235
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:05,230
philandering she wants to
blow shit up now. Just anger.

1236
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:09,890
That's how you create terrorists.
Lucky she doesn't have a Dick Shit.

1237
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:15,100
Jesus Christ. She'd already be president
probably. Right, but what do you think?

1238
01:10:15,101 --> 01:10:17,170
Yeah, I mean it is
amazing and I think, um,

1239
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,290
I don't know what the fucking think
about this Ukraine Shit, man. I, I mean,

1240
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,860
were you following all that crazy
shit that happened with our tea? Oh,

1241
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:27,670
what happened? They were trying to send
you over there, right? What happened?

1242
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:30,880
What does that was, because I remember
reading that. I'm like, Oh shit,

1243
01:10:30,881 --> 01:10:33,040
they're trying to send Abby to Russia.
Wait,

1244
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:36,850
I need to go to those thoughts

1245
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:39,700
prompting again.

1246
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:44,190
Oh, oh, there's Hillary
Clinton. Oh my God.

1247
01:10:44,191 --> 01:10:46,730
Look at that photo of Hilary
Clinton. First of all, do,

1248
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,930
don't zoom in because if you do,
you miss the feet.

1249
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:51,660
Look at those Goddamn Birkenstocks.

1250
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,920
She might've had the original pair
of Birkenstocks and these pants,

1251
01:10:55,980 --> 01:11:00,980
she's wearing the striped pants that
look like a version of yoga pants in some

1252
01:11:02,851 --> 01:11:04,560
sort of a way.
They're very tight.

1253
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:06,750
Who knows what kind of
material they're made out of.

1254
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:10,920
But they're like multicolored
striped and they're all,

1255
01:11:10,921 --> 01:11:14,940
it's all pointing you towards her crotch
and some geometric pattern and she's

1256
01:11:14,941 --> 01:11:17,160
got glasses on.
What happened in the glasses?

1257
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:21,390
She's still wear glasses kind
of sometimes. Contacts. Yeah,

1258
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:24,700
I dunno that's her, that's her. When
she was young and bill and look at,

1259
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:28,530
they were hippies.
He had a like a hipster beard and,

1260
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:31,670
and she looked like a hippie.
Wow. And they were uh,

1261
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:35,550
they were young students trying to
make their way in the world. Yeah.

1262
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:36,443
Not Inhaling.

1263
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:42,100
Hailing. Yeah. Fucking
liar. Either wearing,

1264
01:11:42,101 --> 01:11:47,050
inhaling cause they were putting it up
their asses so crazy. I heard they eat it.

1265
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:50,800
If that's true. I they ate brownies. Did
you just make that up? No, I heard it.

1266
01:11:50,801 --> 01:11:52,880
Someone said that he didn't inhale.
That's why I say it.

1267
01:11:52,881 --> 01:11:57,120
It inhale cause they didn't
please he inhaled. Yeah.

1268
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:01,720
Everybody that smokes pot inhales stop.
I tried it once.

1269
01:12:01,721 --> 01:12:03,400
I didn't like it.
If he didn't like it,

1270
01:12:03,401 --> 01:12:06,640
you're hanging around with the wrong
people. Come on dude, you tell me.

1271
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:10,450
And all those chicks it he hooked up
with none of them smoked a joint before

1272
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,160
they fuck you. Get out
of here. Look at her.

1273
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,750
That's before she wanted to kill people.

1274
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:17,320
If he's smart enough to be
the damn governor of Arkansas
is smart enough to know

1275
01:12:17,321 --> 01:12:22,320
that we'd enhance a sex guy's a freak
whipping his dick out all the time cause

1276
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:24,580
she's hi Craig can do that.

1277
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:27,560
They just like fucked some girl on the
desk in the Oval Office is like guess the

1278
01:12:27,561 --> 01:12:28,180
garden shed.

1279
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:32,960
Just like super got to
do what mother fucker.

1280
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:37,060
Imagine that stress being the God damn
president needs a blow off some steam

1281
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:42,030
somehow caught the guy a little
slack. Hey that was the, hey I,

1282
01:12:42,031 --> 01:12:44,680
I don't, I don't give a fuck
about people's private lives.

1283
01:12:44,681 --> 01:12:47,200
They could have a million affairs.
I mean if you're a president,

1284
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:49,500
that's the last thing that we
should be worrying about. Yeah,

1285
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:52,730
I mean if anything it shows,
it shows you character

1286
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:53,151
dirt.

1287
01:12:53,151 --> 01:12:58,151
And it also shows if you were in a
really high profile position of power,

1288
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:04,390
it shows that you may be vulnerable
to like impulsive behavior,

1289
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:09,560
which is kind of tricky because it's
like on one hand, yeah, I think that,

1290
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,850
you know, especially if you're not in the
position to start wars and shit, like,

1291
01:13:13,851 --> 01:13:15,530
you know,
I'm not worried about what someone does.

1292
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:19,310
The fucking head of Nabisco likes to
hire hookers. Like who's this shit?

1293
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:21,470
Am I going to stop buying crackers?
You know what I mean?

1294
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:25,790
It doesn't make any sense. But when
you're like in a political position,

1295
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:26,780
when you're in a position of power,

1296
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:31,781
this is a one time when I go maybe
Chicago look at their behavior because if

1297
01:13:32,661 --> 01:13:36,560
they're doing like really blatantly
ridiculous impulsive shit,

1298
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:37,700
they might be like,

1299
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,520
yeah,
they might be a sociopath,

1300
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:43,700
but even more importantly they
might be out of control. Cause I,

1301
01:13:43,701 --> 01:13:47,210
I've known some people
that were completely out of
control and just so powerful.

1302
01:13:47,211 --> 01:13:50,240
They just think that they can
fucking do anything. Yeah. Yeah.

1303
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:52,400
When you know you're
the head of a company,

1304
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:57,030
that's not really an issue unless
there's some, some sort of our friends.

1305
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:01,550
Yeah, it's a company that kills people.
That's, that's an issue. But you know,

1306
01:14:01,551 --> 01:14:04,220
if you're making tires or something,
that's probably not an issue.

1307
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:08,030
But if you have the head of a
country that has the largest army,

1308
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:12,160
the world has ever known,
not by like a small

1309
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,020
margin, but by fuck Rome, okay,

1310
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:19,180
we've got military bases in a
hundred countries, hundred bases,

1311
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:23,800
Jesus fucking Christ like,
but Clinton,

1312
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,680
Clinton is the way I described him,

1313
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:30,340
he's the last great American Presidential
Dick's linger. They don't exist.

1314
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:33,550
And Dick Slinger, yes, there's, they don't
exist anymore. You can't do that anymore.

1315
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:34,930
There will be no more.

1316
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:39,490
Every guy from now on that gets into
that role will be a Mitt Romney time.

1317
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:44,260
There'll be super bland,
like just without any charisma whatsoever.

1318
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:47,350
Cause guys with charisma,
they get laid right. You know,

1319
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:51,100
like those JFK type guys
who can captivate a nation,

1320
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:53,510
those guys are pussy chasers.
They can't,

1321
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:56,710
he can't have a guy like that as a
president anymore. They don't exist.

1322
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:01,300
Those charismatic leaders are like
that charisma, that ability to do that.

1323
01:15:01,301 --> 01:15:05,710
It's just too intoxicating to find
that rare one that doesn't act on those

1324
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:09,550
abilities. Just this is
a different time, right?

1325
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,380
We're going to have some
weird ass fucking presence.

1326
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:16,240
I'm hoping that what it actually does
is it eliminates the position cause I

1327
01:15:16,241 --> 01:15:21,010
think the position of president is
the last great Alpha monkey position.

1328
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,390
It's a dopey idea.

1329
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:26,530
This idea that one person
as our figurehead is one
person that gets to make the

1330
01:15:26,531 --> 01:15:29,980
decisions and he can, the president
could veto it. What? One Guy?

1331
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:35,080
300 the one guy for 300 million.
How's that fucking real?

1332
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:36,250
How was that still real?

1333
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:38,220
Right.
And then I love how people,

1334
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:41,430
they blame him and then they also
excuse everything on him. They're like,

1335
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,950
oh well he, you know, a president willing
to do some Motrin, but then they're like,

1336
01:15:43,951 --> 01:15:45,690
but a president should be
able to do this and that.

1337
01:15:45,691 --> 01:15:47,880
It's like way too much fucking power.

1338
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:51,300
And then also the supreme court I think
really pisses me off though because

1339
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:54,060
we're talking about a court that we have
nothing to do with. And they're like,

1340
01:15:54,061 --> 01:15:58,020
the end all be all arbitrators have a
lot of different shit and it's fucking

1341
01:15:58,021 --> 01:16:00,930
terrifying cause they're just fucking
elected until death. They're appointed.

1342
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:05,580
They're basically like running this
fucking monarchy and it's, it's crazy.

1343
01:16:05,581 --> 01:16:06,420
It's disgusting.

1344
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:08,880
There's a couple of fucking fascist
sitting on the supreme court and I don't

1345
01:16:08,881 --> 01:16:13,000
want them to have the decisions.
Scalia's it's sick. Fuck. He's crazy.

1346
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,660
Alito Scalia still wants
sodomy to be illegal.

1347
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:18,550
Yeah. That's how fucking warped
he is. He's actually said,

1348
01:16:18,551 --> 01:16:21,310
if people choose to have
men choose to marry men,

1349
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:22,870
what's going to stop them
from having sex with,

1350
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:27,450
you're like, I dunno where you're,
that's a sick fucking trajectory, dude.

1351
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:32,280
What's going to stop them from marrying
pigeons? They're like, I'm sorry.

1352
01:16:32,281 --> 01:16:33,540
How are you Supreme Court judges?

1353
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:36,670
Can Mary Pigeons All you want?
I don't give a fuck.

1354
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:38,340
Um, I wanted to, yeah.

1355
01:16:38,341 --> 01:16:41,580
So what were you thinking when all this
fucking Rte should happen? I mean, I

1356
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:42,413
was worried about you.

1357
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:47,910
I was worried about you because you
were criticizing the Putin regime and,

1358
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:52,650
well, here's the thing. Okay. And
I've had many people tweet at me, oh,

1359
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:55,200
she's moved piece for fucking
right. Right, right, right, right.

1360
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:01,350
They give you an incredible
amount of editorial leeway.

1361
01:17:01,351 --> 01:17:03,420
It's very obvious if
you watched the things,

1362
01:17:03,421 --> 01:17:07,320
me as your friend and knowing you and
having these long conversations with you

1363
01:17:07,321 --> 01:17:11,570
and then seeing you talk those,
that's fucking Abby Martin period.

1364
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:15,740
And I don't know how much oversight
they have over the things that you say,

1365
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:18,460
but when you're talking,
this is, you know,

1366
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:23,500
this is your opinions on these things
and your opinions in in many situations,

1367
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:28,810
critical of Russia and critical of Putin
and critical of this military regime

1368
01:17:29,451 --> 01:17:31,490
and their actions.
And you know,

1369
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,960
there was this backlash where they were
saying they wanted to send you over,

1370
01:17:35,961 --> 01:17:39,830
where were they saying they were going
to send and what, what area was this?

1371
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:40,690
What was going on?

1372
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:44,860
So that was, that was like Russia did
this military incursion into Crimea,

1373
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:47,530
right when all the Ukraine coup happen.

1374
01:17:47,531 --> 01:17:50,770
And then all of a sudden
the Russian military is like
making all these maneuvers

1375
01:17:50,771 --> 01:17:51,850
on the border of Ukraine.

1376
01:17:51,851 --> 01:17:54,700
And Crimea was basically the first
little territory right there.

1377
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:59,050
It was fucking crazy. Cause I
hear, and this is what's so hard,

1378
01:17:59,051 --> 01:18:02,920
is like working at our t,
the world hates Russia right now.

1379
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:05,020
Like the world fucking
hate trash right now.

1380
01:18:05,021 --> 01:18:08,770
And we're being told in the media
all day putins the, you know,

1381
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:11,380
the biggest villain in the world.
We should all fucking hate Russia.

1382
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,520
And then we're seeing like all of this
shit about the gay law and pussy riot and

1383
01:18:15,521 --> 01:18:19,210
all this stuff. So it's
really tough already to just
be working there, you know,

1384
01:18:19,211 --> 01:18:21,880
already. And it's even
tougher to know what the fuck.

1385
01:18:21,881 --> 01:18:24,610
The truth is when we already know
how biased the mainstream media is,

1386
01:18:24,611 --> 01:18:26,530
especially the way that they're
covering Israel, Palestine.

1387
01:18:26,531 --> 01:18:28,450
So when they're all telling us one thing,

1388
01:18:28,990 --> 01:18:32,050
but then all I'm getting is actual
like Russian sources. I'm like,

1389
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:36,310
I don't fucking believe anything
that I'm seeing. Are you getting

1390
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:37,940
like an agenda?

1391
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:43,170
Oh No, I have total editorial freedom.
Here's the thing, rt Russia today,

1392
01:18:43,171 --> 01:18:44,160
you know it in the name.

1393
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:49,280
It's literally the name of what the
biases it was created to put the Russian

1394
01:18:49,321 --> 01:18:51,410
perspective out in the world.
Um,

1395
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:53,600
of course it's going to be
fucking biased toward Russia.

1396
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:56,100
You wind up working for Russia today.

1397
01:18:56,101 --> 01:18:59,820
That's a very strange condition for
someone as opinionated as you it is.

1398
01:18:59,821 --> 01:19:03,900
I was actually covering a occupy
Oakland and Artie was the only media

1399
01:19:03,901 --> 01:19:06,270
organization like covering
the protest movement.

1400
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:09,720
And so I kept seeing this weird like
Russian channel out there and I was like,

1401
01:19:09,721 --> 01:19:10,260
I don't know what the,

1402
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:12,720
why the fuck this is Russian
stations covering occupy was like,

1403
01:19:12,721 --> 01:19:16,830
but it's great and I'm so grateful to
have this platform that they're at least

1404
01:19:16,831 --> 01:19:18,190
covering what's going on.
And,

1405
01:19:18,191 --> 01:19:20,940
and I really think it's because of
our [inaudible] coverage and they were

1406
01:19:20,941 --> 01:19:22,620
nominated for an Emmy for it.
That it really,

1407
01:19:22,621 --> 01:19:26,070
like we were able to see all the videos
go viral and I think it forced the

1408
01:19:26,071 --> 01:19:28,770
mainstream media to at least pay a
little bit of attention to occupy.

1409
01:19:28,771 --> 01:19:30,030
But that's how I got involved.

1410
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:34,590
I saw our tea all over the place
in terms of occupies shit and um,

1411
01:19:34,591 --> 01:19:36,650
they wanted me to come and have a show.
I mean they,

1412
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:40,680
they like their whole thing is they offer
the perspectives that you don't see so

1413
01:19:40,681 --> 01:19:43,620
they can like have the very extreme
libertarian voice and then they have like

1414
01:19:43,621 --> 01:19:44,640
the socialist voice.

1415
01:19:44,641 --> 01:19:47,820
They have looked the anarchist voice
and it just breaking through all the

1416
01:19:47,821 --> 01:19:50,220
mainstream media bullshit.
But when you're looking at the bias,

1417
01:19:50,221 --> 01:19:52,560
of course they're going to have
a fucking pro Russian bias.

1418
01:19:52,561 --> 01:19:53,760
It's funded by the Russian government,

1419
01:19:53,761 --> 01:19:58,080
just like you have the Al Jazeera is
Qatar, the emir of Qatar funds Al Jazeera,

1420
01:19:58,081 --> 01:20:01,580
just like BBC is run by the British
fucking crown dude. All of these,

1421
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,190
does that bother you working there?

1422
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:08,310
Um, it bothers me when people tell me
that I'm a propagandists and that I'm a

1423
01:20:08,311 --> 01:20:11,760
mouthpiece for Putin because I've already
displayed multiple times that I will

1424
01:20:11,761 --> 01:20:15,990
risk my job to speak out against
Putin if I feel like I want to.

1425
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,380
And I have to. And that's what ha well
that, that I've done it twice already.

1426
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:24,381
One time I saw all this
military maneuvering and
Crimea and I made a statement

1427
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,580
and of course the mainstream
media picked it up,

1428
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,360
touted me as this anti Russian hero
just because they had no idea who I was.

1429
01:20:30,361 --> 01:20:33,300
They didn't know how fucking controversial
my show was and how I like criticize

1430
01:20:33,301 --> 01:20:35,730
the US empire all the time.
So they picked the statement up,

1431
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:40,350
made me an overnight sensation and then
they quickly realize like I was way too

1432
01:20:40,351 --> 01:20:41,610
controversial to be lauded.

1433
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:46,950
So they ended up calling me like a fucking
crazy conspiracy theorist, you know,

1434
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:50,940
lunatic. But what was
really crazy about that, um,

1435
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,270
and I want to talk about our and more,

1436
01:20:52,271 --> 01:20:55,380
but what was so fucking crazy is if
anyone has watched house of cards,

1437
01:20:55,381 --> 01:20:57,870
that's exactly how this shit
actually operates in DC.

1438
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:01,110
Like I made the statement
and in this girl was wall,

1439
01:21:01,111 --> 01:21:04,860
which was my colleague and actually one
of my best friends in DC saw all the

1440
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:08,280
attention that I was getting and she was
just like a newsreader, very generic,

1441
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:11,640
never heard her voice, any opinions.
Two days after this happened,

1442
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,430
I was getting all this
international precedents.

1443
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:18,150
So she resigns live on air and is like,
I can't work for Putin. I'm a mat.

1444
01:21:18,151 --> 01:21:20,700
Like this is a horrible network and we're,

1445
01:21:20,701 --> 01:21:23,970
and you know I'm for the truth and I'm
like pro American and all the shit.

1446
01:21:23,971 --> 01:21:28,971
And then she got picked up
and loaded all this shit.

1447
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:32,040
And then I found out that
there was actually this
think tank called the foreign

1448
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:35,730
policy initiative. This is where it gets
fucking weird full of neoconservatives.

1449
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:39,180
It's the same people who started
the Iraq war bill crystal,

1450
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:42,870
you know all these motherfuckers
who basically force us into Iraq.

1451
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:46,620
They are like the most militant neo-con
faction of the entire DC establishment.

1452
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:50,370
They've resurrected into a new think tank
called the foreign policy initiative.

1453
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:53,820
And I found out that Liz was like
essentially being used by these people.

1454
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:58,110
These people probably reached out to
her and they just said like, look,

1455
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:01,530
we're gonna like help you get this media
tour behind you because their whole

1456
01:22:01,531 --> 01:22:03,270
platform,
if you look at their mission statement,

1457
01:22:03,271 --> 01:22:06,990
they want a new cold war with Russia.
That's what the FPI is all about.

1458
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:09,600
And then you saw Liz
working with these dudes,

1459
01:22:09,601 --> 01:22:13,770
like she was just this fucking idiot
pawn who was basically used by all these

1460
01:22:13,771 --> 01:22:18,630
dudes in this neo-con think tank to
spread their agenda and that and it just,

1461
01:22:18,631 --> 01:22:20,250
it was so fucking crazy.

1462
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:23,580
And these people in this think tank are
the ones that went out on the media and

1463
01:22:23,581 --> 01:22:26,370
called me crazy. They were
like, Abby's a false flag.

1464
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:30,810
Putin had Abby do this to make our t
look like it's a legitimate news station.

1465
01:22:30,811 --> 01:22:32,880
Like they let journalists have
editorial freedom. They're like,

1466
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:37,881
Liz is the real hero because she quit
and she like hates Russia and like we

1467
01:22:37,981 --> 01:22:40,800
should all pay attention to her. And
I was like, this is fucking crazy.

1468
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:43,170
This is all like been manufactured.
And that's why I was like,

1469
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:44,880
this is absolutely insane.

1470
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,200
And I just saw this media machine
spinning and I was like the,

1471
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:51,480
I was like being victimized by the
media machine that I critique every day.

1472
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:52,763
That's fast.

1473
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:57,510
That's fascinating to watch.
Propaganda disseminate, isn't it? Yeah.

1474
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:58,513
Fascinating.

1475
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:03,820
Seeds and water and grows and,
and then they,

1476
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:04,990
they catch it and run with,

1477
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,650
it was unreal. Men. Um, so
you're a Putin mouthpiece.

1478
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:09,940
That's what we've gotten out of this.

1479
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:12,490
But it was hilarious cause I woke up
the next morning after making that

1480
01:23:12,491 --> 01:23:16,240
statement and I woke up to a
press release saying we don't,

1481
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,570
we don't push our journalists and to
saying what they need to say and like,

1482
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,700
you know, but that's why we're shipping
Abby to Crimea. And I was like, pardon me,

1483
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,840
fucking going to cry me as a fucking war
zone. Yeah. What did they say to you?

1484
01:23:28,841 --> 01:23:31,150
What was the actual conversation with you?

1485
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:36,151
Because I remember they said someone had
said we want to send her there so she

1486
01:23:36,191 --> 01:23:40,480
can see it on the ground and see
what the situation actually is.

1487
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:44,320
What was their contention where they were
saying that there was something wrong

1488
01:23:44,321 --> 01:23:45,340
with your perception of it?

1489
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:49,480
Here's the problem and I've learned a
lot more about Crimea since I still stand

1490
01:23:49,481 --> 01:23:50,350
by everything I said.

1491
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:55,060
But Russians have a very strong allegiance
with Crimea because Ukraine is like

1492
01:23:55,061 --> 01:23:56,890
half Russian speakers.
Ukraine.

1493
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:01,820
I know like a lot of Ukrainians that I
know are literally identify with Russia,

1494
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,910
like they speak Russian and they
don't speak Ukrainian and shit.

1495
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:06,730
So Crimea to them was actually like,

1496
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:10,220
they were scared and they did reach
out and they wanted help. Not, I'm,

1497
01:24:10,221 --> 01:24:13,690
I'm not justifying the military action
whatsoever and I think it was really

1498
01:24:13,691 --> 01:24:17,440
wrong to have these maneuvers right on
the heels of the school they worried

1499
01:24:17,441 --> 01:24:19,520
about with Crimea.
Um,

1500
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:23,530
they were worried about the new interim
government and how there's just like a

1501
01:24:23,531 --> 01:24:25,060
lot of lawlessness,
lawlessness.

1502
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:28,930
There's like all this shit going down
and I guess they reached out and wanted

1503
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:32,530
this referendum. I don't know if it was
a fair referendum. I don't fucking know.

1504
01:24:32,531 --> 01:24:33,370
I'm not over there,

1505
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:38,640
but my boss and I think the boss of
the whole RTI operation really didn't

1506
01:24:39,131 --> 01:24:41,200
understand what the fuck I was doing.
They were like,

1507
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:44,440
I don't fucking get what you're talking
about. They're like, we're rushing.

1508
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,940
You don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

1509
01:24:45,941 --> 01:24:48,400
You need to go over there
and check it out. To me,

1510
01:24:48,401 --> 01:24:52,150
I felt like it was a very Russian front
dish, punitive like threat, like, oh,

1511
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:55,330
we're going to ship you there, see you
learn for yourself. And I was like,

1512
01:24:55,331 --> 01:24:59,110
what in the Holy Hell? Like obviously I'm
not going to go. And I told him, I said,

1513
01:24:59,111 --> 01:24:59,261
look,

1514
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:03,130
I'll go if you give me like weeks that I
can prepare for war training and making

1515
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:07,390
my contacts in Kiev and shit. I was
like, I would definitely consider going,

1516
01:25:07,391 --> 01:25:11,440
but I'm not just going to go there
tomorrow. Like what was the conversation?

1517
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:16,090
They pull you into the office and we
want to talk to you about so much shit on

1518
01:25:16,091 --> 01:25:19,570
TV and uh,
we want to send you over to a war zone.

1519
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,450
So I woke up and to this press
release without even being asked.

1520
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:25,930
So I go into work knowing, and my boss
calls me and he's like, Hey, I'd be,

1521
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:30,120
we need to talk to is like, I have like,
uh, he was like, he was like, we want to,

1522
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:32,140
he's like, I have a really
great offer for you. I'm like,

1523
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:34,390
I'm going to send me to Crimea.
Shit me there. I was like,

1524
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:36,400
is that the offer because I'm not going.
And I was like,

1525
01:25:36,401 --> 01:25:40,060
I woke up to already saying that I was
so maybe you guys gotta get your shit

1526
01:25:40,061 --> 01:25:43,570
together and like fix these narratives
before you tell the world that I'm being

1527
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:46,780
shipped there. So we worried about
being fired. Will you ready to walk?

1528
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:50,500
I was ready to walk at that point and
I was just trying to see what they were

1529
01:25:50,501 --> 01:25:53,590
going to do. But I think I went into
my boss's office and I was like, look,

1530
01:25:53,591 --> 01:25:56,470
this is actually the best thing that's
ever happened to our tea. I was like,

1531
01:25:56,680 --> 01:26:00,190
let me say what I want to say because
people call this network of Putin

1532
01:26:00,191 --> 01:26:01,300
mouthpiece and I was like,

1533
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:05,060
and you know for good reason because
it does pair it the Russian line.

1534
01:26:05,061 --> 01:26:09,170
I was like, but if you let me go out
there and fucking criticize Russia,

1535
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:13,940
that's good. That's good. And I was like,
even Fox News has diverse opinions on,

1536
01:26:13,941 --> 01:26:18,260
they had Alan Colmes even though he was
like, oh pussy, you know what I mean?

1537
01:26:18,261 --> 01:26:21,370
But at least they had that space where
they could be like, we, you know,

1538
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:24,470
we have liberals on sometimes it's
like you need that if you want to be

1539
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:27,350
legitimate. And so I was like, fucking
run with it. Let me do my thing.

1540
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:28,820
And at the end of the day,

1541
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:34,040
I give them inordinate credit for
fucking letting me stay and letting me be

1542
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:36,320
there. And you know, I don't
know what's going to happen.

1543
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:40,280
But you cannot say the same for a lot
of corporate media stations that fired

1544
01:26:40,281 --> 01:26:41,810
people for criticizing war,

1545
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:45,890
which is even scarier to me because
those aren't even funded by the US

1546
01:26:45,891 --> 01:26:46,724
government.

1547
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:51,740
Yeah. But they're, yeah,
they're all terrified of the
wrath of the u s government.

1548
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:54,980
The access to stories you
access to interviews, you know,

1549
01:26:54,981 --> 01:26:58,970
whenever you see Obama sit down with
bill O'Reilly, cross leg it, you know,

1550
01:26:58,971 --> 01:27:01,500
they're sitting there
like to jump to them.

1551
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:06,830
They're fucking their feet dangling over
your other needs. Like all casual or

1552
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:11,030
bizarre. Strange. Really.

1553
01:27:11,031 --> 01:27:14,960
Incestual it's weird because you
know that there's certain things,

1554
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,690
they're not allowed to say questions
and are not allowed to ask.

1555
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:21,470
Like you don't get that job
unless it's your safe as fuck.

1556
01:27:21,471 --> 01:27:24,050
You're walking into a nerf to room.
You know,

1557
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,410
and O'Reilly can pretend to play hardball,

1558
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:29,400
but it's going to be about economics
where Obama care or something like

1559
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:33,360
we knew it was going to be about Ben
Gazi, IRS and Obamacare. Like he probably,

1560
01:27:33,361 --> 01:27:36,660
they probably already agreed to the terms.
It was all pre taped, all that shit.

1561
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:40,610
We torture some folks
torture,

1562
01:27:40,650 --> 01:27:43,020
but I went after this whole thing happens.
I was like,

1563
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:45,930
I went on Piers Morgan and Piers Morgan.

1564
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:47,390
What a Dick Wad that guy.

1565
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,770
That was hilarious because he had no idea.

1566
01:27:49,771 --> 01:27:52,780
Like he just thought that I'd go on there
and just talk all this shit about like

1567
01:27:52,781 --> 01:27:53,770
throwing my network under the best,

1568
01:27:53,771 --> 01:27:56,260
throw all my work that I'd done
there under the bus and just be like,

1569
01:27:56,261 --> 01:27:58,990
so you know you're working for this
overt propaganda machine. I was like,

1570
01:27:59,470 --> 01:28:02,170
no different than you bro.
Like no different than you.

1571
01:28:02,171 --> 01:28:04,450
It was like fucking look at
what you guys have been doing.

1572
01:28:04,451 --> 01:28:06,640
You guys have been warm on.
Green us.

1573
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,610
He's a fool.
It's unbelievable.

1574
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:14,680
He's a very strange fool because I find
it incredibly odd that they gave that

1575
01:28:14,681 --> 01:28:18,790
guy that job after his whole scandal
with, Oh I know the phone, tapping,

1576
01:28:18,791 --> 01:28:21,130
standing peep of victims phones.

1577
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:25,930
And then did you ever see Chelsea
Handler manhandle him? She handled him.

1578
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:30,310
That was really awkward. She
destroyed him. It was hilarious.

1579
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:35,090
Oh she seems so irritating. I don't even
want to fucking be here right now. Rich.

1580
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:39,820
Fuck. She doesn't give a shit.
She's a comic and a drunk and uh,

1581
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:44,320
has it all out on the table.
She gives zero fucks,

1582
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:46,000
you know.
So Pierce Morgan,

1583
01:28:46,001 --> 01:28:49,510
not paying attention to her and not even
talking to her and in between takes and

1584
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:51,150
going over his notes and stuff.

1585
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:53,280
Tex Winter Shit.
Yeah,

1586
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:58,260
but I think self censorship is probably
the biggest issue that you see on media.

1587
01:28:58,261 --> 01:29:01,920
And this is what the point that I
was trying to make is that I'm like,

1588
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:06,150
the only thing that I self censor about
is Russia because it's funded by fucking

1589
01:29:06,151 --> 01:29:07,920
restaurant.
The money comes from everywhere.

1590
01:29:07,921 --> 01:29:09,510
Even if you're looking at Pierre Omidyar,

1591
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:12,000
there's a lot of fucking dirty
money that's going into that.

1592
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:14,940
Like a lot of neo liberal fucked
up policies that he's done.

1593
01:29:14,941 --> 01:29:18,480
It's like no matter what,
if you want the platform,

1594
01:29:18,510 --> 01:29:21,420
unless you're Joe Rogan and
have the Joe Rogan experience,

1595
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:23,850
the money's coming from somewhere.
Fucking shady man.

1596
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:25,580
Do the Abby Martin experience.

1597
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:28,930
I think I might, man. I mean
I think I might at some point,

1598
01:29:28,931 --> 01:29:31,660
but it's just like might have to, you
know what I mean? I mean if shit gets,

1599
01:29:31,661 --> 01:29:34,180
if shit keeps going
spiraling out of control,

1600
01:29:34,181 --> 01:29:39,181
I don't know how much longer I can like
be at an organization with dirty money

1601
01:29:39,251 --> 01:29:42,370
and still not, you know, not
feel like a hypocrite and shit.

1602
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:47,980
But it really does come from everywhere.
Whether you're looking at MSNBC, NBC, CNN,

1603
01:29:47,981 --> 01:29:52,630
and I think that the biggest problem is
that those have dozens if not hundreds

1604
01:29:52,631 --> 01:29:56,200
of conflicts of interest. At
least you know rts, Russia,

1605
01:29:56,590 --> 01:30:00,310
you're not going to get news about Russia
from our tea. That's pretty obvious.

1606
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,530
But if I'm watching MSNBC,

1607
01:30:02,531 --> 01:30:05,830
how many dozens of corporate advertisers
am I not going to get the truth about

1608
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:09,850
how much are they self censoring
about the US are about Israel.

1609
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:10,361
You know what I mean?

1610
01:30:10,361 --> 01:30:13,810
And so that's where it gets really tricky
because even though it's much more of

1611
01:30:13,811 --> 01:30:14,710
a gray area,

1612
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:18,880
and I'd rather know the bias and I'd
rather know exactly who is funding the

1613
01:30:18,881 --> 01:30:21,610
organization so I can maneuver
around that and get the truth.

1614
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,960
It's working for any company that
gets their money from various sources,

1615
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:31,210
whether it's the Russian government,

1616
01:30:31,211 --> 01:30:36,211
whether it's corporations that sponsor
shows and want you to keep a non

1617
01:30:36,821 --> 01:30:37,990
confrontational,

1618
01:30:37,991 --> 01:30:42,991
non controversial stance on their network
because they have this agenda because

1619
01:30:43,811 --> 01:30:48,100
they're trying to promote as many
products as possible during the commercial

1620
01:30:48,101 --> 01:30:48,521
breaks.

1621
01:30:48,521 --> 01:30:52,270
I mean there's a whole bunch of reasons
because they want to negotiate good

1622
01:30:52,271 --> 01:30:56,770
guests. They want to make high
profile political guests feel at home.

1623
01:30:56,980 --> 01:30:58,850
So they have to censor opinions. Okay. Tax

1624
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:01,760
Us. Yeah. Not Access baby. Yeah.

1625
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:05,060
You know what we were saying before
about absolutism and that's what,

1626
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:07,670
that's why I work for our tea.
Because if I was an absolute, it's,

1627
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:10,040
that'd be living in the fucking jungle,
drinking rainwater.

1628
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:14,870
I have an iPhone like criticized,
you know, PR the NSA a lot.

1629
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:18,080
But look at fucking Facebook and apple,
they're all working with the NSA.

1630
01:31:18,081 --> 01:31:19,430
They're offering these backdoors.

1631
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:24,260
I use these tools because I care more
about the truth and I'm giving up and I'm

1632
01:31:24,261 --> 01:31:28,190
compromising my moral values a little
bit because I'm not a fucking absolutest

1633
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:31,970
because I believe in the bigger picture
that this is a platform that's going to

1634
01:31:31,971 --> 01:31:34,130
get the truth out to as
many people as possible.

1635
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:38,360
That I'm using Facebook to spread the
message about this and that. And I,

1636
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:43,070
I value that more than I do like cutting
off all social media because I believe

1637
01:31:43,071 --> 01:31:45,170
in privacy to the absolute extreme.

1638
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:49,100
So I guess there's a lot of compromises
that you make living in this society

1639
01:31:49,101 --> 01:31:52,070
that we live in. And you
know, it's just tough.

1640
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:56,060
You mentioned commercials,
Dude, pharmaceutical industry.

1641
01:31:56,300 --> 01:32:00,160
The U S is only one of two countries
in the entire world that allows direct

1642
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:03,550
to consumer advertising about
pharmaceuticals and guess
who's fucking preventing

1643
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:04,840
weed legalization than us?

1644
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:09,830
Yeah, partnership for drug free America.
What is hilarious? Unbelievable.

1645
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:13,790
They are funded by pharmaceutical
companies, drugs fund,

1646
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:17,280
anti-drug commercials, kid, kid group Shit

1647
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:20,000
like kids for a drug free America.

1648
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:23,180
You're like you're pedaling but yet
you're giving Adderall a two year olds.

1649
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:26,550
Well they used to take my
alcohol companies. They stopped.

1650
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:28,520
Now it's just pharmaceuticals.

1651
01:32:28,730 --> 01:32:33,140
It's fucking real partnership
for a drug free America. Yeah.

1652
01:32:33,141 --> 01:32:36,740
I had a joke that it was just like hookers
doing commercials against strippers.

1653
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,113
That's

1654
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,670
drug free America.
Having commercials against weed,

1655
01:32:42,030 --> 01:32:45,960
pharmaceutical drugs kill a lot
of fucking people. We'd kill zero.

1656
01:32:45,961 --> 01:32:50,130
Like the idea behind it is so hilarious.
It's just gross.

1657
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:54,030
It's gross and more transparent now
than ever before. And that's why,

1658
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:57,060
you know you're not seeing that
talking dog commercial anymore.

1659
01:32:57,270 --> 01:33:00,300
It's really hard to push those things.
It was just a few years ago.

1660
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:02,790
You know Lindsey,
I wish you wouldn't smoke weed.

1661
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:06,360
Not the same and you smoke it
and wish you were on Ahcccs

1662
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:10,440
so you just
take some fucking,

1663
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:15,120
take some Adderall, get shit done.
Become a part of the workforce.

1664
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:16,860
Lindsey worker,

1665
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:22,330
fucking Adderall, man.
That shit's everywhere.

1666
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:25,750
I know so many people that are on that
now. It's my God and really confusing.

1667
01:33:25,751 --> 01:33:30,140
It's like you become some hyper
vigilant corporate entities,

1668
01:33:30,141 --> 01:33:33,730
some mass producing consumer.
This,

1669
01:33:33,731 --> 01:33:36,610
this person that can work 16 hours a day,

1670
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:41,611
hardcore and you just taxing and red
lining your system all day saying,

1671
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,020
yeah, I know it dude's got
a serious problem with it.
You can, you can't get off.

1672
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:49,990
And He fucking loves
it. Yum. Yum. Yum. Cha

1673
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:53,380
10,000 kids right now.
Think about how many fucking kids,

1674
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:56,230
two to three years old are on Adderall.
Oh yeah.

1675
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,570
Is What are you first scribing to
fucking babies? Babies being a baby.

1676
01:34:01,571 --> 01:34:03,700
I'm tired of it.
I can't deal with the doctor.

1677
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:06,890
Well, I had a next door neighbor did.
There's nothing wrong with their kid.

1678
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:09,710
They got their kid on Ritalin or
something. One of those things.

1679
01:34:09,711 --> 01:34:13,700
PROZAC riddling something, some sort of
uh, uh, control the fucking kid drug.

1680
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:17,720
And it was really bizarre, bizarre to
see this little kid become like a Zombie,

1681
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:22,740
you know, just like dead, dead eyes
wandering around. I mean, they,

1682
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:27,350
these people were such shitty neighbors.
They had a dog that was just so wild.

1683
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,320
They had a weird fence,
like the kind of had a fence,

1684
01:34:30,321 --> 01:34:32,810
but any dog could go over there.
Like they had a fence,

1685
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:36,500
it was connected to a hill so the dog
could just go up the hill and over the

1686
01:34:36,501 --> 01:34:39,350
fence. And I was like, Bro,
you got to put a real fucking,

1687
01:34:39,351 --> 01:34:41,090
like their dog would growl at me and shit.

1688
01:34:41,330 --> 01:34:45,110
And I told him that his dog growled at
me and he made up some crazy story about

1689
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:48,230
my dog getting out and like,
does dog tried to attack him?

1690
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:51,440
He grabbed him by his neck and he was
like, this fucking fat out of shape.

1691
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,393
Dumpy dude.
I'm like,

1692
01:34:52,670 --> 01:34:55,880
you grabbed that dog's neck and kept
that doc from I'm talking is a big dog.

1693
01:34:55,881 --> 01:34:59,000
I'm like, that dog didn't try to,
plus my dog's not like aggressive,

1694
01:34:59,030 --> 01:35:00,320
like you're an asshole.
Right.

1695
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:03,320
Just making up some story
because his dog is creepy.

1696
01:35:03,321 --> 01:35:06,140
He's dog would like rally
people and Shit. So, um,

1697
01:35:06,141 --> 01:35:09,590
it was the same guy that had
this kid that was just a kid.

1698
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:12,080
It was just a kid and they just
didn't want to deal with it.

1699
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:14,810
They didn't want to deal. Kids
need a God, they need a tension.

1700
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:20,030
The mom was whacked out of her mind on
all sorts of fucking pills and the father

1701
01:35:20,031 --> 01:35:24,710
was just sort of absentee, worked all day,
12 hours a day, every day, never home.

1702
01:35:24,711 --> 01:35:27,740
And then when he was home the kid was too
much noise. So like put it up on pills,

1703
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:30,410
get him on pills.
I was this crazy show.

1704
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:33,690
My strange addiction where people eat
like fucking upholstery and thank,

1705
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:38,520
I was watching one where their fucking
eat and taste like scotch tape. Third.

1706
01:35:38,730 --> 01:35:39,580
Do you think third,

1707
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:43,260
third world countries and then that
problem or is it just this vacuous like

1708
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,400
vapid like identity crisis
of American just being like,

1709
01:35:46,401 --> 01:35:47,900
what the fuck is life all about?
I don't know.

1710
01:35:47,901 --> 01:35:51,620
I mean I'm generalizing American culture
maybe way too much, but I've always,

1711
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:55,040
where's that come from? Well,
people are fucking soft, you know,

1712
01:35:55,070 --> 01:35:57,410
it's this life is a little bit too easy.

1713
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:01,070
It's a little too easy to go to the
supermarket and get your food a little too

1714
01:36:01,071 --> 01:36:03,440
easy to drive in the Jack in
the box and get your food.

1715
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:08,720
It's a little too easy to exist in
this weird world that is completely and

1716
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:12,950
totally unnatural. This cubicle world,
this world of sitting in a desk all day,

1717
01:36:12,951 --> 01:36:16,670
it's just not natural and
we're fucked up. We're, we're,

1718
01:36:16,671 --> 01:36:18,890
we're all really screwed
up because of that,

1719
01:36:18,891 --> 01:36:21,890
because of this unnatural existence
that our bodies are not designed for,

1720
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:26,330
our minds are not designed for. So people
get wacky, they started eating tape,

1721
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:31,690
started chewing. I'm fucking
the upholstery and eat
and curtains and you know,

1722
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:33,830
it's fucking strange.
I mean,

1723
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:38,490
if you look at like a
perfect example is act.

1724
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:42,530
It's all about access, right?
Because in Florida they have the,

1725
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:47,330
it's better now, but they had a
real issue for a long time before,

1726
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:51,620
um, before they put out that
documentary, the oxycontin express,

1727
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:54,320
that was crazy.
Oh yeah.

1728
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:58,910
Where they call centers or whatever that
they just fuck pain management centers.

1729
01:36:58,990 --> 01:37:02,930
What's the address there?
Everywhere on the address.

1730
01:37:02,931 --> 01:37:06,320
It's just like close your eyes and throw
a dart at the map of Florida and you'll

1731
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:09,290
fucking hit one.
And they were one stop shops,

1732
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:11,330
which is disturbing it up.

1733
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:16,331
But what's more disturbing was
that they didn't have a database.

1734
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:21,760
So you could go to a doctor Jamie over
here and get a prescription and then,

1735
01:37:22,941 --> 01:37:23,391
you know,

1736
01:37:23,391 --> 01:37:26,660
you could go down the street and go to
doctor Mike and get a prescription from

1737
01:37:26,661 --> 01:37:30,440
him, and then you can go down the street
further the doctor Michelle and get a

1738
01:37:30,441 --> 01:37:33,260
prescription from her and
there's no one stop you. There's,

1739
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:36,500
there's no one to know what you've
done. They, there was nothing.

1740
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:37,850
And so because of that,

1741
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:42,990
there was this insane number of people
that were on oxycontins. Like I'll,

1742
01:37:42,991 --> 01:37:45,350
I'll, I'll pull up the data,
I'll pull up the actual,

1743
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:49,460
but the number of prescriptions of people,
um,

1744
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:54,640
of prescriptions that people
had oxycontin's in Florida
as opposed to the rest

1745
01:37:55,831 --> 01:37:56,230
of the world.

1746
01:37:56,230 --> 01:37:58,780
And it's also where all the
drug dealers go to buy it.

1747
01:37:58,781 --> 01:38:02,410
And then they just go to their
respective states and sell. Yeah.

1748
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:03,790
It's fucking nuts.

1749
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:09,160
Yeah. It was real. It was real nuts. It
was something like 90%. No Way. Yeah.

1750
01:38:09,161 --> 01:38:11,410
90% of the,
um,

1751
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:15,910
of all of the prescriptions in
the country, we're in Florida.

1752
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:19,040
Oh yeah. Well, Americans,

1753
01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:23,720
I mean we can assume more opiates than
any other country in the world. Um,

1754
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:27,440
there's like some insane stat,
like 40% of Americans are on,

1755
01:38:27,441 --> 01:38:32,000
like at least I think it's
honestly like five pills or more.

1756
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:35,450
And I'm, I mean, I might be exaggerating,
but remember all last time Joe,

1757
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:39,920
we were talking about the
opium and Afghanistan. Yes.
Did you hear that? We are.

1758
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:44,930
The NSA is tapping every single phone
call and storing it and recording it in

1759
01:38:46,341 --> 01:38:48,980
Afghanistan.
That convinced to me that sealed the deal,

1760
01:38:48,981 --> 01:38:50,750
that we're like running drugs from there.
I was like,

1761
01:38:50,751 --> 01:38:54,620
so you're telling me that all every single
audio phone call that's made is being

1762
01:38:54,621 --> 01:38:58,160
tapped in start by the NSA and we're
still allowing 90% of the world's heroin

1763
01:38:58,161 --> 01:39:00,980
from coming out of there.
That's even fucking crazier.

1764
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:01,621
Well,
it is.

1765
01:39:01,621 --> 01:39:06,621
But see what people get confused about
when it comes to this idea of tapping

1766
01:39:07,051 --> 01:39:11,820
phones is that there's a person that's
monitoring Abby Martin is a person that's

1767
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:16,020
monitoring me as a person that's
got amber lions number. No,

1768
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:17,850
it's all just being stored.

1769
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:21,060
And if you get arrested then,

1770
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,910
then they're going to go through
your shit with a fine tooth comb.

1771
01:39:23,911 --> 01:39:28,530
They have all this data, but until you
get arrested, they're just, you know,

1772
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,420
oh yeah, yeah, totally. It's
the retroactive prosecution.

1773
01:39:31,421 --> 01:39:36,070
It's the ability to frame a case about
you going back in your history and doing

1774
01:39:36,071 --> 01:39:38,440
all the shit. Like you can pick
one black man set. Exactly.

1775
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:40,780
Implied blackmail is what it is.
It's like,

1776
01:39:41,090 --> 01:39:43,480
it keeps you on the up and up.

1777
01:39:43,481 --> 01:39:46,540
It keeps you from challenging
authority because if you do,

1778
01:39:46,541 --> 01:39:50,650
they know a lot of shit about you. Abby
Martin. I guess my point is that if you,

1779
01:39:50,710 --> 01:39:53,770
if we wanted to stop the opium trade,
it wouldn't be that hard.

1780
01:39:55,300 --> 01:40:00,130
Yeah. Probably wouldn't
be as hard. Yeah. Um,

1781
01:40:00,131 --> 01:40:03,040
but yeah, no, dude, when people
know that they're being watched,

1782
01:40:03,041 --> 01:40:05,710
we were talking about, you know, the
generation, the Internet generation,

1783
01:40:05,711 --> 01:40:09,940
the problem is that there's no semblance
of privacy with the generation growing

1784
01:40:09,941 --> 01:40:13,210
up next. Um, that's all gone.

1785
01:40:13,211 --> 01:40:15,130
And people react differently.

1786
01:40:15,131 --> 01:40:18,430
They act differently when they know that
there's a camera on them when I know

1787
01:40:18,431 --> 01:40:19,510
that they're being recorded.

1788
01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:23,050
And what does that going to do
for just independent thought?

1789
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:25,120
And I just hope that we can. Um, I just,

1790
01:40:25,121 --> 01:40:27,070
I don't know what the fuck's
going to happen, man. It's just,

1791
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:31,780
it's getting really crazy. Um, the
surveillance state is just really,

1792
01:40:31,781 --> 01:40:32,680
really out of control.

1793
01:40:32,990 --> 01:40:33,141
Well,

1794
01:40:33,141 --> 01:40:38,141
the only thing that's fascinating to
me is that it's starting to eat itself.

1795
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:39,170
Yeah.

1796
01:40:39,170 --> 01:40:44,170
It's like it just came out
recently that the NSA was,

1797
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:49,310
they were sort of using surveillance on
the Senate. Yeah. So it's like, yeah,

1798
01:40:49,311 --> 01:40:52,970
it's like you're there, they're
eating themselves like, and then the

1799
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:55,890
was being investigate those,

1800
01:40:55,910 --> 01:41:00,910
investigating the CIA and that's how
they found the head of CIA was having an

1801
01:41:01,151 --> 01:41:04,630
affair is because they were,
they were all investigating each other.

1802
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:07,090
It's like they're eating
themselves. Like they, they've,

1803
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:09,010
they've gone to cannibalism.
This,

1804
01:41:09,011 --> 01:41:13,060
one of the things that many people are
not aware is that a lot of government

1805
01:41:13,061 --> 01:41:16,750
agencies don't like the other government
agencies write, write, write, write,

1806
01:41:16,751 --> 01:41:20,740
hilarious. You assholes. It's
supposed to be on team America.

1807
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:24,190
And the fucking FBI and the CIA
have issues with each other.

1808
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:28,330
They don't share information. They go
back and figure it fucking real problems.

1809
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:32,890
You know, I, I think that ultimately the,

1810
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:35,730
the evil and the,
the,

1811
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:40,770
the sort of creepy behavior
that's involved in the
surveillance state will prove

1812
01:41:40,841 --> 01:41:45,280
to be its own undoing because
they're gonna investigate each other.

1813
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:48,580
They're going to expose
each other's issues. They're
going to, you know, they're,

1814
01:41:48,581 --> 01:41:52,790
they're attacking each other. Like
there's this whole thing, I mean, the,

1815
01:41:52,830 --> 01:41:54,580
the fucking head of the CIA,

1816
01:41:55,150 --> 01:42:00,150
the number one spook in the country gets
investigated by the FBI and he loses

1817
01:42:01,421 --> 01:42:05,140
his gig because it turns out that
he's having an affair. I mean,

1818
01:42:05,141 --> 01:42:08,470
if that doesn't show you
how crazy this is and that,

1819
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:11,760
that guy betray us who lost
his Gig was, you know, I mean,

1820
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:14,140
your member during the Iraq war,
he was like,

1821
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:17,980
he was like Jesus of the battlefield. He
was like the guy that everybody went to,

1822
01:42:17,981 --> 01:42:19,180
he was the,
he had an affair,

1823
01:42:19,181 --> 01:42:22,030
can take you down and not like
war Alaris with the crate.

1824
01:42:22,031 --> 01:42:23,770
Some crazy bitch who was
banging a lot of dudes.

1825
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:27,430
She was like into fucking
high level military guys know.

1826
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:28,330
And they were just her thing.

1827
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:32,110
They were kind of like weird swingers'
when it comes to, you know, hired killers.

1828
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,170
Very strange. It's very strange. Yeah.

1829
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:39,400
That other leak about GCHQ which is
like the NSA counterpart in Britain,

1830
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,020
they actually,

1831
01:42:41,170 --> 01:42:45,700
it came out that they're manipulating
poles and online traffic and essentially

1832
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:48,250
like, you know the whole like whoever
controls the past controls the president.

1833
01:42:48,251 --> 01:42:50,710
Well these people mother fuckers are
controlling the present and the future

1834
01:42:50,711 --> 01:42:52,630
because if you're manipulating polls,

1835
01:42:53,170 --> 01:42:56,190
that right there can change the course
of like the political evolution of the

1836
01:42:56,191 --> 01:42:59,710
country. If you're like, oh well
90% of UK citizens agree with this,

1837
01:42:59,711 --> 01:43:01,540
what are you going to like say no?

1838
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:03,250
And it's like you're just
fucking making this shit up.

1839
01:43:03,330 --> 01:43:06,400
Like you could just make
it up now button again.

1840
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:10,330
Then that the information comes out that
that's what's going on and it makes it

1841
01:43:10,331 --> 01:43:14,890
sort of invalid. Like anybody gone, man,
I can't, I think kind of in a way it does,

1842
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:19,510
you know, it's like look like the
more the information comes out,

1843
01:43:19,511 --> 01:43:21,400
the more the information gets
in the hands of the people,

1844
01:43:21,401 --> 01:43:23,830
the more that information becomes invalid.

1845
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:27,340
I mean it's it or at least it becomes
a weapon that's used against him.

1846
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,670
Like the betray situation,

1847
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:34,680
like Patraeus is like he was teaching
at City College of New York and as he's

1848
01:43:35,471 --> 01:43:39,160
walking he has to walk and you're see it
any other war criminal and kids follow

1849
01:43:39,161 --> 01:43:43,270
him and scream war criminal at them
and you're like, whoa, this is crazy.

1850
01:43:43,271 --> 01:43:46,510
These guys didn't have any protection.
Like they jettisoned him.

1851
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:50,620
They took this guy who was
like the head killer, right?

1852
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:52,160
He's the head military guy.

1853
01:43:52,161 --> 01:43:56,630
The top dude who apparently like he
would take credit for stuff that other

1854
01:43:56,631 --> 01:43:59,030
people really deserve credit for.
There was a lot of dissent.

1855
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:03,440
There's a a lot of what real
issue in the military community,

1856
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:05,210
they had issues with this
guy. I don't, you know,

1857
01:44:05,211 --> 01:44:06,680
I don't know how much
of this is true or not,

1858
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:11,920
but watching him walk down the street
while these kids are yelling war criminal,

1859
01:44:12,151 --> 01:44:14,690
they're holding up these signs and
they're saying, we'll be back tomorrow.

1860
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:18,250
We'll be back every day you're teaching
and it's like, this is crazy. Who,

1861
01:44:18,251 --> 01:44:21,990
who fucking expected this? And he
can't do it. Let's see if we get pull,

1862
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:24,570
pull that video because you'll find it.
It's fascinating.

1863
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:28,430
It's fascinating because it's
like who would have ever expected,

1864
01:44:28,431 --> 01:44:32,840
how would he have ever expected that
a chick he was banging led to this?

1865
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:36,820
What a weird world we live in.
Well,

1866
01:44:36,821 --> 01:44:40,580
you could be the head of a military
machine that's responsible for,

1867
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:42,200
what was the w?

1868
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:47,160
It's between x hundred thousand and a
million innocence died in Iraq right now.

1869
01:44:47,190 --> 01:44:51,770
Over a million 2007 pole. That
was a million back then. Yeah,

1870
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:55,820
and I can't even imagine thinking
of a pile of a million bodies.

1871
01:44:56,090 --> 01:45:00,440
Good luck trying to wrap your head around
that, but watching this guy, here it is.

1872
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:01,383
It's fun

1873
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,273
walking

1874
01:45:21,430 --> 01:45:22,510
blood all over you.

1875
01:45:53,530 --> 01:45:56,470
That is really crazy.

1876
01:45:56,471 --> 01:45:58,570
Then we just probably
thought he could slink off.

1877
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:18,100
They don't touch him now, his face,
but they never get in front of them.

1878
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:23,040
They don't stop him.

1879
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:29,880
Wow. He just keeps walking just
like, well, what's so weird, John,

1880
01:46:29,881 --> 01:46:33,870
you the guy who basically codified
torture is still working at Berkeley.

1881
01:46:33,871 --> 01:46:37,660
He's just still teacher. They're like,
I don't, it's fucking crazy. John, you,

1882
01:46:37,661 --> 01:46:41,820
he's the guy who actually wrote like
the torture justification in the bush,

1883
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:47,070
like torture memos. Like he actually wrote
the Law to actually legalize torture,

1884
01:46:47,370 --> 01:46:50,010
not legalize it,
but codified it so that

1885
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:52,470
it was essentially illegal.
Yeah.

1886
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:55,140
And he's a fucking criminal man
and he's just working at Berkeley.

1887
01:46:55,680 --> 01:47:00,020
I love when people do that though. I mean,
Kissinger, what kills me is that the,

1888
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:04,830
like the, the oldest motherfuckers like
Kissinger and Bush senior, it's like how,

1889
01:47:04,831 --> 01:47:06,420
and Chaney, it's like, God damn,

1890
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:10,230
you guys have had all the luck that you
can go skydiving when you're like 99

1891
01:47:10,231 --> 01:47:12,920
years old and you're like a workman
like Bush senior. And it's like, well,

1892
01:47:12,921 --> 01:47:15,300
how are you? How are you? So lucky.

1893
01:47:15,860 --> 01:47:20,440
Oh God,
22 times more oxycodone.

1894
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:24,470
Wow. Are prescribed in Florida
than anywhere else in the country.

1895
01:47:27,070 --> 01:47:30,340
And these pain centers are just still
operating. Like they're still operating,

1896
01:47:30,341 --> 01:47:31,750
but they've cut them back and this is,

1897
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,450
gets really crazy. The, these poor
people that were hooked on this shit,

1898
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:41,370
now they have to go illegal
because there's no options. It's,

1899
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,940
it's become a serious issue for,

1900
01:47:43,941 --> 01:47:48,780
for people that live in Florida because
you essentially have like all these

1901
01:47:48,781 --> 01:47:51,840
people that are hooked and they're,

1902
01:47:51,841 --> 01:47:55,290
they're kind of collateral
damage. You know, this, this,

1903
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:58,320
this like oxycontin express comes out,

1904
01:47:58,350 --> 01:48:02,790
everybody finds out about this issue and
the pharmaceutical companies are just

1905
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:04,380
raking it in,

1906
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:09,430
raking it in and they've made a
bunch of people addicted. They've,

1907
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:13,320
they've create all these addicts by
giving them this access is insane. Access.

1908
01:48:13,321 --> 01:48:14,820
Like go, what's wrong
with you? My back hurts.

1909
01:48:14,821 --> 01:48:17,630
Here's a prescription growing in store
and they go right next door and they give

1910
01:48:17,631 --> 01:48:21,540
him pills and the the hardest pills
to kick on the planet. I mean,

1911
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,130
within a couple of days,

1912
01:48:23,131 --> 01:48:26,490
these fucking things are deep in your
bones and you're fucked. I have a,

1913
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:30,960
I have a relative fucking
guy, just lost everything. He,

1914
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:33,180
he became a junkie.
I watched,

1915
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:37,650
I watched him have a regular job and then
just become a lying piece of shit that

1916
01:48:37,651 --> 01:48:39,510
never works and just always on pills.

1917
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:44,040
It's fucking legal heroin. That's
exactly what it is. It's, it's,

1918
01:48:44,270 --> 01:48:46,390
it's even crazier.
It's more concentrated.

1919
01:48:48,050 --> 01:48:52,320
Swallow. You don't have to shoot up. You
don't have to fucking get a, uh, a rope.

1920
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:53,460
You don't have to get a needle.

1921
01:48:53,461 --> 01:48:56,070
You don't have to stick a needle
in your arm and find a vein.

1922
01:48:56,071 --> 01:48:59,910
You don't have to do any of that.
Just pop a pill, boom, suck on it.

1923
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:04,200
And then you need it.

1924
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:08,370
Unbelievable that we are living in a
country where we just still a class one

1925
01:49:08,371 --> 01:49:12,330
drug schedule one, sorry. Is it
just in the United States? Um,

1926
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:17,430
response, the New York
Times wrote a, yeah, the,

1927
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:21,700
the government had a response and
the government's response is fucking,

1928
01:49:21,990 --> 01:49:26,460
hi. It's so stupid. I'm
looking for it. Right.

1929
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:29,860
Uh, Dave semen pulled it up. Uh,

1930
01:49:30,070 --> 01:49:34,930
if you look on my Twitter from
July 31st I retweeted it, but it's,

1931
01:49:34,931 --> 01:49:35,170
uh,

1932
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:40,170
the response is so God damn
goofy marijuana use affects
the developing brain.

1933
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:43,240
Okay, here's the problem. All right.

1934
01:49:43,330 --> 01:49:48,250
Their arguments are all about
children. Well, they're about marijuana

1935
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:49,660
use amongst adults.

1936
01:49:50,010 --> 01:49:53,110
It had no bearing and the
conversation doesn't make any sense.

1937
01:49:53,111 --> 01:49:57,280
It's completely irrelevant. But their
first two points are about children.

1938
01:49:57,430 --> 01:50:02,290
Marijuana use affects the developing
brain substance use in school age children

1939
01:50:02,291 --> 01:50:05,590
has, I'll touch on mental effect on
their academic achievement. Yeah.

1940
01:50:05,591 --> 01:50:09,070
You wonder why. First of all, it's
substance use, which includes alcohol,

1941
01:50:09,071 --> 01:50:13,360
which is legal and includes oxycodones
which are legal include includes a lot of

1942
01:50:13,361 --> 01:50:17,920
shit where illegal. Yeah, a
lot. A lot of things. Acute.
Yeah. Students who received,

1943
01:50:17,950 --> 01:50:19,990
and this is on the fucking
federal government's website,

1944
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:25,050
students who received earned D's or F's
were more likely to be current users off

1945
01:50:26,651 --> 01:50:31,210
a marijuana than those who earned a raise.
Yeah,

1946
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:35,280
okay. Whatever those
they're, they're high and

1947
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:38,060
right, right. What are
you trying to say hi?

1948
01:50:38,070 --> 01:50:39,740
Because they're not paying
attention and none of that

1949
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:42,940
school for the most part sucks a fat
deck and it's probably one of the reasons

1950
01:50:42,941 --> 01:50:45,130
why their highest fucking
not paying attention. School,

1951
01:50:45,170 --> 01:50:49,870
you're trying to stick around kid into a
square hole and most kids don't like it.

1952
01:50:50,230 --> 01:50:53,170
And most kids that are creative,
anybody that thinks outside the box,

1953
01:50:53,171 --> 01:50:58,171
anybody that has any sort of aspirations
in any sort of alternative career

1954
01:50:58,571 --> 01:51:03,130
outside of the academic process of, you
know, getting a degree, getting a job,

1955
01:51:03,131 --> 01:51:07,180
getting a cubicle, following
this very rigid pattern. Yeah.

1956
01:51:07,181 --> 01:51:08,440
The people have a problem with it.

1957
01:51:08,441 --> 01:51:11,680
People have a problem with people telling
them what to do and they get D's or

1958
01:51:11,681 --> 01:51:15,130
F's. They, yeah, they're more likely to
be the kind of kids that'll get high.

1959
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:18,430
That's why Finland has the best fucking
education system in the world because

1960
01:51:18,431 --> 01:51:22,510
they have like very personalized
education because they know everyone isn't

1961
01:51:22,511 --> 01:51:26,170
uniform. Robots that fit
into a perfect little thing,

1962
01:51:26,270 --> 01:51:28,690
perfect package that everything's
standardized and this and that.

1963
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:31,660
And when we're talking about like the,
the vapid nature of,

1964
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:36,370
of people who like take all these fucking
drugs to try to fill this void or eat

1965
01:51:36,371 --> 01:51:40,270
upholstery and tape and shit
and glue. I mean, you know,

1966
01:51:40,271 --> 01:51:44,740
when you're living in a culture that
tells you that working is the best,

1967
01:51:44,741 --> 01:51:48,160
like if you work hard, you
can get anything that you
want. And that's not just,

1968
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:49,930
that's just fucking not true anymore,
man.

1969
01:51:49,931 --> 01:51:51,910
The American dream isn't
available for everyone.

1970
01:51:51,911 --> 01:51:55,360
It would never really was and
it just not possible anymore.

1971
01:51:55,361 --> 01:51:58,600
And I think people just still want to
hold on to this dying fucking dream.

1972
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:01,630
And we work harder than almost every
other fucking industrialized nation.

1973
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:04,150
We're the only country,

1974
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:08,530
literally North Korea and Saudi Arabia
both offer this and we don't paid

1975
01:52:08,531 --> 01:52:12,280
maternity leave. We don't even offer
paid maternity leave. So what the fuck?

1976
01:52:12,281 --> 01:52:14,140
I mean, it just nuts. It's like,

1977
01:52:14,141 --> 01:52:18,130
I think that we just put work above all
else and we're just working ourselves to

1978
01:52:18,131 --> 01:52:20,920
death. And it's really not
what life is all about.

1979
01:52:20,921 --> 01:52:25,030
Like even if you wanted to work and get
money and really what are the chances of

1980
01:52:25,031 --> 01:52:29,110
you getting into your dream job where
it doesn't feel like you're working? Um,

1981
01:52:29,111 --> 01:52:33,580
so ultimately you're going to be fucking
miserable working your ass off just to

1982
01:52:33,581 --> 01:52:36,640
get the money sitting in traffic,
fucking coming home.

1983
01:52:36,641 --> 01:52:39,940
You can't even have time to fuck your
wife or like make dinner and you just,

1984
01:52:39,941 --> 01:52:43,480
it just like this horrible cycle of course
that they're going to be used. Shit,

1985
01:52:43,810 --> 01:52:47,060
of course you're going to abuse drugs
like there's no purpose because the

1986
01:52:47,061 --> 01:52:51,590
purpose that you've put as your God is
money and as much as we all love to buy

1987
01:52:51,591 --> 01:52:52,970
shit,
like at the end of the day,

1988
01:52:52,971 --> 01:52:56,330
that's not going to fill the void of what
the meaning of life is and why you're

1989
01:52:56,331 --> 01:52:58,060
here.
That's the real issue with

1990
01:52:58,090 --> 01:52:59,490
materialism as well.

1991
01:52:59,491 --> 01:53:03,250
There's a lot of times people resort
to materialism to sort of placate

1992
01:53:03,251 --> 01:53:06,940
themselves because they're so miserable
with their job that they're at least I'm

1993
01:53:06,941 --> 01:53:09,460
going to get a reward. I'm going
to buy that fucking Lexus. They're,

1994
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:12,600
they're at least going to get themselves
a nice watch through at least going to

1995
01:53:12,610 --> 01:53:14,300
get themselves a big TV.
They're going to,

1996
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:18,160
it's asking them to be at least make
me feel better for this fucking creepy

1997
01:53:18,161 --> 01:53:23,161
existence that I've sort of locked myself
into that I get to do till I'm 65 and

1998
01:53:23,411 --> 01:53:27,970
then what? Then what? Then fucking
watch my knees. Give out, watch my back,

1999
01:53:27,971 --> 01:53:31,870
give out, watch my body decay.
What are the options? I don't know.

2000
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:36,400
I would say to anybody that's
listening to this that's confused.

2001
01:53:36,430 --> 01:53:39,700
If there's another thing
that you want to do,

2002
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,400
please at least tried to do it.

2003
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:46,300
Find a way other people have,
you know this,

2004
01:53:46,301 --> 01:53:50,470
this idea that you should worked
for a company in some thankless,

2005
01:53:51,010 --> 01:53:54,970
loveless position and just keep
doing it until the wheels fall off.

2006
01:53:55,390 --> 01:53:57,820
Don't have kids until you have to.
Okay,

2007
01:53:58,180 --> 01:54:00,550
don't fucking get a
mortgage until you have to.

2008
01:54:00,730 --> 01:54:03,790
Don't do it and we just don't do
it. When you're young, don't do it.

2009
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:08,140
Don't lock yourself in to needing a
certain amount of money every month.

2010
01:54:08,170 --> 01:54:11,560
Don't do it until it's
mandatory until it's necessary.

2011
01:54:12,030 --> 01:54:13,300
You could find other paths.

2012
01:54:13,301 --> 01:54:16,120
People can find other paths being
you're not going to find it.

2013
01:54:16,121 --> 01:54:17,770
Paying attention to the fucking news.

2014
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:20,560
You're not going to find a paying
attention to most school teachers.

2015
01:54:20,770 --> 01:54:21,610
You're not going to find it.

2016
01:54:21,611 --> 01:54:26,611
Paying attention to most of the standards
that people hear applied to human

2017
01:54:27,611 --> 01:54:28,444
beings.

2018
01:54:29,310 --> 01:54:32,580
That's why DC is so fucking weird because
you're, that's where you live, right?

2019
01:54:32,581 --> 01:54:35,250
Yeah. It's fucking creepy
man. The belly of the beast.

2020
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:37,410
I'm getting out of there soon.
I told my boss, I was like,

2021
01:54:37,411 --> 01:54:41,870
there's no way I can be here for another
year. I don't know. Big Sur, big Sur,

2022
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:43,140
go live in a cave,

2023
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:47,310
no cell phone reception to the Care Act
Shit and just fucking move out there

2024
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:51,360
isn't it? I'm serious dude. After like
I'm going to take a long break but,

2025
01:54:51,990 --> 01:54:54,060
but DC is so weird because everyone there,

2026
01:54:54,061 --> 01:54:55,530
it's just like Hollywood for ugly people.

2027
01:54:55,531 --> 01:54:57,570
You've heard that same but it's
fucking true because everyone,

2028
01:54:57,571 --> 01:55:01,950
there's a Predator and everyone there,
they look like a pudgy faced. Karl Rove,

2029
01:55:01,951 --> 01:55:06,360
baby faced will like doughboy and they're
all like these white dudes wearing

2030
01:55:06,510 --> 01:55:10,350
plaid and all they're doing is just
trying to find out how they can fuck you

2031
01:55:10,351 --> 01:55:13,590
over to try to get like, you
know, use you to do this.

2032
01:55:13,590 --> 01:55:17,460
And it just a super creepy predatory
place and it's full of a lot of soul as

2033
01:55:17,461 --> 01:55:21,000
people and they're all like,
they've all navigated their,

2034
01:55:21,001 --> 01:55:26,001
because they feel like they can streamline
their careers and just fucking over

2035
01:55:26,191 --> 01:55:27,001
humanity essentially.

2036
01:55:27,001 --> 01:55:30,810
I mean I know that they're obviously
going there more altruistic goals but it

2037
01:55:30,811 --> 01:55:33,600
just sad that they are bred to say like,
you know this,

2038
01:55:33,601 --> 01:55:37,440
this is all that matters is money and
power essentially in power just corrupts

2039
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:40,740
the shit out of people and they
just lose sight of so much.

2040
01:55:40,741 --> 01:55:45,741
Like once you're in that bubble you
really see outside of it and it just all

2041
01:55:45,751 --> 01:55:49,500
this like minuscule shit that you think
that you're changing stuff and really

2042
01:55:49,501 --> 01:55:52,200
like in the grand scheme of things
you're just kind of perpetuating the same

2043
01:55:52,201 --> 01:55:55,680
system and I just think it's
bad. I just feel like I'm, yeah,

2044
01:55:55,681 --> 01:55:58,110
there's not really too many
radical voices out there.

2045
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:02,100
I have learned a lot more about like the
incompetence of government now that I'm

2046
01:56:02,101 --> 01:56:05,400
living there though I feel like I've
changed my mind about some things because

2047
01:56:05,401 --> 01:56:09,420
I've seen how fucking stupid everyone
is and how like much in a bubble people

2048
01:56:09,421 --> 01:56:12,130
are. I'm like, okay, I at least I
understand why things are the way

2049
01:56:12,430 --> 01:56:15,860
you mean as far as like the ideas of
conspiracy theories as opposed to just

2050
01:56:15,861 --> 01:56:17,060
total income.
Yeah,

2051
01:56:17,061 --> 01:56:20,720
I feel the same way as more of paid
attention to more things and more. I go,

2052
01:56:20,721 --> 01:56:25,580
listen man, there are conspiracies
for sure. They have always existed.

2053
01:56:25,581 --> 01:56:30,170
They probably will until we have total
transparency as far as people's thoughts

2054
01:56:30,171 --> 01:56:32,540
and actions, which may be come
a lot sooner than we think,

2055
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:35,240
but more likely than not,

2056
01:56:35,690 --> 01:56:39,320
there's this terrible and competence
and then there's people that are

2057
01:56:39,321 --> 01:56:43,790
capitalizing on events. Exactly.
Because people capitalize on events.

2058
01:56:43,791 --> 01:56:47,120
A lot of times people say, you got to
look who benefited from this happening.

2059
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:52,520
Actually no, because anytime any tragic
event happens, people benefit from it.

2060
01:56:52,700 --> 01:56:56,900
So it doesn't mean they cause said tragic
event and that's where a lot of these

2061
01:56:56,901 --> 01:56:57,860
conspiracy theorists,

2062
01:56:57,861 --> 01:57:02,861
they make this really egregious error
in judgment because it's not that the

2063
01:57:03,170 --> 01:57:06,770
cause of the event and that's why they're
benefiting because they planned it out,

2064
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:11,030
right? It's usually that shit
is just fucked from the get go.

2065
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:13,160
Like nine 11 is a perfect example.

2066
01:57:13,170 --> 01:57:17,090
So many people have benefited from nine
11 and there's a lot of people that try

2067
01:57:17,091 --> 01:57:20,510
to directly correlate those people that
have benefited from nine 11 with having

2068
01:57:20,511 --> 01:57:24,560
planned out nine 11 with very
little evidence. But there's,

2069
01:57:24,710 --> 01:57:26,990
there's an old saying,
I forgot how it goes exactly,

2070
01:57:26,991 --> 01:57:29,730
but to paraphrase it is like the uh,

2071
01:57:29,870 --> 01:57:34,870
there's any tragedy that
is not capitalized on is he
is a waste and that this is

2072
01:57:36,471 --> 01:57:40,220
like a staple of governments that they,
they look at any,

2073
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:45,290
any situation where things go wrong.
Like Oklahoma City. Perfect example.

2074
01:57:45,291 --> 01:57:47,480
When they blew up the federal building,
whoever did it,

2075
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:51,440
whether it's Timothy Mcveigh,
whether it was a fucking Illuminati,

2076
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:53,240
whoever blew up that building,

2077
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:58,070
one of the things that happened was they
started changing the laws on, on the,

2078
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:01,070
the ability to act against terrorism,
homegrown terrorism.

2079
01:58:01,071 --> 01:58:05,420
They used to use the term light.
What does it not light skinned terrorism.

2080
01:58:05,421 --> 01:58:10,290
There was a clean skinned, I forget what
the term that they started using. Yeah.

2081
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:15,170
The idea of looking for a terrorist that
you know as like a white man sort of

2082
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:16,090
looking for an arrow.

2083
01:58:16,210 --> 01:58:17,980
Oh the homegrown. Yeah. Yeah. Home grown.

2084
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:19,360
But it was like the,
the,

2085
01:58:19,361 --> 01:58:22,600
I think the term is like literally clean
skin terrorist or something like that.

2086
01:58:22,601 --> 01:58:24,130
But they changed the law.

2087
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:27,640
They changed the laws directly
because of the Oklahoma City bombings.

2088
01:58:27,790 --> 01:58:31,540
Um, I, well after the, after I like
got propelled in the mainstream,

2089
01:58:31,541 --> 01:58:34,810
they resurrected all the shit that I had
done about nine 11 cause I used to be

2090
01:58:34,811 --> 01:58:38,050
in the nine 11 truth movement and
they were like, you're fucking crazy.

2091
01:58:38,051 --> 01:58:41,530
Here you are on video. Six years ago
saying it was an inside job, this shit.

2092
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:42,161
And I was like,
look,

2093
01:58:42,161 --> 01:58:45,820
I don't think it was an inside job as
a journalist that would be extremely

2094
01:58:45,821 --> 01:58:48,130
irresponsible to claim
that, you know, anything.

2095
01:58:48,430 --> 01:58:52,300
All I can do is point out things that I
feel are wrong with the official story.

2096
01:58:52,301 --> 01:58:54,760
I feel like there's a lot of things that
are wrong with what we've been told.

2097
01:58:54,761 --> 01:58:56,170
Does that mean that we know what happened?

2098
01:58:56,171 --> 01:58:58,850
We can go out there and declare it now.
Um,

2099
01:58:58,930 --> 01:59:02,740
and really at this point all we can do
is point out the people that benefited

2100
01:59:02,741 --> 01:59:05,080
the people that exploited it.
Um,

2101
01:59:05,290 --> 01:59:09,190
because it's just the fact
that you're just, you know,

2102
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:11,260
you're just called a conspiracy.
There's,

2103
01:59:11,261 --> 01:59:14,260
it's this catch all phrase that you
can just use to shut down debate.

2104
01:59:14,261 --> 01:59:16,090
But I still have some
questions about nine 11.

2105
01:59:16,091 --> 01:59:18,610
I have a lot of questions about nine 11,
but I don't,

2106
01:59:18,910 --> 01:59:20,980
I don't go out there and
say it was an inside job.

2107
01:59:21,010 --> 01:59:22,500
But what specifically
do you have questions?

2108
01:59:22,501 --> 01:59:24,520
But I have questions
about the insider trading.

2109
01:59:24,610 --> 01:59:28,750
The fact that there were dozens and
dozens of warnings beyond just the initial

2110
01:59:28,751 --> 01:59:30,430
PDB given to Condoleezza Rice,

2111
01:59:30,431 --> 01:59:33,370
St bin Laden Determined to strike within
the u s there's like dozens and dozens

2112
01:59:33,371 --> 01:59:36,760
more directly to the top of the
intelligence. And the fact that they,

2113
01:59:37,870 --> 01:59:39,700
I don't blame that just on incompetence.

2114
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:43,630
I think that someone turned a blind
eye at the very least and that respect.

2115
01:59:43,631 --> 01:59:47,260
And then we know that people bet that
the stocks would fail and they fucking

2116
01:59:47,261 --> 01:59:49,330
made a shit load of money on it.
Who were those people?

2117
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:53,570
They never investigated it. So there's
just certain things like that that,

2118
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:56,380
that make me, me raise
eyebrows, but you know,

2119
01:59:56,381 --> 01:59:59,860
do I go out and say building
seven and shit like no,

2120
01:59:59,861 --> 02:00:03,220
because I just think at this point all
we can do is point to the questions that

2121
02:00:03,221 --> 02:00:06,470
we have and point to how they've
used the event. But I think that in,

2122
02:00:06,530 --> 02:00:08,440
in terms of all these
school shootings and shit,

2123
02:00:08,441 --> 02:00:11,530
the problem with this movement
is that it started off,

2124
02:00:11,531 --> 02:00:13,960
I was drawn to it because I'm like I,
you know,

2125
02:00:13,990 --> 02:00:17,710
I like to question the narratives that
I'm given because I think that they lie

2126
02:00:17,711 --> 02:00:19,870
about a lot of shit and rewrite history,

2127
02:00:19,871 --> 02:00:23,290
but then it's turned into this kind of
conspiracy culture where there's like a

2128
02:00:23,291 --> 02:00:25,000
conspiracy like fucking ink.

2129
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:29,680
It's like making money off everything
and you're capitalizing on if everyone

2130
02:00:29,681 --> 02:00:31,900
thinks everyone wants to be
this celebrity on Youtube,

2131
02:00:31,901 --> 02:00:35,050
making these fucking paranoid videos
about the Illuminati and every school

2132
02:00:35,051 --> 02:00:38,110
shootings controlled and a false
flag and I'm just like, this is just,

2133
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:42,310
that makes me just never want to touch
that shit again because I'm just like,

2134
02:00:42,311 --> 02:00:45,370
you guys have actually ruined
just asking questions like, yes,

2135
02:00:45,371 --> 02:00:46,360
we should all ask questions.

2136
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:49,960
But when you're just going out there with
an hours of every event saying it's a

2137
02:00:49,961 --> 02:00:50,794
false flag,

2138
02:00:51,370 --> 02:00:54,880
you're actually making people like
never wanting to question like the,

2139
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:57,220
the origin of these things
and that's dangerous,

2140
02:00:57,620 --> 02:01:00,530
which is disinformation as agent's job.
Absolutely.

2141
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:06,500
Information agent is someone who connects
some really credible ideas with some

2142
02:01:07,061 --> 02:01:12,061
wacky alien on the moon
fucking conspiracies that
are so ridiculous that it

2143
02:01:12,281 --> 02:01:16,090
makes the other stuff that it's
connected to seem ridiculous. Exactly.

2144
02:01:16,091 --> 02:01:20,390
Have you ever read the, the
debunking of all that, um,

2145
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:24,160
the insider trading stuff? It's pretty
interesting. Now, what is the debunking?

2146
02:01:24,190 --> 02:01:29,020
Well, you can even go to Snopes. Snopes
has it. Um, here, I'll read it. Uh,

2147
02:01:29,050 --> 02:01:33,620
in the days just prior to the
of September 11th, um, uh, uh,

2148
02:01:33,650 --> 02:01:38,140
attacks large quantities of stock and
United and American Airlines were traded

2149
02:01:38,141 --> 02:01:41,630
by persons with knowledge of the
upcoming nine 11 attacks. Right?

2150
02:01:41,631 --> 02:01:44,870
That's what everybody parrots false.
Uh,

2151
02:01:44,871 --> 02:01:47,930
origins on 11 September,

2152
02:01:47,930 --> 02:01:51,260
2001 for planes are hijacked and
used in the attack on America.

2153
02:01:51,261 --> 02:01:55,430
American Airlines flight 11,
leaving Boston bound for Los
Angeles, blah, blah, blah,

2154
02:01:55,431 --> 02:01:58,430
blah, blah, blah, blah. Leaving
Newark bound for San Francisco.

2155
02:01:58,610 --> 02:02:02,580
Each of these planes was deliberately
class a crashed killing all on board too.

2156
02:02:02,581 --> 02:02:06,700
And to the World Trade Center towers,
one to the Pentagon. The operation, uh,

2157
02:02:06,770 --> 02:02:09,860
taken years to plan.
The perpetrators knew well in advance.

2158
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:14,710
In the month prior to 11 September,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2159
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:15,913
Um,

2160
02:02:16,460 --> 02:02:21,170
unusual trading activity involving
American United stock was noted by market

2161
02:02:21,171 --> 02:02:24,200
analysts who at the time had
no idea what to make of it.

2162
02:02:24,201 --> 02:02:29,090
Wildly unusual discrepancies to
put, uh, in the put and call ratio.

2163
02:02:29,091 --> 02:02:33,860
25 to a hundred times normal
were reportedly observed
in stock options of the

2164
02:02:33,861 --> 02:02:37,400
two airlines in one case,
Bloomberg Trade Book Economic, uh,

2165
02:02:37,401 --> 02:02:42,401
electronic trade trading system identified
option volume in ual apparent of

2166
02:02:42,991 --> 02:02:45,890
United Airlines on 16th of August,

2167
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:49,250
2001 that was 36 times higher than usual.
Um,

2168
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:53,810
but it was during the final few trading
days that the most unusual variances of

2169
02:02:53,811 --> 02:02:57,650
activity occurred.
Okay.

2170
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:01,730
Highly publicized allegations of
insider trading of advanced nine 11.

2171
02:03:01,731 --> 02:03:06,350
Generally rest on reports of unusual pre
nine 11 trading activities in companies

2172
02:03:06,351 --> 02:03:11,120
whose stock plummeted after the attacks.
Some unusual trading did in fact occur,

2173
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:16,130
but each such trade proved to have an
innocuous explanation. For example,

2174
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:21,170
the volume of put options instruments
that pay off only when a stock drops in

2175
02:03:21,171 --> 02:03:25,430
price surge in the parent company of
the United Airlines of September six and

2176
02:03:25,431 --> 02:03:30,431
American Airlines of September 10th
highly suspicious trading on its face yet

2177
02:03:30,921 --> 02:03:35,120
further investigation has revealed that
the trading had no connection with nine

2178
02:03:35,121 --> 02:03:40,121
11 and a single us based institutional
investor with no conceivable ties to Al

2179
02:03:40,790 --> 02:03:45,790
Qaeda purchased 95% of the ual puts on
September six as a part of a trading

2180
02:03:46,881 --> 02:03:51,881
strategy that also included buying
115,000 shares of American Airlines Up

2181
02:03:53,991 --> 02:03:57,140
September 10th similar.
Similarly,

2182
02:03:57,230 --> 02:04:02,090
much of the seemingly suspicious trading
in American on September 10th was

2183
02:04:02,091 --> 02:04:07,091
traced to a specific us base
options trading newsletter
facts to its subscribers

2184
02:04:08,691 --> 02:04:12,590
on Sunday, September 9th which
recommended these trades,

2185
02:04:12,980 --> 02:04:17,980
the SCC and FAA and FBI aided by other
agencies and the securities industry

2186
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:22,700
devoted enormous resources
to investigating this issue,

2187
02:04:22,701 --> 02:04:26,540
including securing the cooperation
of many foreign governments.

2188
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:31,370
These investigators have found that
the apparently suspicious because the

2189
02:04:31,940 --> 02:04:35,060
consistently proved innocuous.

2190
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:39,780
So what they're saying is that the same
company also bought a Shitload of shares.

2191
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:43,800
What, what sources this, I know it's on
snaps, but what's the actual citation?

2192
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:45,270
It's a good question.
Um,

2193
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:48,660
because I had just read the CBS report
cause someone was asking me about this

2194
02:04:48,661 --> 02:04:50,490
and I wanted to like
refresh my memory and,

2195
02:04:50,640 --> 02:04:55,120
and I mean people to this days claim
that they still don't know. And,

2196
02:04:55,121 --> 02:04:58,260
and even the nine 11 commission said that
they didn't investigate who made money

2197
02:04:58,261 --> 02:05:00,760
off the attack because it was a
little practical significance.

2198
02:05:00,761 --> 02:05:05,640
So if that's explained, that's great. That
still doesn't explain how rum, like how,

2199
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:09,480
you know, Rumsfeld and Ashcroft and
Willie Brown were told not to fly.

2200
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:12,210
Like who the fuck told him not to fly in?
Why weren't our lives is,

2201
02:05:12,211 --> 02:05:14,000
how do I know that they
said they were told,

2202
02:05:14,170 --> 02:05:18,840
I heard really brown on the radio show
saying I was told not to fly Rumsfeld and

2203
02:05:18,841 --> 02:05:21,600
Silverstein who worked in the building
and he had breakfast every morning.

2204
02:05:21,610 --> 02:05:24,840
He just didn't show up. I mean I just
think that people did have for knowledge,

2205
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:28,590
I absolutely do.
And also the whole funding operation.

2206
02:05:28,591 --> 02:05:33,450
We know that there was $100,000 wire
transferred to the lead hijacker from mock

2207
02:05:33,451 --> 02:05:36,360
mood on med, which was the head
of Pakistanian intelligence.

2208
02:05:37,050 --> 02:05:38,010
And why the fuck weren't,

2209
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:42,690
wasn't that followed up like he was
having breakfast with condo like with the

2210
02:05:42,690 --> 02:05:45,930
White House the week of nine 11 so it's
like there's just things that I just

2211
02:05:45,931 --> 02:05:50,160
don't fucking get and I just feel
like it was thrown under the rug.

2212
02:05:50,161 --> 02:05:53,370
And the fact that Saudi Arabia basically
financed this whole operation with

2213
02:05:53,371 --> 02:05:57,960
Pakistan and we flew out all of bin
Laden's family. That to me is just like,

2214
02:05:57,961 --> 02:06:00,780
what the fuck is that? So even if
you don't believe anything else,

2215
02:06:00,781 --> 02:06:01,800
if you have no other questions,

2216
02:06:01,801 --> 02:06:03,930
the fact that we are still
tight with Saudi Arabia,

2217
02:06:03,931 --> 02:06:08,190
funding them allies with them and they
essentially like knew about the attacks

2218
02:06:08,191 --> 02:06:12,090
and help to finance these hijackers
is insane to me. That's insane.

2219
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:16,090
Yeah. Well the war they is very weird
too. When you start, they did this,

2220
02:06:16,300 --> 02:06:20,460
they funded that work.
Who is they and who came from?

2221
02:06:20,590 --> 02:06:23,650
No, no, no. We know Bob Graham.

2222
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:27,040
Look at fucking Senator Bob Graham's been
screaming about this on the floor for

2223
02:06:27,041 --> 02:06:31,150
the last 10 years saying they actually
do know that they were financed by the

2224
02:06:31,151 --> 02:06:32,110
Saudi Arabian government,

2225
02:06:32,111 --> 02:06:35,380
that the Saudi Arabian government knew
and they'd tell him services knew about

2226
02:06:35,381 --> 02:06:39,100
these hijackers, where they
were. And it just unbelievable.

2227
02:06:39,330 --> 02:06:44,310
And is it possible that our allegiance
to Saudi Arabia financially is greater

2228
02:06:44,580 --> 02:06:49,160
than the the desire for
justice that yeah, we, we,

2229
02:06:49,161 --> 02:06:53,520
we make so much money from Saudi
Arabia oil. Yeah. And that,

2230
02:06:53,610 --> 02:06:56,520
that's obviously probably the same
reason why I've been loans family and was

2231
02:06:56,521 --> 02:06:59,490
shipped out of the country.
There's just so much money involved.

2232
02:06:59,590 --> 02:07:02,990
Well, I guess it just sickens me because
if it really was the biggest deal in the

2233
02:07:02,991 --> 02:07:07,510
world where they can implement a domestic
police state and kill a million Iraqis

2234
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:11,450
and continue out this giant war on terror
wire tapping the planet because of it,

2235
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:15,110
the fact that they didn't
want to investigate Saudi
Arabia because like the oil

2236
02:07:15,111 --> 02:07:18,200
money or whatever, the fuck trumps
the justice that says it all.

2237
02:07:18,410 --> 02:07:21,770
It does. It certainly does. It certainly
says that there's creepy shit going on.

2238
02:07:22,190 --> 02:07:24,950
And that this has been the
way it's always been. I mean,

2239
02:07:24,951 --> 02:07:27,560
this is the way they've always
done business. There is a massive,

2240
02:07:27,561 --> 02:07:29,540
massive amount of money in oil,
right?

2241
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:34,750
The oil money is so hard for
any of us to even we too,

2242
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:38,470
when you're especially start talking
about these, all the guard families,

2243
02:07:38,471 --> 02:07:41,380
these families that have
insane amounts of money,

2244
02:07:41,381 --> 02:07:45,070
like more like they're not publicly traded
companies. They're not, they're not. Uh,

2245
02:07:45,071 --> 02:07:48,580
they're not, they don't have to pay
taxes because they own countries.

2246
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:52,210
It's like the ideas that we have
of the richest men in the world,

2247
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:56,380
they're not really entirely
accurate because already
with Warren Buffet and Bill

2248
02:07:56,380 --> 02:07:57,340
Gates and what about these

2249
02:07:57,460 --> 02:08:00,750
prince king gave that
nobody knows about it. Okay.

2250
02:08:00,890 --> 02:08:04,850
Oil, they own massive
amounts of money. I mean,

2251
02:08:05,450 --> 02:08:10,430
the amount of money that these kings
have and these princes and sheikhs,

2252
02:08:10,730 --> 02:08:13,490
what is anybody ever will accurately got

2253
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:15,170
reading and how much money they have.

2254
02:08:15,171 --> 02:08:18,680
Everyone watched house of sod because it
gives a really good background on Saudi

2255
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:22,700
Arabia. But basically it's like a hundred
year old like regime because they just

2256
02:08:22,701 --> 02:08:25,430
discovered oil and they rise to this,
this status.

2257
02:08:25,431 --> 02:08:29,420
And if you just look at Saudi Arabia is
relationship with the u s like we said,

2258
02:08:29,421 --> 02:08:32,300
it tells you everything you need to know
because of the utter hypocrisy in terms

2259
02:08:32,301 --> 02:08:36,140
of human rights standards.
I mean Saudi Arabia is fucking disgusting.

2260
02:08:36,290 --> 02:08:40,280
Zero rights for women.
They used to execute gay people.

2261
02:08:40,281 --> 02:08:42,260
I think they just imprison
them for life now.

2262
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:46,400
So if we want to talk about Rachel's
gay law, that's fine as well. We should,

2263
02:08:46,430 --> 02:08:49,340
but for fuck's sake,
let's talk about Saudi Arabia as well.

2264
02:08:49,710 --> 02:08:51,790
What is up with Russia's
gay law though? What, what,

2265
02:08:51,791 --> 02:08:55,200
why are they so like
worried about gay people?

2266
02:08:55,350 --> 02:08:57,330
I think Russia, uh, you know,

2267
02:08:57,331 --> 02:09:01,080
we're talking about a country that Soviet
Union collapse what, like 30 years ago.

2268
02:09:01,081 --> 02:09:01,914
So they're just like,

2269
02:09:02,010 --> 02:09:05,160
I think they're going through a lot of
fucking weird transitions where they're

2270
02:09:05,460 --> 02:09:08,580
just kind of going through
this evolutionary process.

2271
02:09:08,581 --> 02:09:12,470
I'm not trying to defend them at all.
I think the gala is terrible. Um,

2272
02:09:12,540 --> 02:09:16,080
and they have a lot of horrible
crackdowns on press freedom as well. Um,

2273
02:09:16,110 --> 02:09:19,110
but I think it's just completely like
apples and oranges when you're looking at

2274
02:09:19,111 --> 02:09:21,930
Russia and you're like, how
come you aren't as fucking
free as us? It's like, well,

2275
02:09:21,931 --> 02:09:26,730
the Soviet Union collapsed 30 years ago.
Like they're weird place. Like, and yeah,

2276
02:09:26,731 --> 02:09:29,730
they're run by a bunch of oligarchs and
it's a lot of fucked up shit going on,

2277
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:35,120
but I just don't understand the totally
agregious demonization of Russia when at

2278
02:09:35,311 --> 02:09:39,090
the same time, you know, all these
partnerships are so much crazier.

2279
02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:44,320
We got to keep our mouth shut about
oil from pretty simple. It is,

2280
02:09:44,321 --> 02:09:47,530
it's very simple. Go pee
again. Ting, ting, ting,

2281
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:49,860
ting to slippery,
slimy.

2282
02:09:50,830 --> 02:09:53,770
And Abby Martin is the
bladder of a small boys fist.

2283
02:09:59,050 --> 02:10:02,860
Well, we've managed to piss off a lot of
groups today. I think we should be proud.

2284
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:07,690
Everybody hates us now. The
Saudi Arabians, the Jews,

2285
02:10:07,750 --> 02:10:12,160
probably the Palestinians. Dennis
Prager, uh, who else we can just,

2286
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:14,500
Hillary Clinton's probably mad at us.

2287
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:17,740
Everyone's going to go to portray us
is pissed. Yeah, they're all good.

2288
02:10:17,770 --> 02:10:22,180
We'll go to go down the list.
We live in weird times. Weird,

2289
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:25,930
weird time to do, um,
an internet show too,

2290
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:28,720
because you don't have a boss.
Like you could never do this.

2291
02:10:28,721 --> 02:10:31,720
You can never have this kind of a show
and put it on television because if you

2292
02:10:31,721 --> 02:10:34,940
did try to record it, someone would
come along and they would, you know,

2293
02:10:35,010 --> 02:10:40,010
they would chop this out or hack that
out and you can't talk shit about them or

2294
02:10:40,041 --> 02:10:44,360
this or it's not,
it's not the way it goes anymore.

2295
02:10:44,450 --> 02:10:47,510
We live in a weird world.
This world is changing too.

2296
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:51,650
It's getting weirder and weirder and I
wonder what it's going to be like 50 a

2297
02:10:51,651 --> 02:10:52,640
hundred years from now.

2298
02:10:53,030 --> 02:10:58,030
If you go back and I was looking at this
video of Chicago and it was a Chicago

2299
02:10:59,451 --> 02:11:02,630
at the turn of the 20th century,

2300
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:05,900
from the 19th century to the 20th century.
He's like the early,

2301
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:06,733
early days in Chicago.

2302
02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:11,120
And there's these people that are like
riding the horses down the street.

2303
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:14,420
And um, I don't remember when
the first cars came about.

2304
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:16,130
It was like the 18 hundreds right?

2305
02:11:16,131 --> 02:11:19,580
The late 18 hundreds they first had cars
so there was like a couple cars in the

2306
02:11:19,581 --> 02:11:22,880
streets in Chicago early
19 hundreds and this, uh,

2307
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,590
you look at this place and you like,
you see this like very quaint existence.

2308
02:11:27,591 --> 02:11:30,590
These people live to
these early 20th century.

2309
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:34,940
We're talking about the difference between
now and a hundred years from now as

2310
02:11:34,941 --> 02:11:38,300
opposed to a hundred years ago,
early 20th century Chicago,

2311
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:42,050
there was this video of these
people riding fucking horses,

2312
02:11:42,090 --> 02:11:46,400
horse drawn carriages and shit. It's
so weird. There was a couple cars,

2313
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:47,271
you know,

2314
02:11:47,271 --> 02:11:51,530
there were these weird goofy ass cars
go like five miles an hour run on steam

2315
02:11:51,531 --> 02:11:55,310
and shit. But the, the
difference between then and now,

2316
02:11:55,311 --> 02:11:56,600
it's just stunning.

2317
02:11:56,820 --> 02:11:59,760
That's why we don't need like DC,
like we don't need,

2318
02:11:59,761 --> 02:12:01,700
these representatives were
not on horseback anymore.

2319
02:12:01,710 --> 02:12:03,240
We don't have the fucking Pony Express.

2320
02:12:03,241 --> 02:12:07,200
Like we don't need these
weird representatives that
represent like 30,000 people

2321
02:12:07,201 --> 02:12:08,340
like going and voicing.

2322
02:12:08,341 --> 02:12:11,550
It's like the electoral college
is totally fucking irrelevant

2323
02:12:12,700 --> 02:12:15,220
bullshit. But do you think
that it should be? Like,

2324
02:12:15,490 --> 02:12:20,230
is it possible that when you see people
like Mitt Romney or you see people that

2325
02:12:20,231 --> 02:12:21,340
are Scientologists,

2326
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:25,720
that people could be too easily
manipulated and that somehow or another,

2327
02:12:25,721 --> 02:12:30,220
this has to be filtered through
representatives that understand the law,

2328
02:12:30,221 --> 02:12:33,520
but at least we know that
these representatives who
are going to cast the vote

2329
02:12:33,521 --> 02:12:37,540
for their constituents, these people
are educated, these people are moral.

2330
02:12:37,541 --> 02:12:41,890
These people are,
have high standards and high moral fabric.

2331
02:12:42,410 --> 02:12:45,970
It's gross. The idea is gross
because it's very elitist.

2332
02:12:46,210 --> 02:12:50,900
But would you like if you lived
in Utah, okay. And I love you too,

2333
02:12:50,901 --> 02:12:55,390
I just got back. Would you allow the
popular vote to decide a lot of things?

2334
02:12:55,391 --> 02:12:59,470
If you knew that there was a giant
percentage of people that were in a weird

2335
02:12:59,471 --> 02:13:02,980
cult that had some strange,
strange rules,

2336
02:13:03,590 --> 02:13:07,040
but look at it, the popular vote
was replaced Electoral College,

2337
02:13:07,041 --> 02:13:09,200
then New York and California,
which is full of,

2338
02:13:09,201 --> 02:13:11,960
I think a lot more intelligent people,
um,

2339
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:15,320
would have much more of a poll and you
just don't even see politicians giving a

2340
02:13:15,321 --> 02:13:17,810
fuck about those states because
it all comes back to the like,

2341
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:20,690
they know that it's going to go
this way or that way and it's just,

2342
02:13:20,691 --> 02:13:23,250
it's disgusting.
But fly

2343
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:26,380
over states are gigantic,
right? 300 million people,

2344
02:13:26,381 --> 02:13:30,310
three 50 whenever it is in the country.
How many of them are New York, Chicago,

2345
02:13:30,311 --> 02:13:32,250
San Francisco?
How

2346
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:35,670
we know, right? La Is it a third?

2347
02:13:35,970 --> 02:13:38,040
Because the other two third dangerous

2348
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:41,250
hoes fucking creepers,

2349
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:46,350
there's a giant percentage that God,
guns and Ram,

2350
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:49,050
well at least, okay. So at least Europe,

2351
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:52,590
this two party dictatorships just
crushing us, man. Because when you know,

2352
02:13:52,591 --> 02:13:55,170
you have, you have money
in politics, which is like,

2353
02:13:55,290 --> 02:13:58,680
people spend half their time
if not more fundraising, right?

2354
02:13:58,980 --> 02:14:02,310
So how could we ever get these people
to really care about changing shit if

2355
02:14:02,311 --> 02:14:05,610
they're just trying to make money to
win the next election and the elections

2356
02:14:05,611 --> 02:14:09,200
here just discussing this dog and pony
show, it's like this fucking celebrity.

2357
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:13,080
They spent $1 billion last time.
You know, if you look at Europe,

2358
02:14:13,710 --> 02:14:17,550
you can argue about the parliamentary
system because of course there's fascist

2359
02:14:17,551 --> 02:14:19,560
parties that get in and that's not good.

2360
02:14:19,860 --> 02:14:24,480
But at least they have the avenues for
other voices other than like two parties.

2361
02:14:24,481 --> 02:14:27,090
And I think that it's just really
dangerous to have this system.

2362
02:14:27,150 --> 02:14:32,150
There was an interesting story in
the Guardian a couple of weeks ago,

2363
02:14:33,010 --> 02:14:37,930
um, that was, uh, it was the rise
of data and the death of politics.

2364
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:43,560
And the idea was that tech pioneers in
the u s are advocating a new database

2365
02:14:43,571 --> 02:14:46,960
approach to governance,
algorithmic regulation.

2366
02:14:47,080 --> 02:14:49,990
But if technology provides the
answers to society's problems,

2367
02:14:49,991 --> 02:14:51,310
what happens to governments?

2368
02:14:51,610 --> 02:14:55,600
And this idea was sort of their
sort of extrapolating on that,

2369
02:14:55,840 --> 02:15:00,160
that we're, we don't need
these representatives anymore.
They're, they're their,

2370
02:15:00,170 --> 02:15:01,720
this,
their legacy.

2371
02:15:01,960 --> 02:15:05,950
They're this weird system that was in
place when you had to fucking attach a

2372
02:15:05,951 --> 02:15:09,660
note to a pigeon and send
that motherfucker lose to
get the word out. You know,

2373
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:13,690
we don't need that anymore.
You could directly through your phone,

2374
02:15:13,870 --> 02:15:18,070
you could directly cast your opinion
on whatever it may be. You know,

2375
02:15:18,071 --> 02:15:21,400
and if we still have a
representative system, you could,

2376
02:15:21,970 --> 02:15:24,790
you could make the argument
that that's suppressive,

2377
02:15:24,980 --> 02:15:28,840
that's suppressive of the individual's
right to choose for themselves

2378
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:32,490
and then Gchq couldn't. But at
the polls she's checking. But I,

2379
02:15:32,491 --> 02:15:36,300
but I think decentralization is really,
I think it's really key.

2380
02:15:36,330 --> 02:15:39,750
And with technology you see things like
bitcoin working outside the system.

2381
02:15:39,751 --> 02:15:42,960
I think that we can,
if we can maintain that neutrality,

2382
02:15:42,961 --> 02:15:46,860
if the FCC wants to implement that
and be fucking for the people for once

2383
02:15:46,861 --> 02:15:50,110
instead of telecom
whores, yeah. Then we can,

2384
02:15:50,550 --> 02:15:53,880
we can really create some sort of
decentralization online and try to create

2385
02:15:53,881 --> 02:15:56,490
other avenues outside the system.
Um,

2386
02:15:56,820 --> 02:15:59,220
it's just a dangerous world
because as you're saying,

2387
02:15:59,221 --> 02:16:00,870
the more information that we have,

2388
02:16:00,930 --> 02:16:05,700
the less relevant these like authority
and establishment systems will be.

2389
02:16:05,701 --> 02:16:09,750
But at the same time it can almost trap
ourselves in a box like the algorithms

2390
02:16:09,751 --> 02:16:13,380
online. It can cater your own
biases toward you, where you,

2391
02:16:13,410 --> 02:16:16,170
all of your Google search results
are catered toward your bias and your

2392
02:16:16,171 --> 02:16:19,500
preferential like you know,
searching habits and stuff.

2393
02:16:19,501 --> 02:16:21,030
So it's like what information,

2394
02:16:21,330 --> 02:16:23,640
the information that you're seeking
might be different than the information

2395
02:16:23,670 --> 02:16:26,940
she's seeking and that's not good
to a free and open society too.

2396
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:28,740
Yeah, that is weird, right?

2397
02:16:28,830 --> 02:16:32,880
It's confirmation bias that comes from
surrounding yourself with likeminded

2398
02:16:32,890 --> 02:16:36,250
people. Exactly. Get
re really weird groups.

2399
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:38,470
You know like if you've
ever gone to like a,

2400
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:42,940
I like to go to like very bizarre websites
and message boards and listened to

2401
02:16:42,941 --> 02:16:44,800
people just debate about things.

2402
02:16:44,801 --> 02:16:48,660
The people that are just never would
come in contact with in real life and you

2403
02:16:48,661 --> 02:16:48,760
know,

2404
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:53,760
there's some right wing
Republican websites out there
that are so bizarre there.

2405
02:16:54,350 --> 02:16:57,610
They're so strange. It's like Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. You guys are serious.

2406
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:02,290
Like there was a Sarah Pailin website
launch recently, you know about that.

2407
02:17:02,500 --> 02:17:05,710
She's got her own online TV channel,
which costs

2408
02:17:07,250 --> 02:17:08,570
Liz wall is going to get a job there.

2409
02:17:08,571 --> 02:17:12,800
Probably that's the only thing she
could probably do smart enough to do.

2410
02:17:12,890 --> 02:17:14,570
But I was reading the,
the,

2411
02:17:14,670 --> 02:17:18,060
the comments and it's
like there were trolls.

2412
02:17:18,330 --> 02:17:21,630
It's like they were like comedy trolls,
you know,

2413
02:17:22,110 --> 02:17:24,900
and then I realized like you look at
the guy's profile and you follow those

2414
02:17:24,901 --> 02:17:29,400
other comments and you go,
oh no, your real, oh my God,

2415
02:17:29,401 --> 02:17:31,710
you're a real person. You know, like,

2416
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:35,910
you know God in capital letters
is looking out for America.

2417
02:17:35,970 --> 02:17:40,970
God blesses this fine land and people
like Sarah Pailin and true in all capital

2418
02:17:42,660 --> 02:17:45,240
Americans are,
you know what?

2419
02:17:45,241 --> 02:17:48,030
We need to get this country back on track.

2420
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:52,920
Like there's a few shitheads that I
follow on Twitter just for comedy and,

2421
02:17:52,921 --> 02:17:57,510
but they're fucking serious. They're
legit. Like they really just want gum.

2422
02:17:57,880 --> 02:18:01,680
It's so true, man. Everyone
check out. Margaret Heffernan,

2423
02:18:01,681 --> 02:18:05,850
she has this awesome Ted talk about
willful blindness and she has a whole book

2424
02:18:05,851 --> 02:18:09,660
on like competition and the confirmation
bias and how her whole thing,

2425
02:18:09,661 --> 02:18:13,050
it sounds so simple, but the way she
explains it is just like so mind blowing.

2426
02:18:13,051 --> 02:18:13,621
And she's just like,

2427
02:18:13,621 --> 02:18:16,820
you need to interact with people who
don't think what you do. You need,

2428
02:18:16,830 --> 02:18:18,840
this is like a part of human progress.

2429
02:18:18,841 --> 02:18:22,800
Like you need to and it'll
like reaffirming, you'll learn.

2430
02:18:22,801 --> 02:18:25,110
You can't just surround yourself
with yes men your whole life.

2431
02:18:25,111 --> 02:18:27,870
You need to be challenged every day,
like look and,

2432
02:18:27,871 --> 02:18:30,720
and not necessarily surround yourself
with a fucking trolls who are telling you,

2433
02:18:30,900 --> 02:18:34,290
you know what Sarah Palin's fucking great.
But watching the video like that dude,

2434
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:37,880
like the thing that we just watched
about Israel, like, like do that,

2435
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:41,180
see it someone else's point
of exactly. Yeah. This is, uh,

2436
02:18:41,470 --> 02:18:45,790
one of the guys that I follow. What Abe,
whatever label we stick on ourselves,

2437
02:18:46,030 --> 02:18:46,781
the kingdom,

2438
02:18:46,781 --> 02:18:51,781
all caps of heaven is for
who pleases the father.

2439
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:57,380
All caps in heaven. Wow.
I love this guy. Oh,

2440
02:18:57,390 --> 02:19:00,520
I read it some Dick was
not going to publicize

2441
02:19:03,170 --> 02:19:07,270
a little egg dickhead.
No, he's got to face,

2442
02:19:07,300 --> 02:19:11,950
he's just like some really
retarded a right wing dude. I love,

2443
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:15,790
I love reading his stuff though. Cause
I just go, what? You're a real guy,

2444
02:19:16,370 --> 02:19:18,390
right dude? It's so, and
I, and I'm, you know,

2445
02:19:18,410 --> 02:19:21,080
I'm a victim of it too because it's like,
who the fuck wants to hang out with?

2446
02:19:21,081 --> 02:19:24,460
Like people who are, you know, they're
pro, you're going to be a fight. Yeah.

2447
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:27,320
This guy's super pro Israel.
Barack Hussein,

2448
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:30,920
pray for Israel.
Use The IRS to attack America.

2449
02:19:30,921 --> 02:19:35,921
This is what line low life
socialist communist anti
Israel and tie u s demagogue

2450
02:19:38,871 --> 02:19:42,910
does. If they think Obama's a
communist. Wow. They need to really, uh,

2451
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:47,120
Lillo's communism. It's clearly
a socialist. Yeah. It's like,

2452
02:19:47,121 --> 02:19:51,140
have you seen Obamacare?
Obamacare is a disaster.

2453
02:19:51,141 --> 02:19:55,520
The website alone is cost a billion,
trillion dollars and it eats babies,

2454
02:19:55,810 --> 02:19:57,050
runs on babies.

2455
02:19:57,610 --> 02:20:01,430
Christian May be very uncritical thinker
if they think Obama's at remotely as

2456
02:20:01,431 --> 02:20:04,680
Socialists. Well, yeah, I
don't know, but this is crazy,

2457
02:20:04,980 --> 02:20:06,920
crazy super religious folks.

2458
02:20:07,330 --> 02:20:11,360
I'm also back Israel because they believe
that Israel is where Jesus is coming

2459
02:20:11,361 --> 02:20:15,410
back. Right? Right. Like did you ever see
the vice piece where they send these, uh,

2460
02:20:15,590 --> 02:20:19,880
these folks, uh, who are like
super duper religious cuckoo heads.

2461
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:21,710
They fucking make their pilgrimage.

2462
02:20:21,740 --> 02:20:24,850
They're Christians from America and
they make their pilgrimage to a,

2463
02:20:24,870 --> 02:20:27,230
to Israel and they follow
these people around and they,

2464
02:20:27,540 --> 02:20:31,790
they're reading scripture like out loud
on this fucking raft as they go, oh,

2465
02:20:32,330 --> 02:20:35,280
it's glorious.
It's glorious and all its shithead.

2466
02:20:35,370 --> 02:20:39,950
How have you seen an idiot abroad? Uh,
that's the, the rich. What's good, Ricky?

2467
02:20:39,951 --> 02:20:41,120
Gervais' second.
Hillary,

2468
02:20:41,130 --> 02:20:43,810
I haven't seen it makes everything
just looked like shit. Like a mix.

2469
02:20:43,820 --> 02:20:46,810
All the seven wonders of the world
just look terrible. Like this guy just

2470
02:20:46,950 --> 02:20:49,560
miserable. He goes and puts
them in the worst situations,

2471
02:20:49,561 --> 02:20:52,050
puts it in the worst hotels and shit.
Makes his life a living hell.

2472
02:20:52,051 --> 02:20:54,120
And he's just going around traveling
and complaining about everything.

2473
02:20:54,121 --> 02:20:57,690
It's fucking hysterical. It's
awesome. Ricky Gervais' is a genius,

2474
02:20:57,900 --> 02:21:00,600
but I want to ask you, have you
seen the vice special on Fukushima?

2475
02:21:01,020 --> 02:21:05,760
Yes. Oh my good God. This is
terrifying. I have a friend,

2476
02:21:05,761 --> 02:21:10,210
my friend ensign. Anyway, he goes
over there and he provides a few,

2477
02:21:10,230 --> 02:21:13,080
he's Japanese. He uh, well he's,

2478
02:21:13,140 --> 02:21:16,680
he was born in Hawaii but he's lived in
Japan for a long time and his Japanese

2479
02:21:16,681 --> 02:21:21,420
of, you know, his nationality, ethnicity
rather, but he's gone over there.

2480
02:21:21,480 --> 02:21:22,313
Um,

2481
02:21:22,360 --> 02:21:27,180
a bunch of times he goes over there and
it does a lot of like humanitarian aid

2482
02:21:27,181 --> 02:21:29,880
and he said it's really
strange because it goes,

2483
02:21:29,881 --> 02:21:33,390
cause you're over there and you feel
normal. He goes, you're feel fine,

2484
02:21:33,391 --> 02:21:37,320
but then you look at your radar tech
or your radioactive Geiger counter or

2485
02:21:37,321 --> 02:21:39,660
whatever and it's just
fucking off the charts.

2486
02:21:41,020 --> 02:21:44,130
Now you can only stay there for a certain
amount of time because you don't feel

2487
02:21:44,131 --> 02:21:44,964
anything.
Right.

2488
02:21:45,160 --> 02:21:48,890
Right about it. That's what's so fucked
up bro. It radiation. But I just, I mean,

2489
02:21:48,891 --> 02:21:52,400
even though I studied this shit every day,
I did not realize until you see it,

2490
02:21:52,460 --> 02:21:55,700
like until you see that that vice
special and you see the tanks,

2491
02:21:56,240 --> 02:22:01,240
how every day they're filling this whole
cool like reactor up with fresh water

2492
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:06,440
draining the radioactive
water like multiple times a
day storing it and hundreds

2493
02:22:06,441 --> 02:22:09,050
of tanks that they're gonna run out
of room. All the tanks are leaking.

2494
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:13,820
They're spilling like 30,000 gallons of
fucking radioactive water in the Pacific

2495
02:22:13,820 --> 02:22:16,250
Ocean every day. They have no idea
what the fuck they going to do.

2496
02:22:16,251 --> 02:22:19,940
And as the water's leaking out of these
tanks, they'd take the soil, dig it up,

2497
02:22:19,941 --> 02:22:22,250
and then store it in an empty lot.
Like they keep,

2498
02:22:22,430 --> 02:22:26,710
it's like there's no solution and
what are they going to fucking do now?

2499
02:22:26,740 --> 02:22:29,790
And what are they going to do? I don't
know. And then the Yakuza, they're high,

2500
02:22:29,850 --> 02:22:34,260
the Japanese government and Tepco or
hiring the Yakuza mafia there to help with

2501
02:22:34,261 --> 02:22:36,060
the fucking cleanup
because they owe them debt.

2502
02:22:36,660 --> 02:22:40,500
So all these like old Japanese men want
to help. They're like, we know how to,

2503
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:42,750
how like we've worked on the
reactors or whole life. They're like,

2504
02:22:42,751 --> 02:22:44,940
let us go like we're old,
we can die.

2505
02:22:45,270 --> 02:22:47,850
And they're like wanting to sacrifice
themselves and instead they're hiring

2506
02:22:47,851 --> 02:22:52,050
mafia members from the Yakuza mob that
have no idea what the fuck 30 I'm doing.

2507
02:22:52,410 --> 02:22:54,780
It's a fucking nightmare, man. Real. Yeah.

2508
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:56,890
What, what can they do? I mean,

2509
02:22:57,100 --> 02:23:01,630
I know that they have that idea to
dig this giant pit and then have it

2510
02:23:02,110 --> 02:23:05,610
surrounded with frozen cones and already
didn't work that already failed a

2511
02:23:05,620 --> 02:23:08,340
failure. Now the ice walls sound
like some Superman's. Yeah,

2512
02:23:08,680 --> 02:23:10,570
like a fucking prisoner interest of solid.

2513
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:17,680
Well look, I mean look at Chernobyl.
They have this giant sarcophagus.

2514
02:23:17,681 --> 02:23:18,340
That's correct.

2515
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:22,210
Jean. She was just telling me the
other day that um, you know, the,

2516
02:23:22,211 --> 02:23:24,460
the nuclear waste,
even with working reactors,

2517
02:23:24,461 --> 02:23:28,210
they just have to dig a pit and put
a fucking sign on it with a skull and

2518
02:23:28,211 --> 02:23:30,160
crossbones cause they're like,
whoa. In a million years,

2519
02:23:30,161 --> 02:23:32,080
even though the radioactive energy
will still be here, they're like,

2520
02:23:32,081 --> 02:23:35,310
at least the future civilization here
will know what a skull and cross bronzes

2521
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:38,110
and they won't be able to dig up
this waste. You're like, holy fuck.

2522
02:23:38,111 --> 02:23:42,400
Why are we dealing with an energy
that we can't harness properly?

2523
02:23:42,401 --> 02:23:46,270
Like it's a miracle and it's magic,
but clearly we don't know what the fuck

2524
02:23:46,270 --> 02:23:50,020
we're doing with it. Well, you know
it. All it does is make steam. Yeah.

2525
02:23:50,050 --> 02:23:54,010
That's what's so crazy.
When you see what it really just is.

2526
02:23:54,070 --> 02:23:58,840
I thought that it did something like
may the electricity with the new clear

2527
02:23:58,870 --> 02:23:59,671
something,

2528
02:23:59,671 --> 02:24:04,060
a splitting atoms and it just goes right
through the wires and their housing it

2529
02:24:04,061 --> 02:24:08,530
and some giant fucking listening. They're
making steam. It's hot. It's hot as fuck.

2530
02:24:09,070 --> 02:24:12,400
Like couldn't they like uh,
do that in a better way?

2531
02:24:14,300 --> 02:24:17,950
Seems like a lot of ways to make steam.
Can you use boil water?

2532
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:20,980
Can you guys fucking,
what do you assholes doing?

2533
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:24,860
You guys are making some shit that you
can never shut off, which is really crazy.

2534
02:24:24,890 --> 02:24:28,800
Next to a fault line right next to the
ocean. It's like what can go wrong?

2535
02:24:29,340 --> 02:24:31,050
Well, they're all over
the place too, right?

2536
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:34,620
The really bizarre thing is when you
drive down the California coast and you

2537
02:24:34,621 --> 02:24:38,850
realize that we are on a fault, right?
Like California moves all the time

2538
02:24:39,090 --> 02:24:43,380
and then you go on the way to San Diego.
This is fucking nuclear power plants.

2539
02:24:43,381 --> 02:24:44,214
That's right.

2540
02:24:44,550 --> 02:24:46,680
Design,
except very small difference.

2541
02:24:46,681 --> 02:24:49,210
It's GE as a general
electric design and they are,

2542
02:24:49,211 --> 02:24:52,290
we have 22 sister reactors here in the
u s that are almost identical to the

2543
02:24:52,291 --> 02:24:53,790
Fukushima ones.
Well,

2544
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:58,560
the thing about the reactors, it's
super disturbing is people say, well,

2545
02:24:58,561 --> 02:25:02,040
it's clean, it's efficient.
It's very, it's very, you know,

2546
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:06,660
as far as like the access to the
energy, it's very, very efficient.

2547
02:25:07,170 --> 02:25:10,380
But once those things go bad,

2548
02:25:10,410 --> 02:25:14,880
they're bad for forever.
So you have, as of now,

2549
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:18,210
there's only two spots,
but those two spots are toast.

2550
02:25:18,450 --> 02:25:21,540
Chernobyl and Fukushima are fucking toast.

2551
02:25:21,720 --> 02:25:24,280
Those areas are fucked for
a hundred thousand years.

2552
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:28,330
And then you have the storage of the
nuclear waste from all the other places

2553
02:25:28,331 --> 02:25:30,190
that are still operational.

2554
02:25:30,550 --> 02:25:34,360
And you have this spot in Nevada where
they have a fucking hole or Godzilla goes

2555
02:25:34,361 --> 02:25:39,130
to eat is radioactive energy. When he
lands here, I mean, what the fuck man?

2556
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:44,160
Why this is only a hundred years less
than a hundred years of of splitting

2557
02:25:44,441 --> 02:25:45,274
atoms,
right?

2558
02:25:45,310 --> 02:25:50,290
Nuclear bomb 1945 and here we are
in 2014 less than a hundred years.

2559
02:25:50,291 --> 02:25:54,190
And you guys doing this shit and you
already have two spots that are broken.

2560
02:25:54,520 --> 02:25:54,911
You know,

2561
02:25:54,911 --> 02:25:59,911
if you could look at the future and you
look at all the potential spots to go

2562
02:26:00,221 --> 02:26:05,050
wrong, like if we, if we had a
hot map where you could, you know,

2563
02:26:05,051 --> 02:26:09,160
everything that's blue is a nuclear
reactor that's currently working and

2564
02:26:09,161 --> 02:26:13,240
functional and you have the two red spots
and then you look at all the potential

2565
02:26:13,241 --> 02:26:17,020
for red spots,
these blue ones to go bad like God,

2566
02:26:17,021 --> 02:26:21,700
we're going to fuck up a huge percentage
of the world with this power source.

2567
02:26:21,790 --> 02:26:25,120
And I don't know a better method,
but if I lived in California,

2568
02:26:25,121 --> 02:26:28,120
which I do and it never fucking
gets cloudy, which doesn't,

2569
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:30,670
I would say maybe that's
solar thing is how you guys,

2570
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:33,330
well, let's just try it. I mean,
the thing is it's not working.

2571
02:26:33,331 --> 02:26:35,860
I think that we really do need to
shut down. I'll reactors. I know I've,

2572
02:26:35,910 --> 02:26:39,900
I've had someone on my show to talk about
Thorin still there's a matter of the

2573
02:26:39,901 --> 02:26:43,740
waste, even though it's a much smaller
concentrated amount, it's still a problem.

2574
02:26:43,741 --> 02:26:46,470
And yes, maybe we can harness
it differently and more safely.

2575
02:26:46,471 --> 02:26:47,700
But at the end of the day,
like you said,

2576
02:26:47,701 --> 02:26:51,750
is it worth the risk to fucking have
this shit out there for a million years?

2577
02:26:51,751 --> 02:26:56,070
Like is it worth it when we do have
other sources? That's why Einstein,

2578
02:26:56,071 --> 02:26:59,910
when we did split the atom and Einstein
wrote this letter to the president and

2579
02:26:59,911 --> 02:27:02,730
he was like, Whoa, where
did that come from?

2580
02:27:02,950 --> 02:27:03,783
Right.

2581
02:27:04,730 --> 02:27:08,360
Um, but when, when they first
saw the nuclear bomb go off on,

2582
02:27:08,450 --> 02:27:11,870
on whatever the hell island it was that
they saw the first explosion, you know,

2583
02:27:11,871 --> 02:27:14,360
all they told them it was just to
wear little sunglasses out there.

2584
02:27:14,361 --> 02:27:17,630
There's that photo of all of them. They
like quoted Bhagavad Gita and they said,

2585
02:27:17,631 --> 02:27:21,900
we've become death. Like what have we
done? Like the guy who like Oppenheimer.

2586
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:25,250
Yeah, yeah. It's so creepy
when Oppenheimer says it,

2587
02:27:25,610 --> 02:27:29,840
he quoted the Bhagavad Gita. He says,
I am become death destroyer of worlds.

2588
02:27:29,870 --> 02:27:34,070
It's a really creep pull it up because
it's, it's, it's a really bizarre,

2589
02:27:34,100 --> 02:27:37,250
because when you actually hear
it from Oppenheimer's voice,

2590
02:27:37,610 --> 02:27:42,200
when he talks about how he felt
and you see his face, the regret,

2591
02:27:42,410 --> 02:27:46,540
cause he was a part of this thing
and that's not even nuclear energy,

2592
02:27:46,870 --> 02:27:50,520
nuclear bomb, you know,
he decided, you know,

2593
02:27:50,540 --> 02:27:53,540
at that point in time that they'd
made tremendous, tremendous mistake.

2594
02:27:54,350 --> 02:27:55,490
And here we are,

2595
02:27:55,730 --> 02:27:59,660
2014 it's still our major source of
electricity in the United States from

2596
02:27:59,661 --> 02:28:00,494
America.

2597
02:28:01,550 --> 02:28:04,670
Everyone should check out
until the history of the
United States because in it I

2598
02:28:04,671 --> 02:28:06,740
learned that Reagan fucking Asshole,

2599
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:12,760
he was actually approached by Gorbachev
to totally dismantle all of the nuclear

2600
02:28:12,981 --> 02:28:16,970
weapons. Like he was just like, look, it's
done. Let's fucking close it all down.

2601
02:28:17,330 --> 02:28:21,110
And Reagan was like, no, cause I'm
senile and I believe in Star Wars.

2602
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:22,100
I think that we can create

2603
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:25,580
this giant space program and Blah,
blah, blah. And he just like said no.

2604
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:27,980
And I blame him. Dude.
He, he had the chance,

2605
02:28:27,981 --> 02:28:30,080
he had the golden ticket
and he gave up on it. Men,

2606
02:28:30,490 --> 02:28:32,070
I want to talk about conspiracies.

2607
02:28:32,090 --> 02:28:36,070
Have you ever looked in the star wars
scientists that have mysteriously been

2608
02:28:36,071 --> 02:28:39,190
murdered? No. Oh, good
Lord. That's a weird,

2609
02:28:40,030 --> 02:28:43,810
here's star wars scientists.

2610
02:28:46,180 --> 02:28:50,740
Yeah. If you do that, if you type that
in, first thing that pumps up his deaths,

2611
02:28:51,130 --> 02:28:55,660
conspiracy murdered. Whoa. Yeah. It's um,

2612
02:28:55,780 --> 02:29:00,780
who killed all the British star wards
scientists and there's a bunch of

2613
02:29:01,091 --> 02:29:05,860
different websites about it. Yeah.
Yeah. There's a, a real, it's a,

2614
02:29:05,861 --> 02:29:10,840
it's really fascinating how many
people died and the mysterious deaths,

2615
02:29:11,530 --> 02:29:16,390
uh, all 25 workers on the United
States Star Wars project were killed.

2616
02:29:16,910 --> 02:29:21,910
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. They
died in really weird ways.

2617
02:29:21,911 --> 02:29:25,300
He died in plane crashes
and all sorts of Shit. Yeah.

2618
02:29:25,870 --> 02:29:28,210
Did it just like the
sealed all 25 workers,

2619
02:29:28,630 --> 02:29:33,400
United States star wars projects
and the sting ray torpedo projects.

2620
02:29:33,820 --> 02:29:37,570
Um, although the United Kingdom's
Ministry of Defense still disputes,

2621
02:29:37,571 --> 02:29:40,030
these workers were connected
to the star wars project.

2622
02:29:40,270 --> 02:29:45,250
Most workers died either having finished
important projects or when they left

2623
02:29:45,251 --> 02:29:46,810
for other employers.

2624
02:29:47,050 --> 02:29:50,920
Several of those who died had routinely
expressed fears for their safety.

2625
02:29:51,250 --> 02:29:53,860
The manner of their death
was also very curious.

2626
02:29:53,861 --> 02:29:58,861
And despite open verdicts or verdicts
of suicide in the postmortems,

2627
02:29:59,830 --> 02:30:04,390
there were aspects to their desks that
made these verdicts seem highly unlikely.

2628
02:30:04,391 --> 02:30:07,660
One of the strangest desk
was that of Shinai Warren,

2629
02:30:07,661 --> 02:30:12,280
a personal assistant for the company
that was taken over by Ge. See Marconi,

2630
02:30:12,750 --> 02:30:16,990
Shari was found drowned in
18 inches of water, gagged,

2631
02:30:17,050 --> 02:30:18,460
a noose around her neck,

2632
02:30:18,461 --> 02:30:22,660
her feet balanced suicide and
her hands bound behind her back.

2633
02:30:23,470 --> 02:30:25,690
Wow.
Mark Wise and Arrow Sophomore,

2634
02:30:25,780 --> 02:30:30,780
a software engineer for the mod was found
dead with a plastic sack over his head

2635
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:34,810
and several feet of clingfilm
wrapped around his head.

2636
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:37,750
This was deemed an accident by the corner,

2637
02:30:38,320 --> 02:30:43,320
but it was exactly the same way as
Mark's colleague Richard Puig who met his

2638
02:30:43,991 --> 02:30:48,040
untimely. Uh, and several weeks earlier,

2639
02:30:48,590 --> 02:30:50,590
a Shard Sharif,
uh,

2640
02:30:50,591 --> 02:30:55,540
an experienced defense contractor was
found dead after placing a ligature around

2641
02:30:55,541 --> 02:30:56,171
his neck,

2642
02:30:56,171 --> 02:31:01,171
tying the other end around a tree
and driving off in his car with the

2643
02:31:01,451 --> 02:31:04,000
accelerator pedal jam down.

2644
02:31:04,210 --> 02:31:07,780
The police felt this was a
most unusual suicide method,

2645
02:31:08,020 --> 02:31:11,950
but still deemed it a suicide. Wow. Yeah.

2646
02:31:11,951 --> 02:31:15,970
He had last been seen in Bristol, um, uh,

2647
02:31:16,130 --> 02:31:21,130
a long way from his home looking into
guest house using cash and was witnessed

2648
02:31:22,321 --> 02:31:26,650
by a, with a large bag of money.
These details, although, uh,

2649
02:31:26,690 --> 02:31:29,610
known to the police were never
mentioned in his inquest.

2650
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:34,420
There's a whole bunch of them. There's
a whole bunch of these. Very serious,

2651
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:37,590
yeah. It's fucking fascinating, man.

2652
02:31:37,620 --> 02:31:42,620
It's fascinating how many of them died
because apparently star wars was total

2653
02:31:43,081 --> 02:31:46,030
horse shit, right? It was
never going to work. And,

2654
02:31:46,370 --> 02:31:50,040
and they knew it from the jump and all
the scientists that were connected to it

2655
02:31:50,490 --> 02:31:51,323
died.

2656
02:31:51,450 --> 02:31:56,190
So all these people that could have been
able to prove that these fuckers had

2657
02:31:56,191 --> 02:31:59,730
just embezzled all this
money and had used, you know,

2658
02:31:59,731 --> 02:32:03,090
their defense contracts
and spent all this cash,

2659
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:07,080
all the people connected to it that
actually could prove the science behind it

2660
02:32:07,081 --> 02:32:08,910
or disprove the science
behind it are all dead.

2661
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:13,280
That's insane. That's when, you know,
the CIO is up to some crazy shit.

2662
02:32:13,370 --> 02:32:17,810
It's amazing. Well, it's like, it
kind of makes sense, right? You know,

2663
02:32:18,010 --> 02:32:21,620
it's all that profit at the end of
the day, man. It really is. Yeah.

2664
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:23,600
The story of birth of Champagne.

2665
02:32:23,601 --> 02:32:28,160
She was the maid of Jeb Bush or
Bush or Bush Senior's family,

2666
02:32:28,161 --> 02:32:28,911
or I forget who,

2667
02:32:28,911 --> 02:32:33,911
and she was found crushed
with an empty car that like,

2668
02:32:34,010 --> 02:32:35,750
you know,
someone had driven an empty car,

2669
02:32:35,751 --> 02:32:39,230
backed up into the garage and
crushed her to death and you're like,

2670
02:32:39,231 --> 02:32:43,100
what did she now clearly
shaken is killed. I mean, like,

2671
02:32:43,101 --> 02:32:46,640
no one in an empty car just doesn't
start and crush someone against the wall.

2672
02:32:47,030 --> 02:32:51,530
So crazy. Yeah. Between 1982 in 1986,

2673
02:32:51,800 --> 02:32:55,820
23 deaths of English scientists that
work in the star wars related projects.

2674
02:32:56,480 --> 02:33:00,530
Uh, professor Keith Boden
killed in an auto crash. Uh,

2675
02:33:00,560 --> 02:33:05,310
Jack Wolfson den died in a
glider accident. Earnest Broccoli

2676
02:33:05,410 --> 02:33:09,520
way suicide, Steph and drink
water suicide by strangulation.

2677
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:10,960
Lieutenant Colonel Anthony,

2678
02:33:10,961 --> 02:33:15,961
godly missing declared dead George Frank
suicide by hanging Stephan Oak suicide

2679
02:33:16,361 --> 02:33:21,190
by hanging Johnathan Walsh suicide by
jumping from a building. Jonathan Britain,

2680
02:33:21,191 --> 02:33:23,410
suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning.

2681
02:33:23,530 --> 02:33:26,220
These are all within like
a year or two now. Sorry,

2682
02:33:26,290 --> 02:33:28,990
Sharif that guy that we talked about
placing the rope around his neck and

2683
02:33:28,991 --> 02:33:32,710
driving off. This is crazy.
It's just like the DC Madam,

2684
02:33:32,711 --> 02:33:34,270
that woman who came out and she was like,
oh,

2685
02:33:34,271 --> 02:33:36,400
I have all this shit that I'm
going to say, and she's like,

2686
02:33:36,401 --> 02:33:40,050
I'm never going to kill myself and I
can indict so many people and all of the

2687
02:33:40,051 --> 02:33:41,770
sudden she just killed her
staff whenever it was like, oh,

2688
02:33:41,771 --> 02:33:43,420
I guess she ended up killing herself.
You're like,

2689
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:45,580
that's just a little bit strange.

2690
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:49,940
Yeah.
DC madams those don't have a long life.

2691
02:33:50,810 --> 02:33:54,700
That's not a bad profession.
Yeah.

2692
02:33:54,710 --> 02:33:59,510
You didn't take the most
powerful murderers on the
planet who essentially have

2693
02:33:59,511 --> 02:34:03,700
all these methods and they have these
organizations that kill for forum.

2694
02:34:04,040 --> 02:34:06,740
I mean they have, whether it's
black water, whatever. I mean,

2695
02:34:06,741 --> 02:34:09,140
if there is a black water,
it's police.

2696
02:34:09,290 --> 02:34:12,450
If there's fucking cocacola
there's RC Cola. Okay.

2697
02:34:12,770 --> 02:34:16,360
There's some lower level
organizations of mercenaries.

2698
02:34:16,370 --> 02:34:19,740
This is not like there's black water.
You could only go to blackwater. No,

2699
02:34:19,750 --> 02:34:22,110
there's probably some dudes that are
really good at being a mercenary.

2700
02:34:22,120 --> 02:34:24,880
Do you know how to keep their
fucking mouth shut and they don't go?

2701
02:34:24,881 --> 02:34:26,980
Eric Prince and the
whole thing and you know,

2702
02:34:27,220 --> 02:34:29,960
do press conferences and changed
their name three or four times.

2703
02:34:29,961 --> 02:34:33,520
They might even have a fucking
name, right. Call Mike. You know,

2704
02:34:33,610 --> 02:34:36,820
Mike used to be a marine or a
green baret or whatever and he,

2705
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:41,710
he likes making $50,000 a week better.
You know, so that guy works for you.

2706
02:34:42,490 --> 02:34:47,140
Gotta be a ton of those fucking people
out there. This outta be absolutely man.

2707
02:34:47,170 --> 02:34:51,970
So DC, Madam Madam, that bitch is
dead. She's fucking murdered bro.

2708
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:55,110
And whatever happened to her, her,
all of her notes and all of her or

2709
02:34:56,920 --> 02:35:00,210
she committed suicide. That's the
official line of your question at,

2710
02:35:00,220 --> 02:35:03,940
you're an insane conspiracy. There's, well
you are and insane conspiracy theorist.

2711
02:35:03,970 --> 02:35:08,620
You have to admit, you have to be. If you
are conspiracy theorists, you're insane.

2712
02:35:08,770 --> 02:35:12,850
If you in, if you look into any
conspiracy, you're an insane conspiracy,

2713
02:35:12,930 --> 02:35:17,430
which is crazy because conspiracies
exist all the time on a local level.

2714
02:35:17,431 --> 02:35:21,210
People conspired to kill their kids,
like the kid in the car, tragically,

2715
02:35:21,211 --> 02:35:23,460
who the parents conspired to
like keep them in the car.

2716
02:35:23,850 --> 02:35:26,730
So if conspiracies happen between
parents to kill their children,

2717
02:35:26,731 --> 02:35:30,180
why is it so fucking crazy to imagine
that people at a higher level or

2718
02:35:30,181 --> 02:35:33,360
conspiring stuff? Because it's the whole,
they wouldn't be able to keep it secret,

2719
02:35:33,361 --> 02:35:37,320
blah, blah, blah. I mean, we
know that conspiracies exists.

2720
02:35:37,321 --> 02:35:41,420
Look at fucking Wall Street. What
does that and Ron, yeah, exactly.

2721
02:35:41,660 --> 02:35:45,530
Look at Gulf of Tonkin, right? They'll
get operation Northwoods. Exactly.

2722
02:35:45,540 --> 02:35:46,560
And look at the fucking,

2723
02:35:46,561 --> 02:35:49,650
the Bush administration was thinking
about doing a false flag event to get us

2724
02:35:49,651 --> 02:35:52,320
into why, oh my God, I
know. Oh my God. I know

2725
02:35:54,450 --> 02:35:58,950
what Dick Cheney said. Are they gonna
do like a sly a plane and like, yeah,

2726
02:35:59,130 --> 02:36:01,770
that was the operation Northwoods where
they were going to fly a plane and blow

2727
02:36:01,771 --> 02:36:05,250
it up in the sky and blame it on
the Cubans arm. Guan to our arm.

2728
02:36:05,251 --> 02:36:09,480
Cuban friendlies attack wanton him obey.
That was 62 and Kennedy went, what?

2729
02:36:09,590 --> 02:36:12,890
I mean, yeah, Nikki crazy. He
was like, no, no, no. Yeah.

2730
02:36:12,930 --> 02:36:14,940
That was signed by the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

2731
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:19,380
That wasn't just like some idle chatter
like they had signed off on that.

2732
02:36:20,310 --> 02:36:24,510
Talk about how stupid it is that we still
like hate Cuba and have this blockade

2733
02:36:24,511 --> 02:36:29,310
in CG on Cuba. What the fuck is Cuban
doing? US Cold War grudge, like just luck.

2734
02:36:29,311 --> 02:36:30,660
Cuba just live.

2735
02:36:31,060 --> 02:36:35,370
How's Tuba worse than Saudi
Arabia? I, there you go. Yeah,

2736
02:36:35,630 --> 02:36:36,550
and not well known.

2737
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:41,050
They're super close and they make great
cigars and the women are really pretty

2738
02:36:41,330 --> 02:36:43,870
see in the great great boxers
and wrestlers and the right there

2739
02:36:44,250 --> 02:36:46,770
and I want to go like I did they,
I'm just saying this selfishly,

2740
02:36:46,771 --> 02:36:48,660
like I don't want to not
be able to go to Cuba.

2741
02:36:48,661 --> 02:36:50,490
I think it's just the
stupidest thing in the world.

2742
02:36:50,491 --> 02:36:54,450
Like we demonize this country
because we have this, you know,

2743
02:36:54,451 --> 02:36:57,150
communist grudge shit
against them and they've,

2744
02:36:57,330 --> 02:37:00,500
they're actually incorporating a lot
of different techniques. Like, um,

2745
02:37:00,930 --> 02:37:02,490
the Castro family is like,
look,

2746
02:37:02,730 --> 02:37:06,270
we admit that a lot of things have failed
in terms of like the business side and

2747
02:37:06,271 --> 02:37:07,830
we're like being creative.

2748
02:37:07,831 --> 02:37:10,830
We're opening ourselves up to like
some capitalist elements and I just,

2749
02:37:10,980 --> 02:37:15,590
I just like, I appreciate the fact
that they're learning from mistakes,

2750
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:16,520
reinventing

2751
02:37:16,520 --> 02:37:19,010
the wheel. And I think that
we just have a lot to learn.

2752
02:37:19,011 --> 02:37:23,690
Like I just think closing ourselves
off from this tiny island nation is

2753
02:37:23,691 --> 02:37:27,350
disgusting and it's absurd. And
we'd still demonize them, you know?

2754
02:37:27,530 --> 02:37:30,500
Well there are definitely
fucked up though. I mean their,

2755
02:37:30,501 --> 02:37:35,060
their whole country and their system of
government and their system of forcing

2756
02:37:35,061 --> 02:37:39,440
occupation on people is pretty
fucking creepy. It's not great.

2757
02:37:39,770 --> 02:37:43,200
We should, but I mean, this
whole blockade, I just think
as a disgrace, you know?

2758
02:37:43,230 --> 02:37:45,770
Good for anybody. No,
no. And I think that,

2759
02:37:45,771 --> 02:37:47,900
who knows what it would be like if we
looked at the blockade. I don't know,

2760
02:37:47,930 --> 02:37:48,800
but it's just,
once again,

2761
02:37:48,801 --> 02:37:51,890
US and Israel are the only two countries
in the world to uphold the blockade.

2762
02:37:52,170 --> 02:37:55,440
It's like, just fucking let it go, man.
Well look what's going on with China who,

2763
02:37:55,450 --> 02:37:58,460
which was also an incredibly
communist country, you know,

2764
02:37:58,461 --> 02:38:00,170
and now they're really capitalists.

2765
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:04,550
It's like really strange things or
have like a little element, you know?

2766
02:38:04,551 --> 02:38:09,320
I think the Cuba is a, it's a, it's a
very interesting place because, well,

2767
02:38:09,321 --> 02:38:10,790
you remember when Jay z went to Cuban,

2768
02:38:10,791 --> 02:38:13,340
he got in trouble and
in the media was like,

2769
02:38:13,370 --> 02:38:18,280
oh look it does he know that that
fucking che hated black people.

2770
02:38:18,281 --> 02:38:20,870
You're like, what are you talking
about? Like what is going on?

2771
02:38:20,871 --> 02:38:25,871
It was the weirdest and [inaudible] 64
or something when Che Guevara and he also

2772
02:38:26,571 --> 02:38:30,230
went over to Angola and fought like
the revolution in Africa. So it's like,

2773
02:38:30,231 --> 02:38:32,780
I don't know if that's really true,
but it's just so crazy.

2774
02:38:32,810 --> 02:38:35,240
He was the perfect guy though.
It'd be on a tee shirt.

2775
02:38:35,390 --> 02:38:39,280
He just looked like such a
great revolutionary. I know
people that wore a check.

2776
02:38:39,290 --> 02:38:42,230
We'll Vara tee shirt that
didn't know Jack Shit about,

2777
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:45,770
remember there was that wave of Che
Guevara support that happened like,

2778
02:38:46,100 --> 02:38:48,220
like a decade ago or
so. It can, no one knew.

2779
02:38:48,221 --> 02:38:51,270
It was really what they were talking
about. Like you could look cool.

2780
02:38:51,271 --> 02:38:53,390
They have one, a cig,
we'll Vara tee shirt on.

2781
02:38:53,750 --> 02:38:57,590
People had Che Guevara Tattoos
and he's like, why? What,

2782
02:38:57,591 --> 02:39:02,220
what about Che Fucking Vive? A lot
of it. As soon as he stops, you know,

2783
02:39:03,700 --> 02:39:06,290
like the guy and he would have hated it.

2784
02:39:06,291 --> 02:39:09,260
I mean like the fact that he's become
this commercial figure would have been

2785
02:39:09,261 --> 02:39:10,850
like, he wouldn't fucking
hated that. You know,

2786
02:39:10,851 --> 02:39:13,970
it's just funny that he's become
this icon of like capitalism.

2787
02:39:13,971 --> 02:39:18,230
What's a perfect example of
these like surface inquiries?

2788
02:39:18,650 --> 02:39:22,790
Like people just go to look at it
like, oh that guy was bad ass. No,

2789
02:39:23,030 --> 02:39:26,150
no, like looking into it at all. No.

2790
02:39:26,151 --> 02:39:31,040
Trying to understand who he was or
knowing like deeply about who he was.

2791
02:39:31,370 --> 02:39:36,290
Yeah. This is like a baby. Cuba's
fucked up in a lot of ways. I,

2792
02:39:36,291 --> 02:39:39,620
it's a different way to live. You know,
like they don't have advertisements,

2793
02:39:39,621 --> 02:39:41,900
they have old cars.
It's kind of cool.

2794
02:39:41,901 --> 02:39:45,650
They have these restored old
cars driving around everywhere.

2795
02:39:45,890 --> 02:39:49,910
I'll give you see modern Cuba,
they have these 1950s cars.

2796
02:39:49,911 --> 02:39:53,630
They're driving around like these old
Chevy's and shit. It's really interesting.

2797
02:39:53,690 --> 02:39:57,680
I just want to go there and just learn
because they don't use pesticides and

2798
02:39:57,681 --> 02:39:59,750
shit cause it because of
how closed off they are.

2799
02:39:59,751 --> 02:40:03,350
And a lot of ways they've just adapted
in a lot of interesting ways that I just

2800
02:40:03,351 --> 02:40:06,860
think is, it's fascinating. I
think that we have, you know,

2801
02:40:07,100 --> 02:40:09,620
I know a lot of athletes that fleed Cuba,

2802
02:40:09,890 --> 02:40:13,980
so unfortunately I've seen the
worst side of it talking to

2803
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:17,100
people that lived in Cuba
under the Castro regime,

2804
02:40:17,101 --> 02:40:20,190
people that tried to flee got caught,
you know,

2805
02:40:20,191 --> 02:40:23,310
were forced back and then escaped again.
I mean they,

2806
02:40:23,370 --> 02:40:28,080
these fucking people got on boats and
risk their lives had to be something

2807
02:40:28,140 --> 02:40:32,670
horribly wrong with the conditions they
were living in. Forced me to do that.

2808
02:40:33,210 --> 02:40:38,210
But I would like to know if
that's exacerbated by these
policies of not allowing

2809
02:40:40,531 --> 02:40:42,390
trade. Right. You know, and who knows,

2810
02:40:42,391 --> 02:40:47,391
like if trade was opened up trade and
also the influence of foreigners coming in

2811
02:40:48,391 --> 02:40:49,380
there and influencing them.

2812
02:40:49,410 --> 02:40:53,600
Culture. Tourists. Exactly. I mean,
I don't, you know, yeah. We're,

2813
02:40:53,610 --> 02:40:56,490
we're basically like forcing the
society to be closed off and who knows?

2814
02:40:56,491 --> 02:40:58,470
Like if they weren't,
you know,

2815
02:40:58,471 --> 02:41:00,860
if we allowed the fiber lines
to get the internet and that's,

2816
02:41:00,890 --> 02:41:02,490
and that's another
problem is we don't even,

2817
02:41:02,670 --> 02:41:07,530
we've like blocked off the fiber optic
like network from Cuba so it's like let

2818
02:41:07,531 --> 02:41:09,990
them have like do they
have the Internet at all?

2819
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:12,780
They have like very limited
internet and I'd probably just,

2820
02:41:12,781 --> 02:41:14,730
I'm getting though the US maze there,
which by the way,

2821
02:41:14,731 --> 02:41:18,830
I'm going there next week I'm
going to go on Ebay and that weird,

2822
02:41:18,840 --> 02:41:22,200
you can go to Cuba, but only the part
of Cuba where it's a fucking much,

2823
02:41:22,490 --> 02:41:25,350
I was just like a fuck you to the
Cuban government just to be like,

2824
02:41:25,351 --> 02:41:28,610
we're going to build like
this torture base here. What?

2825
02:41:28,611 --> 02:41:33,150
Like how did that happen? It happened
obviously in the 60s is a long time ago.

2826
02:41:33,151 --> 02:41:33,940
They had that

2827
02:41:33,940 --> 02:41:36,640
based there. The military base have
been there for a long ass fucking time.

2828
02:41:36,820 --> 02:41:38,440
That was the operation Northwoods.

2829
02:41:38,441 --> 02:41:42,520
They were going to bomb Guantanamo
Bay and blame it on the Cubans. Yeah,

2830
02:41:42,521 --> 02:41:45,220
it is kind of fucked. Is that how
they're allowed to torture people?

2831
02:41:45,290 --> 02:41:48,320
We tortured some folks.
Is that how they're allowed to do that?

2832
02:41:48,321 --> 02:41:52,040
Because it's over there. I mean, could
you torture people on American soil?

2833
02:41:53,300 --> 02:41:54,170
That's a good question.

2834
02:41:54,171 --> 02:41:57,560
I think it's probably easier to absolve
themselves of responsibility from doing

2835
02:41:57,561 --> 02:42:01,290
it and keep it. That's why we have CIA
black sites and like port, like um,

2836
02:42:01,350 --> 02:42:05,360
you know, Poland and shit. So I think it's
just like, as long as it's out of sight,

2837
02:42:05,361 --> 02:42:06,050
out of mind.

2838
02:42:06,050 --> 02:42:10,530
But what's so crazy to me about the
getting of the thing is the Bo Bergdahl

2839
02:42:10,530 --> 02:42:14,540
Sangha, how they're like, we released the
five worst of the worst. It's like shit,

2840
02:42:14,541 --> 02:42:15,920
if you release the five
worst of the worst.

2841
02:42:15,921 --> 02:42:19,190
So what about the other 120 innocent
people that we already know are innocent?

2842
02:42:19,191 --> 02:42:20,390
Like why are they still in there?

2843
02:42:20,391 --> 02:42:23,180
If it was so easy to release
the five worst of the worst,

2844
02:42:23,260 --> 02:42:24,760
why won't they release those people?

2845
02:42:24,761 --> 02:42:29,590
Because they're worried that they're
going to go and say what happened to them?

2846
02:42:29,591 --> 02:42:33,730
Or is it because they would have to
admit that they were holding people that

2847
02:42:33,731 --> 02:42:37,150
weren't really, I mean, once they do
let them go and then they start talking,

2848
02:42:37,151 --> 02:42:39,370
then they'd have to admit that there's
probably a lot of other people that are

2849
02:42:39,371 --> 02:42:40,140
also like

2850
02:42:40,140 --> 02:42:42,980
for the bird Bowe Bergdahl thing.
I think that was Bo Bergdahl.

2851
02:42:43,030 --> 02:42:47,040
That was the dude who was like captured
by the Taliban and then they did a

2852
02:42:47,041 --> 02:42:49,180
prisoner swap five guys. Dude. Yeah.

2853
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:52,350
So he came back and then they
gave those five dudes. Um,

2854
02:42:52,440 --> 02:42:55,480
and I think that really blew apart the
whole logic of keeping these people in

2855
02:42:55,490 --> 02:42:58,380
and Fontana my baby, because
before that Obama, you know,

2856
02:42:58,381 --> 02:43:00,420
he'd gotten office saying,
I'm going to close down get mountain.

2857
02:43:00,460 --> 02:43:02,280
Everyone blames the Republicans
for not letting him.

2858
02:43:02,281 --> 02:43:04,890
The truth is he could sign a national
security waiver and release every single

2859
02:43:04,891 --> 02:43:09,750
one today if you wanted to. And the fact
that he kept maintaining, well, you know,

2860
02:43:10,050 --> 02:43:14,560
we can't trust to take these people back
because Yemen can harbor terrorism and

2861
02:43:14,561 --> 02:43:17,140
like they can become terrorists and
then they can retaliate. And it's like,

2862
02:43:17,141 --> 02:43:19,540
well you trust Yemen to carry
out drone strikes there.

2863
02:43:19,690 --> 02:43:22,510
You're like working with the MNE
government and all these other fashions.

2864
02:43:22,870 --> 02:43:25,710
And that's where we, they
release these these dudes. Um,

2865
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:28,970
and I just think that we need to fucking
get these people out of chemo cause

2866
02:43:28,990 --> 02:43:29,591
they're innocent.

2867
02:43:29,591 --> 02:43:32,650
And I would rather take the chance of
like having someone retaliate than to keep

2868
02:43:32,651 --> 02:43:35,950
an innocent person in prison for the
rest of their life with no charges.

2869
02:43:36,130 --> 02:43:40,360
And my whole thing is if they're so bad,
like those five, worst of the worst guys,

2870
02:43:40,630 --> 02:43:42,010
if they were so bad,

2871
02:43:42,011 --> 02:43:45,070
how can we couldn't find anything to
charge him with for 10 years? Like,

2872
02:43:45,071 --> 02:43:49,210
where was the charges? Where the
hell, what, what happened? You know.

2873
02:43:49,300 --> 02:43:53,350
Well I've seen some instances where
people were released and they talked about

2874
02:43:53,351 --> 02:43:55,240
what happened and how they got
arrested in the first place.

2875
02:43:55,270 --> 02:44:00,190
They just went to like organizations,
they went to meetings.

2876
02:44:00,191 --> 02:44:00,770
They wa they,

2877
02:44:00,770 --> 02:44:05,620
they listen to someone speak and then
they got locked into this idea of them

2878
02:44:05,621 --> 02:44:07,180
being a part of this organization.

2879
02:44:07,820 --> 02:44:09,400
Exactly. It's just like
a gang. I mean you,

2880
02:44:09,560 --> 02:44:14,270
I think that we have these romanticized
versions of what the Taliban and al

2881
02:44:14,270 --> 02:44:19,180
Qaeda is. It's just essentially
like a gang and that if you
are, you know, like, uh,

2882
02:44:19,220 --> 02:44:21,530
like a teenager and you're
like living in this area,

2883
02:44:21,531 --> 02:44:24,200
sometimes you are affiliated with a
gang because it's how you use fucking

2884
02:44:24,201 --> 02:44:28,490
survive or it's like how you want to
provide money for your family or you do

2885
02:44:28,491 --> 02:44:31,610
running errands because you don't
want to fucking get killed or beat up.

2886
02:44:32,030 --> 02:44:36,200
So all these loosely affiliated
people with like these organizations,

2887
02:44:36,201 --> 02:44:38,990
quote unquote terrorists organizations,
that was like, they were just swept up.

2888
02:44:38,991 --> 02:44:41,630
And those are the people who are just
killed now with drones and stuff.

2889
02:44:41,631 --> 02:44:42,470
And it just really,

2890
02:44:42,770 --> 02:44:46,580
it's this really bizarre
like interpretation of what
these entities really are

2891
02:44:46,581 --> 02:44:50,240
and how they operate. Um, it's just
like coming from Oakland and like the,

2892
02:44:50,390 --> 02:44:53,760
you know, gangs out in East Oakland. It's
like if you are affiliated with them,

2893
02:44:54,250 --> 02:44:55,460
do deserve to die.
Right.

2894
02:44:56,230 --> 02:44:59,960
And do you think that they can track
those guys that they released the five

2895
02:44:59,961 --> 02:45:02,600
people that they released, do you
think they had some sort of a method?

2896
02:45:02,601 --> 02:45:07,400
Like my dog is a thing they put
under skin, you know, and every,

2897
02:45:07,530 --> 02:45:12,530
if he gets like they take this thing
and if he gets picked up by the pound,

2898
02:45:13,011 --> 02:45:16,460
they run a scan on them and they go,
oh that's Joe's dog.

2899
02:45:16,461 --> 02:45:20,160
And then they can that be, they can call
me, you know, there's like a microchip.

2900
02:45:20,610 --> 02:45:24,530
I would imagine that you could have some
sort of a gps tracking device that you

2901
02:45:24,531 --> 02:45:28,130
could stick in someone's fucking scalp
and they wouldn't even know it's there or

2902
02:45:28,131 --> 02:45:31,430
wherever you know some,
some part of your body.

2903
02:45:31,470 --> 02:45:33,510
Yeah,
he went to Hell knows man.

2904
02:45:33,660 --> 02:45:36,390
I just think these people need to
be let out of prison. It's terrible

2905
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:38,950
to let them out.
They're going to be mad.

2906
02:45:39,910 --> 02:45:42,070
They could cause havoc on us soil

2907
02:45:43,030 --> 02:45:44,350
so far. You know what, man,

2908
02:45:44,351 --> 02:45:47,650
so far there hasn't been
legitimate threat of terrorism.

2909
02:45:47,651 --> 02:45:49,930
If you want to include nine
11 and the Boston bombing,

2910
02:45:49,960 --> 02:45:53,650
other than that zero like
this report just came out,

2911
02:45:53,651 --> 02:45:54,550
we were just talking about this.

2912
02:45:54,551 --> 02:45:58,780
This report just came out that says
every single terrorist plot that's been

2913
02:45:58,781 --> 02:46:02,350
thwarted in the last 12 years has
been completely created by the FBI.

2914
02:46:02,380 --> 02:46:04,300
And this is like mainstream news,
Guardian Independent,

2915
02:46:04,340 --> 02:46:07,090
like all these people picked up on and
explain how that works cause it's really

2916
02:46:07,091 --> 02:46:08,300
fascinating how they do this.

2917
02:46:08,301 --> 02:46:12,710
So right now the FBI has 5,000 informants
working around the clock that are

2918
02:46:12,711 --> 02:46:17,000
getting paid probably like a hundred
gs with taxpayer money just so they can

2919
02:46:17,180 --> 02:46:18,200
facilitate,

2920
02:46:18,410 --> 02:46:22,550
create and then the word terrorist plots
to completely continue to legitimize

2921
02:46:22,551 --> 02:46:25,100
the domestic police
state and the war abroad.

2922
02:46:25,370 --> 02:46:29,930
So these people will go to mosques and
they'll pray really a morally on like

2923
02:46:30,470 --> 02:46:34,970
retarded people or like
mentally incompetent people
were extremely poor people.

2924
02:46:34,970 --> 02:46:35,361
And they'll say,

2925
02:46:35,361 --> 02:46:39,830
yo listen up 250 fucking gs and
they'll work with them for like a year.

2926
02:46:39,831 --> 02:46:43,250
Like we're talking bout like long con.
It was like a long ass cons.

2927
02:46:43,251 --> 02:46:46,040
Sometimes those, think about that
you're getting paid, you know,

2928
02:46:46,041 --> 02:46:49,190
an insane amount of money
to do this on our behalf,

2929
02:46:49,460 --> 02:46:53,150
to basically manipulate people who are
weak minded and to committing acts of

2930
02:46:53,151 --> 02:46:56,240
terrorism that would never have the
capabilities before and would never have

2931
02:46:56,241 --> 02:46:57,140
even thought of it before.

2932
02:46:57,141 --> 02:47:00,830
But they go into these mosques and they
go into all these organizations and

2933
02:47:00,831 --> 02:47:05,450
they're like, Yo, Yo, Yo, like
six months later they'll be
like, okay, well, you know,

2934
02:47:05,451 --> 02:47:07,970
we can talk about how fucked up
the u s government isn't stuff,

2935
02:47:07,971 --> 02:47:09,950
but let's do something about
it, you know? And then like,

2936
02:47:09,951 --> 02:47:13,010
they'll trust these people and then
over time if you're weak enough,

2937
02:47:13,011 --> 02:47:17,330
you'll be like, well fuck,
like, let's do it. You know?
I mean, it's just really sad.

2938
02:47:17,331 --> 02:47:20,750
And to me it's so sick because once they,

2939
02:47:20,751 --> 02:47:24,500
once they Thorte the plot and then they
can parade her on the media and be like,

2940
02:47:24,501 --> 02:47:28,130
Yo, we, uh, we foiled another
terrorist plot. Like, look,

2941
02:47:28,131 --> 02:47:29,600
we're still doing a good job guys,

2942
02:47:29,601 --> 02:47:31,820
but they don't tell you that
they created the terrorists.

2943
02:47:31,821 --> 02:47:33,890
And then of course they put in
prison for the rest of their life.

2944
02:47:33,891 --> 02:47:37,390
So it's another wasted life,
wasted capacity,

2945
02:47:37,400 --> 02:47:41,150
just put in fucking prison and
just keeping up this facade,

2946
02:47:41,180 --> 02:47:45,140
this charade that there's
terrorists everywhere and
that they want to blow us up

2947
02:47:45,141 --> 02:47:48,650
and it's all fucking bullshit, man.
We're more likely to get stung by a bee.

2948
02:47:48,651 --> 02:47:51,470
You were more lucky to get crushed by a
falling in furniture then we are dying

2949
02:47:51,471 --> 02:47:55,990
of a terrorist attack in this
country. We'll definitely, I mean,

2950
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:57,370
I mean dead from it.
These things,

2951
02:47:59,750 --> 02:48:02,060
you're eight times more
likely to be killed by a cop,

2952
02:48:02,090 --> 02:48:06,020
then you are dead from a terrorist here.
So it's just like, it's totally insane.

2953
02:48:06,440 --> 02:48:08,360
And this report just blew the lid off it.

2954
02:48:09,080 --> 02:48:12,230
It was just unbelievable knowing
how much resources are going in.

2955
02:48:12,231 --> 02:48:16,250
And then you see this whole
terror watchlist thing were
1.5 million people have

2956
02:48:16,251 --> 02:48:18,680
been added to a terror watch
list and the last five years,

2957
02:48:18,681 --> 02:48:22,640
just the last five years
alone, 1.5 million. No,

2958
02:48:22,641 --> 02:48:26,720
cause I don't think I would've been
able to fly out here. So I think that,

2959
02:48:26,721 --> 02:48:27,980
but think about,
I mean,

2960
02:48:28,310 --> 02:48:32,000
you're telling me that 1.5 million people
and it's really making their lives a

2961
02:48:32,001 --> 02:48:35,240
living hell because you need flying
is like, you know what I mean?

2962
02:48:35,241 --> 02:48:38,060
And a lot of these people's families
are over and abroad and stuff.

2963
02:48:38,061 --> 02:48:43,061
And what came out on top of that no fly
list thing was that the FBI is actually

2964
02:48:43,551 --> 02:48:46,970
using the no fly list as a tool
to try to get more informants.

2965
02:48:47,150 --> 02:48:51,770
So they will go to like Muslim dudes and
be like, Yo, you're on this no fly list.

2966
02:48:52,160 --> 02:48:55,670
You want to get off it, become an
informant, turn against your community.

2967
02:48:56,720 --> 02:49:00,530
And because the people are saying no,
they're stuck on this list forever.

2968
02:49:00,531 --> 02:49:02,690
So now they're like using it as blackmail.

2969
02:49:03,320 --> 02:49:06,890
So there's like this huge class action
lawsuit trying to do like take these

2970
02:49:06,900 --> 02:49:07,980
people off the list and it's

2971
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:11,520
a, it's a fucking mess, man. It's
a mess. It's a giant industry

2972
02:49:11,940 --> 02:49:15,780
story about the guy in Dallas who was
mentally and competent and they talked

2973
02:49:15,781 --> 02:49:20,010
into a, trying to detonate
a bomb that didn't exist.

2974
02:49:20,011 --> 02:49:24,070
It wasn't a bomb. It was never gonna blow
up. There was no bomb. Uh, they, they,

2975
02:49:24,160 --> 02:49:27,960
they gave him a fake bomb. It's like
they, they talked him into doing it,

2976
02:49:27,961 --> 02:49:29,010
financed the whole thing,

2977
02:49:29,011 --> 02:49:33,660
funded it coerced is poor fuck into
thinking he was going to blow the bomb.

2978
02:49:33,661 --> 02:49:35,760
And then when he tries to do it,
then they swoop in.

2979
02:49:36,030 --> 02:49:38,940
Gotcha. Right handed. Morocco,

2980
02:49:41,190 --> 02:49:44,310
there was even this one dude who worked
at the mosque that actually turned in

2981
02:49:44,311 --> 02:49:46,080
the informant to the FBI
because they were like,

2982
02:49:46,081 --> 02:49:48,770
there's some dude here like trying to
like talk a little shit. They're like,

2983
02:49:48,810 --> 02:49:52,740
oh that kind of backfired on us. We'll
don't worry about it. He's an American.

2984
02:49:52,940 --> 02:49:56,600
What? He's one of us cause you could
America just let him do his thing.

2985
02:49:56,610 --> 02:50:00,180
Let him do his job. He's there
to protect America. Okay.

2986
02:50:01,700 --> 02:50:04,040
It's insane.
It's very bizarre.

2987
02:50:04,080 --> 02:50:08,330
It's very bizarre that they think that
that's somehow or another law enforcement

2988
02:50:08,360 --> 02:50:12,860
or protecting and serving like
it's, this is, it's a loophole.

2989
02:50:12,920 --> 02:50:15,650
It's the DEA uses that loophole to,
there's a,

2990
02:50:15,651 --> 02:50:18,890
there was a rolling stones or a
story about a guy who was a dirty,

2991
02:50:18,891 --> 02:50:21,920
a DEA agent who would do
those sorts of things.

2992
02:50:21,921 --> 02:50:26,921
He would get someone who is
very vulnerable and slowly
but surely talk them into

2993
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:30,290
getting him drugs and then you know,

2994
02:50:30,500 --> 02:50:34,760
connecting them with a much larger drug
dealer wasn't really a drug dealer and

2995
02:50:34,820 --> 02:50:39,820
like organizing and manipulating him
into some situation where he's going to

2996
02:50:40,280 --> 02:50:42,170
show him how to make a fuck load of money,

2997
02:50:42,260 --> 02:50:47,090
but there's no real drugs and so this
guy conspires with them and then they

2998
02:50:47,091 --> 02:50:48,530
fucking,
you're under arrest,

2999
02:50:48,600 --> 02:50:49,433
bye mate.

3000
02:50:50,300 --> 02:50:55,300
[inaudible] Dad.

3001
02:50:55,710 --> 02:50:57,660
I mean you, you, you give
him manipulating people.

3002
02:50:58,030 --> 02:51:01,260
It's totally complete and trap
and it's so wrong. It's so wrong.

3003
02:51:01,261 --> 02:51:04,920
And what's different than actual suicide
bomber recruiters in the Middle East

3004
02:51:04,921 --> 02:51:08,070
that we like condensed. They're
doing the same exact thing. Men,

3005
02:51:08,160 --> 02:51:12,180
while we're doing it for freedom,
we're under the constitution.

3006
02:51:12,630 --> 02:51:15,380
We have laws in this country that we
don't really pay attention to anymore.

3007
02:51:15,850 --> 02:51:18,390
I mean, how much of the
constitution is valid? Yeah.

3008
02:51:18,430 --> 02:51:23,260
After the NDA and you know,
then Patriot Act one and two,

3009
02:51:23,290 --> 02:51:26,200
what's left? We kind of
can do anything, right?

3010
02:51:26,201 --> 02:51:29,170
They can kind of just scoop you up and
lock you up and you don't have to have a

3011
02:51:29,171 --> 02:51:31,690
lawyer. You don't. You'd be,
they can do whatever they

3012
02:51:31,740 --> 02:51:34,620
now they're charging animal
rights activists with terrorism.

3013
02:51:36,060 --> 02:51:39,390
There were these two kids charged with
under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act

3014
02:51:39,391 --> 02:51:39,751
and you're like,

3015
02:51:39,751 --> 02:51:43,740
I don't know if releasing geese from up
farm could be construed as terrorism.

3016
02:51:44,400 --> 02:51:46,980
Well, fog was delicious. Fuck those kids.

3017
02:51:47,850 --> 02:51:51,620
These are comments that a geese try
quite my baby. They're assholes.

3018
02:51:51,621 --> 02:51:54,750
They're disgusting dinosaurs.
All birds are dinosaurs that made it.

3019
02:51:54,860 --> 02:51:56,750
That's what they are now.
They're actually sleep

3020
02:51:56,750 --> 02:51:59,600
thinking that a good percentage
of dinosaurs had feathers.

3021
02:52:00,050 --> 02:52:02,660
They're starting to find that now.
It's really fascinating. Whoa.

3022
02:52:02,661 --> 02:52:06,100
A lot of like raptors, like if they
think a lot of those fucking things had

3023
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:06,791
feathers,
you know what?

3024
02:52:06,791 --> 02:52:10,120
I almost don't like that because now
it's going to make them look silly if we

3025
02:52:10,121 --> 02:52:12,940
like try to re reshape how
they really look for like, oh,

3026
02:52:12,941 --> 02:52:15,190
they don't look scary anymore.
They just like giant Dodo birds.

3027
02:52:15,191 --> 02:52:18,110
That's kind of funny. What kind
of makes sense? Yeah, we'll,

3028
02:52:18,160 --> 02:52:22,180
all the birds that we see today are
essentially dinosaurs that survived.

3029
02:52:22,330 --> 02:52:23,410
That's really what they are.

3030
02:52:23,411 --> 02:52:27,790
We don't really have any ramblers
and especially those, the,

3031
02:52:27,910 --> 02:52:31,960
those types of, you know the
birds with the clause, the talons,

3032
02:52:31,961 --> 02:52:34,300
those weird feet. Yeah.
Chicken. I have chickens.

3033
02:52:34,780 --> 02:52:39,500
I have 24 you have a little
tiny chickens. Yeah. Cool. Yeah.

3034
02:52:39,501 --> 02:52:43,820
I get fresh eggs from him every day, but
they're like, they're like pets. You know,

3035
02:52:44,050 --> 02:52:46,570
there's these weird things
that lay eggs that you eat.

3036
02:52:47,650 --> 02:52:50,920
Go grab and pick them up and they'll
chop their heads off and like rip their

3037
02:52:50,921 --> 02:52:54,790
body apart and eat the meat. No,
but I would, yeah. Shit got crazy.

3038
02:52:55,480 --> 02:52:58,150
24 of them that live off
those for a couple of weeks.

3039
02:53:00,210 --> 02:53:04,000
Horrible Food and 24 if shit got ugly,
I'd eat my dog.

3040
02:53:04,050 --> 02:53:07,960
I'm gonna be honest with you.
Kids are starving when you do.

3041
02:53:07,990 --> 02:53:11,380
I try to look for food,
but you want to see something gross.

3042
02:53:11,381 --> 02:53:13,870
Pull up aerial view factory farms.

3043
02:53:14,320 --> 02:53:17,950
I just want to show you this image that
looks like a festering Zombie wound and

3044
02:53:17,951 --> 02:53:20,560
it was like this photographer
that captured this image of,

3045
02:53:20,561 --> 02:53:21,510
and it's only in the US,

3046
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:24,890
which is really like the craziest
of the factory farming. Um,

3047
02:53:24,910 --> 02:53:27,910
if you go on Google image searches, you
can find it. It looks like a giant green,

3048
02:53:27,911 --> 02:53:32,050
festering wound.
And it's really just like cows.

3049
02:53:33,040 --> 02:53:36,460
I Dunno, like millions of cows and
middle America and all of their waists,

3050
02:53:36,461 --> 02:53:40,870
like accumulating it. This lagoon.
It's fucking nuts. There's one of them.

3051
02:53:41,400 --> 02:53:45,730
And if you yeah, if you enlarge
that, has that, see all those dots.

3052
02:53:46,060 --> 02:53:49,480
Those are all cows to the
left. What? And those lots.

3053
02:53:49,481 --> 02:53:53,800
And that's all like the way,
that's all cow shit.

3054
02:53:54,010 --> 02:53:57,190
I don't know what it is, man. That's a
satellite image. I don't know what it is,

3055
02:53:57,191 --> 02:54:01,590
but east lagoon at Coronado feeders
in Texas, find the green one too.

3056
02:54:01,591 --> 02:54:06,270
I'm whoa. And unfortunately, um, there's
a lot of activists who, you know,

3057
02:54:06,280 --> 02:54:09,280
a lot of like animal rights activists
like my friend will potter look at that.

3058
02:54:09,340 --> 02:54:13,870
Isn't that nuts? Oh, what
is this? What does it say?

3059
02:54:13,871 --> 02:54:15,580
In a caption that it looks big.

3060
02:54:15,850 --> 02:54:19,300
That's huge waste lagoon in Texas.

3061
02:54:22,270 --> 02:54:26,400
We were wasting no something nuclear waste
site. No, no. It's just making it, yeah.

3062
02:54:26,900 --> 02:54:30,100
Yeah. It's comparing it to how gross
it looks, but there's all these,

3063
02:54:30,160 --> 02:54:32,680
there's these laws now called ag gag laws.

3064
02:54:33,010 --> 02:54:37,690
You can't even can't take photos of them.
If you see the Tortuga Charles. Yeah,

3065
02:54:37,691 --> 02:54:42,040
you get charged with terrorism. I'm
not aware of that. If you find that,

3066
02:54:42,041 --> 02:54:44,350
I mean look,
what they do is horrifying.

3067
02:54:44,650 --> 02:54:48,490
They chop their chickens beaks off when
they're little to keep them from pecking

3068
02:54:48,491 --> 02:54:50,230
each other because they're
in such close quarters.

3069
02:54:50,231 --> 02:54:54,220
They attack each other and it's a
disaster. The factory farming is horrific.

3070
02:54:54,280 --> 02:54:54,871
Terrible.

3071
02:54:54,871 --> 02:54:57,910
It's one of the reasons I've tried to
separate myself from that as much as

3072
02:54:57,911 --> 02:55:02,800
humanly possible. I, like I said, raise
my own chickens. Awesome. I hunt now.

3073
02:55:02,830 --> 02:55:04,340
I count of killed for

3074
02:55:04,340 --> 02:55:08,840
animals this year. Like dismantle
the whole thing too. That's cool.

3075
02:55:08,930 --> 02:55:13,160
You have a freezer full of meat and I eat
that and my goal is by the end of 2014

3076
02:55:13,161 --> 02:55:17,090
to only eat meat that I've hunted.
I'm like, Shit, where are you hunting?

3077
02:55:17,180 --> 02:55:21,740
I go on trips. Wow. Yeah.
That killed that deer. No Way.

3078
02:55:21,860 --> 02:55:26,240
The one that right there,
the hoods. Oh yeah. Crazy.
That's pretty bad ass. I mean,

3079
02:55:26,241 --> 02:55:29,480
if everyone knew where,
how food was made and where it came from,

3080
02:55:29,481 --> 02:55:31,100
I think that we'd eat a lot differently.

3081
02:55:31,101 --> 02:55:33,530
And I think people would view food
a lot differently. It just like,

3082
02:55:33,620 --> 02:55:37,220
we're so removed from the process of
food, which is really crazy. Yeah.

3083
02:55:37,221 --> 02:55:40,730
Well when you see it in the wild
and you shoot it yourself, I mean,

3084
02:55:40,731 --> 02:55:42,680
that's an animal.
That deer,

3085
02:55:42,740 --> 02:55:47,540
that was an animal that I got in Montana
that probably had never seen a person

3086
02:55:47,541 --> 02:55:51,620
before. Right. Because it was in the
badlands that was off the Missouri River.

3087
02:55:51,650 --> 02:55:56,390
The same place where Lewis
and Clark, uh, traveled. Wow.
Yeah. I mean, this is a very,

3088
02:55:56,391 --> 02:56:00,950
very remote place. There's no cell
phone reception. No nothing. Yeah,

3089
02:56:00,951 --> 02:56:04,580
it's pretty dope. It's cool animal
too. And it tasted delicious.

3090
02:56:05,060 --> 02:56:09,440
No hormones, no antibiotics, no
nitrates. And we're out of time. No,

3091
02:56:09,500 --> 02:56:13,290
Abby Martin, you're the shit. We did
three hours. Wow. There's so much.

3092
02:56:13,840 --> 02:56:17,480
We'll turn into a pumpkin. Someone want
to talk about, tell him anytime, anytime.

3093
02:56:17,900 --> 02:56:20,690
Like I said, I'll open this fucker up
at four o'clock in the morning for you.

3094
02:56:20,780 --> 02:56:24,620
Fuck you. Thanks so much.
