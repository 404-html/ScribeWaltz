1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,081
Try my day.

2
00:00:01,081 --> 00:00:03,750
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,510
So a UFC two oh seven
that was one of the crick.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
One of the craziest events of all
time and watching that main event was,

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,980
it was like there was,

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,761
it was surreal.

7
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:18,101
First of all,

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,050
it's surreal because I was,

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,910
my body was all weirded out because I was,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,920
it was a little out of it,

11
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,803
about the past,

12
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,990
about the shit all over my chair.

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,011
But it was also,

14
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:31,011
it was just like that was the least
competitive like main event other than

15
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,530
although in Mcgregor,

16
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:37,620
but that was one dynamic shot
to the Chin and knocked him out.

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,470
Like everything about that was off kick.

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,190
Can you knit,

19
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,500
can you think about another main event,

20
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,240
championship level where it was
that kind of big of a discrepancy?

21
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:48,751
You know what I'm saying?

22
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:50,940
Like it was even a fight and I,

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,290
and I think leading up to it,

24
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,950
there was some kind of red flags
that you saw leading up to it.

25
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,670
If you think back now that we can shape
though everybody said right physically,

26
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,533
physically,

27
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,523
physically.

28
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,350
She looked great but like what's,

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,820
what kind of sparring was she doing?

30
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:05,971
You know,

31
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:07,890
one of the things I was thinking
when she was hitting pads,

32
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,750
she's standing there
hitting pads with Edmond.

33
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,291
I was like,

34
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,850
they're standing right
in front of each other.

35
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,250
Like she's not moving like
she's just hitting pads,

36
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:14,461
pop,

37
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:14,611
pop,

38
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:14,731
pop,

39
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:14,881
pop,

40
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:15,091
pop,

41
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:15,421
pop up.

42
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:16,500
Ads are tough to tell though,

43
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:16,760
right?

44
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,180
Because sometimes the
do it for the camera.

45
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:20,340
If the countdown cruiser and you
don't want to show your new shit,

46
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,040
but also what did people
think was going to happen?

47
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,770
Like did you think this whole time
when she's shooting these movies,

48
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:30,771
doing Suzie admin her come up with a
plan for her to stick on the outside jab

49
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:31,290
and move.

50
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:31,800
That's not,

51
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,760
that's not in her DNA.

52
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,623
That's person.

53
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,350
Anyway.

54
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,180
She had to close the distance and clinch,

55
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:36,901
you know,

56
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:38,130
I should have been the only plant.

57
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,950
The idea of standing with
Amanda Nunez is just ridiculous.

58
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,500
The difference in punching
power is like literally double,

59
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,480
but we've seen her fight they punches
before who batch could hit pretty hard.

60
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,340
I'm not saying similar but no,

61
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:52,290
I'm saying what batch did she,

62
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,760
she was a,

63
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,680
has decent to power and
she's a very aggressive,

64
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,170
she throws volume strikes
but she throws her arms.

65
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,900
She doesn't hit nearly as hard as Amanda,

66
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,330
Amanda torques or whole body in the shit.

67
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,020
I agree Jo.

68
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,450
I mean it's,

69
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:04,810
it's,

70
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,810
it's an batches arms for this long is
fine and Dan got damn telephone poles and

71
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:11,640
that's all fine.

72
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,200
But don't you think the game plan should
have been get her to the ground and she

73
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,830
tried that a little bit.

74
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:18,180
She didn't,

75
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,260
she was already lit up.

76
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,400
She wasn't there though.

77
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:20,900
Mentally.

78
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,631
That's what I'm saying.

79
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:21,841
There's,

80
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,200
there's things leading up to it and I
think the biggest red red flag for me,

81
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,150
and you know Dana better than anyone,

82
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,940
he's a promoter through
and through one of the,

83
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,230
if not the best of all time.

84
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,041
I can't think of another one.

85
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:32,910
Don King I guess,

86
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:34,980
but still for him to say,

87
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,401
yeah,

88
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:38,400
you can skip all the media shit
and just focus on the fight.

89
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:38,970
I was like,

90
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,271
God,

91
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:40,680
that just doesn't seem right.

92
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:43,020
You know why she's managed by,

93
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:48,021
or she's handled by William
Morris Endeavor WME cause
WME owns UFC now I'm aware

94
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:48,601
of.

95
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,530
I'm sure that's what,

96
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,450
that's the only way I was his decision.

97
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,313
It was his decision.

98
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:52,650
He was,

99
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,580
I'm the one who led,

100
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,810
we agreed to this.

101
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,950
It was in her contract.

102
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:57,330
It's a one time thing
I'm never doing again.

103
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:57,631
I thought,

104
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:58,291
God damn,

105
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,040
that is so she put it in the contract.

106
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,873
She must have said,

107
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,900
this is what I want to do.

108
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,340
I don't want to talk to any media.

109
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,380
I just want to go out and
try the red flag to you.

110
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,700
Not Have Connor did it.

111
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,381
I mean,

112
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:09,700
Connor doesn't have the choice coming.

113
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,871
Connor did it,

114
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:11,710
but if Connor did it,

115
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,544
if Connor said,

116
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,350
fuck all this fucking media,

117
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,590
I'm going to Dublin,

118
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,750
I'm going to train.

119
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,920
He would never do that.

120
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,731
If he did,

121
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,321
I'd have Z.

122
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:22,360
It's a proper red flagged out
to anyone involved at all.

123
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,110
Dana,

124
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,580
this say it's all good.

125
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,170
[inaudible] here's the thing,

126
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:26,921
she goes out,

127
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:27,491
she goes out,

128
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,181
grabs hold of men,

129
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:28,780
Nunez,

130
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,890
flips her on her head,

131
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,140
semi unconscious catches
her in the arm bar.

132
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,330
She's the new champion.

133
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,121
35 seconds.

134
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:35,140
You're not saying this.

135
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,063
I disagree.

136
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,911
No,

137
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:38,170
you wouldn't say there's a red flag.

138
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:40,660
If she went out and dominated and he'd
got an arm bar in the first round,

139
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:43,300
you would definitely not say skip
skipping the media as a red flag.

140
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,480
So then she only saying it because
this is like armchair quarterbacking.

141
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,291
It's not though,

142
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:51,010
because I said it's a red flag
before this because if she,

143
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,020
so if she did interviews afterwards,

144
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,510
let's say she went out
there dominator in a minute,

145
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,460
submitter and then shoot
interviews afterwards,

146
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,480
that's a little different.

147
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,763
You know what I'm saying?

148
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,020
Cause she just saying I'm
not doing any meat at all.

149
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,730
Even posts posts.

150
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,210
Yeah.

151
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,920
Well she doesn't want to talk after that.

152
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,110
I mean why would you want
to tell him the other thing,

153
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,430
the whole cell on this,

154
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:10,660
was she serious?

155
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:11,830
Now she's saying,

156
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,640
oh my God,

157
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,060
she's focused knowing her as you
serious now with the whole thing,

158
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,880
the whole thing was like this big
obvious marketing perspective.

159
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:23,200
Like a promotional Hollywood perspective.

160
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,220
Like they had the movie which is a really
good like got you pumped up like that

161
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:30,420
whole thing about her coming back and
they lift up the garage door [inaudible]

162
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,240
working out really hard and it's they,

163
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:34,930
what they did is they
created a great hype piece.

164
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,930
You know if you're in the
Ronda Rousey business.

165
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:38,471
Exactly.

166
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:42,670
Amanda Nunez going exactly
the best was the best.

167
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:46,120
Was there a picture promoting this UFC
and there's a picture of Ronda and her

168
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:49,460
fight care and Rhonda in the street
clothes cause she's back two oh seven it's

169
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,800
like fuck man.

170
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:53,470
What about Amanda and
when I say this crazy,

171
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,030
make sure who did that picture that he
was at an official UFC picture official

172
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,010
UFC kind of a social media post.

173
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,730
Wow.

174
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,650
It's crazy man.

175
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,680
Cause now what do you do?

176
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,950
It's also crazy because it's
crazy for a marketing perspective.

177
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:06,311
I mean,

178
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:09,070
a lot of people thought that Rhonda
was going to win a lot of people.

179
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,730
I was 100% who the fuck knows me too.

180
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,910
That's exactly how I felt when I
was watching that fight play out.

181
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:16,301
I was like,

182
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:17,560
who the fuck knows?

183
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,150
I mean you could see,

184
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,660
look,

185
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,490
Rhonda looked like she
was in amazing shape.

186
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,640
You think about the things that Ron
has been able to do in the past to like

187
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:25,510
Sarah McMahon.

188
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,381
You would think,

189
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:29,710
well maybe she ties her up in a clinch
blasts or with a knee to the body,

190
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,330
flips her on her back and arm bars are,

191
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,820
who the fuck knows if she
gets you on the ground?

192
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,890
Her arm bar technique is outstanding.

193
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,150
It's just what some of the best,

194
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,080
if not the best I've ever
scene that could have happened,

195
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,760
but it was so who the fuck knows?

196
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,290
But the moment she got hit,

197
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,270
she's not moving her head at all.

198
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,290
She's standing straight up in the air and
then I see her legs get close together

199
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,190
and that's when you know someone's really
hurt when someone gets lit up and then

200
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:54,971
they start moving,

201
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,040
but their legs are too close together.

202
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,700
She's not working right.

203
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,030
It's not like they,

204
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:01,430
they kind of know what to do,

205
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:02,780
but it's just not,

206
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,700
they're not their balances and good.

207
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,930
There was no head movement.

208
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,130
She was probably hurt with like the
second or third punch that Amanda hit her

209
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:10,321
with.

210
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:11,450
She was probably on Queer Street.

211
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,980
That's a woke her up.

212
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,170
She didn't know where
she was until she got it.

213
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:15,980
Joe,

214
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,150
look at that when she got hit.

215
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:17,500
When you go,

216
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:17,901
Ooh,

217
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:18,410
she's hurt.

218
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,243
She's hurt.

219
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,700
Look at her face and you
even said it yourself.

220
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,660
She drew up a kick.

221
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,450
She threw some kicks to
try to keep Amanda off.

222
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,770
I think she didn't realize.

223
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,210
I think when Amanda Hits Girls,

224
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:29,661
they just go,

225
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,160
Holy Shit.

226
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:31,580
Yup,

227
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,361
but what else would you,

228
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:33,920
what else would you expect in that?

229
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:34,371
You know what I'm saying?

230
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:34,701
Like you,

231
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:35,900
you don't realize till you get hit,

232
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:37,210
but you,

233
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,870
you hear all the criticism now of,

234
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,710
uh,

235
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,630
Edmond who's obviously a terrible coach,

236
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:42,530
but take that out of it.

237
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:42,960
If,

238
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,160
if,

239
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,990
if you bring a horse to
water and they can't drink,

240
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,310
there's nothing else you can do.

241
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,960
So if mentally she doesn't
want to be in there,

242
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,630
do you think weight didn't
want to be in there?

243
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,860
Uh,

244
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,480
did they say that it didn't look like the
same tenacity that were used to seeing

245
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:55,741
chill?

246
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:57,830
It's super tenacious
until she got cracked.

247
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,470
Joe Is 44 seconds.

248
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,633
Snapchat,

249
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,000
that First Jab,

250
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,940
she got hurt with a right hand.

251
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:04,820
May Be 10 50.

252
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:06,500
We didn't watch the whole fight fight.

253
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,030
It's 40 seconds.

254
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,720
Go fight.

255
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,051
You could,

256
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:09,620
uh,

257
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,453
it's on youtube.

258
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,181
It's everywhere.

259
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:11,820
As a matter.

260
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,030
I mean,

261
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,863
you know what I mean?

262
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,690
Tough fighters before.

263
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,770
Like what do you think it is?

264
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,760
I don't understand why.

265
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,690
Why are you even saying this?

266
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,640
You see that she got hit and you,

267
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:19,850
she,

268
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,490
she got hurt and you've
been hitting hurt before.

269
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,760
Who Know what happens?

270
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:24,260
You just don't know what
the fuck's going on.

271
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,640
Correct.

272
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,893
However,

273
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,270
I don't think that jab put her lights out.

274
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,380
It wasn't just a jab dude.

275
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:33,820
She hit her with a refresh jab that
landed the first time she went into Cape

276
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:34,320
close desk.

277
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,420
First Jab landed,

278
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,100
but then she got hit with many punches.

279
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:40,040
I don't understand why you're
confused as to the result.

280
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,240
I mean she got hit by the biggest
power punch her in the hundred 35 pound

281
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:45,110
division by far.

282
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,870
There's not a single girl in that
division that punches like Amanda does.

283
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,891
I agree with that,

284
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:49,540
but not right.

285
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,020
It wasn't a right hand right away.

286
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,740
Yes it was.

287
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,910
It was a jab right away.

288
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,100
Right hand right after that.

289
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:55,790
Once,

290
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,960
once run to try to close distance was
40 seconds of Amanda Punching Rhonda in

291
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,690
the face until Rhonda would
out like the idea that some,

292
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,780
something's confusing that she didn't
look like she wanted to be there.

293
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,060
She was hurt multiple times.

294
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:09,290
Now in those exchanges,

295
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:09,950
I just don't,

296
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,110
I think we're doing a lot
of arm chair quarterbacking.

297
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,470
Right.

298
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,760
Who the fuck knows what was going on?

299
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,080
You know what?

300
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,320
You're speculating whether or not you
wanted to be there after she got hit.

301
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,110
The problem is she
might've been just rocked.

302
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,090
And there's also the reality that she
was knocked out fucking cold a year ago

303
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,770
and it was a bad beating and then a
vicious head kick and there is something

304
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,600
about those goddamn neck kicks,

305
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:33,260
man.

306
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,480
There's something about when we,

307
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,440
when someone shins you in the neck,

308
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,320
like she got shin and your
whole body just goes limp.

309
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,380
You're doing so much damage in there.

310
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,180
But she had a 411 days off.

311
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,110
That's nice.

312
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,520
I think it was just bad strategy.

313
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,630
It's really simple.

314
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,520
The strategy was not good.

315
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,460
Amanda's just best as
possible to all those things.

316
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:52,730
Look,

317
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,680
I was the one who said like way early on,

318
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,170
I think Amanda's are most dangerous
challenge cause a man to hits so fucking

319
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,460
hard after she starts,

320
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,990
Sara Mcmann and uh,

321
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:01,321
when she,

322
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:03,880
when she was beaten up me
shows like Jesus Christ,

323
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,420
she punches harder than
anybody in that division.

324
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,850
She's got like dangerous
weapons with her hands.

325
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,013
But I think,

326
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,870
I really think there's a lot of people
that get CalEd like that and they are

327
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:13,860
never the same again.

328
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,970
I agree that they can't absorb a shot
anymore and then also in your brain

329
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,290
according to chocolate down.

330
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,850
And he was telling me about it like,

331
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,301
because he,

332
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:21,541
you know,

333
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,980
chuck was so tough that he would like
just fucking use his chin sorta like

334
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:26,641
Lineker does.

335
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:28,020
Like it's part of his defense,

336
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,100
like knowing that he can absorb shots
and after a while his brain was like,

337
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:32,640
hey man,

338
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,600
fuck you.

339
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,250
Like his brain was just like,

340
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:36,860
we're not going to do this
and just cause your shit.

341
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,231
Yeah,

342
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:38,190
just shuts off early.

343
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,053
I also think tech,

344
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,660
there's a certain level where they're,

345
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,250
where they're that great and you look
at like a tiger woods and Mike Tyson.

346
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,250
When that foundation gets a little shaky,

347
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,360
there's just never the same.

348
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:48,720
Yeah,

349
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,100
that's true.

350
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,621
It's just never,

351
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:50,130
they're like,

352
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,810
I'm not God's gift to the Eoc.

353
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,090
Exactly know them and we
gods don't give a shit.

354
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,690
Exactly.

355
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,500
And then like we said,

356
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,540
even if she was undefeated
and she saw it fought,

357
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,690
Nunez Nunez going to give her a problems
because if you watch like the Misha

358
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,480
Tate fight Meisha Tate like
even though she beat me,

359
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:04,500
she tight twice.

360
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:04,951
Me,

361
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:05,341
she'd take,

362
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:06,300
gave her a hard time.

363
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,550
There's some good scrambles.

364
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,970
Beach Dade hit her with some punches.

365
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,610
If Amanda Hits You with punches like that,

366
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,241
you're fuck,

367
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:13,740
you can't make mistakes.

368
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,370
You're in trouble.

369
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:14,670
Yeah.

370
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,121
She's like,

371
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:15,300
oh,

372
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,900
like in a lot of ways she's like a female
rumble in that she might not be able

373
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:21,720
to close this show with
one shot like rumble Ken.

374
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,310
But if you make mistakes,

375
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,450
you get stung so bad and you
see it with Sara McMann fights.

376
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,380
A perfect example,

377
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,320
she cracked Sarah with a right hand.

378
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,050
You see her.

379
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,010
Her whole face is like,

380
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:34,680
what the like nobody hits them like that.

381
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,600
Nobody and she's long a man that catches
you on the end of those punches too.

382
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,140
She,

383
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,310
she's great at distance.

384
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:46,311
I also think that the game's
evolving so fast where Amanda,

385
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:47,970
all she cares about is being champ.

386
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
All she does is train.

387
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:51,180
That's the only thing she gives a fuck up.

388
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,790
I think we saw the same
thing in the Dominick Cruz,

389
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,360
uh,

390
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,380
Cody Garbrandt fight.

391
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,120
All Cody wants to do is be champ.

392
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,680
Dominic's doing analyst's work he is for.

393
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,020
So I think there's,

394
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,740
there's this kind of change of hands
right now where you're seeing these guys

395
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:05,790
who were there all in.

396
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,550
And that's what you have to do to
be in this game this day and age.

397
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,170
Guys are too good there too.

398
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:10,351
Good.

399
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:11,280
And I think you're dead right.

400
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,690
I think you're dead right about that.

401
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:12,961
Oh,

402
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:13,351
here we go.

403
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,820
We'll watch the whole thing live now.

404
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,340
Give us a volume young Jamie.

405
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:18,870
So here it is.

406
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,760
So that jab landed with five seconds.

407
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,810
Jab right there.

408
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,840
Watch says she's down there.

409
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:25,674
Right there.

410
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:27,301
Yeah.

411
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:27,571
See,

412
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:28,381
so she stung.

413
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:29,280
10 seconds in.

414
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,450
We're at four 43 were 15 seconds
in and she's already got,

415
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,780
she's fucked right there.

416
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:34,470
She's fuck.

417
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,240
That was a super hard right hand.

418
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,860
And this is bad.

419
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,000
It's hard to watch.

420
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,700
It's real hard to watch
a boom to the body,

421
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,320
to she rip that shot to the body.

422
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,520
So like the idea that she didn't want
to be there 10 seconds into the fight.

423
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:48,960
She didn't know what the fuck was going.

424
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,411
Oh,

425
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,840
they're left to the right hand
in that right hand behind it.

426
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,710
This is horrific,

427
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:54,544
man.

428
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,200
It's tough.

429
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,701
A lunch,

430
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:55,911
boom,

431
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:56,744
boom.

432
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,140
God Damn.

433
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,640
Stop touching my herb.

434
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,680
Great stoppage.

435
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,640
But God damn Amanda Nunez as good.

436
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,140
She put a finger up to her mouth,

437
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,820
walked right up to Edmond,

438
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,730
looked in him when show gangster shit.

439
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,883
Well,

440
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:14,860
heart,

441
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,970
she's in another dimension.

442
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,320
There's no doubt about it.

443
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:17,970
She's got the,

444
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,671
you just know about.

445
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:19,390
She's tough.

446
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,300
And also she's got that thick
old neck that helps to go long.

447
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:23,170
Amanda's arms.

448
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,271
Yes.

449
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:26,170
She's great at keeping distance
and not crowding herself.

450
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:26,320
Well,

451
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,350
Amanda has a wide shoulders
and that helps too.

452
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:30,850
And then long arms as well.

453
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,890
And she's got awesome distance,

454
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:33,161
man.

455
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:33,580
Her,

456
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,200
her ability to catch you at the very
back of the punches were all the power is

457
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,620
because if you're punching someone
and you want to hit them here,

458
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:43,480
but they just move forward a foot,

459
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,230
you lose.

460
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,760
You lose like 90% of your power.

461
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,340
Yeah.
