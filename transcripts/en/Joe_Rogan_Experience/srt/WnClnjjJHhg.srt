1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,750
Five four,
three,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,100
two,
one.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,430
Donny Vincent,
what's going on?

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,690
How are you buddy?
Good.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,880
I look good.
Very excited that you didn't know about

6
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:14,280
floating at all.
He didn't know about float tanks even

7
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,050
remotely until you came here.
Yeah.

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,180
And it's wicked looking.
It's fun,

9
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:19,740
man.
If you've got time after the show,

10
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:21,990
you can float.
If you want to do it,

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,630
I might have to do it just to say that
I've done it.

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,920
But yeah,
I,

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,400
I didn't know the science behind it
other than obviously floating right.

14
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,450
Would be,
you know,

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,150
just feels good just to meditate and
just to sit there in a quiet,

16
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:36,931
like,
you know,

17
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:38,340
when you,
when you're a little kid and you go on a

18
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:40,680
swimming pool or something,
you put your ears just under the water

19
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,660
and you get that kind of,
yeah.

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,090
When everything's just peaceful and you
can just sit there and you can't hear

21
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:47,160
your mother or you can't hear your
girlfriend or whatever and it's just

22
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:47,730
quiet.

23
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,140
I assume.
It's a lot like that.

24
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,970
It's very telling me,
he said to women,

25
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,190
you didn't say your dad,
you didn't see your grandpa.

26
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,840
My Dad never talked to me.
And maybe that's a whole nother subject.

27
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,480
That's another part of the problem
probably.

28
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,783
But uh,
yeah,

29
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,330
I am trying to get floating spread
across where like this is the best way

30
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,300
for people to relax.
It does nothing like it because first of

31
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:09,960
all physically you're relaxed because
the water has so much epson salts in it

32
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:11,910
and you know,
it's just really good for your muscles.

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,570
It's good for sore,
you know,

34
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,560
anything.
Sore muscles overworked.

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,710
It's great for that.
But it's also great in the environment

36
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,220
where you,
you were in that tank with total

37
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:24,810
darkness,
total silence.

38
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,410
It's pitch black in there.
You close the door,

39
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,210
you don't see a ray of light and then
your ears are underwater.

40
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,850
And then I have to get some earplugs for
guests.

41
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,520
I don't mind having the,
the,

42
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,530
the salt in my ears,
but some people get a little weirded out

43
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:42,540
by the salt in there.
Do we have as women that,

44
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:43,850
yeah.
Did I buy,

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,240
I bought a big thing of it.
I did.

46
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,120
My memory's fucked up dude.
What's wrong with me?

47
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,760
Um,
about all giant jug of it.

48
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:52,410
Right?
But,

49
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:54,780
uh,
the other thing is that it just gives

50
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,640
you a lone time in a way that you don't
ever get when you're floating in there.

51
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,330
You're not thinking about your body,
you know,

52
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:01,530
thinking about anything.
You're just,

53
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,710
you're just floating and then it's just
very peaceful,

54
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,790
just a little bit.
What makes you,

55
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,210
you,
you have a real moment to consider

56
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,490
things.
I've had made some of my best decisions

57
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:14,250
in that thing and I don't think,
I mean obviously we all know the rat

58
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:14,970
race right now.

59
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,080
None of us.
I mean it's,

60
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,510
it's why I go to the mountains.
It's the same thing.

61
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,620
Like they're just sitting there and
peace in my mind has been doing this for

62
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:24,690
years where,
um,

63
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,630
early on in and when I would,
when I'm going in the Arctic,

64
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:29,550
or early on when I'd go into the
mountains or something like that,

65
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,040
everything was frantic.
Like I had to do things really quickly.

66
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,440
I wanted to cover a lot of ground.
I wanted to,

67
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,820
everything,
packing,

68
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,740
moving,
everything was so frantic.

69
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:41,790
And then when I started realizing that
if I would just stop and slow down and

70
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,340
look at the very tiniest details around
me,

71
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,120
no matter where I was or who I was with,
then I started having a great

72
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:52,680
appreciation of my presence.
So I'm sure something like that is just

73
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,720
because of the darkness and because of
the floating,

74
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:59,721
it's just hyper extended into that
presence of you can trick yourself into

75
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,460
thinking that nothing else is going on
in your life.

76
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:04,691
Yeah,
no,

77
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:08,080
I agree with you.
I think that we take this attitude that

78
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:12,040
we have in the city when you're dealing
with traffic and massive amounts of

79
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,610
people and you sort of have that same
momentum when you go into the mountains

80
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,860
and if you do do that,
you're not going to appreciate it the

81
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:18,850
same way.
Yeah,

82
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,960
for sure.
Look around.

83
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,810
Yeah,
I did that for a few years.

84
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,960
I would go,
I thought I had to accomplish something.

85
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,010
So I'd go to site a and hunt there then
and I tried to,

86
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,260
as horrible as the sentences to say,
I tried to kill as fast as I could so I

87
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:37,330
could get out of there and go to site B
and sight see.

88
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:39,490
And then I started realizing,
I actually had a friend of mine,

89
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:39,941
he's like,
man,

90
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:42,040
I think you're,
I think you're hunting too much.

91
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,870
I think this is going to catch up with
you and you're going to,

92
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,690
the experience is going to start to
degrade for you.

93
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,160
But it was,
it was almost like I was trying to

94
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:52,930
accomplish really fast goals and when I
started slowing that down and saying,

95
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,130
hey,
I don't want to go to the Arctic for

96
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:58,000
seven days and try to knock all of these
things off my list in seven days.

97
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,420
I want to go to the Arctic for 30 days
and now let the Arctic come to me.

98
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,120
Let Let.
Now I just want to sit still and be

99
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,580
quiet and not,
not chase the Arctic down,

100
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,950
but I want it just now.
I want it to come to me.

101
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,170
Well I think people for the La people
who don't have any experience in the

102
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:21,520
outdoors and certainly people who don't
hunt don't understand it and their

103
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:25,240
version of it they're getting either
from movies were hunters are always

104
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,080
portrayed as villains or they're getting
it from these outdoor TV shows,

105
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,410
which I don't think a good do a good job
of representing what it actually is.

106
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,420
Even the really good ones like Rinella
show,

107
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,220
which I think is the best show out
there,

108
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,670
it's still 22 minutes with commercials
and I just don't think that you get a

109
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:45,220
real sense of what it's like what I
think you did.

110
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,340
That's really interesting and one of the
reasons why I wanted to have you on.

111
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:52,990
As you're doing films,
like you're doing an hour long film

112
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,230
about a hunt and in that you really get
an understanding of the environment.

113
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:02,750
You take great shots or whoever your
camera man is great shots of being a

114
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,860
fireman and closeups on leaves floating
down a river and you just get,

115
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:10,960
you get a real sense of it,
which is missing.

116
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,100
And it's,
it's still,

117
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:14,470
you're still getting a blink of Oh,
you know,

118
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,110
multiple weeks in the wilderness.
Yup.

119
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,360
But you at least,
you get a feel like,

120
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,900
oh,
this is something very different than

121
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,010
what's being portrayed.

122
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:29,010
This is like this intense,
almost spiritual experience in this very

123
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:32,890
bizarre environment that surrounds
civilization.

124
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,750
And we think of it,
you know,

125
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,690
in these weird terms.
But when you're out there in it,

126
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,840
it's very difficult to capture what
that's like.

127
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,880
And I think you've done an amazing job
at doing that.

128
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:45,450
And here's,
Jamie's put some of your stuff up online

129
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,660
here.
We get a chance to see it.

130
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:47,700
But,
and I,

131
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,990
and I appreciate that it's um,
hunting.

132
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,580
It drives me nuts.
Go ahead.

133
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,451
No,
no,

134
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,530
I'm just,
I'm just going to say,

135
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:55,750
I mean,
whoever's doing your editing,

136
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,890
kyle,
he's fantastic.

137
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,880
Yeah,
he's really talented.

138
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,860
He does a really,
really good job of,

139
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:06,080
of just picking good shots.
And just the overall experience is

140
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:08,990
relayed very well.
Like you get a chance to see like,

141
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,471
oh,
this,

142
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:13,040
this is an adventure.
This isn't just as simple as,

143
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,870
you know,
someone's going out there trying to fill

144
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:16,730
a freezer with wild game meat.
No,

145
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:18,350
you're,
you're on an adventure.

146
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,450
And then the wild game meat is a part of
it.

147
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah.
It's all apps.

148
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,330
A lot of shit going on.
And this was,

149
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,980
this piece right here was specifically

150
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,460
don for Nat Geo because they have,
um,

151
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,220
the National Geographic Society,
which is the magazine.

152
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,950
And then they have national geographic,
which is the TV show.

153
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,180
And so they wanted to do,
they hit me up for a bunch of TV shows.

154
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:42,930
They wanted me to come and find bigfoot.
They wanted me to,

155
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,490
I,
yeah,

156
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,710
they call the fuck are,
they called me for everything.

157
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,390
They would call me and say,
ah,

158
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,660
we're,
we're,

159
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,850
we're,
where are you right now?

160
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:52,200
Where are,
where's your cabin?

161
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,330
And I'd say,
I don't have a cabin.

162
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,181
And they say,
well,

163
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,240
our,
I'm surely you're skinning a beaver out

164
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:58,260
right now.
I said,

165
00:06:58,261 --> 00:06:58,621
no,
no,

166
00:06:58,621 --> 00:06:59,760
no.
I live in Wisconsin.

167
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:03,930
Just taught in Minneapolis and I'm
walking my labrador down the street in

168
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:05,910
shorts and,
and um,

169
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,991
and so they said,
well,

170
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:08,910
they,
they really want to do a TV show.

171
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,560
And they wanted it to encapsulate
hunting to some degree.

172
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,590
But the society,
the magazine was against hunting.

173
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,950
The TV show would allow it.
So they wanted me to do a no bullshit a

174
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:27,420
sermon if you will download looking down
the barrel of the camera and just said,

175
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,820
this isn't going to go public.
This,

176
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,230
this doesn't have to be pretty,
it's not going to be edited well,

177
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,500
but just please tell us why you hunt.
W try to explain it so that we can bring

178
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:39,810
it to our producers and saying like,
this is why he hunts.

179
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:42,900
And so I did this,
had my little temper tantrum there.

180
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,470
And um,
and in doing it realized like,

181
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:48,810
it made me really question,
you know,

182
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:49,471
I'd say,
okay,

183
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:53,070
so you want to know why I hunt?
And then it made me take a step back and

184
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:55,470
say,
man,

185
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:57,030
for the love of God,
I really don't even know.

186
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,770
I don't know why I hunt,
but I can explain some of the areas.

187
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,190
It doesn't explain why I'm a hunter.
It doesn't explain exactly why a hunt,

188
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:10,191
but I can tell you I love the adventure.
I can tell you I love the really clean

189
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:14,580
protein that I get for me and my family.
I can tell you that our ancestry

190
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,700
unequivocally comes from 100% groups of
hunters and gatherers that's around the

191
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:22,170
world.
I can tell you all of these points.

192
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,430
I can tell you that I love seeing
antlers of all sizes and and the hides,

193
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:29,310
and I can tell you I love watching
grizzly bears eat blueberries and

194
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,890
watching salmon come up a river to
spawn.

195
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:36,150
I can tell you all of these things,
but I don't know if all of those things

196
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:39,210
make me a hunter or if I'm just
experiencing all those things because I

197
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:41,970
am a hunter.
It's just very difficult to articulate.

198
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,870
It's very difficult to articulate how
much you love something,

199
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,430
yet you're willing to engage it in such
a heavy way,

200
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,310
such a violent way that you're willing
to step in,

201
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,380
kill it,
cut up,

202
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,310
get your hands

203
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,810
bloody.
Because really,

204
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:01,800
that's what it is.
We love it so much that we're willing to

205
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,220
expose ourselves to the elements,
put ourselves in these places,

206
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,360
let the air or the bullet go watch an
animal die,

207
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:12,730
which is never a never an interesting
thing to watch.

208
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,000
I say interesting,
but it's just not a pleasurable thing to

209
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:17,550
watch.
But this is how we engage as hunters

210
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:20,160
into these environments.
And so I was trying to convey that to

211
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,690
nat geo and a seven minute piece.
And Kyle,

212
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,250
um,
after he put it together,

213
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:27,420
he's like,
I think we should release this.

214
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:28,770
And I said,
hell no.

215
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,930
Hell No.
I talk about Peta in it.

216
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,730
I talk about being a vegetarian in it,
which I'm not against vegetarianism.

217
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:37,200
I'm pete as a joke.
But,

218
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,510
um,
but he insisted.

219
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:42,090
So he finally won the argument.
And you know,

220
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,530
well,
[inaudible],

221
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,980
you know,
the idea behind ethical treatment of

222
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:48,180
animals is amazing.

223
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,650
Of course.
I mean you,

224
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:50,990
like you were saying you have a
labrador.

225
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,360
The idea that hunters hate animals too
is also a very confusing thing.

226
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,850
This is ponders love animals.
You know,

227
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:58,860
there's a lot of hunters that have dogs
and cats.

228
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,670
Yeah.
But ethical treatment of animals is,

229
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,890
is imperative.
It's very important.

230
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:07,860
I mean we are,
if we are really the stewards of nature,

231
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:11,430
if we were really the top of the food
chain and we most certainly are we and

232
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:13,860
we're conscious and we have a
conscience,

233
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:17,160
we absolutely should be ethical in our
treatment of animals and take care of

234
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:22,020
them and be kind to them.
Which the problem with Peta is that's

235
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,620
not really what they're about.
They're the Animal Liberation

236
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,820
Organization.
That's what they really are,

237
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,240
what they're about.
They don't want any animals to be pets.

238
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,000
They don't want people to have pets.
Like this is,

239
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,310
I mean this sounds radical,
but it's absolutely true.

240
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,360
In fact,
Peta euthanizes thousands of pets a

241
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,490
year,
they kill pets and they killed them

242
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:43,860
quickly.
They don't keep him alive very long.

243
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:46,980
And the idea being is that for the
critics,

244
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:47,221
the,
the,

245
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:48,900
the,
the idea has been bandied about is they

246
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:52,290
don't want these animals to live and
breed and stay pets.

247
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:56,280
They want animals to only be wild,
and that's fine,

248
00:10:56,281 --> 00:11:00,690
but there's thousands and thousands of
years of domesticated animals,

249
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,820
and if you want to let those animals
loose,

250
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,750
it have them wild.
You have a whole another series of

251
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,520
problems.
Unless you want to kill all the golden

252
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:11,640
retrievers and all the Chihuahuas.
Not that they're not going to survive in

253
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:12,474
the wild.
So like,

254
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,750
yeah,
we've perpetuated pass that a long time

255
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:16,141
ago.
Yeah.

256
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:17,970
They're not wild animals.
They're just not.

257
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,930
No.
Yeah.

258
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:20,850
Like a,
like a little fat kids.

259
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:21,930
Not a wild animal.
Either.

260
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,120
You leave him in the woods,
he's going to die just as quickly as

261
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:24,954
your fucking Chihuahua.

262
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,070
He's going to be food.
Yeah.

263
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:27,340
They're not going to make it.
Yes.

264
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,830
This is not,
you know,

265
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:33,180
so there's a,
there's a weird ideology that they're

266
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:35,230
attached to that is,
it's,

267
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,740
it's,
it's not tenable.

268
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,580
It's not,
no,

269
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,890
you can't argue it.
You know,

270
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,020
the idea of ethical treatment of
animals,

271
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:47,550
I'm 100% with that.
I fucking hate the whole idea of captive

272
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:50,640
orkis.
That to me is one of the big rows that

273
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:54,070
freaks me the fuck out.
That we can take these alien creatures

274
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:59,071
that are essentially as smart as us
probably and put them in swimming pools

275
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,990
and justify it.
And that the only time they've ever

276
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:05,710
killed people in recorded history has
been in those swimming pools.

277
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,260
They don't kill people in the wild.
They kill everything else.

278
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,300
They kill whales,
they killed dolphins,

279
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,670
they kill sharks.
They don't fuck with people.

280
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,200
In fact,
there's been instances where they've

281
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:17,860
saved people and yet we've decided to
put those.

282
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:20,530
So me and Peter are on the hundred
percent the same page as that.

283
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,500
And Pete has retweeted a bunch of shit
that I've put up before,

284
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:26,400
which is really weird.
They retweeted a bunch of shit that I've

285
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:27,670
put up about,
you know,

286
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:28,740
about,
uh,

287
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,030
orcas.
And when I've done that,

288
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:31,841
people like,
uh,

289
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:32,591
you know,
he hunts,

290
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:33,640
right?
And then,

291
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:34,720
then it gets,
you know,

292
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,950
radio silence,
you know,

293
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,510
they don't want to comment on that.
They just want to support my hate for,

294
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,463
you know,
Orca.

295
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,591
Yeah.
You know,

296
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:43,251
I,
I had,

297
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:44,780
um,
one of the most,

298
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:48,080
I've had some,
I've been fortunate to have remarkable

299
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,830
engagements with wildlife in my life,
but two years ago in NBC,

300
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:53,840
I had one with a killer whale and it
was,

301
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,910
it was wicked.
And to this day I regret not making the

302
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,340
decision I'm about to tell you about,
but we had been,

303
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,100
um,
I'd been bear hunting on the coast and

304
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:08,120
we were in a boat cruising back to the
harbor and we found two pods of killer

305
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,180
whales,
uh,

306
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,360
three big bowls and a bunch of cows that
were hunting.

307
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,460
And,
uh,

308
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,230
we kept as they would come up,
they were chasing salmon and as they

309
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:18,110
would come up,
we've just get closer just to film them

310
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,570
or even just to see them and then they'd
go down.

311
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:24,310
And so,
I don't know if it was just happenstance

312
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,900
of where we were,
but we came up and we were just kind of

313
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:30,110
waiting for the whole pod to come up and
all of a sudden,

314
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:32,420
just 50 feet from the boat.

315
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,910
Here comes the huge dorsal fin of this
bowl,

316
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,750
comes right at our boat,
bumps into our boat.

317
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,240
I'm standing on the,
in the crow's nest,

318
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:43,640
essentially I'm on the roof of the boat
looking at the same,

319
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:47,000
he comes up,
bumps into our boat and he just glides

320
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:52,001
his left side all along the boat.
So his left pectoral fin is probably

321
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,800
under our gunnel,
if you will,

322
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:58,460
or under our hall.
And so he's just dragging his finn and

323
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:02,060
he rotates on his side,
dragging his dorsal fin along our side

324
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,410
exhales covering,
I'm our director of photography Williams

325
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:09,650
face in his spray.
And as he's doing this,

326
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:12,770
he goes,
he hugs the bowel of our boat and he

327
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:17,771
never ever breaks eye contact with me.
He's staring at me out of his left eye,

328
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,220
literally rolling his eye over and he
just cruises all the way around the

329
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:23,054
boat.

330
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:23,890
And,
uh,

331
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,840
I wanted to dive in and I just wasn't
sure.

332
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:29,950
Like I didn't want to be one of these,
you got to die.

333
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,540
I didn't want to be the first guy to
die.

334
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,230
And I also didn't want to have like some
sort of shallow water blackout because

335
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:38,900
the water was so cold.
So I didn't want to dive in and have all

336
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:41,480
of a sudden,
like I didn't know how my body would

337
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,130
react cause I hadn't been in the water
yet.

338
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,090
And so,
um,

339
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,530
and then also I was like,
I,

340
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,900
you know,
I'd watched black fish or whatever that

341
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:50,120
film is really killed a bunch of folks
that you know,

342
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:52,310
in,
in seaworld and NBC

343
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,151
and saw.
I was just like,

344
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:56,120
well what if you know,
there's gotta be at first,

345
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,370
you know,
wolves never killed anyone any either.

346
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:59,061
And then,
you know,

347
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:02,180
some young lady when jogging and
[inaudible] son of a bitch,

348
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:03,410
we have number one.
Well,

349
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:06,520
there's a long history of killing people
though in the past.

350
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,670
I'm just saying,
you know,

351
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:08,480
like,
you know,

352
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,800
in recorded time,
but it was still,

353
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:10,790
it was,
it was a,

354
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,420
and he maintained eye contact turned and
then just continued on with the hunt.

355
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:17,360
But it was the only film all this,
yeah.

356
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:19,700
Well you filmed as much as we could
because it happened really fast.

357
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:20,810
But yeah,
it was wicked.

358
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,580
Absolutely wicked.
I mean,

359
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:23,930
literally his,
you know,

360
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:26,510
his dorsal fins probably 10 feet tall
and it is just,

361
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,780
you know,
when you drag something against another

362
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,300
on in an object with force,
you know,

363
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:33,140
it's finished.
Just,

364
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,590
you know,
he was just very engaged with the boat

365
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,860
as a doorstop.

366
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,980
Oh really?
That tall?

367
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

368
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:42,550
It's like,
it's gotta be eight,

369
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:43,384
nine,
10 feet.

370
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,820
That's fucking crazy.
I guess.

371
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:47,380
It makes sense.
They're so big.

372
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,940
Fuck man.
I've never seen one in the wafs seen

373
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:51,970
dolphins in the wall and I've seen
whales in the wild.

374
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,710
I've never seen an Orca.
Yeah.

375
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,420
There,
I mean wicked animals.

376
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,010
We don't even,
we can't even comprehend what that

377
00:15:57,011 --> 00:16:00,160
animal,
that if Orca is weren't real and big

378
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,950
foot was real,
we wouldn't give a shit about big foot,

379
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,130
big foot who'd be in the zoo right next
to the fucking orangutans.

380
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,061
You know,
we'd be like,

381
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:09,960
look at the big monkey stupid monkey,
you know?

382
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,470
Yeah.
But orcas,

383
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:15,220
I mean they speak in a language that we
can't decipher.

384
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:17,830
We don't know what they're saying,
but we know that they have dialects.

385
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,800
We know that they stay in these pods for
life.

386
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,760
They,
they,

387
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,710
they have this family organization and
they all stay in their clan there.

388
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,570
They're fucking incredible.
And you've seen,

389
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,580
you've seen black fish obviously.
Oh yeah.

390
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,340
I so much as I could watch,
I could watch the whole thing and I get

391
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:35,520
angry.
I get,

392
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,440
I get furious that this is a,
a giant business,

393
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:42,430
that they take these things and they buy
them from other organizations.

394
00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:43,960
And I've had,
you know,

395
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,270
I just,
I've had real problems with it for a

396
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,360
long time and I'm,
I felt my friend Phil Demars,

397
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,230
he was a,
a a trainer at marine land and he's been

398
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:55,660
on the podcast many,
many times and he's involved in these

399
00:16:55,661 --> 00:16:58,580
constant lawsuits with Bahrain land.
Um,

400
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,500
he was a walrus trainer and he also
trained killer whales and you know,

401
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:07,501
he's given us some real insight into the
horrors of what it's like in marine land

402
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:10,150
and even in seaworld and what they're
doing and how they,

403
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,650
how they get these orchids and,
and how they're treated and how bad it

404
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:18,010
is for them to be trapped in these
environments and how their dorsal fins

405
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:20,410
go limp because they never have to deal
with current.

406
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,920
So the atrophy,
that whole thing is sick.

407
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,720
It's sick.
Do they still have them now and killer

408
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:27,250
whales at sea world now?
Yes.

409
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,600
Yeah,
they still have them.

410
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,950
Yeah,
they can't,

411
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,950
they can't buy new ones apparently or
something like that.

412
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,240
There's someone here.
Fantastic.

413
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,260
Yeah,
that's the whole thing.

414
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,630
They can't,
I think they could still breed them

415
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:38,021
though.
I mean,

416
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:39,400
the whole thing is fucked up,
man.

417
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,620
It's,
it's just like slavery.

418
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,830
If like we had aliens as slaves,
we just couldn't,

419
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,000
were like,
what are you saying?

420
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,691
Uh,
yeah.

421
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,620
I don't know what you're saying,
dude.

422
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,550
Get in the pool.
If you want to fish in the fucking pool.

423
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,320
I mean,
that's basically what's going on.

424
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,131
It's gross.
Yeah.

425
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:53,964
It's,
it's sick.

426
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,220
It's twisted.
Yeah.

427
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,360
You know,
and I just,

428
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:59,780
uh,
so that's where me and peed were,

429
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,960
we're on the same page.
Yeah.

430
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:02,430
I think anyone,
honestly,

431
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,250
uh,
treating anything with ethics,

432
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:05,670
right.

433
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,610
Particularly animals,
of course a hunters are animal lovers.

434
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:09,840
You know,
we rescue dogs,

435
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:11,010
we rescue cats.
We,

436
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,800
it's,
it absolutely goes without saying,

437
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,710
which is where the contention comes
from.

438
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:18,260
That's where the questions come from.
That's,

439
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:19,094
I,
I get,

440
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,000
I get as many letters from non hunters
and from,

441
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,700
you know,
people that think that they're against

442
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,570
hunting or have,
um,

443
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,160
maybe damning questions than I do from a
hunters themselves.

444
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:32,580
You know,
I get,

445
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,580
I get letters from Hunter's,
I'd say you're a bad ass or you really

446
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:39,450
inspire me or you,
you know,

447
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,270
I'm,
I'm really happy that I can have my kids

448
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:44,550
watch your films.
Like I don't let them watch a hunting

449
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:46,860
tv,
but when we sit down and they want to

450
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:48,810
see something,
they want to ingest something that has

451
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:50,550
hunting and you know,
we'll watch your films.

452
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:51,720
And so I think that's really cool.

453
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,770
But I get a lot of questions from non
hunters and then people that have some

454
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:58,290
contention with it.
Well I think there's a lot of people out

455
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,770
there that are curious.
I mean 90 depending on who you asked,

456
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:06,771
95 or 90% 97% of the population eats
meat and the percentage that actually

457
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:10,500
killed that meet themselves is
incredibly small.

458
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:12,690
It's probably like a 1% you know what I
mean?

459
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:14,370
I don't know what it is.
It might be a little bit harder than

460
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:15,660
that,
but it's no more than five.

461
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,730
And there's a lot of people that are
just on the fence and they're there.

462
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:21,390
They're just sitting there going,
well,

463
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,810
I eat it but I don't kill myself.
But I,

464
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,170
I somehow or another were angry that
someone's doing it themselves.

465
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:31,740
Like my,
before I ever thought about hunting,

466
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,330
my thoughts about hunters were that they
were cruel people that like to kill

467
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:37,110
animals.

468
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,270
Why would you kill animals?
It's not necessary.

469
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,960
You can buy meat from a store.
This is the very shallow thinking that I

470
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:43,860
had,
you know,

471
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:46,080
decades ago.
Then,

472
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,050
you know,
as I started getting older and really

473
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:52,980
considering what I do with my body and
what kind of food I put in,

474
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,670
and then the internet was a big one
because the internet came along and I

475
00:19:56,671 --> 00:20:00,450
started watching those videos that a lot
of them that Peter puts up of factory

476
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:02,910
farming,
oh and I'm terrible.

477
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,890
It's horrible.
It's not just terrible.

478
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:06,810
It's like,
it doesn't make any sense.

479
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:11,280
It's like this is,
this is like human beings at their very

480
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:15,900
worst that we've treated these things as
like the the most,

481
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,210
I mean not just as a commodity,
but we've ignored their feelings and

482
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:27,000
their thoughts and their,
the fact that they have instincts and

483
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,550
needs.
And that we've stuffed them into these

484
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:30,720
tiny little cages.

485
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,850
It's a sickness.
Then you see the cruel,

486
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,610
inhumane treatment that some of the
people that work there,

487
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,560
you know,
and people that work in farms will tell

488
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:37,771
you,
look,

489
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:41,850
this is very rare and these are isolated
instances and this is terrible.

490
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,300
That's well and good.
But there's also ag gag laws that

491
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:49,720
prevent people from filming agricultural
gag laws that prevent people from

492
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:53,200
filming on these factory farms because
they don't want people to know how

493
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:54,780
horrific those conditions are.
So it's,

494
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,710
there's some truth to it.
I mean,

495
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:59,530
maybe they're isolated instances.
Maybe it's a small percentage of the

496
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:01,300
farms that do treat their animals like
that.

497
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,350
But it's significant enough that they're
worried about the impact on the economy

498
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,400
to the point where they're passing laws
that keep people from filming and

499
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,260
showing people what it's like in these
places.

500
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:13,660
And you can even just show people
without any abuse,

501
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,400
just show what's going on.

502
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,600
Just even a still photo of how they're
living and you're not going to want to

503
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:22,930
consume the food.
And these and the people that they think

504
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:25,090
that these animals were raised this way
right there.

505
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,120
Their cows,
their bovines,

506
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,100
they're big dumb animals.
They were bred for this.

507
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,250
Who Cares?
They have no idea what's going on until

508
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:36,640
that spike hits him or they get
electrocuted or they get their throats

509
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:39,670
slit.
But if you have anywhere with hall at

510
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:41,440
all,
if you have any,

511
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:46,360
being any soul at all,
and maybe this is the wrong

512
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,100
idealization or the wrong picture and
building my head,

513
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,520
but if you,
if you make yourself the cow just for a

514
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,770
second,
if you remove yourself just for a

515
00:21:56,771 --> 00:22:01,420
freaking second and just say like is,
is this how I would want to be treated?

516
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,710
Is this how I would want to live?

517
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,700
Is this how I would want to die?
Then you start to ask yourself some

518
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:10,300
pretty big questions that are relatively
easy to answer and we have a lot of

519
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:15,301
people on the earth right now and it's
going to continue until something big

520
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:16,371
happens.
But if you,

521
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:18,940
if,
if you can remove yourself from your own

522
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:23,740
ego and from your own comfort and try to
visualize at all what these other

523
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:25,780
animals are going through,
even animals you're hunting,

524
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,380
um,
it's gonna make you better and more

525
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:34,381
cognizant of being ethical and treating
everything with absolute care even in

526
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:35,800
killing it.
Yeah.

527
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,980
I mean,
contradictions there though,

528
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,680
right?
With hunting because like if you really

529
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:43,120
care about the animal,
why would you kill it?

530
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,661
Right.
That's,

531
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:44,770
yeah.
That's the big question.

532
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:46,240
Yeah.
So hardest thing to wrap your head

533
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:46,600
around.
Yeah.

534
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,320
Yeah.
If you're not,

535
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,600
if you're not in doing our wilderness
is,

536
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,101
it's,
it's,

537
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:52,420
it's absolutely wild.

538
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,070
I mean,
public lands in particular,

539
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,020
they're very there.
It's absolutely wild.

540
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:00,160
But it's also a very weird,
because a lot of the funding for that

541
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:05,161
wildlife comes from people that buy
hunting tags and hunting equipment in

542
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:09,520
order to kill those animals.
So the way those animals are sustained

543
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,320
and the way the wildlife's are protected
in the way that the wardens and game

544
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:19,321
rangers are paid is a lot of it is
through the hunters who want to go out

545
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:22,840
and kill the animals that live on it.
So it's like a lot of people like,

546
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:25,240
well Keith,
this is wild sorta,

547
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,060
but it's also,
I mean sword a sword.

548
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,670
It's protected by people that want to go
in that water.

549
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,730
I mean engage it.
Yeah,

550
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,351
not,
not,

551
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:34,270
I mean we're reducing it to a single
variable.

552
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:36,910
So you want to protect these Lx,
you can go in there and kill an elk.

553
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,740
No,
I want to protect these.

554
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,830
First of all,
I want to protect the habitat so these l

555
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:46,010
can thrive and then in certain instances
in and remove

556
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,280
a few animals or in certain instances,
like if you're in Alaska or something

557
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:51,020
like that and hunting a stable Caribou
herd,

558
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:52,610
you can go in and remove,
you know,

559
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:55,040
not everything is based off of sole
management,

560
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,230
right?
As animals encroach where people are,

561
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,070
we need to cut their numbers down
because humans have taken up so much

562
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:01,904
land.
But,

563
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,310
um,
there are other populations that are

564
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,850
trending in relative harmony.
If they have big,

565
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:10,550
huge scales of land and we're not
drilling for oil or whatever,

566
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,300
who already can go and remove a few a
few animals in their Predator and prey

567
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,250
scenario and it works just fine for the
herd.

568
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:18,430
It works just fine for the population.
And actually,

569
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,650
um,
in a very small way helps the population

570
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:24,410
by removing certain animals for an age
class or a sex class,

571
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:25,760
things like that.
But,

572
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,250
um,
that's the difficulty is we're,

573
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:32,750
we're preserving the habitat so that we
can go in and engage in the wild.

574
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,231
Right.
I mean,

575
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:36,440
I think also a lot of people,
they think you buy your gun,

576
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,750
you buy your bow,
you buy your tag,

577
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,480
you go to Utah,
you leave with an elk.

578
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,230
Well,
that is how it works for like 15% of the

579
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:46,250
people,
if that,

580
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,970
if that,
but there's a whole contingent of 80% or

581
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:53,510
90% of people that buy their bowl by
their gun,

582
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,580
by their pickup truck,
get their hotel room,

583
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,400
get their tent hike 20 miles into the
wilderness,

584
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,400
strike out,
listened to a lot of quiet,

585
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,100
look around,
hike out,

586
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,540
get back in their truck,
drive home,

587
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:09,530
send me an email saying,
where is it that you find elk around

588
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:12,980
September 15th in Utah.
And so there's instill those people are

589
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:14,270
engaging in still,
you know,

590
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:16,250
and there's all different wides.
There's,

591
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,220
you know,
there's fly fishermen in El counters

592
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:19,580
and,
and there's people that just want to

593
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:21,920
take photos and so everyone has their
different engagement.

594
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:25,910
But that's really what it's about.
And we have what we're trending towards

595
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:27,680
8 billion people on the face of the
earth.

596
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,903
So

597
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,400
large scale agriculture and farming and
in animal agriculture as well has

598
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:40,050
created this environment where people
can thrive in these cities where they're

599
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:42,120
not growing any food.
I mean California,

600
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:44,280
where we're at right now,
it's one of the weirdest places on the

601
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:46,110
planet earth.
There's 20 million people.

602
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,490
No one's growing anything.
But we'd,

603
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,050
I mean,
look around here,

604
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,210
it's just a fucking,
there's no farms out here,

605
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:52,080
man.
No,

606
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:53,150
it's farms.
It's,

607
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,390
it's,
it's completely,

608
00:25:54,391 --> 00:25:56,820
we're in the people that are,
a lot of these people that are writing a

609
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,170
lot of these people that are against
this.

610
00:25:58,171 --> 00:26:01,840
They're so hypocritical.
They're eating cheeseburgers while the

611
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:04,170
types and how hypocritical.
Very strange.

612
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,650
Very strange.
But I've been that person.

613
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,000
I've been that meat eating person who
thought that that hunters recording,

614
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,480
I've been that person.
I get it.

615
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,860
I know where they're coming from.
And,

616
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,040
and I've considered vegetarianism and V
and when I was fighting,

617
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,920
I was a Vegan or a vegetarian rather
for,

618
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,280
I guess I was probably considered Vegan.
I don't think I was eating any cheese

619
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:26,580
and I wasn't drinking any milk.
But I did that for like six months.

620
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,830
It didn't,
it just didn't agree with me,

621
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,380
you know?
I mean maybe I didn't do it right and I

622
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,810
never did it again.
But I was doing it to try to lose weight

623
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,620
as what else.
I was also not eating enough.

624
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,401
I was,
it was,

625
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:40,410
there was a lot going on there cause I
was trying to fight it,

626
00:26:40,411 --> 00:26:43,320
a low weight class.
But um,

627
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,020
a lot of people do it and they do it
well and it works for them,

628
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,750
but they have to understand even that's
not clean man,

629
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:52,270
large scale agriculture in terms of
farming,

630
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,120
that shit,
it kills a lot of animals and it

631
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,470
displaces a lot of wildlife.
You're never supposed to have a thousand

632
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,530
acres of soybeans or a thousand acres of
corn or a thousand acres of fucking

633
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,200
wheat or anything,
anything.

634
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,530
All that shit is fake.
All that shit is something someone's put

635
00:27:08,531 --> 00:27:10,690
there.
And when they're using pesticides that

636
00:27:10,691 --> 00:27:13,210
killing things and when they're using
those combines,

637
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:18,070
they are grinding up bunnies and fucking
rats and mice and killing countless

638
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:20,020
bugs.
So the idea that you're getting away

639
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:22,570
without killing any sentient life,
it's bullshit.

640
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,050
And even look at the,
so the corridor of the Mississippi

641
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:27,930
River,
right used to be solid wetlands and our

642
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:30,450
wetlands is how we recycle water.
It's how we,

643
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,800
that stinky biomass that you smell,
that that's clean water being made,

644
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,100
that's detritus materially being,
being processed.

645
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,780
Mississippi River used to be completely
lined with these wetlands.

646
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:47,040
Farmers have one in [inaudible] and
obviously it's not the farmer's fault.

647
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:50,250
This is just as soon as we started
agriculture,

648
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:54,810
1314 15,000 years ago,
the stopwatch was hit.

649
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,390
We went one direction.
You cannot go away.

650
00:27:57,391 --> 00:28:00,180
We were hunters and gatherers.
We could only raise so many children.

651
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:04,170
We had to move with the food.
We had to move away from our excrement.

652
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,240
We had to keep a small population.
But the second we figured out how to

653
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:14,040
grow corn and rice and stay in one place
and raise more than one child,

654
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,810
and now we're close to our excrement.

655
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:20,730
Literally the stopwatch to something
that is going to be a fantastic event

656
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,340
has started.
I don't know if I'm going to see it.

657
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:26,880
I don't know if you're going to see it,
but something wicked is coming.

658
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:27,550
And,
and,

659
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:31,050
and there's no other way to look around.
And there's there,

660
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,800
there's anyway,
something big as overpopulation,

661
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,170
overpopulation,
something will happen.

662
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:38,760
You know,
human beings are animals.

663
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,220
We have awesome thumbs,
we have great brains,

664
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,820
but we are nothing.
There's nothing amazing about us.

665
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,880
We can fly to the moon,
we can do all this great stuff.

666
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,820
By the way,
I loved your discussion with your flat

667
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,490
Arthur Guy.
That was freaking amazing.

668
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:56,070
And the other guy that thinks if you eat
the perfect amount of food,

669
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:58,440
you won't Poop or pee.
That's silly.

670
00:28:58,441 --> 00:29:00,870
Fuck.
California remains the leading us date

671
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:03,810
for cash farm receipts.
Biggest state with,

672
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,910
oh yeah,
that's,

673
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,060
yeah,
but that's outside of La.

674
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,103
If you go outside.

675
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,390
Yeah,
we're just talking about La,

676
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:11,190
California as a lot of farms.
In fact,

677
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:14,820
if you drive from La and you go to
Fresno,

678
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:18,060
like when we were working to Fresno,
it was fucking nothing but farms like

679
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:20,010
all the way up to San Francisco.
Nothing but farms.

680
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,040
It's a lot of almond farming,
tomatoes,

681
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,720
Avocados.
But you look at,

682
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,430
so we've gotten rid of our wetlands and
now where are our soils are saw dust.

683
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,820
There's nothing in them anymore.
So we pump in the nitrogen we pump in.

684
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:35,880
The phosphate still reigns to cause a
lot of people don't understand that you,

685
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:39,960
when you use,
when you grow vegetables on a plot of

686
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:42,010
land over and over and over again,
you deplete

687
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,740
the soil of all the minerals.
Yeah.

688
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,760
Because you're not letting anything die
there,

689
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,950
right.
You are pulling from the earth,

690
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,740
you're harvesting the plant,
nothing is dying.

691
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:53,000
Nothing is returning back to the earth.
And so your er,

692
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:58,110
so then the next year you don't have
that detritus material creating a,

693
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:00,100
all the goodies and the soils,
the bugs,

694
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:01,150
the,
the microbes.

695
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:04,540
You don't have these funguses,
you don't have these symbiotic

696
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:07,940
relationships that are working with all
of these insects and microbes diamond,

697
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,320
so that,
that create your soil to be a living

698
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:13,270
system.
We've as,

699
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,360
as we push all that into the plant and
we harvest it and we just keep doing

700
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:17,320
that repeatedly.
Well,

701
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:19,930
there's less and less of this biomass in
the soil.

702
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:24,070
So we have to then go in and fertilize
with nitrogen and phosphorous to give

703
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:27,520
our plants nitrogen fixation,
things like this to grow these plants.

704
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,100
Then we harvest them.
Then rains come.

705
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:34,060
There's a Rojan all of the soil.
So we lose some of our top soils,

706
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:38,530
which brings us down to even more other
different levels of soils that need even

707
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:41,350
more chemicals brought into them so they
can actually grow something.

708
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,810
But all these soils that are heavily
laden with,

709
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,180
with nitrogen fosters porn in the
Mississippi River.

710
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,790
And people know about this.
I'm not saying anything that isn't,

711
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,450
um,
it hasn't been extremely well documented

712
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:55,480
and pushes down to the Gulf of Mexico.
The sunlight hits it.

713
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,000
All of this,
uh,

714
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,640
Al Algal blooms happen.
All this allergy hits this nitrogen and

715
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:01,630
phosphorous.
It grows.

716
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:05,300
It just like it grows a corn stock,
the sunlight hits it.

717
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:08,050
It,
they have these huge blooms that needs

718
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:12,130
oxygen to function.
So it creates these huge hip oxic zones,

719
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:13,390
right?
You've heard these things called dead

720
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:13,720
zones.

721
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,040
Fish can't live in them.
And so anyone that's hangs their hat on

722
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:21,670
being a vegetarian or,
and I know there's reasons for being a

723
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,750
vegetarian.
I know there's people that refuse to

724
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,170
there.
They don't want to kill the animal

725
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:27,970
themselves.
Um,

726
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,781
and,
and,

727
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:30,280
um,
and they're not going to buy from a

728
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:34,420
factory farm.
I probably have more in common with

729
00:31:34,421 --> 00:31:38,200
vegetarian people that,
that don't want to kill their own

730
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:39,790
animals and,
and,

731
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:42,790
um,
aren't willing to eat factory grown food

732
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,440
that than I have with some of my,
uh,

733
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,800
hunters.
Then with other hunters,

734
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,750
you're saying it seems,
and um,

735
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:50,830
and I,
and I also,

736
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:51,430
um,
I'm,

737
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,760
you know,
I'm so focused on conservation and

738
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:57,220
habitat and being aware,
and it's not,

739
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,840
and it's not ever present,
but I,

740
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:01,570
I have this awareness of when I go and
hunt someplace that,

741
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,520
you know,
am I,

742
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,850
am I actually doing something good here?

743
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,421
Am I,
you know,

744
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:10,840
I won a few years ago to Newfoundland,
a hunt woodland Caribou and the

745
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:13,720
population was really down.
And so I got,

746
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:15,090
I got invited to go there.
And,

747
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,490
and um,
so I started looking into it because of

748
00:32:17,491 --> 00:32:18,460
the population has done.
It's like,

749
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:19,920
man,
should I ever even really be doing this?

750
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:22,390
And I,
through my research I found out this

751
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:24,470
population of Caribou was really sick
lick.

752
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,480
And as they fall really low,
they thrive.

753
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,040
It's,
it's one of the best times for the

754
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:32,170
Caribou.
And actually when their populations are

755
00:32:32,171 --> 00:32:34,270
at a huge boom,
they do the worst.

756
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,240
And so,
uh,

757
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,200
I wanted,
cause they too much of the lichens.

758
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:38,260
Yeah.
So they just,

759
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,030
their resource just starts to be
overlaid in,

760
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:42,860
then they have another,
another Boston.

761
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:43,790
So,
um,

762
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:45,970
so I went and did it.
But there's,

763
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,490
there's a constant ying and Yang and,
and as a hunter,

764
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,410
as a,
as a vegetarian,

765
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,560
even if you want to claim veganism,
all of these things,

766
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,320
we should be asking ourselves big
questions.

767
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,020
This whole thing that everything lives
here in a gray area.

768
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,660
There is no black and white.
I'm not against vegetarians and not

769
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:05,210
against vegans.
If a Vegan comes up to me and says,

770
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:08,330
how in the hell can you kill an animal
and wear leather shoes?

771
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:10,070
I say,
shit,

772
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,070
that's a really good point.
I'd let me ask myself cause I'm going to

773
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:16,700
have to sit down in a quiet float tank
and think about myself.

774
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:19,730
Like what I should be asking myself some
of these big questions.

775
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,900
And as it should,
they,

776
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:24,860
I just think there's a lot of
information that we should keep asking

777
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:27,350
ourselves,
keep asking ourselves because if the

778
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:30,440
population of human beings continues
exponentially,

779
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,230
which it will until this major event
that I,

780
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,240
uh,
that everyone thinks is calming

781
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,240
hunters should almost be the first ones
to give up hunting.

782
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,370
If,
if it trends towards that someday.

783
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,390
If,
if it gets to be,

784
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:49,391
there's not enough wildlife or wild
lands or something fantastic happens.

785
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:53,420
Like hunters should be the first ones.
They should be on the front line of

786
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,260
being aware of the habitat and the
resources and say,

787
00:33:57,261 --> 00:33:57,831
hey,
you know what,

788
00:33:57,831 --> 00:33:59,630
we need to back off.
And,

789
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:00,830
um,
and I've seen it before.

790
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:02,060
It's actually really cool.
Few,

791
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,310
few years ago,
this is a micro instance,

792
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:07,070
but a few years ago,
actually a few years ago,

793
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:09,200
I say it's long time ago,
1991,

794
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:12,410
a huge blizzard hit in Wisconsin,
um,

795
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,240
on Halloween Day.
And,

796
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:17,750
um,
the Wisconsin deer hunters association

797
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,480
shut down whitetail hunting overnight.
He said,

798
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:23,450
there is no deer hunting this year.
It's canceled.

799
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,700
It's done.
There's no legal deer hunting this year.

800
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,450
And then all of these deer hunters,
we're taking their tractors out on these

801
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:34,451
public lands and on their private lands
and plowing areas for the deer to walk

802
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:36,410
around in the deer to move around.
And,

803
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:39,200
and so there's,
there's all sorts of instances about it.

804
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:42,740
But you get what I'm saying?
I think we have to keep asking ourselves

805
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:45,590
these questions as we,
as we move through our time and space.

806
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,780
I think it's real important.
And what you said about,

807
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,210
you know,
what you're essentially saying is that

808
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:51,570
people,
the,

809
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:55,340
and this is always been my problem with
people that proselytize or people that

810
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:56,174
are,
uh,

811
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:01,210
that are really into proclaiming that
they have the moral high ground because

812
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:04,640
they only vegetables.
That high ground is filled with holes.

813
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,090
You're going to step in one of those
holes if you keep talking because the

814
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:11,270
more angry you get at people that hunt
and the more angry you get,

815
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:14,120
the people that eat meat.
You have to understand that if you're

816
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:17,030
eating vegetables,
just by fact that you're buying them

817
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,970
from a factory farm,
you're buying them from large scale

818
00:35:19,971 --> 00:35:22,880
agriculture.
You're absolutely responsible for death

819
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,850
and the death of fish.
I'm glad you brought that up because

820
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:28,880
those dead zones in the ocean that it,
that's a gigantic problem.

821
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,570
Oh my God.

822
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,620
It's a gigantic problem and it's,
it's a problem that is caused in large

823
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:35,810
part by large,
large scale agriculture.

824
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:39,030
As you said.
I think that one of these problems is

825
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:42,510
going to be solved by factory created
meet.

826
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,440
The problem is how many other problems
are going to be created by that?

827
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,040
I don't even mean jen like made me like
out of soy.

828
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,140
Oh No,
no,

829
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,580
no,
no,

830
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,161
no.
They're,

831
00:35:52,161 --> 00:35:57,161
they're making meat in laboratories.
Laboratory created meat and they're

832
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,130
what?
They're,

833
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,900
I don't know exactly what the process
is,

834
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:04,260
but it's flesh cellular base.
Like what's the first thing that they

835
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:04,980
find?
The Patriot,

836
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,850
essentially they're cloning beef and all
these different things and the ideas

837
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,160
that they're going to be able to do this
without anything dying it.

838
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,590
So if you think,
if you think our population,

839
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,350
if you think our human growth is
exponential now,

840
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,620
now,
now we can get rid of the land now we

841
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:23,670
don't need the land now.

842
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,930
There's no value for wild places and
there's no value even for farms.

843
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,380
Now we can get rid of all of that.
And billionaires,

844
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,960
billionaires off,
they love money and so billionaires will

845
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:36,420
buy up all this land because they
already have all the money to buy the

846
00:36:36,421 --> 00:36:37,770
land.
They'll buy the land,

847
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:41,490
they'll get the farms and they'll get
all of the wild places out and they'll

848
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:45,240
build even more houses.
Because you can eat some beige colored

849
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:49,950
grool or laboratory design meet and we
can get even more people.

850
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,260
Well I don't think they're thinking
about it that way.

851
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,170
Uh,
but so I just invented something.

852
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:54,890
This is,
I'm,

853
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,490
I'm sure.
I mean it's like,

854
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,640
it's like the idea of they like they're
going to do this and then,

855
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:04,670
well they're us and there's wildlife and
wild lands are protected.

856
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:10,071
There's federal land and you can't
really build factory farmed meat houses

857
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:10,980
on those places.

858
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,980
But now I see what you're saying.
But there's also the real problem with

859
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,500
like what,
what?

860
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,630
There's no,
there's no free ride.

861
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,760
Like what happens when you make that
meat?

862
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,260
Like what,
what's that time asking you?

863
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:24,030
What's the first thing in the Petri
dish?

864
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:26,100
Right.
And what's the cost of doing this also,

865
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:28,710
is there some sort of a side effect to
eating that meat?

866
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,960
Is it,
does it have negative health effects?

867
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:33,300
Is it have a negative environmental
effect?

868
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:36,210
It's like what is,
is there any sort of like waste product

869
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:39,030
that's created by,
by creating this meat?

870
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,220
I don't know.
These are all questions that have to be

871
00:37:41,221 --> 00:37:44,160
answered.
None of it's clean now.

872
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,940
This is what's really important to like
when you run an Arrow through a bull elk

873
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,470
and that thing,
you know,

874
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:53,430
runs 20 yards and falls down and dies.
There's this weird feeling that you

875
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:56,160
have,
like there's a weird feeling of loss

876
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:00,330
that goes along with this weird feeling
of happiness that you're successful.

877
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,500
It's,
there's not,

878
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,710
there's,
there's no like one or zero.

879
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:06,500
It's not a binary experience.
It's,

880
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,240
it's not clean.
It's like life itself.

881
00:38:09,241 --> 00:38:13,380
Life eats life.
And if you want to claim the moral high

882
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:16,650
ground because you're a vegetarian or if
you want to claim the moral high ground

883
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:18,600
because you're a hunter,
I think,

884
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,840
I think you're missing the big picture.
There is all this weirdness to life and

885
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:29,451
that there is this thing that we do that
we consume and that every other animal

886
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:33,540
does as well.
That's the thing that always strikes me

887
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,870
as being strange is the

888
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,510
people have a real hard time with people
eating predators are people hunting

889
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:45,220
predators like bear hunting is one of
the number one,

890
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,130
uh,
most sure fire ways to get people angry

891
00:38:49,131 --> 00:38:50,770
at you online.
And it's,

892
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,880
there's a lot of ignorance attached to
a,

893
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:56,080
particularly with black bears,
which are responsible for literally

894
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:58,820
killing 50% of all the moose calves and
all the,

895
00:38:58,821 --> 00:39:01,090
the,
the deer fawns and elk calves.

896
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,520
50% of them get whacked by,
by black.

897
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:05,350
They're very successful at calving
season.

898
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:05,760
Yeah,
they,

899
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,593
they have,
uh,

900
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,200
how strong is their nose?
It's some,

901
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:12,930
it's like a bloodhound is thousands of
times stronger scent.

902
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:16,870
Uh,
well then a or then us and then a black

903
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:21,871
bear measurably above that measure be
above this so they can smell like,

904
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,800
the way I try to explain it to people,
it's like,

905
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,840
you know how you smell skunk?
Like if you're driving your car,

906
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,800
you can smell it as fucking skunk for
blocks.

907
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,790
Now a black bear can do that with your
foot odor.

908
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,010
Yes.
Yeah.

909
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:39,520
Literally can smell.
You can smell the mustard on a hamburger

910
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,800
and pick it out from the beef and the
pickles.

911
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,030
It's even better than that because some
biologists are surmising that they

912
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:48,580
actually can tell time,
put their nose.

913
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,930
So when they walk in,
you know,

914
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:51,250
you know,
like you and I are driving on the road

915
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:52,380
and we go,
oh my God,

916
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,310
you smell that skunk.
Well,

917
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,740
he sitting there as he strolls through
the neighborhood,

918
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:57,700
he's gone.
Oh my God.

919
00:39:57,701 --> 00:40:01,900
A skunk was hit by a car this morning.
But yesterday a little fat kid threw a

920
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:05,710
cheeseburger out of the window here.
And two days ago a woman with really

921
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:07,780
strong perfume walked down the sidewalk
with a poodle.

922
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:11,050
So they are literally,
there's so many layers to what they're

923
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:13,320
taking in and everything has it's,
you know,

924
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,420
essentially like different strengths
because of how long it's been president

925
00:40:16,421 --> 00:40:20,590
of the area that they can almost kind of
read a book as they're strolling through

926
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:21,424
their environment.

927
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,500
And so it's that,
how do they know that they can do that?

928
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:27,880
I think they're just making a summations
off of like how powerful their noses are

929
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:31,000
and that they're picking up so much
information that they're picking up old

930
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:32,830
information,
current information,

931
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,770
brand new information.
And,

932
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,280
and,
and I mean,

933
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:39,010
if you think about that,
all of that information coming in their

934
00:40:39,011 --> 00:40:41,170
head in an instant,
every instant,

935
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,860
every time they breathe in.
So that I think scientists are probably

936
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:47,890
making a summation that these bears have
to processes information as they're

937
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:49,810
going through because otherwise they'd
run scared.

938
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:50,710
I'll all day.
Right.

939
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,140
It's incredible.
They're incredible animals.

940
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,630
But it's interesting how many delicious
they are.

941
00:40:55,631 --> 00:40:57,820
They good.
Are they delicious?

942
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,070
People don't want to hear that though.
You eat bears.

943
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,180
Yup.
You eat a bear.

944
00:41:01,181 --> 00:41:05,620
So I have this thing where I've hunted
with several hunting guides,

945
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:09,760
several bear hunting guides where I've
convinced they've never eaten bear meat.

946
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,250
Some of these guys that are guides,
like they send them meat home with their

947
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:13,840
clients where they get it or they donate
it.

948
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,370
But I say,
if you guys ever eaten,

949
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:16,021
bear me.
I,

950
00:41:16,021 --> 00:41:17,320
you know,
they mean the bears here,

951
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:17,811
they have,
you know,

952
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:19,150
like worms and they're,
you know,

953
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:20,620
they're fat as yellow in there and you
know,

954
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:22,420
and I say,
you're full of crap.

955
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:25,900
And so I did a hunt two years ago with a
very dear friend of mine.

956
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:28,990
I won't mention his name cause he'd be
mortified as he should be.

957
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,303
But I said,
hey,

958
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,080
um,
let's eat some bears.

959
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,760
And,
and when,

960
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,010
when I get there and we kill

961
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,730
a bear,
and he's like,

962
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,260
what if you don't kill a bear?
I said,

963
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:39,110
I'll tell you what.
He had a few bear hunts before me.

964
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:40,590
I said,
please,

965
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,400
he kills.
I'm very old bears.

966
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,850
And I said,
please save the ratty.

967
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:49,400
Just bear that you kill for us the
oldest,

968
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,550
nastiest looking bore,
please save,

969
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,433
um,
uh,

970
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,750
ask the archer or the hunter if we can
steal one of his hindquarters.

971
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,060
And he did and he let us.
And when we got there,

972
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:01,640
he pulled it out of the trash bag.
He had in a trash bag in there and

973
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:05,280
they're hanging cooler.
He pulled out of the trash bag and that

974
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:08,060
the fat was yellow and it looked
horrible.

975
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:10,850
And he told me that when he was skinny
and he actually saw some worms

976
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:11,810
underneath the,
you know,

977
00:42:11,811 --> 00:42:13,290
the high devs.
Um,

978
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:14,580
yeah,
yeah,

979
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,980
it's a constant.
And so,

980
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:20,450
uh,
so we made it that night along with some

981
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:22,610
big horn sheep and,
uh,

982
00:42:22,611 --> 00:42:25,760
which is fantastic eating and all of the
big horn,

983
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,270
uh,
several pieces of the big Horn river

984
00:42:27,271 --> 00:42:27,650
left.

985
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:31,640
The bear was long gone.
It was absolutely amazing.

986
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,640
And guys cook it.
Um,

987
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,910
we did it two ways.
One,

988
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:38,360
one day or one way we did it,
cause we were kind of having a dinner

989
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:40,790
party at a cabin.
And so we may just these little tiny

990
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,680
medallions and,
um,

991
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,780
it was really funny to his,
his reaction.

992
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:49,490
So then we just pan seared it with
butter and garlic and onions and just

993
00:42:49,491 --> 00:42:52,280
ate at like little whatever chicken
mcnuggets if you will.

994
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:53,750
And he ate.
Then he's like,

995
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:54,081
well,
yeah,

996
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:58,340
I mean you combine anything with butter
and onions and garlic and it's going to

997
00:42:58,341 --> 00:42:59,090
taste good.
And I'm like,

998
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,710
do you hear yourself?
So I mean,

999
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,150
it's going up to a chef and be like,
Oh yeah,

1000
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:06,070
you made me codfish but use dill and
Manet's and yeah,

1001
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,060
you're a little,
you're a liar.

1002
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,330
You know?
And then so,

1003
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,590
so then that night we made this big
roast and we seared it all sides,

1004
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:12,860
right?

1005
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,530
And seasoned it all up,
made a nice robin and put it in this

1006
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:18,060
broth with vegetables and everything and
hate that.

1007
00:43:18,061 --> 00:43:18,891
And then of course,
he's like,

1008
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,750
well,
I mean you made a rob and you sear it.

1009
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:21,201
And I'm like,
well,

1010
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:23,480
if you suck at cooking,
it's not the bears fault.

1011
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,540
Like bear meat's delicious.
I'm not telling you to eat it raw off

1012
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:28,430
his skeleton the moment you're skinning
him.

1013
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:30,890
But if you take the time to,
uh,

1014
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,700
prepare the flesh when you,
when you're in the field and then cook

1015
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:35,534
it,
well,

1016
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,820
it's amazing.
It's right up there with anything you're

1017
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:39,800
dealing with is internal biases.
Yeah.

1018
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,360
Yeah.
He's,

1019
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,670
he's got these biases and he's just had
them and held onto them forever.

1020
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:44,930
And especially if you're skinning
something,

1021
00:43:44,931 --> 00:43:48,290
you see worms didn't get grossed out and
you already think it's weird.

1022
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:53,060
I know Rinella told me a story once
about a bear that he shot and killed and

1023
00:43:53,061 --> 00:43:55,010
was cooking on a friend smoker.

1024
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,630
And he told the friend,
he goes,

1025
00:43:56,631 --> 00:43:57,441
man,
he goes,

1026
00:43:57,441 --> 00:43:59,480
uh,
you got to clean that fucking smoker

1027
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:00,350
out.
And the guy's like,

1028
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:01,131
were you talking about?
He goes,

1029
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:02,440
man,
that's smoker,

1030
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,040
smelled like fish.
And he goes,

1031
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:06,680
I'd never cooked the fish on that smoker
ever.

1032
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,270
Like,
what are you talking about?

1033
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:12,050
And he's realizing that the bear that he
killed had just been eating nothing but

1034
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:12,800
fish.
Yeah.

1035
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,040
And he said that when he was eating it,
it was a like eating smoked fish.

1036
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,990
Like it was really good.
Yeah.

1037
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:21,060
But it,
but it was this weird taste because it

1038
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:23,390
was like,
you're eating this red meat that tastes

1039
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:25,880
like smoked fish.
It's wicked.

1040
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,970
They're awesome.
They're awesome if you had a blueberry

1041
00:44:28,971 --> 00:44:29,804
bear.
But yes,

1042
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:32,190
I've never had that.
I've heard of the most incredible meet

1043
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,690
on the planet earth.
In fact,

1044
00:44:33,691 --> 00:44:35,380
I got dropped off,
um,

1045
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,420
I don't know,
four or five,

1046
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:37,680
six years ago,
I was in the Arctic,

1047
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,530
uh,
for 30 or so days in the pilot dropped

1048
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,640
us off and he goes,
hey,

1049
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,860
um,
do you have a bear tag?

1050
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:44,490
And I said,
yeah,

1051
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,570
I have a bear tag.
And he's like,

1052
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,770
if you kill a bear,
he's like,

1053
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:48,690
just tons of bears where I'm dropping
you off.

1054
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:50,250
And he's like it.
Tons of grizzlies,

1055
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,380
tons of black bears,
which is uncommon.

1056
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:54,270
But he's like,
if you kill a black bear,

1057
00:44:54,271 --> 00:44:55,650
he's like,
and you don't want the meat,

1058
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,461
I'll take it.
You know?

1059
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:59,100
He'd made it very clear before he even
dropped us off and I said,

1060
00:44:59,101 --> 00:44:59,934
no,
we'll,

1061
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:00,841
we'll keep it,
but we'll,

1062
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:03,300
we'll share with you for sure.
We'll definitely share some with you,

1063
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:05,130
but it's phenomenal.
Yeah.

1064
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:09,600
Rinella was telling me that it's the
literally the greatest meat on earth.

1065
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,270
Like when you have a bear that's been
eating nothing but blueberries,

1066
00:45:12,271 --> 00:45:15,000
and he did a,
an episode immediate or once we shot

1067
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:16,710
one,
and as he's opening it up,

1068
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:18,450
you see purple fat.
Yeah,

1069
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,790
because the bears have been eating
blueberries for so long.

1070
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:24,000
Their fat is purple.
And it made me think about my own diet

1071
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:27,270
quite honestly,
because if this thing tastes so good and

1072
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:29,310
smell so good because of what it's
eating,

1073
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:32,520
if you're eating like fucking
cheeseburgers and fries,

1074
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,820
like that's gotta be in your fat.
Let's get all that bullshit food,

1075
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,790
you know,
fucking donuts that's gotta be in your

1076
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,880
cells.
Like you literally are what you eat.

1077
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,850
We know it.
But do you internalize it?

1078
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,220
I think when you see a bear that has
purple fat,

1079
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,920
maybe you internalize it even more.
I think so,

1080
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:50,641
yeah.
I mean,

1081
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:54,480
anytime you're able to spend,
you know,

1082
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,710
uh,
you know,

1083
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,520
you're,
you're,

1084
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,650
you're dismantling and animal or
something like that.

1085
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,870
You actually get to see these things.
Yeah.

1086
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:04,620
If you have this same perspective or
wherewithal that we were talking about a

1087
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,120
few minutes ago,
that's when you sit there and go,

1088
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,811
well,
wait a minute.

1089
00:46:06,811 --> 00:46:08,790
You're not just mindlessly skinning this
bear.

1090
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,060
You're sitting there going,
is my fat look like skittles?

1091
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,430
Right.
Pounded a bag of skittles yesterday.

1092
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,390
Right.
I heard they,

1093
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,010
they,
they are gross though.

1094
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:18,780
If they've been eating like a rotten
moose,

1095
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,350
I've heard of you.
If you eat a bear that's been eating

1096
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,190
rotten meat,
that it's pretty fucking gross.

1097
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,190
I've heard that too,
but I've eaten them and it was fine.

1098
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,260
Yeah.
What you ate one that ate or rotten

1099
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:29,790
moves.
Well I've eaten one that is,

1100
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:31,650
he was eating a rotten whale.

1101
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,770
The whale was like a whale was like
orange,

1102
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,540
orange and yellow.
They do that,

1103
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:40,890
right?
Like a whale gets beached,

1104
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:44,570
it dies like living it.
They'll crawl right up inside of its rib

1105
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:47,700
cage and they come out looking like they
sound too much hair gel and just

1106
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:52,110
everything that's so foul.
We actually good.

1107
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:53,783
Yeah.
Yeah.

1108
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,500
How did you cook it at?
Same,

1109
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,710
same way that actually I did more
medallions that way because I was

1110
00:46:58,711 --> 00:47:00,570
backpacking so I ate it right on the
beach.

1111
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,400
When you talk about bear hunting,
you really,

1112
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:06,570
you're going up against years of movies,
you know,

1113
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,600
years of fucking Yogi and booboo and
people have this weird perception of

1114
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:18,891
what a bear is and we are the only
things they keep their population in

1115
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:22,380
check.
The only things if you care about deer

1116
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:25,230
and if you care about Moose and if you
care about other wildlife,

1117
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,380
Predator control is the,
it's a real problem there.

1118
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:30,010
One of the most ethical animals are
really

1119
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,500
to hunt.
There are a lot of them there.

1120
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,850
And,
and you have to like,

1121
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,960
you have to be careful though,
right?

1122
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:38,170
I mean,
they need to be controlled in certain

1123
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:39,010
areas,
certain areas.

1124
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:41,290
There's probably a decent balance cause
there's not a lot of,

1125
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,000
um,
there's not a lot of food,

1126
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:45,880
so they might not be focusing on Moose
calves,

1127
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:47,710
rakes or might not be a lot of moose or
something like that.

1128
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,810
But in areas where there's great
overlap,

1129
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,820
like it's definitely,
there's,

1130
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,580
they don't get killed a lot.
Right.

1131
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:57,810
And so people don't hunt them a lot in
general and,

1132
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,060
um,
and,

1133
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,230
and people just,
you know,

1134
00:48:02,231 --> 00:48:02,980
they,
they,

1135
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,070
they instantly go to the ungulates,
right.

1136
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,110
Instantly go to the deer and the Moose
and Caribou,

1137
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:07,960
things like that.
But yeah,

1138
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:11,200
there's definitely need to be managed.
The place I hunted,

1139
00:48:11,201 --> 00:48:15,580
I was bear hunting last week in BC and
the place I was hunting hasn't really

1140
00:48:15,581 --> 00:48:17,170
been hunted in like 10 years.

1141
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:22,620
And you just know that these bears are
so terribly successful at stealing mule

1142
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:25,510
deer,
fawns and Moose calves in this area and,

1143
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,390
and um,
and I've seen it before and you just see

1144
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:29,110
them.
Like,

1145
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,690
I killed a grizzly bear a few years ago.
That was,

1146
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,250
um,
I shouldn't say I killed it.

1147
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:35,530
We,
it charged us.

1148
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:37,480
And so the guy that I was with,
he had to shoot it.

1149
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,980
Um,
and so he killed it.

1150
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:43,000
But as soon as the bullet hit the bear,
he pooped out to,

1151
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,550
to call Moose calves.
And we had,

1152
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,970
we had s we had seen a cow with two
calves,

1153
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:50,620
two twins,
and then,

1154
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,210
um,
he was just cruising up and down the

1155
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:53,050
river.
And so he,

1156
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,570
he definitely got them.
And then when we kill them,

1157
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:56,770
he'd,
and then,

1158
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,290
um,
I wasn't even really thinking much about

1159
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:02,500
it and just didn't have this wherewithal
of what was going on.

1160
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,050
And it was kind of intense,
um,

1161
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:08,740
situation when it went down.
But later on we were talking to the

1162
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:12,520
biologist about it when we were having
the bear skull and hide and meet sealed

1163
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,310
and um,
and we told him that he picked out a

1164
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:16,001
calf and he's like,
oh,

1165
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:18,370
fantastic.
Because there are grizzly bears and

1166
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:22,360
black bears that are really successful
fon and calf killers.

1167
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:24,210
And then there are others that aren't
right there.

1168
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,140
They're kind of individualistic like we
are.

1169
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:27,010
And,
and so he's like,

1170
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:30,610
it's really good that you're moving this
big old board who was a successful calf

1171
00:49:30,611 --> 00:49:31,330
killer.
Cause he,

1172
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:33,070
he would just fixate on that in the
spring.

1173
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:36,250
And really it does not take,
like a lot of people might think,

1174
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:37,440
oh,
there's millions of Moose up.

1175
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:38,470
No,
there aren't.

1176
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,540
And you go up in these areas like,
um,

1177
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,340
people ask me all the time when we're up
in Alaska,

1178
00:49:42,341 --> 00:49:43,174
they're like,
oh,

1179
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,100
when you get off the airplane,
there's got to be just animals

1180
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:45,934
everywhere.

1181
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,800
No,
there are no animals.

1182
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,010
You get off the airplane in the Arctic
and you'd take a look around and there's

1183
00:49:51,011 --> 00:49:53,950
nothing like,
you have to go with no trees.

1184
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,540
There's no trees,
there's no moose.

1185
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:57,400
There's no care,
but like you find them when you go

1186
00:49:57,401 --> 00:49:59,320
looking for it,
then you find them when you find this

1187
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,730
little micro niche of habitat.
But by and large,

1188
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,190
there's nothing there because there's,
you know,

1189
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:11,020
there's not a ton of resources there.
And so like I think people think it's

1190
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:14,980
the Serengeti and it and it's not.
And so if you have a successful grizzly

1191
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,950
and he's preying on Moose and a
particular valley,

1192
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,040
um,
he could really do some damage.

1193
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,650
And where I was,
and I just hunted mountain line for the

1194
00:50:23,651 --> 00:50:27,530
first time in BC this winter and I was
talking to the biologist cause I had

1195
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:31,160
great contention about doing it and they
showed that,

1196
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,290
um,
I didn't want to run them with dogs.

1197
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:35,300
I didn't want to shoot it out of a bait
and a tree.

1198
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,270
Um,
I just had never interested me.

1199
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,400
And so a buddy of mine just got his
first hunting concession in BC has been

1200
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:45,480
a guide his whole life,
but he now has his own concession.

1201
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,770
He has black bears and mule deer is the
guy that I was also just bear hunting

1202
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:49,431
with.
But he said,

1203
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:51,650
hey,
will you come up and do a lion hunt?

1204
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:52,630
And I said,
no man,

1205
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,050
it's not for me.
And he's like,

1206
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,730
well,
you know,

1207
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:57,170
you're kind of being a hypocrite right
now.

1208
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:58,041
And I said,
well,

1209
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:58,851
what do you mean?
He's like,

1210
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:00,200
well,
you're always preaching that people

1211
00:51:00,201 --> 00:51:03,560
should ask themselves big questions and
people should kind of dive into,

1212
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:06,320
you know,
this tornado or the storm and,

1213
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:10,520
and experience things and ask themselves
and actually challenge their thought

1214
00:51:10,521 --> 00:51:10,940
process.

1215
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,040
So who better to come up and go on a
lion hunt?

1216
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,340
And if you have prejudice about it,
why don't you come up and do it?

1217
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:18,500
And so you can see if your prejudice are
real or,

1218
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,670
or not.
And so I did it and it was very eye

1219
00:51:21,671 --> 00:51:23,600
opening.
It was an incredible experience.

1220
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:26,030
What was eye opening about it?
Um,

1221
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,800
just the animals themselves.
You know,

1222
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:28,530
it's,
it was,

1223
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:31,790
um,
the enthusiasm around the hounds.

1224
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,410
Like,
I kind of pictured this,

1225
00:51:33,411 --> 00:51:34,244
you know,
I had this,

1226
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,830
you know,
Fox and the hound scenario built up in

1227
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,500
my head,
you know,

1228
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,720
like it felt for the same,
same stereotypes that non hunters and

1229
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:43,090
anti hundreds were falling forward.
I was like,

1230
00:51:43,091 --> 00:51:44,660
oh,
he's hounds better kind of redneck.

1231
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:47,120
And you know,
they're there,

1232
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,160
they treat their dogs like crap and
they're,

1233
00:51:49,161 --> 00:51:52,160
and they're sending their dogs into this
line fight and it's,

1234
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:55,430
it's gonna get rough and these dogs are
going to get beat up and scarred up.

1235
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:59,780
And then finally you treat this lion and
in the hunter comes waltzing in with no,

1236
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:04,810
no barrier of entry whatsoever.
No physical suffering whatsoever.

1237
00:52:04,941 --> 00:52:07,820
No mental suffering whatsoever.
Comes waltzing in and shoots this thing

1238
00:52:07,821 --> 00:52:12,821
out of a tree and take some photos and
then skins at out leaves the flesh and

1239
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:17,000
moves on with their life.
And so I go up there and meet the hounds

1240
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:18,200
men and,
and first of all,

1241
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:20,900
my friend,
his name's Ben storic and um,

1242
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:23,140
he's very gracious.
Hunteries,

1243
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,130
very aware.
He's very kind to animals.

1244
00:52:25,131 --> 00:52:28,730
These has tremendous wherewithal,
which is why we continue to hunt

1245
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:29,564
together.
But he,

1246
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,220
uh,
so I go up there and meet as Holland's

1247
00:52:31,221 --> 00:52:32,300
man,
great guy.

1248
00:52:32,301 --> 00:52:35,640
His hounds are part of the family sleep
in the cabin with him,

1249
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,800
great dog food,
great medical care every single night

1250
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:41,900
when we'd get home.
Um,

1251
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:47,260
in the scenario in which I killed the
line was also very rewarding for me as a

1252
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:47,900
person.

1253
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,120
We tracked him,
I'll use kilometers cause that's what we

1254
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:50,954
were doing there.
But,

1255
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,900
um,
we tracked him for like 21,

1256
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:58,901
22 kilometers just by his track.
And it was really cool because this lion

1257
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:03,230
had tore his back right track.
So it was kind of like a movie.

1258
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:08,450
We'd see his tracks in the snow and
there's always a dime sized spot of

1259
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:11,090
blood in his track.
And it was pretty cool cause we went and

1260
00:53:11,091 --> 00:53:12,980
spoke with some ranchers along this
river and they're like,

1261
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:13,814
yeah,
he's,

1262
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,290
he's sport killing deer,
which I didn't believe but I just want

1263
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,900
to hear the ranchers a kind of summation
on it.

1264
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:23,210
And they didn't want him,
the ranchers where I was really

1265
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:24,890
surprised with the wrench or like,
you know,

1266
00:53:24,891 --> 00:53:27,660
we you to kill this cat because,
um,

1267
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,460
he sport killing these deer.
But,

1268
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,220
um,
we want ben to be very measured in how

1269
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:35,340
he takes cats because they really love
cats in this area and they just want ben

1270
00:53:35,341 --> 00:53:36,570
to be cognizant of the animals.

1271
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:37,760
He removes,
which he has anyway.

1272
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:42,060
But they love cats just because they
just love the idea of them being there,

1273
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:44,310
the wildlife,
the symbolism of the wild.

1274
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:47,820
And then all these ranchers,
they raise cattle and they watch the

1275
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:49,350
wolves,
um,

1276
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:52,530
harass their cattle,
but they watch the cats will literally

1277
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:56,490
walk right through a calf pen and the
cavs won't spend any,

1278
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,240
they don't even look at the lion.
The cows aren't looking at the lion,

1279
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:04,290
but the lion will just stroll right
through the pen and just carry on about

1280
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:05,760
his day because he wants to kill a deer
and sheet.

1281
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,560
That's,
that's what he wants to fixate on.

1282
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:09,240
He doesn't want to deal probably with
Mama Cow.

1283
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,270
But um,
so we track the same for 22 kilometers.

1284
00:54:12,271 --> 00:54:13,990
We actually got down on it,
um,

1285
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:16,710
on top of a mule deer killed that they
had made the night before.

1286
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,140
Um,
bumped it and it ran way up into the

1287
00:54:19,141 --> 00:54:21,750
mountains and these and these hills and
we tracked it all the way up there.

1288
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:25,740
We tracked another four or five
kilometers and then that's when we

1289
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:30,741
release the hounds and it was wicked to
see the enthusiasm in the hounds.

1290
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:34,890
Like I just pictured something that was
going to be blood thirsty and like,

1291
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,730
you know,
they,

1292
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,140
they wanted to rip this cat apart.
But these hounds that the look on their

1293
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:41,280
faces,
and I'm making,

1294
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,640
making judgments here,
but the look on their faces were just

1295
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,820
pure enthusiasm.
Like this is a game.

1296
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:52,300
Like our job is to,
is the chase this cat down inside,

1297
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,510
they've been trained and to,
and to get it in a tree,

1298
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:57,390
like they're not sitting there going,
we're going to catch and kill this cat.

1299
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:00,210
They're like,
our job is to kind of get it in the

1300
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:00,510
tree.

1301
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,940
You know,
it was just really cool to be around the

1302
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:05,910
dogs and watched her energy.
And so they went and treated the line.

1303
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,670
We snuck in on the line and he,
he,

1304
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:09,960
uh,
he didn't like it and see,

1305
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:13,710
he jumped off and the dogs and sued,
pursued again and then we treat him

1306
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:16,410
again and I killed him.
And killing him was,

1307
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:19,440
um,
neither here nor there.

1308
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,910
It wasn't,
um,

1309
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,610
it was just an act.
It was just,

1310
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,590
uh,
a light switch for me.

1311
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:27,130
It was,
um,

1312
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,180
Ben Needs,
uh,

1313
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,020
Ben had spoke with the biologists.
They wanted a certain amount of cats

1314
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:35,460
removed from this area cause they were
really having predatory impact on the

1315
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,260
sheep and the,
and the deer.

1316
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,370
And I kind of found out why afterwards,
when I spoke to the biologist.

1317
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:41,200
But,
um,

1318
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,900
we got him in three and ben just like,
Hey,

1319
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:46,470
he's a big Tom and he's an old tom and,
um,

1320
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,410
so we're going to kill him anyway,
so if you want to kill him,

1321
00:55:49,411 --> 00:55:49,740
kill him.

1322
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,820
If not,
we're going to kill him.

1323
00:55:50,821 --> 00:55:52,170
You know,
and they had tags to everything was

1324
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:53,550
legal and I said,
no,

1325
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:54,550
I'll kill him.
Um,

1326
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,220
I wanted to take the process all the way
through,

1327
00:55:56,221 --> 00:55:57,780
so I killed him.
He died very quickly.

1328
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,200
Um,
and I'd always heard that their meat was

1329
00:56:01,201 --> 00:56:02,490
really good.
And,

1330
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:04,560
um,
I'd also heard people say it's on the,

1331
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,130
so of course I don't kill anything
unless I'm going to eat it.

1332
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:08,964
So,
uh,

1333
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:12,660
we ate it and it was arguably the finest
meat I'd ever had in my life.

1334
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,370
It's another thing.
Rinella told me,

1335
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,620
he said,
it tastes like pork you've ever had.

1336
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,240
Well,
I'm not even a big fan of pork.

1337
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:20,490
Like I like pork,
but it was pork is okay.

1338
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,700
Mountain lion is like succulent flavor,
deep rich pork.

1339
00:56:24,701 --> 00:56:27,090
It's just absolutely unbelievable.
Um,

1340
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,350
their fat is supposed to be really good
as well.

1341
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,310
Yeah,
yeah,

1342
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,360
absolutely.
And,

1343
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:31,840
and,
uh,

1344
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,910
so it was just really rewarding
experience for me.

1345
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:35,530
And like,
then I got to hang out with the dogs

1346
00:56:35,531 --> 00:56:37,120
afterwards.
And then when I went and spoke with a

1347
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:39,910
biologist that was eye opening as well
because,

1348
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,980
um,
the hounds when we're with,

1349
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,260
he kind of gets the cat to be like five
or six years old,

1350
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:46,480
which would be very old.
It turned out to be three.

1351
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:52,410
And which is amazing that they go from a
kitten to this thing was like 170 580

1352
00:56:52,421 --> 00:56:53,890
pounds.
Um,

1353
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,530
and that big,
that big and just three years.

1354
00:56:56,531 --> 00:57:00,730
And the biologist even told me he had
one come in earlier that year that was

1355
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:02,350
over 200.
It was like two oh two,

1356
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,210
two or three,
which is about as big as they get.

1357
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:06,670
And it was radio collared and he's like,
oh,

1358
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:09,010
this is going to be wicked because we
have the radio collar,

1359
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,710
I'm going to be able to call the
biologist that radio collared this

1360
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:11,890
thing.

1361
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:14,410
It's 200 pounds of thing.
It's gotta be like five or six,

1362
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:17,860
seven years old.
He called the guy and the thing was,

1363
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,960
um,
just had barely leaves,

1364
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:24,340
like just over two years old.
And he's already 200 pounds.

1365
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:25,930
Two years old.
Yes.

1366
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,780
And they're just so,
and,

1367
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:28,614
and with,
um,

1368
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:30,880
you know,
like sometimes aging dear aging bears is

1369
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:33,310
kind of a tricky prospect.
You're looking at the molar where,

1370
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:35,190
and you're looking at their lateral and
sizes and they're,

1371
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:36,690
um,
um,

1372
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:41,230
medial incisors and you're looking at
where and everything with the lions,

1373
00:57:41,231 --> 00:57:46,231
it's very easy to see like they have the
age classes have distinct dental changes

1374
00:57:47,411 --> 00:57:48,400
that happen.
Like it's,

1375
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:49,090
it's,
there's,

1376
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,740
there's kind of no middle ground.
And so,

1377
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,510
you know,
and of course the radio collar they

1378
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:55,990
knew,
but they're just so terribly successful.

1379
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,440
And just looking at the amount of
biomass they put on their bodies,

1380
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:03,070
just their size and how they carry a
fucking forearms

1381
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:06,220
arms or like a human thigh.

1382
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,140
That's what freaked me out because I'm
sitting there holding,

1383
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:11,320
this thing's
gone out body,

1384
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:13,240
it's going to wear to skin,
skin and body.

1385
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,420
And uh,
it weighs the exact same as a deer.

1386
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,970
Like it's the same thing as a deer,
but the proportions are way off.

1387
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:20,980
Right.
The thing is so much shorter.

1388
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,780
The meat,
you know,

1389
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:26,020
it goes all the way down to their paws
so they can jump,

1390
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,390
you know,
30 feet out of a tree and land and just

1391
00:58:28,391 --> 00:58:31,000
like you and I would be rolling around
on the ground going,

1392
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,350
oh my God,
look at my femur.

1393
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,960
And these guys just boom.
And they're off to the races and it's

1394
00:58:34,961 --> 00:58:36,070
just,
you know,

1395
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:37,830
you drop it,
they weigh the same as the deer.

1396
00:58:37,831 --> 00:58:40,330
You drop a deer out of a train,
it's going to have four broken legs.

1397
00:58:40,331 --> 00:58:43,090
These things just land and off to the
races,

1398
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:43,930
the animals.

1399
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:45,250
And so,
and so I was gonna say,

1400
00:58:45,251 --> 00:58:48,940
so the sport killing,
so the biologist told me where the area

1401
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:51,640
where there's a lot of wolves and so the
wolves,

1402
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:55,930
the lines are so much more successful at
killing and the wolves that the wolves

1403
00:58:55,931 --> 00:58:59,830
just become somewhat lazy and they'll
get in these little packs and the

1404
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:01,840
literally find a big Tom and they'll
just follow him.

1405
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,460
And so what this cat is doing is
scientists have observed him killing

1406
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:10,210
deer and he'll literally kill and cash
dear and sheep.

1407
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,480
So that when the wolves find his caches,
the wolves will eat.

1408
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:18,070
And so then he can now he can go and eat
in peace himself so he doesn't get

1409
00:59:18,071 --> 00:59:20,500
fucked with by the wolves.
So he's leaving them food,

1410
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:23,570
he's leaving them food,
which is why the ranchers thought cause

1411
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:24,890
they're like,
he killed a deer and you didn't do

1412
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:25,370
anything with it.

1413
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:27,350
He just killed a deer.
And so they're like,

1414
00:59:27,351 --> 00:59:27,531
no,
no,

1415
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:28,370
no.
He killed a deer.

1416
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:30,110
And it's funny cause when we tracked him
that day,

1417
00:59:30,111 --> 00:59:33,890
he brought us to nine kill sites that
day.

1418
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:34,850
Wow.
Yep.

1419
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:38,270
So he's literally doing that while
you're chasing,

1420
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:38,841
I'm saying,
look,

1421
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,760
just eat this.
Leave me the fuck alone.

1422
00:59:40,761 --> 00:59:41,750
Yeah.
So as,

1423
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:45,050
as you're tracking him,
he's tracking you pass spots,

1424
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,710
hoping that you take his cash and leave
him alone.

1425
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,630
Yep.
Wow.

1426
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,000
Yep.
It was a fantastic experience.

1427
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,310
And then the biologist also told me,
and I was like,

1428
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,980
man,
I had a lot of contention and I'll come

1429
00:59:57,981 --> 00:59:59,590
in here and hunting lions.
And I had,

1430
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,170
you know,
I don't know how successful they are at

1431
01:00:02,171 --> 01:00:03,200
repopulating,
you know,

1432
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:06,020
we almost hunted them to extinction.
At the turn of the century and they're

1433
01:00:06,021 --> 01:00:09,530
just starting to kind of make,
they're starting to expand now back into

1434
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:11,270
their,
some of their original territories.

1435
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,040
Um,
but he's like,

1436
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:13,821
hey man,
Donnie,

1437
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:15,380
he's like,
this is a great animal to take.

1438
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:17,900
This is an area that receives very
little lion hunting.

1439
01:00:17,901 --> 01:00:20,750
We have to take some of these lines out.
And he showed me data that they had on

1440
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:24,140
this one lion,
and I don't want to misquote the data,

1441
01:00:24,141 --> 01:00:27,800
but basically the single line had
removed like nine or 11% of this

1442
01:00:27,801 --> 01:00:29,510
particular sheep herd in a year.

1443
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,500
Just like boom,
boom,

1444
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,170
boom.
And this dude knew the game.

1445
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,620
He knew where to kill,
he knew how to kill and he had no

1446
01:00:39,621 --> 01:00:40,490
chance.
I mean,

1447
01:00:40,491 --> 01:00:42,470
he's just a super pressed.
You have no chance.

1448
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:44,030
If he finds them,
he's going to kill them.

1449
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:45,260
Yeah.
The runs faster.

1450
01:00:45,261 --> 01:00:46,790
He's stronger.
And if he gets a hold of them,

1451
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:48,170
they never,
they never lose.

1452
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:51,110
It's never like a,
like a deer gets away.

1453
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:51,601
No,
they,

1454
01:00:51,601 --> 01:00:52,820
they,
they win every time.

1455
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:53,683
No.
So it was,

1456
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,600
so,
it's right on the same like,

1457
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,660
you know,
same path.

1458
01:00:56,661 --> 01:00:58,000
Has all the predators.
It's like,

1459
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:58,923
you know,
you just,

1460
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,180
it leads to really good discussions,
but people get upset when you kill

1461
01:01:02,181 --> 01:01:03,410
predators.
They get very upset.

1462
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:05,150
What's,
it's really strange because they don't,

1463
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,870
they don't have any problem with the
Predator killing deer and they have less

1464
01:01:08,871 --> 01:01:10,490
problem with people killing deer.

1465
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:13,790
But they have a real problem.
People killing predators and I believe

1466
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:16,850
it's the same problem they have with
like cecil the lion and shit like that.

1467
01:01:16,851 --> 01:01:20,360
They think that you're just doing it to
be an asshole and you just want this

1468
01:01:20,361 --> 01:01:22,850
thing on your wall.
Well I went ahead on your wall.

1469
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,850
I do have some contention and you tell
me and like,

1470
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,600
like for instance like the grizzly bear
issue being shutdown and BC,

1471
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:33,420
there's a bear grizzly bear hunting.
Maybe you can explain that for me.

1472
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:35,150
People don't understand what's going on
with that.

1473
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:35,840
Yeah.
So,

1474
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,360
so the government,
the British Columbia government

1475
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,980
shutdown,
British Columbia,

1476
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:44,390
British Columbia grizzly bear hunting
because they equated it and I guess

1477
01:01:44,391 --> 01:01:46,460
they're probably correct with trophy
hunting,

1478
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:50,300
right to where it hunters,
we're killing these animals and just

1479
01:01:50,301 --> 01:01:53,510
taking the skulls and hides and leaving
the flush behind.

1480
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:54,973
And,
um,

1481
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,420
and I don't know,
I've never,

1482
01:01:56,630 --> 01:02:00,310
uh,
have I at Grizzly bear hunting NBC

1483
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,360
wants,
but I was actually more on a sheep hunt.

1484
01:02:02,361 --> 01:02:03,770
But,
um,

1485
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,070
yeah,
just this notion of like,

1486
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,970
like the gentleman that killed cecil the
lion,

1487
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:11,660
like if you're really going to kill an
animal and,

1488
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,010
uh,
just take its hide,

1489
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,460
uh,
then I've pretty significant issue with

1490
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:18,220
that.
And so like I,

1491
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,970
I just hope hunters that

1492
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:21,870
the guys are hunting the grizzly bears.
I just,

1493
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:26,930
I wonder if this was more of a hunter
instilled issue then,

1494
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,070
then,
um,

1495
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:32,430
people are even bringing light into it.
Cause if people were killing grizzly

1496
01:02:32,431 --> 01:02:34,980
bears in British Columbia,
taking their hides,

1497
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:37,440
taking their skulls and taking all of
the flesh,

1498
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,500
I feel like we'd still be grizzly bear
hunting in British Columbia.

1499
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:42,750
I don't know.
I mean maybe,

1500
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,410
maybe,
but grizzly bears are another notch up

1501
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,380
even above black bears in terms of like,
correct.

1502
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:52,290
Yeah.
Rinella calls charismatic megafauna.

1503
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:55,230
People love those things cause they
liked seeing them.

1504
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,840
And if you don't have to deal with them,
if you're not like that,

1505
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,640
a guy in ennis,
Colorado last year,

1506
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:02,910
they've got his head cut open by one.
If you don't have to deal with them,

1507
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:03,501
you know,
they,

1508
01:03:03,501 --> 01:03:06,720
they are amazing to look at and we all
want them around.

1509
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,250
I mean,
of course they're an incredible animal,

1510
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,280
but it's this thing of trophy hunting.
These what you think of some fat,

1511
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:17,250
Lazy ass hole with a rifle that stands
on top of a lion.

1512
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:19,740
You know,
there's this image that I found online

1513
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,290
and uh,
I was looking at,

1514
01:03:21,291 --> 01:03:22,500
I was like,
that is,

1515
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,380
that's why people have a problem with
trophy hunters.

1516
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:30,400
Axonify this fat fuck,
who should never in a million years

1517
01:03:30,661 --> 01:03:34,860
without that rifle had,
have ever the help or the help,

1518
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:36,930
especially the help,
right?

1519
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,840
Like there's no way he would've got on
it.

1520
01:03:39,841 --> 01:03:41,600
There's no way to who had got to that
position.

1521
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,650
He must've got there in a car,
you know,

1522
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:46,590
and then they have this line in there
and he's perched up on the line like he

1523
01:03:46,591 --> 01:03:48,200
did some amazing thing.
Yeah.

1524
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,450
And my my meanwhile,
that's probably one of those caged lines

1525
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:51,990
anyway.

1526
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:52,650
It is.
I mean,

1527
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:54,480
yeah,
they have so many of those high fence

1528
01:03:54,481 --> 01:03:57,930
hunt where they let these lions,
they have them all caged up in a pen.

1529
01:03:57,931 --> 01:04:01,830
They throw a cows over the dead cows
over the pen,

1530
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,150
over the wall,
the pen,

1531
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:08,040
the lions tear them apart and then they
pick one and take that one out into the

1532
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,520
wilderness area,
which all fenced in anyway.

1533
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:15,390
And then they let it loose and then the
lions stays in the area because it has

1534
01:04:15,391 --> 01:04:18,450
no idea what its boundary is,
what its territory is,

1535
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,130
what,
what other lines were in that area.

1536
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:23,940
So a lot of times they sit still and
they wait for awhile before they figure

1537
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:26,370
out what their territory is.
The hunter comes in,

1538
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,960
shoots,
it stands on,

1539
01:04:27,961 --> 01:04:30,390
it takes a picture of me.
You just shot a pet.

1540
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,550
If you,
if you told me,

1541
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:33,181
he said,
hey man,

1542
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:36,150
I went into Tanzania,
I went into,

1543
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:39,200
you know,
the wildest part and uh,

1544
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:44,100
backpacked in and set up camp and I was
there for 40 days and you know,

1545
01:04:44,101 --> 01:04:47,580
I killed,
killed an eight planes game and I worked

1546
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:49,020
with the locals and,
and,

1547
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,970
and you know,
I shared meet with these different

1548
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:54,000
tribes and,
and man and we found a pride of lions

1549
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:58,170
and there was a giant main to mail and
there was another sister pride over here

1550
01:04:58,171 --> 01:04:58,770
and,
and we,

1551
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,420
you know,
we snuck in and we killed them.

1552
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,220
We hunted him,
we killed him,

1553
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:04,410
you know,
we skinned him out,

1554
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:09,270
we took his flesh and we went on an
honest hunt and we engage the wild here

1555
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:14,160
and we were moved into animal wicked.
I would love to read that book.

1556
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:15,900
I'd love to see that film.
I'd love to hear you.

1557
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:18,190
Tell me that story.
Does eat lions?

1558
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,990
Why not?
That's what I'm saying.

1559
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,020
That's what I'm saying.
I just,

1560
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:22,240
anybody,
I don't know.

1561
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:24,280
I never even heard of it.
I've never been to Africa.

1562
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:30,030
And if and if you're not,
then what are we doing?

1563
01:05:30,071 --> 01:05:31,720
I understand killing it.
So there,

1564
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:32,350
there,
there's,

1565
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:36,130
there's some weirdness there too.
Cause if you told me,

1566
01:05:36,131 --> 01:05:37,390
if,
if you called me and said,

1567
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,720
hey man,
I'm gonna pay you $1 million,

1568
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,000
I want you to come down to my
concession.

1569
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:45,580
I get these offers daily,
not $1 million,

1570
01:05:45,581 --> 01:05:49,480
but if you come down,
will you come down on my concession and

1571
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:52,510
shoot a giraffe?
I'm just making this up,

1572
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:54,430
but I'm trying to pick a zoo animal.
Well,

1573
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:56,560
you come down and shoot a giraffe.
Um,

1574
01:05:56,561 --> 01:05:58,810
I'd love to see come down and film this,
Blah Blah and,

1575
01:05:58,870 --> 01:05:59,770
and uh,
you know,

1576
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:02,890
the is no,
I have no explaining a concession to

1577
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:07,891
people to this large areas that are most
of the time fenced in lot of thousands.

1578
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,510
It's thousands,
maybe even tens of thousands of acres.

1579
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:12,550
Like you're never going to see the
fence.

1580
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:15,380
We could drive you around in there for a
week and you never see it.

1581
01:06:15,381 --> 01:06:17,500
So it's,
unless I'm my wild.

1582
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:19,900
Yeah,
the fence thing is very weird,

1583
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:21,940
right?
Because like their habitat,

1584
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:24,580
the fence essentially keeps people out.
Yeah.

1585
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:26,130
It protects them from poachers.
Yeah.

1586
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:28,360
It's not,
it's not necessarily to trap the

1587
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:29,980
animals,
although the animals can't leave.

1588
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:33,490
It's to keep the poachers out.
It's to preserve these areas because

1589
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:37,510
people
with greed will take,

1590
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,790
they'll kill anything that get a few
dollars in the marketplace for,

1591
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,360
for market meat.
And then certainly to sell a hide to

1592
01:06:43,361 --> 01:06:47,440
maybe even a even more fat hunter that,
or person that calls themselves a hunter

1593
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:50,560
that wants a lion on their wall that
doesn't even want to engage in the

1594
01:06:50,561 --> 01:06:51,191
process.
Right.

1595
01:06:51,191 --> 01:06:54,220
They'll buy the skin or something.
It's why there's trading tiger skins and

1596
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:54,790
things like this.

1597
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:56,500
But,
um,

1598
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:58,180
so in these concessions,
and so these,

1599
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,290
you know,
if you called me and said,

1600
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:00,730
hey,
will you come down and shoot a giraffe,

1601
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,120
um,
you know,

1602
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:03,940
pay 1 million bucks to come down and
shoot a draft.

1603
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,050
You know,
the answer's no,

1604
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,560
I don't want to kill a giraffe.
But if you called me and said,

1605
01:07:08,561 --> 01:07:09,580
hey,
um,

1606
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,490
we have restored this habitat in this
whole river delta,

1607
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:16,240
and Lo and behold,
the giraffes have absolutely taken off

1608
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,150
and they're very,
very successful and they're decimating

1609
01:07:19,151 --> 01:07:21,820
the vegetation here and they're starting
to fight each other with,

1610
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,700
um,
great severity and were finding dead

1611
01:07:24,701 --> 01:07:27,820
bowls and stuff.
We need to remove 10 animals from this

1612
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,070
hurdle.
You come down and shoot 10 drops with

1613
01:07:30,071 --> 01:07:30,760
me,
100%.

1614
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,370
Absolutely.
Like if I can come down and contribute

1615
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:38,970
to the ecology of an area,
either as a hunter or as somebody that's

1616
01:07:39,281 --> 01:07:42,970
just removing animals with a high
powered rifle to create some more

1617
01:07:42,971 --> 01:07:44,980
balance,
I'm all into it.

1618
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:50,010
But if I'm going to pay you $70,000 to
get a big main line so I can have my

1619
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:53,960
photo with a big main lion,
um,

1620
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:55,360
that I can show my friends,
be like,

1621
01:07:55,361 --> 01:07:57,790
oh yeah,
that's when I was in Botswana and that's

1622
01:07:57,791 --> 01:08:01,840
all I could tell you that story.
And I had no interest in it.

1623
01:08:01,841 --> 01:08:06,841
And I think some of that stuff is
maybe really poisonous for hunting.

1624
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,120
I think it's very poisonous.
I think that Cecil the lion story,

1625
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:12,130
it was incredibly poisonous.
Yeah.

1626
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:16,250
It was one of those stories where it was
almost to

1627
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:21,310
find any support for the guy who did
that thing and you know,

1628
01:08:21,591 --> 01:08:23,840
and it was legal.
It was,

1629
01:08:23,841 --> 01:08:24,470
I mean,
you know,

1630
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:26,470
people say,
what was the collared lion yet blown?

1631
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:29,580
You can't really tell like they have
giant mains.

1632
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,920
Even if it was,
it doesn't mean anything.

1633
01:08:30,921 --> 01:08:32,780
You can shoot color an animal's yeah.
Yeah.

1634
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:34,280
I mean,
they're not collared because they're

1635
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:36,320
protected.
It's not like the idea is like you could

1636
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,180
never shoot it because it's collared.
Yeah.

1637
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:39,620
And you know,
um,

1638
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:43,480
it's the,
it's just not what people [inaudible].

1639
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:46,040
There's,
it's real hard to justify if you're not

1640
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:47,030
eating it.
I mean,

1641
01:08:47,031 --> 01:08:48,650
why,
why would you want to do it?

1642
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,270
Why would you want to go and hunt a
lion?

1643
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,670
It doesn't make any sense.
You'd have to be an asshole.

1644
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:54,320
That guy not asking himself any
questions.

1645
01:08:54,321 --> 01:08:55,220
I'll tell you that.
Right?

1646
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:56,750
Yeah.
Right.

1647
01:08:56,751 --> 01:08:57,580
Why is he doing it?

1648
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,180
He's doing it because that's what he
likes to do.

1649
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,260
And so that's why I wonder,
like,

1650
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,720
I haven't grizzly bear hunting in
British Columbia,

1651
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:04,520
but I wonder,
and I'm not,

1652
01:09:04,521 --> 01:09:06,650
I have lots of friends that are,
that are guides and outfitters.

1653
01:09:06,651 --> 01:09:09,500
And I understand that the meat,
um,

1654
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:12,110
I've heard it's gross.
I've heard it's gross too,

1655
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:14,480
but I've eaten it.
How is it fantastic.

1656
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:16,370
Yes.
Yes.

1657
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,810
You know,
again,

1658
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,600
John,
you know John Barklow from Sitka?

1659
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:22,250
Uh,
I've,

1660
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:24,890
I think I've met him.
I think I've met him just telling me

1661
01:09:24,891 --> 01:09:25,724
that he,
uh,

1662
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:30,080
he served people a brown bear meat at
his,

1663
01:09:30,081 --> 01:09:31,270
uh,
at a party once,

1664
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:34,910
like kid cooked it and put it in,
made it like little hors d'oeuvres and

1665
01:09:34,911 --> 01:09:36,350
he didn't tell people what it was.
And you're like,

1666
01:09:36,351 --> 01:09:37,310
this is really good.
What is it?

1667
01:09:37,311 --> 01:09:37,881
And I was like,
oh,

1668
01:09:37,881 --> 01:09:40,980
it's a brown bear.
And they got real mad at him making me

1669
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,130
bear,
but they liked it.

1670
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:43,730
Yeah.

1671
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:45,110
So we,
so we,

1672
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,750
um,
I was hunting a brown bears on Kodiak

1673
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:49,520
island a few years ago and I didn't,
I didn't kill one.

1674
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,650
Um,
but when we got done,

1675
01:09:51,651 --> 01:09:54,680
there was a guy there,
a classically trained chef that lived in

1676
01:09:54,681 --> 01:09:56,580
town and he had,
uh,

1677
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:59,780
him and his buddies had killed a bear.
And so he invited us over for dinner and

1678
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:03,800
when we were in town and he served as
brown bear and it was amazing.

1679
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,750
Absolutely amazing.
How do you cook it?

1680
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,600
He did it several different ways,
but one of the ways he did it,

1681
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:09,680
uh,
that was really amazing.

1682
01:10:09,681 --> 01:10:11,210
And again,
this is all in preparation,

1683
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:12,440
right?
But he made kind of like Swedish

1684
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,360
meatballs,
so he probably,

1685
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:16,910
and he,
and he told us that the preparation was

1686
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:18,620
intensive,
so he made a bath,

1687
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,740
a whole milk bath,
put the bear meat in it,

1688
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,160
let it sit for 10 hours,
dump the milk,

1689
01:10:25,161 --> 01:10:27,890
output more whole milk.
And he did that like four or five times

1690
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,830
to just leech anything that was in the
meat out.

1691
01:10:30,831 --> 01:10:33,320
Right.
Probably blood in any sort of,

1692
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:34,200
um,
I don't know

1693
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,240
if you could be elk.
I Dunno.

1694
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:39,990
I Dunno.
I Dunno if that's doing that with bass,

1695
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:43,950
like taking baths filets and catfish
filets and putting them in milk.

1696
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:44,843
Yeah.

1697
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:47,420
And would it be something along the
lines of Osmosis?

1698
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,390
Would it be that the milk has a greater
density?

1699
01:10:50,391 --> 01:10:52,640
So the,
so the blood wants to leave the meat and

1700
01:10:52,641 --> 01:10:55,160
go into that and create asking the wrong
guy.

1701
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:57,170
I really have no idea.
That's just me guessing.

1702
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,280
I don't either.
But anyway,

1703
01:10:58,281 --> 01:11:02,120
and then he pants here to a bunch of it
and it was like a roast,

1704
01:11:02,121 --> 01:11:05,060
if you will.
But he did it all in a really hot cast

1705
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:08,840
iron skillet and it was phenomenal.
And then I just heard somebody the other

1706
01:11:08,841 --> 01:11:09,890
day,
um,

1707
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:12,270
what was I listening to?
I was,

1708
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:14,280
I was reading something about polar bear
hunting

1709
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,280
and somebody was remarking that a polar
bear was really good to eat.

1710
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,900
And so I think there's a lot of um,
misinformation out there about what is

1711
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:24,450
edible and what is not edible and what
is good and what isn't.

1712
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:27,390
And probably because of the preparation
because people think so.

1713
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:30,150
I've been ignorant about how to prepare
and key up me.

1714
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:32,040
Yeah.
Cause I have people that think I have

1715
01:11:32,041 --> 01:11:33,870
lots of friends.
I think deer meat's disgusting.

1716
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:36,870
Soak fish and milk for odor free
cooking.

1717
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:38,310
Hmm.
Okay.

1718
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,760
So it says when you're buying fish,
okay,

1719
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:44,310
here's the science.
Try to say that word.

1720
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:49,170
Try methylene trimethylamine oxide.
Trimethylamine oxide oxide is a common

1721
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,570
chemical in living things.
It's colorless,

1722
01:11:51,571 --> 01:11:54,060
odorless,
and produced by normal metabolic

1723
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:56,670
processes.
When a fish or shellfish is killed,

1724
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,830
however it breaks down into
trimethylamine,

1725
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:02,760
which is the chemical responsible for
that fishy smell that we know so well.

1726
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:07,830
If your cut of fish isn't too far gone,
as the flesh is still from and only a

1727
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:11,450
few days thought at most,
a quick soak about 10 to 20 minutes and

1728
01:12:11,451 --> 01:12:14,190
a bowl of milk will help get rid of that
odor like casing.

1729
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:15,370
Okay.
How'd he say it?

1730
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:17,370
Is that Cassie or Casey?
I've heard it both ways.

1731
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,200
I've never heard it.
I only read it.

1732
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:22,740
Yeah.
C A s e I n in the milk bonds with the

1733
01:12:22,741 --> 01:12:26,010
tri methylene.
And while it's not a full extraction,

1734
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,510
a quick soak can pull a good bit amount
of the flesh,

1735
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:30,880
reduce the odor.
So that's probably what's going on.

1736
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:35,190
You're reducing the odor and the meat
and it just probably re enhancing the

1737
01:12:35,191 --> 01:12:38,630
flavor and doing something,
especially with a stinky as Baird's meat

1738
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:41,610
and fish.
And this one definitely had,

1739
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:42,421
I think.
Yeah,

1740
01:12:42,421 --> 01:12:45,390
well the big ones especially,
I mean that's one of the reasons why the

1741
01:12:45,391 --> 01:12:48,990
grow so big on Kodiak rights because
they have so much access to fish and

1742
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:49,960
short,
um,

1743
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:51,870
short torpor short hibernation.

1744
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,070
Yeah,
that's crazy,

1745
01:12:53,071 --> 01:12:53,960
man.
Yeah,

1746
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,400
I've never,
I've never eaten grizzly.

1747
01:12:56,401 --> 01:12:58,860
I've eaten brown bear or black bear
rather.

1748
01:12:58,861 --> 01:12:59,730
Um,
uh,

1749
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:03,480
my friend John and Jen,
they have a camp up in Alberta and we,

1750
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:04,560
uh,
oh sure eight.

1751
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:05,880
Do you know them?
The Rivets?

1752
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,400
I don't,
I don't know the,

1753
01:13:07,401 --> 01:13:10,020
uh,
they have a camp up in Alberta and great

1754
01:13:10,021 --> 01:13:13,770
black pair of hunting and jen is a
really good cook and she made this black

1755
01:13:13,771 --> 01:13:16,380
bear stir fry.
And even people that were skeptical,

1756
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:17,330
they were like,
oh,

1757
01:13:17,331 --> 01:13:18,660
okay.
I've never eaten bear before.

1758
01:13:18,661 --> 01:13:19,740
They're like,
holy shit,

1759
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:23,550
this is fantastic.
She cooked this stir fry and then serve

1760
01:13:23,551 --> 01:13:24,690
it over rice.
I mean,

1761
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:26,110
it is,
it's amazing.

1762
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:29,100
It was so good and so good for you.
The way I explain it to people,

1763
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:31,440
it was like,
it's a d like a deer fucked a pig.

1764
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:33,090
That's what the meat tastes like.

1765
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:38,100
And maybe it's cousin was a cow.
Like it's,

1766
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:41,370
it's a strange,
it's not a meat that tastes like

1767
01:13:41,371 --> 01:13:43,920
anything you could put your thumb on.
Like,

1768
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:46,560
oh,
like that's just like this.

1769
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,370
Yeah.
It's just like,

1770
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:49,650
that's just really rich and it's,
it's just,

1771
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,000
yeah,
it's fantastic.

1772
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:52,830
And Yeah,
at bear hunting all the way around,

1773
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:54,210
it's just awesome.
Yeah.

1774
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:55,200
But it's,
again,

1775
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:59,580
it's so charged,
it's so charged in the public eye in

1776
01:13:59,581 --> 01:14:03,930
terms of like how people perceive it.
It's one of those animals.

1777
01:14:03,931 --> 01:14:07,950
And I think it's because of these movies
that people grow up with these movies

1778
01:14:07,951 --> 01:14:10,260
where these animals are our friends,
you know,

1779
01:14:10,261 --> 01:14:12,130
and they're looking out us and they're
our buddies.

1780
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:17,020
And it's just like we've done ourselves
knows service by doing that,

1781
01:14:17,021 --> 01:14:20,920
by creating these films that have
poisoned little kids' minds as to what

1782
01:14:20,921 --> 01:14:25,921
these animals are and what these animals
are are opportunists and predators.

1783
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:29,130
And they are there to remove the weak
and the,

1784
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:32,860
the limping and the babies and anything
else he can get his hands on for

1785
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:35,530
population control.
I mean this is the balance of nature.

1786
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:38,020
If we still were hunters and gatherers,
right,

1787
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:42,430
there would not be,
there was not a single anti hunter in

1788
01:14:42,431 --> 01:14:43,420
that group.
Right?

1789
01:14:43,421 --> 01:14:46,450
There was no,
that guy didn't live,

1790
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,640
there is no room for that guy.
So even,

1791
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:50,800
you know what I talked about in our
short film,

1792
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:54,310
who we are,
like the president of Pida comes from a

1793
01:14:54,311 --> 01:14:58,930
strong group of hunters and gatherers.
Otherwise the dude wouldn't be here like

1794
01:14:58,931 --> 01:15:01,420
to play devil's advocate,
their thought process and the thought

1795
01:15:01,421 --> 01:15:04,960
process of vegans and vegetarians are
that,

1796
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:08,650
if I could speak for them,
is that we're moving past that we're

1797
01:15:08,651 --> 01:15:10,390
moving past animal cruelty.

1798
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:13,420
We're moving past that need to eat and
consume meat.

1799
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:15,880
Right.
I,

1800
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,440
I,
I disagree.

1801
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,110
I think we have,
um,

1802
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:22,420
through infrastructures of Safety and
laziness we've set,

1803
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,420
we've set it up so that you can go down
that road if you want.

1804
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:28,000
Um,
we've shut this up so you don't have to,

1805
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:29,350
um,
break.

1806
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,910
And you know,
you never have to crack an egg.

1807
01:15:30,911 --> 01:15:32,950
If you have enough money,
you never have to crack an egg in your

1808
01:15:32,951 --> 01:15:37,510
entire life and you can eat eggs your
entire life so you can back away from

1809
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,510
who we really are.
As you know,

1810
01:15:40,511 --> 01:15:44,650
if you have the financial wherewithal or
you live in New York City or you live in

1811
01:15:44,651 --> 01:15:47,080
La,
you can back off of the real muddiness

1812
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:49,420
as far as you want.
But in true reality,

1813
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:53,410
this is really who we are.
It's just that we have infrastructures

1814
01:15:53,411 --> 01:15:55,420
now that make up for it,
that make you,

1815
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,000
that allow that disconnection.

1816
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:00,520
They allow you to,
to say,

1817
01:16:00,521 --> 01:16:01,750
hey,
we move past this now.

1818
01:16:01,751 --> 01:16:03,640
Like I can get my coffee at the corner
and you know,

1819
01:16:03,641 --> 01:16:04,570
and,
and um,

1820
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,880
and it's to go to Ethiopia,
right?

1821
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:07,960
Yeah.
It's hard to argue,

1822
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:08,920
right?
It's hard to argue.

1823
01:16:08,921 --> 01:16:10,640
And we did a piece,
um,

1824
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,020
uh,
my production company,

1825
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:14,320
Sick Manta,
we did a piece of years ago or last year

1826
01:16:14,321 --> 01:16:16,090
for epic meets.
Um,

1827
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:19,090
have you ever heard of those guys?
If they do like high and Jerky and they

1828
01:16:19,091 --> 01:16:22,120
do like animal fats and they do bone
broths and things like that.

1829
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:24,940
Anyway,
the owners were bars.

1830
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:26,500
Those are delicious.
Yeah,

1831
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:28,960
they're really amazing.
So the owners were vegans,

1832
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,720
they are both vegans,
a husband and wife couple and,

1833
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:34,660
and they're all,
they're both also triathletes.

1834
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:40,200
And they were doing these races and they
were having a tough time recovering from

1835
01:16:40,241 --> 01:16:43,930
their races and they actually owned one
of the largest vegan food companies in

1836
01:16:43,931 --> 01:16:47,050
the country.
And they went to go see a friend who was

1837
01:16:47,051 --> 01:16:49,450
a medical doctor,
a friend of theirs.

1838
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:50,530
And he said,
hey look,

1839
01:16:50,531 --> 01:16:53,260
I think you guys need to get some
really,

1840
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:54,580
um,
high end,

1841
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,950
uh,
animal fats in your systems to help your

1842
01:16:56,951 --> 01:17:00,640
body recover from these races.
And they started doing that and their

1843
01:17:00,641 --> 01:17:01,600
symptoms,
you know,

1844
01:17:01,601 --> 01:17:03,670
like their soreness or whether it be
back pain,

1845
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:05,050
hip,
knees,

1846
01:17:05,051 --> 01:17:06,700
I'm assuming that was all from the
races,

1847
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:08,920
um,
started to go away almost.

1848
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:10,280
So they started

1849
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:15,280
kind of delving into their psyche and
their questions and they started kind of

1850
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:18,830
revisiting their philosophies,
if you will.

1851
01:17:18,831 --> 01:17:20,220
And,
and I,

1852
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,850
I don't want to get the story wrong,
but I think while they still owned the

1853
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:25,940
Vegan food company,
they started epic meets and they

1854
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:28,460
thought,
can we find meat that is responsibly

1855
01:17:28,461 --> 01:17:31,700
grown and sourced for people that don't
want to kill it themselves?

1856
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:32,961
And,
uh,

1857
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:36,050
and they went down that road.
They ended up actually selling the Vegan

1858
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:37,430
food company off because,
uh,

1859
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:41,960
people found out that they owned both.
And I think there is obviously some

1860
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,230
problems there.
Yeah.

1861
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,790
But they,
but they just found,

1862
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:48,690
um,
really good source for me and,

1863
01:17:48,691 --> 01:17:50,510
and uh,
they do all feel the harvest.

1864
01:17:50,511 --> 01:17:52,790
And so we did a,
we did a commercial production for them,

1865
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,460
a branding piece for them,
um,

1866
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:57,010
to kind of highlight how they treat
their animals and how they kill their

1867
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:58,160
animals because they kill them.

1868
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:01,010
Um,
rather than putting them on a truck and

1869
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:03,170
loading them into crowds and doing that
whole thing,

1870
01:18:03,171 --> 01:18:06,710
they literally drive out with the same
tractor that they feed them with and

1871
01:18:06,711 --> 01:18:08,990
they've had them on huge pastures so
that they're actually,

1872
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:11,200
I'm reclaiming the ground.
Um,

1873
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:13,490
and it's really cool when they,
when they do ranches,

1874
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:17,360
they'll go in and test all the soils of
these ranches and the grasses and then

1875
01:18:17,361 --> 01:18:19,970
they'll retest them after one year,
three years,

1876
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:21,980
five years.
And they're finding even better soils

1877
01:18:21,981 --> 01:18:24,350
and better grasp as these animals.
I've spent time there because they're

1878
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:25,410
doing,
um,

1879
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:28,340
more fertilizing and,
and the grasses are being reclaimed.

1880
01:18:28,341 --> 01:18:29,190
And then,
um,

1881
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,280
they shoot the animal in the head with a
high powered rifle.

1882
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,650
And so they do just lights out,
boom.

1883
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:35,420
Done.
And then that's how they booked from so,

1884
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:36,950
so they do it right.
Do it

1885
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:39,680
about as ethically and humanely as you
can kill an animal,

1886
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,800
as you can kill an animal that's being
raised in a pen.

1887
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:46,180
What was that place in la?
Was it called harmony cafes?

1888
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:48,860
That what it was called?
What was the place where the people,

1889
01:18:48,861 --> 01:18:51,860
the owned it gratitude cafe gratitude,
right.

1890
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:53,150
That's right.
There was,

1891
01:18:53,151 --> 01:18:55,730
um,
a place in la that was owned by these

1892
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:56,930
people.
It still is,

1893
01:18:56,990 --> 01:18:57,590
but,
uh,

1894
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:02,120
they were vegans for a long time and
they were having health issues as well.

1895
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:05,060
And they decided to butcher their own
animals and start raising their own

1896
01:19:05,061 --> 01:19:06,890
animals and butchering them.
And uh,

1897
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:10,910
I think they wrote about it on a blog
and they were just trying to explain

1898
01:19:10,911 --> 01:19:13,160
themselves and vegans went fucking
crazy.

1899
01:19:13,161 --> 01:19:15,500
The people that own the restaurant went
crazy and they've got a bunch of death

1900
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:18,410
threats and yeah.
And it became this giant issue with

1901
01:19:18,411 --> 01:19:19,150
them.

1902
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:20,180
Um,
it's,

1903
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:22,670
you know,
I get where they're coming from.

1904
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:23,401
They don't,
they,

1905
01:19:23,401 --> 01:19:27,380
they have this rigid idea of what's
happening and they don't want an animal

1906
01:19:27,381 --> 01:19:29,180
to die so that they can live.
I get it.

1907
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:34,630
But their perception of the,
the ethical purity of their deciding to

1908
01:19:35,811 --> 01:19:40,811
just eat vegetables and the actual,
the actual health consequences in terms

1909
01:19:40,851 --> 01:19:43,970
of like how many people can get by and
what your,

1910
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:47,330
your physical dietary needs are.
How many people can get by on just

1911
01:19:47,331 --> 01:19:50,480
eating a Vegan Diet,
especially if you're not like super

1912
01:19:50,481 --> 01:19:54,470
careful and using algae and all these
different things to get b12 and fat

1913
01:19:54,471 --> 01:19:58,070
soluble vitamins and you know,
you can get by.

1914
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:02,570
But is it optimum for most people
according to most nutritionists and

1915
01:20:02,571 --> 01:20:04,280
people that aren't ideologues?
No.

1916
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:05,940
Yup,
I agree.

1917
01:20:05,941 --> 01:20:06,361
He's,
no,

1918
01:20:06,361 --> 01:20:11,220
it's like we are herbivores.
I mean rather a omnivores and we're not

1919
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:14,460
herbivores and some people that are in
the vegetarian world,

1920
01:20:14,461 --> 01:20:18,930
they want us to think that we are
basically herbivores and that we can get

1921
01:20:18,931 --> 01:20:23,250
by and then our desire to consume meat
is just because of the sickness that we

1922
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:26,750
have and this is evil nature that,
you know,

1923
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,640
human being sometimes are possessed by
it,

1924
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,090
but it's just just not true.

1925
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:32,790
Yeah.
There are the whole reason why we became

1926
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:35,820
a human being in the first place as
opposed to like one of the lower

1927
01:20:35,821 --> 01:20:38,610
primates.
A lot of that is attributed to our

1928
01:20:38,611 --> 01:20:40,590
consumption of meat,
hunting,

1929
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:41,790
meat,
cooking,

1930
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:44,670
cooking with fire,
and it's such a fantastic,

1931
01:20:44,671 --> 01:20:48,150
like I would love
if I could do,

1932
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,160
if I was a billionaire and you said,
hey,

1933
01:20:50,161 --> 01:20:53,070
do you want to continue along with the
career that you're on right now?

1934
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,790
I absolutely would,
but the thing that I would love the most

1935
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,810
is to take people with me.
Yeah,

1936
01:20:58,811 --> 01:21:02,070
a lot.
It's super hard for a Vegan to get into

1937
01:21:02,071 --> 01:21:03,180
that though.
I mean,

1938
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,290
man,
you would have to,

1939
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,020
they'd have to have some sort of desire
on their part.

1940
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:10,440
Absolutely love life.
[inaudible] you could just like take

1941
01:21:10,441 --> 01:21:14,430
some flower child and you know,
it's only in sprouts and say,

1942
01:21:14,431 --> 01:21:16,530
Hey,
I'm going to go shoot this mule deer

1943
01:21:16,531 --> 01:21:18,870
through the lungs with a fucking yeah.

1944
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:19,980
You know?
Yeah.

1945
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:21,770
Mazy trocar.
Uh,

1946
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,820
you're going to sit there and watch him.
Yeah.

1947
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:25,470
No,
they would have to be,

1948
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,530
have questions.
Yeah.

1949
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,730
I mean,
there would have to be on that path

1950
01:21:29,731 --> 01:21:31,200
themselves.
It's just,

1951
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:36,260
it's an interesting byproduct to me of
society of what we've done with this

1952
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:40,740
really incredible infrastructure that
we've created where we can get food to

1953
01:21:40,741 --> 01:21:45,741
these 20 million people that live in La
and no one be a part of that preparation

1954
01:21:46,321 --> 01:21:47,160
in terms of,
uh,

1955
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,240
you know,
getting the animal,

1956
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:49,560
killing it,
serving it,

1957
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,730
you know,
butchering it,

1958
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,110
cooking it,
serving it.

1959
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,350
We cut all that shit out and go right to
buying the meat that's already cooked.

1960
01:21:55,351 --> 01:21:58,590
Yeah.
And we've done it so much and it's so

1961
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,410
much more prevalent than any of the
other steps.

1962
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:02,850
You know,
most of the,

1963
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:07,530
most of the consumption that most people
in this country,

1964
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,750
like when we're talking about eating
meat,

1965
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:14,370
I would say maybe even what is the
number?

1966
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:18,450
I would like to know what the number is.
If I had a guess of how many people even

1967
01:22:18,451 --> 01:22:20,210
cook their own meat.
Hmm.

1968
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,860
I mean,
how many people are getting most of

1969
01:22:22,861 --> 01:22:27,720
their meals from a store or a restaurant
or fast food?

1970
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:28,550
Yeah.
Pretty prepped.

1971
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:29,790
Yeah.
And how many people would,

1972
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:31,170
I mean I didn't even think about fast
food.

1973
01:22:31,171 --> 01:22:32,490
That's gotta be the majority.
Yeah.

1974
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:34,650
I mean,
how many people actually even cooking

1975
01:22:34,651 --> 01:22:37,380
their own meal?
We've cut out so many steps.

1976
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:41,670
When I would,
I would bet it was probably more than

1977
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:43,440
half.
Don't even cook their own meat.

1978
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:45,091
Yeah.
I mean,

1979
01:22:45,091 --> 01:22:46,680
people,
they just don't have,

1980
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:48,810
they just don't have an understanding of
where it comes from.

1981
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:50,760
Right.
And engagement.

1982
01:22:50,761 --> 01:22:53,100
There's just no understanding
whatsoever.

1983
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:55,560
It's hard subject.
And I just saw,

1984
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,630
um,
flying here to meet with you.

1985
01:22:57,631 --> 01:23:00,210
I just saw a,
I think it was in the Minneapolis

1986
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:02,340
airport,
there was a huge sign on the wall.

1987
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:07,410
It was a picture of a massive,
massive cornfield and it may,

1988
01:23:07,411 --> 01:23:09,670
it may have been doctored up,
but it was corn as far as the eye can

1989
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:11,710
see.
And it was for cargill,

1990
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:14,830
a big car corporation out of Minneapolis
and then get out of Minneapolis.

1991
01:23:14,831 --> 01:23:15,850
But it said,
um,

1992
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:18,760
it said,
um,

1993
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:23,730
preparing to feed 8 billion people.
And uh,

1994
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:25,570
so I just see that sign.
I'm just like,

1995
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:28,330
yeah,
that hell in a hand basket right there.

1996
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:29,800
Corns,
fucking terrible for you.

1997
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:31,330
Terrible.
Absolutely terrible.

1998
01:23:31,331 --> 01:23:31,801
And,
and,

1999
01:23:31,801 --> 01:23:34,120
and literally you can read that sign and
all these people be like,

2000
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:35,290
oh,
that's so beautiful.

2001
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:38,230
Like all those corn stalks and there'll
be food for us forever.

2002
01:23:38,231 --> 01:23:43,210
And why cook when you cannot the
percentage of diners or dinners rather

2003
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:47,680
eaten at home that were actually made at
home in the u s and it's so weird having

2004
01:23:47,681 --> 01:23:49,240
you here.
Jamie's the shit.

2005
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,080
This is weird.
This is just dinner.

2006
01:23:51,081 --> 01:23:51,850
So,
right,

2007
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:54,910
so this is how many people are cooking,
but really that's the only meal.

2008
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:57,880
Lower and lower.
So it's below,

2009
01:23:57,910 --> 01:24:02,910
it's somewhere in the 60% range.
So the percentage of it dinners eaten at

2010
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:09,121
home that were actually made at home in
the u s somewhere around 60% so in that

2011
01:24:10,151 --> 01:24:15,151
60% you got to think there's the mom or
the dad that's cooking and then the kids

2012
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:19,600
that are eating the food so they're not
cooking shit.

2013
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:24,250
So it's probably way lower than that in
terms of the actual human beings that

2014
01:24:24,251 --> 01:24:26,290
are eating cooked food that they cook
themselves.

2015
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,770
Yeah.
So how can you,

2016
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:31,050
how can it,
how can you stand on a,

2017
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,420
uh,
on any sort of laurels at all without at

2018
01:24:34,421 --> 01:24:36,550
least asking some questions?
I mean,

2019
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,740
people that they've,
their answers are,

2020
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:42,340
they feel better if they think that they
are doing no harm.

2021
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:45,700
And the way to do no harm is to eat
vegan.

2022
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:49,210
So this is the ideology behind it.
And I understand it.

2023
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:51,610
I get it,
I appreciate it.

2024
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:56,680
But the fucking anger at people who
don't follow that path is where it gets

2025
01:24:56,681 --> 01:24:58,270
real squirrely.
You know,

2026
01:24:58,271 --> 01:25:02,050
and it's a small number of people,
and I've talked about this in my act,

2027
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:05,860
that the problem with vegans is the
problem with people,

2028
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:08,080
it's not veganism,
it's people.

2029
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,840
If you get a room that has a hundred
people in it,

2030
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:16,170
the odds of one of those people being a
fucking idiot is 100% it's almost a

2031
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:18,430
hundred percent that one of them is a
fucking idiot.

2032
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:21,190
Yeah.
So if you get 300 million people,

2033
01:25:21,191 --> 01:25:25,150
you have 3 million fucking idiots and
some of those folks are vegans.

2034
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:27,700
And that's the problem with veganism.
It's not,

2035
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:31,930
it's not veganism itself.
It's there's a certain percentage of

2036
01:25:31,931 --> 01:25:36,430
human beings that they don't have to do
anything to become vegans.

2037
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:38,170
Right.
They just joined this group.

2038
01:25:38,171 --> 01:25:39,820
It's not like you have it.
Well we're,

2039
01:25:39,821 --> 01:25:42,880
we're thinking about louring you in to
the Vegan culture,

2040
01:25:42,881 --> 01:25:44,380
but we want to know what your philosophy
is.

2041
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:47,290
Are you a hateful person?
Are you a person who's looking to be a

2042
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:48,820
Vegan?
So you could just talk shit about other

2043
01:25:48,821 --> 01:25:50,610
people?
Are you looking to be angry?

2044
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:54,580
You're looking to be in a group or a
gang of plant based gang and put the

2045
01:25:54,581 --> 01:25:57,520
word Vegan in front of your name and
just start talking shit.

2046
01:25:57,521 --> 01:25:59,060
Cause that's a lot of the people.
Yeah.

2047
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:03,560
And so people read all these angry,
hateful things that people,

2048
01:26:03,561 --> 01:26:04,261
right.
And they go,

2049
01:26:04,261 --> 01:26:06,110
oh well this is vegans.
But it's not,

2050
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:08,300
it's not the,
most of the kids are not like that at

2051
01:26:08,301 --> 01:26:09,020
all.
Yeah.

2052
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:11,120
People,
most people are not like that at all.

2053
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:15,050
But there's a certain percentage of them
and they claim veganism and they usually

2054
01:26:15,051 --> 01:26:17,870
put that name,
the word Vegan in their fucking screen

2055
01:26:17,871 --> 01:26:18,260
name.

2056
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:20,220
That's how you can spot those assholes.
Yeah.

2057
01:26:20,830 --> 01:26:21,810
Proud.
Yeah,

2058
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:23,650
they're into it.
They're in a plant based gang.

2059
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:24,850
Yeah.
That's really what happens.

2060
01:26:24,851 --> 01:26:28,580
Yeah.
And so what it is is not necessarily

2061
01:26:28,581 --> 01:26:32,990
even a problem of diet.
It's a problem of human nature is that

2062
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:35,870
people love to stand on the moral high
ground.

2063
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:38,000
They will love to point down to all the
other people,

2064
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,540
whether it's a religious issue,
like you're not eating Halau or you're

2065
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:44,810
not eating kosher or are you a,
you're eating meat on Good Friday.

2066
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:48,170
Whenever the fuck it is,
they just decide that they have this

2067
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,470
moral high ground that you don't have,
so fuck you.

2068
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:53,750
I'm doing it right.
And it really comes from our own

2069
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:58,640
questions of our own existence and this
messiness that we're all inherently

2070
01:26:58,641 --> 01:27:01,490
aware of that life eats life

2071
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:03,810
big time.
Big Time.

2072
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:07,680
There was a guy that I did a podcast
without a Maine and he was,

2073
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:11,460
uh,
he was for sure a vegetarian.

2074
01:27:11,461 --> 01:27:15,510
He might've been a Vegan,
but then he started and he's a forge or

2075
01:27:15,511 --> 01:27:17,460
big time.
It's actually pretty remarkable what he

2076
01:27:17,461 --> 01:27:20,670
does.
But I think 99% of his food he finds in

2077
01:27:20,671 --> 01:27:22,950
the forest year round,
he's just into it.

2078
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:27,951
Big Time process all of his food from
wild apples to acorns to tovar.

2079
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,161
It's,
um,

2080
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:30,580
what's his name?
Um,

2081
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:33,530
what's Daniel vitality?
Really?

2082
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:34,501
Yeah.
Oh,

2083
01:27:34,501 --> 01:27:35,550
Daniel vitale's.
Okay.

2084
01:27:35,551 --> 01:27:36,690
Yeah.
Have you heard of him as well?

2085
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,350
Yep.
So,

2086
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:39,390
um,
so I did a podcast with him and he,

2087
01:27:39,391 --> 01:27:41,160
and he told me that,
um,

2088
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:43,740
and he'd eat insects.
He didn't want it.

2089
01:27:43,741 --> 01:27:46,330
He has completely against hunting.
He didn't want to kill anything.

2090
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,730
He's like,
that's why he's eating insects.

2091
01:27:47,731 --> 01:27:48,990
And he's like,
and I would get a little bit of hate

2092
01:27:48,991 --> 01:27:49,824
mail.

2093
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:52,230
Um,
when I started eating a Damsel,

2094
01:27:52,231 --> 01:27:54,630
flies and dragonflies,
like I'd get a little bit of hate mail.

2095
01:27:54,631 --> 01:27:56,400
And then,
and then a friend of his was like,

2096
01:27:56,401 --> 01:27:57,280
Hey,
um,

2097
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,260
you know,
we should,

2098
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:01,260
let's go gig some frogs.
Let's go get some frogs,

2099
01:28:01,261 --> 01:28:01,891
you know?
And he's like,

2100
01:28:01,891 --> 01:28:02,550
yeah,
I dunno.

2101
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:03,420
Okay,
so I'll do it.

2102
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:05,340
So when he started catching frogs,
he's like,

2103
01:28:05,341 --> 01:28:07,890
man,
like there's a lot of meat on one of

2104
01:28:07,891 --> 01:28:08,790
these frogs.
Like it's,

2105
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:09,450
it's,
it's,

2106
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:11,790
it's like 20 dragonflies,
you know?

2107
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:12,870
And,
and he got,

2108
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:16,530
he got a little bit more flack for it.
And then it's a buddy of his wanting to

2109
01:28:16,531 --> 01:28:19,410
take him fishing and they caught a trout
and he's like,

2110
01:28:19,411 --> 01:28:21,030
oh my God,
this is like three frogs.

2111
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:24,150
Like this is three frog.
And so what he's equating it to is how

2112
01:28:24,151 --> 01:28:28,290
much work he has to go through to get
this protein or to get this,

2113
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,200
you know,
to get just plant,

2114
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,650
like you find one apple that's 15
acorns,

2115
01:28:31,651 --> 01:28:31,950
you know.

2116
01:28:31,950 --> 01:28:36,540
And so like he's equating this to work.
And so he kept just kept moving up the

2117
01:28:36,541 --> 01:28:37,920
food chain.
And um,

2118
01:28:37,921 --> 01:28:40,430
and he's like,
and then one year he killed a Turkey and

2119
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,630
he told me,
it's like I killed a snowshoe hare.

2120
01:28:42,631 --> 01:28:46,590
And he's like,
I was blown away at how much meat was on

2121
01:28:46,591 --> 01:28:47,550
a snowshoe hare.
He's like,

2122
01:28:47,551 --> 01:28:48,890
that was,
you know,

2123
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:51,300
three meals for him and his girlfriend
try a moose.

2124
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:53,340
Yeah.
And so he just kept moving up and killed

2125
01:28:53,341 --> 01:28:55,200
a Turkey.
Then this last year he killed a black

2126
01:28:55,201 --> 01:28:57,600
bear,
but he's like every stage that he's

2127
01:28:57,601 --> 01:29:00,000
moved up,
his hate mail is went up,

2128
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,770
you know,
I have no horn exponentially,

2129
01:29:01,771 --> 01:29:02,070
but

2130
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,750
significantly.
And so it's just,

2131
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,790
people equate all of these things to,
you know,

2132
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:07,380
they remember,
we relate more to mammals,

2133
01:29:07,381 --> 01:29:08,430
obviously we're mammals,
you know,

2134
01:29:08,431 --> 01:29:12,510
and then you bring in something like a
bear that has anthropomorphic,

2135
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:14,100
you know,
mannerisms,

2136
01:29:14,101 --> 01:29:14,541
right?
You,

2137
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:16,830
you watch a black bear for a half a day
and you're like,

2138
01:29:16,831 --> 01:29:18,080
you see your dad,
you're like,

2139
01:29:18,081 --> 01:29:20,370
oh,
I just sat on his ass for four hours

2140
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,340
around sometimes on his toenails.
Yeah.

2141
01:29:23,341 --> 01:29:27,180
He's like itched his ear farted,
he pooped over there next to the girl

2142
01:29:27,181 --> 01:29:27,961
and then you know,
and you're like,

2143
01:29:27,961 --> 01:29:30,270
oh my God,
it's my dad hunting my dad.

2144
01:29:30,271 --> 01:29:31,104
You know,
and,

2145
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:32,160
and so,
you know,

2146
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:34,080
there's things like that,
but um,

2147
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:36,960
that's where this,
I think that's where this really cool

2148
01:29:36,961 --> 01:29:38,790
engagement comes from with hunters.
It's,

2149
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:41,460
and there's a lot of hunters,
like I talked to a lot of hundreds and I

2150
01:29:41,461 --> 01:29:43,110
don't want to be negative,
I'm trying not to be negative,

2151
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:44,350
but I talked to a lot of hundreds that
have no,

2152
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:45,810
I have nothing in common with them.

2153
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:47,760
Absolutely nothing.
Like you hunt,

2154
01:29:47,761 --> 01:29:49,680
I hunt.
I don't even think we have that uncommon

2155
01:29:49,681 --> 01:29:52,010
because I see how you hunt.
And this had nothing to do with how I

2156
01:29:52,011 --> 01:29:54,120
sound like what we were just saying
about vegans,

2157
01:29:54,121 --> 01:29:56,040
that the problem is just being a human
being.

2158
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:59,700
That's the amount of people that choose
to hunt that or they're not well

2159
01:29:59,701 --> 01:30:01,350
informed and they're fucking idiots.
Yup.

2160
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:02,970
And so that's,
that's the stuff is like,

2161
01:30:02,971 --> 01:30:04,470
same with the vegans,
you know,

2162
01:30:04,471 --> 01:30:06,720
there's,
I'm sure there's vegans that sit at home

2163
01:30:06,721 --> 01:30:10,080
and just grab their face and go,
I can't believe somebody just said that.

2164
01:30:10,081 --> 01:30:11,760
I can't believe they sent a death
threat.

2165
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:14,500
Yeah.
We're Vegan for God's,

2166
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:18,300
one of my best friends is a Vegan and I
net words hilarious comedian.

2167
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,800
He's a Vegan.
I know some vegans too.

2168
01:30:19,801 --> 01:30:21,630
And I actually know some vegetarians
that,

2169
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:22,650
um,
you know,

2170
01:30:22,651 --> 01:30:25,320
it was an education for me,
but I had some vegetarians hit me up for

2171
01:30:25,321 --> 01:30:26,370
meat,
you know,

2172
01:30:26,371 --> 01:30:27,710
and I was like,
uh,

2173
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:29,160
oh,
you're vegetarian.

2174
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:29,611
And they're like,
well,

2175
01:30:29,611 --> 01:30:29,971
yeah,
yeah,

2176
01:30:29,971 --> 01:30:31,730
we're not going to eat this meat,
but um,

2177
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:34,530
we'd love to have some fish or deer meat
from you was like,

2178
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,011
oh,
okay.

2179
01:30:35,011 --> 01:30:36,480
Now I'm starting to,
this was a while ago,

2180
01:30:36,481 --> 01:30:37,111
but I'm like,
okay,

2181
01:30:37,111 --> 01:30:40,410
now I'm starting to get it here.
Like people have ethical concerns about

2182
01:30:40,411 --> 01:30:42,020
where their meat comes from.
Yeah.

2183
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:45,150
My friend Jake shields,
he's a go fight in the UFC and he's a

2184
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:48,450
worldclass Jujitsu black belt.
He's been a vegetarian his whole life.

2185
01:30:48,451 --> 01:30:50,220
But he said he would eat meat that was
hunted.

2186
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:51,031
Yeah.
He was like,

2187
01:30:51,031 --> 01:30:52,020
cause that's,
you know,

2188
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:54,510
there's no ethical,
it adds up in his head for him.

2189
01:30:54,511 --> 01:30:56,220
Right.
Like the answers his questions and

2190
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,170
sonically,
but that's exactly it.

2191
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:01,440
I've had some awesome conversations
with,

2192
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:04,320
with people that were not hunters that,
um,

2193
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:06,030
asked great questions.
You know,

2194
01:31:06,031 --> 01:31:09,000
way better than conversations I've had
with guys that call themselves hunters

2195
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:09,720
at times.

2196
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:10,291
Some,
yeah.

2197
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:12,780
I mean this again,
it's the problem with human beings,

2198
01:31:12,781 --> 01:31:13,381
right?
It's,

2199
01:31:13,381 --> 01:31:14,850
there's,
there's certain people that just aren't

2200
01:31:14,851 --> 01:31:16,800
thinking that much and that,
and then there's certain,

2201
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:20,180
there's certain parts of the hunting
culture that are really a boring.

2202
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:20,740
They,
they,

2203
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:21,421
there's,
there's,

2204
01:31:21,421 --> 01:31:26,421
there's people that think it's funny or
fun to shoot as many animals as they can

2205
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:30,210
and they don't,
they don't have any consideration to,

2206
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:33,360
you know,
that this life has been taken so that

2207
01:31:33,361 --> 01:31:38,190
your life can be nurtured or get
nutrition from this animal.

2208
01:31:38,191 --> 01:31:40,770
And they're not thinking of it in terms
of this cycle of life.

2209
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:43,560
They're just thinking of in terms of,
you know,

2210
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:46,860
it's,
it's like the worst aspects that you get

2211
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:51,890
like in a movie about hunting.
And for me like doing it,

2212
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:53,830
going to the Arctic,
um,

2213
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,920
I bring that up often because it's my
favorite place.

2214
01:31:55,921 --> 01:31:58,590
But once you realize the Arctic your
favorite place,

2215
01:31:58,620 --> 01:31:59,860
I just,
uh,

2216
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:03,250
just so wide open and um,
you know,

2217
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:04,420
you have,
you know,

2218
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:09,070
northern lights at night if you're,
if you're locking massive moose and

2219
01:32:09,071 --> 01:32:11,050
Caribou,
like watching Caribou migrate and

2220
01:32:11,051 --> 01:32:12,910
Grizzly bears eating blueberries.
And you know,

2221
01:32:12,911 --> 01:32:15,700
I've been,
I spent so much time with wolves up in

2222
01:32:15,701 --> 01:32:16,680
these areas and,
and,

2223
01:32:16,681 --> 01:32:18,880
and really engaging with the wolves and
stuff and just,

2224
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:21,910
it's just always fed these experiences
to me.

2225
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:25,270
And that's what really started to mean.
That's what really mattered the most to

2226
01:32:25,271 --> 01:32:29,080
me was being in these areas,
taking a deep breath,

2227
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:32,680
being super present,
being super aware and seeing all of

2228
01:32:32,681 --> 01:32:36,040
these different things that were filling
my soul.

2229
01:32:36,041 --> 01:32:37,690
Right?
True soul food wall.

2230
01:32:37,691 --> 01:32:41,950
I was hunting and Moose are wall.
I was hunting and Caribou and then maybe

2231
01:32:41,951 --> 01:32:45,490
being successful on a moose or Caribou
in and skinning it out and,

2232
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:47,840
and feeling the weight on my back.

2233
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:50,680
So I'm getting it back to camp.
And the northern lights or overhead or

2234
01:32:50,681 --> 01:32:51,610
the,
if they're not out,

2235
01:32:51,611 --> 01:32:54,160
the stars are out and I'm hearing wolves
howling.

2236
01:32:54,161 --> 01:32:55,300
And I,
you know,

2237
01:32:55,301 --> 01:32:56,134
I,
I,

2238
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:57,123
I,
uh,

2239
01:32:57,340 --> 01:33:00,240
I lived with a pack of wolves one summer
in Alaska when I was up there doing

2240
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:03,130
research.
And so like all of these with a pack of

2241
01:33:03,131 --> 01:33:04,810
wolves.
So I just do that.

2242
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:06,850
Um,
I was,

2243
01:33:06,851 --> 01:33:09,310
uh,
I was doing research for the US fish and

2244
01:33:09,311 --> 01:33:13,930
wildlife service and a,
I ran a research campa genetics camp for

2245
01:33:13,931 --> 01:33:17,500
the,
from June through September,

2246
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:20,660
may through September or whatever.
I did it five years in a row and,

2247
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:25,740
and one year a pack of wolves moved into
my research camp and,

2248
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:26,800
oh,
it was,

2249
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,570
whoa.
I mean,

2250
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:31,750
whoa.
I went fly fishing one night and I was

2251
01:33:31,751 --> 01:33:36,730
standing on the bank of a river casting
and it was an eerie little river that I

2252
01:33:36,731 --> 01:33:38,710
was on is pretty quiet,
but it had a good flow.

2253
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:40,510
And we were,
I was waiting for salmon to come up and

2254
01:33:40,511 --> 01:33:42,910
I was fly fishing for grayling.
And,

2255
01:33:42,911 --> 01:33:44,290
uh,
it just kind of had this eerie feeling.

2256
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:47,080
I was by myself and I was just had this
eerie feeling that it's being watched.

2257
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:49,150
And,
and I happened to look behind me.

2258
01:33:49,151 --> 01:33:50,950
And there's a big alder thicket,
right?

2259
01:33:50,951 --> 01:33:51,550
These,
these,

2260
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:53,930
these bushes that are probably 10 to 12
feet high,

2261
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:55,720
have green leaves on them in these
twisted,

2262
01:33:55,721 --> 01:33:56,680
gnarly,
almost like a,

2263
01:33:57,310 --> 01:33:59,140
you know,
boo Radley type tree,

2264
01:33:59,141 --> 01:34:00,770
like gnarly branches.
And I was,

2265
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,610
I was just staring in,
in,

2266
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,690
in the alders and there's grizzly bears
where I was.

2267
01:34:04,691 --> 01:34:06,700
So I was just trying to mind my,
and I'm,

2268
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:09,410
you know,
I'm walking on wolf and Grizzly bear

2269
01:34:09,411 --> 01:34:12,100
attracts I'm fishing.
So I was just staring back in the

2270
01:34:12,101 --> 01:34:13,540
dollars.
And um,

2271
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:15,160
it was,
it was like a movie.

2272
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:17,920
So my,
my eyes were starting to truncate down

2273
01:34:17,921 --> 01:34:20,530
on the leaves and then all of a sudden
it came to all this little opening.

2274
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:24,110
I could see a wolf's face staring at me
through the olders.

2275
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:28,030
And,
and she was probably 10 yards away,

2276
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:31,450
something like that.
And so I saw her and when I looked at

2277
01:34:31,451 --> 01:34:33,820
her,
she was just staring at me and I just

2278
01:34:33,821 --> 01:34:35,500
looked back at her and I,
and I just said,

2279
01:34:35,501 --> 01:34:36,281
hey,
you know,

2280
01:34:36,281 --> 01:34:37,540
I just said hey,
I said,

2281
01:34:37,541 --> 01:34:38,770
hey mom,
what's going on?

2282
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:42,730
And I just kept fishing because I wanted
her to know that I knew and I turned my

2283
01:34:42,731 --> 01:34:43,810
back on her.
I kept fishing.

2284
01:34:43,811 --> 01:34:47,230
Well Lo and behold,
she comes out on the sandbar with me and

2285
01:34:47,231 --> 01:34:50,920
she starts walking down behind me.
And it was funny cause if I didn't make

2286
01:34:50,921 --> 01:34:53,530
eye contact she was totally chill.
But if I made eye contact,

2287
01:34:53,531 --> 01:34:57,100
she would snarl at me.
She raised her lips up and give a little

2288
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:58,183
seated girl

2289
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:02,330
and so she was standing.
Now she's probably three feet behind me.

2290
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:03,350
What?
Yeah.

2291
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:05,000
And so she's,
she's right there.

2292
01:35:05,001 --> 01:35:08,120
She's literally right there.
And so I'm just like,

2293
01:35:08,121 --> 01:35:09,220
hey mom,
what's going on?

2294
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:12,890
Just cast my flyer on.
And like when I'm not looking at her,

2295
01:35:12,891 --> 01:35:16,130
she's kind of trying to check me out.
She's doing the whole nose extension,

2296
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:18,800
getting a with,
so she moves off,

2297
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:22,520
she moves off down that she moves off
down to have a gun on you.

2298
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,760
I did have a 12 gauge at that time.
I left 12 gauge slug gun.

2299
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,220
Um,
but I've rarely took that thing with me.

2300
01:35:28,221 --> 01:35:31,550
But I got in trouble actually from one
of my bosses because one of the other

2301
01:35:31,551 --> 01:35:35,180
biologists told my boss is like never,
he never carries the gun and we're

2302
01:35:35,181 --> 01:35:36,440
supposed to carry a gun everywhere we
go.

2303
01:35:36,441 --> 01:35:37,580
And so I'm just like,
whatever.

2304
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:41,300
But um,
so she laughed and I'm worried that she

2305
01:35:41,301 --> 01:35:42,620
was gonna attack,
you know,

2306
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:45,620
now she gets it so close.
That seems weird.

2307
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:46,701
I Dunno.
Yeah,

2308
01:35:46,701 --> 01:35:48,710
she was just checking me out.
She's just checking me out.

2309
01:35:48,711 --> 01:35:49,250
And that's,
that's,

2310
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,900
that's,
that's how I was reading into it anyway.

2311
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:54,590
Just by the way you were talking to her
that she realized that you weren't even

2312
01:35:54,591 --> 01:35:58,430
interested in being a threat and she was
confident that she can get the fuck away

2313
01:35:58,431 --> 01:35:59,990
from you.
That's a good question.

2314
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:01,130
Yeah,
that's a good question.

2315
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:02,330
And not a feet.
Yeah,

2316
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:04,580
that's this.
That's one,

2317
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:06,590
two,
three.

2318
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:08,180
Yeah,
maybe even two and a half feet.

2319
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,610
Like she was right behind me.
You could touch her.

2320
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:11,960
Oh,
it gets much better.

2321
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,330
It gets much better.
I end up spending a whole summer with

2322
01:36:14,331 --> 01:36:17,330
her and all the other animals in the,
in the pack.

2323
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:21,350
So the next day I hear her howell down
the river.

2324
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:23,720
So I'm just messing around.
So I hold back to her.

2325
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:26,450
She holds back to me instantly.
I hobbled back to her.

2326
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,420
All of a sudden I see her.
She's now standing exactly where I was

2327
01:36:29,421 --> 01:36:32,150
standing the night before.
It's all true story.

2328
01:36:32,151 --> 01:36:35,390
She's sitting on her butt sitting
upright,

2329
01:36:35,391 --> 01:36:37,970
like you would see a German shepard
sitting staring at me.

2330
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:43,010
So I give her just a little coy,
little Rah Rah Rah Rah.

2331
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:48,170
She lays down,
she maintains eye contact with me and

2332
01:36:48,171 --> 01:36:52,090
then she just sitting there staring at
me and then she sits up again and I will

2333
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,570
again,
just a little one.

2334
01:36:53,571 --> 01:36:56,100
She lays down again.
She just maintaining eye contact.

2335
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:59,660
Then she leaves that night.
So that area,

2336
01:36:59,670 --> 01:37:01,940
the Tundra that I was on,
um,

2337
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:05,900
is greatly impacted by even human foot
traffic.

2338
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:08,240
So you have to be really careful where
you step because you know,

2339
01:37:08,241 --> 01:37:09,950
your footprint will be there for a long
time.

2340
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:13,010
So we'd walk on these little planks that
we made out of two by fours.

2341
01:37:13,011 --> 01:37:14,900
I would sit up on logs that were,
you know,

2342
01:37:14,901 --> 01:37:18,800
that we put and placed in,
in and put a place night 10 rice slapped

2343
01:37:18,801 --> 01:37:21,170
and I had a genetics 10 where I did all
my stuff.

2344
01:37:21,171 --> 01:37:23,720
Then I had to cook 10 things like that.
And so,

2345
01:37:23,721 --> 01:37:26,360
but right in front of my tent I had this
little platform where I would get

2346
01:37:26,361 --> 01:37:28,760
dressed in the morning cause I would,
I would literally live for five and a

2347
01:37:28,761 --> 01:37:30,920
half months in a little two and a half
person pup tent.

2348
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:34,580
And so I get out in the morning and get
dressed on this little piece of wood and

2349
01:37:34,581 --> 01:37:38,870
then I'd walk to breakfast or whatever
or to the river in the middle of the

2350
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:42,470
night that Alpha male was sitting on my
little platform and he how old it right

2351
01:37:42,471 --> 01:37:46,430
outside my tent.
And I sat up and I grabbed my gun and I

2352
01:37:46,431 --> 01:37:49,310
was just sitting there and he woke me up
from a dead sleep and I was just sitting

2353
01:37:49,311 --> 01:37:52,640
there panting with my gun and I was
looking all around and I didn't know

2354
01:37:52,641 --> 01:37:54,320
what it was.
Then I heard something and I kind of

2355
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:56,130
peeked out and I saw that it was just
big male.

2356
01:37:57,310 --> 01:37:57,840
I was,
I got,

2357
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,730
okay,
it's just not just a wolf,

2358
01:37:59,731 --> 01:38:00,980
but like,
you know,

2359
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:04,890
he's not going to bother me at all.
And so I hung my gun back up and I just

2360
01:38:04,891 --> 01:38:07,050
aren't set my gun back down and I just
laid back down.

2361
01:38:07,051 --> 01:38:10,890
But those two instances just started
each day.

2362
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:14,430
Um,
the next day I come out and I'm walking

2363
01:38:14,431 --> 01:38:19,431
to the genetics tent and I see him,
he's 20 yards away and he's paralleling

2364
01:38:19,531 --> 01:38:23,550
me on this plank and I go into the cook
tent and then I'm kind of like peeking

2365
01:38:23,551 --> 01:38:24,600
out the little corners,
you know,

2366
01:38:24,601 --> 01:38:25,830
like I want to,
I,

2367
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:29,910
cause I don't know what they're doing.
I don't want to walk out and get

2368
01:38:29,911 --> 01:38:30,571
attacked or,
and,

2369
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:33,000
and I,
I don't think that they have no body

2370
01:38:33,001 --> 01:38:36,840
language of hunting whatsoever.
And so what is their body language of

2371
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:38,550
curiosity?
Curiosity.

2372
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:39,930
Yeah.
And um,

2373
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:41,070
I hate to,
I hate to,

2374
01:38:41,071 --> 01:38:42,810
um,
anthropomorphize.

2375
01:38:43,110 --> 01:38:44,700
Yeah.
But it was just like,

2376
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:47,790
it was just like that movie never cry
wolf.

2377
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,980
That's exactly how the wolves were
engaged with that movie.

2378
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:54,210
Just about a researcher,
a book by Farley Mowat of a researcher

2379
01:38:54,211 --> 01:38:57,300
that went up to the Canadian government
had,

2380
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:01,170
they were thinking that wolves were
decimating these caribou herds.

2381
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:05,040
And so they sent this biologists out
there to research the wolves to see how

2382
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:08,310
many care were they were killing in the,
basically what the biologists found out

2383
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:11,160
was that the wolves weren't in killing
any Caribou zero Caribou.

2384
01:39:11,161 --> 01:39:13,890
They were killing redback voles and they
were fishing.

2385
01:39:13,891 --> 01:39:16,140
And they're doing other ways.
They're eating small animals,

2386
01:39:16,141 --> 01:39:19,110
which is basically a very large part.
What wolves do.

2387
01:39:19,111 --> 01:39:21,870
The very small animals and occasionally
killed Caribou,

2388
01:39:21,871 --> 01:39:23,970
occasionally kill Moose,
things like that in certain areas there,

2389
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,180
um,
they can be really hardcore predators

2390
01:39:27,181 --> 01:39:28,680
and other areas that eat a lot of mice.

2391
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,540
And so,
um,

2392
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:34,470
but that's how these wolves are engaging
with the actor in this movie.

2393
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,000
And you know,
they were kind of inquisitive.

2394
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:38,340
They're coming around and,
and so these,

2395
01:39:38,370 --> 01:39:40,800
these wolves,
they were just always present.

2396
01:39:40,801 --> 01:39:44,040
Like even I would go hiking just to get
some exercise and literally three or

2397
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:47,100
four of them would go with me and they'd
hang back like 50,

2398
01:39:47,101 --> 01:39:49,560
60 yards behind me.
But I had high for like 10 miles.

2399
01:39:49,561 --> 01:39:53,370
And then they do the whole thing with me
and returned back to camp with me.

2400
01:39:53,371 --> 01:39:56,910
And then it started to really grow,
um,

2401
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,240
cause we have this research gear that's
in the river so that we can count

2402
01:40:00,241 --> 01:40:03,900
speciate and sample the salmon as they
swim through to go spawn.

2403
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:06,630
But after the salmon spawn,
they all die,

2404
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:09,120
right?
And so they would spawn die and they'd

2405
01:40:09,121 --> 01:40:11,010
come back and they'd wash up on my gear.

2406
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:13,560
And so I'd have all these,
that's why the wolves were there.

2407
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:16,710
They wanted to eat the dead fish that
were coming back down.

2408
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:20,370
And so as I started toss fish off on the
banks of the river,

2409
01:40:20,371 --> 01:40:21,900
usually I would just toss them back into
the river.

2410
01:40:21,901 --> 01:40:25,290
But I tossed him on the banks of fresher
fish and a,

2411
01:40:25,291 --> 01:40:28,110
the wolves started eating them.
And then our relationship just kept

2412
01:40:28,111 --> 01:40:29,910
growing and growing and growing and
growing.

2413
01:40:29,911 --> 01:40:32,430
And,
and then I'm spending like three and a

2414
01:40:32,431 --> 01:40:35,370
half months with them.
Did you think while you were doing this,

2415
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:39,660
this is probably how human beings and
wolves developed this relationship?

2416
01:40:39,661 --> 01:40:43,170
A hundred percent a hundred percent a
hundred percent and I actually,

2417
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:46,290
I feel bad saying this and I hope I
don't offend anybody,

2418
01:40:46,291 --> 01:40:49,170
but I was working with two in you at
guys to ask them,

2419
01:40:49,171 --> 01:40:50,490
oh guys.
And they want him to shoot all these

2420
01:40:50,491 --> 01:40:53,740
wolves.
I kind of lied to him.

2421
01:40:53,741 --> 01:40:54,100
And I just

2422
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:54,641
said,
man,

2423
01:40:54,641 --> 01:40:56,080
like,
have you ever seen wolves behave like

2424
01:40:56,081 --> 01:40:56,891
this?
And they said no.

2425
01:40:56,891 --> 01:40:57,724
And I said,
well,

2426
01:40:57,850 --> 01:40:59,920
you know,
some of your guys' beliefs,

2427
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:03,070
you know,
fall that your ancestors move on into

2428
01:41:03,071 --> 01:41:04,300
the animal kingdom.
Right?

2429
01:41:04,301 --> 01:41:04,871
And they're like,
yeah.

2430
01:41:04,871 --> 01:41:05,501
And I said,
well,

2431
01:41:05,501 --> 01:41:08,680
is there a chance that some of these
wolves could be some of your ancestors?

2432
01:41:08,681 --> 01:41:11,530
You know,
and I know that it's not true.

2433
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:13,600
At least I think,
I know that's not true,

2434
01:41:13,601 --> 01:41:14,351
but they're like,
yeah,

2435
01:41:14,351 --> 01:41:16,030
yeah.
So I just was trying to convince these

2436
01:41:16,031 --> 01:41:17,500
guys cause they wanted to blast these
things.

2437
01:41:17,501 --> 01:41:20,620
And so I just convinced him not to shoot
the wolves and I feel like an asshole

2438
01:41:20,621 --> 01:41:22,330
singing.
Why do you feel like an asshole saying

2439
01:41:22,331 --> 01:41:23,081
that?
I don't know.

2440
01:41:23,081 --> 01:41:24,490
I just didn't want them to shoot the
wolves.

2441
01:41:24,491 --> 01:41:27,130
So I just kind of,
probably a good way to rationalize.

2442
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:30,460
I steered them down a path of,
of where their minds may have gone

2443
01:41:30,461 --> 01:41:31,540
anyway.
Yeah.

2444
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:32,491
And so,
but I,

2445
01:41:32,491 --> 01:41:34,390
I spend time with those wolves and I've
had,

2446
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:36,550
um,
you know,

2447
01:41:36,551 --> 01:41:36,980
in the,
uh,

2448
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:39,450
in the idea of management,
like when we're in,

2449
01:41:39,451 --> 01:41:41,830
in,
in the short that Jamie was just playing

2450
01:41:41,831 --> 01:41:42,910
who we are,
that we played.

2451
01:41:42,911 --> 01:41:45,790
You can see some wolves in there.
And a few years ago I got surrounded by

2452
01:41:45,791 --> 01:41:50,050
a pack of wolves in the Arctic with the
crew and it films really beautifully.

2453
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,690
And it was,
and it was one of the most remarkable

2454
01:41:52,691 --> 01:41:54,460
engagements I've ever had in the
wilderness.

2455
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:56,590
Um,
and they were definitely,

2456
01:41:56,770 --> 01:42:01,770
their body language was definitely
looking at us as though are we food?

2457
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:04,090
Right?
So this,

2458
01:42:04,091 --> 01:42:06,700
that was one of them,
but we had like six or seven wolves come

2459
01:42:06,701 --> 01:42:09,490
in behind us.
So this wolf would be in front of us,

2460
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:11,060
two or three others would be behind
this,

2461
01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:13,330
but you can see they're not attacking
us.

2462
01:42:13,330 --> 01:42:15,070
They're not even hunting us.
But you can just see,

2463
01:42:15,071 --> 01:42:16,270
like,
they're wondering,

2464
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:18,040
you know,
is there,

2465
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:20,050
is there a play here?
Right?

2466
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:21,280
Is there,
is there a play here?

2467
01:42:21,281 --> 01:42:22,270
And,
and,

2468
01:42:22,271 --> 01:42:23,210
um,
and I,

2469
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:24,580
and I,
and I mean there's,

2470
01:42:24,581 --> 01:42:27,730
I'm not being a tough guy.
There wasn't an ounce that I didn't have

2471
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:31,510
a,
not a fiber of my body was afraid at any

2472
01:42:31,511 --> 01:42:32,740
point.
And there's probably six,

2473
01:42:32,741 --> 01:42:37,480
seven molds around us within 10 yards
all and they're communicating,

2474
01:42:37,481 --> 01:42:39,440
they're doing this little like,
ah.

2475
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:42,940
So they're talking to each other and
then they just moved off and it turns

2476
01:42:42,941 --> 01:42:46,180
out that the w the Moose that I was
stalking,

2477
01:42:46,181 --> 01:42:49,150
I think they were stocking too,
cause there was a big bowl that was

2478
01:42:49,151 --> 01:42:53,500
bedded and if they weren't stocking him,
cause I think they would have had their

2479
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:56,290
hands full with him for that.
If they weren't stocking him then they

2480
01:42:56,291 --> 01:42:58,060
were just moving in that general
direction in a,

2481
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:59,800
they were for sure hunting.

2482
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:03,400
And I've just,
I've always had a tremendous respect for

2483
01:43:03,401 --> 01:43:06,370
them and I've always spent,
I've just,

2484
01:43:06,810 --> 01:43:08,740
I've always had time with them.
I've always had time.

2485
01:43:08,741 --> 01:43:12,700
And then I've always been,
I've had wolf tags in my pocket before.

2486
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:16,210
You know,
this kind of falls under the same idea

2487
01:43:16,211 --> 01:43:18,100
of conservation.
Like these walls right here.

2488
01:43:18,101 --> 01:43:19,630
Right.
I had a wolf tag in my pocket.

2489
01:43:19,631 --> 01:43:22,210
I had my bowl.
I could've arrowed any of these wolves,

2490
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:24,370
easily.
Multiples of them probably.

2491
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:27,100
Um,
but I didn't want to kill a wolf here

2492
01:43:27,101 --> 01:43:28,200
because I,
you know,

2493
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:31,300
they know when another wolf has gone
right.

2494
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:32,410
The,
the pack knows.

2495
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:35,290
And so that,
that weighs on me a little bit.

2496
01:43:35,291 --> 01:43:36,041
That's me.
We're so,

2497
01:43:36,041 --> 01:43:36,910
why,
right?

2498
01:43:36,911 --> 01:43:37,850
Like,
why kill him?

2499
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:42,130
Like what is there too many of them?
This is a real issue.

2500
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:43,960
Let's see.
That was the thing for me is like I

2501
01:43:43,961 --> 01:43:46,330
didn't have,
I didn't do my homework for this area,

2502
01:43:46,331 --> 01:43:48,760
so I was just like,
I dunno if there's a lot of wolves.

2503
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:50,680
I don't under the little wolves,
I'm not going to kill the wolf.

2504
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:53,780
I've no interest in killing wolf.
I get a wolf tag with my stuff.

2505
01:43:54,290 --> 01:43:58,280
Rinella was telling me that there was a,
one of the explorers that traveled the

2506
01:43:58,281 --> 01:44:02,120
West during the Lewis and Clark days,
his favorite meal was wolf.

2507
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:05,750
Hmm.
And that wolf was literally his favorite

2508
01:44:05,751 --> 01:44:08,360
thing to eat.
I've never eaten it.

2509
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:10,790
Yeah.
I would have a real hard time.

2510
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:14,250
I just couldn't,
there are too much like dogs there.

2511
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:19,010
I think there's some sort of a genetic
memory that we have of our relationship

2512
01:44:19,011 --> 01:44:20,010
with wolves.
They've,

2513
01:44:20,190 --> 01:44:22,370
I mean,
they've become dogs and they've become

2514
01:44:22,371 --> 01:44:23,960
our,
you know,

2515
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:28,190
our companions and they become a part of
our community.

2516
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:30,410
It just wasn't,
um,

2517
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:31,490
you know,
it wasn't for me.

2518
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,130
And when the pilot picked me up,
he asked me if I'd seen any wolves and I

2519
01:44:34,131 --> 01:44:34,461
said,
yeah,

2520
01:44:34,461 --> 01:44:37,640
we saw a lot of wolves and how he's like
all there now,

2521
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:39,170
you know,
he's not,

2522
01:44:39,171 --> 01:44:40,700
I'm not telling you is running surveys
here,

2523
01:44:40,701 --> 01:44:41,151
but he's like,
yeah,

2524
01:44:41,151 --> 01:44:42,080
there's a lot of wolves here.

2525
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:44,330
There's a lot of predation on,
on Moose here.

2526
01:44:44,331 --> 01:44:46,690
So we're trying to,
we're trying to really cut the wolves

2527
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:47,351
down here.
But I,

2528
01:44:47,351 --> 01:44:50,960
and I saw a lot of wolves,
but I also saw a ton of Moose and I saw

2529
01:44:50,961 --> 01:44:54,620
a ton of cows and I saw lots of calves
and lots of big bowls.

2530
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:57,470
So everything seemed to be functioning
in that area.

2531
01:44:57,471 --> 01:44:59,890
And I also saw a ton of,
um,

2532
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:02,420
back vols right.
They look like mice with little short

2533
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:04,230
tails.
And I know where there's a lot of red

2534
01:45:04,231 --> 01:45:07,730
back vols I know the wolves do extremely
well eating them.

2535
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:10,850
And so you see these little tunnels
right in the Tundra and stuff.

2536
01:45:10,851 --> 01:45:12,140
And,
um,

2537
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:16,370
I think wolves eat a lot smaller of prey
than people think on average.

2538
01:45:16,371 --> 01:45:20,060
Right.
We see sensational things of small dogs

2539
01:45:20,061 --> 01:45:20,900
or,
or wolves.

2540
01:45:20,901 --> 01:45:21,910
And we filmed,
I don't know if,

2541
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:24,710
did you see the Dingo Hunt that we
filmed in Australia?

2542
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:26,270
No.
Oh my God.

2543
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:28,330
And I was wondering a Dingo Hunt?
Nope.

2544
01:45:28,370 --> 01:45:32,330
We were hunting buffalo and um,
while we were hunting Buffalo Dingo has

2545
01:45:32,331 --> 01:45:35,210
just exploded from the bush and the
dingoes.

2546
01:45:35,211 --> 01:45:38,210
We're pack hunting the Asiatic water
buffaloes.

2547
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:41,690
Nobody's ever seen it before.
Nobody's ever filmed it before.

2548
01:45:41,691 --> 01:45:45,050
We had the Dingo institute call us
immediately from Australia.

2549
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:48,530
We had Dingo,
small,

2550
01:45:48,531 --> 01:45:50,990
tiny dude.
So we filmed all that is not straight.

2551
01:45:50,991 --> 01:45:53,240
It's literally never been filmed before
to our knowledge.

2552
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:55,190
Uh,
everyone that we talked to that is Dingo

2553
01:45:55,191 --> 01:45:57,140
researchers,
they want to know exactly where this was

2554
01:45:57,141 --> 01:45:59,870
because I'd never seen this behavior and
see this behavior right here,

2555
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:04,520
that was actually coming in to hunt Das.
But you can see the whole crew sat down.

2556
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:08,060
Everybody was totally committed.
They're trying to kill that calf right

2557
01:46:08,061 --> 01:46:10,400
there.
And still that calf is monstrous,

2558
01:46:10,401 --> 01:46:12,500
right?
So there's four or five,

2559
01:46:12,501 --> 01:46:13,220
six on there.

2560
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:17,120
And then they chase,
they stampede the whole herd directly

2561
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:19,160
right into us.
That's what you're seeing right here.

2562
01:46:19,161 --> 01:46:22,670
And that the heard actually comes to
like 15 feet before they split around

2563
01:46:22,671 --> 01:46:24,860
us.
We're all sitting on our butts and then

2564
01:46:24,861 --> 01:46:28,910
the dingoes actually turn their
attention to us and they come in around

2565
01:46:28,911 --> 01:46:29,391
us.
And you,

2566
01:46:29,391 --> 01:46:31,400
cause you can see us instantly looking
at us as a,

2567
01:46:31,401 --> 01:46:33,500
we're a meal,
but like wolves,

2568
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:35,690
like grizzly bears,
like black bears,

2569
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,480
very quickly they look at you and they
got,

2570
01:46:37,481 --> 01:46:40,130
yeah,
this is not going to work out for me.

2571
01:46:40,190 --> 01:46:42,620
Yeah.
They don't want to die.

2572
01:46:42,621 --> 01:46:43,490
You know what I mean?
So like,

2573
01:46:43,491 --> 01:46:45,090
yeah,
nobody had ever seen die.

2574
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:47,810
Why the fuck are they going after water
bottle?

2575
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,530
Terrible idea.
But obviously there,

2576
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:54,960
I dunno if this group has done this
before.

2577
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:57,390
Well they must've ride.
The must have been successful on the

2578
01:46:57,391 --> 01:46:58,560
calf,
you know,

2579
01:46:58,561 --> 01:47:02,550
and the idea is that they're going to
chase him and wear him out and that one

2580
01:47:02,551 --> 01:47:04,620
of the cavs going to be separated.
They're going to take it down.

2581
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:06,750
Yeah.
But they're like 35 pounds.

2582
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:09,450
That's so crazy.
It's such a small animal.

2583
01:47:09,451 --> 01:47:12,060
And these calves,
even the calves are probably like a

2584
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:14,610
hundred pounds
bigger.

2585
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:16,080
Yeah.
Maybe even 200.

2586
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:19,170
That Guy Looks Australia is fuck the
other guy.

2587
01:47:19,171 --> 01:47:20,460
Yeah,
he's barefoot and everything.

2588
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:21,540
I might,
yeah.

2589
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,370
Oh yeah,
I got my hat.

2590
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:27,360
So yeah.
So just all these instances like this,

2591
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:28,390
literally,
I hate to,

2592
01:47:29,530 --> 01:47:33,690
but this why I hunt like that stuff.
I'm not,

2593
01:47:33,691 --> 01:47:36,480
I'm probably not going on a photo safari
ever in my entire life.

2594
01:47:36,481 --> 01:47:40,350
I'm not climbing Mount Everest unless
there's something at the top that I'm

2595
01:47:40,410 --> 01:47:41,230
need.

2596
01:47:41,230 --> 01:47:43,660
It's just not men.
My DNA is not who I am,

2597
01:47:43,870 --> 01:47:45,780
but,
but going out to,

2598
01:47:46,170 --> 01:47:48,780
um,
kill a water buffalo in Australia

2599
01:47:48,781 --> 01:47:51,300
because they're not only are they
overpopulated,

2600
01:47:51,301 --> 01:47:54,150
they're absolutely decimating the
country and they're not supposed to be

2601
01:47:54,151 --> 01:47:54,551
there.
No,

2602
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:55,620
I mean,
he killed them all.

2603
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:59,580
You could snap your fingers right now,
kill every buffalo in on the continent

2604
01:47:59,581 --> 01:48:01,950
of Australia and you'd be doing nothing
but helping that place.

2605
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:03,060
Right.
And so,

2606
01:48:03,061 --> 01:48:05,610
um,
those are the kinds of engagements that

2607
01:48:05,611 --> 01:48:06,390
I love,
right.

2608
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:08,490
Going there and seeing these things,
you're not going to see him unless

2609
01:48:08,491 --> 01:48:10,500
you're there and you're not gonna see
him unless you're there for very long

2610
01:48:10,501 --> 01:48:11,760
time.
Yeah.

2611
01:48:12,110 --> 01:48:17,110
Being in the woods and seeing wildlife
in its wild environment is a crazy

2612
01:48:17,661 --> 01:48:19,910
experience.
I was telling my friend Colton,

2613
01:48:19,911 --> 01:48:24,911
he's a guide in Utah and I was saying,
you guys should have a thing for people

2614
01:48:25,221 --> 01:48:28,430
that have zero desire to hunt and let
them,

2615
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:31,430
like take them,
put them in full cammo and have them

2616
01:48:31,431 --> 01:48:36,431
creep through the woods during the Rut
and watch these elk scream at each other

2617
01:48:36,441 --> 01:48:39,470
and communicate and just,
just to be around them is amazing.

2618
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:42,080
It's a,
it's an amazing cause then to know that

2619
01:48:42,081 --> 01:48:44,690
these things have done this for
thousands,

2620
01:48:44,691 --> 01:48:48,410
if not millions of years.
I mean they've found whitetail deer

2621
01:48:48,411 --> 01:48:53,411
skulls in Florida that have been age to
over a million years.

2622
01:48:54,230 --> 01:48:59,230
So they know that they've been in that
form and likely elk as well in that form

2623
01:48:59,421 --> 01:49:01,790
for a fucking million,
maybe even more years.

2624
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:03,890
These things.
This is what they've done.

2625
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:06,440
They've done it forever.
And to be around them when they don't

2626
01:49:06,441 --> 01:49:07,840
know you're there.
Um,

2627
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,900
we did this,
a film for underarmor,

2628
01:49:09,970 --> 01:49:14,000
me and a Cam Haynes,
and we went elk hunting and Utah and we,

2629
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:16,280
we were in this,
uh,

2630
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:21,500
this wooded area watching these elk that
were in this meadow by a stream.

2631
01:49:21,501 --> 01:49:24,830
And we sat there waiting for a shot
opportunity for like,

2632
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:28,220
like an hour or so watching them.
They had no idea we were there.

2633
01:49:28,221 --> 01:49:29,570
And you know,
some of them were 15,

2634
01:49:29,571 --> 01:49:30,290
20 yards.
Well,

2635
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:31,101
yeah.
And I was like,

2636
01:49:31,101 --> 01:49:33,590
this is the cra,
it just to be around them when they

2637
01:49:33,591 --> 01:49:35,720
don't know you're there.
It's so amazing.

2638
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:37,200
Yeah.
Wash and breathe.

2639
01:49:37,201 --> 01:49:39,000
Washington week.
We did it last year with,

2640
01:49:39,001 --> 01:49:40,240
um,
uh,

2641
01:49:40,290 --> 01:49:43,230
men's health and article on us.
And um,

2642
01:49:43,290 --> 01:49:44,970
so we took,
it was trippy.

2643
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,530
Like I'm talking to the art director at
men's hall.

2644
01:49:47,531 --> 01:49:52,120
She's in downtown Manhattan.
They have no idea what life is about.

2645
01:49:52,121 --> 01:49:53,800
So she's like,
he had Donnie.

2646
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:55,960
So what we're gonna do is we're going to
have you and your crew.

2647
01:49:55,961 --> 01:50:00,220
So there's three in my crew and then
we're going to have a photographer,

2648
01:50:00,221 --> 01:50:03,070
photographers assistant,
and then we'll have the writer with you.

2649
01:50:03,190 --> 01:50:04,930
Well good luck.
So I'm just like,

2650
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:07,750
all right.
So I'm stocking bull elk and I've never

2651
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:10,150
elk hunted before,
so I have no idea what I'm doing other

2652
01:50:10,151 --> 01:50:14,020
than what I've read about.
And so I'm stocking these bowls with six

2653
01:50:14,021 --> 01:50:15,670
people.
And they asked me like,

2654
01:50:15,671 --> 01:50:17,020
Hey,
do we have to wear camouflage that no,

2655
01:50:17,021 --> 01:50:18,040
you don't have to wear camouflage.

2656
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:20,320
And they said,
well what is there anything we shouldn't

2657
01:50:20,321 --> 01:50:20,861
wear?
And I said,

2658
01:50:20,861 --> 01:50:24,700
just try not to wear anything with a
really bright start colors and try not

2659
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:26,740
to wear any bright yellows.
Cause that's the spectrum.

2660
01:50:26,741 --> 01:50:29,940
That elk scene and the photographer,
photographer assistant shows off with

2661
01:50:29,950 --> 01:50:31,990
just,
I mean like canary,

2662
01:50:31,991 --> 01:50:33,760
yellow pants,
skinny jeans.

2663
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:37,090
And I'm like eight from Ohi.
Where's a little high that's here,

2664
01:50:37,091 --> 01:50:38,330
right in southern California.
Yeah.

2665
01:50:38,331 --> 01:50:40,400
So they're from Ohio.
And um,

2666
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:43,150
but it was wicked cause we snuck up to
eight.

2667
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:46,510
We got to 18 yards from the six by six,
all of us,

2668
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:49,000
six of us,
18 yards from the six by six.

2669
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:53,110
And what was crazy is there staring at
the six by six,

2670
01:50:53,111 --> 01:50:55,510
like all of their jaws are on the
ground,

2671
01:50:55,930 --> 01:51:00,010
but I'm staring at them because I really
don't care about the six by six.

2672
01:51:00,011 --> 01:51:01,300
He's too young.
I'm not going to shoot him.

2673
01:51:01,301 --> 01:51:04,540
But I loved,
I was addicted to their reactions and

2674
01:51:04,541 --> 01:51:07,330
they're just like,
and the elk Wa actually,

2675
01:51:07,331 --> 01:51:10,240
so we're staring at them,
the elk staring at these guys.

2676
01:51:10,241 --> 01:51:12,070
I'm staring at them.
I'm just like taking this on.

2677
01:51:12,110 --> 01:51:13,060
I'm like,
this is pretty Rad.

2678
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:18,450
Nevada Shell Creek range in Nevada.
Um,

2679
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,040
and so we're sending,
all of a sudden the elk looks to its

2680
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:25,780
left really sharply.
And so I look over and there's a coyote

2681
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:29,800
10 yards from us staring at the ELAC.
And then all these guys are seeing the

2682
01:51:29,801 --> 01:51:31,030
Chi out there,
seeing the ELAC.

2683
01:51:31,031 --> 01:51:33,910
And then everything runs away.
And I turn around and look at these guys

2684
01:51:33,911 --> 01:51:36,400
and they're just like,
oh,

2685
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:37,990
like,
um,

2686
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:39,880
the one photographer,
he's like,

2687
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:44,860
that was a literal monster.
And it was like a three year old,

2688
01:51:44,861 --> 01:51:47,710
six by six and four year old,
66 and he's like that thing.

2689
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:51,700
And like I just shut up and I'm just
living in these guys and they're just

2690
01:51:51,701 --> 01:51:54,250
Jay and now two of the three of them on
a hunt,

2691
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:56,860
they'd never hunt in their lives.
Now that writer,

2692
01:51:56,861 --> 01:51:59,140
writer Michael Easter,
he really wants to hunt and he's

2693
01:51:59,141 --> 01:52:00,820
actually going to go on another hunt
with me I think.

2694
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:04,230
And next year I'm going to spend like 40
days in the Yukon territories,

2695
01:52:04,270 --> 01:52:08,080
just walking from one end to this
concession that a friend of mine has

2696
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:11,020
like four and a half million acres.
We're going to try to walk from one half

2697
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:14,440
Kinda to the other half if you will,
in hunting our way through just kind of

2698
01:52:14,441 --> 01:52:15,610
doing journal,
hunt film,

2699
01:52:15,611 --> 01:52:18,070
the whole thing.
Beautifully tried to and tell a story

2700
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:21,400
and he wants to go along and write a
book about the experience.

2701
01:52:21,970 --> 01:52:22,803
Yeah.
And so,

2702
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:24,700
but that's the thing.
It's like all these guys,

2703
01:52:24,701 --> 01:52:26,470
like they just,
just to see their look,

2704
01:52:26,471 --> 01:52:28,830
seeing this bull elk right there and
like in,

2705
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:31,030
they're watching him and he,
he put on quite a show.

2706
01:52:31,031 --> 01:52:32,500
He didn't bugle.
I really wish you would have,

2707
01:52:32,501 --> 01:52:35,410
although they heard bugles cause we
camped at 12,000 feet.

2708
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:37,180
I made them hike all the way up to the
top.

2709
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:38,950
I'm like man,
if we're camping cabin at the tippity

2710
01:52:38,951 --> 01:52:41,240
top,
I want you guys to like just experience.

2711
01:52:41,241 --> 01:52:45,470
And so bugles would echo out at night
around the canyon but they watched him

2712
01:52:45,471 --> 01:52:47,540
eat and he,
he made a rob and just,

2713
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:49,910
you know,
mess this trip with his antlers and they

2714
01:52:49,911 --> 01:52:52,460
just there.
It was wicked great experience.

2715
01:52:52,461 --> 01:52:54,200
But I agree with you.
I think people like,

2716
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:57,590
let's put some camouflage or hell where
yellow pants,

2717
01:52:57,630 --> 01:52:59,630
yellow where yellow skinny jeans if you
want.

2718
01:52:59,631 --> 01:53:03,530
And you're flat bill hat from Ohi and
let's go sneak up on l fuck flat bill

2719
01:53:03,531 --> 01:53:04,620
hats.
I'm saying it.

2720
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:05,270
Yup.
No,

2721
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:06,230
I'm sorry Jim.
Yup,

2722
01:53:06,290 --> 01:53:08,870
just kid.
This has a small curvature.

2723
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,820
Just a small,
small curvature.

2724
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:11,570
No,
he's,

2725
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:14,090
he's been on a cavaliers tear over the
last few days.

2726
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:16,280
All sorts of different hats on.
Um,

2727
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:17,240
the,
the,

2728
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:18,350
just,
I think that,

2729
01:53:18,351 --> 01:53:20,120
uh,
what I was saying to these guys is like,

2730
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:22,730
you would,
without even having to have a tag,

2731
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,990
like you guys could guide these people
and it wouldn't be a dent and the

2732
01:53:26,991 --> 01:53:30,140
resources,
it wouldn't diminish the population.

2733
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:30,860
No,
but it would,

2734
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:34,670
it would be,
it's an educational experience and just,

2735
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:37,580
there's ripples that come from that are
those people are going to go back and

2736
01:53:37,581 --> 01:53:40,250
tell other people about it.
And it's one thing to go to the zoo,

2737
01:53:40,251 --> 01:53:42,980
but you go to the zoo.
It's the most unnatural environment,

2738
01:53:42,981 --> 01:53:44,990
the world where animals are looking you
right in the eye and they're not

2739
01:53:44,991 --> 01:53:47,690
freaking out that that has nothing to do
with what you're talking about.

2740
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:49,880
Those two things you can see,
and I'll cut at the zoo,

2741
01:53:49,881 --> 01:53:53,400
but you can't watch an elk.
The elk is not an alk.

2742
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:55,130
It's a,
it's a farm animal.

2743
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:58,250
It's just not the same.
When you see one in the wild and

2744
01:53:58,251 --> 01:54:00,470
they're,
their noses are flaring and they're

2745
01:54:00,471 --> 01:54:01,770
smelling the air.
And they're,

2746
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:06,260
their ears are twitching left and right.
It's scanning for noises and you realize

2747
01:54:06,261 --> 01:54:06,711
like,
wow,

2748
01:54:06,711 --> 01:54:09,740
this thing is out there fucking earning,
hustling,

2749
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:10,970
you know,
eating grass,

2750
01:54:10,971 --> 01:54:12,110
trying to stay alive.

2751
01:54:12,110 --> 01:54:14,030
And if,
if it gets to,

2752
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:16,130
you know,
like that elk that I have out there was

2753
01:54:16,131 --> 01:54:19,670
nine years old,
a nine year old animal that's out there

2754
01:54:19,671 --> 01:54:24,671
surviving against mountain lions and
bears and just figuring out a way to get

2755
01:54:25,071 --> 01:54:28,760
through and keep surviving,
get through those winters,

2756
01:54:28,761 --> 01:54:30,620
make it to spring,
keep going,

2757
01:54:30,621 --> 01:54:32,510
keep going.
I mean that is uh,

2758
01:54:32,590 --> 01:54:34,430
it's,
it's an amazing animal.

2759
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:36,740
Has a story.
The thing has a story and you,

2760
01:54:36,741 --> 01:54:38,870
and if you sit down,
you know,

2761
01:54:38,930 --> 01:54:40,490
I'm sure you were sad when you kill
them,

2762
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:44,630
but you sit down and,
and I'm sure you were euphoric as hell

2763
01:54:44,631 --> 01:54:49,610
that your plan finally worked because
you've watched it fail 2000 times.

2764
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:53,720
So you sit there with your kind of holy
crap moment of this actually happened

2765
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:56,810
and he's actually dead now.
And you know,

2766
01:54:56,811 --> 01:54:58,760
you have the sorrow of taking an
animal's life,

2767
01:54:58,761 --> 01:55:01,040
but then you sit there and you have any
perspective at all.

2768
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:03,570
You think about those nine years,
just like you just did you think like

2769
01:55:03,590 --> 01:55:05,960
any minute of those nine years and he'd
say much like sheep,

2770
01:55:05,961 --> 01:55:06,794
you know,
or like,

2771
01:55:06,930 --> 01:55:08,420
um,
your water buffalo back here,

2772
01:55:08,421 --> 01:55:09,560
like this is horn,
right?

2773
01:55:09,561 --> 01:55:13,040
So they don't lose it every year that
the l cast their antlers off every year

2774
01:55:13,041 --> 01:55:14,090
and grow new ones,
which is,

2775
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:18,050
I think it's fastest growing biological
substance known to man.

2776
01:55:18,051 --> 01:55:19,270
Right.
So crazy.

2777
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:20,730
But,
but these things have horn,

2778
01:55:20,731 --> 01:55:23,780
so it's made out of like fingernail.
So you literally can sit there with your

2779
01:55:23,781 --> 01:55:28,250
buffalo and track your fingernail or a
big horn sheep are dall sheep and drag

2780
01:55:28,251 --> 01:55:31,520
your finger nail through these little
cracks and you see the splits and cracks

2781
01:55:31,521 --> 01:55:33,140
and you're like,
you know,

2782
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:37,190
what was a bad winter and what was a
great spring?

2783
01:55:37,191 --> 01:55:38,990
And when did the wolves chase you?
And,

2784
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:41,180
um,
when did you almost lose your life in a

2785
01:55:41,181 --> 01:55:43,880
fight?
And when like I wish,

2786
01:55:44,030 --> 01:55:45,720
you know,
I wish we could kind of hold on to these

2787
01:55:45,721 --> 01:55:49,500
things and kind of go through a little
montage of what to sing live through,

2788
01:55:49,501 --> 01:55:51,120
you know?
But that's the only thing we can do is

2789
01:55:51,121 --> 01:55:54,840
insert ourselves into the wilderness for
a short amount of time or as much time

2790
01:55:54,841 --> 01:55:56,110
as we can afford and,
and,

2791
01:55:56,130 --> 01:55:59,520
and
convince ourselves that that's where we

2792
01:55:59,521 --> 01:56:01,440
still live.
Yeah,

2793
01:56:01,530 --> 01:56:03,270
I mean that just

2794
01:56:03,550 --> 01:56:06,100
the relationship that we have with
nature I think is,

2795
01:56:06,190 --> 01:56:08,830
it's taken such a bizarre turn because
of cities.

2796
01:56:09,370 --> 01:56:14,080
I think that what we've done also in our
relationship with animals,

2797
01:56:14,081 --> 01:56:18,100
by putting them in these little animal
prisons that we call zoos and having

2798
01:56:18,101 --> 01:56:21,730
people go and stare at them and some
very unnatural way,

2799
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:27,180
we've really distorted the majesty of
wildlife and nature.

2800
01:56:27,790 --> 01:56:29,560
And the only,
in my opinion,

2801
01:56:29,561 --> 01:56:33,730
the only real way to appreciate what an,
what an animal is,

2802
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,690
is to see an animal in the wild to see
it in its habitat.

2803
01:56:37,691 --> 01:56:40,180
And until that happens,
until you do that,

2804
01:56:40,181 --> 01:56:42,280
you really,
you could see a,

2805
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:45,730
you know,
a giraffe at the zoo and they're pretty

2806
01:56:45,731 --> 01:56:47,380
majestic.
They're really crazy.

2807
01:56:47,381 --> 01:56:50,410
And they're one of the weirdest animals
too because they let little kids feed

2808
01:56:50,411 --> 01:56:51,191
them.
I mean,

2809
01:56:51,191 --> 01:56:56,191
they're so confident in their behavior.
Ms. I had a a bit about it in my act and

2810
01:56:56,231 --> 01:56:58,810
that,
like you say that animals don't belong

2811
01:56:58,811 --> 01:56:59,260
in the zoo.

2812
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:00,360
I'm like,
I,

2813
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:05,500
I agree with you except for giraffes.
Xerox don't seem to have any fucking

2814
01:57:05,531 --> 01:57:07,270
problem with the zoo.
They love it.

2815
01:57:07,450 --> 01:57:10,030
Yeah.
My joke was that they're like another

2816
01:57:10,031 --> 01:57:13,480
day with no lions and they're just
wandering around having a great old

2817
01:57:13,481 --> 01:57:14,314
time.
They,

2818
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:16,840
I mean they,
they're so confident that like when my

2819
01:57:16,841 --> 01:57:19,390
daughter was two,
we brought her to the zoo and they'll

2820
01:57:19,391 --> 01:57:22,180
let a two year old hold a piece of
lettuce up for a giraffe.

2821
01:57:22,210 --> 01:57:23,290
They just fucking,
no.

2822
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:26,260
Yeah.
But if you saw a g,

2823
01:57:26,290 --> 01:57:27,730
like I said,
the first time I ever saw him,

2824
01:57:27,731 --> 01:57:30,610
I was from my friend Mike Hawk Ridge and
my friend Ben O'brian,

2825
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:32,380
the first time I ever saw a moose in the
wild,

2826
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:36,220
we pulled the car over and it was like
that scene in Jurassic Park when Jeff

2827
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:38,260
Goldbloom sticks his head out of the
jeep and he's like,

2828
01:57:38,290 --> 01:57:41,650
wow.
Like you see one in the wild,

2829
01:57:41,651 --> 01:57:45,340
you realize how big they really are.
And this thing was just walking through

2830
01:57:45,341 --> 01:57:48,100
this open field in the woods and we were
like,

2831
01:57:48,101 --> 01:57:51,430
Holy Shit.
Look at the size of that thing.

2832
01:57:51,910 --> 01:57:54,880
Filmmaker killed by Giraffe by working
in South Africa.

2833
01:57:55,030 --> 01:57:56,080
Oh yeah.
He got headbutted,

2834
01:57:56,081 --> 01:57:56,980
right?
Yeah.

2835
01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:58,300
That's how they do it.
Oh yeah.

2836
01:57:58,301 --> 01:57:58,801
They,
they,

2837
01:57:58,801 --> 01:58:03,580
they use their head like a whip.
We showed a film of these two battling

2838
01:58:03,581 --> 01:58:06,220
these two bulls,
slam each other with their heads.

2839
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:07,830
It's fucking crazy.
Total.

2840
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:10,090
Yeah.
As is anything that lives out there.

2841
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:11,770
That's a way to go.
Huh?

2842
01:58:11,830 --> 01:58:14,440
Get killed by a giraffe.
You didn't even see it.

2843
01:58:14,441 --> 01:58:16,300
He was looking through the camera.
Oh,

2844
01:58:16,301 --> 01:58:17,134
no,
no.

2845
01:58:17,470 --> 01:58:18,910
Oh yeah.
He still thinks she's looking through a

2846
01:58:18,911 --> 01:58:21,640
camera right now.
He probably is some of the dimension.

2847
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:23,130
Yeah.
It's like what happened?

2848
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:24,220
Oh,
everyone's gone.

2849
01:58:24,370 --> 01:58:25,630
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2850
01:58:25,631 --> 01:58:29,020
That had to be lights out and that's
back to the grizzly bear hunting thing.

2851
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:30,490
That's it.
That's the unfortunate thing,

2852
01:58:30,491 --> 01:58:32,110
right?
It's all those people that closed down

2853
01:58:32,111 --> 01:58:34,210
hunting.
They never even,

2854
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,710
they all,
I would,

2855
01:58:35,740 --> 01:58:40,740
I would venture a guess that anyone that
voted on that ballot has never seen a

2856
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:42,130
bear or Bennett

2857
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:45,820
grizzly bear territory or participated
at all in understanding how that

2858
01:58:45,821 --> 01:58:49,240
ecosystem works isn't in a very small
percentage of people.

2859
01:58:49,241 --> 01:58:53,710
It was a very small number of people and
they got the information from an email

2860
01:58:53,711 --> 01:58:54,620
list.
Right.

2861
01:58:54,730 --> 01:58:58,180
I think the people,
I think it was less than 3000 people.

2862
01:58:58,240 --> 01:58:59,800
Yeah,
something really crazy.

2863
01:58:59,801 --> 01:59:02,980
Which heil of misinformation and a and
rumor.

2864
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:07,480
Well it's also if you talk to the actual
wildlife biologists and maybe even more

2865
01:59:07,481 --> 01:59:10,210
importantly the people that are in the
field on a daily basis,

2866
01:59:10,211 --> 01:59:13,240
like there is no pop,
no problem with the grizzly bear

2867
01:59:13,241 --> 01:59:15,070
population in British Columbia.
In fact,

2868
01:59:15,071 --> 01:59:20,071
it's thriving and it's a giant animal
that eats a lot of meat and it's out

2869
01:59:20,681 --> 01:59:22,960
there,
taken out a lot of calves right now as

2870
01:59:22,961 --> 01:59:24,610
we speak,
and now that they can't hunt them,

2871
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:28,060
they're very likely to have a situation
where they're going to have to hire

2872
01:59:28,061 --> 01:59:29,650
people to shoot problem bears.

2873
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:33,430
Absolutely.
The first eco tour that goes down where

2874
01:59:33,431 --> 01:59:38,431
a a boat full or a bus full or a hiking
group watches a boar kill and eat

2875
01:59:40,061 --> 01:59:43,600
triplets,
kill and eat three football or

2876
01:59:43,601 --> 01:59:46,960
watermelon sized cubs and rip them to
shreds and eat them while they're

2877
01:59:46,961 --> 01:59:50,140
bawling and trying to get to their mom
and then have him killed her mom.

2878
01:59:50,570 --> 01:59:52,420
Once that goes down and be like,
okay,

2879
01:59:52,421 --> 01:59:54,300
I think we might have a couple too many
barriers here,

2880
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:56,830
so now we're again,
but that happens every day even in a

2881
01:59:56,831 --> 01:59:58,990
great,
not everyday but it happens often even

2882
01:59:58,991 --> 02:00:02,920
in a good population but now that
they've shut down any killing

2883
02:00:02,921 --> 02:00:05,140
whatsoever,
these things have no predators other

2884
02:00:05,141 --> 02:00:07,990
from old bores that become giant bullies
on the block.

2885
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:09,640
Yeah.
What are they going to do about that?

2886
02:00:09,641 --> 02:00:14,380
Because apparently there is some sort of
a movement to try to educate people and

2887
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:17,890
get them to understand what they've done
by making this hunt illegal.

2888
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:23,260
But what I would like to see is people
also be educated on the fact like what

2889
02:00:23,261 --> 02:00:26,050
you said,
that these animals are actually edible

2890
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,990
and that instead,
maybe the part of the problem is the

2891
02:00:28,991 --> 02:00:31,900
fact that these people are just taking
the head in the hide and leaving behind

2892
02:00:31,901 --> 02:00:35,050
the meat.
And if you were responsible for not just

2893
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:39,430
taking the meat but showing that you're
consuming it and then teaching these

2894
02:00:39,431 --> 02:00:41,950
people how to cook it and then how to
prepare it and,

2895
02:00:42,150 --> 02:00:47,150
and make them realize like you should be
using this thing is in its entirety as a

2896
02:00:47,531 --> 02:00:50,230
resource.
And don't just think about it as this

2897
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:53,170
fucking rug or this,
you know,

2898
02:00:53,171 --> 02:00:54,760
skull that you're going to have on your
wall.

2899
02:00:54,850 --> 02:00:56,770
And that's the problem.
I think that's the problem.

2900
02:00:56,771 --> 02:00:58,510
I don't know.
But I think that's the problem because

2901
02:00:58,511 --> 02:00:59,620
if people,
if people,

2902
02:00:59,621 --> 02:01:02,050
and some people do think this,
I get letters like this all the time

2903
02:01:02,051 --> 02:01:03,370
where people say,
let me get this straight.

2904
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:06,970
So,
and it always happens after we posted a

2905
02:01:06,971 --> 02:01:08,860
picture of me with an animal in my
backpack,

2906
02:01:09,730 --> 02:01:10,690
elk,
antlers or whatever.

2907
02:01:10,691 --> 02:01:11,770
They're like,
Oh yup,

2908
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:13,960
I can see it.
You know how many meet in that backpack?

2909
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:15,220
And I tell him like,
look,

2910
02:01:15,250 --> 02:01:19,090
my first four backpack loads were meat.
I'm taking the head out last.

2911
02:01:19,091 --> 02:01:21,250
That's how we do it.
The head goes out last because it's the

2912
02:01:21,251 --> 02:01:22,930
least of importance.
It holds the,

2913
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:26,080
the least importance.
And so the hide in the head go out last.

2914
02:01:26,081 --> 02:01:29,650
So if you take a picture of a backpack
full of meat,

2915
02:01:29,651 --> 02:01:32,560
it looks like a backpack,
cause the meats inside.

2916
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:34,240
So it looks like you're wearing a
backpack.

2917
02:01:34,241 --> 02:01:38,680
So,
and we purposefully did one last year in

2918
02:01:38,681 --> 02:01:40,010
Nevada.
You can see

2919
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:43,200
the elks hooves sticking out of the top
of the backpack.

2920
02:01:43,201 --> 02:01:46,220
So people realize like,
we are moving quarters and we publish

2921
02:01:46,221 --> 02:01:48,560
these photos.
But so people will Ryan and say,

2922
02:01:48,561 --> 02:01:49,490
seat,
let me get this straight.

2923
02:01:49,491 --> 02:01:51,080
You kill the deer.
You take its life,

2924
02:01:51,530 --> 02:01:53,600
you take it's hide.
And he'd take his antlers and you just

2925
02:01:53,601 --> 02:01:56,240
take it home in mountain and you leave
everything else to rot and said,

2926
02:01:56,270 --> 02:01:56,491
no,
no,

2927
02:01:56,491 --> 02:01:57,740
no.
But it says that it's,

2928
02:01:57,820 --> 02:01:58,730
they,
they're ignorant.

2929
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:01,340
They're not paying any attention.
Well the there whatsoever.

2930
02:02:01,370 --> 02:02:03,690
That's willful ignorance because you
could find that out in,

2931
02:02:03,691 --> 02:02:06,620
first of all,
everyone knows that deer's delicious

2932
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:09,680
deer,
venison and elk in particular.

2933
02:02:09,710 --> 02:02:13,490
It's delicious meat.
The fact that you would even consider

2934
02:02:13,491 --> 02:02:15,110
leaving that behind,
it's crazy.

2935
02:02:15,111 --> 02:02:17,300
Nobody does that.
I've never heard of anybody doing that.

2936
02:02:17,301 --> 02:02:20,570
I know I've heard of it,
but I've heard a lot of fear in elk.

2937
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:21,321
Not,
not in,

2938
02:02:21,321 --> 02:02:22,550
not in,
not in reality.

2939
02:02:22,551 --> 02:02:23,720
I've just heard of it.
Right.

2940
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:25,400
I've heard people saying,
oh yeah,

2941
02:02:25,401 --> 02:02:28,160
it's what they used to do.
It's what they did and you know,

2942
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:31,120
I couldn't even imagine that as a
scenario in,

2943
02:02:31,170 --> 02:02:32,540
in today's Day.
I mean,

2944
02:02:32,860 --> 02:02:36,560
the meat is so good.
I've had people at my house before,

2945
02:02:36,561 --> 02:02:38,360
they've never eaten elk and I've cooked
it for him.

2946
02:02:38,361 --> 02:02:39,830
They're like,
Holy Shit.

2947
02:02:40,220 --> 02:02:43,040
Because it has a,
there's a feeling you get from eating it

2948
02:02:43,041 --> 02:02:45,020
too.
It almost like his energy in it.

2949
02:02:45,290 --> 02:02:46,910
I get charges you up.
Yeah.

2950
02:02:46,970 --> 02:02:49,520
It's a,
it's such a potent protein and so

2951
02:02:49,521 --> 02:02:52,480
delicious.
I said that with leave that behind me.

2952
02:02:52,550 --> 02:02:54,140
That should be a crime.
Yeah.

2953
02:02:54,141 --> 02:02:54,701
I mean,
I,

2954
02:02:54,701 --> 02:02:55,580
I if,
if,

2955
02:02:55,730 --> 02:02:57,500
if anything,
I've seen it go the other way.

2956
02:02:57,530 --> 02:03:01,100
I've seen hunters argue over their
share,

2957
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:02,690
right?
Like if you're sharing an elk with a

2958
02:03:02,691 --> 02:03:04,370
friend or you went on a hunt and one you
kill.

2959
02:03:04,370 --> 02:03:05,031
Okay.
So like,

2960
02:03:05,031 --> 02:03:06,350
well how much do I get?
You know,

2961
02:03:06,610 --> 02:03:08,390
I've seen guys argue over that more than
anything.

2962
02:03:08,391 --> 02:03:10,580
And I sent,
I sent elk meat to a,

2963
02:03:10,581 --> 02:03:12,100
the writer of men's health,
um,

2964
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:15,950
who's writing the article cause I ended
up killing the elk two days after he

2965
02:03:15,951 --> 02:03:17,450
left,
he had to go on another story and I

2966
02:03:17,451 --> 02:03:18,440
ended up killing you Alex.
So he's like,

2967
02:03:18,441 --> 02:03:20,120
Hey,
will you send me a box of meat so I can

2968
02:03:20,121 --> 02:03:21,830
try it?
Cause I feel like I was really a part of

2969
02:03:21,831 --> 02:03:23,900
this hunt and I did so.
And he's just like,

2970
02:03:23,901 --> 02:03:25,340
yeah,
he,

2971
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:29,370
I mean he wrote about in the article but
it's in the last paragraph forever.

2972
02:03:29,390 --> 02:03:31,100
But he sent me a text message and he's
just like,

2973
02:03:31,101 --> 02:03:33,560
are you freaking kidding me?
This is the funniest thing I've ever

2974
02:03:33,561 --> 02:03:34,800
eaten in my life.
And he's like,

2975
02:03:34,801 --> 02:03:37,970
it's prepared correctly,
but you have to learn how to do that

2976
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:38,813
too.

2977
02:03:38,910 --> 02:03:39,561
And he's,
you know,

2978
02:03:39,561 --> 02:03:41,270
he's seared everything.
He talked to us and we told you,

2979
02:03:41,271 --> 02:03:43,430
you want to keep it like really medium
rare and just,

2980
02:03:44,530 --> 02:03:45,650
he just loved it.
He loved it.

2981
02:03:45,651 --> 02:03:46,341
And,
and uh,

2982
02:03:46,341 --> 02:03:50,270
and he talked about like all those days
that he hiked with us in the mountains,

2983
02:03:51,110 --> 02:03:52,880
you know,
he remarked that he could taste that in

2984
02:03:52,881 --> 02:03:53,780
the flesh.
Right.

2985
02:03:53,810 --> 02:03:57,320
He felt that he felt that connection.
Now he's like big time wants to,

2986
02:03:57,650 --> 02:03:59,930
wants to start hunting first food.
Yeah.

2987
02:03:59,931 --> 02:04:03,170
I always tell people,
if you really want to start hunting,

2988
02:04:03,171 --> 02:04:07,430
you really want to do it.
It's so difficult to get started.

2989
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:12,520
It's so difficult to even find the
resources to take the first steps.

2990
02:04:13,580 --> 02:04:15,440
Like what do you do?
And people that say,

2991
02:04:15,470 --> 02:04:16,610
I want to bow hunt.
I'm like,

2992
02:04:16,611 --> 02:04:19,130
listen man,
first of all,

2993
02:04:19,131 --> 02:04:21,740
you need to learn how to shoot a bow.
And second of all,

2994
02:04:22,130 --> 02:04:25,850
by saying that you want to bow hunt,
what you're saying to me is I want to

2995
02:04:25,851 --> 02:04:30,800
practice 300 days a year with my bow.
I want to really learn archery.

2996
02:04:30,830 --> 02:04:34,520
I want to learn the proper form.
I want to learn mental control.

2997
02:04:34,700 --> 02:04:38,430
I want to learn the ability to say,
to keep your mind

2998
02:04:38,790 --> 02:04:39,601
in,
in,

2999
02:04:39,601 --> 02:04:44,220
in the moment while you're under extreme
anxiety and facing an animal,

3000
02:04:44,221 --> 02:04:47,700
to understand how to range an animal,
how to,

3001
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:50,940
what's the proper yardage,
where's the proper shot placement?

3002
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:54,210
You're talking about a lifestyle.
You're talking about literally changing

3003
02:04:54,211 --> 02:04:55,890
your life.
This is not,

3004
02:04:55,920 --> 02:05:00,330
don't say I want to go bow hunting.
Like I want to go deep sea fishing on a

3005
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:02,820
charter.
They put the fee,

3006
02:05:02,850 --> 02:05:04,860
the bait on the hook,
drop it in,

3007
02:05:04,861 --> 02:05:06,630
and I just really the the,
the fish,

3008
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:08,460
that's,
that's possible.

3009
02:05:08,510 --> 02:05:10,140
Yeah.
That's saying I want to go bow hunting.

3010
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:11,250
Like,
you know,

3011
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:13,380
they see you do it and they go,
oh,

3012
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:14,430
you bow hunt.
Yup.

3013
02:05:15,090 --> 02:05:17,460
Okay.
But I'm crazy and I've been obsessed

3014
02:05:17,461 --> 02:05:21,120
with this shit for years and I practice
every day and you go to my backyard,

3015
02:05:21,150 --> 02:05:25,110
I've got fucking rubber elk sitting on a
hillside and I shoot at him every day

3016
02:05:25,111 --> 02:05:26,040
before I do anything.

3017
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:28,230
So how much do you want to do it?
Yeah.

3018
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:31,230
How much do you really want to do it?
Because you first have to come on

3019
02:05:31,231 --> 02:05:32,310
archer.
Yes.

3020
02:05:32,311 --> 02:05:36,930
Then you have to learn something about
hunting and now you have to actually get

3021
02:05:36,931 --> 02:05:40,920
out of your truck and take a bunch of
steps into the Wilderness and hope you

3022
02:05:40,921 --> 02:05:45,230
can even just get back to your truck,
let alone finding an animal,

3023
02:05:45,231 --> 02:05:48,060
illegal animal sneaking into within
archery range,

3024
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:51,330
killing him quickly.
Dismembering them,

3025
02:05:51,331 --> 02:05:52,150
getting them.
I mean,

3026
02:05:52,150 --> 02:05:55,110
it's gotta be in shape.
The other thing that freaked me out when

3027
02:05:55,111 --> 02:05:59,000
I first went hunting,
I was in shape as far as like Jujitsu,

3028
02:05:59,080 --> 02:05:59,811
martial art,
Shay,

3029
02:05:59,811 --> 02:06:04,811
but fucking hiking with a backpack on
and altitude and you're going up and

3030
02:06:05,431 --> 02:06:08,010
down and up and down.
It's like an hours a day like,

3031
02:06:08,070 --> 02:06:08,791
oh,
okay,

3032
02:06:08,791 --> 02:06:10,710
you gotta be conditioned for this shit.

3033
02:06:10,710 --> 02:06:11,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

3034
02:06:11,850 --> 02:06:13,260
I think if you want to,
I mean,

3035
02:06:13,290 --> 02:06:18,120
I think the way to do it if somebody
really wants to is really wild pigs,

3036
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:22,440
wild pigs with a gun is probably the
first way you should do it because I

3037
02:06:22,441 --> 02:06:24,750
think first of all,
it has to be done.

3038
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:26,740
This is something that's imperative.
You're,

3039
02:06:26,741 --> 02:06:28,230
you're talking about can't be done
enough.

3040
02:06:28,270 --> 02:06:29,400
It can't be done enough.
Again,

3041
02:06:29,401 --> 02:06:33,450
you could go no wild pigs starting now
and it would be a great,

3042
02:06:33,690 --> 02:06:36,180
it'd be a great service.
It'd be a great service except for

3043
02:06:36,181 --> 02:06:39,540
people enjoy wild pig meat and hunting
because it's awesome.

3044
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:41,460
Yeah,
I mean it's an awesome way to get

3045
02:06:41,461 --> 02:06:43,500
started too.
You go wild pig hunting,

3046
02:06:43,530 --> 02:06:46,260
you're,
you're doing good for the environment.

3047
02:06:46,261 --> 02:06:50,130
This is an invasive species that
devastates ground nesting birds,

3048
02:06:50,131 --> 02:06:53,610
all sorts of plant species and,
and if you're dealing with agriculture

3049
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:55,320
like wow,
you mean then it's really,

3050
02:06:55,321 --> 02:06:58,080
you're talking about a massive financial
burden on farmers,

3051
02:06:58,530 --> 02:07:00,510
but with a rifle,
that's the way to do it because the

3052
02:07:00,511 --> 02:07:02,850
right,
it's so much easier if you have a rifle

3053
02:07:02,851 --> 02:07:05,460
rest and someone can take you to a
range.

3054
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:08,880
The learning curve is so much shorter
than when the bow.

3055
02:07:08,940 --> 02:07:10,080
Yeah,
absolutely.

3056
02:07:10,110 --> 02:07:12,390
100% and that's a great,
that's a great first animal.

3057
02:07:12,391 --> 02:07:13,950
The only other thing that I would maybe
say if,

3058
02:07:13,980 --> 02:07:18,870
if somebody could share with you is to
share a duck blind or something along

3059
02:07:18,871 --> 02:07:21,330
those lines.
Because sometimes it's difficult to wrap

3060
02:07:21,331 --> 02:07:23,400
your head around killing a large animal
first.

3061
02:07:23,401 --> 02:07:25,830
It might help to kill.
As odd as that sounds,

3062
02:07:25,831 --> 02:07:28,770
we're more comfortable with killing
pheasants or grouse or docs or something

3063
02:07:28,771 --> 02:07:29,604
like that.
But,

3064
02:07:29,670 --> 02:07:33,240
um,
that's also a very tricky shot.

3065
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:34,290
And you know,
there's,

3066
02:07:34,291 --> 02:07:37,360
and there's safety there because a
number of people have guns and not

3067
02:07:37,361 --> 02:07:38,820
everyone's paying attention.
So,

3068
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:39,850
yeah.
Yeah.

3069
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:41,210
Yeah.
Have you been the one?

3070
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:42,640
I,
I haven't,

3071
02:07:43,180 --> 02:07:44,120
uh,
I,

3072
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:48,400
I've done it two years in a row now
where we hunt axis deer in Lanai and

3073
02:07:48,401 --> 02:07:50,860
it's another one of those things that
has to be done.

3074
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:56,190
There's something around 3000 people on
the island and more than 20,000 access

3075
02:07:58,991 --> 02:08:01,960
deer.
And it's a very small island and it's

3076
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:04,210
fucking bananas.
I mean,

3077
02:08:04,211 --> 02:08:06,700
we were coming home from,
uh,

3078
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:09,760
w w we got super lucky on the first
night,

3079
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:13,000
the first night a hunting we got out of
the truck.

3080
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:18,030
We set up a target to see if the bows
were in tune shot one arrow at a target

3081
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:21,820
and a Alec.
The guy that I was with went,

3082
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:24,190
fuck,
there's a buck about 200 yards.

3083
02:08:24,191 --> 02:08:25,480
Look right there.
And we're like,

3084
02:08:25,481 --> 02:08:28,300
Holy Shit.
We kicked off our shoes,

3085
02:08:28,330 --> 02:08:30,850
stocked in on him and I killed them
within 15 minutes,

3086
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,630
which is nuts because what the next four
days without killing anything,

3087
02:08:34,631 --> 02:08:36,220
and I finally got another one on the
last day,

3088
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:39,790
but you can shoot as many as 12 day.
And then they want to get rid of all of

3089
02:08:39,791 --> 02:08:42,040
course eating themselves up a house in a
home.

3090
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:42,790
Right?
Yeah.

3091
02:08:42,790 --> 02:08:45,160
It's crazy.
The numbers,

3092
02:08:45,161 --> 02:08:48,070
the numbers are crazy,
but it's also crazy how tuned in these

3093
02:08:48,071 --> 02:08:50,940
things are.
And then they evolved to escape tigers.

3094
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:52,221
Oh yeah,
they're,

3095
02:08:52,221 --> 02:08:55,630
they're from India.
They are fucking switched on.

3096
02:08:55,960 --> 02:08:59,320
They're like a whitetail deer on
steroids and meth.

3097
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:00,280
I mean,
they're like,

3098
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:00,760
what?
What's up?

3099
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:03,610
What's up your own?
And they're gone and they're so fast.

3100
02:09:03,611 --> 02:09:05,770
Man,
I've never seen an animal so fast.

3101
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:06,820
So wicked.
Yeah.

3102
02:09:06,821 --> 02:09:09,550
But it's a good argument for hunting.
It's like,

3103
02:09:09,551 --> 02:09:10,090
well,
here's the,

3104
02:09:10,090 --> 02:09:13,480
here's the situation where the animals
are out there,

3105
02:09:13,481 --> 02:09:17,200
the population is fucked up.
There's no balance of life here.

3106
02:09:17,201 --> 02:09:19,870
This is not like this.
There's no balance here.

3107
02:09:19,871 --> 02:09:23,740
This is completely out of balance and
because of that they hire snipers.

3108
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:25,270
I was just going to shake them.
Yeah.

3109
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:28,180
I'm assuming they hiring guns to come in
at night and shoot them a night.

3110
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:30,160
Scopes are exactly,
that's exactly what,

3111
02:09:30,161 --> 02:09:32,980
just to keep it in,
just to keep it somewhat in check.

3112
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:37,480
But unless you want to let wolves loose
on this island and you know,

3113
02:09:37,481 --> 02:09:39,190
I don't know how else you're going to
fix that.

3114
02:09:39,220 --> 02:09:41,830
You want to put tigers there.
That's what's really supposed to be

3115
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:44,410
catching them.
I actually studied tigers right out of

3116
02:09:44,411 --> 02:09:47,920
college in Bangladesh and Nepal and I
would see,

3117
02:09:47,930 --> 02:09:50,920
I would see access deer there and they
were,

3118
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:52,660
I mean the jungle there.
That was real.

3119
02:09:52,690 --> 02:09:54,340
So like they,
that's why they're looking at

3120
02:09:54,341 --> 02:09:55,061
everything,
right?

3121
02:09:55,061 --> 02:09:56,890
Because you look at a tiger and a zoo
and you're like,

3122
02:09:56,891 --> 02:10:01,240
there's no way that thing can hide,
but then you go to the jungle and

3123
02:10:01,241 --> 02:10:05,290
everything is green.
Except for all the palms that die turned

3124
02:10:05,291 --> 02:10:08,680
bright orange and they all have really
long sharp,

3125
02:10:09,090 --> 02:10:11,700
uh,
frons that look like a tiger stripes.

3126
02:10:11,701 --> 02:10:16,701
He sees little blotches of orange and
black all disappearing into the green

3127
02:10:17,291 --> 02:10:20,500
and so,
but we would see the deer and the deer

3128
02:10:20,501 --> 02:10:22,440
would know,
like when we were going into an area to,

3129
02:10:22,490 --> 02:10:24,790
to either,
we had a cat that was radio collared,

3130
02:10:24,791 --> 02:10:27,730
are going in to look at a particular
piece of habitat.

3131
02:10:28,090 --> 02:10:30,550
The deer were just like on pins and
needles.

3132
02:10:30,551 --> 02:10:32,440
Like we'd get him remotely close and you
could see him.

3133
02:10:32,441 --> 02:10:34,100
We're dealing a lot with islands and
you'd

3134
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:35,810
see him leaving the island on the other
side,

3135
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:37,670
like they'd be ditching the swim to the
next island.

3136
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:39,260
Wow.
Very aware.

3137
02:10:39,261 --> 02:10:42,740
They're extremely aware.
How crazy is it that somehow or another

3138
02:10:42,741 --> 02:10:47,741
the tiger evolve to develop those
stripes that looked like the colors in

3139
02:10:47,841 --> 02:10:50,450
nature?
Like what is the mechanism?

3140
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:52,520
Phenotypical representation.
Yes.

3141
02:10:52,521 --> 02:10:53,870
He's all like,
this is from,

3142
02:10:54,020 --> 02:10:55,100
I don't know where this picture was
taken,

3143
02:10:55,101 --> 02:10:59,390
but this reminds me of like in Nepal and
southern Nepal where I was the Royal

3144
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:01,490
Chitwan National Forest.
They had this grass that grows like 20

3145
02:11:01,491 --> 02:11:03,650
feet tall and I mean just absolutely
disappear.

3146
02:11:03,950 --> 02:11:08,060
But how bizarre is it that this animal
somehow or another evolve this

3147
02:11:08,061 --> 02:11:09,260
camouflage?
Yeah.

3148
02:11:09,530 --> 02:11:13,040
It's so strange.
So strange that that's what's so

3149
02:11:13,041 --> 02:11:13,810
amazing,
you know,

3150
02:11:13,810 --> 02:11:16,260
so the evolution of it and that,
you know,

3151
02:11:16,300 --> 02:11:19,070
this idea of,
of phenotypical their physical

3152
02:11:19,071 --> 02:11:22,010
representation that their genetics is
just so fantastic.

3153
02:11:22,130 --> 02:11:24,650
What did you study in college while
biology?

3154
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:26,750
Yeah,
cause I wanted to,

3155
02:11:27,460 --> 02:11:29,030
you know,
when I got started doing,

3156
02:11:29,260 --> 02:11:30,350
you know,
hunting and things like that,

3157
02:11:30,351 --> 02:11:32,330
I don't come from a hunting family.
So I just,

3158
02:11:32,350 --> 02:11:33,620
um,
when did you start hunting?

3159
02:11:34,870 --> 02:11:36,380
Oh,
as soon as I could,

3160
02:11:36,381 --> 02:11:38,390
like when I was,
um,

3161
02:11:38,420 --> 02:11:39,111
10,
11,

3162
02:11:39,111 --> 02:11:41,570
12,
I would force my dad.

3163
02:11:41,890 --> 02:11:42,511
Um,
he had a,

3164
02:11:42,511 --> 02:11:45,950
he had a couple of guns cause he just
had guns and he was a kid and he would,

3165
02:11:45,951 --> 02:11:50,940
he would go up and he'd go like deer
hunting once a year with a buddy of his

3166
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:51,840
in Maine.
But you know,

3167
02:11:51,980 --> 02:11:53,880
I think they just drank beer and I don't
think that he,

3168
02:11:53,900 --> 02:11:54,740
like,
he never killed a deer.

3169
02:11:54,741 --> 02:11:57,500
I don't think they ever even deer on and
they just literally drive up getting a

3170
02:11:57,501 --> 02:12:00,320
cabin and their bodies and get hammered,
get hammered.

3171
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:02,120
I think that was probably gay scenario,
right?

3172
02:12:02,121 --> 02:12:04,070
That's like when,
when I was in high school,

3173
02:12:04,071 --> 02:12:05,840
uh,
one of my friends from high school,

3174
02:12:05,841 --> 02:12:07,130
he did that.
He,

3175
02:12:07,131 --> 02:12:07,880
his,
uh,

3176
02:12:07,880 --> 02:12:09,140
his family would,
uh,

3177
02:12:09,170 --> 02:12:11,870
go deer hunting and his dad literally
never killed a deer.

3178
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:13,820
I was like,
that is the dumbest Shit I've ever heard

3179
02:12:13,821 --> 02:12:16,400
in my life.
Your Dad spends all this time hunting in

3180
02:12:16,401 --> 02:12:18,380
the woods is never killed a d not
hunting.

3181
02:12:18,580 --> 02:12:20,510
Yeah.
David Able David.

3182
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:21,830
So,
but yeah,

3183
02:12:21,831 --> 02:12:22,361
so my,
My,

3184
02:12:22,361 --> 02:12:24,550
my dad is a gift to me was,
uh,

3185
02:12:24,590 --> 02:12:27,830
my grandparents got him a subscription,
outdoor life books.

3186
02:12:28,190 --> 02:12:32,360
So He'd get all these at all of these
books that were painted by these gifted

3187
02:12:32,450 --> 02:12:34,670
authors.
One of them was named Jack O'Connor,

3188
02:12:34,671 --> 02:12:37,310
who's inspired my entire career,
but I'd read all these things and,

3189
02:12:38,090 --> 02:12:39,950
and so I just thought,
I want to spend time outside,

3190
02:12:39,951 --> 02:12:43,520
so might as well get a wildlife biology
degree and then do research and live

3191
02:12:43,521 --> 02:12:44,580
outside and things like that.

3192
02:12:44,580 --> 02:12:47,120
And it was odd.
As odd as it was when I was in college,

3193
02:12:47,121 --> 02:12:51,110
I was still hunting a lot and I had
family and friends sent me down and

3194
02:12:51,111 --> 02:12:51,831
they're like,
hey man,

3195
02:12:51,831 --> 02:12:53,660
you got to like buckle down on your
studies.

3196
02:12:53,661 --> 02:12:55,280
And I wasn't disagreeing with them,
but they're like,

3197
02:12:55,281 --> 02:12:58,250
you need to stop hunting.
Stop hunting so much.

3198
02:12:58,670 --> 02:13:01,220
And because I'd literally,
I'd go to the Arctic Caribou hunting by

3199
02:13:01,221 --> 02:13:04,460
myself and I'd come home and go to
classes and then I'd leave to go to

3200
02:13:04,461 --> 02:13:07,150
Alaska on a black bear hunt.
I'd come home and go to classes and I've

3201
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:09,260
just save as much money as I could.
Didn't party,

3202
02:13:09,261 --> 02:13:10,700
didn't drink with any of my body's,
didn't,

3203
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:13,520
you know,
didn't do anything lavish.

3204
02:13:13,521 --> 02:13:15,650
I just literally kept going on trips and
you know,

3205
02:13:15,651 --> 02:13:18,470
it's kind of basically what's led to my
career today.

3206
02:13:18,530 --> 02:13:20,300
But it was funny that I,
you know,

3207
02:13:20,301 --> 02:13:21,890
these kinds of things traveled in
parallel,

3208
02:13:21,891 --> 02:13:22,430
if you will.

3209
02:13:22,430 --> 02:13:24,860
When did you start making films and when
you did it,

3210
02:13:24,890 --> 02:13:29,360
did you make them with the intention of
trying to relay like what I was

3211
02:13:29,361 --> 02:13:33,070
explaining at the beginning of the
podcast that what you do best as you,

3212
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:38,120
you as much as possible in an hour,
you're relaying the whole experience as

3213
02:13:38,881 --> 02:13:43,770
opposed to what you're going to get when
you see a hunting television show or

3214
02:13:43,771 --> 02:13:45,480
what,
especially what you're going to get when

3215
02:13:45,481 --> 02:13:47,860
you see honey in a movie.
So I,

3216
02:13:47,910 --> 02:13:51,600
we started in 2012 and uh,
I had some guys that approached me to

3217
02:13:51,601 --> 02:13:54,740
host a hunting TV show and I said,
why,

3218
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:57,600
what's that going to look like?
And I said,

3219
02:13:57,601 --> 02:13:58,950
well,
we'll pay for your trips.

3220
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:01,170
Um,
we'll get all your sponsors and stuff

3221
02:14:01,171 --> 02:14:02,760
lined up.
You'll be fully sponsored.

3222
02:14:02,761 --> 02:14:04,530
We'll split the sponsor dollars with
you.

3223
02:14:04,531 --> 02:14:06,090
We'll buy your air time x,
Y,

3224
02:14:06,091 --> 02:14:06,330
and z.

3225
02:14:06,330 --> 02:14:08,760
These guys were pretty wealthy.
I was like,

3226
02:14:08,761 --> 02:14:11,400
this sounds like the absolute dream to
me.

3227
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:12,630
Um,
but I said,

3228
02:14:12,631 --> 02:14:15,510
I want to control how it's filmed,
where we go,

3229
02:14:15,540 --> 02:14:18,960
how we hunt and the gear that I use.
And they said 100%.

3230
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:21,690
Well,
very quickly within like the first eight

3231
02:14:21,691 --> 02:14:23,730
days,
those things started to go out the

3232
02:14:23,731 --> 02:14:24,840
window.
They said,

3233
02:14:24,841 --> 02:14:27,510
we want you to go here and hunt with
this guy because he's super popular and

3234
02:14:27,511 --> 02:14:29,590
we want you to kill this animal.
We want you to wear this clothing.

3235
02:14:29,591 --> 02:14:30,151
And I was like,
no,

3236
02:14:30,151 --> 02:14:32,700
I never do any of this.
I'm not doing any of this.

3237
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:33,940
So I said,
you know what,

3238
02:14:33,940 --> 02:14:35,430
you guys,
I appreciate the opportunity but I'm

3239
02:14:35,431 --> 02:14:37,980
going to walk away from this Gig.
And so I walked away from it.

3240
02:14:38,610 --> 02:14:40,020
Um,
and then I met,

3241
02:14:40,021 --> 02:14:43,380
ended up meeting up with kyle of whom
you met earlier is in your green room

3242
02:14:43,381 --> 02:14:43,830
right now.

3243
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:46,440
And then another guy named William
Oltman,

3244
02:14:46,441 --> 02:14:48,840
who's our director of photography now at
CIC Manta.

3245
02:14:49,320 --> 02:14:52,260
And I met up with these guys and,
and through a series of weird

3246
02:14:52,261 --> 02:14:55,160
circumstances we ended up filming
together and we,

3247
02:14:55,170 --> 02:14:57,030
when we just started kind of going on
trips,

3248
02:14:57,031 --> 02:15:01,560
but when we started going on trips,
our intention was never to do a TV show.

3249
02:15:01,590 --> 02:15:06,590
Our intention was how can we tell a
story about what we're doing?

3250
02:15:06,811 --> 02:15:10,500
Because really what we're doing ends up
at having a really fantastic tale.

3251
02:15:10,501 --> 02:15:13,320
It doesn't have to be a huge tail.
It doesn't have to be moby Dick,

3252
02:15:13,650 --> 02:15:15,870
but there's a story whenever you're
going on these hunts.

3253
02:15:15,871 --> 02:15:19,350
And so we just decided to like,
how can we flesh this out?

3254
02:15:19,351 --> 02:15:22,560
So we just went on these trips,
we filmed them as beautifully as we

3255
02:15:22,561 --> 02:15:24,690
could.
We film them as completely as we could

3256
02:15:24,691 --> 02:15:26,190
write.
A lot of guys when they go on these

3257
02:15:26,191 --> 02:15:27,030
trips,
they'll film,

3258
02:15:27,570 --> 02:15:29,730
okay,
you arrived and now you're hunting and

3259
02:15:29,731 --> 02:15:30,570
then you kill an animal.

3260
02:15:30,570 --> 02:15:33,420
And they're just trying to like get a
little piece of when we would try and

3261
02:15:33,421 --> 02:15:36,600
film everything.
And then when we got done,

3262
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:39,450
we started putting together our first
film and we thought,

3263
02:15:39,451 --> 02:15:40,770
okay,
we'll put together a film,

3264
02:15:40,890 --> 02:15:44,910
we'll see what the audience kind of
things and then we'll just play from

3265
02:15:44,911 --> 02:15:46,860
there and we'll just go from there and
see what happens.

3266
02:15:46,861 --> 02:15:50,250
And so I started writing the film,
writing the script,

3267
02:15:51,230 --> 02:15:51,931
every,
all the,

3268
02:15:51,931 --> 02:15:55,440
all the dialogue that was going to live
outside of what was already naturally

3269
02:15:55,441 --> 02:15:58,440
occurring on camera.
And I brought it into Kyle's office and

3270
02:15:58,441 --> 02:15:59,161
I was like,
yeah,

3271
02:15:59,161 --> 02:16:01,500
so read this.
And he picked up my notebook and he's

3272
02:16:01,501 --> 02:16:02,000
like,
dude,

3273
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,530
I've never ever heard you talk like
this.

3274
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:06,930
I've never,
it was I think probably a little bit

3275
02:16:06,931 --> 02:16:09,630
macho and a little bit sensational,
a little bit like,

3276
02:16:10,380 --> 02:16:13,560
um,
being actual delivered,

3277
02:16:13,561 --> 02:16:18,220
like delivering a line and trying to
convey something on film that wasn't me.

3278
02:16:18,220 --> 02:16:19,110
And he's like,
I've never,

3279
02:16:19,111 --> 02:16:21,180
it's like,
why don't you write like how you talk in

3280
02:16:21,181 --> 02:16:23,310
the office,
like when you're ranting and raving and

3281
02:16:23,311 --> 02:16:25,140
talking about wildlife and talking about
your experiences,

3282
02:16:25,350 --> 02:16:26,183
right.
Like that.

3283
02:16:26,580 --> 02:16:28,500
Like,
like paint a picture for us,

3284
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:30,340
you know,
and um,

3285
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:32,710
and answer some questions maybe that you
have of your own.

3286
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:36,340
And so I started writing in that manner.
And then we released our first film in

3287
02:16:36,341 --> 02:16:38,840
2012 or 13.
Uh,

3288
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:40,490
the river's divide,
uh,

3289
02:16:40,540 --> 02:16:43,540
was a story about a deer that I was
hunting for two years in North Dakota

3290
02:16:43,630 --> 02:16:46,090
and it just took off.
Yeah.

3291
02:16:46,091 --> 02:16:47,310
Watch that.
Steve,

3292
02:16:47,430 --> 02:16:49,950
Steve,
Steve Watch named Steve.

3293
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:51,730
Uh,
a friend of mine named him,

3294
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:54,100
um,
because a friend of his,

3295
02:16:54,260 --> 02:16:55,990
uh,
whose name Steve said,

3296
02:16:56,050 --> 02:16:59,380
the fact that you named deer is idiotic
and completely stupid.

3297
02:16:59,381 --> 02:17:02,390
And my friend Jeff said,
great that the next year we find is new.

3298
02:17:02,390 --> 02:17:06,460
The name Steve.
It is a weird thing when you watch a lot

3299
02:17:06,461 --> 02:17:09,940
of these shows and people,
it's a piece of property in the trail

3300
02:17:09,941 --> 02:17:12,550
cameras and they have all these
different names to these deer.

3301
02:17:12,551 --> 02:17:15,130
I'm like,
that's where it gets real squirrely too.

3302
02:17:15,131 --> 02:17:16,330
It's not games.
And I do it too.

3303
02:17:16,331 --> 02:17:19,330
It's not good.
It's not good.

3304
02:17:19,331 --> 02:17:20,230
It's not good.
And we do,

3305
02:17:20,470 --> 02:17:23,290
and it's funny because we were actually
talking about this in the blind one day

3306
02:17:23,291 --> 02:17:26,410
and it's like,
we name things right?

3307
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:28,390
[inaudible] if you have to,
if you have two sons,

3308
02:17:28,391 --> 02:17:29,440
you don't go yet.
There's,

3309
02:17:29,441 --> 02:17:31,120
um,
so there's my skinny boy,

3310
02:17:31,180 --> 02:17:33,910
the one that does okay in school and
here's the little fat one that we can't

3311
02:17:33,911 --> 02:17:35,380
keep pees on the fork with.
But,

3312
02:17:35,381 --> 02:17:37,000
uh,
these are my two kids here.

3313
02:17:37,001 --> 02:17:37,571
You know,
you're like,

3314
02:17:37,571 --> 02:17:39,670
no,
this is Bob and Jeff.

3315
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:40,533
You know,
and,

3316
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:43,180
and so like when were deer hunting with
these animals?

3317
02:17:43,210 --> 02:17:45,340
Like when you're on Lanai,
you don't have this opportunity,

3318
02:17:45,341 --> 02:17:48,850
but if you were there all year long,
you might be like,

3319
02:17:48,851 --> 02:17:51,160
Hey,
I saw the Bach with the crooked.

3320
02:17:51,190 --> 02:17:52,840
You might be like,
I saw crooked horn,

3321
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:54,370
I saw him again tonight.
You know,

3322
02:17:54,371 --> 02:17:57,130
and then it rather than saying to your
wife,

3323
02:17:57,131 --> 02:17:58,540
your girlfriend,
your body's saying,

3324
02:17:58,541 --> 02:17:59,380
Hey,
I saw that,

3325
02:17:59,410 --> 02:18:00,820
you know,
that one block that I'm on it with the

3326
02:18:00,821 --> 02:18:03,580
Krogan instead of going down that road,
you start nicknaming all this stuff,

3327
02:18:03,581 --> 02:18:04,750
right?
People name their cars.

3328
02:18:04,751 --> 02:18:07,360
We named motorcycles.
We not,

3329
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:08,201
I don't know,
whatever,

3330
02:18:08,201 --> 02:18:12,160
I'm going to shut up.
But you got this far in this hunting

3331
02:18:12,161 --> 02:18:14,920
journey and you just recently started
elk hunting.

3332
02:18:16,220 --> 02:18:18,910
Uh,
September is only so long.

3333
02:18:19,060 --> 02:18:20,640
And like I said,
I liked the Arctic,

3334
02:18:20,690 --> 02:18:23,520
so I would just always go moose hunting
and Caribou hunting and yeah,

3335
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:24,420
but,
um,

3336
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:25,780
no excuse whatsoever.

3337
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:26,710
I,
I hunted,

3338
02:18:26,770 --> 02:18:29,110
um,
a few years ago in Colorado,

3339
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:30,340
10 years ago,
15,

3340
02:18:30,341 --> 02:18:31,810
20 years ago,
I hunted cow elk.

3341
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:34,480
I went on a cow elk hunt,
but I literally,

3342
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:36,250
uh,
the hunt lasted three minutes.

3343
02:18:36,550 --> 02:18:38,290
Oh,
I hiked up in the pitch black.

3344
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:39,660
I hiked up to like,
uh,

3345
02:18:39,850 --> 02:18:43,810
11,000 feet,
a second sun came up and there's a huge

3346
02:18:43,811 --> 02:18:46,450
cal look at 30 yards and I shot her and
I was like,

3347
02:18:46,451 --> 02:18:48,850
all right,
that's done.

3348
02:18:49,090 --> 02:18:50,980
And so I cut her up,
cleaned her up,

3349
02:18:50,981 --> 02:18:55,981
and I just had always went to Alaska
during September and not in the elk

3350
02:18:56,291 --> 02:18:57,550
mountains.
And finally it was just like,

3351
02:18:57,551 --> 02:18:59,440
I need to do this.
And it was awesome.

3352
02:18:59,530 --> 02:19:01,840
I had,
I had a good and bad experience,

3353
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:04,870
um,
great experience with like the morning

3354
02:19:04,871 --> 02:19:07,600
that I killed was sensational.
Is misty rainy.

3355
02:19:07,601 --> 02:19:11,560
The Bulls were screaming,
everything was very wild where way back

3356
02:19:11,561 --> 02:19:12,940
in there,
it was really sensational,

3357
02:19:12,941 --> 02:19:14,680
really,
really impactful.

3358
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:16,480
Um,
but up to that point,

3359
02:19:16,481 --> 02:19:20,020
the area that I was hunting,
the shell creek range in Nevada is they

3360
02:19:20,021 --> 02:19:23,950
only have a few tags there,
but when you get a tag,

3361
02:19:23,980 --> 02:19:24,813
everyone,
he,

3362
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:27,740
um,
higher is basically all their family and

3363
02:19:27,741 --> 02:19:30,230
friends to come and help because it's
such a rare tag.

3364
02:19:30,650 --> 02:19:34,940
So there's 30 guys to every tag.
And so I saw four wheelers and side by

3365
02:19:34,941 --> 02:19:39,500
sides and there's complete and utter
intrusion,

3366
02:19:39,530 --> 02:19:43,070
negative intrusion by hunters into this
wilderness.

3367
02:19:43,130 --> 02:19:45,230
It's ridiculous.
And it needs to be stopped in my

3368
02:19:45,231 --> 02:19:47,690
opinion.
Like you should have to leave all your

3369
02:19:47,691 --> 02:19:51,440
motorized vehicles on pavement and going
to the mountains on foot.

3370
02:19:51,470 --> 02:19:53,660
That's my opinion.
But um,

3371
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:58,280
this area that I was in,
they had something like 400 miles of,

3372
02:19:58,880 --> 02:20:02,930
um,
improved a two track roads that guys had

3373
02:20:02,931 --> 02:20:05,090
literally just like,
they see something over here they want

3374
02:20:05,091 --> 02:20:06,710
to get to,
they just start driving.

3375
02:20:06,710 --> 02:20:10,400
They're side by side right across the
sage brush and they just start beating

3376
02:20:10,401 --> 02:20:12,110
this stuff down.
And pretty soon there's a road.

3377
02:20:12,111 --> 02:20:14,780
And so this area started out,
I'll just make these numbers up cause I

3378
02:20:14,781 --> 02:20:17,750
don't remember the,
but they started out with like a hundred

3379
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:22,750
miles of dirt roads in this mountain
system quickly expanded a 400 miles of

3380
02:20:22,971 --> 02:20:26,150
dirt roads because people just trying to
access wherever they want to go with an

3381
02:20:26,151 --> 02:20:30,180
atv really started to impact the elk to
where they,

3382
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:35,180
they were getting pushed out of their
winter ranges by people on Atvs and

3383
02:20:35,181 --> 02:20:39,410
they're getting bullied so badly by
people that were accessing the area by

3384
02:20:39,411 --> 02:20:43,310
atb that they just recently closed down
something like 200 miles of roads.

3385
02:20:43,311 --> 02:20:45,230
And I think they're trying to even close
down even more.

3386
02:20:45,231 --> 02:20:47,810
But as far as I'm concerned,
it should be closed down.

3387
02:20:48,010 --> 02:20:49,250
Uh,
if you want to go and do,

3388
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:52,160
if you want to go and ride your atv,
go ride your atv.

3389
02:20:52,220 --> 02:20:55,520
If your elk hunting leave the atb on the
road right by ATV.

3390
02:20:55,521 --> 02:20:57,260
You're talking about like those little
rangers?

3391
02:20:57,261 --> 02:20:57,950
Those little,
yeah,

3392
02:20:57,950 --> 02:20:59,450
mostly,
mostly side by sides.

3393
02:20:59,451 --> 02:21:01,550
There are a couple of quads but mostly
side by side.

3394
02:21:01,630 --> 02:21:02,690
Yeah,
those,

3395
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:03,840
the,
those are very,

3396
02:21:03,841 --> 02:21:05,520
very controversial.
We were,

3397
02:21:05,521 --> 02:21:08,160
um,
in Nevada a couple of years back,

3398
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:09,750
um,
in the,

3399
02:21:10,290 --> 02:21:12,390
the,
the desert area,

3400
02:21:12,391 --> 02:21:15,090
like sage brush area near,
um,

3401
02:21:16,040 --> 02:21:19,290
a few hours outside of Reno.
And uh,

3402
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:22,090
we experienced a few of those where
people were doing,

3403
02:21:22,190 --> 02:21:23,910
they were using them illegally and they
won't,

3404
02:21:23,970 --> 02:21:26,310
they're driving into these areas where,
you know,

3405
02:21:26,311 --> 02:21:28,500
you're off the road and you're,
you just,

3406
02:21:29,310 --> 02:21:32,070
just driving through these open plains
areas with these,

3407
02:21:32,071 --> 02:21:33,780
uh,
atvs and aren't supposed to be there and

3408
02:21:33,781 --> 02:21:38,781
spook and deer and impacting the
substrate and the soils and the bad.

3409
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:42,990
Yeah,
it's on one hand I say,

3410
02:21:42,991 --> 02:21:43,890
well,
you know,

3411
02:21:44,370 --> 02:21:47,700
it's not the worst thing in the world in
terms of like if you need to get an

3412
02:21:47,701 --> 02:21:50,160
animal out of there,
I kind of agree with it,

3413
02:21:50,161 --> 02:21:53,430
but I kind of understand your point and
maybe you shouldn't even be able to do

3414
02:21:53,431 --> 02:21:56,790
it with that cause.
Cause then you're going to look,

3415
02:21:56,820 --> 02:22:00,510
I mean it's going to be really hard to
regulate whether or not a person should

3416
02:22:00,511 --> 02:22:02,940
or shouldn't be able to use it at any
point in time.

3417
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:04,700
Yeah.
And I'm not talking about like if

3418
02:22:04,701 --> 02:22:08,210
somebody that's handicapped or somebody
that's truly debilitated,

3419
02:22:08,211 --> 02:22:09,110
wants access,
is there,

3420
02:22:09,111 --> 02:22:11,750
absolutely.
By all means I'm talking about able

3421
02:22:11,751 --> 02:22:15,740
bodied middle aged and young men are not

3422
02:22:15,740 --> 02:22:17,570
doing,
they're not working hard.

3423
02:22:17,571 --> 02:22:19,160
Yeah.
That's a weird thing,

3424
02:22:19,161 --> 02:22:19,910
right?
Like they,

3425
02:22:19,910 --> 02:22:22,180
they want to be able to do that.
And then there's also people that want

3426
02:22:22,181 --> 02:22:24,440
to be able to go in there on horseback.
Yeah.

3427
02:22:24,441 --> 02:22:25,860
That's a,
that's another argument.

3428
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:29,070
I've heard people that have been hunting
and they,

3429
02:22:29,071 --> 02:22:31,440
you know,
in a quiet area and then all of a sudden

3430
02:22:31,441 --> 02:22:34,440
five people come by on horseback in
front of them.

3431
02:22:34,470 --> 02:22:36,180
You know,
that there was an outfitter and the

3432
02:22:36,181 --> 02:22:39,150
outfitters,
I mean they took the time to hike 19

3433
02:22:39,151 --> 02:22:42,510
miles deep into the back country and you
know,

3434
02:22:42,630 --> 02:22:44,040
it's,
it's a hard hall.

3435
02:22:44,070 --> 02:22:46,830
And then the next thing you know,
some people come in on horseback and

3436
02:22:48,290 --> 02:22:50,610
it's,
they got pack mules and all sorts of,

3437
02:22:50,611 --> 02:22:53,910
this shit is a fucking caravan of
animals and people and they spook and

3438
02:22:53,911 --> 02:22:54,744
everything out.

3439
02:22:55,440 --> 02:22:56,041
Yup.
And it,

3440
02:22:56,041 --> 02:22:57,860
it all comes down to that,
um,

3441
02:22:58,560 --> 02:22:59,760
that barrier of entry,
right?

3442
02:22:59,790 --> 02:23:01,170
Yeah.
I thrive the most,

3443
02:23:01,171 --> 02:23:03,270
like it's for me.
And I'm sure for you too,

3444
02:23:03,271 --> 02:23:07,440
it's the most rewarding to do the work
backpack in software,

3445
02:23:07,441 --> 02:23:08,380
right?
That's suffering.

3446
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:10,500
Like I feel like we should have to
suffer for these.

3447
02:23:10,580 --> 02:23:13,880
Well,
it's also rewarding to do it on foot

3448
02:23:13,881 --> 02:23:18,380
because you're going deep into this area
that's hard to get to.

3449
02:23:18,650 --> 02:23:20,810
And when you do get there,
there's nothing there.

3450
02:23:20,811 --> 02:23:21,740
But you,
if you,

3451
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:24,400
if you're the type of person that's
willing to,

3452
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:26,330
to hike in seven,
eight,

3453
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:27,410
nine,
10 miles,

3454
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:30,350
the deeper you get,
the further you're going to distance

3455
02:23:30,351 --> 02:23:32,540
yourself from everybody else.
Because most people aren't going to do

3456
02:23:32,541 --> 02:23:33,374
that.
No.

3457
02:23:33,530 --> 02:23:35,960
Most people aren't going to like if you,
especially,

3458
02:23:36,290 --> 02:23:38,120
that's the weird thing about public
land,

3459
02:23:38,121 --> 02:23:39,740
right?
It's like kind of anybody can get in

3460
02:23:39,741 --> 02:23:41,870
there,
but who's going to get in there 22

3461
02:23:41,871 --> 02:23:42,710
miles?
Yeah.

3462
02:23:42,890 --> 02:23:43,780
Very few people.

3463
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:45,560
No,
and I have people all the time,

3464
02:23:45,561 --> 02:23:46,910
and I'm,
I'm sure you go through this too,

3465
02:23:46,911 --> 02:23:50,060
but I'll kill an animal and hunters
right away,

3466
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:53,060
they want to identify you.
Was that on public or private land?

3467
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:55,280
What was on public land?
You know?

3468
02:23:55,281 --> 02:23:55,910
And,
and,

3469
02:23:55,910 --> 02:23:58,490
and people think that it's this and I'm
not,

3470
02:23:58,550 --> 02:23:59,001
I mean,
you know,

3471
02:23:59,001 --> 02:24:00,660
and there's certain areas of country
it's more difficult,

3472
02:24:00,661 --> 02:24:02,690
but people think of you killed an animal
on public land.

3473
02:24:02,691 --> 02:24:04,490
Like you're real hunter.
Cause you had to deal with other

3474
02:24:04,491 --> 02:24:06,020
hunters.
Know where I went,

3475
02:24:06,021 --> 02:24:07,880
there was not another person.
So you know,

3476
02:24:07,881 --> 02:24:10,940
it's like when,
when you're accessing,

3477
02:24:10,941 --> 02:24:12,910
when you're going deep and there's not
atvs,

3478
02:24:12,920 --> 02:24:15,320
there's not side by side and you can
actually hike into an area,

3479
02:24:15,321 --> 02:24:16,820
you can get away from these people,
right.

3480
02:24:16,821 --> 02:24:18,830
You can get away from that.
People are willing to access.

3481
02:24:18,831 --> 02:24:21,410
But um,
people like to celebrate public land

3482
02:24:21,411 --> 02:24:23,060
cause you're,
you are not a guided hunt.

3483
02:24:23,061 --> 02:24:25,110
You weren't in this,
well it's also a wealth both

3484
02:24:25,110 --> 02:24:26,730
thing too.
People want to,

3485
02:24:27,740 --> 02:24:31,110
they want to disparage accomplishments
for people that do things that they're,

3486
02:24:31,130 --> 02:24:33,250
the wealth is the barrier for entry.
Yeah.

3487
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:36,150
Like,
but the problem I have with that is

3488
02:24:36,330 --> 02:24:39,780
first of all,
the wildest of the wild is the place

3489
02:24:39,781 --> 02:24:41,610
where people can't go.
You know,

3490
02:24:41,611 --> 02:24:44,280
and if you can get to,
and the other thing is like if somebody

3491
02:24:44,281 --> 02:24:45,114
said,
hey,

3492
02:24:45,270 --> 02:24:47,940
you know,
I'm going to give you a tag for Nevada

3493
02:24:47,941 --> 02:24:52,941
for some private land area that is just
an unbelievable El Con,

3494
02:24:53,130 --> 02:24:55,290
but it's a private land too,
but I'm gonna give it to you.

3495
02:24:55,620 --> 02:24:57,630
You're not going to go on.
And I've got to do that because it's

3496
02:24:57,631 --> 02:24:59,340
private land.
I don't do that.

3497
02:24:59,370 --> 02:24:59,970
No.
I say,

3498
02:24:59,970 --> 02:25:01,440
can I get it next year too?
Yeah.

3499
02:25:01,441 --> 02:25:04,350
Most people are only saying that they
wouldn't do it because they can't afford

3500
02:25:04,351 --> 02:25:05,730
it.
And so they want to disparage anybody

3501
02:25:05,731 --> 02:25:09,660
you can because there's a barrier for
entry and that barrier is financial.

3502
02:25:10,290 --> 02:25:12,810
But those areas,
when you go,

3503
02:25:12,930 --> 02:25:15,540
if you can get into these private
places,

3504
02:25:15,810 --> 02:25:19,860
those are the areas where they're really
wild because there's no fucking people.

3505
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:22,020
You can't go back there,
you know?

3506
02:25:22,030 --> 02:25:24,010
And you get to see these animals

3507
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:28,570
the way they would be when,
when there is no access to the public

3508
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:29,660
because there isn't.
Yeah.

3509
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:31,420
And that's fast.
But I get it.

3510
02:25:31,421 --> 02:25:34,480
I mean I get the,
the sentiment and I get why people would

3511
02:25:34,481 --> 02:25:37,000
be upset that some people can afford it
and others can't.

3512
02:25:38,050 --> 02:25:38,740
Oh,
for sure.

3513
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:39,850
For sure.
It's definitely,

3514
02:25:39,851 --> 02:25:41,500
um,
yeah,

3515
02:25:41,501 --> 02:25:43,900
I mean it's,
it's everybody wants to participate.

3516
02:25:43,901 --> 02:25:46,330
I mean wants to see and access all these
different areas and,

3517
02:25:46,810 --> 02:25:49,630
and uh,
if you can't write and it's,

3518
02:25:49,910 --> 02:25:53,110
it's a negative experience of somebody
can write and I feel the same way.

3519
02:25:53,111 --> 02:25:54,400
Like you see,
you know,

3520
02:25:54,401 --> 02:25:56,890
I see this every year when I go to some
of these hunting shows around the

3521
02:25:56,891 --> 02:25:58,870
country.
Like I'll go to wild sheep foundation

3522
02:25:58,871 --> 02:26:01,960
and they bring up the Montana bighorn
tag for sale.

3523
02:26:02,410 --> 02:26:04,280
I would love to buy that thing.
Those,

3524
02:26:04,350 --> 02:26:05,770
those things are so ridiculous.

3525
02:26:05,770 --> 02:26:09,070
When we have those auctions in the tags
go for hundreds of thousands of dollars,

3526
02:26:09,071 --> 02:26:12,130
$350,000.
Fucking crazy.

3527
02:26:12,610 --> 02:26:14,470
That really is fucking crazy.
I mean,

3528
02:26:14,471 --> 02:26:17,500
the fact that people spend that money.
And then the other thing is,

3529
02:26:17,501 --> 02:26:19,270
I mean,
I know a guy who did that,

3530
02:26:19,271 --> 02:26:22,960
who hired these people to sit on this
one fucking big horn.

3531
02:26:22,990 --> 02:26:25,110
No.
For months they stay.

3532
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:29,890
They hired these guys to basically be
fulltime employees to scout this one

3533
02:26:29,891 --> 02:26:33,580
gigantic big horn tracking around,
follow it,

3534
02:26:33,581 --> 02:26:36,940
keep an eye on it.
And then finally the season opened in.

3535
02:26:36,941 --> 02:26:39,460
This guy trudged in there and killed it
and killed it.

3536
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:41,800
I,
here's what I would do if I was a

3537
02:26:41,801 --> 02:26:44,080
billionaire or had the cash,
I'd buy the tag.

3538
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:48,490
I'm telling you right now to your face.
I would buy that tag often if I had that

3539
02:26:48,491 --> 02:26:52,210
kind of money.
But instead of hiring the crew to find

3540
02:26:52,211 --> 02:26:54,700
me a big Ram and waltzing in there,
an opening day and killing it,

3541
02:26:54,730 --> 02:26:57,520
I'd fire the crew because I have enough
money.

3542
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:00,210
I'd go in there and spend the entire
season in there myself,

3543
02:27:00,250 --> 02:27:04,420
immersing myself into that wilderness
and using the fact that I have a pile of

3544
02:27:04,421 --> 02:27:08,450
cash at home to live in the wilderness
for 30 days and maybe kill a big Ram,

3545
02:27:08,460 --> 02:27:10,540
maybe not.
But these guys want,

3546
02:27:11,530 --> 02:27:14,140
they want the bragging rights.
They want that giant Ram.

3547
02:27:14,260 --> 02:27:15,580
They want the bragging rights.
It's,

3548
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:16,960
it's,
it's a resume.

3549
02:27:17,310 --> 02:27:19,250
It,
it becomes a resume of animals.

3550
02:27:19,251 --> 02:27:20,000
And,
and I,

3551
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:23,080
I kind of equate it to,
um,

3552
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:24,520
I've talked about this a little bit
before,

3553
02:27:24,521 --> 02:27:26,230
but when,
when we were kids,

3554
02:27:26,231 --> 02:27:28,780
like if you went fishing with your dad
or hunting with your dad or whatever,

3555
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:31,840
like let's say you went down a little
local lake here in California or

3556
02:27:31,841 --> 02:27:33,340
whatever,
and you guys are going bass fishing,

3557
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:36,100
you guys go bass fishing and you're
catching bass or whatever.

3558
02:27:36,101 --> 02:27:38,650
And then all of a sudden,
one magical Sunday morning,

3559
02:27:39,130 --> 02:27:42,460
you or your dad hooks a monster bass and
you,

3560
02:27:42,580 --> 02:27:44,800
you know,
you guys grab the net and you're have

3561
02:27:44,890 --> 02:27:45,940
the energy and the bolt,
right,

3562
02:27:45,941 --> 02:27:46,960
grab that real,
you know,

3563
02:27:46,961 --> 02:27:47,710
keep your rod tip up.

3564
02:27:47,710 --> 02:27:49,720
And you know,
there's a lot of energy around this big

3565
02:27:49,721 --> 02:27:51,370
fish that's going to be really hard to
land.

3566
02:27:51,371 --> 02:27:55,120
It's such a special occurrence.
You finally get the net underneath them,

3567
02:27:55,121 --> 02:27:56,830
you get this big bass in the net and
you're,

3568
02:27:57,040 --> 02:27:59,230
you know,
you're hugging your high five and you're

3569
02:27:59,231 --> 02:27:59,741
all,
my God,

3570
02:27:59,741 --> 02:28:02,590
we've come to this like 30 times.
Just the biggest fish you've ever caught

3571
02:28:03,460 --> 02:28:04,960
that,
that,

3572
02:28:05,140 --> 02:28:05,741
you know.
And then,

3573
02:28:05,741 --> 02:28:07,900
and then you take the pictures and you
go home and tell your,

3574
02:28:07,910 --> 02:28:09,100
you know,
you'd tell your mom,

3575
02:28:09,101 --> 02:28:10,060
you'd tell your friends,
you're like,

3576
02:28:10,061 --> 02:28:12,670
oh my God.
And he came up and he ate the frog and

3577
02:28:12,671 --> 02:28:15,610
we set the hook and you tell that hotel
and you have that energy that lives

3578
02:28:15,611 --> 02:28:19,960
around that fantastic experience.
And these guys are trying to buy that.

3579
02:28:20,500 --> 02:28:23,420
Like that's a remarkable experience when
you,

3580
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:28,160
when you go elk hunting and you stumble
into a really big bowl or you do your

3581
02:28:28,161 --> 02:28:31,040
homework and you,
and you keep truncating down the

3582
02:28:31,041 --> 02:28:33,020
information,
you keep taking steps into the

3583
02:28:33,021 --> 02:28:35,750
wilderness down until you find this
really massive bowl.

3584
02:28:36,380 --> 02:28:38,410
You slip in,
you have the wind right,

3585
02:28:38,430 --> 02:28:40,730
your hidden in a Bush or against a rock
or a,

3586
02:28:41,180 --> 02:28:43,210
and here he comes and you can't believe
it.

3587
02:28:43,211 --> 02:28:45,800
You've done your homework and you've
truncated down this experience.

3588
02:28:45,801 --> 02:28:47,810
And here he comes in,
you'd come to full draw and he,

3589
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:51,080
for whatever reason,
stopped at 30 yards and you find your

3590
02:28:51,081 --> 02:28:51,914
pen,
you just,

3591
02:28:52,390 --> 02:28:54,740
and you watch your Arrow Zip right
through them and you know you're looking

3592
02:28:54,741 --> 02:28:57,410
around for somebody to tell.
It's just a huge experience.

3593
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:02,300
They're trying to bottle that up,
write a big fat check and try to

3594
02:29:02,301 --> 02:29:05,450
experience that in one afternoon that
they're trying to express

3595
02:29:05,480 --> 02:29:09,380
clearancing it,
experience it or is it that they want

3596
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:12,500
to,
to show that they have the thing

3597
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:16,130
they want to show it because that
experience I just described you,

3598
02:29:16,131 --> 02:29:19,880
those emotions everyone can relate to
that are people that have done this can

3599
02:29:19,881 --> 02:29:21,910
relate to that.
So when they show you their pictures of

3600
02:29:21,911 --> 02:29:24,320
their 200 inch ram,
all everybody's got,

3601
02:29:24,321 --> 02:29:29,321
oh man and what all,
how all my assault and really has no

3602
02:29:29,541 --> 02:29:31,280
knees,
no interest in that and whatsoever.

3603
02:29:31,700 --> 02:29:33,380
That is literally just to build a
resume.

3604
02:29:33,381 --> 02:29:35,300
Same with the big main lion,
right?

3605
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:36,890
If you,
if you went in and it,

3606
02:29:36,980 --> 02:29:40,700
it is a truly wilderness experience.
You've really did your homework,

3607
02:29:40,701 --> 02:29:43,280
and I know I'm splitting hairs here,
but this is how my mind works.

3608
02:29:44,180 --> 02:29:45,650
Telling me the story.
I'd love to hear it,

3609
02:29:45,651 --> 02:29:49,390
but if it's anything other than that,
then it's not for [inaudible].

3610
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:51,870
Well,
that's the thing about you.

3611
02:29:51,871 --> 02:29:56,871
What you're saying mirrors what I hear
from guys like Steve Rinella and people

3612
02:29:56,911 --> 02:30:01,290
that are really accomplished hunters
that are very ethical and have the right

3613
02:30:01,291 --> 02:30:05,280
mindset is that this is supposed to be
difficult or hard.

3614
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:07,350
Yeah.
The experience is supposed to be,

3615
02:30:07,351 --> 02:30:10,890
you're supposed to hike all those miles.
You're supposed to go up and down those

3616
02:30:10,891 --> 02:30:12,480
mountains.
It's supposed to be exhausting.

3617
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:15,120
It's supposed to be hard to get close to
one of these creatures.

3618
02:30:15,121 --> 02:30:17,940
It's supposed to be difficult.
You're supposed to not know what's over

3619
02:30:17,941 --> 02:30:19,170
the next ridge.
Yup.

3620
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:23,370
It's suppose that's what's part of the
reward and if that reward isn't there,

3621
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:26,330
it's like shooting fish in a barrel.
Shooting fish in a barrel is

3622
02:30:26,850 --> 02:30:28,950
weird.
It's not interesting at all.

3623
02:30:29,130 --> 02:30:31,020
It's great if you definitely need a
fish.

3624
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:32,280
Yeah,
yeah,

3625
02:30:32,340 --> 02:30:33,300
yeah.
And that's okay.

3626
02:30:33,301 --> 02:30:35,100
Like there's,
there are little,

3627
02:30:35,130 --> 02:30:37,200
you know,
you can cut little corners in life,

3628
02:30:37,201 --> 02:30:38,960
right?
Like you know,

3629
02:30:39,630 --> 02:30:43,110
I'm not saying everything has to be like
cause cause then somebody might say,

3630
02:30:43,111 --> 02:30:45,860
well you're using a compound ball,
you know the guys using a recurve,

3631
02:30:45,890 --> 02:30:49,290
well that's a good argument if an
argument gets weird,

3632
02:30:49,291 --> 02:30:50,670
right?
But if you're doing it,

3633
02:30:50,910 --> 02:30:54,690
we say if you're doing it well and good,
it doesn't matter.

3634
02:30:55,290 --> 02:30:57,270
It shouldn't matter.
Like if you're an ethical,

3635
02:30:57,271 --> 02:31:00,150
if you're hunting for the right reasons,
you're asking yourself these big

3636
02:31:00,151 --> 02:31:02,430
questions.
It shouldn't matter if you pick up a

3637
02:31:02,431 --> 02:31:06,690
rifle and you shoot them at a hundred
yards or you pick up a recurve and you

3638
02:31:06,691 --> 02:31:08,180
shoot him at 10 yards.
Cause I,

3639
02:31:08,460 --> 02:31:10,980
I know recurve shooters,
I can only shoot like 15,

3640
02:31:10,981 --> 02:31:13,080
18 yards.
I know recurve shooters that can shoot

3641
02:31:13,081 --> 02:31:13,711
50,
60,

3642
02:31:13,711 --> 02:31:16,860
70 yards and um,
you know,

3643
02:31:16,861 --> 02:31:18,810
so we're all different.
We all liked it.

3644
02:31:18,870 --> 02:31:20,160
You know,
some people really

3645
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,440
enjoy shooting the rifles.
Some people really enjoy shooting their

3646
02:31:22,441 --> 02:31:23,700
bill.
I don't think we should split hairs

3647
02:31:23,701 --> 02:31:25,050
there.
Um,

3648
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:28,230
just realize that the ball hunter maybe
had to do,

3649
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:32,670
go to the next level of immersion to get
himself next to an animal and,

3650
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:34,770
and you know,
and the rifle hunter,

3651
02:31:34,771 --> 02:31:35,604
you know,
they're,

3652
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:37,110
um,
you know,

3653
02:31:37,111 --> 02:31:38,640
there's a slightly less barrier of
entry,

3654
02:31:38,641 --> 02:31:40,260
but it doesn't mean that there's
anything wrong with it.

3655
02:31:40,290 --> 02:31:40,981
Well,
rifle,

3656
02:31:40,981 --> 02:31:43,050
I've heard it argue and I agree with
them,

3657
02:31:43,051 --> 02:31:47,730
that rifle hunting on public land is
probably more difficult than bow hunting

3658
02:31:47,731 --> 02:31:51,990
on private land without question.
And certainly more difficult than bow

3659
02:31:51,991 --> 02:31:55,890
hunting on public land because bonners
have this,

3660
02:31:55,980 --> 02:32:00,270
the reason I started bow hunting was
have access to public land prior to the

3661
02:32:00,271 --> 02:32:05,010
rifle season to extend my season to go
in the woods when it's quiet and no one

3662
02:32:05,011 --> 02:32:08,160
else around as sea animals acting be a
naturally,

3663
02:32:08,460 --> 02:32:12,420
rather than seeing this orange army and
seeing everything running for its life.

3664
02:32:12,540 --> 02:32:12,950
Right,
right.

3665
02:32:12,950 --> 02:32:14,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

3666
02:32:14,101 --> 02:32:15,450
That's where it gets squirrely,
right?

3667
02:32:15,451 --> 02:32:17,670
I mean,
public access is great,

3668
02:32:17,671 --> 02:32:20,010
but man,
it does get really weird and I've

3669
02:32:20,011 --> 02:32:21,870
experienced it when there's a lot of
hunters around.

3670
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:24,510
It gets real.
Like I was in Wisconsin for opening day

3671
02:32:24,900 --> 02:32:27,960
a couple of years ago and it is like a
war zone.

3672
02:32:28,140 --> 02:32:30,490
The moment light goes off,
you hear boom,

3673
02:32:30,750 --> 02:32:32,150
boom,
boom,

3674
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:34,200
boom.
And I was,

3675
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:36,830
I was with Rinella,
we filmed it for meat eater and I looked

3676
02:32:36,900 --> 02:32:39,360
at my whole,
what the fuck is going on man?

3677
02:32:39,361 --> 02:32:41,280
Where are we at war?
He's like,

3678
02:32:41,281 --> 02:32:42,990
this is opening day in Wisconsin.
I was like,

3679
02:32:42,991 --> 02:32:47,991
that's crazy.
I mean it is just everywhere.

3680
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:51,330
Just gunshots ringing out in the
distance.

3681
02:32:51,390 --> 02:32:52,530
Yup.
And again,

3682
02:32:52,531 --> 02:32:55,320
like you know sometimes we like to talk
about management.

3683
02:32:55,321 --> 02:32:57,240
Not every,
not every population needs to be

3684
02:32:57,241 --> 02:33:00,330
managed,
but literally you probably can't kill

3685
02:33:00,331 --> 02:33:02,610
enough deer that day in Wisconsin.

3686
02:33:02,610 --> 02:33:05,580
You better manage his fucking deer cause
people are hitting them with cars all

3687
02:33:05,581 --> 02:33:07,950
day long.
You literally couldn't kill enough and

3688
02:33:07,951 --> 02:33:09,540
we were eating them.
They were,

3689
02:33:09,570 --> 02:33:13,350
they were eating a lot of corn because a
where my friend Doug durrance farm is

3690
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:15,570
where we're hunting.
It's all corn and man,

3691
02:33:15,571 --> 02:33:17,720
they could not have tasted better.
Yeah,

3692
02:33:17,940 --> 02:33:19,510
they were so good.
Yeah.

3693
02:33:19,740 --> 02:33:22,590
I mean it was,
it's saying we saw tatum that night and

3694
02:33:22,591 --> 02:33:27,591
a cast iron skillet with a garlic salt
and butter and holy shit.

3695
02:33:28,141 --> 02:33:29,300
Was it good?
Yeah.

3696
02:33:29,480 --> 02:33:33,990
We're just moaning orgasmic as to see
whether eating this deer,

3697
02:33:34,260 --> 02:33:35,250
it's cuisine,
man.

3698
02:33:35,251 --> 02:33:36,420
It's really good.
You know?

3699
02:33:36,421 --> 02:33:37,610
And you're sitting there with your
buddies.

3700
02:33:37,611 --> 02:33:38,010
Yeah,
it's,

3701
02:33:38,010 --> 02:33:40,200
it's,
it should be and it's valued.

3702
02:33:40,201 --> 02:33:45,201
Freezing cold outside your indoors and
it's warm and everybody's happy.

3703
02:33:46,260 --> 02:33:47,070
Man.
It was,

3704
02:33:47,070 --> 02:33:48,570
it was epic.
It was epic.

3705
02:33:48,600 --> 02:33:49,650
If something to be told.

3706
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:52,050
Yeah.
It is something to be told.

3707
02:33:52,051 --> 02:33:54,090
I think,
and we should probably wrap this up.

3708
02:33:54,091 --> 02:33:57,150
We're about three hours in,
but I think I would want people,

3709
02:33:57,450 --> 02:33:59,880
if they've,
they've really curious about this

3710
02:34:00,420 --> 02:34:03,210
endeavor,
I really would want people to start with

3711
02:34:03,211 --> 02:34:06,570
your films cause I appreciate that.
I think that what you're doing,

3712
02:34:06,571 --> 02:34:08,820
if they have the time to sit down and
watch that whole thing,

3713
02:34:08,821 --> 02:34:12,780
what you're doing is you,
I think you represent the best.

3714
02:34:13,820 --> 02:34:17,040
Just the best slice.
It's so hard.

3715
02:34:17,110 --> 02:34:21,040
Get that slice and 22 minutes and I
think Rinella does an amazing job and

3716
02:34:21,041 --> 02:34:24,250
doing it in 22 minutes.
But I think what you're,

3717
02:34:24,310 --> 02:34:29,310
what you've done by turning these into
films and by really giving yourself the

3718
02:34:30,161 --> 02:34:35,161
opportunity to relay your appreciation,
the wonder and the all of nature and

3719
02:34:35,851 --> 02:34:39,160
you,
your immersion into that world and to do

3720
02:34:39,161 --> 02:34:43,150
so in such an,
an incredibly creative way and

3721
02:34:43,180 --> 02:34:47,200
beautifully,
visually stunning way that I think

3722
02:34:47,320 --> 02:34:49,270
you've done an amazing service.

3723
02:34:49,270 --> 02:34:52,180
And I think,
I think it's a great place for people to

3724
02:34:52,181 --> 02:34:54,430
start to get a look at them.
And for people that,

3725
02:34:54,520 --> 02:34:57,010
that do hunt,
I think they will really appreciate if

3726
02:34:57,011 --> 02:34:59,530
they haven't seen your stuff before.
I appreciate that man.

3727
02:34:59,590 --> 02:35:02,950
Like it's a,
we definitely suffer for the work,

3728
02:35:02,951 --> 02:35:07,951
like writing the music,
the shooting it like we do,

3729
02:35:08,261 --> 02:35:10,990
we want to represent ourselves with
absolute purity.

3730
02:35:10,991 --> 02:35:13,660
But we also realize that there are
people that have questions.

3731
02:35:13,661 --> 02:35:16,120
So we try to write and behave in a
manner that,

3732
02:35:16,590 --> 02:35:17,140
um,
like,

3733
02:35:17,140 --> 02:35:18,440
like you've,
like you've done today,

3734
02:35:18,441 --> 02:35:19,750
several times in the podcast,
you say,

3735
02:35:19,751 --> 02:35:20,980
Hey,
explaining what a concession is.

3736
02:35:20,981 --> 02:35:22,210
People don't know what a concession.
It's well,

3737
02:35:22,211 --> 02:35:26,230
if you can write in this certain manner,
give them some sort of an education

3738
02:35:26,231 --> 02:35:28,810
while you're telling them the story and
do a poetically.

3739
02:35:28,811 --> 02:35:29,644
And that's,
it's,

3740
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:31,181
it's,
it's,

3741
02:35:31,181 --> 02:35:32,640
uh,
I appreciate it,

3742
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:34,600
but there's so few people doing it that
way.

3743
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:37,150
You know what I mean?
Sitka makes some really good films and

3744
02:35:37,151 --> 02:35:39,070
making some longer films.
You know,

3745
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:43,270
they're in the 20 minutes and longer,
but I think very few people are doing

3746
02:35:43,271 --> 02:35:45,820
what you're doing,
but really making it into a movie.

3747
02:35:46,030 --> 02:35:47,260
You know?
I appreciate that,

3748
02:35:47,261 --> 02:35:49,510
man.
This next one will be about 90 minutes

3749
02:35:49,511 --> 02:35:51,130
in length,
and I'm really excited about it.

3750
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:52,083
I can't wait,
man.

3751
02:35:52,090 --> 02:35:54,090
Let me know.
Donny Vinson,

3752
02:35:54,100 --> 02:35:55,450
ladies and gentlemen,
thanks for being on here,

3753
02:35:55,451 --> 02:35:56,470
man.
I appreciate it.

3754
02:35:56,550 --> 02:35:57,383
Yeah,
thank you.

3755
02:36:05,620 --> 02:36:06,453
Hm.

3756
02:36:07,880 --> 02:36:07,940
Okay.
